<text>[[Professor]] Bernice Surprise Summerfield, or simply Benny, is a fictional character created by author Paul Cornell as a new companion of the Seventh Doctor in Virgin Publishing&#x27;s range of original full-length &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels, the &quot;New Adventures&quot;. The &quot;New Adventures&quot; were authorised novels carrying on from where the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television series had left off, and Summerfield was introduced in Cornell&#x27;s novel &quot;Love and War&quot; in 1992.

==History==
A 26th-century archeologist, Summerfield became a hugely popular character amongst fans of the books, and was present until their end in 1997. She officially stopped travelling with the Doctor in &quot;Happy Endings&quot; but returned a few times thereafter, including the last Virgin New Adventure, &quot;The Dying Days&quot;. That year, Virgin had lost the licence to publish &quot;Doctor Who&quot; fiction, which was not renewed by the BBC. However, range editors Peter Darvill-Evans and Rebecca Levene decided to continue the series with Summerfield as the new lead and without the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; name, the Doctor or any other BBC copyright characters featured.

These &quot;New Adventures&quot; starring Bernice continued until 1999, when the Virgin fiction department closed down. The previous year, however, audio production company Big Finish Productions began issuing full-cast, licensed professional audio dramas starring the character on CD, and they continue to do so, making her the longest-running audio drama series in the world, the longest-running science fiction audio drama series, the longest-running audio drama series with a female lead, andtogether with the booksthe longest-running science fiction series with a female lead. The character is played in all Big Finish&#x27;s productions by actress Lisa Bowerman, who also reprised the role in the live-action fan film &quot;The Crystal Conundrum&quot; and a video advertisement for the audio &quot;The Triumph of Sutekh&quot;. After they gained the licence to produce &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio dramas in 1999, Big Finish thrice featured Bernice in &quot;Doctor Who&quot; stories set during and after the run of the &quot;New Adventures&quot; novels.

Big Finish are still regularly producing Bernice Summerfield audio dramas and the company has also published various novels and short story collections featuring the character.

Bernice also appeared in several comic strips in &quot;Doctor Who Magazine&quot;, with Virgin and the magazine co-operating on her visual depiction. This depiction, which was also applied to novel cover art, was of a slim, statuesque build, with short dark hair, usually shown wearing a catsuit or some similar outfit. Over time the character&#x27;s appearance has been modified, and recent changes include a longer hairstyle.

*&quot;The Dying Days&quot; by Lance Parkin

The Doctor first meets Benny in &quot;Love and War&quot;; she is a 30-year-old archaeologist. She was born in 2540 and is the daughter of Admiral Isaac Douglas Summerfield, a high-ranking Spacefleet officer. Her mother, Claire Summerfield, died when Daleks attacked their homeworld of Beta Caprisis, an Earth colony. She has not seen her father for many years and has spent much of her life searching for him. At times she falsely claims to have a degree from Heidelberg University. She published an archaeological book called &quot;Down Among the Dead Men&quot; in the year 2566.

&quot;Theatre of War&quot; features the first encounter between Bernice and Irving Braxiatel (from her perspective). He later becomes a regular character in the Bernice Summerfield-only New Adventures. In &quot;Sanctuary&quot; Bernice falls in love with Guy de Carnac, a former Knight Templar. He is killed later in the novel. In &quot;Death and Diplomacy&quot; she meets her future husband Jason Kane, who she marries in the next novel, &quot;Happy Endings&quot;. Bernice leaves the TARDIS after this novel, but she appears in certain subsequent &quot;Doctor Who&quot; novels. In &quot;Return of the Living Dad&quot;, Bernice finally resolves the mystery of what happened to her father.

Virgin had long considered a non-&quot;Doctor Who&quot; spin-off series, but plans were moved forwards when they lost the license from the BBC. A number of preparations were made for the transition to Bernice-led New Adventures (see below). As Virgin felt Bernice would make a better lead as a single woman, she and Jason Kane were split up. Thus, she appears again in &quot;Eternity Weeps&quot;, a novel which describes the breakdown of her marriage and is also focused on her more than the Doctor as a prototype for the Doctor-free novels to come.

Likewise, the last New Adventure, &quot;The Dying Days&quot;, is again focused on Bernice more than the Doctor, with the Doctor absent from a substantial portion of the book. &quot;The Dying Days&quot; also features an ambiguous epilogue which can be taken to imply that the Doctor and Bernice have sex. This same epilogue also has the Doctor indicating that Benny is his longest-serving companion, although exactly how long she travelled with the Doctor has never been firmly established.

*&quot;Tears of the Oracle&quot; by Justin Richards
*&quot;Return to the Fractured Planet&quot; by Dave Stone
*&quot;The Joy Device&quot; by Justin Richards
*&quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot; by Mark Clapham and Jon de Burgh Miller

Originally published once a month, the New Adventures went to once every two months after &quot;The Sword of Forever&quot;. The New Adventures continued with Bernice generally in the leading role. &quot;Oh No It Isn&#x27;t!&quot; provides the set-up for subsequent stories, with Bernice becoming Professor of Archaeology at St Oscar&#x27;s University on the planet Dellah. She has now put her failed marriage to Jason Kane behind her. &quot;Oh No It Isn&#x27;t!&quot; also re-introduces the People, a highly advanced alien race from the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; New Adventures.

In &quot;Ghost Devices&quot;, we meet Clarence (named after the angel in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;). Clarence appears in the form of an angel, but is an artificial intelligence from the People who is eventually (in &quot;Tears of the Oracle&quot;) revealed to be a character from &quot;The Also People&quot;. In &quot;Dragons&#x27; Wrath&quot;, Bernice meets Irving Braxiatel for the first time (from his perspective). &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot; introduces another recurring character, Emile Mars-Smith. Emile, Clarence and the People appear in a number of subsequent New Adventures, while Braxiatel appears in both further New Adventures and Benny stories from Big Finish.

&quot;Where Angels Fear&quot; starts the Gods arc, a loose overarching story that finishes in &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot;. Along the way, Dellah is destroyed and Bernice is uprooted and loses her memory. &quot;Twilight of the Gods&quot; finishes with a new set-up for subsequent stories involving Bernice, Emile and others, but this was not used as Virgin stopped publishing the series.

Though part of this sequence of stories, &quot;Dead Romance&quot; was released as a standalone, and Summerfield is not in it; and the main character and narrator Christine Summerfield are not connected to her in any way. A former New Adventures Seventh Doctor companion, Chris Cwej, does appear, and the Seventh Doctor briefly appears as &quot;the Evil Renegade&quot; in Chris&#x27;s tampered memories. Almost the entirety of the book is set within a bottle universe, a concept most fully explored in Miles&#x27;s two-book cycle &quot;&quot;, and it is implied that it is the same bottle universe. A second edition of &quot;Dead Romance&quot; contained some minor alterations making the book more consistent with Miles&#x27;s later Faction Paradox mythos. However, this idea was never followed up on in any future novels.

As well as continuing the New Adventures after losing the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; license, Virgin also continued with their &quot;Decalog&quot; series. These had been &quot;Doctor Who&quot; short story anthologies, but &quot;Decalog 5: Wonders&quot; featured a Benny short story (&quot;The Judgement of Solomon&quot;) by Lawrence Miles alongside other shorts not set in the New Adventures continuity.

*&quot;The Squire&#x27;s Crystal&quot; by Jacqueline Rayner
*&quot;The Infernal Nexus&quot; by Dave Stone
*&quot;The Glass Prison&quot; by Jacqueline Rayner

Big Finish licensed the character of Bernice Summerfield from Paul Cornell, Irving Braxiatel from Justin Richards and Jason Kane from Dave Stone, but other elements of the Virgin New Adventures&#x27; fictional universe were not obtained. Instead, Gary Russell, Jacqueline Rayner and Cornell developed a new background and character ensemble, introduced in the anthology &quot;The Dead Men Diaries&quot; and developed in the initial run of paperbacks. The most notable development in Big Finish&#x27;s paperback novels was Bernice&#x27;s pregnancy and the birth of her son in &quot;The Glass Prison&quot;.

The paperback novels proved uneconomic and Big Finish stopped publishing them, subsequently re-launching their Benny books in hardback with the anthology &quot;A Life of Surprises&quot;.

Bernice appears in one of the &quot;New Series Adventures&quot; with the Twelfth Doctor (the novel was originally planned for River Song, but plans for the 2015 Christmas special &quot;The Husbands of River Song&quot; prompted Russell to use Benny instead).

*&quot;Big Bang Generation&quot; by Gary Russell

==Characters==
This is a list of recurring characters from the Bernice Summerfield stories, both the original &quot;Virgin New Adventures&quot; featuring Bernice and the subsequent and ongoing series of audio dramas and novels by Big Finish Productions.

===Irving Braxiatel===
===Clarence===
Clarence is an artificial intelligence from the People. The character was created and introduced by Simon Bucher-Jones for &quot;Ghost Devices&quot; in which Clarence appears in the form of an angel (he is named after the angel in &quot;It&#x27;s a Wonderful Life&quot;) to Benny. Clarence is an agent of God, the artificial intelligence that controls the People&#x27;s Dyson sphere and is eventually revealed (in &quot;Tears of the Oracle&quot;) to be a character from &quot;The Also People&quot;.

===God===
God is the super-advanced artificial intelligence controlling the People&#x27;s Dyson sphere. The character was introduced by Ben Aaronovitch in &quot;The Also People&quot; and became a frequently recurring character in the later New Adventures based around Bernice. On several occasions, God sought to use Bernice as his agent, often sending his emissary Clarence to visit her.

===Joseph===
Joseph is Bernice Summerfield&#x27;s robotic secretary. He appears in several Bernice stories across the Virgin New Adventures and Big Finish&#x27;s Bernice stories.

===Jason Kane===
Jason Peter Kane was introduced in &quot;Death and Diplomacy&quot;. In 1996, 13-year-old runaway Jason is caught in an alien transportation beam, which deposits him in a swamp on the planet t&#x27;Kao in the 26th century. After thirteen years, the first human being he meets is Benny. When they discuss their sex lives, Jason candidly discusses having slept with nine women, five men and a number of (to varying degrees) humanoid aliens. He becomes a romantic foil for Benny, with their marriage being the centrepiece for &quot;Happy Endings&quot;, itself celebrating the New Adventures line as its fiftieth book. They are a happily married couple in &quot;Return of the Living Dad&quot;, however when the BBC withdrew the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; licence, and the New Adventures continued with Benny as the lead character, an editorial decision was taken to split the couple up, as depicted in &quot;Eternity Weeps&quot;. Jason remains an intermittently recurring character. He remarries in &quot;Deadfall&quot;, but his new wife does not appear again in the series. When the New Adventures came to an end, he was trapped in an alternate dimension equivalent to Hell, but Benny&#x27;s adventures continued with an ongoing series of novels and audio dramas by Big Finish Productions and, through an agreement with creator Dave Stone, Jason re-appeared (portrayed by Stephen Fewell in the audio dramas) and his relationship with Benny restarted. It is strongly implied in &quot;The End of the World&quot; that he has been killed.

===John Lafayette===
John Lafayette (from &quot;Walking to Babylon&quot;) was a Victorian translator who was exploring the ruins of Babylon. There, he stumbled across a time corridor and was drawn back in time to the city in ancient times. There he met with Bernice who was seeking out renegade members of the People and Jason, and becomes romantically involved with her.

Lafayette also appears in the audio play &quot;Birthright&quot;, although he had not appeared in the New Adventure on which it was based.

===Emile Mars-Smith===
Emile Mars-Smith was introduced in Matthew Jones&#x27;s novel &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot; in 1997. &quot;Beyond the Sun&quot; was adapted into an audio drama by Big Finish Productions, in which Emile was portrayed by Lewis Davis.

Emile was brought up by a strict religious father, and at the age of fifteen ran away to St. Oscar&#x27;s University on the planet Dellah. Emile was one of Benny&#x27;s students at St. Oscar&#x27;s, and she took him on a field trip to the planet Apollox 4 where they became entangled with an alien species known as the Sunless. During the adventure, Emile finds himself attracted to another man, and realises he is gay.

===Ronan McGinley===
Ronan McGinley is an office worker from the early 21st Century. One day, while having a cigarette, he meets Irving Braxiatel who promises him one summer of adventure. Braxiatel brings McGinley to the Collection and instigates a romance between him and Clarissa Jones. She is still mourning the loss of her lover, Bernard Moskoff, who was killed during the events of &quot;Death and the Daleks&quot;. Clarissa enjoys her time with Ronan but is also suspicious as to his past. Investigating, she finds evidence (planted by Braxiatel) that he was a Fifth Axis soldier. She asks him to leave the Collection but, unknown to her, he meets with Braxiatel who tells him that the one good summer he promised is over.
Then, a year later, Jason Kane finds McGinley on the planet Cantus. Braxiatel has connected the man to an army of Cybermen in order to keep them under control. During the events of this story, McGinley dies.
In the audio drama &quot;The Crystal of Cantus&quot;, McGinley is portrayed by Nicholas Briggs.

===Parasiel===
Parasiel is a student on the Braxiatel Collection. When he first arrives, shortly after the end of the Fifth Axis Occupation, his lack of social skills means he is not particularly popular. As he spends more time on the Collection, his behaviour softens a little, and he has a series of affairs with female students. Bernice tells him about the events of &quot;The Goddess Quandary&quot; and then &quot;The Crystal of Cantus&quot;. During the second of these adventures, he also has his memory erased by Irving Braxiatel. He left the Collection in &quot;Collected Works&quot; after one of his love affairs ended tragically; though he says he might return, Benny doubts she&#x27;ll see him again.

===Admiral Isaac Summerfield===
Admiral Isaac Douglas Summerfield is the father of Bernice. A high-ranking officer in space fleet, he went to fight against the Daleks and never returned to his wife and child. Bernice never gave up hope that he could still be alive, and was eventually rewarded when she found him on Earth in 1983. It was revealed in Kate Orman&#x27;s novel &quot;Return of the Living Dad&quot; that, during a battle at Bellatrix, the Admiral&#x27;s ship had been drawn into a worm hole which deposited him back in time to 1963. There he organised a resistance cell to fight the Daleks. 20 years later, Bernice managed to locate him in the village of Little Caldwell. The Admiral was running an underground network helping stranded aliens to leave Earth. He always worried that he would be discovered and shut down by the Doctor.

However, he also had a more sinister plan to detonate a nuclear device on Earth. This would trigger an arms-race that could lead to the development of weapons capable of defeating the Daleks when they tried to invade Earth in the 22nd century. However, the alien he was conspiring with was revealed to be a Dalek agent, and was uncovered by the Doctor. Managing to forgive her father for his manipulation, Bernice teamed up with him and the Doctor and used a missile to destroy a Dalek spy satellite.

In the audio drama &quot;Death and the Daleks&quot;, Summerfield is portrayed by Ian Collier, who voiced Omega in &quot;Arc of Infinity&quot; and &quot;Omega&quot;.

===Christine Summerfield / Cousin Eliza===
Narrator of the standalone novel &quot;Dead Romance&quot;, which did not feature Bernice.
Christine found out her entire world was a bottle universe being used by Time Lords as a bolt hole to escape the Gods. During the course of the novel she began a relationship with Chris Cwej and helped him to prepare the bottle for the arrival of the Time Lords.
After learning of Bernice Summerfield she became fascinated by her and her history convinced there was a connection between them.
The novel ended with her being betrayed by Cwej and deciding to leave the bottle for the &quot;real&quot; universe, she eventually ended up on a Gallifrey in ruins, writing her story which she left among the ruins.
The last entry of Dead Romance states that she believed that the &quot;real&quot; universe was just a bigger bottle within bigger and bigger bottles; and maybe she could keep traveling upwards through the different bottles until she found the real universe. However she did not seem to achieve this goal as she sent a letter to Bernice in Twilight of the Gods where it is stated that she took a post at a university on the planet Vremnya.
Some point after this she was initiated into Faction Paradox where she adopted the title, Cousin Eliza, and is subsequently quoted in &quot;The Book of the War&quot;; she is one of the central characters in the Faction Paradox audio dramas.

===Peter Summerfield===
Peter Guy Summerfield is the son of Bernice and Adrian Wall. His middle name Guy was in honour of Sir Guy de Carnac, a man with whom Benny fell in love in the novel &quot;Sanctuary&quot; but who then apparently died. The circumstances of his conception were unusual because Benny was being controlled by an alien sorceress. Peter appeared the audio drama, &quot;The Grel Escape&quot;, in which he was voiced by Dacey Warriner and &quot;The Crystal of Cantus&quot; in which he was voiced by Thomas Grant.

===Bev Tarrant===
===Adrian Wall===
Adrian Wall is a Killoran construction worker for the Braxiatel collection. Killorans are a species who resemble a cross between a wolf and an ape, and Adrian was seven feet tall with huge claws and fangs. He took his name from Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, in preference to his native Killoran name, after studying the Roman emperor

During the events of &quot;The Squire&#x27;s Crystal&quot;, Bernice was possessed by an alien sorceress. Whilst possessed she became impregnated by Adrian, and later gave birth to a baby boy whom she named Peter.

The Killorans appear in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio plays &quot;Arrangements for War&quot; (where they invade the planet Világ) and its sequel &quot;Thicker than Water&quot;. The novella &quot;Hiding Places&quot; by Stewart Sheargold, published in the anthology &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, reveals that Adrian was present on Világ.

==Audio plays==

=== Cast and characters ===

===&quot;Bernice Summerfield&quot;===

====Season 1 (1998–2000)====
The first season of Bernice Summerfield audio plays are all adaptations of New Adventures novels originally published by Virgin Publishing. Each of the plays spans two CDs, except for &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Wrath&quot;, which was issued on a single CD.

The plays deviate from the original novels, in terms of plot and characters, to varying degrees. This is particularly evident with the productions of &quot;Birthright&quot; and &quot;Just War&quot;, both of which were originally Doctor Who novels. These changes were necessary because, at the time of their production, Big Finish Productions weren&#x27;t licensed to produce Doctor Who audio plays.

Actor and photographer Lisa Bowerman was cast in the role of Bernice Summerfield. Bowerman had previously appeared in the Doctor Who story &quot;Survival&quot; (1989). The first series also co-starred Stephen Fewell as Jason Kane. A variety of actors familiar to Doctor Who fans played guest roles in many of the plays, including Colin Baker, Sophie Aldred, Nicholas Courtney, Elisabeth Sladen, Anneke Wills and Richard Franklin.
&lt;section begin=season1 /&gt;


&lt;section end=season1 /&gt;

====Season 2 (2000–01)====
For the second season of Bernice Summerfield audio plays, Big Finish Productions experimented by developing ongoing character arcs that alternated between two different mediums—the audio plays and novels. Fans who did not collect the novels were initially confused to discover that Benny was pregnant during the final audio play of the season, &quot;The Skymines of Karthos&quot;. The pregnancy was explained in the novel &quot;The Squire&#x27;s Crystal&quot; by Jacqueline Rayner.

The run of plays from the second season onwards take part in what has become known as the Collection continuity, as they are set primarily on the Braxiatel Collection, a combined museum and university located on the planetoid KS-159. A number of regular characters are introduced, most notably Irving Braxiatel. First referenced in the 1979 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; story &quot;City of Death&quot; (written by Douglas Adams and Graham Williams), Braxiatel first appeared in person in the New Adventures novel &quot;Theatre of War&quot;.
&lt;section begin=season2 /&gt;


&lt;section end=season2 /&gt;

====Season 3 (2002–03)====
Whereas the previous seasons had focused primarily on the character of Bernice Summerfield, Big Finish used the third season as an opportunity to introduce an ensemble feel to the productions. This is most evident in &quot;The Green-Eyed Monsters&quot; and &quot;The Mirror Effect&quot; where the characters Jason Kane, Adrian Wall and Irving Braxiatel are significantly developed. The latter, in particular, suggests that Braxiatel has a darker, more mysterious past than the audience has previously been led to believe.

The other two plays that comprise the third season focus more specifically on Bernice. &quot;The Greatest Shop in the Galaxy&quot; remains the most light-hearted play of the season, while &quot;The Dance of the Dead&quot; reintroduces the Ice Warriors from &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

While not officially part of the third season (at least as far as the numbering is concerned), the &quot;Bernice Summerfield&quot; audio play &quot;The Plague Herds of Excelis&quot; (the fourth play in Big Finish&#x27;s &quot;Excelis&quot; series; the first three plays fall under the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; umbrella) takes place between &quot;The Green-Eyed Monsters&quot; and &quot;The Dance of the Dead&quot;. Chronologically, the short story anthology &quot;A Life of Surprises&quot; also falls within this gap.
&lt;section begin=season3 /&gt;

&lt;section end=season3 /&gt;

====Season 4 (2003–04)====
The fourth season was unofficially dubbed the &quot;classic Who monsters&quot; season, with each play featuring an alien adversary that previously appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; television series. &quot;The Bellotron Incident&quot; predominantly features the Rutan Host (their major enemies, the Sontarans, are also referred to but don&#x27;t actually appear), &quot;The Draconian Rage&quot; features the Draconians, &quot;The Poison Seas&quot; casts a more sympathetic light on the Sea Devils, while &quot;Death and the Daleks&quot; (the first double CD release in the series since &quot;Just War&quot;) sees the first appearance of the Daleks within the Bernice Summerfield series. Prior to its release, &quot;Death and the Daleks&quot; was entitled &quot;The Axis of Evil&quot; to keep the appearance of the Daleks a secret.

Big Finish also published an anthology of short stories, entitled &quot;Life During Wartime&quot;, that was specially written as a prelude to the &quot;Death and the Daleks&quot; audio play. Paul Cornell, the anthology&#x27;s editor, described &quot;Life During Wartime&quot; as &quot;a novel written by multiple authors&quot;. Each of the collection&#x27;s stories are told in chronological order, detailing events that occur when the Collection is occupied by a powerful alien force. The anthology ends on a cliff-hanger that is resolved in &quot;Death and the Daleks&quot;.
&lt;section begin=season4 /&gt;

====Season 5 (2004–05)====
The previous season&#x27;s tradition of using classic monsters continues into the fifth season, with the Grel (previously heard in &quot;Oh No It Isn&#x27;t!&quot;) returning in &quot;The Grel Escape&quot;, a knowing pastiche of &quot;The Chase&quot;. &quot;The Bone of Contention&quot; features the Galyari, who appeared in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio play &quot;The Sandman&quot;, while the title and plot of &quot;The Relics of Jegg-Sau&quot; was inspired by a 1970s &quot;Doctor Who&quot; licensed jigsaw puzzle that depicted a scene with giant robots identical to the one that appeared in &quot;Robot&quot;.

&quot;The Masquerade of Death&quot; brings the fifth season to a close in a dark and surreal fashion.
&lt;section begin=season5 /&gt;


&lt;section end=season5 /&gt;

====Season 6 (2005–06)====
By the end of &quot;The Crystal of Cantus&quot;, the true dark and manipulative nature of Braxiatel was revealed and he left the Collection. Its future is now uncertain, with the Draconians claiming they own the planetoid on what it is based. The entire series was directed by Gary Russell.
&lt;section begin=season6 /&gt;

&lt;section end=season6 /&gt;

====Season 7 (2006)====
The seventh season follows the staff of the Collection as they attempt to keep things running smoothly in Braxiatel&#x27;s absence. &quot;Collected Works&quot; and &quot;Old Friends&quot;, two books published during this season&#x27;s run, also develop the running plots that planetoid KS-159 is under threat from the Draconians and Mim, and that the Collection itself is falling apart literally as well as figuratively without Braxiatel at its helm.
&lt;section begin=season7 /&gt;


&lt;section end=season7 /&gt;

====Season 8 (2007–08)====
In the eighth season, Braxiatel returns to the Collection, which is threatened by crossfire and politics in the war between the Draconians and Mim. The war comes to an unexpected conclusion shortly after his return, and several regular characters pay a heavy price for realising too late that Braxiatel himself is the real threat. The season ends with Benny cutting her ties to the Collection and Braxiatel, and going on the run with her son Peter. The books &quot;The Two Jasons&quot; and &quot;|Nobody&#x27;s Children&quot; also fit into this season&#x27;s arc.

<text>The history of loop quantum gravity spans more than three decades of intense research.

==History==
===Classical theories of gravitation===
General relativity is the theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915. According to it, the force of gravity is a manifestation of the local geometry of spacetime. Mathematically, the theory is modelled after Bernhard Riemann&#x27;s metric geometry, but the Lorentz group of spacetime symmetries (an essential ingredient of Einstein&#x27;s own theory of special relativity) replaces the group of rotational symmetries of space. (Later, loop quantum gravity inherited this geometric interpretation of gravity, and posits that a quantum theory of gravity is fundamentally a quantum theory of spacetime.)

In the 1920s, the French mathematician Élie Cartan formulated Einstein&#x27;s theory in the language of bundles and connections, a generalization of Riemannian geometry to which Cartan made important contributions. The so-called Einstein–Cartan theory of gravity not only reformulated but also generalized general relativity, and allowed spacetimes with torsion as well as curvature. In Cartan&#x27;s geometry of bundles, the concept of parallel transport is more fundamental than that of distance, the centerpiece of Riemannian geometry. A similar conceptual shift occurs between the invariant interval of Einstein&#x27;s general relativity and the parallel transport of Einstein–Cartan theory.

===Spin networks===
In 1971, physicist Roger Penrose explored the idea of space arising from a quantum combinatorial structure. His investigations resulted in the development of spin networks. Because this was a quantum theory of the rotational group and not the Lorentz group, Penrose went on to develop twistors.

===Loop quantum gravity===
In 1982, Amitabha Sen tried to formulate a Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity based on spinorial variables, where these variables are the left and right spinorial component equivalents of Einstein–Cartan connection of general relativity. Particularly, Sen discovered a new way to write down the two constraints of the ADM Hamiltonian formulation of general relativity in terms of these spinorial connections. In his form, the constraints are simply conditions that the spinorial Weyl curvature is trace free and symmetric. He also discovered the presence of new constraints which he suggested to be interpreted as the equivalent of Gauss constraint of Yang–Mills field theories. But Sen&#x27;s work fell short of giving a full clear systematic theory and particularly failed to clearly discuss the conjugate momenta to the spinorial variables, its physical interpretation, and its relation to the metric (in his work he indicated this as some lambda variable).

In 1986–87, physicist Abhay Ashtekar completed the project which Amitabha Sen began. He clearly identified the fundamental conjugate variables of spinorial gravity: The configuration variable is as a spinoral connection (a rule for parallel transport; technically, a connection) and the conjugate momentum variable is a coordinate frame (called a vierbein) at each point. So these variable became what we know as Ashtekar variables, a particular flavor of Einstein–Cartan theory with a complex connection. General relativity theory expressed in this way, made possible to pursue quantization of it using well-known techniques from quantum gauge field theory.

The quantization of gravity in the Ashtekar formulation was based on Wilson loops, a technique developed by Kenneth G. Wilson in 1974 to study the strong-interaction regime of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). It is interesting in this connection that Wilson loops were known to be ill-behaved in the case of standard quantum field theory on (flat) Minkowski space, and so did not provide a nonperturbative quantization of QCD. However, because the Ashtekar formulation was background-independent, it was possible to use Wilson loops as the basis for nonperturbative quantization of gravity.

Due to efforts by Sen and Ashtekar, a setting in which the Wheeler–DeWitt equation was written in terms of a well-defined Hamiltonian operator on a well-defined Hilbert space was obtained. This led to the construction of the first known exact solution, the so-called Chern–Simons form or Kodama state. The physical interpretation of this state remains obscure.

In 1988–90, Carlo Rovelli and Lee Smolin obtained an explicit basis of states of quantum geometry, which turned out to be labeled by Penrose&#x27;s spin networks. In this context, spin networks arose as a generalization of Wilson loops necessary to deal with mutually intersecting loops. Mathematically, spin networks are related to group representation theory and can be used to construct knot invariants such as the Jones polynomial. Loop quantum gravity (LQG) thus became related to topological quantum field theory and group representation theory.

In 1994, Rovelli and Smolin showed that the quantum operators of the theory associated to area and volume have a discrete spectrum. Work on the semi-classical limit, the continuum limit, and dynamics was intense after this, but progress was slower.

On the semi-classical limit front, the goal is to obtain and study analogues of the harmonic oscillator coherent states (candidates are known as weave states).

===Hamiltonian dynamics===
LQG was initially formulated as a quantization of the Hamiltonian ADM formalism, according to which the Einstein equations are a collection of constraints (Gauss, Diffeomorphism and Hamiltonian). The kinematics are encoded in the Gauss and Diffeomorphism constraints, whose solution is the space spanned by the spin network basis. The problem is to define the Hamiltonian constraint as a self-adjoint operator on the kinematical state space. The most promising work in this direction is Thomas Thiemann&#x27;s Phoenix Project.

===Covariant dynamics===
Much of the recent work in LQG has been done in the covariant formulation of the theory, called &quot;spin foam theory.&quot; The present version of the covariant dynamics is due to the convergent work of different groups, but it is commonly named after a paper by Jonathan Engle, Roberto Pereira and Carlo Rovelli in 2007–08. Heuristically, it would be expected that evolution between spin network states might be described by discrete combinatorial operations on the spin networks, which would then trace a two-dimensional skeleton of spacetime. This approach is related to state-sum models of statistical mechanics and topological quantum field theory such as the Turaeev–Viro model of 3D quantum gravity, and also to the Regge calculus approach to calculate the Feynman path integral of general relativity by discretizing spacetime.

<text>San Leonardo in Arcetri is a Romanesque-style, Roman Catholic church located on Via di San Leonardo #25, a few hundred meters southeast of the Porta San Giorgio of Florence, Italy.

==History==

A church at the site appears founded just after the year 1000, with a typical hemicircular apse. The facade is made from rustic stone bricks. In the late 19th-century, the church had much of the baroque accretions removed, reverting the interior to reveal the sparse Romanesque elements. The facade has a round oculus in the tympanum. The interior houses a 13th-century pulpit, formerly in the church of San Pier Scheraggio, and transferred here in 1782. That church was demolished during the construction of the Uffizi. The square elevated pulpit has delicately carved bas-relief square marble panels, depicting various biblical scenes:
* &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot;
* &quot;Madonna and child&quot;
* &quot;Evangelists and the Dream of the Virgin&quot;
* &quot;Baptism of Christ&quot;
* &quot;Presentation of Christ at the Temple&quot;
* &quot;Nativity of Christ&quot;
* &quot;Deposition from the Cross&quot;

The main altarpiece presently is a 15th-century triptych by Lorenzo di Niccolò, depicting an &quot;Enthroned Madonna and Child&quot; flanked by depictions of Saints Anthony Abbot, Leonard, James the Apostle, and Lawrence. Another altarpiece depicts &quot;Archangel Raphael with Tobias, St Leonard, and St Sebastian&quot; (circa 1478) by followers of Neri di Bicci. Two altarpieces are attributed to Neri di Bicci: including a &quot;Madonna of the Assumption grants a belt to St Thomas, flanked by Saints Peter, Jerome, Francis, and John the Baptist&quot;. Cosimo Ulivelli painted some frescoes in the apse.

Dante and Boccaccio are said to have preached from the pulpit. The church stands among olive groves on the Via San Leonardo, a country road on the southern outskirts of Florence, next to Villa Spelman, seat of the Johns Hopkins University Charles S. Singleton Center for Italian Studies.

<text>Startforth Rural District was a rural district in the North Riding of the historic county of Yorkshire in the Pennines of northern England.

It was formed in 1894 under the Local Government Act 1894. It constituted the part of the Teesdale Rural Sanitary District that was in the North Riding (the rest being in County Durham).

In 1974, the district was abolished and became, for administrative purposes, part of the Teesdale district of the non-metropolitan county of County Durham.

It comprised the area south of the River Tees between Cow Green Reservoir and Gainford, and north of the modern administrative border between County Durham and North Yorkshire.

The area is hilly and fairly sparsely populated. Places within it included;

<text>Robert Mandan (February 2, 1932 – April 29, 2018) was an American actor, best known for his roles as Sam Reynolds on &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; (1965–1970), Chester Tate, the philandering businessman husband of Jessica Tate (Katherine Helmond) on the satirical sitcom &quot;Soap&quot; (1977–1981) and James Bradford on the short lived &quot;Three&#x27;s Company&quot; spin off &quot;Three&#x27;s A Crowd&quot; (1984–1985) that lasted for one season.

==Career==
Mandan first acted in such television serials as NBC&#x27;s &quot;From These Roots&quot; (1958–1961) and businessman Sam Reynolds on &quot;Search for Tomorrow&quot; (1965–1970). He also appeared on Broadway in the 1970 musical &quot;Applause&quot;.

His sitcom appearances prior to &quot;Soap&quot; include an auctioneer in the 1972 premiere episode of &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, attorney Mr. Morrison in a 1973 episode of &quot;All in the Family&quot;, and Maude&#x27;s gay friend Barry on a 1974 episode of &quot;Maude&quot;. In 1972, Mandan appeared in the first episode of the last season of &quot;Mission Impossible&quot; as Tim Sharkey. He also appeared in the &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; episodes titled &quot;Counterfall&quot;, &quot;Killer on Campus&quot; and &quot;Prisoner of Deceit&quot; and guest-starred in an episode of the western series &quot;Sara&quot; in 1976. He played Woody Billingsley in &quot;The Love Boat&quot; S2 E16 sketch &quot;Like Father, Like Son&quot; which aired 1/26/1979.

He played Mr. Kirby in the 1979 NBC television adaptation of &quot;You Can&#x27;t Take it With You&quot; and the ineffective but well-meaning Colonel Fielding on the 1981 TV adaptation of &quot;Private Benjamin&quot;. He also had roles in two movies in 1982, as school principal Walter J. Coolidge in &quot;Zapped!&quot; and Senator Charles Wingwood in &quot;The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas&quot;. In 1982 he also played Henry&#x27;s older brother Bill Rush in &quot;Too Close for Comfort.&quot;

In 1984–85, he played James Bradford on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; opposite John Ritter, and in 1986 he was Peace Corps member Dr. Bruce Gaines, who married Mrs. Garrett (played by Charlotte Rae) in her final episodes on &quot;The Facts of Life&quot;. He appeared as Steven in the 1990 episode of &quot;The Golden Girls&quot; entitled &quot;Great Expectations&quot;. In 1991, he reunited with Katherine Helmond for two episodes of her next series, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;.

In 1993, he played the Cardassian character Kotan Pa&#x27;Dar in the &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; episode &quot;Cardassians&quot;, and had a role on &quot;Married... with Children&quot; in the episode &quot;The D&#x27;Arcy Files&quot; (1994). His return to serials included the roles of Maxwell Hammer, a friend of Minx, on &quot;Santa Barbara&quot; (1990), Mr. Jonesy (alongside Louise Sorel) on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from 1997 to 1998, and guest-starring as a judge on &quot;General Hospital&quot; in early 2006.

He appeared onstage throughout his career. Aside from &quot;Applause&quot;, he starred in the pre-Broadway version of the 1990s revival of &quot;How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying&quot; as J.B. Biggley, he played Andrew Wyke in several touring company productions of the Anthony Shaffer mystery, &quot;Sleuth&quot;, and he was in the 2002 production of &quot;A Twilight Romance&quot; at the Falcon Theatre in Burbank, California.

Mandan was a frequent special guest on &quot;The $25,000 Pyramid&quot; during the 1980s. He also appeared on many other game shows, including &quot;Match Game&quot;, &quot;Family Feud&quot;, &quot;Super Password&quot;, &quot;Chain Reaction&quot;, and &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot;.

==Death==
Mandan died in Los Angeles on April 29, 2018, following a long battle with cancer. He was survived by his wife, Sherry Dixon, a licensed primal psychotherapist; the couple wed in 1963. Upon his death, he was cremated.

<text>The Carrera Panamericana was a border-to-border sedan (stock and touring and sports car) rally racing event on open roads in Mexico similar to the Mille Miglia and Targa Florio in Italy. Running for five consecutive years from 1950 to 1954, it was widely held by contemporaries to be the most dangerous race of any type in the world. It has since been resurrected along some of the original course as a classic speed rally.

==Original==

=== 1950 ===

After the 2,178 mile (3,507 kilometer) north-south Mexican section of the Pan-American Highway was completed in 1950, a nine-stage, five-day race across the country was organized by the national government to celebrate its achievement and attract international business. The 1950 race ran almost entirely along the new roadway.

The first of five annual races began on May 5, 1950, and was entered by racers from all over the world representing virtually every motor sport: Formula One, sports cars, rallying, stock cars, endurance racing, hill climbing, and drag racing. Because it started at the border with Texas, it was especially attractive to all types of American race drivers from Indy cars to NASCAR. Bill France, the founder of NASCAR, was there for the first race as well as later races. The Mexican government&#x27;s representatives worked closely with the American Automobile Association and other motor sports groups in the United States to organize and promote the event which was limited to stock sedans with five seats. Piero Taruffi and Felice Bonetto, both Italian F1 drivers, entered a pair of Alfa Romeo coupes specially constructed for the event. However, many of the 132 competitors were ordinary unsponsored citizens from the United States, Mexico, and elsewhere. The entrants included nine women drivers.

The first race ran from north to south beginning in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, across the international border from El Paso, Texas, and finishing in Ciudad Cuauhtémoc, Chiapas (formerly known as El Ocotal) on the Guatemala-Mexico border opposite from La Mesilla, Guatemala. The event comprised nine &quot;legs&quot; or stage. At least one leg was run each day for five consecutive days. The elevation changes were significant: from to above sea level, requiring among other modifications the rejetting of carburetors to cope with thinner air. Most of the race was run between and .

The first four places were won by American cars and American drivers. The winner, Hershel McGriff, drove an Oldsmobile 88 at an average speed of . The car cost McGriff and his partners only $1,900, when the winner&#x27;s purse was 150,000 pesos (around $17,200 U.S. dollars). Though less powerful than its big Lincoln and Cadillac competitors, the car was substantially lighter. This meant that it would eventually pull away from them on the steep, winding course. The car&#x27;s light weight gave it another advantage: it was much easier to stop, meaning that McGriff finished the race on his original brake shoes when the big cars were re-shoeing every night. This was important because neither McGriff nor his co-driver were capable of even basic car maintenance. McGriff also noted that the control afforded by his manual gearbox gave him a significant advantage the last day on the gravel roads in Chiapas, when he finally passed the Cadillac leading the race. The final miles to the finish were run without oil due to bottoming out the oil pans leaving the engine smoking and rattling to the checkered flag. The best placed European car was an Alfa Romeo sedan driven by Italian driver, Felice Bonetto. The race, however, set its bloody and dangerous reputation right from the start: 4 people (3 competitors, 1 spectator) were killed during this event.

=== 1951 ===
The following year, the race was run from south to north, starting in Tuxtla Gutiérrez, Chiapas on the Mexican/Guatemalan border and finishing in Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua on the Mexican/U.S. Texas border near El Paso. This was changed from the previous event because of the lack of accommodation available for race officials, drivers, crews and press in El Ocotal and the jungle. This northerly direction also allowed the U.S. drivers to finish at their border. The race was moved from early May to late November to avoid the hot and rainy weather at that time of year in Mexico and to give the European teams a chance to compete during what was normally their off-season. For the first time, a European manufacturer entered a &#x27;factory&#x27; team, Ferrari entering several cars including a 212 Export LWB Vignale. Although the Ferrari entries did not technically satisfy the requirements of the touring car category, the Italians were permitted to compete anyway.

The race would prove to exact a heavy toll upon drivers. During the first stage, José Estrada and Miguel González died after their 1951 Packard left the road and fell into a ravine. Estrada was an experienced racer and car dealer, who had announced at the start of the race: &quot;I will win, or die trying.&quot; The next day Italian driver Carlos Panini also died after an accident. Panini was a pioneer of Mexican aviation who established Mexico&#x27;s first scheduled airline in 1927. He is credited with being the first pilot to fly a light plane around the world. The fatal accident occurred on the second day, during the second stage from Oaxaca to Puebla. Although the registered driver for the race was Carlos&#x27; daughter Teresa, he was at the wheel of a 1949 Alfa Romeo 6C 2500 SS despite poor health and not having a valid license. The accident happened while a young Bobby Unser was trying to overtake Panini in a Jaguar, as Unser related in his book &quot;Winners Are Driven: A Champion&#x27;s Guide to Success in Business &amp; Life&quot;:

Ricardo Ramírez of Mexico City abandoned the race to rush the Paninis to a hospital in Puebla, but Señor Panini was announced dead on arrival. His daughter survived with minor injuries. The deaths of Panini and Estrada resulted in denunciations of the race by Mexico City&#x27;s &quot;El Universal&quot; newspaper, who called the race a &quot;crime&quot;, and by a government official who stated the race was &quot;an imitation of North American customs not suited to Mexican characteristics.&quot; 4 people were killed during this edition of the Carrera Panamericana: in addition to Panini, Estrada and González&#x27;s deaths, the mayor of Oaxaca, Lorenzo Mayoral Lemus, lost his life during a run of the first stage between the cities of Tuxtla Gutiérrez and Oaxaca. His car went off a mountain road and he died in a hospital in Oaxaca.

First and second places were won by the works Ferraris 212 Inters driven by Piero Taruffi and Alberto Ascari, third and fourth by ordinary American cars. Bill Sterling, a salesman from El Paso, Texas, placed third in a Chrysler Saratoga entered by Carl Kiekhaefer of the Mercury Marine boat motor manufacturer, and well-known race car driver Troy Ruttman followed him in a flat-head V8 Mercury Eight he reportedly had bought for $1,000 in a used car lot in El Monte, California yet bested several factory Lancias and Ferraris.

=== 1952 ===

In 1952 the organizers of Carrera Panamericana divided what had been a single class into Sports Car and Stock Car entries so heavy American sedans did not have to compete directly with nimble European sports cars. The major automobile manufacturers had taken notice of the race and Mercedes-Benz sent a highly organized team of drivers, mechanics, and 300 SLs. Karl Kling and Herman Lang finished first and second, and a 1-2-3 finish may have been the final result had American John Fitch not been disqualified for permitting a mechanic to touch his car on the second to last day. American Chuck Stevenson won the touring car class in a Lincoln Capri, his first of two consecutive victories in the event.
The Mercedes-Benz W194 of Kling and Hans Klenk won despite the car being hit by a vulture in the windscreen. During a long right-hand bend in the opening stage taken at almost , Kling failed to spot vultures sitting by the side of the road. As the birds scattered at the roar of the virtually unsilenced 300 SL, one impacted through the windscreen on the passenger side, briefly knocking co-driver and navigator Klenk unconscious. Despite bleeding badly from facial injuries caused by the shattered windscreen, Klenk ordered Kling to maintain speed, and held on until a tire change almost later to clean himself and the car up. For extra protection, eight vertical steel bars were bolted over the new windscreen. Kling and Klenk also discussed the species and size of the dead bird, agreeing that had had a minimum wingspan and weighed as much as five fattened geese.

Klenk used pre-prepared &#x27;pace-notes&#x27; to identify and communicate upcoming road bends in rapid shorthand to Kling. This system proved so effective that it is used in all motor sports involving a navigator today, such as stage rallying. The highly organized Lincoln teams also used a similar system. Only one person was killed in this event, Santos Letona of Puebla, Mexico, who died in a crash near the town of Texmelucan on the third stage between there and Mexico City.

=== 1953 ===

In 1953 the Sports and Stock classes were both subdivided into Large and Small groups, giving four categories in which to compete. These were split by engine cubic capacity; sports cars under and over 1600 cc were Small and Large respectively, and stock cars under and over 3500 cc likewise. This was to accommodate the huge number of participants and the diverse breeds of cars within the race. This race, like the subsequent running of the Carrera Panamericana was to be the last round of the 1953 World Sportscar Championship season.

Both Lincoln and Lancia came to the race highly organized and both factories swept 1-2-3 finishes in their respective categories. The Mercedes team did not return because of its focus on Formula One. The Europeans dominated the sports categories, and the Americans the stock. Large Sports Cars was won by Juan Manuel Fangio of Argentina in a Lancia, Small Sports Cars by José Herrarte from Guatemala in a Porsche. Large Stock Cars was won by Chuck Stevenson of the United States in a Lincoln and Small Stock Cars by C.D. Evans (again of the U.S.) in an ordinary six cylinder Chevrolet. Stevenson has the distinction of being the only person to ever win twice in the same category in the original race.

However, the race was marred by the death of a number of competitors. The co-driver and pacenote systems championed by the Mercedes teams of the previous year were vindicated by the failure of an alternative contemporary system used by some other works drivers, notably those of Lancia who in 1953 year had entered five cars; three 3.3-litre D24s for Felice Bonetto, Juan Manuel Fangio and Piero Taruffi, winner of the 1951 edition of the race, and two 3-litre versions for Giovanni Bracco and Eugenio Castellotti. During pre-race runs of the route at much safer speeds, Bonetto and Taruffi painted warning signals on the road to remind themselves of particular hazards. As the D24 was both open and single-seat, there was no co-driver. This resulted in the death of Bonetto who, leading the race under pressure from Taruffi, missed his own warning signs. Entering the village of Silao, he encountered a dip in the pavement at excessive speed and impacted a building, killing him instantly.

The 1953 running was the bloodiest year of the Carrera Panamericana. In addition to Bonetto&#x27;s death- 8 other people were killed in unrelated accidents, including an incident where 6 spectators were killed by a flipping car. On the first stage between the cities of Tuxtla Gutiérrez and Oaxaca, American Bob Christie, with his mechanic Kenneth Wood, failed to make a left turn, and his Ford went off the road backwards. The car plunged over the embankment on the side and came to a cushioned but smashing stop upside down in the mud of the river bank, below the level of the highway. Christie unfastened his belts and helped &quot;K&quot; to reach the bank. A fairly large crowd of spectators hastily assembled on a ledge below the road to find a better view of the accident. Many of these spectators swarmed to Christie&#x27;s and Wood&#x27;s aid immediately and were relieved to find out that both were uninjured. But then, Mickey Thompson, a Bonneville Salt Flats record holder, crashed at the same place after his brakes jammed. Thomson&#x27;s car went straight into the embankment and killed 6 people who were standing there to get a better view of Christie&#x27;s accident. In addition to this horrific tragedy, Italians Antonio Stagnoli and his co-driver Giuseppe Scotuzzi in a Ferrari 375 MM lost their lives when a blown tyre caused them to crash in the small town of Juchitán de Zaragoza on that same first stage between Tuxtla Guitierrez and Oaxaca. Of the 9 fatalities in this running of this most famous Mexican road races, 8 of them were on the same stage on the same day. The exception was Bonetto&#x27;s accident, which happened on the fourth stage.

=== 1954 ===

By 1954 the race had shifted from a largely amateurish basis to become a highly professional endeavor. The final stage was won by eventual race winner Umberto Maglioli in a Ferrari 375 Plus at an average speed of over the stage. Maglioli would win this race with a combined time of 17 hours and 40 minutes. In comparison, McGriff had won the 1950 race with a combined time of 27 hours and 34 minutes, almost ten hours slower than Maglioli. Maglioli was more than an hour faster than Klenk/Kling in their Mercedes W194 2 years earlier. Even with the route shortened by 160 km (100 mi) for 1951 onwards, speeds had gone up more than 50 percent over 4 years. Phil Hill won second place in earlier Ferrari 375 MM with Ray Crawford winning the stock car class in a Lincoln. Two new classes were in effect in 1954; the European stock car class was won by Sanesi, of Italy, in an Alfa Romeo and the small U.S. stock car class was won by Tommy Drisdale in a Dodge. Californian hot rod pioneer Ak Miller (born Arkton Moeller in Denmark, not to be confused with A. K. Miller) became famous by winning fifth place in his Oldsmobile powered 1927 Ford body on a 1950 Ford frame, &quot;El Caballo del Hierro&quot; (the iron horse), nicknamed by Mexicans as &quot;El Ensalada&quot; (the salad).

The race, however, lived up to its bloody reputation – seven people were killed during this event: four competitors, two spectators, and one team crew member.

=== Cancellation ===
Due to safety concerns and the expense to the government, the race was cancelled after the 1955 Le Mans disaster, although the President Adolfo Ruiz Cortines announced only that the race&#x27;s original task of publicizing the highway was &#x27;complete&#x27;. 27 people had died during the five years of the Panamericana, giving it one of the highest mortality rates per race in the history of motor sports. Only a third of entrants typically finished the race. Unlike more compact circuits, the long stage sections were impossible to secure entirely, making it possible for crashes to linger for several hours before being noticed. During the years the race was originally held, racing automobile technology and performance advanced quickly and racing speeds almost doubled as a result. Despite the increased speed, safety controls remained static and competitors, spectators and safety control personnel alike became casualties.

== Legacy ==
Despite being abandoned, the race would not be immediately forgotten. Despite their models being small and often quite underpowered (especially with regard to American and other German opponents) Porsche enjoyed some success in the race, mainly class wins. A 550 Spyder won the Small Sports Car category in 1953.

Later, some Porsche road cars were named Carrera after this race (in the same theme as the Targas named after the Targa Florio), and in 2009 the company shipped the Panamera, a 4-door touring car with a name inspired by Panamericana. Similarly, the watchmaker Heuer, then known for its motorsport stopwatches, introduced a chronograph called the &quot;Carrera Panamerica&quot; after the 1953 race, which developed into its long-running &#x27;Carrera&#x27; range.

In the same way, Mercedes-AMG (high performance division of Mercedes-Benz road cars) named a new grille after this race: the Panamericana-Grille can be found on almost all AMG vehicles starting from 2018.

Also, the race saw famous people from different forms of auto racing converge in one event, including:

*Bill France, Sr., Curtis Turner, Red Byron, Raymond Parks and Marshall Teague of stock car racing
*Mickey Thompson, Clay Smith and Ak Miller, famous hot-rodders
*Tony Bettenhausen, Walt Faulkner, Jerry Unser and Bill Vukovich from open wheel &#x27;Indy&#x27; car racing
*Alberto Ascari and Juan Manuel Fangio, Formula One champions at the time; and Phil Hill, who would later be a Formula One champion
*Carroll Shelby, creator of the Shelby Cobra and 1959 24 Hours of Le Mans winner, broke his arm while practicing for the 1954 event
*Dan Gurney and Richie Ginther, American road racers who would one day drive for Ferrari in Formula One
*Jean Trévoux, Robert Manzon, Louis Chiron from France, winners of the 24 Hours of Le Mans as well as major international rallies
*Hermann Lang, Karl Kling and Hans Herrmann from Germany
*Piero Taruffi, Umberto Maglioli and Felice Bonetto, all already famous Italian race drivers.

== Revival ==

The race was resurrected in 1988 by Pedro Dávila, Loyal Truesdale, and Eduardo de León Camargo, and runs a 7-day, route aping some of the original course. It is run with official backing on special closed stages of the public road network and fast transit sections through central Mexico until recently at unlimited speeds approaching . The race is competed by 80 to 100 cars organized into 10 classes, which are differentiated by car age and authenticity; virtually any car with a classic bodyshell is eligible. The bulk of entries are provided by 1950s and &#x27;60s American stock cars; the most popular shapes are the 1953/54 Studebaker Starliner hardtops and Starlight pillared coupes, originally designed by a team led by famed industrial designer Raymond Loewy, because of their exceptional aerodynamics. This is best proven by the fact that as of 2016, out of 29 modern-era races, 22 have been won by Studebakers. Other common European entries include Alfa Romeo Giuliettas, Jaguar E-types, Porsche 356s &amp; 911s. Rarer cars included Saab 96s, Volvo PV544s, and Jaguar MkII saloons. Porsche 911 and classic Ford Mustangs are extremely popular cars.

However, despite the vintage appearance of the cars, often they conceal underpinnings more closely related to modern NASCAR entries. Tuned V8 engines of more than are common, especially in the American cars, and the cars are often created especially for this race and usually ineligible for true vintage events elsewhere. Even less modified cars often have modern disc brakes at all four corners and coolant upgrades to help them survive the punishing course. Six-point roll cages, racing seats, fire-suppression systems, and fuel cells are required in most classes. Drivers and navigators are required to wear two- or three-layer fire-resistant suits, HANS devices, and label their helmets, uniforms, and respective sides of the car with their blood types and allergies.

The above is a clue as to what separates the Panamericana from other modern, re-creations of road races. It remains a true, high-speed race (stage rally) mainly through the mountains, and as such, is extremely dangerous. Mechanical attrition for the more classic cars often leads to burst brake lines and overheated engines, but crashes are also common on the winding roads. In 1999, Bernardo Obregón and his co-driver Alda Arnauda were killed after their Volvo PV544 left the road during the Mil Cumbres mountain stage. In 2006, a 19-year-old co-driver survived a serious head injury that left him in a coma after his Jaguar E-Type Roadster crashed into a pine forest; Rusty Ward, another competitor, rolled a Studebaker from a bridge into a river, having finished the event in a similar fashion the previous year. In 2012 there were two more fatalities, but one was from a heart attack. It is obvious, therefore, that the race should not be classed with road-rallies in the style of the recreated Mille Miglia. However, since 2012 the race cars&#x27; top speed is limited to 144 mph on the closed-road sections, by restricting the engine&#x27;s RPM (engine revolutions per minutes) by a chip in the electric ignition, and additional safety measures have been required.

=== 2006 ===

The 2006 event started in Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico coast, pulling in at Mexico City&#x27;s CP circuit as a curtain raiser for the Champ Car race, and stayed nights at the old colonial cities of Puebla, Querétaro, Morelia, Aguascalientes and Zacatecas, with the finish at Monterrey. It was won by Gabriel Perez and Angelica Fuentes in a yellow 1959 Ford Coupe, the first win for a woman and a first for the &#x27;Turismo Production&#x27; class. Though competed mostly by amateurs, Jo Ramírez of the McLaren F1 team competed a Volvo P1800 amongst other star drivers.

In a retro step, Cadillac entered a replica of the 1954 Series 62 coupe that a Colorado Springs dealer loaned to &quot;five ordinary guys from Chicago&quot;, in order to revive a half-century old duel with Lincoln. The original 1954 team won the last two stages, and finished third in class (a Lincoln Capri won the Large Stock Class). The newer car, built in-house by GM&#x27;s Performance Division Garage, preproduction trim shop and show-car paint department, was built from an identical coupe from somewhere within Cadillac&#x27;s own inventory. The 331-cubic-inch V8 was enlarged to 398-cubic-inches, with higher 10.5:1 compression bringing output to and of torque, and certain safety improvements included. The car was reunited with Blu Plemons, the co-driver of the original (the driver, Keith Anderson, was killed in practice for the 1957 Indy 500) at the starting line. Among the nine other entries in the &quot;Original Pan-Am&quot; class were four Lincolns, including a 1949 model that contested the original Pan-Am.

2006 also saw the debut of a &#x27;modern&#x27; category, with the sole entry of a Lotus Elise (&#x27;Chica Loca&#x27;) run by Rachel Larratt. This class, called Unlimited, allows machines manufactured after 1990 to compete in the race. Controversially, in recognition of the high value of some of the supercars thus allowed to run, organizers of the race foresee the need to allow case-by-case exceptions from the race&#x27;s normal safety equipment rules. The class is intended to raise the race&#x27;s profile beyond a market elderly enough to recall the original four races, to ensure the survival of the event. Also, it is a reflection of the increasing scarcity of eligible vehicles, and of the effect of modern rallies like the Gumball 3000.

=== 2007 ===
The 2007 event, according to Eduardo de León Camargo (President emeritus of La Carrera Panamericana), was the largest recreation to date. More than 100 teams participated in seven days of racing from October 26 to November 1 inclusive, with an additional pre-qualifying stage held outside Oaxaca on Thursday October 25. Cars competed in the usual ten classes along a course starting in Oaxaca. From there, the route led the convoy in day-long sections consecutively between Tehuacán, Puebla, Querétaro, Morelia, Aguascalientes, Zacatecas and Nuevo Laredo.

As the 20th anniversary of the race&#x27;s recreation, 2007 saw Mr. de León gave thanks to the committee which has for 19 years organized the race, and the presence of President of the Mexican Motorsports Federation, José Sánchez Jassen, and President of the Mexican Rally Commission, Rafael Machado. During the conference announcing the route, special mention was reserved for the efforts of Mexican law enforcement in general and of the Highway Patrol in particular, under the command of Comandante Julio Cesar Tovar, and to thank Mexican Federal, State and Municipal authorities for collaborating to ensure smooth running of a challenging project.

<text>The 91st Infantry Division is an infantry division of the United States Army that fought in World War I and World War II. From 1946 until 2008, it was part of the United States Army Reserve. It was briefly inactivated from 2008 until 2010 when it was elevated back to a division size element as the 91st Training Division (Operations).

==World War I==


The 91st Division was constituted by the War Department on 5 August 1917, and was to be organized at Camp Lewis, near Tacoma, Washington, with draftees from California, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington, and Wyoming. Nearly from the outset, the division was nicknamed the &quot;Wild West Division,&quot; and in 1918, it adopted a fir tree as its shoulder sleeve insignia to symbolize its traditional home of the Western United States. On 26 August, Major General Henry Alexander Greene assumed command. During September, organization of the division was begun from a cadre of officers and men of the Regular Army and from Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps and National Army officers from the First Officers Training Camps. From 5-10 September, 2,300 draftees arrived at camp, with 18,000 following from 18-24 September. Systematic training was begun. 

From 3-8 October, the last drafts of 1917 furnished Camp Lewis with 18,000 men, and on 31 October, the division approximated 26,000. During November, 8,000 men were transferred to the 41st Division; between January and June 1918, over 30,000 fresh drafts and transfers arrived at Camp Lewis, but 25,000 men departed. The division received new men, but by March, transfers reduced its strength to less than 20,000. During May and June the division was increased to a strength of 23,000.

In June and July, the division departed for England. In September 1918, the division&#x27;s first operation was in the St. Mihiel Offensive in France. Serving under the U.S. Army&#x27;s V Corps, the division, now commanded by Major General William Johnston Jr., fought in the Meuse-Argonne Offensive and successfully helped to destroy the German First Guard Division and continued to smash through three successive enemy lines. Twelve days before the end of World War I, the division, as part of the VII Corps of the French Sixth Army, helped drive the Germans east across the Escaut River in the Battle of the Lys and the Escaut. The division was awarded separate campaign streamers for its active role in the Lorraine, Meuse-Argonne and Ypres-Lys campaigns.

The division was composed of the following units:
* Headquarters, 91st Division
* 181st Infantry Brigade
** 361st Infantry Regiment
** 362nd Infantry Regiment
** 347th Machine Gun Battalion 
* 182nd Infantry Brigade
** 363rd Infantry Regiment
** 364th Infantry Regiment
** 348th Machine Gun Battalion
* 166th Field Artillery Brigade
** 346th Field Artillery Regiment (75 mm)
** 347th Field Artillery Regiment (4.7&quot;)
** 348th Field Artillery Regiment (155 mm)
** 316th Trench Mortar Battery
* 346th Machine Gun Battalion 
* 316th Engineer Regiment
* 316th Medical Regiment
* 316th Field Signal Battalion
* Headquarters Troop, 91st Division
* 316th Train Headquarters and Military Police
** 316th Ammunition Train
** 316th Supply Train
** 316th Engineer Train
** 316th Sanitary Train
*** 361st, 362nd, 363rd, and 364th Ambulance Companies and Field Hospitals

==Interwar period==

The 91st Division headquarters arrived at the port of Brooklyn, New York, aboard the USS Calamares on 16 April 1919 after 11 months of overseas service and was demobilized on 13 May 1919 at the Presidio of San Francisco, California. The 91st Division was reconstituted in the Organized Reserve on 24 June 1921, allotted to the Ninth Corps Area, and assigned to the XIX Corps. The division was further allotted to the state of California as its home area. The division headquarters was organized in November 1921 in Building 88 at the Presidio of San Francisco. The headquarters was later moved to Building 172 at the Presidio and remained there until activated for World War II. To maintain communications with the officers of the division, the division staff published a newsletter titled “The 91st Division Bulletin.” The newsletter informed the division’s members of such things as when and where the inactive training sessions were to be held, what the division’s summer training quotas were, where the camps were to be held, and which units would be assigned to help conduct the Citizens Military Training Camps (CMTC).

The designated mobilization and training station for the division was Del Monte, California, the location where much of the 91st Division’s training activities occurred in the interwar years. The subordinate infantry regiments of the division held their summer training with the 3rd Division&#x27;s 30th Infantry Regiment at Del Monte. Other units, such as the special troops, artillery, engineers, aviation, medical, and quartermaster, trained at various posts in the Ninth Corps Area, often with the active units of the 3rd Division. For example, the division’s artillery trained at the Presidio of Monterey with the 2nd Battalion, 76th Field Artillery; the 316th Engineer Regiment trained at Fort Lewis with the 6th Engineers; the 316th Medical Regiment trained at the Medical Corps training camp at the Presidio of San Francisco; and the 316th Observation Squadron trained with the 91st Observation Squadron at Crissy Field, California. In addition to the unit training camps, the infantry regiments of the division rotated responsibility to conduct the CMTC training held at Del Monte and the Presidio each year as well. 

On a number of occasions, the division participated in Ninth Corps Area and Fourth Army command post exercises (CPXs) in conjunction with other Regular Army, National Guard, and Organized Reserve units. These training events gave division staff officers’ opportunities to practice the roles they would be expected to perform in the event the division was mobilized. Unlike the Regular and Guard units in the Ninth Corps Area, the 91st Division did not participate in the various Ninth Corps Area maneuvers and the Fourth Army maneuvers of 1937, 1940, and 1941 as an organized unit due to lack of enlisted personnel and equipment. Instead, the officers and a few enlisted reservists were assigned to Regular and Guard units to fill vacant slots and bring the units up to war strength for the exercises. Additionally, some officers were assigned duties as umpires or as support personnel.

==World War II==

As the early battles of World War II involving the United States were being fought, the division was reactivated at Camp White, Oregon, on 15 August 1942, under the command of Major General Charles H. Gerhardt, around a cadre coming for the most part from the 1st Cavalry Division. The enlisted fillers arrived in October and November 1942 from all parts of the United States. After initial training at Camp White, the division participation in one of the major Oregon Maneuver combat exercises in the fall of 1943.

===Order of battle===
Before Organized Reserve infantry divisions were ordered into active military service, they were reorganized on paper as &quot;triangular&quot; divisions under the 1940 tables of organization. The headquarters companies of the two infantry brigades were consolidated into the division&#x27;s cavalry reconnaissance troop, and one infantry regiment was removed by inactivation. The field artillery brigade headquarters and headquarters battery became the headquarters and headquarters battery of the division artillery. Its three field artillery regiments were reorganized into four battalions; one battalion was taken from each of the two 75 mm gun regiments to form two 105 mm howitzer battalions, the brigade&#x27;s ammunition train was reorganized as the third 105 mm howitzer battalion, and the 155 mm howitzer battalion was formed from the 155 mm howitzer regiment. The engineer, medical, and quartermaster regiments were reorganized into battalions. In 1942, divisional quartermaster battalions were split into ordnance light maintenance companies and quartermaster companies, and the division&#x27;s headquarters and military police company, which had previously been a combined unit, was split.

===Combat chronicle===

Major General William G. Livesay being the commander, the division departed for the European Continent on 3 April 1944. There, on the Italian Front, the 361st Regimental Combat Team was detached to participate in the battles for Rome and the Arno River. It became the first formation of the U.S. Fifth Army to reach the river. In September 1944, the division crossed the Sieve River, outflanked the famous Gothic Line, and captured the Futa Pass. Beginning from the middle of April 1945, the division, along with its II Corps sister units, pushed forward against the units of German XIV Panzer Corps as part of Operation Grapeshot.

The division returned to the United States where it was inactivated at Camp Rucker, Alabama, in December 1945.

<text>Sir John Seymour, Knight banneret ( – 21 December 1536) was an English soldier and a courtier who served both Henry VII and Henry VIII. Born into a prominent gentry family, he is best known as the father of Henry VIII&#x27;s third wife, Jane Seymour, and hence grandfather of king Edward VI of England.

==Family==
The Seymours were descendants of an Anglo-Norman family that took its name from St. Maur-sur-Loire in Touraine. William de St. Maur in 1240 held the manors of Penhow and Woundy (now called Undy) in Monmouthshire. William&#x27;s great-grandson, Sir Roger de St. Maur, had two sons: John, whose granddaughter conveyed these manors by marriage into the family of Bowlay of Penhow, who bore the Seymour arms; and Sir Roger (c. 1308 – before 1366), who married Cicely, eldest sister and heir of John de Beauchamp, 3rd Baron Beauchamp. Cicely brought to the Seymours the manor of Hache, Somerset, and her grandson, Roger Seymour, by his marriage with Maud, daughter and heir of Sir William Esturmy, acquired Wulfhall (or Wolf Hall) in the parish of Great Bedwyn in the Savernake Forest, Wiltshire. Sir John Seymour was a great-great-grandson of this Roger Seymour.

Sir John Seymour was born around 1474, the eldest son of John Seymour (c. 1450 – 26 October 1491) of Wulfhall, by his marriage to Elizabeth Darell (or Darrell) (born c. 1451). He married Margery, the daughter of Sir Henry Wentworth of Nettlestead, Suffolk, and his wife Anne Say. Anne was the daughter of Sir John Say and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Lawrence Cheney (or Cheyne) (c.1396–1461) and Elizabeth Cokayne. Margery Wentworth&#x27;s grandfather, Sir Philip Wentworth, had married Mary, daughter of John Clifford, 7th Baron de Clifford, whose mother Elizabeth was daughter of Henry Percy (Hotspur) and great-great-granddaughter of Edward III. Margery was renowned for her beauty as well as her quiet and gentle demeanour, and she came to the attention of the poet John Skelton.

==Career==
Seymour succeeded his father in 1492 and was knighted in the field by Henry VII for his services against the Cornish rebels at Blackheath on 17 June 1497. He was made Knight banneret in 1513. He was present at the sieges of Thérouanne and Tournay in 1513 as well as the two meetings between Henry VIII and Francis I: the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, and again in 1532.

===Offices held===
His offices included:
* Warden, Savernake Forest, Wiltshire October 1491
* Sheriff, Wiltshire 1498–1499, 1507–1508, 1518–19, 1524 – January 1526

==Marriage and issue==

Sir John Seymour married Margery Wentworth (c.1478–18 October 1550) on 22 October 1494. The couple had ten children:
* John Seymour (died 15 July 1510), eldest son and heir apparent who predeceased his father without progeny. His monumental brass survives set into the floor of Great Bedwyn church, inscribed as follows:
::&quot;Here lyeth the body of John Seymour sonne and here of Sr John Seymour, Knight, &amp; of Margery oon of the daughters of Sr Henry Wentworth, Knight, which decessed ye xv day of July the yer of or Lord MVCX on whos soule Jh(es)u have m(er)cy &amp; of yor charitie say a Pater Nost(er) &amp; Ave (Maria)&quot; 
* Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector of Edward VI (c. 1500 – 22 January 1552) married firstly Catherine, daughter of Sir William Filliol and secondly Anne, daughter of Sir Edward Stanhope
* Sir Henry Seymour (1503–1578) married Barbara, daughter of Morgan Wolfe
* Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley (c. 1508 – 20 March 1549) married Catherine Parr, widow of Henry VIII
* John Seymour (died young)
* Anthony Seymour (died c. 1528)
* Jane Seymour, queen Consort of Henry VIII (c. 1509 – 24 October 1537)
* Elizabeth Seymour, Lady Cromwell (c. 1518 – 19 March 1568) through whom Sir John Seymour is an ancestor of actor Danny Dyer
* Margery Seymour (died c. 1528)
* Dorothy Seymour, Lady Smith (c. 1520–1574) married firstly, Sir Clement Smith (c. 1515 – 26 August 1552), MP, of Little Baddow, Essex and secondly, Thomas Leventhorpe of Shingle Hall, Hertfordshire

Of the ten children born at Wulfhall, six survived – three sons: Edward, Henry and Thomas, and three daughters: Jane, Elizabeth and Dorothy. Edward, Thomas, Jane and Elizabeth were courtiers. Edward and Thomas would both be executed during the reign of Edward VI. Henry Seymour, who lacked his brothers&#x27; ambition, lived away from court in relative obscurity.

Seymour also had an illegitimate son: 
* Sir John Seymour (c. 1530 – before August 1599), married in March 1568 Jane or Joan Poyntz, daughter of Sir Nicholas Poyntz and Joan Berkeley.

===Notable children===
Four of the Seymour children achieved prominence at the royal court: Edward, Thomas, Jane and Elizabeth.

Jane Seymour, the eldest surviving daughter, was a maid of honour to Henry&#x27;s first wife, Catherine of Aragon, and later to Anne Boleyn. Henry VIII stayed at Wulfhall with Queen Anne in the summer of 1535 for a few days. In early 1536, Henry declared his love for Jane and began spending increasing amounts of time with her, chaperoned by her brother, Edward. Henry and Jane were formally betrothed the day after Anne Boleyn was arrested and executed on charges of treason, adultery and incest. After Jane became queen on 30 May 1536, her family scaled the social ranks, as was befitting the family of a royal consort.

Her eldest brother, Edward, was made an earl and eventually a duke and briefly ruled England on behalf of his nephew, King Edward VI. Her second brother, Thomas, was made a baron and Lord High Admiral, and in 1547 eloped with Henry VIII&#x27;s widow, Queen Catherine Parr. Both Edward and Thomas were beheaded for treason, a few years apart.

Seymour&#x27;s second daughter, Elizabeth, was first married to Sir Anthony Ughtred (c.1478 – 1534), secondly to Gregory Cromwell (c.1520 – 1551), son of Henry VIII&#x27;s chief minister, Thomas Cromwell, and for a third time to John Paulet, Baron St John (c.1510 – 1576), who succeeded his father as Marquess of Winchester in 1572.
==Death and burial==

Seymour died on 21 December 1536. By royal custom, his daughter Queen Jane did not attend the funeral. He was first buried in the church of Easton Priory, but following the collapse of that building was reburied in 1590 by his grandson, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford, in St Mary&#x27;s Church, Great Bedwyn, the parish church of Wulfhall, where his monument survives. The monument gives his age at death as sixty: 

His eldest son and heir, Edward Seymour, inherited lands producing an income of £275 a year, .

=== Monument, Great Bedwyn ===

His monument in Great Bedwyn church consists of a chest tomb displaying heraldic escutcheons, surmounted by his recumbent effigy, fully dressed in armour with hands in prayer, his head resting on his helm from which projects the sculpted Seymour crest of a pair of wings. His feet rest on a lion, and a sword lies by his side. On the wall above is a tablet inscribed as follows:
&quot;Here lyeth intombed the worthie Sr John Seymour of Wolfhall, Knight, who by Margerie his wyfe, daughter of Sr Henry Wentworthe, Knight, from whome the nowe Lorde Wentworthe is discended, had sixe sonnes and fower daughters, to wete, John who dyed unmaryed; Edwarde, Duke of Somerset, Earl of Hertforde, Vicount Beauchampe and Baron Seymour, uncle to Kinge Edwarde the Sixt, Governor of his Royall Person, Protector of all his Dominions and Subjects, Lorde Treasorer and Earle Marshall of Englande; w[i]ch Duke maryed Anne, daughter of Sr Edwarde Stanhope, Knight, by Elizabeth his wyfe, daughter of Sr Foulke Burgchier, Lorde Filzwaryn [&quot;sic&quot;], from whome the moderne Earles of Bathe are discended; Sr Henry Seymour, Knight, who maried Barbara daughter of Thomas Morgan, Esquier; Thomas Lorde Seymour of Sudeley, Highe Admirall of Englande, who maryed Katherine, Queene of Englande, and wydow to Kinge Henry the Eight. One other Jhon, and Anthony, who dyed in theire infancy. Jane Qveene of Englande, wyfe to Kynge Henry the Eight, and mother to Kynge Edwarde the Sixt; Elizabeth, firste maryed to Sr Henry Ughtred [&quot;sic&quot;], Knight, after to Gregorie, Lorde Cromwell, and last to Jhon Lorde Sainct John of Basinge [&quot;sic&quot;], after Marquesse of Winchester; Margery, who dyed in her infancy, and Dorothe, maryed to Sr Clement Smythe, Knight. This Knight departed this lyfe at LX yeares of age, the XXI day of December, Anno 1536, and was firste buryed at Eston Priorie Churche amongst divers of his auncestors, bothe Seymours and Sturmyes. Howbeit that Churche beinge ruyned, and thereby all theire monumentes either whollie spoyled, or verie much defased duringe the mynoritie of Edwarde, Earle of Hertforde, sonne to the said Duke, the said Earle after, as well for the dutyfull love he beareth to his said grandefather, as for the better contynuans of his memory, did cause his bodie to be removed, and here to be intombed at his own coste and chardge, the laste daye of September, Anno 1590, in the XXXII yeare of the moste happye raigne of our gratious Soveraigne Ladie Queene Elizabeth.&quot;

A transcript was made of the inscriptions of the Seymour monuments by the topographer John Aubrey on his visit to the church in 1672. He also recorded the heraldry on the monument at that date, much of which has been lost.

==Arms==

The arms of Seymour are blazoned &quot;Gules, two wings conjoined in lure or&quot;.

<doc id="856716" wikidata="Q1534188" url="?curid=856716" title="Shampoo (film)">
<text>Shampoo is a 1975 American comedy film directed by Hal Ashby, and starring Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, Goldie Hawn, Lee Grant, Jack Warden, Tony Bill, and Carrie Fisher in her film debut. Co-written by Beatty and Robert Towne, the film follows a promiscuous Los Angeles hairdresser on Election Day 1968, as he juggles his relationships with several women. The film is a satire focusing on the theme of sexual politics and late-1960s sexual and social mores.

==Plot==

On the eve of the 1968 United States presidential election, successful Beverly Hills hairdresser George Roundy meets with Felicia, one of his several clients/sexual partners, at his apartment. During sex, he receives a phone call from Jill, his naive, younger, up-and-coming actress girlfriend, who is suffering a panic attack, paranoid that an intruder is in her home. George rushes from his house to calm Jill, which frustrates Felicia.

George&#x27;s occupation and charisma have provided him the perfect platform from which to meet and have sex with beautiful women, including his current girlfriend. Despite this, 34-year-old George is dissatisfied with his professional life; he is the creative star of the salon in which he works, but has to play second fiddle to Norman, the &quot;nickel-and-diming&quot; mediocre hairdresser who owns the business.

George dreams of setting up his own salon business, but cannot convince any bank to lend him the capital he needs. He seeks out Felicia and her unsuspecting husband Lester to bankroll him. George&#x27;s meeting with Lester supplies a second secret for him to keep from his would-be benefactor; Lester&#x27;s current mistress, Jackie, is George&#x27;s former girlfriend, perhaps the most serious relationship he has ever had. Jackie is also best friends with Jill, making the situation even more complicated.

Jackie arranges for George to style her hair, which he fashions nearly identically to Felicia&#x27;s. Sexual tension arises between the two, and George attempts to kiss Jackie. At first, Jackie rebuffs George, but then kisses him back. They are about to have sex in the bathroom when they hear Lester announce his arrival. As Lester comes into the room, they pretend for his benefit that George is finishing styling Jackie&#x27;s hair.

Lester, who assumes George is gay because of his profession, asks George to escort Jackie to a Republican Party election-night soiree. Upon arriving, George finds himself in the same room as a number of present and former sexual partners, including Jill (who came with Johnny Pope, a film director considering her for a role in his next film) and Felicia. Jackie becomes upset, drinks too much, and behaves outrageously, so Lester asks George to take her home, but she refuses to go.

All the principals except Felicia adjourn to a posh counterculture party at a Beverly Hills mansion, where guests indulge in alcohol, other drugs, and sexual pursuits. Lester, followed moments later by Jill and Johnny, happen upon a couple having vigorous sex in the dark on the kitchen floor. Lester comments admiringly on this tryst to Jill and Johnny, who look on through the window in stunned silence. Suddenly, the refrigerator door George had failed to properly close comes open, illuminating Jackie and him. Lester, shocked, abruptly leaves. An enraged Jill throws a chair, breaking the window, and swears at George. Jackie flees as George tries to placate Jill with an obvious lie, but Jill, unmollified, runs off to spend the night with Johnny.

The following morning Jill confronts George at her home with one of Felicia&#x27;s earrings, which she found in his bed. When she asks about his dalliances, George admits he sought a career in the beauty industry as a means to pursue beautiful women, and that his promiscuity, while making him feel like he will live forever, may mean he does not love her. Upon returning to his home, George is met by Lester and some intimidating men. George and Lester soon find mutual understanding. Lester hypocritically calls Jackie a whore and mentions he is fed up with her. Lester promises George a business deal and he and the men leave.

George subsequently goes to Jackie&#x27;s house, but she worriedly flees in her car, claiming she does not want Lester to find them together. George pursues her on his motorcycle, and the two arrive on a hilltop overlook above her house. George proposes to Jackie, but she tells him it is too late; she has arranged to go to Acapulco with Lester, who has said he will divorce Felicia and marry her. Jackie leaves George alone on the overlook, from where he sadly watches her depart with Lester.

==Cast==
==Analysis==
Film scholar Emanuel Levy describes &quot;Shampoo&quot; as a critique of suburbia, comparing its self-contained Beverly Hills setting to the small towns depicted in films such as &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;The Stepford Wives&quot; (both also released in 1975). He elaborates on the film&#x27;s political themes: 

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack includes songs from its setting of the late 1960s. Included in the party sequence are the Beatles (&quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot;), Buffalo Springfield (&quot;Mr. Soul&quot;), Jefferson Airplane (&quot;Plastic Fantastic Lover&quot; and &quot;Good Shepherd&quot;), and Jimi Hendrix (&quot;Manic Depression&quot;). Also included on the soundtrack album is &quot;Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice&quot; by the Beach Boys, which plays over the opening and closing credits of the film.

==Release==
A screening of &quot;Shampoo&quot; was held in New York City on February 10, 1975. The guests included Warren Beatty, Andy Warhol, Salvador Dali, Amanda Lear, Sylvia Miles, John Fairchild, and Maureen Stapleton.

The film premiered in New York City on February 11, 1975.

==Reception==

Upon its release, the film generally received positive reviews from critics who lauded its talented cast and sharp, satirical writing. Praise was not universal; some critics, including Roger Ebert, pronounced it a disappointment.

Critic Pauline Kael of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; gave the film an overall positive review claiming the film is &quot;a bigger picture in retrospect,&quot; while Walter Goodman of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that &quot;Ashby shows that he has a good memory for a couple of decades of cinematic clichés.&quot; Bob Colacello of &quot;Interview&quot; said that &quot;Shampoo&quot; is &quot;the best movie to come out of New Hollywood yet.&quot;
Commercially, &quot;Shampoo&quot; was a great success. Produced on a budget of $4 million, the film grossed $49,407,734 domestically and $60 million at the worldwide box office. It earned an estimated $23.9 million in North American rentals, making it the third-highest-grossing film of 1975, beaten only by &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

===Accolades===
==Legacy==
From reviews compiled retrospectively, review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gives the film a score of 75% based on 91 reviews, with an average score of 6.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;&quot;Shampoo&quot; trains a darkly comic lens on post-Nixon America, aiming at—and often hitting—an array of timely targets&quot;. The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #47

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released &quot;Shampoo&quot; on DVD in January 2003. On October 16, 2018, The Criterion Collection re-released the film on Blu-ray and DVD in a special edition, featuring a new 4K scan of the original film elements.

&quot;Shampoo&quot; also served as the inspiration for the 1976 exploitation film &quot;Black Shampoo&quot;, directed by Greydon Clark, which is an example of the common blaxploitation filmmaking technique of intentionally piggybacking on the titles of hit films starring predominantly white casts to provide predominantly African American &quot;alternatives&quot; to the earlier films; Clark explained in an interview that his reason for making a blaxploitation film about a black male hairdresser&#x27;s sexual trysts patterned after Ashby&#x27;s film was that Clark did not want to make a film about a pimp, private detective or drug dealer, who were often the protagonists of blaxploitation films.

<doc id="856718" wikidata="Q2040518" url="?curid=856718" title="Keypunch">
<text>A keypunch is a device for precisely punching holes into stiff paper cards at specific locations as determined by keys struck by a human operator. Other devices included here for that same function include the gang punch, the pantograph punch, and the stamp. The term was also used for similar machines used by humans to transcribe data onto punched tape media.

For Jacquard looms, the resulting punched cards were joined together to form a paper tape, called a &quot;chain&quot;, containing a program that, when read by a loom, directed its operation.

For Hollerith machines and other unit record machines the resulting punched cards contained data to be processed by those machines. For computers equipped with a punched card input/output device the resulting punched cards were either data or programs directing the computer&#x27;s operation.

Early Hollerith keypunches were manual devices. Later keypunches were electromechanical devices which combined several functions in one unit. These often resembled small desks with keyboards similar to those on typewriters and were equipped with hoppers for blank cards and stackers for punched cards. Some keypunch models could print, at the top of a column, the character represented by the hole(s) punched in that column. The small pieces punched out by a keypunch fell into a &quot;chad&quot; &quot;box&quot;, or (at IBM) &quot;chip box&quot;, or &quot;bit bucket&quot;.

In many data processing applications, the punched cards were verified by keying exactly the same data a second time, checking to see if the second keying and the punched data were the same (known as two pass verification). There was a great demand for keypunch operators, usually women, who worked full-time on keypunch and verifier machines, often in large keypunch departments with dozens or hundreds of other operators, all performing data input.
In the 1950s, Remington Rand introduced the UNITYPER, which enabled data entry directly to magnetic tape for UNIVAC systems. Mohawk Data Sciences subsequently produced an improved magnetic tape encoder in 1965, which was somewhat successfully marketed as a keypunch replacement. The rise of microprocessors and inexpensive computer terminals led to the development of additional key-to-tape and key-to-disk systems from smaller companies such as Inforex and Pertec.

Keypunches and punched cards were still commonly used for both data and program entry through the 1970s but were rapidly made obsolete by changes in the entry paradigm and by the availability of inexpensive CRT computer terminals. Eliminating the step of transferring punched cards to tape or disk (with the added benefit of saving the cost of the cards themselves) allowed for improved checking and correction during the entry process. The development of video display terminals, interactive timeshared systems and, later, personal computers allowed those who originated the data or program to enter it directly instead of writing it on forms to be entered by keypunch operators.

==Stamping Jacquard cards, 1801 through 1890==
Jacquard cards were said to be stamped or cut, rather than punched. The first Jacquard cards were stamped by hand, sometimes using a guide plate. An improvement involved placing the card between two perforated metal plates, hinged together, inserting punches according to the desired pattern, and then passing the assembly through a press to cut the card. These essentially manual processes were later replaced by machines. &#x27;Piano machines,&#x27; so named for their keys, operated by keyboards and comparable in function to unit record keypunches, became the most common.

==Hollerith and IBM keypunches, 1890 through 1930s==
 Herman Hollerith&#x27;s first device for punching cards from the 1890s was &quot;...any ordinary ticket punch, cutting a round hole 3/16 of an inch in diameter&quot;. Use of such a punch was facilitated by placing the holes to be used near the edges of the card. Hollerith soon developed a more accurate and simpler to use Keyboard Punch, using a pantograph to link a punch mechanism to a guide pointer that an operator would place over the appropriate mark in a 12 by 20 matrix to line up a manual punch over the correct hole in one of 20 columns.

In 1901 Hollerith patented a mechanism where an operator pressed one of 12 keys to punch a hole, with the card automatically advancing to the next column. This first-generation Type 001 keypunch used 45 columns and round holes. In 1923 The Tabulating Machine Company introduced the first electric keypunch, the Type 011 Electric Keypunch, a similar looking device where each key closed an electrical contact that activated a solenoid which punched the hole. The 80 column punched card format was introduced in 1928. Later Hollerith keypunches included the Type 016 Motor-Driven Electric Duplicating Keypunch (1929), the Type 31 Alphabetical Duplicating Punch (1933), and the Type 32 Alphabetical Printing Punch (1933).

&quot;Alphabetical duplicating keypunches recorded alphabetic information in tabulating cards so that complete words and names, together with numerical data, could be later printed by an alphabetical accounting machine. The Type 31 Alphabetical Duplicating Punch was introduced by IBM in 1933, and it automatically ejected one card and fed another in 0.65 second. These machines were equipped with separate alphabetical and numerical keyboards. The alphabetical keyboard was similar to a conventional manual typewriter except that the shift, tab, backspace and character keys were eliminated, and a skip, release, stacker and &#x27;1&#x27; key were provided.&quot; – IBM Archives

==Post-WW II IBM keypunches and verifiers for 80-column cards==

Most IBM keypunch and verifiers used a common electrical/mechanical design in their keyboards to encode the mechanical keystrokes. As a key was depressed, a link on the keystem tripped a corresponding set of bails at the top of the keyboard assembly. The bails in turn made (closed) contacts to encode the characters electrically. As each key stroke was detected by the machine, a feed-back circuit energized a pair of magnets with a bail which restored the keystem mechanically, reset the bails performing the electrical encoding, and gave the &quot;feel&quot; and sound to the operator of a completed action. Each machine had a tendency to develop a &quot;feel&quot; of its own based on several variables such as the amount of wear, dirt, and clearance of the bail contacts within the keyboard, as well as factors in the base machine. The keyboards, however, had no provision for adjusting the &quot;feel&quot; other than the correct adjustment of the contacts on the restore bail contacts and the encoding bail contacts. Special function keys such as shift, release, duplication and others, had only electrical contacts under their stems, with no mechanical linkage to the bail assembly for encoding.

IBM keypunches such as the 024, 026, and 029 provided for the mounting of a program card that controlled various functions, such as tabbing and automatic duplication of fields from the previous card. The later 129 used electronic circuit cards to store simple programs written by the keypunch operator.

===IBM 024, 026 Card Punches ===
The IBM 024 Card Punch and IBM 026 Printing Card Punch were announced in 1949. They were almost identical, with the exception of the printing mechanism. The heart of the 024 and 026 keypunches was a set of twelve precision punches, one per card row, each with an actuator of relatively high power. Punch cards were stepped across the punch one column at a time, and the appropriate punches were activated to create the holes, resulting in a distinctive &quot;chunk, chunk&quot; sound as columns were punched. Both machines could process 51-, 60-, 66-, and 80-column cards.

The 026 could print the punched character above each column. By 1964 there were ten versions with slightly different character sets. The scientific versions printed parentheses, equal sign and plus sign in place of four less frequently used characters in the commercial character sets.

Logic consisted of diodes, 25L6 vacuum tubes and relays. The tube circuits used 150VDC, but this voltage was only used to operate the punch-clutch magnet. Most other circuits used 48VDC.

Characters were printed using a 5 × 7 dot matrix array of wires; the device from which it derived the shape of the character was a metal plate, called the &quot;code plate,&quot; with space for 1960 pins (35 pins times 56 printable characters). If the dot was not to be printed in a given character, the pin was machined off. By correctly positioning the plate and pressing it against one end of the array of printing wires, only the correct wires were pressed against the ribbon and then the punched card. (This printer mechanism was generally considered by IBM Customer Engineers to be difficult to repair. One of the most common problems was wires breaking in the tightly curved narrow tube between the code plate and the ribbon—extracting the fragments and replacing the bundle of 35 wires was very tedious). The printing mechanism was prone to be damaged if a user attempted to duplicate &quot;binary&quot; cards with non-standard punch patterns. These could cause the code-plate positioning mechanism to try to shift the plate beyond its intended range of motion, sometimes causing damage. Turning off printing did not actually prevent the damage, as many people assumed, because the code-plate mechanism remained engaged with the punch unit and shifted the code plate. Turning off printing only suppressed pressing the printing pins into the ribbon and card.

Raymond Loewy, industrial designer of &quot;streamlined&quot; motifs who also designed railway passenger cars of the 1930s and 1940s, did the award-winning external design of the 026/024 Card Punches for IBM. Their heavy steel construction and rounded corners indeed echo the industrial Art Deco style.

===IBM 056 Card Verifier===

The IBM 056 was the verifier companion to the 024 Card Punch and 026 Printing Card Punch. The verifier was similar to the 026 keypunch except for a red error lens in the machine cover lower center. The verifier operator entered exactly the same data as the keypunch operator and the verifier machine then checked to see if the punched data matched. Successfully verified cards had a small notch punched on the right hand edge.

The IBM 056 verifier used most of the same mechanical and electrical components as the 024/026 keypunches with the exception of the punch unit and print head. The punch unit had sensing pins in place of the punches. The holes sensed or not sensed would trip a contact bail when the configuration was other than that entered by the verifier operator. This stopped the forward motion of the card, and presented a red error light on the machine cover. The notching mechanism was located in the area occupied by the print mechanism on a 026 printing keypunch. It had a solenoid which drove the notching mechanism, and another that selected the top notch punch or end of card punch.

When an operator keying data to be verified encountered an error, the operator was given a second and third try to re-enter the data that was supposed to be in the field. If the third try was incorrect an error notch was put on the top of the card over the column with the error and the &quot;OK&quot; punch at the end of the card was not enabled. The data on the card could actually be correct, since the verifier operator was just as likely to make an error as the keypunch operator. However, with three tries, the operator was less likely to repeatedly make the same error. Some verifier operators were able to guess the error on the card created by the previous keypunch operator, defeating the purpose of the verify procedure, and thus some machines were altered to allow only one entry and error notched on the second try.

Cards with error notches were re-punched (using an 024 or 026) usually by &quot;duplicating&quot; up to the column in error, then entering the correct data. The duplicating function was accomplished by feeding the card through the punch station without punching it. At the next station sensing pins read the holes present in the original card and transferred the data to the punching station and onto a blank card. Columns with errors were corrected instead of being duplicated. The corrected card was then verified to check the data again and be &quot;OK notched&quot;.

===Typewriter Card Punches===
The first combination of card punch and typewriter, permitting selected text to be typed and punched, was developed by the Powers company in 1925. The IBM 824 Typewriter Card Punch was an IBM 024 where the 024 keyboard was replaced by an IBM electric typewriter. Similarly, the IBM 826 used an IBM 026 Keypunch.

===IBM 029 Card Punch===
Introduced with System/360 in 1964, the 029 had new character codes for parentheses, equal and plus as well as other new symbols used in the EBCDIC code. The IBM 029 was mechanically similar to the IBM 026 and printed the punched character on the top of the card using the same kind of mechanism as the 026, although it used a larger code plate with 2240 printing-pin sites due to the larger set of characters in EBCDIC.

The 029&#x27;s logic consisted of wire contact relays on later models and reed relays and diodes on SMS cards for early ones. The more &quot;advanced&quot; reed relays used at first proved to be less reliable than expected, causing IBM to revert to the older-style wire-contact relay-based design. All ran on 48 volts DC, and did not require the vacuum tubes that were used in the 024/026. A common additional feature made available (at additional cost) was the leading zeros feature (termed &quot;Left-Zero&quot;). This was delivered by an additional set of four SMS cards. The field was programmed for leading zeros using the program card. If it was (say) a six digit field, the operator only had to key in the actual value (for example 73). The feature would then fill the field by punching the leading four zeros, followed by the 73, in effect right justifying the field, thus: 000073.

====IBM 5924 Key Punch====
The IBM 5924 Key Punch was the 029 model T01 attached with a special keyboard in IBM&#x27;s 1971 announcement of the IBM Kanji System, the keypunch operator&#x27;s left hand selecting one of 15 shift keys and the right hand selecting one of 240 Kanji characters for that shift. It introduced the computer processing of Chinese, Japanese and Korean languages that typically used large character sets over 10,000 characters.

===IBM 059 Card Verifier===
The IBM 059 was the Verifier companion to the IBM 029 Card Punch. In design, it differed radically from the earlier 056 verifier, in that it used optical sensing of card holes instead of mechanical sensing pins. This made the 059 much quieter than the 056 (which was often louder than the 024 keypunch). The optical sensors used a single light source, which was distributed to various sites within the machine via fiber-optic lightpipes. Despite the technology, the basic mode of operation remained essentially the same as with the 056.

Ironically, not all verifier operators appreciated the noise reduction. When used in a room also containing 029 keypunch machines, the verifier operators sometimes missed the auditory feedback provided by the loud &quot;thunk&quot; noise emitted by the older 056. Some were known to compensate by hitting the keys harder, sometimes actually wearing out keyboard parts.

===IBM 129 Card Data Recorder===
Introduced with the System/370 in 1971, the IBM 129 was capable of punching, verifying, and use as an auxiliary, on line, 80 column card reader/punch for some computers. A switch on the keyboard console provided the ability to toggle between the punch and verify modes.

The transistorized IBM 129 Card Data Recorder&#x27;s primary advantage over other IBM keypunches was that it featured an electronic 80-column buffer to hold the card image. When using earlier IBM keypunches, a keystroke error required the card to be ejected by pressing the Release and Register keys, the error corrected by pressing the Duplicate key until the error column was reached, typing the correct data for the rest of that card, then pressing the Release key and manually removing the bad card from the output card stacker before it was placed in the deck (this required some practice, but quickly became an automatic action that you no longer had to think about). With the 129, a keystroke error could be erased by pressing the Backspace key and re-keyed. The entire 80-column card was punched automatically, as fast as the mechanism could go, when the Release key was pressed.
Logic was in SLT modules on a swing out, wire-wrapped backplane.

A secondary advantage of the 129 was that the speed of the keying operation was not limited by punching each column at the time of the keystroke.

The 129 could store six programs in its memory, selectable by a rotary switch. Unlike earlier keypunch machines, the program cards were read into memory via the regular card-feed path, and were not wrapped around a &quot;program drum&quot;.

Thanks to its use of electronic memory, the 129 did not have a separate &quot;read station&quot; with a pin-sense unit to enable duplication of data from one card to the next. Instead, duplication was based on the stored image of the previous card. Cards could also be &quot;read-in&quot; through an optical read unit integrated into the punch station.

===Program card===

IBM 024, 026, and 029 keypunches and their companion verifiers, the 056 and 059, could be programmed to a limited extent using a &quot;Program Card&quot;, also known as a drum card. The keypunch or verifier could be programmed to automatically advance to the beginning of each field, default to certain character types within the field, duplicate a field from the previous card, and so on. Program cards were an improvement over the &quot;Skip Bar&quot; used in some earlier keypunches.

The program was encoded on a punched card and could be prepared on any keypunch (a keypunch would operate even if no program card was in place). The program card was wrapped around the program drum, and clamped in place. The drum rotated as the card being punched moved through the punching mechanism. The holes in the program card were sensed by an array of starwheels that would cause levers to rise and fall as the holes in the program card passed beneath the starwheels, activating electrical contacts. The program was encoded in the top six rows [12,11,0,1,2,3]. If the optional &quot;Second Program&quot; feature was installed, another program could be encoded in the bottom six rows [4,5,6,7,8,9]. A switch let the operator select which program to use. The central cover on the keypunch could be tilted open toward the operator and a locking lever released, allowing the program drum to be removed and replaced.

The program card was punched with characters that controlled its function as follows:

Many programming languages, such as FORTRAN, RPG, and the IBM Assembler, coded operations in specific card columns, such as 1, 10, 16, 36, and 72. The program card for such a setup might be coded as:

 1...10...20...30...40...50...60...70...80
 1AAAAAAAA1AAAAA1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA1AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA &amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;&amp;

In this example, if the keypunch operator typed a few characters at the beginning of the card and then pressed the skip key, the keypunch would tab to column 10. When a program code of blank is followed by &quot;Field Definition&quot; (12) (or (4) for program 2), it defines a &quot;Numeric Shift&quot; field. In the example above, columns 72-80 are defined in the program as a Numeric Shift field. In practice, this definition would likely be used for punching a special symbol as a &quot;continuation character&quot; in column 72, and then columns 73-80 could either be punched with a card sequence number or the card could be released at that point, if no further typing was required.

Note: &quot;Field Definition&quot; (12) and &quot;Alphabetic Shift&quot; (1) prints as an A.

If program 2 codes were punched, invalid characters could be generated that the printer did not know how to print, some of which could even damage the printer.

Program cards could automate certain tasks, such as &quot;gang punching&quot;, the insertion of a constant field into each card of a deck of cards. For amusement, program cards could even be set up to play music by gang-punching &quot;noisy&quot; characters (characters represented by many holes, usually special characters) and &quot;quiet&quot; numbers and letters in rhythmic patterns.

==IBM 5496 Data Recorder for 96 column cards==

In 1969, IBM introduced the System/3 family of low-end business computers which featured a new, smaller-sized, 96 column punched card. The IBM 5496 Data Recorder, a keypunch with print and verify functions, and IBM 5486 Card Sorter were made for these 96-column cards.

==Powers, Remington Rand (UNIVAC) keypunches==
Beginning around 1906, an employee of the United States Census Bureau, James Powers, developed the &quot;Powers Keypunch&quot;, which was specific to the census application and had 240 keys. In 1911, Powers formed Powers Accounting Machine Company. That company was taken over by Remington Rand in 1927. Remington Rand&#x27;s UNIVAC division made keypunches for their 90-column cards and similar machines for the IBM 80-column card. Their 90-column keypunches used a mechanical system developed by Remington Rand to avoid IBM patent issues (long before the acquisition of Eckert–Mauchly Computer Corporation). UNIVAC keypunches stored the sequence of characters for an entire card, then punched all its holes in a single pass, which allowed for corrections instead of wasting a card in case of error.

Remington Rand keypunches included: UNIVAC Card Code Punch Type 306-5, 90 Column Alphabetical (Types 306-2, 306-3), 90 Column Numerical (Types 204-2, 204-3), Portable Electric Punch Type 202, Spot Punch Type 301, and the Automatic Verifying Machine Type 313.

The Type 306-2 provided for verification; the cards were passed through the keypunch a second time and keyed again. &quot;The verify-punching of the same cards in the same sequence ... results in the elongation of perforations for correct information. Round perforations indicate incorrect information. Complete and rapid detection of errors is performed mechanically by the Automatic Verifying Machine&quot;

The UNIVAC 1710 Verifying Interpreting Punch was introduced in 1969.

==Keypunch as a verb==
Saying that something would be keypunched (to as a verb), now that the actual device called a keypunch has become obsolete, refers to data entry.

This use of the verb has replaced the former process, described
as &quot;When a key is struck on a keypunch, it prints the character on the top of the card 
but also punches a series of holes that the computer&quot; 
can interpret.&quot;

==Transition to direct data entry==
In the 1950s, Remington Rand introduced the UNITYPER, which enabled data entry directly to magnetic tape for UNIVAC systems. Mohawk Data Sciences subsequently produced an improved magnetic tape encoder in 1965, which was somewhat successfully marketed as a keypunch replacement. In the mid-1970s, the rise of microprocessors and inexpensive computer terminals led to the development of additional key-to-tape and key-to-disk systems from smaller companies such as Inforex and Pertec.

Punched cards were still commonly used for data entry and programming until the mid-1980s. However, eliminating the step of transferring punched cards to tape or disk (with the added benefit of saving the cost of the cards themselves) allowed for improved checking and correction during the data entry process. The development of video display terminals, interactive timeshared systems and, later, personal computers allowed workers who originated the data to enter it directly instead of writing it on forms to be entered by data entry clerks.

<doc id="856724" wikidata="Q2059605" url="?curid=856724" title="Elizabeth Seymour, Lady Cromwell">
<text>Elizabeth Seymour ( – 19 March 1568) was a younger daughter of Sir John Seymour of Wulfhall, Wiltshire and Margery Wentworth. Elizabeth and her sister Jane served in the household of Anne Boleyn, the second wife of Henry VIII. The Seymours rose to prominence after the king&#x27;s attention turned to Jane. In May 1536, Anne Boleyn was accused of treason and adultery, and subsequently executed. On 30 May 1536, eleven days after Anne&#x27;s execution, Henry VIII and Jane were married. Elizabeth was not included in her sister&#x27;s household during her brief reign, although she would serve two of Henry VIII&#x27;s later wives, Anne of Cleves and Catherine Howard. Jane died 24 October 1537, twelve days after giving birth to a healthy son, Edward VI.

Elizabeth lived under four Tudor monarchs (Lady Jane Grey is not included) and was married three times. By July 1530 she had married Sir Anthony Ughtred, Governor of Jersey, who died in 1534. She then married Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell, the son of Thomas Cromwell, chief minister to Henry VIII in 1537; Gregory died in 1551. She married her third and last husband, Sir John Paulet, later Lord St. John, the son of William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester in 1554.

==Seymour family==
The Seymour family took its name from St. Maur-sur-Loire in Touraine. William de St. Maur in 1240 held the manors of Penhow and Woundy (now called Undy in Monmouthshire). William&#x27;s great-grandson, Sir Roger de St. Maur, had two sons: John, whose granddaughter conveyed these manors by marriage into the family of Bowlay of Penhow, who bore the Seymour arms; and Sir Roger ( – Bef. 1366), who married Cicely, eldest sister and heir of John de Beauchamp, 3rd Baron Beauchamp. Cicely brought to the Seymours the manor of Hache, Somerset, and her grandson, Roger Seymour, by his marriage with Maud, daughter and heir of Sir William Esturmy, acquired Wolf Hall in Wiltshire. Elizabeth&#x27;s father, Sir John Seymour, was a great-great-grandson of this Roger Seymour.

Sir John Seymour was born in 1474. He succeeded his father in 1492, was knighted by Henry VII for his services against the Cornish rebels at Blackheath in 1497, and was sheriff of Wiltshire in 1508. He was present at the sieges of Thérouanne and Tournay in 1513, at the two interviews between Henry VIII and Francis I in 1520 and 1532, and died on 21 December 1536.

He married Margery, the daughter of Sir Henry Wentworth of Nettlestead, Suffolk, and his wife Anne Say. Anne was the daughter of Sir John Say and his wife, Elizabeth, daughter of Lawrence Cheney (or Cheyne) ( – 1461) and Elizabeth Cokayne. Margery Wentworth&#x27;s grandfather, Sir Philip Wentworth, had married Mary, daughter of John Clifford, 7th Baron de Clifford, whose mother Elizabeth was daughter of Henry Percy (Hotspur) and great-great-granddaughter of Edward III.

Sir John Seymour (1474 – 21 December 1536), of Wulfhall, Savernake, Wiltshire, and Margery Wentworth ( – ) were married 22 October 1494. The couple had ten children:
* John Seymour (died 15 July 1510)
* Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset, Lord Protector of Edward VI (/1506 – 22 January 1552) married firstly Catherine, daughter of Sir William Fillol, and secondly Anne, daughter of Sir Edward Stanhope.
* Sir Henry Seymour (1503 – 1578) married Barbara, daughter of Morgan Wolfe
* Thomas Seymour, 1st Baron Seymour of Sudeley ( – 20 March 1549) married Catherine Parr, widow of Henry VIII
* John Seymour (died young)
* Anthony Seymour (died )
* Jane Seymour, queen Consort of Henry VIII ( – 24 October 1537)
* Margery Seymour (died )
* Elizabeth Seymour ( – 19 Mar 1568)
* Dorothy Seymour ( – 4 January 1574) married firstly, Sir Clement Smith ( – 26 August 1552) of Little Baddow, Essex and secondly, Thomas Leventhorpe of Shingle Hall, Hertfordshire.

Of the ten children born at Wulfhall, six survived:– three sons: Edward, Henry and Thomas, and three daughters: Jane, Elizabeth and Dorothy. Edward, Thomas, Jane and Elizabeth were courtiers. Edward and Thomas were both executed during the reign of Edward VI. Henry Seymour, who did not share his brothers&#x27; ambition, escaped their fate.

==Early life==
Elizabeth Seymour was born about 1518, probably at Wulfhall. Her letters to Thomas Cromwell and Henry VIII show that she was both intelligent and astute. She was also skilled in needlework. She played a brief but prominent role in the 1530s and 1540s, during the rise to power of her father-in-law, Thomas Cromwell, and her brother, Edward. Elizabeth and her sister, Jane, served in the household of Henry VIII&#x27;s second wife, Anne Boleyn, their second cousin. She married three times and by her first two marriages had seven children. She is best known as the wife of Gregory Cromwell.

==First marriage==

By July 1530 Elizabeth had married, as his second wife, Sir Anthony Ughtred, of Kexby, Yorkshire.

The couple had two children:
* Sir Henry Ughtred, ( – 1599), born at Mont Orgueil, Jersey, married Elizabeth, daughter to John Paulet, Lord St. John and his first wife Elizabeth Willoughby and the widow of Sir William Courtenay. After his wife&#x27;s death in 1576 he appears to have taken a second wife.
* Margery Ughtred, () married William Hungate of Burnby, Yorkshire. They had two sons, William and Leonard.

In January 1531, Henry VIII granted the couple the manors of Lepington and Kexby (Yorkshire), previously held by Cardinal Thomas Wolsey. She was well-placed at court, in the service of Anne Boleyn, to support her husband&#x27;s interests. In August 1532, when the pro-Boleyn Sir Anthony Ughtred was appointed captain and Governor of Jersey, it was almost certainly due to the influence of Anne Boleyn. He served in person, and remained in the post until his death.

On Saturday, 31 May 1533, Lady Ughtred was one of the ladies and gentlewomen attendant on horseback who accompanied Queen Anne Boleyn in a procession from the Tower of London to Westminster Hall.

Sir Anthony Ughtred died 6 October 1534 in Jersey, and was buried in the chapel of St George, in the castle of Mont Orgueil. After her husband&#x27;s death, the young widow returned to England, to serve her mistress and cousin, the queen. Her daughter, Margery was probably born in Kexby, Yorkshire in the same year. Her one-year-old son, Henry, remained on the island for a time, in the care of Helier de Carteret, Bailiff of Jersey.

==The Queen&#x27;s sister==

When Anne Boleyn failed to produce a male heir after almost three years of marriage, the able and ambitious Edward Seymour and his family, gained wealth and power as Jane supplanted Anne in the king&#x27;s affections. In March 1536, Edward was made a gentleman of the privy chamber, and a few days later, he and his wife Anne together with his sister Jane, were lodged at the palace at Greenwich in apartments which the king could reach through a private passage.

In May 1536, accused of treason, incest and plotting the king&#x27;s death, Anne was imprisoned in the Tower, awaiting her trial. Jane Seymour resided with members of her family, first at the home of Sir Nicholas Carew in Surrey and then moved closer to the king, to a house at Chelsea, formerly owned by Thomas More. While the king&#x27;s second wife prepared for her execution, Jane was planning her wedding, &quot;splendidly served by the King&#x27;s cook and other officers&quot; and &quot;most richly dressed&quot;. On 30 May 1536, eleven days after Anne Boleyn&#x27;s execution, Henry VIII and Jane were married. On 5 June, a week after his sister&#x27;s marriage to the king, Edward Seymour was created Viscount Beauchamp. Two days later he received a grant of numerous manors in Wiltshire, including Ambresbury, Easton Priory, Chippenham, and Maiden Bradley. On 7 July he was made governor and captain of Jersey, and in August, chancellor of North Wales. He had livery of his father&#x27;s lands in the following year, was on 30 January granted the manor of Muchelney, Somerset, and on 22 May sworn of the privy council. In the same month he was on the commission appointed to try Lords Darcy and Hussey for their role in the pilgrimage of grace. On 15 October he carried Princess Elizabeth at Edward VI&#x27;s christening, and 18 October was created Earl of Hertford. Thomas Seymour was also made a gentleman of the privy chamber in 1536, and knighted 18 October of the same year. He was made captain of the &quot;Sweepstake&quot; in 1537.

When Henry VIII sought to divorce his first wife, Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn, Jane, who had previously served in Catherine&#x27;s household, had remained loyal to her and her daughter, Mary. Elizabeth and her first husband, Sir Anthony Ughtred had supported Anne Boleyn and benefited from her rise. It is not surprising therefore, that she was not included in the new queen&#x27;s household. There is no evidence that Elizabeth benefited directly from her sister&#x27;s royal status, before the news of a royal pregnancy became public knowledge in 1537. The impending birth of an heir to the throne would dramatically increase her value as a potential bride.

On 18 March 1537, then a young widow of reduced means, residing in York, Elizabeth had written to Thomas Cromwell, then Baron Cromwell, who had previously offered to help her, if she was ever in need. She had hoped to &quot;be holpen to obtain of the king&#x27;s grace to be farmer of one of these abbeys if they fortune to go down ...&quot; Cromwell, probably encouraged by Edward Seymour, proposed instead that she marry his only son and heir, Gregory. By June, it appears that Cromwell&#x27;s offer had been accepted. Arthur Darcy, the son of Thomas Darcy, 1st Baron Darcy de Darcy, assured her that &quot;I would have been glad to have had you likewise, but sure it is, as I said, that some southern lord shall make you forget the North.&quot;

==Second marriage==
On 3 August 1537, Elizabeth married Gregory Cromwell at Mortlake. Edward Seymour, then Viscount Beauchamp wrote to Cromwell on 2 September 1537, to know how he has fared since the writer&#x27;s departure. Wishes Cromwell were with him, when he should have had the best sport with bow, hounds, and hawks and sends commendations to his brother-in-law and sister, adding: &quot;and I pray God to send me by them shortly a nephew.&quot;

The couple had five children:
* Henry Cromwell, 2nd Baron Cromwell, (before 1 March 1538 – 16 December 1592), married Mary, (died 1592), the daughter of John Paulet, Lord St. John and his first wife Elizabeth Willoughby.
* Edward Cromwell, (1539 – ?) died young
* Thomas Cromwell, ( – died between February 1610 and April 1611), married 18 August 1580, Katherine (died before 1 August 1616), daughter of Thomas Gardner of Coxford.
* Katherine Cromwell, ( – ?), probably named after Queen Catherine Howard, married John Strode of Parnham, Dorset
* Frances Cromwell, ( – 7 February 1562), married Richard Strode of Newnham, Devon.
On 12 November, three months after their wedding, Elizabeth and Gregory took part in the queen&#x27;s funeral procession. Jane&#x27;s death on 24 October, after being delivered of the king&#x27;s longed-for son, naturally came as a blow to the Seymour family. It proved to be a setback to Edward Seymour&#x27;s influence. He was described in the following year as &quot;young and wise,&quot; but &quot;of small power&quot;. The death of the queen would have disastrous consequences for Thomas Cromwell.

The couple&#x27;s first child, Henry was born in 1538, shortly before their arrival at Lewes Priory in Sussex, recently acquired by Thomas Cromwell, where they resided until early 1539. Another son, Edward, followed in 1539, who may have been born, at Leeds Castle in Kent.

Gregory Cromwell appears to have been devoted to his wife and children. In December 1539, while in Calais waiting to welcome Henry VIII&#x27;s new bride, Anne of Cleves, he wrote to his wife at Leeds Castle, addressing her as his &quot;loving bedfellow&quot;, describing the arrival of Anne of Cleves, and requesting news &quot;as well of yourself as also my little boys, of whose increase and towardness be you assured I am not a little desirous to be advertised&quot;.
In January 1540, Elizabeth was appointed to the household of the new Queen, Anne of Cleves.

Thomas Cromwell was created Earl of Essex on 17 April, and his son, Gregory assumed the courtesy title of Lord Cromwell In May, Lady Cromwell watched her husband compete in the May Day jousts at the Palace of Westminster and afterwards feasted with the queen and her ladies. Anne of Cleves would not remain as queen for long, however, as the mercurial Henry VIII wanted a divorce.
Thomas Cromwell was at the height of his ascendancy, however his political enemies were gaining ground and his time in power would soon come to an end. He was arrested at a council meeting at 3.00 p.m. on the afternoon of 10 June 1540, accused of treason and heresy, taken to the Tower and his possessions seized. He was condemned without a trial and his sentence was later confirmed by an act of attainder. There are no surviving records of Gregory and Elizabeth&#x27;s whereabouts at this time.

Thomas Cromwell wrote a desperate letter from the tower to the king to plead his innocence and appealed to him to be merciful to his son and the rest of his family. 

Elizabeth also wrote to Henry VIII, to assure him of her loyalty and that of her husband:

This undated letter is placed at the end of July 1540 in Letters and Papers of the Reign of Henry VIII. It was probably written while Thomas Cromwell was imprisoned in the Tower, as Elizabeth refers to her father-in-law, and not her &quot;late&quot; father-in-law. Moreover, it was customary at that time to write &quot;may his soul God pardon&quot; or something similar when referring to someone who had recently died, which she did not do. The letter was almost certainly written on the advice of her brother, Edward.

Thomas Cromwell was beheaded on Tower Hill on 28 July 1540, the same day as the king&#x27;s marriage to Catherine Howard. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the Chapel of St. Peter ad Vincula in the Tower. It is unknown if Gregory and his family were present at his execution or burial.

Gregory and Elizabeth were not implicated, although it would be almost six months before their desperate situation was to be resolved. They had been dependants of Thomas Cromwell, with no home and little income of their own, and would have had to rely on the generosity of family and friends. The king was inclined to be generous and Elizabeth was included in the future queen Catherine Howard&#x27;s household as one of her attendant ladies.

On 18 December 1540, less than five months after his father&#x27;s execution, Gregory Cromwell was created Baron Cromwell by letters patent, and summoned to Parliament as a peer of the realm. This title was a new creation, rather than a restoration of his father&#x27;s forfeited barony. The following February he received a royal grant of lands that had been owned by his late father.

At the coronation of King Edward VI, on 20 February 1547, Elizabeth&#x27;s husband and her brother, Henry were invested as Knights of the Order of the Bath. Her brother, Thomas was found guilty of treason and executed 20 March 1549.

Elizabeth became a widow again upon the death of Gregory Cromwell from sweating sickness in 1551. He died at Launde Abbey 4 July 1551 and was buried three days later in the chapel at Launde. In London, Henry Machyn recorded the events in his diary:
Gregory lies buried under a magnificent monument in the chapel at Launde. The initials &quot;E C&quot; can be seen in the intricate entablature beneath the pediment.

Edward, Duke of Somerset, who had always been a constant source of support to his sister Elizabeth, went to the block 22 January 1552 and his wife remained in the Tower. Since he had been found guilty of the lesser charge of felony, and not for treason, his lands and dignities were not thereby affected; however an act of Parliament was passed on 12 April 1552 declaring them forfeited and confirming his attainder. In May, his four younger daughters were placed in Elizabeth&#x27;s care. She was granted 100 marks for the provision and education of each of her nieces per year, as well as the lease of her minor son&#x27;s house of Launde Abbey, by way of an inducement. However, by October, the arrangement was placing the widow under a considerable strain. On 25 October 1552, she wrote to her friend, Sir William Cecil, of the Privy Council, requesting to be relieved of her troublesome nieces, who did not take her advice &quot;in such good part as my good meaning was, nor according to my expectation in them&quot;. Her husband&#x27;s family were all dead, her own surviving family did not live nearby, and she no longer had the support of her husband or her brother, Edward. She reminded Cecil that she had no near relations who could give her advice. Her pleas fell on deaf ears and her nieces would remain with her until their mother, Anne, Duchess of Somerset, was released from the Tower by Mary I in August 1553.

==Third marriage==
Between 10 March and 24 April 1554, Elizabeth married, as his second wife, Sir John Paulet, later Lord St. John, who outlived her. There were no children by this marriage. Elizabeth&#x27;s two eldest sons married John Paulet&#x27;s daughters. Henry Ughtred married the widowed Elizabeth after 1557 and Henry Cromwell married Mary sometime before 1560. Details of her later life remain obscure, however she and her husband appear in the records from time to time in matters relating to her son, Henry Cromwell&#x27;s minority and suits for the continuation of royal grants at the commencement of each new reign.

==Death==
Elizabeth died 19 March 1568, and was buried on 5 April in St. Mary&#x27;s Church, Basing, Hampshire. John Paulet, Lord St. John married, before 30 September 1568, Winifred, widow of Sir Richard Sackville, and daughter of John Brydges, a former Lord Mayor of London. He succeeded his father as Marquess of Winchester in 1572.

==Portraits==
In 1909 British art historian, Sir Lionel Cust, then Director of the National Portrait Gallery in London, identified a portrait by Hans Holbein the Younger that had belonged to the Cromwell family for centuries as a likeness of Queen Catherine Howard. Inscribed &quot;ETATIS SVÆ 21&quot;, indicating that the sitter was depicted at the age of twenty-one, the portrait has long been associated with Henry VIII&#x27;s young queen, but the lady is now thought to be a member of the Cromwell family.

The portrait shown on this page, dated circa 1535–1540, is exhibited at the Toledo Museum of Art as &quot;Portrait of a Lady, probably a Member of the Cromwell Family&quot;. A sixteenth-century version of the portrait, at Hever Castle in Kent, is exhibited as &quot;Portrait of a Lady, thought to be Catherine Howard&quot;. The National Portrait Gallery exhibits a similar painting, &quot;Unknown woman, formerly known as Catherine Howard&quot;, dating from the late seventeenth century. This would seem to indicate a sitter who was still a connection to be commemorated over a century later.

Art historian Sir Roy Strong, following the lead of Charles Kingsley Adams, noted that both the Toledo portrait and the National Portrait Gallery version appear in the context of a series of portraits of members of the family of the Protector&#x27;s uncle, Sir Oliver Cromwell (–1655), and have provenances linking them with the Cromwell family. He argued that the portrait in the Toledo Museum of Art, &quot;should by rights depict a lady of the Cromwell family aged 21 c.1535–40&quot; and suggested that the lady might be Elizabeth Seymour, wife of Gregory Cromwell, 1st Baron Cromwell, son of Thomas Cromwell, Earl of Essex. He stated that a &quot;dated parallel for costume, notably the distinctive cut of the sleeves, is Holbein&#x27;s &quot;Christina of Denmark&quot; of 1538.&quot; John Rowlands agreed that &quot;the portrait could certainly belong to the period &quot;c&quot;. 1535-40, but the headdress suggests a date towards its end.&quot; Herbert Norris claimed that the sitter is wearing a sleeve which follows a style set by Anne of Cleves, which would date the portrait to after 6 January 1540, when Anne&#x27;s marriage to Henry VIII took place.

It has been suggested that the six fleurs-de-lis on the lady&#x27;s left sleeve in the Holbein portrait at the head of the page reflect the Seymour heraldry. An augmentation of honour was granted to Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp, (later Earl of Hertford and Duke of Somerset), following Henry VIII&#x27;s marriage to Jane Seymour: &quot;Or, on a pile gules between six fleurs-de-lys azure three lions of England&quot;.
Historians Antonia Fraser, Diarmaid MacCulloch and Derek Wilson believe that the portrait depicts Elizabeth Seymour. Antonia Fraser has argued that the sitter is Jane Seymour&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth, the widow of Sir Anthony Ughtred (d. 1534), on the grounds that the lady bears a resemblance to Jane, especially around the nose and chin, and wears widow&#x27;s black. The lady&#x27;s sumptuous black clothing, an indication of wealth and status, did not necessarily signify mourning; her jewellery suggests otherwise. Derek Wilson observed that &quot;In August 1537 Cromwell succeeded in marrying his son, Gregory, to Elizabeth Seymour&quot;, the queen&#x27;s younger sister. He was therefore related by marriage to the king, &quot;an event worth recording for posterity, by a portrait of his daughter-in-law&quot;. According to Hans Holbein&#x27;s most recent biographer, Franny Moyle, &quot;One of the most striking portraits of a woman Holbein ever delivered was of Cromwell&#x27;s daughter-in-law, painted probably in 1539 as she turned twenty-one.&quot;

<doc id="856726" wikidata="Q956164" url="?curid=856726" title="Cass Sunstein">
<text>Cass Robert Sunstein (born September 21, 1954) is an American legal scholar known for his work in constitutional law, administrative law, environmental law, and behavioral economics. He is also &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-selling author of &quot;The World According to Star Wars&quot; (2016) and &quot;Nudge&quot; (2008). He was the administrator of the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs in the Obama administration from 2009 to 2012.

Sunstein serves as the Robert Walmsley University Professor at Harvard Law School. He was previously a professor at the University of Chicago Law School from 1981 to 2008. In 2014, studies of legal publications found Sunstein to be the most frequently cited American legal scholar by a wide margin.

==Early life and education==
Sunstein was born on September 21, 1954, in Waban, Massachusetts, to Marian (née Goodrich), a teacher, and Cass Richard Sunstein, a builder, both Jewish. He has said that as a teenager, he was briefly infatuated with the works of Ayn Rand, &quot;[b]ut after about six weeks of enchantment, her books started to make me sick. Contemptuous toward most of humanity, merciless about human frailty, and constantly hammering on the moral evils of redistribution, they produced a sense of claustrophobia.&quot;

Sunstein graduated from Middlesex School in 1972. He then went to Harvard University, where he was a member of the varsity squash team and an editor of the &quot;Harvard Lampoon.&quot; He graduated in 1975 with a Bachelor of Arts, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;. He then attended Harvard Law School, where he was an executive editor of the &quot;Harvard Civil Rights–Civil Liberties Law Review&quot; and was on the winning team of the Ames Moot Court Competition. He graduated in 1978 with a Juris Doctor, &quot;magna cum laude&quot;.

==Career==
After law school, Sunstein was a law clerk to Justice Benjamin Kaplan of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from 1978 to 1979 and to Justice Thurgood Marshall of the U.S. Supreme Court from 1979 to 1980.

After his clerkships, Sunstein spent one year as an attorney-advisor in the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Office of Legal Counsel. In 1981, he became an assistant professor of law at the University of Chicago Law School (1981–1983), where he also became an assistant professor in the Department of Political Science (1983–1985). In 1985, Sunstein was made a full professor of both political science and law; in 1988, he was named the Karl N. Llewellyn Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science. The university honored him in 1993 with its &quot;distinguished service&quot; accolade, permanently changing his title to Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science. In 2009, Sunstein was described by fellow Chicago professor Douglas G. Baird as a &quot;Chicago person through and through&quot;.

Sunstein was the Samuel Rubin Visiting Professor of Law at Columbia Law School in the fall of 1986 and a visiting professor at Harvard Law School in the spring 1987, winter 2005, and spring 2007 terms. He has taught courses in constitutional law, administrative law, and environmental law, as well as the required first-year course &quot;Elements of the Law&quot;, which was an introduction to legal reasoning, legal theory, and the interdisciplinary study of law, including law and economics. In the fall of 2008, he joined the faculty of Harvard Law School and began serving as the director of its Program on Risk Regulation:

The Program on Risk Regulation will focus on how law and policy deal with the central hazards of the 21st century. Anticipated areas of study include terrorism, climate change, occupational safety, infectious diseases, natural disasters, and other low-probability, high-consequence events. Sunstein plans to rely on significant student involvement in the work of this new program.

On January 7, 2009, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Sunstein would be named to head the White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA). That news generated controversy among progressive legal scholars and environmentalists. Sunstein&#x27;s confirmation was long blocked because of controversy over allegations about his political and academic views. On September 9, 2009, the Senate voted for cloture on Sunstein&#x27;s nomination as Administrator of the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Office of Management and Budget. The motion passed in a 63–35 vote. The Senate confirmed Sunstein on September 10, 2009, in a 57–40 vote.

In his research on risk regulation, Sunstein is known for developing, together with Timur Kuran, the concept of availability cascades, wherein popular discussion of an idea is self-feeding and causes individuals to over weigh its importance.

Sunstein&#x27;s books include &quot;After the Rights Revolution&quot; (1990), &quot;The Partial Constitution&quot; (1993), &quot;Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech&quot; (1993), &quot;Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict&quot; (1996), &quot;Free Markets and Social Justice&quot; (1997), &quot;One Case at a Time&quot; (1999), &quot;Risk and Reason&quot; (2002), &quot;Why Societies Need Dissent&quot; (2003), &quot;Laws of Fear: Beyond the Precautionary Principle&quot; (2005), &quot;Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts Are Wrong for America&quot; (2005), &quot;Are Judges Political? An Empirical Analysis of the Federal Judiciary&quot; (2005), &quot;Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge&quot; (2006), and, co-authored with Richard Thaler, &quot;Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness&quot; (2008).

Sunstein&#x27;s 2006 book, &quot;Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge&quot;, explores methods for aggregating information; it contains discussions of prediction markets, open-source software, and wikis. Sunstein&#x27;s 2004 book, &quot;The Second Bill of Rights: FDR&#x27;s Unfinished Revolution and Why We Need It More than Ever&quot;, advocates the Second Bill of Rights proposed by Franklin D. Roosevelt. Among these rights are a right to an education, a right to a home, a right to health care, and a right to protection against monopolies; Sunstein argues that the Second Bill of Rights has had a large international impact and should be revived in the United States. His 2001 book, &quot;Republic.com&quot;, argued that the Internet may weaken democracy because it allows citizens to isolate themselves within groups that share their own views and experiences, and thus cut themselves off from any information that might challenge their beliefs, a phenomenon known as cyberbalkanization.

Sunstein co-authored &quot;Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness&quot; (Yale University Press, 2008) with economist Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago. &quot;Nudge&quot; discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. Thaler and Sunstein argue that:

People often make poor choices – and look back at them with bafflement! We do this because as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, happiness, and even the planet itself.

The ideas in the book proved popular with politicians such as U.S. President Barack Obama, British Prime Minister David Cameron, and the British Conservative Party in general. The &quot;Nudge&quot; idea has also been criticized. Dr. Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation The King&#x27;s Fund, has said:
We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the &#x27;nudging people&#x27; idea, which are not based on any good evidence and don&#x27;t help people make long-term behavior changes.

Contributing to the anthology &quot;Our American Story&quot; (2019), Sunstein addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative. He cited the concepts of self-government and equal dignity of human beings, but focused in particular on stories: &quot;an emphasis on what happened before and after the firing shots in Concord and the courageous response of the embattled farmers maintains continuity with the historical facts and offers us something on which we can build.&quot;

Sunstein is a contributing editor to &quot;The New Republic&quot; and &quot;The American Prospect&quot; and is a frequent witness before congressional committees. He played an active role in opposing the impeachment of Bill Clinton in 1998.

In recent years, Sunstein has been a guest writer on &quot;The Volokh Conspiracy&quot; blog as well as the blogs of law professors Lawrence Lessig (Harvard) and Jack Balkin (Yale). He is considered so prolific a writer that in 2007, an article in the legal publication &quot;The Green Bag&quot; coined the concept of a &quot;Sunstein number&quot; reflecting degrees of separation between various legal authors and Sunstein, paralleling the Erdős numbers sometimes assigned to mathematician authors.

He is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (elected 1992), the American Law Institute (since 1990), and the American Philosophical Society (elected 2010). He received an Honorary Doctorate from Copenhagen Business School.

In February 2020, he wrote an article for Bloomberg titled &quot;The Cognitive Bias That Makes Us Panic About Coronavirus&quot;. In it he claimed that &quot;A lot more people are more scared than they have any reason to be&quot; and that &quot;Most people in North America and Europe do not need to worry much about the risk of contracting the disease. That&#x27;s true even for people who are traveling to nations such as Italy that have seen outbreaks of the disease.&quot; He attributed the excessive perceived risk to probability neglect. At the time of publication there were 68 confirmed COVID-19 cases in the U.S., including one death, and approximately 1000 new daily cases worldwide, over 300 of which in Europe.

Sunstein joined the Department of Homeland Security in February 2021 as an advisor to the Biden administration on immigration policy.

Together with Daniel Kahneman and Olivier Sibony, Sunstein co-authored &quot;&quot;, which was published in May 2021. Drawing not least upon legal examples, it treats of unwanted variability in human judgments of the same problem, for instance when court judges recommend vastly different sentences for the same crimes. The book looks both at what &#x27;noise in human judgment&#x27; is, how it can be detected and how it can be reduced.

Since 2021, Sunstein has co-taught a class on the United States Supreme Court at Harvard alongside retired Justice Stephen Breyer. 

==Views==
===Legal philosophy===

Sunstein is a proponent of judicial minimalism, arguing that judges should focus primarily on deciding the case at hand, and avoid making sweeping changes to the law or decisions that have broad-reaching effects. Some view him as liberal, despite Sunstein&#x27;s public support for George W. Bush&#x27;s judicial nominees Michael W. McConnell and John G. Roberts, as well as providing strongly maintained theoretical support for the death penalty. Conservative libertarian legal scholar Richard A. Epstein described Sunstein as &quot;one of the more conservative players in the Obama administration.&quot;

Much of his work also brings behavioral economics to bear on law, suggesting that the &quot;rational actor&quot; model will sometimes produce an inadequate understanding of how people will respond to legal intervention.

Sunstein has collaborated with academics who have training in behavioral economics, most notably Daniel Kahneman, Richard Thaler, and Christine M. Jolls, to show how the theoretical assumptions of law and economics should be modified by new empirical findings about how people actually behave. 

According to Sunstein, the interpretation of federal law should be made not by judges but by the beliefs and commitments of the U.S. president and those around him.
&quot;There is no reason to believe that in the face of statutory ambiguity, the meaning of federal law should be settled by the inclinations and predispositions of federal judges. The outcome should instead depend on the commitments and beliefs of the President and those who operate under him,&quot; argued Sunstein.

Sunstein (along with his coauthor Richard Thaler) has elaborated the theory of libertarian paternalism. In arguing for this theory, he counsels thinkers/academics/politicians to embrace the findings of behavioral economics as applied to law, maintaining freedom of choice while also steering peoples&#x27; decisions in directions that will make their lives go better. With Thaler, he coined the term &quot;choice architect.&quot;

===Military commissions===
In 2002, at the height of controversy over Bush&#x27;s creation of military commissions without congressional approval, Sunstein stepped forward to insist, &quot;Under existing law, President George W. Bush has the legal authority to use military commissions&quot; and that &quot;President Bush&#x27;s choice stands on firm legal ground.&quot; Sunstein scorned as &quot;ludicrous&quot; an argument from law professor George P. Fletcher, who believed that the Supreme Court would find Bush&#x27;s military commissions without any legal basis. In 2006, the Supreme Court found the tribunals illegal in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; in a 5–3 vote.

===First Amendment===
In his book &quot;Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech&quot; Sunstein says there is a need to reformulate First Amendment law. He thinks that the current formulation, based on Justice Holmes&#x27; conception of free speech as a marketplace, &quot;disserves the aspirations of those who wrote America&#x27;s founding document.&quot; The purpose of this reformulation would be to &quot;reinvigorate processes of democratic deliberation, by ensuring greater attention to public issues and greater diversity of views.&quot; He is concerned by the present &quot;situation in which like-minded people speak or listen mostly to one another,&quot; and thinks that in &quot;light of astonishing economic and technological changes, we must doubt whether, as interpreted, the constitutional guarantee of free speech is adequately serving democratic goals.&quot; He proposes a &quot;New Deal for speech [that] would draw on Justice Brandeis&#x27; insistence on the role of free speech in promoting political deliberation and citizenship.&quot;

=== Animal rights ===
Some of Sunstein&#x27;s work has addressed the question of animal rights, as he co-authored a book dealing with the subject, has written papers on it, and was an invited speaker at &quot;Facing Animals&quot;, an event at Harvard University described as &quot;a groundbreaking panel on animals in ethics and the law.&quot; &quot;Every reasonable person believes in animal rights,&quot; he says, continuing that &quot;we might conclude that certain practices cannot be defended and should not be allowed to continue, if, in practice, mere regulation will inevitably be insufficient – and if, in practice, mere regulation will ensure that the level of animal suffering will remain very high.&quot;

Sunstein&#x27;s views on animal rights generated controversy when Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.) blocked his appointment to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs by Obama. Chambliss objected to the introduction of &quot;Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions&quot;, a volume edited by Sunstein and his then-companion Martha Nussbaum. On page 11 of the introduction, during a philosophical discussion about whether animals should be thought of as owned by humans, Sunstein notes that personhood need not be conferred upon an animal in order to grant it various legal protections against abuse or cruelty, even including legal standing for suit. For example, under current law, if someone saw their neighbor beating a dog, they cannot sue for animal cruelty because they do not have legal standing to do so. Sunstein suggests that granting standing to animals, actionable by other parties, could decrease animal cruelty by increasing the likelihood that animal abuse will be punished.

=== Taxation ===
Sunstein has argued, &quot;We should celebrate tax day.&quot; Sunstein argues that since government (in the form of police, fire departments, insured banks, and courts) protects and preserves property and liberty, individuals should happily finance it with their tax dollars:
In what sense is the money in our pockets and bank accounts fully &#x27;ours&#x27;? Did we earn it by our own autonomous efforts? Could we have inherited it without the assistance of probate courts? Do we save it without the support of bank regulators? Could we spend it if there were no public officials to coordinate the efforts and pool the resources of the community in which we live? Without taxes, there would be no liberty. Without taxes there would be no property. Without taxes, few of us would have any assets worth defending. [It is] a dim fiction that some people enjoy and exercise their rights without placing any burden whatsoever on the public... There is no liberty without dependency.
Sunstein goes on to say:
If government could not intervene effectively, none of the individual rights to which Americans have become accustomed could be reliably protected... This is why the overused distinction between &quot;negative&quot; and &quot;positive&quot; rights makes little sense. Rights to private property, freedom of speech, immunity from police abuse, contractual liberty, free exercise of religion – just as much as rights to Social Security, Medicare and food stamps – are taxpayer-funded and government-managed social services designed to improve collective and individual well-being.

=== Marriage ===
In &quot;Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness&quot;, Sunstein proposes that government recognition of marriage be discontinued. &quot;Under our proposal, the word marriage would no longer appear in any laws, and marriage licenses would no longer be offered or recognized by any level of government,&quot; argues Sunstein. He continues, &quot;the only legal status states would confer on couples would be a civil union, which would be a domestic partnership agreement between any two people.&quot; He goes on further, &quot;Governments would not be asked to endorse any particular relationships by conferring on them the term marriage,&quot; and refers to state-recognized marriage as an &quot;official license scheme&quot;.
Sunstein addressed the Senate on July 11, 1996, advising against the Defense of Marriage Act.

=== Conspiracy theories and government infiltration ===
Sunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with Adrian Vermeule, titled &quot;Conspiracy Theories&quot;, dealing with the risks and possible government responses to conspiracy theories resulting from &quot;cascades&quot; of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, &quot;The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government&#x27;s antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.&quot; They go on to propose that, &quot;the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups&quot;, where they suggest, among other tactics, &quot;Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.&quot; They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the September 11 attacks as &quot;extremist groups&quot;.
The authors declare that there are five hypothetical responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: &quot;We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. (1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help.&quot; However, the authors advocate that each &quot;instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).&quot;

Sunstein and Vermeule also analyze the practice of recruiting &quot;nongovernmental officials&quot;; they suggest that &quot;government can supply these independent experts with information and perhaps prod them into action from behind the scenes,&quot; further warning that &quot;too close a connection will be self-defeating if it is exposed.&quot; Sunstein and Vermeule argue that the practice of enlisting non-government officials, &quot;might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves. There is a tradeoff between credibility and control, however. The price of credibility is that government cannot be seen to control the independent experts.&quot; This position has been criticized by some commentators who argue that it would violate prohibitions on government propaganda aimed at domestic citizens. Sunstein and Vermeule&#x27;s proposed infiltrations have also been met by sharply critical scholarly responses.

==Personal life==
In the 1980s and early 1990s, Sunstein was married to Lisa Ruddick, whom he met when both were undergraduates at Harvard. She was associate professor of English at the University of Chicago, specializing in British modernism, and is now retired. Their marriage ended in divorce. Their daughter Ellyn is a journalist and photographer. Thereafter, Sunstein dated Martha Nussbaum for almost a decade. Nussbaum is a philosopher, classicist, and professor of law at the University of Chicago.

On July 4, 2008, Sunstein married Samantha Power, a diplomat and government official who would serve as United States ambassador to the United Nations, whom he met when they both worked as campaign advisors to Barack Obama. The wedding took place in the Church of Mary Immaculate, in Lohar, Waterville, Ireland. They have two children: a son (born 2009) and a daughter (born 2012).

Sunstein is an avid amateur squash player who has played against professionals in PSA tournaments and in 2017 was ranked 449th in the world by the Professional Squash Association.

==Honors==
In July 2017, Sunstein was elected a Corresponding Fellow of the British Academy (FBA), the United Kingdom&#x27;s national academy for the humanities and social sciences.

In 2018 he was awarded the Holberg Prize for having &quot;reshaped our understanding of the relationship between the modern regulatory state and constitutional law. He is widely regarded as the leading scholar of administrative law in the U.S., and he is by far the most cited legal scholar in the United States and probably the world.&quot;

<text>The dog whelk, dogwhelk, or Atlantic dogwinkle (&quot;Nucella lapillus&quot;) is a species of predatory sea snail, a carnivorous marine gastropod in the family Muricidae, the rock snails.

&quot;Nucella lapillus&quot; was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Buccinum lapillus&quot; (the basionym).

==Distribution==
This species is found around the coasts of Europe and in the northern west Atlantic coast of North America. It also can be found in estuarine waters along the Atlantic coasts. This species prefers rocky shores, where it eats mussels and acorn barnacles.

==Shell description==
The dog whelk shell is small and rounded with a pointed spire and a short, straight siphonal canal (a groove on the underside of the shell) and a deep anal canal. The overall shell shape varies quite widely according to the degree of exposure to wave action of the shore on which a particular population lives but the body whorl (the largest section of the shell where the majority of the visceral mass is located) is usually around 3/4 of the total length of the shell. The aperture is usually crenulated in mature dog whelks, less often in juveniles.

The shell surface can be fairly smooth interrupted only with growth lines, or when the snail is living in more sheltered areas the shell surface can be somewhat rough and lamellose. The surface is spirally corded. The outer lip is dentate and ridged within. The columella is smooth.

The external shell colour is usually a whitish grey, but can be a wide variety of orange, yellow, brown, black, or banded with any combination of these colours. They can even, occasionally, be green, blue, or pink.

==Ecology==

===Habitat===
The dog whelk lives on rocky shores, and in estuarine conditions. Climatically it lives between the 0 °C and 20 °C isotherms.

=== Effects of the habitat ===
Wave action tends to confine the dog whelk to more sheltered shores, however, this can be counteracted, both by adaptations to tolerate it such as the shell and muscular foot, and by the avoidance of direct exposure to wave action afforded by making use of sheltered microhabitats in rocky crevices. The preferred substrate material of the dog whelk is solid rock and not sand, which adds to its problems at lower levels on the shore where weathering is likely to have reduced the stability of the seabed. Water loss by evaporation has to be tolerated (by means of the operculum which holds water in and prevents its escape as vapour), or avoided (by moving into water or a shaded area).

The peak in dog whelk population density is approximately coincidental with the mid-tidal zone. It lives in the middle shore. In general it can be said that at high vertical heights on the shoreline the dog whelk is most threatened by biotic factors such as predation from birds and interspecific competition for food, but abiotic factors are the primary concern, creating a harsh environment in which it is difficult to survive. At low vertical heights it is biotic factors, such as predation from crabs and intraspecific competition, which cause problems. The upper limit of the range in which the dog whelk is generally found is approximately coincidental with the mean high water neap tide line, and the lower limit of the range is approximately coincidental with the mean low water neap tide line, so that the vast majority of dog whelks are found on the mid-tidal zone.

Tidal pools and comparable microhabitats extend the vertical range of organisms such as the dog whelk as they provide a more constant environment, but they are prone to increased salinity because evaporation concentrates dissolved substances. This can create toxic conditions for many species.

The dog whelk can only survive out of water for a limited period, as it will gradually become desiccated and die if emersed for too long. Metabolic processes within cells take place in solution, and a decrease in water content makes it impossible for the organism to function properly. In experiments it has been shown that 50% of dog whelks die at 40 °C, and it can be assumed that at temperatures lower than this a smaller proportion will be killed off. Furthermore, the dog whelk has to excrete ammonia directly into water, as it does not have the adaptation possessed by many upper shore species which would allow it to produce uric acid for excretion without loss of water. When kept emersed for seven days at a temperature of 18 °C, 100% of dog whelks die, in contrast to many periwinkle species which can lose even more water than the dog whelk (i.e. more than 37% of their total body mass) but survive as a result of their ability to excrete toxic waste products more efficiently.

=== Feeding habits ===
Its adaptations include a modified radula (a toothed chitinous structure) to bore holes in the shells of prey, complemented by an organ on the foot which secretes a shell-softening chemical. When a hole has been formed paralysing chemicals and digestive enzymes are secreted inside the shell to break the soft body down into a &#x27;soup&#x27; which can be sucked out with the proboscis. The plates of barnacles can be pushed apart with the proboscis, and the entire individual is eaten in about a day, although larger animals such as mussels may take up to a week to digest.

Feeding only occurs when conditions are conducive to such an activity, and during these times the dog whelk consumes large quantities of food so that the gut is always kept as full as possible. This allows shelter until more food is required, when foraging resumes. If waves are large or there is an excessive risk of water loss the dog whelk will remain inactive in sheltered locations for long periods.

Mussels have developed a defensive strategy of tethering and immobilising with byssus threads any dog whelks invading their beds, leading to the whelks&#x27; starvation.

&quot;Nucella lapillus&quot;&#x27;s feeding activity is suppressed on brighter moonlight nights, in order to minimize predation risks. High-intensity ALAN levels reversed the pattern. In fact, &quot;N. lapillus&quot; would more likely forage when Artficial Light At Night (ALAN) intensities range from 10 to 50 lx, which are way higher than lunar brightness. This allows dog whelks to easily exclude predation risk. 

=== Life cycle ===
=== Predators ===
Predators of the dog whelk include various species of crabs and birds. Protection against predation from crabs which attempt to pull the soft body out through the shell aperture can be afforded by growing teeth around the edge of the aperture. Many predators cannot smash the strong shell of an adult dog whelk, but juveniles are vulnerable to attack from many predatory species. Eider ducks and various other birds simply swallow the entire body with its shell, while oystercatchers and various crustaceans are often capable of crushing or breaking the shells. In the winter they endure more predation from purple sandpipers and similar wading birds, but in the summer crabs represent a greater threat. In general, the dog whelk can be thought of as being vulnerable to birds when emersed, and to crabs when immersed.

== Human use ==
The dog-whelk can be used to produce red-purple and violet dyes, like its Mediterranean relations the spiny dye-murex &quot;Bolinus brandaris&quot;, the banded dye-murex &quot;Hexaplex trunculus&quot; and the rock-shell &quot;Stramonita haemastoma&quot; which provided the red-purple and violet colours that the Ancient World valued so highly. Bede mentions that in Britain &quot;whelks are abundant, and a beautiful scarlet dye is extracted from them which remains unfaded by sunshine or rain; indeed, the older the cloth, the more beautiful its colour.&quot;

In Ireland, on the island of Inishkea North, Co. Mayo, archaeologists found a whelk-dyeing workshop, dated to the 7th century AD, complete with a small, presumed vat, and a pile of broken-open dog-whelk shells. Unfortunately, no such workshop is known from Britain for the early medieval period. However, a double-checked trace of bromine, indicating the presence of whelk-dye, has been found on one page of an Anglo-Saxon book known as the Barberini Gospels. This manuscript dates to the late 8th or early 9th century AD, and the whelk dye occurs as a background panel to white lettering at the beginning of St John&#x27;s gospel. Efforts have also been made to find whelk dye on surviving fragments of Anglo-Saxon textiles, but the chemical analyses so far carried out have proved negative for bromine.

An Anglo-Saxon account of the accession ceremony of Aldfrith of Northumbria involved whelk-dyed cloth, although this may simply be a poetic echo of Roman ceremonies. Another example involves an account of valuable textiles brought to England by Wilfrid of Ripon.

<text>The list of monarchs of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Sussex (or South Saxons) contains substantial gaps, as the chronological details relating to Sussex during the heptarchy is generally poorly documented. No authentic South Saxon king list or genealogy exists, unlike what can be found for other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Most kings are known only from Anglo-Saxon charters, some of which are forgeries, which makes it difficult to date the reigns of each king. The monarchs were either known as kings or ealdormen.

According to the charters, most kings did not govern alone: Nothhelm reigned with two or three colleagues and Oslac with four. The locations of the lands granted in their charters indicate that they reigned jointly and that there was no division of territory. Such joint reigns can also be demonstrated for the Hwicce, the East Saxons, and the West Saxons. Indeed, “[t]here is nothing remarkable in the existence of two or even more contemporary kings in the same people in the seventh century. The ancient idea that royal dignity was a matter of birth rather than of territorial rule still survived at this date.”

The traditional residence of the South Saxon kings was at Kingsham, once outside the southern walls of Chichester although within its modern boundaries.

<text>A Shot in the Dark is a 1964 comedy film directed by Blake Edwards in Panavision. Produced as a standalone sequel to &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, it is the second installment in the eponymous film series, with Peter Sellers reprising his role as Inspector Jacques Clouseau of the French Sûreté.

Clouseau&#x27;s blundering personality is unchanged, but it was in this film that Sellers began to give him the idiosyncratically exaggerated French accent that was to later become a hallmark of the character. The film also marks the first appearances of Herbert Lom as his long-suffering boss, Commissioner Dreyfus, as well as André Maranne as Dreyfus&#x27;s assistant François and Burt Kwouk as Clouseau&#x27;s stalwart manservant Cato, all three of whom would become series regulars. Elke Sommer portrays the murder suspect, Maria Gambrelli. The character of Gambrelli would return in &quot;Son of the Pink Panther&quot; (1993), this time played by Claudia Cardinale, who appeared as Princess Dala in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963). Graham Stark, who portrays police officer Hercule Lajoy, would reprise this role eighteen years later, in &quot;Trail of the Pink Panther&quot; (1982).

The film was not originally written to include Clouseau, but was an adaptation of a stage play by Harry Kurnitz, which he adapted from a French play &quot;L&#x27;Idiote&quot; by Marcel Achard. The film was released only a year after the first Clouseau film, &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;. It is the first film in the series in which Clouseau could be considered a main character.

== Plot ==
Late at night at the country home of millionaire Benjamin Ballon, several of its occupants are moving about rooms, hiding and spying on others. The household consists of: Ballon&#x27;s wife Dominique; Henri LaFarge, the head butler, and his wife Madame LaFarge, the cook; Miguel Ostos, the head chauffeur; Pierre, the second chauffeur, and his wife Dudu, the head maid; Georges the gardener, and his wife Simone, the second maid; Maria Gambrelli, the third maid; and Maurice, the second butler. The night&#x27;s events soon end with gunshots in the room of Maria, with Miguel found murdered.

Inspector Clouseau of the Sûreté, a blundering and inept detective, arrives on the scene, accompanied by his assistant, Hercule Lajoy. Suspicion is cast upon Maria, as she was found by Maurice clutching the gun that killed the victim. Before Clouseau can investigate further, his superior Commissioner Dreyfus removes him from the investigation out of fear he will bungle a high-profile case.

The following day, while training with his manservant Cato under a strict unplanned arrangement between them, Clouseau is reinstated to head the investigation after Dreyfus is ordered by his superiors to do so, through Ballon&#x27;s political influence. In discussion with his assistant, Hercule about the murder, Clouseau asserts that Maria is innocent despite the evidence against her, but believes she is protecting the real killer who he suspects might be Ballon himself. To keep her under surveillance during the investigation he arranges for her release from prison. However, two more murders occur—Georges in the Ballons&#x27; greenhouse; and Dudu at a nudist camp—with the evidence pointing towards Maria in each case. Despite the facts, Clouseau continues to believe she is innocent, which leaves Dreyfus dismayed at his incompetence in the case and the scandals he causes. After the body of Henri is found in the closet of Maria&#x27;s bedroom, Clouseau is again removed from the case.

Although Dreyfus begins to suspect Ballon is attempting to hide facts about the murders, assuming that he is shielding someone with Maria&#x27;s help, Clouseau&#x27;s theory about her innocence leaves Dreyfus worried that he could be undone. When Dreyfus is again forced to put Clouseau back on the case, he eventually suffers a nervous breakdown upon hearing of Clouseau going out for the evening with Maria. That night, several attempts are made on Clouseau&#x27;s life by a stalker at various establishments, including his apartment, but all of these fail while resulting in the deaths of several innocent bystanders. The increased notoriety of the case as a result of the incidents, coupled with proving Clouseau&#x27;s theory correct, slowly cause Dreyfus to become unhinged.

Clouseau finally decides to confront the entire Ballon household over the murders, hoping to trick the murderer into revealing himself. However, his plan unexpectedly proves Maria innocent in all four murders. Dominique reveals she killed Miguel by mistake, believing he was her husband who she thought was having an affair with Maria; Madame LaFarge murdered Georges, with whom she was having an affair, because he was about to leave her for Dominique; Simone killed Dudu in order to maintain her affair with Pierre; and Ballon murdered Henri because he was having an affair with Dominique. Pierre also reveals that Maurice was blackmailing Ballon. Meanwhile, Dreyfus is revealed to be the stalker targeting Clouseau previously. Dreyfus plants a bomb in Clouseau&#x27;s car in one more attempt to kill him. Clouseau&#x27;s plan comes to its climax when Hercule cuts the house lights in the midst of the chaos. The Ballons, Madame LaFarge, Pierre, Simone, and Maurice flee and attempt to escape in Clouseau&#x27;s car, unaware of the bomb, and the car explodes as they drive off. Believing everyone was innocent, despite what they had confessed to, Dreyfus loses his sanity and is dragged away by Hercule. Clouseau, embracing Maria, finally declares her innocent, but a passionate kiss between them is swiftly interrupted when Cato makes a sneak attack.

== Production ==
Sellers was attached to star in the adaptation of Harry Kurnitz&#x27;s Broadway hit before the release and success of &quot;The Pink Panther&quot;, but was not pleased with the script by Alec Coppel and Norman Krasna. Walter Mirisch approached Blake Edwards and asked him to take over as director of &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; from Anatole Litvak. Edwards declined initially, but eventually relented under pressure on the condition he could rewrite the script, substitute Inspector Clouseau for the lead character, and choreograph comic scenes on the fly as he and Sellers had successfully done for their previous film.

Edwards&#x27; rewritten script bore little resemblance to Kurnitz&#x27;s play, and in response Sellers&#x27;s co-star Walter Matthau quit the film. Sophia Loren also had to quit several days before production began to recover from throat surgery. After Shirley MacLaine turned down the role, Romy Schneider was cast. However, she also had to quit due to her commitments with &quot;Good Neighbor Sam&quot; (1964) and was replaced with Elke Sommer. Sommer used part of her salary to &quot;buy her way out&quot; of a film deal in West Germany and sign a new contract with MGM Studios.

Principal photography began on November 18, 1963, at MGM-British Studios in Borehamwood, England. Shooting also took place in Paris and London. The relationship between Edwards and Sellers deteriorated to such a point that at the conclusion of the film they vowed never to work together again. They eventually reconciled to collaborate successfully four years later on &quot;The Party&quot;, and on three more &quot;Pink Panther&quot; films in the 1970s.

Taking inspiration from his teacher Ed Parker in martial arts, Edwards created the new character Cato Fong using the American Kenpo style. Parker briefly worked alongside Edwards learning more about cinematography and suggested that he implement slow motions at certain fight scenes in order to increase the dramatic effect and make the moves more noticeable for audiences. Following a favorable response from viewers, Edwards continued to use this effect in following Pink Panther films.

As with most of the other Clouseau films, &quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; features an animated opening titles sequence produced by DePatie-Freleng Enterprises utilizing an animated version of Inspector Clouseau. This film and &quot;Inspector Clouseau&quot; are the only Clouseau films not to feature the Pink Panther character in the opening titles. Henry Mancini&#x27;s theme for this film serves as opening theme and incidental music in &quot;The Inspector&quot; cartoon shorts made by DePatie-Freleng from 1965 to 1969. The title song, &quot;The Shadows of Paris&quot;, was written by Henry Mancini. The singer is not credited but contemporary trade reports confirm it was Decca Records recording artist Gina Carroll.

== Reception ==
Bosley Crowther of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;It is mad, but the wonderful dexterity and the air of perpetually buttressed dignity with which Mr. Sellers plays his role make what could quickly be monotonous enjoyable to the end.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; wrote: &quot;Wisdom remains to be seen of projecting a second appearance of the hilariously inept detective so soon after the still-current firstrun showing of &#x27;Panther,&#x27; since some of the spontaneous novelty may have worn off, but the laughs are still there abundantly through imaginative bits of business and a few strike belly proportions.&quot; Philip K. Scheuer of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the film &quot;is all variations of falling down and going boom ... I won&#x27;t say &#x27;ad nauseum&#x27; [&quot;sic&quot;] because Sellers is a clever comedian and never that painful to take. But enough is enough already.&quot; Richard L. Coe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a hardworking comedy,&quot; adding &quot;While the lines are bright and sometimes blue, the real fun comes from sight gags, an old if neglected film ingredient.&quot;

&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote, &quot;Where &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; had style and a certain subtlety, its successor ... can substitute only slapstick of the crudest kind. As the bumbling inspector, Sellers is this time absolutely out of hand, his principal—and endlessly repeated—gag being to fall with a resounding splash into large quantities of water.&quot; John McCarten of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; wrote, &quot;&#x27;A Shot in the Dark&#x27; as done on Broadway was a mediocre comedy, but Blake Edwards, who directed the film and collaborated on the script with William Peter Blatty, had the good sense to toss the foundation stock out the window and let Mr. Sellers run amok ... All in all, extremely jolly.&quot; The movie was one of the 13 most popular films in the UK in 1965.

The film was well received by critics. It has 94% favourable reviews on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes out of 32 reviews counted. The average rating given by critics is 8.1 out of 10. The critical consensus reads: &quot;&quot;A Shot in the Dark&quot; is often regarded as the best of the &quot;Pink Panther&quot; sequels, and Peter Sellers gives a top-notch performance that makes slapstick buffoonery memorable.&quot; In 2006, the film was voted the 38th greatest comedy film of all time in Channel 4&#x27;s 50 Greatest Comedy Films. The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2000: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Laughs – #48
* 2008: AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10:
** Nominated Mystery Film

<text>Arnold Böcklin (16 October 182716 January 1901) was a Swiss Symbolist painter. His five versions of the &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot; inspired works by several late-Romantic composers.

==Biography==
Arnold Böcklin was born in Basel. His father, Christian Frederick Böcklin (b. 1802), was descended from an old family of Schaffhausen, and engaged in the silk trade. His mother, Ursula Lippe, was a native of the same city. Arnold studied at the Düsseldorf academy under Schirmer, and became a friend of Anselm Feuerbach. He is associated with the Düsseldorf school of painting. Schirmer, who recognized in him a student of exceptional promise, sent him to Antwerp and Brussels, where he copied the works of Flemish and Dutch masters. Böcklin then went to Paris, worked at the Louvre, and painted several landscapes.

After serving his time in the army, Böcklin set out for Rome in March 1850. The many sights of Rome were a fresh stimulus to his mind. These new influences brought allegorical and mythological figures into his compositions. In 1856 he returned to Munich, and remained there for four years.

His first fiancée died young. A second woman declined to marry. In Rome, he married Angela Rosa Lorenza Pascucci in 1853. The couple had fourteen children, but five died in childhood and another three died before Böcklin. He himself nearly succumbed to typhoid in 1859.

==Career==
He then exhibited the &quot;Great Park&quot;, one of his earliest works, in which he treated ancient mythology. Of this period are his &quot;Nymph and Satyr&quot;, &quot;Heroic Landscape&quot; (Diana Hunting), both of 1858, and &quot;Sappho&quot; (1859). These works, which were much discussed, together with Lenbach&#x27;s recommendation, gained him appointment as professor at the Weimar academy. He held the office for two years, painting the &quot;Venus and Love&quot;, a &quot;Portrait of Lenbach&quot;, and a &quot;Saint Catherine&quot;.

He returned to Rome from 1862 to 1866, and there gave his fancy and his taste for violent colour free play in his &quot;Portrait of Mme Böcklin&quot;, and in &quot;An Anchorite in the Wilderness&quot; (1863), a &quot;Roman Tavern&quot;, and &quot;Villa on the Seashore&quot; (1864). He returned to Basel in 1866 to finish his frescoes in the gallery, and to paint, besides several portraits, &quot;The Magdalene with Christ&quot; (1868), &quot;Anacreon&#x27;s Muse&quot; (1869), and &quot;A Castle and Warriors&quot; (1871). His &quot;Portrait of Myself&quot;, with Death playing a violin (1872), was painted after his return again to Munich, where he exhibited &quot;Battle of the Centaurs&quot;, &quot;Landscape with Moorish Horsemen&quot; and &quot;A Farm&quot; (1875). From 1876 to 1885 Böcklin was working at Florence, and painted a &quot;Pietà&quot;, &quot;Ulysses and Calypso&quot;, &quot;Prometheus&quot;, and the &quot;Sacred Grove&quot;.

From 1886 to 1892 he settled at Zürich, after which he resided at San Domenico, near Florence. From this period are the &quot;Naiads at Play&quot;, &quot;A Sea Idyll&quot;, and &quot;War&quot;.

Böcklin died on 16 January 1901 in Fiesole. He is buried in the Cimitero degli Allori in the southern suburb of Florence, Italy.

==Symbolism==
Influenced by Romanticism, Böcklin&#x27;s symbolist use of imagery derived from mythology and legend often overlapped with the aesthetic of the Pre-Raphaelites. Many of his paintings are imaginative interpretations of the classical world, or portray mythological subjects in settings involving classical architecture, often allegorically exploring death and mortality in the context of a strange, fantasy world.

Böcklin is best known for his five versions (painted 1880 to 1886) of the &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot;, which partly evokes the English Cemetery, Florence, which was close to his studio and where his baby daughter Maria had been buried. An early version of the painting was commissioned by a Madame Berna, a widow who wanted a painting with a dreamlike atmosphere.

Clement Greenberg wrote in 1947 that Böcklin&#x27;s work &quot;is one of the most consummate expressions of all that is now disliked about the latter half of the nineteenth century.&quot;
==Legacy==

During his lifetime, Böcklin achieved considerable recognition, especially in central Europe, and influenced younger artists such as Hans Thoma. After his death in 1901 his reputation declined rapidly as modern art styles made the literary character of his paintings seem old-fashioned. Despite this, his work was a significant influence on Giorgio de Chirico – who said &quot;Each of Böcklin&#x27;s works is a shock&quot; – and was admired by Surrealist painters such as Max Ernst and Salvador Dalí. A general revival of interest in Böcklin began only in the 1960s.

When asked who was his favorite painter, Marcel Duchamp controversially named Arnold Böcklin as having a major influence on his art. Whether Duchamp was serious in this assertion is still debated.

H. R. Giger created a picture called &quot;Homage à Böcklin&quot;, based upon &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot;.

Museums holding several works by Böcklin include the Kunstmuseum Basel and the Kunsthaus Zürich.

===In music===
Böcklin&#x27;s paintings, especially &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot;, inspired several late-Romantic composers.
* Gustav Mahler&#x27;s song &quot;Des Antonius von Padua Fischpredigt&quot; (St. Anthony&#x27;s Sermon to the Fish) from his &quot;Des Knaben Wunderhorn&quot; song cycle, which also appears as the Scherzo movement in Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 2 (Mahler) was inspired by Böcklin&#x27;s 1892 painting, &quot;St. Anthony Preaching to the Fish&quot;.
*In 1891, Portuguese pianist José Vianna da Motta composed two pieces on Böcklin&#x27;s paintings Meeresidylle and Im Spiel der Wellen.
* Sergei Rachmaninoff (see &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot;) and Heinrich Schulz-Beuthen both composed symphonic poems after it. Rachmaninoff was also inspired by Böcklin&#x27;s painting &quot;Die Heimkehr&quot; (&quot;The Homecoming&quot; or &quot;The Return&quot;) when writing his Prelude in B minor, Op. 32, No. 10.
* Andreas Hallén, a Swedish Romantic composer, wrote a symphonic poem &quot;Die Toteninsel&quot; in 1898.
* In 1903, Austrian, later American, composer Karl Weigl composed a tone poem for piano &quot;Die Toteninsel&quot;.
* In 1913 Max Reger composed a set of &quot;Four Tone Poems after Böcklin&quot; with the movements &quot;Der geigende Eremit&quot;, &quot;Im Spiel der Wellen&quot;, &quot;Die Toteninsel&quot;, and &quot;Bacchanal&quot;.
* In Mark Robson&#x27;s film &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot; (1945), Disney composer Leigh Harline&#x27;s somber score makes use of Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s music.
* Hans Huber&#x27;s second symphony is entitled &quot;Böcklin-Sinfonie&quot;, after the artist and his paintings.
* Felix Woyrsch composed &quot;3 Böcklin Phantasies&quot; (Die Toteninsel, Der Eremit, Im Spiel der Wellen), Op. 53 (1910).
* Fulvio Caldini composed &quot;L&#x27;isola di Böcklin&quot;, his Op.85 for electronic instruments (2001).

===Other===
The Schriftgiesserei Otto Weisert foundry designed an Art Nouveau typeface in 1904 and named it &quot;Arnold Böcklin&quot; in his honor.

Adolf Hitler was fond of Böcklin&#x27;s work, at one time owning 11 of his paintings.

Roger Zelazny&#x27;s novel &quot;Isle of the Dead&quot; features a planet-building character inspired by the painting to create an Isle of the Dead on one of his worlds, and an Ace books edition features a cover painting by Dean Ellis that is deliberately reminiscent of Böcklin&#x27;s work.

Yemelyan Yaroslavsky, Academician of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union, opened his 1942 laudatory article on Dmitry Shostakovich&#x27;s Seventh Symphony with an allusion to Böcklin&#x27;s painting &quot;War&quot;.

<doc id="856745" wikidata="Q132979" url="?curid=856745" title="Caenogastropoda">
<text>Caenogastropoda is a taxonomic subclass of molluscs in the class Gastropoda. It is a large diverse group which are mostly sea snails and other marine gastropod mollusks, but also includes some freshwater snails and some land snails. The subclass is the most diverse and ecologically successful of the gastropods.

Caenogastropoda contains many families of shelled marine molluscs – including the periwinkles, cowries, wentletraps, moon snails, murexes, cone snails and turrids – and constitutes about 60% of all living gastropods.

== Biology ==
The Caenogastropoda exhibit torsion, and thus are included in what was previously called the Streptoneura (meaning &quot;twisted nerves&quot;), also known as Prosobranchia (meaning &quot;gills forward&quot;). Specifically, they are characterized by having only a single auricle in the heart and a single pair of gill leaflets, and are equivalent to the Monotocardia or Pectinibranchia of older authors.


== Taxonomy ==

The taxon Caenogastropoda was first established by Leslie Reginald Cox in 1960 as a superorder but now sometimes it is retained as a clade. Based on optimal phylogenetic analysis, it is deemed monophyletic. This Caenogastropoda combines the older taxa Mesogastropoda and Stenoglossa from the classification by Johannes Thiele and is equivalent to the revised Monotocardia as defined by Mörch in 1865.

Caenogastropoda can be divided into two major groups, based on the anatomy of the radula:
* Taenioglossa (from &quot;taenio&quot; meaning &quot;band&quot;), equivalent to the older Mesogastropoda, with typically seven teeth in each radular row.
* Stenoglossa (from &quot;steno&quot; meaning &quot;narrow&quot;), the Neogastropoda, with only 1–3 teeth per row.

=== 1997 taxonomy ===
Ponder &amp; Lindberg, 1997 and others since (e.g. Vega et al., 2006; Harzhauser, 2004; and Pina, 2002.) show Caenogastropoda as a superorder, following the sense of Cox, 1960. More recently Bouchet &amp; Rocroi, 2005 revised Caenogastropoda as a clade.

=== 2005 taxonomy ===
The following classification was laid out in the taxonomy of Bouchet &amp; Rocroi (2005):
* Caenogastropoda of uncertain systematic position
* an informal group Architaenioglossa
* clade Sorbeoconcha
* clade Hypsogastropoda

=== 2006 taxonomy ===
Colgan et al. (2006) provided further insight into the phylogeny of Caenogastropoda.

=== Latest views by the World Register of Marine Species ===
Sorbeoconcha should include [Cerithioidea + Campaniloidea + all Hypsogastropoda (i.e. the remaining Caenogastropoda)], see definition in Ponder &amp; Lindberg, 1997: 225, not only [Cerithioidea + Campaniloidea] as suggested by the indent pattern in Bouchet &amp; Rocroi. Neotaenioglossa Haller, 1892 suggested in Ruud Bank&#x27;s draft for Fauna Europaea is not retained because it would need severe emendation to remove Pyramidellids, Cerithioids, etc. included in its original definition, and therefore would be too far from Haller&#x27;s concept if it were to fit the concept of Sorbeoconcha. Although cladistically sound, the taxon Sorbeoconcha is skipped in the classification scheme because (1) ten years after its publication, the name still sounds unfamiliar to most and (2) it is not very helpful in the classification because it includes the bulk of Caenogastropoda (only keeping out small stem groups Abyssochrysidae, Provannidae, and the architaenioglossate taxa). This is not final, opinions are welcome.

;Taxonomy as provided by WoRMS in 2021:
* Subterclass Sorbeoconcha 
* Superorder Hypsogastropoda
* Order Architaenioglossa
* Order Littorinimorpha
* Order Neogastropoda
* Order [unassigned] Caenogastropoda (temporary name)
* Order Stenoglossa has become a synonym of Neogastropoda

<text>At the [[2004 Summer Olympics]], the [[triathlon]] events were held at the Vouliagmeni Olympic Centre. Fifty triathletes contested the female event on August 25, and the same number contested the male event on August 26, making up a total of 100 competitors.

Each competitor starts the event with a 1500-metre swim course, followed by a 40 kilometre road bicycle race and finish with a 10 kilometre road run. Both leg transitions (swimming—cycling and cycling—running) are performed on a special transition area, under judge&#x27;s scrutiny and the duration of the transition is added to the final time.

A pre-Olympic test event was staged over the Olympic course in October 2003, and saw Denmark&#x27;s Rasmus Henning and Australia&#x27;s Michellie Jones winning the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s events.

<text>Sorbeoconcha is a taxonomic clade of snails, i.e. gastropods, mainly marine species with gills and opercula, within the clade Caenogastropoda.

The taxon Sorbeoconcha was named by Winston Ponder and David R. Lindberg in 1997.

==Taxonomy==

===1997 taxonomy===
According to the older taxonomy by Ponder and Lindberg the suborders within the order Sorbeoconcha are:
* Discopoda P. Fischer, 1884
* Murchisoniina Cox &amp; Knight, 1960
* Hypsogastropoda Ponder &amp; Lindberg, 1997
* Cerithiimorpha Golikov &amp; Starobogatov, 1975

===2005 taxonomy===
In the taxonomy by Bouchet &amp; Rocroi (2005), the clade Sorbeoconcha was declared a taxon of unspecified rank, within the clade Caenogastropoda.

It comprises the superfamily Cerithioidea, the superfamily Campaniloidea, the informal group Ptenoglossa and the clade Neogastropoda.

The following families were not allocated to a superfamily:
* † Acanthonematidae Wenz, 1938
* † Canterburyellidae Bandel, Gründel &amp; Maxwell, 2000
* &quot;Globocornidae&quot; 
* † Prisciphoridae Bandel, Gründel &amp; Maxwell, 2000

The World Register of Marine Species considers Sorbeoconcha an alternate representation of Caenogastropoda and gives the following reasoning:
Sorbeoconcha should include [Cerithioidea + Campaniloidea + all Hypsogastropoda (i.e. the remaining Caenogastropoda)], see definition in Ponder &amp; Lindberg, 1997: 225, not only [Cerithioidea + Campaniloidea] as suggested by the indent pattern in Bouchet &amp; Rocroi.

Neotaenioglossa Haller, 1892 suggested in Ruud Bank’s draft for Fauna Europaea is not retained because it would need severe emendation to remove Pyramidellids, Cerithioids, etc.. included in its original definition, and therefore would be too far from Haller&#x27;s concept if it were to fit the concept of Sorbeoconcha.

Although cladistically sound, the taxon Sorbeoconcha is skipped in the classification scheme because (1) ten years after its publication, the name still sounds unfamiliar to most and (2) it is not very helpful in the classification because it includes the bulk of Caenogastropoda (only keeping out small stem groups Abyssochrysidae, Provannidae, and the architaenioglossate taxa). This is not final, opinions are welcome.

<text>Ian Armit identifies the islet of Eilean Dòmhnuill (, , &quot;The Isle of Donald&quot;), Loch Olabhat, on North Uist, Scotland, as what may be the earliest crannog. Unstan ware pottery found there suggests a Neolithic period date of 3200–2800 BC. A surrounding timber screen and the turf-walled houses seem to have been repeatedly taken down and rebuilt, and in the final phase two oblong stone-footed structures bear a resemblance to Knap of Howar on Papa Westray, Orkney.

<text>The Kioloa Coastal Campus is a small campus of the Australian National University at Kioloa, used for studies in certain sciences. It was created in 1975, when Joy London donated the 3.48 km2 property on the South Coast of New South Wales to the university in perpetuity. The agreement between London and the university stressed that the property &quot;was to be used primarily for teaching and research in the field sciences&quot;. The property became the Edith and Joy London Foundation, and is now known as the Kioloa Coastal Campus (KCC) of the Australian National University.

It consists of a number of wooden accommodation buildings (with more under refurbishment), a wooden teaching/research building, and a more modern visitors&#x27; centre with cooking and eating facilities.

The Kioloa Global Land Cover Test Site (GLCTS) Pathfinder site is centered at the campus.

<text>The Völkischer Beobachter (; &quot;&quot;Völkisch&quot; Observer&quot;) was the newspaper of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) from 25 December 1920. It first appeared weekly, then daily from 8 February 1923. For twenty-four years it formed part of the official public face of the Nazi Party until its last edition at the end of April 1945. The paper was banned and ceased publication between November 1923, after Adolf Hitler&#x27;s arrest for leading the unsuccessful Beer Hall Putsch in Munich, and February 1925, the approximate date of the relaunching of the Party.

==History==
The &quot;fighting paper of the National Socialist movement of Greater Germany&quot;, or &quot;Kampfblatt der nationalsozialistischen Bewegung Großdeutschlands&quot; as it called itself, had its origin as the &quot;Münchener Beobachter&quot;, or &quot;Munich Observer&quot;, an anti-Semitic semi-weekly scandal-oriented paper which in 1918 was acquired by the Thule Society with financial backing by Käthe Bierbaumer and, in August 1919, was renamed &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; (see &quot;Völkisch&quot; and &quot;Völkisch&quot; movement).

By December 1920, the paper was heavily in debt. The Thule Society was thus receptive to an offer to sell the paper to the Nazis for 60,000 Papiermark. Major Ernst Röhm, who was an early member of the German Workers&#x27; Party, forerunner of the Nazi Party, and Dietrich Eckart, one of Hitler&#x27;s earliest mentors, persuaded Röhm’s commanding officer, Major General Franz Ritter von Epp, to provide the money from German Army funds for the paper to be purchased. The loan was secured with Eckart&#x27;s house and possessions as collateral, and Dr. Gottfried Grandel, an Augsburg chemist and factory owner, who was Eckart&#x27;s friend and a funder of the Party, as guarantor. After the Nazis acquired the paper, Eckart was its first editor. It was the party&#x27;s primary official organ.

In 1921, Adolf Hitler, who had taken full control of the NSDAP earlier that year, acquired all shares in the company, making him the sole owner of the publication.

The income from the sale alone did not support the paper. It sustained itself by selling non-interest-bearing promissory notes to party members and received loans and grants from wealthy patrons such as Helene Bechstein. The book publishing company, which Amann successfully expanded, later became the financial backbone. The &quot;Illustrierter Beobachter&quot; founded in 1926, was also a success. In addition, the followers were repeatedly reminded of their obligation to become subscribers and to advertise them.

During the Nazi rise to power, the newspaper reported general news but also party activities, presenting them as almost constant successes. Guidelines for propagandists urged that all posters, insofar as the police allowed, contain propaganda for it, and all meetings should be announced in it, although reports should be sent to the Propaganda Department, which would then forward corrected versions to the paper. Posters did indeed urge reading it. When Hitler was banned from public speaking, it was the main vehicle to propagate his views.

Joseph Goebbels published articles in the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; to attack the United States for criticizing anti-Jewish measures, and to attack the communist USSR.

The final issues of the paper from both April and May 1945 were not distributed.

According to top Soviet diplomat Vladimir Semyonov, Stalin suggested that the title of National Democratic Party of Germany&#x27;s newspaper (a satellite party created in East Germany to attract former Nazi supporters) could be called the &quot;Völkischer Beobachter&quot; in order to appeal to the party&#x27;s membership. The proposal was ultimately not adopted.

==Circulation==
The circulation of the paper was initially about 8,000, but it increased to 25,000 in autumn 1923 due to strong demand during the occupation of the Ruhr. In that year Hitler replaced Eckart as editor with Alfred Rosenberg, because Eckart&#x27;s alcoholism had begun to get in the way of running the paper. Hitler softened the blow by making it clear that he still regarded Eckart highly. &quot;His accomplishments are everlasting!&quot; Hitler said, he just was not constitutionally able to run a big business like a daily newspaper. &quot;I would not be able to do it, either,&quot; according to Hitler, &quot;I have been fortunate that I got a few people who know how to do it. ... It would be as if I tried to run a farm! I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it.&quot; 

The publication of the paper ceased on the prohibition of the Party after the failed Beer Hall Putsch of 9 November 1923, but it resumed on the party&#x27;s refoundation on 26 February 1925. The circulation rose along with the success of the Nazi movement, reaching more than 120,000 in 1931, 1.2 million in 1941, and 1.7 million by 1944. It sold 310,000 copies in 1933 and 982,000 copies in 1940.

<doc id="856761" wikidata="Q927389" url="?curid=856761" title="Muricidae">
<text>Muricidae is a large and varied taxonomic family of small to large predatory sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks, commonly known as murex snails or rock snails. With over 1,700 living species, the Muricidae represent almost 10% of the Neogastropoda. Additionally, 1,200 fossil species have been recognized. Numerous subfamilies are recognized, although experts disagree about the subfamily divisions and the definitions of the genera.
Many muricids have unusual shells which are considered attractive by shell collectors and by interior designers.

==Shell description==
Muricid shells are variably shaped, generally with a raised spire and strong sculpture with spiral ridges and often axial varices (typically three or more varices on each whorl), also frequently bearing spines, tubercles, or blade-like processes. Periostracum is absent in this family. The aperture is variable in shape; it may be ovate to more or less contracted, with a well-marked anterior siphonal canal that may be very long. The shell&#x27;s outer lip is often denticulated inside, sometimes with a tooth-like process on its margin. The columella is smoothish to weakly ridged. The operculum is corneous and of variable thickness, with the nucleus near the anterior end or at about midlength of the outer margin.

Many muricids have episodic growth, which means their shells grow in spurts, remaining the same size for a while (during which time the varix develops) before rapidly growing to the next size stage. The result is the series of above mentioned varices on each whorl.

==Life habits==
Most species of muricids are carnivorous, active predators that feed on other gastropods, bivalves, and barnacles. The access to the soft parts of the prey is typically obtained by boring a hole through the shell by means of a softening secretion and the scraping action of the radula. Because of their carnivory, some species may be considered pests because they can cause considerable destruction both in exploited natural beds of bivalves, and in farmed areas of commercial bivalves.

Muricids lay eggs in protective, corneous capsules, the size and shape of which vary by species. From these capsules the crawling juveniles, or more rarely planktonic larvae, hatch.

==Historical value==
Members of the family were harvested by early Mediterranean peoples, with the Phoenicians possibly the first to do so, to extract an expensive, vivid, stable dye known as Tyrian purple, imperial purple, or royal purple.

==The fossil record==
The family Muricidae first appears in the fossil record during the Aptian age of the Cretaceous period.

==Subfamilies==
According to the taxonomy of the Gastropoda by Bouchet &amp; Rocroi (2005) the family Muricidae consists of these subfamilies:
* Aspellinae 
*Coralliophilinae - synonym: Magilidae 
*Ergalataxinae 
*Haustrinae 
*Muricinae 
*Muricopsinae : synonym of Aspellinae ( junior subjective synonym)
*Ocenebrinae 
*Pagodulinae 
*Rapaninae - synonym: Thaididae 
*Tripterotyphinae : synonym of Muricopsinae : synonym of Aspellinae (junior subjective synonym)
*Trophoninae : synonym of Ocenebrinae (junior subjective synonym)
*Typhinae 
* [unassigned] Muricidae
;Synonyms:
*Subfamily Drupinae : synonym of Rapaninae 
*Genus Drupinia [sic]: synonym of &quot;Drupina&quot; 
*Genus Galeropsis : synonym of &quot;Coralliophila&quot; 
* Tritoninae : synonym of Ranellidae (Invalid: type genus placed on the Official Index by Opinion 886 [junior homonym of Triton Linnaeus, 1758])

<text>United Nations Day is an annual commemorative day, reflecting the official creation of the United Nations on 24 October 1945. In 1947, the United Nations General Assembly declared 24 October, the anniversary of the Charter of the United Nations, to &quot;be devoted to making known to the people of the world the aims and achievements of the United Nations and to gaining their support for&quot; its work.

In 1971, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a further resolution (United Nations Resolution 2782) declaring that United Nations Day shall be an international observance or international holiday and recommended that it should be observed as a public holiday by United Nations member states.

==World War II Allies&#x27; day==
The first event called &quot;United Nations Day&quot; was a World War II Allies&#x27; day of solidarity and military parades launched by US president Franklin D. Roosevelt tied to US Flag Day on 14 June 1942, six months after the Declaration by United Nations. It was observed in New York City as the &quot;New York at War&quot; parade, in London, and by the Soviet and Chinese governments.

It was observed throughout World War II, during 1942–1944. Prior to the foundation of the UN itself, it was not directly connected to the current international observance.

==Commemoration==
U.N. Day has traditionally been marked throughout the world with meetings, discussions and exhibits about the achievements and goals of the organization. In 1971, the General Assembly recommended that member states observe it as a public holiday.

Several international schools throughout the world would also celebrate the diversity of their student body on United Nations Day (although the event is not necessarily celebrated on 24 October). Celebrations often include a show of cultural performances in the evening and a food fair, where food is available from all over the world.

On United Nations Day in 1951, the United Nations Postal Administration issued the first UN Stamps, which were issued in U.S. Dollars at the U.N. Headquarters in New York.

In the United States, the President has issued a proclamation each year for United Nations Day since 1948.

In Kosovo, which is administered by the Interim Administration Mission, United Nations Day is an official non-working day.

<text>Rosa canina, the dog rose, is a variable climbing, wild rose species native to Europe, northwest Africa, and western Asia.

==Description==
The dog rose is a deciduous shrub normally ranging in height from , though it can scramble higher into the crowns of taller trees. Its multiple arching stems, are covered with small, sharp, hooked prickles, which aid it in climbing. The leaves are pinnate, with 5–7 leaflets, and have a delicious fragrance when bruised.


The dog rose blooms from June to July, with sweet-scented flowers that are usually pale pink, but can vary between a deep pink and white. They are in diameter with five petals. Like other roses it has a quintuscial aestivation. Unusually though, of its five sepals, when viewed from underneath, two are whiskered (or &#x27;bearded&#x27;) on both sides, two are quite smooth and one is whiskered on one side only. It has usually 10 or more pistils, and multiple stamens.

Flowers mature in September to October, into an oval, , red-orange hips. The fruits can persist on the plant for several months (if not eaten by wildlife) and become black.

Its form and flowers can be confused with fieldbriar &quot;Rosa agrestis&quot; and sweetbriar &quot;Rosa rubiginosa&quot;.

===Genetics===
Dog roses have an unusual kind of meiosis which is sometimes called permanent odd polyploidy, although it can also occur with even polyploidy (e.g. in tetraploids or hexaploids). Regardless of ploidy level, only seven bivalents are formed leaving the other chromosomes as univalents. Univalents are included in egg cells, but not in pollen. Similar processes occur in some other organisms. Dog roses (&quot;Rosa&quot; sect. &quot;Caninae&quot;) are most commonly pentaploid, i.e. with five times the base number of seven chromosomes for the genus &quot;Rosa&quot;, but may be diploid, tetraploid or hexaploid as well.

==Taxonomy==
Classical writers did not recognise &quot;Rosa canina&quot; as a rose, but called it &quot;Cynorrhodon&quot;, from the Greek &quot;kunórodon&quot;. In 1538, Turner called it &quot;Cynosbatos : wild hep or brere tree&quot;. Yet in 1551, Matthias de l&#x27;Obel classified it as a rose, under the name, &quot;Canina Rosa odorata et silvestris&quot;, in his herbal &quot;Rubus canis: Brere bush or hep tree&quot; .

Based on a 2013 DNA analysis using amplified fragment length polymorphisms of wild-rose samples from a transect across Europe (900 samples from section &quot;Caninae&quot;, and 200 from other sections), it has been suggested that the following named species are best considered as belonging to a single &quot;R. canina&quot; species complex:
* &quot;R. balsamica&quot; 
* &quot;R. caesia&quot; 
* &quot;R. corymbifera&quot; 
* &quot;R. dumalis&quot; 
* &quot;R. montana&quot; 
* &quot;R. stylosa&quot; 
* &quot;R. subcanina&quot; 
* &quot;R. subcollina&quot; 
* &quot;R.&quot; × &quot;irregularis&quot; 

===Etymology===
The botanical name is derived from the common names &#x27;dog rose&#x27; or similar in several European languages, including classical Latin and ancient (Hellenistic period) Greek.
The Roman naturalist Pliny attributed the name dog rose to a belief that the plant&#x27;s root could cure the bite of a mad dog. It is not clear if the dogs were rabid. According to &quot;The Oxford Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot;, the English name is a direct translation of the plant&#x27;s name from classical Latin, &quot;rosa canina&quot;, itself a translation of the Greek κυνόροδον (&#x27;kunórodon&#x27;); It is thought to have been used to treat the bite of rabid dogs in the 18th and 19th centuries. The origin of its name may be related to the hooked prickles on the plant that have resemblance to a dog&#x27;s canines. It is sometimes considered that the word &#x27;dog&#x27; has a disparaging meaning in this context, indicating &#x27;worthless&#x27; as compared with cultivated garden roses.

==Ecology==
===Pests and diseases===
The dog rose can be attacked by aphids, leafhoppers, glasshouse red spider mite, scale insects, caterpillars, rose leaf-rolling sawfly, and leaf-cutting bees.

When a gall wasp lays eggs into a leaf axillary or terminal bud the plant develops a chemically induced distortion known as &quot;rose gall&quot;.

Buds and leaves may be eaten by rabbits and deer, despite the thorns.

It may be affected by rose rust and powdery mildews (&quot;Sphaerotheca pannosa&quot; var. &quot;rosae&quot;), and downy mildew (&quot;Peronospora sparsa&quot;).

It is notably susceptible to honey fungus.

===As an invasive species===
Dog rose is an invasive species in the high country of New Zealand. It was recognised as displacing native vegetation as early as 1895 although the Department of Conservation does not consider it to be a conservation threat.

The dog rose is classified as a weed in Australia under the Natural Resources Management Act of 2004. It outcompetes native plants, offers shelter to pests like foxes and rabbits, is not eaten by livestock due to its unpalatable nature, and its large shrubs resist grazing by farm animals. The dog rose invades native bushland therefore reducing biodiversity and the presence of desirable pasture species. It is a biosecurity risk as it hosts fruit fly.
In the US, it is classified as a weed and invasive in some regions or habitats, where it may displace desirable vegetation due to its large size and
ability of regeneration from sprouts. It can also impede the movement of livestock, wildlife and vehicles.

Birds and wild fruit eating animals are the main cause of seed dispersal. The plant seeds can also be carried in the hooves or fur of stock animals. They may also be carried by waterways.

==Cultivation==
The dog rose is hardy to zone 3 in the UK (USDA hardiness zone 3–7), tolerates maritime exposure, grows well in a sunny position, and grows even in heavy clay soils, but like all roses dislikes water-logged soils or very dry sites. In deep shade, it usually fails to flower and fruit.

Numerous cultivars have been named, though few are common in cultivation. The cultivar &quot;Rosa canina&quot; &#x27;Assisiensis&#x27; is the only dog rose without thorns. Thought to be linked to Saint Francis of Assisi, hence the name.

==Uses==
Rose hip essential oil is composed mainly of alcohols, monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes.

The fruit is used to make syrup, tea, and preserves (jam and marmalade), and is used in the making of pies, stews, and wine. The flowers can be made into a syrup, eaten in salads, candied, or preserved in vinegar, honey or brandy. During World War II in the United States, &quot;Rosa canina&quot; was planted in victory gardens; it can still be found growing throughout that country, including on roadsides, in pastures and nature conservation areas.

In Poland, the petals are used to make a jam that is particularly suitable for filling pączki, a type of doughnuts.

In Bulgaria, where the dog rose grows in abundance, its hips are used to make sweet wine and tea.

==In culture==
The dog rose was the stylised rose of medieval European heraldry. It is the county flower of Hampshire, and Ireland&#x27;s County Leitrim is nicknamed &quot;The Wild Rose County&quot; due to the prevalence of the dog rose in the area. Legend states the Thousand-year Rose or Hildesheim Rose, which climbs against a wall of Hildesheim Cathedral, dates back to the establishment of the diocese in 815.

The first recorded significance of the flower dates back hundreds of years ago to The Academy of Floral Games (founded in 1323), which gifted poets a sprig of dog rose to reward them for their literary excellence. Due to this ritual, the branches became increasingly popular and can be found frequently mentioned in several famous poems. Most prevalent in the United Kingdom, William Shakespeare wrote about the flower in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, which in his time was called eglantine, though it can now also refer to &quot;Rosa rubiginosa&quot; (Sweet brier).

Oberon, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, Act II, Scene I quoting his words: &quot;With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine.&quot;

Symbolically, the meaning of this shrub is quite extensive since the two dominating themes surrounding the flower are pain and pleasure.

An old riddle is called &quot;The Five Brethren of the Rose&quot;:

&quot;On a summer&#x27;s day, in sultry weather&quot;
&quot;Five Brethren were born together&quot;
&quot;Two had beards and two had none&quot;
&quot;And the other had but half a one.&quot;

The riddle contains an effective way of identifying the differing roses of the canina group, where the &quot;brethren&quot; refers to the five sepals of the dog-rose, two of which are whiskered on both sides, two quite smooth and the last one whiskered on one side only.

The flower has also been used as an image on many postage stamps across Europe.

<doc id="856781" wikidata="Q284702" url="?curid=856781" title="Ginette Neveu">
<text>Ginette Neveu (11 August 191928 October 1949) was a French violinist. She was killed in a plane crash at the age of 30.

== Early life ==
Neveu was born in Paris on 11 August 1919 into a musical family. Her brother Jean-Paul became a classical pianist (and her eventual accompanist) and the composer and organist Charles-Marie Widor was their great-uncle. Neveu&#x27;s mother was her first teacher.

Neveu made her solo debut at the age of seven with Bruch&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 1 at the Salle Gaveau in Paris. In the same year she performed Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto in E minor with the Colonne Orchestra under Gabriel Pierné. Her parents then decided to send her to study under Line Talluel. Aged nine, she won first prize at the École Supérieure de Musique and the City of Paris Prix d&#x27;Honneur. After further studies with Jules Boucherit at the Conservatoire de Paris, she completed her training with instruction from George Enescu (who had been Yehudi Menuhin&#x27;s teacher), Nadia Boulanger and Carl Flesch. Flesch offered to teach her without charge after hearing her in the Vienna International Violin Competition, at which, aged 12, she was placed fourth out of 250 entrants. The &quot;Vienna Neues Tageblatt&quot; wrote, &quot;If you close your eyes, you think you are listening to the vigorous playing of a man and not that of a little girl in a white frock.&quot;

== Career ==

In 1935, aged 15, Neveu achieved worldwide celebrity status when she won the Henryk Wieniawski Violin Competition. Unable to afford the cost of travel to Warsaw, the family was helped by Flesch, who paid for the trip. In the preliminary round (of 180 competitors) Neveu was placed first, 26 points ahead of David Oistrakh, and in the final again she came in first. She was 15, Oistrakh 27 at the time. Henri Temianka was placed third. Neveu was immediately signed to an extensive touring contract which over the next two years saw her give solo performances at the leading concert halls of Germany, Poland, the Soviet Union, the United States and Canada.

Neveu&#x27;s international career was interrupted by World War II, during which she gave few concerts, nearly all in France. Many invitations to play in Germany were turned down. She was finally able to make her London debut in 1946. She recorded Sibelius&#x27;s Violin Concerto at Abbey Road Studios in the same year.

Her brother Jean-Paul usually accompanied her on piano, and the two toured postwar Europe extensively, appearing at the Prague Spring International Music Festival as well as visiting Australia and South America. They also played return engagements at major venues in the United States. At one concert in the Royal Albert Hall, Queen Elizabeth was so moved by the Beethoven Concerto that she invited Neveu up to the royal box for the second half. &#x27;On the platform,&#x27; wrote the critic of the &quot;New York Telegram&quot;, &#x27;Ginette Neveu is an impressive figure – tall, dark, and with an imposing manner. Whenever there is a rest for the violin she stands like an acolyte robed in white, her eyes fixed on the conductor ... it is fascinating.&#x27;

Neveu made few commercial recordings, but all of them remain in the catalogue. She recorded the Brahms and Sibelius Concertos, Ravel&#x27;s Tzigane, Chausson&#x27;s &quot;Poème&quot;, the Debussy Sonata (with her brother) and a handful of shorter pieces. There are also two recordings of her Beethoven Concerto (with Hans Rosbaud and Willem van Otterloo conducting) and two other recordings of her Brahms (with Antal Dorati and Hans Schmidt-Isserstedt) from non-commercial sources. Most highly praised, and most revelatory, was her Sibelius (with the Philharmonia Orchestra and Walter Susskind). Of it, the composer wrote, &#x27;I particularly wish to speak of my feeling of profound gratitude when I think of the inspired and extremely sensitive performance of my Violin Concerto which Ginette Neveu rendered unforgettable.&#x27; She loved the Concerto, but, as she said, &#x27;Ils ne le connaissent en France, et ils ne veulent pas le connaitre!&#x27; (They don&#x27;t know it in France, and they don&#x27;t want to know it!). Perhaps she was thinking of that difficult concerto when she wrote, &#x27;As far as I am concerned, the truly technical problems which are the most disconcerting and the most fruitful are those posed by composers who have a strong personality and pursue the essence of their musical idea to its logical conclusion without wasting too much sympathy on the performer.&#x27;

== Plane crash and death ==

Neveu gave her last concert in Paris on 20 October 1949. On 28 October, she was on board an Air France flight from Paris to New York when it crashed on a mountain after two failed attempts to make a landing at the Santa Maria Airport in the Azores. All 48 people on board the flight died, including Ginette, her brother Jean Neveu, and the French former boxing champion Marcel Cerdan. Her violin, made by Omobono Stradivari in 1730, was also lost.

During the return of the bodies to France, Neveu&#x27;s coffin was confused with that of another victim, Amélie Ringler, whose funeral took place before the error was discovered. On 28 November, Neveu&#x27;s brother-in-law identified her remains in the coffin disinterred from the graveyard in Bantzenheim. Neveu now lies in Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, close to the grave of Frédéric Chopin.

== Legacy ==

After Neveu&#x27;s death, tributes poured in. The Queen of Belgium visited the grieving family, who had lost a son and a daughter. The composer Francis Poulenc, whose Violin Sonata Neveu had premiered (and parts of which she had contributed), wrote, &#x27;I am haunted by the memory of Ginette Neveu. I had the greatest admiration for her and I loved her dearly.&#x27; For Pablo Casals, &#x27;Her playing was one of the greatest revelations, both instrumental and musical.&#x27; Charles Munch, newly installed conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra, who had often worked with her, wrote &#x27;Dear Ginette, the memory of you will never cease to haunt us, and each time that by the grace of God we are able to make music really well, we shall feel you very close to us.&#x27; Jacques Thibaud, the great French violinist (who would himself die in a plane crash shortly afterward), wrote, &#x27;Why was it that at the dawn of her days an unjust and relentless stroke of fate should come and cut off a life which was bringing to the world nothing but beauty and joy? But in spite of the sternness of destiny, in the hearts of her friends and of the whole world Ginette is unforgettable. The memory of her will never die.&#x27;

Neveu was posthumously awarded the Cross of the Legion d&#x27;Honneur. A street is named in her memory in the Montmartre region of Paris.

<text>Geoffrey D. Miller (born c. 1949) is a retired United States Army major general who commanded the US detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and Iraq. Detention facilities in Iraq under his command included Abu Ghraib prison, Camp Cropper, and Camp Bucca. He is noted for having trained soldiers in using torture, or &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; in US euphemism, and for carrying out the &quot;First Special Interrogation Plan,&quot; signed by the Secretary of Defense, against a Guantanamo detainee.

Miller was born in Gallipolis, Ohio. He attended Ohio State University, where he earned an undergraduate degree in history, following this with a Master of Science in Education Administration at the University of Southern California. Miller is the nephew of Bob Evans, of Bob Evans Restaurants, franchiser from Rio Grande, Ohio.

Miller joined the US Army in 1972 and was trained in field artillery and army command. He spent time in Germany before being stationed in Korea in 1980. There, he rose to become assistant chief of staff for operations in Korea. Miller later returned to the United States to become the deputy chief of staff for personnel and installation management for the U.S. Army.

==Guantanamo Bay, Cuba==
In November 2002, Miller was given command of Joint Task Force Guantanamo (JTF-GTMO), where he served into late 2004. He ran the US detention facilities known as Camp X-Ray, Camp Delta, and Camp Echo in the US Naval Base at Guantanamo, Cuba. In 2002 Miller claimed that two-thirds of the 600 prisoners had confessed to being involved in terrorism and were giving &quot;actionable intelligence.&quot;

The U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on December 2, 2002, authorized in writing the &quot;First Special Interrogation Plan,&quot; listing 17 techniques to be used on the detainee Mohammed al-Qahtani. These were developed in consultation with Miller, who carried them out. It was later revealed that such techniques were used more widely against other prisoners as well. Miller advocated the use of extreme torture. At the time, the Red Cross was denied access to detainees.

On September 22, 2003, Miller ordered the arrest of James Yee, an Army captain who served as a chaplain for the Muslim prisoners at Guantanamo.
Miller accused Yee of stealing classified documents and smuggling them out of the prison, but those charges were later dropped. Captain Yee was honorably discharged on January 7, 2004. It is believed that no evidence of espionage was found, but records on the case have been sealed.

==Abu Ghraib prison scandal==
In 2008, as a result of a joint Senate investigation by the Intelligence and Armed Services Committees, it was revealed that on March 14, 2003, John Yoo of the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, issued a legal opinion to William Haynes, General Counsel of the Department of Defense, in which he concluded that federal laws related to the use of torture and other abuse would not apply to US interrogators overseas. This was five days before the US invasion of Iraq began on March 19, 2003. Yoo had also been involved in drafting what came to be known as the Torture Memos of August 2002, which had been issued to the CIA. In June 2004, Jack Goldsmith, then head of OLC, advised Defense and the CIA not to rely on these memos.

In August 2003, Miller was sent to Iraq by the Department of Defense to advise on &quot;more productive&quot; interrogations of Iraqi prisoners. In September, Miller submitted a report that recommended &quot;GTMO-ising&quot; their approach – combining the detention and interrogation units at Abu Ghraib prison into the Theater Joint Interrogation and Detention Center. Specifically, Miller suggested that prison guards be used to &quot;soften up&quot; prisoners for interrogations.

In his final report on the prison abuse at Abu Ghraib the following year, General Antonio Taguba blamed Miller&#x27;s recommendations for the abuse. He said that using military police or guards for interrogation was a breach of official policy. Miller denies that he specifically ordered guards to torture prisoners to get information.

After the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse story broke in April 2004, Brigadier General Janis Karpinski was suspended. Miller was appointed as the deputy commanding general for detainee operations for Multinational Forces in Iraq. In this role, Miller reported directly to Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez. Miller vowed to reduce the number of prisoners in Abu Ghraib, adhere to military laws as well as the Geneva Convention, investigate allegations of abuse, and reform the Iraqi prison system. He banned the use of hoods on prisoners during transport and set up a new system to allow prisoners to have visitors.

Since the investigation of abuses at Abu Ghraib, some have suggested that Miller had earlier encouraged abusive tactics. In an interview with BBC Radio, Janis Karpinski, the former prison commander, claimed that Miller had told her to treat prisoners &quot;like dogs,&quot; saying, &quot;if you allow them to believe at any point that they are more than a dog then you&#x27;ve lost control of them&quot;. Major General Miller denies the statement.

Colonel Thomas Pappas, head of the military intelligence brigade at Abu Ghraib, has claimed that it was Miller&#x27;s idea to use attack dogs to intimidate prisoners. He said the same tactics were being used at Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo. Several of the photos taken at Abu Ghraib show dogs surrounding (and in at least one case biting) screaming, naked detainees.

In November 2004, Miller was replaced as deputy commanding general for detainee operations by Major General William H. Brandenburg.

===Exercised Fifth Amendment right===
In 2006, Miller exercised his use of the Fifth Amendment in refusing to answer certain questions while testifying in courts martial cases related to Abu Ghraib. He also used his right during a hearing before the US Senate in 2006. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;He changed his position when the US Senate Armed Services Committee delayed his retirement until he was more forthcoming.&quot;

In May 2006, Miller testified at the courts martial of the Abu Ghraib dog handlers that his instructions on the use of dogs had been misunderstood. Miller testified that he instructed that dogs should be used &quot;only for custody and control of detainees&quot;. The next day Miller&#x27;s testimony was directly contradicted by Lieutenant Colonel Jerry Phillabaum, the commander of Abu Ghraib&#x27;s Military Police detachment.

==Request for war crimes prosecution==
In November 2006, the German government received a complaint seeking the prosecution of Alberto Gonzales, then-Attorney General and former White House Counsel, for alleged war crimes. Co-defendants included: Geoffrey D. Miller, Donald H. Rumsfeld, George Tenet, Stephen Cambone, Ricardo S. Sanchez, Walter Wojdakowski, Thomas M. Pappas, Barbara Fast, Marc Warren, John Yoo, William J. Haynes, II, David Addington, and Jay Bybee, top political appointees who participated in making policy about the use of enhanced interrogation techniques for CIA and DOD.

On November 14, 2006, the German attorney Wolfgang Kaleck filed the complaint with the Public Prosecutor General (&quot;Generalbundesanwalt&quot;) against Miller for his complicity in torture and other crimes against humanity at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Kaleck was acting on behalf of 11 victims of torture and other human rights abuses, as well as about 30 human rights activists and organizations who are co-plaintiffs.

The co-plaintiffs to the war crimes prosecution include:
1980 Nobel Peace Prize winner Adolfo Pérez Esquivel (Argentina), 2002 Nobel Peace Prize winner Martín Almada (Paraguay), Theo van Boven, the former United Nations Special Rapporteur on Torture, Sister Dianna Ortiz (Torture survivor, executive director of Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition International), the International Federation for Human Rights, the International Peace Bureau (Nobel Peace Prize winner in 1910), the International Association of Lawyers Against Nuclear Arms (IALANA), European Democratic Lawyers, European Democratic Jurists, International Association of Democratic Lawyers, Comité de Acción Jurídica (CAJ) (Argentina), Liga Argentina por los Derechos del Hombre (Argentina), Bahrain Human Rights Society (BHRS), Lawyers Against the War (LAW) (Canada), Colectivo de Abogados José Alvear Restrepo (Colombia), Association Africaine des Droits de l&#x27;Homme (ASADHO) (Democratic Republic of Congo), Egyptian Organization for Human Rights (EOHR) (Egypt), Ligue Française des Droits de l&#x27;Homme (LDH) (France), (RAV) (Germany), Amman Center for Human Rights Studies (ACHR) (Jordan), Comisión Mexicana de Defensa y Promoción de los Derechos Humanos (CMDPDH) (Mexico), Liga Mexicana por la Defensa de los Derechos Humanos (LIMEDDH), Centro Nicaragüense de Derechos Humanos (CENIDH) (Nicaragua), Palestinian Center for Human Rights, Association Tchadienne pour la Promotion et la Défense des Droits de l&#x27;Homme (ATPDH) (Chad), (RADDHO) (Senegal), The Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) (United States), National Lawyers Guild (NLG) (US), Torture Abolition and Survivors Support Coalition International (TASSC) (US), and Veterans for Peace (US).

On January 7, 2011, the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR) and the European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights (ECCHR) asked a Spanish judge to subpoena Miller to explain his role in the torture of four former detainees.

On April 2, 2015, the Court of Appeal of Paris ordered a first hearing of Miller to be conducted before a French magistrate prior to potential prosecutions. A subpoena will be addressed to Miller. On February 19, 2016, General Miller was summoned to a hearing regarding allegation of torture by two French citizens. Miller faced one allegation of illegal detention and torture of two detainees Mourad Benchelli and Nizar Sassi. Benchelli and Sassi were detained at Guantánamo Bay from 2002 and 2004 on terrorism related charges. After being transferred to French custody, both were convicted of charges in 2009 but not sent to prison. In April 2016, the French Court of Appeal approved Benchelli and Sassi&#x27;s request and demanded Miller appear at a hearing for questioning but Miller ignored the summons.

==Congressional testimony==
In July 2005, discrepancies emerged between Miller&#x27;s May 2004 testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, and sworn statements he made three months later.

On May 19, 2004, Miller had testified to the committee that he had only filed a report on his visit to Abu Ghraib, and didn&#x27;t talk to Secretary Rumsfield or any of his top aides. Miller stated, that he &quot;submitted the report up to SOUTHCOM (U.S. Southern Command, where Miller was attached in 2003),&quot; and &quot;had no direct discussions with Secretary Cambone.&quot; Three months later, Miller said he and Undersecretary Stephen Cambone had discussed &quot;how we could improve the flow of intelligence from Iraq through and in interrogations.&quot; Also, he released a statement to defense lawyers for guards being accused of prisoner abuse stating he gave an outbrief to both Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz and Secretary Miller said in the Aug. 21, 2004, statement to lawyers for guards accused of prisoner abuse, a transcript of which was obtained by the Chicago Tribune.

==Retirement==
Miller retired from the Army on July 31, 2006.
&quot;The Washington Post&quot; reports that Miller had wanted to retire in February, forgoing trying for promotion to lieutenant general, because his reputation had been damaged by alleged links between his policies at the Guantanamo Bay detainment camp and at Abu Ghraib, and the abuse of prisoners. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reported that Congress delayed his retirement because senators were not confident he told the truth when he testified before them. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; reports that he was allowed to retire only when he promised, in writing, to appear before Congress, and testify truthfully.

At his retirement service, Miller was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, and praised as an &quot;innovator&quot;.

<text>San Miniato al Monte (St. Minias on the Mountain) is a basilica in Florence, central Italy, standing atop one of the highest points in the city. It has been described as one of the finest Romanesque structures in Tuscany and one of the most scenic churches in Italy. There is an adjoining Olivetan monastery, seen to the right of the basilica when ascending the stairs.

==History==
St. Miniato or Minas () was an Armenian prince serving in the Roman army under Emperor Decius. He was denounced as a Christian after becoming a hermit and was brought before the Emperor who was camped outside the gates of Florence. The Emperor ordered him to be thrown to beasts in the Amphitheatre where a panther was called upon him but refused to devour him. Beheaded in the presence of the Emperor, he is alleged to have picked up his head, crossed the Arno and walked up the hill of Mons Fiorentinus to his hermitage. A shrine was later erected at this spot and there was a chapel there by the 8th century. Construction of the present church was begun in 1013 by Bishop Alibrando and it was endowed by the Emperor Henry II. The adjoining monastery began as a Benedictine community, then passed to the Cluniacs and then in 1373 to the Olivetans, who still run it. The monks make famous liqueurs, honey and herbal teas, which they sell from a shop next to the church.

==Interior==
The interior exhibits the early feature of a choir raised on a platform above the large crypt. It has changed little since it was first built. The patterned pavement dates from 1207. The centre of the nave is dominated by the beautiful freestanding &quot;Cappella del Crocefisso&quot; (Chapel of the Crucifix), designed by Michelozzo in 1448. It originally housed the miraculous crucifix now in Santa Trìnita and is decorated with panels long thought to be painted by Agnolo Gaddi. The terracotta decoration of the vault is by Luca della Robbia.

The crypt is the oldest part of the church and the high altar supposedly contains the bones of St Minias himself (although there is evidence that these were removed to Metz before the church was even built). In the vaults are frescoes by Taddeo Gaddi.

The raised choir and presbytery contain a magnificent Romanesque pulpit and screen made in 1207. The apse is dominated by a great mosaic of &quot;Christ between the Virgin and St Minias&quot; on its vaulted ceiling
dating from 1297; the same subject is depicted on the façade of the church and is probably by the same unknown artist. The crucifix above the high altar is attributed to Luca della Robbia. The sacristy is decorated with a great fresco cycle on the Life of St Benedict by Spinello Aretino (1387).

===Cardinal of Portugal Chapel===
The &quot;Cappella del Cardinale del Portogallo&quot; to the left of the nave, &quot;one of the most magnificent funerary monuments of the Italian Renaissance&quot;, was built in 1473 as a memorial to Cardinal James of Lusitania, who died in Florence, to which he was Portuguese ambassador, in 1459. It is the only tomb in the church. The chapel is a collaboration of outstanding artists of Florence: it was designed by Brunelleschi&#x27;s associate, Antonio Manetti, and finished after his death by Antonio Rossellino. The tomb was made by Antonio and Bernardo Rossellino. The chapel decoration is by Alesso Baldovinetti, Antonio and Piero del Pollaiuolo, and Luca della Robbia.

==Exterior==
The geometrically patterned marble façade was probably begun in about 1090, although the upper parts date from the 12th century or later, financed by the Florentine &quot;Arte di Calimala&quot; (cloth merchants’ guild), who were responsible for the church&#x27;s upkeep from 1288. The eagle which crowns the façade was their symbol.

The campanile collapsed in 1499 and was replaced in 1523, although it was never finished. During the siege of Florence in 1530 it was used as an artillery post by the defenders and Michelangelo had it wrapped in mattresses to protect it from enemy fire.

==Church complex==

Adjacent to the church is the fine cloister, planned as early as 1426 and built from 1443 to mid-1450s. It was also designed by Bernardo and Antonio Rosselino, and financed by the &quot;Arte della Mercantia&quot; of Florence, and the fortified bishop&#x27;s palace, built in 1295 and later used as a barracks and a hospital. The whole complex is surrounded by defensive walls, originally built hastily by Michelangelo during the siege and in 1553 expanded into a true fortress (&quot;fortezza&quot;) by Cosimo I de&#x27; Medici. 

The walls now enclose a large ornate monumental cemetery, the &quot;Porte Sante&quot;, laid out in 1854. Buried there are Carlo Collodi, creator of Pinocchio; politician Giovanni Spadolini; painter Pietro Annigoni; poet and author Luigi Ugolini; film producer Mario Cecchi Gori; sculptor Libero Andreotti; fine artist Maria Luisa Ugolini Bonta; soprano Marietta Piccolomini; writer Giovanni Papini; experimental physicist Bruno Benedetto Rossi; and film director and opera producer Franco Zeffirelli.

==Notable events== 
The basilica served as an important setting in Brian de Palma&#x27;s 1976 film &quot;Obsession&quot;.

On 16 June 2012, it was the venue for the religious wedding of Dutch royal Princess Carolina of Bourbon-Parma with businessman Albert Brenninkmeijer.

<doc id="856789" wikidata="Q7599224" url="?curid=856789" title="Stanisław Skarżyński">
<text>Stanisław Jakub Skarżyński (1 May 1899 − 26 June 1942) was a lieutenant colonel in the Polish Air Force and aviator famous for his transatlantic solo flight in 1933.

==Early military career==
In 1916–17 Skarżyński was a member of the Polish Military Organisation (POW). In November 1918 he volunteered for the newly created Polish Army, and commanded units disarming German soldiers in Warta. He then fought in the Polish-Soviet War with the infantry, being promoted to second lieutenant in 1919. He was wounded but returned to the front. During the battle of Radzymin he was severely wounded in one leg on 16 August 1920. The infected wound needed long rehabilitation, and Skarżyński always limped thereafter. Unable to continue serving in the infantry, he managed to transfer to the military aviation arm.

He completed pilot training in Bydgoszcz in 1925, and served in the 1st Aviation Regiment in Warsaw. In 1927 he became a Flying Captain (&quot;kapitan pilot&quot;). Between 1 and 5 February May 1931 together with Lt. Andrzej Markiewicz, he flew around Africa in the Polish-designed aircraft PZL Ł-2 (registration SP-AFA), a total distance of 25,770 km.

==Transatlantic flight==
On 7/8 May 1933 Skarzynski flew solo in a small single-seater Polish tourist airplane RWD-5bis (SP-AJU) across the southern Atlantic, from Saint-Louis, Senegal to Maceio in Brazil. The flight took 20 hours 30 minutes (17 hours 15 minutes above the ocean). He crossed 3,582 km, establishing a distance World Record in a FAI tourist plane category II (weight below 450 kg / 1000 lb). The plane had no radio nor safety equipment, due to weight restrictions. The RWD-5bis remains the smallest plane to ever to have flown across the Atlantic. Plans of his flight were kept secret. It became a part of Warsaw – Rio de Janeiro flight, between 27 April and 10 May 17,885 km long. He then flew on to Buenos Aires and returned to Europe by ship.

==Later service and World War II==
In 1934, he was promoted to major and commanded a bomber squadron. From 1938, he was deputy C.O. of the 4th Aviation Regiment in Toruń, with a rank of lieutenant colonel (&quot;podpułkownik pilot&quot;). In April 1939, he became President of the Polish Aero Club. In August 1939 he was sent to Romania as the deputy air attaché.

After the outbreak of World War II, he helped in transporting Polish pilots, fleeing from Poland, through Romania to France, where the Polish Air Force was recreated. In 1940 Skarżyński, after the fall of France, helped ship 17,000 Polish airmen to Britain, where he became commanding officer of Polish Flying Schools at RAF Hucknall and then RAF Newton.

In spite of his advanced age for a military pilot, and mobility impairment, he requested a combat posting, and was assigned as C.O. of RAF Lindholme and No. 305 Polish Bomber Squadron. He underook five successful night missions over France and Germany as the second pilot. On 25/26 June 1942, while flying on a mission over Bremen (one of the thousand-aircraft raids), an engine stalled in his Wellington Mk II, code letters SM-R, above the North Sea. Skarżyński did not make it home and ditched the aircraft in the stormy sea, after 2 am, around 65 km from English coast. Skarżyński, leaving the Wellington from a separate emergency hatch, was probably washed out to sea from the fuselage top, and was the only crew member lost. His body was found on the Dutch shore and he was later buried with full military honours on the Dutch island of Terschelling.

==Honours==
He was awarded the Virtuti Militari 5th class (for the Polish-Soviet war), Cross of Independence, Order of Polonia Restituta 4th class, Krzyż Walecznych (four times), Golden and Silver Cross of Merit, the French Legion d&#x27;Honneur and the Brazilian Order of the Southern Cross. The FAI awarded him the Louis Blériot medal (1936) of which he was one of the first recipients.

Posthumously he was made a full colonel (&quot;pułkownik pilot&quot;) and awarded the Order of Polonia Restituta 2nd class by the President of Poland. There are numerous streets and schools named after him. He is the Patron of the Aeroclub of Włocławek and of the 13th Transport Squadron in Kraków. On 10 August 2009 the Minister of National Defense signed the Decree to appoint him as Patron of 8 Air Base in Kraków – Balice, which now is named after him.

* Commander&#x27;s Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta (posthumously, 19 September 1997)

<text>Marcelle Lender (1862 – 27 September 1926) was a French singer, dancer and entertainer made famous in paintings by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec.

Born Anne-Marie Marcelle Bastien, she began dancing at the age of sixteen and within a few years made a name for herself performing at the Théâtre des Variétés in Paris.

Lender appears in several works by Lautrec but the most notable is the one of her dancing the Bolero during her February 1895 performance in the Hervé operetta &quot;Chilpéric&quot;. Lautrec&#x27;s portrait of her in full costume, her flame-red hair accentuated by two red poppies worn like plumes, boosted Lender&#x27;s popularity considerably after it appeared in a Paris magazine. The painting was eventually sold to a collector from the United States, and on her death in 1998 the painting&#x27;s then owner, American Betsey Cushing Whitney, donated it to the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C.

<text>In naval warfare, a &quot;fleet in being&quot; is a naval force that extends a controlling influence without ever leaving port. Were the fleet to leave port and face the enemy, it might lose in battle and no longer influence the enemy&#x27;s actions, but while it remains safely in port, the enemy is forced to continually deploy forces to guard against it. A &quot;fleet in being&quot; can be part of a sea denial doctrine, but not one of sea control.

==Use of the term==
The term was first used in 1690 when Lord Torrington, commander of the Royal Navy forces in the English Channel, found himself facing a stronger French fleet. He proposed avoiding a sea battle, except under very favourable conditions, until he could be reinforced. By thus keeping his &quot;fleet in being&quot;, he could maintain an active threat which would force the enemy to remain in the area and prevent them from taking the initiative elsewhere.

===Secondary use===
Rudyard Kipling published a series of articles about the British Channel Fleet under the title &quot;A Fleet in Being: Notes of Three Trips with the Channel Squadron&quot; in 1898, but did not use the term in the sense described here.

==Concept==
The &quot;fleet in being&quot; concept is based on the assumption that the fleet is relatively safe in port, even if near the enemy. While this is not necessarily true in the modern era, for much of human history a fleet that was at harbor was much less exposed to attack and to other hazards such as storms. This made it difficult, or even impossible, for an enemy to damage the fleet without taking disproportionate losses. 

The enemy cannot simply ignore the fleet in being because it always has the option to sortie and attack wherever there are favourable terms. However, the blockading force has to be significant enough that the fleet in being cannot realistically attack it themselves. This creates a stalemate that favours the defender because the attacker always must deploy a superior force to counter them, and those units are unable to perform any other duties.

After the Battle of Taranto and the attack on Pearl Harbor, however, it became obvious that air power made a fleet concentrated in a port vulnerable, and a fleet in being became too risky to be practical. A port is a known location for an enemy to focus attacks on and a handful of aircraft or submarines can damage or sink multiple warships, even in the presence of advanced defenses. As a result, it is preferable for modern fleets to be at sea where their position is not fully known, which provides a degree of protection. 

This has not made a fleet in being completely irrelevant because there are situations where an enemy is unwilling or unable to attack the fleet in harbour, such as for political reasons. 

An example of this is during the Falklands War. After looking at the alternatives, &quot;The strategy that was accepted for the Argentine Navy [in the 1982 Falklands War] was one of a &#x27;fleet in being&#x27; concept ... The fleet would not conduct a direct attack; they would only attack when the odds were in their favor. Otherwise, they would remain outside any declared British exclusion zones and wait for a target of opportunity.&quot; The Argentines were not able to make any positive use of their &quot;fleet in being&quot;, because the sinking of the ARA &quot;General Belgrano&quot; by HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot; showed that the World War II-era cruisers and other assets of the Argentine Navy were vulnerable to attack from contemporary submarines.

The idea of a &quot;fleet in being&quot; can be generalised to forces other than naval. A fortress under siege is essentially an &quot;army in being&quot;, which ties up enemy forces without taking the risk of fighting a battle. 

While less developed there are a few similar cases for air forces. During the Gulf War, Saddam Hussein used his air force with an operational doctrine analogous to &quot;fleet in being&quot;. The mere presence of the Iraqi Air Force in hardened bunkers forced the coalition attacking Iraq to act cautiously and to escort its bomber sorties, until the aircraft shelters were found to be vulnerable.

In all cases the principle is the same. As long as a smaller force exists and has the choice to engage or not, the larger force is only able to conduct operations in sufficient strength to destroy the complete smaller force. This limits the enemy options significantly, and may even deny actions entirely. The closer that the smaller force is to the larger in strength, the more significant the effect will be.

==History==

===Russo-Japanese War 1904–1905===
The first modern example was the stand-off between the Imperial Russian Navy and the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) at Port Arthur during the Russo-Japanese War in 1904. Russia possessed three battle-fleets: one in the Baltic Sea, the second in the Black Sea, and the third in the Far East. The Pacific squadron in the Far East was stationed at Vladivostok and Port Arthur. With the latter being closer to the land war, Port Arthur became strategically more important.

The IJN possessed only one battle-fleet to the Russian Navy&#x27;s three; therefore it was imperative that the IJN not have to fight all three of them simultaneously. The Anglo-Japanese Treaty of 1902 effectively eliminated the Black Sea fleet by keeping it blocked in the Black Sea, lest they risk war with Britain. However, the Baltic Fleet (later renamed the 2nd Pacific Squadron) had orders to reinforce the Port Arthur squadron sometime in 1905. It would be the IJN&#x27;s mission to preempt that move.

Only after Port Arthur&#x27;s &quot;fleet in being&quot; was eliminated could the Baltic Fleet and Japanese fleet square off; and this would happen the following year, during the Battle of Tsushima in May 1905.

In order to permanently eliminate Port Arthur&#x27;s battle-squadron, the IJN initiated three operations. The first was a surprise destroyer torpedo attack inside the harbor in early February 1904. This was quickly followed up with an attempt to block the harbor&#x27;s entrance by sinking old steam ships (block ships) in the channel. The third and final attempt of permanently bottling up the fleet was the mining of the waters surrounding the harbor&#x27;s entrance. Although this last attempt also failed, it had the unintended consequence of robbing the Russian Navy of one of its most brilliant naval officers, Admiral Stepan Makarov. When his flagship, the battleship &quot;Petropavlovsk&quot;, struck one of those mines she sank almost immediately, drowning Makarov with the crew.

The &quot;fleet in being&quot; remained so, until under the new command of Admiral Vilgelm Vitgeft, the Port Arthur squadron was ordered to break out and steam for Vladivostok on 10 August 1904. Vitgeft&#x27;s exit from Port Arthur resulted in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, an excessively long-ranged gun duel that resulted in no capital warships being sunk on either side, but finally eliminated Port Arthur&#x27;s &quot;fleet in being&quot;, as its warships became dispersed to neutral ports (where they were interned), and the survivors were so heavily damaged that they were no longer serviceable.

===World War I===
A later example is the stand-off between the German High Seas Fleet and the British Grand Fleet during World War I. Germany largely preferred to keep its fleet intact rather than taking the risk of losing a major engagement with the larger Royal Navy, particularly after the Battle of Jutland.

===World War II===

In World War II, actions of the Italian &quot;Regia Marina&quot; in 1940 also demonstrate the idea of a &quot;fleet in being&quot;. After a number of minor battles against the Royal Navy that were mostly inconclusive, the bulk of Italian fleet was left in Taranto from where it could sortie very quickly against any British attempt to reach Malta, exerting a &quot;disproportionate influence on British strategy and fleet disposition&quot;. Even after the great tactical success of the British aircraft carrier attack on Taranto in November 1940, the British failure to deliver a decisive blow to the Italian fleet resulted in the Royal Navy tying up substantial naval forces in the Mediterranean for the next three years.

Even more so than other surface vessels in Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; (navy), the German battleship &quot;Tirpitz&quot; served her entire career as a &quot;fleet in being&quot; in her own right. Although remarkably she never fired a shot at an enemy ship, her mere presence in the Norwegian fiords forced the Royal Navy and their allies to allocate powerful warships in defending Arctic convoys, and caused a major convoy (PQ 17) to scatter, suffering huge losses, mainly to U-boats and aircraft. A 1943 midget submarine attack and successive airstrikes launched by the RAF and the Fleet Air Arm removed the threat by November 1944, when the &quot;Tirpitz&quot; was sunk at Tromsø by Lancaster bombers.

<doc id="856797" wikidata="Q2668288" url="?curid=856797" title="Trunk (luggage)">
<text>A trunk, also known as a travel trunk, is a large cuboid container designed to hold clothes and other personal belongings. They are most commonly used for extended periods away from home, such as for boarding school, or long trips abroad. Trunks are differentiated from chests by their more rugged construction due to their intended use as luggage, instead of the latter&#x27;s pure storage.

Among the many styles of trunks there are Jenny Lind, Saratoga, monitor, steamer or cabin, barrel-staves, octagon or bevel-top, wardrobe, dome-top, barrel-top, wall trunks, and even full dresser trunks. These differing styles often only lasted for a decade or two as well, and—along with the hardware—can be extremely helpful in dating an unmarked trunk.

==History and construction==
Although trunks have been around for thousands of years, the most common styles seen and referred to today date from the late 18th century to the early 20th century, when they were supplanted in the market by the cost-effective and lighter suitcase.

Trunks were generally constructed with a base trunk box made of pine which was then covered with protective and decorative materials. Some of the earliest trunks are covered with studded hide or leather and look much like the furniture of the same period (which makes sense as trunk manufacturing was sometimes an offshoot of a furniture business.) Later coverings include paper, canvas, plain or embossed tin, with an uncounted assortment of hardware and hardwood slats to keep it all down. They sometimes were made with a small brass handle on top and were made in many sizes.

The use of classic trunks for luggage was widespread through the first two decades of the twentieth century but began to fade in popularity thereafter in favor of the modern suitcase. By the end of the 1940s their use had become rare and in modern times is almost unknown.

==Famous companies==
There were hundreds of trunk manufacturers in the United States and a few of the larger and well known companies were Rhino Trunk &amp; Case, C. A. Taylor, Haskell Brothers, Martin Maier, Romadka Bros., Goldsmith &amp; Son, Crouch &amp; Fitzgerald, M. M. Secor, Winship, Hartmann, Belber, Oshkosh, Seward, and Leatheroid. One of the largest American manufacturers of trunks at one point—Seward Trunk Co. of Petersburg, Virginia—still makes them for school and camp, and another company—Shwayder Trunk Company of Denver, Colorado—would eventually become Samsonite. Another is the English luxury goods manufacturer H. J. Cave trading since 1839. Their Osilite trunk was used by such famous customers as T. E. Lawrence and Ruth Vincent. Some of the better known French trunk makers were Louis Vuitton, Goyard, Moynat, and Au Départ. Only a few remain with the most prominent US companies, being Mercury Seward, Rhino Trunk &amp; Case, and C &amp; N Footlockers.

==Styles and manufacturers==
The easiest way for the casual observer to date any trunk is still by examining its style, so a short description of each aforementioned major variety follows.

Jenny Lind trunks have a distinctive hour glass or keyhole shape when viewed from the side. They were named after the Swedish singer Jenny Lind.

Saratoga trunks were the premium trunks of many makers (or the exclusive design of many premium trunk makers) and actually can encompass nearly every other style of trunk manufactured if loosely defined, although generally they are limited to before the 1880s. The most readily recognizable feature of Saratogas are their myriad (and generally very complex) compartments, trays, and heavy duty hardware.

Monitor-tops (incorrectly known as water-fall trunks from the furniture) date from the late 1870s to the late 1910s, and are characterized by their rounded front and rear corners to form a lying-down &quot;D&quot; when viewed from the side. Earlier examples usually included labor-intensive hardwood slats that were curved with the top, while there was a revival much later with rarer, all-metal ones being constructed.

Steamer trunks (named after their location of storage in the cabin of a steam ship, or &quot;steamer&quot;) which are sometimes referred to as flat-tops, first appeared in the late 1870s, although the greater bulk of them date from the 1880–1920 period. They are distinguished by either their flat or slightly curved tops and were usually covered in canvas, leather or patterned paper and about tall to accommodate steamship luggage regulations. There has been much debate and discourse on what these types of trunks are actually called. In some old catalogs, these trunks were called &quot;packers&quot;, and the &quot;steamer&quot; trunk actually referred to a trunk that is often called a cabin trunk. An orthodox name for this type of trunk would be a &quot;packer&quot; trunk, but since it has been widely called a steamer for so long, it is now a hallmark of this style.

Cabin trunks, which are sometimes called &quot;true&quot; steamer trunks, were the equivalent of today&#x27;s carry-on luggage. They were low-profiled and small enough to fit under the berths of trains or in the cabin of a steamer, hence their name. Most were built with flat tops and had inner tray compartments to store the owner&#x27;s valuables deemed too precious to keep stowed away in the baggage (luggage) car or ship&#x27;s hold.


Hat trunks were square shaped trunks that were popular in the 1860s to the 1890s. Today, they are mostly called &quot;half-trunks&quot;. They were smaller and easier to carry, and could hold up to six hats or bonnets. Most were flat tops, but some had domed lids (which were very elegant). This trunk style was popular with Victorian women, hence antique trunk labels often calling this type a &quot;ladies&#x27; trunk&quot;. Hat trunks generally sell for more than any other average trunk style because they are smaller and are rather rare to find.


Barrel-staves are sometimes referred to as a form of dome-top trunk, but generally date from a decade or more earlier and are notable for having horizontal slats instead of vertical, giving it a distinctive look and construction. These were generally made from the late 1870s to the mid-1880s.

Bevel-tops are separated into an early and a late (or revival) period, the former generally dating from the 1870–1880 period, and the latter from 1890 to 1900. They are characterized by a distinct trapezoidal shape when viewed from the side, although the earlier period tended to have a much shorter flattened top section than the later did. These tend to be extremely rare, although are not as popular or sought-after as many of the other varieties.

Wardrobe trunks generally must be stood on end to be opened and have drawers on one side and hangers for clothes on the other. Many of the better wardrobe lines also included buckles/tie-downs for shoes, removable suitcases/briefcases, privacy curtains, mirrors, make-up boxes, and just about anything else imaginable. These are normally very large and heavy as they were used for extended travel by ship or train. Rhino Trunk and Case, Inc. still manufactures many styles of wardrobe trunks at their Rochester, NY facility.


A dome-top trunk has a high, curved top that can rise up to heights of . A variety of construction methods—including cuffing, molded ply, barrel construction, and so forth—were used to form the inner boxes. Included in this classification are camel-backs, which are distinguished by having a central, vertically running top slat that is higher than its fellows, hunch-backs or hump-backs which is the same but has no slat in the center of the top, and barrel-tops (not to be confused with barrel staves), which have high arching slats that are all the same height, a distinction that can be discerned by laying a ruler flat across the tops of the slats. These trunks date from 1870s-1900s, although there are a few shops still manufacturing them today. They are not only the most common trunks referred to as antique, but also are among the most popular.

Wall trunks are made with a special hinges so that when opened the trunk could still be put flat up against a wall. The two main manufacturers include Clinton and Miller, which can be easily noted by the name on the hinges. In good condition these are comparatively sought-after trunks for a specialty type, although are in the middling range when it comes to price.


Dresser trunks also known as pyramidal trunks, due to their shape, are a unique form of wall-trunk that generally date from the 1900–1910 era. They are characterized by a lid that opens up nearly the entire front half of the trunk, allowing it to rest on the bottom. Two prominent manufacturers of this trunk style were F. A. Stallman and Homer Young &amp; Co.

Oak-slat trunks incorporating many construction-styles (e.g. dome-top, flat-top, beveled-top) were built on a wooden frame, where the malletier would fit thin oak slats vertically side-by-side until the entire trunk was covered. To a Victorian, this would show the complexity of the trunk and astuteness of the malletier, and was an indication of wealth to any purchaser. Oak-slat trunks were built by several companies, including the Excelsior Company, MM (Martin Maier) Company, Clinton Wall Trunk Manufactory, and El Paso Slat Trunk Company. Some oak-slat trunks were made with alternating colors on the vertical slats.

Footlockers are trunk-like pieces of luggage used in military contexts. Generally these are designed for economy, ruggedness, and ease of transport rather than aesthetic qualities.

During the steamer trunk restoration process when the inside paper covering is removed, dated notes in lead pencil made by the original craftsman may be found, as well as the circular saw blade impressions made on the rough-cut wood at the saw mill, both of which give added character and value to the restored trunk.

==Types of tray compartments==
There were numerous tray and lid compartments in Victorian trunks, ranging from basic to complex. A basic tray system comprised a hat box, a shirt compartment, a coin box, and a document box. A complex tray system, however, could consist two hat boxes, several other shirt compartments, a coin box, several document boxes and even secret compartments strategically placed so that people of unwanted access would pass up if not wary. Beautiful lithographs would be placed over the lids or dome of the trunk and truly capture the Victorian aesthetic of that day. There were numerous chromolithographs that a trunk maker could use, and they could be indicative of who the trunk was intended for, such as ladies or men. A bride&#x27;s chest usually had a lot of floral pictures or lithographs of other ladies, while men&#x27;s had pictures of &quot;village&quot; or country scenes. It was up to the malletier what to put on the lids and trays.

<text>A push–pull amplifier is a type of electronic circuit that uses a pair of active devices that alternately supply current to, or absorb current from, a connected load. This kind of amplifier can enhance both the load capacity and switching speed.

Push–pull outputs are present in TTL and CMOS digital logic circuits and in some types of amplifiers, and are usually realized by a complementary pair of transistors, one dissipating or &quot;sinking&quot; current from the load to ground or a negative power supply, and the other supplying or &quot;sourcing&quot; current to the load from a positive power supply.

A push–pull amplifier is more efficient than a single-ended &quot;class-A&quot; amplifier. The output power that can be achieved is higher than the continuous dissipation rating of either transistor or tube used alone and increases the power available for a given supply voltage. Symmetrical construction of the two sides of the amplifier means that even-order harmonics are cancelled, which can reduce distortion. DC current is cancelled in the output, allowing a smaller output transformer to be used than in a single-ended amplifier. However, the push–pull amplifier requires a phase-splitting component that adds complexity and cost to the system; use of center-tapped transformers for input and output is a common technique but adds weight and restricts performance. If the two parts of the amplifier do not have identical characteristics, distortion can be introduced as the two halves of the input waveform are amplified unequally. Crossover distortion can be created near the zero point of each cycle as one device is cut off and the other device enters its active region.


Push–pull circuits are widely used in many amplifier output stages. A pair of audion tubes connected in push–pull is described in Edwin H. Colpitts&#x27; US patent 1137384 granted in 1915, although the patent does not specifically claim the push–pull connection. The technique was well known at that time and the principle had been claimed in an 1895 patent predating electronic amplifiers. Possibly the first commercial product using a push–pull amplifier was the RCA &quot;Balanced amplifier&quot; released in 1924 for use with their Radiola III regenerative broadcast receiver. By using a pair of low-power vacuum tubes in push–pull configuration, the amplifier allowed the use of a loudspeaker instead of headphones, while providing acceptable battery life with low standby power consumption. The technique continues to be used in audio, radio frequency, digital and power electronics systems today.

== Digital circuits ==
A digital use of a push–pull configuration is the output of TTL and related families. The upper transistor is functioning as an active pull-up, in linear mode, while the lower transistor works digitally. For this reason they are not capable of sourcing as much current as they can &quot;sink&quot; (typically 20 times less). Because of the way these circuits are drawn schematically, with two transistors stacked vertically, normally with a level shifting diode in between, they are called &quot;totem pole&quot; outputs.

A disadvantage of simple push–pull outputs is that two or more of them cannot be connected together, because if one tried to pull while another tried to push, the transistors could be damaged. To avoid this restriction, some push–pull outputs have a third state in which both transistors are switched off. In this state, the output is said to be &quot;floating&quot; (or, to use a proprietary term, &quot;tri-stated&quot;).

An alternative to push–pull output is a single switch that disconnects or connects the load to ground (called an open collector or open drain output), or a single switch that disconnects or connects the load to the power supply (called an open-emitter or open-source output).

== Analog circuits ==
A conventional amplifier stage which is not push–pull is sometimes called single-ended to distinguish it from a push–pull circuit.

In analog push–pull power amplifiers the two output devices operate in antiphase (i.e. 180° apart). The two antiphase outputs are connected to the load in a way that causes the signal outputs to be added, but distortion components due to non-linearity in the output devices to be subtracted from each other; if the non-linearity of both output devices is similar, distortion is much reduced. Symmetrical push–pull circuits must cancel even order harmonics, like 2f, 4f, 6f and therefore promote odd order harmonics, like f, 3f, 5f when driven into the nonlinear range.

A push–pull amplifier produces less distortion than a single-ended one. This allows a class-A or AB push–pull amplifier to have less distortion for the same power as the same devices used in single-ended configuration. Distortion can occur at the moment the outputs switch: the &quot;hand-off&quot; is not perfect. This is called crossover distortion. Class AB and class B dissipate less power for the same output than class A; general distortion can be kept low by negative feedback, and crossover distortion can be reduced by adding a &#x27;bias current&#x27; to smoothen the hand-off.

A class-B push–pull amplifier is more efficient than a class-A power amplifier because each output device amplifies only half the output waveform and is cut off during the opposite half. It can be shown that the theoretical full power efficiency (AC power in load compared to DC power consumed) of a push–pull stage is approximately 78.5%. This compares with a class-A amplifier which has efficiency of 25% if directly driving the load and no more than 50% for a transformer coupled output. A push–pull amplifier draws little power with zero signal, compared to a class-A amplifier that draws constant power. Power dissipation in the output devices is roughly one-fifth of the output power rating of the amplifier. A class-A amplifier, by contrast, must use a device capable of dissipating several times the output power.

The output of the amplifier may be direct-coupled to the load, coupled by a transformer, or connected through a dc blocking capacitor. Where both positive and negative power supplies are used, the load can be returned to the midpoint (ground) of the power supplies. A transformer allows a single polarity power supply to be used, but limits the low-frequency response of the amplifier. Similarly, with a single power supply, a capacitor can be used to block the DC level at the output of the amplifier.

Where bipolar junction transistors are used, the bias network must compensate for the negative temperature coefficient of the transistors&#x27; base to emitter voltage. This can be done by including a small value resistor between emitter and output. Also, the driving circuit can have silicon diodes mounted in thermal contact with the output transistors to provide compensation.
=== Push–pull transistor output stages ===
Categories include:

==== Transformer-output transistor power amplifiers ====
It is now very rare to use output transformers with transistor amplifiers, although such amplifiers offer the best opportunity for matching the output devices (with only PNP or only NPN devices required).

==== Totem pole push–pull output stages ====
Two matched transistors of the same polarity can be arranged to supply opposite halves of each cycle without the need for an output transformer, although in doing so the driver circuit often is asymmetric and one transistor will be used in a common-emitter configuration while the other is used as an emitter follower. This arrangement is less used today than during the 1970s; it can be implemented with few transistors (not so important today) but is relatively difficult to balance and to keep a low distortion.

==== Symmetrical push–pull ====
Each half of the output pair &quot;mirror&quot; the other, in that an NPN (or N-Channel FET) device in one half will be matched by a PNP (or P-Channel FET) in the other. This type of arrangement tends to give lower distortion than quasi-symmetric stages because even harmonics are cancelled more effectively with greater symmetry.

==== Quasi-symmetrical push–pull ====
In the past when good quality PNP complements for high power NPN silicon transistors were limited, a workaround was to use identical NPN output devices, but fed from complementary PNP and NPN driver circuits in such a way that the combination was close to being symmetrical (but never as good as having symmetry throughout). Distortion due to mismatched gain on each half of the cycle could be a significant problem.

==== Super-symmetric output stages ====
Employing some duplication in the whole driver circuit, to allow symmetrical drive circuits can improve matching further, although driver asymmetry is a small fraction of the distortion generating process. Using a bridge-tied load arrangement allows a much greater degree of matching between positive and negative halves, compensating for the inevitable small differences between NPN and PNP devices.

==== Square-law push–pull ====
The output devices, usually MOSFETs or vacuum tubes, are configured so that their square-law transfer characteristics (that generate second-harmonic distortion if used in a single-ended circuit) cancel distortion to a large extent. That is, as one transistor&#x27;s gate-source voltage increases, the drive to the other device is reduced by the same amount and the drain (or plate) current change in the second device approximately corrects for the non-linearity in the increase of the first.

=== Push–pull tube (valve) output stages ===

Vacuum tubes (valves) are not available in complementary types (as are PNP/NPN transistors), so the tube push–pull amplifier has a pair of identical output tubes or groups of tubes with the control grids driven in antiphase. These tubes drive current through the two halves of the primary winding of a center-tapped output transformer. Signal currents add, while the distortion signals due to the non-linear characteristic curves of the tubes subtract. These amplifiers were first designed long before the development of solid-state electronic devices; they are still in use by both audiophiles and musicians who consider them to sound better.

Vacuum tube push–pull amplifiers usually use an output transformer, although Output-transformerless (OTL) tube stages exist (such as the SEPP/SRPP and the White Cathode Follower below). The phase-splitter stage is usually another vacuum tube but a transformer with a center-tapped secondary winding was occasionally used in some designs. Because these are essentially square-law devices, the comments regarding distortion cancellation mentioned above apply to most push–pull tube designs when operated in class A (i.e. neither device is driven to its non-conducting state).

A Single Ended Push–Pull (SEPP, SRPP or mu-follower) output stage, originally called the Series-Balanced amplifier (US patent 2,310,342, Feb 1943). is similar to a totem-pole arrangement for transistors in that two devices are in series between the power supply rails, but the input drive goes &quot;only to one of the devices,&quot; the bottom one of the pair; hence the (seemingly contradictory) Single-Ended description. The output is taken from the cathode of the top (not directly driven) device, which acts part way between a constant current source and a cathode follower but receiving some drive from the plate (anode) circuit of the bottom device. The drive to each tube therefore might not be equal, but the circuit tends to keep the current through the bottom device somewhat constant throughout the signal, increasing the power gain and reducing distortion compared with a true single-tube single-ended output stage.

The transformer-less circuit with two tetrode tubes dates back to 1933: &quot;THE USE OF A VACUUM TUBE AS A PLATE-FEED IMPEDANCE.&quot; by J.W.Horton in the Journal of the Franklin Institute 1933 volume 216 Issue 6

The White Cathode Follower (Patent 2,358,428, Sep. 1944 by E. L. C. White) is similar to the SEPP design above, but the signal input is to the &quot;top&quot; tube, acting as a cathode follower, but one where the bottom tube (in common cathode configuration) if fed (usually via a step-up transformer) from the current in the plate (anode) of the top device. It essentially reverses the roles of the two devices in SEPP. The bottom tube acts part way between a constant current sink and an equal partner in the push–pull workload. Again, the drive to each tube therefore might not be equal.

Transistor versions of the SEPP and White follower do exist, but are rare.

==== Ultra-linear push–pull ====
A so-called ultra-linear push–pull amplifier uses either pentodes or tetrodes with their screen grid fed from a percentage of the primary voltage on the output transformer. This gives efficiency and distortion that is a good compromise between triode (or triode-strapped) power amplifier circuits and conventional pentode or tetrode output circuits where the screen is fed from a relatively constant voltage source.

<doc id="856800" wikidata="Q37810383" url="?curid=856800" title="Wheatpaste">
<text>Wheatpaste (also known as flour and water paste, flour paste, or simply paste) is a gel or liquid adhesive made from wheat flour or starch and water. It has been used since antiquity for various arts and crafts such as bookbinding, &quot;découpage&quot;, collage, papier-mâché, and adhering paper posters and notices to walls.

==Types==
A critical difference among wheat pastes is the division between those made from flour and those made from starch. Vegetable flours contain both gluten and starch. Over time the gluten in a flour paste cross-links, making it very difficult to release the adhesive. Using only starch, a fine quality, fully reversible paste can be produced. The latter is the standard adhesive for paper conservation.

Besides wheat, other vegetables also are processed into flours and starches from which pastes can be made: characteristics, such as strength and reversibility, vary with the plant species; manufacturer&#x27;s processing; and the recipe of the end-user.

== Uses ==

A common use is to make chains of paper rings, often from colored construction paper. It can also be used to create papier-mâché. In the fine arts, wheat starch paste is often used in preparation and presentation. A good wheat starch paste has a strength compatible with many paper artifacts, remains reversible over time, is neither too acidic or alkaline, and is white.

Activists and various subculture proponents often use this adhesive to flypost propaganda and artwork. It has also commonly been used by commercial bill posters since the nineteenth century. In particular, it was widely used by nineteenth and twentieth century circus bill posters, who developed a substantial culture around paste manufacture and postering campaigns. In the field of alcohol and nightclub advertising, in the 1890s, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec&#x27;s posters were so popular that instructions were published on how to peel down the pasted posters without damage.

Until the 1970s, commercial poster hangers always &quot;cooked&quot; their own paste, but since then many have bought pre-cooked instant pastes. It is applied to the backside of paper then placed on flat surfaces, particularly concrete and metal as it does not adhere well to wood or plastic. Cheap, rough paper such as newsprint, works well, as it can be briefly dipped in the mixture to saturate the fibres.

When hanging unauthorized billboards or signage, to reduce the danger of being caught, wheatpasters frequently work in teams or affinity groups. In the United States and Canada, this process is typically called &quot;wheatpasting&quot; or &quot;poster bombing&quot;, even when using commercial wallpaper paste instead of traditional wheat paste. In the United Kingdom, commercial wheatpasting is called flyposting and wheatpasting associated with urban art is called paste up.

<text>Aimé Bénard (November 21, 1873 – January 8, 1938) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as interim leader of the provincial Conservatives in 1915, and was later appointed to the Senate of Canada.

==Life and career==
Bénard was born in Henryville, Quebec, and was educated at the normal school in that community. He later moved to Manitoba, and worked as a financial agent. He was first elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba in the 1907 provincial election, defeating Liberal incumbent Joseph H. Prefontaine by 339 votes. The Conservatives won this election, and Bénard served in the legislature as a government backbencher. He was re-elected for Assiniboia in the 1910 election, and for Iberville in the 1914 campaign.

Conservative premier Rodmond Roblin was forced to resign in 1915, amid a serious corruption scandal. Another election was called, which the Liberals won with a landslide majority. Bénard was one of only five Tories returned to the legislature. His re-election was primarily due to the Conservative Party&#x27;s continued popularity in francophone areas of the province. The Conservatives were more supportive of francophone education rights than the Liberals, and received support from this community; four of the party&#x27;s five legislators were francophone.

Bénard was chosen as the Conservative Party&#x27;s interim leader shortly after the election. The party chose another francophone, Albert Prefontaine, as its house leader in 1916.

Bénard was appointed to the Canadian Senate on September 3, 1917, on the recommendation of Prime Minister Robert Borden. He served in the Senate until his death.

<text>Khariton Prokofievich Laptev (; 1700–1763) was a Russian naval officer and Arctic explorer.

==Biography==
Khariton Laptev was born in a gentry family, Laptev family which was a branch of the Lopukhin family, in the village of Pokarevo near Velikiye Luki (in the southern part of today&#x27;s Pskov Oblast), just a year before his cousin Dmitry Laptev was born in the nearby village of Bolotovo.

Khariton Laptev started his career in the Russian Navy as a cadet in 1718. By 1730, he was already in charge of a military ship, and in 1734 participated in the siege of Gdańsk.

In 1739–1742, Khariton Laptev led one of the parties of the Second Kamchatka expedition. Together with Semion Chelyuskin, N. Chekin, and G. Medvedev, Laptev described the Taimyr Peninsula from the mouth of the Khatanga River to the mouth of the Pyasina river and discovered a few of the islands in the area. After the expedition, he participated in the creation of the &quot;General Map of the Siberian and Kamchatka Coast&quot;, and continued his military service in the Baltic Fleet. The sea coastline of the Taimyr Peninsula, a cape on the Chelyuskin Peninsula and other landmarks bear his name. The Laptev Sea was also named after him (and his cousin Dmitry Laptev). The 1962-built icebreaker &quot;Ledokol-3&quot; was renamed &quot;Khariton Laptev&quot; in 1966 in his honor.

<doc id="856808" wikidata="Q1940733" url="?curid=856808" title="Mean arterial pressure">
<text>In medicine, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) is an average calculated blood pressure in an individual during a single cardiac cycle. Although methods of estimating MAP vary, a common calculation is to take one-third of the pulse pressure (the difference between the systolic and diastolic pressures), and add that amount to the diastolic pressure. A normal MAP is about 90 mmHg.

MAP is altered by cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance. It is used clinically to estimate the risk of cardiovascular diseases, where a MAP of 90 mmHg or less is low risk, and a MAP of greater than 96 mmHg represents &quot;stage one hypertension&quot; with increased risk.

== Testing ==

Mean arterial pressure can be measured directly or estimate from systolic and diastolic blood pressure by using a formula. The least invasive method is the use of a blood pressure cuff which gives the values to calculate an estimate of the mean pressure. A similar method is to use a oscillometric blood pressure device that works by a cuff only method where a microprocessor determines the systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Invasively, an arterial catheter with a transducer is placed and the mean pressure is determined by the subsequent waveform.

==Estimating MAP==

While MAP can only be measured directly by invasive monitoring, it can be estimated by using a formula in which the lower (diastolic) blood pressure is doubled and added to the higher (systolic) blood pressure and that composite sum then is divided by 3 to estimate MAP.

formula_1

Thus, a common way to estimate mean arterial pressure is to take one-third of the pulse pressure added to the diastolic pressure:

formula_2

where: 

* DP = diastolic pressure
* SP = systolic pressure
* MAP = mean arterial pressure

Systolic pressure minus diastolic pressure equals the pulse pressure which may be substituted in.

Another way to find the MAP is to use the systemic vascular resistance equated (formula_3), which is represented mathematically by the formula 
:formula_4 
where formula_5 is the change in pressure across the systemic circulation from its beginning to its end and formula_6 is the flow through the vasculature (equal to cardiac output).

In other words:

formula_7

Therefore, MAP can be determined by rearranging the equation to:
:formula_8
where:
*formula_9 is cardiac output
*formula_10 is systemic vascular resistance
*formula_11 is central venous pressure and usually is small enough to be neglected in this formula.

formula_12

This is only valid at normal resting heart rates during which formula_13 can be approximated using the measured systolic (formula_14) and diastolic (formula_15) blood pressures.

=== Elevated heart rate ===
At high heart rates formula_13 is more closely approximated by the arithmetic mean of systolic and diastolic pressures because of the change in shape of the arterial pressure pulse.

For a more accurate formula of formula_13 for elevated heart rates use:

: formula_18

Where 

* HR = heart rate.
* DP = diastolic pressure
* MAP = mean arterial pressure
* PP = pulse pressure which is systolic minus diastolic pressure

=== Most accurate ===
The version of the MAP equation multiplying 0.412 by pulse pressure and adding diastolic blood is indicated to correlate better than other versions of the equation with left ventricular hypertrophy, carotid wall thickness and aortic stiffness. It is expressed:

formula_19

where:

* DBP = diastolic pressure
* MAP = mean arterial pressure
* PP = pulse pressure

=== Young patients ===
For young patients with congenital heart disease a slight alteration to the factor used found to be more precise. This was written as:

formula_20

where:

*DBP = diastolic pressure
* MAP = mean arterial pressure
* PP = pulse pressure

This added precision means cerebral blood flow can be more accurately maintained in uncontrolled hypertension.

=== Neonates ===
For neonates, because of their altered physiology, a different formula has been proposed for a more precise reading:

formula_21

where:

*DBP = diastolic pressure
* MAP = mean arterial pressure
* PP = pulse pressure

It has also been suggested that when getting readings from a neonates radial arterial line, mean arterial pressure can be approximated by averaging the systolic and diastolic pressure.

=== Other formula versions ===
Other formulas used to estimate mean arterial pressure are:

formula_22

or

formula_23

or

formula_24

or

formula_25

* MAP = mean arterial pressure
* PP = pulse pressure
* DAP = diastolic aortic pressure
* DPB = diastolic blood pressure

==Clinical significance==
Mean arterial pressure is a major determinant of the perfusion pressure seen by organs in the body. MAP levels greater than 90 mmHg increase the risk stepwise of having higher risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as stroke, and mortality.

=== Hypotension ===
When assessing hypotension, the context of the baseline blood pressure needs to be considered. Acute decreases in mean arterial pressure of around 25% put people at increased risk for organ damage and potential mortality. Even one minute at a MAP of 50 mmHg, or accumulative effects over short periods, increases the risk of mortality by 5%, and can result in organ failure or complications.

In people hospitalized with shock, a MAP of 65 mmHg lasting for more than two hours was associated with higher mortality. In people with sepsis, the vasopressor dosage may be titrated on the basis of estimated MAP.

MAP may be used like systolic blood pressure in monitoring and treating target blood pressure. Both are used as targets for assessing sepsis, major trauma, stroke, and intracranial bleeding. 

=== Hypertension ===
In younger people, elevated MAP is used more commonly than pulse pressure in the prediction of stroke. However in older people, MAP is less predictive of stroke and a better predictor of cardiovascular disease.

<text>USS &quot;Uhlmann&quot; (DD-687) was a in the service of the United States Navy from 1943 to 1946 and from 1950 to 1972. She was scrapped in 1974.

==Namesake==

 was born on 16 August 1919 at Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He attended the College of Engineering, University of Michigan, from 1937 until 1940. In September 1940, he enlisted in the United States Naval Reserve as an apprentice seaman and, during November and December, trained on the . Following his appointment as a midshipman in the Naval Reserve on 17 March 1941, he trained at the Midshipman School, Northwestern University, Chicago, Illinois and on 12 June 1941 was commissioned ensign. After additional training, he reported to Patrol Squadron 24 on 1 August 1941. This squadron, a part of Patrol Wing 2 stationed at Naval Air Station Kaneohe Bay, was redesignated Patrol Squadron 12 (VP-12) in October 1941.

On the morning of 7 December 1941, during the Attack on Pearl Harbor, nine Imperial Japanese Navy fighters circled low over the airfield at Kaneohe and then attacked, machine-gunning the control tower and leaving planes in flames in the bay and on the ramp. The men of VP-12 returned fire with only rifles and machine guns. A short time later, a second wave of enemy planes flew over, bombing hangars and planes and destroying the hangar where many members of VP-12 were obtaining replenishment ammunition for machine guns. Additional strafing attacks followed; and, before the morning was over, eight patrol bomber seaplanes were destroyed, and all 35 planes which had been on the ground when the attack began were out of commission. Air station personnel shot down two Japanese planes and scored hits on the fuel tanks of seven others. Uhlmann was killed in the attack.

==Service history==
&quot;Uhlmann&quot; was laid down on 6 March 1943 at Staten Island, New York, by the Bethlehem Steel Co. and launched on 30 July 1943; sponsored by Mrs. C. F. Uhlmann, mother of Ens. Uhlmann. The ship was commissioned on 22 November 1943 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, Commander Selden G. Hooper in command.

===1944===
After shakedown out of Bermuda and post-shakedown availability, the destroyer joined Destroyer Squadron 56 on 24 January 1944. Two days later, she got underway to escort to Trinidad. She then transited the Panama Canal, touched at San Diego, California, and arrived at San Francisco, California on 16 February. There, she embarked passengers for transportation to Hawaii and departed the west coast on 17 February in company with and .

She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 23 February. During March, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; underwent availability, conducted training, and rendered occasional convoy screening services in Hawaiian waters. In April, she conducted carrier escort training exercises and honed her skills in shore bombardment and radar tracking in preparation for assignment to carrier screening duties. Two hours after sunset on 24 April, while &quot;Uhlmann&quot; was participating in training exercises in Hawaiian waters as an antisubmarine screening ship for the carriers of Task Group 19.2, she was struck amidships by destroyer . The collision tore an hole in &quot;Uhlmann&quot;″s hull below the water line, flooding her firerooms and the forward engine room. The following day, she was taken in tow by and returned to Pearl Harbor on 26 April. After temporary hull and engine repairs, she set her course for San Francisco on 17 May, steaming on her port engine with her forward fire and engine rooms out of commission. On 24 May, she moored at Hunter&#x27;s Point and, for the next two months, underwent extensive repairs.

In August, she returned to Pearl Harbor and resumed training exercises including torpedo firing and antisubmarine warfare drills. After one false start, she departed Oahu on 18 September with and and set her course for the Admiralty Islands. En route to Manus, she was diverted to the western Caroline Islands and reported to 3d Fleet at Ulithi on 30 September. During a typhoon on 3 October, a nest of three destroyers drifted down on &quot;Uhlmann&quot; and pierced three holes in her starboard side. A few hours later, the destroyer made an emergency sortie from the lagoon with Task Group 38.2; but, by nightfall, high seas had carried away her emergency damage control measures and flooded the anchor windlass room. She returned to Ulithi on 4 October for repairs by and, on 6 October, was underway for an at-sea rendezvous with Task Force 38—the 3d Fleet&#x27;s Fast Carrier Force—the following day.

At noon on 9 October, the carriers began a high-speed approach to a launch position for strikes on the Ryukyus. On 10 October, planes launched by the carriers struck Okinawa, destroying enemy aircraft, shipping, and shore installations in preparation for the projected landings on Leyte, Cebu, and Negros.

After fueling at sea on 11 October, TF 38 began a high-speed approach on Taiwan for two days of strikes on that island, again in support of the impending American assault on the Philippines. On 12 and 13 October, as the carriers steamed 85 miles (137 km) east of Taiwan and launched strike after strike against that island, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; operated in their antiaircraft screen. Planes from the carriers attempted to destroy Japanese air strength on Taiwan to eliminate that island as a staging base for the enemy.

Shortly after dusk on 12 October, low flying Japanese bombers and torpedo planes approached Task Group 38.2 from the west and northwest. Although most of the Japanese planes were intercepted by the task force&#x27;s combat air patrol, more than a dozen broke through and attacked the formation. &quot;Uhlmann&quot; opened fire on a Japanese medium torpedo bomber at . However, undeterred, the plane continued to approach the zigzagging destroyer from port until it was hit at close range by &quot;Uhlmann&quot;″s 40-millimeter fire, crossed over the ship, and splashed off the destroyer&#x27;s starboard bow. The plane sank at once leaving a large quantity of gas and oil floating on the sea.

A second wave of attackers followed two minutes after the first, and &quot;Uhlmann&quot;, maneuvering with the formation, joined in the fire which downed some seven Japanese raiders during the night. At 2200, she hit an enemy plane which burst into flame and illuminated the moonless overcast night before splashing off the stern of the ship. Minutes before midnight, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; picked up another aerial intruder on radar and opened up with 5-inch fire. The plane countered by dropping flares as a diversionary tactic and pulled away, but &quot;Uhlmann&quot;″s deadly fire found its mark as the raider burst into flame and splashed into the sea. The destroyers began laying smoke around midnight, and the raids tapered off. For the remainder of the night, Japanese planes merely approached within 6 to 7 miles (10 to 11 km), dropped flares, and retired without attacking the formation.

Japanese planes again ventured near the formation late on 14 October only to be routed by night fliers of the combat air patrol. The next day, TF 38 began a high-speed run in for strikes on Luzon, with &quot;Uhlmann&quot; providing antisubmarine protection for the fast carriers of TG 38.2. On 16 and 17 October, the carriers launched heavy strikes on Luzon concentrating on ships and installations in the Manila Bay area. Late on 17 October, the formation set a southerly course to get into position for strikes farther south, with the fighter planes of the task force dispersing light Japanese air opposition en route. Steaming east and northeast of Samar, the task force made strikes on Negros on 20 October in strategic support of the landings on Leyte and also provided direct air support for those landings.

Meanwhile, upon first sighting American minesweepers in the approaches to Leyte Gulf, Japan had sent her naval forces into Philippine waters. On 24 October, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; protected the carriers of Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan&#x27;s TG 38.2 as they launched strikes against the Japanese Center Force which was approaching San Bernardino Strait. In an action known as the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea, American naval aircraft sank Japanese battleship and damaged several other enemy warships. At 2022 that evening, Task Force 38 turned north to seek out and destroy the Japanese Northern Force whose carriers had been spotted north of Luzon where they had been stationed in the hope of luring the 3d Fleet away from the beaches of Leyte.

However, a gallant group of American destroyers, destroyer escorts, and escort carriers had fought off the overwhelmingly superior Japanese Center Force and induced it to abandon its plan of attacking the amphibious ships which were supporting the Allied beachheads on Leyte. Thus, when TG 34.5 returned within aircraft range of San Bernardino Strait, the chastened Japanese Center Force had already retreated back through that strategic passage to safety. In the days that followed the historic Battle of Leyte Gulf, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; continued to screen TG 38.2 while its carriers conducted strikes on land targets, including raids on Luzon on 29 and 30 October. Shortly before noon on 29 October, as the carriers recovered aircraft from a strike against Japanese targets in the Manila area, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; left the formation to investigate what appeared to be the splash of a downed plane but was later determined to be a bomb splash. As the destroyer attempted to discover the cause of the splash, a Navy torpedo bomber from made a water landing nearby, and &quot;Uhlmann&quot; quickly rescued the pilot and two crewmen. Meanwhile, an enemy attack had materialized, and the destroyer went to general quarters, increased her speed to , and executed evasive maneuvers as she attempted to rejoin the formation. As she steamed to her assigned position, she joined in the general fire against the attackers—10 to 12 Japanese planes which made notably inaccurate high altitude bombing runs and retired after one or two of their members had been splashed by the American ships&#x27; accurate fire.

On 4 November, TF 38.2 began a high-speed approach for strikes on Luzon. For two days, carrier-based aircraft pounded Luzon and Bicol. Then, on 7 November, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; set her course for Ulithi. En route, heavy seas caused flooding in the boatswain&#x27;s stores and chain locker; and &quot;Uhlmann&quot;, accompanied by , left the formation and ran with the wind while damage-control measures were being effected. She arrived at Ulithi on 9 November, underwent repairs, and got underway again on 16 November. She rendezvoused with TG 38.2 the following day and took up an antisubmarine screening station. Following carrier strikes on Luzon on 19 November, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; returned to Ulithi on 22 November.

The destroyer conducted exercises out of Ulithi until 10 December when she got underway and rendezvoused with Task Force 38 on 12 November. From 14–16 December, the carriers made strikes against air installations on Luzon and against shipping in water off that island to support landings on Mindoro. Toward dusk on 16 December, the task force began its retirement. As the American warships fueled northeast of Samar on 17 December, weather conditions worsened. At 1330, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; abandoned fueling from due to rough seas and winds stirred up by an approaching typhoon. On 18 December, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; recorded winds, and rolls up to 58 degrees as the typhoon&#x27;s center passed within of the formation. During the afternoon, winds decreased; and, by 2000, they had subsided to . On 19 and 20 December, the ships of the battered task force resumed fueling which continued into the next day while its escorts searched for survivors of the three destroyers which had failed to survive the tropical storm. Late on 20 December, due to heavy seas, the carriers aborted a high-speed run in for strikes on Luzon; and &quot;Uhlmann&quot; returned to the storm area and searched for survivors. She made port at Ulithi on 24 December.

===1945===
Underway again with TG 38.1 on 30 December, she screened the carriers during strikes on Formosa and Luzon early in the new year and, an hour before midnight on 9 January 1945, transited Bashi Channel into the South China Sea. The carriers launched strikes on French Indochina, Taiwan, and Hong Kong before retiring from the South China Sea on 19 January. Steaming 75 miles (120 km) north of Luzon at dusk the next day, the formation came under attack by enemy aircraft, and &quot;Uhlmann&quot; joined other ships of the formation in repelling raiders. Following strikes on Formosa and Okinawa, TF 38 returned to Ulithi on 26 January. That day, the 3d Fleet was redesignated 5th Fleet and placed under the command of Admiral Raymond A. Spruance.

Following antisubmarine training, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; got underway from Ulithi with TG 58.2 on 10 February. During a Japanese air raid on 16 February, the first of two days of strikes on the Tokyo area, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; took under fire an enemy fighter which made a low-glide, diving attack on the ship&#x27;s port beam and dropped a bomb in the wake of destroyer . Neither destroyer suffered any damage in this exchange. On 19 February, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; screened TF 58 as it steamed north of Iwo Jima launching strikes on that island in support of the initial landings there. On 20 February, mechanical difficulties in her steering mechanism forced &quot;Uhlmann&quot; to part company with the task force, and she put in at Ulithi on 23 February for repairs. Underway on 14 March, she rendezvoused with TG 58.2 on 16 March. The next day, the carriers began a highspeed run in for strikes on Kyūshū. While the planes of TP 58 pounded that Japanese homeland, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; protected the carriers from air and submarine attack. Air activity began early on 18 March; and &quot;Uhlmann&quot;, acting as linking vessel between TF 58 and its picket line, began firing on aerial snoopers before dawn. Shortly before 0700, she joined the picket line and, at 0956, rescued three Navy aviators from a torpedo bomber which had splashed nearby.

Throughout the dav and into the night, alerts prompted by Japanese surveillance planes brought the ship&#x27;s crew to general quarters. Four minutes before midnight, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; opened fire on an enemy aircraft at . The plane burst into flame and splashed off the destroyer&#x27;s starboard quarter and burned brightly for several minutes. Air activity continued into the early hours of 19 March. Before dawn that day, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; joined in firing on a high-altitude Japanese raider which burst into flames and splashed. Fifty miles (80 km) off the eastern shore of Shikoku on the morning of 19 March, a Japanese plane dove toward the destroyer and, despite fire from the ship, dropped a small bomb which hit off the ship&#x27;s starboard quarter. No further action occurred that day as &quot;Uhlmann&quot;, screening TG 58.2, proceeded southward to rejoin the rest of TF 58 southeast of Kyūshū.

Ships of the task force began refueling on the 20th but were forced to discontinue when an air attack developed in mid-afternoon. &quot;Uhlmann&quot; was transferring aviation personnel to at 1453 when a &quot;kamikaze&quot; dove at carrier , missed, and crashed into &quot;Halsey Powell&quot;. &quot;Uhlmann&quot; fired on enemy dive bombers throughout the remainder of the afternoon, was hit by some shrapnel, but suffered no casualties. Air activity continued to be heavy as strikes on Japan continued on 21 March. During a surprise attack early in the afternoon, a bomb fell only from &quot;Cushing&quot;, and another bomb narrowly missed a carrier of the force. Ten minutes before midnight on 22 March, while &quot;Uhlmann&quot; steamed on picket station, she made a surface radar contact which was later identified as a Japanese submarine. In company with , she proceeded at high speed toward the submerging target and stood by while &quot;Haggard&quot; forced the enemy ship to the surface with depth charges. &quot;Haggard&quot; then rammed the submarine which exploded and sank. &quot;Uhlmann&quot; escorted the slightly damaged destroyer back to Ulithi where they arrived on 25 March.

She departed Ulithi on 30 March and set a northwesterly course. After weathering a typhoon on 2 April, she rendezvoused with TG 58.4 on 5 April and, toward dusk, began an approach for strikes on Okinawa. Following rendezvous with TF 58, she alternated radar picket and screening duties as the carrier-based planes pounded Okinawa.

In April, Japan began concentrated massed kamikaze attacks against American ships in the waters of the Ryukyus; and the carrier forces, despite their discreet distance from Okinawa, were not exempt from the attentions of the &quot;kamikazes&quot;. On 12 April, combat air patrol from the formation splashed three Mitsubishi A6M Zeroes (&quot;Zekes&quot;) within sight of &quot;Uhlmann&quot; as she stood her picket station 25 miles (40 km) north of TF 58. Two days later, snoopers and nuisance raiders kept the air patrol occupied in the afternoon and early evening.

On radar picket with TG 58.4 on 17 April, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; joined in fire that downed two enemy aircraft, one of which splashed near causing minor damage to that ship. That night, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; added her depth charges to a combined attack which sent to the bottom. Late on the afternoon of 29 April, as enemy planes began closing from the northward, destroyer &quot;Haggard&quot; joined &quot;Uhlman&quot; to strengthen the picket station in the face of attack. Minutes before 1700, a Japanese fighter plane, taken under fire by &quot;Uhlmann&quot;, nosed over and dove toward &quot;Haggard&quot;. The crash and explosion of the &quot;kamikaze&quot; and its bomb tore a hole in &quot;Haggard&quot;″s starboard side, flooding her firerooms and number one engine room, and leaving her dead in the water. Meanwhile, a second &quot;Zeke&quot; began a run in. &quot;Uhlmann&quot; splashed the attacker close aboard &quot;Haggard&quot; and rescued two of the damaged destroyer&#x27;s crew from the water. &quot;Uhlmann&quot; then requested assistance from the task group which responded with a combat air patrol of two divisions. An hour later, light cruiser and Destroyer Division 104 came to the aid of the stricken destroyer. &quot;Uhlmann&quot; escorted &quot;Haggard&quot; a short distance toward Kerama Retto and returned to her picket duty the next day. She screened the carrier strike force until 11 May when she headed for the Caroline Islands. The ship arrived at Ulithi on the 14th.

Underway with TG 58.4 on 24 May, the destroyer returned to a strike launch area off Okinawa and resumed her picket duties. On 28 May, operational control of the task force was returned to the 3d Fleet and TG 58.4 became TG 38.4. &quot;Uhlmann&quot; continued patrolling picket station and screening the fast carriers until 13 June when she arrived at San Pedro Bay, Leyte, for replenishment and maintenance. On 1 July, she set a northerly course; and, throughout July, the carriers conducted strikes on targets in the Japanese islands to soften up this last stronghold of Japanese power for the projected invasion. On 25 May, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; joined specially formed TG 35.3 for an antishipping sweep across Kii Suido between Honshū and Shikoku. Two hours after midnight on this completely overcast night, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; bombarded a radio tower on the southern tip of Uwano Hanto while other ships of the group shelled nearby airfields.

Until the cessation of hostilities on 15 August, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; continued to operate with the carrier force as it launched strikes against Japan. On 23 August, she rendezvoused with TF 47—a combined British-American force—for temporary escort duty in connection with the occupation of Japan. She arrived in Sagami Wan on 27 August, and immediately manned a picket station. On 30 August, while acting as plane guard for , she rescued that carrier&#x27;s landing signal officer who had jumped over the side in an attempt to rescue the pilot of a downed plane. That same day, the destroyer anchored in Sagami Wan, ending 61 days of continuous operation and, on 31 August, shifted anchorages to Tokyo Bay.

Her occupation duties included mail, freight, and passenger runs between Iwo Jima and Japanese ports. Late in October, she participated in training exercises; then, on 31 October, departed Yokosuka, steamed via Pearl Harbor, and arrived at Bremerton late in November. Following alterations, she got underway on 20 April 1946 and arrived at San Diego on 24 April. There, on 14 June 1946, she was decommissioned and placed in reserve. On 12 August, she was assigned to the Naval Reserve Training Program and underwent an overhaul at Terminal Island before reporting to the Commandant, 11th Naval District, in November 1946.

Operating out of San Diego, she trained reserve crews until the end of the decade. On 23 May 1950, she was recommissioned, but remained in reserve and, that summer, made a southward voyage, visiting Central and South American ports. She returned to San Diego in July and, on 18 November, was assigned active status.

===Korean War===

On 27 January 1951, she reported to the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet, for duty and, on 16 June, departed San Diego with units of Destroyer Division 152, setting her course for Korean waters. Commander P.A. &quot;Tony&quot; Lilly was in command. Assigned to TF 77—the fast carrier force operating in the Sea of Japan—&quot;Uhlmann&quot; resumed the screening and plane guard duties which had occupied much of her time in World War II. She later joined TF 95, a blockade and escort force, and carried out day and night bombardment of the Korean coast. While conducting a routine observation patrol off Wonsan Harbor&#x27;s Hodo Peninsula on the morning of 20 August, the destroyer came under fire from seven enemy shore batteries. Gun flashes on the beach provided a warning only moments before shells began to fall from the destroyer. All hands went quickly to battle stations as &quot;Uhlmann&quot; commenced evasive maneuvers, increased to flank speed, and opened fire on the shore installations. In short order, she reduced the enemy on shore to two guns, while she steamed among near misses, some of which came as close as . Fragments from the shell explosions carried away a radio antenna during the half hour engagement. Ordered by TG 95.2 to break off the action, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; withdrew out of range of the shore batteries. Commander Lilly was awarded the Bronze Star with combat &quot;V&quot; for &quot;inflicting extensive damage upon the enemy&quot; and contributing &quot;immeasurably to the success of the siege of Wonsan&quot;. Lilly recalled another non-combat mission. &quot;We had one espionage mission. We took three or four South Koreans up north and put them ashore near Hungnam in North Korea from our whaleboat at night. We went back some time later to pick them back up and got only one returning who was injured.&quot;

In the fall, she patrolled Taiwanese waters and participated in hunter-killer antisubmarine training off Okinawa. In November, she rejoined TF 77 and, operating in the Sea of Japan, rescued several pilots before leaving Yokosuka on 22 January 1952.

She returned to San Diego on 6 February and, in the months that followed, underwent drydocking and alterations which included the installation of new armament. She conducted exercises; then departed San Diego on 11 August 1952 in company with Destroyer Division 152, escorting and to the Far East.

During this seven-month Korean deployment, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; operated with fast carrier forces, conducted hunter-killer activities, and patrolled off Taiwan. She also conducted shore bombardment which destroyed enemy gun emplacements, a factory, and storage facilities, while damaging buildings, bunkers, and railways. On the morning of 3 November, as she was firing interdiction rounds on a railroad and tunnel on the east coast of North Korea near Hangwon, the destroyer was taken under fire by shore guns, mortars, and machine guns. Brought to alert by shell splashes only 100 yards (91 m) off her port bow, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; accelerated to 25 knots (46 km/h), began evasive maneuvers, and opened fire with her and guns. She scored a direct hit on an enemy gun emplacement and suffered only minor damages in the exchange. However, she emerged from the encounter with 13 wounded. After putting in at Hong Kong over Christmas, she departed Yokosuka on 3 March 1953, steamed via Midway and Pearl Harbor, and arrived at San Diego on 19 March 1953.

===1953-1958===

Following exercises off the west coast, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; was again deployed to the western Pacific. She proceeded via the Hawaiian Islands, and she arrived at Yokosuka on 20 November 1953. During this seven-month tour, the destroyer plied waters off Japan and Korea and engaged in training and operations out of Yokosuka and Sasebo with TF 77. In February 1954, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; joined with elements of the French and British Far Eastern Fleets for Exercise &quot;Sonata&quot; which included extensive antisubmarine warfare training and visits to Philippine and Indochina ports. During March, she embarked personnel of the Nationalist Chinese Navy for training.

While patrolling Taiwan Strait in the first week of March, she assisted the grounded Chinese Nationalist merchant ship &quot;Kiang Shan&quot; which was stranded on an island in the Pescadores. In the course of a daring rescue of crewmen from the Chinese steamer, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; lost her whaleboat and bent her propellers, shafts, and rudder on reefs in the shallow water. After the successful completion of her mission, she put in at Kaohsiung on 5 March. To prevent vibration damage to her reduction gears, she was towed from that port on 11 March and, on 14 March, arrived at Subic Bay for repairs. On her return to San Diego, she resumed the stateside routine of upkeep and training.

Over the next 15 years, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; made 11 more deployments to the western Pacific (WestPac). On deployment to the Far East in 1954 with Destroyer Division 152, she took part in the evacuation of the Tachen Islands—located off Hangzhou Bay—in the American attempt to defuse the explosive situation which had developed between Nationalist China and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. In 1958, during a period of heightened tension over the Chinese offshore islands, the destroyer again supported American interests in the Far East. Between deployments, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; operated out of San Diego, participating in fleet exercises, receiving upkeep, and performing goodwill assignments.

===Vietnam War===
In the 1960s, trouble flared in the area formerly known as French Indochina; and &quot;Uhlmann&quot; served three more wartime tours in Pacific waters, this time off the coast of Vietnam. Her duties included gunfire support of land action, often coordinated by an airborne spotter, illumination missions, and routine bombardment assignments. Off Vietnam in 1965, she searched junks for contraband; supplied shore bombardment; and served as a plane guard for carrier . In 1968, a year of heavy fighting in the Republic of Vietnam, &quot;Uhlmann&quot; acted as a plane guard in the Gulf of Tonkin and fired 50 naval gunfire support missions off Huế.

In 1969, she participated in fleet exercises in Hawaiian waters; then, on 1 October, she returned to the west coast and assumed new duties as a Group I Naval Reserve Training Ship operating out of Tacoma, Washington. For the next three years, she conducted reserve training cruises out of that port and participated in fleet exercises. During Exercise &quot;Head Beagle&quot; in August 1970, she conducted intensive training in the Strait of Juan de Fuca and off the coast of Washington in conjunction with Canadian naval forces.

===Decommissioning===
The oldest commissioned destroyer in the Navy, she was found unfit for service on 24 November 1971; and, on 15 July 1972, &quot;Uhlmann&quot;, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s last &quot;Fletcher&quot;-class destroyer, was decommissioned at the Naval Reserve Center Pier, Tacoma. Her name was struck from the Navy List the same day, and she was transferred to the custody of the Inactive Ship Facility, Bremerton, for disposal. She was scrapped in 1974.

<text>Guy Rochon Owen (August 22, 1913 – April 21, 1952) was a Canadian figure skating champion.

Owen initially competed in the men&#x27;s individual figure skating event, winning the 1929 Canadian junior men&#x27;s singles championship. He went on to specialize in the &quot;Fours Event&quot; with great success. For five straight years between 1933 and 1937, Owen and his skating partners Margaret Davis, Prudence Holbrook, and Melville Rogers won the Fours Event at the Canadian National Figure Skating Championships plus they also captured the bi-annual North American Figure Skating Championship three successive times in 1933, 1935, and 1937.
In 1938 Guy Owen married Maribel Vinson, nine-time United States ladies figure skating champion, and settled in Berkeley, California. They had two daughters, Maribel Owen (1940–1961) and Laurence Owen (1944–1961).

Guy and Maribel Owen turned professional, earning a living as performers with ice skating shows such as the International Ice Skate Revue before setting up their own show. They divorced in 1949 and she and the daughters moved back east to the Boston area in 1952, where they lived with her recently widowed mother in Winchester.

During his final year, Owen worked in Spokane, Washington. While visiting his parents in Ottawa, Owen died at age 38 of a perforated ulcer on April 21, 1952. His ex-wife and daughters died nine years later in the Sabena 548 plane crash in Belgium, which killed the U.S. figure skating team in February 1961.

<text>Maribel Yerxa Vinson-Owen (née Vinson; October 12, 1911 – February 15, 1961) was an American figure skater and coach. She competed in the disciplines of ladies&#x27; singles and pair skating. As a single skater, she was the 1932 Olympic bronze medalist, a two-time World medalist (1928 silver, 1930 bronze), the 1937 North American champion, and a nine-time U.S. national champion. As a pair skater, she was the 1935 North American champion and four-time national champion with George Hill. She also won two national titles with Thornton Coolidge. She was the first female sportswriter at &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and continued competing and winning medals while working as a full-time reporter.

Vinson-Owen is tied with Michelle Kwan for the record in U.S. ladies&#x27; figure skating titles.

== Personal life==
Maribel Vinson was the daughter of Thomas and Gertrude Vinson of Winchester, Massachusetts. Both of her parents were figure skaters and Maribel was made an honorary member of the Cambridge Skating Club at birth.

A good student, Vinson studied at Radcliffe College, graduating in 1933, all the while pursuing an interest in ice skating. She married Canadian skater Guy Owen and they had two daughters, Maribel Yerxa Owen (1940) and Laurence Rochon Owen (1944). They divorced in 1949, and Guy Owen died three years later at age 38. Following her father&#x27;s death, also in 1952, she and her daughters moved back east to Winchester and lived with her mother. In February 1961, Maribel Vinson-Owen was killed along with both daughters in the Sabena Flight 548 crash in Belgium.

== Competitive career ==
Vinson began to take lessons with coach Willie Frick at the Boston Arena at the age of nine. She won the U.S. junior ladies&#x27; title at the age of 12.

From 1928 to 1937, Vinson won the women&#x27;s singles title at the U.S. Championships every year except for 1934. She also teamed up with Thornton L. Coolidge to win the U.S. pairs&#x27; title in 1928 and 1929, and with George E. B. Hill to win four titles in 1933, 1935, 1936, and 1937.

At the 1932 Winter Olympic Games in Lake Placid, New York, Vinson earned the bronze medal behind the Norwegian champion Sonja Henie and the Austrian runner up, Fritzi Burger. While still competing, in the 1930s, Vinson became the first woman sportswriter at the New York Times newspaper.

Following her retirement from amateur ice skating, Vinson toured professionally with her husband Guy Owen in shows.

==Coaching career==
Following the birth of her two daughters, Vinson-Owen began coaching in Berkeley, California. She divorced Owen in 1949 and after her father&#x27;s death in 1952, she lived in her native Winchester, Massachusetts, and coached at rinks in the Boston area. Her daughters developed a love for ice skating and she trained them in the sport.

Vinson-Owen coached Tenley Albright to five U.S. titles and then to the United States&#x27; first Olympic gold medal in ladies&#x27; singles. She also taught Frank Carroll, who himself went on to be one of America&#x27;s top skating instructors, coaching Michelle Kwan to her numerous world and national titles and Evan Lysacek to his Olympic gold medal.

During her lifetime, Vinson-Owen authored several books on her sport:
* &quot;Primer of Figure Skating&quot; – McGraw-Hill/Whittlesey House (1938)
* &quot;Advanced Figure Skating&quot; – McGraw-Hill/Whittlesey House (1940)
* &quot;The Fun of Figure Skating&quot; – Harper &amp; Brothers (1960)

In &quot;Primer of Figure Skating&quot;, Vinson devotes three-and-a-half pages to what female figure skaters should wear on the ice, which included the correct length and style of skirt, and credits the appeal of the sport to feminine interests in skating fashions. Figure skating historian and writer Ellyn Kestnbaum argues that &quot;Vinson points to several ways in which skating attire connotes (and permits) athleticism and also how it can attract the eye on the merits of its own design elements and by enhancing the visual appeal of the skater&#x27;s body&quot;. Kestnbaum also stated that female skaters should pay more attention to their appearance than men do.

At the 1961 U.S. Championships, her daughter and namesake, Maribel, won the national pair skating title with partner Dudley S. Richards, while her youngest daughter, 16-year-old Laurence, won the ladies&#x27; single title. It was the first time CBS broadcast the U.S. national championships on television and the Owen family became instant celebrities.

==Plane crash==

Vinson-Owen, as a coach, and her two daughters, as competitors, were all part of the United States team scheduled to appear at the 1961 World Championships in Prague, Czechoslovakia. They boarded Sabena Flight 548 at New York City&#x27;s Idlewild International Airport along with the rest of the American team. The overnight flight had a stopover scheduled for Brussels, Belgium and on its arrival in the clear mid-morning of February 15, the captain had to abort the approach and circle around for a second attempt to land on a different runway. The plane, a Boeing 707, never made it back to the airport; instead, it plunged into the wooded farmland of the village of Berg, Belgium, taking the lives of all 72 passengers and crew plus a farmer at work in his fields. All 18 members of the American figure skating team plus 16 of their relatives, friends, and coaches were among the dead.

The 1961 World Championships were canceled. The remains of Vinson-Owen and her daughters were brought home for interment in the Story Chapel Columbarium at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==
Vinson-Owen was inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame three times – in 1976 as a singles&#x27; skater, in 1994 with George E.B. Hill in the pairs&#x27; category, and in 2011 as a coach for the 1961 World Team. In 2001, she was inducted to the inaugural class of the Professional Skaters&#x27; Association Coaches Hall of Fame, which included the five coaches that perished beside her. In 2002, she was inducted in the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame. Her daughters were inducted into the U.S. Figure Skating Hall of Fame in 2011.

In Winchester, the Vinson-Owen elementary school was named in her and her daughters&#x27; honor.

<doc id="856828" wikidata="Q1262545" url="?curid=856828" title="Dual-Ghia">
<text>Dual-Ghia is a rare, short-lived, automobile make produced in the United States between 1956 and 1958. The idea for a sporty limited production car came from Eugene Casaroll, who controlled specialized vehicle builder Dual-Motors Corporation based in Detroit, Michigan; the name Dual-Ghia is representative of the collaborative efforts between the builder and Carrozzeria Ghia. 117 examples were built.

==Design==
The design for a luxurious sports car was to be a modified version of the Ghia-built 1954 and 1955 Dodge-based concept cars known as the Firearrow I, II, III, IV and the nearly production-ready Firebomb; which had all been designed by Luigi Segre with some possible influence from Virgil Exner. With so many cars designed along the same theme, Chrysler may well have intended to produce the Firebomb and/or the Chrysler Falcon as a response to the Ford Thunderbird and Chevrolet Corvette; for whatever reason neither made it to production. After gaining rights to the Firearrow/Firebomb design, Casaroll asked Ghia&#x27;s U.S. representative (and eventual Dual-Motors VP) Paul Farago to further develop the Firebomb into a production-friendly vehicle. The series-produced design utilized an even greater number of standard production MoPar fittings, the (road-legal) Firebomb two headlamp configuration, incorporated modest tail fins and was somewhat more slab-sided and square-edged in comparison to the Firearrow/Firebomb series. While a four-place convertible was the only official body type, one coupé prototype was also built.

The &quot;world&#x27;s longest assembly line&quot; involved transporting a Dodge frame and drivetrain to Italy, where the bodywork and interior was fabricated by the coachbuilders at Ghia; once the partially completed vehicles were back in the U.S. Dual-Motors handled the rest. Performance was excellent, due to the cars being powered by the Dodge hemispherical-head short-stroke V-8 engine. Not all were built with the 315 CID Dodge hemispherical head engine. Some 1957s were built with the Dodge D-500 dual quad carburetor.

== Rarity ==
With a retail price close to $7,500 ($ in dollars ), the Dual-Ghia D-500 was about $200 more expensive than most American production luxury cars. It cost, for example, about $200 more than Cadillac&#x27;s Eldorado Biarritz convertible. However, its price did not even come close to that of the ultra-luxurious 1956 Continental Mark II at $10,400, or the 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham at $13,074, ($ in dollars ). Of the 117 cars produced, 32 still existed as of July 2006. The cars were mostly bought by American celebrities, such as Frank Sinatra, Sterling Hayden and Richard Nixon. Desi Arnaz owned one, but he wrecked it. Dean Martin had one at one point as well, according to his son Ricci. Dean Martin can be seen driving his Dual-Ghia in the film &quot;Kiss Me, Stupid&quot;. Musician Rick Danko from 1958 owned one, which was auctioned by Sotheby&#x27;s for close to $350,000 in 2015.

<text>The Western Railway (abbreviated WR) is one of the 19 zones of Indian Railways and is among the busiest railway networks in India, headquartered at Mumbai, Maharashtra. The major railway routes of Indian Railways which come under Western Railways are: Mumbai Central–Ratlam, Mumbai Central–Ahmedabad and Palanpur–Ahmedabad. The railway system is divided into six operating divisions: , , , , , and . Vadodara railway station, being the junction point for the Ahmedabad–Mumbai route and the Mumbai–Ratlam route towards New Delhi, is the busiest junction station in Western Railways and one of the busiest junctions of Indian Railways too, while Ahmedabad Division earns highest revenue followed by Mumbai Division and Vadodara Division. Surat railway station is one of the busiest railway station in Western Railway in non-junction category where more than 180 trains pass per day.

Western Railway General Manager&#x27;s official bungalow &#x27;Bombarci&#x27; (abbreviation of Bombay, Baroda and Central India) is located on Altamont road in Cumbala hill, Mumbai.

==History==
The Western Railway was created on 5 November 1951 by merging several state-owned railways, including the Bombay, Baroda and Central India Railway (BB&amp;CI), and the Saurashtra Railway, Rajputana Railway and Jaipur State Railway. The narrow-gauge lines of Cutch State Railway was also merged into it in 1951.

The BB&amp;CI Railway was itself inaugurated in 1855, starting with the construction of a 29-mile (47-km) broad-gauge track from Ankleshwar to Utran in Gujarat state on the west coast. In 1864, the railway was extended to Mumbai and the first train was flagged off from Grant Road Station in Mumbai to Ahmedabad on 28 November 1864.
Subsequently, the project was further extended beyond Vadodara in a north easterly direction towards Godhra, Ratlam, Nagda and thereafter northwards towards Kota and Mathura, to eventually link with the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, now the Central Railway, which had already started operating in Mumbai in 1853. In 1860 Surat railway station was built. In 1883, a metre-gauge railway system, initially linking Delhi with Agra, Jaipur and Ajmer, was established.

The first suburban service in Mumbai with steam traction was introduced in April 1867. It was extended to Churchgate in 1870. By 1900 45 trains in each direction were carrying over one million passengers annually.

The railways of several princely states were also integrated into the Western Railway. The Gaekwars of Baroda built the Gaekwar&#x27;s Baroda State Railway (GBSR), which was merged into the BB&amp;CI in 1949. Several railways of western Gujarat, including the Bhavnagar, Kathiawar, Jamnagar &amp; Dwarka, Gondal, and Morvi railways were merged into the Saurashtra Railway in 1948. The Jodhpur–Bikaner Railway was taken over by Rajasthan state in 1949, after the western portion was ceded to the government of Pakistan.

In 2002, the Jaipur and Ajmer divisions of the Western Railway became part of the newly created North Western Railway, and in April 2003 the Kota division of the Western Railway became part of the newly created West Central Railway.

==Present==

Western Railway headquarters is in Mumbai&#x27;s Churchgate station and serves the entire state of Gujarat, some portions of Western Madhya Pradesh, and coastal Maharashtra and some parts of Rajasthan. The Western coast of India served by Western Railway has a number of ports, most important among them being Kandla, Hajira, Surat, Dahej, Mundra, Okha, Veraval, Porbandar, Bhavnagar in Gujarat state and Mumbai in Maharashtra.

Navapur railway station is unique as it falls in both the states of Gujarat and Maharashtra because both were part of Bombay State before 1960 and after States Reorganization Act the Navapur station was divided equally among Gujarat and Maharashtra. The Surat railway station is also unique. It was the first rail station in Asia with an above ground floor platform.

The Western Railway operates electric multiple units (EMUs) on the Western line of the Mumbai Suburban Railway, which forms part of the Ahmedabad–Mumbai main line. The EMUs ply between Churchgate and Virar (60 km) and was extended until Dahanu Road and Services actually started on 16 April 2013. EMUs are of 12-car or 15-car rakes and are differentiated as slow and fast locals. Slow trains halt at all stations, while fast ones halt at important stations only and are preferable over longer distances. The first electric train on this section was introduced in 1928 between Churchgate and Andheri. AC EMUs were introduced on Mumbai Suburban section of Western Railway on 25 December 2017.

Today, Western Railway runs 1394 suburban services including 96 AC services. the AC services are getting more and more popular. The suburban services are the lifeline of the city with working class commuting daily to work covering more than 60 km distance every day. For making commuting more comfortable, Western Railway is upgrading its suburban system.

==Western Railway&#x27;s Mumbai Suburban Section==
Western Railway&#x27;s Mumbai Suburban section extends from Churchgate to Dahanu Road(123 km). Western Railway operates 1394 EMU services on this section with 96 being AC services. The suburban section is the lifeline of city, with commuters travelling more than 60 km distances to reach their workplace. To make commuting more comfortable, Western Railway has done several upgradations in recent past. Many Foot Over Bridges have been constructed, Esclators and Lifts have been installed, elevated decks have been made at Andheri, Borivali and Goregaon stations and work is in progress at Khar Road, Mira Road and other stations.

==Developments on Western Railway==

Many developments have taken place on Western railway in recent past. The unstaffed level crossings have been eliminated. The staffed level crossings are also being closed by constructing Road Over Bridges and Road Under Bridges. Electrification is being carried out in mission mode to convert whole of Western Railway to electric traction.

Gauge Conversion, Doubling and New Line work in recent years:

* Ahmedabad-Himatnagar-Udaipur Gauge Conversion
* Ahmedabad-Botad GC
* Dhasa-Jetalsar GC

==Vande Bharat trains==
The new upgraded Vande Bharat version 2.0 was first introduced on 30/09/2022 between Gandhinagar and Mumbai Central. The train set boasts of several passenger friendly features. Today, Western Railway runs four Vande Bharat trains viz:

# Gandhinagar - Mumbai Central
# Indore- Nagpur
# Okha - Dwarka - Ahmedabad
# Sabarmati - Jodhpur
# Ahmedabad - Mumbai Central

==Vande Metro trains==

# Ahmedabad - Bhuj

==Western Railway Connects Statue of Unity==
On 17 January 2021, the Statue of Unity came on the railways map. Western Railway connected the Statue of Unity with the Broad Gauge electrified line with Mumbai- Delhi main line at Vadodara. The project included gauge conversion of Dabhoi-Chandod section, new line from Chandod to Kevadiya(Statue of Unity) and electrification of Pratapnagar(Vadodara) to Kevadiya. The project was completed in a record time in close coordination with state government by Western Railway. It was inaugurated by Shri Narendra Modi, Prime Minister through video conferencing from New Delhi. 8 inaugural trains were flagged off from various parts of the country on same day. Vistadome coach has been introduced in Ahmedabad-Kevadiya Janshatabdi express.

==125 years of Western Railway Headquarters Building==
Western Railway Headquarters Building constructed in the year 1899 will be completing 125 years in January 2024. The Headquarters building was designed by renowned architect, Frederick William Stevens. Stevens successfully blended the Venetian Gothic and Indian Sarcenic styles, creating in the process a style excellently adapted to the climate and environment of Bombay and the superb vantage site on which the building was constructed. Initially, Rs 4,75,000 were sanctioned for the building plus Rs 50,000 for the architect&#x27;s design fees. The final estimate including a supplementary estimate of Rs 83,426 sanctioned was Rs 7,52,556. F W Stevens appointed Raosaheb Sitaram Khanderao Vaidya as the resident engineer. He had worked with Stevens in same capacity on Municipal Building and other projects. He also appointed Ranganath Krishna Deshmukh as assistant to Resident Engineer Khanderao. F W Stevens was also assisted by his son, Charles Fedrick Stevens, who worked as Chief Assistant with him. Charles Fedrick Stevens is known for Art Deco style designs for buildings in Bombay including the famous Regal Cinema building.

The completed building with a 276 foot we276-footstern façade supporting a central tower of 160 feet was an imposing sight facing the sea situated at the intersection of Churchgate Street (Veer Nariman Road) and Queen&#x27;s road (Maharashi Karve road). As detailed by Stevens, the outline and massing were the most prominent and defining character of the building which was otherwise plain because it lacked ornament. The unique central tower was square from the base up to 100 feet, then became an octagon diminishing into a smaller octagon culminating in a circular dome. This dome was noticeable from all parts of Esplanade and formed a new landmark for ships entering Bombay. Two porches on the western and southern façades provided additional character to the building. A sculpture of ‘Engineering’ made in Bath stone was placed atop the central gable. The sculpture consisted of a lady accompanied by two children on either side, with her holding a locomotive in her right hand while supporting herself on a wheel to her left. Seven other carved figures in Porebunder stone of griffins holding BB&amp;CI monogrammed shield were placed on smaller gables. Statues of Colonel French and Colonel Kennedy were placed between the arches of carriage porch on west. The flawless Porebunder stone was brought from a four mile long quarry in the Kathiawar region in today&#x27;s Gujarat. The bases of columns and piers were of finely dressed Coorla(Kurla) stone and Kalyan brock and lime masonry for jams, piers and coigns. Chamfered and moulded arches were made of finely dressed Porebunder and Dhrangdhara red stone. Blue basalt stone was used for long steps of overhanging staircase provided with ornamental railing of wrought iron topped with French polished teak handrail. The domes, mouldings, capitals, columns, cornices and carved enrichments in Porebunder stone, white Coorla (Kurla) and Dhrangdhara red stone were in synergy with neighboring buildings.

Western Railway has planned a series of activities to mark completion of 125 years which include the restoration of this heritage building, Exhibitions, conduction heritage tours etc.

==Heritage Gallery, Mumbai==

Conserving heritage, Western Railway has opened Heritage Gallery at its headquarters building at Churchgate, Mumbai. The Gallery has recently been renovated. It is a collection of various models of BB&amp;CI era, the precursor of Western Railway. Many notes of agents of BB&amp;CI dating back to 1860s have also been displayed. Suburban timetable of 1948, steam engine model, signalling equipment, Model of 1928 EMUs, working model of Auxiliary Warning System, etc. have been beautifully displayed.

The gallery gives an insight about the development of lines on Western Region of India. The BB&amp;CI map dating back to 1930s shows us that the Western line started from Mumbai via Vadodara, Ratlam connected GIP Railway at Mathura to reach Delhi and further Peshawar. The &quot;Frontier Mail&quot; (&quot;Golden Temple Mail&quot;) used to run up to Peshawar. The Gallery is open for public free of cost during working hours and on special occasions.

<text>Dmitry Yakovlevich Laptev () (1701 – ) was a Russian Arctic explorer and Vice Admiral (1762). The Dmitry Laptev Strait is named in his honor and the Laptev Sea is named in honor of him and his cousin, and fellow Arctic explorer, Khariton Laptev.

==Early life==
Dmitry Laptev was born in the village of Bolotovo, near Velikie Luki, in 1701. A year earlier his cousin Khariton Laptev was born in nearby Bolotovo. He and his cousin were some of the first students at the School of Mathematics and Navigational Sciences in Saint Petersburg, established by Peter the Great. After graduation, he quickly moved up naval ranks and became a ranking naval officer on a number of different vessels.

==Arctic exploration==
Dmitry Laptev was a lieutenant in the Navy assigned to the Second Kamchatka Expedition in 1735 under Vitus Bering. With the death of the head of the &quot;Yakutsk&quot; captain Vasili Pronchishchev in 1736, Bering appointed Laptev to be the head of the &quot;Yakutsk&quot; crew and chart the coast of the Arctic Ocean from the Lena River eastward. With permission from Bering, Laptev returned to Saint Petersburg for the winter. A second attempt the next year similarly failed to reach the eastern fleets of the expedition.

In 1739, Laptev was the commander of an expedition to chart the Anadyr region in the far east of the continent. The expedition went poorly at first and the &quot;Yakutsk&quot; became trapped by ice very quickly. That winter the crew, led by Laptev, were the first Russians to live amongst the indigenous population of the lower Indigirka River. Villagers from Russkoye Ustye provided crucial food, assistance, and even moved the ship to open water when spring came. Although sea travel never yielded much, Laptev and the crew provided significant mapping of the areas, often through overland treks and expeditions.

After the expedition, he continued his military service in the Baltic Fleet. Laptev was promoted to Vice Admiral rank in 1762, and retired the same year.

==Legacy==

A cape in the delta of the Lena River and a strait between the Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island and Asian mainland bear his name. The Laptev Sea is also named after Dmitry Laptev and his cousin, and arctic explorer, Khariton Laptev.

<doc id="856845" wikidata="Q3536440" url="?curid=856845" title="Internet traffic">
<text>Internet traffic is the flow of data within the entire Internet, or in certain network links of its constituent networks. Common traffic measurements are total volume, in units of multiples of the byte, or as transmission rates in bytes per certain time units.

As the topology of the Internet is not hierarchical, no single point of measurement is possible for total Internet traffic. Traffic data may be obtained from the Tier 1 network providers&#x27; peering points for indications of volume and growth. However, Such data excludes traffic that remains within a single service provider&#x27;s network and traffic that crosses private peering points.

As of December 2022 almost half (48%) of mobile Internet traffic is in India and China, while North America and Europe have about a quarter. However, mobile traffic remains a minority of total internet traffic.

==Traffic sources==
File sharing constitutes a fraction of Internet traffic. The prevalent technology for file sharing is the BitTorrent protocol, which is a peer-to-peer (P2P) system mediated through indexing sites that provide resource directories. According to a Sandvine Research in 2013, Bit Torrent’s share of Internet traffic decreased by 20% to 7.4% overall, reduced from 31% in 2008. 

As of 2023, roughly 65% of all internet traffic came from video sites, up from 51% in 2016.
==Traffic management==

Internet traffic management, also known as application traffic management.
The Internet does not employ any formally centralized facilities for traffic management. Its progenitor networks, especially the ARPANET established an early backbone infrastructure which carried traffic between major interchange centers for traffic, resulting in a tiered, hierarchical system of internet service providers (ISPs) within which the tier 1 networks provided traffic exchange through settlement-free peering and routing of traffic to lower-level tiers of ISPs. The dynamic growth of the worldwide network resulted in ever-increasing interconnections at all peering levels of the Internet, so a robust system was developed that could mediate link failures, bottlenecks, and other congestion at many levels.

Economic traffic management (ETM) is the term that is sometimes used to point out the opportunities for seeding as a practice that caters to contribution within peer-to-peer file sharing and the distribution of content in the digital world in general. 

==Internet use tax==
A planned tax on Internet use in Hungary introduced a 150-forint (US$0.62, €0.47) tax per gigabyte of data traffic, in a move intended to reduce Internet traffic and also assist companies to offset corporate income tax against the new levy. Hungary achieved 1.15 billion gigabytes in 2013 and another 18 million gigabytes accumulated by mobile devices. This would have resulted in extra revenue of 175 billion forints under the new tax based on the consultancy firm eNet.

According to Yahoo News, economy minister Mihály Varga defended the move saying &quot;the tax was fair as it reflected a shift by consumers to the Internet away from phone lines&quot; and that &quot;150 forints on each transferred gigabyte of data – was needed to plug holes in the 2015 budget of one of the EU’s most indebted nations&quot;.

Some people argue that the new plan on Internet tax would prove disadvantageous to the country’s economic development, limit access to information and hinder the freedom of expression. Approximately 36,000 people have signed up to take part in an event on Facebook to be held outside the Economy Ministry to protest against the possible tax.

In 1998, the United States enacted the Internet Tax Freedom Act (ITFA) to prevent the imposition of direct taxes on internet usage and online activities such as emails, internet access, bit tax, and bandwidth tax. Initially, this law placed a 10-year moratorium on such taxes, which was later extended multiple times and made permanent in 2016. The ITFA&#x27;s goal was to protect consumers and support the growth of internet traffic by prohibiting recurring and discriminatory taxes that could hinder internet adoption and usage. As a result, ITFA has played a crucial role in promoting the digital economy and safeguarding consumer interests. According to Pew Research Center, as of 2024, approximately 93% of Americans use the internet, with platforms like YouTube and Facebook being highly popular. Additionally, 90% of U.S. households subscribed to high-speed internet services by 2021. Although the ITFA provides protection against direct internet taxes, ongoing debates about internet regulation and governance continue to shape the landscape of internet traffic and usage in the United States.

==Traffic classification==
Traffic classification describes the methods of classifying traffic by observing features passively in the traffic and line with particular classification goals. There might be some that only have a vulgar classification goal. For example, whether it is bulk transfer, peer-to-peer file-sharing, or transaction-orientated. Some others will set a finer-grained classification goal, for instance, the exact number of applications represented by the traffic. Traffic features included port number, application payload, temporal, packet size, and the characteristic of the traffic. There is a vast range of methods to allocate Internet traffic including exact traffic, for instance, port (computer networking) number, payload, heuristic, or statistical machine learning.

Accurate network traffic classification is elementary to quite a few Internet activities, from security monitoring to accounting and from the quality of service to providing operators with useful forecasts for long-term provisioning. Yet, classification schemes are extremely complex to operate accurately due to the shortage of available knowledge of the network. For example, the packet header-related information is always insufficient to allow for a precise methodology.

=== Bayesian analysis techniques ===
Work involving supervised machine learning to classify network traffic. Data are hand-classified (based upon flow content) to one of a number of categories. A combination of data set (hand-assigned) category and descriptions of the classified flows (such as flow length, port numbers, time between consecutive flows) are used to train the classifier. To give a better insight of the technique itself, initial assumptions are made as well as applying two other techniques in reality. One is to improve the quality and separation of the input of information leading to an increase in accuracy of the Naive Bayes classifier technique.

The basis of categorizing work is to classify the type of Internet traffic; this is done by putting common groups of applications into different categories, e.g., &quot;normal&quot; versus &quot;malicious&quot;, or more complex definitions, e.g., the identification of specific applications or specific Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) implementations. Adapted from Logg et al.

===Survey===
Traffic classification is a major component of automated intrusion detection systems. They are used to identify patterns as well as an indication of network resources for priority customers, or to identify customer use of network resources that in some way contravenes the operator’s terms of service.
Generally deployed Internet Protocol (IP) traffic classification techniques are based approximately on a direct inspection of each packet’s contents at some point on the network. Source address, port and destination address are included in successive IP packets with similar if not the same 5-tuple of protocol type. ort are considered to belong to a flow whose controlling application we wish to determine. Simple classification infers the controlling application’s identity by assuming that most applications consistently use well-known TCP or UDP port numbers. Even though, many candidates are increasingly using unpredictable port numbers. As a result, more sophisticated classification techniques infer application types by looking for application-specific data within the TCP or User Datagram Protocol (UDP) payloads.

==Global Internet traffic==
Aggregating from multiple sources and applying usage and bitrate assumptions, Cisco, a major network systems company, has published the following historical Internet Protocol (IP) and Internet traffic figures:

&quot;Fixed Internet traffic&quot; refers perhaps to traffic from residential and commercial subscribers to ISPs, cable companies, and other service providers. &quot;Mobile Internet traffic&quot; refers perhaps to backhaul traffic from cellphone towers and providers. The overall &quot;Internet traffic&quot; figures, which can be 30% higher than the sum of the other two, perhaps factors in traffic in the core of the national backbone, whereas the other figures seem to be derived principally from the network periphery.

Cisco also publishes 5-year projections.
==Internet backbone traffic in the United States==
The following data for the Internet backbone in the US comes from the Minnesota Internet Traffic Studies (MINTS):

The Cisco data can be seven times higher than the Minnesota Internet Traffic Studies (MINTS) data not only because the Cisco figures are estimates for the global—not just the domestic US—Internet, but also because Cisco counts &quot;general IP traffic (thus including closed networks that are not truly part of the Internet, but use IP, the Internet Protocol, such as the IPTV services of various telecom firms)&quot;. The MINTS estimate of US national backbone traffic for 2004, which may be interpolated as 200 petabytes/month, is a plausible three-fold multiple of the traffic of the US&#x27;s largest backbone carrier, Level(3) Inc., which claims an average traffic level of 60 petabytes/month.

==Edholm&#x27;s law==

In the past Internet bandwidth in telecommunications networks doubled every 18 months, an observation expressed as Edholm&#x27;s law. This follows the advances in semiconductor technology, such as metal-oxide-silicon (MOS) scaling, exemplified by the MOSFET transistor, which has shown similar scaling described by Moore&#x27;s law. In the 1980s, fiber-optical technology using laser light as information carriers accelerated the transmission speed and bandwidth of telecommunication circuits. This has led to the bandwidths of communication networks achieving terabit per second transmission speeds.

<text>Marilyn Chris (born Marilyn Miller, 1938 or 1939) is an American actress. She is known for playing the role of Wanda Webb Wolek on the ABC soap opera, &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1972–1976, 1980–1994). She starred Off-Broadway in Allen Ginsberg&#x27;s &quot;Kaddish&quot; (1972), winning an Obie Award, an Outer Critics Circle Award, a Variety Critics Poll, and a Drama Desk Award for her performance. In the 1980s, she appeared on Broadway in &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot;.

==Early life==
Chris was born in Brooklyn, New York, to Jack Miller, an English-Scottish Mennonite and Sylvia Slavin, a Russian Jew. When she was growing up, her father walked out on the family and her grandfather, who she was close with, died.

She attended Junior High School 109 in Brooklyn. One of her classmates was Steve Lawrence (when he was still known as Sidney Liebowitz). Chris was then accepted at the High School of Performing Arts. After high school, she enrolled at City College of New York.

==Career==
On February 23, 1958, the New York Daily News chose Chris as that week&#x27;s &quot;Typical American Girl.&quot; Her photo appeared in the Sunday magazine section and she won a $25 prize. She began her acting career in the 1950s at The Living Theatre. She appeared in productions for the theatre, including &quot;Many Loves&quot;, &quot;Women of Trachis&quot;, &quot;In the Jungle of Cities&quot;, &quot;The Apple&quot;, and &quot;Man is Man&quot;. Prompted by the discovery that her birth name was already registered with Actors Equity, Miller devised a stage name simply by shortening her then-married name, Christopoulos.

In 1963, she appeared in &quot;The Good Soldier Schweik&quot; for the Chelsea Theater Center. She made her film debut in &quot;Love with the Proper Stranger&quot; (1963), co-starring with Natalie Wood and Steve McQueen. In 1965, Chris was an under study for the roles of Agnes Graham and Sylvia Goldman in the original Broadway production of &quot;The Family Way.&quot; In 1967, she was a stand by for the roles of Lulu and Meg in &quot;The Birthday Party&quot; on Broadway. In 1968, she was a stand by for the title role in a Broadway production of &quot;The Seven Descents of Myrtle&quot;.

Chris appeared in the romantic drama film &quot;John and Mary&quot; (1969), co-starring with Dustin Hoffman. In 1970, she guest starred on &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

She also won a Drama Desk Award, an Outer Critics Circle Award and a Variety Critics Poll.

In May 1972, she was cast in the contract role of Wanda Webb on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. The character opened a restaurant called Heavenly Hash in the fictional city of Llanview. Her true love was Vince Wolek (Antony Ponzini).

Chris played Mrs. Bingham in the comedy film &quot;Rhinoceros&quot; (1974), co-starring with Gene Wilder. In July 1974, she co-starred with Lee Wallace in the musical &quot;Laugh a Little, Cry a Little&quot; at the Westbury Music Fair.

She made guest appearances on &quot;Family&quot; and &quot;Kaz&quot;.

Chris played Mavis Skinner in the comedy film &quot;The Black Marble&quot; (1980). The same year, she also appeared in the romantic comedy film &quot;Loving Couples&quot;. She had a role in the television film &quot;The Secret War of Jackie&#x27;s Girls&quot;. In 1980, Chris returned to the role of Wanda on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. She appeared in the television film &quot;Kent State&quot; (1981).

In the early 1980s, Chris returned to Broadway, playing Kate Jerome in &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot;. She co-starred with her husband, Lee Wallace, in the television film &quot;A Doctor&#x27;s Story&quot; (1984). She guest starred on &quot;Fame&quot; in 1986. Chris appeared in the film &quot;American Stories: Food, Family and Philosophy&quot; (also titled &quot;Histoires d&#x27;Amerique&quot;) (1989). In 1990, she co-starred with Lee Wallace in &quot;Taking Stock&quot; for the Jewish Repertory Theatre.

In March and April 1992, Chris appeared in &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; at the Valley Forge Music Fair. She co-starred with Bernard Barrow, Cady McClain, and Walt Willey. In October 1992, she co-starred with Lee Wallace in &quot;God of Vengeance&quot; for the Jewish Repertory Theatre.

Chris guest starred on &quot;Third Watch&quot; in 1999. She guest starred on &quot;Deadline&quot; and &quot;Oz&quot; in the early 2000s. She played Phyllis in &quot;The Great New Wonderful&quot; (2005), a comedy film about New Yorkers living in the city after the September 11 attacks. She appeared as Mrs. Chadwick in the comedy film &quot;Waltzing Anna&quot; (2006). Chris guest starred on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; and &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot;.

In March 2010, she appeared in &quot;Sin&quot; at the Baruch Performing Arts Center&#x27;s Rose Nagelberg Theatre. The play closed abruptly due to lack of funds. She played Elizabeth Robbins in the suspense film &quot;Altered Minds&quot; (2013). In July 2024, Chris played serial killer Nannie Doss in a solo reading of &quot;The Giggling Granny&quot; at the Southampton Cultural Center.

==Personal life==
Chris has married three times, the first two ending in divorce: first, in 1957, to aspiring playwright George Christopoulos, with whom she had a son, Paul; next, on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1967, to actor Ric Mancini; and finally—from December 14, 1975 until his death on December 20, 2020—to actor Lee Wallace.

<text>Richard Kruspe (born Sven Kruspe; 24 June 1967) is a German musician. He is best known as one of the founders and the lead guitarist of the band Rammstein, as well as the frontman of the industrial metal band Emigrate. Kruspe has released eight studio albums with Rammstein and four albums with Emigrate. 

==Early life==
Sven Kruspe was born in Wittenberge, then part of East Germany. He later changed his first name to Richard, believing that anyone should be able to change their name if they want to. Kruspe has a younger sister and an older brother. His parents divorced when he was young, and his mother remarried. The family moved from the village of Weisen to Schwerin when Kruspe was young. He did not get along with his stepfather, who would be physically abusive, and Kruspe often ran away from home in his early teens. During his youth, Kruspe was a wrestler for seven years.

In a 2014 interview with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, Kruspe commented on life in East Germany, stating: &quot;The thing about East Germany is that it was great to grow up there until you were 12. You were presented with the illusion of a very healthy society, which worked unless you asked questions – and you don&#x27;t ask questions until you&#x27;re 12.&quot; 

At age 16, Kruspe and some friends visited Czechoslovakia, where he bought a guitar, originally planning to sell it. He then met a girl who saw him with the guitar and insisted he play something. When Kruspe hit random notes in frustration, the girl commented that it sounded &quot;beautiful&quot; and the moment would inspire him to learn how to play guitar. Kruspe later studied jazz guitar at the conservatorium in Schwerin for four years.

==Career==

In the late 1980s, Kruspe moved to East Berlin. For two years, he lived in an apartment with a drum kit and a guitar and made music by himself as he was not familiar with the local music scene. On 10 October 1989, Kruspe found himself in the middle of a political demonstration after exiting a subway station. He was then hit on the head by police and arrested. Kruspe spent the next six days in jail where he was interrogated and beaten by authorities. Once out of jail, he decided to leave East Germany. Because of the Eastern Bloc, he entered West Germany by traveling through Hungary. When the Berlin Wall came down, he moved back to Schwerin in East Germany.

Kruspe&#x27;s first band, Das Elegante Chaos, was formed in 1987. The band recorded material in 1989 that were later released on the album &quot;Lyrik&quot; in 2011. Following the break-up of Das Elegante Chaos in 1989, Kruspe formed Orgasm Death Gimmick in 1991. The band released three demo tapes before disbanding in 1993. Kruspe was also a member of First Arsch with singer and drummer Till Lindemann and guitarist Paul Landers. The band released their debut album, &quot;Saddle Up&quot;, in 1992. 

In 1992, Kruspe traveled to the southwest of the United States together with Lindemann and bassist Oliver Riedel. Upon returning to Germany, he decided to pursue a new style of music that combined machine-like sounds with heavy guitars. In 1993, Kruspe formed a new project with roommates Riedel and drummer Christoph Schneider named Tempelprayers. Together with singer Lindemann, they entered the Berlin Senate Metrobeat contest with a demo tape in 1994 and won a recording session in a professional studio. That same year, the band was joined by guitarist Landers and keyboardist Christian Lorenz, and changed their name to Rammstein. 

==Personal life==

Kruspe has three children, two daughters and one son. He married South African actress Caron Bernstein on 29 October 1999. The ceremony was Jewish, and Kruspe composed the music for it. He took the last name Kruspe-Bernstein during their marriage. Kruspe moved from Berlin to New York in 2001 to live closer to Bernstein and work on his side-project Emigrate. They separated in 2004, and he reverted to his original last name. Kruspe moved back to Berlin in 2011.

== Equipment ==
Kruspe has been an endorser of ESP Guitars since 1996. He bought his first ESP guitar, a sunburst 901 model, in 1990. Kruspe primarily used 901 models and Kirk Hammett signature model guitars for recording and touring until ESP produced his signature model guitars the ESP RZK-I in the mid-2000s and the RZK-II in the early 2010s. He also uses other ESP guitars, including Eclipse models and a Ron Wood signature model, in the studio. Kruspe was previously endorsed by EMG and was a long-time user of EMG 81 pickups before switching to Fishman in 2018 and joining their Fluence artist roster in 2023. He also has a signature Fluence pickup set. Kruspe mainly uses Mesa/Boogie amplifiers and cabinets, notably the Mark II C+ and Dual Rectifiers amps and 4×12 cabinets, in addition to Friedman and Soldano amps. He also uses the Kemper Profiler in the studio and live. Kruspe has a signature guitar pick and a signature string set through Dunlop and SIT Strings respectively.

<text>Leviton Manufacturing Company, Inc. is an American manufacturer of electrical wiring equipment in North America. The company produces electrical outlets including GFCI and USB charging devices, network infrastructure, lighting control systems, load centers and circuit breakers, EV charging stations, and utility submetering. 

==History==


Leviton was founded in 1906 by Russian immigrants Evser Leviton and his son Isidor Leviton when they began manufacturing brass mantle tips for natural gas lights in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side. In 1910, Isidor designed a screw-in lampholder for the newly invented electric light bulb and within ten years the lampholders were installed in apartment buildings across Manhattan. 

In 1916, Leviton moved its headquarters to Williamsburg, Brooklyn, and in 1922 Leviton moved to Greenpoint, Brooklyn.

The company first began manufacturing wall outlets and switches in the 1920s. In 1936, Leviton built a new manufacturing plant in Greenpoint that allowed the company to begin making pull chains. In 1937, Leviton acquired wire and cable manufacturer American Insulated Wire, which it operated until 2010, when Leviton sold American Insulated Wire to Southwire.

During World War II and the postwar economic boom Leviton manufactured materials for the Allies.

In 1963, Leviton opened manufacturing facilities in North Carolina under the name Southern Devices, as well as a manufacturing plant in Rhode Island. In 1965, Isidor&#x27;s son Harold Leviton assumed the roles of CEO and president, and Isidor&#x27;s son-in-law Jack Amsterdam became chairman.

After the eruption of the Azores Capelinhos volcano in 1957 displaced Portuguese citizens, Harold Leviton facilitated jobs for 150 of the affected individuals who immigrated to the United States in the 1960s.

In 1973, Leviton moved its headquarters to Little Neck, Queens.

In 2007, following the death of Harold Leviton, the company named Harold&#x27;s sons-in-law Donald Hendler and Stephen Sokolow CEO and chairman of the board respectively.

Later in 2007, Leviton was sued by electronics company Lutron over alleged infringement of patents.

In 2009, the company moved its headquarters to Melville, Long Island. 

In the 2010s, Leviton made several acquisitions. In 2012, the company acquired electrical device manufacturer Home Automation, Inc. In 2015, Leviton acquired cable manufacturer Brand-Rex. In 2016, Leviton acquired sustainable lighting manufacturer ConTech Lighting for an undisclosed amount. In 2017, Leviton acquired Southern California based company Birchwood Lighting.

By 2017, Leviton was considered the largest producer of electrical wiring devices in the United States, employing 6,500 people worldwide with an annual revenue of $1.5 billion.

In July 2020, Leviton acquired copper and fiber cable manufacturer Berk-Tek from Nexans for $202 million.

In February 2023, the company launched its Level 2 electric vehicle charging stations including 32, 48, and 50 Amp level 2 compatibility.

<text>South Yardley is a largely residential area in east Birmingham, England about from the city centre, and one of the city&#x27;s 69 electoral wards. 

==Ward==
Following the 2017 City of Birmingham ward revisions South Yardley covers a much smaller area.

Former boundaries

The ward of the same name previously covered a larger area that included Greet, Hay Mills, Small Heath Park, South Yardley, Tyseley and parts of Yardley and Gilbertstone. 
The name of the ward was changed from Acocks Green Ward and with the name change, the boundary changed with Acocks Green village and Acocks Green railway station being lost and the boundary being extended north to Bordesley Green East. The area was extended up to Golden Hillock Road. This included the Small Heath Park area and Greet.

South Yardley is one of the four wards that make up the council constituency of Yardley. 

==Population==
According to the 2001 UK Census, there were 27,620 people living in 10,907 households within the then ward boundaries of South Yardley. 30.3% (8,375) of the ward&#x27;s population consists of ethnic minorities compared with 29.6% for Birmingham in general. The population of the ward had increased at the 2011 census to 30,786.

==Notable residents==
*Graham Short (renowned micro-artist) Master engraver known for engraving The Lord&#x27;s Prayer on the head of a pin. (1946 -
*Gordon Nutt (8 November 1932 – 26 February 2014), former professional footballer who played in England, Wales, the Netherlands, and Australia; he made a total of 189 league appearances, and scored 32 goals.
*John Hemming, politician (MP for Birmingham Yardley from 2005 to 2015)

==Neighbourhood improvement schemes==
Through Neighbourhood Renewal Funding, South Yardley has established the a scheme which involved street cleaning projects and training courses to improve the physical image of the area.

==Places of interest==
The Swan Shopping Centre was demolished in 2009 after a prolonged period of falling trade. It included an indoor market with a multi-storey car park. Proposals for a replacement shopping centre in a more modern architectural style have been approved. Planning permission was granted after Tesco agreed to pay a sum of money to the development as they are building a store on the site and in the immediate vicinity of the site. The replacement shopping centre will include a public piazza and petrol station. Councillor Jim Whorwood said the need to re-develop the Swan Centre was &#x27;long overdue&#x27;.

The new Swan Shopping Centre opened in 2012.

South Yardley Library is within the ward. It re-opened on 6 May 2008 after extensive refurbishments and offers free internet access on 30 computers.

<doc id="856860" wikidata="Q165644" url="?curid=856860" title="Paul Landers">
<text>Paul Landers (born Heiko Paul Hiersche; 9 December 1964) is a German musician, best known as the rhythm guitarist of Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein, and punk rock bands Feeling B and First Arsch. Landers has released eight studio albums and three live albums with Rammstein.

== Early life ==
Landers was born in East Berlin, East Germany, son of Anton and Erika Hiersche. His mother comes from Lyck in Masuria, today Ełk, Poland. His father is from Böhmisch Kahn, today Velké Chvojno, Czech Republic. Both parents had to leave their home after the Second World War and met during their studies in Halle (Saale). Landers briefly lived in Moscow as a child and can speak some Russian.

== Career ==
In 1983, at the age of 18, Landers became part of the East German punk band Feeling B, which was founded by singer Aljoscha Rompe and drummer Alexander Kriening. The band later recruited 16 year-old Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz to play bass, though he could only play the organ at the time and used it to create bass sounds for the band. Feeling B had various temporary drummers in their line-up, including Christoph Schneider later in their career. Landers also played in a number of other bands, such as Die Firma and Die Magdalene Keibel Combo.

In the late 1980s, Landers met Till Lindemann during a showing of the GDR documentary &quot;flüstern &amp; SCHREIEN&quot;, which focused on varieties of youth music culture in the GDR. He also met Richard Kruspe, a friend of Lindemann, during this period. Landers would later play guitar in Lindemann and Kruspe&#x27;s band First Arsch. In 1992, that band released their only album, &quot;Saddle Up&quot;.

In 1993, Lindemann, Kruspe, Schneider, and bassist Oliver Riedel formed a new band called Templeprayers. They won the Berlin Senate Metrobeat Contest in 1994 that enabled them to have a four-track demo professionally recorded. Landers and Flake soon joined the band, which then changed their name to Rammstein.

== Personal life ==
Landers married his first wife, Nikki Landers, in 1984 at the age of 20. He subsequently took his wife&#x27;s surname, having already switched his middle and first name, making his full name &quot;Paul Landers&quot;. Landers has two children, a son and a daughter.

<doc id="856862" wikidata="Q614485" url="?curid=856862" title="Buys Ballot's law">
<text>In meteorology, Buys Ballot&#x27;s law () may be expressed as follows: In the Northern Hemisphere, if a person stands with their back to the wind, the atmospheric pressure is low to the left, high to the right. This is because wind travels counterclockwise around low pressure zones in the Northern Hemisphere. It is approximately true in the higher latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, and is reversed in the Southern Hemisphere, but the angle between the pressure gradient force and wind is not a right angle in low latitudes.

A version taught to US Naval Cadets in WW2 is: &quot;In the Northern Hemisphere, if you turn your back to the wind, the low pressure center will be to your left and somewhat toward the front.&quot;

== History ==

As early as the 16th century extensive weather observations were included as part of a ship&#x27;s log. These observations as well as other log information, were turned over to national hydrographic institutes in various nations, most notably Germany and England and later the US. The information from many ships about individual voyages was compiled ashore and later became what today is still published by England, a 3 volume set complete with charts titled &quot;Sailing Directions for the World&quot;. Additionally the US Defense Mapping Agency publishes a 47 volume set &quot;Sailing Directions&quot; which serves much the same purpose. The information is the distillate of empirical observations of thousands of ships masters over thousands of voyages spanning several hundred years.

Buys Ballot&#x27;s law, which was first deduced by the American meteorologists J.H. Coffin and William Ferrel, is a direct consequence of Ferrel&#x27;s law. The law takes its name from C. H. D. Buys Ballot, a Dutch meteorologist, who published it in the &quot;Comptes Rendus&quot;, 9 November 1857. While William Ferrel theorized this first in 1856, Buys Ballot was the first to provide an empirical validation. While Buys Ballot hoped that his law would be validated by other meteorological services in other countries, foreign dissemination and adoption of Buys Ballot&#x27;s law was slow. The French and American meteorological services of the era prioritized describing the state of storms rather than forecasting them, finding little use for the predictive value of Buys Ballot&#x27;s law. However, the British Meteorological Office began to use Buys Ballot&#x27;s law extensively after reintroducing a storm warning system in 1867 following the death of its former director Robert FitzRoy. The rule of thumb became more widely accepted following its effective use in the British forecasts.

Buys Ballot&#x27;s law first appeared in early versions (prior to 1900) of Bowditch&#x27;s American Practical Navigator and other publications written to assist in passage planning and the safe conduct of ships at sea and is still included today both in Bowditch and in Sailing Directions (see following reference) as an item of practical reference and information.

== Uses ==

The law outlines general rules of conduct for masters of both sail and steam vessels, to assist them in steering the vessels away from the center and right front (in the Northern Hemisphere and left front in the Southern Hemisphere) quadrants of hurricanes or any other rotating disturbances at sea. Prior to radio, satellite observation and the ability to transmit timely weather information over long distances, the only method a ship&#x27;s master had to forecast the weather was observation of meteorological conditions (visible cloud formations, wind direction and atmospheric pressure) at his location.

Included in the &quot;Sailing Directions for the World&quot; are Buys Ballot&#x27;s techniques for avoiding the worst part of any rotating storm system at sea using only the locally observable phenomena of cloud formations, wind speed and barometric pressure tendencies over a number of hours. These observations and application of the principles of Buys Ballot&#x27;s law help to establish the probability of the existence of a storm and the best course to steer to try to avoid the worst of it—with the best chance of survival.

The underlying principles of Buys Ballot&#x27;s law state that for anyone ashore in the Northern Hemisphere and in the path of a hurricane, the most dangerous place to be is in the right front quadrant of the storm. There, the observed wind speed of the storm is the sum of the speed of wind in the storm circulation plus the velocity of the storm&#x27;s forward movement. Buys Ballot&#x27;s law calls this the &quot;Dangerous Quadrant&quot;. Likewise, in the left front quadrant of the storm the observed wind is the &quot;difference&quot; between the storm&#x27;s wind velocity and its forward speed. This is called the &quot;Safe Quadrant&quot; due to the lower observed wind speeds.

To look at it another way, in the Northern Hemisphere if a person is to the right of where a hurricane or tropical storm makes landfall, that is considered the dangerous quadrant. If they are to the left of the point of landfall, that is the safe quadrant. In the dangerous quadrant an observer will experience higher wind speeds and generally a much higher storm surge due to the onshore wind direction. In the safe quadrant, the observer will experience somewhat lower wind speeds and the possibility of lower than normal water levels due to the direction of the wind being offshore.

These are very general rules that are subject to many other factors, including shapes of the coastline, and topography in any location. Although the principles apply to a very limited extent to a coastal observer during the approach and passage of a storm in any location, Buys Ballot&#x27;s law was primarily formulated from empirical data to assist ships at sea.

<doc id="856871" wikidata="Q154852" url="?curid=856871" title="Till Lindemann">
<text>Till Lindemann (; born 4 January 1963) is a German singer and songwriter. He is the lead vocalist and lyricist of Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein and solo project Lindemann. Rammstein has sold over 25 million records worldwide, with five of their albums receiving platinum status, and Lindemann has been listed among the &quot;50 Greatest Metal Frontmen of All Time&quot; by Roadrunner Records. Lindemann has also appeared in minor roles in films and has published three books of poetry. He has presented some of his original poems and scripts to galleries.

==Early life==
Lindemann was born on 4 January 1963 in Leipzig (then in East Germany), the son of Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) journalist Brigitte Hildegard &quot;Gitta&quot; Lindemann and poet Werner Lindemann. His parents first met at a conference in Bitterfeld in 1959. He grew up in Wendisch-Rambow alongside his younger sister, Saskia. At age 11, Lindemann went to a sports school at the sports club SC Empor Rostock, and attended a boarding school from 1977 to 1980. His parents lived separately for career reasons after 1975, and divorced when Lindemann was still young. He lived with his father for a short time, but the relationship was unhealthy; in the book &quot;Mike Oldfield im Schaukelstuhl&quot;, his father wrote about his own problems with alcoholism and the difficulties of being a father to a teenage Lindemann.

In 1978, Lindemann participated in the European Junior Swimming Championships in Florence, finishing 11th in the freestyle and 7th in the freestyle, swimming a time of ; he was shortlisted to go to the 1980 Olympics in Moscow, but left the sport due to an injury. According to Lindemann, &quot;I never liked the sport school actually, it was very intense. But as a child you don&#x27;t object.&quot; He later worked as an apprentice carpenter, a gallery technician, a peat cutter, and a basket weaver. His mother dedicated a letter titled &quot;Mein Sohn, der Frontmann von Rammstein&quot; (&quot;My son, the frontman of Rammstein&quot;) to Lindemann in 2009. The first album he owned was Deep Purple&#x27;s &quot;Stormbringer&quot;.

==Career==
===Music===

Lindemann started to play drums for Schwerin-based experimental rock band First Arsch in 1986, who released an album titled &quot;Saddle Up&quot; in 1992, and played one song (&quot;Lied von der unruhevollen Jugend&quot;) with a punk band called Feeling B, which was the former band of Rammstein members Paul Landers, Christoph Schneider and Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz in 1989. During his time in Feeling B, he played the drums in the band. In the 1990s, Lindemann began to write lyrics. In 1994, the band entered and won a contest in Berlin that allowed them to record a four track demo professionally. When questioned as to why Rammstein was named after the Ramstein air show disaster, he said he viewed images of the incident on television, and that he and the bandmates wanted to make a musical memorial.

Lindemann then moved to Berlin. During Rammstein&#x27;s early years, because of his use of over-the-top pyrotechnics, Lindemann burned his ears, hair and arms. Bandmate Christoph Schneider commented, &quot;Till gets burned all the time, but he likes the pain.&quot; An incident in September 1996 caused a section of the band&#x27;s set to burn, and as a result, Lindemann got his certification in pyrotechnics so the band could perform with pyrotechnics more safely than it had previously.

During Rammstein&#x27;s US tour in June 1999, Lindemann and his bandmate Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz were arrested in Worcester, Massachusetts, for lewd conduct performed during their song &quot;Bück dich&quot; (&quot;bend over&quot;), which consisted of Lindemann using a liquid squirting dildo and simulating anal sex on Lorenz. Both Lindemann and Lorenz were released the following day after bail was met. This incident did not stop Lindemann from performing in the same manner for future shows outside the United States, particularly in Australia when they performed at the 2011 Big Day Out, but the United States performances of this song were changed into a sadomasochistic theme that did not feature dildos, although this was not the case for all remaining US shows on the tour. For example, on 18 June 1999, &quot;Bück dich&quot; was performed in the same manner at the Roseland Theater in Portland, Oregon. In 1999, the band was blamed for the 1999 Columbine massacre, but they denied their music was a factor. In November 2002, Lindemann&#x27;s poetry book &quot;Messer&quot; was published. It consists of 54 poems compiled by Gert Hof, author of the book &quot;Rammstein&quot;, who was also the band&#x27;s pyrodesigner for the last seven years. In July 2010, Lindemann, along with Flake, was interviewed by heavy metal anthropologist Sam Dunn for the VH1 Classic series &quot;Metal Evolution&quot;, on the topic of shock rock.
Lindemann is not a stranger to injury, as he mentioned in Rammstein&#x27;s early career that he&#x27;d gotten burned several times with unprofessionally rigged pyrotechnics. At a performance in Sweden in 2005, he received a knee injury on stage when keyboardist Flake accidentally ran into him while riding a Segway PT. This injury caused several tour dates in Asia to be cancelled.

In 2005, five Rammstein albums received platinum awards and the band also received the &quot;World Sales Awards&quot; for over 10 million sold copies worldwide.

During the filming of the band&#x27;s music video for &quot;Ich tu dir weh&quot;, Lindemann wanted a light put in his mouth to create a visually stunning effect. Bandmate Paul Landers suggested that he use a flesh colored wire and run it along his cheek to shine a light into his mouth from the outside. Lindemann refused, and instead opted to have a surgical incision in his left cheek, so that a light could be fed into his mouth directly, and largely out of sight.

There is a specific performance move of Lindemann&#x27;s, dubbed &quot;The Till Hammer&quot;. This move is where he bends his knees, beats his thigh with a fist in a hammering motion while turning his head from side to side. On occasion, Flake has been seen to parody the move onstage. Unlike most frontmen, Lindemann stated in an interview that he does not like being looked at while on stage, and would wear sunglasses to block out views of the audience.

The main purpose of the band&#x27;s signature pyrotechnics has also been stated to actually be a tool in taking the audience&#x27;s attention away from Lindemann, whilst doubling as a spectacle for the audience. Lindemann often opts to just look directly at the mixing booth in the center of the crowd, except when directly interacting with an audience member. In 2011, Roadrunner Records listed Lindemann at number 50 of the 50 greatest metal frontmen of all time. In 2013, Lindemann&#x27;s second poetry book, &quot;In stillen Nächten&quot; was published. He commented on the poetry, saying &quot;The vast majority of my poems could have been written a few hundred years earlier.&quot;

On his 52nd birthday (4 January 2015), it was announced that Lindemann would start a new project with Peter Tägtgren named Lindemann. The band released their debut album &quot;Skills in Pills&quot; in June 2015. On 22 November 2019, Lindemann released their second album, &quot;F&amp;M&quot;.

In 2021, Lindemann performed a Soviet war song &quot;Lubimy Gorod&quot; (, Beloved Town) in Russian – originally sung by Mark Bernes in 1939 – for the Russian movie &quot;V2. Escape from Hell&quot; (&quot;Devyatayev&quot;). Till Lindemann was nominated for Best Narrative at the Berlin Music Video Awards 2020 with his music video &quot;Frau &amp; Mann&quot;. In 2021, his music video &quot;Alle Tage ist kein Sonntag&quot; received a nomination for Most Bizarre.

===Poetry===

In 2018, Lindemann embarked on a book signing tour across Russia for his poetry book, &quot;Messer&quot;, originally released in German and then translated into Russian and re-released to the Russian market. Lindemann showed up to his book signing in Moscow with an unknown person in a gimp costume. The female gimp was led through the crowd by Lindemann before he sat down to sign autographs and talk to fans. It is still unknown who was in the outfit, but suggestions are that of his girlfriend at the time.

===Film and television===

Two songs from the album &quot;Herzeleid&quot; were used in David Lynch&#x27;s 1997 film, &quot;Lost Highway&quot;. Lindemann has also played minor roles in some films, appearing with his bandmate Christoph Schneider as musicians in the 1999 film &quot;Pola X&quot;, playing a character named Viktor in the children&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Amundsen der Pinguin&quot; (2003), and also appearing as an animal rights activist in the 2004 film &quot;Vinzent&quot;. Lindemann and the rest of Rammstein also appeared in the 2002 movie &quot;xXx&quot; (Triple-X starring Vin Diesel) while performing &quot;Feuer frei!&quot;

===As guest artist===
Lindemann has featured alongside many other artists throughout his career, such as Feeling B, Apocalyptica, and his bandmate Richard Kruspe&#x27;s solo project, Emigrate. In 2023, he appeared on &quot;Child of Sin&quot; by Kovacs.

==Musicianship==

Lindemann&#x27;s vocal range is that of a dramatic baritone. He has a tendency to press his voice with force from below and use the alveolar trill, stating in an interview that he sings it out of instinct. However, this trait could be connected to his youth years in Mecklenburg. In 2005, the &quot;New York Times&quot; commented on Lindemann&#x27;s voice: &quot;He commands a low, powerful bass rarely used in contemporary pop music, untrained but electrifying.&quot;

Lindemann himself describes his lyrics as &quot;love songs&quot;. Some songs written by him have references to 19th century or earlier literature. For example, &quot;Dalai Lama&quot; from the album &quot;Reise, Reise&quot; is an adaption of Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Der Erlkönig&quot;. He also used more of Goethe&#x27;s poems, as &quot;Rosenrot&quot; contains elements from the poem &quot;Heidenröslein&quot;, while &quot;Feuer und Wasser&quot; has narrative elements from Friedrich Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Der Taucher&quot;. Lindemann also used elements from &quot;Der Struwwelpeter&quot; by Heinrich Hoffmann on &quot;Hilf mir&quot; from the album &quot;Rosenrot&quot;. &quot;Mein Herz brennt&quot; has lyrics taken from a narrative line in the East German children&#x27;s show &quot;Das Sandmännchen&quot;.

Lindemann has used contemporary literature for intertextual references; the song title &quot;Non, je ne regrette rien&quot; was used as a chorus for the song &quot;Frühling in Paris&quot;, and the song lyrics of &quot;Links 2-3-4&quot; are based on the song &quot;Einheitsfrontlied&quot; by Bertolt Brecht. According to Lindemann, the lyrics of the song state the band&#x27;s political category, positioning themselves on the left. He has also used another song composed by Brecht, titled &quot;Mack the Knife&quot;, and the chorus was used for the song &quot;Haifisch&quot;.

The song &quot;Cowboy&quot; is a criticism of the hypermasculine character of Americans. Despite &quot;Hollywood propaganda&quot;, Lindemann states that it was actually the cowboys who beat up the Native Americans.

==Personal life==

Lindemann has four children. His oldest child, a daughter, Nele, was born in 1985, and he spent the first seven years of her life as a single father. He has one grandson through Nele.

Lindemann is an atheist. In a 2011 interview, he said that he still has strong connections to the traditions of East Germany, and that he finds &quot;detraditionalization&quot; disturbing and believes there is &quot;no longer any authenticity&quot;. He has said that he &quot;hates noise&quot; and often spends time in a small village somewhere in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the name of which he has not disclosed.

In 2014, Lindemann presented two sculptures and his original scripts of poems in his book &quot;In stillen Nächten&quot; (&quot;On Quiet Nights&quot;) in a Dresden gallery. He also wrote some lyrics in 2014 for German Schlager singer Roland Kaiser for his album &quot;Soul Tracks&quot;.

=== Misconduct allegation ===
In June 2023, a woman alleged that her drink was spiked at a Rammstein concert in Lithuania and that a Russian woman on social media recruited her for sex with Lindemann. After the show, she was brought to a room with Lindemann and refused to have sex with him, as he reacted angrily and left. She emphasised that she was never sexually assaulted, but the story highlighted the band&#x27;s &quot;Row Zero&quot; practice, where female fans who stood in a restricted area directly in front of the stage would be invited to pre- and after-show parties with Lindemann as potential sex partners. 

Berlin prosecutors opened an investigation into sexual offences and the distribution of narcotics after more women claimed to have been &quot;cast&quot; for sex with Lindemann. Lindemann and the band denied all criminal wrongdoing. Lindemann&#x27;s book publisher Kiepenheuer &amp; Witsch dropped him as a client, claiming that a pornographic video he starred in and his 2013 book &quot;In Silent Nights&quot; celebrated sexual violence. In August, an anonymous woman spoke to &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; claiming that she had a sexual relationship with Lindemann beginning in 2011 when she was 15. While she was above the age of consent in Germany, she felt she &quot;was way too young&quot; to understand what happened and it caused her &quot;long-lasting damage&quot;.

On 29 August, the German prosecutors dropped the case, saying that the investigations did not provide any evidence and that they were unable to substantiate allegations as law enforcement agencies had not received direct testimony from the accusers.

On 15 May 2024, an investigation from the Vilnius police provided new findings that further refuted the accusation. With evidence indicating that the gaps in the woman&#x27;s memory that she described and injuries she has alleged were due to her own consumption of a wide variety of alcoholic drinks and her use of cannabis.

Lindemann filed a criminal complaint against the German publication &quot;Der Spiegel&quot;. The investigation into the alleged sexual misconduct was dropped in August 2023 - the complaint alleges that the publication&#x27;s reporting included falsified documents.

==Geography==
As of 2005, the Hamburg Metropolitan Region was made up of the city of Hamburg along with numerous rural districts in Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein, altogether comprising 800 cities, towns and municipalities with an overall land area of . Since then it has expanded to cover the districts of Ludwigslust-Parchim (partially from 2012, entirely from 2017) and Nordwestmecklenburg (from 2012) in the state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.
&lt;br&gt;

<text>Oliver &quot;Ollie&quot; Riedel (born 11 April 1971) is a German musician, best known as one of the founders and the bassist of band Rammstein.

==Early life==
Riedel was born in Schwerin on 11 April 1971. Growing up, he had relatively good relationships with both of his parents, which he attributes to the small gap between their ages. As a child, he was not a good student, but he made his way through school with the assistance of his mother. Riedel was quite shy, especially during his teenage years; while his friends partied, he would often be found just &quot;hanging around&quot;.

==Career==
In 1992, Riedel began playing in a folk/punk band called the Inchtabokatables. That same year, he traveled to the southwest of the United States together with Richard Kruspe and Till Lindemann. In 1993, Riedel co-founded a new project named Tempelprayers with Kruspe and Christoph Schneider. Together with Lindemann, they entered the Berlin Senate Metrobeat contest in 1994 and won a recording session in a professional studio. Paul Landers and Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz would later join the band, which was then renamed to Rammstein.

==Personal life==
Riedel has two children. He enjoys photography and sports, especially skateboarding and surfing. He is the tallest member of Rammstein, standing at 6 ft 7 in (2 m). Riedel is known to live a private life and rarely gives interviews. He is said to be the most computer-literate member of Rammstein. In 2022, Riedel auctioned off two of his signature Sandberg basses as part of the Gear For Hope music auction where proceeds were donated to aid organizations in Ukraine. 

==Musicianship==

=== Technique ===
Riedel is primarily a fingerstyle player, although he uses a pick for most songs when playing live.

In certain softer songs, Riedel has been known to play with a banjo style plucking technique with his right hand to play arpeggiated chords, such as in &quot;Seemann&quot;. He also plays the acoustic guitar introduction to &quot;Tier&quot; and &quot;Frühling in Paris&quot; during live shows.

===Gear===
His known gear is:

* Sandberg California PM
* Sandberg Terrabass signature model
* MusicMan Stingray (used during the early days of the band)
* ESP Eclipse bass (used during the Sehnsucht tour)
* Sandberg Plasmabass 4-string custom built model
* Tech 21 SansAmp Bass Driver DI
* Glockenklang Heart-Rock Amp (Later rig) 
* Ampeg SVT-II (Early rig)
* Ampeg 8x10 Cabs

Riedel also uses selected overdrive/fuzz pedals for songs such as &quot;Mein Teil&quot; and &quot;Rosenrot&quot;.

<text>Ardnamurchan Point (, meaning &quot;the headland of the hill of the great sea&quot;) is a peninsula in Highland, Scotland where the Ardnamurchan Lighthouse is situated.

==Location==
Ardnamurchan Point lies at the western end of the Ardnamurchan peninsula in Lochaber, Highland, Scotland. Ardnamurchan Lighthouse is located on the Point, just over 2/3 of a mile (1 km) north of Corrachadh Mòr, the most westerly point on the island of Great Britain, which is a few metres further west than the Point. The nearest settlements are the crofting townships of Portuairk 1.2 miles (2 km) and Achosnich 1.8 miles (3 km), and the village of Kilchoan 5 miles (8 km).

The point lies seven miles south of the island of Muck, with Eigg and Rùm a few miles further to the north. Coll is situated nine miles to the west, and Mull is five miles south.

==Cultural references==
In 1990 the Scottish composer Judith Weir wrote a 10-minute piece for two pianos called &quot;Ardnamurchan Point&quot; for the pianists Edmund Niemann and Nurit Tilles.

The location is one of the boundary points of the Inshore coastal areas of the United Kingdom, and is mentioned in the Shipping Forecast, broadcast by BBC Radio 4 on behalf of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.

The lighthouse at Ardnamurchan Point featured in an episode of the BBC TV series, &quot;Top Gear&quot;, as the destination of a race, where the drivers had to be first to the lighthouse and fit a new bulb. This was Series 30, episode 3.

&#x27;Gazing from Ardnamurchan Point to the Hebrides&#x27; is a poem composed by Leslie Wheeldon. It is in memory to his much loved wife Kitty. The text of the poem sits in a memorial stone at the summit of Bickerton Hill Cheshire. The memorial is known as Kitty&#x27;s stone.

<doc id="856885" wikidata="Q3531327" url="?curid=856885" title="Tommy John">
<text>Thomas Edward John Jr. (born May 22, 1943), nicknamed &quot;the Bionic Man,&quot; is an American former professional baseball pitcher who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for 26 seasons between 1963 and 1989. He played for the Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, California Angels, and Oakland Athletics. He was a four-time MLB All-Star and has the second-most wins (288) of any pitcher since 1900 not in the Hall of Fame. Known for his longevity, John was the Opening Day starter six times – three for the White Sox (1966, 1970, and 1971) and three times for the Yankees (1981, 1982, and 1989).

At the age of 18, in 1961, John was signed by the Indians, who were impressed with his curveball. After three seasons in the minor leagues for them, he was called up for the first time in 1963. He pitched two seasons for Cleveland before getting traded to the White Sox, with whom he spent seven seasons. He established himself as a major league starter in 1965 and became Chicago&#x27;s Opening Day starter in 1966. In 1968, he finished fifth in the American League (AL) with a 1.98 earned run average (ERA) and was named to his first All-Star team, though he missed the end of the season after he was injured in a fight with Dick McAuliffe. In 1971, pitching coach Johnny Sain tried to have John throw a slider more, but John had his highest ERA since 1964 and was traded to the Dodgers for Dick Allen after the season. He won 11 games in 1972 with the Dodgers, then led the National League (NL) in winning percentage over the next two seasons (.696 in 1973 and .813 in 1974). In 1974, though, he suffered a potentially career-ending injury when he tore his ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) in a game against the Montreal Expos. Dr. Frank Jobe, the Dodger physician, performed ligament replacement surgery on John later that year. He missed the 1975 season recovering from surgery, but he became the first pitcher to successfully return to baseball following such surgery. &quot;Tommy John&quot; surgery has since become a common procedure among baseball pitchers, with 35.3% of MLB pitchers who were active in 2023 having received it at some point during their careers.

John had a 10–10 record his first year back from recovery. In 1977, at age 34, John had his first career 20-win season, going 20–7 with a 2.78 ERA as the Dodgers won the NL West and reached the 1977 World Series. He helped the Dodgers return to the World Series in 1978 with a 17–10 record before leaving for the Yankees as a free agent. With the Yankees, John posted 20-win seasons in 1979 and 1980; he was an All-Star in those years as well as in 1978, his final year with the Dodgers. He appeared in three World Series contested between the Dodgers and Yankees, his only World Series appearances, and pitched for the losing team in all three. He was traded to the California Angels in 1982, for whom he made two starts in the AL Championship Series. He remained with the team until 1985, when he was released, though he spent the second half of the season pitching for the Oakland Athletics. Unsigned to begin 1986, it appeared that John&#x27;s career might be over, but injuries to Yankee pitchers prompted New York to re-sign him. John won 13 games for the Yankees in 1987, then, at age 45, became the oldest player in baseball in 1988 following Phil Niekro&#x27;s retirement. In 1989, he tied Deacon McGuire&#x27;s record for most seasons pitched (26, later broken by Nolan Ryan, who ended with 27) before retiring.

From 1995 through 2009, John was on the Hall of Fame ballot; he never received more than 31.7% of the votes (75% is required for election). John is on the 2025 Hall of Fame ballot, along with seven other men, under consideration by the Classic Era Committee. He served as a broadcaster for the Minnesota Twins and the Yankees in the 1990s, then managed the Bridgeport Bluefish from 2007 through the first half of the 2009 season. Since retiring, he has served as a motivational speaker and also founded the &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It&quot; Foundation, dedicated to raising awareness about suicides and preventing them.

==Early life==
John grew up in Terre Haute, Indiana. As a youth, he often played sandlot ball with other kids, either at Spencer F. Ball Park or Woodrow Wilson field. Arley Andrews, a former minor league pitcher and a friend of John&#x27;s father, taught John to throw a curveball, which would be John&#x27;s main pitch. John was an outstanding baseball and basketball player at Gerstmeyer High School in Terre Haute, Indiana. He had a 28–2 record as a pitcher. Athletics did not get in the way of his schoolwork, as John graduated as Gerstmeyer&#x27;s 1961 valedictorian. School faculty forbade John from delivering a valedictory address because of his stutter. Several colleges recruited John as a basketball player, including the University of Kentucky, but John also caught the eye of Cleveland Indians&#x27; scout Johnny Schulte, who worried that John needed more of a fastball to succeed but considered his curveball already a major league pitch. John picked baseball and signed with the Indians after graduating, getting assigned to the Dubuque Packers of the Class D Midwest League.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues (1961–1963)===
John had a 10–4 record in 1961 but had some trouble with the Charleston Indians of the Class A Eastern League in 1962. &quot;I was rearing back on every pitch and firing with all my strength at the strike zone,&quot; he said. &quot;As a result I kept getting behind in the ball-and-strike count, often running it to three balls and no strikes, so I just had to put my fastball right over the plate and get it creamed.&quot; This led to a lot of walks, but player-coach Steve Jankowski worked with him, suggesting that John throw less hard so that he would have more control. The alterations helped John get called up to the Class AAA Jacksonville Suns of the International League during the year, and John won two games for them with the playoffs. He started 1963 with Jacksonville, got sent down to Charleston, went 9–2 with a 1.61 ERA for the West Virginian Indians, and got called up to the major leagues in September at the age of twenty.

===Cleveland Indians (1963–1964)===
On September 6, 1963, John started what would become a 26-year major league career, allowing one unearned run in one inning of a 7–2 loss to the Washington Senators. Used at first as a reliever, he finished the year with three starts. Though his record was 0–2, his earned run average (ERA) was 2.21. Cleveland manager Birdie Tebbetts called his fastball &quot;deceptive.&quot;

In his first start of 1964, on May 3, John threw a shutout against the Baltimore Orioles for his first major league win in the second game of a doubleheader. He won two of his first three games but then lost eight decisions in a row and got sent to AAA (now the Portland Beavers of the Pacific Coast League) in July. Indians&#x27; pitching coach Early Wynn had been trying to get John to throw a slider, but John altered his grip, affecting his control. He returned to throwing just a fastball and a curveball in the minors and was called up for a few games in September by the Indians. After the season, he was sent to the Chicago White Sox as part of a three-way trade between Cleveland, Chicago, and the Kansas City Athletics that sent Rocky Colavito to Cleveland.

===Chicago White Sox (1965–1971)===
John&#x27;s first appearances with the White Sox were in relief. During the first half of the 1965 season, he and Juan Pizarro alternatively spent time as Chicago&#x27;s fifth starter in the rotation. By the second half, however, he had cemented himself within the team&#x27;s starting rotation. September 25, he held the New York Yankees to one run and hit a go-ahead home run against Bill Stafford to give himself a 3–1 victory. In 39 games (27 starts), he had a 14–7 record, a 3.09 ERA, 126 strikeouts, 58 walks, and 162 hits allowed in innings.

By 1966, manager Eddie Stanky had made John his Opening Day starter. He tied for the American League (AL) lead with five shutouts during the season. Two of these, May 7 against the Detroit Tigers and August 12 against the California Angels, came on days when the White Sox only scored one run for him. In 34 games (33 starts), he had a 14–11 record, a 2.62 ERA, 138 strikeouts, 57 walks, and 195 hits in 223 innings. His 2.62 ERA placed fifth in the league, and his 10 complete games tied for ninth (with Mudcat Grant).

Once again in 1967, John led the AL in shutouts, this time with six. He had a season-high nine strikeouts in a shutout of the Senators on June 13. On July 4, he shut out the defending-World Series champion Orioles, limiting Baltimore to two hits. July 22, he left a game against the Athletics after facing just two batters and did not pitch again until August 20. He was plagued in the season&#x27;s second half by a severe gastrointestinal virus that caused him to lose 28 pounds. At season&#x27;s end, his record was just 10–13, but his 2.47 ERA ranked fourth in the league. He had 110 strikeouts, 47 walks, and 143 hits allowed in innings.

1968 started out as John&#x27;s best season thus far in his career. On June 30, he shut out the Tigers in a 12–0 victory. With a 1.78 ERA in the first half, he was named to the All-Star Game for the first time in his career. Another highlight came against Cleveland August 9, when he held the Indians scoreless for seven innings and scored the only run of the game. He had a 1.98 ERA through 25 starts with the White Sox in 1968. August 22 of that year, with a 3-2 count on Dick McAuliffe, John threw ball four over McAuliffe&#x27;s head. An angry McAuliffe charged the mound and started a fight between the two players. McAuliffe was fined and suspended; John was not punished, but he tore some shoulder ligaments in the scuffle and missed the rest of the season with an injury. Thirty years later, McAuliffe said in an interview that he still thought John was trying to hit him in that game. White Sox&#x27; general manager (GM) Ed Short noted that this was unlikely given that the pitch before the fight came on a 3-2 count, resulting in a walk for McAuliffe. Though pitcher ERAs were down across baseball in 1968, John&#x27;s still ranked fifth in the league. He had a 10–5 record and gave up just 135 hits in innings.

John recovered in time for the 1969 season, though Gary Peters got the Opening Day start, with John second in the rotation. In his first start of the year, against the Athletics on April 9, John allowed only four hits in a complete game shutout, as Chicago won 3–0. He held the Indians scoreless for innings on May 10, earning the victory as the White Sox prevailed by a score of 4–0. On June 20, in the first game of a doubleheader, he held the Angels to one run over 10 innings but received a no-decision in a 12-inning, 2–1 defeat. John was 6–11 on September 1, but he won his last three decisions to finish the season 9–11. In one of those wins, on September 19, he allowed eight hits but no runs in a 7–0 victory over the Kansas City Royals. In 33 starts, John had a 3.25 ERA, 128 strikeouts, 90 walks, and 230 hits allowed in innings.

In 1970, John got the Opening Day start but struggled, giving up six runs (five earned) in innings as the Twins beat the White Sox 12–0 on April 7. In fact, he lost his first five starts before defeating the Orioles on April 30. On June 12, he allowed only two hits in a complete game shutout over the Senators, as the White Sox won the game 6–0. He lost four starts in a row after that game, then won his next five decisions. On July 26, he allowed seven hits in a complete game shutout of the Tigers, which the White Sox won 4–0. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Yankees on August 23, he allowed only four hits in a complete game shutout that the White Sox won 2–0. John finished the year with a 12–17 record. His 17 losses tied teammate Gerry Janeski for third in the AL, and teammate Joe Horlen was fifth with 16. John also finished fourth in walks (101, behind Sam McDowell&#x27;s 131, Mickey Lolich&#x27;s 109, and Jim Rooker&#x27;s 102), and he led the AL in wild pitches, throwing what would be a career-high 17. His ERA was 3.27, he struck out 138 hitters, and he had fewer hits allowed (253) than innings pitched (). Despite all his losses, he was the only Chicago pitcher to start 10 or more games and post an ERA under 4.75.

Johnny Sain became the White Sox&#x27; pitching coach in 1971, and he was determined to get John to throw a slider more. This caused trouble for John, who had his highest ERA since 1964. Through his first 11 games, his ERA was 6.08, but he posted a 2.97 ERA in his last 27 games. In the first game of a doubleheader against the defending World Champion Orioles on May 31, he threw a shutout in a 1–0 victory. On June 17, he held the Twins to three runs over 10 innings. The White Sox pinch-hit for him in the 11th, took a 6–3 lead, then lost 7–6 after three relievers gave up four runs in the bottom of the inning. He struck out a season-high nine hitters on June 29 but also gave up four runs (two earned) in a 5–2 loss to the Milwaukee Brewers. In 38 games (35 starts), he had a 13–16 record, a 3.61 ERA, three shutouts, 131 strikeouts, 58 walks, and 244 hits in innings pitched. His 16 losses tied him for seventh in the AL with Ray Culp and Dick Bosman.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (1972–1978)===
John was traded along with Steve Huntz from the White Sox to the Los Angeles Dodgers for Dick Allen at the Winter Meetings on December 2, 1971. He got along much better with Red Adams, the Dodger pitching coach, who encouraged John to use his soft fastball instead of trying to rely on his breaking pitches. &quot;You&#x27;ll get plenty of batters out with that,&quot; Adams said, praising the movement John put on his fastball. He gave up 13 hits and five runs on July 12 but was allowed to complete the game as the Dodgers beat the Philadelphia Phillies by a score of 9–5. Six days later, he pitched nine innings and only allowed one unearned run but settled for a no-decision, as the Dodgers defeated the New York Mets 2–1 in the 10th inning. On August 3, he gave up only three hits in a complete game, 3–0 shutout victory over the San Francisco Giants. Though John made 29 starts for the Dodgers in 1972, his season ended prematurely on September 23, due to an injury suffered in a game against the Giants. John singled against Frank Reberger in the third, advanced to second on a walk, and attempted to score on a single by Bill Buckner. As he slid into home, though (where he was called out), he jammed his throwing elbow hard into the ground, dislodging bone chips. He pitched more innings before getting taken out of the game, but took the remainder of the year off and had surgery to clear out the elbow. John had an 11–5 record, a 2.89 ERA, 117 strikeouts, 40 walks, and 172 hits allowed in innings. His .688 winning percentage was fifth in the National League (NL).

In his first start of 1973 for the Dodgers, on April 8 against the San Diego Padres, John threw scoreless ball for innings, earning the win in a 4–0 victory. On June 18, he allowed eight runs in only one inning as the Dodgers were defeated 16–3 by the Phillies, but only two were earned (the rest were due to a Ron Cey error). He held the Chicago Cubs to five hits on July 13 in a 5–0, complete game shutout victory. On August 24, he had a better start against the Phillies, limiting them to three hits in a 3–0, complete game shutout victory. That game was the first of six straight decisions John would win through the end of the season. With a 16–7 record at season&#x27;s end, John tied with three others for seventh in the NL in wins and led the NL with a .696 winning percentage. He recorded 116 strikeouts, 50 walks, and 202 hits allowed in 218 innings of work.

John began 1974 as the Dodgers&#x27; number two starter, behind Don Sutton in the rotation. He threw a shutout against the Padres in his first start on April 6, then threw eight shutout innings against the Atlanta Braves four days later. On April 25, he held the Phillies to four hits and no runs in a complete game shutout that the Dodgers won 1–0. The win was his fifth in five games. After a loss on May 5, he won five decisions in a row, not losing again until June 18. From June 28 through July 7, he won three straight starts.

====1974–1975: Tommy John surgery====

In the middle of an excellent 1974 season, John had a 13–3 record as the Dodgers were en route to their first NL pennant in eight years. He led the NL in wins coming into the All-Star break but was left off the roster, as the Dodgers already had Andy Messersmith and Mike Marshall on the team. &quot;If I don&#x27;t belong on the team, there is no justice in baseball,&quot; John said on July 17. &quot;It really sets you back. I&#x27;ve had a great year, I&#x27;ve worked hard and yet I can&#x27;t even get picked for the All-Star team.&quot; Bigger disappointment followed for John in that evening&#x27;s game against the Montreal Expos. With the Dodgers leading 4–0 in the third inning, John tried to throw a sinking fastball to Hal Breeden. Suddenly, he felt the &quot;strangest sensation I had ever known...right at the point where I put force on the pitch, the point where my arm is back and bent, something happened,&quot; he explained. &quot;It felt as if I had left my arm someplace else. It was as if my body continued to go forward and my left arm had just flown out to right field, independent of the rest of me.&quot; John had permanently damaged the ulnar collateral ligament in his pitching arm; he threw one more pitch before having manager Walt Alston remove him from the game. Initially, he was uncertain how serious the injury was; Dr. Frank Jobe, the Dodgers&#x27; team physician, advised John to rest the arm for a few days and treat it with ice. After a month, though, the injury had not improved. John attempted to pitch batting practice in New York, and when he failed to get much velocity on his pitches, he told Alston he was likely done for the season. In 22 starts for the Dodgers, he had a 13–3 record, a 2.59 ERA, 78 strikeouts, 42 walks, and 133 hits allowed in 153 innings. He also threw three shutouts and led the NL with a .813 winning percentage.

With his career in doubt, John decided to allow Dr. Jobe to attempt a revolutionary surgical operation, ulnar collateral ligament reconstruction. This operation, colloquially known as &#x27;Tommy John surgery&#x27;, replaced the ligament in the elbow of John&#x27;s pitching arm with a tendon from his right forearm. Though the procedure had actually been performed on other people before, it was usually conducted on wrists and hands; John was the first baseball pitcher to have it done on his elbow. The surgery was performed on September 25, 1974, and it took four hours; Jobe made holes in the humerus and ulna bones of John&#x27;s left arm and used anchors to insert the tendon in what was roughly a figure-eight shape. It seemed unlikely John would ever be able to pitch again, as most pitchers in the past who had surgery on their arms never were effective again. Jobe gave the operation 100-1 odds of being successful, but John had it anyway, as his other option was to start working at a friend&#x27;s car dealership in Terre Haute.

The recovery was long and slow. Initially, John&#x27;s left hand was shriveled and he lacked feeling in several of his fingers, due to damage to the ulnar nerve; Jobe performed a second procedure to reroute the nerve that was necessary to John&#x27;s full recovery. His arm was in a cast until January 1975, and once it was removed, John began performing exercises seven days a week to rebuild strength in the arm. He attended spring training with the Dodgers in 1975, by which point he had recovered the full range of motion of his arm but still lacked feeling in some of his fingers, preventing him from gripping the ball properly. For six weeks, he would tape the fingers that lacked feeling to ones that had it, then feebly throw balls against a wall for a while. John also worked with teammate and pitcher Mike Marshall, who had a Master&#x27;s degree in kinesiology and who was said to know how to help pitchers recover from injuries, on learning a different grip to use while pitching. In the midst of doubts about his ability to come back, John kept repeating Luke 1:37 to himself: &quot;For with God, nothing shall be impossible.&quot;

Finally, in June, feeling came back to John&#x27;s injured fingers. His velocity started to improve in July, and by September, he was healthy enough to pitch in an off-season instructional league in Arizona. Beginning September 29, John made five appearances with the team, throwing as many as seven innings by his final one.

====1976–1978: The comeback====
John returned to the Dodgers in 1976, the fourth starter in their rotation after spending all of the previous year on the disabled list. On April 16, he made his comeback, against the Braves at Fulton County Stadium. &quot;I was back in my office,&quot; John later described the day. &quot;I took a year-and-a-half hiatus to, you know, go abroad and study and learn the dynamics of nuclear fission, or something like that. I did all that, and now I was back at work.&quot; Though he allowed three runs in five innings and took the loss, it was the first time any pitcher had started a game following UCL reconstruction surgery. Darrell Evans of the Braves called the return a &quot;miracle.&quot; Soon, players and writers were referring to John as &quot;The Bionic Man.&quot;

Five days after the Atlanta game, in a 1–0 loss to the Houston Astros, John threw seven scoreless innings. On June 13, he threw his first complete game since the injury, also against the Expos, whom he held to three runs in a 6–3 victory. He threw a four-hit shutout against the Padres on July 23 and a 10-hit shutout against the Cincinnati Reds on September 14. John would make 31 starts for the Dodgers in 1976, posting a 10–10 record, a 3.09 ERA, 91 strikeouts, 61 walks, and 207 hits allowed in 207 innings pitched. In recognition of John&#x27;s accomplishments, the &quot;Sporting News&quot; awarded him its NL Comeback Player of the Year Award, and John also won the Fred Hutchinson Award, presented annually to a player who shows outstanding character and courage. &quot;I thank God every day for being able to pitch,&quot; John told &quot;The New York Times&quot; after his comeback. &quot;If I win, thanks for letting me win, if I lose, thanks for letting me lose because that&#x27;s better than being on the sidelines.&quot;

Dissatisfied with his contract entering spring training in 1977, John threatened to file for free agency after the season. However, he ultimately signed a two-year, $400,000 contract to stay with the Dodgers. Through June 12, he had a 6–4 record and a 4.08 ERA. Starting June 18, John won 10 consecutive decisions, not losing another ballgame until August 19 against the Cubs. He had a 1.32 ERA during the winning streak, and his ERA from June 18 to the end of the season was 2.19. He threw a complete game shutout against the Padres on July 16, allowing just four hits in a 1–0 victory. On August 8, he held the defending World Series champion Reds to two hits in a 4–0 complete game shutout victory. He threw a shutout in his next start too, allowing four hits in an 11–0 victory over Atlanta on August 13. John won 20 games for the first time in his career in 1977, his 14th season in Major League Baseball, finishing with a 20–7 record. He ranked among the NL leaders in wins (third, tied with Bob Forsch, Rick Reuschel, and John Candelaria) and ERA (2.78, fifth). John finished 12th in NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting and was second in voting for the NL Cy Young Award, bested by Steve Carlton, who led the NL with 23 wins.

With a 98–64 record, the Dodgers won the NL West. For John, who had been injured when the Dodgers won the division in 1974, it was his first chance to pitch in the playoffs. He started Game 1 of the NL Championship Series (NLCS) against the Phillies, but only lasted innings. He gave up four unearned runs, the result of two errors by Bill Russell, the Dodger shortstop. That was the only Dodger loss of the series, though, and John won the last game of the series four days later, allowing seven hits but one run in rainy weather as the Dodgers beat the Phillies 4–1 in Game 4. In both of his NLCS starts, John gave up fewer runs than his opponent on the mound, Carlton. The Dodgers faced the New York Yankees in the 1977 World Series; John started Game 3 but gave up five runs (four earned) over six innings, including three in the first inning, as the Yankees won 5–3. Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda said John would start Game 7 if the series went that far, but the Yankees clinched it in six games, making Game 3 John&#x27;s only appearance in the loss.

John won all four of his starts in April 1978, throwing complete games in the last three. On May 17, he held the Pittsburgh Pirates to four hits and one run, striking out seven in a complete game, 10–1 victory. In the second game of a doubleheader against the Houston Astros on July 8, he relieved Bob Welch in the sixth inning and threw four shutout innings, picking up the victory in Los Angeles&#x27;s 7–5 triumph. With a 10–6 record and a 3.80 ERA halfway through the season, John was named to the NL All-Star team, his first selection to an All-Star Team in 10 years and the first of three in a row for him. In a complete game against Montreal on August 29, he held the Expos to one unearned run in a complete game, 4–1 victory. In 33 games (30 starts), he had a 17–10 record, a 3.30 ERA, 124 strikeouts, 53 walks, and 230 hits allowed in 213 innings. He finished eighth in Cy Young Award voting.

For the second year in a row, the Dodgers won the NL West and faced the Phillies in the NLCS. The Game 2 starter, John threw a four-hit shutout as the Dodgers won 4–0. After the Phillies won Game 3, the Dodgers won Game 4 to set up another playoff rematch, this time with the Yankees in the 1978 World Series. John started Game 1, giving up five runs (only three of which were earned) in innings but earning the win in Los Angeles&#x27;s 11–5 victory. In Game 4, he had held the Yankees to two runs (one earned) through seven innings before getting removed in the eighth after giving up a leadoff single to Paul Blair. Blair went on to score, and John got a no-decision in a 10-inning, 4–3 loss. For the second year in a row, New York won the series in six games.

With his contract up at the end of the season, John became a free agent. On November 21, he signed a three-year, $1.4 million contract with the New York Yankees. Though the Royals and the Reds had both offered more money, John chose the Yankees because, as he said, &quot;I like to play for a winner.&quot;

===New York Yankees (1979–1982)===
John won his first nine decisions as a Yankee, including shutout victories on April 12 and May 20, 1979. Through July 6, he was leading the AL in wins and had a 13–3 record, as he had five years earlier with the Dodgers, before the surgery. That day, he threw a complete game shutout in a 3–0 victory over the Athletics. He held the Indians to three hits on September 19, getting removed with two outs in the ninth after allowing a single to Toby Harrah but still earning the win as the Yankees defeated the Indians 2–0. John finished the year with a 21–9 record, 111 strikeouts (it was the last season he would have more than 100 strikeouts), 65 walks, and 268 hits allowed in innings pitched. He was second to teammate Ron Guidry in ERA (2.96; Guidry&#x27;s was 2.78), and he was second to Mike Flanagan in wins (Flanagan had 23). John finished 22nd in MVP voting and was the runner-up in Cy Young voting again, this time to Flanagan.

After taking a no-decision in his first start of the 1980 season, John won seven starts in a row, not losing until May 20. From June 30 through July 22, he won five starts in a row, and from August 29 through September 13, he won four starts in a row. John pitched particularly well against the White Sox, throwing shutouts all three times he faced them, including a two-hit performance on April 16 when he retired 13 hitters in a row at one point. On May 11, he held the Twins to six hits in a 5–0 shutout victory. He allowed just two hits on June 6 in a 3–0 shutout victory over the Seattle Mariners. On July 22, he held Milwaukee to four hits in the first game of a doubleheader, throwing a shutout as the Yankees defeated the Brewers 3–0. No other AL pitcher would win 20 games in back-to-back years until Roger Clemens did it in 1986 and &#x27;87. In 36 starts, John won a career-high 22 games while losing nine, recording a 3.43 ERA, 78 strikeouts, 56 walks, and 270 hits allowed in innings pitched. His six shutouts led the AL, the first time in 13 years he led a league in that category. He tied with Mike Norris for second in the AL in wins, behind Steve Stone&#x27;s 25. John finished fourth in Cy Young Award voting. The Yankees won the AL East with a 103–59 record, and John started Game 3, with the Yankees facing elimination by the Royals after losing the first two games. With the Yankees leading 2–1 in the seventh, John retired the first two batters but was replaced by Rich Gossage after giving up a double to Willie Wilson; Gossage gave up a home run to George Brett a couple batters later, and the Yankees lost 4–2, though John was not credited with a decision.

&quot;I&#x27;d like to pitch as long as I can effectively do the job,&quot; John told &quot;The New York Times&quot; during 1981 spring training. &quot;I think I can start another two or three years. I also think I could pitch out of the bullpen for two or three years a la Steve Hamilton and Jim Kaat. I think I could do that effectively - as long as somebody would want to pay me to do it. Everybody needs lefthanded pitching, especially in the bullpen.&quot; He made his first Opening Day start for the Yankees on April 9, allowing three runs (two earned) in eight innings as the Yankees beat the Texas Rangers by a score of 10–3. His season was interrupted by the 1981 Major League Baseball strike and also by an incident that occurred on August 13. While the John family was at their vacation home on the Jersey shore, John&#x27;s two-year-old son Travis toppled out a window and fell three stories onto the hood of a parked car. He was in a coma for about two weeks. John was warming up for a game against the Tigers when he found out the news. He went on national television asking people to pray for his son, and he received permission from the Yankees to stay in New York with his son while he recovered, pitching only home games in the immediate aftermath of the accident while staying at the Grand Hyatt Hotel near the N.Y.U. Medical Center. Hundreds of letters and cards poured in from well-wishers, including people who wrote that they hated the Yankees and George Steinbrenner but were rooting for Travis to pull through. President Ronald Reagan sent Travis a get-well card, as did former Presidents Richard Nixon and Jimmy Carter. Frank Sinatra sent a telegram. Travis ultimately made a full recovery; he threw out the first pitch at a playoff game against the Brewers later that year, and by 1988, he was playing Little League Baseball with his brothers.

By August 29, John was back to pitching road games for the Yankees. With a 9–5 record on September 14, he finished the year on a three-game losing streak, though that included a September 25 start against the Orioles where he allowed one run in a complete game, 1–0 loss. In 20 starts, John had a 9–8 record, 50 strikeouts, 39 walks, and 135 hits allowed in innings pitched. His 2.63 ERA ranked fourth in the AL. Though he had led the AL in shutouts the previous year, he had zero in 1981.

Because of the strike, MLB divided the season into two halves and added an extra playoff round, the Division Series, in which the first half and second-half winners of the two divisions would play each other. The Yankees had the AL East&#x27;s best record in the first half and faced the Brewers in the Division Series. With the Yankees up two games to none in the best of five series, John started Game 3 but gave up five runs in seven innings, taking the loss in a 5–3 defeat. The Brewers won Game 4 as well, but the Yankees won Game 5 to clinch the series victory. John allowed just one run against the Athletics in Game 1 of the ALCS, earning the win, but he was replaced on the mound by Ron Davis after the sixth inning because his right ankle was bothering him. Though he felt good enough to remain in the game, Yankee manager Bob Lemon did not want to risk further injury: &quot;If something happened, I&#x27;d be worried about it all winter,&quot; Lemon said. He would not get a chance to pitch again in the series, as New York defeated Oakland in three games. The 1981 World Series was the third Dodger-Yankee World Series John had been a part of, though it was his first with New York. He picked up the win in his Game 2 start, retiring the first 12 batters he faced and throwing seven shutout innings in a 3–0 triumph. In Game 4, he was sent in during the seventh inning of a 6–6 tie because the bases were loaded, and John had a propensity for inducing ground balls, which would have likely resulted in an out and possibly a double play. Instead, Steve Yeager hit a sacrifice fly against him, and Davey Lopes added an RBI single; the runs did not count on John&#x27;s record, but the Yankees lost the game 8–7. With the Yankees down to the Dodgers 3 games to 2, John started Game 6. He held the Dodgers to one run over four innings but was pinch-hit for by Bobby Murcer in the fourth. &quot;I was trying to get a run ahead so I could get to the seventh inning and bring Goose in,&quot; explained Lemon. The Yankees failed to score that inning, and the relievers did not pitch well, enabling the Dodgers to win the game and the series. Will Grimsley of the Associated Press called the decision to pull John &quot;a glaring error.&quot;

After the 1981 season, John won the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award, presented by Phi Delta Theta to &quot;the Major League Baseball Player who best exemplifies the spirit and character of Brother Lou Gehrig, both on and off the field.&quot; The Yankees and John nearly went to arbitration after 1981 but ultimately agreed to a two-year, $1.7 million contract. &quot;I&#x27;m glad to get it over with and get it put to bed,&quot; John said after signing. &quot;It&#x27;s like in a marriage. If you have an argument and patch it up fast, it&#x27;s okay. But the longer you let it go, the harder it is to reconcile it.&quot; Through June 25 of 1982, though his record was just 5–7, he had a 2.95 ERA. From then through July 5, he posted a 6.67 ERA in six games (five starts). John clashed with the Yankees&#x27; front office over the move and also over their failure to give him a $200,000 loan that was promised in his contract; in early August, the pitcher threatened to start a breach of contract case that would sever his Yankee contract. He did not stay in the bullpen long, as doubleheaders forced the Yankees to require another starter and John pitched well upon his return to the rotation. However, on August 31, he was traded to the California Angels for three minor league players who would be named later. In 30 games (26 starts) for the Yankees, John had posted a 10–10 record, a 3.66 ERA, 54 strikeouts, 34 walks, and 190 hits allowed in innings, throwing two shutouts as well.

===California Angels (1982–1985) and Oakland Athletics (1985)===
California was interested in John because it was contending for the AL West title. In his first start with the team on September 3, John held the Brewers to two runs (neither earned) in a complete game, 5–2 victory. John made seven starts, posting a 4–2 record, a 3.86 ERA, 14 strikeouts, five walks, and 49 hits allowed in 35 innings pitched as the Angels clinched the AL West. His combined totals between New York and California were a 14–12 record, a 3.69 ERA, 68 strikeouts, 39 walks, and 239 hits allowed in innings. John started Game 1 of the ALCS against the Brewers, allowing three runs in a complete game, 8–3 victory. When Game 4 arrived, instead of starting 13-game winner Ken Forsch, manager Gene Mauch opted to start John on three days rest. John gave up six runs (four earned) over innings as the Brewers defeated the Angels 9–5; the Brewers went on to win the series in five games.

Before the 1983 season, Angel GM Buzzie Bavasi extended John&#x27;s contract for three years. Assistant GM Mike Port disagreed with the decision because he thought John was too old. California&#x27;s number two starter, John had a 6–2 record and a 3.43 ERA through June 9. Thereafter, he only won five of 16 decisions, and his ERA was 4.84. Twice, he had extended outings for the Angels. In the second game of a doubleheader against Oakland on July 30, he gave up two runs over 12 innings but took the loss when Rickey Henderson had an RBI single in the 12th to bring home the go-ahead run. Yet that was not his longest outing of the year; he pitched 13 shutout innings on September 14 against the Royals. California never scored, however, and the Angels lost in the 14th once relief pitchers entered the game. In 34 starts, John had an 11–13 record, a 4.33 ERA (the highest it had ever been in his career), 65 strikeouts, and 49 walks in innings. He led the AL in hits allowed with 287, and 1983 would be the last time he would top 200 innings in a season.

In 1984, John had a 2.48 ERA through June 2 but a 6.13 ERA thereafter. In the second game of a doubleheader against Boston on July 8, though, he threw a complete-game shutout in a 4–0 victory. He was removed from the rotation at the beginning of September when Geoff Zahn came off the disabled list, though he returned for two starts later in the month after Bruce Kison was removed. In 32 games (29 starts), he had a 7–13 record, a 4.52 ERA, 47 strikeouts, 56 walks, and 223 hits allowed in innings pitched.

Port succeeded Bavasi as the Angel GM in 1985, and no coach worked with John at all during spring training until he finally asked Frank Reberger to assist him. That season, John posted a 4.70 ERA in 12 games, only six of which were starts. In May, the Angels opted to use only four starters for much of the month, and John was the odd man out. The Angels considered trading him for Dick Ruthven of the Cubs but opted not to because Ruthven was owed $400,000 in a deferred salary. In June, John left the team to be with his mother, who was battling cancer. She died of the disease on June 19. That same day, the Angels released him. The Oakland Athletics signed him nearly a month later, on July 12; John made three rehab starts in the minor leagues before debuting with Oakland on the 26th. He won that game, pitching six innings and allowing one run (unearned) against the Brewers in a 4–3 triumph. Facing the Yankees on August 27, he threw seven shutout innings, allowing just three hits and earning the victory in a 3–0 triumph. Those were his only wins with Oakland, though; he lost his next five decisions and finished with a 2–6 record and a 6.19 ERA in 11 starts. His combined totals for the season were a 4–10 record, a 5.53 ERA, 25 strikeouts, 28 walks, and 117 hits allowed in innings pitched. After the season, he became a free agent.

===Second stint with the Yankees (1986–1989)===
John went unsigned to begin 1986, and it looked like his career might be over. He attended spring training with the Yankees, though, and though he did not make the roster, the Yankees informed him that they would consider him if they needed pitchers later in the year. Injuries to Ed Whitson and John Montefusco in May prompted the Yankees to re-sign their former pitcher. Inserted into the rotation, he won his first three decisions for the Yankees before losing a game on June 7. However, on June 12, he was placed on the 21-day disabled list with a strained left Achilles tendon; the injury kept him out of action until August 8. On August 24, rookie Mark McGwire of the Athletics had two hits off him. McGwire&#x27;s father happened to be John&#x27;s dentist, and John told reporters, &quot;When your dentist&#x27;s kid starts hitting you, it&#x27;s time to retire!&quot; He went on to pitch three more seasons, however. Against the Mariners in the first game of a doubleheader on August 30, he took the loss but allowed just one run in eight innings in what would be his last start of the year. On September 4, he fell down while warming up on muddy soil and injured his left thumb while trying to break his fall, ending his season. In 13 games (10 starts), he had a 5–3 record, a 2.93 ERA, 28 strikeouts, 15 walks, and 73 hits allowed in innings pitched. He also made three starts for the Class A Fort Lauderdale Yankees, winning two and not allowing an earned run in innings.

During the 1986 season, John had agreed to become the pitching coach for the University of North Carolina (UNC) later in the year, meaning he would likely retire. However, he resigned from the UNC position on November 21 due to &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; with head coach Mike Roberts. In his 1991 autobiography, John stated that the reasons he resigned were that Roberts, after promising John two cars and six season tickets to UNC basketball games for coming to work for UNC, tried to cut the deal back to one car and no tickets. Roberts also used John&#x27;s name on promotional materials for baseball camps without John&#x27;s permission. After resigning from UNC, John signed a contract for $350,000, provided he made the team out of spring training. On April 19 and April 26, 1987, he threw seven shutout innings in consecutive starts, only allowing one hit on the 26th in a 14–2 win over Cleveland. Pitching on three days&#x27; rest on August 8, he threw a two-hit shutout against the Tigers, the last he would throw in his career. On October 2, he gave up just one run in a complete game, 3–1 triumph over Baltimore. In 33 starts, John had a 13–6 record, a 4.03 ERA, 63 strikeouts, 47 walks, and 212 hits allowed in innings pitched.

After Phil Niekro&#x27;s retirement, John became the oldest player in the major leagues in 1988; he turned 45 on May 22. On April 27, he held the Royals to two hits and no runs in innings, though Kansas City ultimately won 3–1. For the first time since 1963 (a year he only made three starts), he did not complete a game; his longest outing came on May 14, when he allowed two runs over innings in a 6–2 victory over the Angels. On July 27, he set a record by committing three errors on one play against the Brewers. First, he dropped a ground ball hit back to the mound by Jeffrey Leonard. Picking it up, he threw it about 10 feet wide of first base. Jim Gantner tried to score, and John cut off a throw to home, then threw it by the head of the catcher, incredibly, for his &quot;third&quot; error on the play. However, he would pitch eight innings as the Yankees went on to win 16–3. In 35 games (32 starts), he had a 9–8 record, a 4.49 ERA, 81 strikeouts, 46 walks, and 221 hits allowed in innings. Bill Madden of the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; speculated that John, a ground-ball pitcher, suffered from late-season injuries to Yankee infielders Willie Randolph and Mike Pagliarulo, their replacements not being quite as capable fielders. Ten times, he left a game after at least five innings with a lead and received a no-decision, often due to runners he had left on base scoring when relievers replaced him. At 45, he was the only Yankee starting pitcher to go the full year without missing time due to injury.

By 1989, John was doing a &quot;ten-part cardiovascular and muscular endurance program&quot; which Jeff Mangold, the Yankees&#x27; former strength coach, had helped him develop. At 45, he was the Opening Day starter for the Yankees, his first Opening Day start for the ballclub in eight years, allowing two runs in seven innings and outpitching 1988 AL Cy Young Award winner Frank Viola as the Yankees defeated the Twins 4–2 on April 4. With the start, John matched Deacon McGuire&#x27;s record for most MLB seasons played with 26, a record that would later be broken by Nolan Ryan. On April 27, he held the Royals to two runs over eight-plus innings, picking up his 288th (and final) victory. He lost four games in May, though, allowing five or more runs in each of his outings. On May 25, he allowed five runs in innings against the Angels, receiving a no-decision in an 8–6 Yankee victory. That game would be his last appearance for the Yankees, who released him at the end of the month. In 10 starts for New York, John had a 2–7 record, a 5.80 ERA, 18 strikeouts, 22 walks, and 87 hits allowed in innings.

==Career statistics==
John finished his career with a 288–231 record, a 3.34 ERA, 2,245 strikeouts, 1,259 walks, and 4,783 hits allowed in innings pitched. After pitching for 26 years, he ranked among baseball&#x27;s all-time leaders in wins (26th), losses (19th), innings pitched (20th), hits allowed (10th), earned runs allowed (1,749, 16th), games started (700, eighth), shutouts (46, 26th), batters faced (19,692, 18th), and wild pitches (187, 17th). He had 188 career no decisions, an all-time MLB record among starting pitchers (dating back to at least 1908). Of Hall-of-Fame-eligible pitchers since 1900, Roger Clemens (whose career is tainted by steroids allegations) is the only one with more wins than John not to be elected to the Hall of Fame.

Though John was nearing the 300 win club at the end of his career, he had not necessarily intended to pitch long enough to reach the milestone. &quot;You&#x27;d like to stay around long enough to win 300, but that&#x27;s not the ultimate goal for me,&quot; he said in 1987. &quot;My kids are getting older, and it&#x27;s tougher for us to move as much as we used to. I decided that wherever we go, we go as a group. The kids have a lifetime contract with us.&quot; After the Yankees released him in 1989, he planned to keep working out and throwing in case another ballclub signed him; none did, however, and the season was his last.

==National Baseball Hall of Fame consideration==
John first appeared on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot in 1995. He earned 21.3% of the vote, but 75% is required for induction. Over the next several years, his vote totals rose and fell, but through 2008, he had never received more than 29.6% of the vote. In , in his 15th and final year of eligibility for election on the main ballot, John received a career-high 31.7% of the vote, but this was still not enough for election. He could still enter the Hall if he were selected by the Modern Era Subcommittee of the Veterans Committee. John was announced as one of the finalists for the Modern Baseball Era ballot; however, he was not one of the inductees. He appeared on the Classic Baseball Era Committee&#x27;s ballot, but only received seven of the necessary 12 votes required for election.

In a Yahoo Sports article in 2017, Chris Cwik discussed the pros and cons of John&#x27;s Hall of Fame case. Pros Cwik mentioned were that his 111 Adjusted ERA+ was better than that of Sutton or Early Wynn (both Hall of Famers) and that his surgery has revolutionized the game. Cons were that he never led the league in wins or strikeouts or won a Cy Young Award, and his 288 wins and 3.34 ERA were more &quot;borderline&quot; Hall of Fame credentials. Craig Calcaterra of NBC Sports also did a pro-con analysis in 2019. On the pro side, Calcaterra noted that he was above average during his long career; on the con side, he too noted that John never led the league in wins or strikeouts, writing &quot;John was simply not dominant in any way — his ERA+ was a not-very-Hall-of-Famer–111 — even if he was pretty darn dependable and even if he ate innings like crazy.&quot; Analyzing John&#x27;s wins above replacement value on several statistical sites (ranging from over 60 to 79.1), Brett Ballantini of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; said in 2020, &quot;This is a guy who, irrespective of any surgery named after him, is a guy whose baseball career alone simply says he&#x27;s a Hall of Famer.&quot; In a 2016 interview, John pointed out that his 164 wins following the surgery were one shy of the amount that Hall of Famer Sandy Koufax had over his entire career.

==Legacy==

John went on to win 164 games after having the surgery, 40 more than before. His successful comeback proved once and for all that baseball players could still be successful after undergoing major surgery. In 2012, Lindsey Berra of ESPN noted that roughly one in seven major league pitchers had undergone Tommy John surgery at some point in their careers. &quot;It&#x27;s become an accepted side effect of the job,&quot; said George Paletta, team physician for the St. Louis Cardinals. Doug Miller of MLB.com wrote that &quot;baseball history was altered – some would say saved – forever&quot; when John returned from his recovery, observing that &quot;Today, the tearing of a pitcher&#x27;s ulnar collateral ligament is no longer a career-ending calamity.&quot; ESPN personality Dan Patrick and longtime baseball commentator Bob Costas discussed the impact that Tommy John surgery has had on the game, stating in 2012 that there could be a case for John being awarded the Buck O&#x27;Neil Lifetime Achievement Award. The initial Tommy John surgery, John&#x27;s subsequent return to pitching success, and his relationship with Dr. Jobe was the subject of an ESPN &quot;30 for 30 Shorts&quot; documentary in 2013.

==Pitching style==
John was a soft throwing sinkerball pitcher whose technique resulted in batters hitting numerous ground balls which often induced double plays. In 1980, Dave Anderson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; estimated that his fastball was about 92 miles per hour. &quot;It sinks sharply away from right-handed batters, and it sinks into left-handed batters,&quot; he wrote. Rick Cerone, who caught John with the Yankees, said of the fastball, &quot;It looks like a real good pitch to hit until about the last 10 feet, then it sinks about two or three inches outside. When the batters try to pull it, they just hit these little grounders.&quot; At the start of his major league career, John threw just a fastball and a curveball. The Indians tried to get him to throw a slider in 1964, but John struggled with it and went back to throwing two pitches later that year. By 1980, he was throwing the slider. He also threw three different curveballs by then, classifying them by their release point: &quot;Each one breaks differently, down or flat or in between, depending on how you spin it.&quot; In 1972, he added a screwball, which he used as a changeup to complement his repertoire. His arm lagged behind the rest of his body when he threw pitches, a technique that put extra stress on it, which contributed to his UCL injury in 1974. John tried to emulate Whitey Ford&#x27;s pitching style, and he studied books on pitching by Christy Mathewson, Bob Feller, and Bob Shaw.

==Broadcasting==
Between his stints with the Angels and Athletics in 1985, John served as color commentator alongside Tim McCarver for a game between the White Sox and the Athletics on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Baseball&quot; on June 24. Following his career, John did broadcasting for several different teams. From 1994 through 1996, he served as a broadcaster for the Twins. In 1997, John served as the color commentator for the Charlotte Knights of the International League, also performing a public relations role for the ballclub. John returned to New York in 1998 to do commentary on select games during WPIX&#x27;s final year of broadcasting Yankee baseball. On June 26, 2008, he guest-hosted the &quot;Mike and Mike&quot; ESPN Radio program.

==Coaching==
John started his coaching career at Furman University. During the 2002 season, John joined the Expos&#x27; organization, serving as the pitching coach for the Harrisburg Senators of the Eastern League before managing the Maryville franchise in the Arizona Fall League. In 2003, he was promoted to coach the Triple-A Edmonton Trappers of the Pacific Coast League. Next year, the Yankees got permission from the Expos to interview John, and New York hired him to be the pitching coach for the Staten Island Yankees.

On December 17, 2006, John was named manager of the Bridgeport Bluefish in the Atlantic League. The fifth manager in team history, he compiled a 159176 won-lost record in two-and-a-half seasons with Bridgeport. John resigned on July 8, 2009, to pursue a &quot;non-baseball position&quot; with Sportable Scoreboards; Frank Boulton, the team owner and CEO, publicly thanked John for his contributions. While still managing the Bluefish, he became the spokesman for Tommy John&#x27;s Go-Flex, a joint cream for older athletes manufactured by New Vitality.

==Personal life==
George Vecsey of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described John as &quot;a churchgoer, a good-natured family man.&quot; On July 13, 1970, Tommy married the former Sally Simmons. They are the parents of four children: Tamara, Tommy III, Travis, and Taylor. In 2014, John moved to California with his girlfriend, Cheryl Zeldin, who he was married to as of January 2022.

In 1998, Tamara John married Patrick Mannelly, who went on to become a long snapper for the Chicago Bears. The two met at Duke University. As a 10-year-old in 1992, Taylor&#x27;s singing and acting talents landed him a role in &quot;Les Misérables&quot; on Broadway. He also played Little League Baseball, as did his brothers. On March 9, 2010, Taylor died at the age of 28 as the result of a seizure and heart failure apparently due to an overdose of prescription drugs. &quot;He was the greatest kid in the world, but he would get into these panic spells and deep abysses,&quot; John said of Taylor. &quot;He was wired different than the rest of us.&quot; John has started the &quot;Let&#x27;s Do It&quot; Foundation, dedicated to raising awareness about suicides and preventing them.

John&#x27;s oldest son, Tommy III, played baseball for the Furman University Paladins. He was a 4-year letterman for the Paladins, leading the team in complete games as a pitcher in 1997 (3 games) and in home runs (9) in 1999, a year in which he was named an All-Southern Conference player. In 2000, he became one of three players in the history of Furman&#x27;s varsity baseball team to hit for the cycle, doing so on April 1 against the Appalachian State Mountaineers. After graduating from Furman, he spent two seasons in the independent minor leagues as a pitcher for the Tyler Roughnecks and Schaumburg Flyers. Tommy III is a chiropractor and went on to write a book, &quot;Minimize Injury, Maximize Performance: A Sports Parent&#x27;s Survival Guide&quot;, which discusses the injury risk associated with young athletes specializing in one specific sport and suggests ways to prevent youth from ever having to undergo major sports-related surgery, such as Tommy John surgery.

John&#x27;s hometown of Terre Haute, Indiana, presented him a key to the city on September 1, 1989, and Indiana governor Evan Bayh presented him with the Sagamore of the Wabash, Indiana&#x27;s highest honor. On October 24, 2013, the Terre Haute Parks Department honored John by renaming Spencer Field after him. The complex was the site of John&#x27;s last non-professional game in 1961, when he was a member of the Terre Haute Gerstmeyer High School Black Cats.

John eventually overcame his stuttering problem and earned a reputation as one of baseball&#x27;s most talkative players. &quot;Ask Tommy John what time it is, and he&#x27;ll tell you how to make a watch,&quot; said Lemon. Following his career, he became a motivational speaker. He has no relation to the Tommy John Underwear company and considered suing the founder over the use of his name but abandoned the idea after attorneys wanted $250,000 to represent him. As of 2019, he was no longer watching baseball, considering the game unrecognizable. He was inducted into the Baseball Reliquary&#x27;s Shrine of the Eternals in 2018.

<text>Kamandi () is a fictional comic book character created by artist Jack Kirby and published by DC Comics. The bulk of Kamandi&#x27;s appearances occurred in the comic series &quot;Kamandi: The Last Boy on Earth&quot;, which ran from 1972 to 1978. He is a young hero living in a post-apocalyptic future. Following the Great Disaster, humans have backslid to savagery in a world ruled by intelligent, highly evolved animals.

==Publication history==
===Creation===
DC editor Carmine Infantino had tried to acquire the license to publish &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; comic books. After rival Marvel Comics acquired the rights, Infantino asked Jack Kirby for a series with a similar concept. Kirby had not seen the films, but knew the rough outline and had created a similar story, &quot;The Last Enemy!&quot;, where a present-day man finds himself in a future where anthropomorphic animals have founded their own civilization. Kirby also had an unused comic strip he created in 1956, titled &quot;Kamandi of the Caves&quot;. Kirby brought these elements together to create &quot;Kamandi&quot;. Although his initial plan was not to work on the comic books personally, the cancellation of &quot;Forever People&quot; freed him up to do so.

===The series===
The &quot;Kamandi&quot; series was launched in October–November 1972, and was written and drawn by Jack Kirby. The book went to a monthly publishing schedule quickly, a sign of its early popularity.

Kirby provided art and story through the comic&#x27;s 37th issue, in January 1976. Kirby also drew issues #38 through #40, although they were scripted by Gerry Conway. Kirby subsequently left DC. The series continued, initially with scripts by Conway and art by Chic Stone. Later issues were written by Paul Levitz, Dennis O&#x27;Neil, David Anthony Kraft, Elliot S. Maggin, and Jack C. Harris (alternating), with art by Pablo Marcos, Keith Giffen, and Dick Ayers. It was canceled during the &quot;DC Implosion&quot; of 1978, despite respectable sales figures. The final published issue was #59, cover-dated September–October 1978. Two additional issues, completed but not released, were included in &quot;Cancelled Comic Cavalcade&quot; #2.

===Entering the DC Universe===
During Kirby&#x27;s run on the book, Steve Sherman indicated in the letters column that the series was connected to Kirby&#x27;s then-current &quot;OMAC&quot; series, which was set in the future, but prior to the Great Disaster. The only explicit connection to the DC Universe occurs in issue #29, in which Kamandi discovers a group of apes who worship Superman.

Other stories, not by Kirby, explicitly take place in the DC universe. Kamandi meets Batman in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #120 (July 1975) and #157 (December 1979). &quot;Superman&quot; #295 (January 1976) establishes that the costume seen in issue #29 is Superman&#x27;s and that Earth A.D. is an alternate timeline. Issues #49–50 of the series establish Kamandi&#x27;s grandfather to be Buddy Blank, the former OMAC, and features a brief return of his satellite ally Brother Eye. &quot;Cancelled Comic Cavalcade&quot; #2 guest stars Sandman and establishes that Kamandi is Jed Walker.

The 1975–1977 &quot;Hercules Unbound&quot; series and the OMAC backup stories in &quot;Kamandi&quot; and &quot;The Warlord&quot; tie OMAC to the storyline of &quot;Hercules Unbound&quot; and the Atomic Knights, indicating the Great Disaster to be the atomic war of 1986 that precipitated the events of the latter. &quot;Superman&quot; #295 (Jan. 1976) implies the Great Disaster to be a natural occurrence.

&quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #57 (May 1983) shows that the events of the Atomic Knights stories were a fantasy in the mind of Gardner Grayle, but &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #64 and &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #2 establish that Kamandi still exists in an alternate future of Earth-One.

Following &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Earth-AD is erased from existence.

===Revival===
A young Kamandi and his grandfather Buddy Blank appear in &quot;Countdown to Final Crisis&quot;, which sees the beginning stages of the Great Disaster as a virus causes humans and animals to develop aspects of each other.

Kamandi also appears in &quot;Final Crisis&quot;, where he meets Anthro via a time distortion.

===DC Rebirth===
In January 2017, the miniseries &quot;The Kamandi Challenge&quot; was released to commemorate the 100th anniversary of Jack Kirby&#x27;s birth. Each issues features a new writer and artist.

Writers on the series included Dan Abnett, Peter Tomasi, Jimmy Palmiotti, James Tynion IV, Bill Willingham, Steve Orlando, Marguerite Bennett, Keith Giffen, Tom King, Greg Pak, Rob Williams and Gail Simone while artists were Dale Eaglesham, Neal Adams, Amanda Conner, Carlos D&#x27;Anda, Ivan Reis, Philip Tan, Dan Jurgens, Steve Rude, Kevin Eastman, Joe Prado, Walter Simonson and Ryan Sook.

In &quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;, Kamandi travels back in time and establishes Checkmate under the alias Kingsley Jacobs.

==Fictional character biography==
Kamandi is a teenage boy on a post-apocalyptic Earth dubbed Earth A.D. (After Disaster). The Earth has been ravaged by the mysterious Great Disaster, which devastated human civilization. Isolated pockets survive in underground bunkers, while most humans revert to savagery. By Kamandi&#x27;s time, an unspecified period after the Great Disaster, the effects of radiation and the intelligence-enhancing drug Cortexin cause various animals to become anthropomorphic.

Kamandi is the last survivor of the human outpost in the &quot;Command D&quot; bunker, from which his name is derived. After a wolf kills his grandfather, Kamandi leaves the bunker in search of other human outposts.

He soon discovers that the only other intelligent humans left on Earth are Ben Boxer and his friends Steve and Renzi, a trio of genetically engineered mutants. He also makes a number of animal friends including the dog scientist Dr. Canus, the tiger king Caesar, and his son Tuftan. Later additions to the cast include the alien Pyra, the primitive girl Flower, her twin sister Spirit, detective Mylock Bloodstalker, and his associate Doile.

<doc id="856888" wikidata="Q627420" url="?curid=856888" title="Lichtenfels, Hesse">
<text>Lichtenfels () is a small town in Waldeck-Frankenberg district in northwest Hesse, Germany.

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Lichtenfels lies at the northeast foot of the Rothaargebirge, some southwest of Kassel. It is not far from the western end of the Edersee in the southwest of the &quot;Waldecker Land&quot;. Bordering on the west is the &quot;Medebacher Bucht&quot;, or Medebach Bight, although this is not a bight in the conventional sense, being dry land. Bordering on the south is the Breite Struth (hills).

The municipal area, across which the town&#x27;s outlying centres are broadly scattered, is crossed by the rivers Orke and Aar. In the northeast, it borders on the Itter Valley, in the east on the Eder Valley, beyond which rises the Kellerwald range, and in the south on the Nuhne Valley.

=== Extent of municipal area ===
With its area of nearly 100 km², almost 40% of which is wooded, Lichtenfels is among the largest and most wooded municipalities in the district.

=== Neighbouring communities ===
Lichtenfels borders in the north on the town of Korbach, in the east on the community of Vöhl, in the south on the town of Frankenberg (all in Waldeck-Frankenberg), and in the west on the towns of Hallenberg and Medebach (both in the Hochsauerlandkreis in North Rhine-Westphalia).

== Constituent communities ==
The town of Lichtenfels was made up from six communities and two towns: Dalwigksthal, Fürstenberg, Goddelsheim, Immighausen, Münden, Neukirchen, Rhadern and Sachsenberg.

== History ==
In 1971, as part of municipal reforms, the eight formerly independent municipalities joined together to form a new, greater municipality, choosing the name Lichtenfels after the castle, the oldest noble seat in Waldeck.

=== Dalwigksthal ===

For a long time after the Castle Lichtenfels was built high above the Orke about 800 years ago, almost nobody gave Dalwigksthal any thought. Lichtenfels&#x27;s newest constituent community celebrated 150 years of existence in 2001. As a result of the Waldeck Law of 24 January 1851, the estates of Kampf, Sand and Lichtenfels as well as the settlements and mills found there were merged into the village of Dalwigksthal.

However, there is tell of a valley community in this place in the Middle Ages named Eisenbeck from the 14th century to the late 18th century. In 1598, this is recorded as Ensenbecke. The Castle Lichtenfels was built in 1189 by the Abbot of Corvey. Shortly thereafter, it was destroyed, but built anew between 1223 and 1230. On 21 July 1267, Corvey pledged to Count Adolf of Waldeck, among other things, Schloss Lichtenfels (the castle). After fierce feuds, Corvey had to pass entitlement to the castle&#x27;s ownership to Count Otto of Waldeck for good in 1297.

The Archbishop of Cologne, as Duke of Westphalia, raised claim to the places Münden, Neukirchen and Rhadern in the &quot;Amt&quot; of Lichtenfels, which in the 16th and 17th centuries led to protracted trials and battles. In the course of these disagreements, the castle is assumed to have once again been destroyed early in the 17th century. A partial reconstruction was done in 1631, with a broader plan carried out between 1908 and 1914. In the late 1980s, an entrepreneurial family bought the castle, which by then was once again falling into disrepair and gave it a comprehensive makeover. Dalwigksthal&#x27;s church, which for ages had belonged to the parish of Münden, is now part of the parish of Sachsenberg. Once, the chapel was a burying ground for the von Dalwigk family. Not much remains of the mediaeval chapel; only the Gothic quire is still preserved, likely built early in the 14th century. The current nave was newly built in 1620.

Lichtenfels&#x27;s smallest constituent community has roughly 200 inhabitants.

=== Goddelsheim ===
Goddelsheim with its roughly 1,450 inhabitants is the biggest of Lichtenfels&#x27;s constituent communities. The village lies 70 km southwest of Kassel. It is about 25 km east to the Edersee (dam) by road. The district seat of Korbach is roughly 10 km away. In 1988, Goddelsheim celebrated the village&#x27;s 1100th anniversary of documentary mention. From one of King Arnulf&#x27;s documents from 888 comes the first mention of Goddelsheim, but presumably, its history goes much further back. Witness to this is the discovery of some forgotten graves in the area that date back much earlier than the 9th century.

Things have not always been as peaceful in Goddelsheim as they are today. For instance, in 1548 and 1627, the Electors of Cologne tried to introduce the Catholic faith into the Evangelical village by force. Thanks to the resistance of the Schaaken Monastery, which held the patronage rights to Goddelsheim, the Electors&#x27; plans fell through.

Of the formerly three noble estates in the village, the last was divided up in 1904. Nevertheless, agriculture still plays a rôle. Furthermore, there are shops, handicraft businesses, a bank and a savings bank. Many people who live in Goddelsheim do not actually work there, but commute to jobs in Korbach or Frankenberg. Eleven clubs offer a variety of leisure activities. Goddelsheim is not only the biggest constituent community but also the seat of the town&#x27;s administration. It has a church kindergarten, a primary school and Lichtenfels&#x27;s central school (&quot;Mittelpunktschule&quot;).

=== Immighausen ===
The place that is now Lichtenfels&#x27;s constituent community of Immighausen first came to history&#x27;s attention about 850 when Countess Ida transferred her goods near &quot;Ymminchusen&quot; to Corvey Abbey. There are documents beginning in 1028. Over the ages the place has had many names, with its original name being recorded as Yraminchusen, followed by a succession of other forms: Ymmichusen (about 1190), Immyngchusen (about 1200), Ymenchusen (1336), Imminchusen (about 1350), Immickhusen (1422), Imminckhausen (1537) and Immeckusen (1541). History records that in 1028 a farm at Imminghusen was transferred by the Abbot of Corvey, at Emperor Conrad&#x27;s behest, to the dowager Alvered&#x27;s son. In 1189 the place was a Corvey fief under the Counts of Waldeck. The church at Immighausen was first mentioned in 1223 as being a chapel among the Schaaken Monastery&#x27;s estates. The church has a square tower and a single nave. Immighausen is shaped by agriculture, but there is industry. The oldest club is the 110-year-old men&#x27;s singing club &quot;Liedertafel&quot;. Furthermore, there are the women&#x27;s choir, the &quot;Landfrauen&quot;, the sport club with its subgroup the &quot;Klostermönche&quot; (&quot;Monastery Monks&quot;) and the fire brigade. The Lichtenfels regional group of the Waldeck History Club (&quot;Waldeckischer Geschichtsverein&quot;) also has its seat in Immighausen. In the village live 402 people.

=== Rhadern ===
With roughly 370 inhabitants, Rhadern is the smallest of Lichtenfels&#x27;s constituent communities. Its first documentary mention came in 1473, though already about 830, history mentions something about a place called Ryadra. Over the ages, Rhadern has had a number of different names. About 1020 the village was called Radirinhusen, about 1125, Rotheren. In 1336 when Count Heinrich of Waldeck pledged, among other things, this village to Count Johann of Nassau as a dowry for his daughter, it was called Rodern. Later names for it were Raderen (about 1350), Radehausen (1420) and Rädern (1738). In 1473, when Rhadern had its first documentary mention, the village was deserted. It was at this time that the von Dalwigk family were granted the forsaken hamlet along with the rest of the &quot;Amt&quot; of Lichtenfels as a fief. As of this time, Rhadern belonged to the &quot;Amt&quot; and the von Dalwigk &quot;Freistuhl&quot; of Lichtenfels. The chapel lying on the way out of the village towards Fürstenberg was separated from its mother church in 1260 and raised to a parish in its own right. Owing to the church&#x27;s destruction, the community was parochially united with Fürstenberg in the 15th century. Rhadern parishioners even had their own entrance to the church there, and their own pews. About 1700, the community was parochially united with Münden. Once the chapel had been built anew in 1755, Rhadern once again had its own church, which was expanded in the 1970s. The centre of the small chapel is a winged altar. The villagers are kept busy as members of various clubs, there being, besides the fire brigade and the Lichtenfels sporting community a music club with various subgroups, the &quot;Discoteam&quot; and the &quot;Landfrauen&quot; (&quot;Country Women&quot;) with a dance group.

=== Neukirchen ===
Up the Nuhne at the boundary with Rengershausen was a village or farm called &quot;Aweshausen&quot; or &quot;Auweshausen&quot;. The field names in the area, &quot;Auf der Aue&quot; and &quot;Auf der Junkernaue&quot; recall the former centre. In 1336, Count Heinrich IV of Waldeck pledged, among other things, the village of &quot;Nuwenkyrchen&quot; to Count Johann of Nassau as a dowry for his daughter (see also Rhadern above), which also gave Neukirchen its first documentary mention. Already by 1301, though, history records a Ditmar von Nuwenkyrchen, Juryman at Sachsenberg, proof that there had already been a settlement there for some time before the Count&#x27;s daughter&#x27;s wedding. In the disputes between the Electors of Cologne and Waldeck, which had begun in 1533, the Elector of Cologne claimed, among other properties, Neukirchen. By 1663, however, Cologne had forgone its claim to the village, thus also bringing an end to the Electors&#x27; attempts to reintroduce the Catholic faith into the community. Neukirchen was a branch of the parish of Münden and in the 18th century temporarily a parish in its own right. Today it belongs to the parish of Sachsenberg. The church with its rectangular nave was newly built in 1864 by the master mason Gülich from Sachsenberg where an older forerunner church had once stood which had to be torn down. How the church looked before the new building was put up is not known with any certainty, as there are no reliable indications. The first new church, which was the village&#x27;s namesake (Neukirchen ≈ new church), must have been built sometime before 1336 – the time of Neukirchen&#x27;s first documentary mention – but a more precise indication of its building date is not possible.

The first part of what is today Neukirchen arose as a scattered village – one with an irregular layout – and nowadays forms the upper village. It was purely a farming community, and by all indications arose from a lordly estate. By and by arose also the lower village as a thorpe, or linear village. It harboured day labourers, workers and craftsmen. The schoolhouse was built in 1785. After the Second World War, a bigger school was built, which was closed in 1976. In this village, shaped by agriculture, live 488 people. Many of them are active in the five clubs.

=== Münden ===
In 1028, Emperor Konrad acknowledged that the Abbot of Corvey Abbey had given the dowager Alvered the estate at &quot;Gimundia&quot; for her lifelong use, thereby giving Münden its first documentary mention. Late in the 13th century, Corvey Abbey pledged the &quot;Amt&quot; of Münden to Count Otto of Waldeck. In a disagreement between Corvey and the Counts of Waldeck, Münden was awarded to the Counts in 1321 through arbitration. Münden, too, was included in Count Heinrich IV&#x27;s pledge to Count Johann of Nassau as part of the former&#x27;s daughter Elisabeth&#x27;s dowry (see also Rhadern and Neukirchen above). As of 1473, Münden, which until then had been seat of a Corvey and later Waldeck &quot;Amt&quot;, belonged to the von Dalwigk &quot;Amt&quot; of Lichtenfels. In the disputes between the Electors of Cologne and Waldeck, Cologne also claimed Münden. However, as with Neukirchen, the Electors forwent their claim in 1663.

Today, Münden, lying between Dalwigksthal and Medebach in Westphalia, belongs to Lichtenfels as a constituent community. Earlier names for the village besides &quot;Gimundia&quot; were &quot;Gemundi&quot; (1120), &quot;Gimunden&quot; (1125), &quot;Munden&quot; (1298), &quot;Gemonden&quot; (1321), &quot;Gemunden&quot; (1336, 1473) and &quot;Dreckmünden&quot; (1679). The village lies about 1 500 m from North Rhine-Westphalia and is home to about 420 people.

=== Fürstenberg ===
Fürstenberg, once Waldeck&#x27;s and Hesse&#x27;s smallest town, was first mentioned as a town in 1254. Remains of the old town wall can still be seen in the historic town core. This little town in the &quot;Waldecker Land&quot; is wrapped in many stories and sagas. One of them is the Hedgehog Saga (&quot;Igelsage&quot;) which has also given the town the name &quot;Igelstadt&quot;. It says that a hedgehog kept Count Heinrich of Waldeck from coming a cropper when his horse shied before it. To this day, the &quot;Igelfest&quot; (Hedgehog Festival) is still celebrated in Fürstenberg on the Monday before Whitsun.

<text>Christoph Schneider (born 11 May 1966) is a German musician, best known as one of the founding members and the drummer of Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein. He has released eight studio albums and three live albums with Rammstein. Schneider was previously a member of punk bands Die Firma and Feeling B.

==Early life==
Schneider was born in Pankow, East Berlin. His parents were both involved in music, his father as an opera director and his mother as a music teacher. Schneider also has a younger sister. During his youth, he was a handball goalkeeper for four years. He later attended a special music school connected to a Pioneers&#x27; orchestra, as his parents wanted him to learn an instrument. He was offered the choice between trumpet, clarinet, and trombone, out of which he chose the trumpet first as it was the easiest to play. Schneider described himself as a very talented trumpeter, having joined the orchestra and started playing concerts after a year. During his time in the orchestra, he became interested in playing the drums due to the size and equipment of the drum section and began building his own kit with tin cans and buckets. His parents were initially hesitant to the idea of him playing the drums, but after he bought his first drumkit at age 14, his parents let him rehearse and take lessons.

Schneider left extended secondary school at age 16 and went on to work as a radio and telecommunications technician. In 1984, he served his national service with the East German Army. He is the only member of Rammstein to have served in the military.

==Career==
In 1985, Schneider quit his telecommunication job to pursue his musical ambitions and study music, but failed his admission test and was rejected due to lacking other musical skills than drumming. Schneider then joined bands Keine Ahnung and Frechheit. In the late 1980s, he joined Die Firma, an underground new wave punk band with gothic influences, and became a member of punk band Feeling B in 1990.

In 1993, Schneider joined Richard Kruspe and Oliver Riedel in forming a new project called Tempelprayers. After Till Lindemann joined the band, they entered the Berlin Senate Metrobeat contest and won a recording session in a professional studio in 1994. That same year, Schneider&#x27;s former Feeling B bandmates Paul Landers and Christian Lorenz joined the band, which was then renamed to Rammstein. 

== Personal life ==

Schneider&#x27;s nickname &quot;Doom&quot; comes from the video game of the same name. Schneider needed a name for the German copyright agency, but discovered that there were too many Christoph Schneiders already registered. Paul Landers suggested the name &quot;Doom&quot; because they liked the game. In a 2010 interview, Schneider said that if he had known that the name would appear on every record he played on, he would have chosen a different one.

Schneider has been married twice. He was married to Regina Gizatulina from 2005 to 2009. He married his second wife, Ulrike Schmid, in 2014. Schneider and Schmid have three children.

His favorite rock bands are Deep Purple, Led Zeppelin, Motörhead, Black Sabbath, and AC/DC. He cites Ian Paice, Phil Rudd, Vinnie Paul, and Chad Smith as his main drumming influences.

Schneider is a supporter of Bundesliga football club Union Berlin.

==Equipment==

Schneider uses and endorses Sabian cymbals, DW drum kits, pedals and hardware Vic Firth drumsticks and Remo Drumheads. He previously used and endorsed Sonor Drums, Tama Drums and Meinl cymbals.

<text>According to the Torah, Merari (Hebrew: , &quot;Mərārī&quot;) was one of the sons of Levi, and the patriarchal founder of the Merarites, one of the four main divisions among the Levites in Biblical times. The Hebrew word &quot;Merari&quot; means &quot;sad&quot;, &quot;bitter&quot; or &quot;strong&quot; (in the sense that a dish with a bitter taste might be said to have a &quot;strong&quot; taste). The Merarites were charged with the transportation and care of the structural components of the tabernacle.

Richard Elliott Friedman attributes the genealogy to the Book of Generations, a document originating from a similar group and date to the priestly source. According to some biblical scholars, the Torah&#x27;s genealogy for Levi&#x27;s descendants is actually an aetiological myth reflecting the fact that there were four different groups among the levites - the Gershonites, Kohathites, Merarites, and Aaronids; according to the Jewish Encyclopedia, &quot;Levite&quot; was originally just a job title, deriving from the Minaean word &quot;lawi&#x27;u&quot; meaning &quot;priest&quot;, rather than having been the name of a tribe.

<text>Boris Andreyevich Vilkitsky () (22 March (3 April N.S.) 1885, Pulkovo – 6 March 1961) was a Russian hydrographer and surveyor. He was the son of Andrey Ippolitovich Vilkitsky.

==Career==

Born in Pulkovo, Tsarskoselsky Uyezd (now part of Saint Petersburg), Vilkitsky graduated from the Naval Academy in Saint Petersburg in 1908. He participated in the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905. In 1913—1915 he led the Arctic hydrographic expedition on the ships &quot;Taimyr&quot; and &quot;Vaigach&quot; with the purpose of further exploration of the Northern Sea Route.

In 1913, Vilkitsky&#x27;s expedition discovered Emperor Nicholas II Land (, &quot;Zemlya Imperatora Nikolaya II&quot;) —later renamed &#x27;Severnaya Zemlya&#x27;, perhaps one of the most important Russian discoveries in the Arctic at the time. Other discoveries were an island that now bears his name (Vilkitsky Island), as well as the islands of Maly Taymyr and neighboring Starokadomsky. In 1914–1915, Vilkitsky&#x27;s expedition made the first through voyage from Vladivostok to Arkhangelsk, discovered Novopashenniy Island (now Zhokhov Island), and described the eastern coastline of the territory he named &#x27;Emperor Nicholas II Land&#x27;. He was awarded the prestigious Constantine Medal by the Russian Geographical Society for his endeavours. 

In 1918, Vilkitsky was appointed head of the first Soviet hydrographic expedition, which never took place due to its seizure by the North Russia intervention in Arkhangelsk. In 1920, Vilkitsky emigrated to Britain. In 1923 and 1924, Vilkitsky led commercial expeditions in the Kara Sea at the invitation of the Soviet foreign trade organizations.

Later in his life, Vilkitsky was employed as a hydrographer in the Belgian Congo.
Boris Vilkitsky died in Brussels in 1961.
==Memory==

Many geographical features in Russia bear Vilkitsky&#x27;s name:
* The most well-known one is Vilkitsky Strait, the strait between Severnaya Zemlya and Taimyr Peninsula, an important landmark of the Northern Sea Route.
* Zaliv Vil&#x27;kitskogo, a bay in the NW shores of Novaya Zemlya.
* Vilkitsky Island in the Kara Sea.
* The Vilkitsky Islands, a division of the Nordenskjold Archipelago.
* The Vilkitsky Islands subgroup of the Komsomolskaya Pravda Islands in the Laptev Sea off the eastern shores of the Taymyr Peninsula.
* Vilkitsky Island in the De Long Group in the Eastern Siberian Sea.

<doc id="856899" wikidata="Q320939" url="?curid=856899" title="Mělník">
<text>Mělník (; ) is a town in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 20,000 inhabitants. The historic town centre is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument zone.

Mělník lies in one of the most important agricultural areas of the country. The town is known for its production of wine.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from the Slavic word &quot;mělnit&quot;, here meaning &#x27;to crumble&#x27;. Originally, &quot;Mělník&quot; was the name of a hill formed by crumbling Cretaceous rocks.

==Geography==

Mělník is located about north of Prague. It is situated on the right bank of the Elbe, at the confluence of the Elbe and Vltava rivers.

The town lies in the Polabí lowlands. The southwestern part of the municipal territory lies in the Central Elbe Table, the northeastern part lies in the Jizera Table. The highest point is the hill Chloumeček at above sea level.

==History==
In the 5th and 6th century, many Slavic tribes lived here and the tribe of Pšovans created its main settlement in Mělník. Saint Ludmila (the grandmother of Saint Wenceslaus), who married the Bohemian prince Bořivoj I, belonged to this tribe. Coins of the princess Emma, who died in 1005 or 1006, are the first demonstration of the existence of Mělník. In November 1274, Mělník gained the status of town from King Ottokar II and later became a dowry town belonging to queens of Bohemia.

In 1449, the town gained the right to decide on its own affairs, through councilors headed by the mayor. The town gained fame in the first half of the 16th century thanks to viticulture, the origins of which date back to the end of the 9th century, but the preconditions for its real development were created only by Charles IV, who brought vines from Burgundy to Mělník.

The town suffered from the events of the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Mělník became moderately involved in the Bohemian Revolt (1618–1620), and was punished by confiscation of property and gradual re-Catholicization. In 1628, its population was predominantly Catholic. Mělník had to deal with enemy military incursions, especially the Saxons and the Swedes; it was also affected by devastating fires (1646, 1652, 1681) and by plague. The church, castle and town hall were damaged.

The wars in the 18th century brought considerable damage to the town, but it was most affected by the fire in 1765, which destroyed 42 houses including the town hall and Capuchin monastery. It was followed by another stage of the Baroque transformation of the town.

In 1850, Mělník became a district town. In 1869, a sugar factory was established, for a long time the only industrial company in the town. In 1874 a railway line was brought to Mělník, which helped its economic development. In 1888 a bridge over the Elbe was built, and at the end of the 19th century a transhipment depot was built, the basis of the later port.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
The largest industrial employers based in the town are Erwin Junker Grinding Technology (manufacturer of grinding tools) and Vibracoustic CZ (manufacturer of rubber products), both employing more than 500 people. The largest non-industrial employer is the hospital.

===Viticulture===
Mělník gives its name to the Mělnická wine region, one of the most northerly in Europe. Every year, at the end of September, a wine festival is held in Mělník on the Feast of St. Wenceslaus.

According to legend, the Great Moravian Prince Svatopluk I sent the Bohemian Prince Bořivoj I a barrel of wine to celebrate the birth of his son Spytihněv I. It is said that Ludmila subsequently had vines brought from Moravia and planted not far from her birthplace, the fortified settlement of Pšov, today&#x27;s Mělník. Ludmila&#x27;s grandson St. Wenceslaus personally took care of the vineyards, and became the patron saint of winemakers.

==Transport==

Mělník is situated on the crossroads of two first-class roads: the I/9 (which connects the D8 motorway with Česká Lípa and the Czech-German border) and the I/16 (the section from the D8 motorway to Mladá Boleslav).

Mělník is located on the railway lines Ústí nad Labem–Kolín and Prague–Mělník.

Mělník is one of the largest river ports in the Czech Republic and a place of container transshipment.

==Sights==
Míru Square is the historic centre of Mělník. It is lined with valuable Renaissance and Neo-Renaissance houses. The landmark of the square is the town hall with Renaissance archways, Gothic bay window of the Chapel of St. Barbara, and Baroque tower. The Church of the Fourteen Holy Helpers with the building of former Capuchin monastery are also located on the square.

Mělník Castle is one of the most important sights of the town. The castle is built in the Renaissance style. Below the castle there are large wine cellars. Confiscated by the communists, it has been restored to its traditional owners, the House of Lobkowicz.

Church of Saints Peter and Paul was rebuilt three times. Construction began at the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries, but the oldest preserved part is from the 1480s. The opulent presbytary is from around 1520. Other major reconstructions were made and the fires in 1555 and 1681, when renaissance gables and the baroque dome of a gothic tower were damaged. The current appearance of the church is the result of extensive repairs in 1910 and 1913–1915. The church is still used primarily for religious functions, but it is open for the public. Starting in 2007, the public will be allowed access to the reconstructed church tower. There is a large and elaborate ossuary inside the church. Anthropologist Jindřich Matiegka conducted research here between 1915 and 1919, during which he arranged the remains of 10–15,000 people.
Behind the church there is a building of the old school, formerly the seat of the Mělník&#x27;s chapter. It used to be a part of the town&#x27;s fortifications. Remains of the fortifications are still preserved, including a 20m high water tower from the 16th century. The most preserved part is the Prague Gate from the 1530s. Near the castle there is Villa Carola, where the town library is located, which is a part of the Culture Centre of Mělník.

<text>Christian &quot;Flake&quot; Lorenz (; born 16 November 1966) is a German musician. He is best known as the keyboardist in Neue Deutsche Härte band Rammstein, as well as the main composer of the band along with guitarist Richard Kruspe. He was also a member of the East German punk band Feeling B. Lorenz has released a solo album named Flake feiert Weihnachten, which consists of covers of popular Christmas songs.

==Career==

===Feeling B===

In 1983, at age 16, Lorenz began to play in the band Feeling B with Paul Landers and Aljoscha Rompe, a Swiss singer living in East Berlin. He stayed with the band for about ten years. Feeling B started out firmly grounded in the underground punk scene.

Lorenz lived in an apartment with Landers during their early years. When they were not playing gigs, they would sell jackets made from cut-up bed sheets and dusters on the black market. Two jackets a month meant as much money as an average salaried worker. &quot;It was quite easy to make a living; not to work and stay out of trouble,&quot; said Landers, &quot;You only got problems if you were caught.&quot;

The group disbanded in the mid-1990s. On special occasions, the band members would get together for concerts at punk festivals, until Rompe died in November 2000 of an asthma attack.

===Rammstein===

In 1994, Till Lindemann, Richard Kruspe, Oliver Riedel and Christoph Schneider entered and won the Berlin Senate Metro beat contest that allowed them to professionally record a four track demo. Paul Landers formally joined the band, followed by Lorenz. He was initially reluctant to join his five bandmates and had to be pestered into becoming a member of Rammstein, as he thought they would be too boring. Eventually, he agreed to join, and the group began work on their first album, &quot;Herzeleid&quot; (&quot;Heartache&quot;).

In early live performances of the song &quot;Bück dich&quot; (&quot;Bend down&quot; or &quot;Bend over&quot;), Lorenz and vocalist Till Lindemann engaged in simulated sodomy with a liquor-squirting dildo. On 23 September 1998, in Worcester, Massachusetts (USA) Lindemann and Lorenz were arrested and charged with lewd and lascivious behavior. A statement from Sergeant Thomas Radula of the Worcester Police Department stated that Lindemann was simulating sex with Lorenz onstage &quot;using a phallic object that shot water over the crowd&quot;. They were held and released the following day on US$25 bail. After months of legal debate, they were fined US$100.

Until 2002, Lorenz would &quot;surf&quot; the audience in an inflatable rubber dinghy during the performance of &quot;Seemann&quot; (&quot;Seaman&quot;). Riedel took his place in 2002. According to Lorenz, the change occurred because he was injured too often. During a 2001 concert in St. Petersburg, Lorenz was tipped out of the boat by the crowd and almost completely undressed. Despite this, Lorenz returned to riding the dinghy for Rammstein&#x27;s 2009 tour during the performance of &quot;Haifisch&quot; (&quot;Shark&quot;). 

During a concert in Gothenburg, Sweden on 30 July 2005, Till Lindemann suffered a knee injury when Lorenz accidentally ran into him with the Segway he rides during the performance of &quot;Amerika&quot; (&quot;America&quot;). This caused concerts scheduled in Asia to be cancelled.

In 2005, Lorenz suffered from mumps, causing concerts in South America to be cancelled.

In January 2012, Lorenz, along with Lindemann, was interviewed by heavy metal anthropologist Sam Dunn for the VH1 Classic series &quot;Metal Evolution&quot;, on the topic of shock rock.

==Personal life==
Lorenz has been divorced once and has five children. On 12 September 2008, Lorenz married artist Jenny Rosemeyer, who provided the whistling for Rammstein&#x27;s song &quot;Roter Sand&quot;. He has a brother who is four years older. Lorenz is an amateur painter and likes classic cars. He has a Mercedes and is involved in the vintage car hire business. In November 2011 Lorenz&#x27;s house was set on fire. The police managed to identify and capture the arsonist, a 28-year-old male with a criminal record who crashed his car nearby while fleeing from the scene.

===Nicknames===
Lorenz commonly goes by the nicknames &quot;Flake&quot; (pronounced as &quot;Flak-eh&quot; in German, derived from the Viking village in which the Vicke Viking series of children&#x27;s books take place) and &quot;Doktor&quot;. &quot;Doktor&quot; came about because at one point he wanted to be a surgeon, but he was unable to study to become one because of his refusal to join the East German military. In a 16 December 2000 interview, he stated that &quot;Flake&quot; is his proper name.

===Religion and politics===
Lorenz has stated &quot;I disapprove of religions which are made into rigid institutions. I also think that religious fanaticism and missionary work are dangerous.&quot;

Lorenz has criticized the United States which, in a 2001 interview, he called a &quot;sick and decadent country with no culture&quot;. However, in the same interview, he stated: &quot;I prefer playing in the USA [over Germany] because the attitude to music is more relaxed [in America],&quot; and also opined that he favored the American city of Seattle when touring. 

On 5 October 2005, Lorenz appeared briefly on Deutsche Welle. When asked how he felt about the reunification of Germany, he said he misses the way things were then. &quot;Even if the GDR survived, I still would&#x27;ve stayed a musician. The increased size of the world also brought the danger of being compared to all of the international acts. The bands which were in the east were the only ones there, and if you were successful there, you were successful. I miss the simplicity. You went into a bar, ordered a beer, and you got a beer!... They didn&#x27;t ask if you wanted... with a head or without a head, foam top or bottom... It really gets on my nerves having all of these choices I really don&#x27;t want&quot;. In 2014, in an essay titled &quot;I&#x27;m missing the GDR&quot; Flake Lorenz stated &quot;I miss the GDR even today. More so than the bands from that time.&quot; 

In a 2014 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Lindemann stated that &quot;Flake is still a citizen of the GDR, and he will die a citizen of the GDR&quot;. In a 2019 interview with &quot;Metal Hammer&quot;, he recalled life in East Germany as &quot;free of trouble and pressure, we all had enough money to live&quot;.
