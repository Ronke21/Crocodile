<text>Ayaan Hirsi Ali (; born 13 November 1969) is a Somalian-born Dutch-American writer, activist, conservative thinker and former politician. She is a critic of Islam and advocate for the rights and self-determination of Muslim women, opposing forced marriage, honour killing, child marriage, and female genital mutilation. At the age of five, following local traditions in Somalia, Ali underwent female genital mutilation organized by her grandmother. Her father Hirsi Ali Magan—a scholar, intellectual, and a devout Muslim—was against the procedure but could not stop it from happening because he was imprisoned by the Communist government of Somalia at the time. Her family moved across various countries in Africa and the Middle East, and at 23, she received political asylum in the Netherlands, gaining Dutch citizenship five years later. In her early 30s, Hirsi Ali renounced the Islamic faith of her childhood, began identifying as an atheist, and became involved in Dutch centre-right politics, joining the People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD). In 2023 she announced that she had become a Christian.

In 2003, Ali was elected to the lower house of the States General of the Netherlands. While serving in parliament, she collaborated on a short film with Theo van Gogh, titled &quot;Submission&quot;, which depicted the oppression of women under fundamentalist Islamic law and was critical of the Muslim canon itself. The film led to death threats, and Van Gogh was murdered shortly after the film&#x27;s release by Mohammed Bouyeri, a Moroccan-Dutch Islamic terrorist, driving Hirsi Ali into hiding. At this time, she became more outspoken as a critic of Islam. In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Ali as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. Her outspoken criticism of Islam made her a controversial figure in Dutch politics. Following a political crisis related to the validity of her Dutch citizenship, she left Parliament and ultimately the Netherlands.

Moving to the United States, Ali established herself as a writer, activist, and public intellectual. Her books &quot;&quot; (2007),
&quot;&quot; (2010) and &quot;&quot; (2015) became bestsellers. In &quot;Heretic&quot;, Ali called for reformation of Islam by countering Islamism and supporting reformist Muslims, though previously she had said Islam was beyond reform.
In the United States, Ali has founded an organisation for the defense of women&#x27;s rights, the AHA Foundation. She has taken roles at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, the American Enterprise Institute, and at Harvard Kennedy School as a senior fellow at the Future of Democracy Project. Since 2021, she has served as a columnist for &quot;UnHerd&quot;, a British online magazine; since 2022, she has also hosted &quot;The Ayaan Hirsi Ali Podcast&quot;.

Ali was a central figure in New Atheism since its beginnings. She was strongly associated with the movement, along with Christopher Hitchens, who regarded Ali as &quot;the most important public intellectual probably ever to come out of Africa&quot;. Writing in a column in November 2023, Ali announced her conversion to Christianity, claiming that in her view the Judeo-Christian tradition is the only answer to the problems of the modern world. She has received several awards, including a free speech award from the centre-right Danish newspaper &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot;, the Swedish conservative Liberal Party&#x27;s Democracy Prize, and the Moral Courage Award for commitment to conflict resolution, ethics, and world citizenship. Critics have accused Ali of being Islamophobic or neo-orientalist and question her scholarly credentials &quot;to speak authoritatively about Islam and the Arab world&quot;, saying she promotes the notion of a Western &quot;civilizing mission&quot;. Ali is married to Scottish-American historian Niall Ferguson. The couple are raising their sons in the United States, where she became a citizen in 2013.

== Early life ==
Ayaan was born in Mogadishu, Somalia, in 1969. Her father, Hirsi Magan Isse, was a prominent member of the Somali Salvation Democratic Front and a leading figure in the Somali Revolution. Shortly after she was born, her father was imprisoned due to his opposition to Siad Barre’s Communist government. Hirsi Ali&#x27;s father was an intellectual, a dissident and a devout Muslim who had studied abroad and he was opposed to female genital mutilation; while he was imprisoned, Hirsi Ali&#x27;s grandmother had a man perform the procedure on her, when Hirsi Ali was five years old. According to Hirsi Ali, she was fortunate that her grandmother could not find a woman to do the procedure, as the mutilation was &quot;much milder&quot; when performed by men.

After her father escaped from prison, he and the family left Somalia in 1977, going to Saudi Arabia and then to Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, before settling in Nairobi, Kenya, by 1980. There he established a comfortable upper-class life for them. Hirsi Ali attended the English-language Muslim Girls&#x27; Secondary School. By the time she reached her teens, Saudi Arabia was funding religious education in numerous countries and its religious views were becoming influential among many Muslims. A charismatic religious teacher, trained under this aegis, joined Hirsi Ali&#x27;s school. She inspired the teenaged Ayaan, as well as some fellow students, to adopt the more rigorous Saudi Arabian interpretations of Islam, as opposed to the more relaxed versions then current in Somalia and Kenya. Hirsi Ali said later that she had long been impressed by the Qur&#x27;an and had lived &quot;by the Book, for the Book&quot; throughout her childhood.

She sympathised with the views of the Islamist Muslim Brotherhood, and wore a &quot;hijab&quot; with her school uniform. This was unusual at the time but has become more common among some young Muslim women. At the time, she agreed with the &quot;fatwa&quot; proclaimed against British Indian writer Salman Rushdie in reaction to the portrayal of the Islamic prophet Muhammad in his novel &quot;The Satanic Verses&quot;. After completing secondary school, Hirsi Ali attended a secretarial course at Valley Secretarial College in Nairobi for one year. As she was growing up, she also read English-language adventure stories, such as the &quot;Nancy Drew&quot; series and Enid Blyton novels, with modern heroine archetypes who pushed the limits of society. &quot;&quot;Secret Seven&quot;, &quot;Famous Five&quot; and some of the other Enid Blytons - what they do is, they encourage you as an individual to imagine that you&#x27;re a part of the Secret Seven. You&#x27;re solving mysteries, you&#x27;re a part of the Famous Five. So that&#x27;s very different from the world I grew up in, where you are told, &#x27;Stay inside the house. Do not mingle with boys,&quot; she recalled.&quot; Also, remembering her grandmother refusing soldiers entry into her house, Hirsi Ali associated with Somalia &quot;the picture of strong women: the one who smuggles in the food, and the one who stands there with a knife against the army and says, &#x27;You cannot come into the house.&#x27; And I became like that. And my parents and my grandmother don&#x27;t appreciate that now—because of what I&#x27;ve said about the Qur&#x27;an. I have become them, just in a different way.&quot;

== Life in the Netherlands ==
=== Arrival and education ===

Hirsi Ali arrived in the Netherlands in 1992. That year she had travelled from Kenya to visit her family in Düsseldorf and Bonn, Germany, and gone to the Netherlands to escape an alleged forced marriage. Once there, she requested political asylum and obtained a residence permit. She used her paternal grandfather&#x27;s early surname on her application and has since been known in the West as Ayaan Hirsi Ali. She received a residence permit within three or four weeks of arriving in the Netherlands.

At first, she held various short-term jobs, ranging from cleaning to sorting post. She worked as a translator at a Rotterdam refugee center which, according to a friend interviewed in 2006 by &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper, marked her deeply.

As an avid reader, in the Netherlands she found new books and ways of thought that both stretched her imagination and frightened her. Sigmund Freud&#x27;s work introduced her to an alternative moral system that was not based on religion. During this time she took courses in Dutch and a one-year introductory course in social work at the Hogeschool De Horst in Driebergen. She has said that she was impressed with how well Dutch society seemed to function. To better understand its development, she studied at the Leiden University, where she obtained an Master&#x27;s degree in political science.

Between 1995 and 2001, Hirsi Ali also worked as an independent Somali-Dutch interpreter and translator, frequently working with Somali women in asylum centers, hostels for abused women, and at the Dutch immigration and naturalization service (IND, &quot;Immigratie- en Naturalisatiedienst&quot;). While working for the IND, she became critical of the way it handled asylum seekers. Hirsi Ali speaks six languages: English, Somali, Arabic, Swahili, Amharic, and Dutch.

=== Political career ===

After gaining her degree, Hirsi Ali became a Fellow at the Wiardi Beckman Stichting (WBS), a think tank of the center-left Labour Party (PvdA). Leiden University Professor Ruud Koole was steward of the party. Hirsi Ali&#x27;s writing at the WBS was inspired by the work of the neoconservative Orientalist Bernard Lewis.

She became disenchanted with Islam and was shocked by the September 11 attacks in the United States in 2001, for which al-Qaeda eventually claimed responsibility. After listening to videotapes of Osama bin Laden citing &quot;words of justification&quot; in the Qur&#x27;an for the attacks, she wrote, &quot;I picked up the Qur&#x27;an and the hadith and started looking through them, to check. I hated to do it, because I knew that I would find Bin Laden&#x27;s quotations in there.&quot; During this time of transition, she came to regard the Qur&#x27;an as relative—it was a historical record and &quot;just another book.&quot;

Reading &quot;Atheïstisch manifest&quot; (&quot;Atheist Manifesto&quot;) of Leiden University philosopher Herman Philipse helped to convince her to give up religion. She renounced Islam and acknowledged her disbelief in God in 2002. She began to formulate her critique of Islam and Islamic culture, published many articles on these topics, and became a frequent speaker on television news programs and in public debate forums. She discussed her ideas at length in a book titled &quot;De zoontjesfabriek&quot; (&quot;The Son Factory&quot;) (2002). In this period, she first began to receive death threats.

Cisca Dresselhuys, editor of the feminist magazine &quot;Opzij&quot;, introduced Hirsi Ali to Gerrit Zalm, the parliamentary leader of the centre-right People&#x27;s Party for Freedom and Democracy (VVD), and party member Neelie Kroes, then European Commissioner for Competition. At their urging, Hirsi Ali agreed to switch to their party of the VVD and stood for election to Parliament. Between November 2002 and January 2003, she lived abroad while on the payroll as an assistant of the VVD.

In 2003, aged 33, Hirsi Ali successfully fought a parliamentary election. She said that the Dutch welfare state had overlooked abuse of Muslim women and girls in the Netherlands and their social needs, contributing to their isolation and oppression.

During her tenure in Parliament, Hirsi Ali continued her criticisms of Islam and many of her statements provoked controversy. In an interview in the Dutch newspaper &quot;Trouw&quot;, she said that by Western standards, Muhammad as represented in the Qu&#x27;ran would be considered a pedophile. A religious discrimination complaint was filed against her on 24 April 2003 by Muslims who objected to her statements. The Prosecutor&#x27;s office decided not to initiate a case, because her critique did &quot;not put forth any conclusions in respect to Muslims and their worth as a group is not denied&quot;.

=== Film with Theo van Gogh ===
Working with writer and director Theo van Gogh, Hirsi Ali wrote the script and provided the voice-over for &quot;Submission&quot; (2004), a short film that criticised the treatment of women in Islamic society. Juxtaposed with passages from the Qur&#x27;an were scenes of actresses portraying Muslim women suffering abuse. An apparently nude actress dressed in a semi-transparent &quot;burqa&quot; was shown with texts from the Qur&#x27;an written on her skin. These texts are among those often interpreted as justifying the subjugation of Muslim women. The film&#x27;s release sparked outrage among many Dutch Muslims.

Mohammed Bouyeri, a 26-year-old Dutch Moroccan Islamist and member of the Muslim terrorist organisation Hofstad Group, assassinated Van Gogh in an Amsterdam street on 2 November 2004. Bouyeri shot Van Gogh with a handgun eight times, first from a distance and then at short range as the director lay wounded on the ground. He was already dead when Bouyeri cut his throat with a large knife and tried to decapitate him. Bouyeri left a letter pinned to Van Gogh&#x27;s body with a small knife; it was primarily a death threat to Hirsi Ali. The Dutch secret service immediately raised the level of security they provided to Hirsi Ali. Bouyeri was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole.

In 2004, a rap song about Hirsi Ali titled &quot;Hirsi Ali Dis&quot; was produced and distributed on the internet by a group called &quot;The Hague Connection&quot;. The lyrics included violent threats against her life. The rappers were prosecuted under Article 121 of the Dutch criminal code because they hindered Hirsi Ali&#x27;s execution of her work as a politician. In 2005 they were sentenced to community service and a suspended prison sentence.

Hirsi Ali went into hiding, aided by government security services, who moved her among several locations in the Netherlands. They moved her to the United States for several months. On 18 January 2005, she returned to parliament. On 18 February 2005, she revealed where she and her colleague Geert Wilders were living. She demanded a normal, secured house, which she was granted one week later.

In January 2006, Hirsi Ali was recognised as &quot;European of the Year&quot; by &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, an American magazine. In her speech, she urged action to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. She also said that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad should be taken at his word in wanting to organise a conference to investigate objective evidence of the Holocaust, noting that the subject is not taught in the Middle East. She said, &quot;Before I came to Europe, I&#x27;d never heard of the Holocaust. That is the case with millions of people in the Middle East. Such a conference should be able to convince many people away from their denial of the genocide against the Jews.&quot; She also said that what some have described as &quot;Western values&quot; of freedom and justice were universal. But she thought that Europe has done far better than most areas of the world in providing justice, as it has guaranteed the freedom of thought and debate required for critical self-examination. She said communities cannot reform unless &quot;scrupulous investigation of every former and current doctrine is possible.&quot; Hirsi Ali was nominated as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize the same month by Norwegian parliamentarian Christian Tybring-Gjedde.

In March 2006, she co-signed a letter titled &quot;&quot;. Among the eleven other signatories was Salman Rushdie; as a teenager, Hirsi Ali had supported the fatwa against him. The letter was published in response to protests in the Islamic world surrounding the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark, and it supported freedom of press and freedom of expression.

On 27 April 2006, a Dutch judge ruled that Hirsi Ali had to abandon her current secure house at a secret address in the Netherlands. Her neighbors had complained that she created an unacceptable security risk, but the police had testified that this neighborhood was one of the safest places in the country, as they had many personnel assigned to it for Hirsi Ali&#x27;s protection. In an interview in early 2007, Hirsi Ali noted that the Dutch state had spent about €3.5 million on her protection; threats against her produced fear, but she believed it important to speak her mind. While regretting Van Gogh&#x27;s death, she said she was proud of their work together.

A private trust, the Foundation for Freedom of Expression, was established in 2007 in the Netherlands to help fund protection of Ayaan Hirsi Ali and other Muslim dissidents.

=== Dutch citizenship controversy ===

In May 2006, the TV programme &quot;Zembla&quot; reported that Hirsi Ali had given false information about her name, her age, and her country of residence when originally applying for asylum, in a documentary called &quot;The Holy Ayaan&quot;. In her asylum application, she had claimed to be fleeing a forced marriage, but the &quot;Zembla&quot; coverage featured interviews with her family, who denied that claim. The program alleged that, contrary to Hirsi Ali&#x27;s claims of having fled a Somali war zone, the MP had been living comfortably in upper middle-class conditions safely in Kenya with her family for at least 12 years before she sought refugee status in the Netherlands in 1992. In her version of events, she had fled civil war in Somalia, was forced into an arranged marriage with a man whom she had never met and was not present at her own wedding. Upon escaping she was forced into hiding in the Netherlands, for her ex-husband and father&#x27;s brothers would have been by Somali custom, required to perform an honor killing. According to witnesses on the programme, she left Somalia prior to any mass violence and led a comfortable, upper-middle class life in neighboring Kenya, where she attended a Muslim girls&#x27; school and received a full western-style education with a focus on the humanities and science.

Hirsi Ali had already admitted to friends and VVD party colleagues that she had lied about her full name, date of birth, and the manner in which she had come to the Netherlands in her asylum application, but persisted in saying it was true that she was trying to flee a forced marriage. In her first book, &quot;The Son Factory&quot; (2002), she had already provided her real name and date of birth, and she had also stated these in a September 2002 interview published in the political magazine &quot;HP/De Tijd&quot;. and in an interview in the &quot;VARA gids&quot; (2002). Hirsi Ali asserted in her 2006 autobiography (2007 in English) &quot;Infidel&quot; that she had already made full disclosure of the discrepancy to VVD officials back when she was invited to run for parliament in 2002. On the issue of her name, she applied under her grandfather&#x27;s surname in her asylum application (&#x27;Ali&#x27; instead of what had till then been &#x27;Magan&#x27;), to which she was entitled nonetheless; she later said it was to escape detection and retaliation by her clan for the foiled marriage. In the later parliamentary investigation of Hirsi Ali&#x27;s immigration, the Dutch law governing names was reviewed. An applicant may legally use a surname derived from any generation as far back as the grandparent. Therefore, Hirsi Ali&#x27;s application, though against her clan custom of names, was legal under Dutch law. The question of her age was of minor concern. Media speculation arose in 2006 that she could lose her Dutch citizenship because of these issues, rendering her ineligible for parliament. At first, Minister Rita Verdonk said she would not look into the matter. She later decided to investigate Hirsi Ali&#x27;s naturalisation process. The investigation found that Hirsi Ali had not legitimately received Dutch citizenship, because she had lied about her name and date of birth. However, later inquiries established that she was entitled to use the name Ali because it was her grandfather&#x27;s name. Verdonk moved to annul Hirsi Ali&#x27;s citizenship, an action later overridden at the urging of Parliament.

On 15 May 2006, after the broadcast of the &quot;Zembla&quot; documentary, news stories appeared saying that Hirsi Ali was likely to move to the United States that September. She was reported to be planning to write a book titled &quot;Shortcut to Enlightenment&quot; and to work for the American Enterprise Institute. On 16 May Hirsi Ali resigned from Parliament after admitting that she had lied on her asylum application. In a press conference she said that the facts had been publicly known since 2002, when they had been reported in the media and in one of her publications. She also restated her claim of seeking asylum to prevent a forced marriage, stating: &quot;How often do people who are seeking refuge provide different names? The penalty of stripping me of my Dutch citizenship is disproportional.&quot; Her stated reason for resigning immediately was the increasing media attention. Since a Dutch court had ruled in April 2006, that she had to leave her house by August 2006, she decided to relocate to the United States in September 2006.

After a long and emotional debate in the Dutch Parliament, all major parties supported a motion requesting the Minister to explore the possibility of special circumstances in Hirsi Ali&#x27;s case. Although Verdonk remained convinced that the applicable law did not leave her room to consider such circumstances, she decided to accept the motion. During the debate, she said that Hirsi Ali still had Dutch citizenship during the period of reexamination. Apparently the &quot;decision&quot; she had announced had represented the current position of the Dutch government. Hirsi Ali at that point had six weeks to react to the report before any final decision about her citizenship was taken. Verdonk was strongly criticised for her actions in such a sensitive case. In addition to her Dutch passport, Hirsi Ali retained a Dutch residency permit based on being a political refugee. According to the minister, this permit could not be taken away from her since it had been granted more than 12 years before.

Reacting to news of Hirsi Ali&#x27;s planned relocation to the US, former VVD leader Hans Wiegel stated that her departure &quot;would not be a loss to the VVD and not be a loss to the House of Representatives&quot;. He said that Hirsi Ali was a brave woman, but that her opinions were polarizing. Former parliamentary leader of the VVD, Jozias van Aartsen, said that it is &quot;painful for Dutch society and politics that she is leaving the House of Representatives&quot;. Another VVD MP, Bibi de Vries, said that if something were to happen to Hirsi Ali, some people in her party would have &quot;blood on their hands&quot;. United States Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick said in May 2006, &quot;we recognise that she is a very courageous and impressive woman and she is welcome in the US.&quot;

On 23 May 2006, Ayaan Hirsi made available to &quot;The New York Times&quot; some letters she believed would provide insight into her 1992 asylum application. In one letter her sister Haweya warned her that the entire extended family was searching for her (after she had fled to the Netherlands), and in another letter her father denounced her. Christopher DeMuth, president of the American Enterprise Institute (AEI), said that the asylum controversy would not affect the appointment. He stated that he was still looking forward to &quot;welcoming her to AEI, and to America.&quot;

On 27 June 2006, the Dutch government announced that Hirsi Ali would keep her Dutch citizenship. On the same day a letter was disclosed in which Hirsi Ali expressed regret for misinforming Minister Verdonk. Hirsi Ali was allowed to retain her name. Dutch immigration rules allowed asylum seekers to use grandparents&#x27; names. Her grandfather had used the last name Ali until his thirties and then switched to Magan, which was her father&#x27;s and family&#x27;s surname. This grandfather&#x27;s birth year of 1845 had complicated the investigation. (Hirsi Ali&#x27;s father Hirsi Magan Isse was the youngest of his many children and born when her grandfather was close to 90). Later the same day Hirsi Ali, through her lawyer and in television interviews, stated that she had signed the resignation letter, drafted by the Justice Department, under duress. She felt it was forced in order for her to keep her passport, but she had not wanted to complicate her pending visa application for the US. she still carried her Dutch passport.

In a special parliamentary session on 28 June 2006, questions were raised about these issues. The ensuing political upheaval on 29 June ultimately led to the fall of the second Balkenende cabinet.

== Life in the United States ==
In 2006, Hirsi Ali took a position at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.; as the Dutch government continued to provide security for her, this required an increase in their effort and costs.

On 17 April 2007, the local Muslim community in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, protested Hirsi Ali&#x27;s planned lecture at the local campus of the University of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh imam Fouad El Bayly said that the activist deserved the death sentence but should be tried and judged in an Islamic country.

On 25 September 2007, Hirsi Ali received her green card. In October 2007, she returned to the Netherlands, continuing her work for AEI from a secret address. The Dutch minister of Justice Hirsch Ballin had informed her of his ruling that, as of 1 October 2007, the Dutch government would no longer pay for her security abroad. That year she declined an offer to live in Denmark, saying she intended to return to the United States.

On 25 April 2013, she became a citizen of the United States.

She was a Fellow with the Future of Diplomacy Project at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at The Harvard Kennedy School from 2016 to 2019.

=== Al-Qaeda hit list ===

In 2010, Anwar al-Awlaki published a hit list in his &quot;Inspire&quot; magazine, including Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Geert Wilders and Salman Rushdie along with cartoonists Lars Vilks and three &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; staff members: Kurt Westergaard, Carsten Juste, and Flemming Rose. The list was later expanded to include Stéphane &quot;Charb&quot; Charbonnier, who was murdered in 2015 in a terror attack on &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; in Paris, along with 11 other people. After the attack, Al-Qaeda called for more killings.

=== Brandeis University ===
In early 2014, Brandeis University in Massachusetts announced that Ali would be given an honorary degree at the graduation ceremony. In early April, the university rescinded its offer following a review of her statements that was carried out in response to protests by the Council on American–Islamic Relations (CAIR) and lobbying by Joseph E. B. Lumbard, Head of the Islamic Studies Department, other faculty members and several student groups that accused Hirsi Ali of &quot;hate speech&quot;. University president Frederick M. Lawrence said that &quot;certain of her past statements&quot; were inconsistent with the university&#x27;s &quot;core values&quot; because they were &quot;Islamophobic&quot;. Others expressed opinions both for and against this decision. The university said she was welcome to come to the campus for a dialogue in the future.

The university&#x27;s withdrawal of its invitation generated controversy and condemnation among some. But, &quot;The Economist&quot; noted at the time that Hirsi Ali&#x27;s &quot;wholesale condemnations of existing religions just aren&#x27;t done in American politics.&quot; It said that &quot;the explicit consensus in America is ecumenical and strongly pro-religious&quot;. The university was distinguishing between an open intellectual exchange, which could occur if Hirsi Ali came to campus for a dialogue and appearing to celebrate her with an honorary degree.

A Brandeis spokesperson said that Ali had not been invited to speak at commencement but simply to be among honorary awardees. She claimed to have been invited to speak and expressed shock at Brandeis&#x27;s action. Hirsi Ali said CAIR&#x27;s letter misrepresented her and her work, but that it has long been available on the Internet. She said that the &quot;spirit of free expression&quot; has been betrayed and stifled.

David Bernstein, a law professor at George Mason University, criticised the Brandeis decision as an attack on academic values of freedom of inquiry and intellectual independence.

Lawrence J. Haas, the former communications director and press secretary for Vice President Al Gore, published an open letter saying that Brandeis&#x27;s president had &quot;succumbed to political correctness and interest group pressure in deciding that Islam is beyond the pale of legitimate inquiry ... that such a decision is particularly appalling for a university president, for a campus is precisely the place to encourage free discussion even on controversial matters.&quot;

=== Designation by Southern Poverty Law Center ===

In October 2016, the Southern Poverty Law Center accused Ayaan, and the Muslim activist Maajid Nawaz, of being &quot;anti-Muslim extremists&quot;, which caused protests in several prominent newspapers. The Lantos Foundation for Human Rights &amp; Justice wrote a public letter to the SPLC asking them to retract the listings.

In April 2018, the SPLC retracted the &quot;Anti-Muslim Extremist&quot; list in its entirety after Nawaz threatened legal action over his inclusion on the list.

=== Australia tour ===
In April 2017, she cancelled a planned tour of Australia. This followed the Facebook release of a video by six Australian Muslim women who accused her of being a &quot;star of the global Islamophobia industry&quot; and of profiting from &quot;an industry that exists to dehumanize Muslim women&quot; but did not call for her to cancel her trip. Ali responded that the women in question were &quot;carrying water&quot; for the causes of radical Islamists and stated that &quot;Islamophobia&quot; is a manufactured word. She said that the cancellation was due to organisational problems.

== Social and political views ==

Hirsi Ali joined the VVD political party in 2002; it combines &quot;classically liberal&quot; views on the economy, foreign policy, crime and immigration with a liberal social stance on abortion and homosexuality. She says that she admires Frits Bolkestein, a former Euro-commissioner and ideological leader of the party.

Hirsi Ali is the founder and president of the AHA Foundation, a non-profit humanitarian organisation to protect women and girls in the U.S. against political Islam and harmful tribal customs that violate U.S. law and international conventions. Through the AHA Foundation, Hirsi Ali campaigns against the denial of education for girls, female genital mutilation, forced marriage, honour violence and killings, and suppression of information about the crimes through the misuse and misinterpretation of rights to freedom of religion and free speech in the U.S. and the West.

Hirsi Ali has praised western liberalism. She was a participant in the first conference of the Alliance for Responsible Citizenship, speaking on the personal choice to support a narrative for western civilisation.

Hirsi Ali is an opponent of &quot;Wokeism&quot; and the Black Lives Matter movement, comparing them to ISIS, saying both reflected the &quot;intolerant doctrines of a religious cult&quot;. In an interview with Douglas Murray on &quot;Piers Morgan Uncensored&quot;, she called Ibram X. Kendi a racist, adding, &quot;A very loud minority wants to get ahead and is claiming they speak for all blacks and all women, all gender-identity minorities. They don&#x27;t speak for any of these minorities. They do this so that &quot;they&quot; can get ahead. Ibram X. Kendi speaks for himself. Claudine Gay speaks for herself. She doesn&#x27;t speak for me.&quot;

=== Islam and Muslims ===

Hirsi Ali is critical of Islam, including the treatment of women in Islamic societies and the punishments demanded by conservative Islamic scholars for homosexuality, blasphemy and adultery. She publicly identified as Muslim until 28 May 2002, when she acknowledged in her diary that she knew she was not.

She also explained in an interview that she began a serious reassessment of her religious beliefs after the 9/11 attacks and when she was drinking wine in an Italian restaurant, stating &quot;I asked myself: Why should I burn in hell just because I&#x27;m drinking this? But what prompted me even more was the fact that the killers of 9/11 all believed in the same God I believed in.&quot;

In a 2007 interview in the London &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, Hirsi Ali characterised Islam as &quot;the new fascism&quot;:

Just like Nazism started with Hitler&#x27;s vision, the Islamic vision is a caliphate—a society ruled by Sharia law—in which women who have sex before marriage are stoned to death, homosexuals are beaten, and apostates like me are killed. Sharia law is as inimical to liberal democracy as Nazism ... Violence is inherent in Islam—it&#x27;s a destructive, nihilistic cult of death. It legitimates murder.

In a 2007 article in &quot;Reason&quot;, Hirsi Ali said that Islam, the religion, must be defeated and that &quot;we are at war with Islam. And there&#x27;s no middle ground in wars.&quot; She said, &quot;Islam, period. Once it&#x27;s defeated, it can mutate into something peaceful. It&#x27;s very difficult to even talk about peace now. They&#x27;re not interested in peace ... There comes a moment when you crush your enemy. ... and if you don&#x27;t do that, then you have to live with the consequence of being crushed.&quot; Adding: &quot;the Christian powers have accepted the separation of the worldly and the divine. We don&#x27;t interfere with their religion, and they don&#x27;t interfere with the state. That hasn&#x27;t happened in Islam.&quot;

Max Rodenbeck, writing in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, argued that Ali is really criticising what she has, at points, called &quot;Medina Muslims&quot;, meaning a minority of Islamic fundamentalists who envision a regime based on sharia, and who ignore the more inclusive passages of Muhammad&#x27;s Meccan period. In a Congressional hearing, Ali has argued this is because politics is built into the faith of Muslim people, saying:&quot;Islam is part religion, and part a political-military doctrine, the part that is a political doctrine contains a world view, a system of laws and a moral code that is totally incompatible with our constitution, our laws, and our way of life.&quot; Although Hirsi Ali has previously described Islam as beyond reform, she has stated that the Arab Spring and growing visibility of women&#x27;s rights activists within Muslim societies has demonstrated to her that a liberal reformation of Islam is possible, and outlines how this could be achieved in her book &quot;Heretic&quot; by supporting reformist Muslims.

She described Islamic societies as lagging &quot;in enlightened thinking, tolerance and knowledge of other cultures&quot; and that their history cannot cite a single person who &quot;made a discovery in science or technology, or changed the world through artistic achievement&quot;.

In a 2010 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she compared the responses of Christians and Muslims to criticism of their respective religions. While Christians would often simply ignore criticism, Muslims would instead take offence, display a victim mentality and take criticism as insults.

She insists that many contemporary Muslims have not yet transitioned to modernity, and that many Muslim immigrants are culturally unsuited to life in the West and are therefore a burden. Ali calls upon atheists, Christians, Europeans, and Americans to unite against Muslim extremism in the West. She urges the former to educate Muslims and the latter, especially Western Churches, to convert &quot;as many Muslims as possible to Christianity, introducing them to a God who rejects Holy War and who has sent his son to die for all sinners out of love for mankind&quot;.

Speaking in April 2015 on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio program, Hirsi Ali said:

It&#x27;s wrong for Western leaders like [former Prime Minister of Australia] Tony Abbott to say the actions of the Islamic State aren&#x27;t about religion. I want to say to him &#x27;please don&#x27;t say such things in public because it&#x27;s just not true.&#x27; You&#x27;re letting down all the individuals who are reformers within Islam who are asking the right questions that will ultimately bring about change.

When discussing Muslims who become radicalized by Islamic State on the internet, Hirsi Ali argued that many of these people already adhered to fundamentalist Islamic ideas or came from families and communities that followed a literal practice of Islam before ISIS declared a caliphate, and that ISIS now gave them a focus to execute their beliefs. She commented that what the media has come to refer to as &quot;radical Islam&quot; or &quot;extremist&quot; individuals are in fact Muslims who become more pious in their beliefs and take both the Quran and examples set by the Islamic prophet Muhammad literally. She concluded that &quot;people who have that mentality and that mindset are not a minority and they are not a fringe minority. Because of the large number of people who believe in this within Muslim communities and families who believe in this, definitely not all, but it is so large that these individuals who want to take action, who want to take it beyond believing and beyond practicing but actually want to kill people, they have a large enough group to hide in.&quot;

In a 2016 presentation for the American conservative platform &quot;PragerU&quot;, Hirsi Ali asserted that a reform of Islam was vital. She elaborated that while the majority of Muslims are peaceful, Islam as a belief-system in its current form cannot be considered a religion of peace as justification for violence against homosexuals, apostates and those deemed guilty of blasphemy are still clearly stated within Islamic scripture and that Western leaders need to stop downplaying the link between Islam and Islamic terrorism. She also added that Western progressives have often dismissed reformist and dissident Muslims as &quot;not representative&quot; and accused any criticism of Islam of being racist. She argued that instead, Western liberals should assist and ally themselves with Muslim reformists who put themselves at risk to push for change by drawing a parallel to when Russian dissidents who internally challenged the ideology of the Soviet Union during the Cold War were celebrated and assisted by people in the West.

In 2017, Hirsi Ali spoke of how &quot;Dawah&quot; is often a precursor to Islamism. In an article for &quot;The Sun&quot; she stated &quot;in theory, &quot;dawa&quot; is a simple call to Islam. As Islamists practice the concept, however, it is a subversive, indoctrinating precursor to jihad. A process of methodical brainwashing that rejects assimilation and places Muslims in opposition to Western civic ideals. It is facilitated by funding from the Middle East, local charities and is carried out in mosques, Islamic centres, Muslim schools and even in people&#x27;s living rooms. Its goal is to erode and ultimately destroy the political institutions of a free society and replace them with Sharia law.&quot;

==== Muhammad ====

Hirsi Ali criticises the central Islamic prophet on morality and personality traits (criticisms based on biographical details or depictions by Islamic texts and early followers of Muhammad). Muslims filed a religious discrimination suit against her that year. The civil court in the Hague acquitted Hirsi Ali of any charges, but said that she &quot;could have made a better choice of words&quot;.

=== Female genital mutilation ===

Hirsi Ali is an opponent of female genital mutilation (FGM), which she has criticized in many of her writings. When in the Dutch parliament, she proposed obligatory annual medical checks for all girls living in the Netherlands who came from countries where it is practised. She proposed that if a physician found that such a girl had been mutilated, a report to the police would be required—with protection of the child prevailing over privacy.

=== Atheism and Christianity ===
After formally renouncing Islam, Ali identified as an atheist. One of her decisions to stop believing in God was after reading the &quot;Atheïstisch manifest&quot; by Dutch philosopher Herman Philipse a year after the 9/11 attacks and that she agreed with arguments put forward by Bertrand Russell, Christopher Hitchens and Richard Dawkins on organized religion. Alongside Dawkins, Hitchens, Daniel Dennett, and Sam Harris, collectively nicknamed the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot;, Hirsi Ali is sometimes referred to as the fifth &quot;Horseman&quot; or &quot;Horsewoman&quot; of New Atheism.

In November 2023, Hirsi Ali converted to Christianity stating that &quot;atheism can&#x27;t equip us for civilisational war.&quot; Explaining her decision in an essay for UnHerd, Ali argued that the West was under threat from &quot;the resurgence of great-power authoritarianism and expansionism in the forms of the Chinese Communist Party and Vladimir Putin&#x27;s Russia; the rise of global Islamism, which threatens to mobilise a vast population against the West; and the viral spread of woke ideology, which is eating into the moral fibre of the next generation.&quot; Against such threats, secular approaches, whether they be arguments, technologies, or military force, are, in her view, inadequate. She concluded that upholding Judeo-Christian traditions was the most credible answer for the Western society to survive. The essay generated criticism both from Christians, who interpreted her conversion to Christianity as merely a cultural response, not a spiritual one, and from atheists who were &quot;baffled&quot; that she had not addressed what they considered materialist rebuttals of Christianity.

Some commentators such as Sarah Jones writing for &quot;New York&quot; magazine, suggested that for Hirsi Ali, &quot;atheism only ever propped up her career as a culture warrior&quot;. Abandoning a New Atheist movement &quot;in terminal decline&quot; for a new vehicle, &quot;she remains on the same crusade, inveighing against Islam and having simply exchanged one banner for another&quot;. However, columnist Ross Douthat in &quot;The New York Times&quot; assessed Hirsi Ali&#x27;s decision to be the result of &quot;a twofold realization&quot;: first, that atheistic materialism is too weak a base to build Western liberalism upon; and second, that while atheism had briefly provided &quot;a sense of liberation from punitive religion&quot;, she found the long term sense of life without spiritual solace to be &quot;unendurable&quot;.

=== Feminism ===

Hirsi Ali has criticized Western feminists for avoiding the issue of the subjugation of women in the Muslim world and singled out Germaine Greer for arguing that FGM needs to be considered a &quot;cultural identity&quot; that Western women do not understand.

During the Brandeis University controversy, Hirsi Ali noted that &quot;an authority on &#x27;Queer/Feminist Narrative Theory&#x27; ... [sided] with the openly homophobic Islamists&quot; in speaking against her.

Rich Lowry wrote in &quot;Politico&quot; that while Hirsi Ali had many traits that should have made her a &quot;feminist hero&quot;, such as being a refugee from an abusive patriarchy and an African immigrant who made her way to a Western country and became an advocate for women&#x27;s rights, this did not happen because she was &quot;a dissident of the wrong religion&quot;. Some feminists instead criticise Hirsi Ali for &quot;strengthening racism&quot; instead of &quot;weakening sexism&quot;.

=== Freedom of speech ===

In a 2006 lecture in Berlin, she defended the right to offend, following the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons controversy in Denmark. She condemned the journalists of those papers and TV channels that did not show their readers the cartoons as being &quot;mediocre of mind&quot;. She also praised publishers all over Europe for showing the cartoons and not being afraid of what she called the &quot;hard-line Islamist movement&quot;. In 2017, Hirsi Ali described the word Islamophobia as a &quot;manufactured term&quot; and argued &quot;we can&#x27;t stop the injustices if we say everything is &quot;Islamophobic&quot; and hide behind a politically correct screen.&quot;

=== Political opponents ===

In 2006, Hirsi Ali as MP supported the move by the Dutch courts to abrogate the party subsidy to a conservative Protestant Christian political party, the Political Reformed Party (SGP), which did not grant full membership rights to women and withholds passive voting rights from female members. She said that any political party discriminating against women or homosexuals should be deprived of funding.

=== Opposition to denominational or faith schools ===

In the Netherlands about half of all education has historically been provided by sponsored religious schools, most of them Christian, both Catholic and Protestant. As Muslims began to ask for support for schools, the state provided it and by 2005, there were 41 Islamic schools in the nation. This was based on the idea in the 1960s that Muslims could become one of the &quot;pillars&quot; of Dutch society, as were Protestants, Catholics and secular residents. Hirsi Ali has opposed state funding of any religious schools, including Islamic ones. In a 2007 interview with London-based &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, Hirsi Ali urged the British government to close all Muslim faith schools in the country and instead integrate Muslim pupils into mainstream society, arguing &quot;Britain is sleepwalking into a society that could be ruled by Sharia law within decades unless Islamic schools are shut down and young Muslims are instead made to integrate and accept Western liberal values.&quot; In 2017, Hirsi Ali reasserted her belief that Islamic faith schools should be closed if they are found to be indoctrinating their students into political Islam and that such faith schools often exist in migrant dominated communities where students will have a lesser chance of integrating into mainstream society and that such cultural and educational &quot;cocooning&quot; breeds a lack of understanding or hostility towards the host culture. In 2020, Hirsi Ali stated that children in predominantly Muslim schools are less likely to be taught about the Holocaust and argued that schools should not cave into demands from Muslim parents that children should not be taught to remember the Holocaust in history lessons.

=== Development aid ===

The Netherlands has always been one of the most prominent countries that support aiding developing countries. As the spokesperson of the VVD in the parliament on this matter, Hirsi Ali said that the current aid policy had not achieved an increase in prosperity, peace and stability in developing countries: &quot;The VVD believes that Dutch international aid has failed until now, as measured by [the Dutch aid effects on] poverty reduction, famine reduction, life expectancy and the promotion of peace.&quot;

=== Immigration ===
In 2003, Hirsi Ali worked together with fellow VVD MP Geert Wilders for several months. They questioned the government about immigration policy. In reaction to the UN Development Programme 2003 Arab Human Development Report, Hirsi Ali requested Minister of Foreign Affairs Jaap de Hoop Scheffer and the Minister without Portfolio for Development Cooperation Agnes van Ardenne to clarify government policy regarding the Arab world. Hirsi Ali and Wilders asked the government whether the report prompted changes in Dutch cooperation policy with the Arab world and in Dutch policy to reduce immigration from the Arab world to Europe, and in particular the Netherlands.

Although she publicly supported the policy of VVD minister Rita Verdonk to limit immigration, privately she was not supportive, as she explained in a June 2006 interview for &quot;Opzij.&quot; This interview was given after she resigned from Parliament, and shortly after she had moved to the United States.

In parliament, Hirsi Ali had supported the way Verdonk handled the Pasić case, although privately she felt that Pasić should have been allowed to stay. On the night before the debate, she phoned Verdonk to tell her that she had lied when she applied for asylum in the Netherlands, just as Pasić had. She said that Verdonk responded that if she had been minister at that time, she would have had Hirsi Ali deported.

In 2015, when Donald Trump suggested a complete ban on all Muslims entering the United States as part of his presidential campaign, Hirsi Ali responded by saying that such a pledge gave &quot;false hope&quot; to voters by questioning the reality of how such policy would be implemented and in practice it would offer a short-term solution to a long term ideological issue. However, she also praised Trump&#x27;s campaign messages for highlighting the problems posed by Islamic fundamentalism and said the outgoing Obama administration had &quot;conspicuously avoided any discussion of Islamic theology, even avoiding use of the term radical Islam altogether.&quot;

In response to the Trump administration&#x27;s Executive Order 13769 which imposed a travel ban on and temporarily restricted immigration and visa applications from several Muslim majority countries, Hirsi Ali described the ban as both &quot;clumsy&quot; but also &quot;too narrow&quot; for excluding nations such as Pakistan and Saudi Arabia who have been implicated in terrorism. However, she also stated agreement with Trump&#x27;s assertion that some immigrants from Muslim nations are less likely to adapt to a Westernized lifestyle or are harder to screen as potential security risks, citing Ahmad Khan Rahami and Tashfeen Malik as examples of Muslims who entered the U.S. on immigration visas before committing acts of terrorism. She also maintained that as an immigrant herself, she was not opposed to Muslim immigrants coming to America seeking a better life but expressed concern over the attitudes that younger generations of Muslim-Americans bring with them and that society had a limited capacity to change those values. She has also defended the right for Western nations to screen all prospective Muslim immigrants to assess their beliefs and deport or deny residency to those who display sympathetic views to fundamentalism and violence.

In 2020, Ayaan echoed statements made by French President Emmanuel Macron that Muslim immigrant communities, composed of both newly arrived migrants and second generation immigrants, had formed &quot;separatist societies&quot; in some European nations, and that there are &quot;pockets of Europe&quot; where Muslims have limited access to education or jobs and extremist Muslims &quot;come in and take advantage of them.&quot; She also argued that many of the problems Europe faces in the twenty-first century with terrorism and parallel societies was born out of &quot;racism of low expectations&quot; in the past, in which European governments did not expect immigrants from Middle Eastern or African backgrounds to become Europeanized or have the capability to contribute positively, but instead out of misguided compassion, multicultural sentiments and political correctness, encouraged immigrants to keep their native cultures or caved into demands from religiously conservative immigrant communities who rejected European culture.

Hirsi Ali discussed her view on immigration in Europe, in an op-ed article published in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 2006.

Regarding unemployment, social marginalization and poverty among certain immigrant communities, Hirsi Ali places the burden of responsibility squarely on Islam and migrant culture.

In 2010, she opposed the idea of preventing immigrants from traditional Muslim societies from immigrating, claiming that allowing them to immigrate made the U.S. a &quot;highly moral country&quot;.

=== Assimilation ===

&quot;When I speak of assimilation&quot;, Ali clarifies, &quot;I mean assimilation into civilization. Aboriginals, Afghanis, Somalis, Arabs, Native Americans—all these non-Western groups have to make that transition to modernity&quot;. Sadiya Abubakar Isa criticized these comments in an article for the &quot;Indonesian Journal of Islam and Muslim Societies&quot;, accusing her of Orientalism.

=== Israel and the Palestinians ===
On the way Israel is perceived in the Netherlands, she has said:

The crisis of Dutch socialism can be sized up in its attitudes toward both Islam and Israel. It holds Israel to exceptionally high moral standards. The Israelis, however, will always do well, because they themselves set high standards for their actions. The standards for judging the Palestinians, however, are very low. Most outsiders remain silent on all the problems in their territories. That helps the Palestinians become even more corrupt than they already are. Those who live in the territories are not allowed to say anything about this because they risk being murdered by their own people.

== Personal life ==

Hirsi Ali married British–American historian Niall Ferguson on 10 September 2011. They have two sons.

In 2023, Hirsi Ali announced that she had become a Christian.

== Reception ==

Hirsi Ali has attracted praise and criticism from English-speaking commentators. Literary critic and journalist Christopher Hitchens regarded her as &quot;the most important public intellectual probably ever to come out of Africa.&quot; Patt Morrison of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Hirsi Ali a freedom fighter for feminism who has &quot;put her life on the line to defend women against radical Islam.&quot; Jill Filipovic of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;There are few women in the world who generate as much animosity, and as many accusations of hypocrisy, as Ayaan Hirsi Ali.&quot;

Tunku Varadarajan wrote in 2017 that, with &quot;multiple fatwas on her head, Hirsi Ali has a greater chance of meeting a violent end than anyone I&#x27;ve met, Salman Rushdie included.&quot; According to Andrew Anthony of &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Ayaan Hirsi Ali is admired by many secularists and &quot;loathed not just by Islamic fundamentalists but by many western liberals, who find her rejection of Islam almost as objectionable as her embrace of western liberalism.&quot;

=== Criticism ===
Ali&#x27;s public commentary and stances, particularly her criticisms of Islam, have elicited denunciations from a number of commentators and academics. Ibrahim Hooper, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, condemned her as &quot;one of the worst of the worst of the Islam haters in America, not only in America but worldwide.&quot; Saba Mahmood wrote that Hirsi Ali &quot;had no public profile until she decided to capitalize on the anti-Muslim sentiment that swept Europe following the events of 9/11&quot;. Adam Yaghi has questioned her appeal in American society where her &quot;serial autobiographies are treated as honest and reliable testimonies in spite of the troubling inaccuracies, exaggerated descriptions, blunt neo-Orientalist portrayals, and sweeping generalizations&quot;. Stephen Sheehi wrote that in spite of her lack of scholarly credentials and academic qualifications &quot;to speak authoritatively about Islam and the Arab world&quot;, Hirsi Ali has been accepted in the West as a scholar, feminist activist, and reformer primarily on the grounds of her &quot;insider claims about Islam&quot;.

Other critics have called Ali an &quot;inauthentic ethnic voice&quot; at the service of &quot;imperialist feminism&quot;. Kiran Grewal asserted that Ali is &quot;a classic enactment of the colonial &#x27;civilizing mission&#x27; discourse&quot;, while &quot;Salon&quot;&#x27;s Nathan Lean called Hirsi Ali&#x27;s story as the &quot;modern-day version of [a] hoary captivity narrative&quot; of the type popular during the Barbary Wars. Grewal described Ali&#x27;s works as using &quot;the language of &#x27;lived experience&#x27; to justify an intolerant and exclusionary message&quot; and alleged that her &quot;extremely provocative and often offensive statements regarding Islam and Muslim immigrants in the West&quot; had alienated some feminists and academics.

Yaghi commented that &quot;Ali attributes everything bad to a monolithic Islam, one that transcends geographic and national boundaries ... willfully ignoring her own distinctions between different interpretations of Islam, versions she personally encountered before leaving to the West&quot;. Pearl Abraham has made a similar observation: &quot;[I]n her writings, lectures, and interviews&quot;, Ali &quot;reaches for the simple solution and quick answer. Always and everywhere, she insists on depicting Islam and Muslims as the enemy, her tribal culture as backward&quot;. Hirsi Ali is also criticized for persistently singling out Islam and Muslims, but never manifestations of religious revivalism present with other religions.

According to Rula Jebreal, a Palestinian journalist and foreign policy analyst, Ali&#x27;s criticism applies mostly to &quot;Wahhabism&quot;, the strain of Islam most familiar to Hirsi Ali, and not to Islam as a whole. Jebreal added that Ali&#x27;s &quot;outbursts&quot; originated from her own pain, &quot;physical scars inflicted on her body during childhood&quot;, which were justified by a radical version of the religion into which she was born. Jebreal wrote: &quot;To endorse Hirsi Ali so unabashedly is to insult and mock a billion Muslims. It&#x27;s time to listen to what is being said by the Muslim voices of peace and tolerance. Ayaan Hirsi Ali is not one of them.&quot;

== Publications ==

Hirsi Ali has continued discussion of these issues in her two autobiographies, published in Dutch in 2006 and in English in 2010. In her first work, she said that in 1992 her father arranged to marry her to a distant cousin. She says that she objected to this both on general grounds (she has said she dreaded being forced to submit to a stranger, sexually and socially), and specifically to this man, whom she described as a &quot;bigot&quot; and an &quot;idiot&quot; in her book.

She told her family that she planned to join her husband, who was living in Canada, after obtaining a visa while in Germany. However, in her autobiography, she said she spent her time in Germany trying to devise an escape from her unwanted marriage. Hirsi Ali decided to visit a relative in the Netherlands, and to seek help after arrival and claim asylum.

Her first autobiography, &quot;&quot; (2006), was published in English in 2007. In a review, American Enterprise Institute fellow Joshua Muravchik described the book as &quot;simply a great work of literature&quot;, and compared her to novelist Joseph Conrad.

In her second autobiography, &quot;&quot; (2010, in English), Hirsi Ali wrote that in early 2006, Rita Verdonk had personally approached her to ask for her public support in Verdonk&#x27;s campaign to run for party leader of the VVD. Hirsi Ali wrote that she had personally supported Verdonk&#x27;s opponent, Mark Rutte, as the better choice. She says that after telling Verdonk of her position, the minister became vindictive. Hirsi Ali wrote that, after the 2006 report of the &quot;Zembla&quot; TV program, Verdonk campaigned against Ali in retaliation for her earlier lack of support.

Her latest book was released in February 2021 and is titled &quot;Prey: Immigration, Islam, and the Erosion of Women&#x27;s Rights&quot;.

=== &quot;The Caged Virgin&quot; ===

In his 2006 review of this collection of seventeen essays and articles on Islam by Hirsi Ali, journalist Christopher Hitchens noted her three themes: &quot;first, her own gradual emancipation from tribalism and superstition; second, her work as a parliamentarian to call attention to the crimes being committed every day by Islamist thugs in mainland Europe; and third, the dismal silence, or worse, from many feminists and multiculturalists about this state of affairs.&quot;

He described the activist as a &quot;charismatic figure in Dutch politics&quot; and criticised the Dutch government for how it protected her from Islamic threats after her collaboration with Theo van Gogh on the short film &quot;Submission&quot; and the assassination of the director.

Mahmood noted that the title of the work is &quot;highly reminiscent of the nineteenth-century literary genre centered on Orientalist fantasies of the harem&quot;.

=== &quot;Infidel: My Life&quot; (2007 in English) ===

&quot;The Guardian&quot; summarised &quot;Infidel&quot; thus: &quot;[Hirsi Ali]&#x27;s is a story of exile from her clan through war, famine, arranged marriage, religious apostasy and the shocking murder on the streets of Amsterdam of her collaborator, Theo van Gogh. Told with lyricism, wit, huge sorrow and a great heart, this is one of the most amazing adventure narratives of the age of mass migration.&quot;

William Grimes wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;The circuitous, violence-filled path that led Ms. Hirsi Ali from Somalia to the Netherlands is the subject of &quot;Infidel,&quot; her brave, inspiring and beautifully written memoir. Narrated in clear, vigorous prose, it traces the author&#x27;s geographical journey from Mogadishu to Saudi Arabia, Ethiopia and Kenya, and her desperate flight to the Netherlands to escape an arranged marriage.&quot;

In his critique of the book, Christopher Hitchens noted that two leading leftist intellectual commentators, Timothy Garton Ash and Ian Buruma, described Hirsi Ali as an &quot;Enlightenment fundamentalist[s]&quot;. Hitchens noted further that, far from being a &quot;fundamentalist&quot;, Hirsi escaped from a &quot;society where women are subordinate, censorship is pervasive, and violence is officially preached against unbelievers.&quot;

=== &quot;Nomad: From Islam to America&quot; ===

&quot;The Guardian&quot; observed that &quot;Nomad&quot; describes &quot;a clan system shattering on the shores of modernity&quot;. The books expands Hirsi Ali&#x27;s previous early life descriptions focusing on &quot;the remarkable figure of her grandmother, who gave birth to daughters alone in the desert and cut her own umbilical cord, raged at herself for producing too many girls, rebelled against her husband, arranged for the circumcision of her granddaughters and instilled in them an unforgiving, woman-hating religion.&quot; According to the newspaper&#x27;s review, &quot;Hirsi Ali observes that her own nomadic journey has been taken across borders that have been mental as much as geographical. In &quot;Nomad&quot; she calls her ancestral voices into direct confrontation with her demands for reform of Islamic theology. The result is electrifying.&quot;

Hirsi Ali called &quot;Nomad&quot; her most provocative book for urging moderate Muslims to become Christians. She later backed off from this view. After witnessing the Arab Spring, Hirsi Ali also took back her argument in &quot;Nomad&quot; that Islam is beyond reform.

=== &quot;Heretic: Why Islam Needs a Reformation Now&quot; ===

In the book Hirsi Ali quoted statistics such that 75% of Pakistanis favour the death penalty for apostasy and argue that Sharia law is gaining ground in many Muslim-majority nations. Hirsi Ali quotes verses in the Qur&#x27;an encouraging followers to use violence and make the argument that as long as the Qur&#x27;an is perceived to be the literal divine words, violent extremists have a justification for their acts.

Andrew Anthony for &quot;The Guardian&quot; in 2015 wrote that even her fiercest critics would have problems denying what Hirsi Ali writes about current issues in Islam, and since those issues are unpalatable, an added difficulty is a cultural practice to &quot;not offend anyone.&quot; Anthony concluded that regardless of what critics may think of her solution, Hirsi Ali should be commended for her &quot;unblinking determination to address the problem.&quot;

Susan Dominus of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;In &quot;Heretic,&quot; Hirsi Ali forgoes autobiography for the most part in favor of an extended argument. But she has trouble making anyone else&#x27;s religious history—even that of Muhammad himself, whose life story she recounts—as dramatic as she has made her own. And she loses the reader&#x27;s trust with overblown rhetoric. ... She tries to warn Americans about their naïveté in the face of encroaching Islamic influences, maintaining that officials and journalists, out of cultural sensitivity, sometimes play down the honor killings that occur in the West.&quot;

&quot;The Economist&quot; wrote: &quot;Unfortunately, very few Muslims will accept Ms Hirsi Ali&#x27;s full-blown argument, which insists that Islam must change in at least five important ways. A moderate Muslim might be open to discussion of four of her suggestions if the question were framed sensitively. Muslims, she says, must stop prioritizing the afterlife over this life; they must &#x27;shackle sharia&#x27; and respect secular law; they must abandon the idea of telling others, including non-Muslims, how to behave, dress or drink; and they must abandon holy war. However, her biggest proposal is a show-stopper: she wants her old co-religionists to &#x27;ensure that Muhammad and the Koran are open to interpretation and criticism.&#x27;&quot;

<text>Fifteen ships of the British Royal Navy have carried the name HMS &quot;Tiger&quot; after the feline tiger, with a number of others provisionally bearing the name at various stages in their construction:

&#x27;HMS&#x27; - the abbreviation for &#x27;His&#x27; or &#x27;Her Majesty&#x27;s Ship&#x27; is an anachronism before about 1820, when it became a common use by ship commanders; its accepted use by the Admiralty did not happen until some years later.

* &quot;Tiger&quot; (1546) was a 22-gun ship built in 1546, rebuilt in 1570, which was the flagship of the 1586 expedition to the Roanoke Colony. In use as a floating battery after 1600, she was condemned in 1605.

<doc id="870049" wikidata="Q2517292" url="?curid=870049" title="Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)">
<text>A Slayer in the television series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; (both created by Joss Whedon), is a young woman bestowed by fate with supernatural powers and abilities that originate from the heart, soul, and spirit of a pure-demon.

The opening narration in the Buffy series states &quot;In every generation there is a chosen one. She alone will stand against the vampires, the demons, and the forces of darkness. She is the Slayer.&quot;

While they are commonly referred to as &quot;Vampire Slayers&quot; within the series, even by Watchers and vampires themselves, The Slayer operates as a defender of humanity against all supernatural threats.

The reputation of the Slayer is well-known and revered even throughout other dimensions. The notion of the Slayer has been compared to the equivalent of a Demonic &quot;Boogey-Man&quot;, incredibly feared and considered by most to be essentially unconquerable.

==Reception and analysis==
Rhonda Wilcox explains that the First Slayer was violated by the Shadow Men. She contrasts this with Buffy&#x27;s offer of choice to the potentials. Wilcox notes that despite the message of sharing power around the world, not all women are made slayers. She then equates being a slayer with being a leader. Patricia Pender discusses the potentials and sharing of power as well, noting the cultural aspects and providing critique of the cultural portrayals.

Pender also analyzes the reception of Buffy as the slayer in early criticism of the show: &quot;the Slayer is celebrated at the expense of the girl, and the composite character is found inexplicably wanting,&quot; going on to explain this is a flaw in analysis of the character. Pender goes on to discuss the &quot;struggle to balance the demands of her supernatural duties as the Slayer and her desire to live what she sees as a normal teenage life. As several critics have pointed out, this struggle literalises the challenges many, if not all, adolescents experience when negotiating their entry into the adult world&quot;.

Cynthia Fuchs similarly says Buffy&#x27;s character brought an understanding of teenage life, but that her &quot;&#x27;secret identity&#x27; as the slayer exacerbates such ordeals and dreams. She explains further, when analyzing a sequence with the First Slayer, &quot;Buffy&#x27;s perpetual sense of displacement, her sense that she belongs to another &quot;race&quot;, apart from her world (which is populated by humans, demons, and vampires, communities into which she never quite fits), is made concrete for her in the First Slayer.

==The Chosen One==

===The First Slayer===
Thousands of years ago in prehistoric Africa, a group of tribal elders known as the Shadow Men used powerful magic to infuse a captive girl with the heart, soul and spirit of a pure demon known as the Shadow Demon. This process granted the girl great strength, speed, agility, reflexes, healing, endurance and psychic abilities, though it cost her her sanity and connection to humanity. She became The First Slayer: chosen to destroy the demons that plagued the Earth. The Shadow Men&#x27;s descendants went on to form the Watchers&#x27; Council, an organization dedicated to finding, training, and supporting Slayers.

===The Slayer line===
Due to the violent nature of the life of a Slayer, their average lifespan is quite short after being called. Consequently, the Shadow Men&#x27;s spell also created a large number of Potential Slayers—normal girls around the world who may one day be called. When a Slayer dies, one of the Potentials—seemingly chosen at random—gains the powers and abilities of a Slayer. The Watcher&#x27;s Council tries to identify and train these &quot;Potentials&quot; before they are called, locating some as babies, but are not always able to do so, with some girls only being found after they have been activated as the Slayer.

This process continues through the generations until 1997, when one Slayer—Buffy Summers—is killed in battle (by drowning) only to be revived via CPR. Buffy retains her Slayer powers, but her clinical death is enough for the next Slayer to be called. For the next year there are two Slayers in the world: first Kendra, who was called on Buffy&#x27;s death, and then Faith, who was called when Kendra was killed by Drusilla.

The mystical &quot;rules&quot; governing the Calling of Slayers change again in 2003, when Buffy discovers a Scythe forged for the Slayer to wield. Willow Rosenberg uses magic to tap into the Scythe&#x27;s essence at Buffy&#x27;s request, and performs a spell that calls every living Potential Slayer at once, thus ending the legacy of &quot;one girl in all the world&quot;.

After taking the time to find and count them, Buffy states that there are at least 1800 Slayers in the world, 500 of whom are working with the Scooby Gang. Potentials now awaken as Slayers when they reach suitable maturation; for instance, the Slayer Soledad was awakened on her sixteenth birthday.

At the end of Season Eight, Buffy destroys the Seed of Wonder, affecting the magical world; while all active Slayers present on Earth remain, no new Slayers can be called.

At some point in the 21st century, a Slayer faces an army of demons. As a result of this battle, all demons and magicks are banished from Earth&#x27;s dimension. At this point, the Slayer line becomes dormant—while Potential Slayers still exist, none are called for two hundred years.

In the far future, demons eventually find a way to return to Earth&#x27;s dimension, and the next Slayer is finally called—a girl named Melaka Fray.

===Powers and abilities===
The powers that are bestowed upon the Slayer are mostly physical enhancements that vary in degree from Slayer to Slayer.

====Strength====
Slayers are endowed with strength far greater than that of regular humans, some demons and the vast majority of vampires. Buffy Summers, for instance, has been shown to lift, with great effort, a metal portcullis which an entire group of people were unable to budge. She is also capable of bending a steel rifle barrel with little apparent effort and easily bending open the bars of prison cells with her bare hands. Buffy has been recorded throwing human-sized subjects sizable distances and casually lifting steel girders used in construction building

During a fight, Faith Lehane is able to pick up the vampire Angel with one hand and easily throw him across a room, then lift him over her head and slam him into the ceiling. Once, while fighting Buffy, she punched her fist into a wall. She is also seen picking up a barbell with one hand and hitting a woman in the face with it. Genevieve Savidge once slapped a fellow Slayer so hard that her neck snapped in a fit of rage. Since Slayers can take blows from superhuman beings with little to no injury, this indicates the high-end feats of Slayer strength can go above and beyond what one would expect.

One example of a Slayer being stronger than most vampires is in &quot;The Gift&quot;, when Buffy easily lifts Olaf&#x27;s hammer with one hand when Spike was barely able to do so with both hands in &quot;Blood Ties&quot;, and when she defeats the demon Doc easily when Spike is unable to. Angel also remarked in &quot;Sanctuary&quot; that Buffy is &quot;a little bit stronger&quot; than he is, though the humorous tenor of the exchange suggests he may have been understating the difference.

The Slayer&#x27;s strength appears to be largely metaphysical, as it does not seem to add to their body mass and they remain buoyant enough to swim.

Melaka Fray is able to pick up an overweight vampire several times her own size and body mass, lift him up over her head with both hands and throw him over a distance of presumably over 20–25 feet, with no downward arc to his trajectory (which was only interrupted due to his hitting a metal grate, which was extensively deformed on impact).

The psychotic Slayer Dana is able to, through several violent shoves, knock down a metal door as well as deform the edges of a metal gate as she tore it from its hinges.

&quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; often shows inconsistencies in their characters&#x27; physical strength; for example, Buffy was unable to bust open a metal door in &quot;I, Robot... You, Jane&quot;, but casually breaks down metal doors in both &quot;The Harvest&quot; and &quot;End of Days&quot;. Buffy also been successfully bound by rope or chains on multiple occasions. This has been acknowledged frequently in commentaries and interviews by writers and creators of the shows. However, it is stated by Riley that Buffy gets stronger &quot;every day&quot; and is inferred that she may be stronger due to the fact that she has been activated the longest.

====Agility and reflexes====
Slayers are able to move faster and react more quickly than normal human beings. Buffy has been shown snatching a crossbow bolt in mid-flight, dodging gunfire from multiple ranges and setting off a bear trap, but not getting caught in it. At one point Buffy was fast enough to outrun a raiding motorcyclist on his bike shortly after her resurrection. Faith has been shown to dodge shotgun blasts at point-blank range and Dana was able to dodge a tranquilizer dart also fired at point-blank range. A Slayer is capable of superhuman feats of agility. She can leap to great heights; though the maximum is unknown, Buffy was shown to be capable of reaching the roof of the original Sunnydale High in a very short period of time, after running up a sloping wall then flipping onto the roof.

====Resilience and healing====
A Slayer&#x27;s body is substantially more durable and resistant to blunt force trauma than an ordinary human&#x27;s and there is evidence of an incredibly high pain tolerance. It is difficult, though not impossible, to bruise them, break their bones or strain their joints. Buffy has suffered from a sprained arm as a consequence of fighting vampires. Melaka Fray is hit with a steel girder thrown at her from a demon and recovers within minutes; she is also shown to fall from a height of over five stories to land face-first on a cement sidewalk and be only dazed before fully recovering in moments, and at a later time, to fall four stories down, crash through the cement roof of an adjacent building and fall down the height of one more story, and recover instantly. Buffy can leap from a window with a man in her arms, landing on the ground and letting her body take the brunt of the fall. Buffy has been hit by a moving truck, got up and run off. Faith has fallen from a height of three stories on top of a closed dumpster, rolled off it to hit the ground and got up immediately with no signs of damage; she also was able to hold her own in a fight with Buffy less than 24 hours after waking from a nine-month coma—a coma which she entered after surviving a deep stab wound to the abdomen immediately followed by a fall from the top of a multi-story building into a moving truck. Also, in an attempt from the Watcher&#x27;s Council to capture Faith without killing her in &quot;Sanctuary&quot;, they prepare a tranquilizer that is capable of knocking out a man twice her size, which is more than enough to subdue an ordinary young woman her size.

Despite these feats, the Slayer is far from invulnerable. For instance, Buffy has been knocked out by blunt force trauma, such as being hit over the head with a lead pipe by a possessed Cordelia Chase in &quot;Bad Eggs&quot; and with a detached mannequin arm by Ethan Rayne in &quot;The Dark Age&quot;, and was also rendered unconscious when Drusilla jolted her with a cattle prod in &quot;Crush&quot;. In addition, the Slayer can be injured by conventional bullets, bladed weapons, and more advanced weaponry (such as the energy weapons commonly used by the Initiative) just as easily as an ordinary human can, but they can recover from even very severe injuries in remarkably short periods of time. Usually, Buffy is completely healed within 24 hours of being injured, though more serious injuries have been shown to take at least a few days, and Slayers can receive scars. Buffy has survived contact with a live electrical wire; the normally lethal jolt simply renders her unconscious and melts her shoe soles.

The Slayer also appears to have a heightened immune system: Buffy is depicted as almost never getting sick, aside from contracting the flu during a period of great emotional stress.

====Senses====
Slayers possess a heightened awareness of their surroundings. This heightened awareness can, with experience, allow the Slayer to know the position of an attacker and fight them blindfolded or in the dark. This is not a constant ability, however. This skill must be honed through practice and the Slayer usually must focus to achieve the full benefit, as shown in season 5 &quot;Family&quot;, during which, when Tara casts a spell that causes demons to be invisible to the gang, Buffy orders everyone to be quiet and fights a demon without seeing it.

A Slayer also has the limited ability to detect the presence of vampires (and presumably other demons). This power must be honed as with the heightened awareness, and the Slayer must focus to achieve the full effect. This does not prevent Buffy (and other Slayers) from being ambushed by vampires. Buffy could be unusually deficient in this sense: Although she initially distrusts Angel when first meeting him and seems to sense that he is following her for a period of time, she doesn&#x27;t realize until he shows her his vampiric face for the first time that he is a vampire. However, her ability might have been compromised by the presence of Angel&#x27;s soul. Additionally, in &quot;Dirty Girls,&quot; Faith attacks Spike under the impression that he is chasing an innocent girl and is unaware that he was in fact pursuing a vampire until said vampire attacks her from behind.

In the 1992 film, the ability to detect vampires manifested itself in the form of feminine cramps. (Merrick describes this as a &quot;natural reaction to their unnatural presence&quot;.) This ability was inconsistent, as Buffy was unaware that a vampire was hiding in a photo booth right next to her. The movie, however, is not considered canon, and this aspect of her powers was not carried over to the series.

====Dreams====
All Slayers through the ages share a psychic link, manifested in dreams. A Slayer will frequently dream of herself as a Slayer in another time and place. These dreams are usually vague, but can also be prophetic. Dreams exist in their own mystic plane or &quot;dreamscape&quot; where for a Slayer, precognitive sense and the inherited memories of other Slayers can manifest themselves. Also, Slayers have been shown to appear in each other&#x27;s dreams, and Buffy and Faith shared several dreams while Faith was in a coma. Faith provided the first cryptic reference to Dawn Summers&#x27; arrival.

Melaka Fray, the Slayer of the far future, lacks these abilities. Due to the unusual nature of their birth, her twin brother received these visions instead.

====Other abilities====
While a regular person may require eight to ten hours sleep, a Slayer seems to require considerably less but needs some rest to function. Buffy herself has been seen as staying awake for days although she will usually &quot;crash&quot; and sleep for half a day and show no lingering disabilities. A Slayer naturally has formidable fighting skills. Buffy is shown to easily fend off multiple vampires at the same time while under a memory loss spell, with no memory of her combat training—relying entirely on her natural Slayer instincts, presumably indicating an instinctual grasp of fighting. Dana is seen holding her own against Spike without having any previous combat training. It is also shown that Potential Slayers have innate skills in combat, even before being called, as Amanda was able to defeat a vampire without any previous combat training in &quot;Potential&quot;. The Slayer&#x27;s Watcher trains her to hone these talents, and to teach her specific fighting skills, such as various martial arts. The training helps her to battle the occasional demon whose physical strength outclasses her own. For most situations, however, her strength suffices. To test a Slayer&#x27;s natural ingenuity and practical capability, the Watcher&#x27;s Council administers a test known as &quot;the Cruciamentum&quot; if/when they turn eighteen, which strips the Slayer of her powers and forces her to fight a powerful vampire without them (&quot;Helpless&quot;). The compound used to weaken the Slayer makes her typically weaker than most normal humans. This renders a Slayer who would still normally be physically fit without her powers remarkably feeble even for a human. This forces the Slayer to rely solely on her intellect and wit, which Buffy proves to have. She killed an insane vampire called Kralik by using his weakest point against him—his medication (without which he suffers extraordinary pain). When he rushes to take his pills, he searches for a glass of water. After drinking it, he realizes that Buffy had filled the glass with Holy Water.

There is some evidence to indicate that The Slayer might possess some supernatural influence or presence over others. Part of the role of the Slayer is being a leader and deciding the appropriate course of action to be taken. In the course of the entire timeline, The Slayer has always instantly been acknowledged as the leader and the final decision maker, superseding even that of the Watchers. This is touched on in the episode &quot;Chosen&quot;, with Faith and Buffy hypothesizing that one of the major reasons they don&#x27;t get along is that there should only be one. This could also be the major reason why Slayers went rogue and constantly struggled for sole leadership of the Slayer Army in Season Eight and the Potential Slayers kept questioning both Faith and Buffy&#x27;s judgement in Season Seven. Further evidence of this phenomenon is found with Melaka Fray, the Slayer of the future, and her vampire brother. She possesses all the strength and physical abilities, but everyone dismisses her and no one takes her seriously, though her brother, who possesses all of her non-physical abilities, was instantly accepted as a leader among his peers, despite him being newly sired and inexperienced.

Overall, the Slayer&#x27;s abilities seem to be enhancements of normal human attributes, rather than extra abilities garnered from a magical source; Buffy trains constantly and works out to enhance and maintain her abilities, suggesting that they would atrophy otherwise. A &quot;normal&quot; workout routine that would enhance a regular human&#x27;s strength and speed increases her abilities much faster and at greater magnitude. Also, the concoction created in the Season Three episode &quot;Helpless&quot; (which Giles says includes muscle relaxants and adrenal inhibitors) would have the same effects on a normal human as they did on Buffy; the effects are simply more pronounced. Also, regular illnesses such as the flu were shown to have effects on the Slayer not greatly different from its effects on humans; once again the handicap is more noticeable given the Slayer&#x27;s usually enhanced abilities, though it was nonetheless proven to be enough that it nearly cost Buffy her life while fighting Angelus.

Recently in &quot;Season Eight&quot;, Buffy has gained a multitude of new powers: her strength, speed, agility, and reflexes have been greatly enhanced, and she has also developed telescopic vision, superhuman hearing, flight, and a level of invulnerability. Willow initially theorizes that these powers are a result of Buffy unwittingly absorbing the collective powers of all of the Slayers who have died since their organization began, but Angel later claims that they are in fact a reward because of the fulfillment of her destiny and involvement with the coming of a new reality.

===Weapons and equipment===
Slayers typically use weapons to fight vampires and other demons. Simple wooden stakes, crucifixes, and holy water are commonly used due to their effectiveness against vampires. Swords, axes, and knives are the most common implements used for dispatching demons, though other melee weapons (generally of medieval European design) are also used. Ranged weaponry is usually confined to crossbows. On occasion, more sophisticated weaponry is used; Buffy Summers has used a military-issue rocket launcher to defeat a particularly tough demon. The Slayer Melaka Fray uses weaponry native to her time period, such as rayguns, as well as traditional Slayer weapons. Buffy has a personal dislike for firearms, and has made it a rule that no Slayer in her group use them. On the other hand, the rogue Slayer Simone Doffler and her criminal gang are enamoured of guns.

====Scythe====
The Scythe is a weapon resembling a metal lochaber axe with a wooden stake and a flanged mace head built into the handle. Due to its design, the Scythe can be used as an axe, sword or spear, depending on the fighting style of its wielder. The Scythe exhibits some mystical properties. A Slayer who picks it up recognizes it as a source of power, and has an instinctive sense of ownership of the weapon. When Buffy showed the Scythe to Faith, she said that she &quot;felt like it belongs to me&quot;, but immediately surrenders it to Buffy, saying that it was hers because she was a Slayer first. When Buffy discovers the weapon, she tracks its lineage to a mysterious woman who explains its origin. Centuries ago, a group of women known as the Guardians forged the Scythe for the Slayer. The Guardians kept the weapon a secret from the Shadow Men, and later the Watchers. The Scythe was used to kill the last pure demon on Earth in what would later become Sunnydale, California. It was lost after that, until discovered by Buffy embedded in stone. Willow Rosenberg is soon after able to harness the Scythe&#x27;s mystical essence and activate every Potential Slayer in the world.

The Scythe is seen 200 years later in the hands of the demon Urkonn, who passes the weapon on to Melaka Fray. Melaka Fray did not seem to sense anything in particular upon wielding the Scythe for the first time, likely because she is cut off from the slayer&#x27;s psychic abilities. It is during Fray&#x27;s time as Slayer that the Scythe was destroyed; during a confrontation with a time-displaced Buffy Summers, the latter smashed it clean in two with a backhanded punch.

====Slayer Emergency Kit====
The &quot;emergency kit&quot; is a bag found in the possession of Robin Wood. It was given to him by his mother Nikki Wood. When he gave it to Buffy, he claimed that it was a &quot;Slayer heirloom&quot; that should have been passed down to the next Slayer, but he kept it instead, presumably because he did not have much by which to remember her. It is unknown how long this had been passed down, and has not been mentioned by any other Slayers, but it is assumed to be quite old considering its contents. At the time Buffy received it, it was in a brown leather bag, and contained several objects, including a boomerang, a vase, a locked box containing shadow casters, and a mystical book written in Sumerian.

The shadow casters are placed onto the smaller circular metal piece in front of a light, creating shadow images on the wall, and the book is then read to tell the story. The book will then translate itself, possibly into English, or perhaps into whatever the reader&#x27;s language might be. The shadows cast by the metal figures will then become enchanted themselves and begin to move on their own, recreating the story of the First Slayer. A portal is then created, allowing the Slayer to speak directly to the Shadow Men that created the First Slayer, but &quot;exchanging&quot; the Slayer for a particularly powerful demon, releasing the demon onto Earth through the same portal. The Slayer can then gain more power through the Shadow Men if she is willing, but only through taking in more of the essence of the demon which gave the Slayer her powers in the first place. The only apparent way to bring the Slayer back to Earth is to bring the released demon back to the site of the portal.

The text translated from the book is as follows. &quot;First there is the Earth. Then, there came the Demons. After Demons, there came men. Men found a girl. And the men took the girl to slay demons. They chained her to the Earth. Filled her with Dark. You cannot be shown. You cannot just watch, but you must see. See for yourself, but only if you&#x27;re willing to make the exchange. This is the only way. There is no...&quot; The page then ends, and it&#x27;s unknown what comes next.

<doc id="870054" wikidata="Q922258" url="?curid=870054" title="Megas XLR">
<text>Megas XLR is an American animated television series created by Jody Schaeffer and George Krstic for Cartoon Network. The series revolves around two slackers: mechanic Coop and his best friend Jamie, who find a mecha robot from the future called MEGAS (&quot;Mechanized Earth Guard Attack System&quot;) in a Jersey City, New Jersey junkyard. Coop modifies Megas and replaces his head, the control center, with a classic muscle car, and names him XLR (&quot;eXtra Large Robot&quot;). Together with Megas&#x27;s original pilot Kiva, they must defend Earth from the evil alien race called &quot;the Glorft&quot;. The series is an homage and parody of mecha anime. Krstic was originally one of the co-creators of MTV&#x27;s &quot;Downtown&quot;.

Schaeffer and Krstic conceived the idea of an animated series where the main character would pilot a giant robot utilizing his video gaming skills. The pilot episode, &quot;LowBrow&quot;, was shown in 2002 during Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Cartoon Cartoon Weekend Summerfest&quot;, to determine which pilot would become a new Cartoon Cartoon; it was the most popular among viewers. It aired on the Toonami block from May 1, 2004, to January 15, 2005, for two seasons (totaling 26 episodes), before being cancelled due to low ratings.

Despite low ratings, the series was met with positive reception, and was ranked at No. 4 on ToonZone&#x27;s &quot;Toons of the 2000s: Top 5 Cartoon Network Originals&quot;. There have been various fan efforts and petitions to revive the show since its cancellation.

&quot;Megas XLR&quot; was produced by Cartoon Network Studios; Titmouse, Inc. animated the main title and did animation work on Season 1.

==Overview==
In the year 3037, Earth is fighting a losing war against the Glorft, a hostile alien race led by Gorrath (Clancy Brown). In a last, desperate attempt to save the planet, the human resistance steals a prototype mecha robot from the Glorft and modifies it into a powerful war machine, renaming it Megas (&quot;Mechanized Earth Guard Attack System&quot;). Their plan is to use a time-traveling device called a time drive to send Megas and its assigned pilot, Kiva Andru (Wendee Lee), two years into the past to the Battle of the Last Stand, which was the last major offensive fought by humanity against the Glorft. Humanity lost that battle, but the members of the resistance, particularly Kiva, believe that Megas can tip the scales and hand the Glorft a decisive defeat.

Before the plan can be executed, however, an attack by the Glorft forces the human resistance to send Megas back in time before proper preparations are made. Megas&#x27; head is blown off in the attack and its time drive is damaged, and the crippled robot is inadvertently sent to a junkyard in 1930s Jersey City, New Jersey. It remains there until a slacker mechanic named Harold &quot;Coop&quot; Cooplowski (David DeLuise) discovers it in approximately the year 2004. Coop turns Megas into a hot rod project by giving it a flaming paint job, replacing its head with a classic muscle car (resembling a car from the &#x27;70s MOPAR family; most likely a Plymouth Barracuda) and adding XLR (&quot;eXtra Large Robot&quot;) to its name.

While Coop is showing off the robot to his best friend Jamie (Steve Blum), Kiva travels to the 21st century to retrieve Megas and, upon discovering that only Coop can now pilot the robot due to his modifications to it, grudgingly agrees to train him in its use. However, Gorrath has followed her through time, forcing Kiva, Coop, and Jamie to team up and defend Earth against both Gorrath&#x27;s forces and various other threats.

==Production==

=== Development ===
While playing video games, Schaeffer and Krstic came up with an idea of making an animated series in which the main character would use his video gaming skills to pilot a giant robot. The pilot short (&quot;LowBrow&quot;) was shown in 2002 as part of Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Cartoon Cartoon Weekend Summerfest&quot;, a contest to determine which pilot would be selected as the next Cartoon Cartoon. It was the most popular among viewers, and was greenlit as a series.

Much of the series is inspired by Japanese mecha anime which the two grew up watching, with the animation being inspired by both anime and Western animation. The humour often pays homage or mocks anime conventions.

== Broadcast ==

=== Release ===
After being delayed from its original debut in December 2003, &quot;Megas XLR&quot; finally debuted on the Toonami block on May 1, 2004. However, due to low ratings, the series was cancelled after two seasons, with the final episode airing on January 15, 2005.

Reruns continued to air sporadically from January 16, 2005, to September 24, 2005. During this time, the series was later moved to the graveyard slot of 3:30am on Friday nights/Saturday mornings, before being removed from the network altogether.

=== Streaming services ===
The entire series is available at the iTunes Store, Apple TV+ and on Xbox Video.

==Future==
===Possible revival===
In late 2012, fans of the show on Twitter started using the hashtag #BringBackMegasXLR. The co-creator George Krstic and director Chris Prynoski announced they would bring back the show; seeing as &quot;Megas XLR&quot; had been written off by Cartoon Network, the studio Titmouse, Inc. would have to get the rights to the show. On April 29, 2013, George Krstic posted a tweet saying that he and Chris Prynoski were having a meeting at Titmouse to discuss bringing back the show along with &quot;Motorcity&quot;. However, in a 2014 interview George Krstic was quoted as saying: &quot;&quot;Megas&quot; was written off as a tax loss and as such can not be exploited, at least domestically, in any way, or the network will get into some sort of tax/legal trouble.&quot; Because the show was used as a tax write-off the network would have to pay back the taxes they received from it and face large fines. It could also open the network up to tax fraud investigation. As of 8 February 2019, Krstic has stated that the rights to the series had successfully transferred ownership to Warner Brothers, though at this point it&#x27;s too early and uncertain to tell what it could mean for the show&#x27;s future.

===Potential video game===
In December 2012, a series of messages were posted on Twitter by series director Chris Prynoski, hinting at production of a video game based on the series with Valve. No official comment on the project has yet been made by Valve or Cartoon Network. However, in 2015 Chris Prynoski mentioned on Twitter that he had been unable to sort out the licensing needed.

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
The series was well received. In a retrospective analysis of Dave Trumbore from Collider said &quot;It&#x27;s actually a really funny and well-done series, but also because a listener (MrJake!) called in to recommend it; our cartoon lawyers say we&#x27;re legally obligated to cover it. Just happy it&#x27;s a good toon this time!&quot;.

Roy from Cinemahub.com gave the show 3.5 rating out of 5 (Great) and wrote &quot;While it’s still hilarious and fun to watch, its action scenes fall short in comparison to present-day animated series.&quot;

Noah Dominguez of CBR.com said &quot;It&#x27;s clear the creative team behind &quot;Megas XLR&quot; had a lot of fun making it. As such, the fans had a lot of fun watching it. Its over-the-top premise and delightfully self-aware humor were complemented nicely by the dynamic between Coop, Jamie and Kiva. Coop is the slacker who&#x27;s actually fairly capable despite himself, Jamie offers comic relief and Kiva is the straight man who also has a nice fish-out-of-water angle to work with. Plus, let&#x27;s not forget that the show had an absolute banger of a theme song in Ragtime Revolutionaries&#x27; &quot;Chicks Dig Giant Robots.&quot;

<text>In the hydrocarbon industry water contact is the elevation above which fluids other than water can be found in the pores of a rock.

For example, in a traditional hand-excavated water well, the level at which the water stabilizes represents the water table, or the elevation in the rock where air starts to occupy the rock pores.

In most situations in the hydrocarbon industry the term is qualified as being an oil-water contact (abbreviated to &quot;OWC&quot;) or a gas-water contact (&quot;GWC&quot;). Often there is also a gas-oil contact (&quot;GOC&quot;).

In an oil or gas field, hydrocarbons migrate into rocks and can be trapped if there is a permeability barrier to prevent upward escape. Gas and oil are lighter than water, so they will form a bubble at the high end of the &quot;trap&quot; formed by the impermeable barriers. A simple physical model of this would be a coffee cup held upside down underwater with an air bubble occupying the highest portion of the cup&#x27;s interior. The base of the bubble is the water contact.

Capillary action can obscure the true water contact in permeable media like sandstone. Capillary pressure prevents the hydrocarbons from expelling all of the water in the pores, which creates a transition zone between the fully saturated hydrocarbon levels and the fully saturated water levels.

In poorly porous intervals, the oil-water, gas-water or gas-oil contacts can similarly be obscured, which makes estimation of hydrocarbon reserves difficult. Descriptions of the well&#x27;s petrophysics will then often further qualify to delineate a gas-down-to, oil-up-to, oil-down-to and water-up-to line, clearly showing the uncertainties involved.

<text>Frank Manning (May 26, 1914 – April 27, 2009) was an American dancer, instructor, and choreographer. Manning is considered one of the founders of Lindy Hop, an energetic form of the jazz dance style known as swing.

==Biography==

Manning was born in 1914 in Jacksonville, Florida. After his parents separated when he was three years old, he moved to Harlem with his mother, who was a dancer.

Manning began dancing as a child. Manning&#x27;s mother sent him to spend summers with his father, aunt, and grandmother on their farm in Aiken, South Carolina. On Saturdays, farmhands and locals would come to the farm to play music on the front porch with harmonicas and a washtub bass. Manning&#x27;s grandmother encouraged Frankie to dance with the others.

In October 1927, Manning attended the Renaissance Ballroom &amp; Casino. Watching from the balcony, he saw his mother dancing formal ballroom styles such as the foxtrot and waltz, having only seen her dance before in a much looser and casual style at neighborhood rent parties. Manning started listening to records on a Victrola in his bedroom and would practice dancing with a broom or a chair. When he was older, he started going to Harlem&#x27;s Savoy Ballroom, the only integrated ballroom in New York. He frequented the Savoy in the 1930s, eventually becoming a dancer in the elite and prestigious &quot;Kat&#x27;s Corner,&quot; a corner of the dance floor where impromptu exhibitions and competitions took place. During a dance contest in 1935, Manning and his partner, Frieda Washington, performed the first aerial in a swing dance competition against George Snowden, the inventor of the term Lindy Hop, and his partner, Big Bea. The air step he performed was a &quot;back-to-back roll&quot; and was danced while Chick Webb played &quot;Down South Camp Meeting&quot; at Manning&#x27;s request.

===Career===
In 1935, Herbert White organized the top Lindy Hop dancers at the Savoy Ballroom into a professional performance group that was eventually named Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers. Manning created the troupe&#x27;s first ensemble routines and functioned as the group&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; choreographer, although he was never officially credited with that title. The troupe toured extensively and made several films. While with Whitey&#x27;s, Manning danced with Norma Miller, who became known as the Queen of Swing. Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers disbanded around World War II when many of the male dancers entered the armed forces. Manning himself served in the U.S. Army. In 1947, after the war, Manning formed a four-person dance group called the Congaroos. Across England and South America the group performed, also making an appearance in the 1948 film Killer Diller. When the Congaroos disbanded in 1955, Manning quietly settles into a career with the United States Postal Service.

===Return to Lindy Hop===
In 1982, Al Minns, a former member of Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers, started to teach Lindy Hop at the Sandra Cameron Dance Center. Before he died in 1985, he told his students that Manning, another surviving member of Whitey&#x27;s Lindy Hoppers, also lived in New York City.

In 1986, dancers Erin Stevens and Steven Mitchell contacted Manning and asked him to teach them the Lindy Hop. Mitchell and Stevens returned to California and helped to spread Lindy Hop to the West Coast and other areas of the U.S. That same year, Lennart Westerlund contacted Manning and invited him to Sweden to work with The Rhythm Hot Shots. Manning traveled to Sweden in 1987 and returned there every year from 1989 onward to teach at the Herräng Dance Camp. Later, Manning would also teach Ryan Francois, who would help introduce Lindy Hop to a British audience.

===Later years===
Once the swing dance and Lindy Hop revival took hold during the late 1980s, Manning taught Lindy Hop around the world, occasionally appearing with Norma Miller. Sometimes, dance workshops returned him to places he had not been in decades. For example, Manning first visited Melbourne, Australia in 1939 to perform at the Princess Theatre. The swing revival and Melbourne&#x27;s Swing Patrol brought him back again in 2002; it was his first visit to Melbourne in 63 years.

At age 75, Manning co-choreographed the Broadway musical &quot;Black and Blue&quot;, for which he received a 1989 Tony Award. In 2000, he was a recipient of a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States&#x27; highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.

Manning&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Frankie Manning: Ambassador of Lindy Hop&quot;, written with co-author Cynthia R. Millman, was published by Temple University Press in May 2007.

Manning&#x27;s annual birthday celebrations attracted dancers and instructors from all over the world. His 80th birthday, in 1994, was commemorated by a weekend-long celebration in New York City; his 85th culminated in a sold-out party at New York&#x27;s Roseland Ballroom, where a pair of his dance shoes were placed in a showcase along with those of dancers such as Fred Astaire. Dedicated cruises were organized for his 89th and 90th birthdays; for his birthday dances, Manning followed his custom of dancing with one woman for every year of his life. He continued this custom through his 94th birthday.

===Death===
A resident of Corona, Queens, Manning died in Manhattan on April 27, 2009, aged 94.

He is interred in the Hillcrest Plot at Woodlawn Cemetery in Bronx, New York.

==Legacy==

===Frankie Manning Foundation===
Manning died one month before his 95th birthday. His planned birthday celebration was recast as Frankie 95, a celebration of Manning&#x27;s life, and drew more than 2,000 people from 33 countries. Proceeds from the five-day Frankie 95 celebration were used to create the Frankie Manning Foundation. Its mission is to spread Lindy Hop throughout the world.

===Accolades===
Frankie 100 took place in New York City from May 22 to 26, 2014. The event was described as the largest swing dance event of modern era and brought together over 2,000 dancers from 47 countries to honor Frankie Manning and to name his birthday, May 26, as World Lindy Hop Day.

Manning was inducted into the National Museum of Dance and Hall of Fame in 2009. He was inducted into the U.S. Swing Dance Council (now World Swing Dance Council) Hall of Fame in 1992.

On July 4, 2012, a road in the village of Herräng, Sweden, was named after Manning, as a gift from the municipality of Norrtälje for the 30-year jubilee of Herräng Dance Camp.

On May 26, 2016, Google celebrated his 102nd birthday with a Google Doodle.

<text>Supergrass Is 10 is a compilation album celebrating the first 10 years of the band Supergrass. It includes singles from their first release, &quot;Caught by the Fuzz&quot; (1994), to their then latest release, &quot;Kiss of Life&quot; (2004).

The compilation was released on CD, DVD and double 10&quot; clear vinyl record. The DVD release contains two discs. The first disc is a documentary of the band&#x27;s first 10 years. The second disc contains videos of all of the singles (with the exception of &quot;Cheapskate&quot;) with the option of director&#x27;s commentary and karaoke lyrics. The song compilation managed to reach No. 4 in the UK charts.

In the US, the CD version came with a bonus live CD featuring 12 live and acoustic songs.

John Cornfield recorded and mixed the two new tracks featured on the album at Sphere Studios.

&quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper said of the DVD compilation, &quot;Once you&#x27;ve sat through the in-depth, career-spanning documentary on disc one, it&#x27;s hard to come to any conclusion other than being Supergrass is probably the most joyful job in the world.&quot;

<text>The MTV Europe Music Awards (originally named MTV European Music Awards, commonly abbreviated as MTV EMA) are awards presented by Paramount International Networks to honour artists and music in pop culture. It was originally conceived as an alternative to the MTV Video Music Awards, which are hosted annually in the United States. The Europe Music Awards are held every year in a different country; it has been hosted mostly in the United Kingdom and Germany. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest.

The awards are a reflection of the international and continental music scene. They are representative of geographical origin and of achievement in diverse musical genres and disciplines, indicative of the diversity and scope of the show. Since the 2007 ceremony, viewers are able to vote for their favourite artists in all general categories by visiting MTV&#x27;s website.

The 1st Europe Music Awards ceremony was held in 1994 at Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, Germany, five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The annual ceremony broadcast live on MTV Europe, Channel 5 and most of the international MTV channels as well as online.

==Notable moments==

===1990s===
====1994–1999====
1994: The first Europe Music Awards took place in Berlin, Germany, at the Brandenburg Gate and were held on 24 November 1994, five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Hosted by Tom Jones, the show featured performances by Aerosmith, Ace of Base, Björk, Roxette, Take That and George Michael, who performed &quot;Jesus to a Child&quot; and &quot;Freedom&quot; surrounded by many famous models including Naomi Campbell. Presenters included East 17, Jean Paul Gaultier, Pamela Anderson and Helena Christensen, who kissed INXS&#x27;s Michael Hutchence live on stage. Bono received the Free Your Mind Award on behalf of Amnesty International.

1995: French nuclear testing in the South Pacific got the most attention at the 1995 ceremony. During his acceptance speech after winning the award for Best Rock, Bon Jovi lead singer Jon Bon Jovi stated, &quot;The only enemy is ignorance. Peace, people. Let&#x27;s get rid of all this nuclear testing&quot;, while U2&#x27;s Bono said, &quot;What a city, what a night, what a crowd, what a bomb, what a mistake, what a wanker you have for a President.&quot; referring to nuclear testing. Greenpeace, the environmental group that has staged creative and controversial protests around the testing site at Mururoa Atoll, took the Free Your Mind award for its campaign against the underground nuclear blasts. &quot;Stop abusing the Earth,&quot; urged Madonna in a videotaped segment before designer agnès b. picked up the award for Greenpeace.
1996: During their performance Metallica performed the songs &quot;Last Caress&quot; and &quot;So What?&quot; instead of performing their single &quot;King Nothing&quot; as scheduled. The MTV executives told the band that they weren&#x27;t allowed to use any curse words during their time on live TV, and upset with the scripted, family-friendly MTV antics, Metallica simply played non-TV friendly songs. The song &quot;So What?&quot; is known for its amount of expletives and references to bestiality among many other controversial lyrics while &quot;Last Caress&quot; has lyrics pertaining to murder and rape. As a result of their performance Metallica&#x27;s performance and references to Metallica have been removed from future broadcasts of the ceremony.

1997: U2 opened the show performing &quot;Mofo&quot; dressed in boxing gowns. The Prodigy were the big winners of the night, receiving three awards including Best Video. Björk became the first artist to be nominated in the category of Best Female for four consecutive years. The Landmine Survivors Network received the Free Your Mind Award for helping survivors to recover from war, rebuild their communities, and break cycles of violence.

1998: Six new categories were introduced that year, including the MTV Selects; UK &amp; Ireland, Northern, Central and Southern. Faithless opened the show with &quot;God is a DJ&quot; and Madonna performed &quot;The Power of Goodbye&quot;. The big winner of the night were the Spice Girls and Madonna with two awards each. Melanie C and Emma Bunton collected the trophy on behalf of the group. On receiving the award, Mel C shouted, &quot;We&#x27;ve done it again. And a big hello from the other two&quot;, referring to Mel B and Victoria Adams, both of whom were pregnant and did not attend the ceremony. The Prodigy won Best Dance but according to their frontman, Liam Howlett, they had not done anything to deserve the accolade that year.

1999: Britney Spears was the big winner of the night winning four awards, including Best New Act and Best Song for &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;. She also performed during the ceremony, entertaining the crowd with a medley of her songs &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; and &quot;(You Drive Me) Crazy&quot;. The Free Your Mind Award, which honours an individual or organisation for aiding in humanitarian efforts and fighting prejudice, was given to Bono for his world peace work. Puff Daddy performed &quot;My Best Friend&quot; backed by a full gospel choir, followed by Iggy Pop, who stagedived into the crowd during the track &quot;Lust for Life&quot;. Whitney Houston sang a medley of &quot;Get It Back&quot; and &quot;My Love Is Your Love&quot;, while Mariah Carey performed &quot;Heartbreaker&quot;. Marilyn Manson, who wore nothing but a G-string, closed the show with a performance of &quot;Rock Is Dead&quot;.

===2000s===
====2000–2004====
2000: The show was hosted by Fugees&#x27;s Wyclef Jean, who presented a variety of stars and outfits, including one consisting of boxer shorts only, after he jumped into the crowd and had his red leather suit ripped from him. The performance of the Spice Girls during the ceremony was the last before their breakup. The most elaborate appearance was probably by Jennifer Lopez, who literally landed on stage in an aeroplane. The performance was a world premiere of her new song, &quot;Love Don&#x27;t Cost a Thing&quot;, taken from her forthcoming album, &quot;J.Lo&quot;. Madonna paid tribute to fellow performer Kylie Minogue by appearing on stage in a T-shirt bearing the name &quot;Kylie&quot;. Madonna performed Music (Madonna song), one month after giving birth to son, Rocco, with a screen background of clips reminiscent of her long career. Sacha Baron Cohen made his career debut during the ceremony whilst introducing Madonna.

Political issues were present as well during the night, with Nick Carter from Backstreet Boys speaking against a recount of votes in the U.S. presidential election. Robbie Williams won Best Song for &quot;Rock DJ&quot;, but he told the audience: &quot;I am not going to say anything bad about people&#x27;s choices on this one, but I think it&#x27;s a terrible song and a silly song.&quot; He also referred to his roots in Stoke-on-Trent, saying: &quot;When I was growing up I dreamt of being a pop star and I would like to thank MTV for my three houses, my five cars and my supermodel girlfriend.&quot;
2001: The ceremony was the first entertainment broadcasts following the September 11th attacks in New York City. When Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett from Gorillaz walked onto stage to make a speech, Albarn sported a T-shirt with the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament logo on it. Albarn, in a response to the recent invasion of Afghanistan said &quot;So, fuck the music. Listen. See this symbol here, [pointing to the tee shirt] this the symbol for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament. Bombing one of the poorest countries in the world is wrong. You&#x27;ve got a voice and you have got to do what you can about it allright?&quot; Fred Durst took the stage with Wes Scantlin and Jimmy Page to perform the classic Led Zeppelin&#x27;s song &quot;Thank You&quot;.

2002: One of the highlights was the offer made by host Puff Daddy giving away a lush ring to the first woman to undress on stage. A lady took the stage take off her clothes and won the ring. When Moby came on stage to collect the award for Best Website he wished the best wishes to Eminem, showing that he bore no grudge after the confrontation on the 2002 MTV Video Music Awards. Robbie Williams and Whitney Houston performed their songs &quot;Feel&quot; and &quot;Whatchulookinat&quot; for the first time ever. Enrique Iglesias performed an acoustic version of his single &quot;Maybe&quot; and then a rock version of the track &quot;Love to See You Cry&quot; done to the music of Billy Idol&#x27;s &quot;White Wedding&quot;.

2003: During the pre-show, Christina Aguilera refused to walk the red carpet if Kelly Osbourne, a guest VJ for the event, was present. Kelly responded by calling Aguilera&#x27;s music &quot;crap&quot; and saying she was a &quot;cow.&quot; Later, a skit was aired of Christina Aguilera throwing darts at a board decorated with a picture of Kelly Osbourne. This irked the Ozzy offspring, who voiced her disapproval when she came onstage to present an award. Kelly stated, &quot;If Christina Aguilera has to resort to throwing darts at my head after everything she&#x27;s achieved and everything she&#x27;s done, then she&#x27;s a really sad, sorry person&quot;. Aguilera later retorted with a voice of mock sympathy, saying &quot;Honey, if you can dish it out, you&#x27;ve got to learn how to take it back&quot;.

During Travis&#x27; performance of &quot;The Beautiful Occupation&quot; an assembly of nude protesters marched onstage with signs that covered their private areas. At the end of the song, they lifted the signs. While near at the end of performing &quot;Baby Boy&quot;, Beyoncé and Sean Paul both were up on stage when their backing track suffered a technical difficulty. This went on for a near minute in which both artist and dancers exited the stage while the error went on. This also left confusion among presenter Christina Aguilera, who walked on stage to continue hosting which ended the backing track error. Both artists later decided to retake the performance again. The retake would later replace re-airings of the show and would be the first show to extend time with this retake.

2004: The show was held at Tor di Valle Racecourse in Rome. The outdoor stage was situated in front of the Colosseum, where artists such as Eminem, Franz Ferdinand, Beastie Boys, and Anastacia performed to an attendance of over 400,000 people. Outkast received both Best Song and Best Video for their track &quot;Hey Ya!&quot;. Other multiple winners include Usher and Muse with two awards each. Presenters on the night included Jamelia, Alicia Keys, N.E.R.D, Naomi Campbell, Andre 3000, Kid Rock and Kanye West.

====2005–2009====
2005 : Madonna opened the show in a giant disco ball performing &quot;Hung Up&quot;. Sacha Baron Cohen hosted the ceremony as Borat Sagdiyev, who greeted the audience by saying &quot;Welcome to the 2005 Eurovision Song Contest&quot; and referring to Madonna, he stated, &quot;It was very courageous of MTV to start the show with a genuine transvestite&quot;. 
Gorillaz used hologram-style technology to beam three-dimensional performing cartoon characters on stage. Madonna returned to the stage to present the Free Your Mind Award to Bob Geldof. &quot;You drive me crazy, but tonight you are everyone&#x27;s hero,&quot; she said. He replied: &quot;This means much more to me than many of the other things that are given to me&quot;.
2006: The 13th Europe Music Awards was hosted by Justin Timberlake, who received Best Male and Best Pop. Timberlake joked that he only won because he agreed to present the event in Copenhagen. Depeche Mode said, &quot;A big thank you to the fans and a big thank you to MTV for playing our videos for twenty-five years&quot;, after winning the award for Best Group. British comedian Sacha Baron Cohen entertained the audience with his English-mangling character Borat and poked fun at Madonna who was at the time trying to adopt an African child adding: &quot;My only concern is that this singing transvestite will not be such a good father.&quot;

Despite winning the award for Best Hip-Hop, Kanye West apparently was so disappointed at not winning for Best Video that he crashed the stage when the award was being presented to Justice and Simian for &quot;We Are Your Friends&quot;. In a tirade riddled with expletives, Kanye West said he should have won the prize for his video &quot;Touch the Sky&quot;, because it &quot;cost a million dollars, Pamela Anderson was in it. I was jumping across canyons.&quot; He further said, &quot;If I don&#x27;t win, the awards show loses credibility&quot;.

The show received a total of 78 million votes, the most in Europe Music Awards history.

She did not attend the show but recorded a couple videos thanking her fans. Paul McCartney was awarded with the Ultimate Legend given by Bono. After picking up his honour, Sir Paul settled for thanking friends, family and bandmates Ringo Starr, George Harrison and John Lennon. &quot;Many years ago, four little boys were born here in Liverpool and we went on to do quite well,&quot; he added. &quot;So thanks, as I say, to all my family, to all of you for coming along, everyone in Liverpool, everyone in Britain, everyone in America – for voting in Mr Obama. I love you!&quot;

The show contained numerous references to Barack Obama, most notably when Kanye West and Estelle finished their song &quot;American Boy&quot; with the US President-elect&#x27;s face projected onto a giant screen behind them. Jared Leto, Shannon Leto and Tomo Miličević from Thirty Seconds to Mars wore Obama T-shirts, and Jared Leto also asked the crowd to stand in honour of the Democratic senator.

<doc id="870072" wikidata="Q15647248" url="?curid=870072" title="Coxswain">
<text>The coxswain ( , or ) is the person in charge of a boat, particularly its navigation and steering. The etymology of the word gives a literal meaning of &quot;boat servant&quot; since it comes from &quot;cock&quot;, referring to the , a type of ship&#x27;s boat, and &quot;swain&quot;, an Old English term derived from the Old Norse &quot;sveinn&quot; meaning boy or servant. In 1724, a &quot;cockswain&quot; was defined as &quot;An officer of a ship who takes care of the cockboat, barge or shallop, with all its furniture, and is in readiness with his crew to man the boat on all occasions.&quot; When the term &quot;cockboat&quot; became obsolete, the title of coxswain as the person in charge of a ship&#x27;s boat remained.

== Rowing ==
In rowing, the coxswain sits in either the bow or the stern of the boat (depending on the type of boat) while verbally and physically controlling the boat&#x27;s steering, speed, timing and fluidity. The primary duty of a coxswain is to ensure the safety of those in the boat. In a race setting, the coxswain is tasked with motivating the crew as well as steering as straight a course as possible to minimize the distance to the finish line. Coxswains are also responsible for knowing proper rowing technique and running drills to improve technique.

A coxswain is the coach in the boat: in addition to following the orders of the team coach, the coxswain is connected to the way the boat feels, what&#x27;s working, what needs to be changed, and how. A successful coxswain must keep track of the drill, time, pace, words of the coach, feel of the boat, direction of the boat, and safety. During a race, a coxswain is responsible for steering, calling the moves, and responding to the way the other boats are moving. Success depends on the physical and mental strength of the rowers, ability to respond to the environment, and the way in which the coxswain motivates the rowers, not only as individuals but as members of the crew.

== Royal Navy ==

In the Royal Navy in the days of sail, the coxswain was a petty officer or chief petty officer who commanded the barge of a captain or admiral. Later the coxswain was the senior deck petty officer or chief petty officer aboard a smaller vessel such as a corvette or submarine, who was responsible for the steering. On smaller vessels, the coxswain assumed the duties that would be performed by the chief boatswain&#x27;s mate and master-at-arms aboard larger vessels.

In World War I, the term was also used to refer to a chief petty officer who was in charge of steering airships operated by the Royal Naval Air Service.

In World War II pilots of landing craft were referred to as coxswains.

In the Royal Canadian Navy, the appointment of coxswain (or &quot;capitaine d&#x27;armes&quot; in French) is given to the senior non-commissioned officer aboard a ship, the equivalent to a command master chief petty officer in the US Navy. For larger vessels such as a destroyer, frigate or the ships (AOPVs), a coxswain holds the rank of chief petty officer 1st class (CPO1). For submarines, a coxswain holds the rank of chief petty officer 2nd class (CPO2). For , a coxswain usually holds the rank of petty officer 1st class (PO1) or CPO2.

The term was also sometimes used aboard merchant ships for the senior petty officer in charge of the helm. The fictional Israel Hands, for example, was the coxswain of &quot;Hispaniola&quot; in &quot;Treasure Island&quot;.

== Naval cadets ==

In Royal Navy Sections of the Combined Cadet Force, the rank of Cadet Coxswain is the highest that a cadet can achieve, except in the rare occurrence that they are promoted to the rank of Cadet Under Officer. The rank of Coxswain equates to the rank of Cadet Warrant Officer in the Royal Air Force Sections, and the rank of Cadet Regimental Sergeant Major in the Army Sections.

In the Royal Canadian Sea Cadets, the position of Coxswain is often appointed to the cadet with the rank of Cadet Chief Petty Officer First Class (C/CPO1). This would be the equivalent of the position of Regimental Sergeant Major in the Royal Canadian Army Cadets held by a Cadet Chief Warrant Officer (C/CWO), or Squadron Warrant Officer in the Royal Canadian Air Cadets held by a Cadet Warrant Officer 1st Class (C/WO1).

==United States Coast Guard==
In the United States Coast Guard and United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, the coxswain is the person in charge of a small boat. The coxswain has the authority to direct all boat and crew activities during the mission and modify planned missions to provide for the safety of the boat and the crew.

Before a person can be assigned to be a coxswain, they have to go through a qualification procedure, be certified and maintain the certification to be a coxswain. Upon certification, they are awarded the Coxswain Badge. This qualification procedure requires a significant amount of practice in boat handling as well as previous experience as a boat crew member.

The Coast Guard does not have a dedicated coxswain rating. Any Coast Guardsman, regardless of their rating or specialty, may be additionally designated as a coxswain upon proper qualification. An advancement to boatswain&#x27;s mate second class requires that the individual qualify as and maintain certification as a coxswain. A commanding officer or officer in charge of a land based unit with boats has to be certified and stay certified as a coxswain on all boats in the unit or be relieved of command.

A coxswain is assigned to a boat by the command authority and can only be relieved by the commanding officer/officer in charge, executive officer/executive petty officer, or senior officer present. The coxswain&#x27;s authority is independent of rank and/or seniority in relation to any other person on board the boat. Unlike the commanding officer of a cutter or ship, a coxswain does not automatically have command authority.

<text>Francis Brown Stockbridge (April 9, 1826April 30, 1894) was a U.S. Senator in the state of Michigan.

== Biography ==
Stockbridge was born in Bath, Maine, the son of a physician, Dr. John Stockbridge, and attended the common schools there. He clerked at a wholesale house in Boston from 1843 to 1847. He then moved to Chicago and opened a lumber yard. In 1851 he moved to Saugatuck, Michigan, and engaged in the operation of sawmills. He was also interested in mercantile pursuits.

In 1863 he moved to Kalamazoo and there engaged in the lumber business. That same year he married Bessie, a schoolteacher and sister of George Thomas Arnold, a lumberman and business associate there (and later at Mackinac Island). In 1869 Stockbridge became a member of the Michigan State House of Representatives from Allegan County&#x27;s first district and in 1871 a member of the Michigan State Senate from the 17th district. He was appointed ambassador to the Netherlands on July 12, 1875, took the oath of office but never proceeded to the post.

In 1882, Stockbridge purchased the site of the famous Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island and arranged financing for its construction from the three major transportation companies that rendered service to the island at the time: the Michigan Central Railroad, the Grand Rapids and Indiana Railroad, and the Detroit and Cleveland Navigation Company. Together, they formed the Mackinac Island Hotel Company, which then built the Grand Hotel in 1887.

He was elected as a Republican to the United States Senate in 1887 and was reelected in 1893. He served from March 4, 1887, until his death on April 30, 1894. He was chairman of the Committee on Fisheries in the Fiftieth through Fifty-second Congresses. While visiting his nephew James Houghteling in Chicago he died soon after he was hit and injured by a Chicago cable car. Although the accident itself was not fatal, his associates attributed his death to the mental stress he endured from it. He and his wife are interred in Mountain Home Cemetery in Kalamazoo, Michigan.

Stockbridge was the last person to have served in the Michigan State Legislature and in the United States Senate until Debbie Stabenow was elected in 2000.

<text>Circle Takes the Square is an American screamo band from Savannah, Georgia. It is composed of founding members Drew Speziale and Kathleen Stubelek, as well as Caleb Collins. Their debut release was a 6-track self-titled EP released in 2001, followed by a 7&quot; split with Pg. 99 in 2002. In 2004, they released their debut studio album &quot;As the Roots Undo&quot; on Robotic Empire, which released the CD, and HyperRealist Records, which released the gatefold LP. The album gained them considerable acclaim and the band toured extensively to promote it during the year. This included a six-week east coast tour that took the band into Canada for the first time, supported by Arkata and Raise Them And Eat Them. The band&#x27;s second album, &quot;&quot;, was released after an 8-year silence on December 21, 2012, as a digital download; physical editions of the album were released in April 2013.

==Musical style==
Ben Sailer of Noisey wrote that &quot;As the Roots Undo&quot;, which Drew Speziale describes as &quot;just a punk rock record from 2004&quot;, has long garnered praise from both the press and fans alike for its forward-thinking blend of 90s screamo, fractured grindcore, and experimental post-rock. Metal Injection described their style as a &quot;blend of progressive experimentation and DIY hardcore, metal, and noise [...] characterized by a natural fusion of the off-the-wall structures of grindcore and the sweeping guitar dynamics of post-punk&quot;. The band themselves have described the sound as &quot;...a punk rock band with reverence for the Mystery.&quot; 

==Legacy==
Metal Injection called Circle Takes the Square &quot;legendary&quot;. Writing for NPR music, Lars Gotrich credited Circle Takes the Square alongside Pg. 99, Orchid and Majority Rule as pioneers of emotional post-hardcore.

<doc id="870082" wikidata="Q1570057" url="?curid=870082" title="Sledge Hammer!">
<text>Sledge Hammer! is an American satirical police sitcom produced by New World Television that ran for two seasons on ABC from September 23, 1986, to February 12, 1988. The series was created by Alan Spencer and stars David Rasche as Inspector Sledge Hammer, a caricature of the standard &quot;cop on the edge&quot; character.

==Setting==
The series takes place in San Francisco, California, with parts of Los Angeles used as a stand-in for filming. However, no mention of San Francisco was made past the pilot episode and none of the city&#x27;s landmarks are seen throughout the series, though the city name can be read on the police department building sign. The San Francisco newspaper used at the beginning of the pilot episode was censored during the show&#x27;s initial broadcast, as the city wanted nothing to do with the series. Subsequent episodes showed newspapers that had no city name.

==Episodes==

==Cast and characters==

===Main===

* David Rasche as Inspector Sledge Hammer: The titular character of the series, he is stubborn, sexist, and reactionary (all of this by his own admission), but also a serious and respectful detective from the San Francisco Police Department. Hammer&#x27;s most prized possession is his Smith &amp; Wesson Model 29 .44 Magnum with a customized grip, featuring an engraving of a sledgehammer. Hammer sleeps and showers with his gun (which has its own satin pillow), and even talks to it, referring to it as his &quot;amigo.&quot; He believes in shooting and asking questions . Unlike other comic crime fighters, Hammer is a blunderbuss that is effective and even capable of humanity on rare occasions. Spencer chose Rasche, since he was someone who was not already known as a comedian, but &quot;someone that could make you believe that this man really was having a relationship with his gun&quot;.
* Anne-Marie Martin as Detective Dori Doreau: A sensitive, intelligent, and sophisticated police detective, she becomes Hammer&#x27;s partner. In an interview with The A.V. Club, Spencer said he needed someone that the &quot;audience would look up to, and adore, and like. And she was the validation for Sledge Hammer because Anne-Marie is such a wonderful actress—appealing person, sexy, with authority, and strong. And if she likes Sledge Hammer, that means he’s okay, so she was kind of the insurance on screen. No matter what he was doing, as long as she liked him, believed in him, and was his partner, he was going to be okay&quot;. In season 2, Spencer was asked to develop her relationship more with Hammer as with ABC&#x27;s flagship &quot;Moonlighting&quot; but he preferred to have it be more like in &quot;Get Smart&quot;.
* Harrison Page as Captain Trunk: Hammer and Doreau&#x27;s supervisor, he is regularly driven into fits of rage by Hammer&#x27;s inconsiderate and brash attitude. Spencer related Page&#x27;s portrayal to Louis Gossett&#x27;s character in &quot;An Officer and a Gentlemen&quot; with regards to his yelling, and also Herbert Lom&#x27;s character Inspector Dreyfus in &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; film series.

===Recurring===
* Leslie Morris as Officer Fletcher Majoy: desk sergeant at the precinct.
* Patti Tippo as Officer Daley: another officer at the precinct who is sometimes a gal pal to Doreau.
* Kurt Paul as Norman Blates: the precinct&#x27;s medical examiner, he specializes in the sudden deceased at crime scenes. According to executive producer Alan Spencer, the character is an homage to Norman Bates, the character from &quot;Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot;.&quot;
* Diane Sainte-Marie as Lisa Ellerblub: a local news anchorwoman (a play on Linda Ellerbee), she is usually on the receiving end of Hammer&#x27;s chauvinistic insults.

==Production history==

Inspired by Clint Eastwood&#x27;s no-nonsense approach to law enforcement in the &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; films, teenager Alan Spencer dreamed up the idea of a police officer whose approach was even more over-the-top, to the point of absurdity. At the age of 16, Spencer wrote a screenplay based on this idea. The script and the main character were both named &quot;Sledge Hammer&quot;.

Despite his youth, Spencer had already written for Rodney Dangerfield and such television as &quot;The Facts of Life&quot; and &quot;One Day at a Time&quot;. He sold his script upon the release of the fourth &quot;Dirty Harry&quot; movie &quot;Sudden Impact&quot; and the popularity of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Dirty Harry&quot;-inspired action series &quot;Hunter&quot;; the latter property created demand for a satirical police television show. When HBO approached Leonard B. Stern, former producer of &quot;Get Smart&quot;, about developing such a show, Stern recommended Spencer&#x27;s &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; idea. Stern knew of Spencer trying to help Don Adams by personally writing a few gags for the comedian on the set of &quot;The Nude Bomb&quot; and was returning the favor.

Spencer quickly reworked his script for a half-hour television format. HBO executives wanted to produce the pilot and suggested casting ideas that Spencer found unacceptable, such as known comedians Rodney Dangerfield or Joe Piscopo in the lead role as opposed to a lesser known actor who would become the character. Last-place ABC was willing to take a chance on the unorthodox script. ABC insisted that the violence be toned down for network television and that a laugh track be included (although some versions – including the DVD release of the show – do not have this track or had it removed; Spencer found it offensive that the audience be told when to laugh and was furious over the decision), but agreed to cast Spencer&#x27;s first choice for the lead character, the classically trained actor David Rasche. &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; entered ABC&#x27;s fall lineup in 1986.

The pilot of &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; was completed just as Peter Gabriel&#x27;s song &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; became a huge hit. ABC took advantage of this coincidence by using the song in television, radio, and film advertisements for the show. Spencer said Gabriel had been willing to license his song to the series and even rewrite the lyrics, but New World Television wouldn&#x27;t meet the artist&#x27;s terms. Nevertheless, Spencer was happy with what would be Danny Elfman&#x27;s first TV theme.

===Intro and theme music===

The introduction to the show features long, near sensual closeup shots of Hammer&#x27;s .44 Magnum as it rests on a luxurious satin pillow. The show&#x27;s ominous theme music, composed by Danny Elfman, plays in the background. Hammer then picks up his gun, spins it expertly like a cinematic Old West gunslinger, and utters his catch phrase (&quot;Trust me, I know what I&#x27;m doing&quot;) just before firing into the screen, making a hole in it. According to the DVD release extras, the original version had Hammer firing at the viewer, but ABC executives feared this could be too shocking, possibly even causing heart attacks (and leaving the network liable). Thus, Hammer fires into the screen at a slight angle.

According to the DVD release, Hammer&#x27;s original catchphrase was &quot;I&#x27;m crazy, but I know what I&#x27;m doing.&quot; ABC executives objected to a lead character being &quot;crazy&quot;, so they insisted on a change. Spencer remarked that &quot;it wound up working just as well and is probably funnier, because then he’s not self-aware&quot;.

The DVD release uses an updated heavy metal version of the theme music by Baboon Rising on the main menus.

===Ratings and second season===
Despite critical acclaim and garnering high ratings in a special time slot just for the debut, &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; struggled in the ratings partly due to being repeatedly bounced around ABC&#x27;s fall schedule.

During the same season &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; made its debut, ABC scheduled a high-profile comeback vehicle for a then 75-year-old Lucille Ball entitled &quot;Life with Lucy&quot; that was not well received by critics or audiences. After only eight episodes aired, Ball&#x27;s show was canceled and &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; was given her timeslot.

&quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; attracted weekly viewership of nineteen million viewers who followed the show religiously through its many time slot shifts. The fact that the series appealed to key target demographics also kept it on the schedule.

Because ABC intended to cancel the series, the last episode of the first season ends with Hammer accidentally destroying the city when he attempts to disarm a stolen nuclear warhead. This episode received much better than expected ratings, in large part because the network had moved the show to a better time slot. ABC changed its mind and renewed the show for a second season.

The second-season premiere perfunctorily explained that it and following episodes were set &quot;five years before&quot; the explosion, though Doreau is Sledge&#x27;s partner in the second season, despite being introduced to him in the pilot, and despite the presence of references to contemporary events, rather than those of five years earlier.

The second season suffered from another extremely undesirable time slot (this time against &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;), a reduced budget, and lowered filming standard (they went from 35 mm in season 1 to 16mm film in season 2). The cutbacks contributed to the show not being renewed for a third season.

==Home media==
Anchor Bay Entertainment released the entire series on DVD in Region 1. The first season of &quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; was released on DVD on July 27, 2004. The laugh track, which the network had insisted on including on the pilot and first 12 episodes, is removed on the DVD version. For this Spencer in part sourced copies of the episodes from collectors in the UK who had recorded the episodes where they aired without the laugh track and hired an experienced sound designer. These collectors are thanked on these DVDs. The DVD features a documentary on the series featuring interviews by Spencer, David Rasche, Anne-Marie Martin and Harrison Page. The DVD also includes an unaired version of the pilot that runs several minutes longer and has a different ending and theme music. An earthquake hit while Spencer was recording commentary for one of the DVDs; the tape kept rolling during the event and was included on the DVD, leaving viewers wondering whether the earthquake was real. The first season enjoyed strong sales. The second season was released on DVD on April 12, 2005; the commentary on the final episode ended with Spencer, again, being caught in another earthquake, this time with sound effects and a convenient cliffhanger.

On September 6, 2011, it was announced that Image Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series. It was subsequently announced that they will release &quot;Sledge Hammer!- The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on December 13, 2011. The set will not feature the documentary, commentaries, the uncut pilot (the broadcast version is used) and other bonus features from the Anchor Bay release.

In Region 4, Shock Entertainment has released both seasons on DVD in Australia.

==Awards==
&quot;Sledge Hammer!&quot; was nominated for a 1987 People&#x27;s Choice Award in the category of &quot;Favorite New TV Comedy.&quot;

==Comics==
New World&#x27;s then-subsidiary Marvel Comics released a short-lived comic book based upon the series as a promotion for the second season. In the second issue, Sledge is up against a Spider-Man imposter and on the cover issue a disclaimer hints that Sledge Hammer is actually a mutant when the &quot;X-Men&quot; series and its mutant spin-offs were on the height of their popularity.

The series only lasted two issues but was only intended for publicity purposes.

<text>A distributed data store is a computer network where information is stored on more than one node, often in a replicated fashion. It is usually specifically used to refer to either a distributed database where users store information on a &quot;number of nodes&quot;, or a computer network in which users store information on a &quot;number of peer network nodes&quot;.

==Distributed databases==
Distributed databases are usually non-relational databases that enable a quick access to data over a large number of nodes. Some distributed databases expose rich query abilities while others are limited to a key-value store semantics. Examples of limited distributed databases are Google&#x27;s Bigtable, which is much more than a distributed file system or a peer-to-peer network, Amazon&#x27;s Dynamo
and Microsoft Azure Storage.

As the ability of arbitrary querying is not as important as the availability, designers of distributed data stores have increased the latter at an expense of consistency. But the high-speed read/write access results in reduced consistency, as it is not possible to guarantee both consistency and availability on a partitioned network, as stated by the CAP theorem.

==Peer network node data stores==
In peer network data stores, the user can usually reciprocate and allow other users to use their computer as a storage node as well. Information may or may not be accessible to other users depending on the design of the network.

Most peer-to-peer networks do not have distributed data stores in that the user&#x27;s data is only available when their node is on the network. However, this distinction is somewhat blurred in a system such as BitTorrent, where it is possible for the originating node to go offline but the content to continue to be served. Still, this is only the case for individual files requested by the redistributors, as contrasted with networks such as Freenet, Winny, Share and Perfect Dark where any node may be storing any part of the files on the network.

Distributed data stores typically use an error detection and correction technique.
Some distributed data stores (such as Parchive over NNTP) use forward error correction techniques to recover the original file when parts of that file are damaged or unavailable.
Others try again to download that file from a different mirror.

==Examples==

<text>Leander Haußmann (sometimes Haussmann) (; born 26 June 1959) is a German theatre and film director.

The son of actor Ezard Haußmann and costume designer Doris Haußmann, he was born in Quedlinburg and attended the Ernst Busch theatre school in Berlin.

Haußmann was the theatre director of the city theatre in Bochum (Schauspielhaus Bochum). He also wrote and acted in several plays (1995–2000), and had a role in the Detlev Buck film &quot;Jailbirds&quot; (1996). His feature film breakthrough came with &quot;Sonnenallee&quot; in 1999. His second feature, &quot;Herr Lehmann&quot;, followed in 2003. His production of &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; in Munich was controversial, compounding the trouble surrounding his production of &quot;Peter Pan&quot;. As a result, his scheduled production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; was cancelled.

<text>Fatih Akin (, born 25 August 1973) is a German film director, screenwriter and producer. His films have won numerous awards and accolades, including the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival for his film &quot;Head-On&quot; (2004), Best Screenplay at the Cannes Film Festival for his film &quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot; (2007), and the Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film for his film &quot;In the Fade&quot; (2017).

== Early life ==
Akin was born in Hamburg to Turkish parents. He has one brother, Cem Akin, who works as an actor. He attended the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg to study visual communications and graduated in 2000.

Akin has been married to German-Mexican actress Monique Obermüller since 2004. The couple live in Hamburg-Altona, close to where he was raised. They have two children.

== Career ==
Akin made his debut as director of a full-length film as early as 1998 with &quot;Short Sharp Shock&quot; &quot;(Kurz und schmerzlos)&quot;, which brought him the &quot;Bronze Leopard&quot; award at the Locarno International Film Festival in Switzerland and the &quot;Pierrot&quot;, the Bavarian Film Award for Best New Director in Munich the same year. Since then he has directed feature films such as &quot;In July&quot; (&quot;Im Juli&quot;) in 2000, &quot;We forgot to go back&quot; (&quot;Wir haben vergessen zurückzukehren&quot;) in 2001 and &quot;Solino&quot;&#x27; in 2002.

His fourth film, &quot;Head-On&quot; (&quot;Gegen die Wand&quot;), starring Sibel Kekilli, was a major success in 2004 and received several prizes, among them the Golden Bear award at the Berlin Film Festival and the &quot;Best Film&quot; and the &quot;Audience Award&quot; at the 2004 European Film Awards.

In 2005, he directed a documentary about the Istanbul music scene, &quot;Crossing the Bridge: The Sound of Istanbul&quot;, which includes musicians such as Ceza, Sezen Aksu, Aynur Doğan and Brenna MacCrimmon. It is narrated by a member of a German experimental band Einstürzende Neubauten, Alexander Hacke, who also produced music for &quot;Head-On&quot;.

In 2007, Akin&#x27;s &quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot;, a German-Turkish cross-cultural tale of loss, mourning and forgiveness, won the prize for Best Screenplay at the 60th Cannes Film Festival in 2007. On 24 October 2007 the same film was awarded the first edition of the LUX prize for European cinema by the European Parliament.

About the comedy &quot;Soul Kitchen&quot; (2009) he has said he chose this more light-hearted film because he needed a break after making the &quot;tough&quot; films &quot;Head-On&quot; and &quot;The Edge of Heaven&quot; before making his next planned film &quot;The Devil&quot;. &quot;But&quot;, he says, &quot;now I feel ready to finish the trilogy&quot;.

In 2012, his documentary film &quot;Polluting Paradise&quot; was screened in the Special Screenings section at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival.

His 2014 film &quot;The Cut&quot; was selected to compete for the Golden Lion at the 71st Venice International Film Festival.

In 2017, Akin&#x27;s film &quot;In the Fade&quot; was selected to compete for the Palme d&#x27;Or in the main competition section at the 2017 Cannes Film Festival. At Cannes that year, Diane Kruger won the Best Actress award. The film was subsequently selected as the German entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 90th Academy Awards, making the December shortlist. &quot;In the Fade&quot; won the Golden Globe for Best Foreign Language Film.

== Awards ==
* 1998 Bavarian Film Awards, Best New Director

Tampax conducted medical studies in 1945 to prove the safety of tampons. 

In 1984, the company was renamed Tambrands Inc.

Marketing for the product includes the company&#x27;s BeingGirl website.

<text>In North American aviation, a NORDO () aircraft is an aircraft flying without a radio. While sometimes used to denote small general aviation aircraft that are not equipped with a radio, the term is more commonly applied to aircraft that have experienced a radio failure while flying.

The term originates from the 5-character uppercase abbreviated notation &quot;NORDO&quot; displayed on controllers&#x27; radar scopes when an aircraft transmits the &quot;radio failure&quot; code on its transponder. An alternate explanation is that &quot;NO RDO&quot; was the standard note made on maintenance and equipment sheets used in military aviation, starting in the 1930s, as a code to identify planes which needed radio repairs or were not equipped with radios. The term has made its way into standard aviation jargon, used as an adjective or a noun to describe an aircraft without a radio, even among pilots and others who are not air traffic controllers.

In-flight radio failure may constitute an emergency, as determined by the pilot. Aircraft equipped with a transponder should indicate a NORDO situation by setting the appropriate transponder code: 7600 (&quot;seven-six: radio fix&quot;). NORDO aircraft declaring an emergency are given priority over other aircraft (providing a more serious emergency does not occur on another aircraft).

If the radio failure occurs in &quot;visual flight rules&quot; (VFR) conditions in an area where radio communication is required, the pilot is expected to continue under VFR and land when feasible. If flying under &quot;instrument flight rules&quot; (IFR) conditions, and VFR conditions exist or are encountered after the failure, the flight should be continued in VFR conditions and the pilot shall land as soon as practicable. If VFR conditions do not exist, the pilot will then continue the route last assigned by ATC. See FAR 91.185.

Air traffic control may re-establish communications with NORDO aircraft by using emergency frequencies, voice features of NAVAIDs, or aviation light signals. In the event of one-way communications (i.e. aircraft can receive only), the controller may request the aircraft make identifying turns, flash their navigational lights, transmit codes or IDENT signals on the transponder, rock their wings, etc., to acknowledge clearances or instructions.

<text>Michael Herbig (born 29 April 1968), nicknamed Bully, is a German comedian and actor. 

== Career ==

His career began in 1992 with regular appearances on radio (more than 800), leading to appearances on various television shows. He gained wider fame as writer, actor and director of the comedy show &quot;Bullyparade&quot;. The show featured him as the host, his good friend Rick Kavanian, Christian Tramitz, and Diana Herold as a dancer and occasional actress in the skits. The show featured many different themes, including stereotypical gay archetypes in a &quot;Star Trek&quot; parody, an homage to westerns, and of the Austrian royal, Elisabeth of Bavaria, known as Sissi. On the show, he let the audience vote which theme to use for each of his movies based upon characters from the show. The first, the 2001 &quot;Der Schuh des Manitu&quot; (&quot;Manitou&#x27;s Shoe&quot;) was seen by over 11.7 million people, one of the most successful German films to date. His second film, &quot;(T)Raumschiff Surprise – Periode 1&quot; (2004) was also a commercial success, cementing his career.

In January 2008, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Herbig was set to film a live-action adaptation of animated series &quot;Vicky the Viking&quot;. The film, carrying the same name as the animated series, was released in 2009.

In 2018, the film &quot;Balloon&quot; was released, in which he acted as a director, screenwriter and producer. It is his first directorial work that is not a comedy. The movie depicts the balloon escape of the Strelzyk and Wetzel families, from East to West Germany in 1979.

Herbig voiced Sheriff Woody in the German dubs of &quot;Toy Story 3&quot; and &quot;4&quot;, after his former German dubber Peer Augustinski had a stroke in 2005 and died in 2014.

Since April 2021, Herbig has been the Host of Last One Laughing: Germany on Amazon Prime.

<text>Vail Montgomery Pittman (September 17, 1880 – January 29, 1964) was an American businessman and politician. A member of the Democratic Party, he served as the 19th governor of Nevada.

==Biography==
Pittman was born in Vicksburg, Mississippi, the youngest of four sons born to William Buckner Pittman and Katherine Key Pittman, a direct descendant of Francis Scott Key. His siblings included Key Pittman, a longtime United States Senator from Nevada. William and Katherine Pittman died when Vail Pittman was an infant, and the Pittmans were raised in Lake Providence, Louisiana, by their uncle and aunt, Mr. and Mrs. Vail Montgomery. Vail Pittman was educated by private tutors and in the public schools until he attended Sewanee Military Academy. He then attended the University of the South and Brown&#x27;s Business College, but returned to Lake Providence in 1903 to manage the family cotton plantation after Vail Montgomery&#x27;s death.

==Career==
Pittman moved to Tonopah, Nevada, in 1904, and worked initially at the Tonopah-Goldfield Lumber and Coal Company until purchasing the company&#x27;s coal business and operating it as a separate company. He sold the coal business in 1907, and subsequently engaged in a variety of occupations, including undersheriff of Nye County, sergeant-at-arms of the Nevada Senate, and partner in a mining company. On May 20, 1919, he married Ida Louise Brewington. In 1920 Vail and Ida Pittman bought the &quot;Ely Daily Times&quot; of Ely, Nevada, and he began a successful career in the newspaper business. Pittman was also involved in several civic and business organizations, including the good roads movement and the local chamber of commerce. From 1925 to 1929 Pittman served in the Nevada Senate. After his brother Key&#x27;s 1940 death, Vail Pittman unsuccessfully sought the governor&#x27;s appointment to his U.S. Senate seat.

Pittman was elected the 19th lieutenant governor of Nevada in 1942. He was a candidate in the Democratic primary for United States Senate in 1944, but was defeated by the incumbent, Pat McCarran. He became governor when Edward P. Carville resigned in 1945 to accept appointment to a vacant U.S. Senate seat. Pittman was elected to a full term in 1946, and served until 1951. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1950 and in 1954, losing both times to Charles H. Russell. After leaving office Pittman resumed operation of the &quot;Ely Daily Times&quot;. He later sold the newspaper, and became an officer of the Nevada Savings and Loan Association and the Nevada State Bank. He was involved in the Rotary Club and was a delegate to international conferences in Switzerland and Japan. He served as a delegate to the 1956 and 1960 Democratic National Conventions.

==Death==
Pittman died from cancer on January 29, 1964, in a hospital in San Francisco, California at the age of 83. He is interred at Masonic Memorial Gardens, Reno, Washoe County, Nevada, US.

<doc id="870143" wikidata="Q381907" url="?curid=870143" title="Aeterni regis">
<text>The papal bull Aeterni regis [English: &quot;Of the eternal king&#x27;s [grace]&quot;] was issued on 21 June 1481 by Pope Sixtus IV. It confirmed the substance of the Treaty of Alcáçovas, reiterating that treaty&#x27;s confirmation of Castile in its possession of the Canary Islands and its granting to Portugal all further territorial acquisitions made by Christian powers in Africa and eastward to the Indies.

==Background==

The War of the Castilian Succession was fought between Portugal and Castile from 1475 to 1479 over who should succeed Henry IV of Castile, his daughter, Joanna or his half-sister, Isabella. Joanna was married to Afonso V of Portugal and Isabella was wed to Ferdinand II of Aragon. Underlying this were decades-long disagreements over hegemony of the Atlantic. Both kingdoms claimed territorial sovereignty over the Canary Islands and the West Coast of Africa. While Castile had some success in land battles, Portugal had the advantage at sea.

==Treaty of Alcaçovas==
Through the good offices of Beatrice, Duchess of Viseu, first cousin of Afonso V and aunt to Isabella of Castile, the parties negotiated a settlement. A treaty was entered into at Alcáçovas, in southern Portugal, (at the house of Dona Beatrice), on 4 September 1479. Each side agreed to relinquish any claims to the other&#x27;s kingdom. The agreement incorporated terms of a 1431 agreement regarding restitution of places, release of prisoners, and demolition of fortresses. In addition, Portugal ceded the Canaries to Castile, and Castile, in turn recognized Portugal&#x27;s possession and rights of trade in the Azores, Madeira, the Cape Verde Islands, and the coast of Guinea. It was further stipulated that any violation of the terms would incur a fine of 300,000 gold &quot;doblas&quot;.

A collateral agreement, the &quot;Tercerias de Moura&quot; arranged the marriage of Afonso V&#x27;s grandson Alfonso to Isabella of Castile&#x27;s oldest daughter, also named Isabella. It provided that the children would live at Mouros, a town near the border between both kingdoms, under the supervision of Dona Beatrice, until they were old enough to wed.

The treaty also states that the parties took a solemn oath to abide by its terms, and pledged not to subsequently seek or avail themselves of a dispensation from the oath from the Pope or his representative.

On May 4, 1481, King Afonso V of Portugal granted his son, Infante Joao the trade and fisheries of Guinea, and prohibited anyone from going there without a license from the prince. By the end of August Prince John had succeeded his father as king. His main objective was to find a sea route to the East.

==Papal endorsement==
The bull confirmed the earlier bulls &quot;Romanus Pontifex&quot;, issued by Nicholas V in 1455. It also incorporated the terms already agreed to by Portugal and Castile in the Treaty of Alcáçovas, lending moral authority to the parties&#x27; territorial division.

According to Malyn Newitt in &quot;A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion&quot;, &quot;Portuguese&#x27;s ... empire was able to grow in a manner which would have been impossible if it had been challenged by a well-armed opponent.&quot; However, Isabella and Ferdinand were involved in the Granada War, England was embroiled in dynastic conflict, and Louis XI of France was drawn to the affairs of Italy.

<text>Joseph Vilsmaier (, 24 January 1939 – 11 February 2020) was a German film director who began his career as a technician and cameraman. He is internationally known for films such as &quot;Comedian Harmonists&quot;.

== Life ==
Born in Munich. Vilsmaier attended a boarding school near Augsburg. He then trained as a technician to make film cameras, and studied piano at the Musikhochschule München. He was a member of a jazz group. After working as a technician, he moved into film, first as a material and camera assistant, then from 1961 as a cameraman. He filmed episodes of television series such as &quot;Tatort&quot;.

His debut film as director, &quot;Herbstmilch&quot; in 1988, starring his wife, Dana Vávrová, was a huge success. In 1995, he directed &quot;Schlafes Bruder&quot;, after the novel by Robert Schneider. In 1997, he directed &quot;Comedian Harmonists&quot; which became an international success. For the films he directed, Vilsmaier was also the producer and first cameraman.

While filming &quot;Der Letzte Zug&quot; in 2005, probably the last film produced by Artur Brauner, he was injured when he fell off a camera tower. Subsequently, his ability to work was limited, and his wife took over directing the film. The couple was awarded the special jury prize at the 2006 Bavarian Film Awards for &quot;Der letzte Zug&quot;.

Vávrová died on 5 February 2009. The couple had three daughters, , , and , all of whom became actresses and starred in a number of their films.

<text>Duck Key is an island in Monroe County, Florida, United States, in the middle Florida Keys. It is part of the Duck Key, Florida census-designated place. The CDP also includes the neighboring island of Conch Key.

==History==
The key was the site of a salt manufacturing operation in the 1820s &amp; 1830s. Occupation of the island ceased after the Labor Day Hurricane of 1935 and did not resume until the key was connected to the highway by a causeway in 1953. J.W. Norie, in his Piloting Directions for the Gulf of Florida, The Bahama Bank &amp; Islands (1828) states: &quot;Duck Key - Some two miles (3 km) long, low, rocky, &amp; covered with mangroves; some small patches of good land with a little timber. This island formerly saltworks but they were transferred latterly to Key West, owned by Mr. Howe, who is also possessor of this Key.&quot; Hawk&#x27;s Cay Resort is currently located here, and the island is sometimes known by that name. Noted Michigan Senate leader, Emil Lockwood, retired in Duck Key, where he served in many civic and political capacities until his death in 2002.

==Geography==
Duck Key is located oceanside of U.S. 1 (or the Overseas Highway), at approximately mile marker 61, between Conch Key and Grassy Key.

<text>Sönke Wortmann (; 25 August 1959 in Marl, North Rhine-Westphalia) is a German film director and producer.

== Biography ==
Wortmann&#x27;s father was a miner. After Wortmann&#x27;s A-Levels he wanted to become a professional football player and started playing with Westfalia Herne and later SpVgg Erkenschwick in the German 3rd division. After three years he gave up the idea of becoming a professional football player.

One semester he studied sociology before entering the University of Television and Film Munich to study film directing. After spending some time at the London Royal College of Art he finished his career successfully. While studying, he worked as a taxi driver and actor, for example in the TV series &quot;Die glückliche Familie&quot;. His debut feature film &quot;Der bewegte Mann&quot; was released in 1994. It became one of the most successful German film of the post-war era.

&quot;The Superwife&quot; (1996) was filmed, as he himself said, to prove that it is possible to make &quot;a successful film out of a successful novel&quot;. &quot;Der Campus&quot; was more or less accomplished on the same terms, but achieved fewer viewers. Films like &quot;Mr. Bluesman&quot; and the drama film in episodes &quot;St Pauli Night&quot;, for which he was acclaimed by critics, turned out to be commercial failures and didn&#x27;t run a long time in cinemas. Wortmann shot &quot;The Hollywood Sign&quot;, based on Leon de Winter&#x27;s novel &quot;De hemel van Hollywood&quot;, in the US with a very good cast. &quot;The Hollywood Sign&quot; came out in 2004 in Germany, but didn&#x27;t run long in cinemas. Wortmann sees &quot;The Miracle of Bern&quot; as his greatest success, which became the most successful film in German cinemas in the year 2003.

During the Confederations Cup 2005 and the Football World Cup 2006 he joined the Germany national team on their trip. At every match he sat on the trainer&#x27;s bench and, by order and for account of national team manager Jürgen Klinsmann, he prepared films which were later shown to the players in order to prepare them for an upcoming match. The two-hour documentary film on the world cup, produced from over 100 hours of filming material, was presented to the Germany national football team on 14 August 2006 as a preview and premiered in cinemas on 5 December 2006 under the title &quot;Deutschland. Ein Sommermärchen&quot;. The film had more than 4 million viewers and was a big success. The net profits of the film were donated to SOS Children&#x27;s Villages.

In 1998 Wortmann founded his own production company .

From 2007 he worked on the project to adapt the novel &quot;Pope Joan&quot;. The production was carried out by Bernd Eichinger. Initially, the female pope Johanna was going to be portrayed by Franka Potente. In Mai 2008 though, the production company announced that Johanna Wokalek was going to play the pope. The production was also conducted under Oliver Berben. In the year 2009, the film was released in cinemas.

Sönke Wortmann is married to the actress Cecilia Kunz and has three children.

Wortmann is an active member of the German authors&#x27; national football team (Autonama). He also supports &quot;Dein Fußballclub&quot; since April 2008. This club&#x27;s aim is to engage over 30,000 new members every year, who pay €39.95 each every year. The foundation of this club was modeled after the English club Ebbsfleet United F.C.

Sönke Wortmann is also member of Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens political party.

<text>Marsha Hunt (born Marcia Virginia Hunt; October 17, 1917 – September 7, 2022) was an American actress with a career spanning nearly 80 years. She was blacklisted by Hollywood film studio executives in the 1950s during McCarthyism.

She appeared in many films, including &quot;Born to the West&quot; (1937) with John Wayne, &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1940) with Greer Garson and Laurence Olivier, &quot;Kid Glove Killer&quot; (1942) with Van Heflin, &quot;Cry &#x27;Havoc&#x27;&quot; (1943) with Margaret Sullavan and Joan Blondell, &quot;The Human Comedy&quot; (1943) with Mickey Rooney, &quot;Raw Deal&quot; (1948) with Claire Trevor, &quot;The Happy Time&quot; (1952) with Charles Boyer, and Dalton Trumbo&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot; (1971).

In the midst of the blacklist era, she became active in the humanitarian cause of world hunger and in her later years aided homeless shelters, supported same-sex marriage, raised awareness of climate change, and promoted peace in Third World countries.

== Early life ==
Hunt was born on October 17, 1917, in Chicago, Illinois, the youngest of two daughters. Her parents were Earl Hunt, a lawyer and later a Social Security Administrator, and Minabel Hunt, a vocal teacher, and organist. Her elder sister, Marjorie, a teacher, died in 2002. Marcia later changed the spelling of her first name to Marsha.

Hunt and her family were active in the Methodist church. Interviewed for a 1999 book, she said about her family: 

Hunt&#x27;s family moved to New York City when she was young, and she began performing in school plays and church functions. She graduated from the Horace Mann High School for Girls in 1934 at age 16.

== Career ==

=== Modeling ===
Hunt&#x27;s parents wanted her to pursue a college degree, but Hunt, unable to &quot;locate a single college or university in the land where you could major in drama before your third year&quot;, found work modeling for the John Powers Agency and began taking stage acting classes at the Theodora Irvine Studio. She was one of the highest-earning models by 1935. In May 1935, she planned on studying stage acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in the United Kingdom.

=== Years at Paramount ===
Although initially reluctant to pursue a film career, in June 1935, at age 17, Hunt signed a seven-year contract with Paramount Pictures. Paramount discovered her when she was visiting her uncle in Los Angeles and the comedian Zeppo Marx (of the Marx Brothers fame) saw a picture of her in the newspaper. She was then offered a screen test for &quot;The Virginia Judge&quot;. At Paramount, Hunt mainly played ingenue parts. Between 1935 and 1938, she made 12 pictures at Paramount, including starring roles in &quot;Easy to Take&quot; (1936), &quot;Gentle Julia&quot; (1936), &quot;The Accusing Finger&quot; (1936), &quot;Murder Goes to College&quot; (1937), and two on &quot;loan-out&quot; to RKO and 20th Century Fox. In 1937, she starred opposite John Wayne, a couple of years before his breakthrough in Hollywood, in the Western film &quot;Born to the West&quot;.

The studio terminated Hunt&#x27;s contract in 1938, and she spent a few years starring in B-films produced by poverty row studios such as Republic Pictures and Monogram Pictures. She also headed to New York City for work in summer stock theatre shortly before winning a supporting role in MGM&#x27;s &quot;These Glamour Girls&quot; (1939) opposite Lana Turner and Lew Ayres. The role of Betty was said to have been written especially with Hunt in mind. Other roles in major studio productions soon followed, including supporting roles as Mary Bennet in MGM&#x27;s version of &quot;Pride and Prejudice&quot; (1940) with Laurence Olivier, and as Martha Scott&#x27;s surrogate child Hope Thompson in &quot;Cheers for Miss Bishop&quot; (1941).

=== Years at MGM ===
In 1941, Hunt signed a contract with MGM, where she remained for the next six years. While filming &quot;Blossoms in the Dust&quot;, film director Mervyn LeRoy lauded Hunt for her heartfelt and genuine acting ability. During this period she had starring roles in 21 films, including &quot;The Penalty&quot; (1941) opposite Lionel Barrymore, &quot;Panama Hattie&quot; (1942) opposite Ann Sothern and Red Skelton, and the war drama &quot;Pilot No. 5&quot; (1943) in which she was cast as the love interest of Franchot Tone, and &quot;The Valley of Decision&quot; (1945). In 1944 she polled seventh in a list by exhibitors of &quot;Stars of Tomorrow&quot;. She previously did a screen test to play Melanie Hamilton in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot; (1939) and was told by David O. Selznick she would play the role, but to &quot;keep it a secret for now.&quot; Three days later, it was announced that Olivia de Havilland was cast. In 1944, she appeared in &quot;None Shall Escape&quot;, a film that is now regarded as the first about the Holocaust. She played Marja Pacierkowski, the Polish fiancée of a German Nazi officer named Wilhelm Grimm.

=== Hollywood blacklist ===
In 1945, Hunt was invited to join the board of the Screen Actors Guild.

Disturbed by the actions of the House Committee on Unamerican Activities (HCUA), Hunt and her husband, screenwriter Robert Presnell Jr., became members of the Committee for the First Amendment in 1947. According to NPR, she was – at the time of her 100th birthday – the last surviving member of the group.

On October 26 that same year, aged 30, Hunt took part in &quot;Hollywood Fights Back&quot;, a star-studded radio program co-written by her husband protesting the activities of HCUA. In 2020, Hunt recalled:
The next day, Hunt flew with a group of about 30 actors, directors, writers, and filmmakers (including John Huston, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, and Danny Kaye) to Washington to protest the actions of HCUA. When she returned to Hollywood just three days later, things had changed. She was asked to denounce her activities if she wanted to find more work; she refused.

In 1950, Hunt was named as a potential Communist or Communist sympathizer (along with 151 other actors, writers, and directors) in the anti-Communist publication &quot;Red Channels&quot;. The publication claimed that her leanings were made evident by her supposedly subversive actions, including asking the Supreme Court to review the convictions of John Howard Lawson and Dalton Trumbo, recording a message in support of a rally organized by the Stop Censorship Committee in 1948, signing a statement in 1946 issued by the Hollywood Independent Citizens Committee of the Arts, Sciences and Professions (HICCASP), and speaking at a rally organized by the Progressive Citizens of America in 1946.

After the publication of &quot;Red Channels&quot; in 1950, work became scarce for Hunt and Presnell. Hunt said in 2012, &quot;The town turned against us. Just about-face...I was appalled, hurt, shocked that journalism could be so far out in prejudice.&quot;

After her 1950 blacklisting, Hunt found most work in television, not film. She appeared in only a handful of films during the next eight years. She later recalled:
During an interview in 1995, Hunt stated that she believed producer Richard J. Collins was among those responsible for her inclusion on the blacklist. She later said:
In 1957, her career began to pick up. She appeared in six films during the next three years before announcing her semi-retirement in 1960.

=== Later work ===
Following her semi-retirement in 1960, Hunt appeared in small roles in five films and numerous television shows, including an episode of the medical drama &quot;Breaking Point&quot;. In 1962, she appeared in the season-nine episode of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; titled &quot;The Glory and the Mud&quot;. In 1967, she had a leading role as Katie&#x27;s Aunt Cecile in an episode of &quot;My Three Sons&quot; entitled &quot;The Aunt Who Came To Dinner&quot;.

In 1971, she appeared in the film &quot;Johnny Got His Gun&quot;, written by fellow blacklist member Dalton Trumbo, playing the mother of the title character, portrayed by Timothy Bottoms. It won the Grand Prix at the 1971 Cannes Film Festival. On February 8, 1988, she appeared in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; in the episode &quot;Too Short a Season&quot; as Anne Jameson, wife of an admiral who took an age-reversing drug. In 1997, she appeared as Ethel Thayer in the Santa Susana Repertory Company&#x27;s production of &quot;On Golden Pond&quot;.

In 1993, her book &quot;The Way We Wore: Styles of the 1930s and &#x27;40s and Our World Since Then&quot; was published by Fallbrook Publishing.

She produced the CD &quot;Tony London: Songs From the Heart with the Page Cavanaugh Trio&quot; which includes two of the 50 songs Hunt has composed.

Hunt played Elizabeth Lyons in &quot;Chloe&#x27;s Prayer&quot;, a 2006 film. In 2008, Hunt appeared in a short film noir, &quot;The Grand Inquisitor&quot;, as Hazel Reedy, the could-be widow of one of America&#x27;s most infamous unapprehended serial killers.

In 2013, Hunt debuted a clip of a song she wrote 40 years earlier titled &quot;Here&#x27;s to All Who Love&quot; about love and same-sex marriage. Sung by &quot;Glee&quot; guest actor Bill A. Jones, the clip immediately went viral. It was featured in &quot;Marsha Hunt&#x27;s Sweet Adversity&quot;, a documentary about her life. The documentary debuted at the Palm Springs and Santa Barbara International Film Festivals in January 2015.

When she was 99 in April 2017, Hunt made a public appearance at the 2017 Los Angeles Jewish Film Festival to honor the achievements of actor and activist Ed Asner.

== Humanitarian work ==
In 1955, after a trip opened her eyes to the issue of hunger in the Third World, Hunt gave speeches throughout the United States, encouraging Americans to join the fight against starvation in the Third World by joining the United Nations Association. Hunt was a founder of the San Fernando Valley Mayor&#x27;s Fund for the Homeless and helped to open one of the first homeless shelters in the San Fernando Valley. In 1960, she produced an hour-long telecast about refugee problems that featured stars such as Paul Newman, Jean Simmons, and Bing Crosby. She raised funds for the creation of Rose Cottage, a daycare shelter for homeless children; and served for many years on the advisory board of directors for the San Fernando Valley Community Mental Health Center, a large non-profit, where she advocated for adults and children affected by homelessness and mental illness. She was named honorary mayor of Sherman Oaks, California, in 1983.

Hunt still identified as a political liberal and was very concerned with such issues as global pollution, worldwide poverty, peace in Third World nations, and population growth.

== Personal life ==
Hunt married director Jerry Hopper, assistant head of the editing department at Paramount and later a director, on November 23, 1938. They divorced in 1943.

Hunt married her second husband, screenwriter and radio director Robert Presnell Jr. on February 10, 1946.

Hunt was pregnant and very sick while filming &quot;Carnegie Hall&quot;. Her only biological child, a premature daughter, was born on July 1, 1947, and died the next day. She and her second husband later became foster parents. They remained together until his death on June 14, 1986, at age 71.

Hunt resided in the Sherman Oaks neighborhood of Los Angeles, in a home she had owned since 1946. She died there from natural causes on September 7, 2022, at the age of 104.

<text>Frank Paul Beyer (; 26 May 1932 – 1 October 2006) was a German film director. In East Germany he was one of the most important film directors, working for the state film monopoly DEFA and directed films that dealt mostly with the Nazi era and contemporary East Germany. His film &quot;Trace of Stones&quot; was banned for 20 years in 1966 by the ruling SED. His 1975 film &quot;Jacob the Liar&quot; was the only East German film ever nominated for an Academy Award. After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 until his death he mostly directed television films.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===

Frank Beyer was born as Frank Paul Beyer in Nobitz in Thuringia, Germany, to Paul Beyer, a clerk, and Charlotte Beyer, a sales clerk. He had a brother, Hermann Beyer (born 30 May 1943) who should have become a successful actor. After the Machtergreifung of the Nazi Party in 1933 his father, a social democrat lost his job and was unemployed for several years. In 1942 he was drafted for military service and was killed one year later at the Eastern Front.

In 1938 Frank Beyer started attending primary school in Nobitz, and later the Realgymnasium Ernestinum in Altenburg. His education was interrupted for a few months in the aftermath of World War II. In fall 1946 he continued his education in Altenburg and played in an amateur dramatic society. He also became a member of the Free German Youth and later of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany. After finishing school with his Abitur in 1950 he wanted to study history at the University of Leipzig, but at the request of the socialist unity party he stayed in Altenburg and worked as district party secretary for the local cultural association. At the same time he trained to become a film projectionist, and being interested in theater wrote play reviews for the local newspaper. Later he worked at the theater of the towns of Crimmitschau and Glauchau as an assistant director and dramaturge.

In 1952 Frank Beyer began to study drama at Humboldt University in Berlin, but transferred to the Film School of the Academy of Performing Arts (FAMU) in Prague shortly afterwards. In Prague he studies film directing together with his future colleagues Konrad Petzold and Ralf Kirsten. In 1954 he works as an intern at the DEFA film studio during the production of the film &quot;Ernst Thälmann – Sohn seiner Klasse&quot; directed by Kurt Maetzig. He completed another internship as an assistant director for a film adapted from the opera &quot;Zar und Zimmermann&quot; and directed by Hans Müller. In his fourth year of studies, in 1957, he worked as an assistant director for Kurt Maetzig&#x27;s two part film &quot;Schlösser und Katen&quot; with a special permission of his university. In 1957 he graduated from FAMU with the anti-war film &quot;Zwei Mütter&quot;. Based on a screenplay by Leonie Ossowski, his diploma film tells the story of a French and a German mother that fight for a child that has been mistakenly taken by the German after a bomb raid. The film had a theatrical release and became a success.

===Beyer at the DEFA studios (1957–1967)===

After graduation Frank Beyer worked as a freelancer for the DEFA studios. He had declined an offer for a permanent position as an assistant director, as he would have been assigned to film projects and would not have had the freedom to choose. He started his directorial career with two short films in the satirical film series &quot;Das Stacheltier&quot;. His second feature film &quot;Eine alte Liebe&quot; based on a story by Werner Reinowski and released in 1958 did not follow the success of his directorial debut &quot;Zwei Mütter&quot;. His third feature film &quot;Five Cartridges&quot; released in 1960 was a major critical and popular success and made him known in East Germany and abroad. The film was based on a screenplay by Walter Gorrish and tells the story of the members of an international brigade during the Spanish Civil War.
He continued to direct films that focused on anti-fascist themes. The 1962 film &quot;Star-Crossed Lovers&quot; was again based on a screenplay by Walter Gorrish and told the story of the antifascist activist Michael who has to serve in a penal military unit on the Eastern Front during World War II, and escapes with the help of his childhood friend Jürgen. Deserting to the Red army he hopes to meet his childhood friend and love Magdalena in Moscow, as she had fled from Nazi Germany to the Soviet Union. The experimental film made extensive use of flashbacks and extreme angles of view to express the emotions of the characters. His next project was the 1963 film &quot;Naked Among Wolves&quot; based on the 1958 novel of the same name by Bruno Apitz. The film told the story of prisoners in the Buchenwald concentration camp who risk their lives to hide a jewish boy, Stefan Jerzy Zweig. The film is now regarded as a classic anti-fascist DEFA studio films. His next film, the 1963 comedy &quot;Carbide and Sorrel&quot; was a major popular success.

In 1966 Frank Beyer directed the film &quot;Trace of Stones&quot; based on a novel by Erik Neutsch. The film is set in contemporary East Germany and is about the clash between conservative party functionaries, an unconventional and brazen foreman and a young and pragmatic party secretary and engineer on a construction site. Although the premiere at the Worker&#x27;s Film Festival in Potsdam on 15 June 1966 was a success, the film premiere two weeks later in East Berlin caused a major scandal. After a few minutes the screening was interrupted by protests over the depiction of party functionaries in the film. Similar protests occurred during other film screening in East Berlin, Leipzig and Rostock and after three days the film was recalled from distribution and all press coverage ceased except for a harsh film review in Neues Deutschland. Only in 1989 shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall was &quot;Trace of Stones]&quot; shown again publicly in East Germany.

===Work for television (1967–1980)===

Frank Beyer faced severe personal consequences. He had to leave the DEFA studios and was for several years not allowed to direct theatrical films. To &quot;rehabilitate&quot; him the party sent him to Dresden where he worked at the State Theater from 1967 to 1969. As a guest he also worked at the Gerhart-Hauptmann-Theater in Görlitz and Zittau and at the Maxim Gorki Theater in East Berlin.
Despite being banned from directing theatrical films, Frank Beyer was allowed to direct a film for East German television in 1968. The television film &quot;Der Geizige&quot; after the play &quot;The Miser&quot; by Molière was realized with the cast of the State Theater in Dresden. In 1971 he directed the five part television film &quot;Rottenknechte&quot; on the last days of the German navy during World War II, and in 1973 the four part television film &quot;Die sieben Affären der Doña Juanita&quot; with his wife Renate Blume in the leading role. The film, which concentrates on the private and romantic life of a young woman, generated debates on marriage, relationships and socialist moral across the country.

His first theatrical film after almost ten years was &quot;Jacob the Liar&quot; in 1975, adapted from a novel by Jurek Becker and a co-production of the DEFA studios and East German television. The film is set in World War II in German-occupied Poland. It tells the story of the Jewish protagonist Jakob Heym in a Jewish ghetto who pretends to own a radio and being able to receive news from the outside world. The film, which was remade into the Hollywood film Jakob the Liar in 1999, was Frank Beyer&#x27;s biggest critical and popular success. At the 25th Berlin International Film Festival in West Berlin in 1975 the film won a Silver Bear and was nominated for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 49th Academy Awards in 1977. It was East Germany&#x27;s first and only nomination for an Academy Award.

In 1977 he directed the romantic comedy &quot;&quot; again based on a screenplay by Jurek Becker and starring Jutta Hoffmann and Manfred Krug. Shortly before the completion of the production the East German government stripped the singer and dissident Wolf Biermann of his citizenship while he was on a concert tour in West Germany. Frank Beyer, Jurek Becker and the lead actors signed a letter protesting the actions of the East German government. Frank Beyer was reprimanded by the party and prohibited to work for the DEFA studios. Because the lead actor Manfred Krug had applied for permission to leave East Germany, the film was shelved and not shown in theaters. Frank Beyer&#x27;s situation worsened with the television film &quot;Geschlossene Gesellschaft&quot; in 1978. The film, which ostensibly depicts a marriage crisis, was heavily criticized by party functionaries due to a perceived criticism of the socialist society. Frank Beyer was now prohibited from working for television and in 1980 his party membership was suspended.

===Work in East and West (1980–1989)===
Although prohibited to work in East Germany in 1980 Frank Beyer was given permission to work in West Germany. For the West German public broadcaster ARD he directed the television films &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Second Skin&quot; in 1981. In 1982 Frank Beyer was given permission to direct a film in East Germany at the DEFA studios. &quot;The Turning Point&quot; after a novel by Hermann Kant tells the story of a German prisoner of war at the end of World War II who is wrongly accused of being a war criminal. The film was controversial upon release as Polish commentators and officials criticized that the film showed the Polish army wrongly accusing a German soldier of war crimes. The controversy also resulted in a withdrawal of the film from the Berlin International Film Festival, where it was originally planned to be screened and was expected to successfully compete for the awards.

In 1983 he directed the road movie &#x27; which was shot in the USA and in Cuba and was not very successful at the box office after the theatrical release in 1984. For several years, until 1989 Frank Beyer worked on several projects in East and West Germany, with none being realized. He also worked as a director at the political cabaret &quot;Pfeffermühle&quot; in Leipzig. Only in 1988 one of his projects was realized. Together with the screenwriter Wolfgang Kohlhaase he wrote the script to the criminal-comedy film &#x27; based on a true event from post-war Berlin. The film was realized as a co-production between East and West Germany. A popular success in East Germany, the film was a box office disappointment in West Germany.

===Career after 1989===

After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the German reunification Frank Beyer had no problems continuing his work. In 1990 he directed the two part television film &quot;Ende der Unschuld&quot; about German physicists and the development of a German nuclear bomb. In 1991 his last theatrical and DEFA film, &quot;Der Verdacht&quot;, was released. The film is about a love story in East Germany in the 1970s, but was not very successful at the box office.

Since then Frank Beyer had only worked for television. He directed the romantic comedy &#x27; and the comedy &#x27; in 1992. The international co-production &quot;The Last U-Boat&quot; followed in 1993. In the same year he was the Head of the Jury at the 43rd Berlin International Film Festival. He adapted a story by Jurek Becker in 1995 in &quot;Wenn alle Deutschen schlafen&quot; and had a major popular and critical success with the &quot;Nikolaikirche&quot; in 1995. The film concentrated on the last years of East Germany and tells the story of a family that is torn between the protest movement and the Stasi. Another success was the film &quot;Der Hauptmann von Köpenick&quot; based on the play The Captain of Köpenick by Carl Zuckmayer. In 1998 he directed &quot;Abgehauen&quot;, a film about the circumstances of the deprivation of Wolf Biermann&#x27;s citizenship and the departure of Manfred Krug from East Germany. His last project was a film based on the novel &quot;Anniversaries&quot; by Uwe Johnson. He had already developed the project and completed pre-production, but due to conflicts with the producers he was replaced with Margarethe von Trotta. Frank Beyer died after a long illness on 1 October 2006 at the age of 74 in Berlin. He was buried on the Dorotheenstädtischen Cemetery in Berlin.

===Personal life===

In 1956 Frank Beyer married a make-up artist he met at the theater in Altenburg. Their daughter Elke was already born in March 1955. In 1965 they were divorced. In January 1969 he married the actress Renate Blume. Their son Alexander was born in June 1969. They were divorced in spring 1975. Their son Alexander was adopted by Renate Blume&#x27;s second husband, the singer and actor Dean Reed. Under his name Alexander Reed he became an actor, and had minor roles in two of his father&#x27;s films, &quot;Der Hauptmann von Köpenick&quot; in 1997 and &quot;Abgehauen&quot; in 1998. In 1985 Frank Beyer married for a third time. The marriage to the television announcer Monika Unferferth was ended several years later. Until his death he lived together with the poet Karin Kiwus in Berlin.

<doc id="870163" wikidata="Q60525" url="?curid=870163" title="Veit Harlan">
<text>Veit Harlan (22 September 1899 – 13 April 1964) was a German film director and actor. Harlan reached the high point of his career as a director in the Nazi era; most notably his antisemitic film &quot;Jud Süß&quot; (1940) makes him controversial. While viewed critically for his ideologies, a number of critics consider him a capable director on the grounds of such work as &quot;Opfergang&quot; (1944).

==Life and career==
Harlan was born in Charlottenburg, Berlin, the son of the writer Walter Harlan and his wife Adele, nee Boothby. His elder brother Peter was a multi-instrumentalist and musical instrument maker. After studying under Max Reinhardt, he first appeared on the stage in 1915 and, after World War I, worked in the Berlin stage. In 1934 he starred in the Berlin premiere of Eugen Ortner&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Meier Helmbrecht&quot;, but it was a critical disaster and he later described it as his lowest point as an actor. Shortly afterwards he directed his first play, the comedy &quot;Marriage on the Panke&quot;, at the Theater am Schiffbauerdamm.

In 1922 he married Jewish actress and cabaret singer Dora Gerson; the couple divorced in 1924. Gerson later was murdered at Auschwitz with her family. In 1929, he married Hilde Körber, having three children with her, then divorcing her for political reasons related to the influence of Nazism. One of their children, Thomas Harlan, became a writer and director in his own right. In 1939, Veit Harlan married the Swedish actress Kristina Söderbaum, for whom he wrote several tragic roles that included dramatic suicide scenes, increasing their popularity with the German cinema audience. Harlan had two children with Söderbaum.

===Nazi era===
Film critic David Thomson asserts that Harlan, having just started directing in 1935, was able to attract Goebbels&#x27; attention only because so much directorial talent had emigrated from Germany after the Nazis had taken power. By 1937, Joseph Goebbels had appointed Harlan as one of his leading propaganda directors. His most notorious film was &quot;Jud Süß&quot; (1940), made for anti-Semitic propaganda purposes in Germany and Austria. In 1943 it received UFA&#x27;s highest awards. Karsten Witte, the film critic, provided a fitting appellation for Harlan calling him &quot;the baroque fascist&quot;. Harlan made the Reich&#x27;s loudest, most colorful and expensive films.

==Postwar==

After the war Harlan was charged with participating in the anti-Semitic movement and aiding the Nazis. He successfully defended himself by arguing that the Nazis controlled his work, that he was obeying their orders, and that he should not be held personally responsible for the content. In 1949, Harlan was charged with crimes against humanity for his role as director of &quot;Jud Süß&quot;. The Hamburg Criminal Chamber of the Regional Court (&quot;Schwurgericht&quot;) controversially acquitted Harlan of the charges. This decision was upheld by the court of the British occupation zone. Both acquittals remain controversial to this day since the ruling judge had previously worked as a judge for the Nazi regime and since Harlan&#x27;s works had been proven to have contributed hugely to spreading the antisemitic sentiment in Germany, which enabled the Holocaust. Nazi camp guards who watched &quot;Jud Süß&quot;, Jewish survivors told the court, had become crueller towards inmates afterwards, clearly affected by the propaganda contents which made them hate Jews more (although this allegation could not be proved). The film was deemed in one court to be unsuitable and highly problematic and to have contributed to enabling antisemitism and genocide, but neither Harlan nor his antisemitic supporters who insulted Jewish victims in the courts were ever sentenced.

In 1951, Harlan sued for an injunction against Hamburg politician Erich Lüth for publicly calling for a boycott of &quot;Unsterbliche Geliebte&quot; (&quot;Immortal Beloved&quot;). The District Court in Hamburg granted Harlan&#x27;s suit and ordered that Lüth forbear from making such public appeals. However, the lower court decision was overturned in 1958 by the Federal Constitutional Court because it infringed on Lüth&#x27;s right to freedom of expression (). This was a landmark decision because it clarified the importance of the constitutional civil rights in disputes between individuals.

Harlan made a total of nine films between 1950 and 1958. He died in 1964 while on vacation in Capri.

===Family===
Veit Harlan&#x27;s son Thomas (1929–2010), an author and film director, created a semi-documentary film titled &quot;Wundkanal&quot; (&quot;Wound Passage&quot;), in which his father, played by a convicted mass murderer, is forced to undergo a series of brutal interrogations into his war crimes. Thomas Harlan&#x27;s final publication, issued posthumously, &quot;Veit&quot;, was a memoir in the form of a letter to his father, continuing the investigation into Veit Harlan&#x27;s complicity in the Nazi regime.

In 1958, Veit Harlan&#x27;s niece Christiane Susanne Harlan married filmmaker Stanley Kubrick, who was Jewish. She is credited by her stage name Susanne Christian in Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Paths of Glory&quot; (1957). She said she was ashamed to come from a &quot;family of murderers&quot; but was relieved that Kubrick&#x27;s Jewish family accepted her despite her ties to Harlan. They remained married until Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s death in 1999.

Susanne Körber, one of his daughters from his second wife Hilde Körber, converted to Judaism and married the son of Holocaust victims. She committed suicide in 1989.

===Documentaries===

In 2001, made a film titled &quot;Jud Süß – Ein Film als Verbrechen?&quot; (&quot;Jud Süß – A Film as a Crime?&quot;).

The documentary &quot;Harlan – In the Shadow of Jew Süss&quot; (2008) by Felix Moeller explores Harlan&#x27;s motivations and the post-war reaction of his children and grandchildren to his notoriety.

<text>Delitzsch (; Slavic: &quot;delč&quot; or &quot;delcz&quot; for hill) is a town in Saxony in Germany, 20 km north of Leipzig and 30 km east of Halle (Saale). With 24,850 inhabitants at the end of 2015, it is the largest town in the district of Nordsachsen.

Archaeological evidence outside the town limits points to a settlement dating from the Neolithic Age. The first documented mention of Delitzsch dates from 1166 and it later became the Elector of Saxony&#x27;s residence in the 17th and 18th centuries. The old town is well preserved, with several plazas, citizens&#x27; and patrician houses, towers, a baroque castle and the town&#x27;s fortifications.

Delitzsch and its surrounding area contain water areas, hiking and cycling networks and nature reserves.

== Geography==

=== Location ===
Delitzsch is located in the northwestern part of Nordsachsen in Saxony, at an altitude of 94 meters above sea level. Due to its location on the border with Saxony-Anhalt, Delitzsch is the northernmost town in Saxony. It is situated on the north heath and recreation area &quot;Goitzsche&quot; which extends across the Saxony-Saxony-Anhalt border to Bitterfeld-Wolfen. To the east is the spa town of Bad Düben, which is the starting point for the Düben Heath.

The total size of the urban area is . The north–south extension is and the east–west extension . The adjacent communities are Löbnitz, Schönwölkau, Rackwitz and Neukyhna clockwise called from the north of town.

=== Districts ===

== History ==
Delitzsch was founded as a town around 1200 AD (according to chronicles) and became recognized as a city in 1300 AD. Both before and after its founding, the city fought off many invaders: first the Slavic tribes who had lived there before the city was founded and then, later, in the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), the Swedes. A legend arose from this final encounter with the Swedes, saying that when the Swedes reached the river Lober, the tower warden&#x27;s daughter spied them and blew a trumpet, allowing the citizens of the town to get to safety and prepare, and as a result the invaders were defeated. Every year there is a historical medieval style fair to celebrate this victory over the Swedes and, during the fair, shops are open on Sundays.

As a result of the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15, Delitzsch was granted to Prussia from the Kingdom of Saxony. A district of Delitzsch was established for administrative purposes. From 1815 to 1944, Delitzsch was part of the Prussian Province of Saxony, from 1944 to 1945 of the Province of Halle-Merseburg, from 1945 to 1952 of the State of Saxony-Anhalt, from 1952 to 1990 of the Bezirk Leipzig of East Germany and since 1990 of Saxony.

In World War II (1939–1945), only one building, the station, was burned, minimal damage in comparison with many other German urban centers.

According to a 1996 census, Delitzsch had more than 27,000 inhabitants.

In the middle of the main shield of the emblem can be seen in an inclined position as a means to shield Meissen black lion on a golden shield.

<text>The Keith Barret Show is a spoof BBC chat show hosted by Keith Barret (Rob Brydon) who interviews celebrity couples in the hope of finding the secret to a successful marriage (though in fact many of his interviewee couples were not married; see below). It was devised by Paul Duddridge and co-written with Rob Brydon. In each programme, there are a selection of clips from venues such as speed dating or interviews with relationship experts.

Rob Brydon&#x27;s character Keith first appeared on TV in the comedy series &quot;Marion and Geoff&quot; where, for most of the first series, he was oblivious to the affair between the title characters.

<doc id="870171" wikidata="Q3055225" url="?curid=870171" title="Extreme points of Norway">
<text>The extreme points of Norway include the coordinates that are farther north, south, east or west than any other location in Norway; and the highest and the lowest altitudes in the country. The northernmost point is Rossøya on Svalbard, the southernmost is Pysen in Lindesnes Municipality, the easternmost is Kræmerpynten on Svalbard, and the westernmost is Hoybergodden on Jan Mayen. The highest peak is Galdhøpiggen, standing at above mean sea level, while the lowest elevation is sea level at the coast.

The Norwegian Antarctic territories—Bouvet Island, Queen Maud Land and Peter I Island—are not part of the Kingdom of Norway. If included, the Antarctic territories account for the southernmost, easternmost, westernmost and highest extreme points.

The latitude and longitude are expressed in degrees, minutes and seconds, in which an &quot;N&quot; value refers to the northern hemisphere, and an &quot;S&quot; value refers to the southern hemisphere. Similarly, a &quot;E&quot; longitude value refers to the eastern hemisphere, and a &quot;W&quot; refers to the western hemisphere. The extreme points of latitude and longitude are published by the Norwegian Mapping Authority, while the elevations are published by the World Fact Book. Both make use of the World Geodetic System (WGS) 84, a geodetic reference system.

==Latitude and longitude==
For the Kingdom of Norway, the northernmost point is Rossøya, just north of Nordaustlandet on the Svalbard archipelago, bordering the Barents Sea. The southernmost point is Pysen in Lindesnes Municipality bordering Skagerrak—the only latitude and longitude extreme point that is in Norway proper. The easternmost location is Kræmerpynten on Svalbard, bordering the Barents Sea, while the westernmost point is Hoybergodden on Jan Mayen, bordering the Greenland Sea.

All four latitude and longitude extreme points are bordering the sea; due to the geographic nature of the coastline, all extremities are located on islands. Therefore, extreme points of the Norwegian mainland are also included in the list. The northernmost point is Knivskjellodden, located in Magerøya in Finnmark. The northernmost mainland point is Cape Nordkinn, located in Lebesby Municipality, Finnmark; this is also the northernmost location of mainland Europe. Both border the Barents Sea. The southernmost location of Norway proper is Pysen, while the southernmost mainland location the Lindesnes peninsula in Lindesnes Municipality; both border Skagerrak. The easternmost point is Hornøya, with Kibergsneset being the easternmost mainland location. Both are in Vardø Municipality in Finnmark. The westernmost location is Holmebåen in Solund Municipality in Vestland county, while the westernmost mainland location is Vardetangen in Austrheim Municipality, also in Vestland. Both border the North Sea.

If Antarctica is included, the southernmost point is the South Pole. All seven Antarctic claims meet there, so this point borders all other six territories. The easternmost point is the border between Queen Maud Land and the Australian Antarctic Territory, which follows the 45th meridian east. The westernmost point is Peter I Island. As the only Antarctic claim that is not a sector, it borders the Amundsen Sea.

==Altitude==
The highest point in the kingdom is Galdhøpiggen, which, standing at above mean sea level, is located in Lom Municipality. Galdhøpiggen is part of the Jotunheimen mountain range, as well as Jotunheimen National Park. It is also the highest peak along the Scandinavian Mountains. If Antarctica is included, the highest peak is Jøkulkyrkja, standing at . It is located in the Mühlig-Hofmann Mountains in Princess Astrid Coast. Norway&#x27;s lowest point is located on the coast, at sea level. The coast stretches , including fjords, bays and islands.

== Transportation ==

Note that the southernmost point which is reachable without using a boat is in fact not Lindesnes Lighthouse, but a rocky cape in Ytre Farestad on the island Skjernøya. It is not per definition the southernmost mainland point, but can be reached by road Fv230 385.

<doc id="870173" wikidata="Q3714809" url="?curid=870173" title="Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel">
<text>The Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel (DSTT), also referred to as the Metro Bus Tunnel, is a pair of public transit tunnels in Seattle, Washington, United States. The double-track tunnel and its four stations serve Link light rail trains on the 1 Line as it travels through Downtown Seattle. It runs west under Pine Street from 9th Avenue to 3rd Avenue, and south under 3rd Avenue to South Jackson Street. 1 Line trains continue north from the tunnel to Lynnwood City Center and south through the Rainier Valley past Seattle–Tacoma International Airport to Angle Lake station as part of Sound Transit&#x27;s light rail network.

The DSTT was used only by buses from its opening in 1990 until 2005, and shared by buses and light rail from 2009 until 2019. Bus routes from King County Metro and Sound Transit Express left the tunnel north via Interstate 5, south via the SODO Busway, or east via Interstate 90. It was owned by King County Metro and shared with Sound Transit through a joint-operating agreement signed in 2002; Sound Transit assumed full ownership in 2022. The Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel was one of two tunnels in the United States shared by buses and trains, the other being the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel in Pittsburgh, and was the only one in the United States with shared stations.

Though proposals for a rapid transit tunnel under 3rd Avenue were introduced in the 1910s and 1920s, planning for the modern bus and rail Metro Bus Tunnel only began in 1974. The King County Metro Council approved the bus tunnel proposal in November 1983, but construction did not begin until March 1987. The tunnel between Convention Place and Westlake stations was built using the cut-and-cover method, closing Pine Street for 19 months and disrupting access to the retail core. The segment from Westlake to the International District was bored with two tunnel-boring machines, heading north from Union Station and finishing within a month of each other. Tests of normal buses and the Breda dual-mode buses built specifically for tunnel routes began in March 1989; tunnel construction was declared complete in June 1990, at a cost of $469 million. Light rail tracks were installed in anticipation of future rapid transit service through the tunnel, but were later found to be poorly insulated and unusable for Link light rail. Soft openings and public previews of the five tunnel stations were held from August 1989 to September 1990, with regular bus service beginning on September 15, carrying 28,000 daily passengers in its first year of operation. For the next several years, until June 2004, service in the tunnel was provided exclusively by dual-mode buses, which ran as trolleybuses in the tunnellike the city&#x27;s extensive trolleybus systemand as diesel buses on surface streets and freeways.

The tunnel was closed on September 24, 2005, for modification to accommodate both buses and Sound Transit&#x27;s Central Link (now the 1 Line) light rail trains with shared lanes and platforms. The roadway was lowered by and other improvements were made to prepare for light rail service. New hybrid electric buses were moved into the tunnel to replace the Breda fleet, as the overhead wire was replaced for light rail trains. The tunnel reopened on September 24, 2007, and light rail service began on July 18, 2009. A stub tunnel, branching from the main tunnel, was constructed under Pine Street to allow light rail trains to stop and reverse direction; it was later used as the first segment of a light rail extension to Capitol Hill and the University of Washington that opened in 2016. Convention Place station was closed permanently on July 21, 2018, to make way for an expansion of the Washington State Convention Center that would also restrict bus access to the tunnel. On March 23, 2019, bus service in the tunnel ceased and its remaining seven routes were moved to surface streets.

==Route and stations==
The , tunnel is used by the 1 Line between Westlake and International District/Chinatown stations. Entrances at several tunnel stations are built into nearby buildings with variable-message signs over the stairs and elevators leading to the mezzanines. A total of 11 wheelchair-accessible elevators connect the tunnel stations to the surface. The deepest of the tunnel stations are below street level and consist of two side platforms, two tracks, and a former bus passing lane in the middle. Since 2019, the stations have also had signs with numbered exits to aid in rider wayfinding. As part of the city&#x27;s public art program that began in 1973, the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel and its stations were furnished with $1.5 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) in artwork by 25 artists commissioned by King County Metro.

The northern portal, formerly accessible to buses at street level from Olive Way, and from Interstate 5 via an express lane ramp, was the former Convention Place station at the intersection of 9th Avenue and Pine Street near the Washington State Convention Center. Until its closure in 2018, Convention Place was the only bus-exclusive station in the tunnel, and consisted of four sheltered platforms in a sunken, open-air layover space below street level. Buses entered the tunnel from 9th Avenue and passed under the historic Camlin Hotel, before joining the University Link Tunnel used by light rail trains headed north for three blocks under Pine Street to Capitol Hill station.

The DSTT enters Westlake station under Pine Street between 3rd and 6th avenues, located between the Westlake Center shopping mall and Westlake Park. The station features a two-block-long mezzanine with exits to Pine Street and several retailers, including the Westlake Center, the former The Bon Marché flagship store, and the Nordstrom Building, as well as the former King County Metro customer service center. The area around the station is known as the Westlake Hub, with connections to the South Lake Union Streetcar and the Seattle Center Monorail as well as the King County Metro and Sound Transit buses. Leaving Westlake Station, the bored set of twin tunnels turn south under Century Square to follow 3rd Avenue and its transit mall through the central business district, parallel to the shoreline of Elliott Bay.

Three blocks south of Pine Street, buses and trains enter Symphony station, located between Union and Seneca streets adjacent to Benaroya Hall and 1201 Third Avenue in the financial district. The station has a split mezzanine, with entrances to 2nd Avenue and University Street accessible from the north half, and an entrance to Seneca Street from the south half. From Symphony, the tunnel continues under 3rd Avenue for five blocks, entering the Pioneer Square neighborhood and historic district. At this point, 3rd Avenue passes several of Seattle&#x27;s skyscrapers, including the historic Seattle Tower, Safeco Plaza, the Fourth and Madison Building and the Wells Fargo Center. Within Symphony station, the tunnel passes over the century-old Great Northern Tunnel with a clearance of .

Pioneer Square station is located between Cherry Street and Yesler Way, with four entrances to nearby streets and Prefontaine Place serving two mezzanines. The station serves the administrative centers of the Seattle and King County governments, located within walking distance of Seattle City Hall, the Seattle Municipal Tower, the King County Courthouse and the King County Administration Building, as well as other major buildings, including Smith Tower, Columbia Center and the Alaska Building. From Pioneer Square, the tunnel travels down a 5.5% grade to cross under the Great Northern Tunnel at a 45-degree angle near the intersection of 4th Avenue South and South Washington Street, briefly descending below sea level, before turning cardinal south into the International District neighborhood.

International District/Chinatown station, the southernmost tunnel station, is partially open-air and located immediately below a public plaza at Union Station. The station has connections to Amtrak and Sounder commuter rail at King Street Station a block to the west, accessible through the Weller Street Bridge, as well as the First Hill Streetcar on Jackson Street, stopping east of 5th Avenue South. Other attractions near the station include Lumen Field to the west and Uwajimaya a block to the southeast. South of the station, the light rail tracks and bus lanes were formerly separated by railway signals at an underground bus layover and staging area next to the tunnel comfort room for bus drivers. The southern portal of the tunnel is located under the intersection of Airport Way and 5th Avenue South at the western terminus of the former Interstate 90 express lanes for high-occupancy vehicles. Until bus operations ceased, southbound routes continued from the tunnel in separated lanes on the SODO Busway, while eastbound buses used a set of ramps that traveled onto the Interstate 90 express lanes. The eastbound ramps will be retrofitted for the East Link light rail service that begins in 2025 on the 2 Line.

==Service==
The Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel is part of the &quot;Third Avenue Transit Spine&quot;, the busiest transit corridor in Seattle, serving a combined average of 54,000 weekday riders with bus stops on the surface. The tunnel has a theoretical capacity of 40 trains per hour per direction with a minimum of 90-second headways, carrying 22,000 passengers per hour per direction, but is only able to carry 12,000 per hour per direction in 4-car light rail vehicles with current systems in place. Prior to the start of Link light rail service, the DSTT could serve up to 145 buses during the afternoon rush hour. , the DSTT carried 52,600 daily riders, of which 10,000 are on light rail.

The tunnel carries a segment of the 1 Line, which runs for from Lynnwood City Center station through the University of Washington, Downtown Seattle, and the Rainier Valley, and terminates at Angle Lake station near Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. Trains serve all downtown tunnel stations 20 hours a day every day; during regular weekday service, trains run roughly every six to 10 minutes during rush hour and midday operation, respectively, with longer headways of 15 minutes in the early morning and 20 minutes at night. During weekends, 1 Line trains arrive every 10 minutes during midday hours and every 15 minutes during mornings and evenings. Light rail service from Westlake to International District/Chinatown takes approximately seven minutes.

Prior to the cessation of bus service in March 2019, the DSTT was served by seven bus routes that stopped at all four tunnel stations as well as stops near the former Convention Place station. At each station, bus routes were divided into three bays labeled with their general direction. Bay A was served by three routes heading north toward Northgate and the University District and east to Kirkland via State Route 520; Bay C was served by three routes heading south through the SODO Busway toward the Rainier Valley and Renton; and Bay D was served by a single route, Sound Transit Express route 550, heading east to Mercer Island and Bellevue via Interstate 90.

During closures of the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, tunnel buses were rerouted onto 2nd and 4th Avenues between Yesler Way and Pine Street, and Stewart Street and Olive Way between 2nd and Boren Avenues. Metro also runs a special route, the Route 97 Link Shuttle, between all Link light rail stations during service disruptions.

==Operations==

The DSTT is open for 20 hours on weekdays and Saturdays, from 5:00 am to 1:00 am the following day, and for 18 hours on Sundays, from 6:00 am to midnight. At the time of its opening in 1990, the Metro Bus Tunnel only operated from 5:00 am to 7:00 pm on weekdays and 10:00 am to 6:00 pm on Saturdays, with no Sunday service; the operating hours were temporarily extended into weekday nights from 1998 to 2000 at the request of the Seattle Seahawks and Seattle Mariners, but were cut after the passage of Initiative 695 and subsequent loss of motor vehicle excise tax revenue. Preparations for Link light rail service restored late-night and full weekend hours for the tunnel, introduced in June 2009 after Sound Transit Express route 550 moved all of its trips into the tunnel.

Coordination between trains in the tunnel is managed by the Link Light Rail Operations Control Center (OCC), located at the King County Metro Communication and Control Center in SoDo. The OCC controls vehicle movements (and formerly operations between buses and trains) by using on-board radio-frequency identification tags installed on tunnel buses and light rail vehicles, their locations tracked by passing over induction loops embedded in the tunnel roadway. Signals at each station indicate when a driver can proceed through the tunnel. Within the DSTT, speed limits are set at in stations and staging areas and between stations. During joint operations, Light rail trains and buses were required to wait in the tunnels between stations until the platform was cleared of vehicles ahead; buses were mandated to keep a minimum of six seconds of separation between each other.

During joint bus–rail operations, two types of vehicles were used in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel: Sound Transit&#x27;s Kinkisharyo-Mitsui light rail vehicles and King County Metro&#x27;s New Flyer diesel-electric hybrid buses. The New Flyer buses, dubbed &quot;tunnel buses&quot; by King County Metro, were ordered in 2004 to replace a fleet of Breda dual-mode electric trolleybuses whose overhead wire was to be removed in the tunnel&#x27;s renovation for light rail; 59 of the dual-mode Breda coaches were converted into fully electric trolleybuses between 2004 and 2007 and moved to surface routes, where they continued to operate for more than a decade before being fully replaced in 2016. The New Flyer low-floor, articulated buses feature a &quot;hush mode&quot; that allowed buses to operate solely on stored electric power within the tunnel, minimizing emissions and noise.

==History==

===Previous subway proposals===

Several proposals for a cut-and-cover subway tunnel under 3rd Avenue in Downtown Seattle were presented to the City of Seattle by predecessors of the Seattle Planning Commission throughout the 20th century. The first major proposal was part of urban planner Virgil Bogue&#x27;s &quot;Plan for Seattle&quot; in 1911, as Route 1 of a proposed rapid transit network. Route 1 ran southeast on 3rd Avenue from a circular ring around a proposed civic center in the Denny Regrade neighborhood to King Street Station, paralleled to the west by a subway on 1st Avenue known as Route 17; stations on the line were to have additional entrances from department stores and other major businesses on 3rd Avenue. The plan was supported by City Engineer Reginald H. Thomson and the Municipal League among others, but opposed by businesses fearing it would shift the commercial district further north, and by the three daily newspapers published in Seattle. A special municipal election for the comprehensive plan was held on March 5, 1912, in which Seattle voters rejected it by a 10,000-vote margin.

Although Bogue&#x27;s proposal was ultimately rejected, some elements of the plan were independently studied by others, including a rapid transit subway in Downtown Seattle. In 1920, City Engineer Arthur H. Dimmock published a report recommending a rapid transit system for the city of Seattle, centered around a cut-and-cover subway tunnel under 3rd Avenue from Virginia Street to Yesler Way. The line was to connect to surface and elevated lines at Dexter Avenue, Olive Way and South Jackson Street, serving the neighborhoods of Fremont, Eastlake, Capitol Hill, and North Delridge in West Seattle. The proposal, which was expected not to be acted upon for at least 15 years, gained little support, and was called a project of &quot;purely academic interest&quot; by Mayor Hugh M. Caldwell, who doubted that any rapid transit proposal would be seriously considered during his term. The Seattle City Planning Commission proposed its own rapid transit system in 1926, centered on an elevated line over Western Avenue with a possible parallel subway under 3rd Avenue from Yesler Way to Pike Street. The Seattle Traffic Research Commission published a report in 1928 recommending a subway under 2nd Avenue from King Street Station to Pike Street as part of a longer rapid transit line serving the University District and Fremont. In the late 1950s, the Seattle Transit Commission proposed building a rapid transit system on the existing right-of-way used by Interstate 5 between Tacoma, Seattle and Everett, with a two-station subway under 5th Avenue in Downtown Seattle.

The most significant rapid transit proposal came as part of the Forward Thrust initiatives of the late 1960s, which was centered around a downtown subway under 3rd Avenue. The subway would be fed by lines from Ballard, Lake City, the University District, Capitol Hill, Bellevue, and Renton, combining for a planned minimum headway of minutes at rush hour, minutes during midday, and five minutes at all other times. The stations on 3rd Avenue were to be situated at South Jackson Street and 5th Avenue South, James and Cherry streets, Seneca and Spring streets, and Pike and Pine streets, all planned to open by 1985 and operated by the Municipality of Metropolitan Seattle. Seattle voters were asked to provide $385 million (equivalent to $ in dollars), to supplement a $765 million grant (equivalent to $ in dollars) from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration (UMTA), during a municipal election on February 13, 1968, narrowly passing the bond by 50.8%, but falling short of the required 60 percent supermajority. A second attempt on May 19, 1970, with an adjusted $440 million local contribution (equivalent to $ in dollars) and $881 million federal grant (equivalent to $ in dollars), failed to pass with only 46% approval amid a local recession caused by layoffs at Boeing; the earmarked funds intended for the Forward Thrust rapid transit project were instead allocated to Atlanta, to build its rapid transit system.

===Bus tunnel proposal and approval===

The concept of a downtown bus tunnel was first proposed in 1974 during discussions between Governor Dan Evans and Seattle Mayor Wes Uhlman about regional transportation projects in response to the proposed extension of Interstate 90 into Seattle via a third floating bridge crossing Lake Washington. Metro Transit later commissioned a study into the bus tunnel, released the following July, which determined that it would not be able to adequately meet the rush hour demand of downtown bus ridership by 1980. The study suggested that a double-decked tunnel with automated guideway transit to complement bus service, running from Union Station to the Seattle Center, would be able to meet projected demand at an estimated cost of $450 million. Ultimately, the plan was rejected because of the high cost of ventilation for diesel buses that would use the tunnel. The bus tunnel proposal resurfaced in 1979, outlining a tunnel from South Jackson Street to Pine Street that would carry 200 buses an hour in each direction at a cost of up to $350 million with the option of conversion for electric rail transit in the future. The tunnel was suggested by Metro officials and engineering consultants Parsons Brinckerhoff as a solution to worsening downtown traffic, and was better received than alternative concepts. The proposal gained further support from Metro Transit in its long-term &quot;Metro 1990&quot; plan, adopted in 1981, as a transit mall or tunnel under 3rd Avenue carrying buses that could be converted for a light rail system. The Puget Sound Council of Governments (PSCOG), a regional planning agency, endorsed Metro Transit&#x27;s proposal and integrated the tunnel into its proposed light rail line connecting Seattle to Snohomish County.

The Metro Transit Committee debated the inclusion of the bus tunnel in the project&#x27;s environmental impact assessment well into 1983, Seattle members opposing the tunnel in favor of a transit mall and suburban members supporting a bus tunnel that would be converted to a light rail system. On September 22, UMTA requested that a preferred alternative be declared by the end of November, which prompted the Metro Council to expedite its decision. Metro Council Executive Director Neil Peterson favored the tunnel alternative, while the Seattle City Council and Mayor Charles Royer preferred the transit mall, but stated that a tunnel would be a long-term solution to downtown congestion. The Seattle City Council reversed its decision on their preferred alternative, voting unanimously on October 17 in favor of an electric-only transit tunnel. Along with Mayor Royer, they were willing to compromise on Peterson&#x27;s proposed dual-mode buses to serve suburban commuters where trolleybuses were not feasible. The Metro Council approved the downtown bus tunnel by a unanimous vote on November 3, 1983, estimating a cost of $300 million to build a five-station tunnel under 3rd Avenue and Pine Street to be completed in 1989 along with the conversion of 3rd Avenue into a landscaped transit mall.

===Planning, funding and design===

Metro unveiled its preliminary plans for the bus tunnel in January 1984, selecting five sites for stations along 3rd Avenue and Pine Street: at Union Station, the King County Courthouse, between Seneca and Union streets, at the Westlake Mall, and near the Washington State Convention Center. The Burlington Northern Railroad opposed Metro&#x27;s preference for the tunnel to cross the existing Great Northern Tunnel by going under it, the agency stating that passing over would require a cut-and-cover tunnel that would disrupt City Hall Park. The following month, Metro announced that it would use a fleet of 200 dual-mode buses for the first decade of tunnel operations, with an eventual switch to subway trains. The bored tunnel would be able to carry 180 buses an hour in each direction, serving either a wide island platform or two smaller side platforms that would be dug out from the surface. In April, Metro published the draft environmental impact statement for the tunnel project, estimating a cost of $387 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars) and a completion date of June 1989. The cost of the project drew criticism at public hearings for using a significant portion of Metro&#x27;s capital budget, a total of $840 million from sales tax revenue approved by voters in 1980, as well as potential disruption to business during the cut-and-cover construction of the stations and Pine Street segment of the tunnel.

UMTA ranked Metro&#x27;s bus tunnel project as first among transit projects favored to receive federal funding in 1985, despite its reliance on unproven dual-mode buses. Metro tested a prototype Renault PER 180 dual-mode trolleybus in 1983, describing it as problematic after finding it exceeded freeway axle load limits by and having to replace several parts after several mechanical failures. Congress later appropriated $20 million to the City of Seattle for the bus tunnel project in October 1984, allowing for right-of-way acquisition to begin, but the funds were withheld until restrictions on new transit projects were lifted by the United States Senate the following May.

The Downtown Transit Project subcommittee unanimously approved Metro recommendations that would reduce the number of bus tunnel stations from six to five, saving $35 million, as well as opting for tunnel boring machines for the 3rd Avenue segment to minimize surface-level disruptions that would be present from cut-and-cover excavation. Stations would be located at Union Station south of Jackson Street, under 3rd Avenue and James Street, under 3rd Avenue and University Street, at the Westlake Mall and at 9th Avenue and Pine Street near the Washington State Convention Center. The Metro Council approved the station sites and use of tunnel-boring machines in July 1985, proceeding with final design by approving a $25.9 million contract with Parsons Brinckerhoff for engineering work related to the project.

In March 1986, the federal government offered Metro a contract committing $195 million in UMTA funding toward the bus tunnel, requiring that a decision on whether to move forward with the project be made by December 31. A month later, the King County Council asked Metro to consider delaying construction of the bus tunnel while waiting for assurance on federal funding being able to cover half of the $395 million cost of the project; the council was scheduled to begin awarding contracts for utility relocation along 3rd Avenue and Pine Street in preparation for tunnel construction. On May 15, the Reagan administration signed a contract with Metro to commit $197 million of the $395 million required for the bus tunnel project, assuming re-authorization of a mass transit grant program by Congress, while also extending the deadline for a final decision to September 1987. Hours later, the Metro Council awarded the first construction contract for utility relocation, with construction set to begin in July. The Metro Council accepted the UMTA contract during their June 5 meeting, allowing for bidding on tunnel construction to begin. The tunnel construction contract was awarded to the joint venture of Guy F. Atkinson Construction and Dillingham Construction in late September for $44.16 million, beating seven competing bids with an estimate far lower than the approximately $61 million predicted by Metro engineers. The contract for the dual-mode trolleybuses was awarded by the Metro Council to Breda Costruzioni Ferroviarie in October, consisting of an order for 236 buses at a cost of $133 million (equivalent to $ million in dollars); it was approved by UMTA in November.

===Construction===
Construction on the bus tunnel project began with partial closures of 3rd Avenue in July 1986 for utility relocation, narrowing traffic to one lane in either direction and restricting traffic to buses and emergency vehicles during rush hour. To prepare for extended periods of service disruption on 3rd Avenue, Metro Transit also moved its electric trolleybus routes onto 1st Avenue.

Excavation of the 3rd Avenue tunnel segment began with the ceremonial launch of the &quot;Mighty Mole&quot;, a , tunnel boring machine (TBM), on March 6, 1987. The TBM, designed by Robbins Company of Kent, Washington, and built by Nicholson Manufacturing in Seattle, began digging the western tunnel from Union Station the following May. A second, identical &quot;Mighty Mole&quot; TBM began digging the parallel eastern tunnel on June 29. During tunnel boring under 3rd Avenue between Spring Street and Madison Street on October 21, a small earthflow damaged a water main and caused pavement on 3rd Avenue to drop , shutting down water in the nearby Seattle City Light and 1001 Fourth Avenue Plaza buildings. While repairing the broken water main, electricians working on damaged high-voltage cables caused a small power outage that affected eight downtown buildings on the night of October 28, but were able to restore power by the following morning. Work on the western tunnel was briefly interrupted in November, when the TBM hit an unexpectedly large pocket of loose sand under Madison Street that had to be stabilized with grout to prevent damage to the adjacent Seattle City Light building. Boring on both tunnels was stopped in early January 1988, when a pocket of wet sand was encountered before the planned 90-degree turn onto Pine Street. Metro and tunnel contractors Atkinson/Dillingham, who had scheduled tunnel excavation for completion in mid-January, closed 3rd Avenue between Pike and Pine streets and installed 40 drilled wells to remove water from the sand pocket in February. Digging resumed on the western tunnel on March 14, and the TBM reached Westlake station on April 9, completing the first of the two tunnels. The eastern tunnel was completed a month later on May 18, allowing for parts of the TBMs to be salvaged and the steel outer shells to be buried in the tunnel.

The Pine Street segment of the tunnel was planned to be dug cut-and-cover from the surface. In preparation for utility relocation work on Pine Street, Metro moved 36 bus routes serving the corridor to other east–west streets in February 1987. On April 27, excavation of the tunnel began with the closure of Pine Street, and its offramp to Interstate 5, to automobile traffic between 3rd Avenue and Boren Avenue. Workers finished digging in late August, allowing the project to progress to concrete pouring for the roadway. Pine Street was briefly re-opened for the Christmas shopping season beginning November 1 at the request of downtown merchants, with a temporary surface laid over backfill for automobiles and pedestrians. On January 4, the street was closed to automobile traffic once again, along with the intersection of 5th Avenue and Pine Street and the Pike Street offramp of I-5, to install utility lines and a permanent roadway. Pine Street was fully reopened to traffic on November 1, 1988, coinciding with the completion of Westlake Park and the Westlake Center shopping mall, a year ahead of schedule.

By October 1988, Metro reported that 53% of major construction was complete and anticipated that the tunnel would be completed in May 1990 and opened for service in September 1990. Seattle Mayor Norm Rice and City Council members Paul Kraabel and George Benson recommended a limited opening of the tunnel for the 1990 Goodwill Games to be held in July, but Metro rejected the proposal so that the safety systems of the tunnel could be tested adequately before service began. Testing in the bus tunnel began with a ceremonial first run on March 15, 1989, first with a diesel bus and then one of the Breda dual-mode trolleybuses operating in diesel mode, as the overhead trolley wires had not yet been installed. Wooden planks and steel plates covered slots in the concrete roadway where rails would be installed later. Local media were given a tour the next day. By January 1990, the tunnel stations were declared &quot;nearly complete&quot;, with only minor work still left for contractors. Murals and other interactive art installations were placed in the nearly complete stations from December 1989 onward, as part of a $1.5 million arts program. Tunnel construction was finished on June 7, 1990, leaving Metro to test safety systems and train personnel for regular service to begin in September.

The initial cost of the tunnel project was estimated in 1984 to be $334.6 million, but the final costs rose 56% over budget to a total of $468.7 million (equivalent to $ in dollars); the project&#x27;s cost overruns were blamed on unanticipated soil conditions on the approach to Pine Street from 3rd Avenue, complaints and payouts to downtown businesses disrupted by tunnel construction, and the death of an electrician during construction. Excavated dirt from the project was used as fill for runway expansion at Paine Field in nearby Everett.

====South African granite scandal====

A minor scandal involving the bus tunnel project emerged in late 1988, over the discovery that granite to be used by Metro in the tunnel&#x27;s stations had been sourced from South Africa. The Verde Fontaine granite was quarried in South Africa, which had been under Apartheid rule at the time, but was cut and finished in Italy, allowing for it to be approved despite the Metro Council&#x27;s ongoing boycott of South African goods. The Verde Fontaine granite was selected for use as benches and interior walls in Westlake and Pioneer Square stations by architecture firm TRA; Metro was unaware that Verde Fontaine was only quarried in South Africa. The granite&#x27;s origin was discovered by an activist from the Black Contractors Coalition in late 1988, who notified Metro and members of the Metro Council. Metro determined that replacing the of granite would cost $500,000 and delay both stations but would not delay the planned 1990 opening and would be covered by contingency funds in the project&#x27;s budget.

During a press conference on January 25, 1989, Metro Director Alan Gibbs confirmed that the granite had been quarried in South Africa and announced that an investigative report would be delivered to the Metro Council Transit Committee the following week. The announcement was met with calls from King County Councilman Ron Sims to fire the responsible Metro officials who knowingly allowed the purchase. Metro&#x27;s ban on South African goods was stricter than the federal sanctions, which only prohibited importation of specific materials such as steel, coal, uranium and agricultural products, and was used by UMTA to threaten to pull its funding for the bus tunnel project.

A report by the Metro Council Rules Committee delivered in March stated that the granite&#x27;s origin was discovered in early 1988, and was authorized by tunnel superintendent David Kalberer with the assumption that only a small amount would be used to furnish University Street station (now Symphony station). Kalberer, who received praise for his work on the project before the scandal, admitted that the failure to consult the Metro Council&#x27;s tunnel subcommittee before signing off on the deal was his mistake. Metro Director Alan Gibbs resigned on February 23 as a result of the scandal and was succeeded by technical director Richard Sandaas in September. The granite was rejected by Metro and was returned to the supplier in Italy.

Before this discovery, in September 1987, African-American rights groups had forced tunnel contractor Atkinson/Dillingham to return 36 steel beams from South Africa used for temporary shoring at Pioneer Square station. This led Metro Director Alan Gibbs to propose a ban on South African materials by Metro for its projects, which was adopted by a resolution of the Metro Council on September 17.

===Opening and bus-only operation===

Regular service in the bus tunnel began on September 15, 1990, on five routes serving the University District, North Seattle, and Renton. The limited service was the result of delays in the manufacturing of dual-mode buses from Breda, which were fully delivered in 1991. The opening was preceded by soft openings of each individual station, beginning with Westlake station in August 1989, and ending with Convention Place station the day before the beginning of service. A ceremonial walk and run was held on September 9, 1990, and attracted 5,000 participants.

In its first year of operations, the bus tunnel carried 28,000 daily passengers on 688 scheduled bus trips. The tunnel reduced the number of buses operated on 3rd Avenue at peak hours from 190 to 86, with 20 Metro routes using the tunnel. &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; called it a &quot;qualified success&quot;, commenting that the tunnel was like a &quot;mini-subway system&quot;. The paper&#x27;s editorial board also requested that Metro expand tunnel hours to keep buses running for late-night workers and entertainment events held on weekends. On December 9, 1991, the SODO Busway opened, extending bus service from the tunnel into SODO and moving southbound routes off Interstate 5. Direct access from Interstate 90 to the bus tunnel was opened in February 1992 as part of a reversible express lane system for the new floating bridge.

The first use of the tunnel by Sound Transit buses began on September 18, 1999, with the takeover of Metro&#x27;s Seattle–Bellevue express route, which was renumbered from 226 to 550. To operate buses in the tunnel, Sound Transit leased 20 dual-mode buses from Metro, repainted them in the agency&#x27;s colors, and contracted with Metro to operate the route along with other Sound Transit Express routes in King County.

===Renovation for light rail===
From the outset, the bus tunnel was intended to be converted for light rail trains at some point in the future. Metro approved the addition of tracks to the bus tunnel in 1988, appropriating half of the $5 million used to install them during tunnel construction, the remainder coming from federal sources. To save $1.5 million in costs, Metro eliminated most of the rail&#x27;s electrical insulation, which would later render them unusable for rail service.

A regional transit authority was formed in the early 1990s to build and operate a light rail system that would use the bus tunnel within Downtown Seattle. The authority, later named Sound Transit, gained voter approval in November 1996 to build a $3.9 billion system between Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, Downtown Seattle, and the University District. In 1998, Sound Transit found that the rails in the tunnel would need to be replaced at a cost of up to $110 million and require a full closure for two years. The plan would also require the purchase of new hybrid electric buses to replace the Breda fleet, as the electrical systems were incompatible. Convention Place station would have to be abandoned as it was too shallow to support a northern extension under Interstate 5.

Sound Transit approved its route for the light rail project, named Central Link (now the 1 Line), in November 1999, including four of the five stations in the downtown transit tunnel (excluding Convention Place). King County Executive Ron Sims proposed transferring ownership of the tunnel, along with $130 million in debt and liabilities for maintenance and operations, from King County Metro to Sound Transit in 2004. The two agencies signed an agreement in May 2000 that formally transferred ownership and responsibility for the tunnel to Sound Transit, in exchange for $195.6 million paid to King County Metro. Metro would retain ownership of Convention Place station and other assets, while Sound Transit would convert the tunnel to rail operation after 2004.

Sound Transit underwent a funding crisis in 2001 after the Central Link light rail project was found to be over budget and would not be able to open until 2009, three years later than planned. The light rail project was truncated to Westlake station in Downtown Seattle and to Tukwila, the sections north of downtown and south to the airport being deferred to a later date. The King County Council called for a new agreement to be negotiated with Sound Transit adding requirements for an adopted plan for light rail service to Northgate, and for a study into new riders that light rail would bring to the tunnel over a conventional bus network. In early 2002, Sound Transit also explored, and ultimately rejected, a proposal to build a parallel, rail-only tunnel under 5th Avenue that would cost $1 billion.

Sound Transit and the King County Council signed a new joint-operations agreement in June 2002, leaving King County Metro as owners of the tunnel and Sound Transit responsible for paying part of the tunnel&#x27;s debt service at an estimated cost of $65 million. The agreement would allow for buses and light rail trains to share the tunnel and its stations beginning in 2009, after a two-year closure for renovations. A separate agreement signed in May 2003 selected King County Metro as the operator of the light rail line.

Metro began testing a fleet of new hybrid diesel-electric buses in 2002, intending to use them in the bus tunnel before and after the conversion to joint bus-rail operations. The first few of a planned fleet of 235 hybrid diesel-electric articulated buses began operating on tunnel bus routes in June 2004. The Breda dual-mode trolleybuses were removed from the tunnel in January 2005 and would later be refurbished into electric-only trolleybuses for use on the city&#x27;s trolleybus network. The last day of trolleybus operation in the tunnel was January 24, 2005, with only a single dual-mode bus in service on the final day.

In February 2004, Sound Transit announced that it would begin the closure and renovation of the bus tunnel in September 2005, two years earlier than scheduled, to save money and reduce construction delays. Construction of a stub tunnel under Pine Street near Convention Place station, to be used for light rail train storage and turnback, as well as a future extension to Capitol Hill, began in January 2005. The bus tunnel was closed on September 24, 2005, moving the tunnel&#x27;s 21 routes and 140 buses per hour to surface streets. 3rd Avenue was converted to a &quot;transit-priority corridor&quot; during peak periods, restricting general traffic to one-block travel.

The $82.7 million construction contract for the transit tunnel renovation was awarded to Balfour Beatty in August 2004, 12 percent below Sound Transit&#x27;s estimates. The majority of the cost was paid by Sound Transit and supplemented by $8.1 million from King County Metro. As part of the renovations, the tunnel&#x27;s roadway was lowered by to allow for level boarding, required by the Americans with Disabilities Act; as a result, Metro added strobe lights to bus mirrors, which were lowered to head height, and added warning signs. New electrical, mechanical, and emergency systems were installed, along with a new communications system connecting to a joint-operations center. The project ended up costing $94 million in total, 3.4 percent over the budget set in 2004. During the closure, Metro found that average travel time through downtown increased only 11 percent during the afternoon peak period, and ridership on popular routes only dropped slightly.

===Joint bus and train operations===

The tunnel reopened to service on September 24, 2007, with tunnel routes modified to group common destinations together. Initially, the reopened tunnel was in use only on weekdays, with Saturday operation not yet reinstated. Stations were given new entrance signs, lighting fixtures, electronic passenger information signs, and restored paint. The peak bus-only restrictions on 3rd Avenue remained in place after the reopening, along with the skip-stop service that Metro implemented on the street. The tunnel was temporarily closed for nine days in December after a computer glitch disrupted the tunnel&#x27;s new emergency-control system, which was repaired and replaced. The tunnel had remained closed on weekends after its reopening, but Saturday operation was reinstated and Sunday operation was introduced in May 2009.

Simulated light rail testing in the tunnel also began on May 20, 2009, with two-car trains operating alongside in-service buses, making it the first joint bus and rail tunnel with stations in the United States; the Mount Washington Transit Tunnel, a joint bus and rail tunnel in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, had already been in operation but lacked underground stations. Service on the Central Link light rail line began on July 18, 2009, operating from Westlake station in the tunnel to Tukwila International Boulevard station near the airport. Light rail service was extended north from Westlake to University of Washington station (via Capitol Hill station) on March 19, 2016, coinciding with the moving of several bus routes out of the tunnel to accommodate increased train frequencies. The ramp from International District/Chinatown station to the Interstate 90 express lanes was closed in September 2018 as part of preparations for East Link construction.

===End of bus service===

In November 2015, King County Metro signed a $147 million agreement to sell Convention Place station to the Washington State Convention Center for redevelopment. The convention center plans to build a new expansion on the property, necessitating the closure of the station and transit tunnel to buses earlier than planned. In 2017, Sound Transit and the Seattle Department of Transportation announced that the tunnel would become rail-only in 2019, two years sooner than the planned switch in 2021 to coincide with the opening of the Northgate Link Extension. Convention Place station was permanently closed on July 21, 2018, and was replaced with a set of bus stops on 9th Avenue and a new tunnel access ramp.

Bus service in the tunnel ended on March 23, 2019, with a ceremonial trip by a preserved Breda dual-mode bus at 1 a.m. The remaining 830 bus trips through the tunnel, serving approximately 37,000 riders on seven routes, were redirected onto surface corridors on 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th avenues. Metro and the city government also increased surface street capacity for buses by introducing all-door boarding for all 3rd Avenue and Westlake Avenue routes at 31 stops, improving signal timing, and adding a new northbound bus lane on 5th and 6th avenues.

During early 2020, Sound Transit built connections to East Link at International District/Chinatown station. Over a ten-week period that began in January 2020, four-car trains ran on a single track within the tunnel, with through-passengers transferring at Pioneer Square station via a temporary center platform, reducing frequency to 13–15 minutes. The tunnel was also closed for four weekends until work was completed in late March, after a week-long delay in testing. Frequency restrictions brought on by the project remained due to the coronavirus pandemic and local shutdowns. Sound Transit originally planned to assume full ownership of the tunnel in 2020, but later delayed plans due to the COVID-19 pandemic and issues with station escalators. The 36 escalators serving the downtown tunnel stations, which suffered from breakdowns and lengthy repairs, are planned to be repaired under a new contractor to replace Kone. Sound Transit took over maintenance operations on January 1, 2021, and signed a contract with Schindler Group.

===Sound Transit ownership===

The full transfer of ownership was approved by Sound Transit on October 27, 2022, at no cost due to an agreement with Metro to pay off $87 million of remaining debt incurred from its construction. As part of the transfer, $96 million was budgeted for upgrades to elevators and escalators, fixing utilities and station elements, and cleaning soiled artwork. In September 2022, ORCA card readers were removed from the platforms and new signage and tactile markings added for fare paid zones. Sound Transit plans to replace all 58 escalators and elevators in the transit tunnel over a nine-year period beginning in 2023 at a cost of $134 million. In addition to wear and age, some pieces of equipment are also due for replacement because of flooding and rainwater seepage. , 56 of the 58 elevators and escalators in the tunnel stations are in operation.

The tunnel was retrofitted from January to February 2024 to replace of northbound track in the curve between University Street (now Symphony) and Westlake stations where the rails in the track had drifted apart by . Other tunnel work, including the replacement of 58 bond boxes for signaling between the tracks, was also undertaken during the project, which had single-track service on weekdays and a full closure of the downtown section on weekends. The first week of the project resulted in crowding on station platforms and delays exceeding the scheduled 26-minute frequency for single-tracking trains.

<text>King of Kensington is a Canadian television sitcom that aired on CBC Television from 1975 to 1980.

==Synopsis==
Al Waxman starred as Larry King, a convenience store owner in Toronto&#x27;s Kensington Market who was known for helping friends and neighbours solve problems. His multicultural group of friends consisted of Nestor Best (Ardon Bess), Max (John J. Dee), and Tony &quot;Duke&quot; Zarro (Bob Vinci), who hung around regularly to the perennial disapproval of King&#x27;s mother Gladys (Helene Winston).

For the first three seasons, Fiona Reid played his wife Cathy. At the end of the third season, Reid decided to leave the series, so Larry and Cathy divorced. Larry then dated Tina (Rosemary Radcliffe) in the fourth season and Gwen Twining (Jayne Eastwood) in the fifth. At the same time, Larry sold the convenience store and took a new job with a youth community centre.

==Production==
The show was created by Perry Rosemond, who also produced the first season. Other producers included Jack Humphrey (1976–1980) and Joe Partington (1978–1980). The original series pilot starred Paul Hecht and Sandra O&#x27;Neill as Larry and Cathy King, although the series was recast with Waxman and Reid by the time the show went into production.

The series featured many Canadian actors as guest stars, including Andrea Martin, Mike Myers, John Candy, Eugene Levy, Dave Thomas, Jeff Wincott and Mark Humphrey. The show was popular with viewers; prior to the start of the fourth season, one of the producers noted the show drew 1.5 to 1.8 million viewers weekly.

The show&#x27;s gentle but politically conscious humour is seen by some critics as a Canadian version of the topical Norman Lear sitcoms of the 1970s, such as &quot;All in the Family&quot; and &quot;Maude&quot;. The series maintained a tight production schedule, with episodes sometimes airing just one week or less after they were filmed, so that topical jokes about current news stories could be incorporated into the scripts.

The series was syndicated to some American stations during the height of its popularity.

After &quot;King of Kensington&quot; ended in 1980, many of the producers went on to create the new CBC sitcom &quot;Hangin&#x27; In&quot;, while head writer Louis Del Grande went on to create and star in &quot;Seeing Things&quot;, and Waxman was cast in the American series &quot;Cagney &amp; Lacey&quot;.

==Tributes==
In the &quot;SCTV&quot; episode &quot;CCCP1-Russian television&quot;, one of the fake TV programs infiltrating the network is &quot;Hey Giorgy&quot;, about &quot;everyone&#x27;s favorite Cossack&quot;, intended as a Russian knockoff of &quot;King of Kensington&quot;.

In the first episode of the 1990s television series &quot;Twitch City&quot;, also set in Kensington, the character Nathan (played by Daniel MacIvor) was sent to prison for killing a homeless man with a can of cat food. The producers of &quot;Twitch City&quot; cast Al Waxman in the role of the murder victim, as a symbolic wink to &quot;King of Kensington&quot;, although they claimed that they did not intend for the character to be seen as Larry King himself.

In the late 1990s, &quot;This Hour Has 22 Minutes&quot; featured a sketch detailing the making of a film version of &quot;King of Kensington.&quot; In the sketch, director Atom Egoyan (played by Greg Thomey), re-imagines the series as a surreal crime thriller, with Larry King as a serial killer instead of a convenience store owner.

Following Waxman&#x27;s death on January 18, 2001, a memorial to him was erected in Kensington Market.

In one episode of the Canadian comedy program &quot;Puppets Who Kill&quot;, the character Bill steals Al Waxman&#x27;s preserved brain from CBC headquarters.

==Home media==
On November 13, 2007, Morningstar Entertainment released &quot;King of Kensington – Season One&quot; on DVD in Region 1.

<text>The Altamont Corridor Express (also known as ACE, formerly Altamont Commuter Express) is a commuter rail service in California, connecting Stockton and San Jose during peak hours only. ACE is named for the Altamont Pass, through which it runs. Service is managed by the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission, and operations are contracted to Herzog Transit Services. The route includes ten stops, with travel time about 2 hours and 12 minutes end-to-end. In , the line had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of . ACE uses Bombardier BiLevel Coaches, MPI F40PH-3C locomotives, and Siemens Charger locomotives.

Service began on October 19, 1998, with two weekday round trips. A third round trip was added in May 2001, followed by a fourth round trip in October 2012. Saturday service commenced in September 2019. , average weekday ridership was 5,900.

The tracks are owned by Union Pacific Railroad, previously built along the Western Pacific Railroad main line. Under the ACE&quot;forward&quot; program, a number of improvements to the service are being considered. These include a rerouted line through Tracy, an extension to Modesto and Merced, and connections to BART at Union City and Tri-Valley.

== History and funding ==
=== Planning ===

By the 1980s, three rapidly growing areas in California – Silicon Valley, the Tri-Valley, and the San Joaquin Valley – were poorly connected by public transit, as Interstate 580 and Interstate 680 became more congested. Commuting from the San Joaquin Valley or the Tri-Valley to Silicon Valley required using a car or limited bus service.

In 1989, the San Joaquin Council of Governments, Stockton Chamber of Commerce, and the Building Industry Association of the Delta started work on a 20-year transportation plan for the northern section of the San Joaquin Valley. In November 1990, San Joaquin County voters passed Measure K, a half-cent sales tax to fund a variety of transportation improvements. The highest-priority project was the establishment of passenger rail service to San Jose.

In 1995, San Joaquin County and seven cities along the route formed the San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission (SJRRC) to oversee the creation of the service. In May 1997, the Altamont Commuter Express Joint Powers Authority (ACE JPA) was formed by the SJRRC, Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority (VTA), and Alameda Congestion Management Agency (ACMA). That agreement formalized financial support, administrative processes, and governance for the rail service. The operation is funded by a variety of state and federal sources, largely sales tax revenue collected by the three JPA signatories, while farebox revenues account for about one-third of costs.

Cost sharing for capital projects, excluding stations, during the initial 36 months of service was determined by the JPA on a case-by-case basis and approved by each of the member agencies. The initial purchase of rolling stock, construction of stations, and other start-up costs, amounting to some $48 million, were covered primarily by Measure K funds. Station improvements are the responsibility of the county in which the station is located. ACE pays the Union Pacific Railroad about $1.5 million per year to use their tracks. ACE trains also use about of Caltrain track in San Jose. Service began on October 19, 1998, with two daily round trips running to San Jose in the morning and Stockton in the evening.

=== Service expansion ===

The original service used two trainsets, each with four bilevel coach cars, for a total seated capacity of 1,120 passengers in each direction daily. In September 1999, less than a year after opening, the service reached 1,000 daily riders per direction, near full capacity.

With that success, the agency wanted to add additional runs. To enable more trains on the line, ACE funded $3 million in track improvements, but the limited amount of equipment allowed ACE to add only a morning &quot;short turn&quot; run between San Jose and Pleasanton. This &quot;turn-back train&quot; started service on February 21, 2000, and gave Pleasanton and Fremont a third inbound train to alleviate the crowding on the two earlier trains. Even with the added capacity, by early 2001 ACE was regularly carrying more than 700 daily standees.

ACE purchased additional equipment, allowing the &quot;turn-back train&quot; to operate to Lathrop/Manteca station, nearly the full length of the route, beginning on March 5, 2001; trains also began stopping at Santa Clara station. Although the third train added 560 seats in each direction, it brought an immediate increase of 380 daily riders.

ACE then planned to add a fourth round trip later in the year, with fifth and sixth round trips by 2006. However, by late 2001, the deepening dot-com recession was severely hurting ridership, and expansion plans were put on hold. On June 30, 2003, the ACE JPA was dissolved in favor of a Cooperative Services Agreement between the three member agencies.

On January 6, 2003, ACE introduced the Stockton Solution Shuttle, allowing Stockton passengers to use the ACE trip which terminated at Lathrop/Manteca. The trip was extended to Stockton on August 1, 2005. At that time, service to Santa Clara was suspended to allow for the construction of a second platform and pedestrian tunnel at the station.

On August 28, 2006, ACE added a fourth round trip, which operated midday using one of the existing trainsets. On November 7, 2006, San Joaquin County voters approved a 20-year extension of Measure K. Suffering from reducing funding due to the Great Recession, ACE cut the lightly used midday trip on November 2, 2009. On May 14, 2012, ACE restored service to Santa Clara station. On October 1, 2012, a fourth rush-hour round trip was added, running approximately one hour after existing trips.

=== Altamont Corridor Express ===

In December 2012, the service was rebranded from Altamont Commuter Express to Altamont Corridor Express to reflect plans for a broader scope of service.

In March 2014, ACE opened a $65 million, maintenance facility in Stockton. On July 1, 2015, management and governance of the &quot;San Joaquin&quot; passed from Caltrans to the new San Joaquin Joint Powers Authority. The SJJPA has nominal control over the SJRRC, but delegates all responsibility over ACE to the SJRRC.

On March 7, 2016, an ACE train was derailed by a mudslide in Niles Canyon near Sunol. The front car plunged into the rain-swollen Alameda Creek. Fourteen passengers were injured, but there were no fatalities.

ACE received Road Repair and Accountability Act funds in order to initiate Saturday service in January 2018, with two Saturday round trips added in September 2019.

=== Future plans ===
In association with the California High-Speed Rail project, ACE has developed plans to upgrade and expand service. Beginning around 2008, initial plans called for the Altamont Corridor Rail Project to produce a high speed rail &quot;Super ACE&quot; capable of halving the travel time between the endpoints.

As the high-speed rail project was scaled back and rerouted to Pacheco Pass several years later, these plans were replaced with the more modest ACE&quot;forward&quot; program. The San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission issued a notice of intent to proceed with an Environmental Impact Statement in June 2013; this was released in 2017 and prioritized goals as either long term or short term. Short term goals included track improvements, a possible reroute through downtown Tracy including new stations, a West Tracy station, and a new extension to Modesto in addition to additional daily round trips. Long term goals included upgrades to the existing corridor to allow as many as 10 daily round trips, extension to Merced and electrification of the line from Stockton to San Jose.

Also under studied were possible connections with BART at Union City or the Tri-Valley via traditional ACE rail, diesel multiple units, or bus bridges. This connection is planned to be facilitated by the Tri-Valley–San Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority.

The California state senate allocated $400 million in revenue from a gas tax increase to ACE&quot;forward&quot; expansion. By 2019, the plan had come to be called the Altamont Corridor Vision, with an expected price of $9.7 billion, allowing ACE to run up to six weekday round trips in 2023 with the goal of ten weekday round trips once additional track infrastructure is completed. ACE and the Tri-Valley–San Joaquin Valley Regional Rail Authority sought funding to construct a shared tunnel under Altamont pass in order to speed service and increase reliability.

====Valley Rail====
However, during the development of ACE&quot;forward&quot;, significant financial and logistical challenges to expanding service on the existing route between Stockton and San Jose were identified, and further work on the project was halted in favor of a new Valley Rail project, focusing initially on the eastern expansion to serve commuters living in the Central Valley. ACE was awarded $500.5 million in April 2018 for expanded service to Ceres and Sacramento to provide more rail service and connections within the Central Valley. Service is expected to begin from Ceres by 2023 with interim bus bridge service to Merced until that segment of Union Pacific right-of-way is upgraded. Four trains will depart Ceres in the mornings, and one train may make the complete run to San Jose with others transferring passengers at North Lathrop.

The Union Pacific right of way between Ceres and Lathrop will be double tracked to facilitate passenger service. platforms are being extended to accommodate longer trains.

Valley Rail also includes a project segment to route ACE and Amtrak &quot;San Joaquins&quot; along the little-used Sacramento Subdivision between Stockton and Sacramento. Six new stations would be constructed along the line with a layover facility at Natomas. Trains would run the length of the line from Natomas to San Jose or Ceres with a midday short turn to Stockton. A Draft Environmental Impact Statement was released in 2020, with services expected to begin no later than 2023. The North Elk Grove station was eliminated from planning in September 2020. The project received funding via California&#x27;s Transit and Intercity Rail Capital Program in 2023, by which time the project was expected to open in phases beginning in 2025. Later that year, the estimated commencement of service to Ceres and Natomas were again pushed back to 2026, with service to Merced and infill stations opening by 2030.

== Service ==

, ACE operated four round trips per weekday in the peak rush hour directions – westbound (to San Jose) in the morning and eastbound (to Stockton) in the evening. Trains were scheduled to make the one-way trip in 2 hours 12 minutes, an average speed of .

Special trains serve events at Levi&#x27;s Stadium.

ACE did not operate on weekends or major holidays until September 7, 2019, when two Saturday round trips were added.

=== Route ===

From San Jose to just north of Santa Clara, ACE uses the Caltrain main line (Peninsula Subdivision), shared with Caltrain and Amtrak service. From Santa Clara to Stockton – the majority of the route – ACE runs on Union Pacific Railroad freight lines. From Santa Clara to Newark, ACE uses the Coast Subdivision, then the Niles Subdivision to Niles. From Niles to Lathrop, the line uses the Oakland Subdivision. From Lathrop to Stockton, the line uses the Fresno Subdivision.

The route runs through Niles Canyon, parallel to the Niles Canyon Railway, Highway 84, and the Hetch Hetchy Aqueduct. The line passes through a long tunnel which cuts off one of the canyon&#x27;s horseshoes. This tunnel was modified from its original configuration to accommodate intermodal double-stack freight trains. However, this left the track in poor condition, reducing speeds from to in the summer and as low as during the rainy season. The San Joaquin Regional Rail Commission plans to rehabilitate the tunnel.

East of Pleasanton and Livermore, the line runs through the Altamont Pass on the original Feather River Route. After crossing the California Aqueduct and the Delta-Mendota Canal into the Central Valley, skirting the southern edge of Tracy. It then turns north between Lathrop and Manteca and runs to Robert J. Cabral Station in Stockton.

=== Tickets and fares ===
ACE fares are distance-based and available in one-way, round trip, 10 trip, 20 trip, and monthly passes. Unlike many of the other commuter rail services on the West Coast, ACE does not have ticket machines at stations. Passengers are encouraged to use the railroad&#x27;s mobile ticketing app, but paper tickets can be purchased from agents at all stations except Vasco Road and the Santa Clara Transit Center. Also, unlike many other transit services in the Bay Area, ACE does not accept the Clipper Card.

== Rolling stock ==

ACE operates push-pull trains with one to two diesel locomotives and four to eight bilevel coach cars. Trains typically operate with the locomotive(s) leading westbound and the cab car leading eastbound.

ACE has ordered 17 additional Bombardier BiLevel cars (5 cab cars and 12 coaches). Deliveries were expected to begin sometime in 2021. The entire fleet of Bombardier bilevel coach cars and MPI F40PH-3C locomotives will be rebuilt, overhauled, and repainted to have a matching paint. They will then continue to operate along with the newer Siemens Charger SC-44 locomotives, which entered service in 2020.

<doc id="870199" wikidata="Q1335401" url="?curid=870199" title="Walter VI, Count of Brienne">
<text>Walter VI of Brienne (c. 1304 – 19 September 1356) was a French nobleman and crusader. He was the count of Brienne in France, the count of Conversano and Lecce in southern Italy and claimant to the Duchy of Athens in Frankish Greece.

==Life==

===Early life in Italy===
Walter was the son of Count Walter V of Brienne, duke of Athens, and Jeanne de Châtillon (died 1354), the daughter of the count of Porcien, constable to King Philip IV of France. As grandson of Count Hugh of Brienne (d. 1296), he was heir to a vast property all around the Mediterranean. After his father&#x27;s death at the Battle of Halmyros on 15 March 1311, Walter became count of Brienne, Lecce, and Conversano. However, the Duchy of Athens, except for Argos and Nauplia, had been overrun by the Catalan Company, and Walter spent much of his life in an unsuccessful struggle to recover that inheritance of his family. He spent most of his life in Italy and France and left Argos-Nauplia to be ruled by guardians.

His mother Jeanne carried out a vigorous struggle against the Catalans during his minority, which, however, had little military effect but impoverished him. To strengthen his position, Walter engaged in a strategic marriage to Beatrice, the niece of King Robert of Naples and daughter of Philip I of Taranto by Thamar Angelina Komnene, in December 1325. At this time, Florence requested King Robert&#x27;s support in protecting Guelph interests in Italy, and elected his son, Charles, Duke of Calabria, as signore of Florence for a ten-year period (1326–36). Walter VI&#x27;s almost-princely position in the Angevin court soon won him an appointment as Vicar for Charles of Calabria, an office that he only exercised for a few months in 1325.

===Anti-Catalan crusade of 1331–1332===
After 1321, Walter repeatedly announced his intention to campaign in Greece and recover the Duchy of Athens, but financial constraints and his obligations to the King of Naples kept him occupied in Italy. In 1328, he even briefly concluded a truce with the Catalans. Thus it was not until 1330 that a serious effort got underway. In June 1330, Pope John XXII issued a crusading bull for Walter, and ordered prelates in Italy and Greece to preach for a crusade against the Catalans; shortly after, King Robert of Naples also gave the crusade his support and allowed his feudatories to join it. The Venetians, on the other hand, renewed their treaty with the Catalans in April 1331. Sailing from Brindisi in August, Walter attacked first the Latin County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, and the Greek Despotate of Epirus, forcing them to recognize the overlordship of King Robert. He also seized the island of Leucas and the mainland castle of Vonitsa for himself in the process. From there he proceeded to invade the Duchy of Athens through northern Boeotia, but his campaign was a failure as the Catalans avoided battle and withdrew behind the walls of Thebes and Athens. Walter had neither the troops to overwhelm the Catalans nor the money to sustain a prolonged war of sieges and attrition, and found no support among the native Greek population. By summer 1332, it was clear that the expedition had failed, and Walter returned to Brindisi, saddled with even more crippling debts. In his new Greek domains of Leucas and Vonitsa, Walter initially appointed a series of French castellans. In 1343, he made the Venetian Graziano Zorzi, who had helped finance his 1331 expedition and joined it himself, governor of Leucas. Zorzi proved successful in this role, and in October 1355, Walter granted Leucas as well as Vonitsa to him as a fief.

===Ruler of Florence===
He occupied himself with his lands in France, and was the King&#x27;s Lieutenant in Thiérache in 1339. His wife died in 1340, and he returned to Italy in 1342 when the Florentine ruling class of wealthy merchants called upon him to rule the city. Since 1339, Florence had been in the grip of a severe economic crisis brought about by immense English debts to Florentine banking houses, and by astronomical public debts incurred in trying to obtain the nearby city of Lucca from its Veronese lord, Mastino della Scala. The Florentine nobility looked to foreign powers to solve the city&#x27;s seemingly impossible financial problems, and found an ally in Walter of Brienne. Although the ruling class invited Walter to rule for a limited time, the lower classes, who were fed up with the ineptitude of Walter&#x27;s predecessors, unexpectedly proclaimed him &quot;signore&quot; for life.

Walter VI ruled despotically, ignoring or directly opposing the interests of the very same merchant class that had brought him to power. The &quot;Duke of Athens&quot; imposed harsh economic correctives on the Florentines, including the flat tax &quot;estimo&quot;, and &quot;prestanze&quot;, postponements of the city&#x27;s repayment of loans forced from the wealthier citizens. These measures both angered the Florentines and helped alleviate the fiscal crisis that had been stewing for years. After only ten months, Walter of Brienne&#x27;s &quot;signoria&quot; was cut short by conspiracy. Walter VI was not only forced to resign from office but barely escaped Florence with his life.

===Later life and death===
In 1344, he married Jeanne, the daughter of Raoul I of Brienne, Count of Eu. They had two daughters, Jeanne and Marguerite, both of whom died young. As he had no surviving children, it was evident that his sister&#x27;s issue would inherit his possessions and claims. He was appointed Constable of France in 1356 and in that capacity died on 19 September 1356 at the Battle of Poitiers. He was succeeded in his titles and pretensions by his sister Isabella and her sons. When the inheritance was divided after Walter VI&#x27;s death, Sohier d&#x27;Enghien received the title of duke of Athens and county of Brienne. Jean gained the county of Lecce, Louis became the Count of Conversano, while Guy received the Lordship of Argos and Nauplia.

==Cultural legacy==

The &quot;Duke of Athens&quot; who appears in the seventh tale of Day Two of the &quot;Decameron&quot; as one of the nine lovers of the Sultan of Babylon&#x27;s daughter, while not historically accurate, is probably a satirical allusion to Walter VI – his brief but unforgettable dictatorship in Florence occurred less than ten years before the writing of the &quot;Decameron&quot;.

<text>was a town located in Kamitsuga District, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan.

As of 2003, the town has an estimated population of 10,278 and a density of 57.96 persons per km2. The total area is 177.32 km2.

On January 1, 2006, Awano was merged into the expanded city of Kanuma.

The town is part of a Sister City program with Grand Forks, North Dakota in the United States. Each fall, a delegation of Japanese Students visits Grand Forks and stays with a host student. In the spring of the following year, the American students stay with their Japanese host brother or sister in Awano. This program began in 1994, and led to the eventual Sister City program with Grand Forks.

<text>was a town located in Kamitsuga District, Tochigi, Japan.

As of 2003, the town had an estimated population of 3,465 and a density of 18.65 persons per km2. The total area was 185.79 km2.

On March 20, 2006, Ashio, along with the city of Imaichi, the town of Fujihara, and the village of Kuriyama (both from Shioya District), was merged into the expanded city of Nikkō.

The Ashio Copper Mine was located in Ashio. This copper mine caused a major pollution problem in Japan at the beginning of the 20th century. Subsequent environmental problems related to the mine are still evident along the river, in Tochigi, Gunma and Ibaraki Prefectures. In 1907 the Ashio miners rioted. During World War II a POW camp was based here to supply slave labour to the copper mines.

The following communities agreed to seek the permission of the governor of the prefecture to merge on March 1, 2006:
* Nikkō
* Imaichi
* Ashio
* Fujihara
* Kuriyama

<text>Wolfgang Staudte (9 October 1906 – 19 January 1984), born Georg Friedrich Staudte, was a German film director, script writer and actor. He was born in Saarbrücken.

After 1945, Staudte also looked at German guilt in the cinema. Alongside Helmut Käutner, he was considered the only German post-war director of any standing who, after 1945, could look back on continuous artistic filmmaking far removed from Heimatfilm and the suppression of history. Staudte&#x27;s films stood for politically committed cinema as well as for professional craftsmanship, for film art and (good) entertainment with a social claim. 

His most important work came in the ten years following World War II, in which he worked with the DEFA in East Germany. The main focus of his work was to highlight the limits of German national pride. His work in anti-Nazi films, such as &quot;Murderers Among Us&quot; (1946), was also a personal working-through of his film career under the Nazis (he acted in the anti-Semitic film &quot;Jud Süß&quot;). Following 1956, he worked in West Germany. By the 1970s, his work was no longer considered particularly modern and he moved to television. He appeared on shows such as &quot;Der Kommissar&quot; and &quot;Tatort&quot;.

He is the great-uncle of the German-Iranian director and novelist Andy Siege.

==Culture==

Mashiko is known for its pottery, called . Early pottery in Mashiko dates back to the Jōmon and Yayoi periods. &quot;Mashikoyaki&quot; is often thought of as simple and rustic in style, with brown and maybe a little red glaze, but modern pottery made in Mashiko today is found in many styles, on account of the creative freedom brought to Mashiko by Shoji Hamada. Modern &quot;Mashikoyaki&quot; dates only to 1853, when a potter discovered that local clay here was ideal for ceramics. The style was popularized in 1930 when Hamada, later designated as a Living National Treasure, set up a kiln in Mashiko. Hamada&#x27;s student, Tatsuzō Shimaoka, was also designated as a Living National Treasure and worked in Mashiko from 1953 until his death in 2007.

Mashiko is a folkware kiln site that is unlike some of the other older kiln sites around Japan. The town is open to newcomers whether or not they are potters or of other professional backgrounds in arts, sciences and education. In Japan, craftsmen are usually born into their profession, but in Mashiko, anyone can become a potter. Following Shoji Hamada, people looking to return to a more traditional Japanese lifestyle settled in the area.
Twice a year, coinciding with the Golden Week Holidays in the first week of May, and again for the first week of November, there is a pottery and crafts festival where potters and craftsmen from Mashiko and surrounding areas come to the town and set up stalls.

<text>Wormsley is a private estate of Mark Getty and his family, set in of rolling countryside in the Chiltern Hills of Buckinghamshire (formerly Oxfordshire), England. It is also the home of Garsington Opera. Acquired by Sir Paul Getty in 1985, the estate forms part of Hambleden valley, running from Stokenchurch to Turville. Wormsley is known for its library, its cricket ground, its two-acre walled garden, its shoot, and the vistas and landscapes of the estate grounds. It also rents space for events and television and filming work.

==History==

The estate was founded by the Scrope family in the late 16th century. It belonged to Colonel Adrian Scrope, the regicide, and passed to his grandson John Scrope, a baron of the Exchequer who died without issue. The estate passed to the descendants of his sister Anne (died 1721), who had married Henry Fane of Brympton. Their second son, Thomas Fane, also a Bristol merchant, succeeded his uncle as Member of Parliament for Lyme Regis, beginning the Fane family&#x27;s long association with the seat. Fane also succeeded a distant cousin and became 8th Earl of Westmoreland in 1762.

The Fane family sold the 18th-century house and estate in 1986 to Sir Paul Getty and his wife Victoria Holdsworth. Getty restored the house and estate, adding a library to accommodate his book collection, and a theatre where performances were held for invited guests.

The area is known for its population of red kites. Once extinct in England and Scotland, the birds were reintroduced into England beginning in 1989. The area was not originally planned to be the first release site. It was originally intended to be Windsor Great Park, but at the last minute the landowner pulled out and the project nearly collapsed. Getty stepped in and offered Wormsley as an alternative.

In 2011, Garsington Opera moved from Garsington Manor near Oxford to a purpose-built pavilion in the grounds of Wormsley.

==Cricket ground==

After Mick Jagger introduced him to cricket, Getty built a ground in 1992 with a mock-Tudor pavilion. The actual playing area is a replica of the field at The Oval. The Queen Mother and the Prime Minister, John Major, attended the first match, along with Michael Caine, Denis Compton and Brian Johnston. Over the final decade of his life, Getty invited teams to play at what is now known as &quot;Sir Paul Getty&#x27;s Ground&quot; with the teams ranging from world-class sides to youth sides.

Those who have played there include cricketers Andrew Flintoff, Imran Khan, Mike Gatting, Mike Atherton, Mark Ramprakash, Derek Randall, James Anderson and Mike Brearley and entertainment figures such as Peter O&#x27;Toole, Tim Rice, and Rory Bremner. Touring international sides have played at Wormsley with the Australians, West Indians, Sri Lankans and South Africans all having made appearances at the ground. It was the venue for the only Test match of the Australian women&#x27;s tour of England in 2013.

<doc id="870222" wikidata="Q1295999" url="?curid=870222" title="Secaucus Junction">
<text>Secaucus Junction (signed as Secaucus) is an intermodal transit hub served by New Jersey Transit (NJ Transit) and Metro-North Railroad in Secaucus, New Jersey. It is one of the busiest railway stations in North America.

The $450 million, station opened on December 15, 2003. It was known as Secaucus Transfer during planning stages and was dedicated as the Frank R. Lautenberg Rail Station at Secaucus Junction. U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg, who died in 2013, was a transit advocate who had worked to allocate federal funds for the project.

The station is on the Northeast Corridor (NEC) five miles west of New York Penn Station and five miles east of Newark Penn Station. At Secaucus, the NEC crosses above the Main Line, which originates/terminates at Hoboken Terminal; the station allows passengers to transfer between the two lines. The station is served by all NJ Transit rail lines except for the Atlantic City Line and the Princeton Branch. Amtrak trains run through Secaucus but do not stop.

A bus terminal was built at the station in 2016.

== Purpose and history ==

NJ Transit&#x27;s rail operations are split between two divisions, a legacy of their roots in separate railroads. The Hoboken Division consists of lines formerly part of the Erie Lackawanna Railway and its predecessors, while the Newark Division lines had once been part of the Pennsylvania Railroad and Central Railroad of New Jersey. Conrail ran both networks under contract to the New Jersey Department of Transportation from 1976 until handing them to NJ Transit in 1983. While the opening of the Kearny Connection and Waterfront Connection in 1996 allowed for the implementation of some interdivisional trains, including the &quot;Midtown Direct&quot; service to New York Penn Station on the Hoboken Division&#x27;s Morris &amp; Essex Lines, direct passenger transfers between the divisions were still not possible. Secaucus Junction was built to integrate the two systems and allow for transfers between trains on each division.

The two-track Northeast Corridor embankment was expanded to three tracks for a mile on each side of the station and to four tracks through the station itself, allowing Amtrak and nonstop NJT trains to pass stopped trains. The two-track Bergen County Line was re-aligned southwestward to join the two-track Main Line to pass through the station on the four-track lower level. The construction required the bodies from the Hudson County Burial Grounds to be disinterred and moved to another cemetery.

The station was built with little public parking, as NJT believed few passenger trips would originate there. In 2005, exit 15X on the adjacent New Jersey Turnpike opened to provide easier access to the station; two years later, it was the least-used interchange on the turnpike, possibly due in part to the lack of parking at the station. Despite NJT&#x27;s prediction that the station would be used primarily for transfers, in 2008 an upscale &quot;transit-oriented&quot; housing development called Xchange at Secaucus Junction opened nearby with 799 units marketed toward Manhattan commuters, and is expected to expand to 1,538 total units by 2024. On June 1, 2009, Edison Parkfast, a private company, opened the first parking lot near the station, with space for 1,094 cars. Bicycle parking is also available.

On July 26, 2009, NJ Transit began rail service to the Meadowlands station at the Meadowlands Sports Complex, with Secaucus Junction being a transfer point for passengers. From 2009 to 2014, Secaucus Junction served trains coming from Metro-North&#x27;s New Haven Line for New York Giants and New York Jets football games at the Meadowlands with 1:00 p.m. kickoffs on Sundays. In anticipation of increased ridership for Super Bowl XLVIII in February 2014, NJT extended the lower-level platforms at Secaucus Junction by to accommodate multi-level 10-car train sets which could handle about 1,400 to 1,800 passengers per trip. The capacity to handle crowds, a plan dubbed the Mass Transit Super Bowl, was seen as unsuccessful.

On June 5, 2013, two days after his death, a special Amtrak train stopped at the station to carry the coffin of U.S. Senator Frank Lautenberg to Washington, D.C. for his burial. On February 2, 2014, a limited number of Amtrak trains made stops at Secaucus for passengers going to Super Bowl XLVIII. Local officials have indicated a desire to have regular Amtrak service stop at Secaucus Junction after American Dream Meadowlands opened in October 2019, however, as of 2024, this has not been implemented.
In March 2016, a new bus station with 14 bus berths opened; it is used for intermodal connections and was intended to add redundancy to the transportation network. In 2021 NJ Transit authorized studies for alternative options between the Meadowlands Sports Complex and Secaucus Junction including a bus &quot;transitway&quot;. Further funding for design was approved in 2023 for an exclusive bus transitway planned to go into service for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

== Station layout ==

Despite its name, Secaucus Junction is not a true junction, in which trains can switch between lines; there is no rail connection between the upper and lower levels. The station has two platform levels connected by a third level on top. Such a loop, however, is proposed as part of the Gateway Project to improve commuter access to Manhattan.

* The lower platform level lacks electrification and has four tracks and two island platforms serving the Bergen County Line, Main Line, Pascack Valley Line, Port Jervis Line, and Meadowlands Line trains, which originate and terminate at Hoboken Terminal.
* The upper platform level tracks are electrified and carry trains to and from New York Penn Station (usually the Northeast Corridor, North Jersey Coast, Montclair-Boonton, and Morristown Lines) with four tracks and three platforms: two side platforms serving Tracks 2 and 3 (where nonstop trains usually bypass) and one island platform between Tracks A and B. Amtrak trains pass through the upper-level tracks without stopping.
* The upper concourse level has a New Jersey Transit customer service office, a convenience store and food court. To transfer between trains on different levels, passengers climb up to the upper concourse, pass through faregates, and descend to their destination platforms. At the center of this level is a steel, glass, and titanium sculpture of a cattail (abundant in the surrounding New Jersey Meadowlands) by San Francisco artist Cork Marcheschi. The tops of the cattails are lit from within in the purple, blue, and orange colors of NJ Transit.

== Proposed New York City Subway extension ==

On November 16, 2010, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg&#x27;s administration was working on a plan to bring the of the New York City Subway under the Hudson River to Secaucus Junction. An extension of that service from Times Square – 42nd Street to a new terminus at Eleventh Avenue and 34th Street, has already been built.

The extension would take the subway outside the city&#x27;s and New York&#x27;s borders and under the Hudson River for the first time. The plan would alleviate pressure on the NJ Transit/Amtrak route under the Hudson, after the cancellation of the Access to the Region&#x27;s Core tunnel project by New Jersey Governor Chris Christie in October 2010. It would offer a direct route to Grand Central Terminal on the east side of Manhattan, while connecting with most other subway routes. New York City spent $250,000 for a consultant to conduct feasibility studies for the project. However, no design work commenced nor were financing arrangements made. On October 26, 2011, Bloomberg reiterated his support for the project, while Christie also expressed general concurrence. In April 2013, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority rejected the proposed extension, citing lack of funding. However, it was reconsidered again in 2018.

== Gateway Project ==
The Gateway Project, a series of infrastructure improvements along the NEC between Newark Penn Station and New York Penn Station, includes a proposal to build the so-called Secaucus Loop or Bergen Loop, tracks connecting the Main Line and the NEC at Secaucus, thus creating a true junction station. As part of the second phase of the Gateway Project, the loop is projected to be constructed between 2024 and 2030.

<text>The Union State is a supranational union consisting of Belarus and Russia, with the stated aim of deepening the relationship between the two states through integration in economic and defence policy. Originally, the Union State aimed to create a confederation; however, both countries currently retain their independence. 

The Union State is based on a previous international treaty between Russia and Belarus made on 2 April 1997. Although it consists of only Russia and Belarus, other countries are allowed to join. The supranational union is ruled through the Supreme State Council and other governing bodies. As of 2025, the current president of the Supreme State Council of the Union is Alexander Lukashenko, who has held the position since 2000. The present goal of the Union State mainly focuses on economic integration, taxation, and integration of defence and intelligence apparatus.

==History of formation==

The &quot;Community of Belarus and Russia&quot; was founded on 2 April 1996, following 1995 agreements that established a Russian military presence in Belarus. The basis of the union was strengthened on 2 April 1997 with the signing of the &quot;Treaty on the Union between Belarus and Russia&quot;, at which time its name was changed to the &quot;Union of Belarus and Russia&quot;.

Several further agreements were signed on 25 December 1998, with the intention of providing greater political, economic and social integration.

Nevertheless, the nature of the political entity remained vague. Under pressure from his political opponents, who argued for a reunion of the two states, and from Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, who sought to tie his excessively weak economy to Russia&#x27;s stronger one, Russian President Boris Yeltsin initiated the creation of the Union to harmonize the political and economic differences between the two countries. According to some observers, Lukashenko&#x27;s intention was also to gain great power, becoming president of a future Russia-Belarus federation after Yeltsin&#x27;s demise due to his all-time low popularity. However, after Yeltsin resigned, Vladimir Putin was elected in 2000 to succeed him as Russian president. There was also the Freedom March, a 1999 protest against unification in the Belarusian capital of Minsk. Putin&#x27;s election and the Freedom March forced Lukashenko to cancel his plans and maintain a balance between the independence of Belarus and Putin&#x27;s increasing pressure for further integration of the two countries into the Union State.

The &quot;Treaty on the Creation of a Union State of Russia and Belarus&quot; was signed on 8 December 1999. The intention was to achieve a federation like the Soviet Union, with a common head of state, legislature, flag, coat of arms, anthem, constitution, army, citizenship and currency. The Union was ratified by the Russian State Duma on 22 December 1999 and the National Assembly of Belarus on 26 January 2000. On the latter date the Treaty and the Union came into effect.

Then Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev had put forward a similar proposal in 1994, envisioning the founding of a Eurasian union, but this proposal was not adopted until 29 May 2014 with the formation of the Eurasian Economic Union.

==Governing bodies and legal framework==

The &quot;Treaty on the Creation of a Union State&quot; creates legal framework as constitutional act and establishes the following institutions

* Supreme State Council
* Council of Ministers
* Union Parliament
* Court of the Union
* Accounting Chamber

The Union State based on its founding treaties has exclusive jurisdiction over the creation of a single economic space and legal foundations for a common market, monetary union, single tax and pricing policy, unified development and procurement of defence equipment, unified system of technical support for the armed forces. Common command of regional military is further realized through many other documents based on this Union State jurisdiction, common border policy and other jurisdictions.

Besides exclusive jurisdictions of the Union State there are joint jurisdiction of the Union State and the subjects of the Union State that includes joint defence policy, harmonization and unification of the legislation of the subjects of the Union State, development of science, education, culture, formation of a common scientific, technological and information space, migration, working conditions and labor protection, social security, combating terrorism, corruption and others.

Outside the limits of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Union State and subjects of joint jurisdiction of the Union State and the subjects of the Union State, the subjects of the Union State retain the full completeness of state power.

Pavel Borodin was the first State Secretary of the Union. He was first appointed by the Supreme State Council on 26 January 2000 for a four-year term. In 2004 and 2008 his term was renewed for an additional four years, leaving office in 2011. Since then the office has been held by Grigory Rapota.

Union State is ruled through Supreme State Council of the Union. The Supreme State Council of the Union includes the member heads of states, respective governments, and both chambers of parliaments. Decisions on Supreme Council are made by principle of one state – one vote and presidents of states give that vote. Supreme Council includes the chairman of the Executive Committee of the Union that have an advisory vote. The President of the Supreme State Council is the head of one of the participating States on a rotation basis, unless the participating States agree otherwise.

Supreme State Council makes decisions on issues regarding the security of the member states of the Union including their collective protection from outside threats, the protection of the Union&#x27;s borders, military development, and many other issues.

The Council of Ministers is composed of the member states&#x27; Prime Ministers, Ministers of Foreign Affairs, Economy, and Finance and the State Secretary of the Union. Permanent Committee of the Union State is formed as permanent working body of Council of Ministers. Current president of Council of Ministers is Mikhail Mishustin.
Parliamentary Assembly of the Union comprises two chambers – the &quot;House of the Union&quot; and the &quot;House of Representatives&quot;. The &quot;House of Representatives&quot; should contain 75 deputies from Russia and 28 from Belarus, elected by the general populace of each. According to treaty, currently only House of the Union is formed and it consists of 72 deputies – 36 from Russia and 36 from Belarus. Before the elections for the House of Representatives of the Union State Parliament, the functions of the Union State Parliament are performed by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Union of Belarus and Russia in accordance with paragraph 4 of Article 70 of the Treaty on the Establishment of the Union State of 8 December 1999. Regular sessions of the Parliamentary Assembly House of the Union are held twice a year and for Quorum at least two third is needed to be present. House of the Union Parliament has president and four vice presidents and 8 permanent committees for different areas of legislature. Current president of Parliamentary Assembly of Union is Vyacheslav Volodin On 12 December 2020, the 59th joint session of the House of the Union parliament was held to consider the Union State budget for 2021. in 4715,15 millions of roubles or approximately 61.631.112 US dollars

Court of Union should consist of nine judges appointed for six-year terms. But while provisions for court are given in adopted treaty court was not formed.

Accounting Chamber, is tasked with controlling the implementation of the Union State budget. It consists of 11 members appointed for a period of 6 years from among the citizens of the member states who have experience in control and audit who are appointed by the Parliament of the Union State on the proposal of the Council of Ministers. The Accounting Chamber establishes its own regulations, which are approved by the Council of Ministers.

==Language==

The official languages of the Union State are the state languages of the participating states. Russian is used as a working language in the common organs of the Union State.

==Developments==
Shortly after its inauguration, both member states seemed to have lost their enthusiasm for the Union, with first Russia, and then Belarus, restoring customs controls along their common border in 2001, effectively suspending the customs union until it was restored in 2010. Plans had also been set in motion to implement a common currency across the Union, but these have been postponed several times.

On 16 November 2010, it was announced by the Union State website that the Constitutional Act was 99% ready.

===Common currency===
Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko promised to introduce a common currency on 1 January 2004. The currency was not introduced, and the plan was pushed back by one year. On 1 January 2005, the Union State again failed to introduce a common currency, and it was again postponed by one year, which, in 2006, happened once again. During a press-conference in Minsk on 2 February 2006, Pyotr Prokopovich, chief of the National Bank of Belarus, announced that a &quot;common currency might be introduced in 2007&quot;. This, however, failed to occur in 2007. The National Bank of the Republic of Belarus announced that, starting in 2008, the Belarusian ruble would be pegged to the United States dollar instead of the Russian ruble.

===Citizenship and freedom of migration===

Union State grants citizenship to citizens in both states meaning that every citizen of the Russian Federation and every citizen of the Republic of Belarus is at the same time a citizen of the Union with the guaranteed right to move and reside freely within the territory of the other party, allowing Belarusian citizens to travel freely in Russia and have the right to settle there to work or study, and vice versa including possession, use and disposal of property on the territory of another state. The Union State does provide citizens of Russia and Belarus the right to work and permanently settle in either country without formal immigration procedures otherwise mandatory for foreign nationals. They retain their national passports and other identification papers.

===Military===
On 10 February 2009, Russia and Belarus implemented the first stage of joint military officer training programs designed to integrate the military structures of the countries. This military collective is called the Regional Forces Group of Belarus and Russia (RGF). The goal of these operations is to ensure cohesive training, practice and implementation of military interests for the nations, and were aimed at strategic and battle training taking place in February and March 2009. Furthermore, the military doctrine of the Russian Federation provides that &quot;an armed attack on the state-participant in the Union State, as well as all other actions involving the use of military force against it,&quot; should be deemed &quot;an act of aggression against the Union State&quot;, authorizing Moscow to &quot;take measures in response&quot;.

=== Proposed symbols ===

Since the formation of the Union State in 1997, Belarus and Russia have thus far failed to institute any symbols or even a flag for the Union State. There have, however been several proposals for flags and coats of arms.

Two proposals have been made for the flag of the Union. In all cases, they are modifications to the flag of the Soviet Union, but representing the state (not communism). In both cases, two gold stars are placed in the canton of the red flag (to represent the two states of the Union).

A proposed coat of arms is a modification of the double-headed eagle holding the coats of arms of Russia and Belarus.

A song called &quot;Sovereign Union of Nations&quot; ( , ) has been proposed as the Union&#x27;s unofficial anthem. The song, which was modified from the National Anthem of the Soviet Union, refers to a wider union of the two nations.

===Value-added tax controversy===
Belarus and Russia had been collecting a value-added tax (VAT), meant to finance the Union State, in the country of origin, but from 1 January 2005, VAT is collected in the country of destination, as in most other independent countries of the world. This change gave rise to a considerable degree of confusion and has disrupted many trade operations between Belarus and Russia. On 10 February 2005, private entrepreneurs in Belarus staged a one-day warning strike, protesting the new VAT scheme between the two countries and Lukashenko&#x27;s economic policies.

===Contemplated expansion===

* and both currently have observer status in parliamentary sessions.
*: Opposition party Iron, founded and led by Georgiy Kabisov, called for a unified North and South Ossetia to be an equal partner to Russia in the Union State, as opposed to Ossetia being a subject of Russia.
*: several political parties including the Constitutional Rights Union, National Unity, and the Towards Russia Party have expressed their desire for the country to join the Union.
* had expressed interest in forming a separate customs union with Russia and Belarus by 2010. This Customs Union was formed as planned at the beginning of 2010. Kazakhstan has mentioned that it may join the Union State after some time. In late May 2023, however, President Kassym-Jomart Tokayev declined an offer by President Alexander Lukashenko to join the union, referring to it as a &quot;joke.&quot;
*: As of June 2007, opposition in Kyrgyzstan, which has been locked in political turmoil, had initiated a nationwide referendum to join the union of Russia and Belarus.
*: In 2001, president of Moldova Vladimir Voronin announced right after his election that he had plans for Moldova to join the Union of Russia and Belarus. The coming to power of the Alliance for European Integration at the 2009 Moldovan elections has since shifted Moldovan interest towards the European Union.
*: in the Transnistrian referendum of 2006, the government said 97.2% of the population voted for the integration of the unrecognized state of Transnistria into Russia, which analysts say indicates a possibility that Transnistria might unilaterally ask to join the Union, once it is established. Already in spring 1998, 66.5% of Transnistrian voters supported joining the Union of Russia and Belarus in a non-binding referendum by the Transnistrian state. However, not being recognised by either member, this is unlikely to happen in the near future.
*: In response to speculation about Ukraine joining the Union, then-president of Ukraine, Viktor Yanukovych, declared that Ukraine is an independent sovereign state and this is not something that can be questioned by anyone in the government. The issue is to be reconsidered in the new light of the Revolution of Dignity and the developments of the Euromaidan movement seeking for the integration into the European Union. During the term of office of the fifth President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko, the Constitution of Ukraine in 2019 was amended to consolidate the irreversibility of Ukraine&#x27;s course to join the European Union and NATO after the events of the Revolution of Dignity in 2014. In 2021, the sixth president of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, stated that the creation of a &quot;true union state&quot; between Belarus and Russia is a real danger for Ukraine. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022 in an escalation of the Russo-Ukrainian War that continues today.
*: During the 2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine, Deputy Prime Minister Rustam Temirgaliev of the Russian-annexed Republic of Crimea expressed the hope that southeastern Ukraine would form a &quot;Ukrainian Federation&quot; and join the Union State. However, only the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic and Luhansk People&#x27;s Republic broke away from Ukraine, and the confederate Novorossiya political project was frozen at the start of 2015.
*/: On April 12, 1999, the Federal Assembly of the FR Yugoslavia passed the Decision on the accession of the FRY to the Union state of Russia and Belarus. The legal successor of that decision is the Republic of Serbia. In 2007, Speaker of Parliament Tomislav Nikolić said during a speech that he wished that Serbia would strengthen its ties with and eventually join the Union State rather than joining the European Union, but he resigned from his position less than a week later. Although Nikolić did eventually serve as President of Serbia from 2012–2017, Serbia had submitted a membership application to the EU in 2009 and had received full candidate status in March 2012, prior to his term.

===Renewed interest===

On 15 December 2006, talks over the Union State were heating up. By January 2007, however, talks appeared to be stalled, as President Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus stated: &quot;The Russian leadership is demanding that we join the Russian Federation—that&#x27;s what is in the heads of the Russian leadership. I don&#x27;t want to bury the sovereignty and independence of [Belarus].&quot; He added: &quot;From all the consultations and discussions, I have understood that we have different approaches and understandings of the building of a Union State&quot;, and opposed &quot;the possibility of the incorporation into Russia [of Belarus]&quot;.

However, on 19 October 2007, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov announced that the budget of the Union State &quot;will grow by no less than ten percent next year, and that growth will provide for worthy funding of our common projects.&quot; This has led to speculation that the Russian government have renewed their interest in the idea.

A meeting between President Lukashenko of Belarus, President Vladimir Putin of Russia and Union State Secretary Pavel Borodin was held in Minsk 13–14 December 2007. This meeting received a considerable amount of media attention and raised speculation that a Union State might indeed be the focus of a new initiative by both governments. Of primary interest was renewed discussion of the Union Parliament (which, although planned, was never actually realized) and a &quot;Union State Constitutional Act&quot;, an instrument which could strengthen the authority of the Union. According to State Secretary Borodin, five variants of this Act were discussed at the meeting, each of which would involve a 7 to 10 year transitional period in the Union&#x27;s development. Trade and energy issues were also discussed.

On 27 May 2008, President Lukashenko, acting in his capacity as Chairman of the Supreme State Council named then Russian Prime Minister and current President Putin Chairman of the Council of Ministers. This move raised speculation that the Union was about to undergo a significant political transformation. However, the most visible and arguably important official in the Union has been the State Secretary, who runs the Union State&#x27;s day-to-day operations. In the same meeting, State Secretary Borodin announced that the 2009 Union State budget would total 6–7 billion roubles, an increase of over 2 billion roubles from 2008.

On 1 August 2011, Putin stated he supported a union of Russia, Belarus, and possibly South Ossetia. Belarusian Foreign Minister spokesman Andrei Savinykh rejected the idea, as did Dmitri Medojev, South Ossetia&#x27;s ambassador to Moscow, who stated &quot;Our people voted for independence in a referendum in 2006 and they do not relish the idea of becoming part of the Russian Federation.&quot;

Since 2015, focus on developing relations between former members of the Soviet Union is on continued development of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), itself a further development of the Eurasian Customs Union established in 2010. It is modelled on the integration of the European Union and comprises 5 member states: Belarus, Russia, Kazakhstan, Armenia and Kyrgyzstan. Tajikistan has also expressed an interest in joining. However, the EAEU is only an economic union, and at present, political integration remains within the remit of the Union State.

Deeper economic integration is proposed in 2021 within current talks of member states. In November 2021, Russia and Belarus signed an agreement to provide for common policies on taxation, banking, industry, agriculture, and energy.

====2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine====
Following the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, part of which was staged from Belarus&#x27; territory, Russia and Belarus came under sanctions and boycotts. On 3 March, Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko said he stood fully behind Russian president Vladimir Putin&#x27;s campaign in Ukraine as part of Belarus&#x27;s longstanding commitment to the Union State with Russia. On 14 March, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin met with Belarusian Prime Minister Roman Golovchenko in Moscow, telling reporters that they &quot;coordinated measures to protect our economic security and the technological sovereignty of Russia and Belarus&quot; and &quot;consider it necessary to strengthen integration in the Union State&quot;. On 18 March, the Russian government announced that all restrictions on the movement of citizens between Russia and Belarus would be lifted. On 1 July 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced that the &quot;unification&quot; process has been accelerated to alleviate the economic damage of the sanctions.

In October 2022, following the September 2022 mobilisation of reservists in Russia, a contingent of approximately 9,000 Russian soldiers arrived in Belarus. According to the Belarusian ministry of defence the purpose of this deployment was to create a &quot;regional military grouping&quot; of the Union State.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFE/RL October 2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month it was announced that Russian air forces were patrolling the borders of the Union State in Belarus.

====2023 nuclear deterrence====
In an interview aired by Russia&#x27;s state television in late May 2023, Lukashenko stated that other countries who were willing to join the Union State would be given nuclear weapons: &quot;If someone is worried... (then) it is very simple: join in the Union State of Belarus and Russia. That&#x27;s all: there will be nuclear weapons for everyone.&quot; This was just a few days after he had confirmed that the movement of some of Russia&#x27;s tactical nuclear weapons to Belarus had begun and the Russian Defence Minister had said he was signing documents concerning the procedure for storing tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus, the plan for which had first been announced by Putin in March.

====25th anniversary of the Treaty on the Creation of the Union State====
On 6 December 2024, coinciding with the 25th anniversary of the Treaty on the Creation of the Union State, signed on December 9, 1999, at a meeting of the Supreme State Council of the Union State, the Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Belarussian counterpart Alexander Lukashenko expanded the defense and security cooperation between the two countries by signing the Russia-Belarus Treaty on security guarantees within the Union State.

<text>Luis Trenker (born Alois Franz Trenker, 4 October 1892 – 12 April 1990) was a South Tyrolean film producer, director, writer, actor, architect, alpinist, and bobsledder.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Alois Franz Trenker was born on 4 October 1892 in Urtijëi, Tyrol (, ) in the Austro-Hungarian Empire (in present-day northern Italy). His father Jacob Trenker was a painter from North Tyrol, and his mother Karolina (&quot;née&quot; Demetz) was from Urtijëi in Val Gardena. He grew up speaking two languages: German, the language of his father, and Ladin, the language of his mother. He attended the local primary school from 1898 to 1901, and then attended the Josefinum in Bolzano in 1902 and 1903. From 1903 to 1905, he attended the arts and crafts school in Bolzano, where he developed his skills as a woodcarver.

In 1912, he entered the Realschule in Innsbruck, where he studied Italian as a foreign language. There he began his middle school studies. During his high school years, he spent his holidays working for mountain guides and ski instructors. After his matriculation examinations in 1912, Trenker studied architecture at the Technical University in Vienna.

===World War I===
At the start of World War I, Trenker fought as a cadet in an Austro-Hungarian heavy artillery unit on the Eastern Front in Galicia and Russisch-Polen. From 1915 to 1918, he fought in the mountain war against Italy, from 1916 in one of the Mountain Guide Companies () in the Dolomites. At the end of the war he had achieved the rank of Lieutenant. He would write 23 books based on his war experiences, the most important of which were &quot;Fort Rocca Alta&quot; and &quot;Berge in Flammen&quot;, the latter of which was made into the 1931 film &quot;Mountains on Fire&quot;.

At the end of the war, Trenker made several unsuccessful attempts to start an architecture business in Bolzano. In 1924 he graduated from the Technical University of Graz, and then worked as an architect in Bolzano, forming a business partnership with the Austrian architect Clemens Holzmeister. In 1924, Trenker participated in the Winter Olympic Games in Chamonix as a member of the Italian five-man bobsled team. Under the leadership of Pilot Lodovico Obexer, they ended up in sixth place.

===Film career===
Trenker&#x27;s first contact with film came in 1921, when he helped director Arnold Fanck on one of his mountain films. The main actor could not perform the stunts required, and so Trenker assumed the leading role. He gradually assumed more roles on the set, and by 1928 was directing, writing, and starring in his own films. By then, he had abandoned his job as an architect to concentrate on his films.

In 1928 he married Hilda von Bleichert, the daughter of a fabrics manufacturer from Leipzig, with whom he had four children. In 1932 Trenker created (with Curtis Bernhardt and Edwin H. Knopf) a historical film &quot;The Rebel&quot;. Trenker stated that the film&#x27;s plotline of a Tyrolean mountaineer Severin Anderlan leading a revolt against occupying French forces in 1809, during the Napoleonic Wars. The greatest Tirolean patriot Andreas Hofer was a proto-type of &quot;Severin Anderlan&quot; ... Trenker was designed to mirror what was happening in contemporary Germany as it rejected the terms of the Treaty of Versailles.

The main theme of Trenker&#x27;s work was the idealization of peoples connection with their homeland and pointing out the decadence of city life (most clearly visible in his 1934 film &quot;Der verlorene Sohn&quot; (&quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;). This loosely played into the hands of Nazi propagandists, who seized upon the nationalistic elements of his work. However, Trenker refused to allow his work to be subverted as such and eventually moved to Rome in 1940 to avoid further governmental pressure. After a pair of documentary films, however, Trenker returned to Bolzano and stopped making films. The style he had developed in the thirties was not limited to nationalistic, folkloristic, and heroic clichés. His impersonation of a hungry, downtrodden immigrant in depression era New York was regarded as one of the seminal scenes for future Italian neorealism by the likes of Roberto Rossellini.

===After World War II===
Trenker was accused of fascist opportunism after the war, but the charges were eventually dropped. In the 1950s, he returned to the movie industry, though by 1965 he was making primarily documentary films that focused on the Austrian province of Tyrol and South Tyrol (his homeland), which had become part of Italy. He also returned to writing about the mountains.

===Later life===
In 1988 Hilda Trenker von Bleichert died. Luis Trenker died on 13 April 1990 in Bolzano at the age 97. He was buried in his family&#x27;s plot at Urtijëi. In 1992, for the centennial of his birth, his native town of Ortisei dedicated a monument that shows him in mountaineer garb while looking at the Langkofel, a mountain he liked to climb. In March 2004, the Museum Gherdëina displayed a collection of Trenker&#x27;s belongings from a bequest of his family.

<text>Sooners is the name given to settlers who entered the Unassigned Lands illegally in what is now the state of Oklahoma before the official start of the Land Rush of 1889. The Unassigned Lands were a part of Indian Territory that, after a lobbying campaign, were to be opened to American settlement in 1889. President Benjamin Harrison officially proclaimed the Unassigned Lands open to settlement on April 22, 1889. As people lined up around the borders of the Oklahoma District, they waited for the official opening. It was not until noon that it officially was opened to settlement. The name derived from the &quot;sooner clause&quot; of &quot;Proclamation 288 — Opening to Settlement Certain Lands in the Indian Territory&quot;, which stated that anyone who entered and occupied the land prior to the opening time would be denied the right to claim land.

The designation &quot;Sooner&quot; had a very negative connotation. While &quot;Boomers&quot; were merely expressing &quot;pioneer spirit&quot; in their desire to take and settle former Indian territory, Sooners were essentially stealing from other white settlers by cheating on the claim requirements to get better land. However, these negative connotations cooled as time passed after 1889 and land claims were settled. In 1908, the University of Oklahoma football team adopted the nickname &quot;Sooners&quot;. The U.S. state of Oklahoma at times has been controversially nicknamed the &quot;Sooner State&quot; since the 1920s.

==Characteristics==
Sooners are not to be confused with deputy marshals, land surveyors, railroad employees, and others who were able to legally enter the territory early. Sooners who crossed into the territory illegally at night were originally also sometimes called &quot;moonshiners&quot; because they had entered &quot;by the light of the moon&quot;. These Sooners would hide in ditches at night and suddenly appear to stake their claim after the land run started, hours ahead of legal settlers.

==Relationship with Boomers==
The term Boomer relating to Oklahoma refers to participants in the &quot;Boomer Movement&quot;, white settlers who believed the Unassigned Lands were public property and open to anyone for settlement, not just Native American tribes. Their reasoning came from a clause in the Homestead Act of 1862, which said that any settler could claim of public land. Some Boomers entered and were removed more than once by the United States Army.

Those who actually observed the official start of the land run and began the race for free land often found choice sections of land already occupied by Sooners or, in some cases, by Boomers. Problems with Sooners continued with each successive land run; in an 1895 land run as much as half of the available land was taken by Sooners. Litigation between legitimate land-run participants and Sooners continued well into the 20th century, and eventually the United States Department of the Interior was given ultimate authority to settle the disputes.

==Sports==
In 1908, the University of Oklahoma adopted &quot;Sooners&quot; as the nickname of its football team, after having first tried &quot;Rough Riders&quot; and &quot;Boomers&quot;. Eventually, Oklahoma became known as &quot;The Sooner State&quot;. The school fight song is titled &quot;Boomer Sooner&quot;. The school &quot;mascot&quot; is a replica of a 19th-century covered wagon, called the &quot;Sooner Schooner&quot;. When the OU football team scores the Sooner Schooner is pulled across the field by a pair of ponies named &quot;Boomer&quot; and &quot;Sooner&quot;. There are a pair of costumed mascots also named &quot;Boomer&quot; and &quot;Sooner&quot;.

<text>Margarethe von Trotta () (born 21 February 1942, Berlin, Germany) is a German film director, screenwriter, and actress. She has been referred to as a &quot;leading force&quot; of the New German Cinema movement. Von Trotta&#x27;s extensive body of work has won awards internationally. She was married to and collaborated with director Volker Schlöndorff. Although they made a successful team, von Trotta felt she was seen as secondary to Schlöndorff. Subsequently, she established a solo career for herself and became &quot;Germany&#x27;s foremost female film director, who has offered the most sustained and successful female variant of &quot;Autorenkino&quot; in postwar German film history&quot;. Certain aspects of von Trotta&#x27;s work have been compared to Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s features from the 1960s and 1970s.

Von Trotta has been called &quot;the world&#x27;s leading feminist filmmaker&quot;. The predominant aim of her films is to create new representations of women. Her films are concerned with relationships between and among women (sisters, best friends, etc.), as well as with relationships between women and men, and include political settings. Nevertheless, she rejects the suggestion that she makes &quot;women&#x27;s films&quot;.

She is a recipient of one Golden Lion at Venice Film Festival, two David di Donatello Awards, Gold Hugo Award at Chicago International Film Festival, Lifetime Achievement Award at European Film Award, Lifetime Achievement Award at German Film Awards, two Palme d&#x27;Or nominations at Cannes Film Festival, and numerous other awards and nominations.

==Early life==
The child of Elisabeth von Trotta and painter Alfred Roloff, Margarethe von Trotta was born in Berlin. She and her mother moved to Düsseldorf after the end of World War II. Von Trotta shared a strong bond with her mother in the absence of her father. She has spoken about how her relationship with her mother gave her a sensitivity for friendships and solidarity between women, a theme that is seen in most of her films.

==Career==
Von Trotta relocated to Paris in the 1960s, where she worked for film collectives, collaborating on scripts and co-directing short films.

In her early career, von Trotta was an actress, appearing in the early films of directors Rainer Werner Fassbinder and Volker Schlöndorff. In one of many interviews, von Trotta said: &quot;I came from Germany before the New Wave, so we had all these silly movies. Cinema for me was entertainment, but it was not art. When I came to Paris, I saw several films of Ingmar Bergman, and all of the sudden I understood what cinema could be. I saw the films of Alfred Hitchcock and the French Nouvelle Vague. I stood there and said, &#x27;that is what I&#x27;d like to do with my life.&#x27; But that was 1962, and you couldn&#x27;t think that a woman could be a director. In a way, as an unconscious act, I started acting and when the New German films started, I tried to get in through acting.&quot; Through her acting career, von Trotta was able to create an initial name for herself before becoming a director.

Her first input on a film, before making a solo-career out of it, was on Volker Schlöndorff&#x27;s &quot;The Sudden Wealth of the Poor People of Kombach&quot;(1971), which she also acted in. In 1975, they proceeded to co-write and co-direct &quot;The Lost Honor of Katharina Blum&quot; (&quot;Die verlorene Ehre der Katharina Blum&quot;) which was based on an adaptation of Heinrich Böll&#x27;s novel that dealt with &quot;political repression in the Federal Republic&quot;. Within this first film of von Trotta&#x27;s, one can see the conflict &quot;between the personal and the public&quot; that resonates throughout her early film career. The female characters within the story must occupy suffocating spaces that von Trotta uses to represent the confinement that women are subjected to in a world run by men. Von Trotta was in charge of supervising the performance aspect while Schlöndorff dealt with the film&#x27;s mechanics. As a director, he was not considered to be very audacious, while von Trotta&#x27;s strong suit was in how she directed the film&#x27;s actors &quot;through whom she creates her story&quot;. Thus the two were able to complement each other. Their film was considered to be &quot;the most successful German film of the mid-1970s&quot;. The couple collaborated on one more film, &quot;Coup de Grâce&quot; (1976), where von Trotta helped to write but not direct the work, before she branched off into her own career.

Trotta&#x27;s first solo film was &quot;The Second Awakening of Christa Klages&quot; (&quot;Das zweite Erwachen der Christa Klages&quot;) in 1978, which focused on &quot;a young woman&#x27;s political radicalization.&quot; This film presented multiple subjects that von Trotta&#x27;s films would be known for in the future: &quot;female bonding, sisterhood, and the uses and effects of violence&quot;. The film&#x27;s script used real-life information about the seizure of school teacher Margit Czenki from Munich.

Throughout her years of filmmaking, von Trotta has addressed many points of special concern to women: &quot;abortion, contraception, the situation of women at work, spousal abuse, and [the] traditional female role&quot;.

In 2001 she was the president of the jury at the 23rd Moscow International Film Festival.

She is a professor of film at the European Graduate School in Saas-Fee and remains an important personality of German cinema.

===The Sister Films===
Margarethe von Trotta&#x27;s second feature film was &quot;Sisters, or the Balance of Happiness&quot; (&quot;Schwestern oder die Balance des Glücks&quot;, 1979). Unintentionally, she created a &quot;trilogy of sister films&quot; with her succeeding works: &quot;Marianne and Juliane&quot; (&quot;Die Bleierne Zeit&quot;, 1981) and &quot;Three Sisters&quot; (&quot;Fürchten und Lieben&quot;, 1988). Barbara Quart, author of the book &quot;Women Directors&quot;, commented on the three works: &quot;It is the quest for wholeness that is the preoccupation of von Trotta&#x27;s entire sister series.&quot; The women in these films are born into a traditional time (late 1940s and &#x27;50s), but they reject the positions that society has established for women. As well, the topic of suicide plays an important role in the first two films and how the live sister connects to the dead one. These three films investigate sisterhood and their bonds within a world that is falling apart all around them; this matter places von Trotta&#x27;s work into New German Cinema.

&quot;Sisters, or The Balance of Happiness&quot; delves into bonds, both physically and mentally, between sisters Maria and Anna, along with a third party. The siblings are close before Anna commits suicide, but hidden behind her facial expressions is a desire to escape this feeling of frustration between following what she wants and what Maria asks of her. Maria faces post suicide trauma, coping with her devastation by transplanting the memory of her sister onto her co-worker, Miriam. This ultimately leads Maria to deal with her inner issues so she can try to move on with her life in a peaceful manner. This film garnered the Grand Prix Award at Créteil International Women&#x27;s Film Festival in 1981.

&quot;Marianne and Juliane&quot; (also known in English as &quot;The German Sisters&quot;) (1981) also deals with losing a sister and learning how to handle the grief. Marianne and Juliane grow much closer after Marianne is put behind bars for her radical, terrorist activities. After unexpected news of Marianne&#x27;s death, Juliane becomes obsessed with finding out the truth behind the supposed suicide, which she does not believe to be true. The characters are based on the real-life Christiane and Gudrun Ensslin, which made &quot;feminist critics&quot; give extra notice to this work in comparison to all other films that von Trotta has done. Critics question the way von Trotta structured the plot and why she positioned it from that of Christiane&#x27;s character, Juliane, instead of from Gudrun (Marianne). The film is characterized by the use of multiple flashback sequences, jumping between present day to childhood and everywhere in between, breaking any chance of a linear structure. In this film, it is predominantly the Nazi era that influences Marianne and Juliane, albeit in different ways.A theme within &quot;Marianne and Juliane&quot; that von Trotta uses throughout her works is that of &quot;the personal is political&quot;. In Marianne&#x27;s jail cell, the sisters come to terms with &quot;their personal and political differences&quot;. One take on this theme is that Marianne&#x27;s personal past has fostered her political, terrorist present. In the story&#x27;s present day, her political actions effect her personal life: she is sentenced to prison and dies in her cell, her husband takes his own life, and her son is put in danger. Not surprisingly, this film was the subject of much debate from conservatives who believed that Marianne&#x27;s character as a terrorist was given too much understanding. This film won the AGIS Award, FIPRESCI Prize, Golden Lion Award, New Cinema Award, and OCIC Award at the Venice Film Festival in 1981, along with a few more listed in the awards section. Von Trotta winning the Golden Lion was a true achievement for women in film, for an honor of this stature had not been awarded to a female director since Leni Reifenstahl received &quot;the Mussolini Cup&quot; in 1938 for &quot;Olympia&quot;. In 1994 Ingmar Bergman listed it as one of his favorite 11 films of all time.

&quot;Love and Fear&quot; or &quot;Paura e amore&quot; (in Italy), also known as &quot;Trois Soeurs&quot; (in France) or Three Sisters (1988) – von Trotta&#x27;s sixth feature-length film – focuses on a set of three sisters: Olga, Masha, and Irina. It is through these females that von Trotta is able to present her opinions concerning the stature of females in society and the traditional politics of the time that play a role in shaping their lives. Once again, this film deals with sisters who yearn for significance in all aspects of their lives (Rueschmann, 168). Their constant quest for love is the way they cope with the unfavorable aspects of life. Compared to the other two preceding films in the &quot;sister series&quot;, &quot;Love and Fear&quot; contains key melodramatic elements that focus on one&#x27;s feelings and anguish. It does not address politics as heavily as the other films, but more on von Trotta&#x27;s take of the distinction between men and women in society. This film was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or Award at the Cannes Film Festival in 1988.

===&quot;Sheer Madness&quot;===

&quot;Sheer Madness&quot; (&quot;Heller Wahn&quot;, 1983), one of von Trotta&#x27;s popular feature films, also uses suicide as an important part of the storyline. An analysis on the film given by authors Susan Linville and Kent Casper reads: &quot;suicidal states of mind may stem not from negative distortions of external reality, but from an accurate assessment of the way things are.&quot; Within this story, once again, women&#x27;s feelings are investigated through the friendship between two females, Ruth and Olga. This film gave the impression that, supposedly, von Trotta was a &quot;man-hater.&quot; Von Trotta won the OCIC Award-Honorable Mention at the Berlin International Film Festival in the Forum of New Cinema for &quot;Sheer Madness&quot; in 1983. This film was also nominated for the Golden Bear at the Berlin International Film Festival in the same year.

===&quot;Rosa Luxemburg&quot;===

Von Trotta&#x27;s 1986 eponymous film about the feminist and marxist socialist Rosa Luxemburg examines both her &quot;life as a public revolutionary and her private experience as a woman&quot;. Barbara Sukowa, who stars in several of von Trotta&#x27;s films, won the Best Actress honors at Cannes in 1986 for her delivery of the main role. Through her cinematic vision, von Trotta returns to the theme of &quot;the political and the personal&quot;, giving fair attention to both Luxemburg&#x27;s personal life as a female in society and her political life as a &quot;public revolutionary&quot;. &quot;Rosa Luxemburg&quot; was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at Cannes Film Festival in 1986. This film won the Guild Film Award-Gold at the Guild of German Art House Cinemas in German Film in 1987.

===&quot;Rosenstrasse&quot;===

Looking forward to some of von Trotta&#x27;s more contemporary films, this same idea of female bonds and their emotions is still center stage, such as in her piece from 2003, &quot;Rosenstrasse&quot;. The film uses melodramatic elements, like in &quot;Paura e amore&quot; (1988), to express the emotions of the characters. The difference here is that &quot;Rosenstrasse&quot; is a &quot;maternal melodrama.&quot; There are three overlapping familial connections involving &quot;mother-daughter relationships&quot; within the story: &quot;the bond between Hannah, a first-generation Jewish American, and her mother Ruth&quot;; &quot;the...mother-daughter bond between Ruth and her Jewish mother Miriam&quot;; &quot;and...the central relationship between surrogate mother Lena von Eschenbach/Fisher and Ruth.&quot; In this, the definition of a mother is stretched from the &quot;biological&quot; standpoint to the &quot;symbolic.&quot;

===&quot;Vision&quot;===

The film &quot;Vision&quot; (2009) chronicles the true tale of Hildegard von Bingen, a nun who stands for another of von Trotta&#x27;s independent women protagonists—one who fights the patriarchal society of the church by foregoing the established rules of conduct and, upon learning one of her fellow sisters is with child, asks for a different area for the nuns to call their own. In an interview between von Trotta and Damon Smith from &quot;Filmmaker Magazine&quot;, von Trotta explains her choice for the subject of her film: &quot;When I&#x27;m searching for a woman in the very distant past, I look for a woman who is in a way near to my own vision...I am always attracted by a woman who has to fight for her own life and her own reality, who has to get out of a certain situation of imprisonment, to free [herself]. That is perhaps the main theme in all my films.&quot;

Again, a deep bond is witnessed in this story, as in the rest of von Trotta&#x27;s films, between Hildegard and a young nun, Richardis. Continuing with the interview, von Trotta says, &quot;It&#x27;s not a lesbian love! At one point she [Hildegard] says, ‘She is my mother and I&#x27;m her mother, I&#x27;m her daughter and she&#x27;s my daughter.’ Hildegard couldn&#x27;t have children, so in a way Richardis is her daughter and friend and mother [all at once]; it&#x27;s a very deep love.&quot;

Von Trotta wanted to make a film with a female protagonist that viewers could relate to instead of looking at her from below, as she clarifies in an interview with Zeitgeist Films: 
:The figures that appeal to me are always strong women who also have moments of weakness; therefore, I never try to make heroines out of them. Instead I show how they fought to find their own way, how they put themselves out there, and how much they had to swallow in order to find themselves. I am fascinated by how they overcome obstacles in order to achieve their goals. Hildegard von Bingen had a dream of founding her own abbey, and she suffered a lot of setbacks in the process. The moments of her greatest weakness are when the nun Richardis is to be taken away from her. In this situation, she behaves either like a small, abandoned child, or with fury. This conduct is all recorded in her letters. And it is precisely these moments of extreme self-abandonment that I find so beautiful, surprising, and contradictory. Hildegard von Bingen demands for herself what she usually gives to others. I absolutely did not want to portray her as a saint.

===&quot;Hannah Arendt&quot;===

&quot;Hannah Arendt&quot; (2012) portrays an important segment in the life of the German-Jewish academic Hannah Arendt. In an interview with Thilo Wydra, von Trotta is asked if Arendt is similar to the women she has portrayed in past films. Von Trotta replies with an explanation about how real-life characters from her past films, &quot;Rosa Luxemburg&quot; and &quot;Die bleierne Zeit&quot; (&quot;Marianne and Juliane&quot;), fought and died for causes they found to be right: Luxemburg wanted more equality in her community, and Gudrun Ensslin (Marianne) wanted to revolutionize humanity. Von Trotta says, &quot;Hannah Arendt is a woman who fits into my personal mold of historically important women that I have portrayed in my films. ‘I want to understand,’ was one of her guiding principles. I feel that applies to myself and my films as well.

===Television work===

The common problem that filmmakers run into is budget issues and where they get their funds; during the mid-eighties, many films went under due to money cuts by the &quot;German subvention system.&quot; Several of von Trotta&#x27;s fellow women filmmakers took the safe route and went into the education field in media. But not Margarethe von Trotta—to stay in the game, she accepted proposals for TV pieces, even if it meant losing a bit of her artistic allowances. Her first piece for television was &#x27; (1997), which was the first time she did not compose the screenplay for a work she was directing. She followed this with three more TV films: &#x27; (1997), &#x27; (1997), and &#x27; (2000). Through her experience of working in television, von Trotta learned how to try to hold on to her stamp as an &quot;independent filmmaker&quot; in terms of keeping her artistic approach.

== Personal life ==
In 1964, von Trotta married Jürgen Moeller and had one son, German documentary director Felix Moeller. They divorced in 1968 and von Trotta married German filmmaker Volker Schlöndorff. Together, they raised Felix and worked together on film projects.

Von Trotta and Schlöndorff&#x27;s film collaboration in Germany during the politically turbulent 1970s is documented in Felix&#x27;s 2018 film &quot;Sympathisanten: Unser Deutscher Herbst&quot; (&quot;Sympathizers: our German Autumn&quot;).

<text>Sir George Williams University was a university in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It merged with Loyola College to create Concordia University on August 24, 1974.

==History==

In 1851, the first YMCA in North America was established on Sainte-Hélène Street in Old Montreal. Beginning in 1873, the YMCA offered evening classes to allow working people in the English-speaking community to pursue their education while working during the day. Sixty years later, the Montreal YMCA relocated to its current location on Stanley Street in Downtown Montreal.

In 1926, the education program at the YMCA was re-organized as Sir George Williams College, named after George Williams, founder of the original YMCA in London, upon which the Montreal YMCA was based. In 1934, Sir George Williams College offered the first undergraduate credit course in adult education in Canada.

Sir George Williams College received its university charter from the provincial government in 1948, though it remained the education arm of the Montreal YMCA. Sir George Williams expanded into its first standalone building, the Norris Building, in 1956. In 1959, the college requested that the Quebec legislature amend its university charter, changing its name to Sir George Williams University. It established a Centre for Human Relations and Community Studies in 1963. Sir George Williams continued to hold classes in the YMCA building until the construction of the Henry F. Hall Building in 1966.

Following several years of discussions and planning, Sir George Williams University merged with Loyola College to create Concordia University in 1974. Concordia provided students with representative student organizations and greater power over administrative decisions at the university.

===Sir George Williams Computer Centre Incident===

The university gained international attention in 1969, when a group of Black students occupied the Henry F. Hall Building&#x27;s 9th floor computer lab to protest alleged racism by the university. This protest was documented in the 2015 film &quot;The Ninth Floor&quot; by director Mina Shum.

==Sir George Williams Georgians==
The Sir George Williams Georgians were the Canadian Interuniversity Athletics Union teams that represented Sir George Williams University.

Shortly after Sir George Williams merged with Loyola College to create Concordia University in 1974, the Georgians and the Loyola Warriors were replaced by the Concordia Stingers.

<text>In the case of a radio failure or aircraft not equipped with a radio, or in the case of a deaf pilot, air traffic control may use a signal lamp (called a &quot;signal light gun&quot; or &quot;light gun&quot; by the FAA) to direct the aircraft. ICAO regulations require air traffic control towers to possess such signal lamps. The signal lamp has a focused bright beam and is capable of emitting three different colors: red, white and green. These colors may be flashed or steady, and have different meanings to aircraft in flight or on the ground. Planes can acknowledge the instruction by rocking their wings, moving the ailerons if on the ground, or by flashing their landing or navigation lights during hours of darkness. Air traffic control signal light guns are typically specified with a (white) center beam brightness of &gt; 180,000 - 200,000 candela, and are visible for roughly 4 miles in clear daylight conditions. The table below describes the meaning of the signals. The use of handheld combination red/green/white signal lamps for air traffic control dates back to at least the 1930s.

<doc id="870269" wikidata="Q869842" url="?curid=870269" title="Everytime">
<text>&quot;Everytime&quot; is a song by American singer Britney Spears from her fourth studio album, &quot;In the Zone&quot; (2003). It was released as the third single from &quot;In the Zone&quot; on May 10, 2004, by Jive Records. After her relationship with Justin Timberlake ended in 2002, Spears became friends with her background singer Annet Artani. They started writing songs together at Spears&#x27; house in Los Angeles, and then traveled to Lombardy, Italy, where they collaborated on &quot;Everytime&quot;. Musically, it is a piano-driven pop ballad, which lyrically pleas for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. Spears composed the music herself and wrote the lyrics with Artani about a romantic breakup.

&quot;Everytime&quot; received universal acclaim from music critics, who praised its lyrics, composition, and Spears&#x27; breathy vocals and songwriting, deeming it amongst the highlights of &quot;In the Zone&quot;. Commercially, it became a global success, topping the charts in five countries, including Australia and the United Kingdom, and reached the top-ten in 16 other markets. In the United States, the single peaked at number 15 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Spears did a series of live performances, such as for TV shows &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on NBC and &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in the United Kingdom. On her tours, Spears also performed the song on piano in a flower-themed setting at The Onyx Hotel Tour (2004), while suspended on a giant umbrella at The Circus Starring Britney Spears (2009) and in an angel costume at (2013). The song has been covered by artists like Glen Hansard, Ethel Cain, Kelly Clarkson, Lewis Capaldi, and James Franco in the 2013 film &quot;Spring Breakers&quot;.

Inspired by the cinematography of the 1995 film &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot;, the accompanying music video for &quot;Everytime&quot; was directed by David LaChapelle. It features Spears as a pop star fighting with a male companion as she is hounded by paparazzi. She starts to drown in her bathtub after bleeding from a head wound. In the hospital, doctors fail to resuscitate her, while simultaneously a child is born in the next room (implying she has been reincarnated). The original concept had Spears kill herself from a drug overdose, but that part of the plot was removed after it received criticism from organizations such as Kidscape, who perceived it as a glamorization of suicide. Critics took note of the video for its religious references to &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, Kabbalah and stigmata, as well as for foreshadowing Spears&#x27; own struggles with fame.

==Background and writing==
Spears&#x27;s three-year relationship with singer-songwriter Justin Timberlake ended in 2002 after months of speculation. In November 2002, Timberlake released the song &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; as the second single from his debut solo album &quot;Justified&quot;. The song&#x27;s music video featured a Spears lookalike and fueled the rumors that she had been unfaithful to him. &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; is often credited as being the song that propelled &quot;Justified&quot; into the charts. In September 2001, Annet Artani accepted an offer to become a backing vocalist for Spears&#x27;s 2001–02 Dream Within a Dream Tour. Her interactions with Spears during most of the tour were limited to small conversations at the gym and vocal warm ups. Artani had begun a relationship with the show&#x27;s musical director during 2002; however, it was not working out well by the end of the tour. Before the final date in Mexico City, Spears called her and asked about the relationship. Artani told her they were going to break up, to which Spears responded, &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about it, you&#x27;re going to hang out with me.&quot; Concluded the tour, Spears and Artani began to forge a friendship. Spears invited Artani to her house in Los Angeles. According to Artani, their relationship grew out of their shared romantic experiences at the time. She explained, &quot;Basically, we commiserated because she, at that time, had broken up with Justin [Timberlake]. Maybe like nine months before, but of course it was really fresh in the media. I was just breaking up with this guy, so we kind of like—I think we kind of needed each other.&quot; Artani stayed at Spears&#x27;s house for a few weeks, in which they started writing songs at the piano. Shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Artani added, &quot;It was me and her, her stylist and Felicia, and we had this humongous house to ourselves, and they had a piano there as well.&quot;

According to Artani, &quot;Everytime&quot; was written in large part as a response to &quot;Cry Me a River&quot; as well as various radio interviews. Artani explained, &quot;He was getting personal. Here, she had a different type of image, and he was really exposing some stuff that she probably didn&#x27;t want out there, and in front of her little sister ... I remember her sister being mortified and her being mortified. I&#x27;m sure that that really hurt her.&quot; The song was also speculated to be a reply to Timberlake&#x27;s &quot;Never Again&quot;, a ballad which appeared on his debut solo album &quot;Justified&quot;. &quot;Everytime&quot; was recorded at Conway Studios in Los Angeles and mixed at Frou Frou Central in London, England. During an interview with Hip Online, Spears commented about the recording sessions, saying,

&quot;... Like with &#x27;Everytime&#x27; I wrote the whole thing from scratch on the piano. Musically there was no track or anything. I was just at my house and I did the whole thing by myself. And then I went and I played it for [Guy Sigsworth] and I just basically told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there&#x27;s a lot of producers you tell them things and they don&#x27;t get it. And you&#x27;re like oh, that&#x27;s not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing. And so that song specifically, you know, I did everything.&quot;

&quot;Everytime&quot; was one of the first songs finished for &quot;In the Zone&quot;, previewed on May 30, 2003, to Quddus Philippe of MTV at Battery Studios in New York City. It was registered with the U.S. Copyright Office on April 26, 2003, under the title of &quot;Everytime I Try&quot; and SRU000530591 registration number with a given recording year of 2002. Spears named it the most personal song on the album along with &quot;Touch of My Hand&quot;, explaining, &quot;It&#x27;s one of the songs that when you hear, it&#x27;s like the kind of song when you go to heaven. It kind of takes you away. You know, it takes you in to a very cool consciousness I think.&quot;

==Composition==
&quot;Everytime&quot; is a pop ballad. It begins with a music box introduction accompanying Spears&#x27;s breathy vocals, which build from soft to strong through the song. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, &quot;Everytime&quot; is composed in the key of E major, with a tempo of 110 beats per minute. Spears&#x27;s vocal range spans from the low note of A3 to the high note of E5. &quot;Everytime&quot; lyrics are a plea for forgiveness for inadvertently hurting a former lover. In the song, the singer explains she feels unable to continue in lines such as &quot;Everytime I try to fly I fall / Without my wings I feel so small&quot;. Jennifer Vineyard of MTV compared the song lyrically to another ballad from &quot;In the Zone&quot;, &quot;Shadow&quot;, since they both speak &quot;about how reminders of a lover can still linger after he&#x27;s gone.&quot; During an interview with Jennifer Vineyard of MTV, Spears said about &quot;Everytime&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s about heartbreak, it&#x27;s about your first love, your first true love. That&#x27;s something all people can relate to, because you all have that first love that you think you&#x27;re going to be with the rest of your life.&quot; When asked if &quot;Everytime&quot; was about Timberlake during an interview with Diane Sawyer in &quot;PrimeTime&quot;, she responded &quot;I&#x27;ll let the song speak for itself.&quot; In 2023, in excerpts from Spears&#x27; memoir &quot;The Woman in Me&quot;, Spears revealed that she became pregnant with Timberlake&#x27;s child in 2000 and had undergone an abortion, leading many to speculate the song was about said abortion. However, the co-writer Annet Artani disputed this claim, stating the song was written mostly about a breakup Artani herself had gone through.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Everytime&quot; received widespread acclaim from music critics, who complimented its lyrical content and Spears&#x27; breathy vocals, while others deemed it a standout track on &quot;In the Zone&quot;. Gavin Mueller of &quot;Stylus Magazine&quot; considered &quot;Everytime&quot; to be the best track on &quot;In the Zone&quot;, explaining &quot;it is just a spare piano ballad, simple yet effectively fragile&quot;. Ali Fenwick of &quot;The Johns Hopkins News-Letter&quot; complimented Spears&#x27; songwriting and added the song &quot;shows a glimmer of the talent that hides behind the robotic, synthed-out vocals on the rest of the album&quot;. Christy Lemire of &quot;MSNBC&quot; called it &quot;actually a pretty tune&quot; and named it the best ballad in &quot;Greatest Hits: My Prerogative&quot;. Jason Shawhan of About.com said &quot;Everytime&quot; &quot;screams Single!&quot;. For Daniel Megarry from &quot;Gay Times&quot;, it&#x27;s &quot;one of the most stunningly heartbreaking songs of all time&quot;. Nayer Nissim, from &quot;Pink News&quot;, wrote that &quot;despite some limp efforts scattered around her albums, Britney can actually do some utterly compelling and heartbreaking ballads, and this is her very best. Beautiful, disarming, and emotionally raw&quot;. Digital Spy&#x27;s Alim Kheraj praised its &quot;lullaby-like production, wonderfully simple piano riff and confessional lyrics&quot;.

For Alex Macpherson from &quot;The Guardian&quot;, it&#x27;s one of the best examples of Spears&#x27; &quot;distressing vulnerability&quot; as well as her fifth best song; &quot;one of Britney&#x27;s oddest curveballs was following the gleaming banger &#x27;Toxic&#x27;, with its polar opposite. [...] [&#x27;Everytime&#x27;] is a rare pop hit that seizes attention by shrinking further away&quot;. Spence D. of IGN said the song &quot;continues to mine the &quot;Zone&quot; turf and unleashes what is ostensibly Britney&#x27;s first mature ballad, at least in terms of being musically staid and stripped of any danceteria sweat and gloss&quot;. Linda McGee of RTÉ.ie said that along with &quot;In the Zone&quot;″s &quot;Brave New Girl&quot;, they were &quot;individually impressive&quot;, but disrupted the direction of the album. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; commented, &quot;With its dainty piano, &#x27;Everytime&#x27; plays like a forlorn postmortem on her Justin Timberlake era.&quot; In 2016, the staff from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; placed it at number six on their ranking of Spears&#x27; songs and called it &quot;her finest ballad and one of the most emotionally affecting songs of her career&quot;. Sterling Clover of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it &quot;a weeper in the best &#x27;Time After Time&#x27; (1984) tradition.&quot; William Shaw of &quot;Blender&quot; said that while &quot;Everytime&quot; was not her greatest ballad, the lyrics were &quot;certainly heartfelt&quot;. A reviewer from the &quot;Huddersfield Daily Examiner&quot; stated, &quot;[the] breathy ballad [has] got a stage musical feel to it, but Britney&#x27;s no Elaine Paige&quot;. Sal Cinquemani of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; named it along with &quot;Shadow&quot; &quot;two sappy ballads&quot;.

==Commercial performance==
On May 22, 2004, &quot;Everytime&quot; debuted at number 61 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, becoming the &quot;Highest Debut&quot; of the week. On July 3, 2004, it peaked at number 15 and stayed in the position for four weeks. The song also peaked at number four on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Pop Songs and at number 17 and number 25 on the Hot Dance Club Songs and Adult Pop Songs charts, respectively. On November 18, 2004, &quot;Everytime&quot; was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) selling 500,000 copies.

==Music video==
===Development and release===
On March 9, 2004, the treatment of the music video for &quot;Everytime&quot; was released online. It featured Spears as a star hounded by photographers, who eventually kills herself by taking prescription drugs and drowning in a bathtub. The suicide scene was perceived to be Spears&#x27;s response to rumors that suggested she suffered from a mental disorder. After news of the concept broke, it was criticized by a number of organizations in the United States and the United Kingdom. MTV News&#x27; &quot;You Tell Us&quot; received numerous letters from upset viewers, who criticized Spears, saying they perceived the ending as a glamorization of suicide. On March 12, 2004, Spears announced through her label that she had removed the concept, &quot;due to the potential for a fictional accidental occurrence to be misinterpreted as a suicide&quot;. She also clarified it was not her intent to present suicide in any sort of positive light.

The video was directed by David LaChapelle and shot on March 13–14, 2004, in Los Angeles. The lighting was described as &quot;saturated, but low and naturalistic&quot; to give the video a cinematic feel, referencing the film &quot;Leaving Las Vegas&quot; (1995). It premiered on &quot;TRL&quot; on April 12, 2004. Spears called the show and explained the video explored reincarnation. She added, &quot;It&#x27;s more like a movie. It&#x27;s different than anything I&#x27;ve ever done. It&#x27;s dark, and it shows me in a different light. Of course, I&#x27;m going to go back and do dance videos, but I wanted to be inspired and challenged.&quot; The video was released through a DVD single in the United Kingdom. An alternate version of the video which only features Spears singing in the white hallway scenes was released on the 2004 DVD &quot;Greatest Hits: My Prerogative&quot;.

===Synopsis===

The video begins with an aerial shot of Las Vegas, showing the Palms Casino Resort and continues with a shot of a marquee hotel that reads &quot;&quot;Britney Spears Live from Miami&quot; The Onyx Hotel Tour Las Vegas&quot;, with a picture of Spears holding a leather strap and referencing her Showtime concert special from Miami. Christian author Eva Marie Everson compared the image to &quot;Madonna doing her own impersonation of Marilyn Monroe&quot;. Spears and her boyfriend (played by Stephen Dorff) arrive at the hotel inside a limousine. They sit apart from each other, staring out separate windows. Spears wears a Birmingham Barons cap in these scenes. The boyfriend is talking on his cell phone, and when she attempts to get his attention, he puts his index finger up indicating he is unable to shift his attention to her at that moment. The entrance is full of fans and paparazzi taking pictures. When they leave the car, fans and paparazzi alike act in an extreme way and fights break out in the crowd. While her bodyguards try to protect her, her boyfriend throws magazines at the paparazzi. Stephanie Zacharek of &quot;The New York Times&quot; compared the shots of the paparazzi with the Jews in the film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; (2004). During this scene, she gets hit in the head with a camera, and unknowingly gets a wound on her head, but keeps walking.

Inside their hotel room, Spears and her boyfriend start shouting at each other. When he tries to make amends and get close to her, she brushes off his attempts and walks away. Her boyfriend gets mad and then throws a vase at the wall while Spears goes into the bathroom, hurling a drink at the mirror. She begins to fill the bathtub and remove her clothes. After this, the video includes intercut scenes of a close-up of Spears singing in a white coat in front of a bright white light. As she lies in the bathtub, a red string, a custom associated with Kabbalah, is seen on her wrist. She touches her head and looks at her hand, realizing she is bleeding from the wound. Writer Jennifer Vineyard of &quot;MTV News&quot; speculated the blood in her hand is stigmata, but also indicates she did not know where the blood was coming from, meaning Vineyard may have missed the camera hitting Spears&#x27; head and that this is a misinterpretation. She loses consciousness in the bathtub and drowns. Shortly after, her boyfriend finds her and tries to resuscitate her. Meanwhile, it is revealed that in the close-up scenes Spears is actually inside a hospital hallway. The video continues with scenes of her being carried into an ambulance and surrounded by photographers, as well as scenes of her being resuscitated by doctors in a hospital bed. The ghost of Spears in a white shirt watches herself in the bed and walks into the next room, where a baby girl is born. Spears is then seen running away from the camera into the light. The music video ends with her rising from under the water, resting her head and smiling, suggesting the whole scene of her death was a dream or a morbid fantasy.

===Reception===
Eva Marie Everson wrote that the music video showed the reality &quot;behind the glitz and the glamour&quot;. Dominic Fox commented, &quot;Even in its bowdlerised form, the &#x27;Everytime&#x27; video presents a moment of existential indecision, a fugue of suicidal ideation in which the singer fantasises about her own death&quot;. While reviewing the music video for her 2009 single &quot;If U Seek Amy&quot;, James Montgomery of MTV called the music video for &quot;Everytime&quot; &quot;underrated&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in their 2009 article &quot;Britney Spears: The Complete Video Guide&quot;, called it &quot;horribly prophetic and depressing&quot; and added that the clip foreshadowed Spears&#x27;s struggles with fame and mental instability during 2007 and 2008.

==Live performances==

On October 18, 2003, &quot;Everytime&quot; was performed by Spears for the first time during the twenty-ninth season of the American comedy show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. She also performed it at &quot;Britney Spears: In the Zone&quot;, a concert special that aired in ABC on November 17, 2003. &quot;Everytime&quot; was also performed by Spears at 2004&#x27;s The Onyx Hotel Tour. Before the tour began, Spears said that it was one of the songs she was looking most forward to perform, explaining, &quot;I really think I&#x27;m talking to everyone when I perform &#x27;Everytime&#x27;&quot;. It was the first song of the third act, titled &quot;Mystic Garden&quot;. It began with a video interlude in which Spears walked into a garden wearing a rainbow-colored dress and sat in a flower-covered piano. As the video ended, it was revealed that she was sitting onstage in a similar setting. She started the performance talking to the audience about the media coverage of her personal life. She played the piano and sang until the second verse, where she stood up and walked to the center of the stage to continue the performance. Neil Strauss of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented, &quot;It was the only song that she appeared to sing unaccompanied by backing tapes&quot;. Kelefa Sanneh of &quot;Blender&quot; called it the best performance of the show.

&quot;Everytime&quot; was also performed by Spears at the British music chart show &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; in June 2004. Spears also performed the song at 2009&#x27;s The Circus Starring Britney Spears. &quot;Everytime&quot; was the only song that was not included in the released setlist, and was added as a surprise. It was the sixth and last song of the second act, titled &quot;House of Fun (Anything Goes)&quot;. After a Bollywood-inspired performance of &quot;Me Against the Music&quot; from &quot;In the Zone&quot;, Spears sat on a giant umbrella in the middle of the stage and briefly talked to the audience. She performed &quot;Everytime&quot; while the umbrella was lifted into the air. Spears included &quot;Everytime&quot; on the setlist for her Las Vegas residency, . After a brief interlude, descended from the ceiling as a &quot;giant, white-winged angel&quot;. After a snow shower of confetti, the song transitioned into &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot;.

==Cover versions==

&quot;Everytime&quot; was covered by Glen Hansard of Irish band The Frames. It was recorded during a live show at Today FM and released in the 2004 covers compilation, &quot;Even Better than the Real Thing Vol. 2&quot;. It was also covered in Mandarin by Taiwanese girl group S.H.E and released on their studio album &quot;Encore&quot; (2004). Their version was retitled &quot;Bié Shuō Duìbùqǐ&quot; ( &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Sorry&quot;). American pop rock singer Sally Maer also covered &quot;Everytime&quot; to release it on her studio album &quot;Bed of Roses&quot; (2008). &quot;Everytime&quot; was used during the 2009 Irish production of the 1896 play &quot;The Seagull&quot;. Jackie Evancho covered the song for her debut album &quot;Prelude to a Dream&quot; (2009). On August 19, 2010, her version debuted at number three on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Classical Digital Songs chart. British singer Cher Lloyd covered the song live on &quot;The X Factor&quot; in the United Kingdom in 2010. On July 27, 2012, Kelly Clarkson covered the song during the Las Vegas stop of her summer tour, as an audience request. Clarkson had a harpist accompany her during the performance, and told the audience, &quot;This song is one of my favourite songs. [...] I actually prefer [Spears&#x27;s] version better, because it just sounds really sad, but I&#x27;m going to try and do it.&quot; Spears approved of Clarkson&#x27;s cover via her Twitter account, calling it &quot;beautiful&quot;. &quot;Everytime&quot; was also covered on the American series &quot;Glee&quot; episode &quot;Britney 2.0&quot; by the character Marley Rose (played by Melissa Benoist).

&quot;Everytime&quot; was also used in the 2013 American film &quot;Spring Breakers&quot;, directed by Harmony Korine.The scene begins with the characters of Candy (Vanessa Hudgens), Brittany (Ashley Benson) and Cotty (Rachel Korine) standing in the backyard of the character of Alien (James Franco), who sits at a white grand piano. The girls are wearing My Little Pony ski masks, sparkly pink tiger bathing suits, sweatpants with &quot;DTF&quot; on the rear and shotguns in their hands. They ask Alien to &quot;Play us something sweet. Something uplifting, Something fucking inspiring,&quot; to which he responds &quot;One of the greatest singers of all time, and an angel if there ever was one on this earth&quot;, before starting to sing &quot;Everytime&quot;. As the song transitions from Alien&#x27;s vocals to Spears&#x27;s original version we are shown a montage of the girls and Alien robbing other spring breakers at gunpoint. Harmony Korine said about the song,

&quot;I like her music! I think it’s like perfect pop music. That song &quot;Everytime&quot; — I was always taken by that song. It has this real kind of beauty and airlessness and this haunting kind of morose lullaby effect and underneath it there’s some type of hardcore aggression and menace that was really connected to the film in the way that the film deals with the culture of surfaces, this candy-coated neon haze reality. Underneath it, there’s this subtext and feeling of this kind of darkness. It was a connection I felt.&quot;

A Mandarin Chinese version of &quot;Everytime&quot;, titled &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Sorry&quot;, was recorded by Taiwanese girl group S.H.E for their 2004 studio album &quot;Encore&quot;. Jackie Evancho covered the song for her debut album, &quot;Prelude to a Dream&quot; (2009). On August 19, 2010, her version debuted at number three on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Classical Digital Songs chart. British singer Cher Lloyd covered the song live on &quot;The X Factor&quot; in the United Kingdom in 2010. This caused the song to reenter the top 50 singles chart in the UK. On July 27, 2012, Kelly Clarkson covered the song during the Las Vegas stop of her summer tour, as an audience request. Clarkson had a harpist accompany her during the performance, and told the audience, &quot;This song is one of my favourite songs. [...] I actually prefer [Spears&#x27;s] version better, because it just sounds really sad, but I&#x27;m going to try and do it.&quot; Spears approved of Clarkson&#x27;s cover via her Twitter account, calling it &quot;beautiful&quot;. On May 24, 2019, American singer Slayyyter released a cover as a digital single.

<text>Josef Allen Hynek (May 1, 1910 – April 27, 1986) was an American astronomer, professor, and ufologist. He is perhaps best remembered for his UFO research. Hynek acted as scientific advisor to UFO studies undertaken by the U.S. Air Force under three projects: Project Sign (1947–1949), Project Grudge (1949–1951) and Project Blue Book (1952–1969).

In later years, he conducted his own independent UFO research, developing the &quot;Close Encounter&quot; classification system. He was among the first people to conduct scientific analysis of reports and especially of trace evidence purportedly left by UFOs.

== Early life ==
Hynek was born in Chicago to Czech parents. In 1931, Hynek received a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Chicago. In 1935, he completed his PhD in astrophysics at Yerkes Observatory of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Chicago. His thesis advisors were Otto Struve and William Wilson Morgan. Hynek joined the Department of Physics and Astronomy at The Ohio State University in 1936.

He wrote with George Gamow on the origin of the solar system in 1945. He specialized in the study of stellar evolution and in the identification of spectroscopic binary stars.

==Career==
During World War II, Hynek was a civilian scientist at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory, where he helped to develop the United States Navy&#x27;s radio proximity fuze.

After the war, Hynek returned to the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Ohio State, rising to full professor in 1950. In 1953, Hynek submitted a report on the fluctuations in the brightness and color of starlight and daylight, with an emphasis on daytime observations.

In 1956, he left to join Professor Fred Whipple, the Harvard astronomer, at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, which had combined with the Harvard Observatory at Harvard. Hynek had the assignment of directing the tracking of an American space satellite, a project for the International Geophysical Year in 1956 and thereafter. In addition to over 200 teams of amateur scientists around the world that were part of Operation Moonwatch, there were also 12 photographic Baker-Nunn stations. A special camera was devised for the task and a prototype was built and tested and then stripped apart again when, on Oct. 4, 1957, the Soviet Union launched its first satellite, Sputnik 1.

After completing his work on the satellite program, Hynek went back to teaching, taking the position of professor and chairman of the astronomy department at Northwestern University in 1960 and worked there until his retirement in 1978.

==Evolution of opinion on UFOs==

===Skepticism===
In response to numerous reports of &quot;flying saucers&quot;, the United States Air Force established Project Sign in 1948 to examine sightings of unidentified flying objects. Hynek was contacted to act as a scientific consultant to Project Sign. He studied UFO reports and decided whether the phenomena described therein suggested known astronomical objects.

When Project Sign hired Hynek, he was skeptical of UFO reports. Hynek suspected that they were made by unreliable witnesses, or by persons who had misidentified man-made or natural objects. In 1948, Hynek said that &quot;the whole subject seems utterly ridiculous,&quot; and described it as a fad that would soon pass.

In his 1977 book, Hynek said that he enjoyed his role as a debunker for the Air Force. He also said that debunking was what the Air Force expected of him.

=== Change of opinion ===
In April 1953, Hynek wrote a report for the &quot;Journal of the Optical Society of America&quot; titled &quot;Unusual Aerial Phenomena,&quot; which contained one of his best-known statements:
Ridicule is not part of the scientific method, and people should not be taught that it is. The steady flow of reports, often made in concert by &quot;reliable&quot; observers, raises questions of scientific obligation and responsibility. Is there ... &quot;any&quot; residue that is worthy of scientific attention? Or, if there isn&#x27;t, does not an obligation exist to say so to the public—not in words of open ridicule but seriously, to keep faith with the trust the public places in science and scientists?

In 1953, Hynek was an associate member of the Robertson Panel, which concluded that there was nothing anomalous about UFOs, and that a public relations campaign should be undertaken to debunk the subject and reduce public interest. Hynek would later lament that the Robertson Panel had helped make UFOs a disreputable field of study.

As UFO reports continued to be made, some of the testimonies, especially by military pilots and police officers, were deeply puzzling to Hynek. He once said, &quot;As a scientist I must be mindful of the lessons of the past; all too often it has happened that matters of great value to science were overlooked because the new phenomenon did not fit the accepted scientific outlook of the time.&quot;

In a 1985 interview, when asked what caused his change of opinion, Hynek responded, &quot;Two things, really. One was the completely negative and unyielding attitude of the Air Force. They wouldn&#x27;t give UFOs the chance of existing, even if they were flying up and down the street in broad daylight. Everything had to have an explanation. I began to resent that, even though I basically felt the same way, because I still thought they weren&#x27;t going about it in the right way. You can&#x27;t assume that everything is black no matter what. Secondly, the caliber of the witnesses began to trouble me. Quite a few instances were reported by military pilots, for example, and I knew them to be fairly well-trained, so this is when I first began to think that, well, maybe there was something to all this.&quot;

Hynek remained with Project Sign after it became Project Grudge (though he was far less involved in Grudge than he had been in Sign). Project Grudge was replaced with Project Blue Book in early 1952, and Hynek remained as scientific consultant. Air Force Captain Edward J. Ruppelt, Blue Book&#x27;s first director, held Hynek in high regard: &quot;Dr. Hynek was one of the most impressive scientists I met while working on the UFO project, and I met a good many. He didn&#x27;t do two things that some of them did: give you the answer before he knew the question; or immediately begin to expound on his accomplishments in the field of science.&quot;

Though Hynek thought Ruppelt was a capable director who steered Project Blue Book in the right direction, Ruppelt headed Blue Book for only a few years. Hynek has also stated his opinion that after Ruppelt&#x27;s departure, Project Blue Book was little more than a public relations exercise, further noting that little or no research was undertaken using the scientific method.

=== Turnaround ===

Hynek began occasionally disagreeing publicly with the conclusions of Blue Book. By the early 1960s—after about a decade and a half of study—Clark writes that &quot;Hynek&#x27;s apparent turnaround on the UFO question was an open secret.&quot; Only after Blue Book was formally dissolved did Hynek speak more openly about his &quot;turnaround&quot;.

Hynek speculated that his personality was a factor in the Air Force keeping him on as a consultant for over two decades.

Some other ufologists thought that Hynek was being disingenuous or even duplicitous in his turnaround. Physicist James E. McDonald, for example, wrote to Hynek in 1970, castigating him for what McDonald saw as his lapses, and suggesting that, when evaluated by later generations, retired Marine Corps Major Donald E. Keyhoe would be regarded as a more objective, honest, and scientific ufologist.

It was during the late stages of Blue Book in the 1960s that Hynek began speaking openly about his disagreements and disappointments with the Air Force. Among the cases about which he openly dissented with the Air Force were the highly publicized Portage County UFO chase, in which several police officers chased a UFO for half an hour, and the encounter of Lonnie Zamora, a police officer who reported an encounter with a metallic, egg-shaped aircraft near Socorro, New Mexico. In 1964, Hynek appeared on the television program &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;.
In late March 1966 in Dexter, Michigan, two days of mass UFO sightings were reported, and received significant publicity. After studying the reports, Hynek offered a provisional hypothesis for some of the sightings: a few of about 100 witnesses had mistaken swamp gas for something more spectacular. At the press conference where he made his announcement, Hynek repeatedly and strenuously stated that swamp gas was a plausible explanation for only a portion of the Michigan UFO reports, and certainly not for UFO reports in general. But much to his chagrin, Hynek&#x27;s qualifications of his hypothesis were largely overlooked, and the term &quot;swamp gas&quot; was repeated ad infinitum in relation to UFO reports. The explanation was subject to national derision.

In his reply dated October 7, 1968, to a request for scientific recommendations regarding Blue Book from Colonel Raymond Sleeper, commander of the USAF Foreign Technology Division, Hynek noted that Blue Book suffered from numerous procedural problems and a lack of resources, which rendered its efforts &quot;totally inadequate&quot;. Hynek also noted that one wag had bestowed upon Blue Book the epithet of &quot;Society for the Explanation of the Uninvestigated&quot;.

== Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS) ==

Hynek was the founder and first head of the Center for UFO Studies (CUFOS). Founded in 1973 in Evanston, Illinois (but now based in Chicago), CUFOS advocates for scientific analysis of UFO cases. CUFOS&#x27;s extensive archives include valuable files from civilian research groups such as NICAP, one of the most popular UFO research groups of the 1950s and 1960s.

== Speech before the United Nations ==

In November 1978, Hynek presented a statement on UFOs before the United Nations General Assembly&#x27;s Special Political Committee on behalf of himself, Jacques Vallée, and Claude Poher. The speech was prepared and approved by the three authors. Their objective was to initiate a centralized, United Nations authority on UFOs.
== UFO origin hypotheses ==
At the MUFON annual symposium in 1973, held in Akron, Ohio, Hynek first expressed his doubts regarding the extraterrestrial (formerly &quot;interplanetary&quot; or &quot;intergalactic&quot;) hypothesis, in a speech titled &quot;The Embarrassment of the Riches&quot;. He was aware that the number of UFO sightings was much higher than was reflected in the Project Blue Book statistics. &quot;A few good sightings a year, over the world, would bolster the extraterrestrial hypothesis—but many thousands every year? From remote regions of space? And to what purpose? To scare us by stopping cars, and disturbing animals, and puzzling us with their seemingly pointless antics?&quot;

If not publicly, Hynek had been expressing his doubts about the extraterrestrial spacecraft hypothesis to his closest colleagues for years prior to that 1973 symposium. Jacques Vallee&#x27;s journal entry of August 2, 1967, recounts a conversation with Hynek over lunch that day during which, &quot;We turned to the subject of hypotheses. Hynek would like to write a set of axioms from which he would derive the whole study of UFOs. ... Third axiom: The physical plane is not the only level of existence. The hermeticists speak of an &#x27;astral plane.&#x27; The spiritists talk about materializations ... ghosts that go through walls. Who knows if UFOs are not observational devices that are materialized into our world by the denizens of another?&quot;

In a paper presented to the Joint Symposium of the American Institute of Aeronautics &amp; Astronautics in Los Angeles in 1975, he wrote, &quot;If you object, I ask you to explain—quantitatively, not qualitatively—the reported phenomena of materialization and dematerialization, of shape changes, of the noiseless hovering in the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field, accelerations that—for an appreciable mass—require energy sources far beyond present capabilities—even theoretical capabilities, the well-known and often reported E-M (electro-magnetic interference) effect, the psychic effects on percipients, including purported telepathic communications.&quot;

In 1977, at the First International UFO Congress in Chicago, Hynek presented his thoughts in his speech &quot;What I Really Believe About UFOs&quot;. &quot;I do believe&quot;, he said, &quot;that the UFO phenomenon as a whole is real, but I do not mean necessarily that it&#x27;s just one thing. We must ask whether the diversity of observed UFOs ... all spring from the same basic source, as do weather phenomena, which all originate in the atmosphere&quot;, or whether they differ &quot;as a rain shower differs from a meteor, which in turn differs from a cosmic-ray shower.&quot; We must not ask, Hynek said, simply which hypothesis can explain the most facts, but rather which hypothesis can explain the most puzzling facts.

Regarding hypotheses of extraterrestrial intelligence (ETI) and extradimensional intelligence (EDI), Hynek continued, &quot;There is sufficient evidence to defend both&quot;. As evidence for the ETI hypothesis, he mentioned the cases involving radar as good evidence of something solid, as well as the cases of physical evidence. Then he turned to defending the EDI hypothesis: in addition to the observations of materialization and dematerialization, he cited the &quot;poltergeist&quot; phenomenon experienced by some people after a close encounter; the photographs of UFOs, sometimes in only one frame, and not seen by witnesses; the changing of form in front of witnesses; the puzzling question of telepathic communication; that in close encounters of the third kind, the creatures seem to be at home in Earth&#x27;s gravity and atmosphere; the sudden stillness in the presence of the craft; levitation of cars or people; and the development by some of psychic abilities after an encounter. &quot;Do we have two aspects of one phenomenon or two different sets of phenomena?&quot; Hynek asked.

Finally, he introduced a third hypothesis. &quot;I hold it entirely possible&quot;, he said, &quot;that a technology exists, which encompasses both the physical and the psychic, the material and the mental. There are stars that are millions of years older than the sun. There may be a civilization that is millions of years more advanced than man&#x27;s. We have gone from Kitty Hawk to the moon in some seventy years, but it&#x27;s possible that a million-year-old civilization may know something that we don&#x27;t ... I hypothesize an &#x27;M&amp;M&#x27; technology encompassing the mental and material realms. The psychic realms, so mysterious to us today, may be an ordinary part of an advanced technology.&quot;

In Jacques Vallee&#x27;s Foreword to his 1992 collection of journal entries from 1957-1969, he writes that Hynek, looking far less than millions of years into the future, &quot;liked to remind us that beyond today&#x27;s science there would be a twenty-first century science that would have to take into account phenomena that seemed paranormal to us simply because of our parochial mental attitudes and the limitations of what he aptly called our cultural provincialism.&quot;

In Hynek and Vallee&#x27;s 1975 book &quot;The Edge of Reality&quot;, Hynek published a stereoscopic photograph of a UFO he took during a flight. According to the book, the object stayed in sight long enough for Hynek to unpack his camera from his luggage and take two exposures. UFO researcher Robert Sheaffer writes in his book &quot;Psychic Vibrations&quot; that Hynek seemed to have forgotten the photographs when he later told a reporter for &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; that he had never seen a UFO. The article states that in all the years he had been looking upward, Hynek &quot;has never seen &#x27;what I would so dearly love to see. Oh, the subject has been so ridiculed that I would never report a UFO even if I did see one—not without a witness&#x27;&quot;. Nevertheless, Hynek&#x27;s role in ufology took a heavy toll on his  professional reputation, as noted in a March 1968 journal entry in Vallee (1992): &quot;[Hynek&#x27;s] colleagues&#x27; attitude towards him is changing to the point of contempt. ... He is not taken seriously among astronomers [anymore]. ... At the recent ceremony for the tenth anniversary of &quot;Sputnik&quot; they could not avoid inviting him to speak, but [they] told him to be sure not to mention UFOs.&quot;

== Close encounter ==
In his first book, Hynek published the &quot;Close Encounter&quot; scale that he had developed to better catalog UFO reports. Hynek was later a consultant to Columbia Pictures and Steven Spielberg for the popular 1977 UFO movie &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;, named after a level of Hynek&#x27;s scale. He made a cameo appearance in the film. At the end of the film, after the abducted World War II fighter pilots disembark from the &quot;mother ship&quot;, he can be seen, bearded and with pipe in mouth, stepping forward to view the spectacle.

== Controversies and criticisms ==
Hynek&#x27;s most prolific public critic was acclaimed aerospace journalist and UFO researcher Philip J. Klass. In his book &quot;UFOs: The Public Deceived&quot;, the chapter on &quot;Eyewitness Unreliability&quot; begins (p. 81) with criticism of Hynek&#x27;s insistence &quot;for many years that no useful insights could be gained from the study of UFO reports that proved to be IFOs&quot; (i.e., subsequently identified), as Hynek reiterated to a congressional committee in 1968: &quot;These have little scientific value ... ; it matters not whether 100 or 100,000 people fail to identify [for example] an artificial satellite or a high–altitude balloon.&quot; Rather, argues Klass, &quot;UFO reports that prove to be IFOs show that intelligent people, including pilots, scientists, and law–enforcement officers, unwittingly embellish their accounts with inaccurate details and seeming cause–effects that are really unrelated. It follows logically that similar inaccuracies in other UFO reports may prevent their explanations.&quot; In a later chapter (p. 287), he illustrates how &quot;when Hynek speaks to those inclined to believe in UFOs and other paranormal claims, he is much more candid&quot; about his mystical worldview. He quotes Hynek as telling the Spiritual Frontiers Fellowship, &quot;I can feel freer [here] to discuss the more esoteric aspects of the subject of UFOs. ... You have an awareness of the possibilities that the solely materialistically oriented person, like scientists in general, do not have. Talking to them about certain subjects would be like trying to explain calculus to a kindergarten student.&quot; Klass then (pp. 287–288) cites the Center for UFO Studies&#x27; failure to fulfill Hynek&#x27;s expectation of promptly and scientifically establishing UFO reality. From Hynek&#x27;s article, &quot;The UFO Gap,&quot; in the December 1967 issue of &quot;Playboy&quot;: &quot;If UFOs ... actually exist, we would have photographs, movies, spectrograms, plaster casts of indentations (if a landing occurs) and detailed measurements ... of brightness, speeds, and so on within a year of the initiation of such a no–nonsense program. ... [But if not] this, in itself, would be of great negative significance.&quot; Klass concludes, &quot;Nearly a decade has now passed since CUFOS was created. ... Today all that CUFOS has to show for this effort are several thousand additional [similar] reports ... plus a growing number of bizarre tales of &#x27;occupants&#x27; and &#x27;abductions.&#x27; ... &quot;Thus, this decade of CUFOS effort has provided what Hynek in 1967 called evidence of &#x27;great negative significance,&#x27; that is, that there is no mysterious UFO phenomenon&quot;&quot; (emphasis in original).

Robert Sheaffer, a Klass protégé who studied astronomy under (and somewhat befriended) Prof. Hynek at Northwestern University, accuses Hynek of gullibility on his &quot;Bad UFOs&quot; blog as well as in his 1998 book &quot;UFO Sightings: The Evidence&quot; and additional writings&quot;.&quot; While still a student in 1970, Sheaffer was afforded the opportunity to preview a chapter in Hynek&#x27;s first book–in–progress, and their back–and–forth (along with an appraisal by Philip Klass of that correspondence) is among the material posted in the &quot;Historical Documents&quot; section of Sheaffer&#x27;s UFO–related website, as is Sheaffer&#x27;s commentary on Hynek&#x27;s April 1969 Northwestern freshman orientation lecture on UFOs. Sheaffer&#x27;s review of the &quot;Proceedings of the 1976 CUFOS Conference&quot; includes, &quot;Having swallowed [one particular presenter&#x27;s] tales with no apparent difficulty, [Hynek&#x27;s CUFOS is] about ready for sightings of the Tooth Fairy. ... Papers that are generally skeptical about UFOs, or even those that shoot down faulty UFO cases, are &quot;not&quot; represented here&quot; (emphasis in original). His review of Hynek and Vallee&#x27;s &quot;Edge of Reality&quot; (&quot;... the authors have gleefully swallowed a dismally high number of UFO hoaxes ...”) was followed by replies from both authors and by Sheaffer&#x27;s response in which he thanks Hynek for &quot;a reply that nicely illustrates all of my principal criticisms of his book,&quot; including &quot;reckless errors of fact,&quot; adding that Hynek&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;scientific&#x27; UFO Center operates on the principle that &#x27;responsible criticism does not exist.&#x27;&quot; In &quot;UFO Sightings: The Evidence&quot;, Sheaffer further concludes that ufology, as practiced by Hynek (and others), is &quot;a powerful social movement [that is] &quot;fundamentally a reaction against science and reason&quot;&quot; (emphasis in original).

Andrew Fraknoi, Executive Director of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific from 1978 to 1992, in a 1981 letter to Science Digest—speaking strictly for himself and not ASP—declined the magazine&#x27;s invitation to offer a nomination for its Cutty Sark Science Award. An excerpt: &quot;While I think such an award is an excellent idea, I have chosen not to participate in the process because of your inclusion of Dr. Allen Hynek on your panel of judges. I feel it demeans the entire process ... to have as one of the judges a man who has been one of the loudest and [most] exploitative exponents of pseudo–science in this country&quot; (emphasis in original).
Researcher Curt Collins, in a comprehensive weblog titled &quot;Dr. Hynek and the UFO Photo Investigation of 1967,&quot; chronicles Hynek&#x27;s role as an &quot;[unwitting] secondary dupe&quot; in fanning the flames of what would become an indelible UFO–photo case—thanks in large part to the Associated Press and the CBS Evening News with Walter Cronkite—involving several Polaroid instant photographs of a &quot;hamburger&quot;–shaped object taken on January 9, 1967, by the two lone &quot;witnesses,&quot; Michigan teenage brothers Dan and Grant Jaroslaw. Hynek was unfortunately denied the original prints by the family, and it would be nine years before a letter of confession from the brothers would ultimately convince him of their hoax. His premature endorsements (though hedged) led to newspaper headlines across the country such as &quot;Expert Sees &#x27;No Hoax&#x27; in Boys&#x27; UFO Photos&quot; and &quot;Saucers In Photo Real? UFO Expert Says &#x27;Yes.&#x27;&quot; [Apparently unbeknownst to Hynek at the time—despite an article widely disseminated by the Associated Press nearly a week prior to his initial endorsements—a local newspaper reporter, being shown the original prints within hours of the incident and observing Polaroid&#x27;s sequential serial numbers on the reverse sides, noted that the photographs&#x27; sequencing was incompatible with the brothers&#x27; chronology of events.]

Author John Franch, in an article titled &quot;The Secret Life of J. Allen Hynek,&quot; disputes the &quot;legend&quot; that &quot;Hynek was a [scientifically oriented] skeptic before becoming an outspoken UFOlogist.&quot; He notes that &quot;Since his teens Hynek had been an enthusiastic though closeted student of the occult&quot; with &quot;a particular fondness for the writings of the Rosicrucian secret societies, with their tantalizing promises of hidden ancient knowledge, and those of the so–called hermetic philosophers, especially Rudolf Steiner,&quot; and &quot;even endorsed alleged instances of &#x27;psychic surgery&#x27; and &#x27;psychic photography.&#x27;&quot; For these and other reasons, Franch asserts that Hynek&#x27;s initial &quot;skeptical attitude&quot; toward UFO reality &quot;was in fact a façade for public consumption.&quot;
==Personal life==
Hynek and his second wife, Miriam Curtis Hynek, had five children. Hynek&#x27;s son Joel Hynek is an Oscar-winning visual effects supervisor. He oversaw the design of the camouflage effect for the movie &quot;Predator&quot;, and won the Best Visual Effects Oscar for his work on &quot;What Dreams May Come&quot;. Hynek&#x27;s youngest son Paul Hynek is an astronomer working for the United States Air Force.

==DocuSeries based on his life==
In 2019, The History Channel created and aired a highly-fictionalized TV show based on his UFO research and the organization he worked for dubbed &quot;Project Blue Book&quot;.

== Death ==
On April 27, 1986, Hynek died of a malignant brain tumor, at Memorial Hospital in Scottsdale, Arizona. He was 75 years old.

<text>Martín Jaite (born 9 October 1964) is a former top-10 professional tennis player from Argentina.

Jaite&#x27;s career-high Association of Tennis Professionals singles ranking was world no. 10, which he achieved in the summer of 1990, and he won a total of 12 titles and $1,873,881 in tour prize money during his career.

Jaite&#x27;s playing style leveraged his consistency, speed, thoughtful use of tactics, and fitness to compensate for his lack of power.

==Early life==
Jaite was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, and is Jewish.

==Tennis career==
Jaite was a top junior in both Spain and Argentina. He joined Argentina&#x27;s Davis Cup team. He began playing on the ATP tour in 1983, and soon was ranked among the top 20 players in the world. He reached the quarterfinals in competition at the French Open in 1985, defeating Paolo Canè, Trevor Allan, Miloslav Mečíř and Heinz Günthardt before losing to Ivan Lendl. In May 1986 at Forest Hills Jaite defeated world No. 4 Boris Becker in straight sets.

In May 1987, Jaite beat world no. 9 Henri Leconte in Germany in two tiebreaks. In September 1987, Jaite upset world no. 3 Mats Wilander in five sets to win a competition in Barcelona, Spain. In April 1989, he upset world no. 8 Jakob Hlasek in two sets in Monte Carlo.

Jaite became only the sixth South American to be ranked in the top 10 in the ATP computer rankings, reaching no. 10 in 1990. In May 1990, he defeated world No. 2 Stefan Edberg in three sets in Germany. Jaite defeated world No. 4 Guy Forget in April 1991 in France, and then again in July, in Gstaad, Switzerland.

===Olympics===
He participated for his native country at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, but lost to Brad Gilbert, the eventual winner of the bronze medal.

===Davis Cup===
Jaite was 14–20 in Davis Cup play, 11–7 in singles on clay, from 1984 to 1999.

Jaite was involved in a Davis Cup tie against the US in Buenos Aires when Andre Agassi was leading 6–2, 6–2, 5–0. Jaite was leading 40–0 in the sixth game of the third set, and missed his first serve. Agassi then called out to his then-coach Nick Bollettieri, &quot;Hey watch this!&quot;, and then followed by catching the second serve in his left hand to give Jaite the game. Viewed as an act of disrespect, Agassi was booed by the crowd for five minutes.

===After tennis===
Jaite has had an important role in Argentine tennis since his retirement. He is the tournament director for ATP Buenos Aires, the Buenos Aires Challenger, and director of Futures events in Argentina. From July 2007 till December 2008, Jaite was coaching David Nalbandian, and helped lead him to titles in Madrid and Bercy, where he became the first man to defeat the top two players in the world, Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal, in consecutive tournaments. In 2011, Jaite was named captain of the Argentina Davis Cup team.

== Career finals==
===Singles: 19 (12 wins – 7 losses)===

===Doubles: 2 (1 win – 1 loss)===

<text>George Warren Rickey (June 6, 1907 – July 17, 2002) was an American kinetic sculptor known for geometric abstractions, often large-scale, engineered to move in response to air currents.

==Early life and education==
Rickey was born on June 6, 1907, in South Bend, Indiana. When Rickey was still a child, his father, an engineer with Singer Sewing Machine Company, moved the family to Glasgow, Scotland, in 1913. 
Growing up with a father who was an engineer and a grandfather who was a clockmaker instilled in the young Rickey an interest in mechanical systems and anything needing winding or cranking, from the family car to the phonograph. Additionally, the Rickeys lived near the river Clyde, and George learned to sail around the outer islands on the family&#x27;s sailboat. As did his youthful interest in engineering, Rickey’s familiarity with boat movements from an early age would inform the signature kinectic sculpture he began developing in the 1950s. 

Rickey was educated at Glenalmond College and received a degree in history from Balliol College, Oxford, with frequent visits to the Ruskin School of Drawing. He spent a short time traveling Europe and, against the advice of his father, studied art in Paris at Académie L&#x27;Hote and Académie Moderne. He then returned to the United States and began teaching at the Groton School, where among his many students was future National Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy.

After leaving Groton, Rickey taught at various schools throughout the country as part of the Carnegie Corporation Visiting Artists/Artists in Residence program (partially funded by the Works Progress Administration). His focus was primarily on painting and he began to reject European modernism in favor of American social realism. While taking part in these programs, he painted portraits, taught classes, and created a set of murals at Olivet College and Knox College, Galesburg, Illinois. He recruited student assistants to help with the murals. Meanwhile, he maintained an art studio in New York from 1934 to 1942, when he was drafted.

Rickey&#x27;s interest in things mechanical re-awakened during his wartime work in aircraft and gunnery systems research and maintenance. Following his discharge, he studied art at the New York University Institute of Fine Arts and later at the Chicago Institute of Design, funded by the G.I. Bill. He taught art at variety of colleges, including Muhlenberg College. While at Muhlenberg, he was commissioned by J. I. Rodale to illustrate an edition of Anton Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar and Other Tales&quot;. Rickey later moved on to Indiana University South Bend. There, he encountered and was inspired by the work of David Smith.

==Kinetic sculpture==
Rickey turned from painting to creating kinetic sculpture. Rickey combined his love of engineering and mechanics by designing sculptures whose metal parts moved in response to the slightest air currents.

His first sculpture was shown in New York in 1951 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art group show &quot;American Sculpture 1951&quot;. The Museum of Modern Art, in New York purchased his &quot;Two Lines Temporal I&quot;, after Alfred Barr, MOMA&#x27;s then director, had seen it at the exhibition &quot;Documenta III&quot; in Kassel, Germany.

Rickey&#x27;s sculptures can now be seen in major museums in the US and in most European capitals, Japan, and New Zealand. His work is often compared to the mobiles of Alexander Calder, but while Calder used organic, playful forms, Rickey&#x27;s European lineage is more closely related to the Constructivist principles of geometric engineering. In 1967, he wrote &quot;Constructivism – origins and evolution&quot;, published by George Braziller, Inc., New York.


In works such as &quot;Two Open Triangles Up Gyratory&quot;, Rickey&#x27;s two wind driven elements (engineered to withstand winds of ) provide an endless series of combined, almost dance like, shapes and movements.

Rickey mastered not only ordered predictable movements, but also mastered methods of controlling both the speed and tempo of similar objects to respond more randomly, such as in his work &quot;Four Open Rectangles Diagonal Jointed Gyratory V&quot;.

Much of his work was created in his studio in East Chatham, New York, where he moved after taking a position as a professor of art (sculpture) at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York. His kinetic sculpture titled &quot;Two Rectangles, Vertical Gyratory Up, Variation III&quot; was a central element of the Rensselaer campus from 1972. It is now located in Zurich, Switzerland, at the headquarters of UBS. This sculpture was known as the Chrinitoid when it was located on the Rensselaer campus on long term loan. It was removed after Rickey and Rensselaer could not agree on a purchase price.

Rickey also lived and worked in Berlin for many years, following the &quot;Documenta III&quot; art show. His studio time was spent constructing sculpture and preparing for exhibitions in Europe. In Rickey&#x27;s words the city was like a &quot;cocoon&quot; in the middle of communist East Germany, with a lively and advanced social and cultural life which he partook in fully. During this time he received numerous Honorary Doctor of Fine Arts degrees.

In 1979 he had a retrospective at the Guggenheim Museum in New York City. Rickey&#x27;s sculptures are on permanent exhibition at the National Gallery of Art, and the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington, D.C., the Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller Empire State Plaza Art Collection in Albany, New York, the San Diego Museum of Art, The Delaware Art Museum, The Indiana University Art Museum, the Honolulu Museum of Art, Frederik Meijer Gardens &amp; Sculpture Park, and at the Laumeier Sculpture Park in St. Louis, The Hyde Collection in Glens Falls, NY, and many other institutions.

In 1985, George Rickey had a major retrospective in South Bend, Indiana, the place of his birth. His sculptures were installed outside (and inside) of the South Bend Art Center, and also at the Snite Museum of Art on the campus of the University of Notre Dame. Rickey gave a presentation of his work at the Snite. One of the stories he told concerned how, as a result of a World War II-era, government-administered aptitude test, he was assigned to design machine gun turrets for bombers. It was in this job that he became familiar with the high-quality ball bearings, balancing weights, riveted sheet metal, lightweight aircraft construction techniques, and modern hardware (and the vendors for same) that were to become the mechanical foundation for his later forays into lightweight, delicately balanced, wind-activated kinetic sculpture.

Rickey died at his home in Saint Paul, Minnesota, on July 17, 2002, at the age of 95. The Rickey Estate is currently represented by Kasmin Gallery in New York City. The Rickey archive will have a permanent home at Notre Dame.

<text>History of Russia (1721–96) is the history of Russia during the Era of Russian palace revolutions and the Age of Catherine the Great. It began with creation of Russian Empire in 1721, the rule of Catherine I in 1725, and ended with the short rule of Peter III of Russia.

==Era of Russian palace revolutions (thematically)==

Peter changed the rules of succession to the throne after the death of his son Aleksey, who had opposed his father&#x27;s reforms and served as a rallying figure for anti-reform groups. A new law provided that the Tsar would choose his own successor, but Peter failed to do so before his death in 1725. In the decades that followed, the absence of clear rules of succession left the monarchy open to intrigues, plots, coups, and countercoups. Henceforth, the crucial factor for obtaining the throne was the support of the elite palace guard in St. Petersburg.

After Peter&#x27;s death, his wife Catherine I ascended the throne. But when she died in 1727, Peter&#x27;s grandson, Peter II, was crowned tsar. In 1730, Anna Ivanovna, whose father Ivan V had been co-ruler with Peter, ascended the throne. The Supreme Privy Council, a government body established by Catherine I that put Anna on the throne, attempted to impose various conditions on her. In her struggle against those restrictions, Anna had the support of other nobles who feared oligarchic rule more than autocracy. Thus the principle of autocracy continued to receive strong support despite chaotic struggles for the throne.

Anna died in 1740, and her infant grandnephew was proclaimed tsar as Ivan VI. After a series of coups, however, he was replaced by Peter the Great&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth (r. 1741-1762). During Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, which was much more effective than those of her immediate predecessors, a modernised Russian culture began to emerge. Among notable cultural events were the founding of Moscow University (1755) and the Academy of Fine Arts (1757), along with the emergence of Russia&#x27;s first eminent scientist and scholar, Mikhail Lomonosov.

During the rule of Peter&#x27;s successors, Russia took a more active role in European events. From 1726 to 1761, Russia was allied with Austria against the Ottoman Empire and Crimean Khanate, which France usually supported. In the War of Polish Succession (1733–1735), Russia and Austria blocked the French candidate to the Polish throne. In the Russo-Turkish War of 1735-1739, Russia reacquired the port of Azov, but Russia&#x27;s greatest reach into Europe was during the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), which was fought on three continents between Great Britain and France with numerous allies on both sides. In that war, Russia continued its alliance with Austria, but Austria shifted to an alliance with France against Prussia. In 1760, Russian forces were at the gates of Berlin. Fortunately for the Kingdom of Prussia, Elizabeth died in 1762, and her successor, Peter III, allied Russia with Prussia because of his devotion to the Prussian king, Frederick the Great.
Peter III had a short and unpopular reign. His father was Charles Frederick, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp. In his Manifesto on the Freedom of the Nobility, Peter III granted civil liberties to the nobility and ended mandatory state service for nobles. While his manifesto was popular, he alienated clergy by decision to pass church lands to the state and created deep resentment by forcing Prussian military drills on the Russian army, and depriving Russia of a military victory by establishing his sudden alliance with Prussia. Making use of the discontent and fearing for her own position, Peter III&#x27;s wife, Catherine, deposed her husband in a coup, and her lover&#x27;s brother, Aleksey Orlov, subsequently murdered him, so in June 1762 Catherine became Catherine II, empress of Russia.

==Era of Russian palace revolutions (chronologically)==

===Catherine I, ruled 1725–1727===

Peter the Great had two wives, Yevdokiya Lopukhina (the daughter of a minor noble) and Marfa Skavronskaya (a Lithuanian peasant, renamed Catherine after her conversion to Orthodoxy). Catherine I&#x27;s rise through Peter I&#x27;s Table of Ranks, from a simple peasant to empress, embodied the Petrine spirit, making it seem as though Peter I literally “created” her. With the help of Aleksandr Menshikov (her advisor, ex-lover and leader of the palace guards), she gained the throne by emphasizing this connection to Peter I and her maternal nature. Due to her poor health, Menshikov did much of the ruling. With Catherine I&#x27;s blessing, he created the Supreme Privy Council, which consisted of six or so members. It ultimately took over most of the functions of the Ruling Senate (an advisory body founded by Peter I to oversee judicial, financial and administrative affairs) Almost immediately, Catherine I appointed Peter II, the grandson of Peter the Great, as her successor and she died after only two years of ruling.

===Peter II, ruled 1727–1730===

Peter II was only eleven when he became emperor. Because Peter was so young his advisers manipulated him throughout his reign. Intent on maintaining his power, Menshikov took the young boy under his wing, banishing his competitors, including both Petar Zaitsev and Emil Vasilcin (who were related to Peter I), to Siberia and, ultimately, betrothing Peter II to his daughter Maria Menshikova. However, when Menshikov fell ill and had to leave court, Andrei Osterman and Alexis Dolgoruky ingratiated themselves with the young emperor and replacing Menshikov as Peter II&#x27;s premier advisers. Both were nobles and members of the Supreme Privy Council and eventually had Menshikov tried and banished to Siberia on “a charge of ‘tyranny’”. Peter became, once again, engaged to a daughter of one of the Supreme Privy Council’s members (this time it was Dolgoruky’s daughter, Catherine). However, before the wedding took place, Peter died of smallpox without naming a successor, throwing the empire into another succession struggle.

===Anna of Russia, ruled 1730–1740===

When Peter II died, there were multiple candidates for the throne, including Peter I’s first wife, Yevdokiya, and his daughter, Elizabeth. However, Alexis Dolgoruky and his allies chose Anna Ivanonva, the daughter of Peter I’s half brother Ivan, because the Supreme Privy Council wanted a ruler who would not impose on the powers of the Council, allowing them to continue to virtually rule the empire. The Supreme Privy Council offered her the throne with “Konditsii” or Conditions. These included the inability of the empress to marry, designate a successor, declare war or peace, raise taxes, or spend state revenue without the consent of the Council. Many other nobles saw this as an aristocratic grab for power and told the would-be empress so as soon as she arrived in Moscow. Ultimately, Anna invalidated the conditions, abolished the Council, and sent many members who had advocated the conditions into exile. During her reign, Anna relied heavily on Ernst Johann von Biron (her longtime adviser and lover), making many refer to her reign as “Bironovshchina” (Biron&#x27;s repressive regime). Together, they repealed Peter I&#x27;s legislation which prohibited nobles dividing up their estates among their sons while similarly reducing the nobility&#x27;s state service requirements. Many regard her reign as a time of foreign domination, particularly German, in the court. However, this mainly stems from the fact that a few Germans had high ranking positions. During her reign, Anna remained involved in external conflicts. In 1732, her government was forced to cede back all territories annexed several years earlier by Peter I in the North and South Caucasus to Persia, now led by Nader Shah, in order to forge a Russo-Persian alliance against the common enemy, the Ottoman Empire. From 1733–1736, Russia was allied with Austria against France and Spain in the War of Polish Succession. Russia and Austria joined to stop the election of a French candidate for the Polish throne, allowing Austria&#x27;s favored candidate to win. Later, allied with Austria, Russia went to war with the Ottoman Empire in the hopes of gaining new territory. This war, lasting 1735-1739 “secured the restoration of Azov to Russia and some lands between Azov and the Dniester” but at high casualty rates, mainly due to disease. Anna Ivanonva named the young son of Anna Leopoldovna and the Duke of Brunswick, Ivan VI, as her successor and Biron as his regent.

===Ivan VI, ruled 1740–1741===

Anna Leopoldovna argued with Biron and replaced him as the babe&#x27;s regent. A cabinet composed of both Russians and Germans advised Anna Leopoldovna. However, this regime lasted only a year due to its ineffective leadership. Peter I&#x27;s last surviving daughter, Elizabeth, long on the sidelines, sensed this as her moment to obtain power and led a coup against Anna Leopoldovna and Ivan VI, imprisoning or banishing all who stood in her way.

===Elizabeth of Russia, ruled 1741–1762===

As the last surviving child of Peter I, Elizabeth&#x27;s reign had a certain legitimacy and the people of the empire greeted her ascension as the end of German dominated rule. She was more interested in politics than any of her predecessors were, although she lacked much of her father&#x27;s force and drive in the political sphere. She was impatient and unpredictable, unwilling to rely too heavily on one adviser.

Her administration continued much of Peter I&#x27;s legacy. She restored the Senate&#x27;s powers, abolished most domestic custom barriers, and founded the University of Moscow in 1755. During her reign, she ordered the building of some of the most famous structures, including the Winter Palace, although it was not completed until Catherine the Great. However, Elizabeth remained intent on keeping the nobility satisfied. During Elizabeth&#x27;s reign, the nobility&#x27;s control over the daily life of serfs increased: the landlord controlled who the serfs could marry. Indeed, the Senate passed legislation which allowed nobles to exile their serfs to Siberia. Despite the worsening life for the serfs, the majority of the population still saw Elizabeth as a benevolent ruler, when compared to the German brutes who dominated the court during Anna Ivanonva&#x27;s and Ivan VI&#x27;s reigns. Elizabeth remained very interested in diplomacy and Russia&#x27;s foreign affairs. Under her rule, Russia took part in the Seven Years&#x27; War from 1755 to 1762. Russia entered the war as an ally of Austria and France against Prussia. The campaign advanced successfully but ended as a result of mounting financial difficulties and Elizabeth&#x27;s death in 1762. Her nephew and successor, Peter III (grandson of Peter I), took Russia out of the war.

===Peter III, ruled for six months in 1762===

Peter III reigned for a mere six months before his wife, Catherine II, led a coup against him. He was born and raised in Germany in the court of his father, the Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and did not come to live in Russia until he was fourteen. It is difficult to ascertain his character because there exist many contradictory accounts. Catherine&#x27;s journals describe him as incompetent bordering on mentally challenged, yet his acts as emperor illustrate a certain amount of shrewdness. Peter withdrew Russia from the Seven Years&#x27; War to salvage the remainder of the empire&#x27;s finances and to save his beloved Prussia from complete defeat while depriving Russia of territorial advances. Instead, he threatened war with Denmark over his ancestral claims in Schleswig, though he was overthrown before fighting could begin. His “Manifesto on the Freedom of the Nobility” ended compulsory state service for the nobility. However, during his short reign Peter managed to irritate the nobility by dramatically decreasing the power of the Senate. He similarly angered the Church by his liberation of serfs on church land and his obvious contempt for Russian Orthodoxy.

Peter&#x27;s passion for Prussian style military ultimately terminated his reign. His delight for rigid discipline alienated the palace guards, and ultimately allowed Catherine II, with the help of her lover Grigori Orlov who led the palace guard regiments, to overthrow Peter III on July 9, 1762. Peter&#x27;s assassination symbolically showed the end of the era of palace revolutions.

==Age of Catherine the Great==

Catherine the Great&#x27;s reign featured imperial expansion, which brought the empire huge new territories in the south and west, and internal consolidation. She resolved her husband&#x27;s conflict with Denmark by exchanging his claims in Schleswig-Holstein for control of the Duchy of Oldenburg and an alliance that tied Denmark&#x27;s foreign policy to Russia&#x27;s through the Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo. A new Russo-Turkish War in 1768 ended with the Treaty of Kuchuk-Kainarji in 1774, by which Russia acquired the regions of Kerch, Yinsdale, and parts of the Yedisan region, became the formal protector of Orthodox Christians in the Ottoman Empire, and assumed military protectorship of the Crimean Khanate, which became nominally independent from the Ottoman Empire. In 1783, Catherine annexed Crimea, helping to spark the next War with the Ottoman Empire, which began in 1787. By the Treaty of Jassy in 1792, Russia expanded southward to the Dniestr river, annexing most of Yedisan. The terms of the treaty fell far short of the goals of Catherine&#x27;s reputed &quot;Greek project&quot; - the expulsion of the Ottomans from south-eastern Europe and the renewal of a Byzantine Empire under Russian control. The Ottoman Empire no longer posed a serious threat to Russia, however, and had to tolerate an increasing Russian influence over the Balkans.

Russia&#x27;s westward expansion under Catherine resulted from the partitioning of Poland. As Poland became increasingly weak in the eighteenth century, each of its neighbors (Russia, Prussia, and Austria) tried to place its own candidate on the Polish throne. In 1772, the three agreed on an initial partition of Polish territory, by which Russia received parts of Belarus and Livonia. After the partition, Poland initiated an extensive reform program, which included a democratic constitution that alarmed reactionary factions in Poland and in Russia. Using the danger of radicalism as an excuse, the same three powers abrogated the constitution and in 1793 again stripped Poland of territory. This time Russia obtained most of Belarus and Ukraine west of the Dnieper river. The 1793 partition led to the Kościuszko Uprising in Poland, which ended with the third partition in 1795. As a result, Poland disappeared from the international political map. Russia acquired territories in Lithuania and Courland in the third partition.

Although the partitioning of Poland greatly added to Russia&#x27;s territory and prestige, it also created new difficulties. Having lost Poland as a buffer, Russia now had to share borders with both Prussia and Austria. In addition, the empire became more ethnically heterogeneous as it absorbed large numbers of Poles, Ukrainians, Belarusians, Lithuanians, and Jews. The fate of the Ukrainians and Belarusians, who primarily worked as serfs, changed little at first under Russian rule. Roman Catholic Poles resented their loss of independence, however, and proved difficult to control, staging several uprisings against the occupation. Russia had barred Jews from the empire in 1742 and viewed them as an alien population. A decree of January 3, 1792, formally initiated the Pale of Settlement, which permitted Jews to live only in the western part of the empire, thereby setting the stage for anti-Jewish discrimination in later periods. At the same time, Russia abolished the autonomy of Ukraine east of the Dnieper, the Baltic provinces, and various Cossack territories. With her emphasis on a uniformly administered empire, Catherine presaged the policy of Russification that later tsars and their successors would practice.

Historians have debated Catherine&#x27;s sincerity as an enlightened monarch, but few have doubted that she believed in government activism aimed at developing the empire&#x27;s resources, creating an educated elite, and reforming administration. Initially, Catherine attempted to rationalize government procedures through law. In 1767, she created the Legislative Commission, drawn from nobles, townsmen, and others, to codify Russia&#x27;s laws. Although the commission did not formulate a new law code, Catherine&#x27;s &quot;Instruction to the Commission&quot; introduced modern legal principles. It would also form the basis for Catherine&#x27;s later legal codes, including the Statue of Administration of the Provinces (1775), the Salt Trade Code and the Code of Commercial Navigation (1781), the Police Ordnance (1782), and the Statue of Education (1786).

During the 1768-1774 war with the Ottoman Empire, Russia experienced a major social upheaval, the Pugachev Uprising. In 1773, a Don Cossack, Emel&#x27;yan Pugachev, declared himself as the re-emergent tsar Peter III. Other Cossacks, various Turkic tribes that felt the impingement of the Russian centralizing state, and industrial workers in the Ural Mountains, as well as peasants hoping to escape serfdom, all joined in the rebellion. Russia&#x27;s preoccupation with the war enabled Pugachev to take control of a part of the Volga area, but the regular army crushed the rebellion in 1774.

The Pugachev Uprising bolstered Catherine&#x27;s determination to reorganize Russia&#x27;s provincial administration. In 1775, she divided Russia into provinces and districts according to population statistics. She then gave each province an expanded administrative, police, and judicial apparatus. Nobles no longer had to serve the central government, as the law had required since Peter the Great&#x27;s time, and many of them received significant roles in administering provincial governments. 

Catherine also attempted to organize society into well-defined social groups, or estates. In 1785, she issued charters to nobles and townsmen. The Charter to the Nobility confirmed the liberation of the nobles from compulsory service and gave them personal rights that not even the autocracy could infringe. The Charter to the Towns that established self-government of the towns proved complicated and ultimately less successful than the one issued to the nobles.

The modernization of Russia continued during Catherine&#x27;s reign. An increase in the number of books and periodicals also brought forth intellectual debates and social criticism of the Russian Enlightenment. In 1790, Aleksandr Nikolaevich Radishchev published his &quot;Journey from St. Petersburg to Moscow&quot;, a fierce attack on serfdom and on the autocracy. Catherine, already frightened by the French Revolution, had Radishchev arrested and banished to Siberia. Radishchev later gained recognition as the father of Russian radicalism. In accordance with the treaty Russia had signed with the Georgians to protect them against any new invasion of their Persian suzerains and further political aspirations, Catherine waged a new war against Persia in 1796 after they had again invaded Georgia and established rule over it about a year prior and expelled the newly established Russian garrisons in the Caucasus.

Catherine brought many of the policies of Peter the Great to fruition and set the foundation for the 19th century empire. Russia became a power capable of competing with its European neighbors in the military, political, and diplomatic spheres. Russia&#x27;s elite became culturally more like the elites of Central and West European countries. The organization of society and the government system, from Peter the Great&#x27;s central institutions to Catherine&#x27;s provincial administration, remained basically unchanged until the emancipation of the serfs in 1861 and, in some respects, until the fall of the monarchy in 1917. Catherine&#x27;s push to the south, including the establishment of Odesa as a Russian port on the Black Sea, provided the basis for Russia&#x27;s nineteenth-century grain trade.

During the early nineteenth century, Russia&#x27;s population, resources, international diplomacy, and military forces made it one of the most powerful states in the world. Its power enabled it to play an increasingly assertive role in Europe&#x27;s affairs. This role drew the empire into a series of wars against Napoleon, which had far-reaching consequences for Russia and the rest of Europe.

Internally, Russia&#x27;s population had grown more diverse with each territorial acquisition. The population included Lutheran Finns, Baltic Germans, Estonians, and some Latvians; Roman Catholic Lithuanians, Poles, and some Latvians; Orthodox and Uniate Belarusians and Ukrainians; Muslim peoples along the empire&#x27;s southern border and in the East; Orthodox Greeks and Georgians; and members of the Armenian Apostolic Church.

==Daily life during Catherine the Great’s reign==
Daily life in Catherine the Great&#x27;s Russia was highly stratified, with huge divisions existing between the nobles and the peasantry. Few qualities bind the classes together besides the climate, and different social castes experienced the Russian lifestyle in vastly dissimilar ways.

===Nobles===
Despite popular perception, a small estate owner often led a boring and primitive life. The owner had few pursuits to distract him besides maintaining relationships with neighbors, religious and family obligations, and hunting, all of which made for a dull existence in the interim. Palaces did not feature privies during Catherine&#x27;s time, greatly inconveniencing the inhabitants of these abodes.

However, the most fortunate nobles enjoyed lifestyles of great luxury and refinement. They often had elaborate palaces staffed by squadrons of servants, and many of these majestic homes still stand in St. Petersburg today. The government often dictated minor details of life for the nobles; the table of ranks set up during the era of Peter the Great determined the number of horses and the type of carriage a person could use—a first rank man could have six horses and a carriage while a merchant could only have one horse and a coach. Catherine also mandated clothing styles such as the colors of threads and fabrics allotted only to a specific social class—nobles alone could wear gold and silver thread, for example. The wealthy and well educated garnered vast libraries, demonstrating their great opulence and worldliness.

Nobles often navigated around or influenced the legal system to suit themselves. A noble had the advantageous privilege of the freedom not to serve in the military, and in the event that he did choose to serve, he was given special treatment when being considered for higher positions. The government told army colonels to give young nobles preference over non-nobles when promoting soldiers to higher ranks, regardless of the quality of the man in question, though several members of the highest class went further, contending that commoners should not even be allowed to become officers. The upper class also believed—and often proposed—that they should be exempt from corporal and capital punishment and instead be charged with fines when convicted of crimes. The nobles even demanded different laws regarding property inheritance after death so that they would not be required to divide land between all of their children. All of these scenarios demonstrate the authority the nobles had in the government during Catherine&#x27;s reign.

===Peasants and serfs===
The lower classes led a far less engaging and enjoyable life. Daily existence was difficult for peasants and serfs, who were at the mercy of their masters at all times. They could not escape poverty and difficult working conditions, especially given the poor quality of the farmland throughout much of Russia. Scarcity almost always occurred on farms because of the cold climate, during which animals could not be let outside. The long winters thus resulted in a short growing season.

As a result of the country&#x27;s poorly developed agricultural system, the peasant diet was high in meat, fish, milk, and butter products, with bread and grains less crucial, except in especially indigent areas. The dominance of the Orthodox Church also further affected food consumption since the church often ordered that fasts be religiously observed on up to 200 days a year. Critics believe that due to the village structure of cultivation and land assignment, the evolution of agriculture was impeded for Russia.

Since the soil was often cold and difficult to farm, especially in the central and northeastern parts of Russia, many peasants went into other trades to support themselves. Many departed their towns for industrial enterprises like manufacturing or to get jobs as drivers, porters, carriers, or servants. The cottage industry also thrived during this period, and many peasants turned to methods other than farming to make a living.

In addition to the struggle to eat and survive, peasant serfs faced several other difficulties. In many ways, serfdom resembled North American slavery except that serfs belonged to the same race and religion as those who ruled over them and were bound to serfdom by their society&#x27;s lack of social mobility rather than by some perceived inferiority inherent in serfs. Serfs also lacked the ability to buy their own freedoms for a fixed sum as slaves in some countries in South America could, which made their situations inescapable except in the rare instances where an owner agreed to release a serf from his duties, which occasionally occurred when a household master died. Serfs could also escape their plights if they survived twenty-five years of service in the armed forces. But in general, laws tied serfs to their masters for life and caused them to suffer under an owner&#x27;s rule. The most harrowing part of the experience was the lack of rights given to a serf, whether he was a peasant, entrepreneur, or member of the serf intelligentsia. His state was one of constant vulnerability; a bad season farming his land could bring famine and its related difficulties to his family, and he was always at the mercy of a master who could switch from benevolent to vicious at any moment. One&#x27;s stability was constantly threatened: a serf&#x27;s family could be removed from their land, sold away, or raped by their owner. The serf could be conscripted for the army, sent to Siberia, punished viciously without cause or proof of guilt, beaten, or even killed.

<text>The period from 1796 to 1855 in Russian history (covering the reigns of Paul I, Alexander I and Nicholas I) saw the Napoleonic Wars, government reform, political reorganization, and economic growth.

==War and peace, 1796–1825==
Catherine II died in 1796, and her son Emperor Paul I (r. 1796–1801) succeeded her. Painfully aware that Catherine had considered bypassing him to name his son, Alexander, as tsar, Paul instituted primogeniture in the male line as the basis for succession. It was one of the lasting reforms of Paul&#x27;s brief reign. He also chartered a Russian-American Company, which eventually led to Russia&#x27;s acquisition of Alaska. Paul limited landowner&#x27;s right to serf labour to three days in a week, alleviating the condition of the serfs.

As a major European power, Russia could not escape the wars involving revolutionary and Napoleonic France. Paul became an adamant opponent of France, and Russia joined Britain and Austria in a war against France. In 1798–1799 Russian troops under one of the country&#x27;s most famous generals, Aleksandr Suvorov, performed brilliantly, driving the French from Italy. On December 18, 1800, Paul unilaterally declared the neighboring kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti annexed to the Russian Empire. Paul&#x27;s support for the ideals of the Knights Hospitaller (and his acceptance of the position of Grand Master) alienated many members of his court. He made peace with France in 1800 and established Second League of Armed Neutrality. Paul, who seems to have already been mentally unstable, alienated the powerful anti-French faction, and in March 1801, Paul was deposed and assassinated.

The new Tsar Alexander I of Russia (r. 1801–1825) came to the throne as the result of his father&#x27;s murder, which he was implicated in. Groomed for the throne by Catherine II and raised in the spirit of enlightenment, Alexander also had an inclination toward romanticism and religious mysticism, particularly in the latter period of his reign. Alexander reorganized the central government, replacing the colleges that Peter the Great had set up with ministries, but without a coordinating prime minister. 

Alexander was, perhaps, the most brilliant diplomat of his time, and his primary focus was not on domestic policy but on foreign affairs, and particularly on Napoleon. Fearing Napoleon&#x27;s expansionist ambitions and the growth of French power, Alexander joined Britain and Austria against Napoleon. Napoleon defeated the Russians and Austrians at Austerlitz in 1805 and defeated the Russians at Friedland in 1807.

After the Russian armies officially liberated allied Georgia from Persian occupation earlier in 1801, making Persia officially lose control over Georgia which it had been ruling for centuries, Alexander fought the Russo-Persian War (1804–1813), the first full-scale war against neighbouring Persia starting in 1804, over control and consolidation over Georgia, but also eventually Azerbaijan, Dagestan and the entire Caucasus in general, which was for large swaths of it an integral territory of Persia. With France Alexander was forced to sue for peace, and by the Treaty of Tilsit, signed in 1807, he became Napoleon&#x27;s ally. Russia lost little territory under the treaty, and Alexander made use of his alliance with Napoleon for further expansion. By the Finnish War he annexed the eastern portion of Sweden, thereby forming the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1809, and acquired Bessarabia from Turkey as a result of the Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812).

Alexander was determined to acquire the disputed territories of major importance in the Caucasus and beyond. His predecessors had already waged wars against Persia, but they had not been able to consolidate Russian authority over the regions, resulting in the regions either being ceded back or being conquered back. After nine years of battle, Russia managed to bring the war to an end on highly favourable terms, completing Russian consolidation and suzerainty over major parts of the Caucasus including the gains of Dagestan, Georgia, most of Azerbaijan and other regions and territories in the Caucasus over Persia. By now, Russia had both full comfortable access to the Black Sea, and Caspian Sea and it would use these newly gained grounds for further wars against Persia and Turkey.

The Russo-French alliance gradually became strained. Napoleon was concerned about Russia&#x27;s intentions in the strategically vital Bosporus and Dardanelles straits. At the same time, Alexander viewed the Duchy of Warsaw, the French-controlled reconstituted Polish state, with suspicion. The requirement of joining France&#x27;s Continental Blockade against Britain was a serious disruption of Russian commerce, and in 1810 Alexander repudiated the obligation. In June 1812, Napoleon invaded Russia with 600,000 troops—a force twice as large as the Russian regular army. Napoleon hoped to inflict a major defeat on the Russians and force Alexander to sue for peace. As Napoleon pushed the Russian forces back, however, he became seriously overextended. Obstinate Russian resistance, members of which declared the Patriotic War, brought Napoleon a disastrous defeat: Less than 30,000 of his troops returned to their homeland. Victory came at a high cost though, as the areas of the country that the French army had marched through lay in ruins.

=== Congress of Vienna 1814–1815 ===
As the French retreated, the Russians pursued them into Central and Western Europe and to the gates of Paris. After the allies defeated Napoleon, Alexander became known as the savior of Europe, and he played a prominent role in the redrawing of the map of Europe at the Congress of Vienna in 1815. In the same year, Alexander initiated the creation of the Holy Alliance, a loose agreement pledging the rulers of the nations involved—including most of Europe—to act according to Christian principles. More pragmatically, in 1814 Russia, Britain, Austria, and Prussia had formed the Quadruple Alliance. When Napoleon suddenly reappeared, Russia was part of the alliance that chased him down. The conservative Bourbons were back in power in Paris and on good terms with Russia. The allies created an international system to maintain the territorial status quo and prevent the resurgence of an expansionist France. The Quadruple Alliance, confirmed by a number of international conferences, ensured Russia&#x27;s influence in Europe. 
At the same time, Russia continued its expansion. The Congress of Vienna created the Congress Poland, to which Alexander granted a constitution. Thus, Alexander I became the constitutional monarch of Poland while remaining the autocratic tsar of Russia. He was also the monarch of Finland, which had been annexed in 1809 and awarded autonomous status.

Despite the liberal, romantic inclinations of his youth, Alexander I after 1815 grew steadily more conservative, isolated from the day-to-day affairs of the state, and inclined to religious mysticism. The lofty hopes that the tsar had once held for his country were frustrated by the immense size and backwardness of it. While vacationing on the Black Sea in 1825, Alexander fell ill with typhus and died at only 47, although there were unfounded stories that he faked his own death, became a monk, and wandered the Siberian wilderness for many years afterwards.

===Decembrist revolt, 1825===
A revolutionary movement was born during the reign of Alexander I. The Decembrist revolt was an aristocratic movement, whose chief actors were army officers and members of the nobility. The reasons for Decembrist Uprising were manifold: opposition on part of the nobility to the regime that successfully limited their privileges through its peasant policy, spread among a section of young officers of liberal and even radical ideas, fears among nationalist section of society, inspired by Alexander perceived Polonofile policy (officers were particularly incensed that Alexander had granted Poland a constitution while Russia remained without one). Several clandestine organizations were preparing for an uprising after Alexander&#x27;s death. There was confusion about who would succeed him because the next in line, his brother Constantine Pavlovich, had relinquished his right to the throne. A group of officers commanding about 3,000 men refused to swear allegiance to the new tsar, Alexander&#x27;s brother Nicholas, proclaiming instead their loyalty to the idea of a Russian constitution. Because these events occurred in December 1825, the rebels were called Decembrists. Nicholas easily overcame the revolt, and the surviving rebels were exiled to Siberia.

== Nicholas I, 1825–1855 ==

Tsar Nicholas I (1796–1855) succeeded his brother to the throne in 1825. He was completely devoid of Alexander&#x27;s mystical, romantic pretensions, instead being a soldier at heart who felt most comfortable when reviewing troops. A cold, no-nonsense autocrat, Nicholas gave no serious thought to any sort of liberalism or political reforms, preferring to rule through the bureaucracy. Alexander had taken steps to improve and modernize the structure of the Russian state, adding a variety of new governmental departments to oversee agriculture, internal security, industrial and infrastructure development, and public health. He had also given thought at various times to creating a representative Parliament, which would not see fruition for a century. As noted above however, Russia proved such an immense, impoverished, and backwards nation that these departments had very little actual authority, in part due to lack of funds, also because of being stonewalled by the landowning nobility.

Nicholas continued these administrative innovations, but made the ministers responsible solely to him. Overall, the effect was to steadily centralize more and more power in the tsar&#x27;s hands. In particular, the state security department (the Third Section) became an almost notorious symbol of repression as its primary aim was to prosecute subversive political activities. Nicholas for his part envisioned the Third Section as the champion of the poor and discriminated against the abuses of the wealthy and privileged, but although some men in the department were honest and took this duty seriously, most of them merely used it as a license to beat up and harass political and religious dissidents. The Third Section was also notorious for the bad relations it had with other governmental departments. Overall, the attempt at building a modern-style European bureaucracy that had begun under Peter the Great was a partial success. Bureaucrats believed that service to the state and the tsar constituted the highest possible calling, the result being that the ranks of the bureaucracy continued to grow by leaps and bounds. Prestige was the main attraction of employment in the bureaucracy, as salaries were small, and advancement through the ranks deliberately kept limited to prevent too many people, especially those of humble birth, from rising too fast. Only the most educated, cultured, and informed men became part of the tsar&#x27;s inner circle of advisers.

The bureaucracy&#x27;s numbers increased by threefold during the first half of the 19th century. Pay continued to be low due to the overall poverty of the Russian state. This was not only due to the country&#x27;s backwards economy, but also because the nobility were tax-exempt and free from the expense of waging wars, not only the great ones, but the smaller campaigns in the Caucasus. Bureaucrats were for the most part uneducated, uninformed of their departments&#x27; respective tasks, and also phenomenally corrupt. Most hesitated to make decisions and preferred to push themselves up through the ranks, with the result that the tsar himself was forced to micromanage thousands of trivial affairs. Russia also suffered from a multitude of antiquated, contradictory, and discriminatory laws against Jews and minority Christian sects. Since not all minorities were part of the lower classes and many officials could not afford to feed their families, bribery was extremely widespread, and yet was probably the only thing that kept the Russian state from being even slower, more corrupt, and oppressive than it was.

The Decembrist uprising had increased Nicholas&#x27;s distrust of the nobility and dislike of anything resembling political reform, even among the upper classes. Education gradually continued to improve after Alexander&#x27;s creation of a universal educational system in 1804, although due to lack of funds the emphasis tended to be on the creation of universities rather than on primary and secondary schools. In the latter part of his reign, the Minister of Education, A.N. Golistyn, moved to censor and exclude the dangerous revolutionary and anti-clerical ideas coming from Western Europe. He encouraged college students to report their professors to the authorities if they expressed subversive views. Those professors so exposed were either fired or threatened with prosecution. In 1833, Count Sergey Ugarov took over as Minister of Education and pursued a more tolerant policy at the expense of excluding the children of the lower classes from universities.

Despite this, school attendance and literacy in Russia continued to increase and there began to form a rising middle class that was cosmopolitan in its outlook and connected with European culture and ideas. State censorship barred direct political dissent and the police were prone to harass even writers who did not involve themselves in politics. The great poet Alexander Pushkin was questioned by authorities in 1824 in part because he had befriended certain Decembrists. Eventually, despite some mistrust from the police, Pushkin was allowed to publish his works until he met an untimely end in 1837 after fighting a duel. The writers Mikhail Lermontov and Nikolai Gogol were also viewed with suspicion.

Censorship was not totally effective, especially as it varied depending on the personal views of each censor, some of whom tolerated liberal ideas. Philosophical arguments and literary criticism were popular ways of subtly expressing political opinions, and it was during this time that the great debate between &quot;Westernizers&quot; and &quot;Slavophiles&quot; emerged. This debate started in 1836 when Pyotr Chaadayev wrote a philosophical letter in the periodical Teleskop, which declared that:

&quot;Standing alone in the world, we have given nothing to the world, we have learned nothing from the world, we have not added a single idea to the mass of human ideas, we have made no contribution to the progress of the human spirit, and everything that has come to us from that spirit, we have disfigured. Today we form a gap in the intellectual order.&quot;

Nicholas argued that Chaadayev must be insane to make such claims and sentenced him to house imprisonment with periodic visits from a doctor. This embarrassing but fairly mild treatment silenced him.

Nicholas appointed the veteran statesman count Speransky to preside over a commission for legal reform. This group in 1832 published the Russian Code of Law. Another of the measures was the reorganization of the State Bank and a general reform of financial matters. This was carried out by finance minister Yegor Kankrin. A secret police, the so-called Third Section, ran a network of spies and informers. The government exercised censorship and other controls over education, publishing, and all manifestations of public life.

In 1833, Minister of Education Sergey Uvarov devised a program of &quot;Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality&quot; as the guiding principle of the national education. The official emphasis on Russian nationalism contributed to a debate on Russia&#x27;s place in the world, the meaning of Russian history, and the future of Russia. One group, the Modernizers, believed that Russia remained backward and primitive and could progress only through more Europeanization. Another group, the Slavophiles, enthusiastically favored the Slavs and their culture and customs, and had a distaste for Modernizers and their culture and customs. The Slavophiles viewed Slavic philosophy as a source of wholeness in Russia and looked askance at rationalism and materialism in the west part of Europe. Some of them believed that the Russian peasant commune, or mir, offered an attractive alternative to modern capitalism and could make Russia a potential social and moral savior. The Slavophiles could therefore be said to represent a form of Russian messianism. 

Russia experienced a flowering of literature and the arts. Through the works of Aleksandr Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, Ivan Turgenev, and numerous others, Russian literature gained international stature and recognition. Ballet took root in Russia after its importation from France, and classical music became firmly established with the compositions of Mikhail Glinka (1804–1857).

Saint Petersburg – Tsarskoe Selo Railway and Moscow – Saint Petersburg Railway were constructed.

Nicholas I made some efforts to improve the lot of the state peasants with the help of the minister Pavel Kiselev and set up committee to prepare a law liberating serfs, but did not abolish serfdom during his reign.

In foreign policy, Nicholas I acted as the protector of ruling legitimism and guardian against revolution. In 1830, after a popular uprising had occurred in France, the Poles in Russian Poland revolted. Poles resented limitation of the privileges of the Polish minority in the lands, annexed by Russia in the 18th century and sought to reestablish the 1772 borders of Poland. Nicholas crushed the rebellion, abrogated the Polish constitution, and reduced Congress Poland to the status of a Russian province, Privislinsky Krai.

In 1848, when a series of revolutions convulsed Europe, Nicholas intervened on behalf of the Habsburgs and helped suppress an uprising in Hungary, and he also urged Prussia not to accept a liberal constitution. Having helped conservative forces repel the specter of revolution, Nicholas I seemed to dominate Europe.

While Nicholas was attempting to maintain the status quo in Europe, he adopted an aggressive policy towards the Ottoman Empire. Nicholas I was following the traditional Russian policy of resolving the so-called Eastern Question by seeking to partition the Ottoman Empire and establish a protectorate over the Orthodox population of the Balkans, still largely under Ottoman control in the 1820s. Russia fought a successful war with the Ottomans in 1828 and 1829. Russia attempted to expand at the expense of the Ottoman Empire and Qajar Persia by using Georgia at its base for the Caucasus and Anatolian front. In 1826 another war was fought against Persia, and despite losing almost all recently consolidated territories in the first year of the battle in the first year of the Persian invasion, Russia managed to bring an end to the war on highly favourable terms in the second part of the war, including the official gains of Armenia, Nakhchivan, Nagorno-Karabakh, Azerbaijan, and Iğdır Province, having by now conquered most of the Persian territories in the Caucasus and therefore setting the way fully open to push deeper into Persia and Ottoman Turkey. In 1828 in the same year the war with Persia ended, another war against Turkey, its other territorial rival, started. Nicholas invaded northeastern Anatolia and occupied the strategic Ottoman towns of Erzurum and Gumushane and, posing as protector and saviour of the Greek Orthodox population, receiving extensive support from the region&#x27;s Pontic Greeks. Following a brief occupation, the Russian imperial army withdrew back into Georgia. 

By the London Straits Convention of 1841, the Western powers affirmed Ottoman control over the straits and forbade any power, including Russia, to send warships through the straits. Based on his role in suppressing the revolutions of 1848 and his mistaken belief that he had British diplomatic support, Nicholas moved against the Ottomans, who declared war on Russia in 1853. Fearing the results of an Ottoman defeat by Russia, in 1854 Britain and France joined the Crimean War on the Ottoman side. Austria offered the Ottomans diplomatic support, and Prussia remained neutral, leaving Russia without allies on the continent. The European allies landed in Crimea and laid siege to the well-fortified Russian base at Sevastopol. After a year&#x27;s siege the base fell. Nicholas I died before the fall of Sevastopol&#x27;, but he already had recognized the failure of his regime. Russia now faced the choice of initiating major reforms or losing its status as a major European power.

<doc id="870331" wikidata="Q1573946" url="?curid=870331" title="Plonsters">
<text>Plonsters is a German animated children&#x27;s television program produced by Anima Studio für Film &amp; Grafik GmbH in Hamburg, Germany, and Bettina Matthaei for Egmont Imagination. Each episode is about 3 minutes and 30 seconds long and is produced using stop motion animation done with plasticine, also called claymation. The title is a portmanteau of &quot;plasticine&quot; and &quot;monsters&quot;. The characters also appeared in educational books.

== Plot ==
The show features three little clay monsters, the Plonsters. They are Plif (the green plonster), who likes to play practical jokes, Plops (the blue plonster) who is the cranky one and Plummy (the orange plonster) who is the cheerful one. They can morph themselves into anything, and their language is some kind of gibberish. 

The plot of the show is usually that Plif and Plops bully Plummy by ruining everything he does (as well as excluding him from some activities whenever possible), but he gets back at them every time, and every episode ends with the three of them playing together peacefully.

<doc id="870334" wikidata="Q1077445" url="?curid=870334" title="Infinite Jest">
<text>Infinite Jest is a 1996 novel by American writer David Foster Wallace. Categorized as an encyclopedic novel, &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; is featured in &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005.

The novel has an unconventional narrative structure and includes hundreds of extensive endnotes, some with footnotes of their own.

A literary fiction bestseller after having sold 44,000 hardcover copies in its first year of publication, the novel has since sold more than a million copies worldwide.

==Development==
Wallace began &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;, &quot;or something like it&quot;, at various times between 1986 and 1989. His efforts in 1991–92 were more productive; by the end of 1993, he had a working draft of the novel.

From early 1992 until the novel&#x27;s publication, excerpts from various drafts appeared sporadically in magazines and literary journals including &quot;Harvard Review&quot;, &quot;Grand Street&quot;, &quot;Conjunctions&quot;, &quot;Review of Contemporary Fiction&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, &quot;The Iowa Review&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and the &quot;Los Angeles Times Magazine&quot;.

The book was edited by publisher Little, Brown and Company&#x27;s Michael Pietsch. Pietsch made suggestions and recommendations to Wallace, but every editing decision was Wallace&#x27;s. He accepted cuts amounting to around 250 manuscript pages from his original submission. He resisted many changes for reasons that he usually explained.

The novel gets its name from &quot;Hamlet&quot;, Act V, Scene 1, in which Hamlet holds the skull of the court jester, Yorick, and says, &quot;Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how abhorred in my imagination it is!&quot;

Wallace&#x27;s working title for &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; was &quot;A Failed Entertainment&quot;.

==Setting==
In the novel&#x27;s future world, the United States, Canada, and Mexico together compose a unified North American superstate known as the Organization of North American Nations, or O.N.A.N. (an allusion to onanism).

Corporations are allowed the opportunity to bid for and purchase naming rights for each calendar year, replacing traditional numerical designations with ostensibly honorary monikers bearing corporate names. Although the narrative is fragmented and spans several &quot;named&quot; years, most of the story takes place during &quot;The Year of the Depend Adult Undergarment&quot; (Y.D.A.U.).

On the orders of U.S. President Johnny Gentle (a &quot;clean freak&quot; who campaigned on the platform of cleaning up the US while ensuring that no American would be caused any discomfort in the process), much of what used to be the northeastern United States and southeastern Canada has become a giant hazardous waste dump, an area &quot;given&quot; to Canada and known as the &quot;Great Concavity&quot; by Americans due to the resulting displacement of the border.

==Plot==
There are several major interwoven narratives, including:
* A fringe group of Québécois radicals, (; A.F.R.), plan a violent coup to free Quebec from O.N.A.N.
* Addicts living in Boston reach &quot;rock bottom&quot; with substance abuse before entering a residential drug and alcohol recovery program, Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House, where they progress in recovery through Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA).
* Students train and study at the Enfield Tennis Academy (E.T.A.), founded by James Incandenza and now run by Avril Incandenza and Avril&#x27;s adopted brother Charles Tavis.
* The personal drama of the Incandenza family centers around Hal&#x27;s struggles to live up to high expectations of academic and athletic success amid wider dysfunction.

These narratives are connected via a film, &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;, also called &quot;the Entertainment&quot; or &quot;the samizdat&quot;. The film is so compelling that its viewers lose all interest in anything other than repeatedly viewing it, and thus eventually die. It was James Incandenza&#x27;s final work. He completed it during a period of sobriety that was insisted upon by its lead actress, Joelle van Dyne. The Québécois separatists seek a replicable master copy of the work to aid in acts of terrorism against the United States. The United States Office of Unspecified Services (O.U.S.) aims to intercept the master copy to prevent mass dissemination and the destabilization of the Organization of North American Nations, or else to find or produce an anti-entertainment that can counter the film&#x27;s effects. Joelle seeks treatment for substance abuse problems at Ennet House. A.F.R. member (and possible O.U.S. double agent) Rémy Marathe visits Ennet House, aiming to find Joelle and a lead to the master copy of &quot;the Entertainment&quot;.

Wallace compared the model&#x27;s structure to a Sierpinski gasket, a type of fractal. He said the book&#x27;s &quot;chaos is more on the surface&quot; and that it had a coherent structure despite its seemingly disjointed plot.

==Major characters==

===The Incandenza family===
* Hal Incandenza is the youngest of the Incandenza children and arguably the novel&#x27;s protagonist, as its events revolve around his time at E.T.A. Hal is prodigiously intelligent and talented, but insecure about his abilities (and eventually his mental state). His friend Michael Pemulis calls him Inc, and his favorite thing to do is secretly smoke marijuana in the seclusion of the E.T.A. tunnels. He has difficult relationships with both his parents. He has an eidetic memory and has memorized the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, and like his mother often corrects his friends&#x27; and family&#x27;s grammar. Hal&#x27;s mental degradation and alienation from those around him culminate in his chronologically last appearance in the novel, in which his attempts at speech and facial expressions are incomprehensible to others. The origin of Hal&#x27;s final condition is unclear; possible causes include marijuana withdrawal, a drug obtained by Michael Pemulis, a patch of mold Hal ate as a child, and a mental breakdown from years of training to be a top junior tennis player.
* Avril Incandenza, née Mondragon, is the domineering mother of the Incandenza children and wife of James. A tall (197 cm, or 6 ft. 5.5 in.), beautiful francophone Quebecer, she becomes a major figure at Enfield Tennis Academy after her husband&#x27;s suicide and begins, or perhaps continues, a relationship with Charles Tavis, the school&#x27;s new head, also a Canadian and Avril&#x27;s either adoptive or half-brother. Her sexual relationships with men are a matter of some speculation/discussion; one with John &quot;No Relation&quot; Wayne is depicted. Avril has phobias about uncleanliness and disease, closed doors, and overhead lighting, and is also described as agoraphobic. She has an obsessive-compulsive need to watch over E.T.A. and her two youngest sons, Hal and Mario, who live at the school; Avril and Orin are no longer in contact. James Incandenza believes that he can connect with his children only through her. Orin believes she runs the family with ingrained manipulation and the illusion of choice. Her family nickname is &quot;the Moms&quot;.
* James Orin Incandenza Jr., Avril&#x27;s husband and Orin&#x27;s, Mario&#x27;s and Hal&#x27;s father, is an optics expert and filmmaker as well as the founder of Enfield Tennis Academy (though he increasingly leaves E.T.A. business to Charles Tavis). The son of small-time actor James O. Incandenza Sr. (who played &quot;The Man from Glad&quot; in the 1960s), James Jr. created &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; (also known as &quot;the Entertainment&quot; or &quot;the samizdat&quot;), an enigmatic and fatally seductive film that was his last work. He used Joelle van Dyne, his son Orin&#x27;s strikingly beautiful girlfriend, in many of his films, including the fatal &quot;Entertainment&quot;. He appears in the book mainly either in flashbacks or as a &quot;wraith&quot;, having killed himself at the age of 54 by placing his head in a microwave oven. He is an alcoholic who drinks Wild Turkey whiskey. His family nickname is &quot;Himself&quot;. Orin also calls him &quot;the Mad Stork&quot; or (once) &quot;the Sad Stork&quot;.
* Mario Incandenza is the Incandenzas&#x27; second son, although his biological father may be Charles Tavis. Severely deformed since birth—he is macrocephalic, homodontic, bradykinetic, and stands or walks at a 45-degree angle—as well as mentally &quot;slow&quot;, he is nonetheless perennially cheerful and kind. He is also a budding auteur, having served as James&#x27;s camera and directorial assistant and later inheriting the prodigious studio equipment and film lab his father built on the academy grounds. Somewhat surprisingly, he is an avid fan of Madame Psychosis&#x27;s dark radio show, partly because he finds her voice familiar. Hal, though younger, acts like a supportive older brother to Mario, whom Hal calls &quot;Booboo&quot;.
* Orin Incandenza is the Incandenzas&#x27; eldest son. He is a punter for the Phoenix Cardinals and a serial womanizer, and is estranged from everyone in his family except Hal. It is suggested that Orin lost his attraction to Joelle after she became disfigured when her mother threw acid in her face during a Thanksgiving dinner, but Orin cites Joelle&#x27;s questionable relationship with his father as the reason for the breakup even though he later admits he knows there was no romance. Orin focuses his subsequent womanizing on young mothers; Hal suggests that this is because he blames his father&#x27;s death on his mother. Molly Notkin, a friend of Joelle&#x27;s, says that Orin has numerous &quot;malcathected issues with his mother&quot;. Orin&#x27;s relationship with his father was tense. His father tells Joelle &quot;he simply didn&#x27;t know how to speak with either of his undamaged sons without their mother&#x27;s presence and mediation. Orin could not be made to shut up.&quot;

===The Enfield Tennis Academy===

* Michael Pemulis, a working-class teenager from an Allston, Massachusetts family, and Hal&#x27;s best friend. A prankster and the school&#x27;s resident drug dealer, Pemulis is also very proficient in mathematics. This, combined with his limited but ultraprecise lobbing, made him the school&#x27;s first master of Eschaton, a computer-aided turn-based nuclear wargame that requires players to be adept at both game theory and lobbing tennis balls at targets. Although the novel takes place long after Pemulis&#x27;s Eschaton days (the game is played by 12- to 14-year-olds), Pemulis is still regarded as the game&#x27;s all-time greatest player, and he remains the final court of appeal for the game. His brother, Matty, is a gay hustler who as a child was sexually abused by their father.
* John &quot;No Relation&quot; Wayne, the top-ranked player at E.T.A. He is frighteningly efficient, controlled, and machine-like on the court. Wayne is almost never directly quoted in the narrative; his statements are either summarized by the narrator or repeated by other characters. His Canadian citizenship has been revoked since he came to E.T.A. His father is a sick asbestos miner in Quebec who hopes John will soon start earning &quot;serious $&quot; in &quot;the Show&quot; (professional tennis) to &quot;take him away from all this&quot;. Pemulis discovers Wayne is having a sexual relationship with Avril Incandenza, and it is later revealed that Hal is also aware of the relationship. Wayne may be sympathetic to, or actively supporting, the radical Quebec separatists.
* Ortho &quot;The Darkness&quot; Stice, another of Hal&#x27;s close friends. His name consists of the Greek root &quot;ortho&quot; (&quot;straight&quot;) and the anglicized suffix &quot;-stice&quot; (&quot;a space&quot;) from the noun &quot;interstice&quot;, which originally derived from the Latin verb &quot;sistere&quot; (&quot;to stand&quot;). He endorses only brands that have black-colored products, and is at all times clothed entirely in black, hence his nickname. Late in the book Stice nearly defeats Hal in a three-set tennis match, shortly after which his forehead is frozen to a window and his bed appears either bolted or mysteriously levitated to the ceiling. There are indications that Stice is being visited by the ghost of James Incandenza.

===Ennet House Drug and Alcohol Recovery House===
* Don Gately, a former thief and Demerol addict, and current counselor in residence at Ennet House. One of the novel&#x27;s primary characters, Gately is physically enormous and a reluctant but dedicated Alcoholics Anonymous member. He is critically wounded in an altercation with several Canadian men, and much of the later part of the novel involves his inner monologue while he recuperates in a Boston hospital. Gately had a complicated childhood. His stepfather abused his mother. During his middle-school and high-school years, Gately&#x27;s size made him a formidable football talent. During his period as an addict and burglar, he accidentally kills M. DuPlessis, a leader of one of the many separatist Québécois organizations featured in the novel. Gately is visited by the ghosts of James O. Incandenza and Lyle.
* Joelle van Dyne, also known as &quot;Madame Psychosis&quot; (cf. metempsychosis), a stage name she received from James Incandenza when she starred in his films (and later her on-air name in her radio show &quot;60+/−&quot;). She became acquainted with James through her college relationship with Orin Incandenza, who referred to her as &quot;The Prettiest Girl of All Time&quot;, or P.G.O.A.T. She appears in the lethally addictive Entertainment, reaching down toward a wobbly &quot;neonatal&quot; lens as if it were in a bassinet and apologizing profusely, her face blurred beyond recognition. Extremely beautiful as a young woman, Joelle later becomes a member of the Union of the Hideously and Improbably Deformed (U.H.I.D.), and wears a veil to hide her face. According to Molly Notkin, Joelle&#x27;s face was disfigured by a beaker of acid her mother threw, intending to hit Joelle&#x27;s father, who had just revealed he was in love with her (Joelle). Joelle says she wears the veil because her superlative attractiveness plagued her throughout her life, causing her to suffer social and romantic isolation until she met Orin. Joelle tries to &quot;eliminate her own map&quot; (that is, suicide) in Notkin&#x27;s bathroom by massive ingestion of freebase cocaine, which lands her in Ennet House as a resident. Gately and Joelle develop a mutual attraction.

===Les Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents===

Les Assassins des Fauteuils Rollents (A.F.R.), the Wheelchair Assassins, are a Québécois separatist group. (The use of &quot;rollents&quot; where &quot;roulants&quot; would be correct is in keeping with other erroneous French words and phrases in the novel.) They are one of many such groups that developed after the United States coerced Canada and Mexico into joining the Organization of North American Nations (O.N.A.N.), but the A.F.R. is the most deadly and extremist. While other separatist groups are willing to settle for nationhood, the A.F.R. wants Canada to secede from O.N.A.N. and to reject America&#x27;s forced gift of its polluted &quot;Great Concavity&quot; (or, Hal and Orin speculate, is pretending that those are its goals to put pressure on Canada to let Quebec secede). The A.F.R. seeks the master copy of &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; as a terrorist weapon to achieve its goals. The A.F.R. has its roots in a childhood game in which miners&#x27; sons would line up alongside a train track and compete to be the last to jump across the path of an oncoming train, a game in which many were killed or rendered legless (hence the wheelchairs).

Only one miner&#x27;s son ever (disgracefully) failed to jump—Bernard Wayne, who may be related to E.T.A.&#x27;s John Wayne. Québécoise Avril&#x27;s liaisons with John Wayne, and with A.F.R.&#x27;s Guillaume DuPlessis and Luria Perec, suggest that Avril may have ties to the A.F.R. as well. There is also evidence linking E.T.A. prorector Thierry Poutrincourt to the group.
* Rémy Marathe is a member of the Wheelchair Assassins who secretly talks to Hugh/Helen Steeply. Marathe is a quadruple agent: the A.F.R. thinks that he is a triple agent, only pretending to betray the A.F.R., while Marathe and Steeply know that he only pretends to pretend to betray them. He does this in order to secure medical support for his wife (who was born without a skull) from the Office of Unspecified Services. Late in the novel, Marathe is sent to infiltrate Ennet House in the guise of a Swiss drug addict.

===Other recurring characters===

These characters cross between the major narrative threads:
* Hugh Steeply, an agent who assumes a female identity (&quot;Helen&quot;) for an operative role, with whom Orin Incandenza becomes obsessed. Hugh works for the government Office of Unspecified Services and has gone undercover to get information out of Orin about the Entertainment. He is the U.S.O.U.S.&#x27;s contact with the A.F.R. mole Marathe.
* Lyle, E.T.A. weight room guru. He spends most of his time perched atop the towel dispenser in the lotus position. Lyle licks the sweat off the boys&#x27; bodies after they work out and in turn gives them life advice. His behavior is described by the narrator as unusual but &quot;nothing faggy&quot;. Lyle is close to Mario, whom he sometimes employs to speak to players who struggle with self-esteem.
* &quot;Poor Tony&quot; Krause, a cross-dressing junkie and thief who steals a woman&#x27;s exterior heart, causing her death, and later robs Ennet House residents.
* Randy Lenz, a &quot;small time organic-coke dealer who wears sportcoats rolled up over his parlor-tanned forearms and is always checking his pulse on the inside of his wrists&quot;. An Ennet House resident, he constantly asks the time but refuses to wear a watch and regularly violates the sobriety rule.
* Geoffrey Day, an Ennet House resident who struggles with the clichés of AA. He comes to Ennet House after putting his car through a sporting-goods store window.
* Marlon Bain, a former E.T.A. student who was close to Orin. His obsessive-compulsive disorder has made it nearly impossible for him to leave his apartment. Steeply contacts him for information about Orin and the Incandenzas.

==Style==
&quot;Infinite Jest&quot; is a postmodern encyclopedic novel, famous for its length, detail and digressions involving 388 endnotes, some of which themselves have footnotes. It has also been called metamodernist and hysterical realist. Wallace&#x27;s &quot;encyclopedic display of knowledge&quot; incorporates media theory, linguistics, film studies, sport, addiction, science, and issues of national identity. The book is often humorous yet explores melancholy deeply. The novel&#x27;s narration mostly alternates between third-person limited and omniscient points of view, but also includes several first-person accounts.

Eschewing chronological plot development and straightforward resolution—a concern often mentioned in reviews—the novel supports a wide range of readings. At various times Wallace said that he intended for the novel&#x27;s plot to resolve, but indirectly; responding to his editor&#x27;s concerns about the lack of resolution, he said &quot;the answers all [exist], but just past the last page&quot;. Long after publication Wallace maintained this position, stating that the novel &quot;does resolve, but it resolves ... outside of the right frame of the picture. You can get a pretty good idea, I think, of what happens&quot;. Critical reviews and a reader&#x27;s guide have provided insight, but Stephen Burn notes that Wallace privately conceded to Jonathan Franzen that &quot;the story can&#x27;t fully be made sense of&quot;.

In an interview with Charlie Rose, Wallace characterized the novel&#x27;s heavy use of endnotes as a method of disrupting the linearity of the text while maintaining some sense of narrative cohesion. In a separate interview on Michael Silverblatt&#x27;s radio show &quot;Bookworm&quot;, Wallace said the plotting and notes had a fractal structure modeled after the Sierpiński gasket.

English critic James Wood called the novel an exemplar of &quot;hysterical realism&quot;, a term he also applied to works by Zadie Smith, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo. He criticized such novelists for seeking to &quot;turn fiction into social theory&quot; and as &quot;evasive of reality&quot;.

==Themes==

The novel touches on many topics, including addiction (to drugs, but also to sex and fame), withdrawal, recovery, death, family relationships, absent or dead parents, mental health, suicide, sadness, entertainment, film theory, media theory, linguistics, science, Quebec separatism, national identity, and tennis as a metaphysical activity.

The book&#x27;s various plot threads, including Hal&#x27;s struggle to succeed in a competitive academic and athletic environment, Gately&#x27;s recovery from addiction, and the film &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; as an all-consuming form of entertainment, are tied together by an overarching theme of addiction and devotion. Conversations between Marathe, a double agent betraying the Quebecois separatist movement for the sake of his wife, and Steeply, an American agent and Marathe&#x27;s contact, serve as a chorus for the story, with interludes where the two discuss the nature of entertainment and worship in American culture. A form of addiction or devotion is central to nearly every character&#x27;s life; literary critic Paul Curtis argues that addiction, &quot;however abnormal, is the &quot;norm&quot; of the novel.&quot;

Worship and addiction remained a central theme of Wallace&#x27;s work. In his 2005 commencement speech at Kenyon College, he said: &quot;Everybody worships. The only choice we get is what to worship&quot;.

==Literary connections==
&quot;Infinite Jest&quot; draws explicitly or allusively on many previous works of literature.

As its title implies, the novel is in part based on the play &quot;Hamlet&quot;. Enfield Tennis Academy corresponds to Denmark, ruled by James (King Hamlet) and Avril (Queen Gertrude). When James dies, he is replaced by Charles (Claudius), the uncle of Avril&#x27;s gifted son Hal (Prince Hamlet). As in the play, the son&#x27;s task is to fight incipient mental breakdown in order to redeem his father&#x27;s reputation.

Another link is to the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, wherein the son Telemachus (Hal) has to grow apart from his dominating mother Penelope (Avril) and discover the truth about his absent father Odysseus (James). (That pattern is also reproduced in the novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;, set in a realistic version of Dublin populated by a wide range of inhabitants, just as &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; is mostly in a realistic Boston with a varied population.) In one scene, Hal, on the phone with Orin, says that clipping his toenails into a wastebasket &quot;now seems like an exercise in telemachry.&quot; Orin then asks whether Hal meant telemetry. Christopher Bartlett has argued that Hal&#x27;s mistake is a direct reference to Telemachus, who for the first four books of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; believes that his father is dead.

Links to &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; have been analyzed by Timothy Jacobs, who sees Orin representing the nihilistic Dmitri, Hal standing for Ivan and Mario the simple and good Alyosha.

The film so entertaining that its viewers lose interest in anything else has been likened to the Monty Python sketch &quot;The Funniest Joke in the World&quot;, as well as to &quot;the experience machine&quot;, a thought experiment by Robert Nozick.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Infinite Jest&quot; was marketed heavily, and Wallace had to adapt to being a public figure. He was interviewed in national magazines and went on a 10-city book tour. Publisher Little, Brown equated the book&#x27;s heft with its importance in marketing and sent a series of cryptic teaser postcards to 4,000 people, announcing a novel of &quot;infinite pleasure&quot; and &quot;infinite style&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; sent reporter David Lipsky to follow Wallace on his &quot;triumphant&quot; book tour—the first time the magazine had sent a reporter to profile a young author in 10 years. The interview was never published in the magazine but became Lipsky&#x27;s &quot;New York Times&quot;-bestselling book &quot;Although of Course You End Up Becoming Yourself&quot; (2010), of which the 2015 movie &quot;The End of the Tour&quot; is an adaptation.

Early reviews contributed to &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;″s hype, many of them describing it as a momentous literary event. According to Book Marks, the book received &quot;rave&quot; reviews based on 11 critic reviews, with eight &quot;raves&quot; and three &quot;positive&quot;. 

In the &quot;Review of Contemporary Fiction&quot;, Steven Moore called the book &quot;a profound study of the postmodern condition&quot;. In 2004, Chad Harbach wrote that, in retrospect, &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; &quot;now looks like the central American novel of the past thirty years, a dense star for lesser work to orbit&quot;. In a 2008 retrospective, &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the book &quot;a masterpiece that&#x27;s also a monster—nearly 1,100 pages of mind-blowing inventiveness and disarming sweetness. Its size and complexity make it forbidding and esoteric.&quot;

&quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its list of the 100 best English-language novels published between 1923 and 2005.

As Wallace&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; is at the center of the new discipline of &quot;Wallace Studies&quot;, which, according to &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, &quot;... is on its way to becoming a robust scholarly enterprise.&quot;

Not all critics were as laudatory. Some early reviews, such as Michiko Kakutani&#x27;s in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, were mixed, recognizing the inventiveness of the writing but criticizing the length and plot. She called the novel &quot;a vast, encyclopedic compendium of whatever seems to have crossed Wallace&#x27;s mind.&quot; In the &quot;London Review of Books&quot;, Dale Peck wrote of the novel, &quot;... it is, in a word, terrible. Other words I might use include bloated, boring, gratuitous, and—perhaps especially—uncontrolled.&quot; Harold Bloom, Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University, called it &quot;just awful&quot; and written with &quot;no discernible talent&quot; (in the novel, Bloom&#x27;s own work is called &quot;turgid&quot;). In a review of Wallace&#x27;s work up to the year 2000, A. O. Scott wrote of &quot;Infinite Jest&quot;, &quot;[T]he novel&#x27;s Pynchonesque elements...feel rather willed and secondhand. They are impressive in the manner of a precocious child&#x27;s performance at a dinner party, and, in the same way, ultimately irritating: they seem motivated, mostly, by a desire to show off.&quot;

Some critics have since qualified their initial stances. In 2008, A. O. Scott called &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; an &quot;enormous, zeitgeist-gobbling novel that set his generation&#x27;s benchmark for literary ambition&quot; and Wallace &quot;the best mind of his generation&quot;. James Wood has said that he regrets his negative review: &quot;I wish I&#x27;d slowed down a bit more with David Foster Wallace.&quot; &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; is one of the recommendations in Kakutani&#x27;s book &quot;Ex Libris: 100 Books to Read and Reread&quot;.

==Adaptations==
Playwright Ken Campbell worked on an adaptation of &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; for the Millennium. His concept was to have 1,000 performers who each paid $23 to take part in the event, which would last a week. It did not come to fruition. German theatrical company Hebbel am Ufer produced a 24-hour avant-garde open-air theatre adaptation in 2012.

&quot;Infinite Jest&quot; was adapted in Finnish for radio and broadcast in six episodes by Yle in January 2023.

== In popular culture ==
* The &quot;Parks and Recreation&quot; episode &quot;Partridge&quot; contains various references to the novel. For example, Ann and Chris take the &quot;Incandenza-Pemulis Parenting Compatibility Quiz&quot;, and Ann&#x27;s fertility counselor, Dr. Van Dyne, works at the C.T. Tavis Medical Center.
* The video for The Decemberists&#x27; &quot;Calamity Song&quot; recreates the novel&#x27;s Eschaton chapter.
* The music video for MC Lars and Wheatus&#x27;s &quot;Finite Jest&quot; recounts the plot of Wallace&#x27;s novel from Hal&#x27;s perspective, recreating scenes from the book.
* The Infinite Summer project, an online book group with the goal of reading &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; over a single summer, took place in 2009. It included daily commentary from well-known writers, musicians and media personalities.
* The rock band We Are the Fury named its 2006 EP &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; after the novel.
* The hardcore punk band Fury named its album &quot;Failed Entertainment&quot; after the novel&#x27;s working title.
* The indie pop rock band The 1975&#x27;s song title &quot;Surrounded by Heads and Bodies&quot; was inspired by the novel&#x27;s opening line. The band&#x27;s lead singer, Matty Healy, was reading the book while in rehab.

Played forward for Spartak Kostroma (1965–1967, 1975–1976), Iskra Smolensk (1968–1972), CSKA Moscow (1970), Gomselmash Gomel (1973–1974), Spartak Moscow (1977–1980), Lokomotiv Moscow (1981), Moskvich Moscow (1982). Played 82 games and scored 38 goals in the premier league of the USSR championship. USSR champion in 1979. He was the top scorer at the USSR championship in 1978 (19 goals). He played five (5) games for the USSR national team. His playing career was unusual in that he only got to the highest level of club football in USSR when he was 29 years old. He achieved highest level success quickly once he got to Spartak Moscow. However, that sudden late-career revival did not last for too long and he retired soon thereafter.

==Managerial career==
After finishing his playing career, he became a coach at the Kapotnya Moscow football school (1982–1984), Krasnaya Presnya Moscow (1984–1985), SC Krasny Bogatyr Moscow (1985–1988), pop singers team that played exhibition games, Zvezdy Sporta (1993–1994).

In 1994, he was hired as an assistant coach for the top Russian club at the time, Spartak Moscow. When Oleg Romantsev, who was head coach of Spartak and of the Russian national team, decided to focus on the national team in 1996, Yartsev was appointed the head coach of Spartak. Spartak was rebuilding at the time, but even with many young players in the lineup, they won the league that year. They did so in a &quot;golden game&quot; which had to be played because Spartak and Alania Vladikavkaz were level on points after the championship. How much of that team&#x27;s success was due to Yartsev is still questioned, because Romantsev never really left the team and some say he continued to make all the important decisions behind the scenes. Romantsev took back his head coach position in 1997, moving Yartsev back into the assistant position.

In June 1998 Yartsev was appointed the head coach of Spartak&#x27;s cross-city arch-rival, Dynamo Moscow. Despite getting to the Russian Cup final in the spring of 1999, generally he did not have much success with that team and was fired in June 1999. Before one of the Dynamo games that was played on Yartsev&#x27;s birthday, Sergei Stepashin, who was the Prime Minister of Russia at the time, gave Yartsev a sabre as a birthday gift in a sideline pre-game ceremony. Yartsev got another head coach position soon enough, when he joined Rotor Volgograd in January 2000. However, he could not do much with that team either and was fired in June of same year. For the next three years he was the manager of the Spartak Moscow veterans team.

In August 2003, Russia was very close to elimination from their Euro 2004 preliminary qualification group and the coach Valery Gazzayev, was fired. Most of the other high-level Russian coaches have already coached the national team at one point or another, so unexpectedly Russian soccer federation decided to put Yartsev in charge. Under Yartsev&#x27;s management, Russia qualified for the playoff preliminary qualification matches, in which they beat Wales. That series ended with controversy. First Russia asked UEFA to disqualify Wales midfielder Ryan Giggs for elbowing a Russian defender in the first leg of the playoffs, which UEFA refused to do. Later key Russian midfielder Egor Titov was disqualified for testing positive for an illegal performance-enhancing drug, Wales asked to be declared winners because of that, but that request was ultimately denied and their court case dismissed.

In UEFA Euro 2004 Russia lost the first two games to Spain and Portugal 1–0 and 2–0 and was the first team to be eliminated. After the first game Yartsev sent home one of the most experienced Russian midfielders, Alexander Mostovoi, after Mostovoi complained to the press that Yartsev is overworking players in training sessions, so they do not have any energy left for the games. Yartsev changed lineup extensively in every game, first because some key defenders were injured and he had to play the reserves and young players, and then because of disqualifications to Roman Sharonov and Sergei Ovchinnikov, who were sent off in the first two games. In their third and final game, Russia defeated Greece 2–1. That ended up being the only Greek loss in the whole tournament as Greece eventually won it all, defeating Portugal in the finals (Russia was not very lucky in getting drawn into the same group as two eventual finalists). Yartsev was not fired despite not coming out of the group stage.

After a 7–1 loss to Portugal in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifying Yartsev kept his job, but then resigned after a 1–1 draw with Estonia.

In early 2007, he was hired as a coach for FC Torpedo Moscow, who got relegated in 2006 from the Russian Premier League for the first time in its history. He was fired on June 20, 2007, Torpedo was in 7th place in First Division at the time (only the top 2 teams get promoted into the Premier League).

==Personal life==

Yartsev was married, and has two daughters. His son Alexander was murdered 18 February 2007 in his own home.

Yartsev was a member of the United Russia party. During the 2018 presidential election, he became part of the PutinTeam movement, which supported Vladimir Putin.
