<text>Guillermo Vilas (born 17 August 1952) is an Argentine former professional tennis player. He was the world No. 1 of the Grand Prix seasons in 1974, 1975 and 1977. He won 62 singles titles and 16 doubles titles during his career, four major titles and the 1974 Tour Finalss. &quot;World Tennis&quot;, &quot;Agence France-Presse&quot; and &quot;Livre d&#x27;or du tennis 1977&quot; (Christian Collin-Bernard Ficot), among other rankings and publications, rated him as world No. 1 in 1977. In the computerized ATP rankings, he peaked at No. 2 in April 1975, a position he held for a total of 83 weeks, although some have argued that Vilas should have been ranked No. 1 for at least 10 weeks, particularly in 1977 when he won two majors. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1991, two years after his first retirement.

Vilas is known for his prowess on clay courts. He won over 650 matches on clay, an all-time record. His peak was the 1977 season during which he won 16 ATP singles titles, including two majors (both on clay) and had a 53-match winning streak on clay, the longest in the Open Era at his time. In 2016, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; ranked him as the third best male clay-court player of all time, behind Rafael Nadal and Björn Borg. In 2018, Steve Tignor for &quot;Tennis Magazine&quot; ranked him as the 16th greatest tennis player of the Open Era.

Historical and statistical studies presented in 2015 by Argentinian journalist Eduardo Puppo and Romanian mathematician Marian Ciulpan concluded that Vilas should have been No. 1 in the old ATP ranking system for seven weeks between 1975 and 1976. The ATP and its chief executive at that time, Chris Kermode, although not refuting the data, decided not to officially recognize Vilas as No. 1. In October 2020, Netflix released a documentary film about Vilas&#x27;s case titled &quot;Guillermo Vilas: Settling the Score&quot;. In May 2024, ATP&#x27;s vice-president confirmed that Vilas will never be number one.

==Career==
Raised in the seaside resort of Mar del Plata, Vilas was a left-hander and played his first tour event in 1968. He was in the year-ending top ten from 1974 through 1982. He was a clay-court specialist and played well on hard-court, grass, and carpet surfaces.

He won four Grand Slam titles: the 1977 French Open and the 1977 US Open (both played on clay) and the 1978 and 1979 Australian Open (both played on grass). He was also the runner-up at the French Open three times (1975, 1978, and 1982) and at the Australian Open once (January 1977).

In 1974, he won the year-end Masters Grand Prix title. In addition, he won seven Grand Prix Super Series titles (1975–80), the precursors to the current Masters 1000.

===Best year===
A left-handed baseliner, Vilas&#x27;s best year on tour was 1977 when he won 16 singles titles, including two of the four major Grand Slam singles tournaments and 16 of the 31 Association of Tennis Professionals tournaments he entered. His playing record for 1977 was 130 wins against 15 losses (89.65%). Not including the Masters year-end championship, he won 72 of his last 73 ATP matches in 1977. The highest point during this run was winning the last US Open played at Forest Hills against Jimmy Connors 2–6, 6–3, 7–6(7–4), 6–0 in a match where Vilas surprised his American rival by attacking the net.

===Winning streak===
In 1977 he won seven consecutive titles after Wimbledon—Kitzbühel (clay), Washington (clay), Louisville (clay), South Orange (clay), Columbus (clay), US Open (clay) and Paris (clay)—and set up a 46-match all-surface winning streak. He also had a record 53-match winning streak on clay courts, which stood until surpassed by Rafael Nadal in 2006. Both his winning streaks were terminated in October 1977 by Ilie Năstase in the final of the Raquette d&#x27;Or tournament. In that best-of-five-set final, Vilas dropped the first two sets by 6–1, 7–5 and then retired in protest of Năstase&#x27;s use of a spaghetti racquet. (The ITF had voted to ban the racquet, but the ban did not take effect until the day after the match). After that he won a further 28 matches in a row with titles at Tehran, Bogotá, Santiago, Buenos Aires (all on clay), and Johannesburg (hard). That run was ended in the Masters semi-finals by Björn Borg.

===ATP ranking No. 1 controversy===
Even though he won 21 singles titles including 16 ATP titles that season, including the French Open and the US Open and was the runner-up at the January edition of the Australian Open in 1977, Vilas was never ranked by the ATP as world No. 1 during 1977 which was due to the fact that the rankings at the time were based on the average of a player&#x27;s results. He was instead ranked year-end world No. 2, behind Jimmy Connors who won 8 singles titles only (including the Masters Grand Prix and did not win any of the 4 Grand Slam titles, but was the runner-up at Wimbledon and the US Open in 1977). Nevertheless, Vilas was rated number one by &quot;World Tennis&quot;, &quot;France Presse&quot;, &quot;Tennis de France&quot;, &quot;Le Livre d&#x27;or du Tennis&quot;, Gene Scott, Peter Bodo, Christian Quidet, and Michael Sutter. The International Tennis Hall of Fame inscription for Vilas stated &quot;it was generally considered Vilas was the real No. 1 for 1977&quot;. Vilas was also rated number one by Bud Collins and John Barrett by the 2010s.

Argentine journalist Eduardo Puppo and Romanian mathematician Marian Ciulpan investigated the 1973–78 period records, and delivered a detailed report with more than 1,200 pages in which they came to the conclusion that Vilas should have been ranked No. 1 for five weeks in 1975 as well as during the first two weeks of 1976 and handed over their research to the ATP at the end of 2014. Although the study was not refuted, in May 2015 the ATP announced it had decided not to make official the No. 1 position for Vilas because it happened in the interval between the publications of the official rankings.

In October 2020, Netflix released a documentary about the controversy titled &quot;Guillermo Vilas: Settling the Score&quot;. It also covered (briefly) Evonne Goolagong&#x27;s recognition as world no. 1 (for two weeks in 1976) retroactively by the WTA in 2007.

In May 2024, ATP&#x27;s vice-president confirmed that Vilas will never be number one.

===Other controversies===
In 1983, the Men&#x27;s International Professional Tennis Council on June 7 suspended Vilas for one year and fined him $20,000, having found that his manager and coach, Ion Tiriac, on the player&#x27;s behalf, had accepted about $60,000 in appearance money from tournament promoters. Such payments were barred by the rules of the Grand Prix circuit.

In 2005, after living the life of an international playboy most of his life, Vilas settled down and married. He was 47 when he met Phiangphathu Khumueang, a 17-year-old from Thailand, and they married five years later.

===Retirement===
Vilas retired from the ATP Tour in 1989 but still played on the ATP Challenger Series until 1992. He was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1991. Vilas was in the stands at Flushing Meadows to cheer on his countryman, Juan Martín del Potro, who beat Roger Federer in an upset in the 2009 US Open final.

==Family==

Vilas married Phiangphathu Khumueang from Thailand in 2005. They have three daughters and one son. They reside in Monaco. He is reportedly suffering from a form of dementia.

<doc id="870663" wikidata="Q5324" url="?curid=870663" title="Pratihara dynasty">
<text>The Pratihara dynasty, also called the Gurjara-Pratiharas, the Pratiharas of Kannauj or the Imperial Pratiharas, was a prominent medieval Indian dynasty which ruled over the Kingdom of Kannauj. It initially ruled the Gurjaradesa until its victory in the Tripartite Struggle in 816 which secured its right to the throne of Kannauj. Cadet branches of the dynasty ruled other minor states in the subcontinent.

The Pratiharas were instrumental in containing Arab armies moving east of the Indus River. Nagabhata I defeated the Arab army under Junaid and Tamin in the Caliphate campaigns in India. Under Nagabhata II, the Pratiharas became the most powerful dynasty in northern India. He was succeeded by his son Ramabhadra, who ruled briefly before being succeeded by his son, Mihira Bhoja. Under Bhoja and his successor Mahendrapala I, the Pratihara dynasty reached its peak of prosperity and power. By the time of Mahendrapala, the extent of its territory rivalled that of the Gupta Empire stretching from the border of Sindh in the west to Bengal in the east and from the Himalayas in the north to areas past the Narmada in the south. The expansion triggered a tripartite power struggle with the Rashtrakuta and Pala empires for control of the Indian subcontinent. During this period, Imperial Pratihara took the title of &quot;Maharajadhiraja of Āryāvarta&quot; (&quot;Great King of Kings of Aryan Lands&quot;).

Pratihara are known for their sculptures, carved panels and open pavilion style temples. The greatest development of their style of temple building was at Khajuraho, now a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

The power of the Pratihara dynasty was weakened by dynastic strife. It was further diminished as a result of a great raid led by the Rashtrakuta ruler Indra III who, in about 916, sacked Kannauj. Under a succession of rather obscure rulers, the dynasty never regained its former influence. Their feudatories became more and more powerful, one by one throwing off their allegiance until, by the end of the tenth century, the dynasty controlled little more than the Gangetic Doab. Their last important king, Rajyapala, was driven from Kannauj by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1018.

== Etymology and origin ==
The origin of the dynasty and the meaning of the term &quot;Gurjara&quot; in its name is a topic of debate among historians. The rulers of this dynasty used the self-designation &quot;Pratihara&quot; for their clan, and never referred to themselves as Gurjaras. They claimed descent from the legendary hero Lakshmana, who is said to have acted as a &quot;pratihara&quot; (&quot;door-keeper&quot;) for his brother Rama. 

Multiple inscriptions of their neighbouring dynasties describe the Pratiharas as &quot;Gurjara&quot;. The term &quot;Gurjara-Pratihara&quot; occurs only in the Rajor inscription of a feudatory ruler named Mathanadeva, who describes himself as a &quot;Gurjara-Pratihara&quot;. According to one school of thought, Gurjara was the name of the territory (see Gurjara-desha) originally ruled by the Pratiharas; gradually, the term came to denote the people of this territory. An opposing theory is that Gurjara was the name of the tribe to which the dynasty belonged, and Pratihara was a clan of this tribe.

Among those who believe that the term Gurjara was originally a tribal designation, there are disagreements over whether they were native Indians or foreigners. The proponents of the foreign origin theory point out that the Pratihars suddenly emerged as a political power in north India around sixth century CE, shortly after the Hunas invasion of that region. According to them Gujara-Pratihara were &quot;likely&quot; formed from a fusion of the Alchon Huns (&quot;White Huns&quot;) and native Indian elements, and can probably be considered as a Hunnic state, although its precise origins remain unclear. Critics of the foreign origin theory argue that there is no conclusive evidence of their foreign origin: they were well-assimilated in the Indian culture. Moreover, if they invaded India through the north-west, it is inexplicable why would they choose to settle in the semi-arid area of present-day Rajasthan, rather than the fertile Indo-Gangetic Plain. While scholars such as R.K. Gupta and S.R Bakshi who have doubted the theory of foreign origin for Gurjaras have also opined that Gurjara-Pratiharas were among the first Rajput dynasties. 

The Agnivansha legend first recorded in the 11th century &quot;Navasahananka charita&quot; by Padmagupta narrates the official origin for the Parmara dynasty. This legend was later appropriated by other dynasties including Chaulukyas, eventually making its way into Prithviraj Raso.According to the legend, the Pratiharas, Parmar, Chauhan and Chaulukya dynasties originated from a sacrificial fire-pit (agnikunda) at Mount Abu. Some colonial-era historians interpreted this myth to suggest a foreign origin for these dynasties. According to this theory, the foreigners were admitted in the Hindu caste system after performing a fire ritual. However, this legend is not found in the earliest available copies of &quot;Prithviraj Raso&quot;. It is based on a Paramara legend composed when the threat of Muslim invasions was not considered serious by Rajput states of North West and Central India. This legend was utilised in the 16th century by bards to claim a heroic descent of clans in order to foster Rajput unity against the Mughals.

== History ==

The original centre of Pratihara power is a matter of controversy. R. C. Majumdar, on the basis of a verse in the Harivamsha-Purana, 783 CE, the interpretation of which he conceded was not free from difficulty, held that Vatsaraja ruled at Ujjain. Dasharatha Sharma, interpreting it differently located the original capital in the Bhinmala Jalor area. M. W. Meister and Shanta Rani Sharma concur with his conclusion since the writer of the Jaina narrative &quot;Kuvalayamala&quot; states that it was composed at Jalor in the time of Vatsaraja in 778 CE, which is five years before the composition of Harivamsha-Purana.

=== Early rulers ===
 Nagabhata I (739–760), was originally perhaps a feudatory of the Chavdas of Bhillamala. He gained prominence after the downfall of the Chavda kingdom in the course of resisting the invading forces led by the Arabs who controlled Sindh. Nagabhata Pratihara I (730–756) later extended his control east and south from Mandor, conquering Malwa as far as Gwalior and the port of Bharuch in Gujarat. He established his capital at Avanti in Malwa, and checked the expansion of the Arabs, who had established themselves in Sind. In this battle (738 CE), Nagabhata led a confederacy of Pratiharas to defeat the Muslim Arabs who had till then been pressing on victorious through West Asia and Iran. An inscription by Mihira Bhoja ascribes Nagabhata with having appeared like Vishnu &quot;in response to the prayers of the oppressed people to crush the large armies of the powerful Mleccha ruler, the destroyer of virtue&quot;. Nagabhata I was followed by two weak successors, his nephews Devraj and Kakkuka, who were in turn succeeded by Vatsraja (775–805).

=== Resistance to the Caliphate ===

In the Gwalior inscription, it is recorded that Pratihara emperor Nagabhata &quot;crushed the large army of the powerful Mlechcha king.&quot; This large army consisted of cavalry, infantry, siege artillery, and probably a force of camels. Since Tamin was a new governor he had a force of Syrian cavalry from Damascus, local Arab contingents, converted Hindus of Sindh, and foreign mercenaries like the Turkics. All together the invading army may have had anywhere between 10 and 15,000 cavalry, 5000 infantry, and 2000 camels.

The Arab chronicler Sulaiman describes the army of the Pratiharas as it stood in 851 CE, &quot;The ruler of Gurjara maintains numerous forces and no other Indian prince has so fine a cavalry. He is unfriendly to the Arabs, still he acknowledges that the king of the Arabs is the greatest of rulers. Among the princes of India there is no greater foe of the Islamic faith than he. He has got riches, and his camels and horses are numerous.&quot;

===Conquest of Kannauj and further expansion===

After bringing much of Rajasthan under his control, Vatsaraja embarked to become &quot;master of all the land lying between the two seas.&quot; Contemporary Jijasena&#x27;s &quot;Harivamsha Purana&quot; describes him as &quot;master of western quarter&quot;.

According to the Radhanpur Plate and Prithviraja Vijaya, Vatsaraja led an expedition against the Palas under Dharmapala of Bengal As such, the Palas came into conflict from time to time with the Imperial Pratiharas. According to the above inscription Dharmapala, was deprived of his two white Royal Umbrellas, and fled, followed by the Pratihara forces under general Durlabharaja Chauhan of Shakambhari. The Prithviraja Vijaya mentions Durlabhraj I as having &quot;washed his sword at the confluence of the river Ganga and the ocean, and savouring the land of the Gaudas&quot;. The Baroda Inscription (AD 812) states Nagabhata defeated the Dharmapala. Through vigorous campaigning, Vatsraj had extended his dominions to include a large part of northern India, from the Thar Desert in the west up to the frontiers of Bengal in the east.

The metropolis of Kannauj had suffered a power vacuum following the death of Harsha without an heir, which resulted in the disintegration of the Empire of Harsha. This space was eventually filled by Yashovarman around a century later but his position was dependent upon an alliance with Lalitaditya Muktapida. When Muktapida undermined Yashovarman, a tri-partite struggle for control of the city developed, involving the Pratiharas, whose territory was at that time to the west and north, the Palas of Bengal in the east and the Rashtrakutas, whose base lay at the south in the Deccan. Vatsaraja successfully challenged and defeated the Pala ruler Dharmapala and Dantidurga, the Rashtrakuta king, for control of Kannauj.

Around 786, the Rashtrakuta ruler Dhruva (c. 780–793) crossed the Narmada River into Malwa, and from there tried to capture Kannauj. Vatsraja was defeated by the Dhruva Dharavarsha of the Rashtrakuta dynasty around 800. Vatsaraja was succeeded by Nagabhata II (805–833), who was initially defeated by the Rashtrakuta ruler Govinda III (793–814), but later recovered Malwa from the Rashtrakutas, conquered Kannauj and the Indo-Gangetic Plain as far as Bihar from the Palas, and again checked the Muslims in the west. He rebuilt the great Shiva temple at Somnath in Gujarat, which had been demolished in an Arab raid from Sindh. Kannauj became the center of the Pratihara state, which covered much of northern India during the peak of their power, c. 836–910.

=== Mihira Bhoja ===


Mihira Bhoja first consolidated his territories by crushing the rebellious feudatories in Rajasthan, before turning his attention against the old enemies the Palas and Rastrakutas.

After consolidating his rule, he stepped into a war of succession for the throne of Gujarat between Dhruva II of the Gujarat Rashtrakuta dynasty and his younger brother. Bhoja led a cavalry raid into Gujarat against the Dhruva while supporting his Dhruva&#x27;s younger brother. Although the raid was repulsed by Dhruva II, Bhoja was able to retain dominion over parts of Gujarat and Malwa.

Bhoja&#x27;s feudatory, the‌ Guhilas Samanta named Harsha of Chatsu, is described as :
Besides being a conqueror, Bhoja was a great diplomat. The kingdoms which were conquered and acknowledged his suzerainty includes Travani, Valla, Mada, Arya, Gujaratra, Lata Parvarta and Chandelas of Bundelkhand. Bhoja&#x27;s Daulatpura-Dausa Inscription (AD 843), confirms his rule in Dausa region. Another inscription states that,&quot;Bhoja&#x27;s territories extended to the east of the Sutlej river.&quot; Kalhana&#x27;s Rajatarangini states that the territories of Bhoja extended to Kashmir in the north, and Bhoja had conquered Punjab by defeating ruling &#x27;Thakkiyaka&#x27; dynasty . After Devapala&#x27;s death, Bhoja defeated the Pala emperor Narayanapala and expanded his boundaries eastward into Pala-held territories near Gorakhpur.

In the early 8th century, Arabs fought on and off to take over Sindh. Imran ibn-Musa, who governed Sindh, tried to expand Arab rule to nearby areas. When Bhoja became powerful the Pratiharas fought back repulsed them from fort of Sindan, pushing the Arabs out of Kutch between 833 and 842 AD. Later on, the Arabs lost a best part of Sindh. This was the major conflict between the forces of Mihirbhoja and Imran ibn-musa 

Around 880, the Gurjara-Pratiharas were defeated in large battle in Ujjain by Krishna II, the Rastrakuta king of Gujarat. However, retribution likely soon followed on the part of the Pratiharas, as by the end of his reign, Bhoja had successfully exterminated the Gujarat Rashtrakuta line.

Hudud-ul-Alam, a tenth-century Persian geographic text, states that most of the kings of India acknowledged the supremacy of the powerful &#x27;Rai of Qinnauj&#x27;, (Kannauj was the capital of the Imperial Pratiharas) whose mighty army had 150,000 strong cavalry and 800 war elephants.

===Decline===
Bhoja II (910–912) was overthrown by Mahipala I (912–944). Several feudatories of the empire took advantage of the temporary weakness of the Pratiharas to declare their independence, notably the Paramaras of Malwa, the Chandelas of Bundelkhand, the Kalachuris of Mahakoshal, the Tomaras of Haryana, and the Chahamanas of Shakambhari. The south Indian Emperor Indra III (c. 914–928) of the Rashtrakuta dynasty briefly captured Kannauj in 916, and although the Pratiharas regained the city, their position continued to weaken in the tenth century, partly as a result of the drain of simultaneously fighting off Turkic attacks from the west, the attacks from the Rashtrakuta dynasty from the south and the Pala advances in the east. The Pratiharas lost control of Rajasthan to their feudatories, and the Chandelas captured the strategic fortress of Gwalior in central India around 950. By the end of the tenth century the Pratihara domains had dwindled to a small state centered on Kannauj.

Mahmud of Ghazni captured Kannauj in 1018, and the Pratihara ruler Rajapala fled. He was subsequently captured and killed by the Chandela ruler Vidyadhara. The Chandela ruler then placed Rajapala&#x27;s son Trilochanpala on the throne as a proxy. Jasapala, the last Pratihara ruler of Kannauj, died in 1036.

The Imperial Pratihara dynasty broke into several small states after the Ghaznavid invasions. These branches fought each other for territory and one of the branches ruled Mandore till the 14th century. This Pratihara branch had marital ties with Rao Chunda of the Rathore clan and gave Mandore in dowry to Chunda. This was specifically done to form an alliance against the Turks of the Tughlaq Empire.

==Pratihara art==
There are notable examples of architecture from the Pratihara era, including sculptures and carved panels. Their temples, constructed in an open pavilion style. One of the most notable Pratihara style of architecture was Khajuraho, built by their vassals, the Chandelas of Bundelkhand.

=== Māru-Gurjara architecture ===
Māru-Gurjara architecture was developed during Pratihara Empire.

* Mahavira Jain temple, Osian temple was constructed in 783 CE, making it the oldest surviving Jain temple in western India.
* Bateshwar Hindu temples, Madhya Pradesh was constructed during the Pratihara Empire between 8th to 11th century.
* Baroli temples complex are eight temples, built by the Pratiharas, is situated within a walled enclosure.

==Legacy==

Historians of India, since the days of Elphinstone, have wondered at the slow progress of Muslim invaders in India, as compared with their rapid advance in other parts of the world. The Arabs possibly only stationed small invasions independent of the Caliph. Arguments of doubtful validity have often been put forward to explain this unique phenomenon. Currently it is believed that it was the power of the Pratihara army that effectively barred the progress of the Muslims beyond the confines of Sindh, their first conquest for nearly three hundred years. In the light of later events this might be regarded as the &quot;Chief contribution of the Pratiharas to the history of India&quot;.

<text>Pressure Chief is the fifth studio album by American band Cake. It was released on October 5, 2004, pushed back from its original August release date. It was produced by the band and recorded in a converted house in Sacramento. The lead single, &quot;No Phone&quot; peaked at No. 13 on the U.S. Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart. The second single &quot;Carbon Monoxide&quot; garnered some airplay but failed to crack the Modern Rock Tracks top 40. The album was the band&#x27;s second and last record under Columbia Records.

The songs &quot;She&#x27;ll Hang the Baskets&quot; and &quot;Tougher Than It Is&quot; were both originally written for Cake&#x27;s 1998 record &quot;Prolonging the Magic&quot;. A bonus disc, &quot;Extra Value&quot;, was included in limited pre-orders of &quot;Pressure Chief&quot;.

On its opening week, &quot;Pressure Chief&quot; sold about 46,000 copies, debuting and peaking at number 17 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. However, it fell to No. 55 the following week. By the next month, the album had only sold 91,478 copies.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Pressure Chief&quot; was met with &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a weighted average rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, this release received an average score of 52 based on 8 reviews.

In a review for AllMusic, Johnny Loftus wrote: &quot;&quot;Pressure Chief&quot; marks Cake&#x27;s tenth year with a set of sardonic, engaging alternative pop that shows the Sacramento band&#x27;s economical sound unwilted after all these years.&quot; Matt Weir of &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; gave a three-and-a-half stars out of five, calling the release the &quot;weakest effort&quot; by the band.&quot;

<text>William Joseph Klem (born Klimm; February 22, 1874 – September 16, 1951), known as &quot;the Old Arbitrator&quot;, was an American baseball umpire who worked in Major League Baseball from 1905 to 1941, spending his entire career in the National League (NL). He worked 18 World Series, which is a major league record. Klem was posthumously inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Klem was born on February 22, 1874, in the &quot;Dutchtown&quot; area of Rochester, New York. He had changed the spelling of his last name from &quot;Klimm&quot; to &quot;Klem&quot; because he thought it had a better sound. Klem pursued a baseball career as a catcher until he sustained an arm injury. He then worked as a bartender and traveled through the Northeast building bridges. He decided to pursue umpiring after reading a newspaper article about major league umpire Silk O&#x27;Loughlin.

His umpiring career began in the Connecticut League in 1902. That year, Klem had a run-in with league secretary and team manager Jim O&#x27;Rourke after Klem ejected one of the manager&#x27;s players. O&#x27;Rourke threatened that Klem would not umpire another game in the league, but Klem responded, &quot;Maybe so, but I&#x27;ll umpire this one.&quot;

He worked in the New York State League the following year. Klem spent the 1904 season in the American Association before joining the NL in 1905.

===MLB career===
He worked a record 18 World Series: 1908, 1909, 1911, 1912, 1913, 1914, 1915, 1917, 1918, 1920, 1922, 1924, 1926, 1929, 1931, 1932, 1934 and 1940. No other umpire has worked in more than ten Series. Of the 16 major league teams in existence during his career, all but one—the St. Louis Browns, who would not win a pennant until 1944—appeared in a World Series that he officiated; the only other teams which did not win a championship with Klem on the field were the Brooklyn Dodgers, Philadelphia Phillies (neither of which won a title during Klem&#x27;s lifetime) and the Detroit Tigers. He was also one of the umpires for the first All-Star Game in 1933, and worked behind the plate for the second half of the game; he later umpired in the 1938 All-Star Game as well.

Klem holds the MLB record for most career ejections by an umpire with 279.

He called balls and strikes in five no-hitters, an NL record later tied by Harry Wendelstedt. He was also the home plate umpire on September 16, 1924, when Jim Bottomley of the St. Louis Cardinals had a record 12 runs batted in. Klem had a number of nicknames amongst the players: his favorite was &quot;the Old Arbitrator&quot;, but his jowly appearance also led to some players calling him &quot;Catfish&quot;. Klem despised the latter name, and was notorious for ejecting players whom he caught using it. One particular incident involved a player whom Klem ejected after he caught the player drawing a picture of a catfish with his foot in the infield dirt.
Klem also dismissed catcher Al López from a game after López pasted a newspaper clipping onto home plate which showed Klem clearly in error calling a play involving López. The catcher had covered the photo with dirt and waited for Klem to brush off home plate.

As Klem got older, he began to experience a skin condition that he said related to his nerves. He once commented on the toll that umpiring took on him, saying, &quot;Most baseball fans... feel that these verbal and physical public humiliations [umpires endure] go in one ear and out the other. Well, they don&#x27;t. They go in one ear and go straight to the nervous system, eating away coordination, self-confidence and self-respect.&quot; Late in his life, Klem stated in interviews that he had originated the use of hand signals for umpiring calls. It was difficult to challenge Klem at the time because so many years had passed. Recent research does not yield a clear answer to the origin of hand signals, with credit often going to umpire Cy Rigler.

By 1940, Klem had retired and had been replaced by future Hall of Fame umpire Al Barlick. At that time, Klem was appointed the NL&#x27;s chief of umpires. The league began experimenting with four-man umpire crews in 1941 and Klem appeared in a few games that season so that those games would have four umpires. Klem held the record for most MLB games umpired for over 70 years – at his retirement in 1941, he had umpired 5,375 games, the record until 2021 when it was surpassed by Joe West. He finished his career having umpired 5,375 regular season MLB games (all in the National League), 103 postseason games (all in World Series), and two MLB All-Star Games.

He had the longest career of any major league umpire (37 years) before Bruce Froemming tied that mark in 2007, and was also the oldest umpire in history at age 67 until Froemming surpassed that mark as well. Klem was widely respected for bringing dignity and professionalism to umpiring, as well as for his high skill and good judgment. Klem was also an innovative umpire: he was one of the first to wear a modern, somewhat pliable chest protector inside his shirt, a move which he successfully campaigned to have adopted throughout the NL, although Jocko Conlan and Beans Reardon used the outside protector. He was the first to straddle foul lines and stand to the catcher&#x27;s side for better perspective. Finally, he was the last umpire to work the plate exclusively (traditionally the crew chief always worked the plate; today umpire crews rotate base/plate assignments).

===Personal life===
Klem&#x27;s wife was named Marie. She often traveled with him to games that he worked. They had no children.

===Death and legacy===
Klem died on September 16, 1951, at age 77, at Doctors Hospital in Coral Gables, Florida. He died of a heart attack after suffering from heart problems for two to three years. He had been hospitalized for over a month when he died. About a week before his death, Klem seemed to know that his death was coming, commenting to his attorney, &quot;This is my last game and I&#x27;m going to strike out this time.&quot; His wife was his only survivor.

Klem and Tom Connolly were the first two umpires inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1953. They are also the only umpires to have worked in five different decades. In 1946 Klem and Connolly had also been named to the Honor Rolls of Baseball.

In 1962, the Houston chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America established the Bill Klem Award to honor outstanding NL umpires.

<doc id="870673" wikidata="Q3180071" url="?curid=870673" title="Joe Garagiola">
<text>Joseph Henry Garagiola Sr. (February 12, 1926 – March 23, 2016) was an American professional baseball catcher, later an announcer and television host.

Garagiola played nine seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the St. Louis Cardinals, Pittsburgh Pirates, Chicago Cubs, and New York Giants. He was later well known outside baseball for having been one of the regular panelists on &quot;The Today Show&quot; for many years and for his numerous appearances on game shows as a host and panelist.

==Early life==
Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Garagiola grew up on Elizabeth Avenue in an Italian-American neighborhood in the south of the city called the Hill, just across the street from Yogi Berra, his childhood friend and competitor, who was nine months older.

When Garagiola and Berra were teenagers in the early 1940s, almost all pro baseball scouts rated Garagiola as the better prospect. Still, it was Berra who went on to a Hall of Fame career, while Garagiola was a journeyman. About living across the street from Berra during their youth, Garagiola often quipped, &quot;Not only was I not the best catcher in the Major Leagues, I wasn&#x27;t even the best catcher on my street!&quot;

==Baseball career==

Garagiola was signed at age 16 by the St. Louis Cardinals organization. At age 17, he remains the youngest player in Columbus Red Birds history. Garagiola advanced to Columbus of the Class AA American Association in 1943 and was with them when he was drafted into military service on April 24, 1944. After undergoing basic training at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, Garagiola was sent to Fort Riley, Kansas, where he quickly established himself as the catcher for the Fort Riley Centaurs, with teammates Rex Barney and Pete Reiser.

Garagiola was sent to the Philippines in 1945, where he played ball for Kirby Higbe&#x27;s Manila Dodgers. He was discharged from service in early 1946 and was just 20 years old when he joined the Cardinals. Garagiola made his major league debut in .

As a rookie in 1946, in his only World Series appearance, Garagiola batted 6-for-19 in five games, including in Game 4, when he went 4-for-5 with three RBIs. On September 11, 1947, Joe Garagiola and Jackie Robinson were involved in an incident at home plate. Garagiola allegedly spiked Robinson&#x27;s foot in the second inning, and when Robinson came to the plate the next inning and made a comment to him, Garagiola reportedly responded with a racial slur. An argument ensued and umpire Beans Reardon held back Garagiola while Robinson responded with a mock clap.

Garagiola never quite lived up to the promise of his youth, appearing in only 676 games over nine seasons for four National League teams. He was a mediocre hitter (though certainly good for a catcher) in the majors, which featured in his self-deprecating humor. He once told this story himself: &quot;He knew that it was time to retire when he was catching, and his ex-teammate Stan Musial stepped into the batter&#x27;s box, turned to Joe, and said, &#x27;When are you gonna quit?&#x27;&quot;

Looking back at his career in 1970, Garagiola observed, &quot;It&#x27;s not a record, but being traded four times when there are only eight teams in the league tells you something. I thought I was modeling uniforms for the National League.&quot;

After his retirement from baseball, Garagiola lent his name to a 1960 book, &quot;Baseball Is a Funny Game&quot;, which sold well upon release and helped establish Garagiola as a &quot;personality.&quot; The book—largely ghostwritten—was a collection of humorous anecdotes surrounding his upbringing and his playing career, and it showcased the folksy, humorous style that became his trademark as a broadcaster.

Garagiola also wrote &quot;It&#x27;s Anybody&#x27;s Ballgame&quot; (1988) and &quot;Just Play Ball&quot; (2007).

=== Baseball broadcasting ===

Garagiola turned to broadcasting following his retirement as a player, first calling Cardinals radio broadcasts on KMOX from to .

As an announcer, Garagiola was best known for his almost 30-year association with NBC television. He began doing national baseball broadcasts for the network in (teaming with Bob Wolff). Garagiola called several World Series on NBC Radio in the 1960s, teaming with announcers including By Saam and George Kell. After Mel Allen was fired, Garagiola was added to the New York Yankees broadcast team, where he worked with lead announcer Phil Rizzuto from 1965 to 1967; in May 1967, he called Mickey Mantle&#x27;s 500th home run. Garagiola subsequently returned to broadcasting NBC baseball, and in May 1973, became the host of the pre-game show &quot;The Baseball World of Joe Garagiola;&quot; he then became a play-by-play announcer beginning in 1974.

Garagiola alternated play-by-play duties with Curt Gowdy on NBC until 1976, when he assumed the role full-time. He teamed with color commentator Tony Kubek from 1976 to 1982; in 1983, he shifted to color commentary as Vin Scully joined the network as lead play-by-play announcer. (Kubek joined Bob Costas to form NBC&#x27;s #2 baseball announcing duo in this era.) Besides working on the &quot;Saturday Game of the Week&quot; for NBC, the team of Scully and Garagiola called three All-Star Games (1983, 1985, and 1987), three National League Championship Series (1983, 1985, and 1987), and three World Series (1984, 1986, and 1988).

After calling one final World Series with Scully in 1988, Garagiola resigned from the network following a contract dispute. His slot on NBC&#x27;s baseball broadcasts was subsequently filled by Tom Seaver.

After leaving NBC Sports, Garagiola spent one season (1990) as a cable-television commentator for the California Angels. From 1998 to 2012, he performed part-time color commentary duties for the Arizona Diamondbacks, where his son Joe Jr. was general manager. Garagiola officially announced his retirement from broadcasting 

=== Other broadcasting ventures ===
Besides calling baseball games for NBC, Garagiola served as a co-host on &quot;Today&quot; from 1967 to 1973 and again from 1990 to 1992. He occasionally guest-hosted &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, including the only live appearances by members of The Beatles on the program while still a group, when John Lennon and Paul McCartney appeared in May 1968.

In the late 1960s and 1970s, Garagiola hosted the game shows &quot;He Said, She Said&quot;; &quot;Joe Garagiola&#x27;s Memory Game&quot;; &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;, as well as the short-lived &quot;Strike It Rich&quot;. Garagiola was a guest celebrity panelist on &quot;Match Game&quot; in the late 1970s. He hosted the St. Louis area professional wrestling show &quot;Wrestling at the Chase&quot; for three years from 1959 to 1962 (his brother, Mickey, was the wrestling show&#x27;s ring announcer) and was a regular host of the Orange Bowl Parade in Miami on New Year&#x27;s Eve. Garagiola achieved a new field of fame as co-host of the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show for USA Network from 1994 to 2002, remarking:

From 1969 to 1970, Garagiola was the Saturday afternoon host of the program &quot;Monitor&quot;. During the 1960s, he contributed commentaries to &quot;Monitor&quot; for several years and had a daily five-minute morning drive-time sports commentary program on the network.

From 1977 to 1983, his name was attached to the PGA Tour&#x27;s Tucson Open tournament, broadcast by NBC.

One of Garagiola&#x27;s first appearances on TV was in 1960, when he appeared onstage at a campaign event for John F. Kennedy. Surrounded by politicians including former President Harry S. Truman, Garagiola put his arm around the former president and, knowing that his father who had often questioned his son&#x27;s career choices would be watching the event on television, looked into the camera and said, &quot;Hey Pop, I just want you to see who I&#x27;m hanging around with.&quot;

=== Testimony at Curt Flood trial ===
In 1970, Garagiola appeared at a preliminary trial following former Cardinals outfielder Curt Flood&#x27;s lawsuit against Major League Baseball, challenging the game&#x27;s reserve clause. Testifying before Judge Irving Ben Cooper in New York, Garagiola defended the clause, a stance he later deemed a &quot;terrible mistake.&quot;

=== Politics ===

In the 1976 presidential election, Garagiola enthusiastically supported the candidacy of President Gerald Ford. During the fall campaign, the Republican National Committee hired Garagiola to do a series of television ads with Ford, with Garagiola talking to Ford in a relaxed, informal setting. Derided by Ford&#x27;s critics as &quot;The Joe and Jerry Show&quot;, the ads in their opinion were considered to have negatively affected the Ford campaign.

The two men became close friends, and on election night in November 1976 Ford invited Garagiola to be one of his guests at the White House to watch the results on television. Ford lost to Democrat Jimmy Carter, the former governor of Georgia.

=== Advocacy against chewing tobacco ===
Garagiola was an advocate against the use of chewing tobacco. He had picked up the habit during his playing days with the Cardinals, but quit cold turkey in the late-1950s. He annually visited major league teams during spring training with players from his generation who have suffered from oral cancer related to the addiction, and he always made comments about it on broadcasts whenever the camera would be on a player chewing tobacco.

=== Society for American Baseball Research ===
Garagiola was the keynote luncheon speaker at the 2007 convention of the Society for American Baseball Research held in St. Louis.

== Honors ==
Garagiola was inducted into the Missouri Sports Hall of Fame in 1970. He was presented with a Peabody Award in 1973 for his NBC work. In , he was honored by the Baseball Hall of Fame with the Ford C. Frick Award for outstanding broadcasting accomplishments. He was inducted into the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association Hall of Fame in 2004. He has also been given his own star on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. The St. Louis Wrestling Hall of Fame inducted him in 2008 for his &quot;Wrestling at the Chase&quot; broadcasts. In 2012, he was honored by the Catholic Community Foundation of the Diocese of Phoenix, receiving its inaugural Legacy Award at its 24th Annual Crosier Gala for his tireless help and generosity with the St. Peter&#x27;s Mission School on the Gila River Reservation. (The American Sportscasters Association also honored him for his work with the St. Peter&#x27;s Mission School with its Humanitarian Award in 1995.)

On December 4, 2013, Garagiola was named as the recipient of the Buck O&#x27;Neil Lifetime Achievement Award, presented once every three years by the Baseball Hall of Fame for positive contributions to Major League Baseball. The Hall&#x27;s official announcement specifically cited his advocacy against smokeless tobacco, as well as his role as a founder of the Baseball Assistance Team, a charity that provides grants to needy members of the professional baseball community.

In the 2013 film &quot;42&quot;, Garagiola was portrayed by actor Gino Anthony Pesi.

In the 1990s, Garagiola began working with the St. Peter&#x27;s Indian Mission Catholic School, a poorly-funded educational facility on the Gila River Indian Reservation, south of Phoenix. During his many years of charity work with the school he helped facilitate the repair or construction of an all-purpose facility, a basketball court, a soccer and track field, a library and computer learning center and extensive repairs on the old mission
church.

For his work, he was honored by tribal leaders with the nickname &quot;Awesome Fox&quot; and today his name can be seen on The Joe Garagiola Learning Center and Awesome Fox Field at the mission school.

== Personal life ==
Garagiola married Audrie Ross, the organist at the Cardinals&#x27; ballpark in St. Louis, in 1949; their two sons later had an association with baseball. Joe Jr., was the general manager for the Arizona Diamondbacks, and later senior vice president of baseball operations for Major League Baseball. His other son Steve is a retired broadcast journalist as well, serving as a reporter and anchor for WDIV-TV, the NBC affiliate in Detroit. His daughter, Gina, has also worked in TV news, as a field reporter for Phoenix television station KTVK, and is now a freelance writer. Garagiola Sr. had eight grandchildren. One of those grandchildren, Chris, was named the radio play-by-play announcer for the Diamondbacks in December 2023.

== Death ==
Garagiola died on March 23, 2016, at age 90, in Scottsdale, Arizona. The Diamondbacks wore a patch in his memory on their right sleeve for the 2016 season, a black circle with &quot;JOE&quot; written in white in the center, with a catchers&#x27; mask replacing the O.

Garagiola&#x27;s funeral mass was held on April 13 in St. Louis at St. Ambrose Catholic Church, the same church where he was baptized. He was interred at Resurrection Cemetery in St. Louis.

<text>Samuel James Cassell Sr. (born November 18, 1969) is an American professional basketball coach and former point guard who serves as an assistant coach for the Boston Celtics of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Drafted 24th overall in the 1993 NBA draft out of Florida State, Cassell played for eight different teams during his 15-year career. He was selected to the NBA All-Star Game and All-NBA Team once, both in the 2003–04 season.

In his first two seasons, he helped the Houston Rockets win back to back championships, in 1994 and 1995, and won a third with the Boston Celtics in 2008, his last season. He also helped the Milwaukee Bucks and Minnesota Timberwolves reach the Conference Finals of the playoffs in 2001 and 2004 respectively, the latter&#x27;s first-ever in franchise history, and helped the Los Angeles Clippers to their first-ever playoff series victory in 2006. Known for his mid-range jumpshot, Cassell often made clutch baskets late in the fourth quarter to help his team win games.

==College career==
After graduating from Paul Laurence Dunbar Community High School in East Baltimore, Maryland, Cassell spent a year at Maine Central Institute in Pittsfield, Maine, under coach Max Good. From MCI, Cassell was successfully recruited to attend DePaul University. He was declared academically ineligible based on National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA)&#x27;s Proposition 48 standards, and ended up starting his college career at San Jacinto College in Pasadena, Texas, where he was known as a big scorer. He moved on to Florida State University in Tallahassee for his junior and senior years. In his senior year in 1992–93, he averaged 18.3 points, 4.9 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game and led the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) in steals. Cassell and teammate Bob Sura formed the highest scoring and rebounding backcourt in the nation with 38.2 points and 10.4 rebounds per game. Cassell&#x27;s 1992–93 Seminoles team finished with a 25–10 record and advanced to the Elite Eight in the NCAA Tournament, where they lost to the University of Kentucky&#x27;s Wildcats.

On February 14, 2008, in a game against Wake Forest, Cassell&#x27;s jersey was retired by Florida State.

==Playing career==

===Houston Rockets (1993–1996)===
Cassell was selected out of Florida State University with the 24th overall pick of the 1993 NBA draft by the Houston Rockets. Playing mostly as a backup to Kenny Smith, Cassell developed a reputation as &quot;clutch&quot; and was usually on the court for the fourth quarter of close games. He was a key contributor during the Rockets playoff run his rookie year, notably dropping 22 points and seven assists in a Game 7 win against the Phoenix Suns in the Western Conference Semifinals, and scoring 7 points in the final 32 seconds of a 93–89 win in game 3 of the 1994 NBA Finals against the New York Knicks. The Rockets would win the championship in seven games.

Cassell saw an increase in his role during his second year, appearing in all 82 games that season. He again helped the Rockets reach the NBA Finals for the second consecutive year. In game 2 of the Finals against the Orlando Magic, Cassell scored 31 points. The Rockets swept the Magic, giving Cassell his second championship in just two years in the league.

In his third season, the two-time defending champion Rockets were swept out of the second round of the playoffs by the Seattle SuperSonics. Cassell&#x27;s minutes, scoring and usage rates all increased in his third season, but he missed 21 games with injuries. Rockets management feared their window of winning another championship with Olajuwon, Drexler and Smith was closing, and looked to trade for another star-caliber player.

===Phoenix Suns (1996)===
After the 1995–96 season, he was traded to the Phoenix Suns, along with Robert Horry, Chucky Brown, and Mark Bryant, in exchange for former league MVP Charles Barkley. Cassell, who was in the final year of his rookie contract, frequently clashed with head coach Cotton Fitzsimmons; Fitzsimmons subsequently resigned following an 0–8 start. On December 12, 1996, Cassell led the 5–14 Suns into Utah and defeated the Jazz who at the time were on a 15-game winning streak. Cassell scored 21 points in the 95–87 road win. Under new head coach Danny Ainge, the Suns saw marked improvement with Cassell leading the team with 14.8 points per game.

===Dallas Mavericks (1996–97)===
On December 27, 1996, just 22 games into the season, he was traded along with Michael Finley, A.C. Green, and a second-round draft pick to the Dallas Mavericks in exchange for Jason Kidd, Tony Dumas, and Loren Meyer. Though Cassell had begun to develop chemistry with the Suns and Coach Ainge, team management felt they could not pass up the opportunity to trade for Kidd.

===New Jersey Nets (1997–1999)===
Midway through the 1996–97 season, after appearing in 16 games for the Mavericks, he was traded with Chris Gatling, Jim Jackson, George McCloud, and Eric Montross to the New Jersey Nets in exchange for Shawn Bradley, Ed O&#x27;Bannon, Robert Pack, and Khalid Reeves on February 17, 1997. The Nets would be the third team that Cassell played for just that season. During his time with the Nets, Cassell lived in Teaneck, New Jersey.

Following the season, though he considered an offer to return to Houston, Cassell elected to re-sign with the Nets on a six-year contract. Forming one of the league&#x27;s most potent backcourts with Kerry Kittles, Cassell averaged 19.6 points, 8 assists and 1.6 steals in 34 minutes per game for the Nets that year, and helped lead them to the playoffs for their first time in four years. However, they were swept by Michael Jordan and the Bulls in the first round.

Led by coach John Calipari, who pushed the team to trade for then re-sign Cassell, the Nets were favorites in the Eastern conference entering the lockout-shortened 1998–99 season. However, Cassell sustained an injury in the first game of the season and the Nets started 3–15.

===Milwaukee Bucks (1999–2003)===
On March 11, 1999, Cassell was again traded in a three team, eight player trade that sent Stephon Marbury to the Nets, Terrell Brandon to Minnesota Timberwolves, and Cassell to the Milwaukee Bucks. Under their new coach George Karl, Cassell formed a &quot;Big 3&quot; with Ray Allen and Glenn Robinson. In the first game of the following season, on November 2, 1999, Cassell led all scorers with 35 points alongside 11 assists in a 98–93 victory against the Houston Rockets. On November 26, Cassell again led all scorers with 28 points, with 14 assists, this time in a 114–112 win over the Boston Celtics.

On March 3, 2001, he scored his career-high of 40 points against the Chicago Bulls. During All-Star Weekend in 2001, he won the Fleer Shootout at Jam Session on All-Star Saturday. That season, after defeating the Orlando Magic and Charlotte Hornets in the first two rounds of the playoffs, he almost reached the Finals with the Bucks, falling just short when they lost in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals against the Philadelphia 76ers.

During the 2002–03 season, he passed 10,000 points for his career. On December 9, 2002, in one of the best games of his career, Cassell recorded a triple double with 39 points, 10 rebounds, and 10 assists in a double overtime 140–133 victory against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

On March 28, 2008, Cassell was honored as one of the 20 greatest players in Milwaukee Bucks history during the team&#x27;s 40th Anniversary Celebration.

===Minnesota Timberwolves (2003–2005)===
After spending four seasons with the Bucks, he was traded along with Ervin Johnson to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for Joe Smith and Anthony Peeler following the 2003 NBA draft. Cassell enjoyed his most successful season as an individual that year. He posted 19.8 points on 49% shooting, 7.3 assists and 1.3 steals in 35 minutes per game on the year. He was named to the All-NBA Second Team and voted into the 2004 NBA All-Star Game. Cassell, Latrell Sprewell and Kevin Garnett formed what was widely considered the best trio in the NBA that season, vaulting past Western Conference powerhouses the Sacramento Kings, Dallas Mavericks, San Antonio Spurs and Los Angeles Lakers for the number one seed in the Western Conference, with a franchise-best 58–24 record.

Cassell made his playoff debut with the Timberwolves scoring a franchise playoff record 40 points, in a first-round game 1 win against the Denver Nuggets. Minnesota would win the series in five games. They faced the Sacramento Kings in the next round, with Cassell again dropping 40 points in the series opener. A series of late-game heroics from Cassell helped the Timberwolves defeat the Kings in seven games. Cassell however sustained a back injury that limited him in the Western Conference Finals against the Lakers, which the Lakers would win in six games.

The following year, the Timberwolves finished 44–38, missing the playoffs by one game in the competitive Western Conference. Cassell, who appeared in only 59 games that season due to injuries, voiced his frustration over the midseason firing of Flip Saunders and not being offered a contract extension.

===Los Angeles Clippers (2005–2008)===

After the 2004–05 season, the Timberwolves traded Cassell and a conditional first-round pick to the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Marko Jarić and Lionel Chalmers. The trade is widely considered among the NBA&#x27;s most lopsided ever; Chalmers never played another game in the NBA, and Jaric was traded after three unproductive yet overpaid seasons. Cassell meanwhile led the Clippers to their then-most successful season, and the draft pick from Minnesota was used by the Clippers as part of the Chris Paul trade. The Timberwolves would not qualify for the postseason again until 2018.

Cassell appeared to have found a home with the Clippers, as he helped lead them back to the playoffs for the first time since 1997, with their best record in team history at 47–35. Since the team moved to California in 1978, they had compiled just three winning seasons. In the first round, they beat the Denver Nuggets in five games, but would fall to the Phoenix Suns in seven games in the Conference Semifinals. Between their move to California in 1978 and Chris Paul&#x27;s arrival in 2011, this would be the only year that the Clippers won a playoff series.

Before the 2006–07 season, Cassell was reportedly offered a two-year, $15 million offer from the Atlanta Hawks, but eventually re-signed with the Clippers on a two-year, $13 million deal. Cassell struggled with injuries that season, and the Clippers missed the playoffs by two games.

With Elton Brand, Shaun Livingston, Chris Kaman and others suffering major injuries, the Clippers started rebuilding throughout the 2007–08 season. Although Cassell was initially reluctant to discuss leaving the Clippers, he eventually decided to listen to their buyout offers. On February 28, 2008, the Clippers reached a contractual buyout agreement with Cassell and placed him on waivers. According to the agreement, Cassell received half of his remaining salary, roughly $850,000.

===Boston Celtics (2008–2009)===

Cassell became an unrestricted free agent on March 3, 2008, when he cleared waivers, and was eligible to sign with a team of his choice. Although the Dallas Mavericks, Denver Nuggets and Phoenix Suns were interested in his services, he was strongly linked with a poised move to the Boston Celtics and was expected to be in Boston once he cleared waivers. On March 1, 2008, Cassell&#x27;s agent, David Falk, confirmed that Cassell would sign a contract with the Celtics for the remainder of the season if he cleared waivers, receiving a prorated amount of the veteran minimum of $1.2M. Cassell said that he would wear either No. 28 or No. 91 on his jersey, and eventually chose No. 28.

According to his agent, Cassell had signed a contract with the Celtics on March 3, 2008, but the signing was pending an official league announcement. His arrival was delayed because of a death in his family. On March 4, 2008, Cassell officially signed with the Celtics, but immediately flew back to his hometown of Baltimore to attend funeral services for his deceased family member. He made his debut against the Philadelphia 76ers on March 10, 2008. In Boston, Cassell was reunited with former teammates Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen.

On March 17, 2008, Cassell had a standout performance in a Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day matchup against the San Antonio Spurs, when he led the team from a 22-point deficit to a 2-point victory, scoring 17 points and hitting a clutch shot late in the game.

Cassell, along with Eddie House, James Posey, P.J. Brown, and Leon Powe, gave the Celtics arguably the best bench in the NBA that season. They helped the Celtics finish with an NBA-best 66–16 record en route to the NBA Finals. The Celtics defeated the Lakers 4–2, with the Celtics bench out-scoring the Lakers&#x27; in five of the six games. The win gave Cassell his third championship, which would also be the last game he played.

During the 2008–09 season, Cassell served as an unofficial assistant to head coach Doc Rivers; though he did not play in any games, he was still officially listed as an active player. On February 17, 2009, Cassell was traded to the Sacramento Kings for a conditional second-round draft pick in the 2015 NBA Draft. The move was done strictly for salary cap purposes and Cassell was not expected to play for the Kings. One day later, Sacramento waived him.

Cassell cleared waivers and was eligible to re-sign with Boston or another contender, but opted to sit out the remainder of the season, and he announced his retirement in May 2009. In 2015, Paul Pierce stated that he felt he, Garnett and Cassell were the real &quot;Big 3&quot; of the Celtics 2008 championship team.

==Coaching career==

=== Washington Wizards (2009–2014) ===

On May 21, 2009, Cassell was named assistant coach of the Washington Wizards, joining Flip Saunders who was his coach in Minnesota. John Wall, who was drafted first overall by the Wizards in 2010, credits Cassell for his development into one of the NBA&#x27;s premier point guards and leadership during the team&#x27;s Eastern Conference semi-finals appearance in 2014 – their first playoff series win since 2005. During the 2014 offseason, Cassell&#x27;s former teammate Paul Pierce signed with the Wizards, and admitted he made the decision to sign with Washington after speaking with Cassell.

=== Los Angeles Clippers (2014–2020) ===
After five seasons with the Wizards, Cassell was hired by the Los Angeles Clippers on September 29, 2014, to join Doc Rivers&#x27; staff as assistant coach.

=== Philadelphia 76ers (2020–2023) ===
On November 9, 2020, the Philadelphia 76ers hired Cassell as an assistant coach under Doc Rivers.

=== Boston Celtics (2023–present) ===
On June 4, 2023, the Boston Celtics hired Cassell as an assistant coach under Joe Mazzulla. Cassell won his fourth NBA championship when the Celtics defeated the Dallas Mavericks in 5 games in the 2024 NBA Finals. It was Cassell&#x27;s first championship as a coach.

==Media==
Cassell appeared on TNT&#x27;s &quot;NBA Fundamentals&quot; series, in which basketball players describe certain aspects of the game. He was chosen to illustrate the &quot;mid-range game&quot;, i.e. shooting from the area around the free throw line, the paint, the wings and the baseline. In this clip, Cassell explains how to post up against opposing guards, shoot pull-up jump shots and hit buzzer beaters. He admires retired NBA players Terrell Brandon and Jeff Hornacek, two prolific mid-range shooters after whom he modeled his game.

==Personal life==
His son, Sam Cassell Jr., played for Iona College. Cassell Jr. also played for and earned his associate&#x27;s and bachelor&#x27;s degrees from Chipola College and the University of Connecticut respectively. In 2017, Cassell Jr. was signed on the Summer League squad for Cleveland Cavaliers.

<text>Robert Joe Cox (born May 21, 1941) is an American former professional baseball third baseman and manager in Major League Baseball (MLB). Cox played for the New York Yankees and managed the Atlanta Braves and Toronto Blue Jays. He is a member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame. He recorded a 100-win season six times, a record matched only by Joe McCarthy.

Cox first managed the Braves from 1978 to 1981, and then managed the Blue Jays from 1982 to 1985. He rejoined the Braves in 1986 as a general manager. He moved back to the manager&#x27;s role during the 1990 season and stayed there until his retirement following the 2010 season. Cox led the Atlanta Braves to the World Series championship in . The Braves have since retired No. 6 in his honor. Cox holds the all-time record for ejections in MLB with 158 (plus an additional three post-season ejections), a record previously held by John McGraw. He also leads the league in playoff appearances as manager with sixteen, and he was the first since Casey Stengel to have qualified for the postseason ten times (four managers have since followed him). He became the first manager to exceed three consecutive appearances in the League Championship Series, doing so by qualifying for the National League Championship Series from 1991 to 1999 (excluding 1994, which had no NLCS).

==Playing career==
As a player, Cox originally signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers, but was never able to make the Dodgers&#x27; major league team. Eventually he was acquired by the Braves, but never appeared in an MLB game for them either. Instead, he was traded to the New York Yankees on December 7, 1967. Cox played two seasons, mostly at third base, for the Yankees.

==Managerial career==
===Prior to managing===
Prior to managing in the States, Cox played from 1967 to 1970 for the Cardenales de Lara and Leones del Caracas clubs of the Venezuelan Winter League. He later managed the Cardenales during three consecutive seasons from 1974–75 through 1976–77. In between, he coached and managed in the Yankees minor league system.

===New York Yankees farm system===
Cox began his managerial career in the Yankees farm system in 1971. In 1976, he led the Syracuse Chiefs to the International League&#x27;s Governors&#x27; Cup title. This team featured such future major leaguers as Ron Guidry, Mickey Klutts, Terry Whitfield and Juan Bernhardt. Overall, Cox had a highly successful six-year tenure as a minor league manager, compiling a record of 459 wins and 387 defeats (.543) with two league championships. He then spent the 1977 season as the first base coach on Billy Martin&#x27;s staff with the World Series–winning Yankees before beginning his MLB managerial career.

===Atlanta Braves (1978–1981)===
Cox replaced Dave Bristol as the manager of the Atlanta Braves prior to the 1978 season, inheriting a team that had finished last in the National League West during the previous two seasons and, in 1977, compiled a worse record than the first-year Seattle Mariners of the American League. Building from the ground up, the Braves finished last in both 1978 and 1979. Entering 1980, Cox made one of the unusual moves for which he is known, moving power-hitting first baseman–catcher Dale Murphy, who had developed a throwing block as a catcher that hindered his ability to play, to center field. Murphy later won two National League Most Valuable Player Awards and five Gold Gloves, and became one of the premier players of the 1980s. In 1980, the Braves finished fourth with their first record above .500 since 1974. However, Cox was undone by the 1981 baseball strike when the Braves finished fourth in the first half and fifth in the second. After the season, owner Ted Turner fired him. Asked at a press conference who was on his short list for manager, Turner replied, &quot;It would be Bobby Cox if I hadn&#x27;t just fired him. We need someone like him around here.&quot; The Braves won the National League West division title in 1982 and finished second in both 1983 and 1984 under Cox&#x27;s successor Joe Torre. Cox finished with a record of 266 wins and 323 losses in the regular season.

===Toronto Blue Jays (1982–1985)===
Cox joined the Toronto Blue Jays in 1982, who steadily improved over the four years of his management. Cito Gaston was brought in as a coach for the team because of Cox, and Gaston would be named manager of the Jays years later. In 1985, Cox&#x27;s fourth season with the club, the Blue Jays finished in first place in the American League East. That season, the American League Championship Series was expanded to a best-of-seven format after 16 seasons of a best-of-five format. This change ultimately made the difference when Cox&#x27;s Blue Jays became only the fifth team to lose a playoff series after leading three games to one to the Kansas City Royals, with the decision by Dick Howser to counter Cox&#x27;s platooning by starting a right-handed pitcher before going with left-handed relievers in the middle innings proving key. 

After the 1985 season, the Braves asked for permission to ask him about their general manager position, which Toronto allowed despite nearly signing Cox for the next season. While he didn&#x27;t think he would be going, he ultimately came to accept their idea. On October 22, 1985, Cox left to return to Atlanta as a general manager; he stated that a key reason was his family, who had continued to live in Marietta, Georgia. Cox and incoming manager Chuck Tanner both received five-year contracts from Turner. Cox finished his stint as Jays manager with a record of 355 wins and 292 losses for his regular season record. Cox was replaced in Toronto by Jimy Williams.

===Second stint with the Atlanta Braves (1986–2010)===
====General manager====
After going through two managers over the course of less than five years with disastrous results in attendance and performance, Cox fired Russ Nixon in June 1990 and named himself field manager. Cox had spent the prior four seasons accumulating talented players, including Tom Glavine, Steve Avery, John Smoltz, Ron Gant, and David Justice. He was also responsible for drafting Chipper Jones with the first overall pick in the 1990 draft. After the 1990 season, he handed the general manager&#x27;s post to Kansas City Royals general manager John Schuerholz.

====1991====
In 1991, the Braves, along with the Minnesota Twins, became the first teams to go from last place to first place from one year to the next. The two teams met in the 1991 World Series, which the Twins won in seven games. It was the second World Series in which the home team won every game. The first was in 1987 when the Twins defeated the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games.

====1992–1993====
In 1992, Cox&#x27;s Braves held a 3–1 lead in the National League Championship Series against the Pittsburgh Pirates before losing Games 5 and 6, although they did win Game 7 on Francisco Cabrera&#x27;s ninth-inning, two-out, pinch-hit, two-run single. They went on to lose the World Series to the Blue Jays, his former club. In 1993, the Braves had the best record in baseball after a pennant race where they overcame a 10-game deficit in August to beat the San Francisco Giants. By going 51–17 over the last two and a half months of the season, they won the division by a game. However, they lost the National League Championship Series in six games to the Philadelphia Phillies.

====1995–96====
In 1995, the Atlanta Braves won Cox&#x27;s only World Series championship as a manager, over the Cleveland Indians. Their division title in 1995 marked the first time since 1989 that neither Pennsylvania team won the National League East.

In May 1995, Cox was arrested on simple battery charge after his wife called police and alleged Cox struck her. She retracted the statement the following day, and the charges were dropped after the couple attended court-ordered counseling.

In 1996, the Braves again won the division title. After sweeping the Los Angeles Dodgers in the division series, the Braves&#x27; pitching fell behind the St. Louis Cardinals, three games to one in the 1996. Facing elimination, the Braves offense outscored the Cardinals 33–1 over the final three games and won the pennant. Cox became the only manager in history to lose a series leading three games to one and win a series trailing three games to one. The scoring continued into the first two games against the New York Yankees as the Braves took a two games to none lead by winning with scores of 12–1 and 4–0 in the World Series. In game four, the Braves led 6–0 in the fourth inning, but the Yankees came from behind. Jim Leyritz homered to tie the game, and the Yankees tied the series with a win in 11 innings, 8–6. The Yankees would ultimately win in six games. Cox was ejected in Game 6; he was the most recent person to be ejected in a World Series game until Dave Martinez in 2019 in Game 6 against the Houston Astros.

====1997–2001====
The Braves lost to the Florida Marlins in the 1997 NLCS and the San Diego Padres in the 1998 NLCS. The Braves made it back to the World Series in 1999, but lost to the defending World Series Champion New York Yankees in four straight games. Cox&#x27;s 2001 team won the division title and upset the favored Houston Astros in three straight games in the division series. However, the Arizona Diamondbacks defeated the Braves in five games in the NLCS.

One of Cox&#x27;s memorable games as manager of the Braves during this period came on September 21, 2001, when they played rival New York Mets in the first major professional sporting event played in New York City since the 9/11 attacks.

In 2001, he tied a record held by John McGraw, Bill Dahlen and Paul Richards by being ejected from eleven games in a single season.

====2002–2010====
Cox&#x27;s Braves did not advance past the first round of the playoffs in any of their last five appearances. In 2002, the Braves won 101 games and led the wild card San Francisco Giants 2 games to 1 before dropping the last two. In 2003, the Braves pushed the Chicago Cubs to the fifth game before falling. The following year, the Braves lost in the best-of-five Division Series for the third straight year. In 2005, the Braves lost to the Houston Astros, with the finale taking 18 innings to decide in the 2005 NLDS. On September 23, 2009, Cox signed a one-year contract extension through 2010, and on the same day announced that 2010 would be his final year as manager. He also announced that he agreed to stay on as an advisor for team baseball operations for the next five years after he retires. On October 2, 2010, the Atlanta Braves honored Bobby Cox at Turner Field in a sold-out game. On October 3, 2010, Cox led the Braves to an 8–7 win over the Phillies and clinched both his and the Braves&#x27; first wild card. His final game was on October 11, 2010, when the Braves were eliminated by the San Francisco Giants in Game 4 of the National League Division Series. He was given a standing ovation by the crowd and both teams immediately following the game. He finished with a record of 1,883 wins and 1,386 losses in the regular season and 64 wins and 65 losses in the post-season. His record from both stints as manager is 2,149 wins and 1,709 losses for a .557 winning percentage in 3,858 games. His overall managerial record is 2,504 wins and 2,001 losses in the regular season and 67 wins and 69 losses in the post-season.

===Managerial record===
==Personal life==
Bobby Cox is married to Pamela and has eight children. In 1995, Cox was arrested on simple assault charges against his wife.

One day after participating in the Braves&#x27; home opening day (April 1, 2019) festivities Cox was hospitalized after suffering a stroke. Five months after his stroke, Cox made a visit to SunTrust Park on September 2, 2019, to watch the Braves play the Toronto Blue Jays, a game which the Braves won 6–3. As a result of the stroke Cox suffers from paralysis in his right arm which requires it to be in a sling. The stroke did not cause cognitive impairment, as Cox follows and retains interest in baseball, receiving regular visits with long-time baseball colleagues such as Braves manager Brian Snitker, but caused some difficulties communicating. He was diagnosed with congestive heart failure in 2020. Cox attended the July 6, 2024 Atlanta Braves game versus the visiting, division-leading Philadelphia Phillies; his first in-person attendance at a Braves game since 2019. Cox visited the home clubhouse, met with Braves players, and took a group photo. He was shown on the videoboard before the fourth inning to a standing ovation from the sellout, 41,006 Truist Park crowd.

==Accomplishments==

Cox has been named Manager of the Year four times (1985, 1991, 2004, 2005) and is one of only four managers to have won the award in both the American and National League. He and Kevin Cash are the only managers to have won the award in consecutive years. Cox has also been named Manager of the Year by &quot;The Sporting News&quot; eight times (1985, 1991, 1993, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2004, and 2005).

On May 12, 2007, Cox passed Sparky Anderson to become the fourth-winningest manager in major league history, with a record of 2,195 wins and 1,698 losses. He led the Braves to a division title every season from 1991 to 2005, excluding the strike-shortened 1994 season; the Braves have competed in the National League East since 1994 and competed in the National League West prior to that. He won a World Series Championship in 1995. In 2001, he took sole possession of first place for most wins as a manager in Braves history. Cox&#x27;s .561 winning percentage is fourteenth in all-time among managers with at least 1,000 games managed, and is the second highest among those who managed the majority of their career after the creation of divisions within each league in 1969. On June 8, 2009, Cox won his 2,000th game with the Atlanta Braves, becoming only the fourth manager in Major League history to accomplish that feat with one team. Cox reached career win number 2,500 on September 25, 2010, becoming only the fourth manager in Major League history to do so.
On September 17, 2010, Cox was ejected for the 158th time in his Major League coaching career during the second inning of a Braves game against the New York Mets; he currently holds the all-time record for most ejections (set on August 14, 2007, with his 132nd), previously held by John McGraw. By a strange twist of fate, his first ejection happened while managing of the Braves in a game against the Mets on May 1, 1978. Unlike McGraw, Cox did not have a reputation for having a fiery temper and Cox generally only got ejected to prevent his players from being ejected. In the 156 games from which Cox was ejected, his teams had a winning percentage of .385. In a July 2006 game, Cox was unable to save outfielder Jeff Francoeur from ejection; speaking with &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; beat writer David O&#x27;Brien, Francoeur recounted his manager&#x27;s advice after both men had been sent to the Braves clubhouse:
:&quot;I’m like, ‘What do I do?’ He said, ‘Go have a couple cold beers and get in the cold tub or something and relax. And then you’ll probably have to write a $500 check. Or you can do what I do, write a $10,000 one and tell them when it runs out, let me know&#x27;.&quot;

Cox is also the only person among all players and managers to be ejected from two World Series games ( and ). He was ejected in the ninth inning of Game 3 of the 1992 World Series for throwing a batting helmet onto the field at the SkyDome. Cox was trying to slam the helmet against the lip of the dugout and missed, throwing it onto the field. Cox was tossed again in the final game of the 1996 World Series after protesting an out call of Marquis Grissom attempting to take second base on a passed ball. Although video replays appeared to show Grissom was safe, umpire Terry Tata called him out, and Cox was tossed in the ensuing argument.

In 1981, Cox was inducted into the Fresno County Athletic Hall of Fame.

On August 12, 2011, a luncheon was held by the Braves, and Cox was inducted into the Atlanta Braves Hall of Fame and his number six jersey was retired. Afterward, an on-field ceremony was held that recognized the long-time Braves manager prior to the scheduled game versus the Chicago Cubs.

Cox was unanimously elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame by the 16-member Veterans Committee on December 9, 2013. The ceremony was held on July 27, 2014.

Cox was hired on September 22, 2014, to return on a part-time basis to help the Atlanta Braves choose their next general manager and director of player development after the dismissal of general manager Frank Wren and player personnel director Bruce Manno.

In 2019, the International League announced that Cox would be inducted into its Hall of Fame, noting especially his managerial experience with the Chiefs.

<text>The Mettlen–Lavorgo powerline, also called the Lukmanier powerline, is the 400 kV three-phase alternating current high voltage electric power transmission line over the Lukmanier Pass in Switzerland, from Mettlen substation (), next Inwil, about south of Hochdorf, to Lavorgo substation (), next Lavorgo, about south of Faido. Trees falling on the line in 2003 caused a major blackout in Italy.

==History==
The powerline was built in 1948–1949. In 2006, 17 transmission towers between Sisikon and Ingenbohl and in 2008, 28 transmission towers between Arth and Küssnacht am Rigi were replaced.

On 28 September 2003, during a storm, two trees hit the powerline in Brunnen causing a major blackout in Italy.
The loss of power affected most of all peninsula; nearly 50 million people remained cut-off for up to 18 hours.

==Description==
On the long section from Mettlen to Amsteg it shares the pylons with the Gotthard Powerline. After Amsteg the Lukmanier Powerline runs on its own track.

On the section between Mettlen and Amsteg 160 pylons are used with two level and three level arrangements of the conductors. For the long section between Amsteg and Lavorgo over the Lukmanier Pass 145 pylons for one circuit with one level arrangement of the three conductors are used. The mean height of the used pylons is .

A unique aspect of this line is the 75-metre-high anchor pylon, which stands on 28-metre-high feet of concrete in the artificial lake of Santa Maria, canton Graubünden. This pylon was built in 1949 as a normal pylon. At the construction of the Santa María Dam it was replaced in 1957 by the existing pylon on concrete feet to protect the steel construction from the water and at wintertime from ice on the lake. This pylon carries one crossarm for one circuit.
The mean span width of the line is , the biggest span width between two pylons is . As conductors bundles of two and three conductors of Aldrey (an aluminium-magnesium-silicon alloy) with a cross section of are used. The diameter of each single conductor is . As ground wire two steel ropes with a cross section of are used.

In the Mittelplatten area, the culminating point, the powerline consists of the highest transmission tower in the Swiss power grid, stationed above sea level. The steel lattice mast is tall.

<text>Sir Alec Rose (13 July 1908 – 11 January 1991) was a nursery owner and fruit merchant in England. After serving in the Royal Navy during World War II, he developed a passion for amateur single-handed sailing. He took part in the second single-handed Atlantic race in 1964 and circumnavigated the globe single-handedly in 1967–68, for which he was knighted. His boat &quot;Lively Lady&quot; is still seaworthy and is used for sail training by a charity.

==Naval career==
Alec Rose was born in Canterbury. During World War II he served in the Royal Navy as a diesel mechanic on a convoy escort, HMS &quot;Leith&quot;.

==&quot;Lively Lady&quot;==
After the war, Rose learned to sail in a former ship&#x27;s lifeboat before buying the 36-foot cutter &quot;Lively Lady&quot; second-hand. &quot;Lively Lady&quot; was built of teak planking on grown paduak frames. Her original design was by Frederick Shepherd, but this was substantially modified by S. J. P. Cambridge, the previous owner, who built her in Calcutta, with the help of two Indian cabinetmakers. Cambridge had studied boat design during the war, and &quot;Lively Lady&quot; was basic, but sturdy and stable. 

In 2015, the charity &quot;Around and Around&quot; undertook a 25-year management of the yacht and restored and extensively refitted her in time to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Rose&#x27;s circumnavigation., since she has been awarded to Around and Around.

The &quot;Lively Lady&quot; came up to St Katherine Docks in London for the classic boat show there in September 2023.

In the future she will be used again for getting young adults involved in sailing, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds.

==Single-handed Atlantic crossing==

Rose converted &quot;Lively Lady&quot; to a yawl by adding a mizzenmast. No mizzen was set on this mast (it would interfere with the self-steering gear), but it allowed a mizzen staysail to be set, which was helpful when reaching. In 1964, Rose participated in the second single-handed transatlantic race, finishing in fourth place. Not having any means of communication on board, he did not know of his success until after he crossed the finish line. The race started at Plymouth, where Rose was photographed on board by Eileen Ramsay, the chronicler of sailing in post-war Britain.

==Single-handed global circumnavigation==
When Rose heard that Francis Chichester intended to sail single-handedly around the world, he was keen to compete. He attempted to start his journey at approximately the same time as Chichester (sailing &quot;Gypsy Moth IV&quot;) in 1966, but mechanical failures and a collision off Ushant meant he had to postpone the event until the following year.

The voyage began on 16 July 1967. While he was away Rose&#x27;s wife Dorothy ran their fruit and vegetable stall, displaying a map charting his progress. On 17 December, after 155 days and 14,500 miles, he arrived in Melbourne where he met his son who lived there. Among the people who came to watch Rose&#x27;s arrival was Prime Minister Harold Holt, who disappeared later the same day after going for a swim. Rose stopped once more, an unplanned call into Bluff Harbour, New Zealand, to repair a damaged mast.

The voyage was closely followed by the British and international press and Rose&#x27;s landfall at 12.33pm in Southsea, Portsmouth, on 4 July 1968, 354 days after he set off, was met by cheering crowds of hundreds of thousands. It was 10 days before his 60th birthday. On 10 July 1968, he was made a Knight Bachelor. He was made a Freeman of the City of Portsmouth in the same year, was guest of honour at the Anglo-American Sporting Club gala evening at the London Hilton, and fêted with &quot;Lively Lady&quot; outside the Daily Mirror Building at Holborn Circus. He opened the Bamboo House Chinese restaurant in Southsea in 1968. He was granted the Freedom of the City of London in 1969.

Rose&#x27;s voyages are detailed in his book &quot;My Lively Lady&quot;. He wrote a children&#x27;s version, &quot;Around the world with Lively Lady&quot; (1968) and another book &quot;My favourite tales of the sea&quot; (1969).

==After circumnavigation==
In 1973 Rose was given the honour of firing the starting gun for the first Whitbread Round the World Race. On 17 May 1975, he opened 5th Littlehampton Sea Scouts&#x27; HQ &quot;Gordon Hall&quot; in Lineside Way, Littlehampton, West Sussex.

Rose provided the foreword for the 1980 reprint of Brouscon&#x27;s &quot;Tidal Almanac&quot; of 1546.

==Publications==
* &quot;My Lively Lady&quot;, November 1968, Nautical Publishing Company. .
* &quot;Around the world with Lively Lady&quot;, 1968, Geoffrey Chapman, London. .
* &quot;My favourite tales of the sea&quot;, 1969, Nautical Publishing Company, Lymington, in association with George G. Harrap &amp; Co. .

==Personal life==
Rose was born in Canterbury and was educated at Simon Langton Grammar School for Boys. In his book &quot;My Lively Lady&quot; Rose described himself as a shy youth and a loner, fascinated by nature and the sea. He preferred to be self-employed rather than take a regular job, which allowed him to spend the time (over several years) preparing his yacht for the trans-Atlantic race. Rose and his wife Dorothy ran a greengrocer&#x27;s shop at 38 Osborne Road, Southsea.

Alec Rose died aged 82 on 11 January 1991 at Queen Alexandra Hospital, Portsmouth. At the time of his death he was Admiral of the Ocean Cruising Club, and in an obituary Tim Heywood, a founder member and past Commodore who had known Rose since 1966, described him as &quot;the epitome of the breed of great seamen: quiet, reserved and humble&quot;. Rose was survived by his wife Dorothy, two sons and two daughters. He bequeathed &quot;Lively Lady&quot; to Portsmouth.

==Legacy==

Alec Rose Lane in Portsmouth city centre is named after him, as is a Wetherspoon public house in Port Solent, Portsmouth and the 3rd Worthing Scout Groups &#x27;Rose&#x27; Cub Pack. An elderly people&#x27;s residence in Gosport bears his name. Sir Alec&#x27;s sailing club Eastney Cruising Association in Portsmouth has a Cornish Pilot Gig named after him. There is a plaque commemorating his global circumnavigation near his landing point at Southsea. Rose gives his name to the RNSA Sir Alec Rose Trophy for Outstanding Single Handed achievement.

&quot;Lively Lady&quot; was displayed at the 2005 London Boat Show. A pub in Bracklesham, near Chichester, West Sussex, is named The Lively Lady after Rose&#x27;s yacht.

From 2006 to 2008 Alan Priddy, founder of the &quot;Around and Around&quot; charity, circumnavigated the globe aboard Rose&#x27;s yacht &quot;Lively Lady&quot;. The 60-year-old boat was crewed in stages by a group of 38 disadvantaged young adults. Which to most of them was &quot;life changing&quot;, Priddy attributed his passion for sailing to Rose. &quot;Lively Lady&quot; was in 2009 leased to &quot;Around and Around&quot; for 25 years so the charity could maintain and use her for training. In 2011 the charity announced that, after a refit, &quot;Lively Lady&quot; would undertake another circumnavigation to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Rose&#x27;s achievement. The charity restored and extensively refitted the yacht in time to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Rose&#x27;s circumnavigation.

<doc id="870689" wikidata="Q706014" url="?curid=870689" title="Daunte Culpepper">
<text>Daunte Rachard Culpepper (born January 28, 1977) is an American former professional football quarterback who played in the National Football League (NFL) for 11 seasons, primarily with the Minnesota Vikings. He played college football for the UCF Knights and was selected by the Vikings in the first round of the 1999 NFL draft.

During his seven seasons with the Vikings, Culpepper led the team to two playoff runs, one division title, and an NFC Championship Game appearance, along with earning three Pro Bowl selections. His most successful season was in 2004 when he set the single-season record for the most total yardage produced by an NFL quarterback. However, Culpepper suffered a devastating knee injury the following season that ended his Vikings tenure and derailed his career. After his injury, he played sparingly in the NFL for the Miami Dolphins, the Oakland Raiders, and the Detroit Lions. Culpepper last played professionally for the Sacramento Mountain Lions of the United Football League (UFL).

==Early life==
Culpepper was born to a single mother, Barbara Henderson, who is the sister of former NFL linebacker Thomas &quot;Hollywood&quot; Henderson. While his mother was pregnant with him, she was serving time for armed robbery. Culpepper was adopted when he was a day old and raised as one of more than 15 children of the late Emma Lewis Culpepper, who worked in the correctional facility where his mother was held. They lived in Ocala, Florida, where Culpepper attended Vanguard High School. He played football, coached by Phillip (Phil) Yancey, as well as basketball and baseball. After his senior season in 1994, Culpepper was named Mr. Football in the state of Florida. In 2007, Culpepper was named to the FHSAA&#x27;s All-Century Team that listed the top 33 football players in the state of Florida&#x27;s 100-year history of high school football.

Near the end of his high school team&#x27;s state basketball championship game, the referee called traveling on Culpepper when he was driving for the game-winning lay-up. Later on in his career, Culpepper celebrated his football touchdowns by moving his hands in the motion that a basketball referee makes when calling traveling, also known as &quot;the roll&quot;.

Culpepper was drafted in the 26th round (730th overall) by the New York Yankees in the 1995 Major League Baseball Draft but did not sign and chose to attend college.

==College career==
Culpepper struggled to get into college, because of low SAT scores. Top football schools, such as the University of Miami and University of Florida, backed off from recruiting him when it was assumed he would not qualify. The University of Central Florida, however, being a Division II school did not have to abide by the rules of Division I when it came to SAT scores. With this, the University of Central Florida offered to tutor him and help him achieve the necessary scores, and he was able to qualify. Although the big college programs returned to recruit him, as a show of loyalty, Culpepper enrolled at UCF.

Although he had a love for baseball, Culpepper committed to play football at UCF as a quarterback. He rewrote virtually all of the school&#x27;s quarterback records, approximately 30 in all, many held by Darin Slack since 1987. Culpepper also set an NCAA record for single-season completion percentage at 73.6%, breaking a 15-year-old mark set by Steve Young (71.3%). This record would stand until Colt McCoy (Texas) finished the 2008 season with a completion percentage of 77.6%. Culpepper accomplished a feat equaled by only two others in NCAA history when he topped the 10,000-yard passing mark and the 1,000-yard rushing mark in his career. He finished his career sixth on the NCAA&#x27;s all-time total offense list for all divisions with 12,459 yards and was responsible for 108 career touchdowns (84 passing).

After his junior season, Culpepper was being lured out of the collegiate ranks to enter the draft and join the NFL, but instead returned to UCF to play his senior year. UCF posted a 9–2 record, losing only to Purdue and Auburn.

==Professional career==

===Pre-draft===

===Minnesota Vikings===
====Early career and immediate success====

Culpepper was drafted 11th overall in the first round of the 1999 NFL draft by the Minnesota Vikings; he was the fourth quarterback chosen, after Tim Couch (first overall), Donovan McNabb (second) and Akili Smith (third). In his first year Culpepper played in one game, rushing three times for six yards and not throwing a pass.

In 2000, Culpepper was named Minnesota&#x27;s starting quarterback. He led the Vikings to victory in the first seven games of the season, and helped them finish 11–5 and advance to the NFC Championship game, where they were beaten by the New York Giants 41–0. During the season, Culpepper passed for 3,937 yards, 33 touchdowns and 16 interceptions. He also rushed for 470 yards and seven touchdowns. One of Culpepper&#x27;s most notable moments was against the Buffalo Bills when he threw a pass across his body and the field to Randy Moss for a 39-yard touchdown pass, although the pass was at least 60 total yards. At the end of the year, he was selected to his first Pro Bowl. Randy Moss, wide receiver for the Vikings, said that Culpepper was one of the most talented quarterbacks he had ever seen following the 2000 season.

====Struggles and comeback====
Culpepper struggled over the next two seasons beginning in 2001, throwing 14 touchdowns to 13 interceptions. The Vikings finished the season 5–11. Culpepper started all 11 games in which he appeared, missing the final five games of the season with a knee injury he suffered in a game against the Pittsburgh Steelers on December 2. He completed 60 percent of his passes or better in nine of his 11 outings, including twice when he surpassed the 70.0 mark and had a passer rating of 100.0 better in two contests where the Vikings were 1–1 in those games. Culpepper&#x27;s rushing total ranked third among NFL quarterbacks, trailing only Pittsburgh&#x27;s Kordell Stewart (537) and Philadelphia’s Donovan McNabb (482). Perhaps his most notable performance during this campaign occurred during the 20–16 comeback win over the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. On the run, Culpepper barreled into Derrick Brooks and Shelton Quarles, but was the first player up after the eight-yard score.

Culpepper continued to struggle in 2002, throwing 18 touchdowns to 23 interceptions and leading the Vikings to a 6–10 record. He also fumbled an NFL record 23 times, losing nine of them. Some attribute this to his appearance on the cover of the &quot;Madden NFL 2002&quot; video game, where he subsequently proceeded to have the worst year of his career until 2005, keeping with the superstition of the “Madden Curse”. Culpepper went on to win the EA Sports Madden Bowl title among NFL players during the 2003 offseason.

Culpepper&#x27;s ten rushing scores led all NFL QBs in 2002 and also marked the sixth-highest total by a QB in NFL history, trailing only Cam Newton (14 for Carolina in 2011) and (12 for New England in 2020), Steve Grogan (12 for New England in 1976), Johnny Lujack (11 for Chicago in 1950), Tobin Rote (11 for Green Bay in 1956), Kordell Stewart (11 for Pittsburgh in 1997), and Kyler Murray (11 for Arizona in 2020).

Culpepper made a comeback in 2003, leading the Vikings to a 9–7 record, although they missed the playoffs. He passed for 3,479 yards, 25 touchdowns, and only 11 interceptions, and earned his second trip to the Pro Bowl.

====Historic season====
Culpepper enjoyed his best statistical season as a professional in 2004 and, though they were only 8–8, the Vikings reached the playoffs for the second time under Culpepper. Passing for a league-leading 4,717 yards, a Viking-record 39 touchdowns, and only 11 interceptions, Culpepper was named to his third career Pro Bowl. Culpepper also broke Dan Marino&#x27;s NFL record for combined passing and rushing yards, amassing 5,123 total yards. His 2,323 rushing yards from 2000–2004 also made him only the fourth quarterback in NFL history to run for more than 2,300 yards in a five-season period. (Michael Vick had 3,570 from 2002–2006; Randall Cunningham had 3,232 from 1986–1990; and Steve McNair had 2,387 from 1997–2001). Culpepper’s career rushing average of 26.1 yards per game is fourth-best among quarterbacks in NFL history. Only Vick (47.3 yds/g), Cunningham (30.6 yds/g), and Bobby Douglass (29.8 yds/g) have averaged more rushing yards per game during their QB careers. After the 2004 season, Culpepper said the game had &quot;slowed down&quot; for him, saying, &quot;I feel like a Jedi Knight.&quot;

====Injury====
His first two games of the 2005 season were disappointments, as the Vikings went 0–2 while Culpepper threw no touchdown passes, eight interceptions, and fumbled twice. Culpepper rebounded in the third week, throwing for 300 yards and three touchdowns while beating the New Orleans Saints. In 2005, he had six touchdowns, twelve interceptions, and five fumbles before getting injured in the seventh game (only winning two games). On October 30, he suffered a knee injury during a 38–13 loss to the Carolina Panthers. Culpepper sustained damage to three of the four major ligaments in the knee: the ACL, PCL and MCL. He was placed on injured reserve and began rehabilitation treatment near his home in Florida. Backup Brad Johnson took over in the Carolina game and after losing that one, they won the next six straight games and the team ended up with a 9–7 record. Daunte&#x27;s final career win–loss record as a starter for the Vikings was 37–40 (48.1% winning percentage).

On December 14, 2005, Culpepper and three other players were charged with indecent conduct, disorderly conduct and lewd or lascivious conduct for their involvement in the 2005 Minnesota Vikings boat cruise scandal, according to court papers and news reports. The maximum penalty they could have faced was 90 days in jail. His defense contended there was racial discrimination among the prosecution. On April 4, 2006, however, the charges against Culpepper were dropped owing to a lack of probable cause.

Culpepper was in negotiations with Zygi Wilf, the new owner of the Vikings, in regard to his contract with the team. Rumors surfaced that Culpepper was unhappy with his status in Minnesota due to the re-emergence of Brad Johnson following his injury. The Vikings wanted him to rehabilitate in Minnesota because they were not satisfied with his level of treatment in Florida. Culpepper refused this request.

Later on, Culpepper expressed his desire to be out of Minnesota. According to the Associated Press, Culpepper said that if he was not traded, he wanted to be released. Culpepper said Culpepper was not insistent on being traded to the Miami Dolphins, and orchestrated his trade without the services of his former agent. New Vikings coach Brad Childress likened his dealings with Culpepper to his dealings with Terrell Owens and said he never had a conversation with Daunte that did not involve his contract and getting more money instead of football and the team.

===Miami Dolphins===
====Struggle to return from injury====
Culpepper was traded to Nick Saban’s Miami Dolphins in exchange for a second-round draft pick. He changed his number from 11 (which he wore in Minnesota, after wearing #12 his rookie season in honor of Randall Cunningham) back to his original number 8, the same number he had at Vanguard High School and the University of Central Florida.

The Dolphins debated whether to pursue Culpepper or Drew Brees during the offseason. The Dolphins decided to bring in Culpepper based on a medical evaluation of the two players. Brees was coming back from a shoulder injury suffered the last game during the 2005 season.

Although still recovering from a serious knee injury the previous year, Culpepper was able to attend and participate in all of the Dolphins&#x27; offseason practices, including training camp. In early August, he made it public that he felt his knee was only about 85–90% recovered. In Culpepper&#x27;s preseason game against Carolina, he walked up to cornerback Chris Gamble and thanked him for injuring him, Daunte saying if Gamble had not hit him like that he would still have been in Minnesota.

Culpepper got off to a rocky start in his first two regular-season games, losing both of them with fans booing Culpepper and calling for backup Joey Harrington in the second game. However, he had an improved performance in the third game, winning 13–10 over the Tennessee Titans who had the second to last ranked defense in the NFL. However, the next week the Houston Texans with the last ranked defense in the NFL won their first game of the season against the Dolphins.

At this point, the Dolphins were 1–3 and their opponents were 1–11 when not playing Miami. After the Houston loss, Saban noticed Culpepper having trouble in practice due to a nagging bruised shoulder injury and decided to rest Culpepper for a couple of practices. During that Friday&#x27;s practice, Culpepper and Saban got into a loud, heated argument during practice. Saban had decided to bench Daunte until his shoulder recovered and he got more of the mobility back that he lost due to his knee injury.

On November 30, 2006, Culpepper underwent arthroscopic surgery on his previously injured knee to remove a piece of loose cartilage that was causing Culpepper difficulty. On December 12, 2006, Culpepper was placed on injured reserve, officially ending his 2006 season. Saban stated that although Culpepper was making progress in his rehabilitation, he and the medical staff felt it would be difficult for Culpepper to play in the next three weeks.

On December 25, 2006, Steve Young appeared as a guest announcer during the Dolphins’ second to last game and criticized Culpepper&#x27;s work ethic. Culpepper saw this on TV from his box suite at Dolphin Stadium and immediately walked down to the ESPN booth and waited for Steve Young to finish, then Daunte confronted Young about it and said he has not missed any meetings and that was not who he was. Young apologized and said though he heard Culpepper had been missing meetings, he should have checked with Daunte first before repeating it. After the season, Saban left for a head coaching job at the University of Alabama. On January 21, 2007, the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot; reported that despite public assertions by Saban, his decision to bench Culpepper actually had little to do with his knee and more to do with his head.

====End of Culpepper era====
In the absence of Culpepper, the Dolphins relied on quarterbacks Cleo Lemon and Gibran Hamdan, both of whom were considered unproven, and had, up to that point, combined for only a single regular season start. In the Dolphins’ initial mini-camp under first-year coach Cam Cameron, both the players struggled to move the offense. This poor performance led to an April 15 report that stated a much-discussed trade for Kansas City’s Trent Green was imminent, for Culpepper was unable to participate in the minicamp as he continued to recover from knee surgery. The weekend previous to the report, Culpepper revealed that the second surgery, which was designed to address scar tissue in the knee, was more serious than anyone originally divulged, and called for a rehabilitation period of 4–6 months. Culpepper said he has been told by his surgeon Dr. James Andrews to &quot;begin to ease into things&quot; after May 1.

On June 5, 2007, the Dolphins completed the long-awaited trade for Trent Green; a few hours before the Green trade became official, the Dolphins told Culpepper they “are going in a different direction at the QB position,” according to Culpepper, who resisted that plan.

On June 7, Culpepper, acting as his own agent, asked to be released from his contract with the Dolphins.

Culpepper was on the Dolphins&#x27; practice field for the start of a weekend minicamp on June 8, one day after asking for his release and two days after Miami completed a trade with Kansas City for Trent Green, who took over at quarterback.

Informed by quarterbacks coach Terry Shea that he would not be permitted to take part in any team drills during the Dolphins&#x27; June 8–10 minicamp, Culpepper stated that he would seek intervention from the NFL Players Association to end the stalemate. He was finally released by the Dolphins on July 17.

===Oakland Raiders===
Culpepper was first and most often linked to the Jacksonville Jaguars, but Jaguars head coach Jack Del Rio said he did not feel Culpepper would be a good fit. Culpepper worked out for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers soon after his release, but was not acquired by the team. On July 31, Culpepper signed a one-year contract with the Oakland Raiders, as an insurance policy by the Raiders as they struggled to sign number-one draft pick JaMarcus Russell, with whom they were engaging in contract negotiations. In 2007, Culpepper replaced the injured Josh McCown for the Raiders&#x27; matchup against his former team, the Miami Dolphins. Culpepper finished the game with two passing and three rushing touchdowns. Culpepper started a total of six games for Oakland. Prior to the Week 13 game against the Denver Broncos, Culpepper was nursing a sore quadriceps. He said he suffered the injury during the Week 12 game against the Kansas City Chiefs but it did not begin to bother him until Wednesday. Some sources said Culpepper suffered the injury when he ran a race with Oakland cornerback Stanford Routt, a college sprinter, after practice but head coach Lane Kiffin declined knowledge of the alleged incident. Due to his injury, Culpepper did not play in another game that season and was placed on injured reserve on December 26.

===2008 retirement and comeback===
Culpepper visited the Green Bay Packers on April 23 and 24, 2008. He would later turn down the offer from the Packers, $1 million for a one-year contract, claiming the deal was not good. He said he was in contact with a few other teams. In July 2008, it was reported that the Detroit Lions were interested in signing Culpepper, but they never made an offer to him. He worked out with the Pittsburgh Steelers in August 2008, but the Steelers elected to sign Byron Leftwich instead to replace the injured Charlie Batch. On August 29, 2008, Culpepper then changed his mind and stated that he would consider a backup role in Green Bay if they were still interested in him, but the team did not put forth an offer.

On September 4, 2008, Culpepper announced his retirement. He expressed his frustrations with the NFL in a brief retirement letter. The main reason of his retirement was because he felt he could still be a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The Kansas City Chiefs had spoken to Culpepper about coming out of retirement for the 2008 season after Brodie Croyle was declared out for the season with an injury. On October 23, Culpepper stated through an email to Adam Schefter that he would come out of retirement and give the NFL another shot. On October 27, Culpepper told the Chiefs that he would not make another meeting with the team due to a “better opportunity with another team”.

===Detroit Lions===
On November 2, 2008, ESPN reported that he had agreed to a two-year deal with the Detroit Lions and would join the team the following week. After passing a physical, Culpepper officially signed with the Lions on November 3. The Lions assigned Culpepper number 11, the number Roy Williams had worn before he was traded to Dallas on October 14. Culpepper played four games with the Lions before suffering a shoulder injury. On December 28, 2008, the Lions became the first team in NFL history to go 0–16. The only other teams since the AFL–NFL merger to have a winless season were the 1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who went 0–14 (the NFL did not extend the schedule to 16 games until 1978), the 1982 Baltimore Colts, who went 0–8–1 during that strike-shortened season, and subsequently the 2017 Cleveland Browns, who went 1–31 over the 2016 and 2017 seasons.

====2009====
In an interview with Sirius NFL Radio, former Lions wide receiver Mike Furrey said he had heard through former Lions teammates that the Lions planned to make Culpepper the starter for the 2009 season.

On February 16, 2009, the Lions reached an agreement with Culpepper for a restructured deal that would keep him on the team in the second year of his two-year contract. He had been due a $2.5 million roster bonus later in February prior to the restructuring.

On September 7, 2009, it was reported first overall draft pick Matthew Stafford was named the starter for the Lions regular season opener against the Saints. During the preseason, Culpepper had suffered a foot injury. Culpepper said he would respect Matthew Stafford as the starter, but was not opposed to being traded.

On December 14, 2009, Culpepper played in what the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; headlined as “Lions suffer one of their biggest defeats in history.” Played in Baltimore, the Ravens won the game 48–3. In week 14, versus the Arizona Cardinals, Culpepper was benched in favor of third-string quarterback Drew Stanton after a poor performance.

===Sacramento Mountain Lions===
Culpepper signed with the Sacramento Mountain Lions of the United Football League on June 7, 2010. The signing reunited Culpepper with Dennis Green, his former head coach in Minnesota, and Mike Kruczek, his former head coach at the University of Central Florida. Culpepper was named UFL Offensive Player of the Week, twice in the 2010 season. His best game came in week 2, beating the Florida Tuskers 24–20, throwing for 374 yards and two passing touchdowns and one rushing touchdown. In April 2011, Culpepper was placed on the protected players&#x27; list, for the 2011 UFL season.

===2011===
On August 14, 2011, San Francisco 49ers head coach Jim Harbaugh announced that Culpepper was working out for the team on the following Monday to possibly add him to the 49ers roster. However, the 49ers opted to sign Culpepper&#x27;s former Oakland Raider teammate Josh McCown instead.

Culpepper was named the 45th best quarterback of the modern era by Football Nation.

<text>Gary Joseph Gaetti (, ; born August 19, 1958), is an American former third baseman in Major League Baseball for the Minnesota Twins (1981–1990), California Angels (1991–1993), Kansas City Royals (1993–1995), St. Louis Cardinals (1996–1998), Chicago Cubs (1998–1999) and Boston Red Sox (2000).

Gaetti won a World Series with Minnesota in 1987 and was the MVP of that year&#x27;s American League Championship Series against the Detroit Tigers. In 1987, Gaetti became the first player ever to hit home runs in his first two postseason plate appearances. Gaetti also managed the independent league Sugar Land Skeeters from 2012 to 2017.

==Playing career==
Gaetti played collegiate baseball for Lake Land College in Mattoon, Illinois, and Northwest Missouri State University. Gaetti was drafted three times before finally signing with the Twins — first by the St. Louis Cardinals in the fourth round of the 1978 Major League Baseball draft (then held annually in January) and again in 1978 by the Chicago White Sox in the third round of the June secondary draft before he was drafted by the Twins in the first round of the June secondary portion of the 1979 draft. Gaetti signed on June 21, 1979.

Gaetti then spent the next three years in the Twins&#x27; minor league system, playing for the rookie level Elizabethton Twins in the Appalachian League in 1979, the A-level Wisconsin Rapids Twins in the Midwest League in 1980, and the AA-level Orlando Twins in the Southern League in 1981. Gaetti then made his major league debut in nine September games and he hit a home run off of Charlie Hough in his first major league at-bat. In 1982, Gaetti would become a permanent fixture at third base for the Twins and would man third base in Minnesota for the next nine seasons.
In 1986, Gaetti batted .287 with 34 home runs and 108 runs batted in. Gaetti won four consecutive Gold Glove Awards for fielding excellence from 1986 through 1989. Gaetti helped propel the Twins to the post-season and their first World Series championship, hitting .257 with 31 home runs and 109 RBI. He also hit himself into the record books, with home runs in his first two career postseason plate appearances in the American League Championship Series to help the Twins upset the Detroit Tigers.

Gaetti was selected as an All-Star in 1988 and 1989. Playing against the Boston Red Sox on July 17, 1990, Gaetti helped the Twins become the only team in baseball history to turn two triple plays in the same game. Despite their defensive heroics, the Twins lost the game 1–0.

His production at the plate would decline and after hitting only .229 in , Gaetti left the Twins for the Angels as a free agent. His production continued to drop off with the Angels and midway through the third year of his four-year contract, he was released, in June . He was almost immediately signed by the Royals, who had lost their projected regular third baseman, Keith Miller, to injury and had been playing rookie Phil Hiatt at third. Gaetti hit 26 home runs for the Royals in 665 at-bats between 1993 and 1994, splitting time at third with Miller, David Howard, and Terry Shumpert. In , Gaetti played in 137 games and at the age of 36, he hit .261 with 35 home runs and 96 RBI, winning his only Silver Slugger, setting a career high in home runs and missing the Royals&#x27; team record for most home runs in a season by one.

Following the 1995 season, Gaetti signed as a free agent with the Cardinals, where he enjoyed two more productive seasons before being released again in August after the Cardinals&#x27; acquisition of Fernando Tatís. Gaetti immediately signed with the Cubs, where he hit .320/8/27 as the Cubs won the National League wild card. The following season, Gaetti played only semi-regularly and was released at the end of the season after hitting .204 with nine home runs. He wound up his career the following season in Boston, appearing in five games in April at the age of 41.

Bill James noted Gaetti&#x27;s baseball-related aging process as being unusual for two reasons. Unlike most other league veterans, his walk rate never improved and his rate of productivity decline was &quot;exceptionally&quot; slow. Gaetti was used as an emergency relief pitcher by both the Cardinals and the Cubs, retiring with an ERA of 7.71 and one strikeout in three appearances.

Gaetti finished in the top 25 voting for American League Most Valuable Player four times in his career, three times with the Minnesota Twins (1986–1988), and once with the Kansas City Royals (1995). He finished fifth in American League Rookie of the Year voting (1982). He was a four-time Golden Glove Award winner (1986-1989). His 2,280 total base hits rank him 161st in the history of Major League Baseball.

==Retirement==
Gaetti was inducted into the NWMSU athletic hall of fame, the &quot;M-Club&quot;, in October 2003. He coached in the Houston Astros minor league system as a hitting coach with the AAA New Orleans Zephyrs from 2002 to 2004. Gaetti was promoted to hitting coach for the Astros on July 14, 2004, when the team dismissed manager Jimy Williams, hitting coach Harry Spilman, and pitching coach Burt Hooton. Gaetti remained in this position until July 12, , when he was fired by the Astros. Following the season, he was hired as the hitting coach for Tampa Bay&#x27;s AAA affiliate, the Durham Bulls — a position he would hold through the 2008 season. After working at Baseball USA in Houston, Texas, in 2011, Gaetti was named the first manager of the Sugar Land Skeeters. The independent team began play in 2012. During his six seasons as manager, he led them to a 448-391 overall record. In 2013, his team set the ALPB record in games won (95) and winning percentage (.679) in a season. He took them to two championship series (2014 and 2016) winning Sugar Land&#x27;s first championship in 2016. The Skeeters retired his number on August 21, 2021.

On August 19, 2007, Gaetti&#x27;s 49th birthday, the Minnesota Twins inducted him into the team&#x27;s Hall of Fame, while the club simultaneously released a commemorative bobblehead in his honor.

Gaetti&#x27;s son Joe played collegiate baseball for North Carolina State and played in the minor leagues in five different farm systems, including two separate stints with the Twins AA-level club, the New Britain Rock Cats. After failing to advance beyond the AAA level in the minor leagues, Joe ended his career in 2010 playing for the Lancaster Barnstormers of the independent Atlantic League.

==Personal life==
Gaetti became a born-again Christian while recovering from season-ending knee surgery he underwent late in the 1988 season.

In 2020, Gaetti opened the Gaetti Sports Academy to support practice and instruction for softball and baseball for area youth.

<doc id="870700" wikidata="Q352110" url="?curid=870700" title="George Gervin">
<text>George Gervin ( ; born April 27, 1952), nicknamed &quot;the Iceman&quot;, is an American former professional basketball player who played in both the American Basketball Association (ABA) and National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Virginia Squires, San Antonio Spurs, and Chicago Bulls. Gervin averaged at least 14 points per game in all 14 of his ABA and NBA seasons, and finished with an NBA career average of 26.2 points per game. Widely regarded as one of the greatest shooting guards in NBA history, in 1996 Gervin was named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History, and in 2021, Gervin was named as one of the 75 greatest players in NBA history.

==Early life==
George Gervin was born on April 27, 1952, in Detroit, Michigan. Gervin attended Martin Luther King Jr. High School. He struggled on and off the court until his senior year, when a growth spurt allowed him to average 31 points and 20 rebounds and lead his school to the state quarterfinals. He was a &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; All-State selection in 1970.

==College career==
Gervin received a scholarship to play under Coach Jerry Tarkanian at California State University, Long Beach, but he had such a culture shock that he returned home before the first semester was over. He transferred to Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti, Michigan and averaged 29.5 points as a sophomore forward in 1971–72.

While competing in an NCAA College Division national semifinal game in Evansville, Indiana, Gervin punched a Roanoke player. Gervin was suspended for the following season and eventually was removed from the team. Invitations to try out for the Olympic and Pan-American teams were withdrawn.

==Professional career==
===Pontiac Chaparrals (1972–1973)===
In 1972–73, Gervin initially played in Michigan for the Pontiac Chaparrals of the Continental Basketball Association.

===Virginia Squires (1973–1974)===
While playing with Pontiac, Gervin was spotted by Johnny Kerr, a Vice President, Basketball Operations for the Virginia Squires of the ABA. In January 1973, Kerr signed Gervin to the Squires for a $40,000 a year contract.

Gervin&#x27;s time in Virginia would be short-lived, however. The Squires&#x27; finances had never been stable, and they had been forced to start trading their best players to get enough money to stay alive. In the space of only four months, they traded Julius Erving and Swen Nater for cash and/or draft picks. During the 1974 ABA All-Star Weekend, rumors abounded that the Squires were in talks about dealing Gervin for cash. The rumors turned out to be true; on January 30, Gervin was traded to the Spurs for $228,000. The ABA tried to block the trade, claiming that by trading their last legitimate star, the Squires were holding a fire sale. However, a court sided with the Spurs. Within two years, the Squires were no more.

===San Antonio Spurs (1974–1985)===
After two seasons in the ABA, Gervin became NBA eligible in time for the 1974 NBA draft. The Phoenix Suns selected Gervin in the third round with the 40th pick, however Gervin elected to stay in the ABA and kept playing for the Spurs.
With Gervin as the centerpiece, the Spurs transformed from a primarily defense-oriented team into an exciting fast-breaking team that played what coach Bob Bass called &quot;schoolyard basketball&quot;. Although the Spurs never won an ABA playoff series during Gervin&#x27;s first three years there, their high-powered offense made them very attractive to the NBA (along with their attendance figures in a relatively small media market), and the Spurs joined the more established league as part of the 1976 ABA–NBA merger. Right before the final ABA season, the Spurs had acquired star power forward Larry Kenon via trade, forming an offensively dominant one-two punch of both he and Gervin in order to strengthen their lineup and compete for a championship. In the final season of the ABA in 1976, the Spurs finished 3rd in a five-team postseason Playoff, which meant they faced the #2 seed New York Nets for the right to play in the 1976 ABA Finals. The Spurs pushed the Julius Erving-led Nets to a Game 7, but the Nets prevailed 121–114 on their way to the Finals, which they won.

Gervin&#x27;s first NBA scoring crown came in the 1977–78 season, when he narrowly edged David Thompson for the scoring title by seven-hundredths of a point (27.22 to 27.15). Although Thompson came up with a memorable performance for the last game of the regular season, scoring 73 points, Gervin maintained his slight lead by scoring 63 points (including a then NBA record 33 points in the second quarter) in a loss during the last game of the regular season. With the scoring crown in hand, he sat out some of the third, and all of the fourth quarter. In the 1978–79 NBA season, the Spurs finished 48–34 with the second seed in the Eastern Conference, they had made it past Julius Erving and the Philadelphia 76ers in the second round, beating them in seven games as Gervin led the league in playoff scoring with 28.6 ppg. They were one win away from making it to the 1979 NBA Finals as they were up 3–1 against the Washington Bullets in the Conference Finals but collapsed by losing three straight to lose the series. Kenon would become a free agent and sign with the Bulls after the following season.

Despite disappointing playoff eliminations and not making it to the finals, Gervin was committed to the Spurs, showing no frustration towards his teammates, thus living up to his nickname and went on to lead the NBA in scoring average three years in a row from 1978 to 1980 (with a high of 33.1 points per game in 1979–80), and again in 1982. Prior to Michael Jordan, Gervin had the most scoring titles of any guard in league history. In 1981, while sitting out three games due to injury, Gervin&#x27;s replacement, Ron Brewer, averaged over 30 ppg. When Gervin returned, he scored 40+ points. When asked if he was sending a message, Gervin said, &quot;Just the way the Lord planned it&quot; and added, &quot;Ice be cool&quot; (with Ron Brewer). In the 1981–82 season, the Spurs would once again compete for a championship, by then the Spurs had just become a Western Conference franchise, finishing second in the conference with a 48–34 record. Gervin carried the team in scoring by leading the league with 29.4 ppg, they had made it back to the Conference Finals but got swept by the number one seeded Los Angeles Lakers who would end up winning the championship that year. In the 1982 offseason, the Spurs drafted high-scoring guards Oliver Robinson of UAB and Tony Grier from South Florida and also traded for all-star center Artis Gilmore to take some offensive pressure off Gervin. This time with the addition of Gilmore, high-scoring forward Mike Mitchell, and some fresh young talent, the Spurs were once again a title contender in the 1982–83 season, finishing 53–29 with the number two seed in the Western Conference, making it back to the Conference Finals once again with Gervin leading the way, averaging 25.2 ppg, only to be defeated yet again by the top-seeded Los Angeles Lakers in six games.

===Chicago Bulls (1985–1986)===
Right before the 1985–86 season, Gervin was traded to the Chicago Bulls for forward David Greenwood after missing multiple preseason workouts amid the possibility of being relegated to the bench by new head coach, Cotton Fitzsimmons. The Bulls&#x27; rising star Michael Jordan stated he was &quot;unhappy&quot; after the trade. This season would be Gervin&#x27;s last season in the NBA before retiring from the league. Although by this time he was aging and no longer at an all-star level, Gervin was still effective on the Bulls roster, averaging 16.2 ppg, had another 40-point game performance (a season-high 45 points against the Dallas Mavericks) and played all 82 games. The Bulls finished 30–52 but it was enough for a playoff berth clinching the number 8 seed in the Eastern Conference. The last NBA game of Gervin&#x27;s career was April 20, 1986, Jordan&#x27;s remarkable 63 point game against the Boston Celtics in Game 2 of the first round. Gervin recorded an assist and a personal foul in five minutes of play and the Bulls would later get swept by the Celtics in the first round.

===Banco di Roma (1986–1987)===
When he left the NBA, Gervin played for several years in Europe: In Italy for Banco Roma during the 1986–87 season where he averaged 26.1 points per game.

===Quad City Thunder (1989)===
In between his years of playing in Europe, Gervin also played for the Quad City Thunder of the now defunct Continental Basketball Association (different from the CBA he began his career with).

===TDK Manresa (1989–1990)===
Gervin played in the Spanish National Basketball League for TDK Manresa team (he was 38 years old at the time). At this point in his career he had lost some of his quickness, but his scoring instinct remained; he averaged 25.5 points, 5 rebounds and 1.2 assists, and in his last game he scored 31 points and grabbed 15 rebounds to keep Manresa in the first Spanish division.

==Coaching career==
===San Antonio Spurs (1992–1994)===
Gervin coached for the Spurs from 1992 to 1994 and participated in the 1992 NBA All-Star Legends Game, where he scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in 16 minutes.

===Legacy===
Nicknamed &quot;Iceman&quot; for his cool demeanor on the court, Gervin was primarily known for his scoring talents. He had also received the nickname because of his rare ability to play the game of basketball at a high level without sweating.

Gervin&#x27;s trademark move was the finger roll, which he executed with unusual delicacy, touch, and range. Typically used by others to shoot short layups, Gervin&#x27;s effectiveness with the shot extended all the way to the free-throw line.

Gervin&#x27;s legacy has inspired other athletes. Basketball great Gary Payton has stated his childhood idol was Gervin and that he was his favorite player to watch. Gervin was also idolized by former NFL and Heisman-winning quarterback Ty Detmer. Detmer records in his autobiography that he was elated to receive Gervin&#x27;s autograph one day as a youth in San Antonio.

In 2021, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Gervin as the 42nd greatest player in NBA history.

==Awards and records==

Gervin was inducted to the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 1996; additionally, his #44 jersey has been retired by the Spurs and he was named as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. In 2009, Gervin was ranked #45 on &quot;SLAM Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Top 50 NBA Players of All Time. In 2021, he was also named as one of the 75 greatest player in NBA history.

He remains active in the San Antonio community with his seven organizations designed specifically for underprivileged kids, including the George Gervin Youth Center. Gervin has said that his own experience as an underprivileged child in Michigan inspired him to get involved.

At the time of his trade to the Bulls, he held nearly every significant scoring record in Spurs history. Many of his records have been surpassed by David Robinson and Tim Duncan. Gervin retired with the most blocks by any guard in NBA history.

Though an NBA and ABA All-Star and Hall of Famer, Gervin never made an appearance with a team in either an NBA or ABA championship series during his 13-year career in American professional basketball.

* One of four players in NBA history to average 30 PPG and shoot 50 percent on field goals in a season as a guard.
** Includes Michael Jordan, Stephen Curry and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander.

==Post-playing career==

Since retiring from professional basketball, George Gervin has been active in the San Antonio community by designing organizations for underprivileged children. In 1991, he established the George Gervin Youth Center.

In 2004, he returned to Detroit to fill in on morning drive for a week on WMXD during the interregnum between the dropping of Tom Joyner from the Clear Channel radio stations and the launch of the Steve Harvey Morning Show.

==Personal life==
Gervin was born and raised in Detroit, Michigan.

In 1976, Gervin married Joyce King. The couple divorced in 1984 then remarried in 1985. They also have three children.

<doc id="870704" wikidata="Q1332245" url="?curid=870704" title="Hellinikon Olympic Complex">
<text>The Hellinikon Olympic Complex is a closed, partially demolished sports complex, situated at Elliniko, a suburban town in the southern part of the Athens urban agglomeration, approximately 16 kilometres from the Olympic Village. It was built on the site of the former Hellinikon International Airport for the staging of the 2004 Summer Olympics and 2004 Summer Paralympics. It consists of five separate venues.

== Venues ==


=== Hellinikon Indoor Arena ===
The Indoor arena was an arena adjacent to the Fencing Hall. It hosted the Basketball preliminary matches and the Handball finals at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. The facility seats 15,000 spectators for basketball, although only 10,700 seats were made publicly available during the Olympics - and seats 13,500 fans for handball - though only 10,300 seats were made publicly available during the games. The facility was completed on May 31, 2004 and officially opened on July 30, 2004.

During the 2004 Summer Paralympic Games, the Indoor Arena was the venue for Wheelchair rugby. It has also been the home arena of the Greek basketball club Panionios, and it has also hosted several finals matches of the Greek Cup. The Greek basketball club Panellinios also played European cup home games at the arena.

It was demolished in 2022.

=== Fencing Hall ===
Demolished along with the arena and other buildings in 2022.

=== Olympic Baseball Centre ===
The Olympic Baseball Centre in Athens consists of two Baseball stadiums. It was the site of the Baseball games at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. The larger stadium seats 8,700 fans-though only 6,700 seats were made publicly available during the Olympics; the smaller stadium seats 4,000 spectators, though only 3,300 seats were made publicly available during the Games. The facility had to be constructed with significant foreign help in the design, as there were only a handful of dusty baseball diamonds in the whole of Greece before the 2004 Olympics were awarded to Athens in 1997. Construction on the facility was completed on February 27, 2004, and it was officially opened on August 12, 2004, a day before the Opening Ceremonies. During the 2004 Summer Paralympic Games, the Olympic Baseball Centre was the venue for Archery. Demolished in 2023.

=== Olympic Canoe-Kayak Slalom Centre ===
Only venue of the complex that will not be demolished after the Hellenikon Metropolitan Park is built. The venue will be transformed to a pond.

=== Olympic Hockey Centre ===
=== Olympic Softball Stadium ===
== Post-Olympics development ==
The table below lists the current status and usage of the Hellinikon Olympic Complex facilities. Venues in &quot;italics&quot; have been demolished.

The site was used to house refugee populations in the current Refugee crisis in Europe. The three camps were home to over three thousand refugees living in mostly tented accommodation.

There are currently works under way to convert much of the former Hellinikon International Airport site to a metropolitan park, that requires demolishing of the complex&#x27;s venues.

<doc id="870706" wikidata="Q840880" url="?curid=870706" title="Pogo (dance)">
<text>The pogo is a dance in which the dancers jump up and down, while either remaining on the spot or moving around; the dance takes its name from its resemblance to the use of a pogo stick, especially in a common version of the dance, where one keeps one&#x27;s torso stiff, one&#x27;s arms rigid, and one&#x27;s legs close together. Pogo dancing is most associated with punk rock, and is a precursor to moshing.

==Style==
The basic steps allow for a variety of interpretations, some of which might appear quite violent. Pogo dancers have their choice of: 
*Keeping their torsos rigid or thrashing them about;
*Holding their arms stiffly at their sides or flailing them; 
*Keeping their legs together or kicking about; or
*Jumping straight up and down, jumping in any direction, or spinning in the air.

==History==
In &quot;The Filth and the Fury&quot;, Sex Pistols bassist Sid Vicious claimed that he invented the pogo sometime around 1976 at punk shows in the early days of London&#x27;s punk scene. Vicious supposedly invented the dance as a way of mocking people who came to see Sex Pistols&#x27; performances, but who were not part of the punk movement. Whether Vicious actually invented the dance or not, the pogo quickly became closely associated with punk rock. Shane MacGowan, himself an early follower of the punk scene, also attributes pogo dancing to Vicious, claiming that a leather poncho he wore to gigs prevented him from any form of dancing other than jumping up and down. In her autobiography, &quot;Clothes, Clothes, Clothes. Music, Music, Music. Boys, Boys, Boys.&quot;, Viv Albertine of The Slits claims that the Pogo was inspired by the way Sid jumped up and down while playing saxophone.

<doc id="870711" wikidata="Q1257567" url="?curid=870711" title="Triple conjunction">
<text>A triple conjunction is an astronomical event when two planets or a planet and a star appear to meet each other three times during a brief period, either in opposition or at the time of inferior conjunction, if an inferior planet is involved. The visible movement of the planet or the planets in the sky appears therefore normally prograde at the first conjunction, retrograde at the second conjunction, and again prograde at the third conjunction.

The lining-up of three planets is a particular case of syzygy.

There are three possible cases of triple conjunctions.

== Between Mercury and Venus ==

At nearly every superior conjunction of Venus (when Venus passes behind the Sun) there is a triple conjunction between Mercury and Venus. In most cases the second conjunction is not visible, because both planets have too small elongation from the Sun.

Triple conjunctions between Mercury and Venus are also possible when they are passing between Earth and the Sun at the same time. This event is much rarer, and also in this case the second conjunction is usually not observable.

== Of inferior planets with superior planets or stars ==

If Mars is in conjunction with the Sun, there is often a triple conjunction between Mars and Mercury or between Mars and Venus. In the events in which Mercury is involved, the second conjunction is invisible because of small elongation from Sun; both other events are difficult to see because of the nearness to horizon and the relatively low brightness of Mars, which is there always near its greatest distance from Earth, barely visible.

For a Mars–Venus triple conjunction all three events can almost always be seen, but Mars is dim because of its great distance from the Earth.

Triple conjunctions between the inferior planets Mercury and Venus and the superior planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, dwarf planet Pluto or with stars take place when these objects are at the same time in conjunction to Sun while Mercury or Venus are at inferior conjunction.
Frequently the second conjunction takes place when both bodies are too close to the Sun in order to be seen, while the other conjunctions are easily visible, especially if the other body is Jupiter, Saturn or a bright star.

With the dim planets Uranus, Neptune and dwarf planet Pluto the visibility of such an event is difficult, because of the low elongation from Sun.

Triple conjunctions of Mercury and Venus with the exterior planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and dwarf planet Pluto happen relatively frequently (approximately once in 10 years).

== Between two exterior planets ==

These are the most interesting triple conjunctions, because all three conjunctions can be seen very easily, because of the great elongation of the planets or stars involved.

Triple conjunctions between the bright exterior planets are very rare: the last triple conjunctions between Mars and Jupiter occurred in 1789–1790, in 1836–1837 and in 1979–1980. The next events of this kind will be again in 2123 and in 2169–2170.

The last triple conjunctions between Mars and Saturn took place in 1779, 1877 (only in right ascension) and in 1945–1946. The next triple conjunction between these planets will occur in 2148–2149, in 2185 and in 2187.

For both at triple conjunctions between Mars and Jupiter and for triple conjunctions between Mars and Saturn it is possible that two such events follow at an interval of only 2 years. This last happened for Mars and Jupiter in 927 and 929 and will be again in 2742 and 2744. It last happened for Mars and Saturn in 1742–1743 and 1744–1745 and will occur again in 2185 and 2187.

Conjunctions between Jupiter and Saturn—so-called great conjunctions, and are sometimes triple (seven times between AD 1200 and 2400). The three conjunctions occur several months apart, over a broad range of elongations from the sun.
The most historically important triple conjunction was that one between Jupiter and Saturn in 7 BCE-5 BCE, which has been proposed as the explanation for the star of Bethlehem. Triple conjunctions between Jupiter and Saturn last took place in 1682–1683, 1821 (only in right ascension), 1940–1941 and 1981. It will not occur again until 2238–2239.

There are more frequent triple conjunctions of Jupiter with Uranus or Neptune. They are unspectacular, but offer a good possibility for amateur astronomers to find these dim planets. The last triple conjunction between Jupiter and Uranus was in 2010–2011 and the next will be in 2037–2038. The last between Jupiter and Neptune was in 2009 and the next will be in 2047–2048.

At each opposition, because of the visible loop movement of the planets, there are triple conjunctions between the planet and some stars. Triple conjunctions between planets and bright stars close to the zodiac are not so frequent (approximately 2 events in 10 years).

== Of the planets Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in right ascension between 1800 and 2100 ==

== Of the planets Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune in ecliptic longitude between 1800 and 2100 ==

Note that conjunctions in right ascension and ecliptic longitude need not take place on the same date. It is possible that there is a triple conjunction in right ascension, but not in ecliptic longitude and vice versa.

== Some triple conjunctions between 2100 and 3000 ==

<doc id="870726" wikidata="Q15233654" url="?curid=870726" title="Menko">
<text>Menko (, ), also known as Bettan or Patchin, is a Japanese card game played by two or more players. It is also the name of the type of cards used to play this game. Each player uses Menko cards made from thick paper or cardboard, printed on one or both sides with images from anime, manga, and other works. A player&#x27;s card is placed on the hardwood or concrete floor and the other player throws down his or her card, trying to flip the other player&#x27;s card with a gust of wind or by striking his or her card against the other card. If he or she succeeds, he or she takes both cards. The player who takes all the cards, or the one with the most cards at the game&#x27;s end, wins the game.

Menko has been popular since the Edo period. They were originally known as men&#x27;uchi (面打) and were made by putting clay in molds which were then baked. Its quick and simple rules have made it popular among children of all age groups. Because technique is just as important as power in this game, smaller children can compete fairly with older players.

The pictures on these cards reflect the popular culture of their time, and Menko cards from the past reflect important information about their era. In the Edo and early Meiji period, images like ninja and samurai were popular. Before World War II, the most popular images were of the military, like fighter planes and battleships. After the war, characters from anime and manga were popular, as well as baseball players. Collectors of Japanese baseball cards collect baseball menko. In the late 1980s to early 1990s, Menko cards were decorated with holographs and sparkles.

<doc id="870728" wikidata="Q1734789" url="?curid=870728" title="Visual approach slope indicator">
<text>The visual approach slope indicator (VASI) is a system of lights on the side of an airport runway threshold that provides visual descent guidance information during final approach. These lights may be visible from up to during the day and up to or more at night.

==Standard VASI==


Basic visual approach slope indicators consist of one set of lights set up from the start of the runway. Each light is designed so that it appears as either white or red, depending on the angle at which it is viewed. When the pilot is approaching the lights at the proper angle, meaning the pilot is on the glide slope, the first set of lights appears white and the second set appears red. When both sets appear white, the aircraft is too high, and when both appear red it is too low. This used to be the most common type of visual approach slope indicator system; however, it is being phased out and replaced by precision approach path indicators (PAPIs), which are closer together and therefore more efficient to sight and maintain.

A mnemonic to remember the colors and their meaning is:

: White over White, you&#x27;re high as a kite / you&#x27;ll fly all night / check your height / you&#x27;re out of sight / too much height.
: Red over White, you&#x27;re alright / height&#x27;s alright.
: Red over Red, you&#x27;re dead / pilot&#x27;s dead.

(White over Red is not possible.)

Simple VASIs are obsolete, having been deleted from ICAO Annex 14 in 1995, however T-VASIS and AT-VASIS are still specified. T-VASIS is defined as twenty light units symmetrically disposed about the runway centre line in the form of two wing bars of four light units each, with bisecting longitudinal lines of six lights&quot;. AT-VASIS is an abbreviated form of T-VASIS, defined as &quot;ten light units arranged on one side of the runway in the form of a single wing bar of four light units with a bisecting longitudinal line of six lights.&quot;

==Tri-color VASI==

A tri-color system consists of a single-light unit projecting a three-color visual approach path. Below the glide path is indicated by red, on the glide path is indicated by green, and above the glide path is indicated by amber. When descending below the glide path, there is a small area of dark amber. Pilots should not mistake this area for an “above the glide path” indication.

==Pulsating VASI==

The pulsating visual approach slope indicator (PVASI) is a system similar in purpose to a VASI, but only consists of one piece of equipment. It indicates the pilot&#x27;s height on approach with a mix of red and white, steady and pulsating light. Pulsating white light indicates that the aircraft is too high, whereas steady white indicates being on the glide path. Steady red light is meant to show a position only slightly below glide path, with pulsating red light being indicative of a position well below glide path. This type of system is less prevalent than other visual glide slope indicators like regular VASIs or PAPIs: as of May 2022 there were only 84 PVASIs installed at 51 airports and heliports in the United States and its territories according to Federal Aviation Administration data, compared to 6730 PAPIs and 623 VASIs.

== Dual VASI ==
Some airports serving long-bodied aircraft have three-bar VASIs that provide two visual glide paths to the same runway. The first glide path encountered is the same as provided by the standard VASI. The second glide path is about 25 percent higher than the first and is designed for the use of pilots of long-bodied aircraft.

<text>The Schinias Olympic Rowing and Canoeing Centre (&quot;Ολυμπιακό Κωπηλατοδρόμιο Σχοινιά&quot;) was built to host the rowing and canoe sprint events at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Greece.

It is the most northerly venue of the 2004 Games situated to the east of the town of Marathon. It covers 1.24 km2 and has a spectator capacity of 14,000. It is a part of Schinias National Park.

Although not fully completed until January 31, 2004, it held its first successful competition, the World Rowing Junior Championships, in August 2003. During these championships, many boats became waterlogged due to gale-force winds and the resulting water conditions. Most of the final rounds were raced over a shortened course to avoid worse water in the second half of the 2 km lake.

During construction there was controversy over environmental destruction as wetlands were remodelled for its construction.

The centre is one of only three FISA-approved training centers in the world, the others being in Munich and Seville. It hosts domestic rowing and canoeing meetings, and has hosted the 2008 European Rowing Championships in September 2008. After the 2004 Olympics, the facility was completely reconstructed by the German company Hochtief.

<doc id="870738" wikidata="Q978882" url="?curid=870738" title="Dominic Kinnear">
<text>Dominic Kinnear (born July 26, 1967) is an American soccer coach and former player. On January 18, 2022, he was named an assistant coach by FC Cincinnati, his first coaching role since serving as the interim head coach of the LA Galaxy.

As a player, he began his professional career with Scottish club St Johnstone, and went on to play for several teams in the United States and Mexico, including the San Jose Hawks, San Jose Clash, Tampa Bay Mutiny and Necaxa. He also earned 54 caps with the United States national team.

Kinnear has been involved in coaching MLS teams since 2001. His most notable stint was from 2006 to 2014 with the Houston Dynamo, a club he led to MLS Cup in 2006 and again in 2007.

==Youth career==
Kinnear moved to the United States with his family when he was three years old. He grew up in Fremont, California, which he considers to be his hometown. He began playing youth soccer at the age of five before attending John F. Kennedy High School where he played on the boys&#x27; varsity soccer team. After graduating from high school, he attended Hartwick College for a single year. As a defender, he scored three goals as Hartwick went to the Final Four.

== Club career ==

Kinnear moved back to Scotland to try his luck with Scottish Football League club St Johnstone.

===United States (1989–94)===
In 1989, Kinnear signed with the San Francisco Bay Blackhawks of the Western Soccer League (WSL). Kinnear remained with San Francisco Bay as the Blackhawks became one of the dominant teams of the era. In 1990, the WSL merged with the American Soccer League (ASL) to form the American Professional Soccer League (APSL). That season Kinnear again earned All Star honors. In 1991, the Blackhawks took the APSL title and in 1992 went to the semifinals of the CONCACAF Champions Cup. Kinnear again earned All Star honors in 1992. In 1993, the Blackhawks owner pulled the team from the APSL and moved it to the lower division USISL, renaming the team the San Jose Hawks in the process. Despite the move to the lower division and a winning season, the Hawks folded at the end of the season.

Kinnear then moved to the Fort Lauderdale Strikers for the 1994 APSL season after a summer trial with English club Bolton Wanderers came to nothing.

===Necaxa (1995)===
In 1995, Kinnear played a single season with Primera División (First Division) team Necaxa. He scored one goal in five appearances as Necaxa took the Mexican League title.

===Return to the United States (1995–2000)===
At the end of the Mexican season, Kinnear moved to the Seattle Sounders of the A League just in time to win another league championship. He signed with the Sounders on August 10, 1995, as a replacement for injured Dick McCormick. In the championship final, he scored the winning penalty kick.

On January 24, 1996, Major League Soccer (MLS) allocated Kinnear to the Colorado Rapids, making him one of the first players in the league. Kinnear spent the 1996 season with the Rapids. On December 15, 1996, the Rapids traded Kinnear and a second round draft pick to the San Jose Clash for Paul Bravo and Rafael Amaya. He later moved to the Tampa Bay Mutiny. He scored six goals and 24 assists in his career in MLS. In February 2001, Kinnear retired and joined the San Jose Earthquakes coaching staff that was led by his former Mutiny teammate Frank Yallop. Kinnear had initially thought he was being recruited to play before Yallop mentioned coaching.

== International career ==
Kinnear earned 54 caps for the U.S. national team, including many of his country&#x27;s warm-up games for the 1994 FIFA World Cup, although he was not selected for the final squad.

==Coaching career==

In 2001, the head coach of the San Jose Earthquakes, Frank Yallop, named Dominic Kinnear as his assistant coach. Together, they helped coach the Earthquakes to the MLS Cup in 2001 and 2003.

In 2004, Frank Yallop left and Kinnear was promoted to head coach of the Earthquakes. He led the Quakes to the MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield in 2005. Kinnear moved to Houston with the rest of the Earthquakes, when the team was renamed the Houston Dynamo. On November 12, 2006, Kinnear led the Dynamo to their first MLS Cup Championship. On November 18, 2007, the Dynamo won their second MLS Cup in a row, again beating the New England Revolution. Kinnear resigned as head coach of Houston Dynamo effectively as of October 25, 2014, after their last match of the regular season.

Kinnear became the new head coach of San Jose Earthquakes following the conclusion of the 2014 regular season He replaced Mark Watson, who was fired on October 15, 2014. On June 25, 2017, Kinnear was fired as head coach of the Earthquakes and was replaced by Chris Leitch.

<doc id="870742" wikidata="Q118206787" url="?curid=870742" title="Rail transport in Wales">
<text>Rail transport in Wales began in the early 19th century initially used for industrial purposes and shortly began to be used for commercial purposes. The Beeching cuts had a significant impact on rail transport in Wales, closing a large number of railway stations. Since then some stations have reopened in Wales and following Welsh devolution, the Wales and Borders passenger rail franchise was established in 2001 and the operator was taken into public ownership by the Welsh Government in 2021.

Rail services are generally managed by the Welsh Government whilst rail infrastructure is generally the responsibility of the UK Government. Rail in Wales is mostly operated by Transport for Wales Rail. Current developments include the North Wales Metro, South Wales Metro and Swansea Bay and West Wales Metro.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The world&#x27;s oldest known iron railway bridge, Pont-y-Cafnau was designed and built in 1793. On 21 February 1804 the first recorded steam-hauled journey on rails took place in Merthyr Tydfil from Penydarren to the Glamorganshire Canal.

Swansea and Mumbles Railway was opened in 1807, becoming the first fare-paying passenger rail service in the world.

In 1832 Ffestiniog Railway opened and is the world&#x27;s oldest surviving railway company. 

Trains between South Wales, Bristol and London crossed the River Severn at Gloucester. The Severn Railway Bridge was opened in 1879, and continued to operate until it collapsed in 1960. In 1873, a Severn Estuary tunnel began construction including permanent water pumps which remain operational. The first trains passed through the tunnel in 1886 and for a century remained the longest underwater tunnel in the world.

=== Beeching report ===
In 1963, the Beeching report aimed to reduce the debt of the nationalised British Rail and led to 189 stations in Wales intended for closure with lines and tracks removed over the next decade across Wales. This list for closure was in addition to another 166 Welsh stations and halt-stops that were proposed for closure prior to Beeching&#x27;s report.

Some stations with particular industry works were saved. Larry Davies, an Arriva Trains Wales&#x27; community manager in 2013 said, &quot;Although there were a lot of local protest from people as one would expect, I think the traffic that came from the power station saved the Conwy Valley line&quot;. Since the Beeching cuts and as of 2013, 32 stations have re-opened in Wales.

=== Wales and Borders franchise ===
In March 2000, the UK government announced its proposal to form the new Wales and Borders rail franchise, following long-standing calls for this by the Select Committee on Welsh Affairs. The Wales &amp; Borders Train Company was formed on 14 October 2001 and ran by National Express.

In 2016, Transport for Wales was established, and would oversee the procurement of the next operator of the franchise, then operated by Arriva Trains Wales, as well as Metro services on the Valley Lines.

In 2018, KeolisAmey Wales was appointed to operate the Wales and Borders franchise on behalf of Transport for Wales, replacing Arriva Trains Wales as the operator of the Wales and Borders franchise, and would be operating as a &quot;partnership&quot; between KeolisAmey and Transport for Wales while being branded as the latter. It commenced operations in October 2018. The introduction of a new operator was accompanied with a £5 billion investment into rail by the Welsh Government, during the 15-year franchise.

In 2020, Transport for Wales took ownership of Core Valley Lines from Network Rail, which runs from Cardiff to Aberdare, Merthyr Tydfil, Treherbert, Rhymney and Coryton.

==== Transition to public-owned operation ====
In February 2021, the Wales and Borders franchise was brought into public ownership by the Welsh government under the subsidiary Transport for Wales Rail. In the same year, a new app was launched and Bow Street railway station became the first Transport for Wales built station.

, there are 223 rail stations in Wales.

== Network ==

===Geography===
The Welsh railway system is split into three detached parts: The South Wales network, consisting of the South Wales Main Line, the West Wales lines and their complex network of associated branches, including the Valley Lines, the Cambrian Line serving mid-Wales, and in North Wales, the North Wales Coast Line and its associated branches. The three parts are linked together by the Welsh Marches Line and Shrewsbury–Chester line which both run partly through Wales and partly through England.

=== Railway lines ===
=== Heritage railways ===
Various heritage railways are present in Wales. Some are part of the Great Little Trains of Wales initiative.

===Electrification===
The first stretch of line to be electrified in Wales was the South Wales Main Line between the Severn Tunnel and Cardiff Central railway station, which was electrified as part of the Great Western Main Line upgrade, and was completed in 2020. Plans to extend the electrification from Cardiff to were scrapped in 2017. As of December 2024, the Treherbert, Merthyr, Coryton and Aberdare Core Valley lines are electrified with the new Class 756 trains being phased into use. Plans are in place for electrification of the Rhymney, Bay and City Lines. The Cardiff Bay tramway will also be largely electrified.

== Management ==

Responsibility for agreements with rail operators and the procurement of the specific Welsh rail franchise rests with the Welsh government, whilst rail infrastructure and overall franchising powers are held by the UK government. Rail infrastructure in Wales is managed by Network Rail and is part of the Wales &amp; Western region, including some parts of England along the England–Wales border, and parts of South West England.

=== Powers ===
Wales&#x27; railway network is not devolved to the Welsh Government and Senedd, with there being limitations. The Welsh Government has been devolved some executive functions in relation to rail transport. These are primarily on the issues of funding, passenger rail franchising, discontinuing or closing railway services or some railway assets, under the Railways Act 2005 and The Welsh Ministers (Transfer of Functions) (Railways) Order 2018. The Welsh Government has the power to make TWA orders in relation to the construction and operation of railways, tramways, trolley vehicles, and other guided transport systems, where the order authorises the acquisition or use of land rights, and the charging of tolls and penalty fares. However, any application determined to be classed as &quot;England and Wales&quot;, for example a railway line crossing the England–Wales border, then that is the responsibility of the UK Government&#x27;s Secretary of State for Transport.

As it is not devolved, the Welsh Block Grant (determined by the Barnett formula) does not include funding for rail infrastructure to the Welsh Government, although the Welsh Government can still invest in rail, including for rail infrastructure and railway stations using its existing funding, but the responsibility of rail infrastructure and funding for Network Rail lies with the UK Secretary of State for Transport. This differs from Scotland, where such powers are devolved. In relation to building new railway stations in Wales, while the Welsh Government can invest, Network Rail is the asset owner and rail network operator of rail infrastructure in England and Wales, with the UK Secretary of State being responsible for the specifications of any enhancements and the funding provided for such enhancements. The UK Government&#x27;s New Stations Fund is an example of a funding source for many of the proposed railway stations in Wales made by the Welsh Government, although other proposals such as Cardiff Parkway can be funded privately with support from the Welsh Government or by gaining funding from European Structural and Investment Funds. To assess its proposals, the Welsh Government conducts a three-stage assessment process for proposed station in Wales, with the business case of a station prioritised as a greater chance to secure UK Government funding, while limiting expenses and construction time are also prioritised.

The UK Secretary of State produces a High Level Output Specification (HLOS) and Statement of Funds Available (SoFA) to set out the priorities of Network Rail. This later develops into a Control Period, a five-year long rail plan for rail infrastructure in England and Wales.

==== Devolution of more powers ====

In 2005, the UK Government offered to devolve rail infrastructure to Wales. The Welsh Assembly Government of the time refused, citing concerns around funding, the weakness of the Welsh civil service and possible issues arising from the levels of integration between Wales&#x27;s rail infrastructure with England&#x27;s.

The 2011 Commission on Devolution in Wales had recommended that rail infrastructure be devolved to Wales. The St David&#x27;s Day Agreement was created following many of the commission&#x27;s recommendations, but did not include the devolution of rail infrastructure.

In 2021, the Welsh Affairs Select Committee had proposed for the establishment of a &quot;Wales Rail Board&quot; rather than devolving infrastructure to Wales.

== Political concerns ==

=== Criticism of funding ===
A report by the Wales Governance Centre found that Wales could have utilised an additional £514million rail infrastructure between 2011-12 and 2019-20 if rail were fully devolved, and an additional £505million for the following five years.

In the 2020s, the Welsh Government and Welsh politicians had criticised the UK Government for the classification of some rail infrastructure schemes. 

In 2020, the UK Government had classified High Speed 2 as an &quot;England and Wales&quot; project. This move was criticised by Welsh MPs and Welsh Government ministers, who argued such a classificiation had little justification as High Speed 2 did not pass through Wales, and they claim would not give any benefits to Wales. The classification would mean, unlike Scotland, Wales would not receive a Barnett consequential, estimated at £5billion. By February 2020, the Welsh Government had received £755million in HS2-linked funding, with the UK Government stating it was &quot;investing record amounts in Wales&#x27; railway infrastructure&quot; and the Welsh Government had received a &quot;significant uplift&quot; in Barnett-based funding due to the UK Government&#x27;s increased funding of HS2, with Network Rail to invest £1.5billion in Wales&#x27; railways between 2019 and 2024. In April 2023, all parties of the Senedd agreed to a motion introduced by Plaid Cymru that called on the UK Government to re-allocate funding to Wales that is &quot;rightfully owed&quot; for HS2.

In 2023, the UK Government classed Northern Powerhouse Rail, as another &quot;England and Wales&quot; project, which would have given Wales a Barnett consequential of £1billion if classed as a &quot;England&quot; project. The decision was criticised by the Welsh Liberal Democrats.

=== Criticism of the state of the railways ===
In April 2023, Wales&#x27; transport minister, Lee Waters has described Welsh rail as having been &quot;pretty bleak for a while&quot; and included overcrowding and cancellations. He has accused the UK government of a &quot;managed decline&quot; of Welsh rail, which the UK government denies. Waters accused Network Rail&#x27;s running period of 2024-2029 which shows infrastructure failures and deteriorating assets which he says will cause speed restrictions, worsened reliability, and further service failures. A spokesperson of the UK government treasury responded by saying that &quot;we&#x27;re committed to improving services for rail passengers in Wales, investing a record-breaking £2bn in Welsh railways from April 2019 to March 2024.&quot;

== Future initiatives ==
Transport for Wales (TfW) have planned three regional metros in Wales, the South Wales Metro, Swansea Bay and West Wales Metro and the North Wales Metro.

=== Transport for Wales 2025 ===
TfW say that their first phase of rail services improvement will be complete by 2025. The operating service said that there will be a &quot;generational&quot; change to services in the Wales and Borders franchise after 148 new trains are deployed in Wales; over of rail lines is electrified; new stations are built; improvements are made to tracks and signals.

By 2025, TfW has promised a more expansive and frequent service on its network, all trains being replaced, with 95% of journeys on 148 new trains, and a 65% increase in capacity. TfW aim to operate five new stations, and have an improved service on Sundays. They also plan to electrify part of the South Wales Valleys rail network, while also providing &gt;600 new jobs, better Wifi services, more station car parking spaces and smarter ticketing.

<text>A keyer is an electronic device used for signaling by hand, by way of pressing one or more switches.
The technical term keyer has two very similar meanings, which are nonetheless distinct: One for telegraphy and the other for accessory devices built for computer-human communication:
* For radio-telegraphy, the term &quot;keyer&quot; specifically refers to a device which converts signals from an &quot;iambic&quot; type or &quot;sideswiper&quot; type telegraph key into Morse code for transmission, but excludes the key itself.
* For computer human interface devices, &quot;keyer&quot; generally refers to both a single-hand multi-switch and the electronics which interpret the user key-presses and send the corresponding signals to the computer.

== Radiotelegraph keyers ==
=== History &amp; telegraphy background ===
In telegraphy, so-called &quot;iambic&quot; keys developed out of an earlier generation of novel side-to-side, double-contact keys (called &quot;bushwhackers&quot;) and later, mechanical semi-automatic keys (called &quot;bugs&quot;). Semi-automatic keys were an innovation that had an impulse driven, horizontal pendulum mechanism that (only) created a series of correctly timed &quot;dits&quot;. The pendulum would repeatedly tap a switch contact for as long as its control lever was held to the right (or until the impulse from the thumb push was exhausted); telegraphers were obliged to time the &quot;dahs&quot; themselves, by pressing the lever to the left with their knuckle, one press per &quot;dah&quot;. When the lever is released, springs push it back to center and break the switch contact (including the resetting the oscillating pendulum). Because the &quot;dits&quot; are created automatically by the pendulum mechanism, but the &quot;dahs&quot; are keyed the old-fashioned way, the keys are called &quot;&quot;semi&quot;-automatic&quot;. (Modern electronic keyers create both the &quot;dits&quot; and the &quot;dahs&quot; automatically, as long as one of the switches is in contact, and are called &quot;&quot;fully&quot;-automatic&quot;.)

More than just convenience, the keys were needed for medical reasons: Telegraphers would often develop a form of repetitive stress injury, which at that time was called &quot;glass arm&quot; by telegraphers, or &quot;telegraphers’ paralysis&quot; in medical literature. It was common and was caused by forcefully &quot;pounding brass&quot; up-and-down on conventional telegraph keys. Keys built for side-to-side motion would not aggravate nor cause the injury, and allowed disabled telegraphers to continue in their profession.

=== Modern telegraphy ===
With the advent of solid state electronics, the convenience of &quot;fully&quot; automatic keying became possible by simulating and extending the operation of the old mechanical keys, and special-purpose side-to-side keys were made to operate the electronics, called &quot;iambic&quot; telegraph keys after the rhythm of telegraphy. In &quot;iambic&quot; telegraphy the &quot;dot&quot; and the &quot;dash&quot; are separate switches, activated either by one lever or by two separate levers. For as long as the telegrapher holds the lever(s) to the left or right, one of the two telegraph key switches is in contact; the electronics in the keyer will respond by sending a continuous stream of &quot;dits&quot; or &quot;dahs&quot;. The operator sends codes by choosing the direction the lever is held, and how long it is held on each side. If the operator swings from side to side &quot;slightly&quot; erratically, within some limits the electronics will none-the-less produce perfectly timed codes.

* The key is the double switch, operated by moving a single or double lever in a sequence of left and right presses, and on a double-lever key, also by pressing both levers together at the same time (&quot;squeezing&quot;).
* The keyer is the box of electronics that the key is plugged into, which in turn plugs into the socket on the radio which an old-style &quot;straight&quot; key would plug into, which the keyer simulates.

Modern keys with only one lever, which swings horizontally between two contacts and returns to center when released, are called &quot;single paddle keys&quot;; they are also called &quot;bushwhackers&quot; or &quot;sideswipers&quot;, the same as the old-style double-contact single-lever telegraph keys. The double-lever keys are called &quot;iambic keys&quot;, &quot;double-paddle keys&quot;, or &quot;squeeze keys&quot;. The name &quot;squeeze key&quot; is because both levers can be pressed at the same time, in which case the electronics then produces a string of &quot;dit-dah-dit-dah-...&quot; (&quot;iambic&quot; rhythm, hence &quot;iambic key&quot;), or &quot;dah-dit-dah-dit-...&quot; (&quot;trochaic&quot; rhythm), depending on which side makes contact first. Both types of keys have two distinct contacts, and are wired to the same type (stereo) plug, and can operate the same electronic keyer (for any commercial keyer made in the last 40 years or so) which itself connects into the same (monophonic) jack on a radio that one of the old-fashioned type telegraph keys plug into.

Fully automatic electronic keying became popular during the 1960s; at present most Morse code is sent via electronic keyers, although some enthusiasts prefer to use a traditional up-and-down &quot;straight key&quot;. Historically appropriate old-fashioned keys are used by naval museums for public demonstrations and for re-enacting civil war events, as well as special radio contests arranged to promote the use of old-style telegraph keys. Because of the popularity of iambic keys, most transmitters introduced into the market within the current century have keyer electronics built-in, so an iambic key plugs directly into a modern transmitter, which also functions as the electronic keyer. (Many modern electronic keyers and nearly all radio built-in keyers electrically detect whether the inserted plug belongs to an old type, single-switch key [monophonic plug], or a new type, double-switch key [stereo plug], and respond appropriately for the key that is wired to the inserted plug.)

== Analogy of radio teletype keyboards ==
In a completely automated teleprinter or teletype (RTTY) system, the sender presses keys on a typewriter-style keyboard to send a character data stream to a receiver, and computation alleviates the need for timing to be done by the human operator. In this way, much higher typing speeds are possible. This is an early instance of a multi-key user-input device, as are computer keyboards (which, incidentally, are what one uses for modern RTTY). The keyers discussed below are a smaller, more portable form of user input device.

== Computer interface keyers ==

Modern computer interface keyers typically have a large number of switches but not as many as a full-size keyboard; typically between four and fifty. A keyer differs from a keyboard in the sense that it lacks a traditional &quot;board&quot;; the keys are arranged in a cluster which is often held in the hand.

=== Inspiration from telegraphy ===
An example of a very simple keyer is a single telegraph key, which used for sending Morse code. In such a use, the term &quot;to key&quot; typically means to turn on and off a carrier wave. For example, it is said that one &quot;keys the transmitter&quot; by connecting some low-power stage of the amplifier in a transmitter to its follow-on stage, through the telegraph key.

When this concept of an &quot;iambic telegraph key&quot; was introduced to inventor Steve Mann in the 1970s, he mistakenly heard &quot;iambic&quot; as &quot;biambic&quot;. He then generalized the nomenclature to include various &quot;polyambic&quot; or &quot;multiambic&quot; keyers, such as a &quot;pentambic&quot; keyer (five keys, one for each finger and the thumb), and &quot;septambic&quot; (four finger and three thumb buttons on a handgrip). These systems were developed primarily for use in early, experimental forms of wearable computing, and have also been adapted to cycling with a heads-up display in projects like BEHEMOTH by Steven K. Roberts. Mann (who primarily works in computational photography) later utilized the concept in a portable backpack-based computer and imaging system, WearCam, which he invented for photographic light vectoring.

===Common computer keyer use ===
Computer interface keyers are typically one-handed grips, often used in conjunction with wearable computers. Unlike key&quot;board&quot;s, the wearable key&quot;er&quot; has no board upon which the switches are mounted. Additionally, by providing some other function – such as simultaneous grip of flash light and keying – the keyer is effectively hands-free, in the sense that one would still be holding the light source anyway.

Chorded or chording keyboards have also been developed, and are intended to be used while seated having multiple keys mounted to a board rather than a portable grip. One type of these, the so-called &quot;half-QWERTY&quot; layout, uses only minimal chording, requiring the space bar to be pressed down if the alternate hand is used. It is otherwise a standard QWERTY keyboard of full size. It, and many other innovations in keyboard controls, were designed to deal with hand disabilities in particular.

<text>The Intratec TEC-9, TEC-DC9, KG-99, and AB-10 are a line of blowback-operated semi-automatic pistols. They were developed by Intratec, an American subsidiary of the Swedish firearms manufacturer Interdynamic AB. Introduced in 1984, the TEC-9 is made of inexpensive molded polymers and a mixture of stamped and milled steel parts. The simple design of the gun made it easy to repair and modify. It was a commercial success, with over 250,000 being sold.

Similar to the AK-47&#x27;s symbolism with Third World and leftist revolutionaries, the TEC-9 is notorious in American pop culture for its association with criminal gangs, drive-by shootings and mass shootings in the 1990s, with it most notably being used during the 101 California Street shooting and the Columbine High School massacre.

== History ==
Interdynamic AB, a Swedish firearms manufacturer based in Stockholm, designed the Interdynamic MP-9, intended as an inexpensive 9mm submachine gun based on the Carl Gustav M/45 for military applications. The firearm was initially intended for adoption by the South African apartheid government, though it was rejected and shipped to various other nations. Ultimately, Interdynamic did not find a government buyer.

As a result, the weapon was taken by lead designer George Kellgren to the United States domestic market as an open-bolt semi-automatic pistol, redesigned to eliminate its collapsible stock and vertical foregrip features per the National Firearms Act of 1934 and marketed under the subsidiary Interdynamic USA brand. Still, the design was deemed too easy to convert to an automatic weapon. Due to this, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) forced Interdynamic USA to redesign the firearm into a closed-bolt system, which was harder to convert to an automatic weapon. This variant was called the KG-99, and was popularized when it made frequent appearances on the popular television show &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, where it was legally converted to full auto by Title II manufacturers.

The KG-9 and KG-99 have an open-end upper receiver tube where the bolt, recoil springs, and buffer plate are held in place by the plastic/polymer lower receiver frame. This design only allows for 9mm ammunition, and if a heavier grain ammunition or hot loads are used, the plastic lower receiver will fail or crack, rendering the firearm unusable. Later versions of the TEC-9 and AB-10 had a threaded upper receiver tube at the rear and a screw-on end cap to contain the bolt, recoil spring, and buffer plate even if removed from the lower receiver, solving the problem of lower receiver failure when using hot ammo.

=== Reputation and legislation ===
Following the 1989 Cleveland School massacre, the TEC-9 was placed on California&#x27;s list of banned weapons. To circumvent this, Intratec rebranded a variant of the TEC-9 as TEC-DC9 from 1990 to 1994 (with &quot;DC&quot; standing for &quot;Designed for California&quot;). The most noticeable external difference between the TEC-9 and the later TEC-DC9 is that rings to hold the sling were moved from the side of the gun with the cocking handle to a removable stamped metal clip in the back of the gun. In 1993, the weapon was the subject of further controversy following its use in the 101 California Street shootings That same year, California amended the 1989 Roberti–Roos Assault Weapons Control Act (AWCA), effective January 2000, to ban handguns having features such as barrel shrouds. During the 1990s the TEC-9 also developed a reputation for its use by American street gangs and organized crime syndicates, who were attracted to the large capacity 32-round magazines and low cost of the firearm.

The TEC-9 was produced from 1985 until 1994, when the model and TEC-DC9 variants were banned nationally in the United States, among the 19 firearms banned by name in the now-expired 1994 Federal Assault Weapons Ban (AWB). This ban forced Intratec to cease their manufacture, and forced them to introduce a newer model. The following year Intratec introduced the AB-10 (&quot;AB&quot; standing for &quot;After Ban&quot;), a TEC-9 Mini without a threaded muzzle/barrel shroud and sold with a smaller 10-round magazine instead of 20- or 32-round magazines. However, the AB-10 still accepted the larger capacity magazines of the pre-ban TEC-9 models which were often acquired by users in place of the standard magazine. In 1999, the TEC-DC9 Mini was notoriously used by Dylan Klebold, one of the perpetrators of the Columbine High School massacre, ending with him using it to take his own life.

In 1994, the TEC-9 was used by murder suspect Bennie Lee Lawson in a shooting at Henry Daly Building in Washington D.C., killing two FBI agents, one police officer and wounding another FBI agent and a civilian before taking his own life.

The TEC-9 was also used in the 1990 drive-by shooting at Nashville, Tennessee West End Synagogue by Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan Leonard William Armstrong.

In 2001, the Supreme Court of California ruled that Intratec was not liable for the 1993 101 California Street attacks, and that same year Intratec was dissolved and production of the AB-10 model ceased. Although still found on the used firearms market and legal on the federal level since 2004, the TEC-9 and similar variants are banned, often by name, in several US states including California, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland.

===Imitation made illegally in Europe===
Quantities of an illegally-made 9mm machine pistol were seized in Europe in 2017. Despite being improvised weapons (and not developed by Intratec) they were nonetheless marked as &quot;Intratec TEC-9&quot;, believed to possibly have been done as a means to improve the street value of the weapon.

<text>A company town is a place where all or most of the stores and housing in the town are owned by the same company that is also the main employer. Company towns are often planned with a suite of amenities such as stores, houses of worship, schools, markets, and recreation facilities.

Some company towns were established to improve living conditions for workers, but many have been regarded as controlling and/or exploitative. Others were not planned, such as Summit Hill, Pennsylvania, United States, one of the oldest, which began as a Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company mining camp and mine site nine miles (14.5 km) from the nearest outside road.

==Overview==

Traditional settings for company towns were where extractive industries – coal, metal mines, lumber – had established a monopoly franchise. Dam sites and war-industry camps founded other company towns. Since company stores often had a monopoly in company towns, it was frequently possible to pay in scrip through a truck system. However, not all company towns engaged in this particular practice.

Typically, a company town is isolated from neighboring towns and centered on a large production factory, such as a lumber or steel mill or an automobile plant. The citizens of the town either work in the factory, work in one of the smaller businesses, or are family members of someone who does. The company may also operate parks, host cultural events such as concerts, donate a church building to a local congregation, etc.

A town that existed before establishing a primary business may not officially be a company town. Still, if a single company employs most citizens, similar conditions may exist (especially regarding the town&#x27;s economy). Similar dependencies may exist in specific neighborhoods or areas within larger cities.

Company towns often become regular (public) cities and towns as they grow and attract other settlements, business enterprises, and public transportation and services infrastructure. However, if the primary company experiences hardship or fails outright, or the industry fades in importance—such as when anthracite mining declined due to dependence on steam locomotives to spur demand—the economic effect on the company town can be devastating. Without a source of employment, the communities lose property value and population as people leave to find work elsewhere.

==History==

===Paternalism===
Paternalism, a subtle form of social engineering, refers to the control of workers by their employers who seek to force middle-class ideals upon their working-class employees. Many nineteenth-century business people considered paternalism as a moral responsibility, or often a religious obligation, which would advance society while furthering their business interests. Accordingly, the company town offered a unique opportunity to achieve such ends.

Although many prominent examples of company towns portray their founders as &quot;capitalists with a conscience&quot;, for example, George Cadbury&#x27;s Bournville, if viewed cynically, the company town was often an economically viable ploy to attract and retain workers. Additionally, for-profit shops within company towns were usually owned by the company, which was unavoidable to its isolated workers, thus resulting in a monopoly for the owners.

Although economically successful, company towns sometimes failed politically due to lacking elected officials and municipally owned services. Accordingly, workers often had no say in local affairs, and therefore felt dictated to. Ultimately, this political climate caused resentment amongst workers and resulted in many residents losing long-term affection for their towns; such was the case at Pullman.

===Pullman lesson===

Although many small company towns existed in mining areas of Pennsylvania before the American Civil War, one of the most significant and most substantial early company towns in the United States was Pullman, developed in the 1880s just outside the Chicago city limits. The entirely company-owned town provided housing, markets, a library, churches, and entertainment for the 6,000 company employees and an equal number of dependents. Employees were not required to live in Pullman, although workers tended to get better treatment if they chose to live there.

The town operated successfully until the economic panic of 1893 when demand for the company&#x27;s products declined, and Pullman lowered employee wages and hours to offset the decrease in demand. Despite this, the company refused to lower rents in the town or the price of goods at its shops, thus resulting in the Pullman Strike of 1894. A national commission formed to investigate the causes of the strikes found that Pullman&#x27;s paternalism was partly to blame and labeled it &quot;Un-American&quot;. The report condemned Pullman for refusing to negotiate and for the economic hardships he created for workers in the town of Pullman. &quot;The aesthetic features are admired by visitors, but have little money value to employees, especially when they lack bread.&quot; The State of Illinois filed suit, and in 1898, the Supreme Court of Illinois forced the Pullman Company to divest ownership in the town, which was annexed to Chicago.

However, government observers maintained that Pullman&#x27;s principles accurately provided his employees with a quality of life otherwise unattainable. Still, they recognized that his excessive paternalism was inappropriate for a large-scale corporate economy and thus caused the town&#x27;s downfall. Accordingly, government observers and social reformers alike saw the need for a balance between control and well-designed towns, concluding that a model company town would only succeed if independent professionals, acting as a buffer between employers and employees, took a role in conception, planning, and management of these towns.

Historian Linda Carlson argues that the managers of corporate towns in the early 20th century believed they could avoid the mistakes made by George Pullman in the 1880s. She says they:
:wanted to create a better life for their employees: decent housing, good schools, and a &quot;morally uplifting&quot; society. In return, they expected stable, hard-working employees who would eschew the evils of drink and, most importantly, not fall prey to the blandishments of union organizers.

Thus, the Pullman Strike did not kill the company town concept but rather initiated a new chapter in their existence. Over the next thirty years, the old model of paternalism was abandoned in favour of new professionally designed company towns with architects, landscape architects, and planners translating &quot;new concepts of industrial relations and social welfare into new physical forms&quot;. This suited capitalists of the day who were keen to avoid the experiences of Pullman. The first real example occurred at Indian Hill-North Village, Massachusetts, in 1915.

===Decline of American company towns===

By the 1920s, the need for company towns had declined significantly due to increased national affluence. Despite income inequalities and a relatively low standard of living conditions amongst factory laborers, the prosperity of the 1920s saw workers&#x27; material well-being improve significantly. A strong post-war American economy meant installment buying was accessible to low-wage earners who could now purchase previously unattainable goods like automobiles and radios. Moreover, workers were no longer dependent on employers for healthcare and education.

By the 1920s, widespread ownership of automobiles meant workers no longer needed to live near their workplaces and now had access to more employment opportunities. A combination of the freedom that came with private transport and the mass communication of radio saw the isolation of company towns lessen, and the social basis of the company town became less necessary.

Furthermore, the accessibility of private transport to the working class was a step toward equality, as private transport had previously only been accessible to the wealthy. As access to surrounding municipalities increased, residents of company towns gained access to an increasing amount of government-funded public resources such as schools, libraries, and parks. Accordingly, there was no longer a need for the amenities of company towns which, before welfare capitalism, had previously been unattainable to the working class.

This new-found freedom saw a change in the mindset of workers, who began to look at welfare capitalism as demeaning rather than an incentive. Accordingly, many employees started to request additional pay instead of welfare programs. This was well received by some employers as the idea of &#x27;laissez-faire&#x27; individualism, which promoted entrepreneurial virtues of hard work being rewarded rather than direct charity, began to shape new-age paternalism.

Modernization and the increase in material well-being had also lessened the perceived need for paternalism and moral reform. Consequently, the economic downturn of the early 1930s saw some businesses do away with employee welfare schemes to reduce costs. However, the Roosevelt administration&#x27;s New Deal dealt the final blow to end American company towns by raising minimum wages, encouraging industrial self-governance, and pushing for the owners of company towns to &quot;consider the question of plans for eventual employee ownership of homes&quot;. To a lesser extent the New Deal also reduced the need for employee housing by transforming housing finance to a lower-interest, lower-deposit system, making homeownership more accessible to the working class.

==Model company towns==

During the late nineteenth century, model company towns materialized as enlightened industrialists recognized that many poor workers were living in appalling conditions. These industrialists wished to combat the unsanitary and congested conditions common to working-class districts to create better living conditions for workers. Model company towns such as Port Sunlight (1888) and Bournville (1895) were influential in regards to their building and planning innovation. The ideas generated from these model towns are regarded as having a significant influence on the Garden City movement.

The model company town is concerned with creating a productive and prosperous company. Enlightened industrialists believed this could be achieved by providing a healthier residential environment for their employees. Planning a model company town involved the fusion of new notions of house design and layout. The paternalism of the enlightened industrialist was exhibited in his desire to provide an environment for his employees that was aesthetically appealing and which included well-designed residences, parks, schools, libraries, and meeting halls. The industrialist also wished to contribute to his workers&#x27; well-being by providing social programs such as sporting events and functions. This, however, highlights the power and immense control possessed by the company owner, who could shape the lifestyle and activities of his employees to serve his interests and those of the company.

Model villages for agricultural workers were founded in the early 19th century in the United Kingdom. The creation of model company towns was particularly evident in Britain during the latter half of the nineteenth century with the creation of Saltaire (1851), Bournville, Port Sunlight, Creswell and New Earswick (1901) and coincided with the housing-reform movement, which emphasized the improvement of housing for the working class. These model towns contrasted with the overcrowded conditions in British working-class districts, which were often characterized by congested housing, unsanitary conditions, and poor provision of open space and facilities. Model company towns promoted the idea of orderly, planned town development as well as the notion of preparing for the needs of the community to provide healthier living conditions.

===Model company towns in Britain===
Model company towns around the mid-nineteenth century, such as Copley (1849), near Halifax, and Saltaire (1853), close to Bradford, had improved dwellings for workers, which contrasted with working-class housing in other industrial villages and cities. These model company towns prompted the creation of others, such as Port Sunlight, Bournville, and Creswell, within an environment of reform.

Port Sunlight (1888) in Cheshire was established by William Hesketh Lever (later Lord Leverhulme) of Lever Brothers – a soap and tallow manufacturer. The earlier layout of this model company town was planned to suit the site&#x27;s undulating topography. Port Sunlight catered for the Lever Brothers employees with improved housing (cottages of varying designs and materials) and gardens, as well as social and community facilities, including an auditorium, a school, tennis courts, and bowling greens. Port Sunlight combined the use of formal and informal planning elements, such as straight streets close to the town centre and curved streets in the residential areas. This combination of the formal and informal represented a new feature of British town planning.

Bournville (1895), near Birmingham, was established by the Cadbury brothers, George and Richard. George and Richard Cadbury chose to transfer the Cadbury factory to this new site to provide their employees with improved living conditions and a country environment that they could enjoy – a far cry from Birmingham&#x27;s busy, smoky city centre. The firm provided education as a compulsory academic course, and workers were allowed to complete commercial or technical training. The Cadburys also encouraged their workers to get involved in the social life of Bournville by providing sports facilities, athletic and cultural clubs, and social events such as summer parties. George Cadbury, a Quaker, preached Christian values, such as respectability, thrift, and sobriety, and sought to unify the Bournville community through rituals such as gift-giving between employer and employee. The firm also established work councils, such as the Women&#x27;s Works Council, and supported trade unions.

Bournville represented the union of industry and nature as the company town boasted the attractiveness of the countryside and low-density development with well-built and visually appealing dwellings. Unlike Port Sunlight, Bournville catered for a mixed community, where residences were not restricted to the workforce only. Bournville illustrated how, towards the end of the nineteenth century, low-density development was being punctuated along with the provision of open air, space, and sunlight. Bournville&#x27;s gardens, parks, tree-lined streets, sense of spaciousness, and country setting enhanced its aesthetic appeal and demonstrated George Cadbury&#x27;s endeavour to provide workers with a healthy, beautiful, and well-ventilated environment.

The Bolsover Company developed two exemplary mining communities in Derbyshire during the late nineteenth century: Bolsover (1891) and Creswell (1896). The Bolsover Company aimed to provide improved living conditions for the miners and their families in these model industrial villages. The houses at Creswell were built in concentric circles, and within these circles was a large open parkland and a bandstand. Not only did the Bolsover Company aim to provide better housing, but they also wished to improve workers&#x27; moral fibre, believing that the provision of facilities and the promotion of workers&#x27; welfare would discourage drunkenness, gambling, and bad language. The Bolsover Company provided facilities deemed beneficial for employees at both villages, including clubhouses, bowling greens, cooperative society stores, cricket pitches, and schools. During the early years of these model industrial villages, the Bolsover Company organized various events intended to enhance community life, such as flower shows, lectures, sporting events, concerts, teas, and dances.

==Industrial colonies in Catalonia==
Catalonia, located in north-eastern Spain, has an especially high density of company towns, known locally as industrial colonies. They are especially concentrated in river basins along the Ter and Llobregat and their tributaries. In Berguedà, for example, within 20 km, there are 14 colonies. The total number in Catalonia is around a hundred. These were small towns created around a factory or mine, built in a rural area, and, therefore, separate from any other population. They typically housed between 100 and 500 inhabitants; in some cases, upwards of 1000 people lived in these towns.

These industrial colonies were an emblematic aspect of industrialization in Catalonia, specifically, the second industrialization, which resulted in certain areas that were once purely rural becoming industrial. They were first created in the second half of the nineteenth century, especially in the 1870s after the American Civil War ended and raw cotton again became readily available. The last colonies were created in the early years of the twentieth century. Thus, company towns in Catalonia have a history going back some 150 years; however, in almost all cases, the company that operated the colony has now shut down. The most common industry in these colonies was textiles, and the most important from the standpoint of architecture, urban design, and the complexity of their operation. More than 75 textile colonies were recorded, although there were also mining, metallurgy, cement, and agricultural colonies.

These colonies (particularly the textile-related ones) were mostly constructed close to a river. This was because they used hydraulic power (waterwheels) to run the factory. One reason for this was that Catalonia was poor in coal, and importing it was expensive. In addition, the Catalan rivers (with little volume but a very steep sloping run) provided free and almost inexhaustible energy, which was lacking only in times of drought.

The industrial colonies&#x27; system began to collapse in the 1960s due to their inflexible capital structure and social changes, such as the desire for workers to own appliances, cars, or homes, the declining influence of religion, and the opportunities offered by towns. The colonies gradually emptied of people even before the definitive industrial crisis, which worsened in 1978. In the 1980s and 1990s, almost all the factories in these industrial colonies closed. From that moment on, many colonies became towns that were now independent of the company, others were abandoned and remain without inhabitants. Other factories were leased to smaller industries or now lie empty.

Some of the more interesting colonies include: Colònia Güell, in Santa Coloma de Cervelló, which contains several modernist buildings, such as the crypt church built by Antoni Gaudí; L&#x27;Ametlla de Merola, Puig-reig, where centenary traditional cultural activities are held, such as the representation of Els Pastorets; the three colonies of Castellbell i el Vilar: La Bauma, El Borràs, El Burés, with buildings of architectural interest; Cal Rosal, between Berga, Avià and Olvan, which, in 1858, was the first colony in the era of building large colonies in the Llobregat; Cal Vidal, Puig-reig, which houses the Museum of the Vidal Colony, or the Museum of the Sedó Colony, ideal visits for anyone wishing to learn what life was like in one of these industrial experiments.

==Examples==
===Belgium===

Having bought the mining concession of Grand-Hornu in 1810, French industrialist Henri De Gorge soon realized the need to accommodate the growing workforce of his expanding business. He commissioned architect François Obin and, after his death, Bruno Renard, to build a functional complex in a neoclassical style. Grand-Hornu became one of the world&#x27;s first purpose-built company towns. It was abandoned in 1954 after the mine was closed. It currently houses a museum of contemporary art and temporary exhibitions. Grand-Hornu is one of the four industrial sites in Wallonia that were listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site in 2012.

===Brazil===
Fordlândia was established by American industrialist Henry Ford in 1928 as a prefabricated industrial town in the Amazon rainforest of Brazil. It was intended to be inhabited by 10,000 people, but it failed, and the city was abandoned in 1934.

===Canada===
Arvida, Quebec was developed in 1927 as a company town. The town grew to have a population of about 14,000 inhabitants, four Catholic parishes, and many other denominations, parishes, and schools. It was known as &quot;the City Built in 135 Days&quot;.

Batawa was set up by the Bata Shoe Company as a planned community around a shoe factory. The factory opened in 1939 and closed in 2000.

===Chile===
Two of Chile&#x27;s UNESCO World Heritage Sites correspond to former company towns.

Humberstone was a settlement dedicated to the extraction of saltpeter during said commodity&#x27;s boom in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The town was founded and administered by James Thomas Humberstone&#x27;s Peru Nitrate Company, later acquired by Compañía Salitrera de Tarapacá y Antofagasta (COSATAN), before turning into a ghost town by the 1960s due to the steady decline in the global price of nitrates caused by the development of chemically engineered fertilizers.

Sewell was a mining town intended as both a residential and industrial hub linked to the nearby El Teniente copper mine. Founded in 1906 by the Braden Copper Company, it came to house over 16,000 inhabitants at its peak despite its remote location on the slopes of the Andes. The problematic geography on which the town was erected led to its distinctive appearance, with steep staircases and no streets for vehicular access. Although the El Teniente mine remains active, the town itself began to be dismantled and abandoned by the late 1960s as the maintenance of a remote on-site town was no longer financially viable. Some industrial activities still occur on Sewell&#x27;s grounds, but workers have primarily been relocated to nearby urban centres.

===Finland===
Kuusankoski in Finland, formerly also known as &quot;the paper capital of Finland&quot;, is a prime example of the decline many company towns have had to deal with when the company itself struggles. The town relied on three paper mills owned by Kymmene Corporation from the 1870s until 2005, when two mills, Voikkaa and Kuusaa, were shut down, leaving only the Kymi mill operating. The two closed mills employed an estimated 5% of the local population, and Kymmene&#x27;s decision left the town in socioeconomic chaos. Kuusankoski&#x27;s independent status ended in 2009 when the town was consolidated into Kouvola&#x27;s regional capital.

===France===

The French city of Le Creusot is a company town.

===Germany===

Leverkusen was founded in 1861 around Carl Leverkus&#x27; dye factory that later became the headquarters of Bayer. The city of Ludwigshafen has been dominated by BASF&#x27;s plants since the chemical company moved here in 1865. The neighboring municipality Limburgerhof also emerged from housing estates for BASF workers. Neuölsburg, built since 1875 for the workers of Ilseder Hütte, was a separate municipality until 1964. Many other companies, especially in the mining and steel industry, built housing estates for their workers near existing cities rather than separate company towns. A notable example is &quot;Siedlung Eisenheim&quot; in Oberhausen from the mid-19th century, once home to 1200 steel smelters of the Gutehoffnungshütte, which is now protected as a historic monument. The mining settlements built around the coal pits of the Ruhr region were called &quot;Zechenkolonien&quot; (&quot;pit colonies&quot;).

Wolfsburg was created as a planned city in 1938 to host the Volkswagen plant and its workers. A similar Nazi-era planned town is Salzgitter, built around the Reichswerke Hermann Göring that later became the Salzgitter AG. In 1950s East Germany, Eisenhüttenstadt (&quot;ironworks city&quot;, initially &quot;Stalinstadt&quot;) was built from scratch, housing the workers of the Eisenhüttenkombinat Ost ironworks.

===Japan===
In Japan, an equivalent to company towns are &quot;Kigyō Jōkamachi&quot; ( , Company castle town). However, these differ from company towns because the companies do not own or develop them. Instead, the term refers to towns where a specific company has a major influence on the town&#x27;s economy due to that company or its subcontractors employing a significant part of the town&#x27;s population. An example is Toyota, Aichi (), where the &quot;castle&quot; company is the automobile manufacturer Toyota. In some cases, such towns can be named after the company. For example, Toyota City changed its name from Koromo City and named the area of the town where Toyota&#x27;s headquarters is situated &quot;&quot; (, note that katakana is used here to reflect the company name) in 1959.

===Mexico===
During the Porfiriato, American-owned mining towns that settled areas mostly uninhabited areas included Cananea, El Boleo, Nacozari, Navojoa, Copala, Concordia, Santa Eulalia, Santa Rosalía de Camargo, Batopilas, and Esperanzas. Americans and Mexicans were segregated, with the 1906 Cananea strike precipitating the Mexican Revolution.

===Namibia===
Oranjemund was privately owned by De Beers until 2017 and thus governed by the diamond mining company&#x27;s administration. In 2011, the political administration was handed over to the government, which proclaimed it a town. It is now governed by a seven-seat town council.

During South African Apartheid, a form of company towns existed under the contract labor system in Namibia, then South West Africa, a colony of South Africa. Indigenous workers were coerced into signing yearlong contracts in caged-in factory compounds, which they were not allowed to leave without permission, with movement strictly controlled by Pass laws. In addition they lived in the compound dorms and primarily got food from the compound&#x27;s cafeteria, both under the control of their employers. As such, alongside the typically bad working conditions, it has been characterized by many as close to slavery.

===Poland===

Widzew, a suburb of Łódź in Poland, had been a textile company town before the Second World War.

===Slovakia===
Svit in Slovakia was founded in 1934 by business industrialist Jan Antonín Baťa following his policy of establishing well-organized model communities for his workers and other employees. This town (like other Baťa&#x27;s company towns) was also an example of social engineering.

===Sweden===

The mining city of Kiruna in Sweden was originally around 1900, built by the mining company in an unpopulated area. Many buildings, including the church, were built by the company. Many smaller towns were built and even planned by companies. Skoghall in Värmland is such an example where Stora AB owned a papermill and contained a city-planning office.

===Ukraine===
The city of Pripyat in Ukraine was established in 1970 solely to house the workers at the adjacent Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant and their families. It was one of several &quot;nuclear cities&quot; constructed by Soviet nuclear power firms throughout the latter half of the 20th century. All amenities, stores, and employment were conducted through each nuclear city&#x27;s power plant administration.

===United States===

At their peak, there were more than 2,500 company towns, housing 3% of the US population.

The rate of company owned housing however was higher, the Bureau of Labor Statistics surveyed a sample of 213 companies for 1916, a full 34.4% of their workforce lived in company housing. However, the survey covered primarily manufacturing (textile, iron &amp; steel mills) and mining towns.

The companies that ran the towns were mainly labor-intensive companies such as coal, steel, lumber, and various war industries. Most people living in these towns were immigrants new to the country. The tight, paternalistic control exerted by companies over the residents&#x27; behavior and even opinions caused issues and concerns.
Segundo, Colorado, was a company town where the CF&amp;I coal company housed its workers. It offered adequate housing and promoted upward mobility through its sponsorship of a YMCA Center, an elementary school, some small businesses, and a company store. However, air pollution was a constant health threat, and the houses lacked indoor plumbing. As demand for metallurgical coal declined, the mine laid off workers, and Segundo&#x27;s population declined. After a major fire in 1929, CF&amp;I left town, and Segundo became a ghost town.

One famous company town was McDonald, Ohio, which was created by the Carnegie Steel Company to house and serve the needs of its employees in the Youngstown, Ohio, area.

Marktown, Clayton Mark&#x27;s planned worker community, was an example in northwest Indiana.

In the present-day United States, it is relatively rare for any place in which a single company owns all the property to be granted status as an incorporated municipality. Instead, companies prefer their wholly owned communities to remain unincorporated, as this permits community administration to be carried out by appointed company officers rather than elected officials. However, incorporated municipalities heavily depend upon a single industry or organization and may be loosely considered a &quot;company town&quot;, even though the company does not technically own the town.

Scotia, California is a company town, previously owned by The Pacific Lumber Company, and is being dismantled through PLC&#x27;s bankruptcy process.

Cass, West Virginia, is a former company town now a state park. Originally founded in 1901, the town of Cass served employees who cut and processed lumber from the surrounding mountain slopes. Some of the remaining houses are available for rental; other features are the company store and an operating railway.

Bay Lake, Florida and Lake Buena Vista, Florida are controlled by The Walt Disney Company.

Bryce Canyon City, Utah is a current company town incorporated in 2007, consisting solely of Ruby&#x27;s Inn&#x27;s property and its third-generation owners, the Syrett family.

In 2021, the governor of Nevada, Steve Sisolak, announced a plan to launch so-called &quot;Innovation Zones&quot; in Nevada to attract technology firms. The zones would permit companies with large land areas to form governments with the same authority as counties, including imposing taxes, forming school districts and courts, and providing government services. The measure to further economic development with the &quot;alternative form of local government&quot; has not yet been introduced in the Legislature. Sisolak pitched the concept in his State of the State address on January 19. By allowing tech corporations to establish their governments, the plan is hoped to bring in new businesses at the forefront of &quot;groundbreaking technologies&quot; without the state cutting taxes or paying economic rent that previously helped Nevada attract companies like Tesla Inc.

In March 2021, Elon Musk announced plans to incorporate the Boca Chica area of far southeastern Texas, the site of a SpaceX rocket manufacturing and launch facility, as the city of &quot;Starbase&quot;. Some have labeled the plans and SpaceX&#x27;s existing operations in the area as an example of a company town.

<text>Roderick MacKinnon (born February 19, 1956) is an American biophysicist, neuroscientist, and businessman. He is a professor of molecular neurobiology and biophysics at Rockefeller University who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry together with Peter Agre in 2003 for his work on the structure and operation of ion channels.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
MacKinnon was born in Burlington, Massachusetts and initially attended the University of Massachusetts Boston. MacKinnon then transferred to Brandeis University after one year, and there he received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in biochemistry in 1978, studying calcium transport through the cell membrane for his honors thesis in Christopher Miller&#x27;s laboratory. It was also at Brandeis where MacKinnon met his future wife and working-colleague Alice Lee.

After receiving his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Brandeis University, MacKinnon entered medical school at Tufts University. He got his M.D. in 1982 and received training in Internal Medicine at Beth Israel Hospital in Boston. He did not feel satisfied enough with the medical profession, so in 1986 he returned to Christopher Miller&#x27;s laboratory at Brandeis for postdoctoral studies.

===Career===
In 1989 he was appointed assistant professor at Harvard University where he studied the interaction of the potassium channel with a specific toxin derived from scorpion venom, acquainting himself with methods of protein purification and X-ray crystallography. In 1996 he moved to Rockefeller University as a professor and head of the Laboratory of Molecular Neurobiology and Biophysics where he started to work on the structure of the potassium channel. These channels are of particular importance to the nervous system and the heart and enable potassium ions to cross the cell membrane.

==Scientific contributions==
Potassium channels demonstrate a seemingly counterintuitive activity: they permit the passage of potassium ions, whereas they do not allow the passage of the much smaller sodium ions. Before MacKinnon&#x27;s work, the detailed molecular architecture of potassium channels and the exact means by which they conduct ions remained speculative.

In 1998, despite barriers to the structural study of integral membrane proteins that had thwarted most attempts for decades, MacKinnon and colleagues determined the three-dimensional molecular structure of a potassium channel from an actinobacterium, &quot;Streptomyces lividans&quot;, utilizing X-ray crystallography. With this structure and other biochemical experiments, MacKinnon and colleagues were able to explain the exact mechanism by which potassium channel selectivity occurs.

His prize-winning research was conducted primarily at the Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source (CHESS) of Cornell University, and at the National Synchrotron Light Source (NSLS) of Brookhaven National Laboratory.

MacKinnon was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2005. In 2007 he became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences.

== Awards and recognition ==

* 1997: Newcomb Cleveland Prize
* 1998: W. Alden Spencer Award
* 1999: Albert Lasker Basic Medical Research Award 
* 2000: Rosenstiel Award
* 2001: Gairdner Foundation International Award
* 2003: Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize
* 2003: Nobel Prize in Chemistry

==Business activities==
MacKinnon is co-inventor with his friend and scientific collaborator, neurobiologist Bruce Bean of Harvard Medical School, of a dietary supplement for treating and preventing muscle cramps; they tested it in clinical trials and are co-founders a company to commercialize their invention, Flex Pharma. Christoph Westphal and Jennifer Cermak were co-founders as well. The company undertook drug development of a formulation of supplement as a drug candidate for neuromuscular disorders like ALS, and raised a $40 million Series A round. The company had an $86 million initial public offering in 2015. In 2016, the company launched &quot;HotShot&quot; as a dietary supplement for endurance athletes. In June 2018 the company halted clinical development of the drug candidate due to tolerability issues, cut its workforce, and said it was considering its strategy. In July 2018 MacKinnon resigned from the board of directors.

<doc id="870775" wikidata="Q5095549" url="?curid=870775" title="Chicago Coin">
<text>Chicago Coin was one of the early major manufacturers of pinball tables founded in Chicago, Illinois. The company was founded in 1932 by Samuel H. Gensburg and Samuel Wolberg to operate in the coin-operated amusement industry. In 1977, Gary Stern and Sam Stern purchased the assets of the Chicago Coin Machine Division as it was then called to found Stern Electronics, Inc. They also produced various arcade games during the 1960s to 1970s.

==History==
Sam Gensburg founded Chicago Coin Machine Exchange with brother-in-law Sam Wolberg and third partner Lou Koren, a company which had a business of trade-ins for coin-operated games. In 1931, Sam Genburg&#x27;s brothers Louis Gensburg, David Gensburg, and Meyer Gensburg had founded Genco as an amusement manufacturer and Samuel decided to enter that business by establishing Chicago Coin Machine Exchange (later renamed Chicago Coin Machine Company). The company started off by making replacement boards for early pinball games before creating the table &quot;Blackstone&quot; (1933) which was manufactured by a partner named Stoner. In 1957, the company changed its corporate name to Chicago Dynamic Industries, retaining Chicago Coin as a label of the company. Genco would remain a competitor with Chicago Coin until the companies merged in 1959.

Though never a technologically-driven or innovative company, Chicago Coin was highly successful in the years preceding and immediately succeeding World War II. Their pinball table &quot;Beam-Lite&quot; (1935), which featured a lighted playfield, sold 5,703 units and their flipperless game &quot;Kilroy&quot; (1947) sold 8,800 units which was the highest selling pinball table up until the 1970s. The company also diversified in later years, creating sports tables and shuffle alleys.

===1960s===
They later manufactured various other electro-mechanical games (EM games) for amusement arcades. In 1969, they manufactured &quot;Speedway&quot;, a licensed North American version of racing game &quot;Indy 500&quot; (1968) from Japanese company Kasco. It resembled a prototypical arcade racing video game, with an upright cabinet, yellow marquee, three-digit scoring, coin box, steering wheel, accelerator pedal, and pseudo-3D first-person perspective.

While Kasco&#x27;s original &quot;Indy 500&quot; had sold over 2,000 arcade cabinets in Japan, &quot;Speedway&quot; went on to sell over 10,000 cabinets in North America, making it the biggest hit arcade game in years, and setting an arcade sales record that was not surpassed until the arrival of arcade video games in the 1970s. Like Sega&#x27;s &quot;Periscope&quot; (1966), &quot;Speedway&quot; also charged a higher US quarter price point per play, further cementing quarter-play as the standard for North American arcade games for over two decades. Chicago Coin also adapted &quot;Speedway&quot; into a motorcycle racing game, &quot;Motorcycle&quot;, in 1970.

&quot;Speedway&quot; had an influence on Nolan Bushnell, who as a college student worked at an arcade where he became familiar with EM games such as &quot;Speedway&quot;, watching customers play and helping to maintain the machinery, while learning how it worked and developing his understanding of how the game business operates. When he founded Atari, Bushnell had originally planned to develop a driving video game, influenced by &quot;Speedway&quot; which at the time was the biggest-selling game at his arcade, but ended up developing &quot;Pong&quot; (1972) instead; Atari eventually developed a driving video game later on, &quot;Gran Trak 10&quot; (1974).

===1970s===
In 1973, Chicago Coin was one of the many companies who created &quot;Pong&quot; (1972) clones with &quot;TV Ping Pong&quot; (1973). In subsequent years, the company took to licensing games from other manufacturers including &quot;TV Goalee&quot; (1974) from Australian Leisure &amp; Allied Industries, &quot;Super Flipper&quot; (1975) (originally &quot;UFO&quot;) from Model Racing of Italy, and &quot;Destruction Derby&quot; (1975) from Exidy of California. As a result of entering the video game market, in 1974 Chicago Dynamic Industries was one of the many companies sued by Magnavox regarding patents related to the Magnavox Odyssey (1972).

Chicago Coin&#x27;s &quot;TV Pingame&quot; (1973) was a digital video game adaptation of pinball that had a vertical playfield with a paddle at the bottom, controlled by a dial, with the screen filled with simple squares to represent obstacles, bumpers and pockets. This inspired a number of clones, including &quot;TV Flipper&quot; (1973) by Midway Manufacturing, Exidy&#x27;s &quot;TV Pinball&quot; (1974), and &quot;Pin Pong&quot; (1974) by Atari, Inc. The latter replaced the dial controls with button controls.

Following subsequent financial trouble, Chicago Dynamic Industries sold the assets of Chicago Coin which were incorporated into the new company Stern Electronics, Inc.

<text>Opisthoteuthis californiana, also known as the flapjack octopus, or flapjack devilfish is a species of umbrella octopus.

== Description ==
Flapjack octopuses usually appear pinkish. They have fins above their eyes, similar to those found on some species of squid. Their maximum size is mantle length. They have eight arms (like any other octopus), but these affixed together in an umbrella shape. However unlike other octopus, they are unable to camouflage by changing skin color and texture. They have a gelatinous body, which spreads into a parachute shape when maneuvering through dimly lit water. They swim by moving their fins, pulsing their webbed arms, pushing water through their funnel for jet propulsion, or all three at once.

==Distribution==
&quot;O. californiana&quot; has a distribution in the northern and northeastern Pacific Ocean, ranging in the west from off central Honshū (Japan) and the Sea of Okhotsk, its northernmost range is the Bering Sea, and its eastern range is along the western coast of North America as far south as Eureka Bar, California (the type locality, at 350 m depth). The depth at which the species occurs typically ranges from 124 to 823 m, but more recent records indicate that they may occur down to 1500 m. Lives at the muddy seafloor off coast of the northern pacific ocean. 

== Reproduction ==
&quot;Opisthoteuthis&quot; species (like other cirrate octopuses) use continuous spawning, where the female lays one or two large eggs at a time over several years (rather than a large batch near the end of her lifespan). These eggs have a hard, protective outer shell (unlike the eggs of incirrate octopus) and are not brooded or protected by the mother, the hatched young undergo direct development (lacking the paralarvae stage of incirrate octopus) and are likely benthic. 

Mature &quot;O. californiana&quot; females carry about 1400–2380 eggs in their ovary, with the individually spawned mature eggs measuring 11 mm long. Estimations of egg hatching time (using water temperature and egg size) for &quot;O. californiana&quot; are up to 1.4 years at 4°C.

Mating has never been observed in &quot;O. californiana&quot;; the males lack the hectocotylus of typical octopus, instead having a series of enlarged suckers that presumably have a role in mating or competition. Males move seasonally, and occur in shallower waters during the summer.

==Classification==
&quot;O. californiana&quot; is one of 14 species in the genus &quot;Opisthoteuthis&quot;, these species are also collectively known as the flapjack devilfishes (due to the anterior-posterior compression of their bodies). &quot;O. californiana&quot; is morphologically very similar to &quot;Opisthoteuthis albatrossi&quot;, and they may be the same species, but the two have never been critically compared (due to the latter being historically placed in the genus &quot;Stauroteuthis&quot;). If they are conspecific, &quot;O. californiana&quot; would be a synonym of &quot;O. albatrossi&quot; (as the latter was described first in 1920, the former in 1949). Another undescribed &quot;Opisthoteuthis&quot; species may occur in the north-east Pacific, overlapping the distribution of &quot;O. californiana&quot;; this species is still being described, but in the media was given the name &quot;&#x27;Opisthoteuthis adorabilis&quot;″ (but this is not yet a valid scientific binomial name, as it lacks a published description).

== Diet ==
The stomach contents of eight members of &quot;O. californiana&quot; were found to contain small benthic/epibenthic crustaceans, including copepods, isopods, mysids, and small shrimp (crangonid or hippolytid). From observations of other &quot;Opisthoteuthis&quot; species, the extensive arm webbing is possibly used to trap small crustaceans, with the cirri and suckers moving small prey items towards the mouth (a fairly low-energy feeding strategy compared to shallow-water octopus).

== In popular culture ==
In the &quot;Finding Nemo&quot; franchise, one of Nemo&#x27;s classmates, Pearl, is a flapjack octopus. Flapjack octopuses also appear in ABZU along the sea floor. 

== Recent research==
Currently, in Monterey Canyon, research is going on with scientists from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, with several &quot;Opisthoteuthis sp.&quot; specimens (including a fertile octopus) that resemble &quot;O. californiana&quot; (in media these were given the informal name &quot;Opisthoteuthis&quot; &quot;&#x27;adorabilis&quot;″). Due to the challenges of mimicking their deep sea environment in captivity, some of the octopuses lived only for a few months, but some hope remains, as some of the eggs from the octopus have been incubating for a year (as of 2015) and they may yet hatch.

<text>Trashcan Sinatras are a Scottish Indie Rock band that were formed in Irvine, Scotland in 1986. The band&#x27;s music makes frequent use of pop harmonies and wordplay.

==History==

===Formation===
The band members met through the club/pub music scene in Irvine. The original band members included Frank Reader (bass), Davy Hughes (guitar and vocals), George McDaid (guitar) and Paul Forde (drums). 

By late 1986/early 1987, the line-up had changed to include Paul Livingston (guitar), John Douglas (guitar) and Stephen Douglas (drums), along with Frank Reader moving to vocals and Davy Hughes to bass. While the band has included other members for short periods of time over the years, this is the line-up that would record the bulk of the Trashcan Sinatras&#x27; music to date.

===&quot;Cake&quot; era===
The band was spotted by Simon Dine in 1987 and quickly signed to Go! Discs. Using their signing advance, the band purchased a recording studio in Kilmarnock, naming it Shabby Road. Work began on their debut album, which was eventually released in 1990. &quot;Cake&quot; featured the band&#x27;s largest worldwide hit single, &quot;Obscurity Knocks&quot; as well as a couple of other alternative music hits (&quot;Only Tongue Can Tell&quot; and &quot;Circling the Circumference&quot;). The band were often compared to The Smiths and the success of &quot;Cake&quot; in the United States, where it spent three months in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, led to extensive touring in both the UK and North America in support of the album.

===&quot;I&#x27;ve Seen Everything&quot; era===
The follow-up record, &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen Everything&quot; was released in 1993. The song &quot;Hayfever&quot; made an appearance on the MTV animated series, &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;. The band released two singles (&quot;Hayfever&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Seen Everything&quot;) and toured the UK, North America and Japan in support of the album.

===&quot;A Happy Pocket&quot; era===
The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;A Happy Pocket,&quot; followed in 1996. AHP was released in the UK and Japan, but was unavailable in the U.S. after the band&#x27;s American distributor declined to release the record. The band released four singles from AHP (&quot;The Main Attraction&quot;, &quot;Twisted and Bent&quot;, &quot;How Can I Apply...?&quot; and &quot;To Sir, With Love&quot;, a cover of the 1967 Lulu #1 hit). The Trashcans did not tour in North America, only the UK and Japan.

Their record label, Go! Discs, had made a successful short film for the band Portishead and greenlit the production of &quot;Spooktime&quot;, a film of stories based on characters from The Trashcans&#x27; lyrics. The 15-minute film was to be shown in cinemas before screenings of Terry Gilliam&#x27;s 12 Monkeys.

After their record company Go! Discs was acquired by Universal in 1996, the band was dropped from the label and subsequently forced to sell their Shabby Road recording studio and declare bankruptcy. The Trashcans kept a low profile in the following years.. not playing any concerts until early 1999 (in Japan and Ireland). The Japanese concerts occurred at the same time the band was recording a new single, &quot;Snow&quot; (a cover of the Randy Newman song), which was released by Sony Japan in December 1999.

===&quot;Weightlifting&quot; era===
In March 2000, the band set up camp in Hartford, Connecticut to record their fourth album. Between March and June, the band recorded around a dozen songs and played a handful of shows in the northeastern United States, their first shows in America since 1993. After returning to Scotland, the band decided to scrap the album.

The band only performed four concerts in the UK in 2001. Instead they focused on writing additional songs and recording demos for their fourth album. In March 2002, recording began at Riverside Studios in Glasgow. The band recorded a dozen songs on and off over the course of a year. In 2003, the band started to raise its profile by playing concerts and festivals in Scotland. They hired New York City based record producer and musician Andy Chase (of the band Ivy) to mix the new album tracks, which was completed by the end of the year.

With a new album ready for release, the Trashcans stepped up their activity in 2004. The band played in Spain and London, before heading to the United States in March. They appeared on the &quot;Morning Becomes Eclectic&quot; radio show with Nic Harcourt in March, the day of their sold out show at the Troubadour in Los Angeles California (their first appearance on the west coast of the U.S. in 11 years). From there, the band headed off to Austin, Texas for five appearances at the South by Southwest music festival. The Trashcans garnered quite a bit of press (&quot;Billboard&quot; staffers named the Trashcans one of the top 10 acts at SXSW) and record label attention.. which led to a licensing deal with New York-based spinART Records.

The Trashcan Sinatras finally released their fourth album in August 2004. &quot;Weightlifting&quot; was warmly received by critics and the band completed a 25 date U.S. and Canada tour in September and October 2004. They had follow up U.S. tours in December 2004 and in April and May 2005, while also extensively touring Scotland, England, Ireland, Japan and Australia during 2004–2006. The &quot;Weightlifting&quot; album included the song &quot;All the Dark Horses&quot;, which was featured prominently in the first episode of the ABC Family Channel series &quot;Wildfire&quot;.

===&quot;In the Music&quot; era===
The band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;In the Music&quot;, was recorded with producer Andy Chase between November 2007 and February 2008, at Stratosphere Sound in New York and in Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. In July 2008, Carly Simon recorded backing vocals for the song &quot;Should I Pray?&quot;
The single &quot;Oranges and Apples&quot; was released as a download-only single on 13 October 2008. The song was inspired by Syd Barrett, one of the founding members of Pink Floyd. The single was released in connection with The City Wakes, a festival in tribute to Syd Barrett that took place in Cambridge and London in October 2008.

The album was released (with bonus track &quot;Astronomy&quot;) in Japan on 22 April 2009 (on Victor Entertainment), in the United Kingdom on 14 September 2009 (on Lo-Five Records) and 27 April 2010 in North America (also on Lo-Five Records, with digital distribution by Ingrooves and physical distribution by Fontana Distribution). The North American release includes eight live bonus tracks, which are live acoustic recordings taken from the band&#x27;s November 2009 UK tour. Lo-Five also released a limited, numbered deluxe edition of the album in July 2009, which featured two additional bonus tracks (&quot;I Can&#x27;t Stand Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;I Just Don&#x27;t Know How&quot;) and an in-depth booklet of liner notes, photos and a listing of everyone who pre-ordered the release.

The album received strong reviews from print and online media with &quot;The Guardian&quot; describing it as &quot;Gentle, grown-up popcraft that reveals more with each listen&quot;, and the BBC calling it &quot; . . . tender, affecting music which impresses with increasing listens.&quot;
The band supported the 2009 album release with nearly 40 concerts and promotional appearances in the United States, Japan and the United Kingdom between July and November 2009, and with a follow-up tour of Japan in March 2010. On the follow-up Japanese tour, the band was supported by Japanese act Sunny Day Service, with whom they also recorded and released English-language and Japanese-language versions of the single &quot;Town Foxes/yume iro no machide&quot;. The band also completed an 11 date USA promotional tour in June 2010.

A live acoustic album &quot;Brel&quot; (recorded in Glasgow in 2009), a follow up to the band&#x27;s 2005&#x27;s acoustic live &quot;Fez&quot; (recorded in New York City). &quot;Brel&quot; was released on 9 November 2010. This was set to be followed by the release of &quot;Earlies...&quot; a 4 album box set marking the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Cake&quot;, comprising the 3 Go!Discs albums and &quot;Weightlifting&quot;, digitally remastered with additional tracks and packaging including mementos reflecting the band&#x27;s distinguished career. However, to date &quot;Earlies...&quot; has not been released.

===&quot;Wild Pendulum&quot; era===

In October 2014 the band announced through social media that it would begin recording its sixth album in the coming months and offered fans the opportunity to pre-order it through PledgeMusic with a series of &quot;exclusives&quot; offering unique content, merchandise and updates throughout the recording process. On 21 October 2015, the first track, &quot;Best Days On Earth,&quot; was released to the band&#x27;s PledgeMusic supporters in a project update on the site. In the same update, the band confirmed that the new album would be titled &quot;Wild Pendulum.&quot;

In an August 2015 project update, the band announced that the new album would be released in January 2016. A second track, &quot;Ain&#x27;t That Something,&quot; was later released to PledgeMusic supporters, and the album&#x27;s release was pushed back. On a 1 March 2016 project update, the band announced that a digital download of the complete album would be made available to supporters on 22 April 2016, with the album&#x27;s release on physical CDs and vinyl to follow.

==Other activity==
In 1996, the band contributed a cover version of The Smiths&#x27; &quot;I Know It&#x27;s Over&quot; to the tribute compilation &quot;The Smiths Is Dead&quot;.

In 1998, the band recorded a song &quot;Duty Free&quot; under the pseudonym The Cat Protection League. The song was included on a compilation of local Kilmarnock/Irvine-area artists as part of a university music class project.

John Douglas wrote &quot;Wild Mountainside&quot;, which was recorded by Eddi Reader for her 2003 album &quot;Eddi Reader Sings the Songs of Robert Burns&quot;. This song was later recorded by the Trashcans and released as an EP in 2005. John Douglas wrote two songs, &quot;Should I Pray?&quot; and &quot;Prisons&quot;, which appear on Eddi Reader&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Peacetime&quot;. The Trashcans have also recorded these songs for &quot;In the Music&quot;. In 2013, Douglas and Reader were married, shortly after which he was diagnosed with the autoimmune disease, ulcerative colitis, which necessitated surgery and a lengthy convalescence.

In 2006, Francis Reader sang a cover of The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Got To Get You into My Life&quot;, which was featured in an advertisement campaign for the U.S. telecommunications company Qwest Communications.

The band collaborated with writer Ali Smith on the song &quot;Half an Apple&quot;, for the album &quot;Ballads of the Book&quot;, released in March 2007.

Reader also contributed vocals in 2007 to Kevin Ayers&#x27; album &quot;The Unfairground&quot;.

30 May 2010 for the start of their 2010 tour The Trashcan Sinatras played in Mike Chandler&#x27;s Portland OR living room. This was billed as an experimental show and gained much media attention with stories in &quot;USA Today&quot;, &quot;Wired Magazine&quot;″s blog &quot;The Underwire&quot; FOX News and &quot;The Oregonian&quot;. Tickets sold out in less than 36 hours, purchased by 50 fans who traveled from all over the west coast. The band played for three hours and over 30 songs with several songs seldom heard live over the past 20 years.

In 2010 the Trashcan Sinatras recorded a version of the Beatles song &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot; for use in a promotional video campaign by Narita Airport in Japan. The video is expected to run in the airport, on board aircraft, and on Japanese media for at least one year.

In 2018 and 2019, the band completed three-piece acoustic tours of North America. The 2018 tour featured songs from &quot;Cake&quot; and &quot;I’ve Seen Everything&quot;. The 2019 tour featured songs from &quot;A Happy Pocket&quot; and &quot;Weightlifting&quot;.

<doc id="870786" wikidata="Q5156268" url="?curid=870786" title="Compensation winding">
<text>A compensation winding in a DC shunt motor is a winding in the field pole face plate that carries armature current to reduce stator field distortion. Its purpose is to reduce brush arcing and erosion in DC motors that are operated with weak fields, variable heavy loads or reversing operation such as steel-mill motors.

When flux from the armature current is about equal to the flux from the field current, the flux at the field pole plate is shifted. Under a fixed load, there is an optimal commutation point for the brushes that minimizes arcing and erosion of the brushes. When the ratio of armature flux to field flux varies greatly or reverses, the optimum commutation point shifts as result of the varying flux at the pole face plate. The result is arcing of the brushes.

By adding a compensating winding in the pole face plate that carries armature current in the opposite direction of current in the adjacent armature windings, the position of the flux at the pole face plate can be restored to the position it would have with zero armature current. The main drawback of a compensation winding is the expense. 
Figure A. shows a cross-sectional view of a two pole DC shunt motor. Armature windings (A), field windings (F) and compensation windings (C) use the dot and cross convention where a circle with a dot is a wire carrying current out of the figure and a circle with a cross is a wire carrying current into the page. For each wire in the armature that is next to the field pole face plate there is a wire in the face plate carrying current in the opposite direction.

Figure B. shows the flux caused by the field winding alone.

Figure C. shows the flux caused by the armature winding alone.

Figure D. shows field flux and armature flux being about equal. The result is that the center of flux in the gap between the pole face plate and the armature has shifted. For a more detailed drawing, see Richardson.
Figure E. shows compensation wires in the field pole face plate that are carrying current opposed to the current in the armature wire adjacent to the gap. The flux in the gap has been restored to the same condition as the case where there is no armature flux. Even though the armature wires are next to wires carrying current in the opposite direction, the wires of the armature still experience magnetic force from interaction with the field flux.

<doc id="870791" wikidata="Q6982598" url="?curid=870791" title="Navy Marine Corps Intranet">
<text>The Navy/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI) is a United States Department of the Navy program which was designed to provide the vast majority of information technology services for the entire Department, including the United States Navy and Marine Corps.

==Overview==
The largest internal computer network in the world, NMCI served more than 707,000 sailors, marines, and civilians in 620 locations across the continental United States, Hawaii, and Japan as of March 2008. The network&#x27;s 4,100 servers handle over 2.3 petabytes of data.

NMCI established an interoperable command and control network that provides the IT platform necessary for transitioning to a net-centric environment. Acting Department of Defense (DoD) CIO Terry Halvorsen described NMCI as a &quot;forcing function within the DON to attend to our legacy infrastructure of applications, servers and networks.”
While recent statements by the Navy have been very positive about NMCI, a 2007 survey of users reported it unstable, slow, and frustrating.

&quot;NMCI has been a hugely successful program for the Navy,&quot; Weller said during a press briefing with reporters [14 October 2010]. &quot;It has been a cost-effective way to deliver unprecedented level of service. We learned a lot about how to do it and how not to do it.&quot; 

&quot;Anytime you transition from where you have a high degree of localized control to a high degree of centralized control, there will be some disgruntled folks,&quot; Weller said. &quot;I think since we already are in that world, about 70 percent of the Navy&#x27;s IT infrastructure, we are in a world where the Navy has complete control and authority over how we operate the network. That has allowed us to maintain extremely high degree of security, which is frankly our number one issue. The only way that we are aware of you can do that is to have tight configuration management and tight central control. So that is where a lot of the complaints came from. To that note, what have we done to lessen blow in future? I think the answer is we don&#x27;t need to because we are already there.&quot;

On 30 September 2010, the NMCI contract ended and the new Continuity of Services Contract (COSC) began. Under the COSC, the Navy retains the same scope of NMCI services with HP, but the network becomes a government-owned, contractor-supported, managed services environment.

This is a paradigm shift because under the original NMCI contract, the government managed the network at a distance and did not own any IT assets used in the program. Rather, they were owned by the prime contractor, and services are provided to the government on a per-seat basis. Pricing is primarily assessed on a per-machine basis that includes security services, help desk support, and periodic technology upgrades; however, fees for additional services (such as classified connectivity, mission-critical service, additional user accounts, software installation, seat moves, remote access from mobile devices, etc.) did apply. Videophones that provide equal access for Deaf employees are not permissible under NMCI regulations. As of October 2007, the per-seat price for all of NMCI was reduced by 15 percent. Desktop PCs and laptops as well as other network components are being continually upgraded in order to enhance performance and security.

NMCI is the first large-scale federal government IT centralization and outsourcing project. Its lessons have informed other government agency efforts to consolidate and outsource IT services. According to industry analyst Warren Suss of Suss Sonsulting, &quot;In the long run, government agencies will come to see the need for similar types of solutions, and I think they&#x27;ll look to NMCI for lessons learned.&quot;

The NMCI program is managed by the Navy&#x27;s Program Executive Office–Enterprise Information Systems (PEO-EIS).

==History==

On 6 October 2000, the NMCI contract was awarded to Electronic Data Systems (EDS), now HP Enterprise Services (HP). Secretary of the Navy Gordon England summed up the Navy&#x27;s IT Environment prior to the commencement of NMCI: “We basically had 28 separate commands budgeting, developing, licensing, and operating IT autonomously. It was inefficient and from the larger Department perspective, produced results that were far from optimal.”

NMCI consolidated roughly 6,000 networks—some of which could not e-mail, let alone collaborate with each other—into a single integrated and secure IT environment. HP updated more than 100,000 desktop and laptop PCs in 2007. The program also consolidated an ad hoc network of more than 8,000 applications to 500 in four years and 15,003 logistics and readiness systems to 2,759 over a two-year period.

Sub-contractors to HP include:
*Apple Inc., Cisco, Dell, DTech, McAfee, Microsoft, Oracle Corporation, Sun Microsystems, and Symantec
*Harris Corporation (which acquired Multimax formerly known as Netco Government Services and WAM!NET), which provided enterprise network infrastructure design and support until its contract expired in 2014.
*Verizon, which provides wide area network (WAN) connectivity.
HP also provides the security services once provided by Raytheon.

HP also has worked with more than 400 small businesses, with 5 percent for small disadvantaged businesses, 5 percent for women-owned small businesses and 1.5 percent for HUBZone small businesses. Since its inception, NMCI has exceeded the minimum 40% small business objective set for the contract.

NMCI quickly suffered some widely publicized setbacks, including rollout delays that caused HP financial losses. Today, NMCI is described in documents from the Navy&#x27;s chief information officer as &quot;the core enterprise network for Navy and Marine Corps forces in the United States and Japan, providing secure access to integrated voice, video and data communications.&quot;

In 2009 NMCI became the first network to deploy the Global Address List (GAL), a multiservice address list that increases interoperability by enabling Navy and Marine Corps users to access the Defense Information Systems Agency&#x27;s Joint Enterprise Directory Services (JEDS) contact list.

Additional improvements to network performance are also underway with the deployment of the Network Operations Common Operating Picture (NetOps COP). The tool helps provide enhanced situational awareness via increased information sharing and collaboration to commanders by giving them a common picture of network performance. Commanders can see scheduled maintenance tasks and other issues impacting the network, giving them the option to defer work that might affect the flow of critical information from the battlefield.

Work in 2008 has increased NMCI&#x27;s ability to respond to security issues and the program was the first network to implement fully the Department of Defense information assurance standards in both classified and unclassified environments. Among the enhancements were the deployment of Websense content filtering, an information assurance tool designed to inspect and block inbound Web traffic containing malicious code with little impact to the user. According to NMCI public affairs, &quot;Websense allows the Network Operational Commands to set a tailored blocking policy by content such as gambling, hate speech or adult content, rather than blocking specific sites or URLs only. This allows the network operators to block sites much more efficiently and outsources the fight against the growing amount of inappropriate content.&quot;

According to the Navy, Websense enables users to block or unblock sites, based on emerging and/or dynamic threats. The NMCI blocking policy is determined by various operational commands, such as the Naval Network Warfare Command, and enforced by the Global Network Operations Center, based in Norfolk. Blocked sites are redirected to a notification page which then links to a page on NMCI&#x27;s homeport Web site. On this site, a user can submit a request that a site be unblocked in order to support mission requirements.

In addition, NMCI is upgrading existing servers with Bluecoat proxy servers, which provides better capacity and traffic management functions. According to NMCI&#x27;s own data, a few users account for the majority of NMCI&#x27;s bandwidth usage, mostly attributed to streaming internet radio and video. New servers will allow bandwidth usage monitoring, down to a command or user level.

The security upgrades have been well received by the Navy. On 31 March 2009, Rear Admiral (Ret.) John A. Gauss, Acquisition Director for the NGEN System Program Office (SPO) said during a press conference that &quot;NMCI is the most secure network within the Navy.&quot;

The Navy and HP measure end-user satisfaction through a series of quarterly satisfaction surveys. End user satisfaction has steadily improved, reaching a high of nearly 86% in February 2008, as compared to 80% in December 2006. This is largely due to the upgrade of nearly 112,000 desktop and laptop computers in 2007, and a combination of network enhancements that are improving speed and reliability. HP is on track to upgrade another 120,000 seats in 2008 at Navy and Marine Corps bases in the US and Asia.

Working in tandem with the technology refresh are the virtualization efforts on the network. NMCI is on track to move from 2,700 servers down to roughly 300. The efforts are expected to save more than $1.6 million per year in electricity costs. Additionally, the decrease in the number of servers being refreshed will lower the cost of updating the equipment, leading to a potential savings of at least $1.5 million over four years.

A highlight of the Navy&#x27;s virtualization efforts was its win of InfoWorld&#x27;s 2009 Green 15 Award, which honors 15 companies and/or organizations for their green IT projects. Ted Samson, Senior Analyst for InfoWorld said of the honorees, &quot;This year&#x27;s Green 15 winners demonstrate, once again, that green IT projects can be a win-win proposition. These organizations have not only helped the planet by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, preserving trees, and keeping e-waste out of landfills. They&#x27;ve also reaped measurable business benefits, such as significantly lower electricity bills, fewer hardware refreshes, and postponed datacenter-expansion projects – along with gains in efficiency and productivity.&quot;

In 2006, the NMCI program office was criticized for its annual customer-satisfaction surveys. Officials refuse to release the raw data, leading to accusations that their conclusions are overly sunny. One NMCI director, Rear Admiral James B. Godwin III, said releasing the results would challenge the &quot;integrity of our data.&quot;

The Department of the Navy has shown no desire to scale back or cancel the program. On 24 March 2006 the Navy exercised its three-year, $3 billion option to extend the contract through September 2010.

In April 2006, users began to log on with Common Access Cards (CACs), a smartcard-based logon system called the Cryptographic Log On (CLO). In October 2008, NMCI&#x27;s prime contractor HP posted a set of procedures so Apple Mac users can access NMCI&#x27;s public-facing Web services, such as the e-mail and calendar functions, using their CAC readers with their Macs. The workaround also works with other Defense Department CAC-enabled networks. Alternatively, NMCI and all other CAC-authenticated DoD websites may be accessed using LPS-Public.

After early challenges, the Navy is pleased with the performance and security of the NMCI network. According to Captain Tim Holland, program manager for the Navy&#x27;s Next Generation Enterprise Network (NGEN), &quot;NMCI is very robust today—we have good security with it, very good performance.&quot; In an interview the DoN CIO Robert J. Carey stated, &quot;The plan is that NGEN &lt;Next Generation Enterprise Network &gt; will be in place before the NMCI contract expires because it is not a renewable contract. According to the Navy, NMCI will serve as the baseline from which it will transition to NGEN.

The Navy&#x27;s confidence in NMCI today marks a significant turnaround from the challenges cited in the GAO’s report of December 2006. The report states that &quot; NMCI has not met its two strategic goals—to provide information superiority and to foster innovation via interoperability and shared services.&quot; The document also goes on to evaluate HP&#x27;s performance, &quot;GAO&#x27;s analysis of available performance data, however, showed that the Navy had met only 3 of 20 performance targets (15 percent) associated with the program&#x27;s goals and nine related performance categories.&quot;

In contrast are the more recent comments from Vice Admiral Harry B. Harris Jr., deputy chief of naval operations for communication networks (OPNAV N-6) and deputy chief information officer, Department of the Navy. &quot;I believe that NMCI in 2008 is achieving much of what we had hoped NMCI would achieve. It&#x27;s leveled the playing field for security. It&#x27;s allowed us to do things like push security patches that go through the whole enterprise that&#x27;s on NMCI. If you look at NMCI historically, it was probably the first step for the Navy to move into what was then called Joint Vision 2010 and now is Joint Vision 2020. It&#x27;s actually done that, and it&#x27;s moving the Navy toward the U.S. Defense Department&#x27;s goal of information superiority. So, I see a lot of good things with NMCI.&quot;

NMCI works today and it continues to improve as user needs evolve and technology opportunities arise. During the final two years of the contract, technology initiatives included new hardware, applications, and services to support the Navy and Marine Corps&#x27; advanced IT needs. HP will install more than 110,000 new laptops and desktops, and will push more upgrades to improve end-users&#x27; IT capabilities through upgraded machine capacity, new operating systems, and new service lines.

==Today==

The Naval Enterprise Networks (NEN) program office, in collaboration with NMCI partner HP, which manages the CoSC program, is deploying a number of new Navy initiatives, including:
Tablet laptops for Navy recruiters
* The NRC began rolling out Hewlett-Packard (HP) Elitebook 2740p Tablets to recruiters in early September 2011.
Hosted Virtual Desktop (HVD) capability
* Thin-client HVDs using network storage will replace bulkier traditional workstations.
Expanded support for smartcards
* Two-factor authentication using a SIPRNET smartcard token will be used to confirm the identity of NMCI users.
Enterprise-wide operating system upgrade and improved end-user hardware delivery times
* New five-day seat deployment initiative aims to speed up the delivery time of new workstations.

==Next steps==

On 31 March 2009, the Department of the Navy&#x27;s Space and Naval Warfare System Command announced its intention to negotiate a Continuity of Service Contract (COSC) that would allow HP to continue to provide IT services during the transition from the existing contract (NMCI) to the proposed next contract, known as Next Generation Enterprise Network Solution (NGEN).

Under the new contract, HP will continue NMCI services, support the transition to NGEN (which includes various engineering services), and give the Navy licenses for the network&#x27;s operations and infrastructure. A chief goal of the new contract is to ensure that the network remains up-and-running while the Navy pursues the goals of NGEN.

As Rear Admiral John Goodwin, assistant chief of naval operations of NGEN notes, &quot;My responsibilities are to synchronize the efforts of the operations, the policy, the programming, the resources and the acquisition piece,&quot; Goodwin said.

==Network security and functionality==

In November 2007, a quarterly user satisfaction rating between both the United States Marine Corps and the United States Navy revealed that 83.8 percent of the military members who submitted the survey said that NMCI was satisfactory. Some of the 17 percent who were not satisfied were vocal in their disapproval.

Disgruntled users nicknamed NMCI &quot;No More Contracted Infosystems,&quot; according to an article in the Marine Corps Times. Some users also complain that they are not able to access all the Web sites they want, like box.net and npr.org. Senior officers said they enacted the worldwide ban on these types of sites out of concern that the rapidly increasing use of these sites threatened to overwhelm the military&#x27;s private Internet network and risk the disclosure of combat-sensitive material.

NMCI&#x27;s (per DoD requirements) need for security results in longer boot-up times for computers on the network than on non-network computers. HP claims to be accelerating its technology refresh activities which include deploying new, faster computers which should improve performance while maintaining tight security.

Though technical support has improved dramatically, and though HP&#x27;s help desk earned high praise from many survey respondents in 2007, some NMCI users felt that their wait times were excessive when they called the help desk. Further, because NMCI&#x27;s first priority was to rein in the counterproductive customization and proliferation of applications and networks, users are not given permissions to change computers’ settings. Some servicemen and women are unhappy with the fact that they are not given permission to administer the system from the user level.

NMCI requires that only network administrators perform all maintenance and support to ensure uniform security and capabilities across the network. Some users find that requirement cumbersome and claim that wait times to resolve even the smallest of issues are too long.

Despite early challenges, NMCI will be the foundation on which the Navy and Marine Corps can build to support their broader strategic information management objectives.

The U.S. Naval Institute reports that &quot;Complaints about NMCI speed and reliability are near-constant&quot; and a wired.com piece quotes an NMCI employee as saying:

&quot;I still work for the NMCI and I have to say that I honestly have a hard time looking sailors in the eye when I’m out and about because I’m so ashamed of the job that’s done. I’ve never seen more disregard for the well-being of a customer than I have at HP. We’re given sub-standard tools and people that are hired off the street that have NO computer knowledge. There is absolutely no incentive or upward advancement, and on top of that, there have been pay cuts since HP took over. They aren’t retaining any talented individuals, and it shows. We’re understaffed. We were working mandatory overtime for almost a year (10-11 months). Now that’s been eliminated since it’s no longer cost effective to care about the users for the remainder of this contract seeing as how the new contract has been signed and made official...Stretched for resources as they are, people like me are pulled from their normal duties (dealing with customer issues, training agents, and completing order requests) to just answer basic Service Desk calls. When this happens, we worsen our situation because there’s a major loss in training and resolution time. Agents that I know that have been resourced to working e-mail backlog have said that there is a 15 day turnaround time for nothing more than a response back...We’re digging ourselves into a hole that we can’t possibly hope to get out of ethically, and I shudder to think of what it’s going to take to even restore ourselves back to the position of a semi-effective source of troubleshooting and support for our customers.&quot;

Additionally, a govinfo.gov article mentions several perceived NMCI inadequacies, e.g. &quot;NMCI response time is slow both on- and off-site&quot; and &quot; &#x27;reach back&#x27; to legacy systems through NMCI is slow, sometimes taking 45 minutes to open a document.&quot;

It was reported that NMCI was breached by Iranian cyber warfare efforts. NMCI&#x27;s performance and reliability has been criticized by its user base, as evidenced by sailors and marines initially claiming that the acronym stood for “No More Computer Information.”

In terms of transparency relating to NMCI&#x27;s user satisfaction surveys, unofficial US government IT news site gcn.com reports &quot;Since the surveys began a few years ago, the NMCI program office has steadfastly declined to release a complete copy of the questionnaire, instead just issuing a release about the results.&quot;

<doc id="870798" wikidata="Q3228929" url="?curid=870798" title="Lee Roy Selmon">
<text>Lee Roy Selmon (October 20, 1954 – September 4, 2011) was an American professional football player who was a defensive end for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers of the National Football League (NFL). He played college football as a defensive tackle at the University of Oklahoma, the youngest of three brothers to play football there.

He was a consensus All-American in 1974 and 1975 and a member of consecutive national championship teams for the Oklahoma Sooners in 1974 and 1975.

Selmon was selected by the expansion Buccaneers as the first overall pick in the 1976 NFL draft. He played in the NFL for nine seasons, from 1976 to 1984, all with the Buccaneers.

Selmon joined the athletic department at the University of South Florida in 1993 and served as the school&#x27;s athletic director from 2001 to 2004. He was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988, the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1995, and the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 2009.

==Early life==
Selmon was the youngest of nine children of Lucious and Jessie Selmon, raised on a farm near Eufaula, Oklahoma. A National Honor Society member at Eufaula High School, he graduated in 1972 after playing football through high school. His two brothers also played football and went to the University of Oklahoma, which he attended and where he graduated.

==College career==
In 1972, Selmon joined his brothers Lucious and Dewey Selmon in playing on the defensive line at the University of Oklahoma. He blossomed into a star in 1974, anchoring one of the best defenses in Oklahoma Sooners football history. The Sooners were national champions in 1974 and 1975. Selmon won the Lombardi Award and the Outland Trophy in 1975. Oklahoma head coach Barry Switzer called him the best player he ever coached, and &quot;College Football News&quot; placed him as the 21st-best college player of all time.

Selmon was known as &quot;The Gentle Giant.&quot; In the fall of 1999, Selmon was named to the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; &#x27;NCAA Football All-Century Team.&#x27;

Selmon was named a consensus All-American in 1974 and 1975 by Newspaper Enterprise Association. His list of achievements include the National Football Foundation Scholar-Athlete, GTE/CoSIDA Academic All-American, and Graduate Fellowship Winner National Football Foundation and Hall of Fame. The 1996 Walter Camp &quot;Alumnus of the Year&quot; was voted to the Oklahoma Sports Hall of Fame in 1992.

===Statistics===
==Professional career==
In 1976, Selmon was the first player picked in the NFL draft, the first-ever pick for the expansion Tampa Bay Buccaneers. He was joined by his older brother, Dewey, who was a second-round pick of the Bucs. In his first year, Selmon won the team&#x27;s &#x27;Rookie of the Year&#x27; and MVP awards. Selmon played in six straight Pro Bowls and was named NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1979. Buccaneer assistant Abe Gibron said, &quot;Selmon has no peers&quot; at defensive end, while former Detroit Lions coach Monte Clark compared him to &quot;a grown man at work among a bunch of boys&quot;.

Selmon began his career on a team that lost its first 26 games in franchise history (including a winless inaugural season) and only won a total of seven games in his first three seasons. However, he helped the Bucs rebound to three playoff appearances in four years from 1979 to 1982.

A back injury forced him to leave at the end of the 1984 season; the Bucs retired his number, 63, in 1986. He was elected to the Florida Sports Hall of Fame. In January 2008, Selmon was voted by a panel of former NFL players and coaches to &quot;Pro Football Weekly&quot;″s All-Time 3-4 defensive team along with Harry Carson, Curley Culp, Randy Gradishar, Howie Long, Lawrence Taylor and Andre Tippett. He was the first player to be inducted into the Tampa Bay Buccaneers&#x27; Ring of Honor on November 8, 2009.

==After football==
Selmon stayed in Tampa, Florida, working as a bank executive and being active in many charities.

From 1993 to 2001, Selmon served as an assistant athletic director at the University of South Florida under Paul Griffin. After Griffin was forced to resign, Selmon was promoted to take over the athletic department. As the USF Athletic Director, Selmon launched the football program, spearheaded the construction of a new athletic facility, and led the university&#x27;s move into Conference USA, and into the Big East Conference.

Citing health issues, Selmon resigned as the USF Athletic Director in 2004. He took the role as president of the USF Foundation Partnership for Athletics, an athletics fund-raising organization.

==Awards and honors==
*Selmon was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1988.
*In 1995, he was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, becoming the first Hall of Famer to have earned his credentials primarily in Tampa Bay. (He was later joined by Warren Sapp in 2013 and Derrick Brooks in 2014.)
*Also in 1995, Selmon became the first Buccaneer, former or current, to participate in a Super Bowl when he joined the coin toss ceremonies for Super Bowl XXIX, joining fellow Class of 1995 members Kellen Winslow and then-U.S. Congressman Steve Largent who flipped the coin to end the ceremonies, along with 75th Anniversary team members Ray Nitschke (representing Henry Jordan who was inducted posthumously), Mean Joe Greene, Otto Graham and Gale Sayers.
*In 2010, he was ranked #98 on the top 100 greatest players of all time, as surveyed by NFL Network.
*In 2012, Selmon was posthumously inducted into the University of South Florida Athletic Hall of Fame.
*The Lee Roy Selmon Expressway is named for him.
*The chain restaurants, Lee Roy Selmon&#x27;s, was named for him. As of 2018, all seven locations were no longer in business.

==Death==
Selmon suffered a massive stroke on September 2, 2011, which left him hospitalized in extremely critical condition. His restaurant initially released a statement announcing his death; however, this was later confirmed to be false. In fact, at one point his condition was said to be improving.

On September 4, 2011, Selmon died at the age of 56 from complications of the stroke. Visitation was scheduled for the following Thursday at the Exciting Central Tampa Baptist Church. The funeral was held the next day at Idlewild Baptist Church. Former teammates, the current Buccaneer team, the USF football team, other members of the NFL, and the general public attended. The USF football team wore a #63 decal on their helmets for the 2011 season, as did the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Both teams conducted a ceremony to honor Selmon the weekend following his death. He is buried in Trice Hill Cemetery in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

<doc id="870806" wikidata="Q630689" url="?curid=870806" title="Bongo Flava">
<text>Bongo Flava is a nickname for Tanzanian music. The genre was developed in the 1990s, mainly as a derivative of American hip hop and traditional Tanzanian styles such as taarab and dansi. Lyrics are usually in Swahili or English.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Bongo&quot; in Bongo Flava comes from Kiswahili usually meaning &quot;brains, intelligence, cleverness&quot;. Bongo is the augmentative form of &quot;Ubongo&quot;, a Swahili word for Brain. Flava is a Swahili term for &quot;Flavour&quot;. Bongo is a term which was originally used to refer the Tanzanian city of Dar es Salaam. Outside Tanzania, Bongo is often referring to Tanzania. Bongo as a term originated in the late 70&#x27;s during a very difficult time following both the global fuel shocks of the 70&#x27;s and the Kagera war against Uganda. The term Bongo was being used as a clever way to say both, survival in Dar es Salaam required both brain and intelligence.

In 1981 musician Remmy Ongala joined a band called Orchestra Super Matimila. Each band had a unique &quot;mtindo&quot; (style/fashion) and Remmy Ongala&#x27;s band Matimila named their mtindo &quot;Bongo Beat&quot;. Remmy Ongala would later become the most famous musician ever for Tanzania, reaching global fame working with English singer Peter Gabriel.

== History ==
Bongo Flava is a large divergent evolution of &quot;muziki wa kizazi kipya&quot;, meaning &quot;music of the new generations&quot;, which originated in the middleclass youth of Kinondoni District, in Dar es Salaam between the mid-1980s and 1990s. Taji Liundi, also known as Master T, the original creator and producer of the Dj Show program had already started airing songs by fledgling local artists by late 1994. Radio hosts Mike Muhagama and Taji Liundi led the way in radio support of local artists. Mike Mhagama eventually joined the popular program as an under-study to Taji Liundi and also went on to produce and present the show alone after Taji Liundi left Radio One in 1996.

&quot;Bongo Flava&quot; existed well before the first audio or video recordings. The youth in Dar es Salaam were rapping at beach concerts (organized by Joseph Kusaga and the late Ruge Mutahaba, who together own Mawingu Discotheque, Mawingu Studios and now Clouds Media Group), local concert halls and taking part in the first official rap competition called Yo! Rap Bonanza series that were promoted by Abdulhakim &quot;DJ Kim&quot; Magomelo under his promotion company &quot;Kim &amp; The Boyz&quot;.

Some of the youth were organized with fancy names, some were solo or formed impromptu groups at the event to get a chance to perform. An icon of the open performance artists in the early 1990s was Adili or Nigga One. The first influential dub artiste of the genre was Saleh Jabir who rapped in Kiswahili over the instrumentals of Vanilla Ice&#x27;s, &quot;Ice Ice Baby&quot;, he was solely responsible for making Kiswahili a viable language to rap in. His version was so popular that broke ranks by receiving mild airplay in the conservative National Radio Tanzania, thus making the first rap song on Tanzanian radio.

One of the earliest groups to actually record and deliver a CD to Radio One for airing was Mawingu Band, an outfit that became hugely popular in early 1994. They recorded at Mawingu Studios. Its members were Othman Njaidi, Eliudi Pemba, Columba Mwingira, Sindila Assey, Angela, Robert Chuwa, Boniface Kilosa (a.k.a. Dj Boni Love) and later Pamela who sang the famous hook of their breakthrough first RnB/Rap single &quot;Oya Msela&quot;. The song was so popular and ahead of its time that the Msela label stuck. &#x27;Msela&#x27; is the Swahili word for &#x27;ruffian&#x27;.

== Concerts and festivals ==
Since its inception, concerts and festivals in many ways have helped to push Bongo Flava and help surge its popularity. One of the first such festival is Fiesta organized by Clouds Media Group, where Bongo Flava artists usually go on a music tour in different Tanzanian regions. Throughout the years, Fiesta has been an instrument in spreading the Bongo Flava wave across Tanzania. 

Diamond Platnumz, &quot;Ali Kiba, Rayvanny, Marioo, Country Wizzy, Kusah, Rich Mavoko, Nandy,&quot; &quot;Phina, Ben Pol&quot; are few of Tanzanian artists that have performed on the Fiesta stage.

==Popularity==
Today, &quot;Bongo Flava&quot; is the most popular musical style amongst the Tanzanian youth, something that is also reflected in the vast number of TV and radio programs dedicated to this genre as well as the sales figures of bongo flava albums.

Outside of its historical home of Tanzania, Bongo Flava has become a resoundingly popular sound in neighboring, culturally related countries such as Kenya and Uganda. Bongo Flava has even found a home outside of the African continent; the most popular artists in the genre have recently begun to address Western markets and the self-proclaimed &quot;best internet station for Bongo Flava,&quot; Bongo Radio, happens to be based out of Chicago, Illinois. There are now also playlists dedicate to the genre of global streaming platforms such as iTunes and Spotify, increasing Bongo-Flava&#x27;s visibility.

Despite the popularity of &quot;Bongo Flava&quot; and the large number of well-known artists throughout Tanzania, copying of music is widespread due to the weak enforcement of copyright laws, and most artistes are unable to make a living selling their music. Instead, most rely on income from live performances to support themselves, or income from other business ventures, using their social influence as leverage. However, there are instances of &#x27;success stories&#x27;, the career of artist Diamond Platnumz, and producer-artist Nahreel are often cited as sources of inspiration for many artists and producers 

Bongo Flava started to make waves across Africa in major markets such as Nigeria, Ghana and South Africa around 2014 when Diamond Platnumz released his smash hit My Number One and its accompanying remix featuring Nigerian star, Davido. It was also around that time that different African based music channels began to give heavy rotation to Bongo Flava songs rom different heavyweights such as Diamond Platnumz, Vanessa Mdee, Joh Makini, Navy Kenzo and more.

Since then different Bongo Flava stars started working with different Nigerian superstars. The international collaborations has made it possible for Bongo Flava to be popular in other countries. Diamond Platnumz, for example, has worked with different heavyweight superstars such as KCEE, Rema, Chike, Koffi Olomide, Adekunle Gold, Omarion, Morgan Heritage and more.

Harmonize, another heavyweight Tanzanian star has worked with different music heavyweights in his efforts to popularize Bongo Flava. Harmonize has worked with different heavyweights such as Awilo Longomba, Spice, Sarkodie, Korede Bello, Naira Marley, Yemi Alade and more 

==Characteristics==
While &quot;Bongo Flava&quot; is clearly related to American hip hop, it is also clearly distinguished from its Western counterpart. As the bongoflava.net website puts it, &quot;these guys don&#x27;t need to copy their brothers in America, but have a sure clear sense of who they are and what sound it is they&#x27;re making&quot;. The sound &quot;has its roots in the rap, R&amp;B and hip hop coming from America, but from the beginning, these styles have been pulled apart and put back together with African hands&quot;.

The typical &quot;Bongo Flava&quot; artist identifies with the &quot;mselah&quot;. It is in this sense that, for example, members of the hip hop crew Afande Sele call themselves &quot;watu pori&quot;, i.e., &quot;men of the savannah&quot;. A sort of manifesto of mselah ideology is given by the song &quot;Mselah Jela&quot; by Bongo flava singer Juma Nature, who defines a mselah, amongst other things, as an &quot;honest person of sincere heart&quot;. Following the tradition of western hip hop (as represented by the pioneering hip hop group Afrika Bambaataa), bongo flava lyrics usually tackle social and political issues such as poverty, political corruption, superstition, and HIV/AIDS, often with a more or less explicit educational intent, an approach that is sometimes referred to as &quot;edutainment&quot;. Afande Sele, for example, have written songs that are intended to teach prevention of malaria and HIV. However, this has changed in recent years and increasingly many commercial Bongo Flava songs deal with topics such as love, heartbreak, success and hardship. This change in topic remains a point of contention between the earlier generation who saw the rise of Bongo Flava, and the new generation who tend to prefer catchy and club ready songs. Whether this is due to globalisation and western influence or due to a change in listener&#x27;s taste, is the question at the centre of the debate. Some Bongo groups are very popular within their ethnic group; one example is the Maasai X Plastaz who developed their own subgenre known as &quot;Maasai hip hop&quot;.

== Bongopiano ==
Bongopiano blends bongo flava music and amapiano, emerging in Tanzania in the 2020s. Key figures of bongopiano include Diamond Platnumz, Alikiba, Natasha, Pride Boy 4Real, Marioo, Harmonize, Nandy, Jux, Mbosso and Zuchu.

<doc id="870808" wikidata="Q158791" url="?curid=870808" title=".454 Casull">
<text>The .454 Casull () is a firearm cartridge, developed as a wildcat cartridge in 1958 by Dick Casull, Duane Marsh and Jack Fullmer. It was announced in November 1959 by &quot;Guns &amp; Ammo&quot; magazine. The design is a lengthened and structurally improved .45 Colt case. The wildcat cartridge went mainstream when Freedom Arms brought a single action five-shot revolver chambered in .454 Casull to the retail firearms market in 1983. Ruger followed in 1997, chambering its Super Redhawk in this caliber. Taurus followed with the Raging Bull model in 1998 and the Taurus Raging Judge Magnum in 2010.
The .45 Schofield and .45 Colt cartridges can fit into the .454&#x27;s chambers, but not the other way around because of the lengthened case (very similar to the relationship between .38 Special and .357 Magnum cartridges, as well as the .44 Special and .44 Magnum cartridges).

==Specifications==
The .454 Casull was finally commercialized in 1997, when SAAMI published its first standards for the cartridge. The new Casull round uses a small rifle primer rather than a pistol primer, because it develops extremely high chamber pressures of over 50,000 CUP (copper units of pressure) (410 MPa), which are rifle levels of pressure. It requires the use of a rifle primer to withstand those significantly greater pressures, blurring the distinction of it being a pistol or a rifle cartridge.

The round is one of the most powerful handgun cartridges in production. The .454 Casull generates almost five times the recoil of the .45 Colt, and about 75% more recoil energy than the .44 Magnum. It can deliver a 250 grain (16 g) bullet with a muzzle velocity of over 1,900 feet per second (580 m/s), developing up to 2,000 ft-lb (2.7 kJ) of energy from a handgun. One Buffalo Bore loading drives a heavier, 300 grain, JFN bullet at 1,650 ft/s for 1,813 ft-lb of muzzle energy. The .454 Casull round is primarily intended for hunting medium or large game, metallic silhouette shooting, and bear protection.

The Casull cartridges were originally loaded with a triplex load of propellants, which gave progressive burning, aided by the rifle primer ignition, resulting in a progressive acceleration of the bullet as it passed through the barrel.

==Similar cartridges==

The first commercially available revolver chambered in .454 Casull was made by Freedom Arms in 1983 as a five-shot single action Model 83 revolver that is capable of firing .45 ACP, .45 Colt and .454 Casull with interchangeable cylinders. The .460 Smith &amp; Wesson Magnum cartridge introduced in 2005 is a lengthened .454 Casull cartridge and has the same diameter as a .45 Colt or .454 Casull. Therefore, revolvers chambered for .460 S&amp;W will also chamber .454 Casull, .45 Colt, and .45 Schofield (.45 Smith &amp; Wesson).

<text>The Olympic Athletic Center of Athens [[Spiros Louis]] (, &quot;Olympiakó Athlitikó Kéntro Athinón &quot;Spýros Loúis&quot;&quot;) or OACA (OAKA)), is a sport facilities complex located at Marousi, in the north section of the city. The complex consists of five major venues as well as other supplementary sport facilities.

The Olympic Athletic Center of Athens has hosted the Mediterranean Games in 1991, the World Championship in Athletics in 1997 as well as other important athletic and cultural events. The most significant event the Athens Olympic Sports Complex has hosted, was the Olympic Games. OACA was the main venue for the Athens Olympic Games in 2004. The complex was revamped for the games under a design produced by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.

==Venues==
===Spyros Louis Athens Olympic Stadium===

The stadium, built in 1982 and extensively refurbished for the games in 2004, including the addition of a roof, hosted the athletics events and the soccer final, as well as the Opening Ceremony on August 13, 2004 and the Closing Ceremony on August 29, 2004.The venue also hosted the same events during the 2004 Summer Paralympics.

===Nikos Galis Olympic Indoor Hall===

The Nikos Galis Olympic Indoor Hall (also known simply as the Indoor Hall) was completed in 1995, and was the largest indoor venue in use for sporting events at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. It is part of the Athens Olympic Sports Complex, in the suburb of Maroussi. The arena was used for artistic gymnastics and trampolining and also hosted the finals of the basketball matches at the games. On May 18 and 20, 2006, the Olympic Indoor Hall hosted the 51st Eurovision Song Contest, that was held in Athens after Greece&#x27;s victory at the Song Contest in 2005.

===Athens Olympic Aquatic Centre ===
===Athens Olympic Velodrome===
===Athens Olympic Tennis Centre===

==Transportation to and from the venue==
The Athens Olympic Sports Complex can be reached by Metro [stations &quot;Neratziotissa&quot; and &quot;Irini&quot; of Metro Line 1 (Green Line)], by suburban train (Proastiakos station &quot;Neratziotissa&quot;), or by direct bus lines [A7 (Stournari – Kifissia), 602 (N. Ionia – Kalogreza – Panormou Metro Station), 550 (P. Faliro – Kifissia).

==Legacy==
While it was reported in 2008 that almost all of the Olympic venues utilized for the 2004 games, including certain facilities in the Sports Complex such as the velodrome and tennis center, have fallen into varying states of dereliction or disrepair, all of the facilities in the Athens Olympic Sports Complex are still in use today.

The table below illustrates how the Athens Olympic Sports Complex facilities are used today:

<text>The Rotorua Caldera is a large rhyolitic caldera that is filled by Lake Rotorua. It was formed by an eruption 240,000 years ago that produced extensive pyroclastic deposits. Smaller eruptions have occurred in the caldera since, the most recent less than 25,000 years ago. It is one of several large volcanoes in the Taupō Volcanic Zone on the North Island of New Zealand.

==Geography==

The major regional settlement of Rotorua city is located in the caldera. There is geothermal activity in the city, and the geothermal areas of Tikitere and Whakarewarewa are associated with the caldera. These areas are still associated with small hydrothermal eruptions.

==Geology==
===Eruption history===
The caldera was formed in a single event paired major eruption, lasting only weeks, that is now dated to 240,000 ± 11,000 years ago. It ejected more than of rhyolitic Mamaku ignimbrite giving it a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 7. The eruption has been reinterpreted as a paired eruption, with a very slightly later, slightly smaller southerly eruption from the same mush body that also feed the Ohakuri Caldera. Ignimbrite, up to thick covering about , was deposited in the surrounding area, particularly towards the west. A small but rather thick outcrop named Mokai Ignimbrite exposed to the south-west, but beyond the known boundaries of the much thinner at these boundaries, Mamaku ignimbrite, was erupted at close to the same time. This is likely from a different source to either the Mamaku or Ohakuri ignimbrite. A different source would explain interlayered ash not present in northern Mamaku ignimbrite but there is close composition homogeneity, suggesting a similar magma melt source. Perhaps rather than a very directional pyroclastic flow during the eruption events from a southern vent near Rotorua, this formation is explained by more complex pairing with an unknown vent in the area of the Kapenga Caldera. Whatever the Rotorua eruption was definitely paired with an eruption from the Ohakuri Caldera away, possibly through tectonic coupling, as paired events are being increasingly recognised. The ignimbrite from Ohakuri travelled at least 17 km towards Rotorua.

The outflow dense-rock equivalent (DRE) of the Mamaku ignimbrite Rotorua eruption alone was up to . The maximum DME of the Ohakuri eruption alone is .

Caldera collapse occurred particularly during the eruption of middle layer of Mamaku Ignimbrite and in later stages of the eruption as the magma chamber underneath the volcano empted. The circular depression left behind is now filled with Lake Rotorua but the current caldera is more like two ovoids offset from each other, about in maximum diameter. Mokoia Island, close to the centre of the lake, is a rhyolite dome that later erupted. There are other domes, including Hinemoa Point, Ngongotahā, Pohaturoa and Pukeroa.

The most recent magmatic eruption occurred less than 25,000 years ago, creating some of the smaller lava domes. Mokoia Island has been assigned an age of less than 50,000 years.

The first major volcanic event 240,000 years ago was the initial Mamaku eruption followed within an hours/days/weeks of a smaller eruption (phase 1) from the same mush body feeding the Ohakuri Caldera about {{convert|30|km|abbr=on}} to the south. Ignimbrite, up to {{convert|180|m}} thick was deposited in the surrounding area to the south of Rotorua. Between Rotorua and Ohakuri, crosssections of the ash and ignimbrite from the two eruptions have been able to be sequenced completely. The layers have relationships that can only be explained by a sequence of eruptions separated on occasions by days or less (e.g. no rainfall between eruptions). The pairing was possibly through tectonic coupling of separate magma bodies that co-evolved from a lower in the mantle common mush body, as paired events are being increasingly recognised. The maximum outflow dense-rock equivalent (DRE) of the Ohakuri ignimbrite is {{convert|100|km3|mi3|abbr=off}} which means the combined eruptions produced {{convert|245|km3}} of material.
It has been postulated that the drainage of the linked deep magma mush body between Rotorua and Ohakuri resulted in more than {{convert|250|m}} of vertical displacement on the Horohoro Fault scarp. This formed the Paeroa Graben, coincident to the north with the Kapenga Caldera between it and the Paeroa Fault to the east. The formation is known as the Horohoro Cliffs escarpment and displaced Mamaku ignimbrite from the Rotorua Caldera eruption by this amount, presumably shortly after at least the initial the eruption. This fault, in the present day, while active has a much lower displacement rate of the order of {{convert|0.14|mm}}/year. It has been assigned by some as the outer western fault of the modern Taupō Rift although most think this is further to the east. Understanding that there is volcanotectonic interrelationship lead to a complete reinterpretation of events in the Taupō Volcanic Zone in the last 250,000 years.

<doc id="870816" wikidata="Q952163" url="?curid=870816" title="Fuji Five Lakes">
<text>is the name of the area located at the base of Mount Fuji in the Yamanashi Prefecture of Japan. It has a population of about 100,000 and sits about above sea level. The five lakes created in the area by previous eruptions of Mount Fuji has given the area its name. The principal city in the region, Fujiyoshida, has a population of roughly 54,000 and is particularly famous for its udon noodles. Another point of interest is Aokigahara Jukai Forest. The Fuji Five Lakes was selected by the &quot;Tokyo Nichi Nichi Shimbun&quot; and &quot;Osaka Mainichi Shimbun&quot; as one of the Twenty-Five Winning Sites of Japan in 1927.

==Lakes of the Fuji Five Lakes==

The five lakes are located in an arc around the northern half of Mount Fuji. In ancient times, lava flow from a volcanic eruption of Mount Fuji spread across the area, damming up rivers and resulting in the formation of these lakes. They are all considered excellent tourist attractions and fishing spots.

===Lake Kawaguchi===
Lake Kawaguchi (河口湖 Kawaguchi-ko) is the most famous of the five lakes, and images of this lake are usually used in posters and commercials for the Fuji Five Lakes area. A large number of hotels line its banks, as do locals providing boat rides to the tourists. It is the only lake in the Fuji Five Lakes area that has an island. Many local cultural events are held near this lake throughout the year.

===Lake Motosu===
Lake Motosu (本栖湖 Motosu-ko) is the ninth deepest lake of Japan, at . This lake, along with Lake Sai and Lake Shōji, was formed by lava flowing across what is now Aokigahara Jukai Forest and into the enormous lake that once dominated the area, and these three lakes remain still connected by underground waterways.

===Lake Sai ===
The western side of Sai (西湖 Sai-ko) shares its banks with the infamous Aokigahara Jukai Forest.

===Lake Shōji===
Lake Shōji (精進湖 Shōji-ko) is the smallest of the five lakes. Remnants of lava flow still jut out of the water. Locals usually fish from these rocks.

===Lake Yamanaka===
The easternmost and largest of the five lakes, Lake Yamanaka (山中湖 Yamanaka-ko) is also the third highest lake in Japan, standing at above sea level.

==Tourism industry==
Most of the capital coming into the area comes from the tourism industry. Approximately 100,000,000,000 yen is spent by 9,000,000 sightseers every year. The main attractions of the area include:
* Mount Fuji
* Onsens
* Fuji-Q Highland – an amusement park featuring one of the world&#x27;s highest roller coasters.
* The lakes – sightseeing, sailing, and fishing.
* Hiking and mountain climbing.
* Village of Healing (いやしの里 iyashinosato)– a historically accurate, rebuilt Japanese village.

<text>The .45 Colt (11.43×33mmR), often called the .45 Long Colt, is a rimmed straight-walled handgun cartridge dating to 1872. It was originally a black-powder revolver round developed for the Colt Single Action Army revolver. This cartridge was adopted by the U.S. Army in 1873 and served as an official US military handgun cartridge for 19 years, before being replaced by the .38 Long Colt in 1892. Although there has never been a &quot;.45 Short Colt&quot; cartridge, the .45 Colt is frequently called the &quot;.45 Long Colt&quot; (.45 LC) to better distinguish it from the shorter and less powerful .45 Schofield cartridge, which was also in use around the same time as the .45 Colt.

There is no difference between .45 Colt rnd, and .45 long Colt. It is sometimes called a Long Colt to differentiate between itself and the .45 ACP.

==History==

The .45 Colt was a joint development between Colt&#x27;s Patent Firearms Manufacturing Company (now known as Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company), of Hartford, Connecticut, and the Union Metallic Cartridge Company (UMC) of Bridgeport, Connecticut. Colt began work on the revolver in 1871, and submitted a sample to the U.S. Army in late 1872. The revolver was accepted for purchase in 1873.

The cartridge is an inside lubricated type. The rebated heel type bullet design of its predecessor, the .44 Colt (.452–.454&quot; diameter bullet), was eliminated, since it was an outside lubricated type, which would pick up dirt and grit during handling. The .45 Colt replaced the .50 caliber Model 1871 Remington single shot pistol and the various cap-and-ball revolvers converted to take metallic cartridges in use at the time. While the Colt remained popular, the Smith &amp; Wesson M1875 Army Schofield Revolver was approved as an alternate, which created a logistical problem for the Army. The S&amp;W revolver used the .45 Schofield, a shorter cartridge, which would also work in the Colt, however the Army&#x27;s S&amp;W Schofield revolvers could not chamber the longer .45 Colt, so in 1874 Frankford Arsenal, then almost exclusive supplier of small arms ammunition to the U.S. Army, dropped production of the .45 Colt cartridge in favor of the .45 Schofield cartridge. This resolved the Army&#x27;s ammunition logistics problems, but there were still plenty of the longer Colt-length cartridges in circulation once production ceased. The Benet primed .45 Revolver cartridges were subsequently replaced by the &#x27;Model of 1882 Ball Cartridge for Cal. .45 Revolver&#x27; which used an external Boxer primer and could be reloaded at the unit level. The .45 caliber M1882 cartridge would be officially replaced by the .38 Long Colt in 1892 but would remain in production until 1896. In 1901-1902, it would once again be loaded by Frankford Arsenal for use in the Philippine–American War.

In 1909, the newly adopted .45 M1909 cartridge was issued along with the .45 Colt New Service revolver. This round was never loaded commercially, and is almost identical to the original .45 Colt round, except having a larger diameter rim (.540 in (13.7mm)). The rim is large enough that it cannot be loaded in adjacent chambers in the rod-ejector Colt model.

The .45 Colt remains popular with renewed interest in Cowboy Action Shooting. Additionally, the round has seen resurgence as a cartridge in handgun hunting and Metallic Silhouette Shooting competitions, beginning in the 1950s with the introduction of stronger, heavier framed handguns. The cartridge&#x27;s popularity has also increased with the increased marketing of handguns that can also fire the .410 bore shotgun shell, such as the Taurus Judge and the S&amp;W Governor, though first seen decades earlier in the MIL Thunder 5. While the .45 ACP uses .451 inches in diameter for jacketed bullets, and .452 for lead bullets, the .45 Colt still uses .452 inch diameter jacketed bullets and .454 diameter lead bullets, often adding to the confusion between the two cartridges with similar names as the .45 ACP and Model 1911 pistols will often be called &quot;.45 Colt&quot; in common usage, leading many to call the .45 Colt the .45 &quot;Long Colt&quot; similar to how other Colt revolver cartridges were named (i.e. .38 Long Colt). The .45 Colt became the basis for other rounds, such as the .454 Casull, and in turn, the .460 S&amp;W Magnum.

==Cartridge loads==
The .45 Colt originally was a black-powder cartridge, but modern loadings use smokeless powder. The original black-powder loads called for of black powder behind an Ogival &amp; flat nosed lead bullet. These loads developed muzzle velocities of . However, this load generated too much recoil for the average soldier and was, after a few years, reduced to of black powder yielding in Army tests. Then, the introduction of the Schofield revolver with its shorter cylinder, quick loading &quot;Top-Break&quot; frame, and chambered in .45 Schofield caused a problem for the Supply Corps in that they now had to supply two different types of .45 Caliber revolver ammunition. Further troubles were caused by the fact that the Schofield cartridge rim was too wide to load into adjacent chambers in the colt cylinder, turning the Colt into a three shooter (being able to only place a round in every other chamber), if the wrong ammunition was sent to that particular outpost. So, the Army came up with a short case narrow rim cartridge that only held of black powder that could be used in both revolvers. That load gave about with a bullet out of the Schofield revolver with its shorter barrel. Because of the power of the of black powder and its excellent accuracy, the .45 Colt was known as a sure man stopper and horse killer. It became the most-used cartridge at the time of its introduction, succeeding the .44-40 Winchester.

The .45 Colt at that time did not enjoy the .44-40&#x27;s advantage of a Winchester rifle chambered for it being available, thus allowing the use of the same cartridge in both a pistol and a rifle. According to rumor at the time, this was owing to early .45 Colt cartridges having a very narrow rim that caused ejection issues from a rifle chamber. Today, modern Winchesters, Marlins, and other replicas have remedied this omission almost 50 years after the fact, and .45 Colt is now available in modern lever-action rifles.

While this aforementioned rumor has been one of the numerous arguments used to explain the lack of a rifle chambered in .45 Colt, it may have simply been a case of Colt refusing to authorize the use of their patented .45 Colt cartridge in other manufacturers’ arms. Only after the expiration of Colt‘s original patents for the .45 Colt did it become available in a rifle. This, however, does not explain the absence of a .45 Colt chambering (or indeed any of Colt&#x27;s own cartridges) in the Colt-Burgess lever-action or Colt Lightning slide-action rifles. Thus lending more credence to the rumored basic problem with Colt&#x27;s revolver cartridges when used in rifles. (The modern .45 Colt cartridge rim is still narrow, but features an extractor groove cut into the base of the case, a feature common to most modern cartridges but not at all common in the late 19th century.)

The U.S. Army&#x27;s .45 Colt round used in its M1909 revolver, which had a barrel of , fired a bullet at a muzzle velocity of , giving a muzzle energy of . Today&#x27;s standard factory loads develop around of muzzle energy at about , making it roughly equivalent to modern .45 ACP loads. There are Cowboy Action Shooting loads which develop muzzle velocities of around .

&quot;Cartridges of the World&quot; states that .45 Colt should never be loaded to more than in blackpowder revolvers.

===High pressure ammunition===
Some handloads and factory-manufactured cartridges put this round in the same class as the .44 Magnum, using specially made revolvers. These loads cannot be used in any original Colt Single Action Army or replica thereof, such as those produced by Uberti, Beretta, the Taurus Gaucho, or the Ruger New Vaquero, as these guns are built on the smaller frame with thinner cylinder walls. These loads should be used only in modern large-frame revolvers such as the Ruger Blackhawk, Ruger Redhawk, and the original large frame Ruger Vaquero (sometimes referred to as the &quot;Old Model&quot; to differentiate it from the small frame &quot;New Vaquero.&quot;)

Thompson Center Contender &quot;Magnum&quot; .45 Colt loadings can also be safely fired from any gun chambered in either the .454 Casull or .460 S&amp;W Magnum cartridges, though proper feeding may be an issue in repeating rifles chambered for either .454 Casull or .460 S&amp;W Magnum as the OAL is significantly shorter. Modern rifles with strong actions (such as the Winchester Model 1894, Marlin Model 1894, and new replicas of the Winchester Model 1892) chambered for the cartridge can safely handle the heavier loadings.

===Handloading===
Colt .45 revolvers made until early WWII had barrels with .454&quot; groove diameters. After WWII diameters of .451–.452&quot; were produced. Using .454&quot; diameter bullets in the smaller barrels will work but will generate higher pressures. Cases used with .454&quot; bullets may have to be full-length resized to work in newer guns. Speer handloading guidance states that the loads they show should be used only in handguns made specifically for modern smokeless powder. The loads mentioned in No. 10 reloading manual state that they do not exceed . This is the equivalent of +P loading as normal pressure for the .45 Colt is .

In a section specifically titled &quot;45 Colt for Ruger or Contender only&quot; Speer makes reference to velocities up to with bullets. They also state that pressures do not exceed (CUP). This is well beyond a pressure that can destroy even modern guns chambered in .45 Colt with the exception of the large frame Ruger Blackhawk, Ruger Redhawk, Freedom Arms Models 83 and 97, and Dan Wesson revolvers.

==Uses==
Colt began work on their 1873 Single Action Army Model in 1871. Sample cartridges submitted for Army tests were made by UMC, using the Benet cup primers; commercial ammunition used the Berdan-type primer, followed by the more common Boxer priming. Original UMC loads used a powder charge and bullet. This was reduced to of powder, and later, by the Army, to .

The .45 Colt cartridge remains in use years after its introduction. It is used as a hunting load on animals the size of deer and black bear. Heavier handloads will take the same range of big game animals as the .44 Magnum. Several two-barrel derringers are sold that are chambered in .45 Colt, and some of these derringers can chamber a .410 bore shotgun shell without any modifications being required. Revolvers chambered in .410 shotgun, such as the Taurus Judge and the Smith &amp; Wesson Governor, are usually chambered for the .45 Colt as well. A popular use for the .45 Colt today is in Cowboy Action Shooting, where the round is often fired from either original or replicas of the 1873 Colt Single-Action Army.

Winchester, Marlin Firearms, Henry Repeating Arms, Chiappa Firearms, Rossi, Uberti, Cimarron Firearms and other manufacturers produce lever-action rifles chambered in .45 Colt. Colt has resumed production of the Single-Action Army, and many SAA replicas and near-replicas as well as modern-design single-actions by Ruger are chambered for this cartridge.

==Influence on other cartridges==
The .45 Colt became the basis for the much more powerful .454 Casull cartridge, with the .454 Casull having a slightly longer case utilizing a small rifle primer in place of the large pistol primer. Any .454 Casull revolver will chamber and fire the .45 Colt and the .45 Schofield, but not the inverse due to the Casull&#x27;s longer case. The .460 S&amp;W Magnum is a longer version of the .454 Casull cartridge. Likewise, .460 Magnum revolvers can chamber and fire the three shorter cartridges, but again, not the reverse.

<doc id="870831" wikidata="Q1797555" url="?curid=870831" title=".38 Long Colt">
<text>The .38 Long Colt, also known as .38 LC, is a black powder centerfire cartridge introduced by Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company in 1875. In 1892, it was adopted as a standard military pistol cartridge by the United States Army for the Colt M1892 revolver. The metric designation for the .38 Long Colt is 9.1×26mm. It is slightly more powerful than the .38 Short Colt, also known as .38 SC. The original .38 SC and .38 LC differ in case length, bullet diameter, weight, and design and are not interchangeable; however, modern production .38 SC ammunition is now loaded with a smaller, internally-lubricated bullet which can be fired from firearms chambered in .38 LC or .38 Special. The &quot;modern&quot; .38 LC can be fired from a .38 Special firearm, but not from a firearm designed for the .38 SC, since the case length is too long.

==Design and ballistics==

The .38 Long Colt&#x27;s predecessor, the .38 Short Colt, used a heeled bullet of at a nominal , producing muzzle energy. The cylindrical &quot;shank&quot; or &quot;bearing surface&quot; of the bullet, just in front of the cartridge case mouth, was in diameter, the same as the outside diameter of the cartridge case (as in .22 rimfire cartridges). A smaller-diameter portion of the bullet, the &quot;heel&quot;, was crimped inside the case mouth, and the lubricant was outside the case, and exposed.

In contrast, the .38 Long Colt uses a bullet which on the outside of the cartridge case is only , the bearing surface and lubricant being entirely contained within the case. This kept the waxy lubricant from collecting grit which can damage the revolver&#x27;s barrel. Colt, however, retained the single-diameter charge hole, resulting in the bullet failing to form a seal as it traveled through the chamber throat. This seal was expected to cause the bullet to expand in the throat and be &quot;swaged down&quot;, or reduced again in diameter, as it entered the barrel, but uneven expansion produced poor accuracy.

In the United States Army&#x27;s original black-powder cartridge used by the Colt M1892 revolver, muzzle velocity from the revolver&#x27;s barrel with bore diameter ( groove diameter) was with a bullet weighing , resulting in a muzzle energy of . In 1903, the Army changed its cartridge to smokeless powder and slightly tightened the revolver&#x27;s bore to ( groove diameter); the new muzzle velocity was with a bullet of , giving a muzzle energy of .

==History and usage==
The cartridge&#x27;s relatively poor ballistics were highlighted during the Philippine–American War of 1899–1902, when reports from U.S. Army officers were received regarding the .38 bullet&#x27;s inability to stop charges of frenzied Moro &quot;juramentados&quot; during the Moro Rebellion, even at extremely close ranges. A typical instance occurred in 1905 and was later recounted by Colonel Louis A. LaGarde:

Antonio Caspi, a prisoner on the island of Samar, P.I. attempted escape on Oct. 26, 1905. He was shot four times at close range in a hand-to-hand encounter by a .38 Colt&#x27;s revolver loaded with U.S. Army regulation ammunition. He was finally stunned by a blow on the forehead from the butt end of a Springfield carbine.

Col. LaGarde noted Caspi&#x27;s wounds were fairly well-placed: three bullets entered the chest, perforating the lungs. One passed through the body, one lodged near the back and the other lodged in subcutaneous tissue. The fourth round went through the right hand and exited through the forearm.

As an emergency response to the round&#x27;s unexpectedly dismal performance, the U.S. Army authorized officers to carry M1873 Colt Single Action Army revolvers, chambered in .45 Colt, and issued from reserve stocks. Army Ordnance also purchased a number of M1902 revolvers (the M1902 was an improved version of Colt&#x27;s Double Action Army Model 1878, a .45-caliber rod-ejector double-action revolver) for issue to officers deploying overseas.

The .38 Long Colt remained the Army&#x27;s primary revolver cartridge until 1909, when the .45 M1909 cartridge was issued along with the .45 Colt New Service revolver as the new standard military sidearm for the U.S. Army. However, some of the old .38 Long Colt revolvers and ammunition remained in reserve stocks, and when the U.S. entered World War I in 1917, the need for sidearms was such that even these low-performing weapons were brought out of storage for usage away from the front lines.

In civilian use, the .38 LC was chambered in a number of Colt revolvers and saw some use among target shooters. Various U.S. police forces also adopted the cartridge. However, the cartridge became nearly extinct after Smith &amp; Wesson&#x27;s more powerful .38 Special cartridge became widely popular as a civilian and police service cartridge. By 1908, even Colt was chambering their new Police Positive and Army Special revolvers in &quot;.38 Colt Special&quot;, which was just a standard .38 Smith &amp; Wesson Special with a different headstamp.

<text>Kagera Region (&quot;Mkoa wa Kagera&quot; in Swahili) is one of Tanzania&#x27;s 31 administrative regions. The region covers an area of . The region is comparable in size to the land area of the Netherlands. Kagera Region is bordered to the east by Lake Victoria, Mwanza Region and Mara Region. The region is bordered to the south by Geita Region and Kigoma Region. Lastly, Kagera borders Rwanda to the west, Uganda to the north and Burundi to the south west.
The regional capital city is Bukoba. According to the 2022 national census, the region had a population of 2,989,299, an increase from 2,458,023 recorded in 2012.

== Etymology ==
The region derives its name from the Kagera River.

== Geography ==
Kagera borders Uganda to the north, Rwanda and Burundi to the west, and the Tanzanian regions Kigoma to the south and Geita to the east. The Kagera River forms the region&#x27;s border with Rwanda. The region lies in the middle of 30°25&#x27; and 32°40&#x27; east, and 1°00&#x27; and 2°45&#x27; south. The total area is , of which is land and 27 percent, and is water. Much of the water is that of the great lake, Victoria, as well as lakes Ikimba, Burigi, Ngono and the Kagera River. Kagera is Tanzania&#x27;s fifteenth-largest region and accounts for approximately 3.3 percent of Tanzania&#x27;s land area of . The regional capital Bukoba is about from Dar es Salaam.

===Climate===
With an average annual rainfall of 500 to 2000 mms, the Kagera Region has a bi-modal rainfall pattern from March to May and from October to November. Rainfall varies from 2000 mm per year in Bukoba to 500 mm in the west, with rainfall being higher along Lake Victoria&#x27;s coasts and decreasing inland and away from the lake as well as with height. The temperature ranges from 20 degrees Celsius to 28 degrees Celsius. The area is made up of a number of hills that run parallel to the lake&#x27;s edge and north to south.

=== Geology ===
Lying on the Kivu Rift, the western of the two branches of the East African Rift which transverses Tanzania, Kagera experiences significant seismic activity. On 10 September 2016, the region was struck by a 5.9 magnitude earthquake in which 17 people died, and at least 250 others were injured.

Kagera is known for its agriculture, lush landscapes, and wildlife. It has reasonably fertile old soils but climate change has led to soil exhaustion and a need to use fertiliser.

== Demographics ==
=== Population ===
One of the top five most populous regions in the nation is the Kagera region. According to the population and housing Census of 2002, the region had a total population of 2,033,888, with an average growth rate of 3.1%. 6.0% of all Tanzanians living on the mainland were found in the region.

== History ==

During colonization the region was a district called West Lake, that was a part of the Lake Province, that included the Geita, Mwanza, Shinyanga, Tabora, Simiyu, and Mara, regions. After independence Lake Province was broken up into regions, with Kagera and part of Geita becoming the West Lake Region. Following the Kagera War in 1979, the West Lake Region was renamed the Kagera Region.

For a period of about five centuries, Kagera was home to nine different kingdoms with highly hierarchical societies. Before European colonialism, coffee was a traditional crop in the area, used for its stimulant properties and in local cultural rituals. During colonial times, coffee was transformed into a cash crop. Bananas were a staple food in the region. Although there was a gender-based division of labour in the traditional Bahaya society, women of the time were not thought to be inferior to men. In fact women commanded special respect in all traditional rituals. For example, upon the death of a head of a family (Nyin&#x27;enju), during the following inheritance rituals, the &quot;Main Inheritor&quot; (Omusika) had to have a female counterpart selected from among his sisters to share his authority. Similarly, upon the death of a reigning king, during the crowning of the next king, there had to be a &quot;sister to the nation&quot; (&quot;Kinyany&#x27;engoma&quot;) who was also selected from among his sisters.

The kings lived in elaborate palaces and were respected as the direct link to gods of their kingdoms. The authority of the nine kingdoms (Kihanja, Karagwe, Kiziba, Misenye, Bugabo, Kyamtwara, Ihangiro, Bukara and Biharamulo) was diminished when Germans colonised Tanzania in 1885 and supported the Haya, the ethnic group of Bukoba and Muleba Districts over the other districts. However, the local kings held on to power. The demise of these kingdoms came after Tanzania gained its independence and president Nyerere considered them detrimental to national unity.

There was a chief called Omukama (the word meant a king or chief) who could be born with that authority. Some prominent chiefs in Kagera include Kyamukuma, who is a last chief in Misenye (currently Missenyi District). Other chiefs include Rumanyika of Karagwe, Ruhinda, Kahigi and other inferior chiefs. Kahigi is among the chiefs who waived their territories by collaborating with German colonialists.

Cultural tours are available for tourists visiting Kagera and can be accessed from the region&#x27;s capital of Bukoba. These tours include visits to the region&#x27;s national parks/nature reserves etc.

During German rule Dr. M. Zupitza, then serving as the local medical officer, encountered the plague outbreak in Kiziba (1897–1898). In cooperation with Dr. Robert Koch, he confirmed that the cause was the same bacteria as the outbreak in Bombay.

When authority was transferred to the British who supplanted the Germans, Kagera was open to Lutheran missionary activity. Other Christian denominations including the Roman Catholic church later arrived. Their legacy is seen in the many churches in the region.

The attempted annexation of Kagera by Uganda in 1979 triggered the Uganda–Tanzania War.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the main economic activity in the region, with the primary crops farmed in the region being pulses. Cereals were the most often planted crop, with 153,993 hectares (42.8% of the total area planted with annuals), followed by root and tubers with 64,261 ha (17.8%), oil seeds with 10,416 ha (2.9%), cash crops with 7,737 ha (2.1%), and fruits and vegetables with 3,558 ha (1.0%). The majority of annual cash crops were cotton. Cereal crop output in the area is dominated by maize, evidenced by 302,529 households in the region raising maize during the brief wet season. This made up about 93.8% of all households that raised crops during that time.

Food crop sales accounted for 54.0% of smallholder households&#x27; total cash income in the Kagera Region, with cash crop sales (18.9%), other sporadic income (8.7%), fishing (4.3%), and wages/salaries (4.3%) following.
Petty businesses were the primary source of income for only 3.4% of smallholder households, followed by the sale of livestock (2.5%), cash remittances (2.0%), sales of forest products (0.7%), and sales of animal products (0.6%).

Kagera is also one of the largest coffee producers in the country. Muleba (9,968 ha, 26%), Karagwe (8,660 ha, 23%), Ngara (3,600 ha, 10%), Biharamulo (454 ha, 1%), and Bukoba Urban (373 ha, 1%) were the other coffee-producing areas in the area, with Bukoba Rural having the highest area (14,704 ha, 39%). (Map 3.33). However, Ngara (1.23 ha) had the greatest average amount of land planted with coffee per household, followed by Karagwe(0.32 ha), Biharamulo (0.22 ha), Muleba (0.21 ha), Bukoba Rural (0.21 ha), and Bukoba Urban (0.21 ha) (0.18 ha).

=== Wildlife and national parks ===
The Kagera Region has abundant wildlife, including baboons, giraffe, elands, crocodiles, hippopotamus, warthog. Birdlife includes African fish eagles, hammerkops, marabou stork, cormorants. kingfishers, and herons.

Kagera is home to Biharamulo Forest Reserve, Burigi-Chato National Park, Ibanda-Kyerwa National Park, Rumanyika-Karagwe National Park, Rubondo Island National Park and Saanane Island National Park. In 2019, Burigi, Biharamulo game reserve, and Lakes Burigi and Kimis were upgraded to become a national park with the Burigi-Chato National Park. Rumanyika-Karagwe National Park was gazetted as Rumanyika-Karagwe National Park and Ibanda-Kyerwa National Park.

<doc id="870848" wikidata="Q7544987" url="?curid=870848" title="Smith &amp; Wesson Model 1006">
<text>The [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] Model 1006 is a recoil operated double-action/single-action semi-automatic handgun chambered in the 10mm Auto cartridge manufactured by Smith &amp; Wesson.

==Design==
It is constructed entirely of stainless steel, a 5 in (127 mm) barrel and a 9-round single column magazine. Its safety is a slide mounted de-cock/safety, internal safeties are a magazine disconnect and firing pin block. It is available with fixed or adjustable sights. The pistols were originally made with the 2nd trigger guard, which has an elongated, oval shape (see photo); in 1992 the frame was redesigned with the shorter, rounder 3rd trigger guard.

The model 1006 was the first in the S&amp;W 1000 series of third generation semi-automatic handguns. Variations include the models 1026, 1046, 1066, 1076 (FBI model) and 1086. The 1000 series were some of the most robust, sturdy 10mm handguns ever built, easily handling the power of this potent cartridge.

Other third generation S&amp;W auto series include the 5906, 4006 and 4506.

==Users==
The Model 1076 is most commonly known as the &quot;FBI Pistol&quot; because the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) ordered 10,000 Model 1076 pistols for its agents in the aftermath of the 1986 FBI Miami shootout. However, problems developed and the FBI received only 2,400 pistols before the contract was cancelled.
In 1990 the Virginia State Police contracted with S&amp;W for 2,200 Model 1026 pistols, and by July 1990 they had received the entire order. The Model 1026 was identical to the FBI&#x27;s Model 1076 but with a 5-inch barrel instead of a 4.25 inch barrel. The Virginia State Police also experienced issues with the pistol and the reduced power load recommended by the FBI. In 1994, based on continuing problems with the 1026, the Virginia State Police traded them in for the SIG Sauer P228 pistol in 9mm.

==Recalls==
Shortly after the 1006 pistol was introduced, Smith and Wesson issued a recall on the one-piece plastic grip. It seems when the pistol was dropped on its heel, the plastic grip could break, allowing the hammer spring to fly free. Customers who contacted Smith and Wesson were sent new grips at no charge. The new replacement grip has a center punched mark on the bottom of the heel, whereas the bad grips did not.

The 1026/1076 also had a recall issued, due to issues with the decocking lever that could potentially render the pistols inoperable.

==Variants==
* S&amp;W 1026: Double Action / Single Action (DA/SA) gun with frame-mounted decocker only and 5″ barrel.
* S&amp;W 1046: Double Action Only (DAO) gun with 5″ barrel.
* S&amp;W 1066: Double Action / Single Action (DA/SA) gun with slide-mounted decocker / safety and 4.25″ barrel.
* S&amp;W 1076: Double Action / Single Action (DA/SA) gun with frame-mounted decocker only and 4.25″ barrel.
* S&amp;W 1086: Double Action Only (DAO) gun with 4.25″ barrel.

== Total production numbers ==
According to Smith and Wesson, a total of 50,796 10mm Auto pistols were produced.

<doc id="870856" wikidata="Q6478539" url="?curid=870856" title="Lake Wobegon Days">
<text>Lake Wobegon Days is a novel by Garrison Keillor, first published in hardcover by Viking in 1985. Based on material from his radio show &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;, the book brought Keillor&#x27;s work to a much wider audience and achieved international success selling over 1 million copies. Like some of Keillor&#x27;s other books, it is unusual in that it could be said that the audiobook preceded the publication in written form.

The work is a humorous account of life in fictitious Lake Wobegon, Minnesota, a heartland small town. Its early chapters are written in the form and style of a history of the town and later ones chronicle the lives, concerns, and activities of its inhabitants, with inter-generational tensions and relationships forming a major theme. Most of the latter material was originally delivered on radio in the form of monologues. Due to the nature of the original material, the second half of the novel has many recurring characters but little in the way of plot, resembling an incompletely integrated group of short stories.

== Reception ==
In his Los Angeles Times review Richard Eder describes the book as being &quot;filled with good things, but it has its problems.&quot; Eder goes on to say that &quot;It is a pastiche, and a very talented one; but there are times when the whimsy frays.&quot; Barth Healey however, describes it as &quot;a genuine work of American history&quot; in his New York Times Book Review.

<doc id="870857" wikidata="Q1427934" url="?curid=870857" title="Glow discharge">
<text>A glow discharge is a plasma formed by the passage of electric current through a gas. It is often created by applying a voltage between two electrodes in a glass tube containing a low-pressure gas. When the voltage exceeds a value called the striking voltage, the gas ionization becomes self-sustaining, and the tube glows with a colored light. The color depends on the gas used.

Glow discharges are used as a source of light in devices such as neon lights, cold cathode fluorescent lamps and plasma-screen televisions. Analyzing the light produced with spectroscopy can reveal information about the atomic interactions in the gas, so glow discharges are used in plasma physics and analytical chemistry. They are also used in the surface treatment technique called sputtering.

==Electrical conduction in gas==

Conduction in a gas requires charge carriers, which can be either electrons or ions. Charge carriers come from ionizing some of the gas molecules. In terms of current flow, glow discharge falls between dark discharge and arc discharge.

*In a dark discharge, the gas is ionized (the carriers are generated) by a radiation source such as ultraviolet light or Cosmic rays. At higher voltages across the anode and cathode, the freed carriers can gain enough energy so that additional carriers are freed during collisions; the process is a Townsend avalanche or multiplication.
*In a glow discharge, the carrier generation process reaches a point where the average electron leaving the cathode allows another electron to leave the cathode. For example, the average electron may cause dozens of ionizing collisions via the Townsend avalanche; the resulting positive ions head toward the cathode, and a fraction of those that cause collisions with the cathode will dislodge an electron by secondary emission.
*In an arc discharge, electrons leave the cathode by thermionic emission and field emission, and the gas is ionized by thermal means.

Below the breakdown voltage there is little to no glow and the electric field is uniform. When the electric field increases enough to cause ionization, the Townsend discharge starts. When a glow discharge develops, the electric field is considerably modified by the presence of positive ions; the field is concentrated near the cathode. The glow discharge starts as a normal glow. As the current is increased, more of the cathode surface is involved in the glow. When the current is increased above the level where the entire cathode surface is involved, the discharge is known as an abnormal glow. If the current is increased still further, other factors come into play and an arc discharge begins.

==Mechanism==
The simplest type of glow discharge is a direct-current glow discharge. In its simplest form, it consists of two electrodes in a cell held at low pressure (0.1–10 torr; about 1/10000 to 1/100 of atmospheric pressure). A low pressure is used to increase the mean free path; for a fixed electric field, a longer mean free path allows a charged particle to gain more energy before colliding with another particle. The cell is typically filled with neon, but other gases can also be used. An electric potential of several hundred volts is applied between the two electrodes. A small fraction of the population of atoms within the cell is initially ionized through random processes, such as thermal collisions between atoms or by gamma rays. The positive ions are driven towards the cathode by the electric potential, and the electrons are driven towards the anode by the same potential. The initial population of ions and electrons collides with other atoms, exciting or ionizing them. As long as the potential is maintained, a population of ions and electrons remains.

===Secondary emission===
Some of the ions&#x27; kinetic energy is transferred to the cathode. This happens partially through the ions striking the cathode directly. The primary mechanism, however, is less direct. Ions strike the more numerous neutral gas atoms, transferring a portion of their energy to them. These neutral atoms then strike the cathode. Whichever species (ions or atoms) strike the cathode, collisions within the cathode redistribute this energy resulting in electrons ejected from the cathode. This process is known as secondary electron emission. Once free of the cathode, the electric field accelerates electrons into the bulk of the glow discharge. Atoms can then be excited by collisions with ions, electrons, or other atoms that have been previously excited by collisions.

===Light production===
Once excited, atoms will lose their energy fairly quickly. Of the various ways that this energy can be lost, the most important is radiatively, meaning that a photon is released to carry the energy away. In optical atomic spectroscopy, the wavelength of this photon can be used to determine the identity of the atom (that is, which chemical element it is) and the number of photons is directly proportional to the concentration of that element in the sample. Some collisions (those of high enough energy) will cause ionization. In atomic mass spectrometry, these ions are detected. Their mass identifies the type of atoms and their quantity reveals the amount of that element in the sample.

===Regions===

The illustrations to the right shows the main regions that may be present in a glow discharge. Regions described as &quot;glows&quot; emit significant light; regions labeled as &quot;dark spaces&quot; do not. As the discharge becomes more extended (i.e., stretched horizontally in the geometry of the illustrations), the positive column may become . That is, alternating dark and bright regions may form. Compressing the discharge horizontally will result in fewer regions. The positive column will be compressed while the negative glow will remain the same size, and, with small enough gaps, the positive column will disappear altogether. In an analytical glow discharge, the discharge is primarily a negative glow with dark region above and below it.

===Cathode layer===
The cathode layer begins with the Aston dark space, and ends with the negative glow region. The cathode layer shortens with increased gas pressure. The cathode layer has a positive space charge and a strong electric field.

====Aston dark space====
Electrons leave the cathode with an energy of about 1 eV, which is not enough to ionize or excite atoms, leaving a thin dark layer next to the cathode.

====Cathode glow====
Electrons from the cathode eventually attain enough energy to excite atoms. These excited atoms quickly fall back to the ground state, emitting light at a wavelength corresponding to the difference between the energy bands of the atoms. This glow is seen very near the cathode.

====Cathode dark space====
As electrons from the cathode gain more energy, they tend to ionize, rather than excite atoms. Excited atoms quickly fall back to ground level emitting light, however, when atoms are ionized, the opposite charges are separated, and do not immediately recombine. This results in more ions and electrons, but no light. This region is sometimes called Crookes dark space, and sometimes referred to as the &quot;cathode fall&quot;, because the largest voltage drop in the tube occurs in this region.

====Negative glow====
The ionization in the cathode dark space results in a high electron density, but slower electrons, making it easier for the electrons to recombine with positive ions, leading to intense light, through a process called bremsstrahlung radiation.

====Faraday dark space====
As the electrons keep losing energy, less light is emitted, resulting in another dark space.

===Anode layer===
The anode layer begins with the positive column, and ends at the anode. The anode layer has a negative space charge and a moderate electric field.

====Positive column====
With fewer ions, the electric field increases, resulting in electrons with energy of about 2 eV, which is enough to excite atoms and produce light. With longer glow discharge tubes, the longer space is occupied by a longer positive column, while the cathode layer remains the same. For example, with a neon sign, the positive column occupies almost the entire length of the tube.

====Anode glow====
An electric field increase results in the anode glow.

====Anode dark space====
Fewer electrons results in another dark space.

===Striations===
Bands of alternating light and dark in the positive column are called . There is no universal mechanism explaining the striations for all conditions of gas and pressure producing them, but recent theoretical and modelling studies, supported with experimental results, mention the importance of the Dufour effect.

===Sputtering===
In addition to causing secondary emission, positive ions can strike the cathode with sufficient force to eject particles of the material from which the cathode is made. This process is called sputtering and it gradually ablates the cathode. Sputtering is useful when using spectroscopy to analyze the composition of the cathode, as is done in Glow-discharge optical emission spectroscopy.

However, sputtering is not desirable when glow discharge is used for lighting, because it shortens the life of the lamp. For example, neon signs have hollow cathodes designed to minimize sputtering, and contain charcoal to continuously remove undesired ions and atoms.

===Carrier gas===
In the context of sputtering, the gas in the tube is called &quot;carrier gas,&quot; because it carries the particles from the cathode.

===Color difference===
Because of sputtering occurring at the cathode, the colors emitted from regions near the cathode are quite different from the anode. Particles sputtered from the cathode are excited and emit radiation from the metals and oxides that make up the cathode. The radiation from these particles combines with radiation from excited carrier gas, giving the cathode region a white or blue color, while in the rest of the tube, radiation is only from the carrier gas and tends to be more monochromatic.

Electrons near the cathode are less energetic than the rest of the tube. Surrounding the cathode is a negative field, which slows electrons as they are ejected from the surface. Only those electrons with the highest velocity are able to escape this field, and those without enough kinetic energy are pulled back into the cathode. Once outside the negative field, the attraction from the positive field begins to accelerate these electrons toward the anode. During this acceleration electrons are deflected and slowed down by positive ions speeding toward the cathode, which, in turn, produces bright blue-white bremsstrahlung radiation in the negative glow region.

==Use in analytical chemistry==

Glow discharges can be used to analyze the elemental, and sometimes molecular, composition of solids, liquids, and gases, but elemental analysis of solids is the most common. In this arrangement, the sample is used as the cathode. As mentioned earlier, gas ions and atoms striking the sample surface knock atoms off of it, a process known as sputtering.

The sputtered atoms, now in the gas phase, can be detected by atomic absorption, but this is a comparatively rare strategy. Instead, atomic emission and mass spectrometry are usually used.

Collisions between the gas-phase sample atoms and the plasma gas pass energy to the sample atoms. This energy can excite the atoms, after which they can lose their energy through atomic emission. By observing the wavelength of the emitted light, the atom&#x27;s identity can be determined. By observing the intensity of the emission, the concentration of atoms of that type can be determined.

Energy gained through collisions can also ionize the sample atoms. The ions can then be detected by mass spectrometry. In this case, it is the mass of the ions that identify the element and the number of ions that reflect the concentration. This method is referred to as glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMS) and it has detection limits down to the sub-ppb range for most elements that are nearly matrix-independent.

===Depth analysis===
Both bulk and depth analysis of solids may be performed with glow discharge. Bulk analysis assumes that the sample is fairly homogeneous and averages the emission or mass spectrometric signal over time. Depth analysis relies on tracking the signal in time, therefore, is the same as tracking the elemental composition in depth.

Depth analysis requires greater control over operational parameters. For example, conditions (current, potential, pressure) need to be adjusted so that the crater produced by sputtering is flat bottom (that is, so that the depth analyzed over the crater area is uniform). In bulk measurement, a rough or rounded crater bottom would not adversely impact analysis. Under the best conditions, depth resolution in the single nanometer range has been achieved (in fact, within-molecule resolution has been demonstrated).

The chemistry of ions and neutrals in vacuum is called gas phase ion chemistry and is part of the analytical study that includes glow discharge.

==Powering modes==
In analytical chemistry, glow discharges are usually operated in direct-current mode. For direct-current, the cathode (which is the sample in solids analysis) must be conductive. In contrast, analysis of a non conductive cathode requires the use of a high frequency alternating current.

The potential, pressure, and current are interrelated. Only two can be directly controlled at once, while the third must be allowed to vary. The pressure is most typically held constant, but other schemes may be used. The pressure and current may be held constant, while potential is allowed to vary. The pressure and voltage may be held constant while the current is allowed to vary. The power (product of voltage and current) may be held constant while the pressure is allowed to vary.

Glow discharges may also be operated in radio-frequency. The use of this frequency will establish a negative DC-bias voltage on the sample surface. The DC-bias is the result of an alternating current waveform that is centered about negative potential; as such it more or less represent the average potential residing on the sample surface. Radio-frequency has ability to appear to flow through insulators (non-conductive materials).

Both radio-frequency and direct-current glow discharges can be operated in pulsed mode, where the potential is turned on and off. This allows higher instantaneous powers to be applied without excessively heating the cathode. These higher instantaneous powers produce higher instantaneous signals, aiding detection. Combining time-resolved detection with pulsed powering results in additional benefits. In atomic emission, analyte atoms emit during different portions of the pulse than background atoms, allowing the two to be discriminated. Analogously, in mass spectrometry, sample and background ions are created at different times.

==Application to analog computing==
An interesting application for using glow discharge was described in a 2002 scientific paper by Ryes, Ghanem &quot;et al.&quot;
According to a Nature news article describing the work, researchers at Imperial College London demonstrated how they built a mini-map that glows along the shortest route between two points. The Nature news article describes the system as follows:

:To make the one-inch London chip, the team etched a plan of the city centre on a glass slide. Fitting a flat lid over the top turned the streets into hollow, connected tubes. They filled these with helium gas, and inserted electrodes at key tourist hubs. When a voltage is applied between two points, electricity naturally runs through the streets along the shortest route from A to B - and the gas glows like a tiny neon strip light.

The approach itself provides a novel visible analog computing approach for solving a wide class of maze searching problems based on the properties of lighting up of a glow discharge in a microfluidic chip.

==Application to voltage regulation==

In the mid-20th century, prior to the development of solid state components such as Zener diodes, voltage regulation in circuits was often accomplished with voltage-regulator tubes, which used glow discharge.

<text>Double action (or double-action) refers to one of two systems in firearms where the trigger both cocks and releases the hammer.
*Double-action only (DAO) firearms trigger: The trigger both cocks and releases the hammer. There is no single-action function and the hammer will return to its decocked position after each shot. 
**Double Action Kellerman (DAK): A variant of traditional double-action used on certain SIG Sauer semi-automatic pistols. DAK triggers have a long stroke with pull. However, if a user shooting under stress short-strokes the trigger by only releasing it halfway, the trigger will reset, but with a pull. This temporary increased trigger pull is intended to prevent negligent discharges.
*Double-action – firearms trigger: Pressing the trigger 1) cocks, and 2) drops the hammer. The hammer can also be cocked to fire in single-action (SA) mode.
** With a DA revolver, the hammer can be cocked first (single action), or the trigger can be pulled and it will cock and release the hammer (double action). Once the gun has fired, the hammer stays in the decocked position until the hammer is re-cocked (single action), or the trigger is pulled again (double action).
** With a DA semi-automatic pistol, the initial trigger pull will cock and release the hammer (double action). The blowback from the firing mechanism automatically re-cocks the hammer after the gun is fired, such that each subsequent shot only requires the hammer to be released (single action). A decocker, if present on the pistol, can be used to return the hammer to its decocked position to prevent negligent discharges.

<doc id="870859" wikidata="Q1189330" url="?curid=870859" title="Mount Spurr">
<text>Mount Spurr (Dena&#x27;ina: &quot;K&#x27;idazq&#x27;eni&quot;) is a stratovolcano in the Aleutian Arc of Alaska, named after United States Geological Survey geologist and explorer Josiah Edward Spurr, who led an expedition to the area in 1898. The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) currently rates Mount Spurr as Level of Concern Color Code Yellow. The mountain is known aboriginally by the Dena&#x27;ina Athabascan name &quot;K&#x27;idazq&#x27;eni&quot;, literally &#x27;that which is burning inside&#x27;.

Mount Spurr, the highest volcano of the Aleutian Arc, is a large stratocone constructed at the center of a roughly horseshoe-shaped caldera that is open to the south. The volcano lies west of Anchorage and northeast of Chakachamna Lake. The caldera was formed by a late-Pleistocene or early Holocene sector collapse and associated pyroclastic flows that destroyed an ancestral Spurr volcano. The debris avalanche traveled more than to the southeast, and the resulting deposit contains blocks as large as in diameter. Several ice-carved post-caldera domes lie in the caldera. Present Mt. Spurr is the highest of the post-caldera. This regrown summit peak of Spurr experienced a heating event in 2004 which created a small crater lake. By 2008, the summit crater had cooled enough to have begun to have accumulated significant amounts of snow again. The youngest post-caldera dome, Crater Peak (), formed at the breached southern end of the caldera about south of Spurr, has been the source of about 40 identified Holocene tephra layers. Spurr&#x27;s two historical eruptions, from Crater Peak in 1953 and 1992, deposited ash on the city of Anchorage. Crater Peak has a summit crater that is itself slightly breached along the south rim; the north wall of the crater exposes the truncated remains of an older dome or lava lake. Before the 1992 eruption, a small crater lake occupied the bottom of Crater Peak&#x27;s crater.

As with other Alaskan volcanoes, the proximity of Spurr to major trans-Pacific aviation routes means that an eruption of this volcano can significantly disrupt air travel. Volcanic ash can cause jet engines to fail.

==Recent activity==
On July 26, 2004, the AVO raised the &quot;Color Concern Code&quot; at Spurr from green to yellow due to an increasing number of earthquakes. Earthquakes beneath a volcano may indicate the movement of magma preceding a volcanic eruption, but the earthquakes might also die out without an eruption. In the first week of August 2004, the AVO reported the presence of a collapse pit, filled with water forming a new crater lake, in the ice and snow cover on the summit. This lake may have been caused by an increase in heat flow through the summit lava dome.

On May 3, 2005, a debris flow was observed in webcam images, as well as by a nearby pilot. A subsequent overflight revealed that much of the sitting pond within the melt hole had drained away, a notable depth.

The alert level for Mount Spurr was again raised to yellow (advisory) on October 23, 2024, because of an increase in seismic activity.

<doc id="870869" wikidata="Q271733" url="?curid=870869" title="Moshi, Tanzania">
<text>Moshi is a municipality and the capital of Kilimanjaro Region in the Northeastern Tanzania. As of 2017, the municipality has an estimated population of 201,150 and a population density of 3,409 persons per km2 .&lt;ref name=&quot;2016/17 population&quot;&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; In the last official census of 2022, the municipality had a population of 221,733. The municipality is situated on the lower slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro, a dormant volcano that is the highest mountain in Africa. The name &quot;Moshi&quot; has been reported to refer to the smoke that emanates from the nearby mountain. The municipality covers about and is the smallest municipality in Tanzania by area.

==History and administration==
Germany established a military camp in Moshi (&quot;Neumoschi&quot;) in August 1893. Father Schneider, a missionary active in East Africa during the period, noted that by 1906, Moshi had developed into an important politico-military and commercial center. The town hosted German colonial authorities as well as Greek and Indian traders. 

The northern line railroad reached Moshi in 1912., and Moshi was connected to Tanga via Usambara Railway. 

Beginning in the 1920s, after Tanganyika became a British mandate, Moshi experienced significant urban population growth. By 1920, the town&#x27;s population had reached 3,000 inhabitants. This number increased to 29,423 by 1967 and further rose to 96,631 by 1988. In 2012, Moshi was home to 184,292 residents , and by 2017, the population had exceeded 200,000. 

Moshi attained the status of a town in 1956. In 1988, it became a municipality under Tanzanian law, but as of 31 October 2014, the process for submitting its application to become a city was in its final stages. Moshi is administratively divided into 21 wards and then subdivided into 60 hamlets.

== Economy ==
As the capital of the region, it is the center of government activities, trade, finance, and tourism. In the first half of the 20th century, Moshi was traditionally an important railway town, center of banana agriculture, and commercial producer of pyrethrum.

=== Tourism ===
Moshi is one of tourism centers in the northern safari circuit of Tanzania. The closest tourism spots include Kilimanjaro National Park, Mkomazi National Park, Lake Jipe, and Lake Chala. There are also several waterfalls, natural springs, and tropical forests. Tours can also be arranged from Moshi to other areas such as Serengeti National Park, Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Arusha National Park, Lake Manyara National Park, and Tarangire National Park. The city has several hotels and recreation centers.

There is annual fair, KiliFair, organized to be an international tourism &amp; industry fair, promoting and presenting companies based in the Kilimanjaro region. The fair has the character of a business networking event for the tourism industry, in combination with a community fair to attract local people, families &amp; expats. Recently, Karibu Fair (TATO) and Kilifair, both well-known tourism fairs decided to join into one and create by far the largest and most important Tourism Trade Fair in East Africa. The newly formed “Karibu/KiliFair” is expecting to host 350+ exhibitors from East and Central Africa, 300+ international hosted and semi-hosted buyers, as well as approximately 4000 trade visitors during the days of the fair. The fair will annually alternate between Moshi and Arusha starting 2018 event.

*Timing: At the beginning of June every year (from 2015).
*Venue(s): Ushirika Stadium in Moshi and Friedkin Recreation Center – TGT in Arusha
*Coming Event: 2019, June 7 – 9 (to be held in Arusha)

=== Manufacturing ===
Moshi is the home to one of the three Coca-Cola bottlers in Tanzania, Bonite Botters Ltd. Serengeti Breweries, an East African Breweries company, also has a manufacturing plant in Moshi. Just south of the city, there is a sugar production facility by TPC Ltd which owns one of the largest and oldest sugar cane plantation in the country. There are several small and medium scale manufacturing facilities in dairy and food packaging sector.

=== Agriculture ===
Moshi&#x27;s lower altitude and dry climate mean that the main crops grown on the higher slopes of Mt Kilimanjaro, coffee and bananas, do not thrive there. The surrounding areas in Moshi district are known for extensive farms of maize and beans, grown once per year during the long rainy season (known as &quot;masika&quot; in Kiswahili). In addition, the Tanganyika Planting Company operates a very large sugar cane plantation and company town south of Moshi.

Roman Catholic missionaries introduced Arabica coffee cultivation to the Moshi region in 1893. The Kilimanjaro Native Co-operative Union was established in 1929 by the district commissioner, Charles Cecil Farquharson Dundas. Its purpose was to enable Chagga coffee growers to compete on equal terms in world markets with European growers. KNCU collects coffee from 96 village societies, representing over 150,000 small-scale farmers. KNCU handles between 50 and 70 percent of the coffee grown in the area and trades over 5,250 tons of Arabica coffee, or about 11 percent of the national production.

In recent years, efforts have been made to diversify Moshi&#x27;s agricultural economy beyond traditional coffee production. In 2019, a dairy cooperative located on the eastern slopes of Mount Kilimanjaro partnered with the Poland-East Africa Economic Foundation and Polish Aid to boost dairy farming in the region. The cooperative expanded significantly, benefiting over 900 local farmers and establishing new facilities to support milk production and processing 

== Education ==

Like all of Tanzania, Moshi has universal primary education. According to the Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey 2010, the Kilimanjaro Region, which includes Moshi, had the second highest female literacy rate and the third highest male literacy rate among Tanzania&#x27;s then-existing 26 regions. According to the Tanzania Poverty and Human Development Report 2005, the Moshi urban district had the highest literacy rate for persons over 15 years of age when compared to any of the 128 other districts in Tanzania.

Moshi hosts a number of higher education facilities, which include the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical College (KCMCo), the Stefano Moshi Memorial University College (SMMUCo), the Mwenge Catholic University (MWECAU), the Moshi Co-operative University (MoCU), the College of African Wildlife Management (CAWM), the Kilimanjaro School of Pharmacy (KSP), and the Tanzania Training Centre for Orthopaedic Technologists (TATCOT).

* KCMCo is a campus of Tumaini University. It was started in 1997 and offers a number of medical courses. The college is located within the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre complex, about from Moshi. 
* SMMUCo is also a campus of Tumaini University. It was developed from the Masoka Management Training Institute and the Mwika Lutheran Bible College.

* The Tanzania Training Centre for Orthopaedic Technologists (TATCOT) was founded in Moshi with the material, financial and human resource support of the governments of Tanzania and the Federal Republic of Germany in June 1981. TATCOT is a supra-regional training centre providing courses in the field of orthopaedic technology in Africa and enrols students from all English speaking African countries as well as other interested countries. The reason for establishing these courses was to educate the professionals who are required to provide technical services to people with amputations and other neuromuscular disorders such as poliomyelitis, paralysis, cerebral palsy, clubfoot and trauma. In order to do this the professionals are provided with the knowledge and skills to provide prostheses, orthoses, wheelchairs and supportive seating to people with disabilities.

Moshi also has several secondary schools. The government schools are Mawenzi Secondary School, Moshi Technical School, Moshi Secondary School, and J. K. Nyerere Secondary School.

The school specialises at A-Level in Kiswahili, geography, history, and English. The school operates a double shift system for junior pupils (Form 1–4). All subjects are taught in English, apart from Kiswahili and French. Mawenzi School has had a link with Buckie High School in Scotland since 1987. Pupils and teachers have travelled between Tanzania and Scotland many times.
* The United World College East Africa, formerly known as the International School Moshi (ISM), was established in 1969 to serve the needs of the expatriate and local communities. The school has about 600 students from nearly 40 different nationalities on two campuses in Moshi and Arusha. The Moshi campus has about 190 students, including 90 boarders, from 25 nationalities and offers a full range of courses from early childhood to the International Baccalaureate Diploma. The school has been an International Baccalaureate World School since 1977, and was the first school to offer the IB in Africa. ISM is one of only two world schools in Tanzania to offer the primary years, middle years, and diploma programmes. In August 2019 ISM became the 18th United World College in the world, adopting the name UWC East Africa.

There are also various English medium schools with pre-primary, primary, and secondary education, such as the Eden Garden schools.

== Medical care ==
The main private hospital in the area is the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC), a zonal referral hospital. This complex has more than 450 beds and serves a population of over individuals. The Good Samaritan Foundation of Tanzania founded KCMC in March 1971.

Next to KCMC is the Kilimanjaro Centre for Community Ophthalmology (KCCO), which was founded in 2001 and is co-directed by Dr. Paul Courtright and Dr. Susan Lewallen. A new three-story building for KCCO was finished in 2007, funded by several individuals and non-governmental organizations. The KCCO is &quot;dedicated to the elimination of avoidable blindness through programmes, training, and research focusing on the delivery of sustainable and replicable community ophthalmology services&quot;. The KCCO has an &quot;official memorandum of understanding ... with the Department of Ophthalmology and Kilimanjaro Christian Medical College under which the KCCO assumes or shares responsibility (subject to specific funding grants) for many teaching activities, running workshops and seminars, supervising the ... [Ophthalmic Resource Centre for Eastern Africa], serving in an advisory capacity for planning Eye Department services, conducting epidemiologic and clinical research in prevention or treatment of vision loss or related fields, and serves on committees&quot;.

Moshi also hosts the Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Institute (KCRI), which is the research arm of KCMC. KCRI evolved from the Kilimanjaro Clinical Research Centre (KCRC) in 2009. KCRC was established in 2006 with the support of the Dutch government through the Netherlands-African partnership for Capacity development and Clinical interventions Against Poverty-related disease (NACCAP).

The primary public hospital in Moshi is the Mawenzi Regional Hospital, which started sometime before 1920 as a small dispensary for German soldiers and became a hospital in 1956. The hospital has about 300 beds but is severely underfunded. In late 2010, its surgical services were suspended indefinitely by the Government and Private Hospitals Inspection Committee of the Tanzanian Ministry of Health and Social Welfare. The head of the committee, Dr. Pamella Sawa, said, &quot;During our inspection, we inspected the theatre room of Mawenzi Hospital and found it very dirty, with no[t] enough ventilation, the situation which is dangerous not only to the patient but also to his/her attendant...&quot; The hospital includes a Care and Treatment Centre for people living with HIV/AIDS. The hospital&#x27;s physical therapy department has a student learning program in cooperation with Norway, in which Norwegian physiotherapy students in their second and third years come as short term apprentices.

== Transportation ==

=== Roads ===
Moshi is connected to other cities in Tanzania by Tanroads highway T2. Several bus companies operate intercity routes from Moshi. There are also local buses for the intracity travel.

=== Air ===
Kilimanjaro International Airport, which is operated by the Kilimanjaro Airport Development Company and located in Hai District approximately 40 km along the Moshi-Arusha Highway. There is also a small airport nearby (Moshi Airport) approximately 5 km from the city center. The airport serves mostly chartered and private flights.

=== Rail ===
Tanga Line passes through Moshi. The line carries cargo mostly cement from Tanga to Moshi and Arusha. There is regular passenger service to Arusha and Dar Es Salaam.

== Sports and Events ==
===Running races===
Moshi hosts the Kilimanjaro Marathon, Tanzania&#x27;s largest sport event, held annually at the end of February or beginning of March since 2002. The race is a member of the Association of International Marathons and Distance Races. Apart from promoting tourism, the race promotes the sport in Tanzania and has the official backing of the Tanzania Tourist Board, Athletics Tanzania, and the International Association of Athletics Federations.

In 2015, 313 persons finished the full marathon, and 2,593 persons finished the half marathon. The race also includes a 5 kilometer (3.1 mile) fun run.

===Hockey===
Moshi has one field hockey pitch, formerly known as Sikh Club and it is home to well known hockey teams from Moshi like Moshi Khalsa and Kili Vijana. Hockey is an active sport in Moshi and it holds tournaments as well such as the annual Nyerere Cup hosted by the Sikh Community.

===Football===
Moshi has several football pitches where players from different ethnicities and backgrounds come together to enjoy the sport. The Ushirika Stadium is the only full - sized pitch where many official league matches have been played including the Tanzanian Premier League. Other pitches include the Hindu Mandal ground and the Moshi Club.

===Golf===
Moshi has two golf courses, Moshi Golf Course operated by Moshi Gymkhana Club (MGC) and TPC Moshi Golf Course operated by TPC Club. The clubs host various national and regional events, annually, coordinated by the Tanzania Golf Union.

== Climate ==
Moshi has a tropical wet and dry climate. Its weather is dominated year round by monsoonal flow. The northeast monsoon prevails December through March and is accompanied by the highest temperatures of the year. The southeast monsoon prevails from June through September. Unique among the world&#x27;s monsoons, both monsoons in Tanzania are divergent in the low levels, shallow (averaging only in depth), and capped by inversion and dry, subsiding air. These factors result in light or insignificant rainfall year-round except during the transitional periods between the monsoons.

Moshi&#x27;s altitude keeps temperatures lower than surrounding cities, even without the maritime effects that a coastal city enjoys. Nighttime temperatures are relatively consistent throughout the year, averaging from 15 to 17 degrees Celsius. Moshi has noticeably warmer daytime temperatures from October through March, when average high temperatures exceed 30 degrees Celsius, and noticeably cooler daytime temperatures from May through August, when average high temperatures are 25 to 26 degrees Celsius.

Moshi&#x27;s wettest months are March through May, when around 71 percent of its annual rainfall occurs.

== Politics ==
Moshi has been the base of opposition politics since the struggle for independence.

The last Mangi Mkuu (Paramount Chief) of the Chagga, Thomas Lenana Marealle II, whose palace was located in Moshi, worked for the independence of Tanganyika when it was still a United Nations trust territory under British administration. In his speech to the United Nations Trusteeship Council on 17 June 1957, he said that Tanganyika could become self-governing within ten to fifteen years. This speech occurred one day before Julius Nyerere addressed the same body.

In 2010, the unsuccessful Chadema presidential candidate, Willibrod Slaa, received 55.6 percent of the popular vote in the Moshi Urban District compared to 43.5 percent for the nationwide winner, Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete of the Chama cha Mapinduzi party.

In 2010, the Chadema parliamentary candidate, Philemon Kiwelu Ndesamburo, was elected to office with 62.3 percent of the vote.

As of May 2012, six of the seven special seats on the Moshi Municipal Council are held by Chadema party members.

== In Literature ==
In 1953, Journalist John Gunther described Moshi as &quot;the kind of town Somerset Maugham, if he ever wrote about Africa, might have invented.&quot;

<doc id="870875" wikidata="Q296924" url="?curid=870875" title="ART image file format">
<text>ART is a proprietary image file format used mostly by the America Online (AOL) service and client software.

== Technical details ==
The ART format (file extension &quot;.art&quot;) holds a single still image that has been highly compressed. The format was designed to facilitate the quick downloading of images, among other things. Originally, the compression was developed by the Johnson-Grace Company, which was then acquired by AOL. When an image is converted to the ART format, the image is analyzed and the software decides what compression technique would be best. The ART format has similarities to the progressive JPEG format, and certain attributes of the ART format can lead to image quality being sacrificed for the sake of image compression (for instance, the image&#x27;s color palette can be limited).

== Usage by AOL ==
The AOL service used the ART image format for most of the image presentation of the online service. In addition, the AOL client&#x27;s web browser also automatically served such images in the ART format to achieve faster downloads on the slower dialup connections that were prevalent in those days. This conversion was done in the AOL proxy servers and could be optionally disabled by the user. This image conversion process effectively reduced the download time for image files. This technology was once branded as Turboweb and is now known as AOL TopSpeed.

== Software support for ART ==
The Graphic Workshop Professional software from Alchemy Mindworks Corp. supports ART files. (With later versions of the Graphic Workshop Professional software, an ART plugin from Alchemy Mindworks is required for this support.) For the Windows 2000 platform, Microsoft released the AOL Image Support Update which added support for ART images. As of June 2006 the Internet Explorer browser no longer supported ART files when Microsoft released a security update. Among other things, this update removed support for ART files from the Internet Explorer browser in order to help prevent issues where invalid ART data could cause the Internet Explorer software to unexpectedly quit. An ART file that is opened with the AOL picture viewer can be saved as another file type.
Software Mfg. Delcam (a subsidiary of Autodesk) has a product called Artcam which uses the ART file extension to create CAD/CAM files.

<doc id="870879" wikidata="Q34208" url="?curid=870879" title="Wakhi language">
<text>Wakhi (, , IPA: ) is an Indo-European language in the Eastern Iranian branch of the language family spoken today in Wakhan District, Northern Afghanistan, and neighboring areas of Tajikistan, Pakistan and China.

==Classification and distribution==
Wakhi is one of several languages that belong to the areal Pamir language group. It is believed to be a descendant of the Scytho-Khotanese language once spoken in the Kingdom of Khotan.

The Wakhi people are occasionally called Pamiris and Guhjali. It is spoken by the inhabitants of the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan, parts of Gilgit-Baltistan (the former NAs) of Pakistan, the Gorno-Badakhshan region of Tajikistan, and Xinjiang in Western China. The Wakhi use the self-appellation &#x27;X̌ik&#x27; (ethnic) and suffix it with &#x27;wor&#x27;/&#x27;war&#x27; to denote their language as &#x27;X̌ik-wor&#x27; themselves. The noun &#x27;X̌ik&#x27; comes from &quot;*waxša-ī̆ka-&quot; (an inhabitant of &quot;*Waxša-&quot; &#x27;Oxus&#x27;, for Wakhan, in Wakhi &#x27;Wux̌.&#x27; There are other equivalents for the name Wakhi (Anglicised) or Wakhani (Arabic and Persian), Vakhantsy (Russian), Gojali/Gojo (Dingrik-wor/Shina), Guyits/Guicho (Burushaski), Wakhigi/Wakhik-war (Kivi-wor/Khow-wor) and Cert (Turki). 

The language belongs, as yet to be confirmed according to studies and sources, to the southern group of the Pamir languages, in the Iranian group of the Indo-European family (450) of languages, where the Ishkashmi, Shighni/...nani and Wakhi languages are included. The Wakhi live in six countries. In the Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan, the Wakhi people mainly live in Gojal, Ishkoman, and Darkut, as well as in Chitral District&#x27;s Broghol. They live in parts of Wakhan in Afghanistan, Gorno-Badakhshan in Tajikistan, and the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County in China, Russia, and Turkey.

===In Afghanistan===
In the Wakhan Corridor of Afghanistan, Wakhi is spoken from Putur, near Ishkashim, to the upper reaches of the Wakhan River.

===In Tajikistan===
In Tajikistan, the Wakhi and other communities that speak one of the Pamir languages refer to themselves as Pamiri or Badakhshani, and there has been a movement to separate their identity from that of the majority of Persian-speaking Tajiks. Linguists universally refer to Wakhi as an East Iranian language independent of Tajik Persian, but many Tajik nationalists insist that Wakhi and other Pamir languages are dialects of Tajik Persian.

===In Pakistan===
In Gilgit-Baltistan, Wakhi is spoken in the sparsely populated upper portions of five of the northernmost valleys: Hunza, Gojal, Ishkoman, Yasin, Gupis, and Yarkhun. The Hunza Valley has the largest Wakhi population in Pakistan. The Wakhis of Ishkoman lives primarily in the Karambar valley, the town of Imit, and beyond. In Yasin, they live mainly in the vicinity of Darkot, and in Yarhkun, they are found in Baroghil and a few other small villages in the high, upper portion of the valley.

In Pakistan, the central organization of the Wakhi is the Wakhi Cultural Association Pakistan (WCA). This organization is registered with the Government of Pakistan and collaborates with the Ministry of Culture and Tourism and Lok Virsa Pakistan. The Association is working to preserve the Wakhi language and culture and document their poetry and music.

Radio Pakistan Gilgit relays the Wakhi radio programme &quot;Sadoyah Boomy Dunyo&quot;, the voice of the roof of the world. The Wakhi Cultural Association has arranged more than twenty programmes since 1984, which include cultural shows, musical nights, and large-scale musical festivals with the collaboration of Lok Virsa Pakistan, the Aga Khan Cultural Service Pakistan (AKCSP), and Pakistan television. In 2000, the WCA won a &quot;Best Programme&quot; organizer award in the Silk Road Festival from the President of Pakistan, Pervez Musharraf. A computerized codification of the Wakhi script has been released, which will help to promote the language development program and documentation of Wakhi poetry, literature, and history.

===In China===

Wakhi is also spoken in the Taxkorgan Tajik Autonomous County, in the Xinjiang province of China, mainly in the township of Dafdar.

===In Russia===
There are approximately 21,000 Wakhi in Russia, Most of them have migrated from Tajikistan and Afghanistan.

===In Turkey===
There are some Wakhi villages in Turkey in the eastern regions, where they have migrated from Afghanistan in 1979 during the Soviet-Afghan war.

==Orthography==
Traditionally, Wakhi was not a written language. Wakhi people live in 4 countries, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Pakistan, and China, and are in contact with speakers of various other languages. Writing systems have been developed for the language using Arabic, Cyrillic, and Latin scripts, each with inspirations from neighboring languages and orthographic conventions. However, due to the pluricentric nature of Wakhi dialects, marginalization in favour of a more significant national/regional language, remoteness, and political instability, no one orthographic standard has managed to rise to the level of a singular unifying writing system.

===Perso-Arabic script===
The Perso-Arabic script for the Wakhi language has been derived from the Persian alphabet used in Afghanistan. However, there are sounds in Wakhi that are not found in Persian. Here, two diverging conventions have emerged, one in Afghanistan and another in Pakistan (and Pakistani-controlled Gilgit-Baltistan). Pashto has inspired letters in Afghanistan to represent missing sounds in Wakhi, especially the various retroflex sounds missing in Persian. Urdu and orthographies of other languages of Gilgit-Baltistan have been the inspiration in Pakistan.

====Afghan Perso-Arabic alphabet====

The below table is the Afghan version of the Perso-Arabic alphabet for the Wakhi language. The alphabet has been derived from the alphabet of Dari (Persian), one of Afghanistan&#x27;s national languages. Pashto, the other national language of Afghanistan, has been the source of letters for phonemes that don&#x27;t exist in Persian. This orthographic standard has similarities to the orthographies of other Pamir languages, such as Shughni and Munji.

Notes:
# Letter &quot;alef&quot; at the beginning of a word can serve two functions. First, it precedes vowel letters &quot; [e] and [i], or &quot; [u]. Second, it acts as a vowel carrier for diacritics of the vowel, &quot; [a].
# Vowel phoneme [ɔ] is represented with &quot; when at the beginning of a word, and with &quot;&quot; when in the middle or end of a word.
# While the letter &quot;se&quot; &quot;&quot; represents the phoneme [θ] in Arabic, this letter in Arabic loanwords that have entered Dari (Persian) have come to be pronounced as [s]. Due to consistent contact with Dari (Persian), Arabic loanwords have entered Wakhi via Persian, with their modified Persian pronunciation. Unlike Persian, Wakhi does have a separate phoneme [θ]. Some sources use the letter &quot;se&quot; &quot;&quot;, whereas others use a new letter, &quot;te with 4 dots&quot; &quot;&quot; that has been introduced so that there can be distinguishment between the native sound [θ] and the sound [s] produced by the letter &quot;se&quot; &quot;&quot; in loanwords.
# While the letter &quot;zal&quot; &quot;&quot; represents the phoneme [ð] in Arabic, this letter in Arabic loanwords that have entered Dari (Persian) have come to be pronounced as [z]. Due to consistent contact with Dari (Persian), Arabic loanwords have entered Wakhi via Persian, with their modified Persian pronunciation. Unlike Persian, Wakhi does have a separate phoneme [ð]. Some sources use the letter &quot;zal&quot; &quot;&quot;, whereas others use a new letter, &quot;dal with 3 dots&quot; &quot;&quot; that has been introduced so that there can be distinguishment between the native sound [ð] and the sound [z] produced by the letter &quot;zal&quot; &quot; in loanwords.
# Represents two phonemes based on context, [w] and [u]. If used at the beginning of a word, if representing consonant [w], it will be written standalone &quot;, if representing a vowel [u], it will be preceded by &quot;alef&quot; &quot;&quot;.
# Represents a vowel phoneme. But even if at the beginning of a word, it is written standalone, and without a preceding &quot;alef&quot;; &quot;&quot;.
# At the end of a word, the letter &quot;he&quot; &quot;&quot; can either represent a consonant sound [h] or a vowel sound [a] depending on context.
# The letter &quot;ye&quot; represents three phonemes based on context, [e], [i] and [j]. If used at the beginning of a word, if representing consonant [j], it will be written standalone &quot;&quot;, if representing a vowel [e] or a vowel [i], it will be preceded by &quot;alef&quot; &quot;&quot;.
# There are two types of &quot;final ye&quot;. in At the end of a word, if representing the consonant [j], the &quot;dotless final ye&quot; &quot;&quot; is ued. If representing the vowel [i], the &quot;double dot final ye&quot; &quot;&quot; is used.

====Pakistani Perso-Arabic alphabet====

The below table is the Pakistani version of the Perso-Arabic alphabet for the Wakhi language.[1] This alphabet has also been derived from the alphabet of Dari (Persian). However, Urdu, Pakistan&#x27;s national language, has been the source of letters for phonemes that don&#x27;t exist in Persian. The vowels are shown to reflect Urdu pronunciations and not the Dari/Tajik pronunciation. Meaning that, for example, the phoneme [ɔ], which is equivalent to Iranian Persianɒː] after having undergone a chain shift, is not written with &quot;alef&quot; &quot;آ / ا /ا ـا‎&quot;, but with the letter &quot;waw&quot; &quot;&quot;.

Stylistically, while in Afghanistan &quot;Naskh&quot; is the more common script, in Pakistan, similar with Urdu and other orthographies of Northern Pakistan and Pakistani-controlled Gilgit-Baltistan, &quot;Nastaliq&quot; is the more common script.

Notes:
# Letter &quot;alef&quot; at the beginning of a word can serve two functions. First, it precedes vowel letters &quot; [e] and [i], or &quot; [ɔ]. Second, it acts as a vowel carrier for diacritics of the vowel, &quot; [ɨ].
# Vowel phoneme [a] is represented with &quot; when at the beginning of a word, and with &quot;&quot; when in the middle or end of a word.

# While the letter &quot;zal&quot; &quot;&quot; represents the phoneme [ð] in Arabic, this letter in Arabic loanwords that have entered Dari (Persian) and Urdu have come to be pronounced as [z]. Due to consistent contact with Dari (Persian) and Urdu, Arabic loanwords have entered Wakhi via Persian and Urdu, with their modified pronunciation. Unlike Persian and Urdu, Wakhi does have a separate phoneme [ð]. Some sources use the letter &quot;zal&quot; &quot;&quot;, whereas others use a new letter, &quot;dal with 2 dots&quot; &quot;&quot; that has been introduced so that there can be distinguishment between the native sound [ð] and the sound [z] produced by the letter &quot;zal&quot; &quot; in loanwords.
# Represents three phonemes based on context, [w], [ɔ], and [u]. If used at the beginning of a word, if representing consonant [w], it will be written standalone &quot;. If representing a vowel [ɔ], it will be preceded by &quot;alef&quot; &quot;&quot;. If representing the vowel [u], it will be preceded by a [w] consonant, carrying a &quot;zammah diacritic&quot; &quot;&quot;.
# At the end of a word, the letter &quot;he&quot; &quot;&quot; can either represent a consonant sound [h] or a vowel sound [a] depending on context.
# The letter &quot;ye&quot; represents three phonemes based on context, [e], [i] and [j]. If used at the beginning of a word, if representing consonant [j], it will be written standalone &quot;&quot;, if representing a vowel [e] or a vowel [i], it will be preceded by &quot;alef&quot; &quot;&quot;.
# There are two types of &quot;final ye&quot;. in At the end of a word, if representing the consonant [j] or the vowel [i], the &quot;small ye&quot; &quot;&quot; is used. If representing the vowel [e], the &quot;big ye&quot; &quot;&quot; is used.

===Cyrillic script===
When Wakhi is written in Cyrillic, the sounds are usually represented by these letters:
===Latin script===
A Latin alphabet, which in some variants includes Cyrillic and Greek letters, was developed in 1953 by I.I. Zaroubine and V. S. Sokolova, and further developed by A.L Grünberg and I.M Stéblinn-Kamensky in the early 1960s:

<text>The 10mm Auto (also known as the 10×25mm, official C.I.P. nomenclature: 10 mm Auto, official SAAMI nomenclature: 10mm Automatic) is a powerful and versatile semi-automatic pistol cartridge introduced in 1983. Its design was adopted and later produced by ammunition manufacturer FFV Norma AB of Åmotfors, Sweden.

Although it was selected for service by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) in 1989 in the aftermath of the 1986 FBI Miami shootout, the cartridge was later decommissioned (except by the Hostage Rescue Team and Special Weapons and Tactics Teams) after their Firearms Training Unit eventually concluded that its recoil was too excessive for training average agents and police officers, and that the pistols chambered for the cartridge were too large to grip well for some small-handed individuals. These issues led to the creation of and following replacement by a shorter, less powerful version of the 10mm that exists today as the .40 S&amp;W. While the 10mm hasn&#x27;t attained the mainstream success of the .40 S&amp;W, it has an enthusiastic group of supporters and users. There are currently more manufacturers offering firearms in this caliber than ever before. 

==History==
When FFV Norma AB (now Norma Precision AB) designed the cartridge at the behest of Dornaus &amp; Dixon Enterprises, Inc. for their Bren Ten pistol (a newly developed handgun with a design inspired by the CZ 75), the company decided to increase the power over Jeff Cooper&#x27;s original concept. The resulting cartridge—which was introduced in 1983 and produced since—is very powerful, retaining the flat trajectory and high energy of a magnum revolver cartridge in a relatively short, versatile rimless cartridge for a semi-automatic pistol.

Quality control issues plagued early acceptance of the caliber, as a result of rushed production to meet numerous (some even defaulted) pre-orders of the pistol it was originally—as well as then being only—chambered for: the Bren Ten. An example is the peculiar circumstances surrounding the pistol&#x27;s distribution at its primary release, leading to a number of initial Bren Tens sent to dealers and customers without magazines (the magazines themselves had complications). The relatively high price of the Bren Ten compared to other pistols of the time (manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price was $500 in 1986, the equivalent of $1,200 United States dollars in 2021) was another factor in its demise, and the company was eventually forced to declare bankruptcy, ceasing operations in 1986 after only three years of inconsistent, substandard production. Had it not been for Colt making the unexpected decision in 1987 to bring out their Delta Elite pistol (a 10mm Auto version of the M1911) and later, the FBI&#x27;s adoption of the caliber in 1989, the cartridge might have sunk into obsolescence, becoming an obscure footnote in firearms history.

Due to media exposure in the television series &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, where one of the lead protagonists had used the pistol as his primary signature weapon, demand for the Bren Ten increased after manufacturing ceased. In the succeeding five years, prices on the Standard Model rose to in excess of U.S. $1,400, and original magazines were selling for over U.S. $150.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation briefly field-tested the 10mm Auto using a M1911 pistol and a Thompson Model 1928 submachine gun as an &quot;urban carbine&quot; before adopting the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 1076 in 1990; a short-barreled version of the Model 1026 with its slide-mounted decock/firing pin block safety supplanted by only a frame-mounted decocker. A contract was signed with Heckler &amp; Koch to produce a quantity of the specialized MP5 utilizing the cartridge, designated MP5/10 for use by their Hostage Rescue Team and Special Weapons and Tactics Teams. Since 1994, both units still field the weapon and caliber to this day.

The 10mm cartridge was selected for Federal Bureau of Investigation use after a Wound Ballistics Seminar at the FBI Academy in September 1987, which managed to agree what a good cartridge would do, but couldn&#x27;t agree if 9mm or .45 ACP could meet FBI requirements. In the same year, an informal test was conducted using a variety of available 9mm and .45 ACP handguns. The test indicated that only the type of 9mm round, described as &quot;147 grain subsonic hollow point round produced by Winchester&quot; had acceptable penetration. The test seemed inconsistent or contradictory to future observers, and it was accused of heavy .45 ACP and American handgun bias. 

According to the latter 10mm report, it was decided: &quot;five shots were fired in each of the 8 penetration tests, providing a total of 40 shots for each caliber or bullet type tested&quot;. The first selected was the 9mm described above. The second was a &quot;.45 round, Remington 185 grain hollow point&quot;. The Wound Ballistic Workshop participants had a &quot;consensus&quot; that hollow points with &quot;superior penetration&quot; was what was needed.

The 10mm was picked as a &quot;halfway&quot; between the other two options, in terms of size. The &quot;commercial loadings&quot; had &quot;high chamber pressures&quot;, which resulted in &quot;heavy recoil&quot; and &quot;muzzle blast&quot;. A 180 grain hollow point bullet was &quot;acquired and handloaded to a velocity of 950 feet per second&quot;. Later on, factory-loaded ammunition was acquired that met their requirements. During the trials, the 10mm was found to be comparable to the .45 ACP (Not surprising as the bullet weight and velocities were now so similar), but the 10mm was found to take up less space and produce shot groups on targets that were half the size. 

As the FBI was adopting a 10mm cartridge closer in bullet weight and velocity to the .45 ACP, there was a need for large amounts of newly built ammunition of this type. This requirement was later submitted to Federal Premium Ammunition for production and further review. This became known as the &quot;10mm Lite&quot;, or &quot;10mm FBI&quot; load, or attenuated 10mm, remaining common from various manufacturers today. With some pistol reliability problems increasing in this lighter load, Smith &amp; Wesson observed that a version of the 10mm case reduced to 22 millimeters in length from the original 25 mm could be made with the retained performance parameters of the &quot;10mm Lite&quot;. This altered cartridge was named the .40 Smith &amp; Wesson. The shorter case allowed use in pistols designed with similar dimensions to those chambered in 9×19mm Parabellum, with the advantage that smaller-handed shooters could now have smaller-frame semi-automatic handguns. Colloquially called the &quot;Forty Cal&quot; and other synonyms, this innovation since became a common handgun cartridge among law enforcement agencies and civilians in the United States, while the parent 10mm Auto remains fairly popular and has shown a resurgence in recent years particularly among hunters.

Colt re-released their Colt Delta Elite series as generation 2 starting in 2009 where it ran until 2015. From 2016 to present, generation 2.5 has been in production. In 2015, SIG Sauer entered the 10mm marketplace with their P220 model chambered in 10mm. Ruger introduced a 10mm auto model to their popular SR1911 line in mid 2017, followed by their Blackhawk, Redhawk and 10mm GP100 Match Champion and Wiley Clapp models in 2018. The Springfield Armory XD-M series added a 10mm offering in late 2018. In November 2021, Smith &amp; Wesson introduced 10mm Auto models in the M&amp;P 2.0 series. In 2022 SIG released the 10mm Auto P320-XTEN in the P320 series. In 2024 Taurus released their first 10mm pistol, the 10mm Auto TH10 pistol in the hammer-fired TH line.

== Dimensions ==
The 10mm Auto has 1.56 milliliter (24.1 grain ) cartridge case capacity.

10mm Auto maximum CIP cartridge dimensions

The common rifling twist rate for this cartridge is 406.40 mm (1 in 16 inches), 6 grooves, Ø lands = 9.91 mm (.390 in), Ø grooves = 10.17 mm (.4005 in), and land width = 3.05 mm (.120 in). A large or small pistol primer is used.

The CIP rulings indicate a maximum pressure of . In CIP-regulated countries, every pistol/cartridge combination is required to be proofed at 130% of this maximum CIP pressure to certify for sale to consumers.

The SAAMI maximum pressure limit for the 10mm Auto is set at .

==Performance==
At mid-range potential, the 10mm Auto produces energy higher than an average mainstream .357 Magnum. The 10mm is slightly less powerful than the .357 Magnum with high-performing commercially-available ammunition, or hand-loaded .357 magnums, and well below standard .41 Magnum rounds. The cartridge is considered to be high-velocity, giving it a less arcing flight path upon firing (also termed &quot;flat-shooting&quot;) relative to other handgun cartridges. More powerful loadings can basically equal the highest performing .357 Magnum loads, and retain more kinetic energy at 100 yards than the .45 ACP has at the muzzle.

The 10mm outperforms the .40 S&amp;W by for similar bullet weights when using available full-power loads, as opposed to the &quot;10mm FBI&quot; level loads still found in some ammunition catalogs. This result is due to the 10mm Auto&#x27;s higher SAAMI pressure rating of , as opposed to for the .40 S&amp;W, and the larger case capacity, which allows the use of heavier bullets and more smokeless powder.

==Usage==


The 10mm Auto is marketed for hunting, defensive, and tactical use and is one of the few semi-automatic, rimless cartridges that is legal for hunting white-tailed deer in many U.S. states. The round makes the &quot;Major&quot; power factor ranking in the International Practical Shooting Confederation, even in lighter loadings.

The FBI Hostage Rescue Team, Special Weapons and Tactics Teams, and various other law enforcement agencies continue to issue or authorize the use of 10mm, including: the Coconut Creek Police Department, Glasgow, Montana Police Department, Weimar Police Department, and the San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) Police Department.

In military use, the government of Denmark has issued the Glock 20 to the &quot;Slædepatruljen Sirius&quot; (Sirius Sledge Patrol) headquartered in Daneborg, Northeast Greenland. The pistols were issued as a last resort defence against polar bears which the unit encounters during patrols.

<text>A plasma ball, plasma globe, or plasma lamp is a clear glass container filled with noble gases, usually a mixture of neon, krypton, and xenon, that has a high-voltage electrode in the center of the container. When voltage is applied, a plasma is formed within the container. Plasma filaments extend from the inner electrode to the outer glass insulator, giving the appearance of multiple constant beams of colored light. Plasma balls were popular as novelty items in the 1980s.

The plasma lamp was invented by Nikola Tesla, during his experimentation with high-frequency currents in an evacuated glass tube for the purpose of studying high voltage phenomena. Tesla called his invention an &quot;inert gas discharge tube&quot;. The modern plasma lamp design was developed by James Falk and MIT student Bill Parker.

A crackle tube is a related device filled with phosphor-coated beads.

== Construction ==
Although many variations exist, a plasma ball is usually a clear glass sphere filled with a mixture of various gases (most commonly neon, sometimes with other noble gases such as argon, xenon and krypton) at nearly atmospheric pressure. 

Plasma balls are driven by high-frequency (approximately ) alternating current at . The drive circuit is essentially a specialized power inverter, in which current from a lower-voltage DC supply powers a high-frequency electronic oscillator circuit whose output is stepped up by a high-frequency, high-voltage transformer, for example a miniature Tesla coil or a flyback transformer. The radio-frequency energy from the transformer is transmitted into the gas within the ball through an electrode at its center. Additionally, some designs utilize the ball as a resonant cavity, which provides positive feedback to the drive transistor through the transformer. A much smaller hollow glass orb can also serve as an electrode when it is filled with metal wool or a conducting fluid that is in communication with the transformer output. In this case, the radio-frequency energy is admitted into the larger space by capacitive coupling right through the glass. Plasma filaments extend from the inner electrode to the outer glass insulator, giving the appearance of moving tendrils of colored light within the volume of the ball . If a hand is placed close to the ball it produces a faint smell of ozone, as the gas is produced by high voltage interaction with atmospheric oxygen.

Some balls have a control knob that varies the amount of power going to the center electrode. At the very lowest setting that will light or &quot;strike&quot; the ball, a single tendril is made. This single tendril&#x27;s plasma channel engages enough space to transmit this lowest striking energy to the outside world through the glass of the ball. As the power is increased, this single channel&#x27;s capacity is overwhelmed and a second channel forms, then a third, and so on. The tendrils each compete for a footprint on the inner orb as well. The energies flowing through these are all of the same polarity, so they repel each other as like charges: a thin dark boundary surrounds each footprint on the inner electrode.

The ball is prepared by pumping out as much air as is practical. The ball is then backfilled with neon to a pressure similar to one atmosphere. If the radio-frequency power is turned on, if the ball is &quot;struck&quot; or &quot;lit&quot;, now, the whole ball will glow a diffuse red. If a little argon is added, the filaments will form. If a very small amount of xenon is added, the &quot;flowers&quot; will bloom at the ends of the filaments.

The neon available for purchase for a neon-sign shop often comes in glass flasks at the pressure of a partial vacuum. These cannot be used to fill a ball with a useful mixture. Tanks of gas, each with its specific, proper, pressure regulator and fitting, are required: one for each of the gases involved.

Of the other noble gases, radon is radioactive, helium escapes through the glass relatively quickly, and krypton is expensive. Other gases such as mercury vapor can be used. Molecular gases may be dissociated by the plasma.

== Interaction ==

Placing a finger tip on the glass creates an attractive spot for the energy to flow because the conductive human body (having an internal resistance less than 1000 ohms) is more easily polarized than the dielectric material around the electrode (i.e. the gas within the ball) providing an alternative discharge path having less resistance. Therefore, the capacity of the large conducting body to accept radio frequency energy is greater than that of the surrounding air. The energy available to the filaments of plasma within the ball will preferentially flow toward the better acceptor. This flow also causes a single filament, from the inner ball to the point of contact, to become brighter and thinner. The filament is brighter because there is more current flowing through it and into the human body, which has a capacitance of about 100 pF. The filament is thinner because the magnetic fields around it, augmented by the now-higher current flowing through it, cause a magnetohydrodynamic effect called pinch: the plasma channel&#x27;s own magnetic fields create a force acting to compress the size of the plasma channel itself.
Much of the movement of the filaments is due to heating of the gas around the filament. When gas along the filament is heated, it becomes more buoyant and rises, carrying the filament with it. If the filament is discharging into a fixed object (like a hand) on the side of the ball, it will begin to deform into a curved path between the central electrode and the object. When the distance between the electrode and the object becomes too great to maintain, the filament will break and a new filament will reform between the electrode and the hand .

An electric current is produced within any conductive object near the orb. The glass acts as a dielectric in a capacitor formed between the ionized gas and the hand.

==History==

In (&quot;Incandescent Electric Light&quot;, 1894 February 6), Nikola Tesla describes a plasma lamp. This patent is for one of the first high-intensity discharge lamps. Tesla used an incandescent-type lamp ball with a single internal conductive element and excited the element with high voltage currents from a Tesla coil, thus creating the brush discharge emanation. He gained patent protection on a particular form of the lamp in which a light-giving small body or button of refractory material is supported by a conductor entering a very highly exhausted ball or receiver. Tesla called this invention the single terminal lamp, or, later, the &quot;Inert Gas Discharge Tube&quot;.

The Groundstar style of plasma ball was created by James Falk and marketed to collectors and science museums in the 1970s and 1980s. Jerry Pournelle in 1984 praised Orb Corporation&#x27;s Omnisphere as &quot;the most fabulous object in the entire world&quot; and &quot;magnificent ... a new kind of art object&quot;, stating &quot;you can&#x27;t buy mine for any price&quot;. 

The technology needed to formulate gas mixtures used in today&#x27;s plasma spheres was not available to Tesla. Modern lamps typically use combinations of xenon, krypton and neon, although other gases can be used. These gas mixtures, along with different glass shapes and integrated-circuit-driven electronics, create the vivid colors, range of motions, and complex patterns seen in today&#x27;s plasma spheres.

==Applications==
Plasma balls are mainly used as curiosities or toys for their unique lighting effects and the &quot;tricks&quot; that can be performed on them by users moving their hands around them. They might also form part of a school&#x27;s laboratory equipment for demonstration purposes. They are not usually employed for general lighting. However, in recent years, some novelty stores have begun selling miniature plasma ball nightlights that can be mounted on a standard light socket.

Plasma balls can be used for experimenting with high voltages. If a conductive plate or wire coil is placed on the ball, capacitive coupling can transfer enough voltage to the plate or coil to produce a small arc or energize a high voltage load. This is possible because the plasma inside the ball and the conductor outside it act as plates of a capacitor, with the glass in between as a dielectric. A step-down transformer connected between the plate and the ball&#x27;s electrode can produce lower-voltage, higher-current radio frequency output. Careful earth grounding is essential to prevent injury or damage to equipment.

==Hazards==
Bringing conductive materials or electronic devices close to a plasma ball may cause the glass to become hot. The high voltage radio frequency energy coupled to them from within the ball may cause a mild electric shock to the person touching, even through a protective glass casing. The radio frequency field produced by plasma balls can interfere with the operation of touchpads used on laptop computers, digital audio players, cell phones, and other similar devices. Some types of plasma ball can radiate sufficient radio frequency interference (RFI) to interfere with cordless telephones and Wi-Fi devices several feet or some meters away.

If an electrical conductor touches the outside of the ball, capacitive coupling can induce enough potential on it to produce a small arc. This is possible because the ball&#x27;s glass acts as a capacitor dielectric: the inside of the lamp acts as one plate, and the conductive object on the outside acts as the opposite capacitor plate. This is a dangerous action that can damage the ball or other electronic devices, and presents a fire ignition hazard.

Perceptible amounts of ozone can be formed on the surface of a plasma ball. Many people can detect ozone at concentrations of , which is right below the lowest concentration at which ozone is considered harmful to health. Exposure of produces headaches, burning eyes, and irritation to the respiratory passages.

In July 2022, a spark from a plasma globe at the &quot;Questacon&quot; museum in Australia ignited the alcohol-based hand sanitiser that had been applied to a child&#x27;s hands leaving them with serious burns.

<doc id="870890" wikidata="Q5908738" url="?curid=870890" title="Hospital medicine">
<text>Hospital medicine is a medical specialty that exists in some countries as a branch of family medicine or internal medicine, dealing with the care of acutely ill hospitalized patients. Physicians whose primary professional focus is caring for hospitalized patients only while they are in the hospital are called hospitalists. Originating in the United States, this type of medical practice has extended into Australia and Canada. The vast majority of physicians who refer to themselves as hospitalists focus their practice upon hospitalized patients. Hospitalists are not necessarily required to have separate board certification in hospital medicine. 

The term &quot;hospitalist&quot; was first coined by Robert Wachter and Lee Goldman in a 1996 &quot;New England Journal of Medicine&quot; article. The scope of hospital medicine includes acute patient care, teaching, research, and executive leadership related to the delivery of hospital-based care. Hospital medicine, like emergency medicine, is a specialty organized around the location of care (the hospital), rather than an organ (like cardiology), disease (like oncology), or a patient’s age (like pediatrics). The emergence of hospital medicine in the United States can be compared and contrasted with the parallel development of acute medicine in the United Kingdom, reflecting health system differences.

==Complex work practices==

In the US, a typical hospitalist workday in the hospital lasts roughly 10 hours, arriving around 7 a.m. and taking care of a &quot;census&quot; of 14 to 18 patients. Hospitalists typically embrace the rhythm of a &quot;7 on 7 off&quot; schedule, starting each seven-day stretch on a Tuesday and ending on a Monday. While these are typical, what counts as a normal workday, census, and shift schedule can vary from hospital to hospital.

A hospitalist is like a football quarterback, a central node coordinating patient care for hospitalized inpatients for the duration of their stay. Compared to other medical specialties, hospitalists must work more closely with a much broader range of other healthcare professionals, such as specialist physicians, bedside nurses, charge nurses, pharmacists, and case managers. On a typical day in a hospital, a hospitalist is likely to have 10 to 30 different colleagues with whom they are collaborating on patient care. 

When combined with the complexities of hospital medicine, complex interprofessional collaboration tends to allow for unnecessary miscommunication, oversight, errors, and delays. Attempts to reduce this complexity and standardize interprofessional collaboration have resulted in care models like interdisciplinary bedside rounds that emphasize face-to-face communication, a contrast with communication that occurs solely through the electronic medical record, secure chat, pages, and calls.

==By country==

===Australia===
In Australia, hospitalists are career hospital doctors; they are generalist medical practitioners whose principal focus is the provision of clinical care to patients in hospitals; they are typically beyond the internship-residency phase of their career, but have decidedly chosen as a conscious career choice not to partake in vocational-specialist training to acquire fellowship specialist qualification. Whilst not specialists, these clinicians are nonetheless experienced in their years of medical practice, and depending on their scope of practice, they typically work with a reasonable degree of independence and autonomy under the auspices of their specialist colleagues and supervisors. Hospitalists form a demographically small but important workforce of doctors in hospitals across Australia where on-site specialist coverage is otherwise unavailable. 

Hospitalists are typically employed in a variety of public and private hospital settings on a contractual or salaried basis. Dependent on their place of employment and duties, the responsibilities and remuneration of non-specialist hospitalists are usually comparable to somewhere between registrars and consultants. Despite the common trend for clinicians to specialise nowadays, non-specialist hospitalist clinicians have an important role in fulfilling shortages in the medical workforce, especially when specialist coverage or accessibility is unavailable and where there is an area-of-need or after-hours or on-site medical care is required. These clinicians and employed across Australia in a variety of environments which include Medical &amp; Surgical Wards, Intensive Care Units and Emergency Departments. Nonetheless, these clinicians work closely and continually consult with the relevant attending specialists on-call; that is, final responsibility and care for the patient ultimately still rests with the attending specialist.

They are also known as: Career Medical Officers (CMO), Senior Medical Officers (SMO) and Multi-skilled Medical Officers (MMO). 

Hospitalists are represented by the Australian Medical Association (AMA), Australasian Society of Career Medical Officers (ASCMO) and Australian Salaried Medical Officers Federation (AMSOF). Despite being non-specialist clinicians, they are still required to meet continuing professional development requirements and frequently attend courses facilitated by these organisations and hospitals to keep their practice and skillets up-to-date alongside their specialist registered colleagues.

===Canada===
In Canada, there are currently no official residency programs specializing in hospital medicine. Nevertheless, some universities, such as McGill University in Montreal, have come up with family medicine enhanced skills programs focused on hospital medicine. This program, which is available to practicing physicians and family medicine residents, has a duration of six or twelve months. The main goal behind the program is to prepare medical doctors with training in family practice to assume shared care roles with other specialists, such as cardiologists, neurologists, and nephrologists, in a hospital setting. Moreover, the program prepares family physicians by giving them a set of skills required for caring for their complicated hospitalized patients.

===United States===

====Training====
Hospitalists are physicians with a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.), Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.), or a Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS/MBChB) degree. Most hospitalists practicing in hospitals in the United States lack board certification in hospital medicine. To address this, residency programs are starting to develop hospitalist tracks with more tailored education. Several universities have also started fellowship programs specifically geared toward hospital medicine.

According to the State of Hospital Medicine Survey by the Medical Group Management Association and the Society of Hospital Medicine, 89.60% of hospitalists specialize in general internal medicine, 5.5% in a pediatrics subspecialty, 3.7% in family practice and 1.2% in internal medicine pediatrics. Data from the survey also reported that 53.5% of hospitalists are employed by hospitals/integrated delivery system and 25.3% are employed by independent hospitalists groups.

According to recent data, there are more than 50,000 hospitalists practicing in approximately 75% of U.S. hospitals, including all highly ranked academic medical centers.

====History====
Hospital medicine is a relatively new phenomenon in American medicine and as such is the fastest growing specialty in the history of medicine. Almost unheard of a generation ago, this type of practice arose from three powerful shifts in medical practice:
*Nearly all states, as well as the national residency accreditation organizations, the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) and the American Osteopathic Association (AOA), have established limitations on house staff duty hours, the number of hours that interns and residents can work. Many hospitalists are coming to perform the same tasks formerly performed by residents; although this is usually referred to as a House Officer rather than a hospitalist. The fundamental difference between a hospitalist and a house officer is that the hospitalist is the attending physician of a patient while that patient is hospitalized. The house officer admits the patient for another attending physician and cares for that patient until the attending physician can see the patient.
*Most primary care physicians are experiencing a shrinking role in hospital care. Many primary care physicians find they can generate more revenue in the office during the hour or more they would have spent on inpatient rounds, including traveling to and from the hospital.

In addition to patient care duties, hospitalists are often involved in developing and managing aspects of hospital operations such as inpatient flow and quality improvement. The formation of hospitalist training tracks in residency programs has been driven in part by the need to educate future hospitalists about business and operational aspects of medicine, as these topics are not covered in traditional residencies.

====Certification====
As a relatively new specialty, only recently has certification for specialty experience and training for hospital medicine been offered. The American Board of Hospital Medicine (ABHM), a Member Board of the American Board of Physician Specialties (ABPS), was founded in 2009. The ABHM was North America’s first board of certification devoted exclusively to hospital medicine. In September 2009, the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) created a program that provides general internists practicing in hospital settings the opportunity to maintain Internal Medicine Certification with a Focused Practice in Hospital Medicine (FPHM).

====Employment====
The number of available hospitalists positions grew exponentially from 2006 to 2010 but has since then leveled off. However, the job market still remained very active with some hospitals maintaining permanent openings for capable hospitalists. Salaries are generally very competitive, averaging almost $230,000 per year for adult hospitalists. Hospitalists who are willing to work night shifts only (nocturnists) are generally compensated higher than their day shift peers.

====Hospitalist groups as employers====
Hospitalists typically work for a hospitalist group that is employed either directly through the hospital or through a physician services company, which earns a multimillion-dollar subsidy from the hospital to operate the group. This arrangement is a contrast to other physician specialties which typically recoup their costs directly though their billing for medical services. 

As of 2023, there are around seven large national physician services companies which compete to provide the hospitalist group for health systems, along with many smaller companies. Most of these companies, however, traditionally focus on the emergency department, where billing is lucrative and margins are higher, and they accept the hospitalist group management partnership as a necessary and less profitable add-on.

From the perspective of a hospital CFO, hospitalists require large subsidies that other physicians may not need. The drive to minimize these subsidies incentivizes the reduction of shifts and increase of a hospitalist&#x27;s average patient census, which can in turn decrease hospitalist job satisfaction and increase risks to patient safety. Whether these incentives are acted on depends on the financial situation of the hospital, the relationship between the hospitalist group and the hospital, and the working conditions acceptable to the employed hospitalists.

==Quality initiatives==
Research shows that hospitalists reduce the length of stay, treatment costs and improve the overall efficiency of care for hospitalized patients. Hospitalists are leaders on several quality improvement initiatives in key areas including transitions of care, co-management of patients, reducing hospital acquired diseases and optimizing the care of patients.

==Related terminology==
Though hospital medicine is a young field, there have been attempts at further division of labor in the field. 
* A &quot;nocturnist&quot; is a hospitalist who typically covers the twelve-hour shift at night and admits patients as well as receives calls about already admitted patients.
* A &quot;proceduralist&quot; is generally defined as a hospitalist who primarily does procedures in the hospital such as central venous catheter insertions, lumbar punctures, and paracenteses.
* A &quot;neurohospitalist&quot; cares for hospitalized patients with or at risk for neurological problems.
* A &quot;surgicalist&quot; is a surgeon who specializes and focuses on surgical care in the hospital setting.

The following are other commonly used (negative) nicknames:
* An &quot;admitologist&quot; or &quot;admitter&quot; is a hospitalist who only admits patients.
* A &quot;dischargologist&quot; is a hospitalist who only discharges patients.
* A &quot;rounder&quot; is a hospitalist who only sees admitted patients.

<text>Torrey Pines Golf Course is a 36-hole municipal golf facility in La Jolla, a community of San Diego, California. The course sits on the coastal cliffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean, just south of Torrey Pines State Natural Reserve. Opened in 1957, it was built on the site of Camp Callan, a U.S. Army installation during World War II. Torrey Pines has two 18-hole courses, North and South, designed by William Francis Bell. The course is named for the Torrey pine, a rare tree that grows in the area. 

Since the late 1960s, Torrey Pines has hosted the PGA Tour&#x27;s Farmers Insurance Open, originally known as the San Diego Open. Held annually in January or February, the tournament uses both courses for the first two rounds and the South Course for the final two rounds. The South Course has hosted two U.S. Open championships: Tiger Woods won in 2008 and Jon Rahm won in 2021.

Torrey Pines hosted the Genesis Invitational in February 2025 after the tournament&#x27;s home course Riviera Country Club was affected by the LA wildfires. 
==2008 U.S. Open==
Tiger Woods won the 2008 U.S. Open over Rocco Mediate in a 19-hole Monday playoff. After completing the 18-hole playoff on the South Course tied at even par 71, they went to sudden-death on the 91st hole, played on the par-4 7th hole. Mediate had trouble off of the tee and made bogey, while Woods made par to gain his third U.S. Open and fourteenth career major title, which put him just four behind Jack Nicklaus. He birdied the final hole on Sunday to force the playoff and again on Monday to extend it. Woods, age 32, won while playing with a stress fracture and torn ACL; this was his last major title until 2019.

==Popular culture==
Torrey Pines is a featured golf course in the &quot;&quot; (1990), &quot;Microsoft Golf 2.0&quot; (1995), &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 2003&quot;, &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 10&quot;, &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 13,&quot; and &quot;Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14&quot;.

Scott Peterson, previously on death row for the murder of his wife Laci, was arrested in the parking lot of Torrey Pines in

<doc id="870898" wikidata="Q1412977" url="?curid=870898" title="Firing pin">
<text>A firing pin or striker is a part of the firing mechanism of a firearm that impacts the primer in the base of a cartridge and causes it to fire. In firearms terminology, a striker is a particular type of firing pin where a compressed spring acts directly on the firing pin to provide the impact force rather than it being struck by a hammer.

The terms may also be used for a component of equipment or a device which has a similar function. Such equipment or devices include: artillery, munitions and pyrotechnics.

==Firearms==
The typical firing pin is a thin, simple rod with a hardened, rounded tip that strikes and crushes the primer. The rounded end ensures the primer is indented rather than pierced (to contain propellant gasses). It sits within a hole through the breechblock and is struck by the hammer when the trigger is &quot;pulled&quot;. A light firing-pin spring is often used to keep the firing pin rearward. It may be termed a &quot;firing-pin return spring&quot;, since it returns it to the unfired position. In semi-automatic firearms, this prevents premature firing from the inertia of the firing pin as the breech mechanism closes in the reloading part of the firing cycle. Firing pins of this type are often too short to contact the primer when the hammer is resting against it. This is a safety measure to prevent discharge from external forces such as a drop. Firing relies upon the transfer of momentum from the hammer to give the firing pin sufficient impact energy to cause firing.

===Type of cartridge===

The two main types of metallic cartridges used in modern firearms are centerfire and rimfire. In centerfire cartridges, the primer is located in the center of the base of the cartridge. Firing pins for centerfire cartridges usually have a round cross-section and their movement is usually through a hole in the breechblock along the axis of the center of the barrel&#x27;s bore.

Rimfire cartridges however, must be struck on the base about the rim of the cartridge. While rimfire firearms may use a firing pin with a round cross-section, it is common for them to be flat, with a square or rectangular cross-section and a blunt chisel point. Flat firing pins can be stamped from flat metal stock and usually operate in a slot cut in the breechblock (rather than a hole) that is parallel but offset from the centerline of the barrel. These production methods are generally simpler and reduce production costs. It is generally recommended not to excessively &quot;dry fire&quot; rimfire firearms (ie firing without a chambered round) as it is possible for the firing pin to strike the face of the camber and deform it or damage the firing pin.

====Historical cartridges====

In 1808 by the Swiss gunsmith Jean Samuel Pauly in association with French gunsmith François Prélat created the first cartridges to integrate a primer and be self-contained. The paper cartridge used a metal base with a through-hole coated in a percussive priming compound. Pauly also developed a breech-loading shotgun for his cartridge, using a firing pin and external hammer.

The Dreyse needle gun of 1836 uses a paper cartridge with a priming as part of a sabot which cradles the projectile and is forward of the propelling charge. The needle-like firing pin projects from the bolt-face and pierces the cartridge when the breech is closed. On firing, the spring-loaded needle strikes the priming in the sabot. Unlike Pauly&#x27;s cartridge, which was not widely accepted, Dreyse&#x27;s rifle was adopted by Prussia as its infantry service rifle. It was the first military breechloader to use a self-contained cartridge and consequently, the first to employ a firing pin.

The pinfire cartridge patented in 1835, uses a metallic cartridge with an integrated firing pin located radially near the base of the cartridge. The pin needs to be aligned with a corresponding slot in the chamber; a disadvantage compared with rimfire and centerfire cartridges that followed and that are also safer.

===Side-lock hammers===

Early rifle designs that fired metallic cartridges typically used a side-lock mechanism, with the hammer mounted to one side rather than inline with the axis of the barrel. In the trapdoor Springfield Model 1865 (and similar) the rear of the firing pin tube within the breechblock is angled away from the centerline of the barrel toward the hammer. The Sharps rifle uses a firing pin block to solve this alignment problem. The block sits within a recess in the breechblock. When struck by the hammer, the whole block is propelled forward. That part of the block with the firing pin sits on the centerline of the barrel and strikes the primer.

===Fixed firing pins===

Many revolvers use a firing pin that is fixed to the hammer. Simple blowback sub-machine guns that fire from the open-bolt position often have a fixed firing pin that protrudes from the face of the bolt. As the bolt fully closes on the breech the primer of the newly chambered round is struck, causing the cartridge to fire. The Owen and F1 submachine gun are examples that use bolt-face fixed firing-pins. Some mortars use a fixed firing pin mounted in the breech plug. When a mortar round is dropped down the barrel, a primer in the base of the mortar round strikes the firing pin and ignites the propelling charge.

===Floating firing pins===

In firearms terminology, a floating firing pin is one which is unrestricted by a firing-pin return spring or similar. While it will be captive and unable to simply fall out, either forward or backward, it is otherwise free to slide within these stops. The trapdoor Springfield Model 1865 is an example of a floating firing pin.

===Striker===


Hammer-operated firing mechanisms use a relatively light firing pin and rely on a transfer of momentum received from a spring-loaded hammer, in the same fashion as a punch or chisel relays the blow from a mallet. In firearms terminology, a &quot;striker&quot; (or striker mechanism) derives the impact force to strike the primer from a spring acting directly upon the &quot;firing pin&quot; – similar to a crossbow, where the striker (firing pin) is like the crossbow bolt (arrow). A striker mechanism is very common in bolt-action firearms but not to the exclusion of hammer-operated mechanisms. It is also found in other actions where the breechblock reciprocates directly inline with the axis of the barrel.

A striker mechanism will consist of the striker spring (firing spring) and the striker. The striker spring is a relatively strong spring sufficient to initiate firing. A typical striker consists of a narrow striking point, a heavier section that acts as a spring guide for the striker spring, a shoulder to restrain the spring, and a catch piece which is engaged by the trigger sear to hold the spring under tension when &quot;cocked&quot; and ready to fire. The striker spring is compressed between the striker&#x27;s shoulder and the rear of the breechblock. A striker may be assembled from several component; however, the stored energy in the striker spring is transferred directly to the striker and then to the primer without any intermediate transfer of energy or momentum. As striker mechanisms combine both functions of hammer and firing pin in one piece, they are generally considered to be mechanically simpler but are more robust in construction than a typical firing pin.

Many small-caliber rimfire bolt-action rifles and some centerfire automatic weapons (e. g., vz. 58) may appear to have a striker-operated firing mechanism but are actually a type of linear hammer. The hammer can be likened to that of a pile driver and is mainly contained within the bolt. It is much like the striker already described except that the &quot;hammer&quot; upon which the firing spring acts and the firing pin are separate units. Confusingly, parts lists will often refer to this type of hammer as a &quot;striker&quot;.

Striker-fired (or similar) bolt action firearms may be classified as &quot;cock-on-close&quot; or &quot;cock-on-open&quot;.

====Cock-on-close====

When the breech is opened and retracted rearward, the striker is also carried rearward so that the striker catch passes over the trigger sear. When the bolt is pushed forward to close the breech, the striker catch is held by the trigger sear. The firer must close the bolt with sufficient force to overcome the force exerted by the cocking spring. Notably, the Lee–Enfield and Belgian Mauser cock on closing as do many small-caliber rimfire bolt-action rifles.

====Cock-on-open====

The breech of a bolt action rifle is opened by first rotating the bolt handle. In cock-on-open operation, this rotation acts on a cam (similar to the action of a screw thread) which retracts the striker, compressing the cocking spring and holding it there. When the cocking handle is rotated closed, the cocking cam disengages but the striker is retained in the cocked position by the trigger sear.

Introduced in the Mauser Model 1871, it significantly reduced the risk of accidental discharge upon closing. The system of operation was widely adopted and is used almost exclusively in modern centerfire rifle designs. The Mauser Gewehr 98, the Mosin–Nagant and M1903 Springfield are examples of service rifles using this type of operation.

==Other applications==

Modern era guns in general (and not just firearms) use a firing pin of some description to initiate firing. Mechanical contact fuzes in explosive ordnance will employ a firing pin or striker to initiate detonation. Such devices include: artillery projectiles, aerial bombs and land mines. In landmines, non-metallic firing pins, made from ceramics for example, may be used to minimise their magnetic signature.

The M127A1 signal rocket (and other similar flares) have a primer in the base of the disposable launch tube. The cap contains a fixed firing-pin inside. The flare is fired by placing the cap over the base and striking it by hand.

Hand grenades of the type that use a safety lever (such as the M26 grenade) use a striker that is similar to the classic spring-loaded mousetrap. It is held under tension until the lever is released and then flips over to strike the primer cap. Some chemical oxygen generators use a primer and mousetrap type striker to initiate the chemical reaction.

<doc id="870900" wikidata="Q5220378" url="?curid=870900" title="Danny Gardella">
<text>Daniel Lewis Gardella (February 26, 1920 – March 6, 2005) was an American professional baseball player who played most of his Major League Baseball (MLB) career as a left fielder with the New York Giants from to . Born in New York City, he batted and threw left-handed.

Gardella is best known as one of the handful of MLB players who &quot;jumped&quot; their organized baseball teams to play in the &quot;outlaw&quot; Mexican League in 1946. After being blacklisted by Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler, Gardella filed suit against MLB, arguing that the reserve clause (and by extension, MLB&#x27;s antitrust exemption) was illegal. The case, which was settled out of court, preceded the Seitz decision that would eventually guarantee MLB players free agency.

==Career==
Gardella was a longshoreman at the Jersey City naval shipyard when he was discovered by a Giants scout in 1944, as a player on a semipro shipyard team. He played six weeks with the minor league Jersey City Giants before debuting with New York on May 14, 1944.

Known more for his on-field antics than his playing ability, Gardella would often walk on his hands, and perform other acrobatic stunts. He was also one of the first players to train with weights. Nevertheless, he was the first major league player who challenged baseball&#x27;s reserve clause in an early chapter in the labor-management skirmishes that brought free agency and multimillion-dollar player contracts.

===Major League Baseball===
In a three-season career, Gardella compiled a .267 batting average with 24 home runs and 85 RBI in 169 games. His most productive season came in 1945, when he hit .272 with 18 home runs and 71 RBI in 121 games. In that season, some of his teammates included Ernie Lombardi, Mel Ott, Joe Medwick and Bill Voiselle.

===Mexican League===
However, in 1946, the Giants were interested in players returning from World War II military service. Gardella had been offered US$5,000 to play for the Giants, a raise of $500 from his salary the year before; he returned the contract unsigned, hoping to renegotiate at spring training. However, after arriving in Miami, Gardella was informed by manager Mel Ott that even if he did sign the contract, his career with the Giants was over and he would be put on the trade block.

Three days later, Gardella announced he had accepted an $13,000 offer to play in Mexico; the outfielder had met and befriended Mexican League president Jorge Pasquel over the offseason at a New York gym. Pasquel had also made generous offers to other major leaguers; pitchers Sal Maglie, Alex Carrasquel and Max Lanier and catcher Mickey Owen all defected to Mexico, despite the objections of their major league clubs.

In 100 games with the Azules de Veracruz, Gardella batted .275 with 13 home runs and 64 runs batted in. Veracruz manager Ramón Bragaña chose to play Gardella, naturally a left fielder, at first base. He was named to the Mexican League All-Star Game on July 9, 1946 as part of the Southern squad, where he hit two home runs.

Commissioner of Baseball Happy Chandler imposed a ban of at least five years on all the players who had gone to the Mexican League for violating the reserve clause. Shortstop Vern Stephens also joined the exodus but immediately returned before the season started to escape the sanction. The first player to learn of Chandler&#x27;s seriousness was Owen, who returned the same year, asked for clemency, and was refused.

== &quot;Gardella v. Chandler&quot; ==
In October 1947, unable to get a baseball job in the major or minor leagues after playing in Mexico, Gardella sued the Major League Baseball hierarchy and the Giants in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeking $300,000 in damages. He charged that the reserve clause was &quot;monopolistic and restrains trade.&quot; A year later, the case was dismissed by a federal judge who cited a 1922 Supreme Court ruling that found baseball was not a business engaged in interstate commerce within the meaning of federal antitrust law. But in February 1949, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-to-1 ruling, sent the case back to the district court and ordered a trial on Gardella&#x27;s contentions.

In June 1949, faced with the prospect of a courtroom defeat, Chandler offered amnesty to the players who had gone to the Mexican League. Gardella, warned by his lawyer that he faced a long and costly legal battle, dropped his lawsuit. He said later that he received a $60,000 settlement from baseball.

==Later years==
In 1950 Gardella signed with the St. Louis Cardinals, but was sent to the minors after one at bat and never again played in the major leagues. After leaving the game, he worked in a warehouse, as a hospital orderly and as a gym trainer.

Many years after Gardella faded from the baseball scene, the United States Supreme Court rejected two challenges to the reserve clause, most notably in the case, brought by outfielder Curt Flood. However, the players won free agency on December 23, 1975 after arbitrator Peter Seitz, ruling in a case brought by pitchers Dave McNally and Andy Messersmith, found that players could leave their teams after playing out their contracts.

Reflecting on his lawsuit and his possible consequences in an interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in 1994, Gardella took pride in having brought his court challenge. &quot;I feel I let the whole world know that the reserve clause was unfair,&quot; he said. &quot;It had the odor of peonage, even slavery.&quot;

Gardella died from congestive heart failure in Yonkers, New York on March 6, 2005, at age 85.

<text>The Honourable Sir Charles Cecil Farquharson Dundas, KCMG, OBE (6 June 1884 – 10 February 1956) was a British colonial administrator who served as Governor of the Bahamas from 1937 to 1940 and Governor of Uganda from 1940 to 1944. He was the fifth son of Charles Saunders Dundas, 6th Viscount Melville.

==Career==

=== Early career ===
He first served as Assistant District Commissioner in the British East Africa Protectorate in Mombasa from 1908. This was followed by a posting to Nairobi, then a secondment with the Indian Army in German East Africa during World War.

=== Tanzania ===
In 1921, Dundas became district commissioner of the Moshi area in Tanzania and Secretary for Native Affairs about 1925. In 1926, he was made a member of the Executive Council of the Tanganyika Territory.

In 1930, he founded the Kilimanjaro Native Cooperative Union. He popularised the area&#x27;s coffee production, and was given the title Wasaoye-o-Wachagga (Elder of the Chagga).

Dundas became very popular and respected during his stay at Moshi. When he left Moshi for the last time by train to Tanga and ship to Dar es Salaam, the Chagga reputedly hired a band to accompany him on board the ship and serenade him on his journey. As the boat sailed into Dar es Salaam harbour, the band apparently struck up &quot;God Save the King&quot;.

=== Bahamas ===
Dundas served as Colonial Secretary of the Bahamas from April 1929 to July 1934.

Later, Dundas was Governor of the Bahamas; appointed in 1937, he was suceeded by the Duke of Windsor in 1940. 

=== Uganda ===
Dundas then served as Governor of Uganda.

== Awards and Honours ==
Dundas was knighted in 1938. In 1942, he was also appointed a knight of the Venerable Order of the Hospital St John of Jerusalem.

The settlement of Dundas Town in Marsh Harbour, Bahamas was named for him.

== Death ==

<text>Dagwood Bumstead is a main character in cartoonist Chic Young&#x27;s long-running comic strip &quot;Blondie&quot;. He debuted in the first strip on September 8, 1930.

He was originally heir to the Bumstead Locomotive fortune, but was disowned when he married Blondie née Boopadoop, a flapper whom his family saw as below his class. He has since worked hard at J. C. Dithers Construction Company as office manager to support his family. The Bumsteads&#x27; first baby, Alexander, was originally named Baby Dumpling. The name of his daughter, Cookie, was chosen by readers in a national contest. The family circle is rounded out by Daisy the dog. The origin of both Dagwood&#x27;s last name and Daisy&#x27;s name came from Chic Young&#x27;s long-time friend Arthur Bumstead and his dog, Daisy.

==Characteristics==
His favorite things in life include his wife Blondie, his kids, naps on the sofa, long baths, and food. Dagwood is famous for concocting tall, multilayered sandwiches topped with an olive on a toothpick, and the term &quot;Dagwood sandwich&quot; has entered American English. Dagwood often made these sandwiches late at night.

Dagwood frequently has problems with door-to-door salesmen, rude telemarketers and store salespeople, crashing into the mailman (Mr. Beasley) as he rushes from home, getting ready before the carpool leaves without him, getting to work on time, his boss J.C. Dithers, and Cookie&#x27;s many dates. He is often suspicious of her dates and keeps a close watch on them when they come to the house. Other characters in his universe include Elmo Tuttle, a pesky little neighborhood kid who wanders in and out of the Bumstead house; next-door neighbors Herb and Tootsie Woodley; Lou, the sarcastic cook in a local diner; and Mr. Dithers&#x27; domineering wife, Cora. Dagwood&#x27;s birthday is July 20, or April 21, or February 15.

==Appearances in other media==
Over the years, Dagwood has appeared not only in daily newspapers, but also in comic books, Big Little Books, Whitman novels for children and other print materials, as well as radio, film, and television. Arthur Lake played Dagwood in the &quot;Blondie&quot; film series (1938–50), radio series and the short-lived 1957 TV series. Hal Le Roy portrayed Dagwood in the pilot for the 1957 series. Will Hutchins played him in the 1968 TV series. He made several cameo appearances in &quot;Garfield Gets Real&quot;, alongside Grimmy from &quot;Mother Goose and Grimm&quot;. Dagwood and his wife also made a cameo appearance in a &quot;Garfield&quot; strip originally published April 1, 1997. In a fourth wall break, Garfield refers to this as &quot;moving to a different comic strip&quot;. Dagwood made another appearance in &quot;Garfield &quot;comic strips on August 20, 2005, to invite Jon and Garfield for Blondie and his anniversary party.

Dagwood also made a cameo appearance in the 1946 cartoon &quot;Hollywood Canine Canteen&quot;, where his wife Blondie and he (named Dogwood in this short) are portrayed as anthropomorphic dogs working in a snack bar. Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake voiced these characters, respectively. 

In the song &quot;Homemade Mummy&quot;, alternative rapper Aesop Rock briefly refers to Dagwood.

<text>Andrew Trần Dũng-Lạc (, ), ; 1795 – 21 December 1839) was a Vietnamese Roman Catholic priest. He was executed by beheading during the reign of Minh Mạng. He is a saint and martyr of the Catholic Church.

==Biography==
He was born Trần An Dũng in Vietnam in 1795. He took the name Andrew at his baptism (Anrê Dũng) and was ordained a priest on 15 March 1823. During persecution, Andrew Dũng changed his name to Lạc to avoid capture, and thus he is memorialised as Andrew Dũng-Lạc (Anrê Dũng Lạc). His memorial is 24 November; this memorial celebrates all of the Vietnamese Martyrs of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries (1625–1886).

<doc id="870914" wikidata="Q4950037" url="?curid=870914" title="Bountiful (Book of Mormon)">
<text>Bountiful is the name of two places described in the Book of Mormon, a religious text dictated in 1829 by Joseph Smith. The first location is set in the Old World near Jerusalem, and the second location is set somewhere in the Americas. While secular and non-LDS scholars consider the Book of Mormon to be a work of fiction, Latter Day Saints view the book as a chronicle of actual indigenous American people. Accordingly, several scholars in The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints have attempted to coordinate the Book of Mormon text relating to Bountiful with actual locations in the Old World and the New World.

The Book of Mormon references have inspired Mormon settlers to give the name &quot;Bountiful&quot; to two towns: Bountiful, Utah and Bountiful, British Columbia.

==Old World==

In the First Book of Nephi in the Book of Mormon, Bountiful is described as a lush land on the coast containing &quot;much fruit and also wild honey&quot; where Lehi and his party settle temporarily before building their ship (). After the ship is completed, Lehi&#x27;s party departs Bountiful and sails to the Americas. (&quot;See Archaeology and the Book of Mormon.&quot;)

===Sea &quot;Irreantum&quot;===
Upon their arrival at the coast, the Book of Mormon states that Lehi&#x27;s group named the sea &quot;Irreantum&quot;, which is said to mean &quot;many waters&quot; (). Anciently, the Arabian Sea was referred to by the Latin name &quot;Mare Erythraeum&quot;. LDS researchers Lynn and Hope Hilton point out the similarity between the words &quot;Irreantum&quot; and &quot;Erythraeum&quot; .

===Speculative real world locations===
Many LDS scholars and researchers believe that the location of Bountiful can be correlated with any of several locations on Oman&#x27;s southern Dhofar coast on the Arabian Peninsula. Locations that have been evaluated are Wadi Hajr (Yemen), Wadi Masilah (Yemen), Dhalqut (Oman), Rakhyut (Oman), Salalah (Oman), Khor Rori/Wadi Darbat (Oman), and Wadi Sayq/Kohr Kharfot (Oman) . In order to match the characteristics outlined in the Book of Mormon, Aston suggests that there are 12 different requirements that a viable candidate for Bountiful must meet :

# The location must lie &quot;nearly eastward&quot; of Nahom ().
# The coast must be accessible from the interior desert.
# Both the general area and the location when the Lehites camped must be fertile and capable of producing crops.
# It must be a coastal location ().
# It must be very fertile, with &quot;much fruit and also wild honey&quot; and small game ().
# Timber must be available with which to build a ship ().
# Freshwater must be available year-round.
# A mountain must be located nearby to account for Nephi&#x27;s reference to going to a mountain to &quot;pray oft&quot; ().
# Cliffs overlooking the ocean must be present to account for Nephi&#x27;s brother&#x27;s attempt to throw him &quot;into the depths of the sea&quot; ().
# Ore and flint must be available with which to make fire and fabricate tools to build a ship&quot; ()
# No resident population at the time of the Lehite&#x27;s arrival.
# Wind and ocean currents capable of carrying a ship out into the ocean ()
After visiting and evaluating every site on the southern Arabian coast that might qualify as Bountiful, Aston concluded that all sites were found to be incapable of meeting every one of these requirements with the exception of Wadi Sayq/Khor Kharfot . Other researchers however disagree with this opinion and favor the location of Khor Rori 40 kilometers to the east of Salalah.

====Wadi Sayq/Khor Kharfot====
Aston concluded that the Wadi Sayq/Khor Kharfot site meets all of the requirements to qualify as Nephi&#x27;s Bountiful . Some LDS researchers believe that the Wadi Sayq (River Valley) and Khor Kharfot (Fort Inlet or Port) site is the most viable candidate, and discount other potential sites as they lack key aspects of the &quot;Bountiful&quot; described by Nephi . Other LDS researchers however disagree with this opinion and discount the Wadi Sayq/Khor Kharfot site for several reasons. Reynolds, in his opinion, describes why he feels Wadi Sayq/Khor Kharfot meets the requirements described by Aston :
# Khor Kharfot is situated less than one degree from due east of Nehem (Nahom).
# The valley of Wadi Sayq leads to the ocean from the desert interior, and is the only wadi that flows from the high desert eastward toward the coast. The coast is accessible by traveling through the bottom of Wadi Sayq.
# Khor Kharfot is the most fertile site on the southern Arabian coast. The region of fertility extends two miles into the Wadi Sayq.
# There is evidence of inhabitation and use as a small seaport during the Islamic period. Water was available through freshwater springs and an ancient river.
# A number of sizable trees exist in the area, with evidence of ancient forests. These trees could have provided sufficient lumber to build a ship .
# Khor Kharfot has the largest permanent flow of fresh water of any site on the coast.
# A large mountain overlooks the west end of the beach.
# Cliffs rise above the ocean in this area.
# Iron in the form of specular hematite is available in the Marbat plain, within a few days&#x27; hike to the east of Khor Kharfot.
# A form of flint is available on the surface in large quantities.
# Ancient ruins show that Khor Kharfot was occupied intermittently, although it is currently uninhabited.
# The coast is well suited to sailing, with seasonal winds in the fall blowing east.

====Salalah====
In Mormon culture, the most popular traditional location of Bountiful is Salalah in modern Oman. LDS scholar Hugh Nibley first proposed this location as Nephi&#x27;s Bountiful in an article published in the Improvement Era in 1950. Nibley&#x27;s conclusion was based upon early writings describing life in Arabia, including an account describing the fertile Salalah area written by English explorer Bertram Thomas .

====Khor Rori/Wadi Darbat====
Khor Rori is an Iron Age ship building and trading port about 40 kilometers east of the modern town of Salalah and in the same Salalah region as some of the other sites; Nephi&#x27;s potential use of the site predates the earliest archaeological finds on this site. In contrast to inaccessible Kohr Kharfot, many LDS researchers are now of the opinion that Khor Rori better meets all of the 12 key points addressed by Aston and others as well as additional aspects they failed to address. These additional points that Kohr Kharfot lack include accessibility for caravan arrival, rich abundance of timber-bearing ancient and modern groves, fresh vegetation extending from Kohr Rori many miles up the Wadi Darbat, large amounts of year-round fresh water teeming with aquatic and wildlife, abundance of wild honey, an inland natural port framed by twin integral seaside cliffs, a readily accessible mountain backdrop for Nephi&#x27;s prayers, annual monsoon season floods that easily transport timber from Wadi Darbat directly to the seaside Kohr Rori port, and a protected harbor in which a ship could be rigged and seamanship could be learned. Another important aspect is that the Old World location and scenery would have had to be impressive enough that later generations of New World Book of Mormon people would recall and honor the location by their reuse of the name &quot;Bountiful&quot;. The competing site Kohr Kharfot remains an uninhabited and inaccessible rock canyon defile with no natural harbor except as a temporary resting spot for passing fisherman and wandering herders due to its relatively undesirable location; in fact the best and almost only access to this Kharfot is by sea. On the other hand, Kohr Rori has been highly desirable over time. Today the site supports the Unesco archaeological site of Sumharam of Frankincense fame. Lehi&#x27;s general route from Jerusalem to the Dhofar area followed many elements of the Frankincense Trail which logically places Kohr Rori as a natural terminus. Extensive archaeological research by many scholars including the 2008 work sponsored by the Omani government have found Iron tools, a temple culture with ritual cleansing and altar worship, ship building remains, and many other aspects congruent with the desirability of Kohr Rori. Today the larger surrounding area continues to agriculturally &quot;blossom as the rose&quot; in the &quot;wilderness.&quot; (Isaiah 35:1-2) While Kohr Kharfot supports the remains of one stone goat corral and shepherd&#x27;s shelter (mistakenly identified by one researcher as the remains of a Nephi-built Temple built after the pattern of Solomon&#x27;s Temple), the bounty of Kohr Rofi is exemplified by hundreds of such structures both ancient and modern. Many LDS researchers have evolved in their thinking and now consider Kohr Rori as the most natural and logical location on the Dhofar Coast for Nephi&#x27;s &quot;Bountiful.&quot;

==New World==

The Book of Mormon refers to a city on the American continent called Bountiful. It has significance in the book as the place where Jesus Christ is said to have visited people in the Book of Mormon civilization after his resurrection. As with most Book of Mormon places, secular scholars consider the New World Bountiful fictional. LDS archeologist John Sorenson believes it to have been in what today is the Mexican state of Tabasco.

An alternate view is that Bountiful was in North America. In what is known as the heartland theory, Nephi and his posterity established themselves in the Iowa area, with their primary city called Zarahemla, believed to be Montrose, Iowa, directly west across the Mississippi River from Nauvoo, Illinois. 

The heartland theory has Nephi&#x27;s family arriving in the Florida panhandle and gradually moving north through the Tennessee and Mississippi River valleys, eventually establishing their civilization in the Ohio area and covering an area from the Mississippi River, east to New York, and south to Florida. The idea of a central American settlement is known as the M2C theory and has begun to fall out of favor amongst Mormon scholars.
Other LDS argue that the New World land and city of Bountiful cannot be very distant from the location of the land Cumorah given in LDS scripture. This interpretation understands the Cumorah in the Book of Mormon to be identical to the Cumorah mentioned in Doctrine and Covenants 128:20.

<doc id="870918" wikidata="Q6406947" url="?curid=870918" title="Kilimanjaro Native Co-operative Union">
<text>Kilimanjaro Native Co-operative Union (KNCU) is a cooperative federation in Tanzania and the oldest cooperative in the country, founded in 1930 by Charles Dundas. KNCU is owned by the farmers of the 90 primary cooperative societies which buy coffee from the farmers on Kilimanjaro. Offices for the cooperative are located in Moshi.

KNCU flourished in the 1950s and 1960s and drove much of the development of the Kilimanjaro Region. In 1977 it was nationalised by the government. This act was reversed in 1984 and KNCU became independent again, although subject to government control of their buying and marketing. Since then, the primary co-operatives and their union have gradually won back their independence. The liberalisation of the coffee industry in the early 1990s saw private companies competing with the cooperatives to buy the coffee of their members. Many cooperatives in Tanzania died. KNCU initially lost 80% of its market and struggled for four years. Since 1998, it has steadily won back market share and is now the largest buyer of Kilimanjaro smallholder coffee. KNCU has also worked closely with the Fair Trade movement and supplies coffee for the Fair Trade Certified Kilimanjaro Roasted Coffee from Cafédirect.

<text>John Gladstone Graney (June 10, 1886 – April 20, 1978) was a Canadian professional baseball left fielder. He played in Major League Baseball for 14 seasons, all with the Cleveland Indians franchise. In his 1402-game career, Graney batted .250 (1178-for-4705) with 706 runs, 18 home runs and 420 RBI.

Following his playing days, Graney became a baseball radio broadcaster, providing play-by-play for the Indians from 1932 to 1953. He was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Distinguished Hall of Fame for non-uniformed personnel on August 11, 2012, prior to a game at Progressive Field. He is the recipient of the 2022 Ford C. Frick Award.

==Playing career==

Graney began his professional baseball career as a pitcher, and remained one through the 1909 season. He pitched in two games for the Cleveland team (then known as the Naps) in 1908, and spent the rest of 1908 and 1909 with the Portland Beavers. When he was brought back up to the Naps&#x27; roster in 1910, they converted him to an outfielder, as team management did not trust his control at the major league level.

Graney was the first batter to face Babe Ruth in a major league game, on July 11, 1914. He led the American League with 41 doubles in 1916, scoring a career-high 106 runs, and led the league in walks in both 1917 and 1919.

On August 17, 1920, Indians shortstop Ray Chapman, Graney&#x27;s roommate and best friend, died after having been struck in the head by a Carl Mays pitch in a game against the New York Yankees the day before. Graney was devastated, and suffered a breakdown upon viewing Chapman&#x27;s body, having to be forcibly removed from the hospital room. Two days later during the casket viewing, Graney fainted. He was too distraught to attend the funeral and never forgave Mays for what he believed was an intentional beaning. The Indians went on to win the pennant and 1920 World Series against Brooklyn, with Graney going hitless in his only three postseason at-bats.

==Broadcasting ==
After retiring from playing, Graney became a play-by-play broadcaster for the Indians, thereby becoming the first former Major League Baseball player to become a radio broadcaster in the United States. From 1947 to 1953, Graney’s partner in the radio booth was fellow Ford C. Frick Award recipient Jimmy Dudley. Nationally, Graney broadcast the 1935 World Series for CBS radio. He also called games for the Cleveland Barons of the American Hockey League.

Graney died at age 91 in Louisiana, Missouri, on April 20, 1978.

==Legacy==
Graney was inducted into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1984, its second year of operation. In 1987 the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame instituted an award in Graney&#x27;s name, presented periodically to journalists deemed to have made notable contributions to promoting baseball within Canada.

In the 2022 Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, he won the Ford C. Frick Award.

The Greater Cleveland chapter of the Society for American Baseball Research is named in honor of Graney.

<text>Francis A. Marzen (March 14, 1925 – July 19, 2004) was a priest of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu, former editor of the &quot;Hawaii Catholic Herald&quot; and an information specialist for the City &amp; County of Honolulu in the administration of Mayor Frank Fasi.

Born in East Mauch Chunk — present-day Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania — Marzen studied at the Pontifical College Josephinum in Worthington, Ohio and was ordained in the fledgling diocese in the Hawaiian Islands in 1951 alongside his classmate, Bernard J. Eikmeier. Marzen was the founding pastor of Our Lady of Good Counsel Church and School in Pearl City as well as Saints Peter and Paul Church in the Kapi`olani Business District of Honolulu.

Marzen was appointed a Chaplain of His Holiness with the title of Monsignor by Pope John XXIII in 1963. His classmate Eikmeier joined him in the ranks of the &quot;monsignori&quot; many years later during the episcopate of Joseph Anthony Ferrario.

After thirty years with the &quot;Hawaii Catholic Herald&quot;, twenty of which were spent as editor, Marzen was dismissed from his position by the newly appointed Bishop Ferrario. In 1986, Marzen retired from his position as pastor of Saints Peter and Paul Church. He was subsequently hired in 1987 by Mayor Frank Fasi as an information specialist.

<doc id="870928" wikidata="Q125144191" url="?curid=870928" title="Korean Martyrs">
<text>The Korean Martyrs were the victims of religious persecution against Catholics during the 19th century in Korea. Among them are 103 Saints and 124 Blesseds officially recognized by the Catholic Church.

==Overview==
There were 5 main sets of persecutions against Christians in nineteenth-century Korea; 
*Catholic Persecution of 1801
*
*Catholic Persecution of 1866

Between 8,000–10,000 Korean Christians were killed during this period. In May 1984, 103 Catholics were canonised &quot;en masse&quot;, including the first Korean Catholic priest, Andrew Kim Taegon, who was executed by sword in 1846.

In 2014, Paul Yun Ji-Chung and 123 companions were declared &quot;Venerable&quot; on 7 February 2014 and on 16 August 2014. They were beatified by Pope Francis during the Asian Youth Day in Gwanghwamun Plaza in Seoul. They further moved to beatify Catholics who were killed by North Korean communists during the Korean War.

==Background==
At the end of the eighteenth century, Korea was ruled by the Joseon Dynasty. It was a society based on Confucianism and its hierarchical, class relationships. There was a small minority of privileged scholars and nobility while the majority were commoners paying taxes, providing labor, and manning the military, all above a slave class.

When scholars first introduced Christianity to Korea, ordinary people flocked to the new religion. The new believers called themselves &quot;Chonju Kyo Udul&quot;, literally &quot;Friends of the Teaching of God of Heaven&quot;. The term &quot;friends&quot; was the only term in the Confucian understanding of relationships which implied equality.

==History==
During the early seventeenth century, Christian literature written in Chinese was imported from China to Korea. The Catholic ideas espoused in them were debated and denounced as heterodoxy as early as 1724. In 1777, Christian literature obtained from Jesuits in China led educated Korean Christians to study the faith. At this point some Koreans started to be converted to Catholicism.

When a Chinese priest managed to secretly enter the country a dozen years later, he found 4,000 Catholics, none of whom had ever seen a priest. The Catholic communities were led almost entirely by educated laypeople from the aristocracy, as they were the only ones who could read the books that were written in Hanja.

The community sent a delegation on foot to Beijing, 750 miles away, to ask the city&#x27;s bishop for their own bishops and priests. Eventually, two Chinese priests were sent, but their ministry was short-lived, and another forty years passed before the Paris Foreign Mission Society began its work in Korea with the arrival of Father Maubant in 1836. Paul Chong Hasang, Augustine Yu Chin-gil and Charles Cho Shin-chol had made several visits to Beijing in order to find ways of introducing missionaries into Korea.

Since the Sinhae persecution of 1791-1801, there had been no priest to care for the Catholic community. Serious dangers awaited the missionaries who dared to enter Korea. The bishops and priests who confronted this danger, as well as the laypeople who aided and sheltered them, were in constant threat of losing their lives.
Bishop Laurent Imbert and ten other French missionaries were the first Paris Foreign Missions Society priests to enter Korea. During the daytime, they stayed in hiding, but at night they traveled about on foot attending to the spiritual needs of the faithful and administering the sacraments. The first Korean Catholic priest, Andrew Kim Taegŏn, who was trained in Macau, succeeded in entering Korea as a missionary. However, thirteen months after his ordination he was put to death by the sword in 1846 at the age of 26. He is now recognised as the patron saint of Korean clergy.

The idea of Catholics gathering in one place with no distinction on the basis of class were perceived to undermine &quot;hierarchical Confucianism&quot;, the ideology which held the state together. The new learning was seen to be subversive of the establishment and this gave rise to systematic suppression and persecution. Official documents detail trials and the sentences. There were four major persecutions; the last one was in 1866, at which time there were only 20,000 Catholics in Korea (other Christian denominations did not enter Korea until sometime later). The vast majority of the martyrs were laypeople.

== Recognition ==
More than 10,000 martyrs died in persecutions which extended over more than one hundred years. Of all these martyrs, seventy-nine were beatified in 1925. Twenty-four others were beatified on 6 October 1968. They had died in the persecutions of 1839 (Ki-hae persecution), 1846 (Pyong-o persecution) and 1866 (Pyong-in persecution). All together, 103 martyrs were canonized by Pope John Paul II on 6 May 1984. In breaking tradition, the ceremony did not take place in Rome but Seoul. Their feast day is September 20.

Andrew Kim Taegŏn wrote to his parish as he awaited his execution with a group of twenty persons:
In the early 1870s, Father Claude-Charles Dallet compiled a comprehensive history of the Catholic Church in Korea, largely from the manuscripts of martyred Bishop Antoine Daveluy. The Korean Martyrs were known for their staunchness, sincerity, and number of their converts. An English lawyer and sinologist Edward Harper Parker observed that:

Coreans [&quot;sic&quot;], unlike Chinese and Japanese, make the most staunch and devoted converts… The Annamese [Vietnamese] make better converts than either Chinese or Japanese, whose tricky character, however, they share; but they are gentler and more sympathetic; they do not possess the staunch masculinity of the Coreans.

According to Ernst Oppert,
An observation, founded upon many years&#x27; experience, may not be out of place here, and that is, that among all Asiatic nationalities there is probably none more inclined to be converted to Christianity than the Corean [&quot;sic&quot;]… He becomes a Christian from conviction, not from any mercenary motives.

Bishop and martyr Simeon François Berneux wrote,
The Corean [&quot;sic&quot;] possesses the most perfect dispositions for receiving the faith. Once convinced, he accepts and attaches himself to it, in spite of all sacrifices it may cost him.

The priest Francis Goldie stated,
Certainly few countries, if any, have to tell of such a painful apostolate, or of one which has had such success. Japan alone in later days can boast a martyrology at all to compare with that of Corea [&quot;sic&quot;] in the number of the slain, or in the heroism of those who died for Christ.

==Individual martyrs==

The Christian community first began to take shape when Yi Seung-hun started to study Christian doctrine by himself and was eventually baptized and given the name Peter in 1784. Because of their belief in the Christian God, the first Korean Christians were persecuted repeatedly, rejected by their families, and suffered a loss of their social rank. Despite persecutions, the faith continued to spread.

The Christian community in Korea was given the assistance of two Chinese priests, but their ministry was short-lived, and another forty years passed before the Paris Foreign Missions Society began its work in Korea with the arrival of Father Mauban in 1836. A delegation was selected and sent to Beijing on foot, 750 miles, in order to ask the Bishop of Beijing to send them bishops and priests.

The same appeal was made to the Pope in Rome. Serious dangers awaited the missionaries who dared to enter Korea. The bishops and priests who confronted this danger, as well as the lay Christians who aided and sheltered them, were in constant threat of losing their lives.

Until the granting of religious liberty in Korea in 1886, there were many &quot;disciples who shed their blood, in imitation of Christ Our Lord, and who willingly submitted to death, for the salvation of the world&quot; (&quot;Lumen Gentium&quot;, 42). Among those who died, and were later named as martyrs, were eleven priests and ninety-two lay people who would be canonized as saints.

Bishop Laurent Imbert and ten other French missionaries were the first Paris Foreign Mission Society priests to enter Korea and to embrace a different culture for the love of God. During the daytime, they stayed in hiding, but at night they travelled about on foot attending to the spiritual needs of the faithful and administering the sacraments.

===Andrew Kim Taegon, Paul Chong Hasang, and 101 Companions===

The first Korean priest, Andrew Kim Taegon, found a way to make the difficult task of entering Korea as a missionary from Macau. Thirteen months after his ordination he was put to death by the sword when he was 25 years old.

Paul Chong Hasang, Augustine Yu Chin-gil and Charles Cho Shin-chol had made several visits to Beijing in order to find new ways of introducing missionaries into Korea and a bishop and ten priests from the Paris Foreign Missions Society arrived in the country for the first time since 1801.

Among the martyrs honored were fifteen women, including the two sisters, Agnes Kim Hyo-ju and Columba Kim Hyo-im. These women, in an era when Christian religious life was still unknown in Korea, lived in community and cared for the sick and the poor. John Yi Kwang-hyol died a martyr&#x27;s death after having lived a life of celibacy in consecrated service to the Church.

Some of the other martyrs who were canonized that day included: 
*Damien Nam Myong-hyok and Maria Yi Yon-hui 
*John Nam Chong-sam, though of high social rank, was a model of justice, chastity and poverty; 
*John Pak Hu-jae who, after he lost his parents in the persecutions, learned to survive by making straw sandals; 
*Peter Kwon Tug-in who devoted himself to meditation; 
*Anna Pak Agi who, although she did not have a deep grasp of Christian doctrine, was wholly devoted to Jesus and Mary;
*Peter Yu Tae-chol who confessed his faith and died a martyr at the age of 13 years old.

===Paul Yun Jichung and 123 Companions===

The 124 martyrs were beatified on August 16, 2014 in Seoul by Pope Francis during his visit to Korea.

Biography of major martyrs:
Yun Ji-chung Paul (1759-1791). The first Chosun martyr killed for his Catholic faith, was born in 1759 to a noble family in Jinsan, Jeolla-do. Yun Ji-heon Francis, who was martyred during the Shinyu Persecution of 1801, was his younger brother.

In 1783, Yun passed the first state examination and learned about Catholicism for the first time through his cousin Jung Yak Yong John. After being baptized in 1787, he preached the Catholic doctrine to his mother, younger brother, and cousin Kwon Sang Yeon James. He also kept in touch with Yoo Hang Geom Augustine to keep up mission work.

In 1791, Bishop Gouvea of Beijing ordered a ban on traditional ancestral rites within his diocese. Yun Ji Chung and Kwon Sang Yeon, in accordance with the Church&#x27;s commands, set their families ancestral tablets on fire. Chung&#x27;s mother died the following year. She requested to receive a Catholic funeral which her son duly provided for her. These actions angered the royal family.

News of Yun&#x27;s actions led to dispute in the royal court. In the end, Jeongjo backed the Noron faction push to oppress Catholicism and ordered the arrest of Yun and Kwon. The governor of Jinsan went to Yun&#x27;s house and discovered the absence of the family&#x27;s ancestral plates. At the time the pair were in hiding. Upon hearing that Yuns&#x27;s uncle had been taken into custody they handed themselves into the authorities.

In the face of calls to renounce their Catholic faith the pair refused. The governor judged that getting them to abandon their religion was beyond him. They were sent to a government building in Jeonju. The pair continued to refuse apostasy despite interrogation and torture. An official report on the situation was delivered to the royal court. Opinion within the court was in favour of the death penalty. Jeongjo supported this view and ordered their execution. On the 8th of the December 1791 Yun and Kwon were beheaded.

This episode is referred to as the &#x27;Jinsan incident&#x27;. 
Fr. Jacob Zhou Wenmo (1752-1801): The first missionary priest to be dispatched to Chosun. Born in Suzhou, China in 1752, he lost his parents early in life and were raised by his grandmother. He became a priest as one of the first graduates at Beijing Archdiocese seminary. At that time, Bishop Gouvea in Beijing was planning to send a clergy to Chosun. He chose Father Ju, who had a strong faith and looked similar to Chosun people. After leaving Beijing in February 1794, Father Ju waited at Yodong area until the Amnokgang River froze enough to cross across. On the appointed date, he went to a town located on the border between China and Chosun to meet secret envoys sent from Chosun and entered Chosun on the night of December 24. Since then, Father Ju stayed at the house of a faithful Christian so that he could learn Hangul, the Korean alphabets. On Easter of 1795, he held a mass with the faithful for the first time. However, after his entry was revealed, he escaped to female President Kang Wan Sook (Colomba)&#x27;s house and continued to pray in many areas in secrecy. The number of the faithful increased to 10,000 after six years but as the Catholic Persecution of 1801 occurred and the faithful were forced to confess the location of Father Ju, he decided to surrender on March 11 of that year. On May 31, Father Ju was decapitated at Saenamteo area near Han River at the age of 49.
Yun Yoo Il Paul (1760-1795): A secret envoy from Beijing who helped missionary to enter Chosun. He was born in Yeoju, Kyungki-do in 1760. After moving to Yanggeun, he encountered Catholicism while studying under Kwon Chul Shin. He learned Catholic doctrine from Kwon Il Shin, the younger brother of Kwon Chul Shin, and became a Catholic. He then preached the doctrine to his family. In 1789, Yun Yoo Il was selected as a secret envoy by the church leaders to report the situation of Chosun church to Bishop Gouvea. He went to Beijing twice, in 1789 and in 1790. In 1791, Bishop Gouvea&#x27;s plan to dispatch a priest failed and persecution took place in Chosun. Nonetheless, Yun Yoo Il continued to endeavor to dispatch a priest. In 1794, he finally succeeded in bringing Father Ju Mun Mo to Chosun. In 1795, he was arrested along with Ji Hwang (Sabas), Choi In Gil (Mathew). They were tortured to tell the location of Father Ju, but their strong endurance and wise response rather confused the persecutors. As a result, the three of them were beaten to death on June 28 of that year, when Yun Yoo Il was 35, Ji Hwang 28, and Choi In Gil 30.
Jeong Yak Jong Augustinus (1760-1801): The first Catholic lay theologian in Korea. In 1760, he was born into a family of scholars in Majae (current Neungnae-ri Joan-myeon, Namyangju-si Gyeonggi-go). He is the father of Jeong Chul Sang (Charles) (?-1801) who was beatified together with the 123 Blessed and St. Jeong Ha Sang Paul (martyred in 1839), who was declared saint in 1984. After learning Catholic doctrine from his older brother Jeong Yak Jeon in 1786, he moved to Yanggeon Bunwon (current Bunwon-ri, Namjeong-myeon, Gwangju-gun, Gyeonggi-go) to preached Catholic doctrine to his neighbors while participating in church activities. After Father Ju Mun Mo came in 1794, Jeong Yak Jong often visited Han Yang to help church work. He also wrote two easy Hangul textbooks called &#x27;Jugyo-yoji&#x27; a Catechism in the Korean language and distributed them to Christians with Father Ju&#x27;s approval. Later he became the first president of a layperson association called &#x27;Myeongdo-hoe&#x27; which was organized by Father Ju. When persecution began in his hometown in 1800, Jeong Yak Jong and his family moved to Han Yang. However, the 1801Catholic Persecution began and Jeong Yak Jong was arrested. As he tried to preach doctrine to persecutors, he was decapitated at Seosomun, 15 days after he was arrested, on 8 April 1801. When he was martyred, he said &quot;I&#x27;d rather die looking up at the sky than to die looking down at the ground&quot; and was decapitated while looking up at the sky.
Kang Wan Sook Columba (1761-1801): Female leader of Chosun Catholics. In 1761, she was born to a concubine of a noble family in Naepo area in ChungCheong-do. She learned about Catholicism soon after she was married and followed Christianity by reading Catholic books. During the persecution in 1791, she was imprisoned while taking care of the imprisoned faithful. Kang Wan Sook guided her mother-in-law and her son from previous marriage (Hong Pil Joo Phillips, martyred in 1801) to become Catholics, but could not persuade her husband. Later, when her husband got a concubine, Kang Wan Sook and her husband lived separately. After hearing that the faithful in Han Yang are well-informed with Catholic doctrine, she moved to Han Yang with her mother-in-law and her son. She provided financial support to Christians who were working on recruiting a clergy and she was baptized by Father Ju Mun Mo. Father Ju appointed her as a female President to take care of the faithful. When a persecution in 1795 took place, she took advantage of the fact that persecutors cannot search a house owned by a woman and let Father Ju to take refuge in her house. Her house was also used for the faithful&#x27;s assembly. On April 6, 1801, she helped Father Ju to escape while being arrested. Although persecutors tried to trace Father Ju&#x27;s whereabouts through her, she refused to confess. On 2 July, she was decapitated outside Seosomun at age 40.
Yu Hang-geom Augustine (1756-1801). The priest of Ho Nam. He was born in 1756 in Chonam, Jeonju and became a Catholic soon after Catholicism was introduced to Korea in 1784. His sons Yu Jung-cheol John, Yu Mun-seok John, daughter-in-law Yi Sun-i Lutgarda and his nephew Yu Jung-seong Matthew were beatified along with Yu Hang-geom Augustine. He showed compassion and gave alms to poor neighbors as well as to his servants. Augustine Yu was appointed as pastor of Jeolla-do region in the spring of 1786, when the leaders of the Catholics held a meeting and appointed clergy at their own discretion. Afterwards, he returned to his hometown and celebrated Mass and administered the Sacraments to the faithful. However, after a while, the leaders of the Catholics understood that such an act was a sacrilege. As soon as this was brought to his attention, he stopped immediately. When the Persecution of 1801 broke out, Augustine Yu, who was recognized as the head of the Church in the Jeolla-do region, was first to be arrested. He was taken to Seoul (Hanyang) where he underwent interrogation and torture at the Police Headquarters. However, since he was already determined to die a martyr, he neither betrayed the other believers nor said anything that would harm the Church. The persecutors, despite all their efforts, could not get any of the information they were looking for. Instead, they charged him with the crime of treason and ordered that he be executed. He was transferred back to Jeonju, where he was hacked to pieces outside the South Gate of Jeonju.
Hwang Il-gwang Simon (1757-1802). Hwang Il-gwang Simon was born in Hongju, Chungcheong-do to a low-class family. Around 1792, he moved to Hongsan, where he went to see Yi Jon-chang Louis Gonzaga to learn about the Catholic teaching. After he understood the faith, he left his hometown and moved to Gyeongsang-do to have more freedom to practice his religious life. He stated, &quot;Here, everybody treats me as a human being despite my low-class status. Now, I believe that Heaven exists here and hereafter.&quot; In 1800 Simon Hwang moved to the neighboring house of Chŏng Yakjong Augustine and when Augustine Chŏng moved to Seoul (Hanyang), he also moved to Seoul (Hanyang) with his younger brother and made his living by selling firewood. In 1801, he was arrested while he was on his way to the mountain to get firewood. After stating that the Catholic religion is a &#x27;holy religion&#x27;, he was beaten to the point that one of his legs was broken. He was then transferred to his hometown Hong ju and was beheaded on 30 January 1802. 
Yi Sun-I Lutgarda (1782-1802) and her husband, Yu Jung-cheol John. A couple who kept their virginity through faith. Yi Sun-I Lutgarda was born in 1782 to a well-known noble family. Her brothers Yi Gyeong-do Charles (martyred in 1801) and Yi Gyeong-eon Paul (martyred in 1827), and her husband Yu Jung-cheol John (martyred in 1801) were beatified with her. Yi Yun-ha. Her father Matthew and great-grandfather Yi Ik were renowned scholars. Matthew Yi became a Catholic in 1784, soon after Catholicism was introduced to Korea, when he met Kwon Chol-sin, and Kwon Il-sin. Lutgarda Yi received her First Holy Communion from Father Zhou Wen-mo James and made a vow of chastity. However, in the society of that time, it was extremely difficult for a young woman to remain single. Her mother consulted Father James Zhou who remembered that Yu Jung-cheol John also wanted to live a life of celibacy. He sent a messenger and arranged their marriage. In 1798, Lutgarda Yi went to her husband&#x27;s hometown, Chonam in Jeonju and made a vow to live a celibate life. During Shinyu Persecution in 1801, Yu Hang-gom Augustine, her father-in-law, was first arrested. She was arrested later and was taken to Jeonju. She was condemned to exile and left for Hamgyeong-do. However soon the police followed them and arrested them again. On 31 January 1802, she was taken to the execution ground in Jeonju, called &#x27;Supjeongi&#x27; and was beheaded. The letter she wrote while she was imprisoned in Jeonju still remains and testifies for the values of Catholics of the time.
Kim Jin-hu Pius (1739-1814). The ancestor of the St. Kim Taegon Andrew. Kim Jin-hu Pius was born in Solmoe, Chungcheong-do. He was the great-grandfather of St. Kim Taegon Andrew and the father of Kim Jong-han Andrew, who was martyred in 1816 and was beatified with the 123 Blessed. Pius Kim encountered Catholicism when his eldest son learned the catechism from Yi Jon-chang Gonzaga and taught it to his brothers. As his sons continued to tell him about God, he gradually drew towards Jesus Christ and left his government position to focus on fulfilling religious duties. When Pius Kim was arrested during the Sinhae persecution in 1791, he professed his faith in God. He was arrested four to five more times but was released each time. He was also arrested during the Shinyu Persecution in 1801, but was exiled and set free. Pius Kim was arrested again in 1805 and was taken to Haemi. He continued to profess his faith in God without hesitation and was held in prison for a long time without being sentenced to death. In prison, the officials and prison guards respected him for his dignity and conduct. He spent 10 years in prison and died there on 1 December 1814 at the age of 75. 
Yi Seong-rye (1801-1840): A mother who inherited faith to her children. She was born in 1801 in Hongju, Chungcheong-do to the family of Louis Gonzaga Yi Jon-chang. At the age of 17, she married St. Francis Choe Kyeong-hwan and lived in Darakgol, Hongju. In 1821 she gave birth to their first son, Thomas Choe Yang-up. Due to the danger of persecution the family had to move frequently but Yi Seong-rye told Bible stories to her children and taught them to endure difficulties. After settling down in Surisan (currently Gunpo-city, Gyeonggi-do) she helped her husband to set up a Christian village. Meanwhile, her son Thomas Choe Yang-up was chosen to be a seminary candidate and was sent to Macau to study theology. In 1839, during the Gihae persecution her husband went back and forth to Hanyang (now Seoul) to take care of the bodies of the Martyrs, she supported her husband and finally was arrested by the police with her whole family in Surisan. At that time, her new-born baby was nearly starved to death due to lack of milk. She could no longer abandon her baby so she yielded to defy her faith and was released from prison. When her eldest son left to study at a Chinese seminary, she was imprisoned once again. When she was sentenced to death, she was sent to Danggogae (now Wonhyoro 2-ga, Yongsan-gu, Seoul) to be beheaded at the age of 39. Her son Thomas Choe Yang-eop went on to become the second ordained Catholic priest in Korean history.

==Legacy==
Pope John Paul II, speaking at the canonization, said, &quot;The Korean Church is unique because it was founded entirely by lay people. This fledgling Church, so young and yet so strong in faith, withstood wave after wave of fierce persecution. Thus, in less than a century, it could boast of 10,000 martyrs. The death of these martyrs became the leaven of the Church and led to today&#x27;s splendid flowering of the Church in Korea. Even today their undying spirit sustains the Christians in the Church of silence in the north of this tragically divided land&quot;.

==Beatification==
After the canonization of the 103 Martyrs, the Catholic Church in Korea felt that the martyrs who died in the other persecutions also need to be recognized. In 2003, the beatification process for 124 martyrs who died in persecutions between 1791 and 1888 began. In 2004 the Archdiocese of Seoul opened its investigation into the cause for beatification of the Servant of God Paul Yun Ji-Chung and his 123 companions who in 1791 were tortured and killed in odium fidei, in hatred of the faith.
This group was declared Venerable by Pope Francis on 7 February 2014.

Among the martyrs in this group are;

*Fr. James Zhou Wen-mo (1752-1801), a Chinese priest who secretly ministered to the Christians in Korea;
*Augustine Chŏng Yakjong (1760-1801), the husband of St. Cecilia Yu So-sa and father of Sts. Paul Chong Ha-sang and Elizabeth Chong Chong-hye;
*Columba Kang Wan-suk (1761-1801), known as the &quot;catechist of the Korean Martyrs&quot;;
*Maria Yi Seong-rye (1801-1840) the wife of St. Francis Choe Kyeong-hwan.
*Barbara Sim-gi, an 18 year old virgin and martyr
*Augustine Yu Hang-geom (1756-1801), also known as the &quot;apostle of Jeolla-do&quot;;
*Augustine Yu Hang-geom&#x27;s son John Yu Jeong-cheol (1779-1801) and his wife Lutgarda Yi Sun-i (1782-1802). They both decided to live celibate lives in order to fully dedicate themselves to God, but the Confucian society, which greatly valued furthering the family line, made it impossible for them to live as celibates. Fr. James Zhou introduced the two to each other and suggested them to marry each other and live as a &quot;virgin couple&quot;. The two were married in 1797 and were martyred 4 years later.

==Korean Martyrs Museum-Shrine==

The Museum-Shrine, which contains rooms for liturgical celebration and prayer, was built in 1967 on the site in Jeoldu-san, where many of the Korean martyrs died from 1866 to 1873. The Shrine-Museum presents numerous historical documents, visual reconstructions, photographs and documentaries.

<text>London Canal Museum in the King&#x27;s Cross area of London, England, is a regional museum devoted to the history of London&#x27;s canals.
The museum opened in 1992.

==Exhibitions and activities==
The museum covers all aspects of the UK&#x27;s waterways. The main exhibitions in the museum cover the following topics:
* History of the London canals, the Regents Canal in particular 
* Water and Locks - canal engineering
* Boats and Cargoes
* Methods of traction by horses, internal combustion engines, and miniature tractors
* Carlo Gatti and the ice trade
* Social history of canal workers
* Lifting and handling
* The decorative arts of the canals known as &quot;roses and castles&quot;

The museum also hosts temporary exhibitions on canal related subjects.

The museum runs guided trips on its 12-seater trip boat &quot;Long Tom&quot;. These trips include 50 minute return trips through the Islington Tunnel and longer return trips to Little Venice and Victoria Park.

==History of the building==

The museum is housed in a Victorian former ice warehouse that was used by Carlo Gatti. The building was constructed between 1862 and 1863 to house ice imported from Norway by ship and canal barge. The building was extensively rebuilt 1904 to 1906 when the existing ground and 1st floors and ramp were constructed and stables installed. The use of the ice wells to store ice finished prior to the First World War and Gatti&#x27;s ceased to use the
building as a transport depot around 1926. It was then used by various engineering firms before its conversion to a food importer&#x27;s warehouse in 1956, when the stable fittings were stripped out and the lightwell was infilled with a staircase and toilets. The ice wells were filled with garden soil and miscellaneous debris around that time, according to the archaeological evidence of the fill materials, and were sealed up and forgotten until their accidental rediscovery in the 1980s.

Of the two partly excavated ice wells under the building, one may be viewed from the public area of the museum and the other using CCTV that can be viewed on the Museum web site.

==Location==
The museum is situated in the King&#x27;s Cross area of London, on the Regent&#x27;s Canal. Battlebridge Basin is accessible from the rear of the museum. It is a five-minute walk to King&#x27;s Cross St Pancras tube station.

<text>The Washington Journal is an American television series on the C-SPAN television network in the format of a political call-in and interview program. The program features elected officials, government administrators, and journalists as guests, answering questions from the hosts and from members of the general public who call into the studio or submit questions via e-mail and social media.

The three-hour program airs every day of the year, beginning at 7 a.m. Eastern Time, except when special events or coverage of Congress preempt all or part of the program. The audio of the program also airs on WCSP-FM as a simulcast with the television broadcast.

==Background and production==
===History===
The &quot;Washington Journal&quot;″s antecedent is the C-SPAN daily call-in, a fixture of the network since October 7, 1980. The inaugural the &quot;Washington Journal&quot; program aired on January 4, 1995, and the program continues to be shown on C-SPAN in its original time slot. Saturday and Sunday editions were originally just two hours long; on January 20, 2001, they were expanded to a full three hours.

Simulcasts of the &quot;Washington Journal&quot; on C-SPAN&#x27;s radio station, WCSP-FM, began on October 9, 1997; it was the first program to be broadcast on the station. One hour of the Sunday edition of &quot;Washington Journal&quot; is also simulcast on BBC Parliament in the United Kingdom, preceded by &quot;America This Week&quot;, an hour of recorded C-SPAN programming.

===Format===
At the beginning of each program, the host reads noteworthy articles and editorials from current newspapers and periodicals as viewers discuss a timely topic chosen by C-SPAN. The program occasionally features &quot;open phones&quot; segments when callers may discuss any topic of their choosing. In multiple segments following, the host interviews guests invited to discuss a specific political or legislative issue and takes calls from the public. Most guests appear in C-SPAN&#x27;s Washington or New York City studios, while some guests are interviewed from remote locations.

The program is noted for the participation of its viewers, who may call in, submit questions and comments via e-mail, or, since March 5, 2009, Twitter. As facilitators of conversation between the public and C-SPAN guests, &quot;Washington Journal&quot; hosts do not offer their own perspective on issues and leave more pointed questions to callers, though they will occasionally ask for clarifications from callers and guests. Consistent with its emphasis on reflecting a wide variety of viewpoints, C-SPAN aims to take approximately 60 calls in each program, and roughly 20,000 calls per year.

In the early days of the &quot;Washington Journal&quot;, callers were not screened by ideology. This was changed at the recommendation of University of Maryland professor John Splaine, hired by C-SPAN to ensure the network&#x27;s objectivity, who noticed that C-SPAN received a disproportionate number of calls from conservative viewers. &quot;Washington Journal&quot; producers now set up separate phone lines by party affiliation (Democrats, Republicans, and Independents) and take alternate calls from each line. In some cases, a dedicated call-in line is made available for the international audience (outside the U.S. and Canada) or for a particular group of callers. For example, a program about college tuition may have a line for students and recent graduates. In the fall of 2006, the &quot;Washington Journal&quot; recorded two shows in New Orleans and set up a call-in line for locals to tell their stories from Hurricane Katrina and its aftermath.

===Production===
The show is hosted from C-SPAN&#x27;s Washington, D.C., studio overlooking the Capitol Building and is hosted by a revolving set of hosts. In November 2009, C-SPAN named veteran television news producer Michele Remillard as executive producer of the &quot;Washington Journal&quot;.

The &quot;Washington Journal&quot; theme music is the third movement of Concerto for Trumpet, Mo. 2 by Johann Melchior Molter (1696-1765), played at various points during each broadcast. The theme is used as introductory music, as an interlude during transitions, and is played again as the program concludes.

A video simulcast of the C-SPAN Radio studio has been shown during transitions at the top of an hour, with the radio host reading the day&#x27;s news headlines. The program airs 365 days a year. The &quot;Washington Journal&quot;, until 2016, had no time-delay, which often resulted in callers uttering profane and offensive language over the air. In 2016, &quot;Washington Journal&quot; implemented a 3-second delay to combat these callers. In 2018, following an incident in which a caller made racist remarks about then-President Barack Obama, the delay was increased to seven seconds.

Callers are asked to wait 30 days between phoning in, though this rule is pointed out to be violated by the program&#x27;s regular viewers occasionally.

==Notable guests and events==
For several days following the September 11 attacks, the &quot;Washington Journal&quot; began at 6 a.m. instead of 7 a.m. Following Hurricane Katrina, the &quot;Washington Journal&quot; frequently featured discussions on the issue of New Orleans&#x27; recovery. On August 21 and 22, 2006, a remote broadcast was set up in the city to interview key players, including U.S. senators David Vitter and Mary Landrieu, and local homeowners.

Among C-SPAN&#x27;s primarily anonymous callers, recording artist and entertainer Cher made waves by calling into the show on October 27, 2003. Although she intended to call anonymously, host Peter Slen correctly guessed her identity, which she reluctantly admitted. She called again on May 28, 2006, and waited on hold for her call to be taken. She then subsequently appeared on the program on June 14, 2006, to speak about Operation Helmet, a nonprofit organization providing helmet upgrades for U.S. soldiers.

<doc id="870936" wikidata="Q1248320" url="?curid=870936" title="Coach (TV series)">
<text>Coach is an American television sitcom that originally ran for nine seasons on ABC from February 28, 1989, to May 14, 1997, with a total of 200 half-hour episodes. The series, created by Barry Kemp, stars Craig T. Nelson as Hayden Fox, head coach of the fictional NCAA Division I-A Minnesota State University Screaming Eagles football team. For the last two seasons, Coach Fox and the supporting characters coached the Orlando Breakers, a fictional National Football League expansion team. The program also starred Jerry Van Dyke as Luther Van Dam and Bill Fagerbakke as Michael &quot;Dauber&quot; Dybinski, assistant coaches under Fox. The role of Hayden&#x27;s girlfriend (and later wife) Christine Armstrong, a television news anchor, was played by Shelley Fabares.

==Plot==
In early seasons, Coach Fox continues to come to grips with the emerging womanhood of his &quot;little girl&quot;, Kelly, now a college student played by Clare Carey, who after being raised mostly by her mother, enrolled at Minnesota State mainly because she wanted to be near her father. Kelly dated (and eventually married in the second season) theater mime Stuart Rosebrock (Kris Kamm), whom Hayden could not stand. Their marriage ended in 1991 after Stuart, returning from filming his own kids TV show, &quot;Buzzy the Beaver&quot;, told Kelly that he had met another woman. While overtly supporting Kelly with her heartbreak, Coach Fox clandestinely could not have been happier to have &quot;Stu&quot; out of both of their lives. After graduating from Minnesota State in 1993, Kelly was hired by a major ad agency in New York. She was only seen in occasional guest spots thereafter (and not at all after season 7).

Much of Hayden&#x27;s coaching job, besides mentoring his players, was working with his defensive coordinator and assistant head coach Luther Van Dam (Jerry Van Dyke), a lifelong bachelor who often struggled with self-confidence and is Hayden&#x27;s best friend, and special teams coach Michael &quot;Dauber&quot; Dybinski (Bill Fagerbakke), an ex-player at Minnesota State and a kind-hearted, naive &quot;dumb jock&quot; whose ongoing joke was that he had not yet graduated from Minnesota State despite being enrolled for several years there. Despite his seemingly simple nature, Dauber would often surprisingly be of intellectual help to the team, usually learned from a class he was attending or because he was a fan of &quot;Nova&quot;. Dauber would later graduate with &quot;three&quot; bachelor&#x27;s degrees in physical education, business administration, and forestry – without even knowing he was eligible for all three until he got his transcript.

Women&#x27;s basketball coach Judy Watkins (Pam Stone) often engaged in prank wars with Hayden. His relationship with her was complicated by the fact that Dauber dated her until 1995, when she confessed to an affair after returning from a coaching job in Romania. Also seen throughout the run was fussy, budget-conscious Minnesota State athletic director Howard Burleigh (Kenneth Kimmins) and his cheerful wife, Shirley (Georgia Engel), who were close friends with Hayden and Christine.

At the end of season 7, Hayden is offered a job with a fictional NFL expansion team called the Orlando Breakers. Hayden agrees and takes his coaching staff with him for the final two seasons. The Foxes adopted a baby boy named Timothy (played by twins Brennan and Brian Felker). Many season 9 episodes focused on the couple&#x27;s newfound joy of parenthood, as they had been unable to conceive a child together before they decided to adopt.

== Episodes ==

=== &quot;Viva Las Vegas&quot; ===
The 9th-season episode &quot;Viva Las Ratings&quot; is part of a crossover with &quot;Grace Under Fire&quot;, &quot;The Drew Carey Show&quot;, and &quot;Ellen&quot; set in Las Vegas. It features Kathy Kinney as Mimi Bobeck, Drew Carey as Drew Carey, Joely Fisher as Paige Clark, and Jeremy Piven as Spence Kovak.

== Development ==
The creator and producer of the show, Barry Kemp, an alumnus of the University of Iowa, paid homage to his alma mater by naming the main character of &quot;Coach&quot; (Hayden Fox) after the University of Iowa&#x27;s longtime football coach Hayden Fry. Many of the exterior shots of &quot;Minnesota State&quot; are actually of the University of Iowa, usually of students walking around the Iowa Memorial Union in downtown Iowa City. The screen shot when returning from commercial breaks is of the outside of the Hillcrest dormitory. There are also numerous shots of Quadrangle Residence Hall as well as the Field House, which once served as the venue for University of Iowa basketball.

== Setting ==

=== Minnesota State University ===
In 1963 several bills before the Minnesota State Legislature were developed to create a research university at what was then Mankato State College. Representative Mike McGuire of Montgomery, Minnesota, submitted an amendment that would have changed the name of the institution to Minnesota State University.

During the series run, no school was officially named Minnesota State University. Separately, in 1998 (a year after the show ended) an act of the Minnesota legislature allowed for the renaming of Mankato State University to Minnesota State University, Mankato because of to its growing size and to provide better recognition across the Midwest region. As a reaction to this and at the urging of the Board of Trustees of the Minnesota State Colleges and Universities System, two years later, in 2000, Moorhead State University was also renamed Minnesota State University Moorhead to try to provide parity to other regions regarding the impact of the Mankato name change. The common nickname of Minnesota State has always traditionally referred to Minnesota State University, Mankato, since this historical period. The athletic programs at Mankato are widely referred to in the media as &quot;Minnesota State&quot;, without a city identifier, although its sports teams are named the Mavericks instead of Screaming Eagles; however, both the fictional and real-life Minnesota State universities share purple and yellow as school colors.

There are several similarities between fictional Minnesota State University and the real-world Minnesota State Mankato. The Minnesota State Screaming Eagles school colors of purple and gold are also the colors for Minnesota State Mankato and the Minnesota Vikings. The location for the fictional Minnesota State University is never established, however, in several episodes it is mentioned that the campus is located about an hour away from the Twin Cities. The distance from Minneapolis to Mankato is approximately an hour away by car. Coach is shown to live in a cabin near a lake, similarly several faculty in reality live in cabins on nearby Lake Washington. The founding of the fictional university is shown to be 1867 in the opening credits and the real university at times was also referred to as being founded in 1867. Later decisions by school administration placed the official date as being founded in 1868.

During the course of the show, Minnesota State&#x27;s college football conference affiliation is never mentioned. The Screaming Eagles were mentioned to play big-name schools like Michigan State and Tennessee, but other fictional schools, such as Western Colorado, are also mentioned. In the intro of the show, it is shown that Hayden got his coaching start at Chattanooga University, a fictionalized version of the real-life University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (which brands its athletic program as &quot;Chattanooga&quot;). Outdoor shots of campus and stadium were filmed at Kinnick Stadium at the University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa, where creator Barry Kemp went to college. In several episodes, Hayden Fox refers to visiting Christine in the Twin Cities, and it is evident that he is maintaining a long-distance relationship.

In the early 1990s, the producers of the show held a contest to have a real college marching band record the theme song for the show. The contest was won by the Iowa State University Cyclone Football &#x27;Varsity&#x27; Marching Band, and their recording was used as the theme until the series ended. The Iowa State University Cyclone Football &#x27;Varsity&#x27; Marching Band was also shown in the opening sequence of the show.

In the 1993–1994 television season, Hayden Fox led his Minnesota State Screaming Eagles to victory in the Pioneer Bowl, held in San Antonio, winning the national championship. In real life, Florida State won the national championship that season. The Alamodome opened in May 1993, in time for the real-life 1993 football season. However, the first Alamo Bowl and Pioneer Bowl games had not been played yet. Also, the real-life Pioneer Bowl is not even an NCAA Division I game, but rather a now-defunct postseason game played between the champions of two Division II conferences whose members are all historically black schools (the game ceased to be held after 2012). Footage from the 1993 edition of the Wisconsin vs. Minnesota rivalry game played in the Metrodome was used for the actual game to represent Minnesota State and the fictional West Texas University (not to be confused with the real West Texas A&amp;M University or Texas Western College, now known as UTEP). Then-ABC sportscaster Al Michaels provides the commentary during the game.

=== Orlando Breakers ===
In the 1995 season, Hayden Fox gets a chance to fulfill his ultimate dream and become the head coach of an NFL team. He accepts the head coaching position with the (fictional) expansion team the Orlando Breakers, owned by recent widow Doris Sherman (played by Katherine Helmond). Sherman, however, is more interested in making money off of the team as well as gimmicks (such as asking if Hayden would like to coach a basketball team she was thinking of buying after selling the Breakers and trading away their first-round draft pick for a pair of cruise tickets) than she is in letting Coach Fox guide the Breakers to success on the football field. Nearly the entire crew from Minnesota State followed Fox to Orlando, including Luther and Dauber, who remained his assistant coaches. In the final season, Hayden is able to coach the Breakers to a wild card spot in the NFL Playoffs but loses to the Buffalo Bills in that playoff game at Buffalo.

The name Orlando Breakers was a salute to the original USFL and the Boston/New Orleans/Portland Breakers. The Breakers themselves were a parody of the fellow Florida-based Jacksonville Jaguars, who, like the Breakers, joined the NFL in 1995 as an expansion team and made the playoffs their second season as a wild card team and, like the Breakers, played the Bills in their first playoff game. (Unlike the Breakers, the Jaguars came out victorious, 30–27, eventually losing to the New England Patriots 20–6 in the AFC Championship Game.) Another tie-in between the Breakers and the Jaguars was that the first game the latter played in, the 1995 Pro Football Hall of Fame Game (against their expansion brethren the Carolina Panthers), aired on ABC, the same network as &quot;Coach&quot;.

=== Series finale ===
The 200th and final episode of the sitcom, titled &quot;Leaving Orlando&quot;, aired on ABC on May 14, 1997. The final scene in the final episode featured the whole cast thanking the audience for eight and a half years of the show and showing a plaque commemorating it, with cast member Jerry Van Dyke denying the series ending, thinking the show must go on. But the cast and director finally tell Van Dyke that the show is truly over, with Van Dyke still denying the show&#x27;s finale: As the lights go out, Van Dyke mumbles, &quot;I don&#x27;t care what you say, I&#x27;m coming to work Monday.&quot;

The final episode also includes an epilogue showing that Hayden retired from coaching and moved back to his cabin in Minnesota to raise his son, with Christine being a working wife at a local station. Luther also retired and continued his relationship with Doris, building a Graceland style manor as tribute to his idol, Elvis Presley. Howard and Shirley sold their collection of rare Barbie dolls, using the capital to acquire and manage a successful dinner theatre in Florida. Dauber succeeded Hayden as the head coach of the Breakers, winning back-to-back Super Bowl championships and going on to join the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; announcing team after his retirement from football. The final scene shows a 10-year-old Tim having two friends who bear a striking resemblance to child versions of Dauber and Luther.

== Syndication ==
The show entered local syndication reruns in September 1993. Reruns have also previously aired on Antenna TV, ReelzChannel, WGN America, USA Network, Nick at Nite and TBS.

Netflix discontinued &quot;Coach&quot; on September 15, 2015.

Roku currently offers the entire series (sans the Pilot episode) free on demand.

IFC currently airs reruns of the series from 9am to 1pm ET on Thursdays.

== Scheduling conflict with &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; ==

For season seven, ABC aired original episodes of &quot;Coach&quot; on Monday night, before &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;, as part of a football-themed night. This was successful on the United States east coast, where &quot;MNF&quot; games aired from 9:00 pm to 12:30 am, local time. However, on the west coast, &quot;MNF&quot; games aired from 6:00 pm to 9:30 pm (with possible overtime), leaving some Monday network programming with no time slots. During this interval, the show was aired at unusual hours on the west coast. For instance, Seattle ABC affiliate KOMO aired new episodes of &quot;Coach&quot; on Saturday afternoons (coincidentally, ABC also aired college football games most of the time on Saturday afternoons). Some fans have cited this time-slot displacement on the west coast as a reason for low ratings in season seven. &quot;Coach&quot; was moved to Wednesday nights before the end of the season, and was then moved back to Tuesday nights the following season; this resulted in a bump in ratings, returning &quot;Coach&quot; to the top 20.

==Home media==
Universal Pictures has released the first four seasons of &quot;Coach&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Two different versions were released of the first season: a regular edition and a limited edition which featured special packaging (a playbook).

On July 1, 2016, it was announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1; they subsequently re-released the first two seasons on DVD on September 6, 2016.

On September 12, 2017, Mill Creek released &quot;Coach – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD in Region 1 for the very first time. The 18-disc set contains all 9 seasons of the series, the first time episodes beyond season 4 have been available on DVD.

Universal Pictures UK released season 1 on DVD in Region 2 on August 7, 2006.

== Attempted sequel ==
On March 26, 2015, NBC ordered 13 episodes of a sequel series to &quot;Coach&quot;, set to focus on Hayden Fox&#x27;s son, who had recently taken a coaching job at a small college. Most of the original series&#x27; stars were set to reprise their roles, except for Shelley Fabares who was battling autoimmune hepatitis. Her role as Christine, Hayden&#x27;s wife, was to be written off as having died with Hayden written as a recent widower. On August 31, 2015, TVLine reported the series had been cancelled due to the pilot having &quot;mixed results&quot;.

<doc id="870938" wikidata="Q7733527" url="?curid=870938" title="The Fatal Shore">
<text>The Fatal Shore: The Epic of Australia&#x27;s Founding is a 1986 book by Robert Hughes. It provides a history of the early years of British colonisation of Australia, and especially the history and social effects of Britain&#x27;s convict transportation system. It also addresses the historical, political and sociological reasons that led to British settlement. It was first published in 1986.

Hughes was an Australian man who became an internationally well-known art critic, living in Europe and then New York, where he became art critic for &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Hughes&#x27;s interest in Australia&#x27;s convict era began in the early 1970s, when he was filming a TV documentary about the history of Australian art that took him to Port Arthur in Tasmania.

==Awards==
* 1987 Duff Cooper Prize.
* 1988 WH Smith Literary Award.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Fatal Shore&quot; was originally published in 1986 by Alfred A. Knopf in the United States and by William Collins in the UK, and subsequently published in paperback in 
the UK by Collins Harvill in 1987. The Folio Society published a slipcased premium edition in 1998, extending to a fourth printing in 2006.

==Reception==
Australian novelist Thomas Keneally, in a review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, described the book as &quot;an authoritative and engrossing record,&quot; stating that &quot;although the story of the convict system has recently been covered by a number of Australian historians, this account, richly peopled with bizarre and compelling characters, is probably the most full-blooded and monumental treatment the subject has been given.&quot;

Brian Smith, writing in the &quot;World Socialist Web Site&quot;, gave a positive review of the book, declaring that it &quot;provide[s] a vivid portrayal of the human cost of Britain&#x27;s colonial venture and how these experiences have helped shape modern Australia.&quot;

Historian Geoffrey Blainey wrote in &quot;A Shorter History of Australia&quot; that &quot;Robert Hughes&#x27;s wonderfully written history of the convicts, &quot;The Fatal Shore&quot;, was to entice more readers than any other book on Australia&#x27;s history, but he loaded the dice when he likened the convict system to the Gulag Archipelago in the Soviet Union.&quot;

In a 2013 &quot;Quadrant&quot; article, historian Keith Windschuttle argued that &quot;The Fatal Shore&quot; &quot;remains the most widely read representation of the old anti-British historical paradigm created from the 1940s to the 1970s by Marxists and other leftists in university history departments.&quot; Windschuttle wrote that &quot;Hughes’s gift for the dramatic phrase led him to go further than his sources and argue that nineteenth-century New South Wales was actually a precursor to Stalin’s Gulag Archipelago.&quot;

<doc id="870946" wikidata="Q156608" url="?curid=870946" title="The Bourne Supremacy (film)">
<text>The Bourne Supremacy is a 2004 action-thriller film featuring Robert Ludlum&#x27;s Jason Bourne character. Although it takes the name of the second Bourne novel (1986), its plot is entirely different. The film was directed by Paul Greengrass from a screenplay by Tony Gilroy. It is the second installment in the &quot;Bourne&quot; franchise, a direct sequel to &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot; (2002).

&quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; continues the story of Jason Bourne, a former CIA assassin suffering from psychogenic amnesia. Bourne is portrayed by Matt Damon. The film focuses on his attempt to learn more of his past as he is once more enveloped in a conspiracy involving the CIA and Operation Treadstone. Actors Brian Cox and Julia Stiles reprise their roles as Ward Abbott and Nicky Parsons, respectively. Joan Allen joins the cast as Deputy Director and Task Force Chief Pamela Landy.

Universal Pictures released the film to theaters in the United States on July 23, 2004, to positive reviews and commercial success, grossing $290 million on a $75 million budget. The film was followed by &quot;The Bourne Ultimatum&quot; (2007), &quot;The Bourne Legacy&quot; (2012), and &quot;Jason Bourne&quot; (2016).

==Plot==

Jason Bourne and Marie Kreutz are living in Goa, India. He is still suffering from amnesia, so he records flashbacks about his life as a CIA assassin in a notebook.

In Berlin, a CIA agent working for Deputy Director Pamela Landy is paying $3 million to an unnamed Russian source for the Neski files, documents on the theft of $20 million seven years prior. The deal is interrupted by Kirill, a Russian Federal Security Service agent who works for oligarch Yuri Gretkov. He kills the agent and source, steals the files and money, and plants fingerprints framing Bourne for the attack.

After finding Bourne&#x27;s fingerprint, Landy asks Section Chief Ward Abbott about Operation Treadstone, the defunct CIA program to which Bourne belonged. She tells Abbott that the CIA agent who stole the $20 million was named in the Neski files. Some years ago, Russian politician Vladimir Neski was about to identify the thief when he was killed by his wife in a suspected murder-suicide in Berlin. Landy believes that Bourne and Treadstone&#x27;s late supervisor, Alexander Conklin, were involved and that Bourne killed the Neskis.

Gretkov directs Kirill to Goa to kill Bourne, who flees with Marie; Kirill follows and kills her, unaware that they switched seats in the midst of the chase. Bourne leaves Goa and travels to Naples, where he allows himself to be identified by security. He subdues a Diplomatic Security agent and a Carabinieri guard and copies the SIM card from his cell phone. From the subsequent phone call, he learns about Landy and the frame job.

Bourne goes to Munich to visit Jarda, the only other remaining Treadstone operative. Jarda informs him Treadstone was shut down after Conklin&#x27;s death, then attacks him; Bourne strangles him to death, before destroying his home in a gas explosion as agents move in.

Bourne follows Landy and Abbott to Berlin as they meet former Treadstone support technician Nicky Parsons to question her about Bourne. Bourne believes the CIA is hunting him again and calls Landy from a nearby roof. He demands a meet-up with Nicky and indicates to Landy that he can see her in the office.

Bourne kidnaps Nicky in Alexanderplatz and learns from her that Abbott had been Conklin&#x27;s boss. He releases her after she reveals she knows nothing about the mission. Bourne then visits the hotel where the killing took place and recalls more of his mission: he killed Neski on Conklin&#x27;s orders, and when Neski&#x27;s wife showed up, he shot her and made it look like a murder-suicide.

Danny Zorn, Conklin&#x27;s former assistant, finds inconsistencies in the report of Bourne&#x27;s involvement with the death of the agent and explains his theory to Abbott. Abbott then kills Zorn to prevent him from informing Landy.

Bourne breaks into Abbott&#x27;s hotel room and records a conversation between him and Gretkov that incriminates them in the theft of the $20 million. When confronted, Abbott admits to Bourne that he stole the money, ordered Kirill to retrieve the files, and had Bourne framed before arranging for him to be silenced in Goa.

Abbott expects Bourne to kill him, but Bourne refuses, saying Marie would not want him to, and puts a gun on the table and leaves. Landy confronts Abbott about her suspicions and he kills himself; later, she finds an envelope containing the tape of Abbott&#x27;s conversations with Gretkov and Bourne in her hotel room.

Bourne travels to Moscow to find Neski&#x27;s daughter, Irena. Kirill, tasked once again by Gretkov with killing Bourne, finds and wounds him. Bourne flees in a stolen taxi and Kirill chases him. Bourne forces Kirill&#x27;s vehicle into a concrete divider, and leaves behind a seriously wounded Kirill, as Gretkov is arrested with Landy watching in the background. Bourne locates Irena and confesses to murdering her parents, apologizing to her as he leaves.

Later in New York City, Bourne calls Landy. She thanks him for the tape, reveals his original name, David Webb, and his date and place of birth, and asks him to meet her. Bourne, who is watching her from a building tells her she looks tired and to get some rest, as he disappears into the city.

==Cast==

In addition, Oksana Akinshina appears as Irena Neski.

==Production==

The producers replaced Doug Liman, who directed &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;. This was mainly due to the difficulties Liman had with the studio when making the first film, and their unwillingness to work with him again. British director Paul Greengrass was selected to direct the film after the producers saw &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot; (2002), Greengrass&#x27; depiction of the Bloody Sunday shootings in Northern Ireland, at Gilroy&#x27;s suggestion. Producer Patrick Crowley liked Greengrass&#x27; &quot;sense of the camera as [a] participatory viewer&quot;, a visual style Crowley thought would work well for &quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot;. The film was shot in reverse order of its settings: some portions of the car chase and the film&#x27;s ending were shot in Moscow, then most of the rest of the film was shot in and around Berlin, and the opening scenes in Goa, India were filmed last.

&quot;Two weeks before [the film&#x27;s] release, [Greengrass] got together with its star, Matt Damon, came up with a new ending and phoned the producers saying the new idea was way better. And it would cost $200,000 and involve pulling Damon from the set of &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Twelve&quot; for a re-shoot. Reluctantly the producers agreed—the movie tested 10 points higher with the new ending&quot;.

==Reception==

===Box office===
&quot;The Bourne Supremacy&quot; grossed $116.2million domestically (United States and Canada) and $114.4million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $290.6million, against a budget of $75million. Released Jul 23, 2004, it opened at No. 1 and spent eight of its first nine weeks in the Top 10 at the domestic box office.

===Critical response===

Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, writing that it &quot;treats the material with gravity and uses good actors in well-written supporting roles [that] elevates the movie above its genre, but not quite out of it.&quot;

===Accolades===

At the 2005 Taurus World Stunt Awards, veteran Russian stunt coordinator Viktor Ivanov and Scottish stunt driver Gillie McKenzie won the &quot;Best Vehicle&quot; award for their driving in the Moscow car chase scene. Dan Bradley, the film&#x27;s second unit director won the overall award for stunt coordinator. The film ranks 454th on Empire&#x27;s 2008 list of the 500 greatest movies of all time.
