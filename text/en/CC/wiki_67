<text>Lead(II) sulfide (also spelled &quot;sulphide&quot;) is an inorganic compound with the formula PbS. Galena is the principal ore and the most important compound of lead. It is a semiconducting material with niche uses.

==Formation, basic properties, related materials==
Addition of hydrogen sulfide or sulfide salts to a solution containing a lead salt, such as PbCl2, gives a black precipitate of lead sulfide. 
: Pb2+ + H2S → PbS↓ + 2 H+

This reaction is used in qualitative inorganic analysis. The presence of hydrogen sulfide or sulfide ions may be tested using &quot;lead acetate paper.&quot;

Like the related materials PbSe and PbTe, PbS is a semiconductor. In fact, lead sulfide was one of the earliest materials to be used as a semiconductor. Lead sulfide crystallizes in the sodium chloride motif, unlike many other IV-VI semiconductors.

Since PbS is the main ore of lead, much effort has focused on its conversion. A major process involves smelting of PbS followed by reduction of the resulting oxide. Idealized equations for these two steps are:
: 2 PbS + 3 O2 → 2 PbO + 2 SO2
: PbO + C → Pb + CO

The sulfur dioxide is converted to sulfuric acid.

=== Nanoparticles ===
Lead sulfide-containing nanoparticle and quantum dots have been well studied. Traditionally, such materials are produced by combining lead salts with a variety of sulfide sources. In 2009, PbS nanoparticles have been examined for use in solar cells.

==Applications==

=== Photodetector ===

PbS was one of the first materials used for electrical diodes that could detect electromagnetic radiation, including infrared light. As an infrared sensor, PbS directly detects light, as opposed to thermal detectors, which respond to a change in detector element temperature caused by the radiation. A PbS element can be used to measure radiation in either of two ways: by measuring the tiny photocurrent the photons cause when they hit the PbS material, or by measuring the change in the material&#x27;s electrical resistance that the photons cause. Measuring the resistance change is the more commonly used method. At room temperature, PbS is sensitive to radiation at wavelengths between approximately 1 and 2.5 μm. This range corresponds to the shorter wavelengths in the infra-red portion of the spectrum, the so-called short-wavelength infrared (SWIR). Only very hot objects emit radiation in these wavelengths.

Cooling the PbS elements, for example using liquid nitrogen or a Peltier element system, shifts its sensitivity range to between approximately 2 and 4 μm. Objects that emit radiation in these wavelengths still have to be quite hot—several hundred degrees Celsius—but not as hot as those detectable by uncooled sensors. (Other compounds used for this purpose include indium antimonide (InSb) and mercury-cadmium telluride (HgCdTe), which have somewhat better properties for detecting the longer IR wavelengths.) The high dielectric constant of PbS leads to relatively slow detectors (compared to silicon, germanium, InSb, or HgCdTe).

==Planetary science==
Elevations above 2.6 km (1.63 mi) on the planet Venus are coated with a shiny substance. Though the composition of this coat is not entirely certain, one theory is that Venus &quot;snows&quot; crystallized lead sulfide much as Earth snows frozen water. If this is the case, it would be the first time the substance was identified on a foreign planet. Other less likely candidates for Venus&#x27; &quot;snow&quot; are bismuth sulfide and tellurium.

==Safety==
Lead(II) sulfide is so insoluble that it is almost nontoxic, but pyrolysis of the material, as in smelting, gives dangerous toxic fumes of lead and oxides of sulfur. Lead sulfide is insoluble and a stable compound in the pH of blood and so is probably one of the less toxic forms of lead. A large safety risk occurs in the synthesis of PbS using lead carboxylates, as they are particularly soluble and can cause negative physiological conditions.

<text>East Antrim is a parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom House of Commons. It is currently represented by Sammy Wilson of the Democratic Unionist Party.

A constituency with the same name is also used for elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly.

==Constituency profile==
The seat covers the east coast from Cushendun down to Carrickfergus. The seat is strongly unionist and one of the few areas of Northern Ireland which voted to leave the European Union.

==Boundaries==

The original county constituency comprised the eastern part of County Antrim, being carved out of the former Antrim constituency. From 1885, East Antrim consisted of the baronies of Belfast Lower and Glenarm Upper, that part of the barony of Antrim Upper not in the constituency of South Antrim, that part of the barony of Antrim Lower not in the constituency of Mid Antrim, that part of the barony of Belfast Upper consisting of the parish of Ballymartin and the parish of Templepatrick apart from the townland of Ballyutoag, and the town of Carrickfergus.

It returned one Member of Parliament 1885–1922.

The current seat was created in boundary changes in 1983, as part of an expansion of Northern Ireland&#x27;s constituencies from 12 to 17, and was predominantly made up from parts of North Antrim and South Antrim. Since further revisions in 1995 (when it lost part of the district of Newtownabbey to the North Belfast constituency) it now covers the entirety of the districts of Larne and Carrickfergus, as well as part of Newtownabbey and Moyle.

Prior to the 2010 general election the Boundary Commission originally proposed two significant changes for East Antrim. In the south of the constituency it was proposed to transfer a further part of Newtownabbey to the North Belfast constituency whilst in the north the seat would have gained the Glens and Ballycastle in Moyle district from North Antrim. East Antrim would have been renamed &#x27;Antrim Coast &amp; Glens&#x27;. However this latter part of the proposal raised many questions, with some already arguing that the Glens have no natural ties to Jordanstown (and in 1995 the previous Boundary Commission cited this very reason when rejecting such a proposal).

Following consultation and revising the recommendations, the new boundaries for East Antrim were confirmed and passed through Parliament by the Northern Ireland Parliamentary Constituencies Order as follows:
*The whole district of Carrickfergus
*The whole district of Larne
*Glenaan, Glenariff, and Glendun from the Moyle district
*From Newtownabbey, the wards of Jordanstown, Monkstown, and Rostulla

The constituency boundaries were amended again by the 2023 Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies, and first contested at the 2024 general election. It consists of:

* The District of Antrim and Newtownabbey wards of Abbey, Jordanstown, Monkstown, and Rostulla, the District of Causeway Coat and Glens ward of Lurigethan, and the District of Mid and East Antrim wards of Ballycarry and Glynn, Boneybefore, Burleigh Hill, Cairncastle, Carnlough and Glenarm, Castle, Craigyhill, Curran and Inver, Gardenmore, Glenravel, Glenwhirry, Glenwhirry, Gortalee, Greenisland, Islandmagee, Kilroot, Kilwaughter, Love Lane, Slemish, Slemish, Sunnylands, The Maidens, Victoria, Whitehead South, and Woodburn.

== History ==

===1885 until 1922===
The constituency was a strongly conservative then unionist area, where republican and nationalist candidates were not elected.

From 1886 to 1974 the Conservative and Unionist members of the United Kingdom House of Commons formed a single Parliamentary party.

From 1905 there was an Ulster Unionist organisation, but MPs sponsored by it are classified as Irish Unionists until the 1921 Northern Ireland general election made the partition of Ireland effective so that Irish Unionism ceased to be a realistic objective.

A victory for the Unionist candidate in 1918 by 15,206 votes to Sinn Féin&#x27;s 861 votes demonstrated the virtual unanimity of the unionist support.

Consequently, Sinn Féin did not contest the 1919 by-election in the constituency.

In 1922, the constituency was incorporated into the Antrim constituency, which from 1950 until 1983 was divided into the North Antrim and South Antrim constituencies.

===The First Dáil===
Sinn Féin contested the general election of 1918 on the platform that instead of taking up any seats they won in the United Kingdom Parliament, they would establish a revolutionary assembly in Dublin. In republican theory every MP elected in Ireland was a potential Deputy to this assembly. In practice only the Sinn Féin members accepted the offer.

The revolutionary First Dáil assembled on 21 January 1919 and last met on 10 May 1921. The First Dáil, according to a resolution passed on 10 May 1921, was formally dissolved on the assembling of the Second Dáil. This took place on 16 August 1921.

In 1921 Sinn Féin decided to use the UK authorised elections for the Northern Ireland House of Commons and the House of Commons of Southern Ireland as a poll for the Irish Republic&#x27;s Second Dáil. This area, in republican theory, was incorporated in a seven-member Dáil constituency of Antrim.

===Constituency since 1983===
The constituency is overwhelmingly unionist, with the combined votes for nationalist parties rarely exceeding 10%. However, there have been above average votes for parties outside the traditional unionist block, such as the Alliance and the Conservatives. In the local government elections for the equivalent area many votes often go to independent candidates or groups such as the Newtownabbey Ratepayers Association. While the SDLP sprung a surprise in 1998 by overtaking a DUP candidate to win the final seat due to Ulster Unionist transfers – the first time that any nationalist candidate has benefited in this way.

The main interest in Westminster Elections has been the contest between the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party. In 1983 the UUP were only 367 votes ahead of the DUP. As part of a pact to oppose the Anglo-Irish Agreement the DUP did not contest the seat until 1992 but they still failed to come close, though in the 1996 elections to the Northern Ireland Forum they were only slightly behind the UUP. But in the 2001 general election they achieved an astonishing result when they came with 128 votes of winning the Westminster seat, despite not having targeted it. In the 2003 Assembly election they followed this up by gaining two additional MLAs and outpolling the UUP for the first time.

The DUP remained eager to take the Westminster seat and in the 2005 general election they did so.

== Members of Parliament ==
The Member of Parliament since the 2005 general election is Sammy Wilson of the Democratic Unionist Party. In that election he defeated Roy Beggs of the Ulster Unionist Party, who had sat for the seat since it was created at the 1983 general election.

<text>Archibald Roane (1759/60 – January 18, 1819) was the second Governor of Tennessee, serving from 1801 to 1803. He won the office after the state&#x27;s first governor, John Sevier, was prevented by constitutional restrictions from seeking a fourth consecutive term. He quickly became caught up in the growing rivalry between Sevier and Andrew Jackson, and was soundly defeated by Sevier after just one term. Roane served as an attorney general in the Southwest Territory in the early 1790s, and later served as a judge on the state&#x27;s Superior Court of Law and Equity (1796–1801) and the Supreme Court of Errors and Appeals (1815–1819).

==Early life==
Roane was born in 1759 or 1760 in Derry Township (then a part of Lancaster County) in the Province of Pennsylvania. He was the son of Andrew and Margaret Walker Roane. Andrew Roane, who was born in Northern Ireland, was one of four sons of Archibald Gilbert Roane, a Scotsman who had been awarded land in Ireland in return for his British military service. All of the sons of Archibald Gilbert Roane emigrated to America. After Andrew and Margaret Roane both died when young Archibald Roane was about eight years old, he was raised by an uncle, John Roane, a Presbyterian minister, who provided him with a good education. 
During the Revolutionary War, Archibald Roane served in the Continental Army as a member of the Lancaster County Militia (5th Company, 9th Battalion, Pennsylvania Volunteers). He was among the troops who took part in Washington&#x27;s crossing of the Delaware River and the subsequent Battle of Trenton in December 1776, and was present at the surrender of General Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781.

In the 1780s he settled for a time in vicinity of Lexington, Rockbridge County, Virginia, where he studied and later taught at Liberty Hall Academy, a predecessor institution to Washington and Lee University. In Virginia, he married Ann (or Anne) Campbell, whom he had met there, in 1788.

Shortly after his marriage in 1788, Roane moved to Jonesborough, Tennessee, then still a part of North Carolina, where he was admitted to the bar and began the practice of law.

In 1790, when the Southwest Territory was formed, territorial governor William Blount appointed Roane to the position of Attorney and Solicitor for Greene County and later Territorial Attorney General for the Washington District. In 1796, he represented Jefferson County at the state constitutional convention. This convention wrote the original Tennessee Constitution, which took effect that same year when Tennessee became a U.S. state. Later in 1796, he became one of the three judges of the Superior Court of Law and Equity, the highest court established under the new state constitution.

==Governor of Tennessee==

In 1801, Governor John Sevier had reached the limit of three consecutive terms allowed as governor under the state constitution, and Roane ran virtually unopposed to become his successor. The Great Seal of Tennessee was adopted during the Roane Administration in 1801, and Tennessee was divided into three Congressional districts. Roane also signed anti-fraud measures, a law outlawing dueling, and a law prohibiting the disturbance of public worship. Like his predecessor, much of Roane&#x27;s time as governor was spent dealing with disputes between white settlers and Indians.

Roane coordinated efforts to begin construction of the Natchez Trace, convincing Secretary of War Henry Dearborn to construct inns and military posts along the road, and provide rewards for the apprehension of bandits who harassed Natchez travellers. He also appointed a commission that successfully resolved a boundary dispute with Virginia. In October 1802, Spain revoked American access to the critical port of New Orleans following the port&#x27;s transfer to France, and Roane, acting on orders from President Jefferson, prepared the state militia for possible armed conflict. The situation was resolved by the Louisiana Purchase the following year.

In February 1803, the state militia convened to elect its commander. The vote ended in a tie between Sevier and Andrew Jackson, and the constitution stipulated that the governor cast the deciding vote. Jackson presented Roane with evidence that Sevier had been complicit in the forging of deeds at North Carolina&#x27;s Nashville land office in the 1780s, and Roane cast the deciding vote for Jackson.

Enraged that Jackson, 20 years his junior and lacking in military experience, had defeated him for militia commander, Sevier immediately embarked upon a campaign to regain the governorship. Roane and Jackson released the Nashville land office documents and accused Sevier of trying to thwart an investigation into the matter while he was governor, but Sevier&#x27;s popularity proved insurmountable. On election day, Sevier defeated Roane, 6,780 votes to 4,923.

==Later life==

After losing the 1803 gubernatorial election, Roane returned to the practice of law. In 1805, he again challenged Sevier for the governorship, but was defeated, 10,293 votes to 5,795.

In 1811, Roane was elected to a circuit judgeship, and in 1815, he became a judge on the Tennessee Supreme Court of Errors and Appeals, which had replaced the Superior Court of Law and Equity as the state&#x27;s highest court in 1809. He served on that court until his death on January 18, 1819. He was a promoter of institutions of higher learning until his death, serving as a trustee of Blount College (the forerunner of the University of Tennessee), Greeneville College, and Washington College.

Roane is buried at Pleasant Forest Cemetery in Farragut, Tennessee. In June 1918, the state placed a monument on his grave, which was previously unmarked.

==Legacy==
Roane County, Tennessee, is named in his honor. Roane County, West Virginia, is named for a cousin, Spencer Roane. A nephew, John Selden Roane, was governor of Arkansas. Archibald Roane&#x27;s wife, Ann, was a sister of Colonel Arthur Campbell (1743–1811) and Judge David Campbell (1750–1812), an aunt of Governor David Campbell (1779–1859) of Virginia, and a great-aunt of future Tennessee governor William B. Campbell (1807–1867).

<text>Albategnius is an ancient lunar impact crater located in the central highlands. It is named after the Mesopotamian Muslim astronomer and scientist Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn Jābir ibn Sinān al-Raqqī al-Ḥarrānī aṣ-Ṣābiʾ al-Battānī, Latinized as &quot;Albategnius&quot;.

Albategnius is one of the largest craters of Nectarian age.

==Description==

The level interior of Albategnius forms a walled plain, surrounded by the high, rim. The outer wall is somewhat hexagon-shaped, and has been heavily eroded with impacts, valleys, and landslips. It attains a height above 4,000 metres along the northeast face. The rim is broken in the southwest by the smaller crater Klein.

Offset to the west of the crater&#x27;s midpoint is its central peak, designated Alpha (α) Albategnius. It is longest in extent in the north–south direction, extending for just under 20 kilometres, and has a width about half that. The peak rises to an altitude of roughly 1.5 km, and a tiny, relatively fresh crater is at the top.

==Location==

Albategnius is located to the south of the crater Hipparchus and to the east of both Ptolemaeus and Alphonsus. The surface in this area is marked by a set of nearly parallel scars that form channels running roughly in a north–south line, bent slightly to the southeast.

==Observations==
Albategnius is believed to have been featured prominently in an early sketch drawing by Galileo in his book Sidereus Nuncius (1610), appearing along the lunar terminator.

==Names==
Albategnius is named after Mesopotamian Arab astronomer Al-Battani. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, it was given its name by Giovanni Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized. Earlier lunar cartographers had given the feature different names. Michael van Langren&#x27;s 1645 map calls it &quot;Ferdinandi III Imp. Rom.&quot; after Ferdinand III, the Holy Roman Emperor. Johannes Hevelius called it &quot;Didymus Mons&quot;.

==Satellite craters==

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Albategnius.

<doc id="863508" wikidata="Q901378" url="?curid=863508" title="Dalton Plan">
<text>The Dalton Plan is an educational concept created by Helen Parkhurst. It is inspired by the intellectual ferment at the turn of the 20th century. Educational thinkers such as Maria Montessori and John Dewey influenced Parkhurst while she created the Dalton Plan. Their aim was to achieve a balance between a child&#x27;s talent and the needs of the community.

==Characteristics==
Parkhurst&#x27;s specific objectives were as follows:
# To tailor each student&#x27;s program to his or her needs, interests and abilities. 
# To promote each student&#x27;s independence and dependability. 
# To enhance the student&#x27;s social skills. 
# To increase their sense of responsibility toward others.
Influenced at least in part by the teachings of Judo after conversations with the founder of Kodokan Judo, Dr Jigoro Kano. Ref page 72 and 86 ISBN 978-1-56836-479-1

She developed a three-part plan that continues to be the structural foundation of a Dalton education:
# The House, a social community of students.
# The Assignment, a monthly goal which students contract to complete.
# The Laboratory, a subject-based classroom intended to be the center of the educational experience. The laboratory involves students from fourth grade through the end of secondary education.

Students move between subject &quot;laboratories&quot; (classrooms) and explore themes at their own pace.

==Introduction in UK==
In 1920, an article describing the working of the Dalton Plan in detail was published in the &quot;Times&#x27; Educational Supplement&quot;. Parkhurst &quot;has given to the secondary school the leisure and culture of the University student; she has uncongested the curriculum; she has abolished the teacher&#x27;s nightly preparation of classes and the child&#x27;s nightmare of homework. At the same time the children under her regime cover automatically all the ground prescribed for examinations &#x27;of matriculation standard,&#x27; and examination failures among them are nil.&quot;

The Dalton Plan is a method of education by which pupils work at their own pace, and receive individual help from the teacher when necessary. There is no formal class instruction. Students draw up time-tables and are responsible for finishing the work on their syllabuses or assignments. Students are also encouraged to help each other with their work. The underlying aim of the Dalton Plan is to achieve the highest mental, moral, physical and spiritual development of the pupil.

In the spring of 1921, English headmistress Rosa Bassett went to the Children&#x27;s University School and stayed with Parkhurst. They spent hours talking about education. Parkhurst found Bassett in complete agreement with her ideas: &quot;She was Dalton,&quot; Parkhurst wrote 50 years later. She described Bassett and Belle Rennie as the two people in England who were most enthusiastic and most helpful about the introduction of the Dalton Plan. Rosa Bassett was instrumental in the first application of the Dalton Plan of teaching within an English secondary school. She contributed a chapter to Parkhurst&#x27;s book on the Plan,

<text>The Superior Hiking Trail, also known as the SHT, is a long hiking trail in northeastern Minnesota that follows the rocky ridges overlooking Lake Superior for most of its length. The trail travels through forests of birch, aspen, pine, fir, and cedar. Hikers enjoy views of boreal forests, the Sawtooth Mountains, babbling brooks, rushing waterfalls, and abundant wildlife. The lowest point in the path is above sea level and the highest point is above sea level. The footpath is intended for hiking only. Motorized vehicles, mountain bikes, and horses are not allowed on the trail. Many people use the trail for long-distance hiking, and facilitating this purpose are 94 backcountry, fee-free campsites.

==History==
Construction of the Superior Hiking Trail began in the mid-1980s, and the trail now extends from the Minnesota-Wisconsin border southwest of Duluth to the Canada–US border. In addition there are of spur trails that connect trailheads to the main trail. Inspiration for building the trail came from the Appalachian Trail, which extends from Georgia to Maine. The Superior Hiking Trail Association (SHTA) was formed in 1986 to manage the construction, planning, and day-to-day care of the trail. The SHTA received several grants from the State of Minnesota, three of which were from the Legislative Commission on Minnesota Resources. This money helped jump start the construction of the trail and funded construction for the first few years. In 1987, the trail had an opening ceremony at Britton Peak to celebrate the beginning of construction. The ceremony included a log-cutting event and many state government officials and SHTA founders attended. Three years later, in August 1990, the trail had reached a half-way mark and another celebration was held. That celebration included a hike for about a dozen brave hikers who completed it in 12 days. Since 1991, a ultramarathon known as the &quot;Superior 100&quot;, along with several other races, has been hosted annually on the Superior Hiking Trail. In 1995, Paul Hlina, who was paralyzed from the waist down, hiked the entire trail on crutches and is now known as the first hiker to thru-hike the trail. He raised $16,000 in pledges for the Superior Hiking Trail Association, the non-profit organization which maintains the trail. Trail construction and improvements continued, and in 2016, the 30th year of trail construction, the Superior Hiking Trail became a continuous footpath from the Minnesota-Wisconsin border to the 270 Degree Overlook near the Canada–US border. The Superior Hiking Trail is now a portion of the North Country National Scenic Trail, a National Scenic Trail that stretches over from North Dakota to Vermont.

==Sections of the trail==
There are two primary sections to the Superior Hiking Trail.

The Duluth section of the trail comprises and starts southwest of the city of Duluth at the Minnesota-Wisconsin border. The trail extends to the northeast through Jay Cooke State Park, the Spirit Mountain Recreation Area, Brewer Park, Enger Park, the Historic Downtown Area, Canal Park, the Lakewalk, and Hartley Nature Center, before it ends at a trailhead located on Martin Road on the north side of the city. The Duluth section is particularly suited for day hiking. There is only one backcountry campground, located near the Minnesota-Wisconsin border, along the Duluth section.

The North Shore section of the trail is long and begins at the Martin Road Trailhead on the northern boundary of the City of Duluth. From there, the trail extends to the northeast along Lake Superior through seven state parks, including Gooseberry Falls State Park, Split Rock Lighthouse State Park and Tettegouche State Park. This section of the SHT passes near the towns of Lutsen and Grand Marais, and ends just before the Canada–United States border. The North Shore section provides backcountry experiences and is utilized by both day hikers and backpackers. The Superior Hiking Trail Association maintains 93 backcountry campgrounds along the North Shore section, and a traditional thru-hike of the Superior Hiking Trail typically spans this section. The total elevation gain along the North Shore section is 37,800 feet (11,500 m) and the elevation loss is 37,400 feet (11,400 m) for a northbound hiker.

On the northern end the Superior Hiking Trail is connected to the long Border Route Trail which starts a short distance from the trail head on Otter Lake Road. This then connects to the long Kekekabic Trail which gives the hiker the ability to hike all the way through the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness and end near Ely.

==The Superior Hiking Trail Association==

The Superior Hiking Trail Association (SHTA) builds, promotes and maintains the trail. It is a Minnesota-based non-profit corporation with more than 3200 members. The association produces a quarterly newsletter called &quot;The Ridgeline&quot; for its members which contains noteworthy news of the trail, trail volunteer bios, and association financial information. The most visible activities of the SHTA are the popular organized hikes featuring leaders with interpretive skills, such as naturalists, geologists, photographers, and historians and ranging from day hikes to backpacking trips of several days&#x27; duration.

The trail was mostly built by crews of people that were hired from local towns or by the Minnesota Conservation Corps. In addition, the SHTA coordinates the efforts of numerous volunteers who assist with trail and campground construction and maintenance. These volunteers include interested individuals, scout troops, and other outdoor organizations. Some groups have chosen to adopt a section of the trail to maintain, while others participate in scheduled maintenance hikes.

==Accolades==
In December 2000, &quot;Backpacker Magazine&quot; named the Superior Hiking Trail the trail with the &quot;Best Trail/Camp/Shelter Conditions,&quot; the trail with the &quot;Best Signage&quot; in the country, and one of the most scenic trails in the nation. Writer and backpacker Andrew Skurka says the Superior Hiking Trail is one of his ten favorite hikes in America. In 2005, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; listed the Superior Hiking Trail as one of the &quot;5 Best Hikes in America,&quot; and in 2015, &quot;The Guardian&quot; included the trail among the &quot;top 10 long-distance hiking trails in the US.&quot;

<text>S.P.A. (Società Piemontese Automobili) was an Italian automobile, military vehicle and aero-engine manufacturer founded in Turin by Matteo Ceirano and Michele Ansaldi. It was active between 1906 and 1926. In 1908, it merged with Fabbrica Ligure Automobili Genova (FLAG) and the new company, Società Ligure Piemontese Automobili, was headquartered in Genoa while manufacturing in Turin.

In 1923 it moved to Turin and in 1925 was taken over by Fiat, whereby car manufacture ceased but commercial and military vehicle production continued. Although car production resumed after World War II, by 1947 the company was fully absorbed into Fiat.

==Ceirano family background==

The Ceirano brothers, Giovanni Battista, Giovanni, Ernesto and Matteo, were influential in the founding of the Italian auto industry, being variously responsible for : Ceirano; Welleyes (the technical basis of F.I.A.T.); Fratelli Ceirano; S.T.A.R./Rapid (Società Torinese Automobili Rapid); SCAT (Società Ceirano Automobili Torino); Itala and S.P.A. (Società Piemontese Automobili). Giovanni&#x27;s son Giovanni &quot;Ernesto&quot; was also influential, co-founding Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA).

In 1888, after eight years apprenticeship at his father&#x27;s watch-making business, Giovanni Battista started building &quot;Welleyes&quot; bicycles, so named because English names had more sales appeal. In October 1898 Giovanni Battista and Matteo co-founded Ceirano GB &amp; C and started producing the &quot;Welleyes&quot; motor car in 1899. In July 1899 the plant and patents were sold to Giovanni Agnelli and produced as the first F.I.A.T.s - the Fiat 4 HP. Giovanni Battista was employed by Fiat as the agent for Italy, but within a year he left to found Fratelli Ceirano &amp; C. which in 1903 became Società Torinese Automobili Rapid (S.T.A.R.) building cars badged as &#x27;Rapid&#x27;. In 1904 Matteo Ceirano left Ceirano GB &amp; C to create his own brand - Itala. In 1906 Matteo left Itala to found S.P.A. (Società Piemontese Automobili) with chief designer, Alberto Ballacco. In 1906 Giovanni founded SCAT (Società Ceirano Automobili Torino) in Turin. In 1919 Giovanni and Giovanni &quot;Ernesto&quot; co-founded Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili (aka Giovanni Ceirano Fabbrica Automobili) and in 1922 they took control of Fabrica Anonima Torinese Automobili (FATA).

==History==
The company was established in 1906 by Matteo Ceirano and Michele Ansaldi (founder of Ansaldi automobiles) in Turin under the name of Società Piemontese Automobili. The chief designer was Alberto Ballacco.

In 1908, the company merged with Fabbrica Ligure Automobili Genova (FLAG) and the new company became Società Ligure Piemontese Automobili. The headquarters was in Genoa while production continued in Turin.

During World War I the company produced aero engines such as the 6A. Shortly afterwards, in 1916, both Ceirano and Ansaldi left.

In 1923 the company moved to Turin. Severe financial problems lead to a take-over by Fiat in 1925 and the discontinuation of car manufacture in favor of commercial and military vehicles.

After World War II they resumed car production, but, in 1947, the company was fully absorbed into Fiat.

==Cars==

The first S.P.A.s designed by Alberto Ballacco and Ceirano were the &quot;28/40HP&quot; and &quot;60/70 HP&quot; which had four cylinder engines, side valves and live rear axles. They were exhibited at the &quot;Esposizione di Torino&quot;.

By 1907 they also produced two six-cylinder models, one of which had the flywheel mounted at the front of the crankshaft.

By 1911 they had introduced &quot;L-head&quot; monobloc engine designs, unitary gearboxes, and High tension magneto ignition systems. The next year they sold 500 cars and introduced a new four cylinder 14/16 hp engine as the basis of their modern, compact car.

By 1914 the range included twin, four and six cylinder cars - the biggest had an 11,536cc displacement.

After World War I production resumed with the pre-war models; the &quot;14/16 HP&quot; using a 2.700cc side-valve engine and the &quot;&#x27;25/30 HP&quot; using a 4,400cc six cylinder engine.

In 1922 the highly sophisticated 30/40 Super Sports was launched, with a 4,400cc six cylinder engine, using twin overhead camshafts (dohc) operating four valves per cylinder. The aluminium alloy cylinders had steel liners and aluminium pistons, plus dual carburettors and dual-ignition. The car was also equipped with front-wheel brakes and a V-shaped radiator. By the next year, the sporting range was marketed as &quot;Tipo 23&quot;, &quot;Tipo 24&quot; and &quot;Tipo 25&quot;.

==Racing==

In 1908 Ernesto Ceirano finished third in the Targa Florio driving a four-cylinder, 7,785cc, S.P.A. 28/40 HP.

In 1909 an S.P.A. racer driven by Francesco Ciuppa won the Targa Florio race. Completing a single lap of the 148km &quot;Grande Circuit&quot; in 2 hours 43 minutes 19 seconds at an average speed of 54.67 km/h.

<doc id="863532" wikidata="Q2344897" url="?curid=863532" title="Extreme points of Europe">
<text>This is a list of the extreme points of Europe: the geographical points that are higher or farther north, south, east or west than any other location in Europe. Some of these positions are open to debate, as the definition of Europe is diverse.

==Extremes of the European continent, including islands==

*Northernmost point. Cape Fligely, Rudolf Island, Franz Josef Land, Russia (81° 48′ 24″ N). Franz Josef Land is near the ill-defined border between Europe and Asia; if it is not considered a part of Europe, then the northernmost point is on the island of Rossøya, Svalbard, Norway (81°N).

*Southernmost point. Cape Trypiti, Gavdos Island, Greece (34° 48′ 02″ N) is the least ambiguous southernmost point of Europe. However, there are other contenders, depending on definition. The island of Cyprus, although geographically in Asia, has cultural links with Europe and it is also part of European Union; Cyprus&#x27;s southernmost point is the British base at Akrotiri (34°35′N). The Portuguese islands of Madeira are borderline between Europe and Africa; their southernmost point is at Bugio Island, at (32°24′14″N). La Restinga on the island of El Hierro (27°45′N) in the Spanish Canary Islands is yet further south and could be considered politically, though not physiographically as part of Europe.
*Westernmost point. Monchique Islet, Azores Islands, Portugal (31° 16′ 30″ W) (If considered part of Europe, though it sits on the North American Plate). If not, then the Capelinhos Volcano, Faial Island, Azores Islands, Portugal (28° 50′ 00″ W), the westernmost point of the Eurasian Plate above sea level. Bjargtangar (24° 31′ 55″ W) is Iceland´s Westernmost point and thus furthest west of a European country outside Greenland (which belongs to Denmark). The westernmost part of Greenland is the Carey Islands group at 72°50&#x27;W.
*Easternmost point. Cape Flissingsky (69° 02′ E), Severny Island, Novaya Zemlya, Russia.

==Mainland Europe==
*Northernmost point. Cape Nordkinn (Kinnarodden), Norway (71°08′02″N 27°39′00″E)
*Southernmost point. Punta de Tarifa, Spain (36°00&#x27;00.2&quot;N). This is the southernmost point of a small island connected to the coast by a causeway in 1808, so no longer an island. If manmade land is not accepted, the continental southernmost point is located slightly more to the North at 36°00&#x27;25&quot;N.
*Westernmost point. Cabo da Roca, Portugal (9°29&#x27;56.44 W).
*Easternmost point. The easternmost point is dependent upon the various definitions of Europe&#x27;s eastern border. Utilizing the most common definition of Europe&#x27;s eastern edge (the watershed divide of the Ural Mountains), the easternmost point of the Ural watershed (and thus mainland Europe) lies on an unnamed peak at as shown on various detailed maps such as the Soviet General Staff maps and as shown on Google Earth/Maps. This peak is northeast of an peak named Gora Anoraga and southwest of Ostrov Lediyev (island) on Arctic waters south of the Kara Sea.

==Elevation==
*Highest point. The highest point is dependent upon the definition of Europe:
**The Caucasus Mountains watershed divide is the most common definition for the European/Asian border. This places the highest point at Mount Elbrus, Russia (5,642 metres; 18,506 feet), which is onto the European side of the Caucasus watershed divide.
**If the Caucasus mountains are excluded, the highest point is Mont Blanc, on the border between France and Italy (4,810 metres; 15,781 feet).
*Lowest point (natural, with open sky). Caspian Sea shore, Russia (28 metres; 92 feet below sea level).
*Lowest point (natural, under water). Calypso Deep, Ionian Sea, Greece (5,267 metres; 17,280 feet below sea level).
*Lowest point (natural, underground). Dependent upon the definition of Europe: either Krubera Cave, Abkhazia, Georgia (2196 metres; 7205 feet below surface) (also the deepest cave in the world) or Lamprechtsofen, Austria (1,632 metres; 5,354 feet below surface).
*Lowest point (artificial, with open sky). Hambach surface mine (open-pit mine), Germany (293 metres; 961 feet below sea level).
*Lowest point (artificial, underground). Kola Superdeep Borehole, Russia (12,262 metres; 40,230 feet below surface). Also the deepest artificial point on Earth.

===Highest attainable by transportation===
*Cable car (and lift) – Klein Matterhorn, Switzerland (3,883 metres; 12,736 feet)
*Teide Cableway – Teide volcano, Spain (3,555 metres; 11,663 feet)

*Train (dead end) – Jungfraujoch, Switzerland (3,454 metres; 11,330 feet)
*Train (mountain pass) – Bernina Pass, Switzerland (2,253 metres; 7390 feet)
*Restricted access paved road (dead end) – Veleta (Sierra Nevada), Spain (3,300 metres; 10,827 feet)
*Paved road (dead end) – Ötztal Glacier Road, Austria (2,830 metres; 9,285 feet)
*Paved road (mountain pass) – Col de l&#x27;Iseran, France (2,770 metres; 9,090 feet)

===Lowest attainable by transportation===
*Lowest public tunnel – Ryfast Tunnel, Norway ( below sea level)

==Extreme points attainable by train==
===Extreme station of the European continent, including islands===
*Northernmost station: Terminal station: unclear which is in service: Pechenga (railway station), Murmansk Oblast, Murmansk Oblast, Russia ( from Cape Nordkinn)

<text>The Adirondack is a daily intercity passenger train operated by Amtrak between New York City and Montreal. The scenic route follows the Empire Corridor through the Hudson Valley with major stops in Yonkers, Poughkeepsie, Albany–Rensselaer, and Schenectady. North of Saratoga Springs the route runs between the Adirondack Mountains and Lake Champlain until crossing the Canada–U.S. border at Rouses Point. Trains take approximately 11 hours to travel the route.

Canadian track maintenance issues led to the suspension of the &quot;Adirondack&quot; from June to September in 2023 and 2024.

Operation of the &quot;Adirondack&quot; is supported by the New York State Department of Transportation and Via Rail. Amtrak reported that &quot;Adirondack&quot; served 26,892 passengers in fiscal year 2023, down from pre-COVID-19 pandemic ridership of 117,490 in FY2019.

== History ==

At the inception of Amtrak on May 1, 1971, the Delaware and Hudson Railway (D&amp;H) operated two trains between Albany, New York and Montreal: the &quot;Montreal Limited&quot; (overnight) and the &quot;Laurentian&quot; (day). Both trains were discontinued, and for three years the D&amp;H main line saw no service. Amtrak service to Montreal began in 1972 with the &quot;Montrealer&quot;, which ran through Vermont rather than New York.

The &quot;Adirondack&quot; began running on August 6, 1974 (with a ceremonial train the previous day) from Grand Central Terminal in New York to Albany, then over the D&amp;H&#x27;s line to Windsor Station in Montreal. From the outset the train operated with financial support from the state of New York. The train initially operated as a section of the New York–Buffalo &quot;Empire State Express&quot;.

Initially, the &quot;Adirondack&quot; used the same routing as its D&amp;H predecessors, running over the former Rensselaer and Saratoga Railroad via Watervliet and Mechanicville, New York, and over the Schenectady–Mechanicville freight bypass to Saratoga. With the April 30, 1978, timetable change, the &quot;Adirondack&quot; dropped both stops but continued to use the route. The train was re-routed via Schenectady on October 29, 1978, but did not start stopping there until January 29, 1979. Both termini have shifted since service began. In Montreal, the &quot;Adirondack&quot; moved to the Canadian National Railway&#x27;s Central Station on January 12, 1986. In New York City, the opening of the Empire Connection on April 8, 1991, allowed the &quot;Adirondack&quot; to serve Penn Station instead of Grand Central.

===21st century===
As part of an effort to improve on-time performance along the Empire Corridor, Amtrak reached an agreement with CSX to lease the CSX Hudson Subdivision between Poughkeepsie and Schenectady. Starting in 2012, Amtrak effectively took operational control of the Hudson Subdivision, handling all maintenance and capital responsibilities. Even with this move, Amtrak still operates less than half of the trackage along the &quot;Adirondack&quot; route.

In 2012, U.S. Customs and Border Protection began planning a preclearance facility at Montreal Central Station, which would allow departing passengers to be prescreened in Montreal, where northbound passengers would be processed by the Canada Border Services Agency upon arrival, rather than at the border itself. Presently, the &quot;Adirondack&quot; must stop at Lacolle, Quebec northbound and Rouses Point, New York southbound for immigration procedures that can take up to two hours. By early 2017, the United States Congress had passed its necessary enabling legislation. The corresponding Canadian legislation was given royal assent in late 2017 and came into force in 2019.

All trains using the Empire Connection, excluding the &quot;Lake Shore Limited&quot;, operated into Grand Central Terminal from May 26 to September 4, 2018, to allow work on the Empire Tunnel, the Spuyten Duyvil movable bridge, and Penn Station. For most of the summer of 2019, the northbound &quot;Adirondack&quot; ran combined with the northbound &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; due to infrastructure work at Penn Station, splitting in Albany. The two trains ran separately on weekends during July and August.

===COVID-19 pandemic and track issues===
In March 2020, the &quot;Adirondack&quot; was truncated to Albany–Rensselaer after all non-essential travel across the Canada–United States border was banned in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In July 2021, that truncated service was replaced by the resumption of &quot;Ethan Allen Express&quot; service, which overlaps the &quot;Adirondack&quot; between New York City and . Weekday service from New York City to Albany resumed on December 5, 2022. Full service resumption to Montreal took place on April 3, 2023; the Port Kent stop remained closed, as service on the Port Kent-Burlington Ferry remained suspended indefinitely.

The Canadian National Railway (CN) owns the Rouses Point Subdivision, a section of track that runs from Rouses Point, New York, to the vicinity of Montreal. During the COVID-19 suspension track conditions &quot;deteriorat[ed]&quot;, forcing Amtrak to lengthen an already long running time between Rouses Point and Montreal. Citing a concern over heat kinks, CN imposed a speed restriction when temperatures exceeded , leading to one trip over in mid-June taking four hours. On June 26, Amtrak suspended service &quot;until further notice&quot; north of Albany over the track conditions. Amtrak criticized &quot;inconsistent application of CN&#x27;s historical heat order policy&quot;; CN claimed that Amtrak had failed to pay for maintenance to the track, which Amtrak disputed. &quot;Adirondack&quot; service was extended to on July 24, 2023, to serve the Saratoga Race Course meet. Trains were turned using a CP wye near Saratoga Springs. Montreal service resumed on September 11. 

The &quot;Adirondack&quot; was again suspended north of Saratoga Springs on May 20, 2024, due to unspecified track work. On May 17, 2024, Amtrak and CN announced an agreement under which Amtrak would pay CN to perform track work on the line, which would &quot;mitigate, but not eliminate&quot;, heat-related slow orders. The suspension was originally intended to end on June 29; however, in early June it was extended to mid-September. Service resumed on September 9 with track work not completed. The &quot;Adirondack&quot; and were combined between New York and Albany–Rensselaer beginning November 10, 2024, due to construction work in the East River Tunnels limiting capacity at Penn Station. This was reversed effective December 2, 2024, through at least March 2025.

== Operation ==
=== Equipment ===

Most &quot;Adirondack&quot; trains consist of five to seven cars hauled by a locomotive.

The passenger cars are the Amfleet series built by the Budd Company in the mid-1970s to early-1980s. Most trains include a Café car (food service/lounge) and four to six Coach Class cars. Unlike other Empire Corridor trains, the &quot;Adirondack&quot; does not offer business class seating.

All cars offer complimentary WiFi, an electric outlet (120 V, 60 Hz AC) at each seat, reading lamps, and fold-out tray tables. Passengers self-select seats on a first-come, first-served basis. Reservations are required on all trains; tickets may be purchased online, from an agent at some stations, a ticketing machine at most stations, or, at a higher cost, from the conductor on the train.

Between New York City and Albany–Rensselaer, trains are pulled by a GE Genesis P32AC-DM dual-mode diesel locomotive at speeds up to . The locomotives operate on third rail electric power in Penn Station and the Empire Connection tunnel and on diesel power for the rest of the route. Between Albany–Rensselaer and Montréal, traditional diesel-only GE Genesis locomotives are used.

The &quot;Adirondack&quot; debuted in 1974 with D&amp;H equipment, much of it from the &quot;Laurentian&quot;, as Amtrak was experiencing equipment shortages. These were supplemented by a pair of Skyline dome cars leased from the Canadian Pacific Railway. Two D&amp;H ALCO PA diesel locomotives hauled each train. On March 1, 1977, new Turboliner gas turbine trainsets took over from the D&amp;H cars. Conventional Amtrak equipment would eventually displace the Turboliners.

In the coming years all equipment will be replaced with Amtrak Airo trainsets, the railroad&#x27;s branding of its combination of Siemens Venture passenger cars and a Siemens Charger diesel-electric locomotive. The trainsets for the &quot;Adirondack&quot; will have six passenger cars, which will include a cab control car, a food service area, and a mix of 2x2 Coach Class and 2x1 Business Class seating. The car closest to the locomotive will have batteries to supply electricity to traction motors in the locomotive when operating in Penn Station and the Empire Connection tunnel, eliminating the need for third rail propulsion. The arrangement will eliminate the time-consuming locomotive change at Albany–Rensselaer.

=== Route ===

<text>Joseph McMinn (June 22, 1758 – October 17, 1824) was an American politician who served as the fourth Governor of Tennessee from 1815 to 1821. A veteran of the American Revolution, he had previously served in the legislature of the Southwest Territory (1794–1796), and as Speaker of the Tennessee Senate (1805–1811). He was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party.

Following his term as governor, he served as an agent to the Cherokee for the United States government.

==Early life==
McMinn was born in West Marlborough Township, Pennsylvania, and was one of ten children. He obtained only a limited rural education, and even in his later years would be described as a &quot;rustic frontiersman.&quot; Though raised as a Quaker, he joined the Continental Army during the American Revolution.

In 1786, McMinn moved to Hawkins County, Tennessee, where he had purchased a farm. In 1792, Southwest Territory governor William Blount appointed McMinn justice of the peace for Hawkins County, and McMinn represented Hawkins County in the territorial legislature from 1794 to 1796. He also served as an officer in the territorial militia, eventually rising to the rank of brigade commander.

==Career==
McMinn was a delegate to the 1796 constitutional convention and helped write the state constitution that came into effect when Tennessee was admitted to the Union on June 1, 1796. He was chosen to deliver a copy of the completed document to the federal government in Philadelphia. He served in the Tennessee Senate from 1797 to 1801, and from 1803 to 1811, and was Speaker of the Senate from 1805 to 1811.

In 1815, McMinn ran for governor against four other prominent state politicians: Senator Jesse Wharton, Congressman Robert Weakley, former speaker of the state house Robert Foster, and fellow state constitutional convention delegate Thomas Henderson. Though his opponents assailed him in the press, McMinn won the election with a plurality of over 15,000 of the 37,000 votes cast. He was reelected in 1817, again defeating Foster, and elected to a third term in 1819, defeating Enoch Parsons.

While governor, McMinn concentrated on peaceful relationships with Native Americans in order to ease the way for more white settlement, particularly to the west. The Chickasaw Purchase Treaty, or Western Purchase, in which most of what is now West Tennessee was acquired, was accomplished during his tenure as governor. Fourteen new counties were created. The Calhoun Treaty (or Hiwassee Purchase), in which the United States acquired a portion of southeastern Tennessee, was also negotiated during his tenure.

Following the Panic of 1819, McMinn called a joint session of the state legislature in June 1820, which voted to establish a state bank that would provide low-interest loans. This agitated many of McMinn&#x27;s fellow East Tennesseans, who had for years been complaining about lack of state appropriations for internal improvements, namely navigational improvements on the upper Tennessee River. The legislature used state-owned lands from the Hiwassee Purchase to provide financial backing for the new bank.

Upon his retirement as governor due to the term limits in the 1796 constitution that he had helped to draft, he returned to his farm in Hawkins County. In 1823, he moved to a farm along the Hiwassee River near Calhoun, Tennessee, and served as an agent for the federal government at the nearby Cherokee Agency until the time of his death.

==Family life and legacy==
McMinn married his first wife, Anna Cooper, in 1785, and they had one daughter, Jane. Following the death of his first wife in 1811, McMinn married Rebecca Kincade the next year. She died in January 1815, and his only child, Jane, died two weeks later.

In 1816, he married Nancy Glasgow Williams, the daughter of disgraced North Carolina Secretary of State James Glasgow, formerly married to Willoughby Williams, a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives. This marriage ended in a controversial separation and a failed attempt at divorce in 1821.

In 1942, a portrait of McMinn that had been painted by noted artist Rembrandt Peale in 1796 was discovered in Philadelphia. McMinn apparently posed for the portrait during his visit to the city to deliver the newly written Tennessee state constitution to the federal government. The Tennessee Historical Society purchased the painting for the state.

McMinn County, Tennessee, and the town of McMinnville, Tennessee, in Warren County, are named in Joseph McMinn&#x27;s honor. William T. Newby, the founder of McMinnville, Oregon, named the city after his hometown of McMinnville, Tennessee.

McMinn joined the Presbyterian Church late in life, and was buried in an unmarked grave at the Shiloh Presbyterian Cemetery in Calhoun. In 1880, his namesake McMinn County attempted to have his grave reinterred in its county seat of Athens, but an eccentric preacher named R. J. M. Only, who was the only person who knew the grave&#x27;s location, refused to reveal the location. After the county agreed not to move the grave, Only revealed the location, and a large marker was placed upon it.

<doc id="863553" wikidata="Q1653074" url="?curid=863553" title="IBM 5250">
<text>IBM 5250 is a family of block-oriented terminals originally introduced with the IBM System/34 midrange computer systems in 1977. It also connects to the later System/36, System/38, and IBM AS/400 systems, and to IBM Power Systems systems running IBM i, as well as the Series/1 minicomputer.

==Components==
5250 devices can be directly attached to the host or communicate remotely using Synchronous Data Link Control (SDLC) at up to 9600bit/s. Devices can also be clustered or daisy-chained.

In 1980 the 5250 system consisted of the following components:
* 5251 Display Station. The monochrome text-only display can be either 960 characters, formatted as 12 lines of 80 characters, or 1920 characters as 24 lines of 80 characters. Upper and lower case is standard. Text attributes consist of blink, high intensity, reverse video, non-display, underscore, and a unique &quot;column separator&quot; that causes the field to be preceded and followed by a vertical bar. 5251 and 5252 input &quot;format control&quot; attributes are optimized for data entry applications and offer significant enhancements over previous 3270 terminals.
* 5252 Dual Display Station. The 5252 features a single CRT displayed 12 lines each on two different sides back to back in a single case, with separate keyboards. The 5252 was not part of the initial announcement.
* 5256 printer. The 5256 is a tabletop serial dot matrix printer with three models providing speeds of 40, 60, or 120cps and a print line of 132 characters.

===5251/5252 format control===

Field attributes also define the type of data the operator can enter into a field, and specify other control information for the field.
* A field can be defined as alpha only, numeric only, or alphanumeric.
*&quot;Auto enter&quot; simulates an &quot;ENTER&quot; key press at the conclusion of the field.
*&quot;Bypass&quot; automatically skips over a field in the screen.
*&quot;Duplicate enable&quot; allows the operator to press the &quot;DUP&quot; key in a field, entering a special code which is interpreted by the application program – typically duplicating data in this field from the previous record or line.
*&quot;Field exit required&quot; forces the operator to manually exit this field, rather than automatically advancing to the next field after entering the last character.
*&quot;Mandatory entry&quot; specifies that the operator must enter data in this field and is not allowed to tab over it.
*&quot;Monocase&quot; translates lower-case characters entered into this field to upper-case.
*&quot;Mandatory fill&quot; specifies that this field must be entirely filled if any data is entered into it.
*&quot;Right adjust&quot; will right adjust data entered in a field when the operator exits the field.
*&quot;Signed numeric&quot; reserves the rightmost position of a field for a sign – blank for positive or &#x27;-&#x27; for negative.

===Terminal status lights===

On a 5251 type terminal featured five status lights on the front of the unit:

* &quot;System Available light&quot;: If lit, this terminal is connected to the host system and is receiving information from it.

* &quot;Message Waiting light&quot;: Other users, and the system itself, can send messages to workstations. If lit, there is at least one message that has not been seen yet. When a program ends or when the user signs on, the message(s) will be shown.

* &quot;Insert light&quot;: The Insert key has been pressed. Characters after the cursor will shift right when text is keyed. Press Insert again to cease Insert Mode.

* &quot;Caps Lock light&quot;: The Caps Lock key has been pressed.

* &quot;Keyboard Shift light&quot;: The Shift key is being pressed.

==Historical origins==
The 5250 is a block-oriented terminal similar to, but not compatible with, the IBM 3270. Robustly constructed, 5251 terminals weigh roughly . The devices generate an audible clicking sound as the user types, similar to the electronic typewriters of the era.

The 5250 data stream definition has been refined over time to include GUI elements such as pop-up windowing, check and option boxes, mouse handling, and pull-down menus. The IBM 3180 added support for seven colors - pink, red, blue, yellow, green, white, and turquoise. A protocol called the IBM 5250 Data Stream interpreted field attributes such as blinking, non-display, high intensity, reverse image, underline, and column separators and was used in combination to create colors. Normal text was presented as green on a 3180 color terminal, but high intensity became white. Column separators became yellow. Blinking became red. Underlined text was presented as blue. High intensity blinking became pink. High intensity column separators became turquoise.

The term &quot;5250&quot; now refers to the data stream itself. No physical 5250 terminals with their bulky twinax cables still exist, although they were occasionally still used to provide a &quot;connection of last resort,&quot; hard-wired to the host computer. Today, it is more common to use PC or web-based terminal emulation packages that can interpret and display 5250 data streams.

==Telnet 5250==
Telnet 5250, or TN5250 describes either the process of sending and receiving 5250 data streams using the telnet protocol or the software that emulates a 5250 class terminal communication via that process. TN5250 allows a 5250 terminal emulator to communicate over a TCP/IP network instead of an SNA network. Standard telnet clients cannot be used as a substitute for TN5250 clients, as they use a different data stream format.

==Interfacing 5250 terminals with commodity hardware==
An interface was created to connect to the Twinax port of a 5250 terminal and communicate with it like an AS/400 host. It currently provides VT52 emulation and a shell on the system to which the adapter is connected.

<text>The Vishnu Sahasranama () is a Sanskrit hymn containing a list of the 1,000 names of Vishnu, one of the main deities in Hinduism and the Supreme God in Vaishnavism. It is one of the most sacred and popular stotras in Hinduism. The most popular version of the &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; is featured in the Anushasana Parva of the epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. Other versions exist in the &quot;Padma Purana&quot;, the &quot;Skanda Purana&quot;, and the &quot;Garuda Purana&quot;. There is also a Sikh version of the &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; found in the work &quot;Sundar Gutka&quot;.

==Etymology==
In Sanskrit, means &#x27;thousand&#x27;. The meaning of sahasra is context-dependent. (nominative, the stem is ) means &#x27;name&#x27;. The compound is of the Bahuvrihi type and may be translated as &#x27;having a thousand names&#x27;. In modern Hindi pronunciation, &quot;nāma&quot; is pronounced [na:m]. It is also pronounced in South Indian languages.

The phalashruti (meritorious verse) of the hymn says that one who reads the text every day with full devotion achieves name, fame, wealth and knowledge in his life.

==Interpretations==
The &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; is popular among Hindus, and a major part of prayer for devout Vaishnavas, or followers of Vishnu. While &quot;Vaishanvas&quot; venerate other deities, they believe that the universe, including the other divinities such as Shiva and Devi, are ultimately a manifestation of the Supreme Vishnu. Despite the existence of sahasranamas of other gods, referring a sahasranama as &quot;The Sahasranama,&quot; generally refers to the &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; alone, thereby indicating its wide popularity and use.

The names in &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; that refer to Shiva are &quot;Shiva&quot; (names # 27 and # 600 in Advaitin Adi Shankara&#x27;s commentary) itself, &quot;Shambhu&quot; (name # 38), &quot;Ishanah&quot; (name #6 4), and &quot;Rudra&quot; (name # 114). Adi Sankara of Advaita Vedanta asserts that the deity Vishnu is Brahman itself (not just an aspect of Brahman). Again, he notes that &quot;only Hari (Vishnu) is eulogized by names such as &quot;Shiva&quot;&quot;, a position consistent with interpretations of the Srivaishnavite commentator Parasara Bhattar. Parasara Bhattar had interpreted Shiva to mean a quality of Vishnu, such as &quot;One who bestows auspiciousness&quot;.

However, this interpretation of the name Shiva has been challenged by Swami Tapasyananda&#x27;s translation of Shankara&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot;. He translates the 27th name, Shiva to mean:&quot;One who is not affected by the three Gunas of Prakrti, Sattva, Rajas,and Tamas; The &quot;Kaivalaya Upanishad&quot; says, &quot;He is both Brahma and Shiva.&quot; In the light of this statement of non-difference between Shiva and Vishnu, it is Vishnu Himself Who Is exalted by the praise and worship of Shiva.&quot; Based on this commonly held Advaitan point of view which has been adopted by Smartas, Vishnu and Shiva are viewed as one and the same God, being different aspects of preservation and destruction respectively. As many Sanskrit words have multiple meanings, it is possible that both Vishnu and Shiva share names in this instance, e.g., the name Shiva itself means &quot;auspicious&quot; which could also apply to Vishnu. The Deities Ananthapadmanabha and Shankaranarayana are worshipped by Hindus, as is Panduranga Vitthala, a form of Krishna with a Shiva Linga on his crown, signifying the oneness of both deities.

In other Vaishnava traditions too, the &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; is considered an important text. Within Gaudiya Vaishnavism, Vallabha sampradaya, Nimbarka sampradaya and among Ramanandis, the chanting of the names of Krishna and Rama are considered to be superior to that of Vishnu. Based on another verse in the Padma Purana which says that the benefit of chanting the one thousand names of Vishnu can be derived from chanting one name of Rama, and a verse in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana equating the benefit of chanting three names of Rama with one name of Krishna. However, it is important to realize that those verses in those puranas are not to be interpreted literally, as many believe that there is no difference between Vishnu and Krishna and Rama. This theological difference can be expressed as follows: Many Vaishnava groups recognize Krishna and Rama as an Avatar of Vishnu, while others, instead, consider Him (Krishna) to be svayam bhagavan, or the original form of the Lord. Yet these verses can be interpreted as it is more important to have pure bhakti or devotion than merely repeating the many names of God without emotion. Indeed, Shri Krishna Himself said, &quot;Arjuna, One may be desirous of praising by reciting the thousand names. But, on my part, I feel praised by one shloka. There is no doubt about it.” 

;Interpretations alluding to the power of God in controlling karma

Many names in the Vishnusahasranama, the thousand names of Vishnu allude to the power of God in controlling karma. For example, the 135th name of Vishnu, Dharmadhyaksha, in Sankara&#x27;s interpretation means, &quot;One who directly sees the merits (Dharma) and demerits (Adharma), of beings by bestowing their due rewards on them.&quot;

Other names of Vishnu alluding to this nature of God are Bhavanah, the 32nd name, Vidhata, the 44th name, Apramattah, the 325th name, Sthanadah, the 387th name and Srivibhavanah, the 609th name. Bhavanah, according to Sankara&#x27;s interpretation, means &quot;One who generates the fruits of Karmas of all Jivas for them to enjoy.&quot; The Brahma Sutra (3.2.28) &quot;Phalmatah upapatteh&quot; speaks of the Lord&#x27;s function as the bestower of the fruits of all actions of the jivas.

;General thoughts

Sections from Swami Tapasyananda&#x27;s translation of the concluding verses of &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot;, state the following: &quot;Nothing &quot;evil or inauspicious&quot; will befall a man here or &quot;hereafter&quot; who daily hears or repeats these names.&quot; That comment is noteworthy. King Nahusha, a once righteous king, ancestor of Yudhishthira, after performing a hundred Ashwamedha sacrifices, became king of devas, but was later expelled from Svarga or heaven due to a curse by the great sage Agastya due to his pride and arrogance and became a python for thousands of years. In the commentary to this sloka Sankara states that a fall akin to that of king Nahusha will not happen to that devotee who recites &quot;Vishnu Sahasranama&quot; daily.

==Commentaries==

<text>MEI Conlux (formerly known as Mars Electronics International) is a manufacturer of electronic banknote validators, coin acceptors and changers. MEI was spun off to private investment interests in July 2006. In December 2012, it was sold to Crane Co., which also manufactures vending machines. A new division was created inside the company by merging former CPS (Crane Payment Solutions) and MEI into CPI (Crane Payment Innovations).

The firm began operations in Great Britain in 1965 and expanded to the United States in 1967. The firm invented the electronic vending machine and is one of the largest manufacturers of vending machines in the world. As of 2011, the company operated in over one hundred countries and processed over two billion transactions per week.

It has had a co-educational relationship with the Mechanical Engineering department of the Imperial College, London.

In 1996, the firm signed a deal with DigiCash, one of the first digital currencies. This led to the widespread integration of smart card technology in vending machines.

Since 2000, the company has been the sole manufacturer of bill handling units (a form of automated cash handling) for the Federal Transit Administration.

<doc id="863568" wikidata="Q7318849" url="?curid=863568" title="Revolutionary Socialist League (U.S.)">
<text>The Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL) was a Trotskyist group in the United States established in 1973 and disbanded in 1989.

==History==
The RSL originated in the Revolutionary Tendency within the International Socialists (U.S.) (IS) led by Sy Landy and Ron Tabor. They had three principal differences with the IS: they believed that the IS had abandoned strict adherence to Trotskyism; they felt that the emphasis on the day-to-day work within the trade unions diminished propagating the revolutionary objectives outlined in the Fourth International&#x27;s transitional program; and they felt that the USSR and the other Communist states were state capitalist, rather than bureaucratic collectivist.

While the RT at first seemed to have the upper hand, with Landy elected national secretary in 1972, by the next year Landy and his faction had been expelled. At the time of the split, the RSL took 100 of the IS&#x27;s 300 members. The expelled group, now styling itself the Revolutionary Socialist League, adopted generally orthodox Trotskyist positions based on the transitional program including permanent revolution, opposition to popular fronts and the need for a Fourth International. This last position cost them unity with the Class Struggle League, who advocated a Fifth International. Landy wrote &quot;To preserve the program is to preserve the number and out right to it&quot;. Despite this the RSL never joined any existing Trotskyist international or attempted to organize a new one. Its sole international organizational tie was with the Revolutionary Marxist League of Jamaica.

The RSL was active within a few unions, particularly United Auto Workers (UAW) and USW and among Hispanic workers in the Los Angeles ILGWU. Within the UAW they organized a &quot;Revolutionary Action Caucus&quot;. Outside of organized labor they participated in anti-apartheid and anti-racist movements and developed a prisoner support network.

The RSL was one of the left groups most active in the pre-AIDS gay movement. Rick Miles considered this area &quot;particularly important&quot; because he believed that much of the left suffered from the same homophobia as the rest of society, and because the &quot;gay question&quot; had a direct bearing on their concept of socialism as a &quot;free society&quot; run directly by workers and oppressed people, rather than an authoritarian society run by a state capitalist class. It also emphasized the oppressive nature of the Stalinist countries where homosexuals were repressed. The RSL recruited a minority tendency of the Red Flag Union, a gay socialist collective, to its state capitalist characterization, and they merged into the League in 1977. (A majority of the RFU joined the Spartacist League.) In New York, the RSL was active in the Gay Activists Alliance, its members and sympathizers participating in a polarizing split that proved the end of that organization. RSL members also participated in gay coalitions such as Lavender Left and Christopher Street Liberation Day Committee.

The RSL had its share of organizational difficulties. In early 1974, it suffered its first split. The origins of this split went back to a group called the Communist faction within the Socialist Workers Party that left to SWP to enter IS, and subsequently the RSL. Within the RSL it formed the &quot;Soviet Defensist Minority&quot; before leaving to form the Trotskyist Organization of the United States. Another tendency had left in 1975 to form the Revolutionary Marxist Caucus, which later fused with the Socialist Workers Party. Finally a group led by Sy Landy left in 1976 to form the League for the Revolutionary Party, in part because they disagreed with the RSL&#x27;s call for the formation of a Labor Party in the US. They also alleged that the leadership of the RSL was acting in a bureaucratic fashion.

Over time, the RSL moved closer to anarchism. In 1985 they released a statement &quot;What we stand for&quot; that proclaimed their adherence to the ideas of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Trotsky but emphasized the theoretical contributions of Marx and Engels, Trotsky&#x27;s fight against Stalinism and Lenin&#x27;s &quot;conception of the party, stress on the importance of national liberation struggles and the anti-statism shown in the &quot;State and Revolution&quot;&quot;. It also identified &quot;with the best of anarchism, particularly its libertarian spirit&quot;. Their move away from Leninism is documented in a book by RSL leader Ron Tabor titled &quot;A Look at Leninism&quot; (), which collected together a series of articles questioning the fundamentals of Leninism that had appeared as a serial series in &quot;The Torch&quot; newspaper.

The RSL disbanded in 1989, with about twenty of its remaining members helping in the formation of Love and Rage Network, a revolutionary anarchist newspaper and organization. The RSL met to disband the day before the founding conference of Love and Rage. When Love and Rage disbanded in 1998, the remaining former RSL members, including Ron Tabor, began publishing &quot;The Utopian&quot;. Some time later they entered the platformist anarchist federation North Eastern Federation of Anarchist Communists.

== League for the Revolutionary Party ==
The League for the Revolutionary Party is a Trotskyist organisation in the United States.

The group was founded by a faction of the now defunct Revolutionary Socialist League in 1976. The RSL had in turn split from the International Socialists in 1973.

The LRP took from the RSL a strong stress on the need for a Leninist party and coupled this with an emphasis on the general strike tactic. They also developed their own version of what is called &quot;state capitalist theory&quot; to explain the class nature of the USSR and similar states. In later years they abandoned use of the term &quot;state capitalist&quot; in favor of the term &quot;statified capitalism, arguing the difference between Stalinist and traditional capitalist countries is in the form that the ruling class holds its property, and that the proletariat is still exploited and surplus value created in the same way. The LRP views the state in Stalinist countries as a weaker form of the capitalist state, less capable of exploiting the workers but still ruling in the interest of the bureaucracy. This form of state is seen as a compromise by the ruling class, sacrificing a portion of profits to pacify the workers and prevent proletarian revolutions. As such, the LRP viewed the collapse of the Soviet Union as a defeat for the workers not because the workers lost control of the state, as many Trotskyists believe, but because of the increased rate of exploitation and destruction of social welfare programs that accompanied the collapse.

The group is based in New York City with a branch in Chicago. It also organizes a group of international co-thinkers called the Communist Organisation for a Fourth International. They publish a journal called &quot;Proletarian Revolution&quot;, formerly &quot;Socialist Voice&quot;, to which the late Sy Landy and Walter Daum have been notable contributors.

<doc id="863572" wikidata="Q2093056" url="?curid=863572" title="Dodge Stratus">
<text>The Dodge Stratus is a mid-size car that was introduced by Dodge in December 1994 and was based on the 4-door sedan Chrysler JA platform. The Stratus, Plymouth Breeze, and Chrysler Cirrus were all on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1996 and 1997. It received critical acclaim at launch, but ratings fell over time. An updated version of the Stratus was introduced for 2001, with the Cirrus being renamed as the Chrysler Sebring, and a coupé model was also added to the range. Production ended in early 2006 at the Sterling Heights Assembly Plant after building 1,308,123 Stratus and Sebrings since 2000. 

The Dodge Avenger replaced the Stratus nameplate in early 2007 for the 2008 model year.

After the discontinuation of the Stratus sedan in 2006, the assembly line and tooling were sold to the Russian concern, GAZ, which manufactured 9,000 units of a very slightly modified Stratus from 2008 through 2010 called the Volga Siber.


==First generation (1995–2000)==
The Dodge Stratus was the middle entry of the JA platform (with the Cirrus being the higher-end model and the Breeze being the lower-end model). Introduced in 1995, the Stratus had two models, the &quot;base&quot; (later renamed &quot;SE&quot; in 2000), which came standard with the 2.0 L straight-four and had the SOHC 2.4 L as optional, and the &quot;ES&quot;, which came standard with the a 2.0 L from 1995 to 1997, and had a DOHC 2.4 L and a 2.5 L V6 as optional. In 1998 the DOHC 2.4 L was standard and the 2.5 L V6 was optional on the ES, and from 1999 to 2000, the 2.5 L V6 was the only engine on the ES model.

The Stratus directly replaced the high-volume Spirit and Dynasty (United States only) to favorable reviews, but lower sales. The Stratus was often compared to other small mid-sizes such as the Chevrolet Malibu, and judged roomier than the 1995 Ford Contour by many magazines such as &quot;Consumer Reports&quot;.


The Stratus, Cirrus, and Breeze had many parts that were interchangeable between each model. The exteriors of these three cars were very similar, with the front fascia, rear bumper, taillights, and wheels being the main differences. The interiors had little variation between the three models; being almost identical, save for the name on the steering wheel, and a few available options. The fascias of each JA car resembled each brand&#x27;s minivan offering, sharing headlights and grill designs.

All three variants of the platform were available with most of the same standard features and available options, such as the following: a four-speed automatic transmission and an optional semi-automatic dubbed &quot;Autostick&quot; (not available on the Plymouth Breeze), anti-lock brakes, four-wheel independent suspension (double wishbone in the front with a multilink rear), tilt steering wheel, cruise control, power windows, power door locks, power driver&#x27;s seat, leather seats (Cirrus only), power antenna, a six-CD changer, sunroof, remote keyless entry, anti-theft system, etc. A five-speed manual was available with the 2.0 L. The 2.4 L was not offered in a manual because of its high torque and difficult drivability issues, mainly due to wheel spinning.

===International markets===
In 2000, the Stratus was available for its last year of sales in Canada, with the Chrysler Sebring taking over as the company&#x27;s only lower mid-size sedan - Dodge did not sell the equivalent version in Canada.

A turbocharged version of the Stratus was sold in Mexico, with the 2.4 L DOHC four-cylinder engine and a four-speed automatic transmission with Autostick. This engine produced at 5,200 rpm and of torque at 2,200 rpm. The 2.4 L turbo engines were only available for the Mexican market.

The Stratus was sold in Europe, with the 2.0 L and the V6 engines, as the Chrysler Stratus (the Dodge name was not used in Europe, except for commercial vehicles). Its styling was similar to that of Chrysler&#x27;s Cirrus (which featured chrome accent moldings along the doors and bumpers), with the exception of the rear taillights, which were the same as Dodge&#x27;s Stratus, and a Dodge grille, which differed from that of the Chrysler Cirrus and Plymouth Breeze. The Chrysler Stratus competed in the Swedish Touring Car Championship; the Dodge branded model also competed in North American Touring Car Championship as one of few truly professional teams to compete in the short-lived championship, with David Donohue winning the 1997 season using a Stratus.

For Brazil, the Stratus was marketed as the Chrysler Stratus, the equivalent Chrysler Cirrus being unavailable. It had the same engines as the North American version but a higher ground clearance for the Brazilian road conditions.

In Argentina, it was marketed as the Chrysler Stratus, and it was raced in the category &quot;Superturismo Sudamericano&quot; (Copa de las Naciones), driven by Ernesto Bessone and Pablo Peon.

In the Gulf states, the Stratus was sold under both the Dodge and Chrysler brand. The latter sporting the styling of the European version with the exception of having North American market rear bumper.

In several countries and U.S. jurisdictions, the Stratus and Cirrus were used as police vehicles.

==Second generation (2001–2006)==
In 2000, the Stratus became the last of the &quot;Cloud Cars&quot; when the Cirrus was renamed as the Sebring, and the Breeze was discontinued (along with the Plymouth brand). This generation of the Dodge Stratus was not sold in Canada, although 1999 was the last year for Dodge Stratus sales in Canada. The 2002 models no longer had the &quot;DODGE&quot; badges on the front doors.


The Stratus and Sebring sedans for the second generation used a revised version of the Chrysler JA platform named JR. The coupé models with the same names were entirely different cars; they were actually based on the Mitsubishi Eclipse.

During this time, sales declined as its ratings by consumer and auto magazines fell among competing mid-size cars. At the same time sedan market had shifted with the larger Intrepid and later Charger achieving record sales. The 2004 model year included styling revisions, but this did not improve sales. The Stratus was discontinued in May 2006 (the Sebring name was continued).

===International markets===
In Mexico, the Stratus R/T came in a turbocharged version. The Stratus R/T&#x27;s turbocharged 2.4 L engine included improvements in 2001 with output increasing to . This version would later be used in the U.S. in the Dodge SRT-4 and PT Cruiser GT. Stratus R/T engines built from March 2004 were had at 5200 rpm and of torque at 4200 rpm. Stratus R/T models with the turbocharged engine featured a &quot;Turbo&quot; badge on the rear.

===Engines===
*2.4 L &quot;EDZ&quot; I4
*2.4 L &quot;EDV/EDT&quot; I4
*2.7 L &quot;EER&quot; V6

===Stratus coupé===
For 2001, Dodge introduced the Stratus coupé, replacing the discontinued Avenger. This model along with the Chrysler Sebring coupé were built at the former Diamond Star Motors plant by Mitsubishi, using the ST-22 platform. Like its Chrysler counterpart, the coupé models shared very little other than the name and a few exterior styling cues with sedan and convertible models. The Stratus coupé was restyled for the 2003 model year. The coupé was discontinued after 2005, one year before the sedan. The next midsize Dodge which replaced the Stratus, the Avenger, did not include a coupé version.

====Engines====
*2.4 L &quot;4G64&quot; I4
*3.0 L &quot;6G72&quot; V6

==Safety==
The first generation Dodge Stratus received a &quot;Poor&quot; rating in the IIHS frontal crash test. It was actually a Chrysler Cirrus that was tested, but the results also apply to the Stratus, and also the Plymouth Breeze. The second generation Stratus and its twin, the Chrysler Sebring, received an overall &quot;Acceptable&quot; rating in the IIHS frontal test due to a possible injury to the right leg. On the side test, the Stratus receives a &quot;Poor&quot; rating without optional side airbags due to a serious neck injury, a weak side structure, possible rib fractures, and high forces on the shoulder and pelvis. Its seats and head restraints earn an overall &quot;Acceptable&quot; rating from the IIHS.

==Licensed production in Russia==

The license and production facilities for the second generation Dodge Stratus and Chrysler Sebring sedans were sold in April 2006 to Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska, owner of the GAZ company in Nizhny Novgorod, which builds the Volga automobile. The price for the production line and rights was approximately US$151 million (€124 million). The models were built by GAZ in Russia from late 2007 through 2010 as the Volga Siber. The production facilities were planned to build up to 65,000 cars of both models yearly. Four-cylinder engines were to be purchased from Chrysler and made in Mexico.

The Siber was introduced at the start of the Global Economic Crisis of 2008, and through an annual production of 40,000 vehicles had been planned, sales were not as expected and around 9,000 had been manufactured by the time the Siber was discontinued after the 2010 model year.

<text>Norman Howard Bangerter (January 4, 1933 – April 14, 2015) was an American politician and businessman who served as the 13th governor of Utah from 1985 to 1993. He was the first Republican elected to the position since 1960, and the first to hold the office since 1965.

==Early life==
Bangerter was born in Granger, Utah (now West Valley City) to William Henry Bangerter and Isabelle Bawden. His older brother, William Grant Bangerter, served as a General Authority of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

== Career ==
Prior to his election, Bangerter founded a successful construction firm which specialized in building homes. He served in the Utah House of Representatives from 1975 to 1985 and as speaker of that body from 1981 until 1985.

During his tenure as governor, Bangerter dealt with the flooding of the Great Salt Lake and its tributaries by approving the construction of large, US$60 million pumps to channel excess water from the Great Salt Lake onto the Bonneville Salt Flats. This was initially successful, yet caused some controversy when the lake&#x27;s water level fell in later years, and some regarded the idle pumps as wasteful.

Bangerter&#x27;s &quot;foremost interest was improving the state&#x27;s educational system&quot;.

After his retirement as governor, Bangerter returned to his construction firm and served for three years as president of the South Africa Johannesburg Mission of the LDS Church from 1996 to 1999.

The Bangerter Highway (SR-154), which opened in 1998, was named after the former governor, who had long supported such a road.

In 2008, Bangerter was appointed to the Governing Board for the national children&#x27;s charity Operation Kids.

== Personal life ==
Bangerter married his wife, the former Colleen Monson, in 1953. The two had six children and one foster son.

On April 14, 2015, Bangerter suffered a stroke and later died at the age of 82.

<doc id="863577" wikidata="Q357958" url="?curid=863577" title="William Carroll (Tennessee politician)">
<text>William Carroll (March 3, 1788March 22, 1844) was an American politician who served as the fifth Governor of Tennessee twice, from 1821 to 1827 and again from 1829 to 1835. He held the office longer than any other person, including the state&#x27;s only other six-term governor, John Sevier. He is considered one of the state&#x27;s most popular political figures of the 1820s, and is credited with initiating numerous legal and tax reforms.

Carroll joined the Tennessee militia as a captain in 1812, and quickly rose through the ranks. He participated in several engagements during the Creek War, and, as a major-general, commanded Andrew Jackson&#x27;s center at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815.

==Early life==
Like two of his predecessors, Archibald Roane and Joseph McMinn, Carroll was a native of Pennsylvania, having been born near Pittsburgh.

His father, Thomas Carroll, was a business associate of Albert Gallatin, and had established a successful chain of hardware stores in the Pittsburgh area. William Carroll had little formal education as a child, but acquired practical learning from working in his father&#x27;s business.

He moved to Nashville in 1808 and established a branch store in the city. He presented himself to Andrew Jackson with a letter of introduction from Gallatin.

==War of 1812 and Creek War==

At the outbreak of the War of 1812, Carroll was appointed captain of the Nashville Uniform Volunteers, and joined Andrew Jackson&#x27;s Creek campaign. Within a few months, he had been promoted to major, and took part in the Battle of Talladega in November 1813. For his actions in this battle, he was promoted to colonel. He fought at the Battles of Emuckfaw and Enotachopo Creek in January 1814, and was wounded at the Battle of Horseshoe Bend in March 1814.

In 1813, Carroll became involved in a quarrel with another Jackson subordinate, Jesse Benton, that culminated in a duel on June 14 of that year. Jackson initially tried to defuse the quarrel, but, unsuccessful, he agreed to be Carroll&#x27;s second. In the duel, Carroll lost part of his thumb, and Benton was shot through the hip, but both survived. Benton&#x27;s older brother, Thomas Hart Benton, was enraged after hearing Jackson had supported Carroll, and would later injure Jackson in a brawl in Nashville over the incident.

After the Battle of Horseshoe Bend, Carroll returned to Nashville to recruit troops for the defense of New Orleans. After Jackson resigned from the militia to accept a commission in the federal army, Carroll was elected major-general of the Tennessee militia. Traveling via the Cumberland, Ohio and Mississippi rivers, his new troops arrived in New Orleans just prior to the British invasion. At the Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815, Carroll&#x27;s troops fought near the center of Jackson&#x27;s line, where some of the most intense fighting occurred.

==Politics==
Following the war, Carroll resumed his business career in Nashville. In 1818, he became part owner of the New Orleans steamboat, the &quot;General Jackson&quot;. On March 11, 1819, after a treacherous journey up the Mississippi, Ohio and Cumberland rivers, the &quot;General Jackson&quot; became the first steamboat to reach Nashville. During the Panic of 1819, Carroll&#x27;s business failed, and he was forced into bankruptcy.

In 1821, Carroll, still immensely popular from his War of 1812 endeavors, ran for governor. Although his opponent, Edward Ward, was backed by the state&#x27;s political elite, including Andrew Jackson, Hugh Lawson White and Joseph McMinn, Carroll gained the support of Jackson foes John Williams and Davy Crockett, and was able to harness the anti-establishment sentiment that had arisen in the wake of the financial crisis. He easily defeated Ward on election day, 32,290 votes to 7,294. He immediately set out to reform the state&#x27;s tax laws, but his call for a constitutional convention was defeated by the legislature.

As Tennessee&#x27;s economy improved, Carroll&#x27;s popularity soared. He ran unopposed for reelection in 1823 and 1825. 

In 1827, at the end of his third two-year term, constitutional term limits prevented him from serving a fourth consecutive term. He was succeeded by Sam Houston.

After he was passed over for a U. S. Senate seat, he became wary of the Jacksonites, and ran against Houston in 1829. Houston resigned following a scandal shortly after Carroll announced his campaign, however, and William Hall, as Speaker of the Senate, succeeded him. Hall refused to run for reelection, and Carroll was easily elected.

Carroll successfully sought the office again in 1831 and 1833, and was elected without opposition.

Carrol&#x27;s governorship was noted for the establishment of a more progressive (for the era) Penal Code, which replaced corporal punishment with a state prison system, as well as the establishment of an insane asylum and the establishment of a Chancery Court.

He also persistently advocated for government-funded internal improvements, which helped the state&#x27;s businesses. During his final term, the state constitution of 1796 was supplanted by a new one which gave more executive power to the governor; although this document was technically superseded by the current one in 1870, that document carries over very many of the provisions of the 1834 constitution, upon which it was largely based.

Popular provisions in the new constitution included an equitable land tax (which benefited small farmers) and the requirement that county officials be popularly elected, rather than appointed.

Carroll claimed that the new constitution allowed him to seek a fourth consecutive term. He was doomed by rising Whig sentiment in the state, however, and lost the gubernatorial election to Newton Cannon by a vote of 41,970 to 31,205. He persistently campaigned for one of the state&#x27;s U. S. Senate seats in subsequent years, but was never successful.

Carroll served as governor of Tennessee longer than anyone else has to this point, even fellow six-term governor Sevier. Sevier&#x27;s first term was unusually short due to the time of year of the admission of Tennessee into the Union. Carroll&#x27;s gubernatorial service totaled twelve years and twelve days.

==Death==
Carroll lived quietly after his terms as governor ended. He died on March 22, 1844, and is interred at Nashville City Cemetery in Nashville, Tennessee.

==Legacy==
Carroll County, Tennessee, is named in his honor.

Carroll County, Arkansas, although disputed, is believed by some historians to be named in his honor. As support for this theory, historians point to the fact that a large percentage of the Carroll County, Arkansas population is reported to have emigrated from Overton County, Tennessee during his popular governorship.

Carrollton, New Orleans, Louisiana, is named in his honor.

==Family life==
He was married to Cecilia Bradford, and they raised four children. One of their sons was Confederate Brigadier General William Henry Carroll.

<text>In programming language theory, call-by-push-value (CBPV) is an intermediate language that embeds the call-by-value (CBV) and call-by-name (CBN) evaluation strategies. CBPV is structured as a polarized λ-calculus with two main types, &quot;values&quot; (+) and &quot;computations&quot; (-). Restrictions on interactions between the two types enforce a controlled order of evaluation, similar to monads or CPS. The calculus can embed computational effects, such as nontermination, mutable state, or nondeterminism. There are natural semantics-preserving translations from CBV and CBN into CBPV. This means that giving a CBPV semantics and proving its properties implicitly establishes CBV and CBN semantics and properties as well. Paul Blain Levy formulated and developed CBPV in several papers and his doctoral thesis.

== Definition ==

The CBPV paradigm is based on the slogan &quot;a value is, a computation does&quot;. One complication in the presentation is distinguishing type variables ranging over value types from those ranging over computation types. This article follows Levy in using underlines to denote computations, so formula_1 is an (arbitrary) value type but formula_2 is a computation type. Some authors use other conventions, such as distinct sets of letters.

The exact set of constructs varies by author and desired use for the calculus, but the following constructs are typical:

* Lambdas codice_1 are computations of type formula_3, where formula_4 and formula_5. A lambda application codice_2 or codice_3 is a computation of type formula_2, where formula_7 and formula_8. The let-binding construct codice_4 binds values codice_5 to values codice_6, of matching types formula_9, inside a computation codice_7 : formula_2.
* A thunk codice_8 is a value of type formula_11 constructed from a computation codice_7 of type formula_12. Forcing a thunk is a computation, codice_10 : formula_12 for a thunk codice_11 : formula_11.
* It is also possible to wrap a value codice_12 of type formula_15 as a computation codice_13 : formula_16. Such a computation can be used inside another computation as codice_14 : formula_2, where codice_7 : formula_16, and codice_16 : formula_2 is a computation.
* Values can also include algebraic data types constructed from a tag and zero or more sub-values, while computations include a deconstructing pattern-match codice_17. Depending on presentation, ADTs may be limited to binary sums and products, Booleans only, or be omitted altogether.

A program is a closed computation of type formula_16, where formula_15 is a ground ADT type.

=== Complex values ===

Expressions such as codice_18 make sense denotationally. But, following the rules above, codice_19 can only be encoded using pattern-matching, which would make it a computation, and therefore the overall expression must also be a computation, giving codice_20. Similarly, there is no way to obtain codice_21 from codice_22 without constructing a computation. When modelling CBPV in the equational or category theory, such constructs are indispensable. Levy therefore defines an extended IR, &quot;CBPV with complex values&quot;. This IR extends let-binding to bind values within a value expression, and also to pattern-match a value with each clause returning a value expression. Besides modelling, such constructs also make writing programs in CBPV more natural.

Complex values complicate the operational semantics, in particular requiring an arbitrary decision of when to evaluate the complex value. Such a decision has no semantic significance because evaluating complex values has no side effects. Also, it is possible to syntactically convert any computation or closed expression to one of the same type and denotation without complex values. Therefore, many presentations omit complex values.

== Translation ==

The CBV translation produces CBPV values for each expression. A CBV function codice_1 : formula_22 is translated to codice_24 : formula_23. A CBV application codice_25 : formula_15 is translated to a computation codice_26 of type formula_16, making the order of evaluation explicit. A pattern match codice_17 is translated as codice_28. Values are wrapped with codice_29 when necessary, but otherwise remain unmodified. In some translations, sequencing may be required, such as translating codice_30 to codice_31.

The CBN translation produces CBPV computations for each expression. A CBN function codice_1 : formula_26 translates unaltered, codice_33 : formula_27. A CBN application codice_25 : formula_28 is translated to a computation codice_35 of type formula_29. A pattern match codice_17 is translated similarly to CBN as codice_37. ADT values are wrapped with codice_29, but codice_39 and codice_40 are also necessary on internal structure. Levy&#x27;s translation assumes that codice_41, which does indeed hold.

It is also possible to extend CBPV to model call-by-need, by introducing a codice_42 construct that allows visible sharing. This construct has semantics similar to codice_43, except that with the codice_44 construct, the thunk of codice_7 is evaluated at most once.

== Modifications ==

Some authors have noted that CBPV can be simplified, by removing either the U type constructor (thunks) or the F type constructor (computations returning values). Egger and Mogelberg justify omitting U on the grounds of streamlined syntax and avoiding the clutter of inferable conversions from computations to values. This choice makes computation types a subset of value types, and it is then natural to expand function types to a full function space between values. They term their calculus the &quot;Enriched Effects Calculus&quot;. This modified calculus is equivalent to a superset of CBPV via a bidirectional semantics-preserving translation. Ehrhard in contrast omits the F type constructor, making values a subset of computations. Ehrhard renames computations to &quot;general types&quot; to better reflect their semantics. This modified calculus, the &quot;half-polarized lambda calculus&quot;, has close connections to linear logic. It can be translated bidirectionally to a subset of a fully-polarized variant of CBPV.

<text>Deerhoof is an American musical group formed in San Francisco in 1994. They consist of founding drummer Greg Saunier, bassist and singer Satomi Matsuzaki, and guitarists John Dieterich and Ed Rodriguez. Beginning as an improvised noise punk band, Deerhoof became widely renowned and influential in the 2000s through their self-produced albums.

They have released seventeen studio albums since 1997. Their most recent album, &quot;Miracle-Level&quot;, was released on March 31, 2023.

==History==
===Formation===
Deerhoof was formed in San Francisco in 1994 as Rob Fisk&#x27;s improvisational bass/harmonica solo project. Greg Saunier joined on drums a week later. They were quickly signed to record a single for Kill Rock Stars after owner Slim Moon witnessed their performance at the 1994 Yoyo A Go Go festival. Satomi Matsuzaki joined Deerhoof within a week of moving to the United States from Japan in May 1995, with no prior experience playing in a band, and went on tour as Deerhoof&#x27;s singer only a week later, opening for Caroliner. Their 1997 debut album &quot;The Man, the King, the Girl&quot; was recorded on a 4-track tape.

Deerhoof had a music practice space at the Art Explosion Studios at 2425 17th Street in the Mission District; other bands in this space included Creeper Lagoon, Beulah, Zmrzlina, Don&#x27;t Mean Maybe, and S-- S-- Band Band.

===Breakthrough===
Chris Cohen joined Deerhoof on guitar in 2002, between &quot;Reveille&quot; completion and release.

In contrast to &quot;Reveille&quot; digital production process, 2003&#x27;s &quot;Apple O&#x27;&quot; was played almost entirely live to tape in one nine-hour session with Jay Pellicci engineering. Extinction, nuclear holocaust, invasive species, and the Greek god of music all figure prominently in the album&#x27;s themes. Karen O chose &quot;Apple O″&quot; in the Rolling Stone 2003 Music Awards, Artists&#x27; Top Albums, and the album received some critical praise, notably in the &quot;New York Times&quot;. But in what was to become a pattern for Deerhoof, the album&#x27;s critical appraisal improved with time, and &quot;Apple O&#x27;&quot; was later listed by Pitchfork as one of the top albums of the 2000s. The anti-war themes of the record were underscored by Deerhoof&#x27;s outspoken opposition to that year&#x27;s invasion of Iraq.

By 2003 Deerhoof had become the longest-running band on Kill Rock Stars. Matsuzaki was editing a Bay Area Japanese magazine, Cohen was waiting tables at a Thai restaurant, and Dieterich and Saunier were doing data entry for legal and consulting firms, but that year they all decided to quit their jobs simultaneously and focus on touring. That year they contributed to &quot;Azadi! A Benefit Compilation for the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan&quot;. Saunier also released &quot;Nervous Cop&quot;, a collaboration album with Zach Hill and Joanna Newsom. 

Deerhoof&#x27;s next record took its inspiration from a crudely drawn character created by the Japanese artist Ken Kagami. 2004&#x27;s &quot;Milk Man&quot; featured an opulent, campy sound inspired by Broadway and Igor Stravinsky. It was nominated for &quot;Outstanding Alternative Album&quot; in the California Music Awards, and stayed at No. 1 on the Dusted Radio Chart for six consecutive weeks, and reached No. 1 on the CMJ Core Chart. Also in 2004 Deerhoof received the Editor&#x27;s Choice Award from &quot;7x7&quot; magazine, and was voted &quot;Best Local Rock Band&quot; by readers of SF Weekly. In 2006 &quot;Milk Man&quot; was adapted to a children&#x27;s ballet.

Deerhoof&#x27;s next release was their first to be sung in Matsuzaki&#x27;s native language of Japanese. 2005&#x27;s mini-album &quot;Green Cosmos&quot; combined an orchestral sound with dance music styles.

Deerhoof spent several months in 2005 in a rented rehearsal space in Oakland, writing and recording daily as a full band. When the result was released that fall, the double album &quot;The Runners Four&quot; featured each band member taking turns as vocalist, singing unusually wordy lyrics in which Arks and time capsules recur, as though foretelling that this would be the final recording of this lineup. Instrumental roles were reversed for Matsuzaki (now on guitar) and Cohen (now on bass).

In 2006, Danielson released the critically acclaimed &quot;Ships&quot;, which featured Deerhoof as the backing band for many of the tracks. Later that year after an extensive world tour that ended at Coachella, Deerhoof composed and performed a live soundtrack to Harry Smith&#x27;s hour-long animation masterpiece &quot;Heaven and Earth Magic&quot; at the San Francisco International Film Festival. This was Cohen&#x27;s last activity with Deerhoof. The split was amicable and commemorating Cohen, Deerhoof posted a free EP on their website, one of several they have posted over the years. Chris Cohen now records and tours as a solo act.

===Reconfiguration===
Matsuzaki, Saunier, and Dieterich began a new recording as a trio. They recorded mostly in Dieterich&#x27;s bedroom and mixed it on the band&#x27;s laptop in hotel rooms during tours with Radiohead, the Flaming Lips, and Beck. Some material was from the &quot;Heaven and Earth Magic&quot; soundtrack, some was completely orchestral (without drums or guitars), and one song (&quot;Matchbook Seeks Maniac&quot;) was created specifically for the end credits of a Hollywood film. The album was highly praised in Pitchfork and Rolling Stone.

By January 2008 Deerhoof became a quartet again with the addition of the Flying Luttenbachers/Gorge Trio/XBXRX guitarist and longtime friend Ed Rodriguez. That summer Deerhoof released the song &quot;Fresh Born&quot; online as sheet music only, anticipating similar experiments by Beck and Blur by several years. Fans recorded and uploaded their own versions of the song to a special site, before anyone outside the band had heard Deerhoof&#x27;s own version. The October 2008 album &quot;Offend Maggie&quot; received critical praise from VH1, NPR, Entertainment Weekly, Alternative Press, The Guardian, and Mojo.

In April 2010 Deerhoof curated the Belgian music festival Sonic City, inviting an eclectic array of European acts including The Go! Team, Paolo Pandolfo, and sitting in with the Belgian punk band the Kids. Then in April and July 2010, Deerhoof and Xiu Xiu joined to perform Joy Division&#x27;s album &quot;Unknown Pleasures&quot; live at the Donaufestival in Austria, and at Brooklyn&#x27;s Williamsburg Waterfront.

===Format experimentation===
Building on &quot;I Did Crimes For You&quot;, during this time they continued to record themselves in a rented rehearsal space in Oakland. Musical influences from the Beach Boys, new romanticism, tropicalia, and the Congotronics series all found their way onto 2011&#x27;s &quot;Deerhoof vs. Evil&quot;. The band released the album one track at a time via different media outlets online, with a full map and schedule available on their own website. The album received critical acclaim notably from Entertainment Weekly, MOJO, and Paste. Matt Goldman&#x27;s design was the second Deerhoof album cover to feature a mushroom cloud. A remix of &quot;Behold a Marvel in the Darkness&quot; was done by Shugo Tokumaru. Deerhoof immediately initiated a 7-inch series wherein guest vocalists (including Jeff Tweedy of Wilco, Kevin Barnes of Of Montreal, singer-songwriter David Bazan, rapper Busdriver, and others) sang new lyrics over an instrumental of a &quot;Deerhoof vs. Evil&quot; song of their choice.

Deerhoof was &quot;The Wire&quot; magazine&#x27;s January 2011 cover story. They contributed to Polyvinyl&#x27;s benefit compilation &quot;Japan 3.11.11&quot; joining in the relief efforts to help with the devastation from March&#x27;s earthquake and tsunami. Throughout the summer of 2011, Deerhoof toured in an international supergroup alongside Konono N°1, Juana Molina, Kasai Allstars and others, called Congotronics Vs. Rockers. Their onstage repertoire included the Deerhoof song &quot;Super Duper Rescue Heads&quot; from &quot;Deerhoof Vs. Evil&quot;. In April 2012 Deerhoof collaborated with Questlove, Reggie Watts, Sasha Grey, and others in a conceptual concert event called &quot;Shuffle Culture&quot; at Brooklyn Academy of Music. In April 2012 a young adult fiction book, &quot;Rules to Rock By&quot;, by Josh Farrar was published; it is about a 12-year-old girl who is inspired by Deerhoof to form her own band. Deerhoof&#x27;s version of LiLiPUT&#x27;s &quot;Hitchhike&quot; appears on the soundtrack. In June 2012 at a Deerhoof performance in Chicago&#x27;s Millennium Park, contemporary classical music ensemble Dal Niente performed Marcos Balter&#x27;s arrangement of Deerhoof&#x27;s &quot;Eaguru Guru&quot;. In the same month Deerhoof and The Flaming Lips performed onstage together playing songs by King Crimson, Canned Heat, and Deerhoof.

In 2012 Deerhoof also began home-recording their next record &quot;Breakup Song&quot;. The band said that the album was a response to the tradition of breakup songs, which they felt included too many sad songs and too few empowering ones. After a long final mixing session at Saunier&#x27;s apartment, Matsuzaki took the front cover photo of a garbage truck in the early morning hours. The Polyvinyl Records release was also released on Joyful Noise Recordings in &quot;flexi-book&quot; format, allowing the listener to flip from song to song as if each track were a page in a storybook. Deerhoof hero Simeon of Silver Apples made a remix of &quot;Mario&#x27;s Flaming Whiskers III&quot;. Revealing some of Deerhoof&#x27;s working methods and group chemistry, a rare full-band interview, with former MTV VJ John Norris, appeared in the fall 2012 &quot;Interview&quot; magazine.

In October, they released a single &quot;Sexy, but Sparkly&quot;, produced by &quot;Fear of a Black Planet&quot; co-producer Chris Shaw, marking the first time Deerhoof worked with a producer. It was recorded as part of the series of short documentaries Masters From Their Day, which chronicles the efforts of a band and a record-producer as they attempt to record and mix a new single in one day. The song then appeared in the LAMC split-7&quot; series, in which a more known artist chooses a lesser-known one (Deerhoof chose Half Waif) to make their recorded debut, with proceeds going to the Ariel Panero Memorial Fund at VH1 Save the Music.

Deerhoof&#x27;s twelfth album, 2014&#x27;s &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; was self-recorded live in guitarist Ed Rodriguez&#x27;s basement during a &quot;weeklong sleepover arguing over whether to try and sound like Joan Jett or Janet Jackson&quot;. The recordings were meant as demos to be rerecorded with former music journalist and Mr. Dream drummer Nick Sylvester, but the band liked the raw DIY versions so much, they just kept them and recorded the vocals with Sylvester. The lyrics were heavily influenced by &quot;24/7&quot;, a book by Columbia professor Jonathan Crary. The album art was by Sara Cwynar. Their music video for &quot;Exit Only&quot; featured Michael Shannon playing two roles, with a cameo by Rodriguez. The Guardian, on their exclusive preview stream of &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, collected testimonials about Deerhoof from a variety of notable musicians and artists, including Radiohead&#x27;s Jonny Greenwood, Henry Rollins, Blur&#x27;s Graham Coxon, Adam Green, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs&#x27; Brian Chase, and David Shrigley. The album received high praise from NPR, A.V. Club, Alternative Press, and The Wire, and was reviewed by Tune-Yards&#x27; Merril Garbus for Talkhouse.

===20-year anniversary===
For Deerhoof and Lightning Bolt&#x27;s mutual 20-year anniversary, Matt Conboy directed a Pitchfork-premiered documentary called &quot;Checking in at 20&quot; about their respective drummers. 2014 also saw the release of Deerhoof&#x27;s contribution to the &quot;BOATS&quot; compilation, an international arts project featuring and supporting Dalit &quot;untouchable&quot; children in south-east India and featuring samples of the Light of Love Children&#x27;s Choir.

During the world tour for &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;, three complete-performance live videos were shot: their November 4 record release show in Brooklyn, a nine-song Boiler Room session recorded in London while both Rodriguez and Matsuzaki were ill with fevers and Saunier had a black eye, and a December 16 performance recorded at a tiny Tokyo rock club called Fever, resulting in a live album, &quot;Fever 121614&quot;. The 2015 release included a downloadable video of the entire show, edited by longtime friend and collaborator Noriko Oishi. The LP/CD artwork included a massive collage of fan-contributed drawings of the band in manga style. Also in 2015 Deerhoof contributed a track in support of gay and transgender Hoosiers on the Joyful Noise compilation &quot;50 Bands &amp; a Cat for Indiana Equality&quot;.

In August 2015, the band was the first act invited to perform improvisational site-specific noise music at CERN&#x27;s Large Hadron Collider, as part of the Ex/Noise/CERN project, founded by particle physicist James Beacham, who stated, &quot;Musical curiosity is similar to scientific curiosity and, on a personal level, Deerhoof has inspired me as much as Einstein&quot;. The resulting film of the project quickly became one of the top ten most-watched videos ever produced by CERN and received wide coverage in the music, art, and science press, as well as positive responses from notable artists, musicians, and writers.

In 2016 Deerhoof released &quot;The Magic&quot;. The album blends glam metal, punk, and noise, but also includes a cover of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Set the World on Fire&quot; by The Ink Spots. The cover art was by Matsuzaki. Joseph Baughman created the stop-motion music video for the album&#x27;s &quot;The Devil and his Anarchic Surrealist Retinue&quot;. Baughman described his style as a slow-motion improvisation. The clay animated video features chessboard pieces and multicolored minotaurs.

&quot;The Magic&quot; was the first Deerhoof album to hit No. 1 on CMJ, and was highly praised by NPR, A.V. Club and Exclaim. A.V. Club invited them to participate in A.V. Undercover, where bands choose from an ever-dwindling list of songs to cover on video. They ended up with &quot;Goody Two Shoes&quot; by Adam Ant but included an excerpt of &quot;Hot for Teacher&quot; by Van Halen. Those who pre-ordered &quot;The Magic&quot; from Polyvinyl were treated to a surprise cassette that included Deerhoof doing covers of Def Leppard, Van Halen, David Bowie, Madonna, Sonic Youth, Malaria!, and Public Enemy. Their cover of &quot;Fight the Power&quot; appears on the Planned Parenthood benefit compilation &quot;Cover Your Ass&quot;. They contributed
a cover of Xiu Xiu&#x27;s &quot;Hi&quot;, played in the style of White Reaper, to the &quot;Polyvinyl Plays Polyvinyl&quot; compilation.

After a long world tour for &quot;The Magic&quot;, Deerhoof was invited by Red Hot Chili Peppers to open their concerts in northern European arenas in November 2016. Deerhoof is confirmed to open for Red Hot Chili Peppers again in summer 2017. They were one of the headliners of 2017&#x27;s Big Ears Festival.

===Joyful Noise Recordings===
In 2017 Deerhoof was chosen as Joyful Noise Recordings&#x27; Artist in Residence. Deerhoof and several Deerhoof-related collaborative projects will be releasing five new LPs in 2017. Proceeds will be donated to a variety of causes, the first of which will be Brand New Congress. On June 28 Deerhoof announced a new album titled &quot;Mountain Moves&quot; and premiered the first single &quot;I Will Spite Survive&quot; (featuring Jenn Wasner on guest vocals) on Democracy Now!. A second single &quot;Your Dystopic Creation Does Not Fear You&quot; (featuring rapper Awkwafina) was premiered on the Adult Swim Singles Series. &quot;Mountain Moves&quot; was released on September 8, 2017.

On May 29, 2020, the band released their fifteenth album, &quot;Future Teenage Cave Artists&quot;. They had previously released three singles from it: the title track, &quot;The Loved One&quot;, and &quot;Farewell Symphony&quot;. Future Teenage Cave Artists is notable in that it is Deerhoof&#x27;s first overt concept record.

Greg Saunier said in an August 2020 interview that a &quot;sort of a sequel&quot; to &quot;Future Teenage Cave Artists&quot; would be &quot;coming out in a couple months&quot;. On September 28 they released &quot;Love-Lore&quot;.

On December 21, 2021, the band released the live album &quot;Devil Kids&quot;.

The band released &quot;Miracle-Level&quot; on March 31, 2023. It is notable in that it is their first to be produced in a recording studio (rather than &quot;ad hoc&quot; spaces) and to have its lyrics entirely in Japanese.

On April 8, 2024, Saunier announced his solo debut album &quot;We Sang, Therefore We Were&quot;, which was released on April 26 by Joyful Noise.

==Musical style and legacy==
Deerhoof&#x27;s style has been described as indie rock, noise pop, punk rock, and &quot;experimental pop mired in a pure punk sense of adventure&quot;. AllMusic characterizes them as &quot;highly revered indie rockers ... who play fractured, whimsical noise pop with an avant-garde edge&quot;, while MaineToday describes them as &quot;the beloved punk band whose erratic style veers between pop, noise, and classic rock and roll&quot;.

According to Noisey, Deerhoof formed as a &quot;minimal noise improv&quot; act before shifting to &quot;pop-infused noise-punk&quot;. According to AllMusic, their early releases &quot;had a more traditionally harsh, no wave-inspired sound, though they also included the quirky tendencies that dominated their later efforts ... [which] mix noise, sugary melodies, and an experimental spirit into utterly distinctive music that made them one of the most acclaimed acts of the 2000s and 2010s.&quot; &quot;Impose&quot; writes that since &quot;their beginnings as a noise punk band ... [Deerhoof have] taken leaps and bounds artistically and stylistically, experimenting with pop and punk in ways we could&#x27;ve never imagined ... [and] ultimately [proving] that punk can fit into an artistic world.&quot; According to the Los Angeles Philharmonic, they made &quot;some of the most difficult and unclassifiable noise of the mid-&#x27;90s [before] unexpectedly [rising] to international prominence as one of indie rock&#x27;s most renowned and influential groups ... too &#x27;pop&#x27; for &#x27;noise,&#x27; and too &#x27;noise&#x27; for &#x27;pop.&#x27;&quot; For &quot;The Guardian&quot;, their breakthrough after many albums of &quot;elliptical art-pop&quot; came with &quot;Friend Opportunity&quot;, which showcased &quot;a band playing a constantly shifting mixture of psychedelia, post-punk, jazz and pop, which should have been difficult and forbidding, but was given an accessible focus by the sweet vocals and expressionist lyrics of bassist/chanteuse Satomi Matsuzaki. ... [The followup] &quot;Offend Maggie&quot; is head-spinning bliss from beginning to end, and proves that the quartet are the best prog-rock post-punk Afro-Oriental art-pop folk-jazz band in the world. Deerhoof also experiment with contemporary classical music.

In 2005, Nick Sylvester wrote in &quot;Pitchfork&quot; that they were &quot;the best band in the world&quot;.

They are known for their anti-capitalist, pro-social and radical DIY approach to art and life as exemplified by their work with and homages to David Graeber (an organizer of Occupy Wall Street), their anti-marketing campaigns, trenchant published commentary, and their use of a low-budget and eco-friendly style of production and touring, (for example, when they went on tour with the Red Hot Chili Peppers they all rode together with all of their gear to arena gigs in a Prius minivan behind the Chili Peppers&#x27; fleet of busses and semi-trailers.)

The band has been appreciated by and/or influential to other artists, notably David Bowie, Radiohead, Questlove, St. Vincent, Foo Fighters, Dirty Projectors, Tune-Yards, Stereolab, Henry Rollins, Sleigh Bells, and of Montreal. Deerhoof&#x27;s songs are covered often by other artists (notably Phil Lesh, Los Campesinos!, Marco Benevento, David Bazan, and classical composer Marcos Balter).

<text>Brian George Wilde (13 June 1927 – 20 March 2008) was an English actor best known for his roles in television comedy, most notably Mr Barrowclough in &quot;Porridge&quot; and Walter &quot;Foggy&quot; Dewhurst in &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;. Although tall, his gentle demeanour became his hallmark. His lugubrious world-weary face was a staple of British television for forty years.

==Career==
Born in Ashton-under-Lyne, Lancashire, Wilde was brought up in Devon and Hertfordshire and attended Hertford Grammar School. He trained as an actor at RADA.

Wilde had an early uncredited role as a small-time crook in the film &quot;Forbidden Cargo&quot; (1954), starring Jack Warner and Nigel Patrick, and a small but significant dramatic part in the horror film &quot;Night of the Demon&quot; (1957). His early television work included the series &quot;The Love of Mike&quot; (1960) and supporting Tony Hancock in episodes of his ATV series in 1963. Wilde also played Detective Superintendent Halcro in a series of two-part thrillers about undercover Scotland Yard officers, &quot;The Men from Room Thirteen&quot; (BBC, 1959–61). He had minor roles in films such as &quot;Life for Ruth&quot; (1962), &quot;The Bargee&quot; (1964), &quot;The Jokers&quot; (1967) and &quot;Carry On Doctor&quot; (1967), and on television in &quot;Room at the Bottom&quot; (1966–67) as Mr Salisbury. 

Wilde&#x27;s first major television success was in 1970 as refuse depot manager &quot;Bloody Delilah&quot; in the ITV sitcom &quot;The Dustbinmen&quot;. He showed his sinister side as the mischievous magician Mr Peacock in the children&#x27;s drama series &quot;Ace of Wands&quot; between 1970 and 1972. That year he starred as a murderer in &quot;The Uninvited&quot;, an episode of the BBC&#x27;s supernatural thriller series &quot;Out of the Unknown&quot;. Also in 1971, in the television drama &quot;Elizabeth R&quot;, Wilde played the efficient, merciless &#x27;rackmaster&#x27; Richard Topcliffe, who was charged with the torture of prisoners in the Tower of London. He played a character in the 1970s British children&#x27;s series &quot;The Ghosts of Motley Hall&quot;, by Richard Carpenter.

===&quot;Porridge&quot;===
In 1973, Wilde starred as a different kind of gaoler in the second episode of &quot;Seven of One&quot;, a series of seven individual stories, all of which starred Ronnie Barker. In the episode, entitled &quot;Prisoner and Escort&quot;, Wilde played Mr Barrowclough, one of two prison officers whose job it is to escort Barker&#x27;s character Fletcher across the moors to his prison (the other was Mr Mackay, played by Fulton Mackay). The episode proved successful and a series was commissioned by the BBC, titled &quot;Porridge&quot;. Wilde reprised his role as the timid and eager-to-please Barrowclough. &quot;Porridge&quot; which ran until 1977, was a great success, with a film version being made in 1979.

===&quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;===
Wilde gained and established another role in 1976, when he took over from Michael Bates as the third member of a trio of old men in the BBC sitcom &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;. The character, Walter &quot;Foggy&quot; Dewhurst, was a determined ex-army man who planned the group&#x27;s misadventures with military precision and a painstaking eye for detail. Wilde saw the long-running series gather momentum and continue its success; he stayed with the series for nine years, before leaving in 1985 to work on other projects. Foggy was written out of the series and was replaced by Michael Aldridge as Seymour Utterthwaite.

When Aldridge left &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot;, Wilde returned as Foggy in 1990. He stayed until 1997, when he contracted shingles during the preparations for series 19 and decided to leave. Frank Thornton was invited to join the cast to replace Wilde, making his debut in the 1997 Christmas special &quot;There Goes The Groom!&quot;. Wilde never returned to the programme, despite several invitations to do so.

===Other work===
Wilde featured in &quot;The Fear Merchants&quot;, an episode of ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Avengers&quot;, in January 1967. In this he played Jeremy Raven, a ceramics manufacturer caught up in a sinister plot to get rid of the competition. In 1978, Wilde voiced the public information film series &quot;Play Safe&quot;, highlighting the dangers of overhead power lines to children.

Wilde also supplied the voice of the magician Meredith in the children&#x27;s animated series &quot;Alias the Jester&quot;, Shortie the Giraffe in adverts for Coco Pops and narrated an animated series, &quot;Microscopic Milton&quot;, about a tiny man who lives in a clock on the mantelpiece in the parlour of the house that belongs to a lady called Mrs. Witherspoon. Wilde starred in his own BBC series in 1988, &quot;Wyatt&#x27;s Watchdogs&quot;, as retired soldier Major Wyatt who forms his own neighbourhood watch group. As a stuffy ex-army member who leads a motley bunch of comic characters, Wyatt was quite similar to Foggy. The programme, which co-starred Trevor Bannister, was written by Miles Tredinnick and ran for one series of six episodes.

===Death===
Wilde suffered a fall in January 2008 from which he never recovered. He died in his sleep, aged 80, on the morning of 20 March 2008, at his home in Ware, Hertfordshire.

Wilde&#x27;s son, Andrew Wilde, had been film editor on &quot;Last of the Summer Wine&quot; from the mid-1990s until the final episode in 2010, working initially on many of the episodes that had starred his father and later on the Frank Thornton editions.

<doc id="863584" wikidata="Q5114701" url="?curid=863584" title="Chrysler flathead engine">
<text>The Chrysler flathead engine is a flathead inline automotive engine manufactured by the Chrysler Corporation from 1924 through the early 1960s. It came in four-,six-, and eight-cylinder configurations and varying displacements, with both cast iron and cast aluminum cylinder heads. It was installed in Chrysler, DeSoto, Dodge, and Plymouth branded vehicles.

==Straight-4==
Chrysler introduced a straight-four in 1926 when the Maxwell Motor Corporation was re-organised into the Chrysler Corporation in 1925. Initially used by Chrysler, the straight-four was fitted to Plymouth cars and Dodge light trucks beginning in 1929, lasting in production through 1933.

The original version displaced and produced 38 hp (28 kW). This was only produced in 1926, with displacement reduced to for 1927 and 1928. Power was initially rated the same but was upped to 45 hp (34 kW) during the 1928 model year.

After the introduction of the Plymouth brand in 1929, the base engine was subjected to a major redesign and enlarged to with the power rating remaining the same. It was also used in Dodge light trucks in 1929–1930. The engine was enlarged again to in 1930 with 48 hp (36 kW), for 1931 with 56 hp (42 kW), and 1932 with 65 hp (48 kW) for Plymouth only; Dodge continued with the 48 hp (36 kW) from 1931 to 1933. A small-bore version was developed for export markets in 1931, with a narrower bore which brought the RAC rating down from 21 to 15.6 hp. For 1932 the bore was reduced further, bringing the tax horsepower rating to just beneath 15.5.

Chrysler did not offer a four-cylinder engine again until 1981 with the Chrysler 2.2 &amp; 2.5 engine used in the Chrysler K platform.

== Straight-6==

The first straight-6 was the B-Model (seven main bearings) and introduced in 1924 with the first Chrysler Corporation production, the B70. An upscale version designated E-Model equipped the new Chrysler Imperial E80 in 1926, and a downscale one named H-Model followed in 1927 (Chrysler Series 70). After the purchase of Dodge Brothers Company in 1928, Chrysler Corporation had five straight-6s in production with the addition of the Victory and Senior Dodge Brothers engines.

So, with the introduction of the new Desoto brand in 1929, came a new and cheaper to produce six cylinder, the K-Model, with four main bearings and deep skirts. By mid-1930, it partially replaced the previous engines in varying displacements on passenger cars, in conjunction with an all-new straight-8 engine. Only the Imperial&#x27;s engine remained in production for the Dodge Trucks&#x27; 2-ton Models F-40 &amp; K-50, 3-ton models F-60 &amp; K-70, 2 &amp; 3-ton Special, buses from 1930 to 1934-35. To replace these two engines, a new and very large six cylinder was launched in late 1936 (331 cu. in.), which grew to 413 cu in and was las used in the C-3 Series in 1956.

In 1932, the Ford flathead V8&#x27;s launch shook up the market, expanding the demand for larger engines to even entry-level brands. A new straight-6 for Plymouth (PC/PD) and Dodge (DP/DQ) came in production in 1933, known as the &quot;23 in block&quot;, featuring a shallow skirt and a followed by a larger (&quot;25 in block&quot; – 640 mm) variant for Desoto (S3) and Chrysler Royal (C16) in 1937, marking the K-Model end everywhere but in Canada. When Chrysler established an engine foundry in Windsor, Canada, in 1938, it was decided to only use the long block for all Canadian-built engines. These engines received a trailing &quot;C&quot; in their designation. Thanks to judicious bore and stroke dimensioning, the Canadian 201- and 218-cubic inch engines had nearly identical displacement to their American cousins.

Beginning in 1938, the straight-six was used in Massey Harris&#x27;s Model 101 tractor (later known as the 101 Super). It continued to be used by Massey until 1940, when it was supplanted by the . In 1940, Chrysler&#x27;s straight six went into Massey&#x27;s 201 Super, which lasted until 1942.

During World War II, the flathead six was used as the basis for the Chrysler A57 multibank tank engine.

The last automotive use of the Chrysler flathead straight-six was in 1968 (in the Dodge Power Wagon WM300, its last year of production, which used the 251 cu in variant ). It was replaced throughout Chrysler products by the much more efficient OHV Slant-6 released in 1960, which appeared in most Dodge trucks starting in 1961. The flathead remained in production until the early 1970s for industrial and agricultural use.

==Straight-8==
The new straight-8 engine is largely based on the six-cylinder engine that appeared on the Desoto Model K. It has five main levels, the central one being wider. When the engineers had to rebore the cylinders to 3-1/2 inches, the space between each pair of cylinders was modified. This applies to all blocks with the same bore.

In the case of the Imperial (CG, CH), then Custom imperial (CL, CW), a new 9 main bearing straight-8 engine was developed, equipped with a two-barrel downdraft carburetor. From the CW model, the cylinder head is made of aluminum. It also powered the Dodge Trucks G-80 models (1931-1934) and Fargo buses (1930-1932).

<text>Phillip Chen (born April 22, 1978) is an American politician and member of the California State Assembly. He is a Republican representing the 59th Assembly District, encompassing parts of North Orange County, and small parts of San Bernardino County. The district includes the cities of Brea, Yorba Linda, Placentia, Villa Park, Orange, North Tustin, Anaheim Hills, Chino, and Chino Hills. Prior to being elected to the state assembly, he was a school board trustee for the Walnut Valley Unified School District.

== Education ==
Chen graduated from Servite High School in Anaheim. In 2002, Chen earned his B.A. in Communications from California State University, Fullerton. In 2005, Chen earned a Master of Public Administration degree from the University of Southern California and, in 2014, also earned a Ph.D. in educational psychology from the university.

== Career ==
Chen is the owner of a property management company.

In 2013, Chen became an Adjunct Faculty Professor at the USC Sol Price School of Public Policy.

Chen is a former Los Angeles County Reserve Sheriff’s Deputy. Chen was appointed by former California Governor Pete Wilson to the Governor’s Office of Criminal Justice Planning, overseeing California’s juvenile justice programs. He was a member of the State Advisory Group, Juvenile Justice Legislative Committee and Juvenile Justice Native American Committee.

Chen was appointed to serve as a Board Member for the California Physical Therapy Board and worked as a health deputy to former Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael D. Antonovich.

Chen also served as adjunct faculty at California State Fullerton from 2007-2008 and at California State University, Los Angeles in 2016.

===Political career===
Chen was elected in November 2011 to the Walnut Valley Unified School Board and re-elected to a second term in 2015.

In 2014, Chen ran for the California State Assembly. He lost the jungle primary with a third place finish. Diamond Bar City Councilwoman Ling Ling Chang went on to easily win the general election.

Chen was elected to the California State Assembly in November 2016, when Chang left the State Assembly in an unsuccessful run for the California State Senate. He was appointed to serve in leadership as Deputy Whip to the Assembly Republican Caucus. His committee membership consists of the Banking and Finance Committee (where he serves as Vice-Chair), the Business and Professions Committee, the Insurance Committee, the Jobs, Economic Development and the Economy Committee, and the Utilities and Energy Committee.

In 2018, in the wake of California&#x27;s growing mental health and homeless epidemic, Chen authored Assembly Bill 2156, to clarify and fine tune the definition of “gravely disabled”. Chen later pulled that bill from consideration by the Assembly&#x27;s Health Committee. That same year, Chen also introduced AB 3005 which aimed to protect the sensitive personal information of children in foster care. Like his other bill, Chen also requested this bill to be pulled from consideration by the relevant committee.

In 2019, Chen introduced AB 517 to create a Property Crime Task Force in Orange County to prevent crimes as well as identify and arrest criminals who participate in property crimes. Chen&#x27;s bill died after clearing the public safety committee.

To address the growing number of homeless encampments, Chen introduced AB 1908, the Homeless Encampment and Litter Program (HELP), putting more accountability on Caltrans in coordinating access to housing and supportive services for those who need it most. The bill died in committee with no action taken. A few days after introducing AB 1908, Chen introduced AB 2021 in an effort to preserve open space in Southern California. The bill would have required the California Department of Parks and Recreation to seek opportunities for acquiring land to expand Chino Hills State Park. The bill unanimously passed the Water, Parks and Wildlife Committee, but then died in the Appropriations Committee.

In 2021 Chen helped secure funds for the Titan Gateway Pedestrian Bridge at Cal State Fullerton. Chen, a graduate of the school, said that although the school is outside his district, many students are constituents in his district, and the bridge would be a great investment in the students.

=== Wushu career ===
Chen founded the CSUF Wushu Club in 1997 as president and coach. The team competed in the Collegiate Wushu Tournament for the first time in 1999. During this time, the club grew in its standing in the university and became a for-credit course. Chen was the tournament director of the 2001 Collegiate Wushu Tournament hosted at CSUF.

Chen was an A-team member of the 1999 US Wushu Team and competed at the 1999 World Wushu Championships in Hong Kong, where he finished seventh in nanquan and tenth in nandao. A year later at the 2000 Pan American Wushu Championships, he was the Pan American champion in nandao and additionally won silver medals in nanquan and nangun. The following year, Chen was again an A-team member of both the Berkeley and Baltimore US Wushu Teams but did not compete in the following World or Pan American championships.

<doc id="863593" wikidata="Q7611112" url="?curid=863593" title="Stepping-stone squeeze">
<text>The stepping-stone squeeze is an advanced type of squeeze in contract bridge. It is used when the declarer has enough high cards to take all but one of the remaining tricks, but does not have enough communication between the hands to cash them. It was analyzed and named by Terence Reese in the book &quot;The Expert Game&quot;, also titled &quot;Master Play in Contract Bridge&quot;.

The following position is an example of a Stepping-stone squeeze:
South has three winners: The K, A, and A. However, after cashing the K, there will be no entry to the North hand to enjoy the A. However, on the play of A, West is squeezed. Discarding a spade allows South to overtake the K to get two tricks in the suit. Throwing the A lets South cash the K. Therefore, West parts with the 3. Now South is able to play the K and lead the K, putting West on lead with only the Q remaining in hand.

The name &quot;stepping-stone&quot; alludes to South&#x27;s use of West&#x27;s A to cross over to the abandoned A.

This squeeze would work equally well with the East and West hands reversed.

An interesting variation is the following ending playing in no trumps with the lead in South:
 Needing all but one of the remaining tricks, the declarer leads the 10 covered by West, dummy winning with the A. When the winning diamond is led from dummy (declarer throwing a heart) &quot;both&quot; defenders are subjected to a stepping-stone squeeze. If they both throw spades then declarer cashes the spades in dummy. If one defender keeps two spades then declarer plays a small spade to the J and leads a heart. Now the defender who kept spades wins his stiff honour and must lead a spade to dummy&#x27;s winner. His partner cannot overtake as this sets up the Q.

<doc id="863608" wikidata="Q4653114" url="?curid=863608" title="AN thread">
<text>The AN thread (also A-N) is a particular type of fitting used to connect flexible hoses and rigid metal tubing that carry fluid. It is a US military-derived specification that dates back to World War II and stems from a joint standard agreed upon by the Army Air Corps and Navy, hence AN. The Air Corps-Navy involvement is also the origin of the red/blue color combination that was traditionally used in the anodized finishing process. 

AN sizes range from -2 (dash two) to -32 in irregular steps, with each step equating to the OD (outside diameter) of the tubing in -inch increments. Therefore, a -8 AN size would be equal to -inch OD tube. However, this system does not specify the ID (inside diameter) of the tubing because the tube wall can vary in thickness. Each AN size also uses its own standard thread size.

AN fittings are a flare fitting, using 37° flared tubing to form a metal-to-metal seal. They are similar to other 37° flared fittings, such as JIC, which is their industrial variant. The two are interchangeable in theory, though this is typically not recommended due to the exacting specifications and demands of the aerospace industry. The differences between them relates to thread class and shape (how tight of a fit the threads are), and the metals used. Although similar, 37° AN and 45° SAE fittings and tooling are not interchangeable due to the different flare angles. Mixing them can cause leakage at the flare.

Note that AN threads are different for bolts and fittings. In bolts the number refers to the diameter of the bolt whereas in a fitting it refers to the OD of the tube and thereby have different threads. For example, AN6 bolt has a -24 thread whereas an -6 AN fitting has a -18 thread.

Originally parts were made compliant to the specification MIL-F-5509, but they are now controlled under SAE AS (Aerospace Standards) specifications AS4841 through AS4843 and AS4875.

<doc id="863612" wikidata="Q3242594" url="?curid=863612" title="Do while loop">
<text>In many computer programming languages, a do while loop is a control flow statement that executes a block of code and then either repeats the block or exits the loop depending on a given boolean condition.

The &quot;do while&quot; construct consists of a process symbol and a condition. First the code within the block is executed. Then the condition is evaluated. If the condition is true the code within the block is executed again. This repeats until the condition becomes false.

Do while loops check the condition after the block of code is executed. This control structure can be known as a post-test loop. This means the do-while loop is an exit-condition loop. However a while loop will test the condition before the code within the block is executed.

This means that the code is always executed first and then the expression or test condition is evaluated. This process is repeated as long as the expression evaluates to true. If the expression is false the loop terminates. A while loop sets the truth of a statement as a necessary condition for the code&#x27;s execution. A do-while loop provides for the action&#x27;s ongoing execution until the condition is no longer true.

It is possible and sometimes desirable for the condition to always evaluate to be true. This creates an infinite loop. When an infinite loop is created intentionally there is usually another control structure that allows termination of the loop. For example, a break statement would allow termination of an infinite loop.

Some languages may use a different naming convention for this type of loop. For example, the Pascal and Lua languages have a &quot;repeat until&quot; loop, which continues to run &quot;until&quot; the control expression is true and then terminates. In contrast a &quot;while&quot; loop runs &quot;while&quot; the control expression is true and terminates once the expression becomes false.

==Equivalent constructs==

do {
 do_work();
} while (condition);
is equivalent to
do_work();

while (condition) {
 do_work();


In this manner, the do ... while loop saves the initial &quot;loop priming&quot; with codice_1 on the line before the codice_2 loop.

As long as the &quot;continue&quot; statement is not used, the above is technically equivalent to the following (though these examples are not typical or modern style used in everyday computers):
while (true) {
 do_work();
 if (!condition) break;


or
LOOPSTART:
 do_work();
 if (condition) goto LOOPSTART;
==Demonstrating do while loops==

These example programs calculate the factorial of 5 using their respective languages&#x27; syntax for a do-while loop.

===Ada===

with Ada.Integer_Text_IO;

procedure Factorial is
 Counter : Integer := 5;
 Factorial : Integer := 1;
begin
 loop
 Factorial := Factorial * Counter;
 Counter := Counter - 1;
 exit when Counter = 0;
 end loop;

 Ada.Integer_Text_IO.Put (Factorial);
end Factorial;
===BASIC===

Early BASICs (such as GW-BASIC) used the syntax WHILE/WEND. Modern BASICs such as PowerBASIC provide both WHILE/WEND and DO/LOOP structures, with syntax such as DO WHILE/LOOP, DO UNTIL/LOOP, DO/LOOP WHILE, DO/LOOP UNTIL, and DO/LOOP (without outer testing, but with a conditional EXIT LOOP somewhere inside the loop). Typical BASIC source code:
Dim factorial As Integer
Dim counter As Integer

factorial = 1
counter = 5

Do
 factorial = factorial * counter
 counter = counter - 1
Loop While counter &gt; 0

Print factorial
===C, C++, D===
int counter = 5;
int factorial = 1;

do {
 factorial *= counter--; /* Multiply, then decrement. */
} while (counter &gt; 0);

printf(&quot;factorial of 5 is %d\n&quot;, factorial);
Do-while(0) statements are also commonly used in C macros as a way to wrap multiple statements into a regular (as opposed to compound) statement. It makes a semicolon needed after the macro, providing a more function-like appearance for simple parsers and programmers as well as avoiding the scoping problem with . It is recommended in CERT C Coding Standard rule PRE10-C.

===Fortran===

With legacy &quot;Fortran 77&quot; there is no DO-WHILE construct but the same effect can be achieved with GOTO:
 INTEGER CNT,FACT
 CNT=5
 FACT=1
 1 CONTINUE
 FACT=FACT*CNT
 CNT=CNT-1
 IF (CNT.GT.0) GOTO 1
 PRINT*,FACT
 END
Fortran 90 and later supports a DO-While construct:
program FactorialProg
 integer :: counter = 5
 integer :: factorial = 1

 factorial = factorial * counter
 counter = counter - 1

 do while (counter /= 0)
 factorial = factorial * counter
 counter = counter - 1
 end do

 print *, factorial
end program FactorialProg
===Java===
int counter = 5;
int factorial = 1;

do {
 factorial *= counter--; /* Multiply, then decrement. */
} while (counter &gt; 0);

System.out.println(&quot;The factorial of 5 is &quot; + factorial);
===Pascal===

Pascal uses repeat/until syntax instead of do while.
factorial := 1;
counter := 5;
repeat
 factorial := factorial * counter;
 counter := counter - 1; // In Object Pascal one may use dec (counter);
until counter = 0;
===PL/I===

The PL/I DO statement subsumes the functions of the post-test loop (&quot;do until&quot;), the pre-test loop (&quot;do while&quot;), and the for loop. All functions can be included in a single statement. The example shows only the &quot;do until&quot; syntax.
declare counter fixed initial(5);
declare factorial fixed initial(1);

do until(counter &lt;= 0);
 factorial = factorial * counter;
 counter = counter - 1;
end;

put(factorial);
=== Python ===
Python does not have a DO-WHILE loop, but its effect can be achieved by an infinite loop with a breaking condition at the end.
factorial = 1
counter = 5

while True:
 factorial *= counter
 counter -= 1
 if counter &lt; 1:
 break

print(factorial)
===Racket===

In Racket, as in other Scheme implementations, a &quot;named-let&quot; is a popular way to implement loops:
#lang racket
(define counter 5)
(define factorial 1)
(let loop ()
 (set! factorial (* factorial counter))
 (set! counter (sub1 counter))
 (when (&gt; counter 0) (loop)))
(displayln factorial)
Compare this with the first example of the while loop example for Racket. Be aware that a named let can also take arguments.

Racket and Scheme also provide a proper do loop.

(define (factorial n)
 (do ((counter n (- counter 1))
 (result 1 (* result counter)))
 ((= counter 0) result) ; Stop condition and return value.
 ; The body of the do-loop is empty.


===Smalltalk===
| counter factorial |
counter := 5.

[counter &gt; 0] whileTrue:
 [factorial := factorial * counter.
 counter := counter - 1].

<text>Woomera, unofficially Woomera village, is the domestic area of RAAF Base Woomera. Woomera village has always been a Defence-owned and operated facility. The village is located on the traditional lands of the Kokatha people in the Far North region of South Australia, but is on Commonwealth-owned land and within the area designated as the Woomera Prohibited Area (WPA). The village is approximately north of Adelaide. In common usage, &quot;Woomera&quot; refers to the wider RAAF Woomera Range Complex (WRC), a large Australian Defence Force aerospace and systems testing range (the Woomera Test Range (WTR)) covering an area of approximately and is operated by the Royal Australian Air Force.

Woomera &quot;village&quot; is part of RAAF Base Woomera which, along with the Woomera Test Range (WTR), forms the larger entity known as the Woomera Range Complex (WRC), promulgated by Chief of Air Force (CAF) in June 2014. As at the the Woomera Village had a population of 146, and its usual population varies between 150 and 200 people, yet the village can provide accommodation and services for up to 500 people per day. Although the complex is closed to the public, Woomera village, and its four museum elements, is open to the public all year round. The location of the Woomera Village can be described as being in the outback desert area of South Australia. It is approximately north-west of Adelaide and is in the State region known as the Far North. There are 27 pastoral stations within the Woomera Prohibited Area, which essentially forms the ground space of the Woomera Test Range, and there are currently four major mines (2013) – Challenger, Prominent Hill, Peculiar Knob, and Cairn Hill. There is also a long-established precious gems (mainly opal) field near the Coober Pedy end of the Stuart Highway, which cuts through the middle of the Range.

==Etymology==
The settlement draws its name, &quot;woomera&quot;, from a suggestion from RAAF Group Captain Alfred George Pither and was subsequently chosen by the Board of the Long Range Weapons Establishment in April 1947. The new Village was established on Commonwealth land procured for the purpose, and named after the Aboriginal spear throwing implement the woomera which extends the range a spear can be thrown.

==History==

===Establishment===
Woomera, formerly a rocket range site located north-west of Port Augusta, shares its name with an Aboriginal throwing tool. Construction of Woomera Village began in mid-1947 to cater for thousands of people moving there as part of the Anglo-Australian Project. The project lasted for 34 years and saw Woomera become one of the most secret allied establishments in operation during the Cold War. During its heyday (1949–71), the village population reached around 7,000 as people lived and worked at Woomera and at Koolymilka campsite near Range Head, approximately west of Woomera village within the Woomera Prohibited Area. However, by the end of the 1960s, the Anglo-Australian Joint Project was rapidly winding down following the UK Government&#x27;s reduction in further experimental work.

Woomera Village initially operated as a &quot;closed town&quot; between 1947 and 1982, when the facility supported the operations of the Woomera Rocket Range during the Anglo-Australia Project. Since 1982, the general public has been able to visit and stay at Woomera. However, only Australian Government (mostly Department of Defence) personnel and contractors to the Commonwealth are able to live at Woomera on a permanent basis. The settlement was established in 1947 as a result of the Department of Defence establishment of the adjacent rocket testing range. The Woomera Village grew rapidly from 1950. A school opened that year with two teachers and by 1955 had grown to be a &quot;Higher Primary&quot; school from Year 1 to Intermediate (Year 10) with over 300 pupils.

Following its construction over 1947–53, Woomera Village essentially operated under a specialised Commonwealth/Defence township management model rather than a local government (council) model. At the height of its operations (1947–99), over 7,000 people lived in Woomera Village. To service the needs of the town during this period, the Woomera Board, staffed by members of the Defence community at Woomera elected to the Board by town residents, essentially acted in the role normally provided by a local government council. However, the creation of a Defence Estate management organisation in the 1990s shifted the focus of the Board&#x27;s activities away from estate and infrastructure management toward principally that of a base welfare organisation supporting the small permanent community and the large number of transit Defence personnel who deploy to Woomera each year. Woomera Village, when originally established, was administered by the Long Range Weapons Establishment (LRWE) under the terms of the Anglo-Australian Joint Project. LRWE was based at to the north of Adelaide city, the site now occupied by Defence Science and Technology Group (DSTG).

When the Anglo-Australian Joint Project began to wind down in the early 1970s, the village population began to rapidly drop from its peak of about 7000 residents in the mid-1960s. However, with the establishment of the USAF/ADF Joint Defence Communications Facility in 1969 at the nearby Nurrungar site, approximately south of Woomera, along with its 1100 permanent staff, the village population stabilized at around 4,500 people (including around 800 children). In the late 1990s, as the Nurrungar program was winding down, the ADF reassessed the role of Woomera in its future force structure. What became apparent to the ADF at that time was that the Woomera Test Range was the only land-based test range left in the Western world capable of testing the next (or what is now termed &quot;5th&quot;) generation of weapons systems within a fully instrumented, land-based, specialized test and evaluation range. This assessment was to result, positively, in redefining the future role and strategic importance of the Woomera Range Complex within Australia&#x27;s long-term Defence requirements.

===Defence facilities===

Woomera Village is a Department of Defence–owned-and-operated facility. RAAF Base Woomera, when it was established in January 2015, also included the RAAF Woomera Airfield, which is approximately north of Woomera Village. The aerodrome lies within the &quot;Red Zone&quot; of the Woomera Prohibited Area (WPA), and public access to this part of the base is not permitted. Woomera Village, however, is within a &quot;Green Zone&quot; of the WPA and thus public access to the facilities and services of Woomera, including the several museums located in this historic site, is permitted year-round. Visitors may also stay in the Defence-operated Eldo Hotel, and there is a privately operated public caravan park at the entrance to Woomera Village.

While the WRC operates under the higher management of Woomera Range Headquarters (WRHQ), located at RAAF Base Edinburgh, the operation of the Base itself is co-managed by the RAAF&#x27;s Combat Support Group (CSG) and Defence Estate and Infrastructure Group (DEIG). CSG focus on the operational aspects of the base&#x27;s role, while DEIG focuses on ensuring the base&#x27;s (and the Range&#x27;s) facilities and general infrastructure remains fit-for-purpose to support the Range&#x27;s activities. Woomera Village has always been, and continues to be, the domestic support facility for the Woomera Range Complex.

, the WPA covers an area of approximately and forms the essential ground area of the whole Range Complex. The Nurrungar Test Area (NTA) is south of Woomera, and although not within the WPA, it is under the operational control of Woomera Range Headquarters in Adelaide. The WPA is the world&#x27;s largest land-based instrumented defence systems test and evaluation range facility.

The complex was established in support of the Anglo-Australian Joint Project. This cold-war project focussed on the development of long-range weapons systems, principally to counter the growing intercontinental ballistic missile threat from the Soviet Union. The cold-war heyday of the Range was 1947 to about 1972. In 1980, the Anglo-Australia Project was closed and the range itself saw little use until about 1991, when the RAAF&#x27;s Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) took over the old instrumented range from Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). Since that time, the RAAF has gradually assumed full control of the entire facility. The complex today is much smaller than it was in 1947, but still covers one-seventh of South Australia. Although there are now several major mines established within the WPA, the Woomera support base is the only permanently established township facility in the WPA.

Officially, the village area is referred to as &quot;Base Sector South&quot; of RAAF Base Woomera, and like RAAF Williams at Point Cook in Victoria, this part of the complex is open to public access. This is principally so that tourists can access the significant historical displays and museums which cover the range&#x27;s air and space activities since its establishment in 1947. At the Woomera Heritage Centre, there are also displays covering the Indigenous and Pioneer heritage of the region. In particular, there is a dedicated section on Len Beadell, who became something of an outback legend as a Royal Australian Survey Corps Sergeant surveyor (1947–48) and road builder (1953–63). There is also a memorial cairn for Len Beadell and his wife Anne in the nearby Woomera Cemetery.

At the , the village had 146 permanent residents, whereas the operation of the complex may be up to an additional 500–700 personnel per day. Public visitors (estimated at in excess of 70,000 per year) generally find Woomera village to be a very quiet place. Principally this is due to the fact that the base is essentially the dinner, bed, and breakfast facility for Defence personnel. Today, the complex embraces a much wider range of Defence systems technology and tactics testing and evaluation activities. In terms of space activities, only a small number of sub-orbital sounding rocket tests are conducted. In June 2010, however, Woomera hosted the return of the Hayabusa Deep Space Probe. This was the first planned space re-entry to Australian soil and created another milestone for the Range.

==Settlement history==

===Nurrungar project===

In 1969, as the Anglo-Australia Project was winding down, the United States Air Force (USAF) began construction and installation of the Nurrungar Joint Tracking Facility. This facility was located approximately south of Woomera. Over the next 30 years, this project ensured the maintenance of Woomera village infrastructure, with improvements and modernization of facilities. During the period of operations, around 1,100 USAF and ADF personnel and their families were accommodated at Woomera, and the population was around 4,000.

===The new era of Woomera===
When the Nurrungar Project came to an end in 1999, the future of the village looked bleak. However, the RAAF was set to take over the range following a long-term study of Defence needs through to 2035, which found that the Woomera Test Range was the only test and evaluation range left in the western world capable of testing the next generation of ADF defence systems within its land borders – and it could be utilized all year round given its climatic advantages. Additionally, the Federal Government decided to establish several immigration detention centres around the country to deal with a growing number of illegal immigrants and asylum seekers arriving by sea, and Woomera was chosen as a site for such a facility.

The establishment of the Woomera Immigration Detention Centre in 1999, through the refurbishment of the original Woomera Village construction camp at &quot;Woomera West&quot;, eventually brought in new permanent staff (as the Nurrungar people were leaving) to settle and maintain the village population at around 1,200. The immigration detention centre, however, proved to be a highly controversial facility, and it closed in early 2003 after only about 36 months of operation, at which point the land and buildings were handed back to the Defence Department.

===Camp Rapier===
Following the closure of the Immigration Detention Centre, and the return of the site to the ADF, Woomera West was redesigned, altered, and re-established as a secure defence garrison support facility and renamed Camp Rapier. It is now frequently used by the Australian Army and squadrons of the RAAF&#x27;s Airfield Defence Guards as a base camp for specialized training and testing activities. It also has had a detachment of Australian Air Force Cadets from South Australia stay there.

===Post-2003===
Post-2003, the village population stabilized at about 400, but has subsequently dropped to around 150–200. When the RAAF assumed operational command of Woomera in 1999, there was an increase in the number of temporary residents associated with the conduct of test and evaluation activities on the range. In 2009, Woomera village was the largest ADF domestic base support facility in Australia, and the village is open to public access. There is a high visitation rate by tourists to view the National Missile Park in the centre of the village (which features aircraft, rockets, bombs, and missiles covering the full period of the Range&#x27;s operations), the Woomera Heritage Centre (which features an introductory audiovisual presentation and an interpretive gallery that tells the story of the site), and the Community Museum that is maintained by the village&#x27;s volunteer community board and which is located within the missile park precinct.

Generally, the residents of Woomera are defence workers or contractors. There are no privately owned homes in the village, although some are leased to agencies such as the Bureau of Meteorology. The facilities in the village include a gym, hotel, swimming pool, hospital, cinema, school, two museums, and missile park. There is also a supermarket, community radio station (107.3 Triple-R FM Woomera – &quot;rocket range radio&quot;), post office, bowling alley, a football sports club (Sporties), Returned Services League, Thrift Shop, and Bowling Club.

The village is jointly managed by the RAAF and the Defence Estate &amp; Infrastructure Group (E&amp;IG). Garrison support services for the complex are provided by Defence contractors managed by E&amp;IG. These services include care and maintenance of the base and range infrastructure, messing, accommodation, security, and limited emergency response and airfield service as well as operational support to Defence activities on the Range.

==Climate==
Woomera has a hot desert climate (Köppen: &quot;BWh&quot;) with hot summers, mild winters and low rainfall year-round. The highest recorded temperature is on 20 December 2019, whilst the lowest is on 12 August 1966. 
==Woomera village today==
The population of Woomera is about 136 permanent residents. However, this number can quadruple with the passage of personnel moving in and out of the base as part of range trials activities. 40 years ago, the people who conducted the trials also lived at Woomera; however, with modern communications technology, only the people who provide the range support services now need to live at Woomera. Annually, a total of about 5,000 to 6,000 people deploy to Woomera to conduct tests, trials, and training activities at the Range.

The management of the Range&#x27;s infrastructure is the responsibility of Defence Support and Reform Group (DSRG), but the Woomera Board is a long-standing and integral part of the base&#x27;s local support network. The Woomera Board is composed of five elected members from the village&#x27;s permanent residents, and four members who are appointed by the current Base Support Manager. The aim of the Woomera Board is to build the sense of community, given its remote location. The Board also prints a weekly news letter – &quot;Gibber Gabber&quot;.

The base is located in the Woomera Prohibited Area (WPA) and it is an RAAF establishment. However, similar to the RAAF Base at Point Cook, Woomera is open to the visiting public. Non-Defence visitors to Woomera are able to stay at the Eldo Hotel, which offers 400 beds in a varying range of formats. The hotel reception, including the &quot;Oasis&quot; bar and restaurant, is located in the former Eldo administration facility. Rooms are generally located close to the main hotel facility and some blocks have names such as &quot;Redstone&quot;, &quot;Black Knight&quot;, &quot;Blue Steel&quot; and &quot;Skylark&quot; – all former rocket or missile systems once tested at Woomera. The nearby &quot;Traveller&#x27;s Village Caravan Park&quot; is a privately operated venture centred around the old &quot;senior ranks&#x27; mess&quot; facility at the entrance to the base from the main road. It mostly services the motor home and backpacker travellers passing through Woomera.

==Tourism==

Woomera&#x27;s attractions include the Woomera National Aerospace and Missile Park, located near the centre of the village. This park features missiles and rockets that were developed and tested at Woomera over the last 60 years, as well as a number of aircraft which were used in trials at Woomera. The Woomera Heritage Centre, which was the former recreation centre for USAF personnel and their families from Nurrungar, features a cafe, a tenpin bowling alley (which was installed by the US Air Force personnel in the 1990s and is still in good working order), a modern interactive display and interpretive centre covering the full life of the Range, a souvenir shop, and a significant display of regional history. This display also features the story of Len Beadell, the famous surveyor who laid out the original range across vast tracts of the Australian Outback stretching from Woomera to the northwest coast of Western Australia. Next to Missile Park, there is a museum featuring range artifacts and the activities and people who lived and worked at Woomera in the early years. This museum is located in the former Church of England, one of four former churches which existed in Woomera. Other attractions include a movie theatre (but movie screenings might be infrequent), swimming centre, a well-stocked general store, and bottle shop, along with two main clubs which offer counter meals on a Thursday (RSL Club) and Friday (Sports Club) nights. Woomera is a haven for observing and understanding Australia&#x27;s desert flora and fauna, and there is a space observatory which operates one night a week or by appointment.

The historic precinct of the town attracts visitors to view local attractions including the Missile Park, Heritage Centre, History Museum and other attractions such as Butement Square, the Eldo Hotel (formerly the &quot;Eldo Mess&quot; for personnel working with the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO). There were three other &quot;Messes&quot;: Senior, Staff and Junior Staff (&quot;Jazza&quot;) based on military ranking, and then Eldo), and the local observatory. Approximately 65,000 tourists a year visit Woomera, with about half of that number going on to visit Roxby Downs (location of the BHP Olympic Dam Mine).

<text>South Antrim is a parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom House of Commons. The current MP is Robin Swann of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), first elected in the 2024 general election.

==Boundaries==

From 1885, this constituency was one of four county divisions of the former Antrim constituency. It comprised the baronies of Massereene Upper, Massereene Lower, that part of the barony Antrim Upper in the parish of Antrim, that part of the barony of Toome Upper not in the constituency of Mid Antrim, that part of the barony of Belfast Upper not in the constituency of East Antrim, and so much of the Parliamentary Borough of Belfast as was in the County of Antrim.

It returned one Member of Parliament. In 1922, it was merged into a new Antrim constituency.

The seat was re-created in 1950 when the old Antrim two MP constituency was abolished as part of the final move to single member seats. The seat was reduced in size for the 1974 general election, with the town of Carrickfergus and the areas between it and Larne town transferred to North Antrim. Additionally some territory was transferred to Belfast West. Despite these changes, the seat had become the largest in the entire United Kingdom by the time of the Northern Ireland Assembly elections of 1982, by which time its electorate had passed the 131,000 mark. For the 1983 general election Northern Ireland received new seats. Consequently, South Antrim was significantly reduced, losing a lot of territory to the new seats of East Antrim and Lagan Valley as well as minor sections to Belfast West, Belfast North and Upper Bann. The new South Antrim which was fought for the 1983 election contained only 43% of the previous seat. In 1995 there were minor changes around the borders with North Belfast and West Belfast. The seat fought at the 2005 election encompassed the entirety of the district of Antrim and part of the district of Newtownabbey.

Following consultation of boundary changes across Northern Ireland, the altered South Antrim constituency fought at the 2010 general election is made up as follows:

*Glenavy from Lisburn City government area
*Ballyclare North, Ballyclare South, Ballyduff, Ballynure, Ballyrobert, Burnthill, Carnmoney, Doagh, Hawthorne, Mallusk, and Mossley, from Newtownabbey
*The district of Antrim

== History ==
South Antrim is an overwhelmingly unionist constituency which once had the strongest vote for the Ulster Unionist Party anywhere in the province. From 1886 to 1974 the Conservative and Unionist members of the United Kingdom House of Commons formed a single Parliamentary party, and they continuously represented South Antrim.

In 1951, it was one of the last four seats to be uncontested in a British General Election. In the 1979 general election James Molyneaux had the largest majority of any MP in the entire of the United Kingdom, helped also by having one of the largest electorates.

The boundary changes in 1983 reduced the Ulster Unionist vote somewhat, with a significant portion now contained in the new Lagan Valley (which Molyneaux then contested) but the constituency still gave strong results for the party.

However, in April 2000 the Ulster Unionist incumbent, Clifford Forsythe, died suddenly. The ensuing by-election took place amidst a fierce political struggle between the Ulster Unionist Party and the Democratic Unionist Party over the Good Friday Agreement, an agreement that the UUP were themselves split over. The DUP had not contested the seat at the previous general election but on this occasion stood William McCrea, the former MP for Mid Ulster, who campaigned strongly on the DUP&#x27;s refusal to co-operate with Sinn Féin in the absence of arms decommissioning by the IRA. The local UUP branch selected David Burnside to contest the seat who declared that he had supported the Good Friday Agreement at the time that it was signed but had since become disillusioned with its implementation. As a result, many commentators predicted that whatever the outcome of the election it was a severe blow for the UUP&#x27;s leader David Trimble. On a low turnout amidst a fierce contest McCrea narrowly won the seat.

Burnside was nominated again to contest the seat in the 2001 general election in which he overturned McCrea&#x27;s majority, aided by tactical voting by SDLP and Alliance voters. However the DUP were eager to regain the seat and in the 2003 Assembly election they outpolled the UUP by 298 votes. In the 2005 general election McCrea defeated Burnside in their third contest, but with a noticeably lower swing than those garnered by other DUP candidates who ousted UUP MPs. McCrea held the seat in the 2010 general election with a reduced majority. The seat was won by the UUP at the 2015 general election following the defeat of McCrea by Danny Kinahan. The DUP regained the seat following the 2017 general election with the defeat of Kinahan by Paul Girvan. Girvan would hold the seat until 2024, when Robin Swann, a former Health Minister who led Northern Ireland&#x27;s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, retook the seat for the UUP on a 12.3% swing, giving them a seat in the Commons for the first time in 7 years.

<doc id="863620" wikidata="Q1020699" url="?curid=863620" title="Savannah College of Art and Design">
<text>Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD) is a private art school with locations in Savannah, Georgia; Atlanta, Georgia; and Lacoste, France. It was founded in 1978 to provide degrees in programs not yet offered in the southeast of the United States. The university enrolls more than 16,000 students from across the United States and around the world with international students comprising up to 17 percent of the student population. SCAD is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges and other professional accrediting bodies.

==History==

Richard G. Rowan, Paula S. Wallace, May L. Poetter and Paul E. Poetter legally incorporated the Savannah College of Art and Design September 29, 1978. In September 1979, the university first began offering classes with four staff members, seven faculty members, and 71 students. Initially, the school offered eight majors: ceramics, graphic design, historic preservation, textile design, interior design, painting, photography, and printmaking. In May 1981, the first graduate received a degree. The following year, the first graduating class received degrees. In 1982, the enrollment grew to more than 500 students, then to 1,000 in 1986, and 2,000 in 1989. In 2014, the university enrolled more than 11,000 students.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a rash of faculty suicides prompted a nervous reaction from school administrators. The unrest led a competing art school to open downtown, igniting an &quot;all-out war.&quot;

Student unrest grew in the early 1990s regarding student representation within the school, culminating in 1992 with the detonation of an explosive device at the administration building, and two more later that year, at the Savannah Civic Center.

SCAD opened a study abroad location in Lacoste, France in 2002 that provides programming for the various academic departments offered by the university&#x27;s degree-granting locations. It launched an online learning program in 2003 that &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranks as among the best for bachelor&#x27;s programs in the nation. In 2005 the university opened a location in Midtown Atlanta that merged with the Atlanta College of Art in 2006. In September 2010, SCAD opened a Hong Kong location in the Sham Shui Po district.
Richard Rowan (who was married to Paula Wallace at the time) served as president of the college from its inception in 1978 until April 2000, when SCAD&#x27;s board of trustees promoted him to chancellor. As chancellor, Rowan spent most of his time traveling and recruiting international students and staff. In 2001, he resigned the job and left the college.

Paula S. Wallace is the current president. Wallace, formerly Paula S. Rowan, served as SCAD&#x27;s provost and dean of academics before becoming president. As president, Wallace directs the internal management of the institution. Wallace has led the collaboration for several annual events, such as the Sidewalk Arts Festival, Savannah Film Festival, a Fashion Show, SCAD Style, deFine Art Festival, Art Educators&#x27; Forum and Rising Star. Questions have been raised about the unusual pay packages granted to Wallace and her family. Paula Wallace received $9.6 million in compensation in 2014, and 13 members of her family have received $60 million over the past 20 years.

The university&#x27;s second museum, SCAD FASH Museum of Fashion + Film, opened in 2015, at SCAD Atlanta.

In 2018, a student started a petition calling for better mental health services for students after two suicides occurred after the beginning of the 2018 academic year. In 2019, SCAD increased the number of professional counseling staff and created Bee Well, which provides virtual and physical counseling, wellness workshops, and a 24/7 toll-free emotional support hotline.

In March 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, SCAD transitioned to entirely virtual learning for all students, while allowing international students and others to remain in residence halls following social distancing protocols.

In June 2020, SCAD discontinued studies at its Hong Kong location, citing concerns about student safety and academic quality following the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests and the COVID-19 pandemic. The North Kowloon Magistracy will be returned to the city.

In June 2020, in the midst of Black Lives Matter protests around the U.S., SCAD created an office of inclusion and announced related initiatives to address systemic racism, including the addition of 15 endowed scholarships for Black students.

==Campus==

===Facilities===
SCAD&#x27;s efforts to work with the city of Savannah to preserve its architectural heritage include restoring buildings for use as college facilities, for which it has been recognized by the American Institute of Architects, the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the Historic Savannah Foundation and the Victorian Society of America. The college campus includes 67 buildings throughout the grid-and-park system of downtown Savannah. Many buildings are on the 22 squares of the old town, which are laden with monuments, live oaks and a Southern-Gothic feel.

Located in Atlanta&#x27;s Midtown, SCAD Atlanta includes classroom and exhibition space, computer labs, library, photography darkrooms, printmaking and sculpture studios, a dining hall, fitness center, swimming pool and residence hall. SCAD Atlanta&#x27;s Ivy Hall (also known as the Edward C. Peters House) opened in 2008 after extensive restoration. In 2009, SCAD Atlanta opened the Digital Media Center.

The SCAD Lacoste campus is made up of 15th- and 16th-century structures. The campus includes an art gallery, guest houses, computer lab and printmaking lab. In Hong Kong, SCAD occupies renovated historic North Kowloon Magistracy Building, with more than . It is equipped with classrooms, meeting areas, computer labs, an art gallery and library.

The college&#x27;s first academic building was the Savannah Volunteer Guards Armory, which was purchased and renovated in 1979. Built in 1892, the Romanesque Revival red brick structure is included on the National Register of Historic Places. Originally named Preston Hall, the building was renamed Poetter Hall in honor of co-founders May and Paul Poetter. SCAD soon expanded rapidly, acquiring buildings in Savannah&#x27;s downtown historic and Victorian districts, restoring old and often derelict buildings that had exhausted their original functions.
The college operates four libraries: Jen Library in Savannah, Georgia; ACA Library in Atlanta, Georgia; Hong Kong Library in Hong Kong; and Lacoste Library in Lacoste, France. There is also a large amount of resources available via the eLearning Library.

The most notable of the group is Jen Library for the size of its collection. The Jen Library houses approximately 42,000 books, 11,000 bound volumes of periodicals, and 1,600 videotapes in an 85,000 square foot building. The building, itself, once served as a Maas Brothers department store before being acquired and repurposed by the university. Its structural and design features include a large glass staircase and floor-to-ceiling windows on opposite corners of the building. The Jen Library houses multiple rare collections containing both books and visual arts materials including the Don Bluth Collection of Animation and the Newton Collection of British and American Art. It is also home to the Gutstein Gallery, an assemblage of contemporary art from both nationally recognized artists as well as SCAD alumni.

In April 2021, the college announced plans of expanding its film and digital media studio, which would make it the largest college movie studio in the country. Plans include a new digital stage and three new soundstages house at a 10.9-acre backlot.

===Student housing===
In Atlanta, the university provides three residence halls, ACA Residence Hall of SCAD, Brookwood Courtyard, and the Forty. The Hong Kong residence hall is the Hong Kong Gold Coast residences. The residence halls in Savannah are Barnard Village, Boundary Village, Montgomery House, Oglethorpe House, Turner House, Chatham House, Victory Village, Turner Annex, and the Hive student housing complex, consisting of Apiary, Bumble, Colony, Dance, Everest, Flower, Garden, and Honey at The Hive. Students in Lacoste live in Maison Pitot, Fortunee, Renard, Murier, Olivier, and Basse.

===Museums and galleries===
SCAD operates museums, galleries, and exhibition spaces across its campuses, including the SCAD Museum of Art, located on the site of the former Central of Georgia Railway headquarters in Savannah, Georgia, and SCAD FASH Museum of Fashion + Film in Atlanta, Georgia. Rafael Gomes is the director of fashion exhibitions and has curated several shows including ‘Robert Fairer Backstage Pass: Dior, Galliano, Jacobs, and McQueen.&#x27;

University galleries include Gutstein Gallery, Pei Ling Chan Gallery, Pinnacle Gallery and La Galerie Bleue in Savannah; Gallery 1600, Trois Gallery and Gallery See in Atlanta; and Moot Gallery in Hong Kong.

==Academics==
SCAD offers fine art degrees. In Fall 2019, SCAD enrolled more than 14,840 students (12,167 undergraduates; 2,673 postgraduates) from all 50 states, and more than 110 countries. As of 2020, international student enrollment was 17 percent.

Since 2010, guests have included artists such as Lawrence Weiner, Marilyn Minter, Hank Willis Thomas, Carlos Cruz-Diez, and others.

===Sidewalk Arts and Sand Arts Festivals===
Each April, SCAD hosts the Sidewalk Arts Festival in downtown Forsyth Park. The festival consists primarily of the chalk-drawing competition, which is divided into group and individual categories of students, alumni and prospective students. Similar is the Sand Arts Festival. This sand festival is held every spring on the beaches of nearby Tybee Island. Contestants can work alone or in groups of up to four people. The competition is divided into sand relief, sand sculpture, sand castle and wind sculpture divisions.

===Other events===
Individual departments host yearly and quarterly shows to promote student work. Annual festivals such as SCAD AnimationFest, SCAD GamingFest, SCAD aTVfest, and events such as SCAD Style and offer opportunities for networking.

Students also frequent en masse non-SCAD-affiliated events if they are held in the historic district, such as the Savannah Jazz Festival and the St. Patrick&#x27;s Day celebration.

==Controversies==
===Clarence Thomas Center for Historic Preservation===
SCAD has received repeated backlash for naming one of its academic halls after Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. Thomas was born and raised in Savannah, and served as an altar boy at a convent located at 439 East Broad Street. In 2010, the building was acquired by the school and renamed the Clarence Thomas Center for Historic Preservation, with Thomas attending the dedication. Following the renewed interest of the Anita Hill hearings during Brett Kavanaugh’s Supreme Court nomination, several petitions were formed by SCAD students and alumni demanding the school change the building’s name. Despite one petition receiving over 2,000 signatures, SCAD refused to rename the building. Students also launched a petition to keep Thomas’ name on the building, which received over 18,000 signatures. In 2022, in response to the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade with the decision of Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization, SCAD once again received backlash for the building’s name. Thomas voted with the majority holding that the U.S. Constitution did not confer a right to abortion, returning to individual states the power to regulate any aspect of abortion not protected by federal law, a decision which sparked protests across the country and in Savannah. Another petition was started by a SCAD student which amassed over 2,000 signatures. Following this renewed backlash, SCAD removed the sign with Thomas’ name from the building, but issued no statement on the matter.

===Impact on Savannah===
SCAD has had a significant impact on tourism in Savannah. In a report published by SCAD in 2018, the school claimed to have generated over $3 billion for the city and attracted 14.5 million visitors. A similar report by SCAD in 2020 claimed that the school’s Atlanta and Savannah campuses brought in $766.2 million in annual economic impact for the state. Yet many Savannah residents and SCAD students have expressed dissatisfaction with SCAD’s growth, specifically in Savannah. SCAD does not pay property taxes in Savannah, and the continued growth of the school’s facilities has raised property taxes in many of Savannah’s lower-income neighborhoods. In 2023, the first large-scale protest against SCAD’s expansion was held by community members at the SCAD Museum of Art in response to SCAD’s continued displacement of black families in Savannah. The school has issued no comment on the matter.

In 2022, it was reported that SCAD has claimed &quot;nearly $800 million of property out of local tax revenue&quot; while luring luxury developers to further displace local residents. 

===Racial discrimination lawsuits===
Between 2020 and 2022, three former instructors at SCAD filed suit claiming racial discrimination and retaliation for speaking out.

===Bobby Zarem lawsuit===
In 2014, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that former SCAD employee and influential publicist Bobby Zarem was suing SCAD for dismissing him after he spoke out about a series of sexual assaults on campus. 

===Censure of SCAD===
SCAD has been officially censured by the American Association of University Professors for issues surrounding academic freedom, tenure, and the dismissal of faculty members. The first censure came in 1993. After working with the AAUP to overturn this ruling in 2010, the organization and school came to an impasse and again, in 2012, the AAUP renewed its censure. SCAD remains on the AAUP censure list.

<doc id="863622" wikidata="Q5611673" url="?curid=863622" title="Growing Without Schooling">
<text>Growing Without Schooling (GWS) was a homeschooling newsletter focused primarily on unschooling and deschooling. It was founded in 1977 by educator John Holt, and was published in Boston, Massachusetts. Reportedly the first such publication in the United States, it was read worldwide, and helped to catalyze the early growth and development of the homeschooling movement. Publication ceased in 2001 after 143 issues.

==Content and philosophy==
The newsletter included letters with questions and advice about homeschooling, interviews with participants in homeschooling, directories of resources, news items, and analysis. One common feature addressed challenges homeschooling families face, such as legal hurdles, skeptical grandparents, the need for parents to relearn material, and balancing homeschooling with other work for parents. Space was also devoted to connecting people with people in similar positions, such as observant Jewish homeschooling families, single parents interested in homeschooling, and parents of children with intellectual disabilities.

Many articles criticized schools. These criticisms expressed concerns that schools stifle student motivation and creativity, interfere with learning, mistreat students with disabilities, maintain class hierarchy, and monopolize resources that would be better invested in libraries, museums and community centers.

== Leadership ==
Following Holt&#x27;s death on September 14, 1985, Holt Associates took over the newsletter. Patrick Farenga served as Managing Editor with Editors John Holt and Donna Richoux, Susannah Sheffer joined as Associate Editor for Issue #52, Editor by Issue #58. Meredith Collins later served as editor.

== Legacy ==
One of the first documentaries about homeschooling, &quot;Grown Without Schooling&quot;, was named in homage to the magazine and profiled several of the grown homeschoolers who had written for it. Its producer, Peter Kowalke, also wrote occasionally for the magazine.

&quot;Everywhere All the Time: A New Deschooling Reader&quot;, edited by Matt Hern and published in 2008, includes a chapter on &quot;Growing without Schooling&quot;.

<text>The Chrysler turbine engine is a series of gas turbine engines developed by Chrysler intended to be used in road vehicles. In 1954, Chrysler Corporation disclosed the development and successful road testing of a production model Plymouth sport coupe which was powered by a turbine engine.

==Development==
Tests of the Chrysler Turbine were first run in 1954 and proved successful enough to convince project lead George Huebner of the engine&#x27;s viability for further development.

With the aim of keeping price competitive with its contemporaries, the team sought to address concerns with the engine of throttle response, noise, and to see if it was even possible to power a car using a jet engine. Likewise, new materials were developed to be resistant to the high temperatures of the engine&#x27;s combustion chamber while remaining economical to manufacture at the scale of a mass-produced automobile.

A number of benefits were also identified; the turbine engine being conceptually simpler than a piston engine drove an attendant reduction in parts count from the roughly 300 of a typical engine to only 60. This resulted principally in a longer engine life, longer service intervals, and substantially improved power density over a conventional engine of comparable output. Numerous factors of the turbine&#x27;s performance were identified as superior to its piston contemporaries – particularly ease of cold starting, reduced noise and vibration, and a resistance to stalling under sudden load.

==Testing==
The first successful test of a gas turbine engine in a car (CR1) took place in 1954 at Chrysler&#x27;s testing grounds. In 1956, the first successful cross-country trip using a turbine-engined car took place using a Plymouth Belvedere.

Further engineering work resulted in the second generation (CR2), which improved fuel economy and increased horsepower.

In 1961, a third-generation engine (CR2A) was installed in a 1962 Dodge Dart, which successfully drove from New York City to Los Angeles, through snowstorms, rain and heavy winds.

The fourth-generation engine, installed in the Chrysler Turbine Car, was put into use in 1963. This engine runs at up to 44,500 revolutions per minute, according to the owner&#x27;s manual, and could operate using diesel fuel, unleaded gasoline, kerosene, JP-4 jet fuel, and even vegetable oil. The engine can run on virtually anything with combustible properties and &quot;Chrysler claimed the turbine could gulp everything from peanut oil to Chanel No. 5.&quot; The then-incumbent President of Mexico tested this theory by running one of the first cars—successfully—on tequila, after Chrysler engineers confirmed that the car would operate successfully. No air/fuel adjustments are required to switch from one fuel type to another and the only evidence of which fuel was used is the odor of the exhaust.

The turbine spins on simple sleeve bearings for vibration-free running. Its simplicity offers the potential for long life, and because no combustion contaminants enter engine oil, no oil changes are considered necessary. The 1963 Turbine&#x27;s engine generated and an instant of torque at stall speed, making it good for 0 to 60 mph (0 to 97 km/h) in 12 seconds at an ambient temperature of —it can sprint quicker if the ambient air was cooler and denser.

The lack of many moving parts and the lack of liquid coolant eases maintenance, while the exhaust does not contain carbon monoxide, uncombusted carbon, or raw hydrocarbons. Nevertheless, the turbine generates nitrogen oxides and the challenge of limiting them proved an ongoing problem throughout development.

The power turbine is connected, without a torque converter, through a gear reduction unit to an only moderately modified TorqueFlite automatic transmission. The flow of the combustion gases between the gas generator and free power turbine provides the same functionality as a torque converter but without using a conventional liquid medium. Twin rotating recuperators transfer exhaust heat to the inlet air, greatly improving fuel economy. Varying stator blades prevent excessive top end speeds and provide engine braking on deceleration.

Throttle lag and exhaust gas temperatures at idle plagued generations 1 and 2; Chrysler was able to remedy or mitigate these to some degree. Acceleration lag, however, remained a problem, and fuel consumption was excessive, although it improved with each generation. Acceleration was excellent provided the turbine was spun up (by applying power) prior to releasing the brakes. The Turbine Car also featured a fully stainless steel exhaust system, the exits of which were flat in cross section. This was intended to spread the exhaust gases thinly and thus cool them further, in order to allow the vehicle to stand in traffic without risking damage to following traffic. The combustor, or burner, was primitive by the standards of modern turbojet engines. A single reverse-flow canister featuring a more-or-less standard spark plug for ignition was employed. Had the engine been further developed, annular combustion chambers along with a second power turbine might have improved power and economy even more. The transmission has an &quot;idle&quot; position instead of &quot;neutral&quot;.

After the user testing period completed, Chrysler collected all of the cars, destroying 40 out of the original 50. Chrysler kept two, then sent the remaining examples to museums.

==Later development and project end==
Chrysler&#x27;s turbine engine program did not end with the Chrysler Turbine Car. A new coupe body, which was to become the 1966 Dodge Charger was considered for a new fifth-generation turbine engine. However, Chrysler went on to develop a sixth generation gas-turbine engine which finally met US nitrogen oxide regulations, and installed it in a 1966 Dodge Coronet, though it was never introduced to the public.

A smaller, lighter, seventh generation engine was produced in the early 1970s, when the company received a grant from the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for further development, and a one-off, special bodied, turbine Chrysler LeBaron was built in 1977 as a prelude to a production run. However, by 1978 the company was encountering significant financial difficulties and new CEO Lee Iacocca needed U.S. government loan guarantees to avoid bankruptcy. A government condition of that 1979 deal was that the gas-turbine program be abandoned because they believed it was &quot;too risky&quot; for an auto company of Chrysler&#x27;s size.

While the automotive division of Chrysler never mass-produced a turbine powered vehicle, Chrysler Defense (later General Dynamics Land Systems) would ultimately employ the unrelated Honeywell AGT1500 in the M1 Abrams Main Battle Tank.

<doc id="863626" wikidata="Q708273" url="?curid=863626" title="Tainted Love">
<text>&quot;Tainted Love&quot; is a song composed by Ed Cobb, formerly of American group the Four Preps, which was originally recorded by Gloria Jones in 1964. In 1981, the song attained worldwide fame after being covered and reworked by British synth-pop duo Soft Cell for their album &quot;Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret&quot;. The song has since been covered by numerous groups and artists.

==Gloria Jones versions (1964; released 1965) (second recording 1976)==
American artist Gloria Jones made the first recording of &quot;Tainted Love&quot; in 1964. Glen Campbell played lead guitar. The song was written and produced by Ed Cobb and arranged by Lincoln Mayorga. It was the B-side of her 1965 single &quot;My Bad Boy&#x27;s Comin&#x27; Home&quot;, which was a commercial flop, failing to chart on either the US or the UK. According to Nick Talevski, before Jones recorded the song, Cobb had offered it to the Standells, whom he managed and produced, but they rejected it. The Standells say that the song was never offered to them, and that they were not signed to Cobb&#x27;s company Greengrass Productions until 1966, some two years after Jones&#x27;s recording.

In 1973, British club DJ Richard Searling purchased a copy of the almost decade-old single while on a trip to the United States. The track&#x27;s Motown-influenced sound (featuring a fast tempo, horns, electric rhythm guitar and female backing vocals) fit in perfectly with the music favoured by those involved in the UK&#x27;s Northern soul club scene of the early 1970s, and Searling popularised the song at the Northern soul club Va Va&#x27;s in Bolton, and later, at Wigan Casino.

Owing to the new-found underground popularity of the song, Jones re-recorded &quot;Tainted Love&quot; in 1976 and released it as a single, but it also failed to chart. This version was released on her album &quot;Vixen&quot; and was produced by her boyfriend Marc Bolan.

In 2014, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it number 305 in their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time.

==Soft Cell version (1981)==
English synth-pop duo Soft Cell became aware of the song through its status as a UK &quot;Northern soul&quot; hit. In 2010, DJ Ian &quot;Frank&quot; Dewhirst claimed he was the first person to play the song for Marc Almond, the vocalist for Soft Cell. Some time after, Soft Cell began performing the song in their live setlist, choosing it instead of Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons&#x27; &quot;The Night&quot; (a song they would go on to record in 2003). Eventually, a Phonogram Records A&amp;R manager Roger Ames opted the band to record the single at a London-based Advision Studios, with producer Mike Thorne. There, Soft Cell&#x27;s version was recorded in a day and a half with Almond&#x27;s first vocal take being used on the record.

Thorne commented that he was surprised by the choice as he had not been impressed by Jones&#x27;s 1976 version on hearing it, but was impressed by the new arrangement and Almond&#x27;s sinister vocal: &quot;You could smell the coke on that second, Northern Soul version, it was really so over-ramped and so frantic. It was good for the dance floor, but I didn&#x27;t like the record...when Soft Cell performed the song I heard a very novel sound and a very nice voice, so off we went.&quot;

Phonogram Records chose to release &quot;Tainted Love&quot; in 1981 as Soft Cell&#x27;s second single (their first was &quot;Memorabilia&quot;, which did not chart). The label&#x27;s representatives implied that this single would be Soft Cell&#x27;s final release on Some Bizzare if it did not sell. The 12&quot; single version (extended dance version) was a medley, transitioning to a cover of the Supremes&#x27; &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot; halfway through the song, which gives a progressive dimension to this version. Marc Almond said that this decision was not the duo&#x27;s, recounting, &quot;If only we&#x27;d put our own song on it then we would be considerably richer&quot;, while David Ball described the medley as &quot;the most costly idea of our career&quot;.

Thanks to a memorable performance on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; chart show, &quot;Tainted Love&quot; reached number one on the UK Singles Chart, and was known as the best-selling single of 1981 in the UK, until the Official Charts Company recalculated the data in 2021 (giving the title to &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; by The Human League). &quot;Tainted Love&quot; had 1.05 million sales in the UK in 1981, with that total increasing to 1.35 million copies as of August 2017. In 2023, it was listed as the 59th best-selling single of all time in the UK.

Buoyed by the then-dominant new wave sound of the time and released on their album &quot;Non-Stop Erotic Cabaret&quot;, &quot;Tainted Love&quot; became a major hit in the US during the Second British Invasion, with the song spending a then-record breaking 43 weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. On the US chart dated January 16, 1982, the song entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 at number 90. It appeared to peak at number 64 and fell to number 100 on February 27. After spending a second week at number 100, it started climbing again. It took 19 weeks to crack the &quot;American Top 40&quot; and reached number 8 during the summer of 1982.

A video was recorded specially for Soft Cell&#x27;s video album &quot;Non-Stop Exotic Video Show&quot;, directed by Tim Pope and featuring David Ball as a cricketer meeting Marc Almond in a toga on what seems to be Mount Olympus.

In 1996, director Spike Jonze used Soft Cell&#x27;s version of the song in a television commercial for Levi&#x27;s jeans, titled &quot;Doctors&quot;, syncing the song to the sound of a heart rate monitor in a hospital. The television commercial was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Commercial at the 49th Primetime Emmy Awards the following year.

Soft Cell&#x27;s version of &quot;Tainted Love&quot; ranked number 5 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest One Hit Wonders of the 1980s&quot;. It was also heavily sampled on Rihanna&#x27;s 2006 single &quot;SOS&quot; from her album &quot;A Girl Like Me&quot; and the Veronicas&#x27; 2007 single &quot;Hook Me Up&quot; from their album &quot;Hook Me Up&quot;. In 2015, the song was voted by the British public as the nation&#x27;s fourth favourite 1980s number one in a poll for ITV.

===Soft Cell/Marc Almond version (1991)===
A re-recorded version of the song was issued in 1991, seven years after Soft Cell&#x27;s dissolution in 1984, as a tie-in to the compilation album &quot;Memorabilia – The Singles&quot; (which reached number 8 in the UK Albums Chart in June 1991). &quot;Tainted Love &#x27;91&quot; was a follow-up to &quot;Say Hello, Wave Goodbye &#x27;91&quot;, which was another re-recorded/remixed version of an earlier single from the Soft Cell/Marc Almond compilation. &quot;Tainted Love &#x27;91&quot; became another Top 40 hit from the collection and peaked at number 5 in the UK charts, making it Soft Cell&#x27;s sixth Top 10 hit (as records with re-recorded vocals were seen as a new hit by the chart compilers of the time)

The video for the version, directed by Peter Christopherson, features a man pacing at night and dancing with starry apparitions, while Almond sings amongst the stars. Christopherson&#x27;s band Coil had covered &quot;Tainted Love&quot; in 1985, with a music video that included a cameo appearance by Almond.

==Marilyn Manson version (2001)==
American rock band Marilyn Manson covered &quot;Tainted Love&quot; with an arrangement based on Soft Cell&#x27;s version. It was released in November 2001 as a single from the &quot;Not Another Teen Movie&quot; soundtrack. The accompanying music video featured cast members Chyler Leigh, Mia Kirshner, Chris Evans and Jaime Pressly. It was later included as a bonus track on international editions of the band&#x27;s following album, &quot;The Golden Age of Grotesque&quot; in 2003. Manson said that he was not &quot;really thinking about &#x27;80s nostalgia&quot; during the recording, while recognizing it as a main concept behind the soundtrack.

&quot;Tainted Love&quot; topped the charts in Portugal and peaked within the top ten of the charts in the United Kingdom. It also peaked within the top ten of the charts throughout the rest of Europe, including Austria, Denmark, Germany, Italy and Norway. It was nominated for the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Award for Best Single in 2002, and won the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; Award for Best Video. It was also nominated for Best Video at the 2002 &quot;Q&quot; Awards.

<text>Jean Lucien Nicolas Jacoby (March 26, 1891 – September 9, 1936) was a Luxembourgish artist. He won Olympic gold medals in the Olympic art competitions of 1924 and 1928, making him the most successful Olympic artist ever.

== Life ==
After spending his youth in Molsheim in Alsace, Jean Jacoby studied art at the &quot;École des Beaux-Arts&quot; in Strasbourg. He was then a teacher of drawing from 1912 to 1918 at the Lewin-Funcke school in Berlin, then worked in Wiesbaden, before taking over the art department of a printing firm in Strasbourg.

He became internationally known when in 1923 he won the French &quot;Concours de l&#x27;Auto&quot; with his drawing &quot;Hurdle runner&quot;, beating 4,000 other entrants. Jacoby often depicted sports in his works, also designing Luxembourg postage stamps for the 1952 Summer Olympics. He himself was featured on a Luxembourg postage stamp in 2016.

From 1926 to 1934 he worked as an illustrator and artistic director for two newspapers of the Ullstein-Verlag, the &quot;Berliner Illustrierte&quot; and the &quot;Grüne Post&quot;. He also founded a radio programme guide for all of Germany, called &quot;Sieben Tage&quot;.

In 1934 he moved to Mulhouse, where he died in 1936 of a heart attack. His second wife was Maria née Kasteleiner.

<text>Erich Koch (19 June 1896 – 12 November 1986) was a &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in East Prussia from 1 October 1928 until 1945. Between 1941 and 1945 he was Chief of Civil Administration (&quot;Chef der Zivilverwaltung&quot;) of Bezirk Bialystok. During this period, he was also the &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; in &quot;Reichskommissariat Ukraine&quot; from September 1941 until August 1944 and in Reichskommissariat Ostland from September 1944. After the Second World War, Koch stood trial in Poland and was convicted in 1959 of war crimes and sentenced to death. The sentence was later commuted to life in prison and Koch died of natural causes in his cell at the Barczewo prison on 12 November 1986.

==Early life and First World War ==
Koch was born in Elberfeld, today part of Wuppertal, as the son of foreman Gustav Adolf Koch (1862–1932) and his wife Henriette, née Matthes (1863–1939). In World War I he served as a soldier from 1915 to the end of the war in 1918. He later fought as a member of &quot;Freikorps Rossbach&quot; in Upper Silesia. A skilled trader, Koch joined the railway service as an aspirant for the middle level of the civil service. He was dismissed from this position in 1926 for anti-Weimar Republic activities.

==Rise in the Nazi Party==
Koch joined the NSDAP in 1922 (member #90). From 1922 he worked in various party positions in the NSDAP Gau Ruhr, including as Business Manager. During the Occupation of the Ruhr, he was a member of Albert Leo Schlageter&#x27;s group and was imprisoned several times by the French authorities. He belonged to the left wing of the party and was a supporter of the faction led by Gregor Strasser. He became a member of the National Socialist Working Association, a short-lived group of north and northwest German &quot;Gaue&quot;, organized and led by Strasser, which unsuccessfully sought to amend the Party program. It was dissolved in 1926 following the Bamberg Conference. 

On 22 March 1926, Koch became a &quot;Bezirksleiter&quot; of the NSDAP in Essen and, in October of that year, succeeded Joseph Goebbels as Business Manager of &quot;Großgau&quot; Ruhr. In 1927, he succeeded Viktor Lutze as the Deputy &quot;Gauleiter&quot; there.

==Gauleiter of East Prussia==
In October 1928 Koch became &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of the Province of East Prussia and the leader of the NSDAP faction in the provincial diet. From September 1930 he was a member of the &quot;Reichstag&quot; for East Prussia. After the &quot;Machtergreifung&quot;, Koch was appointed to the Prussian State Council in July 1933. He became &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; of East Prussia on 2 June 1933 (acting until September) replacing Wilhelm Kutscher. He thus united under his control the highest party and governmental offices in the province. In November 1938 Koch was appointed &quot;SA-Obergruppenführer&quot;.

Koch&#x27;s pre-war rule in East Prussia was characterized by efforts to collectivize the local agriculture and ruthlessness in dealing with his critics inside and outside the Party. He also had long-term plans for mass-scale industrialization of the largely agricultural province. These actions made him unpopular among the local peasants. However, through publicly funded emergency relief programs concentrating on agricultural land-improvement projects and road construction, the &quot;Erich Koch Plan&quot; for East Prussia allegedly made the province free of unemployment; on August 16, 1933, Koch reported to Hitler that unemployment had been banished entirely from East Prussia, a feat that gained admiration throughout the Reich.

Koch&#x27;s industrialization plans led him into conflict with Richard Walther Darré, who held the office of the Reich Peasant Leader (&quot;Reichsbauernführer&quot;) and Minister of Agriculture. Darré, a neopaganist rural romantic, wanted to enforce his vision of an agricultural East Prussia. When his &quot;Land&quot; representatives challenged Koch&#x27;s plans, Koch had them arrested.

==Second World War==
At the commencement of World War II on 1 September 1939, Koch was appointed Reich Defense Commissioner (&quot;Reichsverteidigungskommissar&quot;) for &quot;Wehrkreis&quot; (Military District) I, which comprised East Prussia. On 26 October 1939, after the end of the Invasion of Poland, the territory of his Gau was adjusted. Regierungsbezirk West Prussia was transferred from East Prussia to the new Reichsgau Westpreußen, later renamed  Reichsgau Danzig-West Prussia. East Prussia was compensated with Regierungsbezirk Zichenau (previously Ciechanów). These new areas lay approximately between the rivers Vistula and Narew.

In March 1940 Theodor Schieder, who was director in charge of Regional Office for Postwar History (&quot;Landesstelle fur Nachkriegsgeschichte&quot;), presented Gauleiter Erich Koch with a detailed plan regarding studies of territories annexed to East Prussia; Koch himself wanted to know political, social and ethnic conditions in those areas. Schieder in return sent two reports to Koch, including a population inventory conducted at the end of 19th century of the area in question, which was most relevant to Nazi policies of extermination and settlement, and provided basis for segregation of Jewish and &quot;Slavic&quot; spouses from ethnic Germans in the German &quot;Volksliste&quot;.

Soon after the invasion of the Soviet Union, Koch was appointed &quot;civil commissioner&quot; (&quot;Zivilkommissar&quot;) on 1 August 1941, and later as Chief of Civil Administration in Bezirk Bialystok.

In 1942 &quot;Gauleiter&quot; Erich Koch expressed thanks to Theodor Schieder for his help in Nazi operations in annexed Poland writing: &quot;As a director of &#x27;Landesstelle Ostpreußen für Nachkriegsgeschichte&#x27; you have provided material that provided significant service in our fight against Poles and continues to help us in establishing new order today in Regierungsbezirke Zichenau and Bialystok.&quot;

On 1 September 1941, Koch became &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; of Reichskommissariat Ukraine with control of the Gestapo and the uniformed police. His domain now extended from the Baltic to the Black Sea; it comprised ethnic German, Polish, Belarus and Ukrainian areas. As &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; he had full authority in his realm, which led to conflict with other elements of the Nazi bureaucracy. Alfred Rosenberg, Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories (&quot;Reichsministerium für die besetzten Ostgebiete&quot;), expressed his disapproval of Koch&#x27;s autonomous actions to Hitler in December 1941.

Koch&#x27;s first act as &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; was to close local schools, declaring that &quot;Ukraine children need no schools. What they&#x27;ll have to learn will be taught them by their German masters.&quot; His brutality is best exemplified by his remark, &quot;If I meet a Ukrainian worthy of being seated at my table, I must have him shot.&quot; Koch worked together with the General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment (&quot;Generalbevollmächtigter für den Arbeitseinsatz&quot;) Fritz Sauckel in providing the Reich with forced labor. He was also involved in the persecution of Polish and Ukrainian Jews. Due to his brutal actions, Nazi rule in Ukraine was disturbed by a growing number of partisan uprisings.

Statements about the Germans as a &quot;Herrenvolk&quot; (master race) belong to the Nazi officials of various ranks. In particular when Reichskommissar Ukraine Koch said:

On 21 September 1944, Koch succeeded Hinrich Lohse as Reichskommissar for the Ostland, overseeing the Nazi administration in the Baltic States. On October 13, 1944, Riga, the capital of the Reichskommissariat and head of the region, was re-captured by Soviet forces. Koch was appointed as head of the &quot;Volkssturm&quot; of East Prussia on 25 November 1944. As the Red Army advanced into his area during 1945, Koch initially fled Königsberg to Berlin at the end of January after condemning the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; for attempting a similar breakout from East Prussia. He then returned to the far safer town of Pillau, &quot;where he made a great show of organizing the marine evacuation using &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; radio communications, before once more getting away himself&quot; by escaping through this Baltic Sea port on 23 April 1945 on the icebreaker &quot;Ostpreußen&quot;. From Pillau through Hel Peninsula, Rügen, and Copenhagen he arrived at Flensburg, where he hid himself after unsuccessfully demanding that a U-boat take him to South America. He was captured by British forces in Hamburg in May 1949.

==Trial and imprisonment==

The Soviet Union demanded Koch&#x27;s extradition, but the British government decided to pass him on to the Communist Polish government instead. On 14 January 1950 he was handed over by the British to a prison in Warsaw, the Mokotów Prison, where he remained imprisoned for another eight years before his trial began on 19 October 1958. He faced charges of war crimes for the extermination of 400,000 Poles, but was never indicted for his crimes in Ukraine.

Found guilty of these crimes, he was sentenced to death on 9 March 1959 by the district court in Warsaw for having planned, prepared and organized the mass murder of civilians.

His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment due to ill health, although many believe he was spared because the Soviets thought he possessed information about art looted by the Nazis during the war; in particular, information about the whereabouts of the Amber Room of Tsarskoye Selo palace near Leningrad which was dismantled on Koch&#x27;s direct orders. The Soviets believed he had ordered parts of this famous room to be hidden on board the &quot;Wilhelm Gustloff&quot; cruise liner, which was torpedoed and sunk by the Soviets in the Baltic whilst evacuating German refugees from East Prussia in early 1945. Salvage attempts by both Soviet and Polish diving teams in the 1950s revealed no evidence to substantiate this theory.

Koch appeared in a television report on Königsberg&#x27;s history in 1986, interviewed by West German journalists in his Polish prison cell. He remained unrepentant to the end, arguing that he would never have surrendered the city of Königsberg as &quot;it was a matter of honour&quot;. He died shortly thereafter of natural causes in Barczewo prison (formerly Wartenburg in East Prussia) at the age of 90, as the last war criminal to serve a term in Poland. He was buried in an unmarked grave, at the local prison cemetery.

==Koch and Christianity==
Koch was one of the openly Christian Nazi Party members. In addition to his political career, Koch was also the elected praeses of the Synod of the old-Prussian Ecclesiastical Province of East Prussia. Although Koch gave preference to the &quot;Deutsche Christen&quot; Movement over traditional Protestantism, his contemporaries regarded Koch as a &quot;bona fide&quot; Christian, whose success in his church career could be attributed to his commitment to the Lutheran faith.

Koch officially resigned his church membership in 1943, but in his post-war testimony he stated: &quot;I held the view that the Nazi idea had to develop from a basic Prussian-Protestant attitude and from Luther&#x27;s unfinished Protestant Reformation.&quot; On the 450th anniversary of Luther&#x27;s birth (10 November 1933), Koch spoke on the circumstances surrounding Luther&#x27;s birthday. He implied that the &quot;Machtergreifung&quot; was an act of divine will and stated that both Luther and Hitler struggled in the name of belief.

It has been speculated that Koch&#x27;s conflicts with Rosenberg and Darré had a religious element to them.

<text>A worker bee is any female bee that lacks the reproductive capacity of the colony&#x27;s queen bee and carries out the majority of tasks needed for the functioning of the hive. While worker bees are present in all eusocial bee species, the term is rarely used (outside of scientific literature) for bees other than honey bees, particularly the European honey bee (&quot;Apis mellifera&quot;). Worker bees of this variety are responsible for approximately 80% of the world&#x27;s crop pollination services.

Worker bees are the caste of bee that perform most of the fundamental tasks of the hive, and they are by far the most numerous type of bee. They are much smaller than drones or queen bees, with bodies specialized for nectar and pollen collection. They perform different tasks around the hive progressively over their lifespans in a predictable order based on their age.

Worker bees gather pollen in the pollen baskets on their back legs and carry it back to the hive where it is used as food for the developing brood. Pollen carried on their bodies may be transferred to another flower, where a small portion can rub off on the pistil, resulting in cross pollination. Nectar is sucked up through the proboscis, mixed with enzymes in the stomach, and carried back to the hive, where it is stored in wax cells and evaporated into honey.

== Life cycle ==
Honey bee workers maintain the hive temperature in the critical brood area where new bees are hatched and raised. Workers must maintain the hive&#x27;s brood chamber within a range of . If the chamber becomes too hot, the workers collect water or diluted nectar and deposit it around the hive, then fan the air with their wings to generate cooling by evaporation. If the chamber becomes too cold, worker bees can increase the temperature of their thoracic muscles using isometric contractions, pressing their warmed muscles against caps or walls of brood cells. In the wintertime, worker bees can cluster together to generate body heat to keep the brood area warm as external temperature decreases.

The life span of a worker bee fluctuates between the summer and winter months. In the summertime, worker bees typically only live two to six weeks compared to wintertime when workers can live up to 20 weeks. The reason for this difference lies in interior physiological processes that worker bees experience, and external factors, such as bees not leaving the relative safety of the hive during the colder winter months. Worker bees are exposed to a lot more risks during the summer months when they leave the hive to forage, and therefore have a shorter relative lifespan.

Honey bees begin as an egg laid by the queen in the brood nest, located near the center of the hive. Worker eggs are laid in smaller cells compared to drone eggs, and will hatch after three days into a larva. Nurse bees feed it royal jelly for three days, followed by pollen and honey for about two more days until the cell is capped by worker bees. The larva spins itself into a cocoon and becomes an inactive pupa. During this 10-day stage, the bee begins to develop features such as eyes, wings, legs and other features that adult bees possess. After this 21 day developmental period, the adult bee will chew through its wax cap and cocoon and emerge into the hive as a fully grown bee, immediately beginning its roles in the hive.
== Progression of tasks ==
Through the lifecycle of a worker bee, she will take on many different roles within the hive, depending on how old she is and how long she has been working in the hive. The exact number of days she spends at each task depends on the requirements of the hive, however there is an estimated number of days each worker bee will spend at each task.

=== Cell cleaning (days 1–2) ===
Brood cells must be cleaned before the next use. Worker bees in the cleaning phase perform this cleaning. Cells are inspected by the queen and if unsatisfactory, they will not be used. If the cells are not clean, the worker bee must repeat the cleaning process.

=== Nurse bees (days 3–12) ===
Nurse bees feed the worker larvae worker jelly, which is secreted from glands that produce royal jelly. On days 6–12, nurse bees feed royal jelly, rich in vitamins, to the queen larva and drones. Drones receive worker jelly for 1 to 3 days until they are started on a diet of honey.

=== Queen attendants (days 7-11) ===
Queen attendants take care of the queen by feeding and grooming her. After coming into contact with the queen, the attendants spread queen mandibular pheromone (QMP) throughout the hive, which is a signal to the rest of the bees that the hive still has a viable queen.

=== Wax production (days 13–18) ===
Wax bees build cells from wax, repair old cells, and store nectar and pollen brought in by other workers. Early in the worker&#x27;s career, she exudes wax from the space between her abdominal segments. Four sets of wax glands, situated inside the last four ventral segments of the abdomen, produce wax for comb construction.

=== Guard Bee (18-21) ===
Worker Bees can be assigned guard duty at the front entrance, when their stinger is mature, to protect colony from robbing.

=== Foraging bees (days 21–42) ===
The forager and scout bees travel up to to a nectar source, pollen source, or to collect propolis or water. Worker bees journey away from the hive around 10 times each day, with each trip lasting an hour.

== Worker activities in the hive ==

=== Honey production ===
Worker bees collect nectar from flowers using their tubular mouth parts, and store it in their honey stomach. Enzymes proceed to break down the nectar into simple sugars. Back at the hive, the nectar is distributed to other worker bees who either distribute it to young bees or store it in honeycomb cells. Then, honey is produced by being further dehydrated via fanning then sealed with a wax cap, which prevents absorption of moisture from the air.

=== Drone feeding ===
Drones do not feed themselves when they are young; they are fed by workers and then when the drone bees get older they feed themselves from the honey supply.

=== Honeycomb building ===
Worker bees have eight pairs of wax glands under their abdomen from which they can create honeycomb. By chewing the wax, she mixes in her saliva, which adjusts the malleability of the wax and enables her to create each individual honeycomb cell. This process is repeated thousands of times to create comb in the hive, which will be used for honey production and brood space.

=== Pollen packing ===
Pollen brought into the hive for feeding the brood is also stored. It must be packed firmly into comb cells and mixed with a small amount of honey so that it will not spoil. Unlike honey, which does not support bacterial life, stored pollen will become rancid without proper care. It has to be kept in honey cells.

=== Propolizing ===
The walls of the hive are covered with a thin coating of propolis, a resinous substance obtained from plants. When workers add enzymes to the propolis, the combination has antibacterial and antifungal properties. Propolis is placed at the entrance of hives to aid in ventilation.

Some bees add excess mud to the mixture, making it geopropolis, such as in the bee &quot;Melipona scutellaris.&quot; Geopropolis displays antimicrobial and antiproliferative activity and has been proven to be a source of antibiofilm agents. It also presents selectivity against human cancer cell lines at low concentrations compared to normal cells.

=== Mortuary bees ===
Dead bees and failed larvae must be removed from the hive to prevent disease and allow cells to be reused. They will be carried some distance from the hive by mortuary bees.

=== Fanning bees ===
Worker bees fan the hive, cooling it with evaporated water. They direct airflow into the hive or out of the hive depending on need.

=== Water carriers ===
When the hive is in danger of overheating, these bees will obtain water, usually from within a short distance from the hive and bring it back to spread on the backs of fanning bees.

=== Guard bees ===
Guard bees will stand at the front of the hive entrance, defending it from any invaders such as wasps. The number of guards varies from season to season and from species to species. Entrance size and daily traffic also play an integral role in the number of guard bees present.
Guard bees of the species &quot;Tetragonisca angustula&quot; and &quot;Schwarziana quadripunctata&quot; are examples of eusocial bees that have been observed hovering at their nest entrances, providing more protection against intruders.

== Genetic characteristics ==
In most common bee species, worker bees are infertile due to enforced altruistic kin selection, and thus never reproduce. Workers are nevertheless considered female for anatomical and genetic reasons. Genetically, a worker bee does not differ from a queen bee and can even become a laying worker bee, but in most species will produce only male (drone) offspring. Whether a larva becomes a worker or a queen depends on the kind of food it is given after the first three days of its larval form.

== Gut bacteria ==
The workers perform different behavioral tasks in the colony that cause them to be exposed to different local environments. The worker gut microbial community composition is found to be associated with the behavioral tasks they perform, therefore also with the local environment they are exposed to and the environmental landscape is shown to affect the gut microbial community (gut microbiota composition) of honey bees.

== Stinger ==
The worker bee&#x27;s stinger is a complex organ that allows a bee to defend itself and the hive from most mammals. Bee stings against mammals and birds typically leave the stinger embedded in the victim due to the structure of flesh and the stinger&#x27;s barbs. In this case, the venom bulb stays with the stinger and continues to pump. The bee will die after losing its stinger, as the removal of the stinger and the venom bulb damages or removes other internal organs as well.

The s on the stinger will not catch on most animals besides mammals and birds, which means that such animals can be stung repeatedly by the same bee.

== Other social bees ==
There are many types of eusocial bees, including bumble bees, stingless bees, some orchid bees, and many species of sweat bees, native to all continents except for Antarctica, that have workers. Workers in these other bee lineages do not show significant morphological differences from queens, other than coloration or a smaller average body size, though they are often quite different in their behavior from queens, and may or may not lay eggs. See the respective articles for these lineages for details.

<doc id="863636" wikidata="Q5915744" url="?curid=863636" title="Housebreaking">
<text>Housebreaking (American English) or house-training (British English) is the process of training a domesticated animal that lives with its human owners in a house or other residence to excrete (urinate and defecate) outdoors, or in a designated indoor area (such as an absorbent pad or a litter box), rather than to follow its instinctive behaviour randomly inside the house. 

Around 840 million cats and dogs alone are owned as pets around the globe; and in the United States, seventy percent of households own a pet. The process requires patience and consistence from the human. Accidents are a part of the process, and if the pet&#x27;s owner reacts negatively, it could be discouraged, and the success of the training might be delayed.

== Dogs ==
The first step in housebreaking a puppy is creating a routine or schedule. Young puppies are not able to control their bladder as well as older dogs, and they should be taken out frequently. A general rule of thumb is that puppies can hold their bladder one hour for every month of age, but if you would prefer to bring them out every half hour or hour, you may be able to train very quickly. However, this is not necessary. When taking the puppy outside, its owner should take it to a designated spot every time. Using a word as they excrete, such as &quot;outside&quot;, &quot;bathroom&quot;, or &quot;potty&quot; can be used as a way to remind the puppy what to do in the future once they are trained. Rewarding the puppy after they are done excreting helps the puppy to recognize that outdoors is the proper place to urinate and defecate. It is also important to note that older animals, dogs in particular, can require just as much training and attention as puppies whenever they are introduced to a new home.

Punishing the dog for not responding well to training and making mistakes should be avoided. Punishment will make the animal anxious and confused and may cause a setback for the entire training process.

Crate training should be used when the human is not able to take the dog out within its scheduled time. The crate should be big enough for the puppy to be comfortable, but small enough for them to not want to excrete inside the crate.

One important part of housebreaking a pet, and dogs in particular, is to have preparations in place for periods of one&#x27;s absence. Many pet owners focus a lot of their energies into housebreaking their pet and then have the results of their efforts undone when they are away from their pet. If another person cares for a pet when its owner is away, and has been accustomed to a particular place in the home as its toilet, its good toilet discipline is likely to last.

== Cats ==

Housebreaking a kitten is different from housebreaking a puppy. A kitten&#x27;s toilet area would be a litter box inside the house, rather than a particular spot outside the house. A cat&#x27;s instinct is to excrete within a substrate, and then to scratch and dig to hide the excretion. Litter boxes support this natural behavior. There are several varieties of substrate for litter boxes, but according to most veterinarians, cats prefer a scent-free clumping clay substrate. Litter boxes, too, are available in different sizes and design - small, big, with walls, with a lid - and choosing a suitable one is important. Where the litter box will be located also matters: it should be in a quiet area so that the kitten would not feel agitated by the setting of its toilet area. 

To introduce the kitten to its toilet area and acquaint it with the substrate, it should be placed in the prepared litter box. The kitten should be placed in the litter box again after it has eaten, as that is when its urge to excrete is the strongest. Most kittens take to litter boxes immediately if the substrate is to their liking. However, cats have different preferences, and some cats may prefer separate litter boxes for urine and feces.

While many people train their cat to use a litter box, cats can also be housebroken like a dog. However, this process requires more careful effort, and success depends also on the age of the cat.

<doc id="863642" wikidata="Q965493" url="?curid=863642" title="Samla Mammas Manna">
<text>Samla Mammas Manna was a Swedish progressive rock band often characterized by virtuosic musicianship, circus references and silly humour, similar in many ways to the song-writing style of Frank Zappa. They were one of the founding members of the Rock in Opposition (RIO) movement in the late 1970s. In 1979 they were Fred Frith&#x27;s backing band on his solo album, &quot;Gravity&quot; (1980). Musically, they bore a resemblance to the Canterbury scene.

The original line-up was Lars Hollmer (keyboards), Hasse Bruniusson (drums), Lars Krantz (bass) and Henrik Öberg (percussion). For &quot;Måltid&quot;, jazz fusion guitarist Coste Apetrea joined the group.

They were on the fringe of the Swedish political &quot;progg&quot; movement, although their lyrics were humorous and not explicitly political. The title of the album &quot;Klossa Knapitatet&quot; is a play on the Swedish phrase &quot;krossa kapitalet&quot;, a common slogan in the 1970s that means &quot;crush the capital&quot;, and also the title of a seminal progg song by Blå Tåget, called &quot;Staten och Kapitalet (Den ena handen vet vad den andra gör)&quot;. Some more serious elements of the progg movement were not amused by this frivolous attitude.

They spent a significant part of the 70s touring in Sweden, but also in other European countries.

The band underwent line-up and name changes over the years (they released albums as Zamla Mammaz Manna and von Zamla), reinventing their sound each time. In 1999, the band reformed under their original name for a one-off release entitled &quot;Kaka&quot;. In 2002 they reunited again, this time with Japanese musician Tatsuya Yoshida on drums, for some performances and their final album &quot;Dear Mamma&quot;. The band played their first concerts in the US in August 2003, in Chicago at Schuba&#x27;s, and at the annual Progday festival in North Carolina.

In 2005 the band opened the international progressive rock festival that took place in Moscow, Russia, InProg 2005.

The musical style of Samla Mammas Manna has been described as a fusion of progressive rock and various national folk styles.
This being the result of complex rhythms using instruments not commonly used in the rock genre including the marimba, bouzouki, veena, and accordion.

Having no direct political stand, being neither &quot;a traditional Swedish folk group&quot; nor, &quot;a leftist folk-rock band&quot; as stated by Andrew Jones in his book Plunderphonics, Pataphysics &amp; Pop Mechanics: An Introduction to Musique Actuelle, they freely weaved in and out of the styles of both groups creating their own unique sound.

<text>Kucha or Kuche (also: &quot;Kuçar&quot;, &quot;Kuchar&quot;; , Кучар; , ; ) was an ancient Buddhist kingdom located on the branch of the Silk Road that ran along the northern edge of what is now the Taklamakan Desert in the Tarim Basin and south of the Muzat River.

The former area of Kucha now lies in present-day Aksu Prefecture, Xinjiang, China. Kuqa town is the county seat of Aksu Prefecture&#x27;s Kuqa County. Its population was given as 74,632 in 1990.

== Etymology ==
The history of toponyms for modern Kucha remains somewhat problematic; however, it is clear that Kucha, &quot;Kuchar&quot; (in Turkic languages) and &quot;Kuché&quot; (modern Chinese), correspond to the &quot;Kushan&quot; of Indic scripts from late antiquity.

While Chinese transcriptions of the Han or the Tang imply that &quot;Küchï&quot; was the original form of the name, &quot;Guzan&quot; or &quot;Küsan&quot; is attested in the &quot;Tibetan Annals&quot; (s.v.), dating from 687 CE. Old Uyghur and Old Mandarin transcriptions from the Mongol Empire support the forms &quot;Küsän&quot; / &quot;Güsän&quot; and &quot;Kuxian&quot; / &quot;Quxian&quot; respectively, instead of &quot;Küshän&quot; or &quot;Kushan&quot;. Another, cognate Chinese transliteration is &quot;Ku-sien&quot;.

Transcriptions of the name &quot;Kushan&quot; in Indic scripts from late antiquity include the spelling &quot;Guṣān&quot;, and are reflected in at least one Khotanese Tibetan transcription.

The forms &quot;Kūsān&quot; and &quot;Kūs&quot; are attested in Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat&#x27;s 16th-century work in Chaghatai, the &quot;Tarikh-i Rashidi&quot;. Both names, as well as &quot;Kos&quot;, &quot;Kucha&quot;, &quot;Kujar&quot; etc., were used for modern Kucha.

==History==
===Kingdom===

For a long time, Kucha was the most populous oasis in the Tarim Basin. As a Central Asian metropolis, it was part of the Silk Road economy, and was in contact with the rest of Central Asia, including Sogdia and Bactria, and thus also with the cultures of South Asia, Iran, and the coastal areas of China.

The main population of Kucha was part of the ancient population of the Tarim Basin known as the Tocharians, and Kuchans spoke an Indo-European language known as Kuchean Tocharian. The Tocharians are associated with the earlier Afanasievo culture, a population derived from the ancient North Eurasians. Chinese sources from the 2nd century BCE mentioned Wusun populations with blue eyes and red hair in the area of the Ili River to the northwest of Kucha.

Chinese official and diplomat Zhang Qian traveled the area westward to visit Central Asia, during the 2nd century BCE, stopping at Kucha. Chinese chronicles recount that Princess Xijun, a Han princess married to the king of the Wusun, had a daughter who was sent to the Han court in 64 BC, but when the daughter stopped at Kucha on the way, she decided to marry the king of Kucha instead.

According to the &quot;Book of Han&quot; (completed in 111 CE), Kucha was the largest of the &quot;Thirty-six Kingdoms of the Western Regions&quot;, with a population of 81,317, including 21,076 persons able to bear arms. The Kingdom of Kucha occupied a strategic position on the Northern Silk Road, which brought prosperity, and made Kucha a wealthy center of trade and culture.

====Han-Xiongnu contention====

During the Later Han (25–220 CE), Kucha, with the whole Tarim Basin, became a focus of rivalry between the Xiongnu to the north and the Han Chinese to the east. In 74 CE, Chinese troops started to take control of the Tarim Basin with the conquest of Turfan. In the first century CE, Kucha resisted the Chinese and allied itself with the Xiongnu and the Yuezhi against the Chinese general Ban Chao. Even the Kushan Empire of Kujula Kadphises sent an army to the Tarim Basin to support Kucha, but they retreated after minor encounters.

====Chinese conquest====

In 124, Kucha formally submitted to the Chinese court, and by 127 China had conquered the whole of the Tarim Basin. Kucha became a part of the Western protectorate of the Chinese Han dynasty, with China&#x27;s control of the Silk Road facilitating the exchange of art and the propagation of Buddhism from Central Asia. The Roman Maes Titianus visited the area in the 2nd century CE, as did numerous great Buddhist missionaries such as the Parthian An Shigao, the Yuezhis Lokaksema and Zhi Qian, or the Indian Zhú Shuòfú (). Around 150 CE, Chinese power in the western territories receded, and the Tarim Basin and its city-states regained independence.

====4th- and 5th-century Silk Road====

Kucha became very powerful and rich in the last quarter of the 4th century CE, about to take over most of the trade along the Silk Road at the expense of the Southern Silk Road, which lay along the southern edge of the Tarim Basin. According to the &quot;Jinshu&quot;, Kucha was highly fortified, had a splendid royal palace, as well as many Buddhist stupas and temples:

Culture flourished, and Indian Sanskrit scriptures were being translated by the Kuchean monk and translator Kumarajiva (344–413 CE), himself the son of a man from Kashmir and a Kuchean mother. The southern kingdoms of Shanshan and the Jushi Kingdom (now Turfan and Jiaohe) asked for Chinese assistance in countering Kucha and its neighbour Karashar. The Chinese general Lü Guang was sent with a military force by Emperor Fu Jian (357–385) of the Former Qin (351–394). Lü Guang obtained the surrender of Karashar and conquered Kucha in 383 CE. Lü Guang mentioned the powerful armour of Kucha soldiers, a type of Sasanian chainmail and lamellar armour that can also be seen in the paintings of the Kizil Caves as noted in the &quot;Biography of Chinese General Lü Guang&quot;: &quot;They were skillful with arrows and horses, and good with short and long spears. Their armour was like chain link; even if one shoots it, [the arrow] cannot go in.&quot;

Lü Guang soon retired and the empire of Fu Jian crumbled against the Eastern Jin, and he established a principality in Gansu, bringing Kumarajiva together with him.

====6th century====
 
Kucha ambassadors are known to have visited the Chinese court of Emperor Yuan of Liang in his capital Jingzhou in 516–520 CE, at or around the same time as the Hepthalite embassies there. An ambassador from Kucha is illustrated in &quot;Portraits of Periodical Offering of Liang&quot;, painted in 526–539 CE, an 11th-century Song copy of which has survived.

The Chinese pilgrim Xuanzang visited Kucha and in the 630s described Kucha at some length, and the following are excerpts from his descriptions of Kucha:

A specific style of music developed within the region and &quot;Kuchean&quot; music gained popularity as it spread along the trade lines of the Silk Road. Lively scenes of Kuchean music and dancing can be found in the Kizil Caves and are described in the writings of Xuanzang. &quot;[T]he fair ladies and benefactresses of Kizil and Kumtura in their tight-waisted bodices and voluminous skirts recall—notwithstanding the Buddhic theme—that at all the halting places along the Silk Road, in all the rich caravan towns of the Tarim, Kucha was renowned as a city of pleasures, and that as far as China men talked of its musicians, its dancing girls, and its courtesans.&quot; Kuchean music was very popular in Tang China, particularly the lute, which became known in Chinese as the pipa. For example, within the collection of the Guimet Museum, two Tang female musician figures represent the two prevailing traditions: one plays a Kuchean &quot;pipa&quot; and the other plays a Chinese &quot;jiegu&quot; (an Indian-style drum). The music of Kucha, along with other early medieval music, was transmitted from China to Japan during the same period and is preserved there, somewhat transformed, as gagaku or Japanese court music.

===7th to 13th centuries===
Following its conquest by the Tang dynasty in the early 7th century, during Emperor Taizong&#x27;s campaign against the Western Regions, the city of Kucha was regarded by Han Chinese as one of the Four Garrisons of Anxi: the &quot;Pacified West&quot;, or even its capital.

During a few decades of domination by the Tibetan Empire, in the late 7th century, Kucha was usually at least semi-independent.

In the 8th and 9th centuries, Uyghurs increasingly migrated into the area. After the destruction of the Uyghur Khaganate by Kyrgyz forces in 840, Kucha became an important center of the Uyghur kingdom of Qocho.

The extensive ruins of the ancient capital and the Subashi Temple (Chinese &quot;Qiuci&quot;), which was abandoned in the 13th century, lie north of modern Kucha.

===Modern Kucha===

Francis Younghusband, who passed through the oasis in 1887 on his journey from Beijing to India, described the district as &quot;probably&quot; having some 60,000 inhabitants. The modern Chinese town was about with a high wall, with no bastions or protection to the gateways, but a ditch about deep around it. It was filled with houses and &quot;a few bad shops&quot;. The &quot;Turk houses&quot; ran right up to the edge of the ditch and there were remains of an old city to the south-east of the Chinese one, but most of the shops and houses were outside of it. About north of the Chinese city were barracks for 500 soldiers out of a garrison he estimated to total about 1500 men, who were armed with old Enfield rifles &quot;with the Tower mark.&quot;

Kucha is now part of Kuqa, Xinjiang. It is divided into the new city, which includes the People&#x27;s Square and transportation center, and the old city, where the Friday market and vestiges of the past city wall and cemetery are located. Along with agriculture, the city also manufactures cement, carpets, and other household necessities in its local factories.

==Archaeological investigations==
There are several significant archaeological sites in the region which were investigated by the third (1905–1907, led by Albert Grünwedel) and fourth (1913–1914, led by Albert von Le Coq) German Turfan expeditions. Those in the immediate vicinity include the cave site of Achik-Ilek and Subashi.

==Kucha and Buddhism==

Kucha was an important Buddhist center from Antiquity until the late Middle Ages. Buddhism was introduced to Kucha before the end of the 1st century, however it was not until the 4th century that the kingdom became a major center of Buddhism, primarily the Sarvastivada, but eventually also Mahayana Buddhism during the Uighur period. In this respect it differed from Khotan, a Mahayana-dominated kingdom on the southern side of the desert.

According to the &quot;Book of Jin&quot;, during the third century there were nearly one thousand Buddhist stupas and temples in Kucha. At this time, Kuchanese monks began to travel to China. The fourth century saw yet further growth for Buddhism within the kingdom. The palace was said to resemble a Buddhist monastery, displaying carved stone Buddhas, and monasteries around the city were numerous.

Kucha is well known as the home of the great fifth-century translator monk Kumārajīva (344–413).

===Monks===

====Po-Yen====
A monk from the royal family known as Boyan travelled to the Chinese capital, Luoyang, from 256 to 260. He translated six Buddhist texts into Chinese in 258 at China&#x27;s famous White Horse Temple, including the &quot;Longer Sukhāvatīvyūha Sūtra&quot;, an important sutra in Pure Land Buddhism.

====Po-Śrīmitra====
Po-Śrīmitra was another Kuchean monk who traveled to China from 307 to 312 and translated three Buddhist texts.

====Po-Yen====
A second Kuchean Buddhist monk known as Po-Yen also went to Liangzhou (modern Wuwei, Gansu, China) and is said to have been well respected, although he is not known to have translated any texts.

==Tocharian languages==
The language of Kucha, as evidenced by surviving manuscripts and inscriptions, was Kuśiññe (Kushine) also known as Tocharian B or West Tocharian, an Indo-European language. Later, under the Uighur domination, the Kingdom of Kucha gradually became Turkic-speaking. &quot;Kuśiññe&quot; was completely forgotten until the early 20th century, when inscriptions and documents in two related (but mutually unintelligible) languages were discovered at various sites in the Tarim Basin. Conversely, Tocharian A, or &quot;Ārśi&quot; was native to the region of Turpan (known later as Turfan) and &quot;Agni&quot; (Qarašähär; Karashar), although the &quot;Kuśiññe&quot; language also seems to have been spoken there.

While written in a Central Asian Brahmi script used typically for Indo-Iranian languages, the Tocharian languages (as they became known by modern scholars) belong to the centum group of Indo-European languages, which are otherwise native to Southern and Western Europe. The precise dating of known Tocharian texts is contested, but they were written around the 6th to 8th centuries CE (although Tocharian speakers must have arrived in the region much earlier). Both languages became extinct before circa 1000 CE. Scholars are still trying to piece together a fuller picture of these languages, their origins, history and connections, etc.

==Neighbors==
The kingdom bordered Aksu and Kashgar to the west and Karasahr and Turpan to the east. Across the Taklamakan Desert to the south was Khotan.

==Kucha and the Kizil Caves==

The Kizil Caves lie about northwest of Kucha and were included within the rich fourth-century kingdom of Kucha. The caves claim origins from the royal family of ancient Kucha, specifically a local legend involving Princess Zaoerhan, the daughter of the King of Kucha. While out hunting, the princess met and fell in love with a local mason. When the mason approached the king to ask for permission to marry the princess, the king was appalled and vehemently against the union. He told the young man he would not grant permission unless the mason carved 1000 caves into the local hills. Determined, the mason went to the hills and began carving in order to prove himself to the king. After three years and carving 999 caves, he died from the exhaustion of the work. The distraught princess found his body, and grieved herself to death, and now, her tears are said to be current waterfalls that cascade down some of the cave&#x27;s rock faces.

== Coinage ==

From around the third or fourth century Kucha began the manufacture of Wu Zhu (五銖) cash coins inspired by the diminutive and devalued Wu Zhu&#x27;s of the post-Han dynasty era in Chinese history. It is very likely that the cash coins produced in Kucha predate the Kaiyuan Tongbao (開元通寳) and that the native production of coins stopped sometime after the year 621 when the Wu Zhu cash coins were discontinued in China proper. The coinage of Kucha includes the &quot;Han Qiu bilingual Wu Zhu coin&quot; (漢龜二體五銖錢, &quot;hàn qiū èr tǐ wǔ zhū qián&quot;) which has a yet undeciphered text belonging to a language spoken in Kucha.

<doc id="863650" wikidata="Q4357322" url="?curid=863650" title="List of Olympic medalists in art competitions">
<text>There were 146 medalists in the art competitions that were part of the Olympic Games from 1912 until 1948. These art competitions were considered an integral part of the movement by International Olympic Committee (IOC) founder Pierre de Coubertin and necessary to recapture the complete essence of the Ancient Olympic Games. Their absence before the 1912 Summer Olympics, according to journalism professor Richard Stanton, stems from Coubertin &quot;not wanting to fragment the focus of his new and fragile movement&quot;. Art competitions were originally planned for inclusion in the 1908 Summer Olympics but were delayed after that edition&#x27;s change in venue from Rome to London following the 1906 eruption of Mount Vesuvius. By the 1924 Summer Olympics they had grown to be considered internationally relevant and potentially &quot;a milestone in advancing public awareness of art as a whole&quot;.

During their first three appearances, the art competitions were grouped into five broad categories: architecture, literature, music, painting, and sculpture. The Dutch Organizing Committee for the 1928 Summer Olympics split these into subcategories in the hopes of increasing participation. Although it was a successful strategy, the 1932 Summer Olympics eliminated several of these subcategories, which led to fewer entries in the broader categories. For the 1936 Summer Olympics, the German government proposed the addition of a film contest to the program, which was rejected.

Following a final appearance at the 1948 Summer Olympics, art competitions were removed from the Olympic program. Planners of the 1952 Summer Olympics opposed their inclusion on logistical grounds, claiming that the lack of an international association for the event meant that the entire onus of facilitation was placed on the local organizing committee. Concerns were also raised about the professionalism of the event, since only amateurs were allowed to participate in the sporting tournaments, and the growing commercialization of the competitions, as artists had been permitted to sell their submissions during the course of the Games since 1928. In 1952 an art festival and exhibition was held concurrent with the Games, a tradition that has been maintained in all subsequent Summer Olympics.

In 1952, art competition medals were removed from the official national medal counts. The IOC does not track medalists in Olympic art competitions in its database and thus the prize winners are only officially recorded in the original Olympic reports. Judges were not required to distribute first, second, and third place awards for every category, and thus certain events lack medalists in these placements. Since participants were allowed multiple submissions, it was also possible for artists to win more than one in a single event, as Alex Diggelmann of Switzerland did in the graphic arts category of the 1948 edition. Diggelmann is tied with Denmark&#x27;s Josef Petersen, who won second prize three times in literature, for the number of medals captured in the art competitions. Luxembourg&#x27;s Jean Jacoby is the only individual to win two gold medals, doing so in painting in 1924 and 1928. Of the 146 medalists, 11 were women and only Finnish author Aale Tynni was awarded gold. Germany was the most successful nation, with eight gold, seven silver, and nine bronze medals, although one was won by Coubertin himself, a Frenchman. He submitted his poem &quot;Ode to Sport&quot; under the pseudonyms Georges Hohrod and Martin Eschbach, as if it were a joint-entry, and won first prize in the 1912 literature category. The original report credits this medal to Germany. Two individuals, Walter W. Winans and Alfréd Hajós, won medals in both athletic and art competitions.

<doc id="863651" wikidata="Q39387" url="?curid=863651" title="Newton Cannon">
<text>Newton Cannon (May 22, 1781 – September 16, 1841) was an American politician who served as the eighth Governor of Tennessee from 1835 to 1839. He also served several terms in the United States House of Representatives, from 1814 to 1817, and from 1819 to 1823. Cannon was a long-time foe of Andrew Jackson, and spent much of his political career opposing Jacksonite policies. Cannon was succeeded as Governor of Tennessee by James K. Polk in 1839, who later became President of the United States.

==Early life==
Born in Guilford County, North Carolina, Cannon was the son of Minos Cannon, who served as a soldier in the Continental Army. The family moved to the area that later became Williamson County, Tennessee, around 1790.

Cannon received a common school education and tried several occupations as a young man, working as a saddler, merchant and surveyor, and undertaking the study of law, before eventually becoming a planter in Williamson County. He owned slaves.

==Career==
Cannon entered political office in 1811, representing Williamson, Rutherford, Maury, Bedford, Lincoln, and Giles counties in the state senate in the 9th Tennessee General Assembly (1811–1812). He served in the Creek War of 1813 as a colonel in the Tennessee Mounted Rifles.

In 1813, he was a candidate for United States House of Representatives, losing the election to Felix Grundy. He won election to the seat as a Democratic- Republican the following year, however, in a special election held after Grundy resigned. Cannon was later reelected to a full term in the House, serving from September 16, 1814, to March 3, 1817. In 1819, he accepted an assignment from President James Monroe to negotiate a treaty with the Chickasaw. He was again elected to the U.S. House for the 16th Congress and won re-election to the 17th Congress, serving from March 4, 1819, to March 3, 1823.

===Governorship===
Cannon first sought the Tennessee governorship in 1827 in a field that initially included Sam Houston, former governor Willie Blount, Felix Grundy, and aging frontiersman John Rhea. Cannon lost the election to Houston by a vote of 44,426 to 33,410. He subsequently returned to the General Assembly as a state senator, representing Rutherford and Williamson counties in the 18th General Assembly (1829–1830), and aligned himself with Andrew Erwin, John Williams and Davy Crockett, to oppose the policies of Jackson and his allies. He was elected as a delegate to the Tennessee Constitutional Convention of 1834, at which he served as chairman of the Committee of the Whole.

Cannon again ran for governor in 1835, defeating incumbent William Carroll by a vote of 41,970 to 31,205. Carroll had been a popular governor, but he was seeking a fourth consecutive two-year term in spite of a provision of the state constitution that limited a governor to three terms. Carroll maintained that the gubernatorial term limit in the state&#x27;s original constitution no longer applied because it was replaced by a new constitution in 1834. Cannon, however, argued that the 1834 constitution was a revision rather than a replacement for the original constitution. Cannon&#x27;s view apparently prevailed with the voters. Cannon&#x27;s election was also aided by division among Tennessee Democrat-Republicans over the U.S. Presidential candidacy of Tennessean Hugh Lawson White in opposition to the national party&#x27;s choice of Martin Van Buren.

Cannon was the first member of the Whig Party to be elected governor of Tennessee. He became the first governor to benefit from increased powers given to the office by the state constitution of 1834. As governor, in 1836 he convened the first special session of the legislature in state history.

Cannon was re-elected to a second term as governor in 1837, defeating General Robert Armstrong. In his second term as governor, both houses of the General Assembly were controlled by Whigs, and the legislature approved proposals to create a new state bank and to expand state support for internal improvements such as roads, railroads, and canals. An advocate for public education, Cannon designated some revenues from the state bank to pay for schools. Cannon was publicly criticized for his implementation of the new laws, especially in East Tennessee, where voters grew impatient over his lack of support for the Hiwassee Railroad.

In 1839, state Democrats, determined to defeat Cannon, convinced rising politician and Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives James K. Polk to run against him. The two candidates toured the state together to give a series of public debates, the first of which took place at Murfreesboro on April 11, 1839. Cannon typically delivered slower, more methodical arguments, and was outshone in the debates by the quicker and wittier Polk. In the election, Polk narrowly defeated Cannon by a vote of 54,680 to 52,114.

Cannon wanted to run against Polk in 1841, but Whig leaders instead nominated James C. Jones, thinking that Cannon would not be able to defeat Polk.

Cannon died in Nashville at the age of sixty, just two years after his last candidacy for governor. He is interred in a cemetery on the grounds of his estate in Williamson County near Allisona.

===Opposition to Andrew Jackson===
Throughout his political career, Newton Cannon was known for his personal and political antagonism toward Andrew Jackson, whose policies he consistently opposed. Three different supposed interactions between the two men all have been suggested as explanations for the origin of Cannon&#x27;s antipathy to Jackson. The earliest of these interactions involved a horse track known as Clover Bottom that Jackson owned together with a pair of brothers, William and Patten Anderson. Cannon is purported to have lost substantial amounts of money and other possessions from gambling at Clover Bottom, and is said to have blamed Jackson and the Andersons for his losses, suspecting them of fixing races. The second encounter occurred in 1812 when Cannon served on a jury in a trial of Jonathan Magness who, with his two sons David and Perry Green, had been accused of murder in the death of Patten Anderson. After the jury returned a verdict of not guilty, Jackson is said to have shaken his fist at Cannon, saying &quot;I&#x27;ll mark you, young man.&quot; Perhaps the most compelling explanation is Cannon&#x27;s disapproval of Jackson&#x27;s military leadership when he served as a detachment leader under Jackson&#x27;s command during the Creek War. Cannon is said to have believed that Jackson had deliberately exposed Cannon and his men to unnecessary dangers.

==Family life and legacy==
Cannon was married twice. In 1813, he married Leah Pryor Perkins. She died in 1816. In 1818, he married Rachel Starnes Willborn. He was the father of ten children. A daughter, Rachel Adeline Cannon Maney, was for many years an owner of the Oaklands estate in Murfreesboro. The Civil War journals of a grandson, also named Newton Cannon, were published in 1963 as &quot;The Reminiscences of Newton Cannon: First Sergeant, 11th Tennessee Cavalry, C.S.A.&quot;

Cannon County, Tennessee, which was established during Cannon&#x27;s governorship, is named in his honor.

<text>USS &quot;Dennis&quot; (DE-405) was a in the service with the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. She was scrapped in 1973.

==History==
&quot;Dennis&quot; was named after Radioman Third Class Otis Lee Dennis was born in Scottsville, Allen County, Kentucky on 25 March 1913. He was killed in action 1 February 1942 with Carleton Thayer Fogg (namesake of ) when their Douglas SBD Dauntless was lost during an attack launched by on Roi-Namur, Kwajalein. It was one of the first offensive operations following Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Dennis&quot; was launched on 4 December 1943 by Brown Shipbuilding, in Houston, Texas; sponsored by Mrs. J. L. Dennis, mother of the late Radioman Third Class Dennis; and commissioned on 20 March 1944.

&quot;Dennis&quot; differed from most ships in her class in that she had a quadruple mount and a twin mount of Bofors guns instead of two twin mounts. This represented a 50% increase in medium anti-aircraft guns.

===Pacific War===
&quot;Dennis&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 19 June 1944 to escort a convoy to Eniwetok and Kwajalein. She returned to Eniwetok on 29 July screening the light carrier . Joining the 5th Fleet, she escorted Carrier Division 22 to Manus for exercises, then sortied with Task Force 77 on 10 September to supply air support for the landings on Morotai Island from 15 to 27 September.

From 12 October, &quot;Dennis&quot; screened the escort carriers supplying the air cover for the invasion of Leyte. On 25 October, she joined her carriers in making history as they fought a gallant action with the Japanese counter-attacking force in the Battle off Samar phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. &quot;Dennis&quot; was positioned alone as the final destroyer escort between the screen of destroyers and destroyers escorts and the escort carriers being shielded. &quot;Dennis&quot; was credited with torpedoing and sinking a Japanese heavy cruiser in that action. &quot;Dennis&quot; rescued 434 survivors from the escort carrier , which had been sunk by a &quot;kamikaze&quot;. For this action, she shared in the Presidential Unit Citation awarded to TU 77.4.3, &quot;Taffy 3&quot;. Arriving at Kossol Roads, Palaus on 28 October, she sailed three days later for the west coast, arriving at San Francisco, California on 26 November for an overhaul.

Returning to the forward area &quot;Dennis&quot; departed Guam on 16 February 1945 for the invasion of Iwo Jima, patrolling off the island until 8 March, when she sailed to escort a convoy to Ulithi. On 21 March, she proceeded to join a carrier group launching air strikes in preparation for the invasion of Okinawa. She remained with the carriers as they gave close support to the invasion forces ashore. On 4 May, she rescued 88 of the crew of the escort carrier , a &quot;kamikaze&quot; victim. She served on radar picket duty at Ulithi from 9 May-3 June, then returned to Okinawa to join the Third Fleet for strikes against the Japanese mainland until 26 June.

From 30 June 1945 until the end of the war, &quot;Dennis&quot; escorted convoys among Ulithi, Okinawa, the Philippines, and New Guinea. After the war, she escorted landing craft to Okinawa, then departed Leyte Gulf on 14 October for the west coast, arriving at San Diego, California on 6 November. She was placed out of commission in reserve there on 31 May 1946.

==Honors==
In addition to her Presidential Unit Citation, &quot;Dennis&quot; received four battle stars for World War II service.

<text>West Hartford is an unincorporated community village in the town of Hartford, Windsor County, Vermont, United States. It is one of Hartford&#x27;s five villages, situated on the White River and crossed by the Appalachian Trail.

West Hartford no longer has a post office, but still has a local library, and a town park. The White River, is a nearby fishing site. The village&#x27;s center is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the West Hartford Village Historic District.

==Geography==
West Hartford is located in far northern Hartford, seven river miles up the White River from its mouth at the Connecticut River. Its center is at geographical coordinates 43° 42′ 44&quot; North, 72° 25′ 7&quot; West (43.71212, -72.418541). The White River runs through the Village and along Clifford Park.

==History==
The village of West Hartford was settled during the late 18th century, primarily organized around mills and outlying agricultural areas. The oldest surviving house in the village was built in 1795 by Francis and Abigail (Hazen) Savage. Abigail was the granddaughter of the area&#x27;s first colonial landowner. A turnpike, now Vermont Route 14, was built along the river in 1800. The focal center of the village was established at Harper Savage Lane by construction of its first bridge to span the White River in 1820, and then by the construction of a railroad station nearby. By 1830, the village had a church and post office, and the village continued to thrive during the 19th century, mainly due to its proximity to White River Junction, an important railroad hub in the region. Much of the village was destroyed by a major flood in 1867. This natural disaster destroyed much of the local industry, with the exception of retail which continued, driven by the presence of the railroad.

In the spring of 1927, the Vermont rivers flooded, taking out several bridges including the West Hartford Bridge, then a covered bridge. Shortly after the flood, the bridges were all replaced with simple contemporary bridges that were tall, green, and steel trussed. In 2006, the West Hartford Bridge was replaced with a new single-span bridge named Veterans Bridge. The old bridge had a pool off of the downstream side where locals would jump off the bridge into the water. The new bridge is in a location where it is dangerous to jump because the deep pool is no longer accessible, although teens, children, and adults still jump off the bridge. At the foot of the new bridge, there is a small area in remembrance of Hartford Veterans.

Clifford Park is a town maintained park that includes nature trails, a softball field, horseshoe pits, and a picnic area on the river. Every summer, it is turned into a major landing area for the hot air balloons that have taken off at the Quechee Balloon Festival, and every Halloween it is the Haunted Area for local youths sponsored by the Hartford Parks and Recreation Department. The park is named Clifford, after the former owner of the land that now holds the park, and the land that is the Westfield Drive community.

On August 28, 2011, West Hartford was hit by Tropical Storm Irene. Several houses, the country store, the library, and the post office were affected. The post office was torn down, the store repaired, and the library has been rebuilt.

The bridge and road also suffered damage from this event. The bridge was out of commission for several weeks, forcing people to find alternative routes to get to work and into more populated areas. As for the road, Route 14, it was usable to a certain point. It was repaired slowly and in the village itself there were several large holes where the river gouged away the pavement, dirt, and gravel. In August 29, residents and volunteers were using their tractors and snowplows to clear Route 14 of mud and debris. The town&#x27;s church was used as a place for gathering donated items and food to be collected for the victims of Storm Irene.

The storm left Clifford Park significantly damaged. It accumulated at least a foot of mud, and the playground, basketball half-court, tennis courts, and baseball field all had to be reconstructed. There are picnic tables underneath a shade structure, and benches stand here and there around the perimeter of the field, and the gravel parking lot is now outlined by a wooden fence.

Debris has been cleared and restoration is complete, but evidence of the storm&#x27;s destruction can still be observed. Houses, roads, and riverbanks still bear the mark of Irene in erosion and weathering.

==Schools==
West Hartford elementary students attend Ottauquechee School in Quechee, VT (K-5) and attend middle and high school at Hartford Memorial Middle School (6-8) and Hartford High School (9-12). Large private schools in the area include: the Upper Valley Waldorf School in Quechee (K-8), Mid Vermont Christian School in Quechee (K-6) and the Middle School (7-8) and High School (9-12).

<text>Moody&#x27;s Corporation is an American business and financial services company. It is the holding company for Moody&#x27;s Ratings (previously known as Moody&#x27;s Investors Service), an American credit rating agency, and Moody&#x27;s (previously known as Moody&#x27;s Analytics), an American provider of financial analysis software and services.

Moody&#x27;s was founded by John Moody in 1909 to produce manuals of statistics related to stocks and bonds and bond ratings. Moody&#x27;s was acquired by Dun &amp; Bradstreet in 1962. In 2000, Dun &amp; Bradstreet spun off Moody&#x27;s Corporation as a separate company that was listed on the NYSE under MCO. In 2007, Moody&#x27;s Corporation was split into two operating divisions, Moody&#x27;s Investors Service, the rating agency, and Moody&#x27;s Analytics, with all of its other products. It was included in the Fortune 500 list for the first time in 2021.

==History of Moody&#x27;s==

Moody&#x27;s Corporation traces its history back to two publishing companies established by John Moody, the inventor of modern bond credit ratings. It was first published in 1900 by John Moody, nine years before he founded Moody&#x27;s Corporation. Initially called &quot;Moody&#x27;s Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities&quot;, it was later superseded by &quot;Moody&#x27;s Manual of Railroads and Corporation Securities&quot;, then by &quot;Moody&#x27;s Analyses of Investments&quot;. 

In 1900, Moody published his first market assessment, called &quot;Moody&#x27;s Manual of Industrial and Miscellaneous Securities&quot;, and established John Moody &amp; Company. The publication provided detailed statistics relating to stocks and bonds of financial institutions, government agencies, manufacturing, mining, utilities, and food companies. It experienced early success, selling out its first print run in its first two months.

By 1903, &quot;Moody&#x27;s Manual&quot; was a nationally recognized publication. The 1907 financial crisis fueled several changes in the markets, including the creation of the Federal Reserve System. Meanwhile, Moody was forced to sell his business, due to a shortage of capital. Moody returned in 1909 with a new publication focused solely on railroad bonds, &quot;Analysis of Railroad Investments&quot;, and a new company, Moody&#x27;s Analyses Publishing Company.

In 1962, Moody&#x27;s Investors Service was bought by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, a firm engaged in the related field of credit reporting, although they continued to operate largely as independent companies. By the late 1990s, Moody&#x27;s superior performance compared to its parent company brought investor pressure to separate the businesses. In 1998, Dun &amp; Bradstreet sold the Moody&#x27;s publishing business to Financial Communications (later renamed Mergent). In December 1999, Dun &amp; Bradstreet announced it would spin off Moody&#x27;s Investors Service into a separate publicly traded company. The spin-off was completed on September 30, 2000.

In December 2022, the company was added to the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index.

==Moody&#x27;s Ratings==

Moody&#x27;s Ratings, previously known as Moody&#x27;s Investors Service, is the bond credit rating business of Moody&#x27;s Corporation, representing the company&#x27;s traditional line of business and its historical name. Moody&#x27;s Ratings rates debt securities in several market segments related to public and commercial securities in the bond market. These include government, municipal and corporate bonds; managed investments such as money market funds, fixed-income funds and hedge funds; financial institutions including banks and non-bank finance companies; and asset classes in structured finance.

Moody&#x27;s Ratings closest competitors are Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s (S&amp;P) and Fitch Group. Together, they are sometimes referred to as the Big Three credit rating agencies. Moody&#x27;s Ratings and its close competitors play a key role in global capital markets as a supplementary credit analysis provider for banks and other financial institutions in assessing the credit risk of particular securities.

According to Moody&#x27;s, the purpose of its ratings is to &quot;provide investors with a simple system of gradation by which future relative creditworthiness of securities may be gauged&quot;. To each of its ratings from Aaa through Caa, Moody&#x27;s appends numerical modifiers 1, 2 and 3; the lower the number, the higher-end the rating. Aaa, Ca and C are not modified this way.

==Moody&#x27;s==
Moody&#x27;s, previously known as Moody&#x27;s Analytics, is a subsidiary of Moody&#x27;s Corporation established in 2007 to focus on non-rating activities. It performs economic research related to credit analysis, performance management, financial modeling, structured analysis and financial risk management. Moody&#x27;s also offers software and consulting services, including proprietary economic models and software tools, as well as professional training for the financial services sector, particularly risk management accreditation.

Moody&#x27;s Analytics started in 1995 as a business unit providing quantitative analysis services, including credit risk assessment software and services, called Moody&#x27;s Risk Management Service (MRMS), and grew through partnerships and acquisitions in the late 1990s and 2000s, expanding its client base and capabilities. Acquisitions included KMV, Economy.com, Wall Street Analytics, Fermat International, Enb Consulting Ltd., The Institute of Risk Standards and Qualifications (iRSQ), CSI Global Education Inc., and Bureau van Dijk.

==The Moody&#x27;s Foundation==
In 2002, Moody&#x27;s Corporation created a corporate philanthropy program, The Moody&#x27;s Foundation, focused on educational initiatives in mathematics, economics and finance. The organization offers grants to 501(c)(3) non-profits and equivalent international organizations, accredited schools and some governmental organizations.

Since 2006, its main program is the annual Moody&#x27;s Mega Math Challenge (M3 Challenge), a student academic challenge co-sponsored with the Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics (SIAM), in which several hundred teams of high school students use quantitative analysis and modeling to solve problems related to real-life financial topics such as Social Security and the Economic Stimulus Act of 2008. Since 2010.

==Moody&#x27;s Research Labs==

Moody&#x27;s Research Labs, Inc. was a business incubator focused on research and development specializing in financial risk modeling and analysis, focused on developing such products for use by other divisions of Moody&#x27;s Corporation. Its president was Roger Stein. In March 2011 Moody&#x27;s Analytics announced the release of a software program developed by Moody&#x27;s Research Labs, the Mortgage Portfolio Analyzer, to assist portfolio managers in managing credit risk.
Moody&#x27;s Research Labs was dissolved in February 2012.

==Lawsuit settlements==
October 2011: Moody’s reached a settlement resolving claims by the state of Connecticut that the credit rating company unfairly gave lower ratings to public bonds.

July 2012: Moody’s said it reached a settlement with stockholders in lawsuits filed over structured finance ratings.

April 2013: Moody&#x27;s reached a settlement avoiding what would have been their first jury trial over crisis-era ratings. The fourteen plaintiffs were led by Abu Dhabi Commercial Bank and King County, Washington. They filed lawsuits in 2008 and 2009 that Moody&#x27;s misled them by allegedly inflating ratings on two so-called structured investment vehicles they purchased.

January 2017: Moody&#x27;s Corporation, Moody&#x27;s Analytics, and Moody&#x27;s Investors Service reached an $863 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice and the attorneys general of 21 states and the District of Columbia &quot;Arising From Conduct in the Lead up to the Financial Crisis.&quot; &quot;The settlement resolves allegations arising from Moody’s role in providing credit ratings for Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) and Collateralized Debt Obligations (CDO), contributing to the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.&quot; Then California Attorney General Kamala Harris and then Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley were among the 21 state signatories.

March 2021: Moody&#x27;s reached a settlement with the European Union regarding conflicts of interest. Moody&#x27;s was fined €3.7 million ($4.35 million).

==Acquisitions==
In 2019, Moody&#x27;s Corporation purchased the majority share in the California-based climate risk data firm, Four Twenty Seven (427), that &quot;measures the physical risks&quot; of &quot;climate change&quot;. This acquisition is the &quot;latest indication that global warming can threaten the creditworthiness of governments and companies&quot; globally, according to a July 25, 2019 article in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In 2021, Moody&#x27;s acquired Risk Management Solutions (RMS) from Daily Mail and General Trust for $2 billion. RMS generates risk models for the insurance and reinsurance industries.

<text>Global Engine Alliance LLC, began as a joint venture of Chrysler, Mitsubishi Motors, and Hyundai Motor Company for developing a line of shared engines.

In September 2009, Chrysler purchased Mitsubishi and Hyundai&#x27;s shares, after 5 years of allied research and development, making its Dundee, Michigan plant a wholly owned subsidiary of what was then Chrysler Group LLC.

==Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance ==
Global Engine Manufacturing Alliance, LLC (GEMA) was the manufacturing arm of the Global Engine Alliance and consisted of five factories worldwide. Production began in 2005, with an annual capacity of approximately two million engines; each plant was capable of producing 420,000. Twenty different automobile models from the three companies were to use the engines. Chrysler had expected to use GEMA engines in ten models and projects, and buy up to 840,000 GEMA engines annually.

The Dundee plants were purchased by Chrysler in December, 2012, and renamed the &quot;Chrysler Dundee Engine Plant(s)&quot;. After Chrysler&#x27;s assimilation into FCA, the plant simply became known as the Dundee Engine Plant.

==Design==
Hyundai was initially responsible for leading the design of the base engine, while the Chrysler Group and Mitsubishi were involved in making other important engineering contributions pertaining to the design. The design features Siamese bores, an aluminium block with cast-iron cylinder liners, and an aluminium head. Different cylinder liners could be fitted to increase or decrease displacement depending on manufacturers needs. Each manufacturer configured their variants of the initial design differently based on their engineering needs and standards, so consumers may experience very different power, fuel efficiency, and &quot;feel&quot; from each manufacturer.

<doc id="863665" wikidata="Q2838056" url="?curid=863665" title="Public Service Alliance of Canada">
<text>The Public Service Alliance of Canada (PSAC; , AFPC) is one of Canada&#x27;s largest national labour unions. It is the largest union in the Canadian federal public sector. PSAC members work in every province and territory, and also work abroad in embassies and consulates.

Many of PSAC&#x27;s some 200,000 members work for the federal public service, crown corporations, or agencies as immigration officers, fisheries officers, food inspectors, customs officers, national defence civilian employees, and the like. However, an increasing number of PSAC members work in non-federal sectors: in women&#x27;s shelters, universities, security agencies and casinos. In Northern Canada, PSAC represents most unionized workers employed in the Yukon, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories.

PSAC is headquartered in Ottawa with 23 regional offices across Canada. PSAC&#x27;s Ottawa headquarters building, designed in 1968 by Paul Schoeler, is a notable example of modernist architecture in Ottawa.

==History==

PSAC was formed when the Civil Service Association of Canada, led by Calbert Best, and Civil Service Federation of Canada, led by Claude Edwards, agreed to merge. 

=== Bargaining ===

PSAC signed its first collective agreements with Treasury Board in 1968.

=== Strikes ===

PSAC&#x27;s first strike came in November 1971 against Defence Construction Ltd. In 1980, the PSAC&#x27;s large CR bargaining unit, made up largely of women clerical workers, went out. PSAC&#x27;s 1991 general strike brought job security improvements. They held another strike in 2023.

=== Women in the union ===

Most founding convention delegates were men. In 1967, PSAC began organizing secretaries, stenographers and typists.

=== Equality rights ===

From 1981 onward, PSAC&#x27;s Equal Opportunities Committee included all equity-seeking groups. In 1988, PSAC adopted a comprehensive human rights policy. Action committees for members with disabilities and racially visible members started in 1990. By 1999, the union started holding conferences for racially visible members, Aboriginal Peoples and workers with disabilities. In 2004, the first network of Aboriginal, Inuit and Metis members was formed to advance their rights within and beyond the union.

== Executive ==

The National President, the National Executive Vice-President and the seven Regional Executive Vice-Presidents (REVPs) form the Alliance Executive Committee (AEC). The AEC is responsible for the day-to-day decisions of the union with respect to finances, overseeing campaigns, mobilizing the membership, advocating on behalf of the membership and advancing the union and its members&#x27; rights in the workplace. The AEC meets monthly and as needed.

The current REVPs are:

* Chris Di Liberatore, Regional Executive Vice-President, Atlantic
* Yvon Barrière, Regional Executive Vice-President, Québec
* Ruth Lau-MacDonald, Regional Executive Vice-President, National Capital Region
* Craig Reynolds, Regional Executive Vice-President, Ontario

<text>In physics, backscatter (or backscattering) is the reflection of waves, particles, or signals back to the direction from which they came. It is usually a diffuse reflection due to scattering, as opposed to specular reflection as from a mirror, although specular backscattering can occur at normal incidence with a surface. Backscattering has important applications in astronomy, photography, and medical ultrasonography. The opposite effect is forward scatter, e.g. when a translucent material like a cloud diffuses sunlight, giving soft light.

== Backscatter of waves in physical space ==
Backscattering can occur in quite different physical situations, where the incoming waves or particles are deflected from their original direction by different mechanisms:
*Diffuse reflection from large particles and Mie scattering, causing alpenglow and gegenschein, and showing up in weather radar;
*Inelastic collisions between electromagnetic waves and the transmitting medium (Brillouin scattering and Raman scattering), important in fiber optics, see below;
*Elastic collisions between accelerated ions and a sample (Rutherford backscattering)
*Bragg diffraction from crystals, used in inelastic scattering experiments (neutron backscattering, X-ray backscattering spectroscopy);
*Compton scattering, used in Backscatter X-ray imaging.
* &quot;Stimulated backscatter&quot;, observed in non-linear optics, and described by a class of solutions to the three-wave equation.

Sometimes, the scattering is more or less isotropic, i.e. the incoming particles are scattered randomly in various directions, with no particular preference for backward scattering. In these cases, the term &quot;backscattering&quot; just designates the detector location chosen for some practical reasons:
*in X-ray imaging, backscattering means just the opposite of transmission imaging;
*in inelastic neutron or X-ray spectroscopy, backscattering geometry is chosen because it optimizes the energy resolution;
*in astronomy, backscattered light is that which is reflected with a phase angle of less than 90°.

In other cases, the scattering intensity is enhanced in backward direction. This can have different reasons:
*In alpenglow, red light prevails because the blue part of the spectrum is depleted by Rayleigh scattering.
*In gegenschein, constructive interference might play a role.
*Coherent backscattering is observed in random media; for visible light most typically in suspensions like milk. Due to weak localization, enhanced multiple scattering is observed in back direction.
** The Back Scattering Alignment (BSA) coordinate system is often used in radar applications
** The Forward Scattering Alignment (FSA) coordinate system is primarily used in optical applications

Backscattering properties of a target are wavelength dependent and can also be polarization dependent. Sensor systems using multiple wavelengths or polarizations can thus be used to infer additional information about target properties.

=== Radar, especially weather radar ===
Backscattering is the principle behind radar systems. In weather radar, backscattering is proportional to the 6th power of the diameter of the target multiplied by its inherent reflective properties, provided the wavelength is larger than the particle diameter (Rayleigh scattering). Water is almost 4 times more reflective than ice but droplets are much smaller than snow flakes or hail stones. So the backscattering is dependent on a mix of these two factors. The strongest backscatter comes from hail and large graupel (solid ice) due to their sizes, but non-Rayleigh (Mie scattering) effects can confuse interpretation. Another strong return is from melting snow or wet sleet, as they combine size and water reflectivity. They often show up as much higher rates of precipitation than actually occurring in what is called a &quot;brightband.&quot; Rain is a moderate backscatter, being stronger with large drops (such as from a thunderstorm) and much weaker with small droplets (such as mist or drizzle). Snow has rather weak backscatter. Dual polarization weather radars measure backscatter at horizontal and vertical polarizations to infer shape information from the ratio of the vertical and horizontal signals.

== In waveguides ==
The backscattering method is also employed in fiber optics applications to detect optical faults. Light propagating through a fiber-optic cable gradually attenuates due to Rayleigh scattering. Faults are thus detected by monitoring the variation of part of the Rayleigh backscattered light. Since the backscattered light attenuates exponentially as it travels along the optical fiber cable, the attenuation characteristic is represented in a logarithmic scale graph. If the slope of the graph is steep, then power loss is high. If the slope is gentle, then optical fiber has a satisfactory loss characteristic.

The loss measurement by the backscattering method allows measurement of a fiber-optic cable at one end without cutting the optical fiber hence it can be conveniently used for the construction and maintenance of optical fibers.

== In photography ==
 
The term backscatter in photography refers to light from a flash,or strobe or video lights reflecting back from particles in the lens&#x27;s field of view causing specks of light to appear in the photo. This gives rise to what are sometimes referred to as &quot;orb artifacts&quot;. Photographic backscatter can result from snowflakes, rain or mist, or airborne dust. Due to the size limitations of the modern compact and ultra-compact cameras, especially digital cameras, the distance between the lens and the built-in flash has decreased, thereby decreasing the angle of light reflection to the lens and increasing the likelihood of light reflection off normally sub-visible particles. Hence, the orb artifact is commonplace with small digital or film camera photographs.

<text>The Tsar Cannon (, &quot;Tsar&#x27;-pushka&quot;) is a large early modern period artillery piece (known as a &quot;bombarda&quot; in Russian) on display on the grounds of the Moscow Kremlin. It is a monument of Russian artillery casting art, cast in bronze in 1586 in Moscow, by the Russian master bronze caster Andrey Chokhov. Mostly of symbolic impact, it was never used in a war. However, the cannon bears traces of at least one firing. Per the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; it is the largest bombard by caliber in the world, and it is a major tourist attraction in the ensemble of the Moscow Kremlin.

==Description==
The Tsar Cannon is located just past the Kremlin Armory, facing towards the Kremlin Senate. The Tsar Cannon is made of bronze; it weighs and has a length of . Its bronze-cast barrel has an internal diameter of , and an external diameter of . The barrel has eight cast rectangular brackets for use in transporting the gun, which is mounted on a stylized cast-iron gun carriage with three wheels. The barrel is decorated with relief images, including an equestrian image of Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich, with a crown and a scepter in his hand on horseback. Above the front right bracket the message &quot;The grace of God, Tsar and Great Duke Fyodor Ivanovich, Autocrat of All Russia&quot; was cast. There were two more labels cast at the top of the barrel, to the right is &quot;The decree of the faithful and Christ-king and the Grand Duke Fyodor Ivanovich, Sovereign Autocrat of all Great Russia with his pious and god-blessed queen, Grand Princess Irina&quot;; While to the one to the left is &quot;Cast in the city of Moscow in the summer of year 7904 (c. 1585 in Gregorian calendar), in his third summer state, by Andrey Chokov.&quot; The cannon-style gun carriage, added in 1835, is purely decorative. This weapon was never intended to be transported on or fired from this gun carriage.

According to one version, the name of this cannon, &quot;Tsar&quot;, is associated with the image of Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich. However, it is more likely that this name owes to the massive size of this cannon. In old times the cannon is also sometimes called the &quot;Russian Shotgun&quot; (Дробовик Российский, &quot;Drobovik Rossiyskiy&quot;, lit. Shotgun Russian), because the gun was meant to shoot 800 kg stone grapeshot rather than true, solid cannonballs.

The cannon ought to be classified as only a mortar by its barrel length in modern classification, with the barrel length at only 6 calibers. However, in the 17th to the 18th century, it was rather called a &quot;bombard cannon&quot;, since mortars at that time had barrel lengths of no more than 2.5 calibers, or 3.5 calibers at maximum for long-range mortars.

The spherical cast-iron projectiles located in front of the Tsar Cannon—each of which weighs approximately one ton—were produced in 1834 as a decoration, and are too large to have been used in the cannon. According to legend, the cannonballs were manufactured in St. Petersburg, and were intended to be a humorous addition and a symbol of the friendly rivalry between Moscow and St. Petersburg.

==History==

The cannon was cast in bronze in 1586, during the reign of Tsar Fyodor Ivanovich, in the Cannon yard, by Russian master Andrey Chokhov.

The carriages and the cannon itself were richly decorated in 1835 at the St. Petersburg plant of Berd, with designs by architect A. P. Bryullov and drawings engineer P. Ya. de Witte.

The Tsar Cannon was placed at several points around Moscow in its history. It is known to have been mounted on a special frame with a fixed inclination angle in the Red Square near the Place of Skulls in order to protect the eastern approaches to the Kremlin, indicating that it originally did have a practical application. However, by 1706, it was moved to the Kremlin Arsenal and mounted on a wooden gun carriage. It was not used during the French invasion of Russia, although Napoleon Bonaparte considered removing it to France as a war trophy. The wooden gun carriage burnt in the fire that consumed Moscow in 1812, and was replaced in 1835 by the present metal carriage, which disabled the firing function of the cannon.

In 1860, the Tsar Cannon was moved to its current location on Ivanovskaya Square near the Tsar Bell, which is similarly massive and is the largest bell in the world (but which has never been rung).

Voltaire joked that the Kremlin&#x27;s two greatest items were a bell which was never rung and a cannon that was never fired. For a long time, there was a common theory that the Tsar Cannon was created only to impress foreigners of Russia&#x27;s military powers. Thus, according to writer Albert Valentinov:&quot;...Andrey Chokov knew from the very first moment that this would not be a whopper cannon at all. Even if we assume that the barrel would fire grapeshot, a massive amount of propellant would be needed to push the two-ton shot, making it impossible for the cannon to be transported from one position to another. Therefore Chokhov did not mean to cast it as a functional cannon at all. His cannon is always only a symbol of Russian power and of the capabilities of the Russian industry. If we render a Russian master able to create such a whopper cannon, the smaller ones would have much less use. Therefore, the Tsar Cannon was put on display in the Kremlin for foreign diplomats.&quot;

The cannon was last restored in 1980 in the town of Serpukhov. It was thoroughly studied by specialists in the Artillery Academy at that time and gunpowder residue was found, indicating that the cannon had been fired at least once, hinged and dug into the ground.

Another theory by other researchers is that Tsar cannon never fired because of the bronze parts that would fade away after the shot, also due to the absence of a touch hole, which makes firing impractical. Although it could have been fired ceremonially with a long fuse and a reduced gunpowder load (and no shrapnel or cannon ball).

== Replicas ==

=== The Donetsk copy ===
In the spring of 2001, as commissioned by the management of the Moscow Udmort enterprise &quot;OAO Izhstal&quot;, a replica of the cannon was cast in iron. The replica weighed 42 tons, with a single wheel at 1.5 tons, the kernel at 1.2 meters and a caliber of exactly 89 cm.

This copy was given as a present from Moscow to Donetsk, which was installed in front of the Donetsk City Hall in May 2001. There were two copies, with the other one produced in Izhevsk set in the premises of OAO Izhstal.

=== The Yoshkar-Ola copy ===
In 2007, another replica was installed in front of the National Art Gallery in Yoshkar-Ola. This replica was made in a scale of 1:2. This replica is incomplete, with ornaments changed or absent, and other details missing. The kernel of the cannon weighs about 12 tons, with the barrel and the carriage cast in steel, and the wheels being solid. Three staples were installed on the cannon for fastening cables when moving it. It was cast on Zvenigovsky Shipyard named after N. S. Butyakov. Initially, the ornaments were cut from wood, and then cast from metal. The copy was suitable for shooting, as the barrel and the core were welded together. Four ornamental cannonballs are located next to the cannon.

== Perm Tsar Cannon ==
The Tsar Cannon located in Perm was the world&#x27;s largest 20-inch cast-iron cannon. Unlike other &quot;Tsar cannon&quot;s, the one in Perm was a military weapon. The cannon, nicknamed the &quot;Perm Giant&quot;, was made in 1868, by the order of the Ministry of Marine to the Motovilikha manufacturing plant (which is PAO &quot;Motovilikha Plants&quot; today, manufacturing weapon systems such as cannons, mortars, howitzers, self-propelled artillery, &quot;Grad&quot;, &quot;Uragan&quot; and &quot;Smerch&quot; rocket systems).

Tests were carried out with the gun on 16 August 1869, starting from firing from the shore of the Kama River (which is around 0.8–1 km wide). Later tests were carried out on this place until the end of Perestroika, with a lot happening in Soviet times. A certain F. V. Pestich, chief of the artillery of Kronstadt port attending most of the tests. The Perm cannon made a total of 314 shots, including grapeshot and bombs of different systems. As a result, the strength of the cannon was tested, and the weight of the powder charge was optimized. During the test, the charge weight was gradually increased to 120 kg. The set amount of propellant charge was 53 kg of black gunpowder in battle, putting the firing range to at most 1.2 km.

As quoted by writer Mikhail Osorgin, who witnessed the events:
=== Specifications ===
* Barrel length: 4.9 m
* Caliber: 20 inches (508 mm)
* Wall thickness: 180 mm (At the muzzle) / 450 mm (In breech)
* Barrel weight: 45.9 tons (2800 pudi) (The total weight of the Moscow Tsar Cannon is only 39.3 tons (2400 pudi))
* Total weight: 98.3 tons (6000 pudi)
* Kernel weight: 459 kg (30 pudi)
* Powder charge weight: 61 kg (4 pudi)
A model of the Perm Tsar Cannon in full size was put before the Russian Pavilion at the 1873 World Exhibition in Vienna.

The Perm cannon was to take its place in Kronstadt at Fort Constantine (Russia), where a special carriage was already installed to ensure all-around coverage, and to protect St. Petersburg from the sea. Two such cannons were also intended to equip the armored frigate &quot;Minin&quot;, which was built in St. Petersburg from 1866 to 1878.

However, the cannon never reached Kronstadt. The Giant has been returned to the road in Perm. This is due to the fact that the engineer-inventor Pavel Matveyevich Obukhov of Zlatoust has developed the technology to produce high-strength steel cannons. Having established a factory in St. Petersburg, he began producing lighter cannons, which were installed with breeched (the Krupp system), obsoleting the Perm cannon.

Emperor Alexander II&#x27;s decision saved it from destruction, instead preserving it as a historical relic.

Today, the Perm Tsar Cannon is held on exhibition in the open museum of military equipment belonging to PAO &quot;Motovilikha Plants&quot;.

<text>The Eurofighter Typhoon is in service with nine nations: United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Qatar, Kuwait, and Austria, with orders for all nine customers still pending as of September 2017. The aircraft has, as of 2016, been provided in a basic air-defense form and has been upgraded to newer production standards which include internal IRST, air-to-ground precision strike capability (with Royal Air Force Typhoons participating in air strikes destroying tanks in Libya in 2011 as their combat debut), and HMSS (helmet-mounted symbology system) helmets. Most of the major systems including the CAPTOR radar and the Defence Aids Sub-System (DASS) are expected to be improved and updated over time, with the radar being updated to an AESA, being the CAPTOR-E/CAESAR, of which the Kuwait Air Force will be the inaugural operator, with first deliveries of their 28 new-built aircraft to commence in 2019.

==Development aircraft==

Seven development aircraft (DA) were built with varying equipment fits and flight test roles.

;DA1 
:DA1&#x27;s main role was handling characteristics and engine performance.
:DA1 was assembled in 1992 and first flew on 27 March 1994 with Luftwaffe serial 98+29. The military evaluation phase commenced in 1996. In 1997 after 123 flights, DA1&#x27;s RB199 engines were replaced by EJ200s, it also was refitted with the Martin-Baker Mk.16A ejector seat and a full avionics fit. Following these modifications it rejoined the flight test programme in 1999. Following the loss of DA6, DA1 was transferred to Spain to undertake the remaining development work including IRIS-T trials.
:The aircraft was retired on 21 December 2005, eleven years, eight months, and 24 days after its first flight.
:It is on display at the &quot;Flugwerft Schleißheim&quot; (external site of the Deutsches Museum) near Munich, Germany.

;DA2 
:DA2 undertook envelope expansion, flight control assessment and load trials. The aircraft first flew on 6April 1994 as ZH588. The flight control assessment included development of the Eurofighter&#x27;s &quot;carefree handling&quot;. On 23 December 1997 DA2 became the first Eurofighter to achieve Mach2 and in January 1998 undertook refuelling trials with a RAF VC10. Like DA1, DA2 was upgraded in 1998 with new engines, ejector seat and avionics and rejoined the test programme in August. In 2000 the aircraft was covered with 490 pressure transducers; due to the fact that they were covered by black pads and had associated wiring the aircraft was painted in a gloss black scheme. The pressure transducers measured the effects of various weapons loads and external fuel tanks. In 2002 the aircraft undertook ASRAAM trials, completed carefree handling trials and commenced DASS decoy trials.
:Now retired and on display in the Milestones of Flight Gallery at the RAF Museum at Hendon.

;DA3 
:Weapons systems development.

;DA4 

:Twin-seat, radar and avionics development, previously on display between 2009 and 2024 at the Imperial War Museum Duxford. Repossessed by the Royal Air Force to serve as a training aid at RAF Cosford.

;DA5 
:Radar and avionics development, being upgraded to Tranche 2 standard. German and Spanish contract involved upgrading 130 Eurofighter Typhoon tranche 2 to latest AESA radar and avionics.

;DA6 
:Twin-seat, airframe development and handling. DA6 was lost in a crash in Spain in November 2002 after both engines failed. EADS Germany&#x27;s DA1 was transferred to EADS-CASA.

;DA7 
:Navigation, avionics and missile carriage. Now retired in Cameri IAF.

==Instrumented production aircraft==

The instrumented production aircraft (IPA) are five production standard aircraft fitted with telemetry instruments for dedicated flight testing and further systems development.

;IPA1 
:Defensive Aids Sub System (DASS).

;IPA2 
:Air-to-surface weapons integration.

;IPA3 
:Air-to-air weapons integration.

;IPA4 
:Air-to-surface weapons integration and environmental development.

;IPA5 
:Air-to-surface and air-to-air weapons integration.

;IPA6 
:Converted Series Production Aircraft (BS031)—Tranche 2 Computer Systems.

;IPA7 
:Converted Series Production Aircraft (GS0029)—Full Tranche 2 Standard.

;IPA8 
:E-Scan radar, enhanced weapon integration and improvements to mission equipment.

==Series production aircraft==

These are the operational and training aircraft. The model is known as Typhoon in the United Kingdom and export markets and as EF-2000 in Germany, Italy and Spain. However, all Italian aircraft carry the &quot;Typhoon&quot; logo on their tails.

===Tranche 1===

: Initial Operational Capability, Basic Air Defence Capability

;Block 2
: Air-to-air capabilities

;Block 5
: Air-to-air and air-to-ground capabilities, Final Operational Capability (FOC) standard. All Tranche1 aircraft are being upgraded to Block5 capability through the Retrofit 2 (R2) programme.

===Tranche 2===

;Block 8
: New hardware standard with new mission computer

;Block 10
:Enhanced Operational Capability (EOC) 1, improved DASS, IFF Mode 5, Rangeless ACMI
::Air/Air—AIM-120C-5 AMRAAM, IRIS-T digital
::Air/Ground—GBU-24, GPS-guided weapons, ALARM, Paveway III &amp; IV, Rafael LITENING III

;Block 15
: EOC 2
::Air/Air—METEOR,
::Air/Ground—TAURUS, Storm Shadow, Brimstone

;Block 20
: EOC 3

===Tranche 3 / Tranche 3A===

;Incorporating EOC 3 and hardware support for EOC 4
:Conformal fuel tanks, fibre optic cabling and computer upgrade, defensive system upgrades. The variants actually installed with the Captor-M mechanically scanned array radar because Captor-E AESA radar was not ready for use at the time. This Captor-E radar will be gradually installed on many of these aircraft as it has come into service. Tranche 3A of Kuwait Air Force is the first serial production batch to receive Captor-E during manufacturing. Captor-E equipped variants are more capable as a multirole combat aircraft.
::Air/Ground—SPEAR 3, Marte-ER, LITENING IV &amp; V

===Tranche 4===
;Latest production standard with unspecified upgrades building upon Tranche 3A specifications.
: Tranche 4 is a multirole combat aircraft with latest CAPTOR E AESA radar. According to Dirk Hoke, CEO Airbus Defence and Space, &quot;The new Tranche 4 Eurofighter is currently the most modern European-built combat aircraft with a service life well beyond 2060.&quot; Germany ordered 30 single-seater and 8 twin-seater Tranche 4 Eurofighters in late 2020 with cost of 5.4 billion euro. The latest order from Germany secures production of Eurofighter Typhoon until 2030. As part of German Eurofighter Typhoon contract, Hensoldt will produce AESA radar for Luftwaffe Eurofighter.
:Spain ordered 20 Tranche 4 in June 2022 and the upgrading of its existing Tranche 3 aircraft to the new standard.

==Operators==
===Italian Air Force aircraft===

As of July 2006 the Italian Air Force (Aeronautica Militare Italiana) had one EF-2000 wing, 4º Stormo (4th Wing), which received its first aircraft on 19 February 2004. The 36º Stormo received its first Typhoon on 1October 2007. By 2018 the Italian Air Force had three Eurofighter wings.

===Qatar Emiri Air Force aircraft===
On 25 August 2022 three newly built Eurofighter Typhoons jets destined to the QEAF (Qatar Emiri Air Force) departed the BAE Systems factory at Warton, UK, to Qatar on their delivery flight to Tamim Airbase, near Dukhan, approximately 80 kilometres west of Doha via Athens. 

===Spanish Air Force aircraft===

As of December 2006 the Spanish Air Force (Ejército del Aire) has one squadron of aircraft. The first aircraft was delivered to Wing 11 in October 2003 at Moron airbase, Spain. In Spanish service, the aircraft is designated the C.16 Typhoon.

===Luftwaffe aircraft===

As of October 2006 Germany had two active EF-2000 fighter wings, Jagdgeschwader 73 and Jagdgeschwader 74. JG 73 began converting to the Eurofighter in April 2004. JG 74 received its first aircraft on 25 June 2006.

===Royal Air Force aircraft===

The Typhoon replaced the RAF&#x27;s Tornado F3 (fighter) and Jaguar (ground attack) forces. They will equip five front-line squadrons, one front-line flight and one reserve squadron, the Operational Conversion Unit (OCU).

;Typhoon T1
:The Typhoon T1 is a Tranche 1, batch 1 two-seat trainer.

:The first Typhoon T1 is one of the Instrumented Production Aircraft (IPA1) and remains part of the BAE fleet. The aircraft&#x27;s maiden flight was on 15 April 2002. The official in service date for the first RAF Typhoon T1, serial ZJ803, was 30 June 2003. Formal delivery occurred on 18 December at which point 17 Sqn began a full flying programme.

:The first squadrons, No. 17 OEU and No. 29 OCU Sqns, moved to RAF Coningsby in 2005 to begin establishing an initial operational capability (IOC).

:In 2001, it was announced that the Royal Air Force (RAF) would not use the aircraft&#x27;s internal 27 mm Mauser cannon. This was due to a desire to save money by removing gun support costs, ammunition stocks, training costs, etc. The gun was also deemed unnecessary since the missile armament was believed to be adequate in the Typhoon&#x27;s fighter role. However, because removal of the cannon would affect the aircraft&#x27;s flight characteristics, requiring modification of the aircraft&#x27;s flight software the RAF decided all its Typhoons would be fitted with the cannon but that it would not be used or supported. The service argued that this would save money by reducing the requirement for ground equipment, removing training costs and avoiding the fatigue effects of firing the cannon. The RAF maintained the option to activate the cannons at very short notice were operational requirements to change. However, in a third change of policy, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on 3October 2006 that the RAF will fully utilise the cannon.

;Typhoon T1A 
:Typhoon T1As are Tranche 1, batch 2 two-seat trainers. There would not normally be a different designation for a different aircraft batch; however, the Batch2 aircraft has a fuel system modification to fix a fuel gauge problem identified in the development aircraft fleet.

;Typhoon F2
:The F2 is the single-seat fighter variant. The first F2 is IPA5 and also remains with BAE, its first flight was 6 June 2002.

:The first operational squadron, No. 3, formed at RAF Cottesmore on 31 March 2006 and moved to its new base RAF Coningsby the following day. No. 11 squadron, the second operational squadron received its first aircraft (ZJ931) on 9 October 2006.

As of June 2018, the RAF had bought 53 Tranche 1 Typhoons.
The UK agreed to approve production of &quot;Tranche 2&quot; in December 2004, this tranche will see the RAF receive a further 89 aircraft, bringing its Typhoon inventory to 144. This followed protracted negotiations regarding the early introduction of ground attack capabilities of the aircraft and hence its swing-role capability. While this was always planned it was intended to come at a much later date.

;Typhoon FGR4
:Single-seat Block 5 or later aircraft (built or upgraded from F2) are known as Typhoon FGR4s. The new mark number represents the increased capabilities of the Block 5 aircraft (fighter/ground attack/reconnaissance). The FGR4 has from June 2008 achieved the required standard for multi-role operations.

;Typhoon T3
:Two-seat Block 5 or later aircraft (built or upgraded from T1) are known as Typhoon T3s.

As of June 2018, the RAF has 67 Tranche 2 Typhoons and has contracted to purchase 40 Tranche3 Typhoons. 107 Tranche2 and3 Typhoons will be modified via &quot;Project Centurion&quot;, allowing them to utilise Meteor missiles, Brimstone and Storm Shadow missiles. 24 Tranche1 Typhoons will be retained for UK Quick Reaction Alert purposes, and will not be modified under Centurion. No. IX Squadron, based at RAF Lossiemouth, retains the Tranche1 Typhoon for QRA purposes but also serves the purpose of acting as an aggressor aircraft, similar to that of the USAF Lockheed Martin F-16 Fighting Falcon. These aircraft worked in conjunction with the 100 Squadron BAe Hawk T.1 aircraft based at RAF Leeming, providing air combat training and dogfight training to RAF and Royal Navy pilots.

In December 2021, the Ministry of Defence stated RAF Typhoons had shot down a drone in Syria, making this their first operational air-to-air engagement and the RAF&#x27;s first operational kill since 1982.

==Proposed versions==
===Navalised Typhoon===

Owing to the withdrawal of France from the Eurofighter 2000 project, in part due to France&#x27;s desire to have a greater role in the development and marketing of the aircraft, the pursuit of a naval Typhoon has never seriously been considered. However, a navalised variant of the aircraft was first proposed in the late 1990s as a potential solution to the UK Royal Navy&#x27;s need for a Future Carrier-Borne Aircraft (FCBA) for its new (&quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class) aircraft carriers.

In January 2001, the UK Ministry of Defence formally discounted the option of a navalised Eurofighter for its new aircraft carriers, in favour of the Joint Strike Fighter, which promised to be a more capable, versatile, low-cost and stealthy aircraft that would enter into service circa 2012—a date that tied in well with the in-service date for the new UK aircraft carriers as it stood at that time. The Typhoon, as well as the F/A-18E, Rafale M and an advanced variant of the Harrier were rejected by the United Kingdom on &quot;cost effectiveness grounds&quot;, selecting the Short Take Off &amp; Vertical Landing (STOVL) variant of the Joint Strike Fighter in 2002 as the primary option for Fleet Air Arm usage. The STOVL variant of the JSF would later be designated the F-35B Lightning II, entering service with the Fleet Air Arm in 2018.

While the navalised version of the Typhoon was ruled out by the MoD by 2011, there has been limited interest expressed by other nations, such as India, in adapting the Typhoon for aircraft carrier operations.

The proposed variant design would enable the Typhoon to operate from carriers on a Short Take-Off, Barrier Arrested Recovery (STOBAR) basis, using a &#x27;ski jump&#x27; ramp for aircraft launch and arresting gear for conventional landing.

In February 2011, BAE debuted a navalised Typhoon in response to the Indian tender. The model offered is STOBAR capable, corresponding to the Indian Navy&#x27;s future aircraft carrier, . The changes needed to enable the Typhoon to launch by ski-jump and recover by arrestor hook added about 500 kg to the airframe, however this is now thought to be substantially more given the Typhoon&#x27;s &quot;unfriendly&quot; design in terms of adapting the airframe to suit sustained naval operations. If the Indian Navy pursues a catapult launch carrier, the Typhoon is completely uncompetitive against tender rivals (e.g. Rafale and Super Hornet) since meeting &quot;...catapult requirements would add too much weight to the aircraft, blunt performance and add substantially to modification costs&quot;.

===Typhoon EK===

On 5 November 2019, Kurt Rossner, Head of Combat Aircraft Systems at Airbus, proposed an Electronic Combat Role (ECR)/Suppression of Enemy Air Defenses (SEAD) capability for the aircraft. The Typhoon ECR/SEAD would be configured with two Escort Jammer pods under the wings and two Emitter Location Systems built into the wingtips. Armament configuration would include four MBDA Meteor, two IRIS-T and six SPEAR-EW in addition to three drop tanks. The plane would be a two-seat variant carrying a mission specialist with access to dedicated electronic warfare and mission control screens.

On 14 March 2022, Christine Lambrecht, German Defense Minister announced that the German government would fund development of the Eurofighter ECR version.

On 29 November 2023, what was now being referred to as Eurofighter EK (, ) was approved by the budget committee of the German Bundestag. According to the German Air Force and Airbus, 15 existing Eurofighters were to be equipped with the Saab AB Arexis EW suite and Northrop Grumman AGM-88E Advanced Anti-Radiation Guided Missile (AARGM).

<text>Dewitt Clinton Senter (March 26, 1830June 14, 1898) was an American politician who served as the 18th Governor of Tennessee from 1869 to 1871. He had previously served in the Tennessee House of Representatives (1855–1861), where he opposed secession on the eve of the Civil War. He was elected to the Tennessee Senate following the war, and was chosen as Speaker of the Senate in 1867. As speaker, he became governor upon the resignation of William G. Brownlow in 1869.

Senter is perhaps best remembered for undoing many of Brownlow&#x27;s radical initiatives, most notably the restoring of the right to vote to former Confederates. The current Tennessee State Constitution was written and enacted during Senter&#x27;s tenure.

==Early life and career==
Senter was born in McMinn County, Tennessee, the son of William Tandy Senter and Nancy White. His father was a popular Methodist minister and renowned orator who served in the United States House of Representatives in the mid-1840s, and was a delegate to Tennessee&#x27;s 1834 constitutional convention. Dewitt grew up in what is now Hamblen County, Tennessee (then part of Grainger County), where he attended public schools. He studied at Strawberry Plains College in nearby Strawberry Plains from 1851 to 1852, and read law for about a year under Judge T.W. Turley.
He had predominantly English ancestry.

Senter represented Grainger County in the state House of Representatives from 1855 to 1861. A Whig, he remained staunchly opposed to secession on the eve of the Civil War. In May 1861, he voted against the state&#x27;s Ordinance of Secession, and canvassed in East Tennessee in an attempt to rally the region&#x27;s Unionists. He was a member of the Grainger County delegation at the East Tennessee Convention, which sought to form a separate, Union-aligned state in East Tennessee. In 1862, Senter was arrested and jailed for several months by Confederate authorities. After his release, he fled to Louisville, Kentucky. He was an elector for the Republican Party ticket in the 1864 presidential election.

In January 1865, Senter was elected to the Tennessee Senate, representing Grainger, Claiborne, Anderson, and Campbell counties, and served as the Senate&#x27;s Chairman of the Committee on Incorporations. That same year, he became president of the Cincinnati, Cumberland Gap and Charleston Railroad, a position in which he served until 1866. In 1867, the state senate elected him Speaker of the Senate.

==Governor==

Senter initially supported the Radical Republican initiatives of Governor William G. Brownlow, which included the disfranchisement of ex-Confederates. In October 1867, he helped elect Brownlow to the United States Senate seat held by David T. Patterson, whose term was set to expire in March 1869. Brownlow resigned as governor on February 25, 1869, and departed for Washington, D.C., to take his seat in the Senate. Under the Tennessee Constitution, the Speaker of the Senate is the first in the gubernatorial line of succession, and thus Senter became governor following Brownlow&#x27;s resignation.

Brownlow&#x27;s radical policies of disfranchisement had left the state divided and had led to the rise of the Ku Klux Klan. In his inaugural address, Senter vowed to aggressively pursue the Klan and quell Klan violence. In May 1869, however, he disbanded the state guard, which had been fighting the Klan, but had become unpopular. He also announced he supported restoring the voting rights of former Confederates.

Since Brownlow was near the end of his term as governor when he resigned, Senter was thrust into a reelection campaign within a few weeks of taking office. His relatively lenient policies toward former Confederates led to a rift in the state&#x27;s Radical Republican ranks, as many Radicals wanted to continue Brownlow&#x27;s policies and feared retribution if ex-Confederates and Democrats should once again control the state. At the Radicals&#x27; tumultuous convention on May 20, 1869, they were unable to agree on a candidate for governor. In subsequent separate conventions, the Radicals who favored continuing Brownlow&#x27;s policies nominated William B. Stokes, and those who favored more lenient policies nominated Senter.

Under Brownlow, the legislature had given the governor the power to appoint county election commissioners, who were charged with ensuring former Confederates did not vote. Using this power, Senter replaced nearly three-fourths of Brownlow&#x27;s commissioners. While the law still technically forbade ex-Confederates from voting, Senter&#x27;s new commissioners did not enforce this law. Thus, with large numbers of former Confederates now voting, Senter easily defeated Stokes on election day by a vote of 120,333 to 55,036.

To address issues over voting and disfranchisement, a new state constitutional convention convened in 1870. This convention, among other things, modified the state constitution to allow all men of at least 21 years of age (whether white or black) to vote, though it also instituted a poll tax, and ordered separate schools for white and black children. The new constitution was approved by a 98,128 to 33,972 vote.

Along with voting issues, one of Senter&#x27;s primary concerns was the state&#x27;s rising debt.
In December 1869, Senter called for prison reform, arguing that prisons had become a financial drain on the state. Hoping to encourage immigration into the state and increase property tax revenues, Senter established the Tennessee Immigration and Labor Association in February 1871. He also favored initiatives to help railroads struggling to pay interest on state-issued bonds.

In 1870, Senter used his influence to help establish Hamblen County, which was created from parts of Grainger, Jefferson, and Hawkins counties. Senter&#x27;s home was located within the new county.

==Later life==

Senter&#x27;s policies, which allowed Democrats to regain control of the state, angered the state&#x27;s Republicans, and effectively ended his political career. He spent his remaining years managing his large farm near Morristown. He died on June 14, 1898, and is buried in Morristown&#x27;s Emma Jarnagin Cemetery.

==Family==

Senter married Harriet Senter (a distant cousin) in 1859. She was the daughter of Grainger County&#x27;s circuit court clerk, P.M. Senter. They had no children.

<doc id="863685" wikidata="Q3508241" url="?curid=863685" title="Canadian Union of Public Employees">
<text>The Canadian Union of Public Employees (; CUPE–SCFP) is a Canadian trade union serving the public sector – although it has in recent years organized workplaces in the non-profit and para-public sector as well. CUPE–SCFP is the largest union in Canada, representing some 700,000 workers in health care, education, municipalities, libraries, universities, social services, public utilities, transportation, emergency services and airlines. Over 60 per cent of CUPE–SCFP&#x27;s members are women, and almost a third are part-time workers. CUPE–SCFP is affiliated with the Canadian Labour Congress and is its greatest financial contributor.

==History==
CUPE–SCFP was formed in 1963 in a fashion resembling industrial unionism by merging the National Union of Public Employees (NUPE) and the National Union of Public Service Employees (NUPSE). The first national president was Stan Little, who had previously been the president of NUPSE. Having led public sector unionism through a period where almost no workers had the right to strike, Little has been credited with bringing public sector unions &quot;from collective begging to collective bargaining.&quot; By the time of Little&#x27;s retirement, CUPE–SCFP had already grown to 210,000 members and had eclipsed United Steelworkers as the largest affiliate to the Canadian Labour Congress.

Little was followed in 1975 by Grace Hartman, a feminist activist who was the first woman to lead a major labour union in North America. Hartman led CUPE–SCFP to involve itself in broader struggles for social justice and equality, and emphasized the role of social unionism, as opposed to the more conservative business unionism practised by many North American unions. She was arrested for leading Ontario hospital workers in defying a back-to-work order from the Ontario Supreme Court in 1981 and sentenced to 45 days in jail. She retired in 1983.

Hartman&#x27;s successor as president was Jeff Rose, a Toronto city worker. Rose&#x27;s time as the defining face of CUPE–SCFP was marked by membership growth from 294,000 to 407,000 members (largely through organizing), a strengthening of CUPE–SCFP&#x27;s infrastructure and rank-and-file skills, and his outspoken opposition to Brian Mulroney-era wage restraint, free trade, the GST, privatization, deregulation, and cuts to public services. Under Rose&#x27;s leadership, CUPE–SCFP was particularly effective in improving pay and working conditions for women. He stepped down in 1991 after eight years, becoming deputy minister of intergovernmental affairs for the Ontario NDP government.

In 1991, Judy Darcy followed Rose and became the defining face of CUPE–SCFP. One of Canada&#x27;s most visible and colourful labour leaders, Darcy was a vigorous opponent of privatization, two-tier health care, and free trade agreements. Darcy was firmly committed to the union&#x27;s involvement in broader social issues, and under her tenure CUPE–SCFP strongly attacked the invasion of Iraq, condemned Canada&#x27;s involvement in ballistic missile defence, and spoke out loudly in favour of same-sex marriage. Darcy stepped down in 2003 after 12 years as president, and was replaced by Paul Moist.

On November 4, 2022, more than 55,000 CUPE–SCFP education workers began an indefinite strike against the Ontario government. Ontario Premier Doug Ford attempted to stop the strike by using the notwithstanding clause, which was criticized by Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as &quot;wrong and inappropriate.&quot;

During the 2023 Hamas-led attack on Israel, Fred Hahn, general vice president of CUPE, tweeted: &quot;Palestine is rising, long live the resistance.&quot; Eighty Jewish members of CUPE took Hahn and CUPE Ontario to the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal, saying they felt “isolated, unwelcome, scared, silenced, discriminated against, threatened and harassed” by the way their union had responded since the October 7 attack.

In August 2024, National President Mark Hancock said that Hahn had been asked to respond to a request from the union’s national executive board that he resign due to a social media video post by Hahn that Hancock called &quot;antisemitic.&quot; Hahn, for his part, said that he was refusing to step down. Richard Marceau, vice president of the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs (CIJA), opined that CUPE should remove Hahn. Carrie Silverberg, one of the people who signed on to the human-rights complaint against CUPE, called Hahn&#x27;s video “blatantly anti-Semitic”. Ontario’s labour minister, Dave Piccini, confronted Hahn and asked him to stop being anti-Semitic, and Premier Doug Ford said that Hahn&#x27;s post was &quot;bigoted&quot;. Hancock said that if Hahn does not resign on his own, &quot;that’ll be new ground again for CUPE and me as a national president. I will review options available to me.&quot;

==Internal organization==
CUPE–SCFP has an extremely decentralized structure, in which each local elects its own executive, sets its own dues structure, conducts its own bargaining and strike votes, and sends delegates to division and national conventions to form overarching policy. Advocates of this system claim that it places the power in the grassroots where it belongs; critics believe that it makes it difficult for it to organize concerted action and leaves the union highly balkanized with policies and strategies varying widely from local to local and sector to sector. This decentralized structure is often described as &quot;CUPE–SCFP&#x27;s greatest strength and its greatest weakness.&quot; This political decentralization is mirrored by an organizational decentralization. Although CUPE–SCFP has a national headquarters in Ottawa, it is relatively small—the vast majority of its staff are scattered across over 70 offices across the country.

CUPE–SCFP locals are affiliated directly to the National body, and affiliation in Provincial CUPE–SCFP bodies is optional. CUPE–SCFP National provides locals with support and assistance through National Representatives, who are employees of CUPE–SCFP National. National Representatives are assigned to specific locals to assist the democratically elected officers of CUPE–SCFP locals in various aspects of the operation and functioning of the local union. They primarily assist in more complex issues, such as conducting Grievance Arbitrations, bargaining, disability/accommodation issues, human rights, preparation of legal documents, local elections and education. National Representatives also have authority to place a CUPE–SCFP local under administration, pursuant to the CUPE–SCFP Constitution, which effectively means that the Representative runs the local for a brief period of time in an extraordinary circumstance and suspends the locally elected officers, usually only in very serious cases of fraud or gross incompetence or misconduct. In addition to servicing National Representatives, CUPE–SCFP National employs Research Representatives and Legal &amp; Legislative Representatives, who provide research and legal support to locals through their servicing representatives.

Nationally, there are two full-time political positions: the National President (currently Mark Hancock) and the National Secretary-Treasurer (currently Candace Rennick).

==Provincial divisions==

CUPE–SCFP divisions are the political voice of members in their respective provinces, and an integral part of CUPE–SCFP. Chartered through the national union, each division advocates and campaigns at the provincial level for legislative, policy and political change in the interests of CUPE–SCFP members and the communities they serve. Each provincial division is led by a democratically elected president, secretary-treasurer and executive board, who are directed by members at annual conventions (biennial in Quebec). Provincial organizations do not provide any servicing or support to the locals on specific operational items, focusing primarily on provincial lobbying, policy development and union education.

==Internal labour relations==

CUPE–SCFP&#x27;s employees have organized into two main bargaining units. The Canadian Staff Union (CSU) is the larger of the groups. It represents National Representatives and specialist staff in Area and Region Offices across the 10 Regions of CUPE–SCFP. In 2008, CSU absorbed the Administrative and Technical Staff Union which represented about 60 administrative and technical staff at the Ottawa National Office. The Canadian Office and Professional Employees union (COPE) Local 491 represents support staff workers in the national, regional and area offices of CUPE–SCFP. Additionally, a handful of CUPE–SCFP Locals have dedicated CUPE–SCFP staff working in their own offices.

<text>Frederick Cheney LaRue Sr. (October 11, 1928 – July 24, 2004) was an aide in the administration of U.S. President Richard Nixon. He served a short prison sentence for his role in the Watergate break-in and the subsequent Watergate scandal and cover-up. 

Oddly, LaRue had no rank, title, salary, or even listing in the White House directory. LaRue was present at an early meeting with his friend, United States Attorney General John N. Mitchell, at which the Watergate burglary was planned. Afterwards, LaRue assisted the cover-up, supervising the shredding of documents and the destruction of financial records.

==Biography==
In 1957, LaRue accidentally shot and killed his father while hunting with friends in Canada.

With his newfound wealth, LaRue invested in many failed business ventures including casinos in Havana, Cuba, prior to the communist revolution, and in Las Vegas, Nevada. He also used his wealth to become a political financier and served as a member of the Republican National Committee from 1963 until 1968.

He was a heavy financial contributor to Barry Goldwater&#x27;s presidential campaign in 1964. He was also a longtime friend of the Mississippi Democratic U.S. Senator James Eastland.

After Goldwater lost the election, LaRue began getting involved with Nixon&#x27;s career. LaRue was one of the principal planners of Nixon&#x27;s so-called &quot;Southern strategy&quot; for winning the election. He coordinated with the campaign office of Strom Thurmond, the veteran U.S. Senator from South Carolina.

===Nixon supporter, advisor to Attorney General John Mitchell===

LaRue also recommended the use of a &quot;special ballad-type song in the current &#x27;country-and-western music style, by which nationally famous artists will sing the message via the radio and TV.&quot; The song was called &quot;Bring Our Country Back&quot; and included &quot;alternate&quot; lyrics with the couplet: &quot;Dick Nixon is a decent man/Who can bring our country back.&quot; LaRue proposed broadcasting the song by local radio and television programs throughout the South. However, he had difficulty finding artists to perform the song; most that he contacted either sympathized with George Wallace, the former governor of Alabama, or did not want to help Nixon. Eventually, LaRue managed to convince Roy Acuff and Tex Ritter, who were unsuccessful Republican candidates themselves for governor and U.S. senator, respectively, in the state of Tennessee, to perform versions of the song.

LaRue coordinated with Eastland to obtain the confirmation of Nixon&#x27;s judicial nominees. He has been described as a special assistant in an &quot;advisory capacity&quot; to then Attorney General Mitchell.

On March 30, 1972, LaRue attended a meeting in Key Biscayne, Florida, with Mitchell and Jeb Magruder. Mitchell, having announced his resignation as attorney general on February 15, assumed his new duties as head of the Committee to Re-elect the President, effective on March 1. The March 30 meeting has been the subject of great dispute among its three participants. According to Magruder, the three men approved the so-called Operation Gemstone and other aspects of a &quot;dirty tricks&quot; campaign against the Democratic Party. LaRue and Mitchell, to their deaths, always denied this vehemently. In 2003, Magruder stated, for the first time, that it was at this meeting that President Nixon, speaking to Mitchell by telephone, voiced specific approval for the Watergate burglary. Mitchell and Nixon had both been dead for years, and Fred LaRue denied Magruder&#x27;s claim publicly.

====&quot;Bagman&quot; for Watergate burglary pay-off====

LaRue was known as the &quot;bagman&quot; because he delivered more than $300,000 in cash (&quot;hush money&quot;) to the conspirators and their attorneys to keep participants of the Watergate burglary quiet. LaRue was the first Administration official to plead guilty to crimes related to his involvement with the Watergate burglary and the cover-up.

He pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice on June 27, 1973 and served four and a half months in custody at the Maxwell Air Force Base near Montgomery, Alabama. LaRue&#x27;s fellow Watergate-convicts John Mitchell and Charles Colson also served their prison time at Maxwell AFB.

===Life after prison===

LaRue refused to testify against Nixon or any other Watergate figure. One of Nixon&#x27;s first public appearances after his resignation as president came three years later in 1977 at a &quot;Salute to the Military&quot; in Biloxi, directed by LaRue.

LaRue died in Biloxi, Mississippi on July 24, 2004.

<text>An Irish bull is a ludicrous, incongruent or logically absurd statement, generally unrecognized as such by its author. The inclusion of the epithet &quot;Irish&quot; is a late addition.

John Pentland Mahaffy, Provost of Trinity College, Dublin, observed, &quot;an Irish bull is always pregnant&quot;, i.e. with truthful meaning.
The &quot;father&quot; of the Irish bull is often said to be Sir Boyle Roche,
who once asked &quot;Why should we put ourselves out of our way to do anything for posterity, for what has posterity ever done for us?&quot;. Roche may have been Sheridan&#x27;s model for Mrs Malaprop.

== Origin ==
The derivation of &quot;bull&quot; in this sense is unclear. It may be related to Old French &quot;boul&quot; &quot;fraud, deceit, trickery&quot;, Icelandic &quot;bull&quot; &quot;nonsense&quot;, Middle English &quot;bull&quot; &quot;falsehood&quot;, or the verb &quot;bull&quot; &quot;befool, mock, cheat&quot;.

As the Oxford English Dictionary points out, the epithet &quot;Irish&quot; is a more recent addition, the original word &quot;bull&quot; for such nonsense having been traced back at least to the early 17th century. By the late 19th century the expression &quot;Irish bull&quot; was well known, but writers were expressing reservations such as: &quot;But it is a cruel injustice to poor Paddy to speak of the genuine &#x27;bull&#x27; as something distinctly Irish, when countless examples of the same kind of blunder, not a whit less startling, are to be found elsewhere.&quot; The passage continues, presenting Scottish, English and French specimens in support.

==Examples==

*&quot;He&#x27;ll regret it till his dying day, if ever he lives that long.&quot; – &quot;Red&quot; Will Danaher, in &quot;The Quiet Man&quot;
*&quot;If I could drop dead right now, I&#x27;d be the happiest man alive.&quot; – Samuel Goldwyn, movie producer (1882–1974)
*&quot;Always go to other people&#x27;s funerals, otherwise they won&#x27;t come to yours.&quot; – Misattributed to Yogi Berra, baseball player (1925–2015)
*&quot;There&#x27;ll be people dying in this town who&#x27;ve never f---ing died before&quot; – Belfast taxi driver
*&quot;to make an Irish bull, I should expect the next stage in Evolution not to be a stage in Evolution at all&quot; – C.S. Lewis, in Mere Christianity

<doc id="863698" wikidata="Q1935680" url="?curid=863698" title="Oval track racing">
<text>Oval track racing is a form of motorsport that is contested on an oval-shaped race track. An oval track differs from a road course in that the layout resembles an oval with turns in only one direction, and the direction of traffic is almost universally counter-clockwise. Oval tracks are dedicated motorsport circuits, used predominantly in the United States. They often have banked turns and some, despite the name, are not precisely oval, and the shape of the track can vary.
Major forms of oval track racing include stock car racing, open-wheel racing, sprint car racing, modified car racing, midget car racing and dirt track motorcycles.

Oval track racing is the predominant form of auto racing in the United States. According to the 2013 National Speedway Directory, the total number of oval tracks, drag strips and road courses in the United States is 1,262, with 901 of those being oval tracks and 683 of those being dirt tracks. Among the most famous oval tracks in North America are the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Daytona International Speedway and Talladega Superspeedway.

== Oval racing ==

===Pack racing===

Pack racing is a phenomenon found on fast, high-banked superspeedways. It occurs when the vehicles racing are cornering at their limit of aerodynamic drag, but within their limit of traction. This allows drivers to race around the track constantly at wide open throttle. Since the vehicles are within their limit of traction, drafting through corners will not hinder a vehicle&#x27;s performance. As cars running together are faster than cars running individually, all cars in the field will draft each other simultaneously in one large pack. In stock car racing this is often referred to as &quot;restrictor plate racing&quot; because NASCAR mandates that each car on its two longest high-banked ovals, Talladega and Daytona, use an air restrictor to reduce horsepower.

The results of pack racing may vary. As drivers are forced to race in a confined space, overtaking is very common as vehicles may travel two and three abreast. This forces drivers to use strong mental discipline in negotiating traffic. There are drawbacks, however. Should an accident occur at the front of the pack, the results could block the track in a short amount of time. This leaves drivers at the back of the pack with little time to react and little room to maneuver. The results are often catastrophic as numerous cars may be destroyed in a single accident. This type of accident is often called &quot;The Big One&quot;.

===Comparison with road racing===
Oval track racing requires different tactics than road racing. While the driver does not have to shift gears nearly as frequently, brake as heavily or as often, or deal with turns of various radii in both directions as in road racing, drivers are still challenged by negotiating the track. Where there is generally one preferred line around a road course, there are many different lines that can work on an oval track. The preferred line depends on many factors including track conditions, car set-up, and traffic. The oval track driver must choose which line to use each time they approach a corner. On a short track in a 25-lap feature race, a driver might not run any two laps with the same line. Both types of racing place physical demands on the driver. A driver in an IndyCar race at Richmond International Raceway may be subject to as many lateral g-forces (albeit in only one direction) as a Formula One driver at Silverstone.

Weather also plays a different role in each discipline. Road racing offers a variety of fast and slow corners that allow the use of rain tires. Paved oval tracks generally do not run with a wet track surface. Dirt ovals will sometimes support a light rain. Some tracks (e.g., Evergreen Speedway in Monroe, WA) have &quot;rain or shine&quot; rules requiring races to be run in the rain.

Safety has also been a point of difference between the two. While a road course usually has abundant run-off areas, gravel traps, and tire barriers, oval tracks usually have a concrete retaining wall separating the track from the fans. Innovations have been made to change this, however. The SAFER barrier was created to provide a less dangerous alternative to a traditional concrete wall. The barrier can be retrofitted onto an existing wall or may take the place of a concrete wall completely.

==Track classification ==
Oval tracks are classified based upon their size, surface, banking, and shape.

=== By size ===
Their size can range from only a few hundred feet to over two and a half miles. The definitions used to differentiate track sizes have changed over the years. While some tracks use terms such as &quot;speedway&quot; or &quot;superspeedway&quot; in their name, they may not meet the specific definitions used in this article.

==== Short track ====

A short track is an oval track less than one mile (1.6 km) long, with the majority being 0.5 miles (0.8 km) or shorter. Drivers seeking careers in oval track racing generally serve their apprenticeship on short tracks before moving up to series which compete on larger tracks. Due to their short length and fast action, these tracks are often nicknamed &quot;bullrings&quot;. Professional-level NASCAR races on short tracks usually use a 500-lap or 400-lap distance. Short tracks in many cases have lights installed and routinely host night races. The short ovals still form the backbone of NASCAR in the feeder series. Three race tracks of this type are also represented in the Cup: Bristol, Martinsville and Richmond. Tracks with potential for future cup races are the Iowa Speedway built in 2006, the Nashville Fairgrounds Speedway used until 1984 in the Cup, and the Memphis Motorsports Park, which had races of the Busch Series back then until the 2000s. The Auto Club Speedway is to be converted from a 2-mile super speedway to a 1/2 mile short track in 2024.

==== Mile oval ====
Synonymous with the name, a 1-mile (1.61 km) oval is a popular and common length for oval track racing. The exact measurements, however, can vary by as much as a tenth of a mile and still fall into this category. Most mile ovals are relatively flat-banked, with Dover being a notable exception.

Many 1-mile dirt ovals were used by stock cars or champ cars before race tracks with dirt surfaces were removed from the racing calendar in the early 1970s. Many of these racetracks got the nickname &quot;Fairgrounds” — for example Arizona State Fairgrounds, California State Fairgrounds and Michigan State Fairgrounds Speedway. The origin of these racetracks was in harness racing, which commonly used 1-mile tracks. Also, the oldest oval race track, the Milwaukee Mile was originally a race track for horse racing.

In NASCAR, 1-mile oval tracks are among the intermediate tracks. IndyCar rates these tracks as short ovals, since IndyCar does not usually run on ovals shorter than 3/4-mile. The 1-mile ovals have lost a great deal of their former importance for oval racing. Most of the racetracks abandoned by NASCAR or IndyCar in the 2000s were of this type. These include the Chicago Motor Speedway and the Walt Disney World Speedway, which were built during the 1990s construction boom but used for only four years. The historic Nazareth Speedway, which was paved in 1986, was completely abandoned after the 2004 season. Physically, many mile oval still exist such as the Rockingham Speedway and the Pikes Peak International Raceway. However, these racetracks have not been used by nationally important motorsports events for years. There are only three 1-mile tracks left on the NASCAR racing calendar: Phoenix, Loudon, and Dover. IndyCar only returned to 1-mile oval racing with the addition of the Milwaukee Mile in 2024 after 9 years of it being off the schedule.

==== Intermediate ====

Also referred to with the general term of &quot;speedway&quot;, these courses are 1 to 2 miles (1.6 to 3.2 km) in length, but the term is particularly reserved for 1.5-mile (2.4 km) tracks. At the beginning of the history of NASCAR and IndyCar, this oval size was not very common. Until 1990, there were only five examples. Two of these, the Marchbanks Speedway (1.4 miles) and the Trenton Speedway (1.5 miles), were demolished in the 1970s and 1980s, and only three—Charlotte Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway and Darlington Raceway—have survived to this day. All other ovals of this type were built after 1994. During the race track construction boom of the late 1990s, these tracks began to be labeled with the rather derogatory term &quot;cookie cutter&quot; tracks, as their differences were perceived to be minimal.

In 1992, Charlotte became the first intermediate track to install lights and allow for night racing. It is now commonplace for these types of tracks to host night races. Intermediate tracks usually have moderate to steep banking. Almost all modern race tracks that are still used in NASCAR and IndyCar today are of this type. Since their size allows them to compromise high speeds with sightlines, especially tri- and quad-ovals of 1.5-mile length have become commonplace in major racing series that use oval tracks.

While intermediate speedways were designed primarily with stock cars in mind, they were also believed to be suited to host Indy cars as well. In the early years of the Indy Racing League, the series visited several intermediate tracks. The higher-downforce, normally aspirated IRL-type cars proved to be competitive at several of the tracks. The CART series however, mostly stayed away as the faster, more powerful Champ Cars were generally thought to be too fast for this type of circuit. This became evident at the 2001 Firestone Firehawk 600, when drivers experienced vertigo-like symptoms, and the race was cancelled for safety reasons. As of 2020, the IndyCar Series has only one race remaining at a high-banked intermediate track (Texas). These tracks began to be removed from the Indy car schedule in the late-2000s and early-2010s due to low crowds and serious crashes, including the fatal accident involving Dan Wheldon at Las Vegas in 2011.

==== Superspeedway ====
Originally a superspeedway was an oval race track with a length of one mile or more. Since the introduction of the intermediate oval, Superspeedway is an oval race course of 2 miles or longer. There are six active superspeedways in the United States, the most famous being Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Daytona International Speedway, both long. These tracks were built in 1909 and 1959 respectively. Indianapolis Motor Speedway was built as a facility for the automotive industry to conduct research and development. Daytona International Speedway was built as a replacement for the Daytona Beach Road Course, which combined the town&#x27;s main street and its famous beach. Daytona hosts the Daytona 500, NASCAR&#x27;s most prestigious race, while the Indianapolis Motor Speedway is home to the Indianapolis 500 and the Brickyard 400.
The longest superspeedway in North America is the Talladega Superspeedway in Talladega, Alabama. Built in 1969, it is long, and holds the current record for fastest speed in a stock car, lapping at an average of and reaching at the end of the backstretch. Daytona and Talladega are the pinnacle of stock car superspeedway racing, where restrictor plates are mandated by the sport&#x27;s ruling body to reduce the high speeds accommodated by their steep banking since 1988.

Other superspeedways used by NASCAR include the Michigan International Speedway (2.0 miles), Auto Club Speedway (known as California Speedway prior to February 2008) (2.0 miles), and Pocono Raceway (2.5 miles). Auto Club Speedway and Michigan are often considered intermediate tracks by NASCAR due to their similarities with 1.5-mile tracks, while Pocono and Indianapolis are sometimes classified separately, as they are the only long, flat tracks on the schedule. Auto Club Speedway, which joined Indianapolis, Michigan and Pocono as the one of four superspeedways used in the Verizon IndyCar Series, was the site of Gil de Ferran&#x27;s qualifying lap of in the CART FedEx Championship Series in 2000, the fastest qualifying lap recorded at an official race meeting. Due to the low number of spectators or safety concerns by the drivers, IndyCar will no longer drive super speedways outside of Indianapolis. Michigan Speedway was part of the series from 2002 to 2007, AutoClub Speedway from 2002 to 2005 and a second time from 2012 to 2015, Pocono was used by IndyCar between 2014 and 2019. In NASCAR they are still an essential part of the racing calendar.

The closed and partially demolished Texas World Speedway, was the original &quot;sister track&quot; to Michigan. The two-mile oval, with its 22-degree banking, was the site of Mario Andretti&#x27;s closed-course record of which stood for 12 years. No major professional series have raced at TWS since the 1990s.

The 2.5 mile Ontario Motor Speedway was known as the &quot;Indianapolis of the West&quot;, but was bought by the Chevron Land Company in 1980 and partitioned for development.

==== Track length disputes ====
NASCAR and IndyCar use different measuring systems to measure the oval race tracks. As a result, the racetracks have lengths of different accuracy. The following table shows the values that NASCAR, IndyCar and CART/CCWS used to determine the lap speeds and track records.

=== By shape ===
A typical oval track consists of two parallel straights, connected by two 180° turns. Although most ovals generally have only two radii curves, they are usually advertised and labeled as four 90° turns. While many oval tracks conform to the traditional symmetrical design, asymmetrical tracks are not uncommon.

==== Classical geometric shapes ====

Additional prominent examples:

==== Tri-ovals ====
The tri-oval is the common shape of the ovals from the construction booms of the 1960s and 1990s. The use of the tri-oval shape for automobile racing was conceived by Bill France, Sr. during the planning for Daytona. The triangular layout allowed fans in the grandstands an angular perspective of the cars coming towards and moving away from their vantage point. Traditional ovals (such as Indianapolis) offered only limited linear views of the course, and required fans to look back and forth much like a tennis match. The tri-oval shape prevents fans from having to &quot;lean&quot; to see oncoming cars, and creates more forward sight lines. The modern tri-ovals were often called as &quot;cookie cutters&quot; because of their (nearly) identical shape and identical kind of races.

Additional prominent examples:

==== Unique shapes ====
There are a lot of oval tracks, which neither have a classical geometric shape nor still represent a modern tri-oval in the strict sense. While these courses still technically fall under the category of ovals, their unique shape, flat corners, hard braking zones, or increased difficulty, often produces driving characteristics similar to those of a road course.


==== Concentric oval track / legends oval ====
Some facilities feature several ovals track of different sizes, often sharing part of the same front straightaway. The now defunct Ascot Speedway featured 1/2 mile and 1/4 mile dirt oval tracks, and Irwindale Speedway features 1/2 mile and 1/3 mile concentric paved oval tracks. Pocono Raceway once had a 3/4 mile oval which connected to the main stretch, and circled around the garage area.

In 1991, Charlotte Motor Speedway connected the quad oval start-finish straight to the pit lane with two 180 degree turns, resulting in a concentric 1/4-mile oval layout. The 1/4-mile layout became a popular venue for legends car racing. The name &quot;legends oval&quot; was derived from this use. They have also seen use with go-karts, short track stock cars, and other lower disciplines. This idea was adopted by numerous tracks including Texas Motor Speedway, Atlanta Motor Speedway, Kentucky Speedway, Las Vegas Motor Speedway, and Iowa Speedway which has a 1/8 mile version.

Perhaps the most unusual concentric oval facility is Dover Speedway-Dover Downs. The one-mile oval track encompasses a 0.625-mile harness racing track inside.

=== By banking / superelevation ===
Oval tracks usually have slope in both straight and in curves, but the slope on the straights is less, circuits without any slope are rare to find, low-slope are usually old or small tracks, high gradient are more common in new circuits.

Circuits like Milwaukee Mile and Indianapolis Motor Speedway have 9° banking in the turns and are considered low banked, superspeedways like Talladega have up to 33° of tilt in curves, Daytona has up to 32°, both are considered high banked. Atlanta is the intermediate track with the highest banking, 28°. Winchester has the highest banking of any active oval track with 37°


=== By surface ===

Track surfaces can be dirt, concrete, asphalt, or a combination of concrete and asphalt. Some ovals in the early twentieth century had wood surfaces. Indianapolis Motor Speedway&#x27;s track surface used to be made entirely of bricks, and today, 3 feet (0.91 m), or one yard, of original bricks remain exposed at the start-finish line. Each was hand laid over a 2-inch (51 mm) cushion of sand, then leveled and the gaps filled with mortar. Before the work was completed, locals nicknamed the track &quot;The Brickyard&quot;.

==Combined road course==


A combined road course, colloquially referred to as a &quot;roval&quot; (a blend word combining &quot;road course&quot; and &quot;oval&quot;) is an oval track racing facility that features a road course in the infield (and/or outfield), that is usually linked to the oval circuit. This type of course makes for a multi-purpose track, and allows the facility to be used for both oval and road racing. A typical combined road course consists of the oval portion of the track, using the same start/finish line, and same pit area, but a mid-course diversion to a winding road circuit in the infield (and/or outfield). At some point, the circuit leads back to the main oval, and completes the rest of the lap. On some of the faster ovals, a chicane is present on long back-straights, to keep speeds down, and create additional braking/passing zones. Some more complex facilities feature a stand-alone road course layout(s) in the infield not directly linked to the oval layout, or otherwise using only a short portion of the oval.

Combined road courses combine the high speed characteristics of ovals with the technical precision of road courses. It allows road racing disciplines the unique experience of being held in the stadium style atmosphere of an oval superspeedway. Numerous combined road courses saw widespread use with sports cars in the 1970s and early 1980s. However, their use at the professional level has since diminished considerably, since most layouts lacked the desirable topography and competitive challenges of natural road courses. In addition, most combined road course circuits offer poor sightlines for fans sitting in the grandstands. Oftentimes the challenging infield portion is obscured or not visible at all from the grandstands that line the circumference of the oval track, so many fans choose to view from the ground level inside the infield – leaving the grandstands mostly empty and unsightly.

Many combined road course layouts have been abandoned. However, some have enjoyed extended life as venues for testing, driving schools, and amateur race meets. Since 1962, the most famous race continuously held on a combined road course has been the 24 Hours of Daytona. Since 2018, NASCAR has held the Bank of America Roval 400 on a combined course at Charlotte.

In some rare examples, the combined road course layout is run in the opposite direction to the oval circuit. For instance, at Indianapolis the oval is run counter-clockwise, but the combined road course used during the IndyCar Series Grand Prix of Indianapolis is run clockwise. However the MotoGP races were run counter-clockwise, with some reconfigured corners to fix corner apex problems. Michigan was also an example of a clockwise combined road course. Another example is the Adelaide International Raceway in Australia which combines a 2.41 km (1.50 mi) road course with an 0.805 km (0.500 mi) speedway bowl. The Bowl forms a permanent part of the road course and also runs clockwise. At many tracks, multiple configurations are available for the combined road course layout(s).

An example of an outfield combined road course can be seen at the Calder Park Raceway in Melbourne, Australia. The Calder Park complex has a 1.119 mi (1.801 km) high-banked oval speedway called the Thunderdome as well as a separate road course. The road course and the oval can be linked via two short roads that connect the front straight of the road course to the back straight of the oval. As they are separate tracks, this creates a unique situation where different races can actually be run on both the oval and the full road course at the same time. Also unique is that unlike most combined circuits which use the oval track&#x27;s start/finish line and pits, in the case of Calder Park it is the road course start/finish line and pits that are used. This configuration was used only twice (both in 1987) and has not been used for major motor racing since hosting Round 9 of the 1987 World Touring Car Championship.
==Oval track construction booms in North America==
There have been two distinct oval race track construction &quot;booms&quot; in the United States. The first took place in the 1960s, and the second took place in the mid-to-late 1990s. The majority of tracks from the 1960s boom and the 1990s boom have survived, but some tracks failed to achieve long-term financial success. Incidentally, these two booms loosely coincided with the similar construction boom of the baseball/football cookie-cutter stadiums of the 1960s and 1970s, and the subsequent sport-specific stadium construction boom that began in the 1990s.

<doc id="863704" wikidata="Q720050" url="?curid=863704" title="Compressed natural gas">
<text>Compressed natural gas (CNG) is a fuel gas mainly composed of methane (CH4), compressed to less than 1% of the volume it occupies at standard atmospheric pressure. It is stored and distributed in hard containers at a pressure of , usually in cylindrical or spherical shapes.

CNG is used in traditional petrol/internal combustion engine vehicles that have been modified, or in vehicles specifically manufactured for CNG use: either alone (dedicated), with a segregated liquid fuel system to extend range (dual fuel), or in conjunction with another fuel (bi-fuel). It can be used in place of petrol, diesel fuel, and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). CNG combustion produces fewer undesirable gases than the aforementioned fuels. In comparison to other fuels, natural gas poses less of a threat in the event of a spill, because it is lighter than air and disperses quickly when released. Biomethane, biogas from anaerobic digestion or landfill, can be used.

In response to high fuel prices and environmental concerns, CNG has been used in auto rickshaws, pickup trucks, transit and school buses, and trains.

The cost and placement of fuel storage containers is the major barrier to wider/quicker adoption of CNG as a fuel. It is also why municipal government, public transportation vehicles were the most visible early adopters of it, as they can more quickly amortize the money invested in the new (and usually cheaper) fuel. In spite of these circumstances, the number of vehicles in the world using CNG has grown steadily (30 percent per year). Now, as a result of the industry&#x27;s steady growth, the cost of such fuel storage cylinders has been brought down to a much more acceptable level. Especially, for the CNG Type 1 and Type 2 cylinders, many countries are able to make reliable and cost effective cylinders for conversion need.

==Energy density==
CNG&#x27;s energy density is the same as liquefied natural gas at 53.6 MJ/kg. Its volumetric energy density, 9 MJ/L, is 42 % of that of LNG (22 MJ/L) because it is not liquefied, and is 25 percent that of diesel fuel.

== History ==

Gases provided the original fuel for internal combustion engines. The first experiments with compressed gases took place in France in the 1850s. Natural gas first became a transport fuel during World War I. In the 1960s, Columbia Natural Gas of Ohio tested a CNG carrier. The ship was to carry compressed natural gas in vertical pressure bottles; however, this design failed because of the high cost of the pressure vessels. Since then, there have been attempts at developing a commercially viable CNG carrier. Several competing CNG ocean transport designs have evolved. Each design proposes a unique approach to optimizing gas transport, while using as much off-the-shelf technology as possible, to keep costs competitive.

== Uses ==
=== Motor vehicles ===
Worldwide, there were 14.8 million natural gas vehicles (NGVs) by 2011, with the largest numbers in Iran (4.07 million), Pakistan (2.85 million), Argentina (2.07 million), Brazil (1.7 million) and India (1.1 million), with the Asia-Pacific region leading with 5.7 million NGVs, followed by Latin America with almost four million vehicles.

Several car and vehicle manufacturers, such as Fiat, Opel/General Motors, Peugeot, Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda, Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Tata Motors, and others, sell bi-fuel cars.In 1995, The Supreme Court of India decided that cars put into circulation after 1995 would have to run on unleaded fuel. At the beginning of 2005, 10,300 CNG busses and 20,000 CNG cars ran on Delhi’s roads. In 2006 Fiat Siena Tetrafuel was introduced in the Brazilian market, equipped with a 1.4-litre FIRE engine that runs on E100, E25 (Standard Brazilian Gasoline), Ethanol, and CNG.

Any existing petrol vehicle can be converted to a dual-fuel petrol/CNG vehicle. Authorized shops can do the retrofitting, which involves installing a CNG cylinder, plumbing, a CNG injection system, and electronics. The cost of installing a CNG conversion kit can often reach $8,000 on passenger cars and light trucks, and is usually reserved for vehicles that travel many miles each year. CNG costs about 50% less than petrol, and emits up to 90% fewer emissions than petrol.

=== Locomotives ===
CNG locomotives are operated by several railroads. The Napa Valley Wine Train in the US successfully retrofitted a diesel locomotive to run on compressed natural gas before 2002. This converted locomotive was upgraded to utilize a computer-controlled fuel injection system in May 2008, and is now the Napa Valley Wine Train&#x27;s primary locomotive. Ferrocarril Central Andino in Peru, has run a CNG locomotive on a freight line since 2005. CNG locomotives are usually diesel–electric locomotives that have been converted to use compressed natural gas generators instead of diesel generators to generate the electricity that drives the traction motors. Some CNG locomotives are able to selectively fire their cylinders only when there is a demand for power, which, theoretically, gives them a higher fuel-efficiency than conventional diesel engines. CNG is also cheaper than petrol or diesel fuel.

===Natural gas transport===

CNG is used to transport natural gas by sea for intermediate distances, using CNG carrier ships, especially when the infrastructure for pipelines or LNG is not in place. At short distances, undersea pipelines are often more cost-effective, and for longer distances, LNG is often more cost-effective.

== Advantages ==

* Natural gas vehicles have lower maintenance costs than other hydrocarbon-fuel-powered vehicles.
* CNG fuel systems are sealed, preventing fuel losses from spills or evaporation.
* Increased life of lubricating oils, as CNG does not contaminate and dilute the crankcase oil.
* Being a gaseous fuel, CNG mixes easily and evenly in air.
* CNG is less likely to ignite on hot surfaces, since it has a high auto-ignition temperature (540 °C), and a narrow range (5–15 percent) of flammability.
* CNG-powered vehicles are considered to be safer than petrol-powered vehicles.
* &quot;Less pollution and more efficiency:&quot;
** CNG emits significantly less pollution directly than petrol or oil when combusted (e.g., unburned hydrocarbons (UHC), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOX), sulfur oxides (SOx) and PM (particulate matter)). For example, an engine running on petrol for 100 km produces 22 kilograms of , while covering the same distance on CNG emits only 16.3 kilograms of .
** The lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions for CNG compressed from California&#x27;s pipeline natural gas is given a value of 67.70 grams of -equivalent per megajoule (gCO2e/MJ) by CARB (the California Air Resources Board), approximately 28 percent lower than the average petrol fuel in that market (95.86 gCO2e/MJ).
** CNG produced from landfill biogas was found by CARB to have the lowest greenhouse gas emissions of any fuel analyzed, with a value of 11.26 gCO2e/MJ (more than 88 percent lower than conventional petrol) in the low-carbon fuel standard that went into effect on January 12, 2010.
** Due to lower carbon dioxide emissions, switching to CNG can help mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. However, natural gas leaks (both in the direct use and in the production and delivery of the fuel) represent an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. The ability of CNG to reduce greenhouse gas emissions over the entire fuel lifecycle will depend on the source of the natural gas and the fuel it is replacing.

== Drawbacks ==
Compressed natural gas vehicles require a greater amount of space for fuel storage than conventional petrol-powered vehicles. Since it is a compressed gas, rather than a liquid like petrol, CNG takes up more space for each GGE (petrol gallon equivalent). However, the cylinders used to store the CNG take up space in the trunk of a car or bed of a pickup truck that has been modified to additionally run on CNG. This problem is solved in factory-built CNG vehicles that install the cylinders under the body of the vehicle, leaving the trunk free, &quot;e.g.&quot;, Fiat Multipla, New Fiat Panda, Volkswagen Touran Ecofuel, Volkswagen Caddy Ecofuel, Chevy Taxi, which sold in countries such as Peru. Another option is installation on roof (typical on buses), but this could require structural modifications. In 2014, a test (by the Danish Technological Institute) of Euro6 heavy vehicles on CNG and diesel showed that CNG had higher fuel consumption, the same noise and production of CO2 and particulates, but NOX emission was lower.

Leakage of unburned methane as natural gas is a significant issue because methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a powerful, short-lived greenhouse gas. It is more than 100 times more potent at trapping energy than carbon dioxide (), the principal contributor to man-made climate change.

== Comparison with other natural gas fuels ==
Compressed natural gas is often confused with LNG (liquefied natural gas). Both are stored forms of natural gas. The main difference is that CNG is stored at ambient temperature and high pressure, while LNG is stored at low temperature and nearly ambient pressure. In their respective storage conditions, LNG is a liquid and CNG is a supercritical fluid. CNG has a lower cost of production and storage compared to LNG as it does not require an expensive cooling process and cryogenic tanks. However, CNG requires a much larger volume to store the energy equivalent of petrol and the use of very high pressures (3000 to 4000 psi, or 205 to 275 bar). As a consequence of this, LNG is often used for transporting natural gas over large distances, in ships, trains or pipelines, where the gas is converted into CNG before distribution to the end user.

Natural gas is being experimentally stored at lower pressure in a form known as an ANG (adsorbed natural gas) cylinder, where it is adsorbed at 35 bar (500 psi, the pressure of gas in natural gas pipelines) in various sponge-like materials, such as carbon and MOFs (metal-organic frameworks). The fuel is stored at similar or greater energy density than CNG. This means that vehicles can be refueled from the natural gas network without extra gas compression, the fuel cylinders can be slimmed down and made of lighter, weaker materials.

It is possible to mix the ANG and CNG technology to reach an increased capacity of natural gas storage. In this process known as high pressure ANG, a high pressure CNG tank is filled by absorbers such as activated carbon (which is an adsorbent with high surface area) and stores natural gas by both CNG and ANG mechanisms.

Compressed natural gas is sometimes mixed with hydrogen (HCNG), which increases the H/C ratio (hydrogen/carbon ratio) of the fuel and gives it a flame speed up to eight times higher than CNG.

== Codes and standards ==
The lack of harmonized codes and standards across international jurisdictions is an additional barrier to NGV market penetration. The International Organization for Standardization has an active technical committee working on a standard for natural gas fuelling stations for vehicles.

Despite the lack of harmonized international codes, natural gas vehicles have an excellent global safety record. Existing international standards include ISO 14469-2:2007 which applies to CNG vehicle nozzles and receptacle and ISO 15500-9:2012 specifies tests and requirements for the pressure regulator.

The National Fire Protection Association&#x27;s NFPA 52 code covers natural gas vehicle safety standards in the United States.

==Worldwide adoption==

Iran, Pakistan, Argentina, Brazil and China have the highest number of CNG run vehicles in the world.

Natural gas vehicles are increasingly used in Iran, Pakistan, the Asia-Pacific region, the Indian capital of Delhi, and other large cities such as Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Pune, and Kolkata, as well as cities such as Lucknow, Kanpur, Varanasi, and others.

Its use is also increasing in South America, Europe, and North America, because of rising petrol prices.

=== Africa ===
Egypt is amongst the top 10 countries in CNG adoption, with 128,754 CNG vehicles and 124 CNG fueling stations. Egypt was also the first nation in Africa and the Middle East to open a public CNG fueling station in January 1996.

The vast majority (780,000) have been produced as dual fuel-vehicles by the auto manufacturer in the last two years, and the remainder have been converted utilizing after market conversion kits in workshops. There are 750 active refueling stations country wide with an additional 660 refueling stations under construction and expected to come on stream. Currently the major problem facing the industry as a whole is the building of refueling stations that is lagging behind dual fuel vehicle production, forcing many to use petrol instead.

Nigeria CNG started with a pilot project in Benin City Edo State in 2010 by NIPCO Gas Limited. NIPCO Gas Limited is a 100% subsidiary of NIPCO PLC. As of June 2020, seven CNG stations have been built in Benin City Edo State, with about 7,500 cars running on CNG in Benin City Edo state. In Benin City Edo state, major companies such as Coca-Cola, 7up, Yongxing Steel are using CNG to power their fork-lifts/trucks while Edo City Transport Ltd (ECTS) is also running some of its buses on CNG. Kwale, Nigeria CNG stations were inaugurated by Mr. Abhishek Sharma, the head of marketing (Natural Gas) from NIPCO Gas Limited in 2019.
=== Asia ===
====China====

In China, companies such as Sino-Energy are active in expanding the footprint of CNG filling stations in medium-size cities across the interior of the country, where at least two natural gas pipelines are operational.

====Malaysia====
In Malaysia, the use of CNG was originally introduced for taxicabs and airport limousines during the late 1990s, when new taxis were launched with CNG engines while taxicab operators were encouraged to send in existing taxis for full engine conversions. The practice of using CNG remained largely confined to taxicabs predominately in the Klang Valley and Penang due to a lack of interest. No incentives were offered for those besides taxicab owners to use CNG engines, while government subsidies on petrol and diesel made conventional road vehicles cheaper to use in the eyes of the consumers. Petronas, Malaysia&#x27;s state-owned oil company, also monopolises the provision of CNG to road users. As of July 2008, Petronas only operates about 150 CNG refueling stations, most of which are concentrated in the Klang Valley. At the same time, another 50 were expected by the end of 2008.

As fuel subsidies were gradually removed in Malaysia starting June 5, 2008, the subsequent 41 percent price hike on petrol and diesel fuel led to a 500 percent increase in the number of new CNG cylinders installed. National car maker Proton considered fitting its Waja, Saga and Persona models with CNG kits from Prins Autogassystemen by the end of 2008, while a local distributor of locally assembled Hyundai cars offers new models with CNG kits. Conversion centres, which also benefited from the rush for lower running costs, also perform partial conversions to existing road vehicles, allowing them to run on both petrol or diesel and CNG with a cost varying between RM3,500 to RM5,000 for passenger cars.

====Myanmar====
The Ministry of Transport of Myanmar passed a law in 2005 which required that all public transport vehicles – buses, trucks and taxis, be converted to run on CNG. The Government permitted several private companies to handle the conversion of existing diesel and petrol cars, and also to begin importing CNG variants of buses and taxis. Accidents and rumours of accidents, partly fueled by Myanmar&#x27;s position in local hydrocarbon politics, has discouraged citizens from using CNG vehicles, although now almost every taxi and public bus in Yangon, Myanmar&#x27;s largest city, run on CNG. CNG stations have been set up around Yangon and other cities, but electricity shortages mean that vehicles may have to queue up for hours to fill their gas containers. The Burmese opposition movements are against the conversion to CNG, as they accuse the companies of being proxies of the junta, and also their desire that the petrodollars earned by the regime should go towards the defense sector rather than towards improving the infrastructure or welfare of the people.

==== India ====
In India, there are over 4500 CNG Stations all over the country now as compared to 2014 when the country only had about 900 CNG Stations. The government is aiming to increase the use of CNG powered vehicles by setting up more CNG stations in the country, the aim is to increase the current number to 8000 CNG Stations in the next two years.

As of December 2022, the state of Gujarat has the highest number of CNG Pumps in the country followed by Uttar Pradesh being the second highest and with Maharashtra falling little behind the above regions.

====Pakistan====
In Pakistan, the Karachi government under the order of the Supreme Court in 2004 made it mandatory for all city buses and auto rickshaws to run on CNG with the intention of reducing air pollution.

In 2012, the federal government announced plans to gradually phase out CNG over a period of approximately three years given natural gas shortages which have been negatively affecting the manufacturing sector. Aside from limiting electricity generation capacity, gas shortages in Pakistan have also raised the costs of business for key industries including the fertilizer, cement and textile sectors.

====Singapore====

In Singapore, CNG was once used by public transport vehicles like buses and taxis, as well as goods vehicles until 2018. During its heyday in 2008 onwards, more owners of private cars had sought interest in converting their petrol-driven vehicles to also run on CNG – due to rising petrol prices. The initial cost of converting a regular vehicle to dual fuel at the German conversion workshop of C. Melchers, for example, is around S$3,800; with the promise of real cost-savings that dual-fuel vehicles bring over the long term.

Singapore currently has five operating filling stations for natural gas. Sembcorp Gas Pte Ltd. runs the station on Jurong Island and, jointly with Singapore Petroleum Company, the filling station at Jalan Buroh. Both these stations are in the western part of the country. Another station on the mainland is in Mandai Link to the north and is operated by SMART Energy. SMART also own a second station on Serangoon North Ave 5 which was set up end of March 2009; The fifth and largest station in the world, located in Toh Tuck, was opened by the UNION Group in September 2009. This station is recognized by the Guniness World Records as being the largest in the world with 46 refuelling hoses. The Union Group, which operates 1000 CNG Toyota Wish taxis then planned to introduce another three daughter stations and increase the CNG taxi fleet to 8000 units.

As a key incentive for using this eco-friendly fuel Singapore has a green vehicle rebate for users of CNG technology. First introduced in January 2001, the GVR grants a 40 percent discount on the OMV (open market value) cost of newly registered green passenger vehicles. This initiative will end at the end of 2012 as the government believes the &#x27;critical mass&#x27; of CNG vehicles would then have been built up.

Due to reliability issues and lower ranges that CNG provided (as cited by users’ feedback), refueling stations mostly concentrated in the western end of Singapore, the rising demand of greener solutions like hybrid technologies, led to its demise where both public buses and the last CNG taxis were on its way to being scrapped in 2018. 
=== Europe ===

In Italy, there are more than 1173 CNG stations. The use of methane for vehicles, started in the 1930s and has continued off and on until today. Since 2008 there have been a large market expansion for natural gas vehicles (CNG and LPG) caused by the rise of petrol prices and by the need to reduce air pollution emissions. Before 1995 the only way to have a CNG-powered car was by having it retrofitted with an after-market kit. A large producer was Landi Renzo, Tartarini Auto, Prins Autogassystemen, OMVL, BiGAs... and AeB for electronic parts used by the most part of kit producer. Landi Renzo and Tartarini selling vehicles in Asia and South America. After 1995 bi-fuel cars (petrol/CNG) became available from several major manufacturers. Currently Fiat, Opel, Volkswagen, Citroën, Renault, Volvo and Mercedes sell various car models and small trucks that are petrol/CNG powered. Usually CNG parts used by major car manufacturers are actually produced by automotive aftermarket kit manufacturers, e.g. Fiat use Tartarini Auto components, Volkswagen use Teleflex GFI and Landi Renzo components.

In Belgium, CNG is a very new fuel. At the beginning of 2014 there were only 17 refuelling stations, all of them in Flanders, but the number is now increasing rapidly. At the beginning of 2015 there were 29 refueling stations in Belgium, all of them in Flanders. As of January 2017, there are 76 active refueling stations in Belgium, most of them being in Flanders since only 7 of them are in Wallonia or Brussels. As a fuel and compared to petrol, CNG has an advantageous fiscal treatment with lower excises duties (although VAT is always paid). Since CNG, as a car fuel, is not totally exempted of excise duties, CNG cars do not pay a prime road tax to partially compensate the State for the loss of revenue. Instead LPG cars pay a prime road tax in Belgium, because LPG is totally exempted from excise duties. Since CNG is not totally exempted of excise duties, in Belgium it is allowed to connect a car to the home network of natural gas and to refuel the car from home. The purchase of CNG cars is not subsidised by the government, but by the Belgian producers and distributors of natural gas. Fiat and Volkswagen sell factory-equipped CNG-cars in Belgium. At the end of 2018 there were 11,188 vehicles running with CNG in Belgium.

In Germany, CNG-generated vehicles are expected to increase to two million units of motor-transport by 2020. The cost for CNG fuel is between 1/3 and 1/2 compared to other fossil fuels in Europe. In 2016 there are around 900 CNG stations in Germany and major German car manufacturers like Volkswagen, Mercedes, Opel, Audi offer CNG engines on most of their models. Augsburg is one of the few cities that only run CNG operated public buses since 2011.

In Turkey, Ankara municipality is increasingly using CNG buses, where numbers have reached 1090 by 2011. Istanbul has started in 2014 with an order of 110 buses. Konya also added 60 buses to its fleet the same year.

In Portugal, there are 9 CNG refueling stations as of September 25, 2017.

In Hungary, there are four public CNG refueling stations in the cities Budapest, Szeged, Pécs and Győr. The public transportation company of Szeged, Szolnok and some districts in Budapest runs buses mainly on CNG.

In Bulgaria, there are 96 CNG refueling stations as of July 2011. One can be found in most of Bulgaria&#x27;s big towns. In the capital Sofia there are 22 CNG stations making it possibly the city with the most publicly available CNG stations in Europe. There are also quite a few in Plovdiv, Ruse, Stara Zagora and Veliko Tarnovo as well as in the towns on the Black Sea – Varna, Burgas, Nesebar and Kavarna. CNG vehicles are becoming more and more popular in the country. The fuel is mostly used by taxi drivers because of its much lower price compared to petrol. Currently (as of July, 2015) the city of Sofia is rapidly renewing its public transport fleet with MAN Lion&#x27;s City buses running on CNG. Also, many companies switch to CNG cargo vans and even heavy trucks for their daily operations within city limits.

In North Macedonia, there is one CNG station located in the capital Skopje, but it is not for public use. Only twenty buses of the local Public Transport Company have been fitted to use a mixture of diesel and CNG. The first commercial CNG station in Skopje is in the advanced stage of development and was expected to start operation in July 2011.

In Serbia, there are about 20 public CNG refuelling stations as of August 2019. Four in the capital Belgrade, and the rest in the towns of Subotica (1), Novi Sad (1), Zrenjanin (1), Pancevo (2), Kruševac (1), Kragujevac (1), Cacak (2), and so on. Detailed list is currently available on CNGEurope Web site. 

In Slovenia, there are four public CNG refuelling stations as of December 2018. Two in the capital Ljubljana, and one each in Maribor and Jesenice. Additionally, at least 14 new refuelling stations are planned in all city municipalities by the end of 2020. Ljubljana Passenger Transport operates 66 CNG fuelled city buses, as of May 2016. Its Maribor counterpart, Marprom has 19 CNG city buses in their fleet, as of October 2018.

In Croatia, there are two public CNG refuelling stations situated close to the center of Zagreb and in Rijeka. At least 60 CNG buses are in use as a form of a public transport (Zagreb public transport services).

In Estonia, there are 11 public CNG refuelling stations – four in the country&#x27;s capital Tallinn, and one each in Tartu, Pärnu, Viljandi, Rakvere, Jõhvi, and Narva. From 2011 on, Tartu has five Scania-manufactured CNG buses operating its inner-city routes.
In Sweden, there are currently 90 CNG filling stations available to the public (as compared to about 10 LPG filling stations), primarily located in the southern and western parts of the country as well the Mälardalen region Another 70–80 CNG filling stations are under construction or in a late stage of planning (completions 2009–2010). Several of the planned filling stations are located in the northern parts of the country, which will greatly improve the infrastructure for CNG car users. There are approx. 14,500 CNG vehicles in Sweden (2007), of which approx. 13,500 are passenger cars and the remainder includes buses and trucks. In Stockholm, the public transportation company SL currently operates 50 CNG buses but have a capacity to operate 500. The Swedish government recently prolonged its subsidies for the development of CNG filling stations, from 2009 to 2012–31 to 2010-12-31.

In Spain, CNG is a very new fuel and the refueling network is being developed. In Madrid, the EMT, uses 1915 buses running with CNG. At the beginning of 2015 there were 35 CNG refueling stations in Spain. Several car brands sell brand-new cars running with CNG, including Fiat, Volkswagen, Seat and Skoda among others.

As of 2013, there are 47 public CNG filling stations in the Czech Republic, mainly in the big cities. Local bus manufacturers SOR Libchavy and Tedom produce CNG versions of their vehicles, with roof-mounted cylinders.

===Middle East===
====Iran====
Iran has one of the largest fleets of CNG vehicles and CNG distribution networks in the world. There are 2335 CNG fueling stations, with a total of 13,534 CNG nozzles. The number of CNG burning vehicles in Iran exceeds 3.5 million. CNG consumption by Iran&#x27;s transportation sector is around 20 million cubic meters per day.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====
Natural gas has been used as a motor fuel in Canada for over 20 years. With assistance from federal and provincial research programs, demonstration projects and NGV market deployment programs during the 1980s and 1990s, the population of light-duty NGVs grew to over 35,000 by the early 1990s. This assistance resulted in a significant adoption of natural gas transit buses as well.

The NGV market started to decline after 1995, eventually reaching today&#x27;s vehicle population of about 12,000.

This figure includes 150 urban transit buses, 45 school buses, 9,450 light-duty cars and trucks, and 2,400 forklifts and ice-resurfacers. The total fuel use in all NGV markets in Canada was 1.9 PJs (petajoules) in 2007 (or 54.6 million liters of petrol liters equivalent), down from 2.6 PJs in 1997. Public CNG refueling stations have declined in quantity from
134 in 1997 to 72 today. There are 22 in British Columbia, 12 in Alberta, 10 in Saskatchewan, 27 in
Ontario and two in Québec. There are only 12 private fleet stations.

Canadian industry has developed CNG-fueled truck and bus engines, CNG-fueled transit buses, and light trucks and taxis.

Fuelmaker Corporation of Toronto, the Honda-owned manufacturer of CNG auto refueling units, was forced into bankruptcy by parent Honda USA for an unspecified reason in 2009. The various assets of Fuelmaker were subsequently acquired by Fuel Systems Corporation of Santa Ana, California.

==== United States ====
Similar to Canada, the United States has implemented various NGV initiatives and programs since 1980, but has had limited success in sustaining the market. There were 105,000 NGVs in operation in 2000; this figure peaked at 121,000 in 2004, and decreased to 110,000 in 2009.

In the United States, federal tax credits are available for buying a new CNG vehicle. Use of CNG varies from state to state; only 34 states have at least one CNG fueling site.

In Texas, Railroad Commissioner David Porter launched his Texas Natural Gas Initiative in October 2013 to encourage the adoption of natural gas fuel in the transportation and exploration and production sectors. As of 2015 Texas is rapidly becoming a leader in natural gas infrastructure in the US with 137 natural gas fueling stations (private and public). Nine months into FY2015 Commissioner Porter reports Texas CNG, LNG Sales Show 78 Percent Increase Over FY 2014 year to date. Per Commissioner Porter in June 2015: &quot;Natural gas vehicles are becoming mainstream faster than expected. These collections are nearly double the amount collected last year at this time. At 15 cents per gallon equivalent, $3,033,600 of motor fuel tax equates to the sale of 20,224,000 gallon equivalents of natural gas.&quot; The $3 million in Texas natural gas tax receipts is for both CNG and LNG for FY2015 through the May 2015. The Texas fiscal year starts Sept 1 so 9 months tax collections are represented.

In Athens, Ala., the city and its Gas Department installed a public CNG station on the Interstate 65 Corridor, making it the only public CNG station between Birmingham and Nashville as of February 2014. The city&#x27;s larger fleet vehicles such as garbage trucks also use this public station for fueling. The city also has two slow-fill non-public CNG stations for its fleet. Athens has added CNG/petrol Tahoes for police and fire, a CNG Honda Civic, CNG Heil garbage trucks, and CNG/petrol Dodge pickup trucks to its fleet.

In California, CNG is used extensively in local city and county fleets, as well as public transportation (city/school buses). There are 90 public fueling stations in southern California alone, and travel from San Diego so the Bay Area to Las Vegas and Utah is routine with the advent of online station maps such as www.cngprices.com. Compressed natural gas is typically available for 30-60 percent less than the cost of petrol in much of California.

The 28 buses running the Gwinnett County Transit local routes run on 100 percent CNG. Additionally, about half of the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority express fleet, which runs and refuels out of the Gwinnett County Transit facility, uses CNG.

The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority was running 360 CNG buses as early as in 2007, and is the largest user in the state.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) of New York City currently has over 900 buses powered by compressed natural gas, with CNG bus depots located in Brooklyn, The Bronx, and Queens.

The Nassau Inter-County Express (or NICE Bus, formerly New York MTA Long Island Bus) runs a 100% Orion CNG-fueled bus fleet for fixed-route service, consisting of 360 buses for service in Nassau County, parts of Queens, New York, and the western sections of Suffolk County.

The City of Harrisburg, Arkansas has switched some of the city&#x27;s vehicles to compressed natural gas in an effort to save money on fuel costs. Trucks used by the city&#x27;s street and water, sewer, and gas departments have been converted from petrol to CNG.

Personal use of CNG is currently a small niche market, though with current tax incentives and a growing number of public fueling stations available, it is experiencing unprecedented growth. The state of Utah offers a subsidised statewide network of CNG filling stations at a rate of $1.57/gge, while petrol is above $4.00/gal.

Elsewhere in the nation, retail prices average around $2.50/gge, with home refueling units compressing gas from residential gas lines for under $1/gge. Other than aftermarket conversions, and government used vehicle auctions, the only currently produced CNG vehicle in the United States is the Honda Civic GX sedan, which is made in limited numbers and available only in states with retail fueling outlets.

An initiative, known as Pickens Plan, calls for the expansion of the use of CNG as a standard fuel for heavy vehicles has been recently started by oilman and entrepreneur T. Boone Pickens. California voters defeated Proposition 10 in the 2008 General Election by a significant (59.8 percent to 40.2 percent) margin. Proposition 10 was a $5 billion bond measure that, among other things, would have given rebates to state residents that purchase CNG vehicles.

On February 21, 2013, T. Boone Pickens and New York Mayor, Michael Bloomberg unveiled a CNG powered mobile pizzeria. The company, Neapolitan Express uses alternative energy to run the truck as well as 100 percent recycled and compostable materials for their carryout boxes.

Congress has encouraged conversion of cars to CNG with a tax credits of up to 50 percent of the auto conversion cost and the CNG home filling station cost. However, while CNG is much cleaner fuel, the conversion requires a type certificate from the EPA. Meeting the requirements of a type certificate can cost up to $50,000. Other non-EPA approved kits are available. A complete and safe aftermarket conversion using a non-EPA approved kit can be achieved for as little as $400 without the cylinder.

===== Deployments =====
AT&amp;T ordered 1,200 CNG-powered cargo vans from General Motors in 2012. It is the largest-ever order of CNG vehicles from General Motors to date. AT&amp;T has announced its intention to invest up to $565 million to deploy approximately 15,000 alternative fuel vehicles over a 10-year period through 2018, will use the vans to provide and maintain communications, high-speed Internet and television services for AT&amp;T customers.

=== South America ===

CNG vehicles are commonly used in South America, where these vehicles are mainly used as taxicabs in main cities of Argentina and Brazil. Normally, standard petrol vehicles are retrofitted in specialized shops, which involve installing the gas cylinder in the trunk and the CNG injection system and electronics. Argentina and Brazil are the two countries with the largest fleets of CNG vehicles, with a combined total fleet of more than 3.4 million vehicles by 2009. Conversion has been facilitated by a substantial price differential with liquid fuels, locally produced conversion equipment and a growing CNG-delivery infrastructure.

As of 2009 Argentina had 1,807,186 NGV&#x27;s with 1,851 refueling stations across the nation, or 15 percent of all vehicles; and Brazil had 1,632,101 vehicles and 1,704 refueling stations, with a higher concentration in the cities of Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo.

Colombia had an NGV fleet of 300,000 vehicles, and 460 refueling stations, as of 2009. Bolivia has increased its fleet from 10,000 in 2003 to 121,908 units in 2009, with 128 refueling stations. Peru had 81,024 NGVs and 94 fueling stations as 2009, but that number is expected to skyrocket as Peru sits on South America&#x27;s largest gas reserves. In Peru several factory-built NGVs have the cylinders installed under the body of the vehicle, leaving the trunk free. Among the models built with this feature are the Fiat Multipla, the new Fiat Panda, the Volkswagen Touran Ecofuel, the Volkswagen Caddy Ecofuel and the Chevy Taxi. Other countries with significant NGV fleets are Venezuela (15,000) and Chile (8,064) as of 2009.

=== Oceania ===
During the 1970s and 1980s, CNG was commonly used in New Zealand in the wake of the oil crises, but fell into decline after petrol prices receded. At the peak of natural gas use, 10 percent of New Zealand&#x27;s cars were converted, around 110,000 vehicles.

For a period of time, Brisbane Transport in Queensland, Australia adopted a policy of purchasing only CNG buses. Brisbane Transport has 215 Scania L94UB and 324 MAN 18.310 models as well as 30 MAN NG 313 articulated CNG buses. The State Transit Authority purchased 100 Scania L113CRB, 283 Mercedes-Benz O405NH and 254 Euro 5-compliant Mercedes-Benz OC500LE buses.

In the 1990s, Benders Busways of Geelong, Victoria trialled CNG buses for the Energy Research and Development Corporation.
Martin Ferguson, Ollie Clark and Noel Childs featured on &quot;The 7:30 Report&quot; raised the issue of CNG as an overlooked transport fuel option in Australia, highlighting the large volumes of LNG currently being exported from the North West Shelf in light of the cost of importing crude oil to Australia.

<text>Dream Pod 9 (DP9), formerly Ianus Games, is a Montreal-based Canadian game publisher. Its most notable products are &quot;Heavy Gear&quot;, &quot;Jovian Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Tribe 8&quot;, and &quot;Gear Krieg&quot;, as well as the Silhouette role-playing game system.

==History==
===Ianus===
In 1987, Montreal-based Ianus Publications was licensed by Harmony Gold to publish &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot;, a quarterly magazine dedicated to the Robotech TV series. In 1989, Ianus relinquished the Robotech license so that they could turn &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot;, into a bi-monthly magazine with an industry-wide focus; it became the first large mainstream anime and manga magazine in North America. In 1991, Ianus began publishing the mecha-inspired &quot;Mecha Press&quot;.

The following year, Ianus and R. Talsorian Games (RTG) struck a deal to develop a series of products set in an alternate reality based on RTG&#x27;s successful game &quot;Cyberpunk 2020&quot;. The Ianus design team working on this project became known in-house as Dream Pod 9, and within three years had produced 15 various rulebooks and adventure modules.

In 1993 the Dream Pod 9 design team then created &quot;Jovian Chronicles&quot;, a new setting for RTG&#x27;s &quot;Mekton II&quot; roleplaying game. In 1993, the same design team was hired by Palladium Books to work on supplementary deck plans of the &quot;Macross II&quot; roleplaying game. The design team, under license from RTG, also created the comedy sf game &quot;Star Riders&quot; using the rules system from RTG&#x27;s &quot;Teenagers from Outer Space&quot; roleplaying game. This also resulted in a three-part comic book anthology in &quot;Dark Horse Presents&quot;.

In 1994, the Dream Pod 9 team developed a card game called &quot;Heavy Gear Fighter&quot;, their first in-house project, and started to develop a game called &quot;Project A-ko: The Roleplaying Game&quot; based on the anime movie &quot;Project A-ko&quot;, as well as a roleplaying game system.

===Dream Pod 9===
In 1995, the Dream Pod 9 team released the first edition of &quot;Heavy Gear&quot;, their first roleplaying and combat game that used the design team&#x27;s roleplaying game system called &quot;Silhouette&quot;, and started using a &quot;Dream Pod 9&quot; logo to identify their work. In December 1995, after experiencing strong growth in both the magazine business and the games division, Ianus decided to split into two ventures: Protoculture, which continued to publish &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot;; and a completely independent game publisher, Dream Pod 9, which would design and market miniatures and gaming books. Mecha (giant robots) would be the focus of Dream Pod 9.

====Silhouette game system====
The Silhouette game system was developed by Dream Pod 9 specifically to work with both its mecha-based miniatures combat games and roleplaying adventures. As Moby Games summarized it: &quot;This new addition in the world of giant robots (mecha) gaming not only introduced realistic warfare game mechanics to the hobby, but gave North Americans what they have been waiting for since they were introduced to the world of mecha warfare in the early eighties: a story that is both vivid and entertaining, and designs which are made by North Americans for North Americans.&quot;

Rick Swan wrote, in &quot;Dragon&quot; #244 (1998), &quot;I do, however, like the system, one of the smartest set of universal rules this side of the GURPS* game. Called Silhouette, the system uses 6-sided dice to generate quick and sensible results. All skills are rated from a low of 0 (little or no aptitude) to 5 (superhuman aptitude). Actions are assigned thresholds of difficulty, ranging from 1 (effortless) to 12 (near-impossible). When a PC attempts an action, the gamemaster assigns a threshold and determines the relevant skill. The player rolls a number of dice equal to the skill level. The results are not added together. Instead, the highest number rolled on an individual die is considered the outcome (if a player rolls two dice and gets a 2 and a 5, the outcome is 5). Every additional 6 adds 1 to the total (if he gets two 6s, the outcome is 7). If all of the dice show 1s, the PC suffers a critical mishap. Actions with higher thresholds, then, become increasingly difficult to achieve. PCs with low skill levels are more likely to fumble then their high-level counterparts. It’s a clever, elegant system, a snap to learn and adjudicate. Character creation is equally smooth, involving the purchase of attributes (Agility, Build, Perception) and skills (Acrobatics, Law, Stealth) from a pool of character points. Simple formulas are used to compute secondary traits (Strength, Stamina, Health). Creating a PC from scratch takes half an hour, tops&quot;.

RPGGeek wrote that &quot;the system is based upon rolling multiple d6s and the results exaggerate the effect either way. A big success roll results in highly positive effects, a bad roll means you suffer more damage for example. There were three editions of the system, with Dream Pod 9 bringing out a &quot;Silhouette&quot; Core rules book to enable all their games to be run from one system&quot;. In 2003, Dream Pod 9 released a conversion guide from the &quot;Silhouette&quot; game system to the d20 Open Gaming License.

===&quot;Heavy Gear&quot;=== 
In 1996, Dream Pod 9 partnered with Activision to create a &quot;Heavy Gear&quot; computer game, and the following year, &quot;Heavy Gear: The New Breed&quot; became Activision&#x27;s first property to sell over a million copies. At the height of Dream Pod 9&#x27;s popularity in the late 1990s, despite having a staff of only nine writers, &quot;Heavy Gear&quot; was reportedly the fourth-most popular roleplaying game in the U.S.

In 1997, Dream Pod 9 released the second edition rules for &quot;Heavy Gear&quot;, again using the Silhouette game system.

In 1998, Dream Pod 9 released their next major property, Jovian Chronicles, a rewrite of the setting they had created for the &quot;Mekton II&quot; RPG in 1993, now adapted to their own Silhouette game system. The company then published the post-apocalyptic fantasy role-playing game &quot;Tribe 8&quot; (1998), and then its fourth role-playing game &quot;Gear Krieg&quot; (2001), set in an alternate-history World War II.

In 1999, Dream Pod 9 licensed &quot;Heavy Gear&quot; to Sony Pictures, which resulted in a 40-episode 3D-animated series that had world-wide syndication. In 2002, &quot;Heavy Gear: The Animated Series&quot; was nominated for a Golden Reel Award for Best Sound Editing in Television Animation.

===Decline===
In 1999, Activision&#x27;s &quot;Heavy Gear II: Black Talon&quot; was commercially unsuccessful, selling less than 30,000 copies by the end of the year; Activision chose not to develop a third title.

By 2001, sales of Dream Pod 9&#x27;s Silhouette-based games also declined as the d20 system became popular throughout the role-playing game industry. Dream Pod 9 responded by releasing a third edition of the &quot;Heavy Gear&quot; roleplaying game in 1993 that had been converted to the d20 system under the Open Game License (OGL). Since this edition could not include game system rules under the terms of the d20 System Trademark License, players had to purchase the &quot;Players Handbook&quot; for the 3rd edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in order to play the game. For players who still wanted to use the Silhouette rules system, Dream Pod 9 also published the &quot;Silhouette CORE Rulebook&quot; (&quot;SilCORE&quot;), which contained the Silhouette rules system; conversely, it also explained how to convert previous editions of their games that used the Silhouette system to d20 rules. Regardless of which system players wanted to use, they still had to purchase two books in order to play the third edition of &quot;Heavy Gear&quot;. Sales of both products were low, and in 2004 the company ended its role-playing game production to concentrate on their miniatures combat games.

The company then created Dream Pod Entertainment to bring the company into movies and television, including work on the 2004 film &quot;Eternal&quot; with Caroline Néron and the 2007 film &quot;300&quot;, and used this movie industry money to help fund production of &quot;Heavy Gear Blitz!&quot;, a mecha miniatures game, which was nominated for a 2007 Origins Award in the category of &quot;Miniatures Game or Expansion of the Year&quot;. Dream Pod 9 was nominated for two ENnie Awards, &quot;Best Miniature Product&quot; and &quot;Best Electronic Book&quot;, in 2008.

In 2008, Dream Pod 9 licensed the rights to &quot;Heavy Gear&quot; to Steve Jackson Games, which wanted to create a fourth edition &quot;Heavy Gear&quot; roleplaying game based on the GURPS rule system; ultimately Steve Jackson Games decided to shelve the project, and in 2010 relinquished their rights to the game.

After that decision, when an interviewer asked Dream Pod 9 company president Robert Dubois which of the three versions of &quot;Heavy Gear&quot; players should use, he replied, &quot;The second edition of the &quot;Heavy Gear&quot; Roleplaying Game is the best version of the RPG and has the most support in material.&quot; In the same interview, Dubois also revealed that the design team was working on a fourth edition that would be a revision of the second edition, not as a roleplaying game but as a combat game compatible with the miniatures game &quot;Heavy Gear Blitz!&quot;; to date, it has not been published.

In 2012, Dream Pod 9 announced a five-year partnership with Stompy Bot Productions (now BlocPlay Entertainment) to commercialize &quot;Heavy Gear&quot;; in 2017, the two companies renewed the partnership for a further five years, with plans to include sponsorship of eSports tournamaents.

In 2013, Dream Pod 9 was nominated for an Origins Award in the category of &quot;Best Miniatures Rules&quot; for &quot;Heavy Gear Blitz! Perfect Storm: The NuCoal Field Guide&quot;.

In 2015, &quot;Heavy Gear Blitz! Tabletop Wargaming - Living Rulebook&quot; was released for free on DrivethruRPG as a PDF. In the following year, &quot;Heavy Gear Blitz! Tabletop Wargaming - Quick Start Rulebook&quot; was also released on DrivethruRPG. Both of these rulebooks were last updated on February 23, 2018.

In 2016, Beta Playtest Rules for a new edition of &quot;Jovian Chronicles&quot;, called &quot;Jovian Wars&quot;, were released for free on DrivethruRPG as a PDF. These rules were last updated on February 14, 2018.

==== Kickstarter ====
Between 2014 and 2018, Dream Pod 9 launched six Kickstarter campaigns - five campaigns were successfully funded. All of the campaigns focused on raising funds to create new miniatures for either &quot;Heavy Gear&quot; or &quot;Jovian Wars&quot;. 
==Properties==
The company is best known for a set of universes on which role-playing games, wargames, scale models and miniatures have been based:
* Heavy Gear is a military science-fiction universe where human worlds wage war against one another with mecha.
* Jovian Chronicles follows the exploration of the Solar System in the 23rd century and the conflicts that arise between the Earth and the space colonies.
* Tribe 8 is a tribal, post-apocalyptic fantasy game of horror and epic adventures.
* Gear Krieg takes place in an alternate reality World War II firmly set in the pulp genre.

A few other less well-known settings for use in various publications include CORE Command, a space opera universe set millennia in the future.

==Reviews==
In the February 1998 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; (Issue 244), Rick Swan reviewed two of Dream Pod 9&#x27;s game settings, &quot;Heavy Gear&quot; and &quot;Jovian Chronicles&quot;. Swan praised the high production values of both settings, saying, &quot;Both are beautiful games, into which a lot of effort has been invested&quot;. He also thought the Silhouette game system rules used in both was &quot;a clever, elegant system, a snap to learn and adjudicate&quot; and &quot;the smartest set of universal rules this side of the GURPS game.&quot; But overall he found Dream Pod 9&#x27;s work &quot;lifeless&quot; and focussed more on giant robots than roleplaying, saying their work &quot;aims more at players interested in hardware than human beings.&quot;

<doc id="863708" wikidata="Q73679" url="?curid=863708" title="William Trousdale">
<text>William Trousdale (September 23, 1790March 27, 1872) was an American soldier and politician. He served as the 13th governor of Tennessee from 1849 to 1851, and was United States Minister to Brazil from 1853 to 1857. He fought under Andrew Jackson in the Creek War, the War of 1812 and the Second Seminole War, and commanded the U.S. Fourteenth Infantry in the Mexican–American War. His military exploits earned him the nickname, &quot;War Horse of Sumner County.&quot;

==Early life==
Trousdale was born in Orange County, North Carolina, the son of James and Elizabeth (Dobbins) Trousdale. His father was of Scots-Irish descent, and had served in the Continental Army during the American Revolution. Captain James Trousdale was given a land grant as payment for services in the Revolution, and used this grant to acquire several hundred acres in Sumner County, Tennessee. The family moved to this plot in 1796. In 1801, the family donated part of their land for the establishment of a new county seat for Sumner County, which was named Gallatin. Trousdale attended public schools and studied under a tutor, the Reverend Gideon Blackburn.

==Military service and early political endeavors==
Trousdale joined Captain William Edwards&#x27;s Mounted Riflemen in 1812. When this company was called into service during the Creek War the following year, Trousdale was elected Lieutenant. The company saw action at the Battle of Tallushatchee and the Battle of Talladega before returning home.

In the Summer of 1814, after Trousdale had been at home for just a few months, he joined a militia company formed by Lieutenant-Colonel George Elliott. This company joined Jackson&#x27;s invasion of Florida later that year. At the Battle of Pensacola in November 1814, Trousdale took part in a charge that captured several cannons on the first day of fighting. He volunteered to be among the first wave of soldiers to assault Fort San Miguel, but the fort surrendered before the assault took place.

Following the capture of Pensacola, Trousdale&#x27;s unit hurried westward with Jackson&#x27;s forces to defend New Orleans from an impending British invasion. They arrived in the city in December 1814, and Trousdale took part in a series of firefights and night skirmishes against the British on December 23, December 27, and January 1. He fought in the decisive Battle of New Orleans on January 8, 1815.

After the war, Trousdale returned home and studied law. He was admitted to the bar in 1820, and commenced practice in Sumner County. He ran unsuccessfully for Congress in 1827 and 1829, and served on Gallatin&#x27;s Board of Aldermen from 1831 to 1835. He was elected to the Tennessee Senate in 1835, and served until the following year.

At the outbreak of the Second Seminole War in 1836, Trousdale formed his own company, and was elected colonel of the Second Regiment, First Brigade. His regiment took part in several skirmishes, and helped defeat Seminole forces at the Battle of Wahoo Swamp in November 1836.

In 1837, Trousdale once again ran for Congress for the 6th District congressional seat, but lost to William B. Campbell, his former subordinate in the Seminole War and his future gubernatorial opponent. He ran again in 1839 and 1845, but being a Democrat in a primarily Whig district, he was never successful. Trousdale campaigned for the unsuccessful Democratic presidential candidate, Martin Van Buren, in 1840.

During the Mexican–American War, Trousdale joined the Army with the rank of Colonel, and commanded the 14th U.S. Infantry. This regiment landed at Veracruz on June 13, 1847, and was placed under General Gideon Pillow&#x27;s 3rd Division. Trousdale&#x27;s forces linked up with Winfield Scott&#x27;s forces on July 8, and began the march inland to Mexico City. Trousdale took part in the Battle of Contreras and the Battle of Churubusco on August 20, and was grazed in the shoulder while fighting in the Battle of Molino del Rey on September 8. Trousdale commanded two regiments (the 14th and 11th) and an artillery battery at the Battle of Chapultepec on September 13. During this battle, his right arm was shattered by enemy fire, though he continued fighting, and managed to lead a charge that captured an enemy cannon. For his actions at Chapultepec, Trousdale was brevetted to brigadier general by President James K. Polk on August 23, 1848.

==Governor and later political endeavors==
In 1849, Trousdale received the Democratic nomination for governor. His Whig opponent, Neill S. Brown, had been opposed to the Mexican–American War, and was struggling with divisions over the issue of slavery in the national Whig Party. Trousdale, on the other hand, was riding a wave of popularity for his service in the war. As a result, Trousdale edged Brown by 1,400 votes in the general election.

In Trousdale&#x27;s reelection campaign in 1851, his opponent was William B. Campbell, a fellow Mexican–American War hero who had served under Trousdale in the Second Seminole War, and had defeated Trousdale for the 6th District congressional seat in 1837 and 1839. Like Brown in 1849, Trousdale&#x27;s campaign was damaged by the actions of his own party. At the Nashville Convention in 1850, which Trousdale had endorsed, southern Democrats called for secession should the United States implement the Wilmot Proviso, banning slavery in territory acquired as a result of the Mexican–American War. Secession was unpopular in Tennessee at the time, and following a relatively dignified campaign, Campbell defeated Trousdale by 1,500 votes.

In 1853, Trousdale was appointed &quot;Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary&quot; to Brazil by President Franklin Pierce. He arrived in Rio de Janeiro in July 1853, and served until 1857. He spent much of his term advocating the opening of the Amazon River to international commerce.

After returning to Sumner County, Trousdale spent the remainder of his life practicing law. He was consistently stricken with rheumatism, creating physical difficulties that prevented him from taking part in public life, as well as from serving in the Civil War in the 1860s. He nevertheless supported the Confederacy, and refused to take the Oath of Allegiance to the United States, even when Union soldiers occupied his home.

==Family==
Trousdale was married to Mary Ann Bugg in 1827. The couple had seven children.

==Death==
Trousdale died on March 27, 1872, and is interred at Gallatin City Cemetery in Gallatin, Tennessee.

==Legacy==
Trousdale County, Tennessee is named in his honor. His family home, the Federal-style &quot;Trousdale Place&quot; located near the town square of Gallatin, has been a preserved historical site since 1900.

<doc id="863712" wikidata="Q923732" url="?curid=863712" title="Liquid breathing">
<text>Liquid breathing is a form of respiration in which a normally air-breathing organism breathes an oxygen-rich liquid which is capable of CO2 gas exchange (such as a perfluorocarbon). 

The liquid involved requires certain physical properties, such as respiratory gas solubility, density, viscosity, vapor pressure and lipid solubility, which some perfluorochemicals (PFCs) have. Thus, it is critical to choose the appropriate PFC for a specific biomedical application, such as liquid ventilation, drug delivery or blood substitutes. The physical properties of PFC liquids vary substantially; however, the one common property is their high solubility for respiratory gases. In fact, these liquids carry more oxygen and carbon dioxide than blood.

In theory, liquid breathing could assist in the treatment of patients with severe pulmonary or cardiac trauma, especially in pediatric cases. Liquid breathing has also been proposed for use in deep diving and space travel. Despite some recent advances in liquid ventilation, a standard mode of application has not yet been established.

==Approaches==
As liquid breathing is still a highly experimental technique, there are several proposed approaches.

===Total liquid ventilation===

Although total liquid ventilation (TLV) with completely liquid-filled lungs can be beneficial, the complex liquid-filled tube system required is a disadvantage compared to gas ventilation—the system must incorporate a membrane oxygenator, heater, and pumps to deliver to, and remove from the lungs tidal volume of conditioned perfluorocarbon (PFC). One research group led by Thomas H. Shaffer has maintained that with the use of microprocessors and new technology, it is possible to maintain better control of respiratory variables such as liquid functional residual capacity and tidal volume during TLV than with gas ventilation. Consequently, the total liquid ventilation necessitates a dedicated liquid ventilator similar to a medical ventilator except that it uses a breathable liquid. Many prototypes are used for animal experimentation, but experts recommend continued development of a liquid ventilator toward clinical applications.
Specific preclinical liquid ventilator (Inolivent) is currently under joint development in Canada and France. The main application of this liquid ventilator is the ultra-fast induction of therapeutic hypothermia after cardiac arrest. This has been demonstrated to be more protective than slower cooling method after experimental cardiac arrest.

===Partial liquid ventilation===

In contrast, partial liquid ventilation (PLV) is a technique in which a PFC is instilled into the lung to a volume approximating functional residual capacity (approximately 40% of total lung capacity). Conventional mechanical ventilation delivers tidal volume breaths on top of it. This mode of liquid ventilation currently seems technologically more feasible than total liquid ventilation, because PLV could utilise technology currently in place in many neonatal intensive-care units (NICU) worldwide.

The influence of PLV on oxygenation, carbon dioxide removal and lung mechanics has been investigated in several animal studies using different models of lung injury. Clinical applications of PLV have been reported in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), meconium aspiration syndrome, congenital diaphragmatic hernia and respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) of neonates. In order to correctly and effectively conduct PLV, it is essential to
# properly dose a patient to a specific lung volume (10–15 ml/kg) to recruit alveolar volume 
# redose the lung with PFC liquid (1–2 ml/kg/h) to oppose PFC evaporation from the lung.
If PFC liquid is not maintained in the lung, PLV can not effectively protect the lung from biophysical forces associated with the gas ventilator.

New application modes for PFC have been developed.

Partial liquid ventilation (PLV) involves filling the lungs with a liquid. This liquid is a perfluorocarbon such as perflubron (brand name Liquivent). The liquid has some unique properties. It has a very low surface tension, similar to the surfactant substances produced in the lungs to prevent the alveoli from collapsing and sticking together during exhalation. It also has a high density, oxygen readily diffuses through it, and it may have some anti-inflammatory properties. In PLV, the lungs are filled with the liquid, the patient is then ventilated with a conventional ventilator using a protective lung ventilation strategy. The hope is that the liquid will help the transport of oxygen to parts of the lung that are flooded and filled with debris, help remove this debris and open up more alveoli improving lung function. The study of PLV involves comparison to protocolized ventilator strategy designed to minimize lung damage.

===PFC vapor===

Vaporization of perfluorohexane with two anesthetic vaporizers calibrated for perfluorohexane has been shown to improve gas exchange in oleic acid-induced lung injury in sheep.

Predominantly PFCs with high vapor pressure are suitable for vaporization.

===Aerosol-PFC===

With aerosolized perfluorooctane, significant improvement of oxygenation and pulmonary
mechanics was shown in adult sheep with oleic acid-induced lung injury.

In surfactant- piglets, persistent improvement of gas exchange and lung mechanics was demonstrated with Aerosol-PFC.
The aerosol device is of decisive importance for the efficacy of PFC aerosolization, as aerosolization of PF5080 (a less purified FC77) has been shown to be ineffective using a different aerosol device in surfactant-depleted rabbits. Partial liquid ventilation and Aerosol-PFC reduced pulmonary inflammatory response.

== Human usage ==

===Medical treatment===
The most promising area for the use of liquid ventilation is in the field of pediatric medicine. The first medical use of liquid breathing was treatment of premature babies and adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in the 1990s. Liquid breathing was used in clinical trials after the development by Alliance Pharmaceuticals of the fluorochemical perfluorooctyl bromide, or perflubron for short. Current methods of positive-pressure ventilation can contribute to the development of lung disease in pre-term neonates, leading to diseases such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia. Liquid ventilation removes many of the high pressure gradients responsible for this damage. Furthermore, perfluorocarbons have been demonstrated to reduce lung inflammation, improve ventilation-perfusion mismatch and to provide a novel route for the pulmonary administration of drugs.

In order to explore drug delivery techniques that would be useful for both partial and total liquid ventilation, more recent studies have focused on PFC drug delivery using a nanocrystal suspension. The first image is a computer model of a PFC liquid (perflubron) combined with gentamicin molecules.

The second image shows experimental results comparing both plasma and tissue levels of gentamicin after an intratracheal (IT) and intravenous (IV) dose of 5 mg/kg in a newborn lamb during gas ventilation. Note that the plasma levels of the IV dose greatly exceed the levels of the IT dose over the 4 hour study period; whereas, the lung tissue levels of gentamicin when delivered by an intratracheal (IT) suspension, uniformly exceed the intravenous (IV) delivery approach after 4 hours. Thus, the IT approach allows more effective delivery of the drug to the target organ while maintaining a safer level systemically. Both images represent the in-vivo time course over 4 hours. Numerous studies have now demonstrated the effectiveness of PFC liquids as a delivery vehicle to the lungs.

Clinical trials with premature infants and adults have been conducted. Since the safety of the procedure and the effectiveness were apparent from an early stage, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the product &quot;fast track&quot; status (meaning an accelerated review of the product, designed to get it to the public as quickly as is safely possible) due to its life-saving potential. Clinical trials showed that using perflubron with ordinary ventilators improved outcomes as much as using high frequency oscillating ventilation (HFOV). But because perflubron was not better than HFOV, the FDA did not approve perflubron, and Alliance is no longer pursuing the partial liquid ventilation application. Whether perflubron would improve outcomes when used with HFOV or has fewer long-term consequences than HFOV remains an open question.

In 1996 Mike Darwin and Steven B. Harris proposed using cold liquid ventilation with perfluorocarbon to quickly lower the body temperature of victims of cardiac arrest and other brain trauma to allow the brain to better recover.
The technology came to be called gas/liquid ventilation (GLV), and was shown able to achieve a cooling rate of 0.5 °C per minute in large animals. It has not yet been tried in humans.

Most recently, hypothermic brain protection has been associated with rapid brain cooling. In this regard, a new therapeutic approach is the use of intranasal perfluorochemical spray for preferential brain cooling. The nasopharyngeal (NP) approach is unique for brain cooling due to anatomic proximity to the cerebral circulation and arteries. Based on preclinical studies in adult sheep, it was shown that independent of region, brain cooling was faster during NP-perfluorochemical versus conventional whole body cooling with cooling blankets. To date, there have been four human studies including a completed randomized intra-arrest study (200 patients). Results clearly demonstrated that prehospital intra-arrest transnasal cooling is safe, feasible and is associated with an improvement in cooling time.

==Proposed uses==

===Diving===

Gas pressure increases with depth, rising 1 bar () every 10 meters to over 1,100 bar at the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Diving becomes more dangerous as depth increases, and deep diving presents many hazards. All surface-breathing animals are subject to decompression sickness, including aquatic mammals and free-diving humans. Breathing at depth can cause nitrogen narcosis and oxygen toxicity. Holding the breath while ascending after breathing at depth can cause air embolisms, burst lung, and collapsed lung.

Special breathing gas mixes such as trimix or heliox reduce the risk of nitrogen narcosis but do not eliminate it. Heliox further eliminates the risk of nitrogen narcosis but introduces the risk of helium tremors below about . Atmospheric diving suits maintain body and breathing pressure at 1 bar, eliminating most of the hazards of descending, ascending, and breathing at depth. However, the rigid suits are bulky, clumsy, and very expensive.

Liquid breathing offers a third option, promising the mobility available with flexible dive suits and the reduced risks of rigid suits. With liquid in the lungs, the pressure within the diver&#x27;s lungs could accommodate changes in the pressure of the surrounding water without the huge partial pressure gas exposures required when the lungs are filled with gas. Liquid breathing would not result in the saturation of body tissues with high pressure nitrogen or helium that occurs with the use of non-liquids, thus would reduce or remove the need for slow decompression.

A significant problem, however, arises firstly from its high density which is that perfluorocarbons are twice as dense as water which makes a significant effort to move the liquid in and out of the lungs, and secondly is its high viscosity of the liquid and the corresponding reduction in its ability to remove CO2. All uses of liquid breathing for diving must involve total liquid ventilation (see above). Total liquid ventilation, however, has difficulty moving enough liquid to carry away CO2, because no matter how great the total pressure is, the amount of partial CO2 gas pressure available to dissolve CO2 into the breathing liquid can never be much more than the pressure at which CO2 exists in the blood (about 40  mm of mercury (Torr)).

At these pressures, most fluorocarbon liquids require about 70 mL/kg minute-ventilation volumes of liquid (about 5 L/min for a 70 kg adult) to remove enough CO2 for normal resting metabolism. This is a great deal of fluid to move, particularly as liquids are more viscous and denser than gases, (for example water is about 850 times the density of air). Any increase in the diver&#x27;s metabolic activity also increases CO2 production and the breathing rate, which is already at the limits of realistic flow rates in liquid breathing. It seems unlikely that a person would move 10 liters/min of fluorocarbon liquid without assistance from a mechanical ventilator, so &quot;free breathing&quot; may be unlikely. However, it has been suggested that a liquid breathing system could be combined with a CO2 scrubber connected to the diver&#x27;s blood supply; a US patent has been filed for such a method.

===Space travel===

Liquid immersion provides a way to reduce the physical stress of G forces. Forces applied to fluids are distributed as omnidirectional pressures. As liquids cannot be practically compressed, they do not change density under high acceleration such as performed in aerial maneuvers or space travel. A person immersed in a liquid of the same density as tissue has acceleration forces distributed around the body, rather than applied at a single point such as a seat or harness straps. This principle is used in a new type of G-suit called the Libelle G-suit, which allows aircraft pilots to remain conscious and functioning at more than 10&quot;g&quot; acceleration by surrounding them with water in a rigid suit.

Acceleration protection by liquid immersion is limited by the differential density of body tissues and immersion fluid, limiting the utility of this method to about 15&quot;g&quot; to 20&quot;g&quot;.
Extending acceleration protection beyond 20&quot;g&quot; requires filling the lungs with fluid of density similar to water. An astronaut totally immersed in liquid, with liquid inside all body cavities, will feel little effect from extreme G forces because the forces on a liquid are distributed equally, and in all directions simultaneously. Effects will still be felt because of density differences between different body tissues, so an upper acceleration limit still exists. However, it can likely be higher than hundreds of G.

Liquid breathing for acceleration protection may never be practical because of the difficulty of finding a suitable breathing medium of similar density to water that is compatible with lung tissue. Perfluorocarbon fluids are twice as dense as water, hence unsuitable for this application.

<text>Alfred Neubauer (29 March 1891 – 22 August 1980) was the racing manager of the Mercedes-Benz Grand Prix team from 1926 to 1955.

==Biography==
Neubauer&#x27;s father, Karl Neubauer, was a furniture-maker in Neutitschein (), which then was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Karl christened his only son Alfred, but the child quickly became known to family and friends as Friedl.

Neubauer used to repair motor vehicles while he was an officer during his service in the Imperial Austrian army. After the First World War, he joined the Austrian car manufacturer Austro-Daimler, where Ferdinand Porsche appointed him to be chief tester. From 1922 onwards, Neubauer also drove in races, although without any great success. In 1923, when Ferdinand Porsche moved to the Daimler Works at Stuttgart (Daimler-Benz was not founded until 1926), he took Neubauer with him. In 1926, recognizing that he himself was not a great racing driver, Neubauer got an inspiration that let him create the position of racing team manager (&quot;Rennleiter&quot;).

Racing drivers in those days being isolated from the outside, they often did not know their position in a race. Occasionally a driver would learn that he had won after a race merely by surprise. To overcome this situation, Alfred Neubauer devised a well thought-out system, with flags and boards, to give his drivers more tactical information. When he tried out the system for the first time at the 1926 Solituderennen on 12 September 1926, the chief steward demanded angrily that he leave the track, since his &#x27;antics&#x27; were irritating the drivers. To Neubauer&#x27;s explanation that he was the &quot;Rennleiter&quot;, the organizer responded: ‘Are you mad? I’m the &quot;Rennleiter&quot;’ (&quot;Rennleiter&quot; can also mean “race director”).

The Mercedes-Benz team was soon winning races with SS and SSK racing cars, frequently in the hands of Rudolf Caracciola, the best driver during those days. Neubauer&#x27;s contribution lay not just in his tactical skill, but also in the perfectionistical, almost military drill of the pit crew, which constantly gave the team a time advantage over its rivals.

Neubauer&#x27;s organization at the Mille Miglia in 1931 was a master stroke. To reach each staging post before Caracciola arrived, he repeatedly criss-crossed Italy with his team.

According to Neubauer, the origin of the Silver Arrows phrase was due to the cars being overweighted at their first race. Neubauer&#x27;s story states that the rules prescribed a weight limit of 750 kg, whilst one day before the new cars&#x27; first race they weighed in at 751 kg. This led to Neubauer and Manfred von Brauchitsch eventually coming up with the idea of removing the cars&#x27; white paint. The silver-coloured aluminium bodywork was exposed, and the Silver Arrows were born. However, this story is a fabrication by Neubauer himself, a well-known raconteur. The debut race was run to Formula Libre rules, meaning there was no weight limit. Additionally, there are no reports or photographs from the time suggesting that the cars were ever run in white paint.

==Silver Arrows==

The Silver Arrows years were dominated by German racing cars and the rivalry between Mercedes-Benz and Auto Union. In its most successful phase, the Mercedes-Benz team&#x27;s regular drivers were Rudolf Caracciola, Hermann Lang, Manfred von Brauchitsch, and Richard Seaman.

After the Second World War, Mercedes-Benz was anxious to return to racing as soon as possible, but a new formula was announced for 1954, and there was insufficient time to produce a new model. As a compromise solution, the design of the Mercedes-Benz 300 was adapted. This resulted in a new racing car, the Mercedes-Benz 300SL.

With this car, Neubauer achieved victories at the Carrera Panamericana and the Le Mans 24-hour race. When Mercedes-Benz cars returned to Grand Prix racing in 1954, the new Silver Arrows proved to be as superior as those produced before the war. Juan Manuel Fangio was World Champion in 1954 and 1955.

Probably Neubauer&#x27;s worst day as racing manager was at Le Mans in 1955, when a Mercedes-Benz 300 SLR driven by Frenchman Pierre Levegh, was catapulted into the crowd, killing more than 80 people including Levegh. After consultation with Stuttgart, Neubauer withdrew the remaining cars from the event.

After the shock of Le Mans, Mercedes-Benz withdrew from racing altogether, and Alfred Neubauer retired.

<text>In mathematics, a Lie algebra is reductive if its adjoint representation is completely reducible, hence the name. More concretely, a Lie algebra is reductive if it is a direct sum of a semisimple Lie algebra and an abelian Lie algebra: formula_1 there are alternative characterizations, given below.

== Examples ==
The most basic example is the Lie algebra formula_2 of formula_3 matrices with the commutator as Lie bracket, or more abstractly as the endomorphism algebra of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional vector space, formula_4 This is the Lie algebra of the general linear group GL(&quot;n&quot;), and is reductive as it decomposes as formula_5 corresponding to traceless matrices and scalar matrices.

Any semisimple Lie algebra or abelian Lie algebra is &quot;a fortiori&quot; reductive.

Over the real numbers, compact Lie algebras are reductive.

== Definitions ==
A Lie algebra formula_6 over a field of characteristic 0 is called reductive if any of the following equivalent conditions are satisfied:
# The adjoint representation (the action by bracketing) of formula_6 is completely reducible (a direct sum of irreducible representations).
# formula_6 admits a faithful, completely reducible, finite-dimensional representation.
# The radical of formula_6 equals the center: formula_10
#:The radical always contains the center, but need not equal it.
# formula_6 is the direct sum of a semisimple ideal formula_12 and its center formula_13 formula_14
#:Compare to the Levi decomposition, which decomposes a Lie algebra as its radical (which is solvable, not abelian in general) and a Levi subalgebra (which is semisimple).
# formula_6 is a direct sum of a semisimple Lie algebra formula_16 and an abelian Lie algebra formula_17: formula_18
# formula_6 is a direct sum of prime ideals: formula_20
Some of these equivalences are easily seen. For example, the center and radical of formula_21 is formula_22 while if the radical equals the center the Levi decomposition yields a decomposition formula_14 Further, simple Lie algebras and the trivial 1-dimensional Lie algebra formula_24 are prime ideals.

== Properties ==
Reductive Lie algebras are a generalization of semisimple Lie algebras, and share many properties with them: many properties of semisimple Lie algebras depend only on the fact that they are reductive. Notably, the unitarian trick of Hermann Weyl works for reductive Lie algebras.

The associated reductive Lie groups are of significant interest: the Langlands program is based on the premise that what is done for one reductive Lie group should be done for all.

The intersection of reductive Lie algebras and solvable Lie algebras is exactly abelian Lie algebras (contrast with the intersection of semisimple and solvable Lie algebras being trivial).

<text>Scottish term and quarter days mark the four divisions (terms and quarters) of the legal year in Scotland. These were historically used as the days when contracts and leases would begin and end, servants would be hired or dismissed, and rent, interest on loans, and ministers&#x27; stipends would become due. 

==Description==
The Term Days are Whitsunday and Martinmas, and together with Candlemas and Lammas they constitute the Quarter Days. These originally occurred on Christian holy days, corresponding roughly to old quarter days used in both Scotland and Ireland, with White Sunday or Whitsun occurring at the Easter Pentecost and thus moving around. These were mapped from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar and fixed in 1886 as 28 February, 28 May, 28 August and 28 November, and then later ratified by the Term and Quarter Days (Scotland) Act 1990.

==Pre-1886==
The Old Scottish Term and Quarter Days (Julian to Gregorian):
*Candlemas (2 February)
*Whitsunday (15 May)
*Lammas (1 August)
*Martinmas (11 November)

==Post-1886==
The new Scottish Term and Quarter Days (Gregorian post-1886):
* 28 February
* 28 May
* 28 August
* 28 November

==History==
Candlemas originally fell on 2 February, the day of the feast of the Purification, or the Presentation of Christ. This was celebrated in pre-Reformation times by candlelit processions. The tradition was started in the 5th century during the Roman celebration of Februa, and carried over into Scotland, where mothers of children born the previous year would march with candles, hoping to be purified by the Virgin Mary.

Whitsun was originally the feast of Pentecost, around which a great many christenings would occur, so it became associated with the colour white. Because the date of Pentecost moves each year, the legal Term Day of Whitsunday ( not to be confused with the church festival) was fixed in Scotland as 26 May in the Julian Calendar, which became 15 May under the Gregorian Calendar, adopted in Scotland in 1599.

Lammas was celebrated on 1 August, the day the first fruits of the harvest were offered, the name coming from the Anglo-Saxon for &#x27;loaf-mass&#x27; or &#x27;bread-feast&#x27;.

Martinmas, on 11 November, was originally the feast of Saint Martin of Tours, a 4th-century bishop and hermit.

In Scotland, 1886 saw the term dates for removals and the hiring of servants in towns changed to 28 February, 28 May, 28 August and 28 November. The original dates are now referred to as &quot;Old Scottish Term Days&quot;. The dates were regularised by the Term and Quarter Days (Scotland) Act 1990.

==Modern use==
The usage of term days is now most common in leases of farmland and less frequently with other leases. Other references to them tend to be historical or ceremonial.

The College of Justice (supreme courts of Scotland) no longer uses the term or quarter days to determine the terms of the Court of Session or High Court, instead dividing the legal year into winter (late September to last Friday before Christmas), spring (early January to late March) and summer (late April to early July) terms.

In the ancient universities, the academic terms were named after Martinmas, Candlemas and Whitsun, and at the University of St Andrews the two semesters continue to be named Martinmas and Candlemas.

<text>Tabletop games or tabletops are games that are normally played on a table or other flat surface, such as board games, card games, dice games, miniature wargames, tabletop role-playing games, or tile-based games.

==Classification according to equipment used==
Tabletop games can be classified according to the general form, or equipment utilized:

Games like chess and draughts are examples of games belonging to the board game category. Other games, however, use various attributes and cannot be classified unambiguously (e.g. &quot;Monopoly&quot; and many modern eurogames utilize a board as well as dice and cards).

For several of these categories there are sub-categories and even sub-sub-categories or genres. For instance, German-style board games, board wargames, and roll-and-move games are all types of board games that differ markedly in style and general interest.

===Tabletop game components===
The various specialized parts, pieces, and tools used for playing tabletop games may include:

* Stopwatch, clock, hourglass or egg timer
* , Miniature figures, pawn, or playing piece
* Gambling chips or &quot;play&quot; money
* Game board
* Game box or container
* Scoreboard or paper pad
* Cardboard Counter, Dial Counter, Marker or for keeping score/tally
* Pencil
* manuals
* Ruler or measuring device
* Modelling clay
* Gamemaster&#x27;s screen
* Bowls, trays, or component organizers
* Stickers often used in Legacy games
* Card sleeves used in games that have a &quot;Card Crafting System&quot;
* Randomizers such as:
** Coins
** Dice, which can include polyhedral dice
** Dice tower or Dice cup
** Playing cards, which can be collectible cards
** Shuffling machine
** Tiles
** Tops, such as Teetotums or Dreidels
** Drawstring bag
** Spinners
** Bones, Cowrie Shells, or Stick dice, used in ancient games

A refereed game could also include various aids to play, including scenario packs and computer game aids. Role-playing games can include campaign settings and various supplementary manuals and notes.

==Classification according to elements of chance==

As an alternative to classifying games by equipment, they can also be classified according to the elements of chance involved.
In game theory, two fundamentally different elements of chance can play a role:
* Chance due to outcome uncertainty, e.g. due to dice rolls or due to unknown cards being dealt during the game. Games in which outcome uncertainty plays a role are referred to as stochastic games as opposed to deterministic games.
* Chance due to state uncertainty, e.g. due to the opponent&#x27;s position or cards not being visible, or due to the simultaneous move character of the game. Games in which state uncertainty plays a role are referred to as partial or imperfect information games as opposed to full or perfect information games.

Examples of the chance classification for some well-known tabletop games are given in the table below.

==Organizations==

List of organizations that sponsor events featuring tabletop games:
* Board Game Geek organizes BGG.CON
* PAX hosts PAX Unplugged
* Geek &amp; Sundry promotes an annual International TableTop Day
* The Organization of Gamers &amp; Roleplaying Enthusiasts (O.G.R.E.s) organizes tabletop events for OMGcon
* White Wolf Publishing&#x27;s Camarilla
* Wizards of the Coast own RPGA
* The Historical Miniatures Gaming Society promotes historical miniatures wargaming and organizes wargaming events such as Historicon
* SaltCON LLC organizes SaltCON and the Ion Award competition for unpublished tabletop games

Numerous independent, local groups run by gamers exist to play tabletop games. Additionally, many colleges have student run organizations pertaining solely to table top gaming. The Collegiate Association of Table Top Gamers is one such organization that has a few chapters at different schools.

== Digital tabletop games ==

Digital tabletops games are digital variations of tabletop games, which include straight reproductions of existing physical tabletop games, video games that use tabletop game principles as part of their gameplay mechanics, and tabletop simulators that provide a virtual tabletop for conducting tabletop games online.

<text>Gaston Tissandier (November 21, 1843 – August 30, 1899) was a French chemist, meteorologist, aviator, and editor. He founded and edited the scientific magazine &quot;La Nature&quot; and wrote several books.

His brother was illustrator Albert Tissandier. His son Paul became a well known aviator in his own right.

==Biography==

Gaston Tissandier was born in Paris in 1843. He studied chemistry and in 1864 became the head of the experimental laboratory of Union nationales. He was also a teacher at Association polytechnique. His interest in meteorology led him to take up aviation.

His first trip in the air was conducted at Calais in 1868 together with , where his balloon drifted out over the sea and was brought back by an air stream of opposite direction in a higher layer of air. In September 1870, during the Franco-Prussian War, he managed to escape the besieged Paris by balloon.

His most adventurous air trip took place near Paris in April 1875. He and companions Joseph Crocé-Spinelli, journalist, and , naval officer, were able to reach in a balloon the magnificent altitude of 8,600 meters (28,200 feet). Both of his companions died from breathing the thin air. Tissandier survived, but lost his hearing. He described the symptoms of altitude sickness.

In 1883, Tissandier fit a Siemens electric motor to an airship, thus creating the first electric-powered flight.

Tissandier reported his meteorological observations to the French Academy of Sciences. In 1873 he founded the weekly scientific magazine &quot;La Nature&quot;, which he edited until 1896, after which it was continued by others. He also authored several books:

Besides these scientific works, Tissandier also published several titles for the youth, such as &quot;Les récréations scientifiques ou l&#x27;enseignement par les jeux&quot; (1880), perhaps the very first title in the genre of books of simple science experiments that anybody can conduct in their own home. Its chapters were in part based on the column &quot;physique sans appareils&quot; (physics without apparatus) in &quot;La Nature&quot;.

<text>The Tsar Bell (; ), also known as the Tsarsky Kolokol, Tsar Kolokol III, or Royal Bell, is a , bell on display on the grounds of the Moscow Kremlin. The bell was commissioned by Empress Anna Ivanovna, niece of Peter the Great.

It has never been in working order, suspended, nor rung.

The present bell is sometimes referred to as &quot;Kolokol III&quot; (Bell III), because it is the third generation.

==General description==
The Tsar Bell is located between the Ivan the Great Bell Tower and the Kremlin Wall. Made of bell bronze, the bell cracked during a fire after being completed and has never been rung. The bell is the largest bell in the world, weighing , with a height of and diameter of , and thickness of up to . The broken piece weighs . 
The bell is decorated with relief images of baroque angels, plants, oval medallions with saints, and nearly life-size images of Empress Anna and Tsar Alexey, who was reigning at the time the previous Tsar Bell was cast.

==History==

The history of Russian bell founding goes back to the 10th century, but in the medieval Russian Orthodox Church, bells were not typically rung to indicate church services, but to announce important ceremonies and celebrations, and as an alarm in case of fire or enemy attack. One of the largest of the early bells was the original Tsar Bell, cast in the 16th century. Completed in 1600, it weighed and required 24 men to ring its clapper. Housed in the original wooden Ivan the Great Bell Tower in the Moscow Kremlin, it crashed to the ground in a fire in the mid-17th century and was broken to pieces. 

The second Tsar Bell was cast in 1655, using the remnants of the former bell, but on a much larger scale. This bell weighed , but was again destroyed by fire in 1701.

After becoming Empress, Anna ordered that the pieces be cast into a new bell with its weight increased by another hundred tons, and dispatched the son of Field Marshal Münnich to Paris to solicit technical help from the master craftsmen there. However, a bell of such size was unprecedented, and Münnich was not taken seriously. In 1733, the job was assigned to local foundry masters, Ivan Motorin and his son Mikhail, based on their experience in casting a bronze cannon.

A pit deep was dug (near the location of the present bell), with a clay form, and walls reinforced with rammed earth to withstand the pressure of the molten metal. Obtaining the necessary metals proved a challenge, for in addition to the parts of the old bell, an additional of silver and of gold were added to the mixture. After months of preparation, casting work commenced at the end of November 1734. The first attempt was not successful, and the project was incomplete when Ivan Motorin died in August, 1735. His son Mikhail carried on the work, and the second attempt at casting succeeded on November 25, 1735. Ornaments were added as the bell was cooling while raised above the casting pit through 1737.

However, before the last ornamentation was completed, a major fire broke out at the Kremlin in May 1737. The fire spread to the temporary wooden support structure for the bell, and fearing damage, guards threw cold water on it, causing eleven cracks, and a huge slab to break off. The fire burned through the wooden supports, and the damaged bell fell back into its casting pit. 
The Tsar Bell remained in its pit for almost a century. Unsuccessful attempts to raise it were made in 1792 and 1819. Napoleon Bonaparte, during his occupation of Moscow in 1812, considered removing it as a trophy to France, but was unable to do so, due to its size and weight. 

It was finally successfully raised in the summer of 1836 by the French architect Auguste de Montferrand and placed on a stone pedestal. The broken slab alone is nearly three times larger than the world&#x27;s largest bell hung for full circle ringing, the tenor bell at Liverpool Cathedral.

For a time, the bell served as a chapel, with the broken area forming the door.

Voltaire once joked that the Kremlin&#x27;s two greatest items were a bell which was never rung and a cannon (the Tsar Pushka) that was never fired.

==Bell diagnostics==

In the mid-1980s, some deformation of the pedestal was noticed, as a result of which there were concerns about the possible growth of cracks in the bell. At the request of the Minister of Culture of the USSR and in accordance with the instructions of the Minister of Defense of the USSR, the Military Academy named after F. E. Dzerzhinsky (now Peter the Great Military Academy of the Strategic Missile Forces) was commissioned in 1986 to carry out a complex of works on the restoration and preservation of the Tsar Bell. The actual condition of its cracks was assessed using the acoustic emission (AE) method. To conduct the AE diagnostics of the bell, employees of the Research Institute of Mechanics and Applied Mathematics of Rostov State University were involved under the guidance of the head of the AE laboratory, Ph.D. S. I. Builo. On behalf of the F. E. Dzerzhinsky Academy, these works were provided by Colonel, Ph.D. A. I. Gnevko. Diagnostics of the Tsar Bell was carried out in two stages using an in-house hardware AE complex brought from Rostov-on-Don.

At the first stage, the parameters and features of the AE radiation of the bell material were investigated. This part of the work was carried out on the territory of the F. E. Dzerzhinsky Academy when testing specially made large-sized (more than 10 cm thick and weighing about 100 kg) samples made of a bronze alloy identical to the bell material. At the second stage, acoustic calibration and diagnostics of the Tsar Bell itself were carried out on the territory of the Kremlin. The work on the bell consisted, if we do without scientific terms, as if in &quot;listening&quot; to it for the presence of ultrasonic radiation of growing cracks. It was found that the condition of the Tsar Bell at the time of diagnosis is satisfactory, and in the near future it is not in danger of catastrophic destruction.

To further monitor the condition of the bell cracks, Rostov residents were asked to make a multi-channel AE diagnostic system with the installation of a separate sensor at the top of each of the large cracks. However, for the permanent installation of AE receiving sensors on the bell, it was necessary to coordinate many different issues. For example, it was necessary to prove that a constantly working system listening to the bell would not be able to listen to anything else &quot;wrong&quot; around and so on. However, as a result of restructuring during Perestroika, further assessment of the bell was deprioritized; the discussion and coordination of issues surrounding its preservation have since been delayed. 

Judging by some external signs, a slight deformation of the bell still continues. The &quot;tradition&quot; of pushing metal coins into the cracks of the bell is also alarming. And if earlier small coins had a composition close to the bell material, then the current ones are made of completely different metals, which in the presence of moisture can cause noticeable electrochemical corrosion of the material inside the cracks. For a reliable assessment of the condition of the Tsar Bell in the future, it is necessary to periodically conduct a procedure for diagnosing the possible growth of cracks in its walls by non-destructive testing methods.

==Computational simulation of sound==
In the spring of 2016, a team of University of California, Berkeley; Stanford University; and University of Michigan researchers publicly performed an electronic reproduction of how the Tsar Bell would sound if it had not been damaged during casting.
To simulate the sound of the bell, the team researched the bell&#x27;s material characteristics and constructed a polygon mesh that modeled the shape of the bell. The team then used finite element analysis to compute the component frequencies of the bell when rung.
For the first public performance, a stack of twelve speakers installed below the campanile on the UC Berkeley campus played the digital simulation of the Tsar Bell. The fundamental frequency of the sound was approximately 81 Hz. The American disk jockey DJ Spooky composed &quot;New Forms&quot; (2016), a duet for carillon and the reproduction of the Tsar Bell.

<text>A light field, or lightfield, is a vector function that describes the amount of light flowing in every direction through every point in a space. The space of all possible &quot;light rays&quot; is given by the five-dimensional plenoptic function, and the magnitude of each ray is given by its radiance. Michael Faraday was the first to propose that light should be interpreted as a field, much like the magnetic fields on which he had been working. The term &quot;light field&quot; was coined by Andrey Gershun in a classic 1936 paper on the radiometric properties of light in three-dimensional space.

The term &quot;radiance field&quot; may also be used to refer to similar, or identical concepts. The term is used in modern research such as neural radiance fields

==The plenoptic function==
For geometric optics—i.e., to incoherent light and to objects larger than the wavelength of light—the fundamental carrier of light is a ray. The measure for the amount of light traveling along a ray is radiance, denoted by &quot;L&quot; and measured in ; i.e., watts (W) per steradian (sr) per square meter (m2). The steradian is a measure of solid angle, and meters squared are used as a measure of cross-sectional area, as shown at right.

The radiance along all such rays in a region of three-dimensional space illuminated by an unchanging arrangement of lights is called the plenoptic function. The plenoptic illumination function is an idealized function used in computer vision and computer graphics to express the image of a scene from any possible viewing position at any viewing angle at any point in time. It is not used in practice computationally, but is conceptually useful in understanding other concepts in vision and graphics. Since rays in space can be parameterized by three coordinates, &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, and &quot;z&quot; and two angles &quot;θ&quot; and &quot;ϕ&quot;, as shown at left, it is a five-dimensional function, that is, a function over a five-dimensional manifold equivalent to the product of 3D Euclidean space and the 2-sphere.

The light field at each point in space can be treated as an infinite collection of vectors, one per direction impinging on the point, with lengths proportional to their radiances.

Integrating these vectors over any collection of lights, or over the entire sphere of directions, produces a single scalar value—the total irradiance at that point, and a resultant direction. The figure shows this calculation for the case of two light sources. In computer graphics, this vector-valued function of 3D space is called the vector irradiance field. The vector direction at each point in the field can be interpreted as the orientation of a flat surface placed at that point to most brightly illuminate it.

===Higher dimensionality===
Time, wavelength, and polarization angle can be treated as additional dimensions, yielding higher-dimensional functions, accordingly.

==The 4D light field==
In a plenoptic function, if the region of interest contains a concave object (e.g., a cupped hand), then light leaving one point on the object may travel only a short distance before another point on the object blocks it. No practical device could measure the function in such a region.

However, for locations outside the object&#x27;s convex hull (e.g., shrink-wrap), the plenoptic function can be measured by capturing multiple images. In this case the function contains redundant information, because the radiance along a ray remains constant throughout its length. The redundant information is exactly one dimension, leaving a four-dimensional function variously termed the photic field, the 4D light field or lumigraph. Formally, the field is defined as radiance along rays in empty space.

The set of rays in a light field can be parameterized in a variety of ways. The most common is the two-plane parameterization. While this parameterization cannot represent all rays, for example rays parallel to the two planes if the planes are parallel to each other, it relates closely to the analytic geometry of perspective imaging. A simple way to think about a two-plane light field is as a collection of perspective images of the &quot;st&quot; plane (and any objects that may lie astride or beyond it), each taken from an observer position on the &quot;uv&quot; plane. A light field parameterized this way is sometimes called a light slab.


===Sound analog===
The analog of the 4D light field for sound is the sound field or wave field&quot;,&quot; as in wave field synthesis, and the corresponding parametrization is the Kirchhoff–Helmholtz integral, which states that, in the absence of obstacles, a sound field over time is given by the pressure on a plane. Thus this is two dimensions of information at any point in time, and over time, a 3D field.

This two-dimensionality, compared with the apparent four-dimensionality of light, is because light travels in rays (0D at a point in time, 1D over time), while by the Huygens–Fresnel principle, a sound wave front can be modeled as spherical waves (2D at a point in time, 3D over time): light moves in a single direction (2D of information), while sound expands in every direction. However, light travelling in non-vacuous media may scatter in a similar fashion, and the irreversibility or information lost in the scattering is discernible in the apparent loss of a system dimension.

== Image refocusing ==
Because light field provides spatial and angular information, we can alter the position of focal planes after exposure, which is often termed &quot;refocusing&quot;. The principle of refocusing is to obtain conventional 2-D photographs from a light field through the integral transform. The transform takes a lightfield as its input and generates a photograph focused on a specific plane.

Assuming formula_1 represents a 4-D light field that records light rays traveling from position formula_2 on the first plane to position formula_3 on the second plane, where formula_4 is the distance between two planes, a 2-D photograph at any depth formula_5 can be obtained from the following integral transform:

:formula_6,

or more concisely,

:formula_7,

where formula_8, formula_9, and formula_10 is the photography operator.

In practice, this formula cannot be directly used because a plenoptic camera usually captures discrete samples of the lightfield formula_1, and hence resampling (or interpolation) is needed to compute formula_12. Another problem is high computation complexity. To compute an formula_13 2-D photograph from an formula_14 4-D light field, the complexity of the formula is formula_15.

=== Fourier slice photography ===
One way to reduce the complexity of computation is to adopt the concept of Fourier slice theorem: The photography operator formula_10 can be viewed as a shear followed by projection. The result should be proportional to a dilated 2-D slice of the 4-D Fourier transform of a light field. More precisely, a refocused image can be generated from the 4-D Fourier spectrum of a light field by extracting a 2-D slice, applying an inverse 2-D transform, and scaling. The asymptotic complexity of the algorithm is formula_17.

=== Discrete focal stack transform ===
Another way to efficiently compute 2-D photographs is to adopt discrete focal stack transform (DFST). DFST is designed to generate a collection of refocused 2-D photographs, or so-called Focal Stack. This method can be implemeted by fast fractional fourier transform (FrFT).

The discrete photography operator formula_10 is defined as follows for a lightfield formula_19 sampled in a 4-D grid formula_20 formula_21, formula_22:

:formula_23

Because formula_24 is usually not on the 4-D grid, DFST adopts trigonometric interpolation to compute the non-grid values.

The algorithm consists of these steps:

* Sample the light field formula_19 with the sampling period formula_26 and formula_27 and get the discretized light field formula_28.
* Pad formula_28 with zeros such that the signal length is enough for FrFT without aliasing.
* For every formula_30, compute the Discrete Fourier transform of formula_28, and get the result formula_32.
* For every focal length formula_5, compute the fractional fourier transform of formula_32, where the order of the transform depends on formula_35, and get the result formula_36.
* Compute the inverse Discrete Fourier transform of formula_36.
* Remove the marginal pixels of formula_36 so that each 2-D photograph has the size formula_39 by formula_39

==Methods to create light fields==
In computer graphics, light fields are typically produced either by rendering a 3D model or by photographing a real scene. In either case, to produce a light field, views must be obtained for a large collection of viewpoints. Depending on the parameterization, this collection typically spans some portion of a line, circle, plane, sphere, or other shape, although unstructured collections are possible.

Devices for capturing light fields photographically may include a moving handheld camera or a robotically controlled camera, an arc of cameras (as in the bullet time effect used in &quot;The Matrix&quot;), a dense array of cameras, handheld cameras, microscopes, or other optical system.

The number of images in a light field depends on the application. A light field capture of Michelangelo&#x27;s statue of &quot;Night&quot; contains 24,000 1.3-megapixel images, which is considered large as of 2022. For light field rendering to completely capture an opaque object, images must be taken of at least the front and back. Less obviously, for an object that lies astride the &quot;st&quot; plane, finely spaced images must be taken on the &quot;uv&quot; plane (in the two-plane parameterization shown above).

The number and arrangement of images in a light field, and the resolution of each image, are together called the &quot;sampling&quot; of the 4D light field. Also of interest are the effects of occlusion, lighting and reflection.

==Applications==

===Illumination engineering===
Gershun&#x27;s reason for studying the light field was to derive (in closed form) illumination patterns that would be observed on surfaces due to light sources of various shapes positioned above these surface. The branch of optics devoted to illumination engineering is nonimaging optics. It extensively uses the concept of flow lines (Gershun&#x27;s flux lines) and vector flux (Gershun&#x27;s light vector). However, the light field (in this case the positions and directions defining the light rays) is commonly described in terms of phase space and Hamiltonian optics.

===Light field rendering===
Extracting appropriate 2D slices from the 4D light field of a scene, enables novel views of the scene. Depending on the parameterization of the light field and slices, these views might be perspective, orthographic, crossed-slit, general linear cameras, multi-perspective, or another type of projection. Light field rendering is one form of image-based rendering.

===Synthetic aperture photography===
Integrating an appropriate 4D subset of the samples in a light field can approximate the view that would be captured by a camera having a finite (i.e., non-pinhole) aperture. Such a view has a finite depth of field. Shearing or warping the light field before performing this integration can focus on different fronto-parallel or oblique planes. Images captured by digital cameras that capture the light field can be refocused.

===3D display===
Presenting a light field using technology that maps each sample to the appropriate ray in physical space produces an autostereoscopic visual effect akin to viewing the original scene. Non-digital technologies for doing this include integral photography, parallax panoramagrams, and holography; digital technologies include placing an array of lenslets over a high-resolution display screen, or projecting the imagery onto an array of lenslets using an array of video projectors. An array of video cameras can capture and display a time-varying light field. This essentially constitutes a 3D television system. Modern approaches to light-field display explore co-designs of optical elements and compressive computation to achieve higher resolutions, increased contrast, wider fields of view, and other benefits.

===Brain imaging===
Neural activity can be recorded optically by genetically encoding neurons with reversible fluorescent markers such as GCaMP that indicate the presence of calcium ions in real time. Since light field microscopy captures full volume information in a single frame, it is possible to monitor neural activity in individual neurons randomly distributed in a large volume at video framerate. Quantitative measurement of neural activity can be done despite optical aberrations in brain tissue and without reconstructing a volume image, and be used to monitor activity in thousands of neurons.

===Generalized scene reconstruction (GSR)===
This is a method of creating and/or refining a real scene model (aka a Large Scene Model (LSM)) representing a generalized light field and a relightable matter field. Data used in reconstruction includes images, video, object models, and/or scene models. Data used in reconstruction includes images, video, object models, and/or scene models. The generalized light field represents light flowing in the scene. The relightable matter field represents the light interaction properties and emissivity of matter occupying the scene. Scene data structures can be implemented using Neural Networks, and Physics-based structures, among others. The light and matter fields are at least partially disentangled.

===Holographic stereograms===
Image generation and predistortion of synthetic imagery for holographic stereograms is one of the earliest examples of computed light fields.

===Glare reduction===
Glare arises due to multiple scattering of light inside the camera body and lens optics that reduces image contrast. While glare has been analyzed in 2D image space, it is useful to identify it as a 4D ray-space phenomenon. Statistically analyzing the ray-space inside a camera allows the classification and removal of glare artifacts. In ray-space, glare behaves as high frequency noise and can be reduced by outlier rejection. Such analysis can be performed by capturing the light field inside the camera, but it results in the loss of spatial resolution. Uniform and non-uniform ray sampling can be used to reduce glare without significantly compromising image resolution.

<doc id="863742" wikidata="Q135702" url="?curid=863742" title="Edward H. East">
<text>Edward Hazzard East (October 1, 1830 – November 12, 1904) was an American attorney, judge, and politician. He served as Secretary of State for the state of Tennessee from 1862 to 1865, having been appointed by Andrew Johnson, the state&#x27;s military governor under the Union Army occupation during the Civil War. East briefly served as the state&#x27;s acting governor during the interim between Johnson&#x27;s inauguration as U.S. Vice President on March 4, 1865, and the inauguration of the state&#x27;s &quot;elected&quot; governor, William G. Brownlow, on April 5, 1865.

==Life and career==

East was born in Davidson County, Tennessee, one of ten children of Edward Hyde East and Celia Buchanan East. His paternal grandfather, Benjamin East, had migrated from England in the 18th century. His father served as a justice of the peace for Davidson County, and was a supporter of Whig presidential candidate Hugh Lawson White in 1836.

East enrolled in Washington Institute in Nashville in the late 1840s, and graduated with a degree in literature in 1850. He then studied law at the Cumberland University Law School (now the Cumberland School of Law), graduating with a Bachelor of Laws in 1854. Afterward, he practiced law in Nashville.

In 1859, East, a lifelong Whig, was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives as a member of the Opposition Party (which the state&#x27;s Whigs had formed after the collapse of the national Whig Party). In the months leading up to the Civil War, East steadfastly opposed secession. When the state began to align itself with the Confederacy, he resigned his seat. While he supported the Union, he refused to take up arms against the South, and retired from public life.

In March 1862, the Union Army occupied Nashville, and former governor Andrew Johnson was appointed military governor of the state. Shortly afterward, Johnson set up a cabinet: East was appointed secretary of state, Joseph S. Fowler was appointed comptroller, and Horace Maynard was appointed attorney general. When Johnson was elected vice president on Lincoln&#x27;s ticket in November 1864, authorities realized there would be a month between Johnson&#x27;s inauguration as vice president on March 4, 1865, and the inauguration of William G. Brownlow as governor on April 5. Several of Lincoln&#x27;s advisors suggested he appoint Brownlow military governor for this interim, but Lincoln chose to allow East to continue as acting governor. The official &quot;Tennessee Blue Book&quot; does not recognize East&#x27;s governorship and does not include East in its official list of former governors.

When Johnson became president following Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, he asked East to serve in his cabinet, but East declined. East served as chancellor for Davidson County from 1869 to 1870, and chancellor for the state&#x27;s Seventh Division (created by the 1870 state constitution) from 1870 to 1872. Afterward, he worked as counsel for the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway.

In 1874, East was elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, and served as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. As such, he was instrumental in convincing the state to acknowledge and resolve its debt issues. The state&#x27;s Greenback Party nominated East as their candidate for governor in 1878, but he declined the nomination. In 1892, East ran for governor on the Prohibition Party ticket, but placed a distant fourth behind Democrat Peter Turney, Republican George W. Winstead, and Farm-Labor incumbent John P. Buchanan.

==Death==
East died in Davidson County on November 12, 1904. He is interred at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Nashville.

==Family life and public service==

East was the second husband of Ida Horton. Edward and Ida had two daughters, Edine and Bessie. Ida was active in the Temperance movement.

East served on the inaugural board of trust of Vanderbilt University. He was also president of the board of trust for the Tennessee School for the Blind in Nashville, and president of the board of directors for the Tennessee Hospital for the Insane. In 1880, he was awarded an honorary LL.D from the University of Nashville. East represented the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, at the Methodist Ecumenical Council in London in 1881.

<doc id="863748" wikidata="Q5013768" url="?curid=863748" title="CP 55,940">
<text>CP 55,940 is a synthetic cannabinoid which mimics the effects of naturally occurring THC (one of the psychoactive compounds found in cannabis). CP 55,940 was created by Pfizer in 1974 but was never marketed. It is currently used as a research tool to study the endocannabinoid system.

== Pharmacology ==

CP 55,940 is 45 times more potent than Δ9-THC, and fully antagonized by rimonabant (SR141716A). It is considered a full agonist at both CB1 and CB2 receptors and has Ki values of 0.58 nM and 0.68 nM respectively, but is an antagonist at GPR55, the putative &quot;CB3&quot; receptor. CP 55,940 binding has been detected in the cytosol of rat brain cerebral cortex. It can upregulate 5-HT2A receptors in mice.

== In vitro studies ==

CP 55,940 induced cell death in NG 108-15 Mouse neuroblastoma x Rat glioma hybrid brain cancer (genetically engineered mouse x rat brain cancer) cells.

== In vivo studies ==

CP 55,940 showed protective effects on rat brain mitochondria upon paraquat exposure.

It also showed neuroprotective effects by reducing intracellular calcium release and reducing hippocampal cell death in cultured neurons subjected to high levels of NMDA.

<text>Per Brinch Hansen (13 November 1938 – 31 July 2007) was a Danish-American computer scientist known for his work in operating systems, concurrent programming and parallel and distributed computing.

==Biography==

=== Early life and education ===

Per Brinch Hansen was born in Frederiksberg, an enclave surrounded by Copenhagen, Denmark. His father, Jørgen Brinch Hansen, worked as a civil engineer, becoming a leading expert in soil mechanics, and later accepting a professorship at Technical University of Denmark. His mother, Elsebeth Brinch Hansen (née Ring), was the daughter of Danish composer Oluf Ring and worked as a hairdresser before marrying.

Brinch Hansen attended Skt. Jørgens Gymnasium and then studied electrical engineering at Technical University of Denmark where he sought an area to pursue that &quot;was still in its pioneering phase&quot; on the belief that &quot;If a subject was being taught, it was probably already too late to make fundamental contributions.&quot; After a seven-week student internship at IBM&#x27;s Hursley Laboratory in England, he decided to dedicate his career to computers. Initially focused on computer construction, reading a book on the IBM 7030 Stretch project that described computer organization from a programmer&#x27;s point of view refocused his interest toward becoming a computer architect.

=== Regnecentralen ===

After completing a Master of Science degree in electronic engineering in 1963, Brinch Hansen landed a job at Regnecentralen, then a research institution under The Danish Academy of Technical Sciences (Akademiet for de Tekniske Videnskaber), working in the compiler group, led by Peter Naur and Jørn Jensen. There, his first significant project was writing a parser for a COBOL compiler for the Siemens 3003 computer.

Subsequently, he wrote a file system to be used during execution of the compiled COBOL programs, later observing:

In 1966, Brinch Hansen moved to Henning Isaksson&#x27;s hardware group at Regnecentralen, by then a company with shareholders. Together with Peter Kraft, he defined the computer architecture and instruction set for Regnecentralen&#x27;s third computer, the RC 4000, using ALGOL 60 as a hardware description language to produce a formal specification.

Inexperienced with multiprogramming, he used a copy of &quot;Cooperating Sequential Processes&quot; Edsger Dijkstra had sent him to understand process synchronization using semaphores, and then implemented a specialized RC 4000 real-time monitor for use in managing a fertilizer plant. Peter Kraft and Charles Simonyi, who was still a teenager, wrote a p-code interpreter and data logging task programs that were compiled to p-code.

In the summer of 1967, Brinch Hansen left Regnecentralen&#x27;s hardware group to become head of RC 4000 software development, where he led a team including Jørn Jensen, Peter Kraft and Søren Lauesen in defining a general-purpose RC 4000 multiprogramming system, with a goal to avoid developing a custom real-time control operating system for every RC 4000 installation, and to support batch processing and time-sharing as well. The resulting system was not a complete operating system, but a small kernel providing the mechanisms upon which operating systems for different purposes could be built. By the spring of 1969, a well-documented, reliable version of the RC 4000 multiprogramming system was running.

=== Carnegie Mellon University ===

In late 1970, Brinch Hansen moved to Pittsburgh, accepting an invitation from Alan Perlis to visit the department of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University as a research associate, while he wrote the first systematic textbook on operating system principles. During this time, at the 1971 Summer School in Marktoberdorf and a symposium in Belfast, Brinch Hansen, Tony Hoare and Dijkstra began to discuss ideas that evolved into the monitor concept. In the spring of 1972, after reading about the class concept invented by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard for Simula 67, Brinch Hansen completed his text with a chapter on resource protection that proposed the first monitor notation, using shared classes. In 1973, &quot;Operating System Principles&quot; was published, becoming the first comprehensive textbook on operating systems.

=== California Institute of Technology ===

In July 1972, Brinch Hansen joined the faculty of the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) as an Associate Professor of computer science, where he began work on defining a programming language with concurrent processes and monitors. In April 1974, he distributed a technical report on Concurrent Pascal. A Concurrent Pascal compiler for the PDP 11/45, written by Brinch Hansen&#x27;s doctoral student, Al Hartmann, was released in January 1975. Subsequently, Brinch Hansen began writing model operating systems in Concurrent Pascal, to evaluate the language. In May 1975, he completed Solo, a single-user operating system for development of Concurrent Pascal programs. Next, he rewrote the original RC 4000 real-time scheduler in Concurrent Pascal, taking three days to write it, and three hours of machine time to systematically test it.

When the Caltech computer science department shifted focus toward computer engineering and away from programming Brinch Hansen decided to leave, rather than to seek tenure there.

=== University of Southern California ===
In 1976, Brinch Hansen chose University of Southern California (USC) for his next post, so that his family could remain in their Altadena home. Joining the faculty as a tenured full professor, and first chair of a newly created computer science department, he led efforts to identify and attract top-notch faculty to build a first rate department. By 1980, USC&#x27;s computer science department was ranked by the National Research Council as one of the top ten in the US.

While at USC, Brinch Hansen wrote his second book, &quot;The Architecture of Concurrent Programs,&quot; based on his work developing operating systems with Concurrent Pascal. Published in 1977, it was the first book on concurrent programming. In 1978, Brinch Hansen became the first computer scientist awarded the Doctor Technices degree, the highest academic distinction within engineering and technological science in Denmark, for the work documented in &quot;The Architecture of Concurrent Programs&quot;. Later in 1978, Brinch Hansen published the Distributed Processes language concept, proposing the use of remote procedure calls to synchronize processes running across a microcomputer network.

Also in 1978, L. J. Sevins and Steve Goings from Mostek visited Brinch Hansen at USC, where he outlined a low-cost multiprocessor architecture. Mostek began a project to implement such a multiprocessor, with Brinch Hansen working as a consultant. Brinch Hansen developed a new concurrent programming language, Edison, for the project. As with the RC 4000 project, Edison was also used as a formal specification language for the hardware. Mostek got an initial 4-node multiprocessor working and Brinch Hansen wrote a portable Edison compiler on a PDP 11/55, but shortly after, United Technologies acquired Mostek and cancelled the project. In 1982, Brinch Hansen moved the Edison system to an IBM Personal Computer (PC), and then published his third book, &quot;Programming a Personal Computer&quot;.

In 1982, Brinch Hansen was named the first Henry Salvatori Professor of Computer Science at USC.

=== University of Copenhagen ===
In 1984, feeling homesick for Denmark after 14 years abroad, Brinch Hansen left USC and joined the faculty of the University of Copenhagen as a Professor of datalogy. In 1985, he was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Later in 1985, his fourth book &quot;Brinch Hansen on Pascal Compilers&quot;, which he used for his own compiler course, was published.

While designing a multicomputer operating system for Danish company GN Elmi, Brinch Hansen concluded he needed a new language, this time leveraging the message passing paradigm of Hoare&#x27;s CSP. The resulting language, Joyce, removed a major limitation of CSP by introducing parallel recursion. Brinch Hansen developed a portable implementation on an IBM PC.

=== Syracuse University ===

After finding that neither he nor his family felt at home in Denmark, Brinch Hansen decided to return to the US, but discovered that their immigration status required them to do so very quickly. Brinch Hansen contacted John Reynolds at Syracuse University and in 1987 he joined the faculty as a Distinguished Professor.

Working with his student Rangachari Anand, Joyce was moved to an Encore Multimax 320 multiprocessor at SU&#x27;s Northeast Parallel Architectures Center. Recognizing the scaling limitations of multiprocessors, however, Brinch Hansen sought a suitable multicomputer for further work. Acquiring a Meiko Computing Surface in 1989, he began experimenting with scientific applications by developing parallel programs for Householder&#x27;s method (reduction) and then &quot;N&quot;-body simulation as learning exercises, and was surprised to find that both programs had nearly identical control structures. Concluding that both fit an &quot;all-pairs paradigm,&quot; he then focused on exploring reusable parallel algorithm structures he termed &quot;programming paradigms&quot; or &quot;generic programs&quot; (later, popularly known as &quot;design patterns&quot;). In 1995, Brinch Hansen&#x27;s fifth book, &quot;Studies in Computational Science: Parallel Programming Paradigms&quot; was published, with programs rewritten in SuperPascal, a fully implemented publication language he created for parallel algorithms.

=== Last years ===
In his later years, Brinch Hansen published a retrospective of his most important papers, &quot;The Search for Simplicity&quot; (1996), a text for a course in programming for non-majors, &quot;Programming for Everyone in Java&quot; (1999), a retrospective on the evolution of operating systems, &quot;Classic Operating Systems: From Batch Processing to Distributed Systems&quot; (2001), and a retrospective on the evolution of concurrent programming, &quot;The Origin of Concurrent Programming: From Semaphores to Remote Procedure Calls&quot; (2002). He self-published a 2004 memoir, &quot;A Programmer&#x27;s Story: The Life of a Computer Pioneer&quot;, on his website.

In 2002, Brinch Hansen was awarded the IEEE Computer Pioneer Award &quot;For pioneering development in operating systems and concurrent programming exemplified by work on the RC 4000 multiprogramming system, monitors, and Concurrent Pascal.&quot;

On July 31, 2007, Brinch Hansen died, shortly after being diagnosed with terminal cancer.

== Personal life ==
Brinch Hansen met his wife Milena (née Hrastar) on a class trip to Yugoslavia in 1962. They married in 1965 and had two children, daughter Mette and son Thomas.

== Scientific contributions and influence ==
In a career spanning five decades, Brinch Hansen made seminal contributions in the areas of operating systems, concurrent computing and parallel and distributed computing that were influential in shaping the development of those fields and advancing them from ad hoc techniques to systematic engineering disciplines. The influence of his work was amplified by his &quot;relentless search for simplicity,&quot; his insistence on clarity, writing and rewriting his papers many times before publishing them, becoming &quot;one of the best explainers in the business,&quot; and his commitment to testing concepts in working systems – Brinch Hansen implemented and distributed working systems for new concepts he developed, noting:

=== Operating systems ===
The RC 4000 multiprogramming system introduced the now-standard concept of an operating system kernel and the separation of mechanism and policy in operating system design. Modern microkernel architectures trace their roots to the extensible nucleus architecture of the RC 4000. Improving microkernel performance was a major theme in operating system research for three decades after the RC 4000.

Brinch Hansen&#x27;s text, &quot;Operating System Principles&quot;, was the first comprehensive textbook on operating systems. Eventually published in six languages (English, Japanese, German, Czech, Polish and Serbo-Croatian), it remained in print for decades, and years after the RC 4000 system it described had become outdated. In 1990, nearly two decades after its initial publication, P. J. Plauger reviewed it, saying:

In 2005, Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) members voted &quot;Operating System Principles&quot; a top 25 classic book, in a survey to choose out-of-print classic books to add to the ACM Digital Library. &quot;Operating System Principles&quot; ranked 15th in the survey, appearing on 8.8% of ballots. It is now available from the ACM Digital Library.

Using Concurrent Pascal, Brinch Hansen demonstrated that it was feasible to fully implement operating systems in high level languages, and that doing so reduced the development effort by one to two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, entire operating systems could be published, and understood in their entirety. Brinch Hansen did precisely that in &quot;The Architecture of Concurrent Programs&quot;, leading Roy Maddux and Harlan Mills to declare:

=== Concurrent programming ===
Brinch Hansen and Hoare developed the monitor concept. Brinch Hansen published the first monitor notation, adopting the class concept of Simula 67, and invented a queueing mechanism. Hoare refined the rules of process resumption. Brinch Hansen created the first implementation of monitors, in Concurrent Pascal. More than a dozen additional monitor-based languages had been created by 1990: Simone, Modula, CSP/k, CCNPascal, PLY, Pascal Plus, Mesa, SB-Mod, Concurrent Euclid, Pascalc, Concurrent C, Emerald, Real-time Euclid, Pascal-FC, Turing Plus, Predula.

Concurrent Pascal was the first concurrent programming language: the first language developed specifically for concurrent programming, and more importantly, the first language to demonstrate that it was possible to incorporate secure, high-level facilities for concurrency, where the system could guarantee that processes access disjoint sets of variables only and do not interfere with each other in time dependent ways. Hoare described it as &quot;an outstanding example of the best of academic research in this area.&quot;

Source and portable code for Concurrent Pascal and the Solo operating system were distributed to at least 75 companies and 100 universities in 21 countries, resulting in its widespread adoption, porting and adaptation in both industry and academia. Greg Andrews observed that Concurrent Pascal and monitors &quot;greatly influenced most subsequent concurrent language proposals.&quot;

Brinch Hansen&#x27;s &quot;The Architecture of Concurrent Programs&quot; was the first book on concurrent programming, and was eventually published in three languages (English, Japanese, and German). More than a dozen years after its publication, P. J. Plauger observed:

In 2005, ACM members voted &quot;The Architecture of Concurrent Programs&quot; a top 25 classic book, ranking it 18th in the survey, and appearing on 8% of ballots. It is now available from the ACM Digital Library.

=== Distributed computing and remote procedure call ===
Remote procedure calls used in modern operating systems trace their roots back to the RC 4000 multiprogramming system, which used a request-response communication protocol for process synchronization.

In his 1978 paper on distributed processes, Brinch Hansen proposed a language for distributed computing based on external requests consisting of procedure calls between processes. This later became known in an operating system context as the remote procedure call.

Later, Brinch Hansen developed two languages extending Hoare&#x27;s CSP message-passing paradigm with parallel recursion, and showed how to efficiently implement such.

He later enrolled in the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, graduating in 1984.

==Career==
===Acting===
He changed his surname to Thewlis, his mother&#x27;s maiden name, after attempting to register with the actors&#x27; union and discovering that his birth name, David Wheeler, was already used by someone else. His first professional role after doing so was in the play &quot;Buddy Holly at the Regal&quot; in Greenwich and in a commercial for Kellogg&#x27;s Bran Flakes. In theatre, Thewlis has starred in Sam Mendes&#x27; &quot;The Sea&quot; at the Royal National Theatre, Max Stafford-Clark&#x27;s &quot;Ice Cream&quot; at the Royal Court Theatre, &quot;The Ruffian on the Stairs/The Woolley&quot; at Farnham, and &quot;The Lady and the Clarinet&quot; at the King&#x27;s Head Theatre.

He went on to play small roles in high-profile series such as BBC&#x27;s &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; in 1985 and &quot;The Singing Detective&quot; in 1986, before being offered a more significant part in Alan Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Road&quot; and in the ITV sitcom &quot;Valentine Park&quot; in 1987. That same year Thewlis made his film debut in &quot;Little Dorrit&quot;.

His first big-screen leading role was opposite Clive Owen in &quot;Vroom&quot;, directed by Beeban Kidron in 1988, and he starred in Paul Greengrass&#x27;s anti-Falkland War drama &quot;Resurrected&quot; in 1989, playing a presumed-dead soldier who returns to Britain. He collaborated with Mike Leigh on &quot;Life Is Sweet&quot; in 1990, in which he played Jane Horrocks&#x27; character&#x27;s lover. He continued playing low-key supporting roles in films such as &quot;Damage&quot; in 1992, directed by Louis Malle and &quot;The Trial&quot; in 1993 directed by David Hugh Jones.

Thewlis&#x27;s breakout role was 1993&#x27;s &quot;Naked&quot; directed by Mike Leigh, as the main character Johnny, a homeless, highly intelligent, embittered, rambling street philosopher, for which Thewlis was established as one of the great actors of his generation and named Best Actor by the National Society of Film Critics, the London Film Critics Circle, the Evening Standard, the New York Film Critics&#x27; Circle and the Cannes Film Festival. That same year, he appeared on television as a sexual predator named James Jackson in &quot;Prime Suspect 3&quot;, opposite Helen Mirren and Ciarán Hinds.

During the 1990s, Thewlis appeared in a variety of films, mostly fantasy and period, including &quot;Restoration&quot; (1995), &quot;Black Beauty&quot; (1994), &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; (1995) with Leonardo DiCaprio, &quot;The Island of Dr. Moreau&quot; (1996), &quot;Dragonheart&quot; (1996), and &quot;Seven Years in Tibet&quot; (1997), opposite Brad Pitt. He was nominated for a British Independent Film Award for &quot;Divorcing Jack&quot; (1998), and played Clov in a television film of Samuel Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Endgame&quot; (2000). Notable appearances include Bernardo Bertolucci&#x27;s &quot;Besieged&quot; (1998), the Coen brothers&#x27; &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; (1998), and Paul McGuigan&#x27;s &quot;Gangster No. 1&quot; (2000), opposite Paul Bettany and Malcolm McDowell.

He auditioned for the role of Quirinus Quirrell in the Chris Columbus directed film &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, but the part went to Ian Hart. Despite missing out on the first film, he was cast in 2004 as Professor Remus Lupin in &quot;Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban&quot;. He did not have to audition as he was director Alfonso Cuarón&#x27;s first choice for the role. Thewlis reprised the role in four other films in the series.

He appeared as an SS Commandant of a Nazi death camp and father of the main character in &quot;The Boy in the Striped Pyjamas&quot;, which was well received. Other credits include Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Kingdom of Heaven&quot; (2005), Terrence Malick&#x27;s &quot;The New World&quot; (2005), and &quot;The Omen&quot; (2006).

Thewlis played the Dr Michael Aris, husband of Aung San Suu Kyi, with Malaysian actress Michelle Yeoh as Suu Kyi, in the biopic &quot;The Lady&quot; directed by Luc Besson. In 2012, he received an International Festival of Independent Cinema Off Plus Camera Award. In the same year, he played in &quot;Separate We Come, Separate We Go&quot;, directed by Bonnie Wright.

In June 2015, Thewlis was reported to be filming scenes for a Donald Crowhurst biopic, &quot;The Mercy&quot;, on the beach at Teignmouth, Devon, playing Donald Crowhurst&#x27;s press agent, Rodney Hallworth, while Colin Firth would play Donald Crowhurst. He starred in &quot;Regression&quot;, a thriller released in autumn 2015. In September 2015, Thewlis starred as Inspector Goole in Helen Edmundson&#x27;s BBC TV adaptation of J. B. Priestley&#x27;s &quot;An Inspector Calls&quot;. In October 2015, he played King Duncan in the film &quot;Macbeth&quot;.

Thewlis portrayed Ares in &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; (2017), the DC Comics film featuring the character Wonder Woman. He briefly reprised his role as Ares in &quot;Justice League&quot; (2017). That same year, he appeared as V. M. Varga, the main antagonist of the third season of &quot;Fargo&quot;. His performance was critically acclaimed, and earned him nominations for the Primetime Emmy Award, Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award and Golden Globe Award as a supporting actor.

He has voiced the Shame Wizard in the Netflix animated sitcom &quot;Big Mouth&quot; (2017–present) and its spin-off &quot;Human Resources&quot; (2022–2023).

In 2023, he played Fagin in &quot;The Artful Dodger&quot; and in 2024, Hades in &quot;Kaos&quot;.

<text>Yoyodyne is a fictional company featured in Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novels, most prominently in &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, and humorously referenced in various other media.

== Background ==
Yoyodyne was first introduced as a fictional defense contractor in Pynchon&#x27;s debut novel &quot;V.&quot; (1963) and featured prominently in his novella &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot; (1966). Described in the latter book as &quot;a giant of the aerospace industry,&quot; Yoyodyne was founded by World War II veteran Clayton &quot;Bloody&quot; Chiclitz. The company has a large manufacturing plant in the fictional town of San Narciso, California. The name is reminiscent of several real high-tech companies, including the Gyrodyne Company of America, Teledyne and Teradyne, all of which were founded a few years before Pynchon wrote &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, and Rocketdyne, an aerospace company that manufactured, among other things, propulsion systems.

The name comes from &quot;yoyo&quot;, a repetitive motion, and &quot;dyne&quot;, a unit of force. According to Gyu Han Kang, it &quot;symbolizes the destructive force of sameness and artificially structured order&quot;.

Joseph W. Slade suggests that Yoyodyne was based on Pynchon&#x27;s time working for Boeing.

== Reception and analysis == 

Ralph Clare notes that Yoyodyne is typical of companies depicted by Pynchon that &quot;appear rather banal, represented not primarily by management and corporate hatchet men but by frustrated salaried employees in their natural cubicle-habitat&quot;. It is further noted that although &quot;there has been no physical violence perpetrated by Yoyodyne against its workers or the community&quot;, the company &quot;dispossesses people nonetheless&quot; through &quot;entitlement to its workers&#x27; patents&quot;, thereby turning the process of inventorship from one of creativity to another form of assembly-line drudgery. 

Demonstrating how Pynchon uses Yoyodyne as an example of stifling innovation, Cyrus Patell writes: &quot;The corporations that employ these inventors stress the value of &#x27;team-work,&#x27; but for [Stanley] Koteks &#x27;teamwork&#x27; is nothing but &#x27;a way to avoid responsibility ... a symptom of the gutlessness of the whole society&#x27;&quot; He also notes, &quot;Yoyodyne follows the prototypical evolutionary pattern of a business within a culture of corporate capitalism: begun by an individual entrepreneur, it soon grows into a large entrenched bureaucracy that is hostile to individual initiative and inventiveness&quot;.

Slade explains that the company is an example of a contradiction in values Pynchon presents in &quot;The Crying of Lot 49:&quot; &quot;Yoyodyne ... manufactures destructive high-tech weapons but markets them in classical capitalist fashion, as if they were ordinary industrial products&quot;.

== Legacy and influence ==
=== In fiction ===

Yoyodyne has frequently been referenced as an &quot;in-joke&quot; in other media. For example:

* The 1984 film &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension&quot; used the name Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems for a defense contractor whose corporate offices feature the sign, &quot;The future begins tomorrow&quot;. Yoyodyne is a front for a group of red Lectroid aliens, all with the first name John, that landed in Grovers Mill, New Jersey in 1938, using the panic created by Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; radio play as cover.
* Numerous references in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, such as control panels and dedication plaques, indicate that parts of Federation starships were manufactured by Yoyodyne Propulsion Systems or YPS. Often, these notices are too small to be visible on a television screen, or can only be observed by freeze-framing.
* Yoyodyne is a client of the law firm Wolfram &amp; Hart on the television series &quot;Angel&quot; at the beginning in the 9th episode of the 5th season titled &quot;Harm&#x27;s Way&quot;.
* The central bus station on the television series &quot;The John Larroquette Show&quot; was constructed by Yoyodyne.

=== In technical disciplines ===
In June 1991 version 2 of the open-source license GNU General Public License used the fictional company name &quot;Yoyodyne, Inc.&quot; as an example grantor of the license.

=== Real-world companies named Yoyodyne ===
Yoyodyne was an Internet-based direct marketer, founded by Seth Godin and later joined by Mark Hurst, and acquired by Yahoo! on October 12, 1998. Godin took the name from the company in &quot;The Adventures of Buckaroo Banzai Across the 8th Dimension&quot;.

A company named Yoyodyne LLC, based in Morristown, New Jersey, is a retailer of aftermarket motorcycle parts, including self-branded clutch accessories.

<text>Tiny was a British cyclecar manufactured by Nanson, Barker &amp; Co at Esholt, Yorkshire between 1912 and 1915.

The first car, the 8 hp, produced in 1912 was powered by an air-cooled JAP V-twin engine, three-speed gearbox and chain drive. Unlike many cyclecars a differential was fitted to the rear axle. The two-seater bodywork was in aluminium with a wheelbase of 96 inches (2440 mm) and the range included a van. Springing was half-elliptic springs front and rear and braking was by external bands on the rear wheels. The car cost about £100 and was claimed to be capable of 50 mph (80 km/h). It was exhibited at the 1912 London Motor Cycle show.

In 1913 the engine was replaced by a water-cooled Precision, V twin of 964 cc. There were other improvements including changing the brakes to internal expanding and replacing the chain with shaft drive. The price rose to £135.

Just before the outbreak of war, in mid-1914, came the final Tiny called the 10/15. This one was a proper light car and had a four-cylinder Dorman engine of 1177 cc. It cost £157.

It is uncertain how many Tinys were made but output was small.

After the First World War, the same company produced cars under Airedale brand.

<text>Shchi (, sometimes transliterated as šči) is a Russian-style cabbage soup. When sauerkraut is used instead, the soup is called sour shchi, while soups based on sorrel, spinach, nettle, and similar plants are called green shchi (). In the past, the term &quot;sour shchi&quot; was also used to refer to a drink, a variation of kvass, which was unrelated to the soup.

==History==
Shchi (from , the plural of &quot;съто&quot; (s(i)to) – &quot;something satisfying, feed&quot;) is a traditional soup of Russia. Cabbage soups have been known in Kievan Rus as far back as the 9th century, soon after cabbage was introduced from Byzantium. Its popularity in Russia originates from several factors:
* Shchi is relatively easy to prepare; 
* it can be cooked with or without various types of meat; 
* and it can be frozen in the winter and carried as a solid on a trip to be cut up when needed. 
As a result, by the 10th century shchi became a staple food of Russia, and a popular saying sprang from this fact: &quot;Щи да каша — пища наша.&quot; (&quot;Shchi da kasha — pishcha nasha&quot; &quot;Shchi and kasha are our food&quot;). 

=== Historical ingredients ===
The major components of shchi were originally cabbage, meat (beef, pork, lamb, or poultry), mushrooms, flour, and spices (based on onion and garlic). Cabbage and meat were cooked separately and smetana was added as a garnish before serving. Shchi is traditionally eaten with rye bread.
The ingredients of shchi gradually changed. Flour, which formerly was used to increase the soup&#x27;s caloric value, now was excluded for the sake of finer taste. The spice mixture was enriched with black pepper and bay leaf, which were imported to Russia around the 15th century, also from Byzantium. Meat was sometimes substituted with fish, due to reasons related to the Eastern Orthodox Church calendar-related fasting. As for the vegetables, carrot and parsley could be added to the shchi. Beef was the most popular meat for shchi in Russia, while pork was more common in Ukraine. The water-to-cabbage ratio varies and whereas early shchi was often so viscous that a spoon could stand in it, more diluted preparation was adopted later.

== Contemporary ingredients ==

Sometimes, tomato sauces (such as ketchup) are added to shchi (forming a tomato soup).

To mitigate accidental overspiceness, oversaltiness or general sourness of &quot;kvashenaya kapusta&quot; (e.g. sauerkraut), a portion of cooked pasta (rigatoni, penne or macaroni) can be added to the batch of shchi.

Tushonka can also be found in shchi in place of meat or fish.

On some occasions, &quot;caviar d&#x27;aubergine&quot; (a puree made of cooked eggplants) or &quot;courgette caviar&quot; (made of zucchinis), is added to shchi to improve the thickness of the resulting soup. Caviar (or roe in general, such as pollock roe), can be found in shchi as an artisan additive rather than a &quot;serious&quot; component of shchi.

==Linguistics==
The two-letter word щи contains the letter щ, which lacks a counterpart in most non-Cyrillic alphabets and is transcribed into them with several letters. In German, щи becomes eight letters, &quot;Schtschi&quot;. Devanagari script can render щи with only &quot;one&quot; glyph श्ची, albeit one that takes four keystrokes to type श ् च ी which combine to give श्ची.

<doc id="863791" wikidata="Q1051404" url="?curid=863791" title="Cauchy product">
<text>In mathematics, more specifically in mathematical analysis, the Cauchy product is the discrete convolution of two infinite series. It is named after the French mathematician Augustin-Louis Cauchy.

==Definitions==
The Cauchy product may apply to infinite series or power series. When people apply it to finite sequences or finite series, that can be seen merely as a particular case of a product of series with a finite number of non-zero coefficients (see discrete convolution).

Convergence issues are discussed in the next section.

===Cauchy product of two infinite series===

Let formula_1 and formula_2 be two infinite series with complex terms. The Cauchy product of these two infinite series is defined by a discrete convolution as follows:

:formula_3     where     formula_4.

===Cauchy product of two power series===

Consider the following two power series

:formula_5     and     formula_6

with complex coefficients formula_7 and formula_8. The Cauchy product of these two power series is defined by a discrete convolution as follows:

:formula_9     where     formula_4.

==Convergence and Mertens&#x27; theorem==
Let and be real or complex sequences. It was proved by Franz Mertens that, if the series formula_11 converges to and formula_12 converges to , and at least one of them converges absolutely, then their Cauchy product converges to . The theorem is still valid in a Banach algebra (see first line of the following proof).

It is not sufficient for both series to be convergent; if both sequences are conditionally convergent, the Cauchy product does not have to converge towards the product of the two series, as the following example shows:

===Example===
Consider the two alternating series with

formula_13

which are only conditionally convergent (the divergence of the series of the absolute values follows from the direct comparison test and the divergence of the harmonic series). The terms of their Cauchy product are given by

formula_14

for every integer . Since for every we have the inequalities and , it follows for the square root in the denominator that , hence, because there are summands,

formula_15

for every integer . Therefore, does not converge to zero as , hence the series of the diverges by the term test.

===Proof of Mertens&#x27; theorem===
For simplicity, we will prove it for complex numbers. However, the proof we are about to give is formally identical for an arbitrary Banach algebra (not even commutativity or associativity is required).

Assume without loss of generality that the series formula_11 converges absolutely.
Define the partial sums

formula_17

with

formula_18

Then

formula_19

by rearrangement, hence

Fix . Since formula_20 by absolute convergence, and since converges to as , there exists an integer such that, for all integers ,

(this is the only place where the absolute convergence is used). Since the series of the converges, the individual must converge to 0 by the term test. Hence there exists an integer such that, for all integers ,

Also, since converges to as , there exists an integer such that, for all integers ,

Then, for all integers , use the representation () for , split the sum in two parts, use the triangle inequality for the absolute value, and finally use the three estimates (), () and () to show that

formula_21

By the definition of convergence of a series, as required.

==Cesàro&#x27;s theorem==
In cases where the two sequences are convergent but not absolutely convergent, the Cauchy product is still Cesàro summable. Specifically:

If formula_22, formula_23 are real sequences with formula_24 and formula_25 then

formula_26

This can be generalised to the case where the two sequences are not convergent but just Cesàro summable:

===Theorem===
For formula_27 and formula_28, suppose the sequence formula_22 is formula_30 summable with sum &quot;A&quot; and formula_23 is formula_32 summable with sum &quot;B&quot;. Then their Cauchy product is formula_33 summable with sum &quot;AB&quot;.

==Examples==

* For some formula_34, let formula_35 and formula_36. Then formula_37 by definition and the binomial formula. Since, formally, formula_38 and formula_39, we have shown that formula_40. Since the limit of the Cauchy product of two absolutely convergent series is equal to the product of the limits of those series, we have proven the formula formula_41 for all formula_34.
* As a second example, let formula_43 for all formula_44. Then formula_45 for all formula_46 so the Cauchy product formula_47 does not converge.

==Generalizations==

All of the foregoing applies to sequences in formula_48 (complex numbers). The Cauchy product can be defined for series in the formula_49 spaces (Euclidean spaces) where multiplication is the inner product. In this case, we have the result that if two series converge absolutely then their Cauchy product converges absolutely to the inner product of the limits.

=== Products of finitely many infinite series ===
Let formula_46 such that formula_51 (actually the following is also true for formula_52 but the statement becomes trivial in that case) and let formula_53 be infinite series with complex coefficients, from which all except the formula_54th one converge absolutely, and the formula_54th one converges. Then the limit
formula_56
exists and we have:
formula_57
=== Proof ===
Because
formula_58
the statement can be proven by induction over formula_54: The case for formula_60 is identical to the claim about the Cauchy product. This is our induction base.

The induction step goes as follows: Let the claim be true for an formula_46 such that formula_51, and let formula_63 be infinite series with complex coefficients, from which all except the formula_64th one converge absolutely, and the formula_64-th one converges. We first apply the induction hypothesis to the series formula_66. We obtain that the series
formula_67
converges, and hence, by the triangle inequality and the sandwich criterion, the series
formula_68
converges, and hence the series
formula_69
converges absolutely. Therefore, by the induction hypothesis, by what Mertens proved, and by renaming of variables, we have:
formula_70
Therefore, the formula also holds for formula_64.

== Relation to convolution of functions ==
A finite sequence can be viewed as an infinite sequence with only finitely many nonzero terms, or in other words as a function formula_72 with finite support. For any complex-valued functions &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot; on formula_73 with finite support, one can take their convolution:
formula_74
Then formula_75 is the same thing as the Cauchy product of formula_76 and formula_77.

More generally, given a monoid &quot;S&quot;, one can form the semigroup algebra formula_78 of &quot;S&quot;, with the multiplication given by convolution. If one takes, for example, formula_79, then the multiplication on formula_78 is a generalization of the Cauchy product to higher dimension.
