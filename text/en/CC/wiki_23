<text>Anti-aging creams are predominantly moisturizer-based skin care products marketed with unproven claims of making the consumer look younger by reducing, masking or preventing signs of skin aging. Anti-aging supplements are ingestible products promoted to diminish the effects of aging, including vitamin supplements, powders, and teas.

== False health claims ==
In the United States, anti-aging products are commonly marketed with false health claims, and are deemed to be among various scams on consumers. Since 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued dozens of warning letters to manufacturers of skin care products with false marketing including supposed anti-aging effects about the benefits of such products, which are not authorized to be marketed as drugs that would require FDA approval to be safe and effective for treating the aging process. 

== Audience marketing ==
Social media marketing has been effective at getting children and teenagers to buy anti-aging skin care products.

Traditionally, anti-aging creams have been marketed towards women, but products specifically targeting men are common in the 21st century. Marketing of anti-aging products has been criticized as reinforcing ageism, particularly against women. Anti-aging promotions specifically reinforce the belief that older people should look like middle-aged people, and that old age comes with a loss of gender identity.

<text>Soyuz TM-12 was the 12th expedition to Mir, and included the first Briton in space, Helen Sharman.

==Crew==
==Mission highlights==

The Mir crew welcomed aboard Anatoli Artsebarski, Sergei Krikalev (on his second visit to the station), and British cosmonaut-researcher Helen Sharman, who was aboard as part of Project Juno, a cooperative venture partly sponsored by British private enterprise. Sharman&#x27;s experimental program, which was designed by the Soviets, leaned heavily toward life sciences, her speciality being chemistry. A bag of 250,000 pansy seeds was placed in the Kvant-2 EVA airlock, a compartment not as protected from cosmic radiation as other Mir compartments. 
Sharman also contacted nine British schools by radio and conducted high-temperature superconductor experiments with the Elektropograph-7K device. Sharman commented that she had difficulty finding equipment on Mir as there was a great deal more equipment than in the trainer in the cosmonaut city of Zvezdny Gorodok. Krikalev commented that, while Mir had more modules than it had the first time he lived on board, it did not seem less crowded, as it contained more equipment. Krikalev also noted that some of the materials making up the station&#x27;s exterior had faded and lost color, but that this had no impact on the station&#x27;s operation.

The spacecraft spent 144 days docked to Mir. While it was in orbit, the failed coup d&#x27;état against Mikhail Gorbachev in August 1991 rocked the Soviet Union, setting in motion events which led to the end of the Soviet Union on 26 December.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Out of the Present&quot;, a 1995 film documentary focused on cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev&#x27;s stay on Mir, features the arrival of Soyuz TM-12.

<text>Ludwig Mond FRS (7 March 1839 – 11 December 1909) was a German-born British chemist and industrialist. He discovered an important, previously unknown, class of compounds called metal carbonyls.

==Education and career==
Ludwig Mond was born into a Jewish family in Kassel, Germany. His parents were Meyer Bär (Moritz) Mond and Henrietta Levinsohn. After attending schools in his home town, he studied chemistry at the University of Marburg under Hermann Kolbe and at the University of Heidelberg under Robert Bunsen but he never gained a degree. He then worked in factories in Germany and the Netherlands before coming to England to work at the factory of John Hutchinson &amp; Co in Widnes in 1862. He worked in Utrecht for the firm of P. Smits &amp; de Wolf from 1864 to 1867 and then returned to Widnes. Here he formed a partnership with John Hutchinson and developed a method to recover sulphur from the by-products of the Leblanc process, which was used to manufacture soda ash.

In 1872 Mond got in touch with the Belgian industrialist Ernest Solvay who was developing a better process to manufacture soda ash, the ammonia-soda or Solvay process. The following year he went into partnership with the industrialist John Brunner to work on bringing the process to commercial viability. They established the business of Brunner Mond &amp; Company, building a factory at Winnington, Northwich. Mond solved some of the problems in the process that had made mass production difficult, and by 1880 he had turned it into a commercially sound process. Within 20 years the business had become the largest producer of soda ash in the world.

Mond continued to research new chemical processes. In 1890 he discovered nickel carbonyl, a previously unknown compound and the first-discovered in the class of metal carbonyls, which could be easily decomposed to produce pure nickel from its ores through the Mond process. He founded the Mond Nickel Company to exploit this, and thus was born the Victoria Mine of the Sudbury Basin. Ores from nickel mines in Canada were given preliminary enrichment there and then shipped to Mond&#x27;s works at Clydach, near Swansea, Wales for final purification.

He was one of the first industrialists of his time who offered his employees paid holidays and fringe-benefits.

==Honours and benefactions==
Mond supported scientific societies and, with Henry Roscoe, helped to expand the small Lancashire Chemical Society into the nationwide Society of Chemical Industry of which he was elected president in 1888. He was elected to the Royal Society in 1891. Abroad, he was elected to membership of the German Chemical Society, the Società Reale of Naples, and the . He received honorary doctorates from the universities of Padua, Heidelberg, Manchester and Oxford and was awarded the grand cordon of the Order of the Crown of Italy.

He was a benefactor to a number of scientific organisations including the Royal Society, the Italian Accademia dei Lincei and the Royal Institution of Great Britain. In his will he left bequests to the town of Kassel and to a number of Jewish charities. In his later years he had built up a collection of old master paintings and he left the greater proportion of these to the National Gallery, London. His wife left a large collection of materials relating to German literature to King&#x27;s College, London.

The Royal Society of Chemistry awards the Ludwig Mond Award in his honour. A statue of him, designed by Édouard Lantéri (1912), stands in front of the former Brunner Mond offices in Winnington, flanked by a statue of Brunner. Another statue of Mond is sited across from the Mond Nickel Works in Clydach, Wales, and is a Grade II listed structure 

==Family and personal==

In October 1866 Mond married his cousin Frida Löwenthal (1847–1923) in her native town of Cologne. They soon moved to England and had two sons, Robert and Alfred, who was later known as the 1st Lord Melchett. In 1880 he took British nationality. While he was establishing his business the family lived at Winnington and in 1884 they moved to London. From the early 1890s on, he spent most of his winters in Rome at his home there. This home, the Palazzo Zuccari, was first leased and then (1904) bought in the name of his wife&#x27;s friend Henriette Hertz, who developed it into a study centre for the history of art now called Bibliotheca Hertziana. He died in his London home, &#x27;The Poplars&#x27;, Avenue Road, near Regent&#x27;s Park. Although he had never practised any religion he was buried with Jewish rites at St Pancras cemetery where his sons erected a mausoleum. His estate was valued at £1 million.

<text>Eugene Jules Colan (; September 1, 1926 – June 23, 2011) was an American comic book artist best known for his work for Marvel Comics, where his signature titles include the superhero series &quot;Daredevil&quot;, the cult-hit satiric series &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;, and &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot;, considered one of comics&#x27; classic horror series. He co-created the Falcon, the first African-American superhero in mainstream comics; Carol Danvers, who would become Ms. Marvel and Captain Marvel; and the non-costumed, supernatural vampire hunter Blade.

Colan was inducted into the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 2005.

==Early life==
Eugene Jules Colan was born September 1, 1926, to Harold Colan, an insurance salesman, and Winifred Levy Colan, an antique dealer, in The Bronx, New York City. His parents ran an antiques business on the Upper East Side. His family was Jewish, and the family&#x27;s surname had originally been &quot;Cohen&quot;. Colan began drawing at age three. &quot;The first thing I ever drew was a lion. I must&#x27;ve absolutely copied it or something. But that&#x27;s what my folks tell me. And from then on, I just drew everything in sight. My grandfather was my favorite subject&quot;. Among his earliest influences, he said in 2001, were the Coulton Waugh adventure comic strip &quot;Dickie Dare&quot; &quot;in &quot;The New York Sun&quot;. I was influenced by the style, or the story. Mostly the story. I took it very seriously.&quot; He moved with his family &quot;at about age 4&quot; to Long Beach, New York, on Long Island. Later, he would try to copy artist Norman Rockwell&#x27;s covers to &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;. Other major art influences were comics artists Syd Shores and Milton Caniff. Colan attended George Washington High School in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, and went on to study at the Art Students League of New York.

==Career==

===Early career===

Colan began working in comics in 1944, doing illustrations for publisher Fiction House&#x27;s aviation-adventure series &quot;Wings Comics&quot;. &quot;[J]ust a summertime job before I went into the service&quot;, it gave Colan his first published work, the one-page &quot;Wing Tips&quot; non-fiction filler &quot;P-51B Mustang&quot; (issue #52, Dec. 1944). His first comics story was a seven-page &quot;Clipper Kirk&quot; feature in the following month&#x27;s issue.

After attempting to enlist in the U.S. Marine Corps during World War II but being pulled out by his father &quot;because I was underage&quot;, Colan at &quot;18 or 19&quot; enlisted in the Army Air Corps. Originally scheduled for gunnery school in Boulder, Colorado, plans changed with the war&#x27;s sudden end. &quot;I was going to be an aerial gunner. A bomber. But it never materialized&quot;, he recalled in 2001. After training at an Army camp near Biloxi, Mississippi, he joined the U.S. forces in the Philippines. There Colan rose to the rank of corporal, drew for the &quot;Manila Times&quot;, and won an art contest.

Upon his return to civilian life in 1946, Colan went to work for Marvel Comics&#x27; 1940s precursor, Timely Comics. He recalled in 2000,

Comics historian Michael J. Vassallo identifies that first story as &quot;Adam and Eve — Crime Incorporated&quot; in &quot;Lawbreakers Always Lose&quot; #1 (cover date Spring 1948), on which is written the internal job number 2401. He notes another story, &quot;The Cop They Couldn&#x27;t Stop&quot; in &quot;All-True Crime&quot; #27 (April 1948), job number 2505, may have been published first, citing the differing cover-date nomenclature (&quot;Spring&quot; v. &quot;April&quot;) for the uncertainty.

Hired as &quot;a staff penciler&quot;, Colan &quot;started out at about $60 a week. ... Syd Shores was the art director&quot;. Due to Colan&#x27;s work going uncredited, in the manner of the times, comprehensive credits for this era are difficult if not impossible to ascertain. In 2010, he recalled his first cover art being for an issue of &quot;Captain America Comics&quot;; Colan drew the 12-page lead story in issue #72, the cover-artist of which is undetermined. He definitively drew the cover of the final issue, the horror comic &quot;Captain America&#x27;s Weird Tales&quot; #75 (Feb. 1950), which did not include the titular superhero on either the cover or inside.

After virtually all the Timely staff was let go in 1948 during an industry downturn, Colan began freelancing for National Comics, the future DC Comics. A stickler for accuracy, he meticulously researched his countless war stories for DC&#x27;s &quot;All-American Men at War&quot;, &quot;Captain Storm&quot;, and &quot;Our Army at War&quot;, as well as for Marvel&#x27;s 1950s forerunner Atlas Comics, on the series &quot;Battle&quot;, &quot;Battle Action&quot;, &quot;Battle Ground&quot;, &quot;Battlefront&quot;, &quot;G.I. Tales&quot;, &quot;Marines in Battle&quot;, &quot;Navy Combat&quot; and &quot;Navy Tales&quot;. Colan&#x27;s earliest confirmed credit during this time is penciling and inking the six-page crime fiction story &quot;Dream Of Doom&quot;, by an uncredited writer, in Atlas&#x27; &quot;Lawbreakers Always Lose&quot; #6 (Feb. 1949).

By the early 1950s, he was living in New Rochelle, New York. Around this time he did his first work for DC Comics, then the industry leader, on the licensed series &quot;Hopalong Cassidy&quot;, based on the film and TV Western hero, drawing it from 1954 to 1957. In the 1960s, he lived in New Jersey, where his and Adrienne&#x27;s children, Erik and Nanci, were raised.
===Silver Age===
While freelancing for DC romance comics in the 1960s, Colan did his first superhero work for Marvel under the pseudonym Adam Austin. Taking to the form immediately, he introduced the &quot;Sub-Mariner&quot; feature in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;, and succeeded Don Heck on &quot;Iron Man&quot; in &quot;Tales of Suspense&quot;.

Sometime after Colan began this pseudonymous stint, Marvel editor Stan Lee made overtures to lure him from DC. Colan recalled,

Under his own name, Colan became one of the premier Silver Age Marvel artists, illustrating a host of such major characters as Captain America, Doctor Strange (both in the late-1960s and the mid-1970s series), and his signature character, Daredevil. Operating, like other company artists, on the &quot;Marvel Method&quot; — in which editor-in-chief and primary writer Stan Lee &quot;would just speak to me for a few minutes on the phone, tell me the beginning, the middle and the end [of a story] and not much else, maybe four or five paragraphs, and then he&#x27;d tell me to make [a 20-page] story out of it,&quot; providing artwork to which Lee would then script dialogue and captions — Colan forged his own style, different from that of artists Jack Kirby and Steve Ditko, whom Lee would point to as examples of the Marvel style:

Lee and Colan introduced the Emissaries of Evil in &quot;Daredevil Annual&quot; #1 (1967) and the Jester in &quot;Daredevil&quot; #42 (July 1968). Colan&#x27;s long run on the &quot;Daredevil&quot; series encompassed all but three issues in an otherwise unbroken, 81-issue string from #20-100 (Sept. 1966 - June 1973), plus the initial &quot;Daredevil Annual&quot; (1967). He returned to draw ten issues sprinkled from 1974 to 1979, and an eight-issue run in 1997. Colan admitted relying upon amphetamines in order to make deadlines for illustrating the series &quot;Doctor Strange&quot;, for which he would personally visit the character&#x27;s real-life Manhattan neighborhood, Greenwich Village, and shoot Polaroid photographs to use as location reference. Captain Marvel, a character created to secure the trademark on the name, debuted in &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; #12 (Dec. 1967) by Lee and Colan. The original Guardians of the Galaxy first appeared in &quot;Marvel Super-Heroes&quot; #18 (Jan. 1969) by writer Arnold Drake and Colan.

In &quot;Captain America&quot; #117 (Sept. 1969), Colan and writer-editor Stan Lee created the Falcon, the first African-American superhero in mainstream comic books. The character came about, Colan recalled in 2008,
Concurrent with his move to Marvel, Colan also contributed several stories to Warren Publishing&#x27;s line of black-and-white horror comics magazines, beginning with the six-page tale &quot;To Pay the Piper&quot;, by writer Larry Ivie, in &quot;Eerie&quot; #2 (March 1966). There and in subsequent stories for that magazine and its sister publication, &quot;Creepy&quot;, Colan would ink his own pencil work. His final original Warren story, &quot;First Blood&quot;, appeared in &quot;Eerie&quot; #11 (Sept. 1967). The vast majority of these were written by Warren editor Archie Goodwin, with whom Colan would later collaborate on Marvel&#x27;s Iron Man.

===Dracula and Batman===
Colan in the 1970s illustrated the complete 70-issue run of the acclaimed horror title &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; as well as most issues of writer Steve Gerber&#x27;s cult hit &quot;Howard the Duck&quot;.

Colan, already one of Marvel&#x27;s most well-established and prominent artists, said he had lobbied for the &quot;Tomb of Dracula&quot; assignment:

Colan and Marv Wolfman created several supporting characters for the &quot;Dracula&quot; series. They introduced Blade in &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; #10 (July 1973) and Lilith in &quot;Giant-Size Chillers&quot; #1 (June 1974). Colan became the artist of &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; volume 2 with issue #6 (Feb. 1975) which introduced the Gaea character. A crossover between the two Colan-drawn series occurred in May 1976. In 2010, &quot;Comics Bulletin&quot; ranked Colan&#x27;s run on &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; fifth on its list of the &quot;Top 10 1970s Marvels&quot;. His work on &quot;Doctor Strange&quot; was ranked ninth on the same list. Colan&#x27;s collaboration with Steve Gerber on the &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; series saw the title character nominated by the &quot;All-Night Party&quot;, a fictional political party, as their nominee in the Presidential campaign of 1976, and led to Howard the Duck receiving thousands of write-in votes in the actual election. The Gerber-Colan team created Doctor Bong in &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; #15 (Aug. 1977). Gerber later said to Colan: &quot;There really was almost a telepathic connection there. I would see something in my mind, and that is what you would draw! I&#x27;ve never had that experience with another artist before or since.&quot;

Colan returned to DC in 1981, following a professional falling out with Marvel editor-in-chief Jim Shooter. Colan recalled two decades later that Shooter

He brought his shadowy, moody textures to Batman, serving as the character&#x27;s primary artist from 1981 to 1986, penciling most issues of &quot;Detective Comics&quot; and &quot;Batman&quot; during this time. His debut issue of the character&#x27;s eponymous series was #340 (Oct. 1981). With writer Gerry Conway, Colan revived the Golden Age supervillains Doctor Death in &quot;Batman&quot; #345 (March 1982) and the Monk in &quot;Batman&quot; #350 (Aug. 1982) and introduced Killer Croc in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #523 (Feb. 1983). Killer Croc appears in the 2016 live-action movie &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, portrayed by Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje. Another new character, Nightslayer, was created by Colan and Doug Moench in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #529 (Aug. 1983).

In the insert preview in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #41 (Jan. 1982), writer Roy Thomas and Colan provided Wonder Woman with a stylized &quot;WW&quot; emblem on her bodice, replacing the traditional eagle. The &quot;WW&quot; emblem, unlike the eagle, could be protected as a trademark and therefore had greater merchandising potential. &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #288 (February 1982) premiered the new costume and an altered cover banner incorporating the &quot;WW&quot; emblem. Colan was one of several artists on &quot;Wonder Woman&quot; #300 (Feb. 1983) and stayed on the series until issue #305 wherein he and writer Dan Mishkin reintroduced the character Circe to the rogues gallery of Wonder Woman&#x27;s adversaries. Steve Gerber and Colan reunited at DC to produce &quot;The Phantom Zone&quot; limited series. Helping to create new characters as well, Colan collaborated in the 1980s with &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; writer Marv Wolfman on the 14-issue run of &quot;Night Force&quot; featuring characters introduced in an insert preview in &quot;The New Teen Titans&quot; #21 (July 1982). He was one of the contributors to the &quot;DC Challenge&quot; limited series in 1985. Additionally, Colan worked with Cary Bates on the 12-issue run of &quot;Silverblade&quot;; with Greg Potter on the 12-issue run of &quot;Jemm, Son of Saturn&quot;; and drew the first six issues of Doug Moench&#x27;s 1987 revival of &quot;The Spectre&quot;.

Colan&#x27;s style, characterized by fluid figure drawing and extensive use of shadow, was unusual among Silver Age comic artists, and became more pronounced as his career progressed. He usually worked as a penciller, with Frank Giacoia and Tom Palmer as his most frequent inkers. Colan broke from the mass-market comic book penciller/inker/colorist assembly-line system by creating finished drawings in graphite and watercolor on such projects as the DC Comics miniseries &quot;Nathaniel Dusk&quot; (1984) and &quot;Nathaniel Dusk II&quot; (1985–86), and the feature &quot;Ragamuffins&quot; in the Eclipse Comics umbrella series &quot;Eclipse&quot; #3, 5, and 8 (1981–83), with frequent collaborator Don McGregor.

Independent-comics work includes the Eclipse graphic novel &quot;Detectives Inc.: A Terror Of Dying Dreams&quot; (1985), written by McGregor and reprinted in sepia tone as an Eclipse miniseries in 1987, and the miniseries &quot;Predator: Hell &amp; Hot Water&quot; for Dark Horse Comics. He contributed to Archie Comics in the late 1980s and early 1990s, drawing and occasionally writing a number of stories. His work there included penciling the lighthearted science-fiction series &quot;Jughead&#x27;s Time Police&quot; #1-6 (July 1990–May 1991), and the 1990 one-shot &quot;To Riverdale and Back Again&quot;, an adaptation of the NBC TV movie about the Archie characters 20 years later, airing May 6, 1990; Stan Goldberg drew the parts featuring the characters in flashback as teens, while Colan drew adult characters, in a less cartoony style, and Mike Esposito inking both.

Back at Marvel, he collaborated again with Marv Wolfman and veteran inker Al Williamson on a new &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot; series, and with Don McGregor on a Black Panther serial in the &quot;Marvel Comics Presents&quot; anthology, as well as a six-issue adaptation of Clive Barker&#x27;s &quot;The Harrowers: Raiders of the Abyss.&quot;

===Later life and career===
Colan did some insert artwork on &quot;Hellbilly Deluxe&quot; (released August 1998), the first solo album of Rob Zombie, credited as Gene &quot;The Mean Machine&quot; Colan. Unrealized projects around this time included the Marvel Music comic &quot;Elvis: Mystery Train&quot;, which went on hold, he said in 1996, &quot;when Marvel ran into problems, so everything came to a halt. Right now it&#x27;s in limbo. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan&#x27;s son is writing it ...&quot;

In 1998, Colan and his &quot;Tomb of Dracula&quot; writing collaborator, Marv Wolfman, reteamed on Dark Horse Comics three-issue miniseries &quot;The Curse of Dracula&quot; (July-Sept. 1998). Saying the book required &quot;a much younger and better-looking Dracula&quot; than in their previous series, Colan used &quot;my lawn-boy [as] my model. ... I asked him to do the posing and he did.&quot; For the same company early the next decade, Colan returned to vampires with the 2001 one-shot &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Tales of the Slayers&quot;, an omnibus that included writer Doug Petrie&#x27;s 16-page &quot;Nikki Goes Down&quot;, starring a 1970s vampire slayer seen in one episode of the namesake TV series.

Colan penciled the final pages of &quot;Blade&quot; vol. 3, #12 (Oct. 2007), the final issue of that series, drawing a flashback scene in which the character dresses in his original outfit from the 1970s series &quot;The Tomb of Dracula&quot;. That same month, for the anniversary issue &quot;Daredevil&quot; vol. 2, #100 (Oct. 2007), Colan penciled pages 18–20 of the 36-page story &quot;Without Fear, Part One&quot;; the issue additionally reprinted the Colan-drawn &quot;Daredevil&quot; #90-91 (Aug.-Sept. 1972).

In the late 1980s, Colan, in addition to his art, taught at Manhattan&#x27;s School of Visual Arts and Fashion Institute of Technology, and had showings at the Bess Cutler Gallery in New York City and at the Elm Street Arts Gallery in Manchester, Vermont. He had relocated to nearby Manchester Center, Vermont, from New York City in 1990 or 1991, and was living there as of 2001. By 2009 at the latest, they had returned to New York City, settling in Brooklyn.

On May 11, 2008, his family announced that Colan, who had been hospitalized for liver failure, had suffered a sharp deterioration in his health. By December, he had sufficiently recovered to travel to an in-store signing in California. He continued to produce original comics work as late as 2009, drawing the 40-page &quot;Captain America&quot; #601 (Sept. 2009), for which he won an Eisner Award.

==Personal life==
Gene Colan was married twice: first to Sallee Greenberg, with whom he had children Valerie and Jill before the couple divorced, and Adrienne Brickman, with whom he had children Erik and Nanci. Adrienne Colan died on June 21, 2010.

Colan died in the Bronx on June 23, 2011, aged 84, following complications of cancer and liver disease. He lived in Brooklyn at the time of his death.

==Awards and honors==
Colan&#x27;s collaboration with Steve Gerber on &quot;Howard the Duck&quot; received the 1977 and 1978 Eagle Award for Favorite Comic Book (Humor) and was nominated for four Eagle Awards in 1978. Colan received an Inkpot Award in 1978 as well.

In 2005, Colan was inducted into the comics industry&#x27;s Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame. He subsequently won the 2010 Eisner Award for Best Single Issue (together with writer Ed Brubaker) for his work on &quot;Captain America&quot; #601 (Sept. 2009).

The Cartoon Art Museum in San Francisco presented the retrospective &quot;Colan: Visions of a Man without Fear&quot; from November 15, 2008, to March 15, 2009.

Colan was the recipient of the 2008 Sparky Award, presented December 4, 2008 and won the Comic Art Professional Society&#x27;s Sergio Award on October 24, 2009.

<text>The Societé d&#x27;Application Electro-Mécanique was a French electric car manufacturer based in Neuilly, near Paris.

In 1923, the company manufactured a few cyclecars under the brand name Electrocyclette.

Between 1924 and 1927 the company went on to build mainly delivery vans, whose top speed was 25/30 km/h (around 15-19 mph), with a range of about 80–100 km (50–60 miles). The batteries were under the seats and the motor was under a short bonnet driving the front wheels.

<text>Library and Archives Canada (LAC; ) is the federal institution tasked with acquiring, preserving, and providing accessibility to the documentary heritage of Canada. The national archive and library is the 16th largest library in the world. The LAC reports to the Parliament of Canada through the Minister of Canadian Heritage.

LAC traces its origins to the Dominion Archives, formed in 1872, and the National Library of Canada, formed in 1953. The former was later renamed as the Public Archives of Canada in 1912, and the National Archives of Canada in 1987. In 2004, the National Archives of Canada and the National Library of Canada were merged to form Library and Archives Canada.

==History==
===Predecessors===

The Dominion Archives was founded in 1872 as a division within the Department of Agriculture tasked with acquiring and transcribing documents related to Canadian history. In 1912, the division was transformed into an autonomous organization, Public Archives of Canada, with the new responsibility of managing government documents on all types of media. The organization would be renamed in 1987 as the National Archives of Canada.

With the efforts of people like Freda Farrell Waldon, the first president of the Canadian Library Association, the National Library of Canada was founded in 1953.

===21st century===
In 2004, under the initiative of former National Librarian Roch Carrier and National Archivist Ian E. Wilson, the functions of the National Archives of Canada and the National Library of Canada were combined to form Library and Archives Canada. LAC was established per the &quot;Library and Archives of Canada Act&quot; (Bill C-8), proclaimed on April 22, 2004, with a subsequent Order-in-Council on May 21, which formally united the collections, services, and personnel of the National Archives of Canada and the National Library of Canada. Wilson assumed the position as the first Librarian and Archivist of Canada in July that year.

====Modernization====
In June 2004, LAC issued a discussion paper titled &quot;Creating a New Kind of Knowledge Institution&quot;; after consultation in June 2006, it issued &quot;LAC Directions for Change&quot;, a document setting out five key directions to define the new institution, including being a new kind of knowledge institution; becoming a truly national institution, a collaborative institution that works to stregnthen Canada&#x27;s documentary heritage; a learning destsination; and an institution in government information management.

LAC&#x27;s modernization policy provides for transformation from an institution focused on the acquisition and preservation of analogue (non-digital) materials to one that excels in digital access and digital preservation. A Documentary Heritage Management Framework developed in 2009 seeks the right balance between resources dedicated to analogue and digital materials and is based on:
*three main business pillars: acquisition, preservation and resource discovery (&quot;resource discovery&quot; includes description, discovery, access and services to the public)
*four guiding principles for fulfilling its documentary heritage mandate, i.e. significance, sufficiency, sustainability and society (broad social context)
*four key roles, i.e. foundation building (relationship building), collaboration, program (integrated collection management processes) and transfer (formal agreements with third parties to fulfill its legislated mandate).
Eight pilot research projects were initiated to validate the framework, including projects on military documentary heritage, aboriginal documentary heritage, and stewardship of newspapers in a digital age. In March 2010 LAC issued its final report on Canadian Digital Information Strategy stakeholder consultations initiated in accordance with its mandate to facilitate co-operation among Canadian knowledge communities. In the same month it issued &quot;Shaping Our Continuing Memory Collectively: A Representative Documentary Heritage&quot;, a document which outlines how it plans to achieve its modernization objectives.

Despite LAC&#x27;s stated objectives of continuing to fulfill its mandate by adapting to changes in the information environment and collaboration with others, the actual experience since 2004 has been a reduction in both services and collaboration. Federal funding cuts since 2004 have also impacted on LAC services and acquisitions. A detailed timeline of relevant developments and the decline in LAC services since 2004 has been compiled by the Ex Libris Association.

====Budget cuts====
Following the announcement in the 2012 federal budget of a CDN$9.6 million funding cut over the three years commencing in 2012–13, more than 400 LAC employees received notices which indicated their jobs may be affected and the department announced a 20% reduction of its workforce of about 1,100 over the following three years. The &quot;harsh&quot; wording of a 23-page code of conduct for employees effective January 2013, which &quot;spells out values, potential conflicts of interest and expected behaviours&quot;, has been criticized by the Association of Canadian Archivists and the Canadian Association of University Teachers among others. The code describes personal activities including teaching and speaking at or attending conferences as &quot;high risk&quot; activities &quot;with regard to conflict of interest, conflict of duties and duty of loyalty&quot; and participation in such activities is subject to strict conditions. In a section on duty of loyalty, it also cautions employees about expressing personal opinions in social media forums. Only authorized LAC spokespersons may issue statements or make public comments about LAC&#x27;s mandate and activities, which includes controversial changes related to modernization and budget cuts.

Changes introduced under the management of Ian E. Wilson and Daniel J. Caron have been the subject of controversy and public criticism. Caron asserted that radical change is needed to cope with the influx and demand for digital material and they are subject to federal budget constraints.

Several individuals and organizations voiced concerns about these changes. In 2011, the Canadian Association of University Teachers launched the Save Library &amp; Archives Canada campaign. On May 2, 2012, the Canadian Library Association expressed concern about budget cuts to libraries, both in federal departments and at LAC. In August 2012, the Bibliographical Society of Canada wrote to every Member of Parliament urging them to ensure budget cuts do not compromise LAC&#x27;s legislated mandate. In a follow-up letter to Heritage Minister James Moore in November 2012, the Society singled out the termination of interlibrary loans as a particularly harmful decision. Bibliophile blogger Nigel Beale characterizes LAC as &quot;Canada&#x27;s national disgrace&quot; in his blog &quot;Literary Tourist&quot;. Academic Ian Milligan describes LAC&#x27;s &quot;rhetoric of modernization&quot; as a &quot;smokescreen&quot; for cutting services in light of the insignificance of and limited accessibility to LAC&#x27;s online collections on the ActiveHistory.ca website. Historian Valerie Knowles outlines the impact of government cutbacks at LAC and federal government libraries in her article &quot;Closing doors on Canada&#x27;s history&quot; on the &quot;iPolitics&quot; website.

On May 31, 2012, the Association of Canadian Archivists announced its withdrawal from forums of LAC&#x27;s Pan-Canadian Documentary Heritage Network, stating that it does not believe the network can meet the needs and interests of archives across Canada previously met by the National Archival Development Program abruptly terminated by LAC following the 2012 federal funding cut.

Following Caron&#x27;s resignation in May 2013, a stakeholder coalition issued a joint statement on the qualities of a successful Librarian and Archivist of Canada for official consideration in what they consider a &quot;matter of great national significance&quot;: 

In June 2013 the Heritage Minister said speeding up the digitization of records will be a priority for the new Librarian and Archivist of Canada. Moore also said he will ask the person appointed to revisit the termination of the National Archival Development Program.

==== Truth and Reconciliation Commission ====
During the Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission, Library and Archives Canada initially failed to produce records requested by the commission in a timely and comprehensive manner and was ordered by an Ontario Superior Court judge to do so. Ultimately, LAC did provide the records, but many were not in digitized and searchable formats as required by the commission.

The Calls to Action of the final report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission explicitly referenced Library and Archives Canada as follows:We call upon Library and Archives Canada to: fully adopt and implement the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the United Nations Joinet-Orentlicher principles, as related to Aboriginal peoples&#x27; inalienable right to know the truth about what happened and why, with regard to human rights violations committed against them in the residential schools; ensure that its record holding related to residential schools are accessible to the public; [and] commit more resources to its public education materials and programming on residential schools.Library and Archives Canada has begun to address these concerns by dedicating funding to hire Indigenous archivists, build relationships with Indigenous communities, and support digitization efforts. However, Indigenous-led organizations have drawn attention to the fact that Indigenous communities have been conducting this type of work for decades.

LAC also holds and provides access to archival copies of the websites of organizations related to the TRC, in collaboration with the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation, the University of Winnipeg Library, and University of Manitoba Libraries.

==Facilities==

The building at 395 Wellington Street in downtown Ottawa is the main physical location where the public may access the collection in person. The building was officially opened on June 20, 1967. With the de-emphasis on physical visits, in-person services have been curtailed—for example, since April 2012, reference services are by appointment only—and the role of this building is decreasing. There are also administrative offices in Gatineau, Quebec, and preservation and storage facilities throughout Canada for federal government records.

The Preservation Centre in the city centre of Gatineau, about 10 kilometres away from the Ottawa headquarters, was designed to provide a safe environment for the long-term storage and preservation of Canada&#x27;s valuable collections. It was built at a cost of CDN$107 million, and the official opening took place on June 4, 1997. It is a unique building containing 48 climate-controlled preservation vaults and state-of-the-art preservation laboratories. In 2000, the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada named it one of the top 500 buildings constructed in Canada during the last millennium.

A Nitrate Film Preservation Facility on the Communications Research Centre campus in Shirleys Bay, on the outskirts of Ottawa, houses Canada&#x27;s cellulose nitrate film collection. The collection contains 5,575 film reels dating back to 1912, including some of the first Canadian motion pictures and photographic negatives. The film material is highly sensitive and requires precise temperatures for its preservation. The state-of-the-art facility, which was officially opened on June 21, 2011, is an eco-designed building featuring an environmentally friendly roof that provides better insulation and minimizes energy expenditures.

A planned key activity for 2013–14 was to rehouse analogue (non-digital) information resources in a new state-of-the-art high-density storage facility in Gatineau, where the national newspaper collection and records of Second World War veterans will be stored. The facility will feature a high bay metal shelving system with a suitable environment to better protect Canada&#x27;s published heritage. In January 2019, Library and Archives Canada announced that negotiations for a new facility to be built next to the existing one in Gatineau were starting, with an opening date in 2022.

LAC&#x27;s online collection is accessible via its website and LAC provides ongoing information online via its blog, podcasts, the Twitter and Facebook social networking services, the Flickr image-sharing site, and the YouTube video-sharing site. RSS feeds provide links to new content on the LAC website and news about LAC services and resources. A new modernized website is being developed and is scheduled for completion in 2013, with both new and old websites accessible during the transition period.

==Collection==

The Library and Archives of Canada&#x27;s holdings include:

* 250 linear kilometres of Canadian Government and representative private textual records
** textual archives for various individuals and groups who have contributed to the cultural, social, economic and political development of Canada
* 22 million books and publications acquired largely through legal deposit
* 24 million photographic images (including prints, negatives, slides, and digital photos)
* over 3 million architectural drawings, plans, and maps
* over 90,000 films (including short and full-length films, documentaries, and silent films)
* over 550,000 hours of audio and video recordings
* over 425,000 works of art (including watercolours, oil paintings, sketches, caricatures and miniatures, as well as medals, seals, posters and coats of arms)
* about 550,000 musical items (including the largest collection of Canadian sheet music in the world; documentation related to music in Canada; and recordings on disks and records of all formats, including piano rolls, reels and spools, and 8-track tapes)
* the Canadian Postal Archives;
* national newspapers from across Canada, including daily newspapers, student newspapers, Indigenous magazines, and ethnic community newsletters.

Notable items in the collection include:
*the Proclamation of Canada&#x27;s &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, which bears marks left by raindrops during a ceremony on Parliament Hill in April 1982 when Queen Elizabeth II signed it;
*a copy of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; (aka the &quot;British North America Act&quot;), which features editing changes made by the first Prime Minister of Canada, Sir John A. Macdonald;
*&quot;De antiquitate Judaica: De bello Judaico&quot; (&#x27;Antiquities of the Jews and the Judean War&#x27;)—the oldest book in the collection—written by 1st-century historian Flavius Josephus and printed in 1470;
*the chair used by world-renowned pianist Glenn Gould while he played and recorded.

=== Digitization ===
LAC also houses more than a petabyte of digital content. Some of this content is available online, primarily books, Canadian theses, and census material—equating to around 5 thousand terabytes of information in electronic format. Many items have not been digitized and are only available in physical form. As of May 2013, only about 1% of the collection had been digitized, representing &quot;about 25 million of the more popular and most fragile items.&quot;

==Operations==
Since its inception, LAC has reported to Parliament through the Minister of Canadian Heritage. LAC&#x27;s stated mandate is:
*to preserve the documentary heritage of Canada for the benefit of present and future generations;
*to be a source of enduring knowledge accessible to all, contributing to the cultural, social and economic advancement of Canada as a free and democratic society;
*to facilitate in Canada co-operation among communities involved in the acquisition, preservation and diffusion of knowledge;
*to serve as the continuing memory of the Government of Canada and its institutions.

LAC is expected to maintain &quot;effective recordkeeping practices that ensure transparency and accountability&quot;.

===Management===
The Librarian and Archivist of Canada has the same seniority level as a deputy minister of a federal department.

On May 27, 2019, Leslie Weir was appointed Librarian and Archivist of Canada for a four-year term commencing August 30, 2019. Weir is the first woman to hold this role. Her term has been extended another four years to provide continuity through some major building projects.

The head of Canada&#x27;s national archives was known as the Dominion Archivist from 1872 to 1987 and the National Archivist from 1987 to 2004.

<text>Cerastes cerastes, commonly known as the Saharan horned viper or the desert horned viper, is a species of viper native to the deserts of Northern Africa and parts of the Arabian Peninsula and Levant. It is often easily recognized by the presence of a pair of supraocular &quot;horns&quot;, although hornless individuals do occur. Three subspecies have been described.

== Description ==
The average total length (body and tail) is , with a maximum total length of . Females are larger than males.

One of the most distinctive characteristics of this species is the presence of supraorbital &quot;horns&quot;, one over each eye. However, these may be reduced in size or absent (see genus &quot;Cerastes&quot;). The eyes are prominent and set on the sides of the head. There is significant sexual dimorphism, with males having larger heads and larger eyes than females. Compared to &quot;C. gasperettii&quot;, the relative head size of &quot;C. cerastes&quot; is larger and there is a greater frequency of horned individuals (13% versus 48%, respectively).

The colour pattern consists of a yellowish, pale grey, pinkish, reddish or pale brown ground colour, which almost always matches the substrate colour where the animal is found. Dorsally, a series of dark, semi-rectangular blotches runs the length of the body. These blotches may or may not be fused into crossbars. The belly is white. The tail, which may have a black tip, is usually thin.

== Common names ==
Common names of this species include desert sidewinding horned viper, Saharan horned viper, horned s, Sahara horned viper, desert horned viper, North African horned viper, African desert horned viper, greater cerastes, asp and horned viper. In Egypt, it is called &quot;el-ṭorîsha&quot; (); in Libya, it is called &quot;um-Goron&quot; ().

== Distribution and habitat ==
The snake is common in Iraq but is also found in Syria, Saudi Arabia, Palestine, Yemen, Jordan, Israel, Qatar, Mauritania, Morocco and Kuwait. They can also be found in parts of North Africa including Libya, Egypt, and Sudan.

Originally, the type locality was listed only as &quot;Oriente.&quot; However, Flower (1933) proposed &quot;Egypt&quot; by way of clarification.

These snakes favor dry, sandy areas with sparse rock outcroppings, and tend to avoid coarse sand. Occasionally they are found around oases, and up to an altitude of . Cooler temperatures, with annual averages of or less, are preferred.

== Behavior ==
They typically move by sidewinding, during which they press their weight into the sand or soil, leaving whole-body impressions. Often, it is even possible to use these impressions to make ventral scale counts. They have a reasonably placid temperament, but if threatened, they may assume a C-shaped posture and rapidly rub their coils together. Because they have strongly keeled scales, this rubbing produces a rasping noise, similar to the sound produced by snakes of the genus &quot;Echis&quot;. In the wild, they are typically ambush predators, lying submerged in sand adjacent to rocks or under vegetation. The diet of this carnivorous species consists primarily of small rodents, geckos, birds, and a variety of lizards. These vipers are also known to eat jerboas, yellow wagtails, and chiffchaffs. &quot;C. cerastes&quot; has been known to travel long distances at night in search of prey. When approached, they strike very rapidly, holding on to the captured prey until the venom takes effect.

== Reproduction ==
In captivity, mating was observed in April and always occurred while the animals were buried in the sand. This species is oviparous, laying 8–23 eggs that hatch after 50 to 80 days of incubation. The eggs are laid under rocks and in abandoned rodent burrows. The hatchlings measure 12–15 cm (about 5–6 inches) in total length.

== Venom ==
&quot;Cerastes cerastes&quot; venom is reported to be similar in action to &quot;Echis&quot; venom. Envenomation usually causes swelling, haemorrhage, necrosis, nausea, vomiting, and haematuria. A high phospholipase A2 content may cause cardiotoxicity and myotoxicity. Studies of venom from both &quot;C. cerastes&quot; and &quot;C. vipera&quot; list a total of eight venom fractions, the most powerful of which has haemorrhagic activity. Venom yields vary, with ranges of 19–27 mg to 100 mg of dried venom being reported. For venom toxicity, Brown (1973) gives values of 0.4 mg/kg IV and 3.0 mg/kg SC. An estimated lethal dose for humans is 40–50 mg.

== Taxonomy ==
A number of subspecies have been described:
* &quot;Cerastes cerastes hoofieni&quot; – Saudi Arabia.
* &quot;Cerastes cerastes karlhartli&quot; – Egyptian horned viper – southeast Egypt and Sinai Peninsula.
* &quot;Cerastes cerastes mutila&quot; – Algerian horned viper – southwest Algeria, Morocco.

Previously, &quot;C. gasperettii&quot; was also regarded as a subspecies of &quot;C. cerastes&quot;.

<text>The AEM (Automotive Engineering and Manufacturing) Scout was a Welsh-built Mini Moke type utility vehicle, with, zinc-coated bodywork and totally different styling not to mention the radically different method of production. It was made for only one year, 1987, in Merthyr Tydfil, South Wales. The running gear was based on the Mini, with a Mini engine, transmission, front subframe and Hydragas suspension.

The Scout, a particularly unsuccessful Mini based kit car had a remarkably chequered history having previously been made by Import Export of Spalding, Lincolnshire between 1983 and 1985 and after the demise of AEM the design was taken up by The Sun Motor Company of Solihull from 1990 to 1991. Six wheel versions were also made.

Universally, fans of genuine Mini Mokes, point out that this is a kit-car, not an updated or unique version of the BMC Mini Moke.

<doc id="850947" wikidata="Q1093862" url="?curid=850947" title="City Bridge Foundation">
<text>City Bridge Foundation is the working name of the historic Bridge House Estates, which originated in the late eleventh century and was formally established by royal charter in 1282 by the City of London Corporation in London, England. It is a registered charity governed by a single trustee, the City of London Corporation, represented by the City Bridge Foundation Board.

==History==
It was originally established to maintain London Bridge and, subsequently, other bridges. Funded by bridge tolls and charitable donations, the foundation acquired an extensive property portfolio which made it more than self-sufficient. As well as maintaining the bridges, the foundation also makes charitable grants. It is one of three trust funds managed by the City of London, the other two being the City Fund and the City&#x27;s Cash.

Since it was established, the foundation has maintained, and on several occasions replaced, London Bridge. The foundation also built Blackfriars Bridge and Tower Bridge, and purchased Southwark Bridge from the toll-exacting private company that built it. Most recently it took over ownership and maintenance of the pedestrian-only Millennium Bridge, having provided a large amount of the funding for its construction. The estate owns significant amounts of property in the City of London.

Until 1995, the foundation was permitted to use its income only for expenditure on its bridges. However, with a surplus of income over expenditure, a cy-près scheme was adopted in that year to allow any surplus income to be used for other charitable purposes benefiting Greater London.

From 1995 to September 2023 the charity funding arm was known as City Bridge Trust. In September 2023 Bridge House Estates and the City Bridge Trust merged unifying the brand as the City Bridge Foundation, however the formal entity name is still the Bridge House Estates.

==Bridge House==

The Bridge House Estates took its name from &quot;Bridge House&quot;, which was the administrative and maintenance centre of Old London Bridge located on the south bank of the River Thames, near the site of St Olave&#x27;s Church (since replaced by &quot;St Olaf House&quot; in Tooley Street). The site, now covered by the London Bridge Hospital and the Cotton&#x27;s Centre, was constituted of at least two properties in Southwark. The first was that of Peter of Colechurch the warden of the bridge from 1163, and probably a monastic dwelling. The second property was the house left by the will of Henry fitz Ailwin, first named Mayor of London, in 1215.

The bridge became part of the City&#x27;s jurisdiction from 1282, and this led to the City attempting to extend control over Southwark, succeeding in acquiring the &#x27;vill of Southwark&#x27; alias the Guildable Manor in 1327.

==Logo==

Known as the &quot;Bridge Mark&quot;, the logo of Bridge House Estates is one of the oldest logos in continuous use and can be found carved into stonework in many places along the riverfront. It has been the identifying emblem of the Bridge House Estates for many centuries, but the latter now uses the City of London arms as an emblem.

It was thought likely that the mark as we know it today was designed by a famous 17th-century surveyor, William Leybourn. It appears drawn on a plan of 1680 which it is thought he adapted from a similar mark drawn against plots owned by Bridge House Estates on an earlier plan of St George&#x27;s Fields in Southwark. The City sword rest from the church of St Olave, Southwark (now in the north transept of Southwark Cathedral) has the Bridge Mark carved onto it to balance the City&#x27;s shield, and shows a date of 1674.

==Governance==


The Bridge House Estates was established by the grant of a royal charter on 24 May 1282, and the sole trustee is the City of London Corporation. The trustee is the legal but not beneficial owner of the trust property—it may only be used for the legitimate purposes for which the fund was created.

Bridge House Estates are run by a committee of the City of London Corporation called the City Bridge Foundation Board (formerly the Bridge House Estates Board). Formed in 2021, the chairship is held by a Common Councillor on a four-year rotation; the first chair was Giles Shilson, who was in post until November 2024. The current Chair of the Board is Paul Martinelli.

In addition to its royal charter of 1282, the Bridge House Estates operates with respect to various legislative powers, e.g., the &#x27; (26 &amp; 27 Vict. c. lxii), the &#x27; (30 &amp; 31 Vict. c. iii), the (48 &amp; 49 Vict. c. cxcv) for its maintenance role and for its general charitable role under the Charities (The Bridge House Estates) Order 1995 (SI 1995/1047), and the Charities (The Bridge House Estates) Order 2001 (SI 2001/4017).

==Finances==
Originally funded by tolls on London Bridge, the rents and leases of the buildings that were on it and also by charitable donations, the Bridge House Estates acquired an extensive property portfolio which made it self-sufficient.

The fund administered by the Bridge House Estates is solely responsible for the five City Bridges. There is no financial support from the government or any other fund. If one of the bridges happened to collapse, the charity would have to rebuild it out of the endowment. The good stewardship of the property and investments of the estates by the City has led to the accumulation of surplus funds over any such demand on its resources. Therefore, the City sought from the Charity Commission to implement a cy-près scheme to extend its objects (purposes) since September 1995 to make charitable grants within the Greater London area.

In 2019, total income of the Bridge House Estates was £43.1 million and total expenditure and reinvestment was £53.1 million. The total funds held by the estates are in excess of £1.5 billion.

<text>From Beirut to Jerusalem (1989) is a book by American journalist Thomas L. Friedman chronicling his days as a reporter in Beirut during the Lebanese Civil War and in Jerusalem through the first year of the Intifada. 

Friedman wrote a 17-page epilogue for the first paperback edition (Anchor Books, 1990) concerning the potential for peaceful resolution in Israel and Palestine.

==Reception==

It received the 1989 National Book Award for Nonfiction and also the Cornelius Ryan Award. In a book review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Edward Said criticized what he saw as a naive, arrogant, and orientalist account of the Israel–Palestine conflict.

<doc id="850955" wikidata="Q11125522" url="?curid=850955" title="Revolver Ocelot">
<text>Revolver &quot;Shalashaska&quot; Ocelot (known in his youth as Major &quot;ADAM&quot; Ocelot) is a recurring fictional character in Konami&#x27;s &quot;Metal Gear&quot; video game series. Throughout the series, he takes on a variety of roles: a major nemesis of Solid Snake, a friendly rival to Naked Snake, the right-hand man to Liquid Snake and Solidus Snake, and a close ally to Venom Snake. Ocelot has been well received by video game publications for his role as a central villain in the franchise, and has often been considered one of its most important characters for his connections with various characters.

==Conception and design==
Introduced in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, Ocelot is normally clothed in a duster, spurs, and gunbelts, the traditional garb of gunslingers in spaghetti westerns, as well as a black armband on his left arm, and wields the Colt Single Action Army revolver, which he refers to as &quot;the greatest handgun ever made&quot;. In designing the character, Hideo Kojima wanted to add Western tones to a character resulting in Ocelot&#x27;s appearance, which is based on that of veteran Western film actor Lee Van Cleef. For &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, Yoji Shinkawa originally intended to give Ocelot a cybernetic arm in place of the one Gray Fox took from him, but this idea was not used as the staff intended to have Ocelot use the arm of Liquid Snake. While Kojima acknowledged fans finding the idea of Liquid&#x27;s arm possessing Ocelot&#x27;s mind ridiculous, he promised to answer the reason behind it in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;.

==Appearances==
 is introduced in the video game &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; as a gunslinger-themed member of the FOXHOUND terrorists involved with the hostile revolt on Shadow Moses Island which housed Metal Gear REX, serving as the team&#x27;s interrogation expert and their leader Liquid Snake&#x27;s right-hand man. He challenges Solid Snake to a gunfight in the game&#x27;s first boss-encounter, but their fight ends with Ocelot losing his right hand from an encounter with the Cyborg Ninja. Despite his loss, Ocelot later appears to torture Snake after Snake is captured. During Snake&#x27;s torture, Ocelot reveals he was originally from the former Soviet Union and a former member of Spetsnaz, secretly wishing for Liquid&#x27;s and Big Boss&#x27;s dream world as well. Ocelot is the sole surviving member of FOXHOUND by the game&#x27;s end. After the ending credits, it&#x27;s revealed that he&#x27;s in league with the U.S. President George Sears.

Revolver Ocelot, now known as , returns in the sequel &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;. He gains a new, surgically attached right-arm that originally belonged to Liquid, resulting in a dormant personality which takes over Ocelot&#x27;s mind whenever Solid Snake is nearby. During the game&#x27;s introductory Tanker Chapter, he is seemingly under Sergei Gurlukovich&#x27;s employ, but ends up betraying his old friend when Ocelot hijacks Metal Gear RAY, framing Snake and Otacon for the deed. During the game&#x27;s main Plant Chapter, Ocelot then forms part of the terrorist group &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; with Solidus Snake but ends up betraying the former President as well after revealing his true allegiance to the Patriots, a group that controls the United States. Shortly afterwards, Ocelot is taken over by Liquid and escapes from Snake, Solidus, and Raiden to kill the Patriots&#x27; leaders.

A young version of the character, known as , is featured in the prequel &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot; (set four decades before the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;). He&#x27;s a GRU Major under Colonel Volgin&#x27;s command and the leader of his own &quot;Ocelot Unit&quot; within GRU. His encounters with Naked Snake are why he acquires a preference for revolvers (due to a tendency to absorb the gun&#x27;s recoil with his elbow being more suited to shooting revolvers). Throughout the game, Ocelot&#x27;s constant challenges with Snake eventually turn into a friendly rivalry. He is revealed to be , The Boss&#x27;s illegitimate child. After the deaths of Volgin and The Boss, Ocelot is revealed to be a triple agent, taking orders from the Philosophers and the KGB, while also receiving orders from the Director of Central Intelligence. He was supposed to intercept and assist Snake; a mission he failed when another agent of the Philosophers, EVA, got there first.

The young version of Ocelot, also known as , plays a minor (yet significant) role in the direct sequel &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops&quot;. Initially in league with FOX&#x27;s insurgency leader Gene, Ocelot assassinates the DCI in order to &quot;end&quot; the Philosophers before being invited to join the Philosophers&#x27; reorganized American branch.

&quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; (set directly after &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;) features the character as as the primary antagonist. He deliberately uses self-hypnosis and nano-machines to act as Liquid&#x27;s mental doppelgänger to trick the Patriots&#x27; AIs. As &quot;Liquid&quot;, Ocelot establishes a parent company that runs the five largest PMCs, fighting for the Patriots&#x27; control over the world. After hijacking the Patriots&#x27; systems, Ocelot&#x27;s PMCs engage Old Snake. After Snake and Otacon use Naomi Hunter&#x27;s FOXALIVE virus to delete the Patriots&#x27; AIs, Ocelot challenges Snake to a fistfight and appears to die from exhaustion after the final fight; however, Ocelot&#x27;s death was actually caused by the new FOXDIE strain that Drebin injected into Snake.

The character canonically appears in &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;. He assists Venom Snake and the Diamond Dogs, playing a key role in facilitating Zero&#x27;s deception by subjecting both himself and Snake to hypnosis to cover it up and aiding Big Boss&#x27;s and Snake&#x27;s escape from XOF in Cyprus. Ocelot acts as the Diamond Dogs&#x27; interrogator, frequently clashing with Kazuhira Miller over matters involving Skull Face and the White Mamba. Ocelot ultimately declares his support for Big Boss&#x27;s covert war, foreshadowing his involvement in later &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; games.

In the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, Revolver Ocelot was voiced by Kōji Totani in the Japanese version and Pat Zimmerman (credited as Patric Laine in the PlayStation release) in the English version. Both actors would reprise the role in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;. The character&#x27;s young version in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; was voiced by Takumi Yamazaki for the Japanese version and Josh Keaton in the English version. Due to Koji Totani&#x27;s death in 2006, the character was voiced by Banjō Ginga in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; and Ikuya Sawaki in the &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel&quot; recreations while Pat Zimmerman continued the role in the English version. In &quot;Metal Gear Solid V&quot;, the character was voiced by Troy Baker in the English version while Satoshi Mikami dubbed the character&#x27;s voice for the Japanese version. Over the years, the character&#x27;s motion capture has been performed by Taro Kazanawa, Kenichi Yoshida, Bill Yokoyama, Troy Baker, and Matthew Carlsen.

==Critical reception==
The character of Revolver Ocelot has received a positive response by video game publications based on his role as an antagonist. He is one of the only characters to appear in almost every &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; game and is thus considered &quot;one of the only characters to have a major role in all five &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; titles&quot; by &quot;Game Informer&quot;. &quot;Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine&quot; called Revolver Ocelot underrated in comparison to &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot; iconic antagonist Sephiroth, describing Ocelot as &quot;just a persistent, sneaky, and cool villain. Heck, just watch the &quot;MGS3&quot; trailer and you&#x27;ll see that he was a badass even in the 60&#x27;s.&quot; G4&#x27;s &quot;Filter&quot; placed him at number ten in their top list of video game villains in 2002. Ocelot ranked 28th on IGN&#x27;s top list of video game villains. &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; listed Liquid Ocelot as ninth in their list of &quot;top 50 video game villains&quot;.

Ocelot has been frequently featured in the lists of best &quot;Metal Gear&quot; villains. In 2008, he placed seventh in IGN&#x27;s top list of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; boss battles, and second on the top list of &quot;Metal Gear&quot; villains. Including him on their 2007 list of the best &quot;Metal Gear&quot; bosses, GameSpot called him one of the most important characters from the story alongside Solid Snake and Big Boss. In 2008, the torture he makes in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was listed by GameSpy as one of the best moments from the game due to how Ocelot toys with Snake and how difficult it is to pass it besides how significant is the outcome for the rest of the game. In response to his role in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot;, GameSpy called Ocelot one of the &quot;series mainstay&quot;, hoping he would become an entertaining opponent.

According to &quot;Edge&quot; magazine, with Liquid Ocelot &quot;Kojima has forged a superb villain, far more complete than in &quot;MGS2&quot;.&quot; He was also listed by IGN as one of the fictional characters who required his own spin-off. GamesRadar too praised his role as Revolver/Liquid Ocelot, placing as seventh on their 2013 list of best villains in video game history. Ocelot&#x27;s change to his Liquid Ocelot alter-ego persona of Liquid Snake was opined by GameSpy to be one of the most nonsensical events from the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, but they still praised his action scenes at the start of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;. UGO.com speculated that, because of being born from the medium The Sorrow, Ocelot could communicate with dead people which ended in Liquid Snake taking possession of his body. &quot;GamePro&quot; described the final fight against Liquid Ocelot as &quot;epic&quot; even as he became &quot;a punching bag&quot; in the final phase. Furthermore, UGO.com listed this fight as the seventh best cutscene ever in 2011, owing to the fighting styles employed and the interaction between the two fighters. On the other hand, 1UP.com listed such fight in their article about the 13 &quot;most dumbass&quot; boss battles for its simple style in comparison to other more challenging bosses from &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; and its excessive length for a hand-to-hand fight between two old people. 1UP.com also listed the scenes from the games in which Liquid Ocelot controls the PMC&#x27;s weapons to attack the protagonists and his imitation of Liquid Snake&#x27;s death from &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; as one of the most surprising moments in the game. &quot;VentureBeat&quot; were bemused by Ocelot&#x27;s portrayal in &quot;Metal Gear Solid V&quot;, writing how he was &quot;calm and the voice of reason&quot; instead of being an &quot;eccentric, sadistic man&quot;. They theorized, however, that Ocelot was merely being himself and showing his true allegiances with Big Boss, rather than working as a triple agent or being under self-hypnosis akin to his previous appearances.

<text>Echis carinatus, known as the saw-scaled viper, Indian saw-scaled viper, little Indian viper, and by other common names, is a viper species found in parts of the Middle East and Central Asia, and especially the Indian subcontinent. It is the smallest member of the &quot;big four&quot; Indian snakes that are responsible for causing the most snakebite cases and deaths, due to various factors including their frequent occurrence in highly populated regions, and their inconspicuous nature. Like all vipers, the species is venomous. Two subspecies are currently recognized, including the nominate subspecies described here.

==Description==
The size of &quot;E. carinatus&quot; ranges between in total length (body + tail), but usually no more than .

Its head is distinct from its neck; its snout is very short and rounded. The nostril is between three shields, and the head is covered with small keeled scales, among which an enlarged supraocular is sometimes present. There are 9–14 interocular scales across the top of the head and 14–21 circumorbital scales. 1–3 rows of scales separate the eye from the supralabials. There are 10–12 supralabials, the fourth usually largest, and 10–13 sublabials.

===Scalation===
Midbody there are 25–39 rows of dorsal scales that are keeled scales with apical pits; on the flanks, these have serrated keels. There are 143–189 ventral scales that are rounded and cover the full width of the belly. The subcaudals are undivided and number 21–52, and the anal scale is single.

The color-pattern consists of a pale buff, grayish, reddish, olive or pale brown ground color, overlaid mid-dorsally with a series of variably colored, but mostly whitish spots, edged with dark brown, and separated by lighter interblotch patches. A series of white bows run dorsolaterally. The top of the head has a whitish cruciform or trident pattern and there is a faint stripe running from the eye to the angle of the jaw. The belly is whitish to pinkish, uniform in color or with brown dots that are either faint or distinct.

==Geographic range==
&quot;Echis carinatus&quot; is endemic to Asia. On the Indian subcontinent it is found in India, Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Pakistan (including Urak near Quetta and Astola Island off the coast of Makran). In the Middle East it is found in Oman, Masirah (Island), eastern United Arab Emirates, Iraq, and southwestern Iran. In Central Asia it is found in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, and Tajikistan.

The type locality was not included in the original description by Schneider (1801). However, a locality had been given as &quot;Arni&quot; (India) by Russell (1796:3).

There are also reports that this species occurs in Iraq.
It is found in Thiqar and Kirkuk governorates.

==Habitat==

&quot;Echis carinatus&quot; is found on a range of different substrates, including sand, rock, soft soil and in scrublands. It is often found hiding under loose rocks. Specimens have also been found in Balochistan at altitudes of up to 1982 m.

==Behaviour==

&quot;Echis carinatus&quot; is mostly crepuscular and nocturnal, although there have been reports of activity during daylight hours. During the daytime they hide in various locations, such as deep mammal burrows, rock fissures and fallen rotted logs. In sandy environments, they may bury themselves leaving only the head exposed. Often, they are most active after rains or on humid nights. This species is often found climbing in bushes and shrubs, sometimes as much as 2 m above the ground. When it rains, up to 80% of the adult population will climb into bushes and trees. Once, it was observed that approximately 20 individuals had massed on top of a single cactus or small shrub.

&quot;Echis carinatus&quot; is one of the species responsible for causing the most snakebite cases due to their inconspicuous and extremely aggressive nature.
Its characteristic pose, a double coil with a figure of eight, with the head poised in the center, permits it to lash out like a released spring.

They move about mainly by sidewinding: a method at which they are considerably proficient and alarmingly quick. They are also capable of other forms of locomotion, but sidewinding seems to be best suited to moving about in their usual sandy habitats. It may also keep them from overheating too quickly, as there are only two points of contact with the hot surface in this form of locomotion.

In the northern parts of its range, these snakes hibernate in winter.

==Feeding==
&quot;Echis carinatus&quot; feeds on rodents, lizards, frogs, and a variety of arthropods, such as scorpions, centipedes and large insects. Diet may be varied according to availability of prey. High populations in some areas may be due to this generalist diet.

==Reproduction==
The population of &quot;E. carinatus&quot; in India is ovoviviparous. In northern India, mating takes place in the winter with live young being born from April through August. Occasionally, births have also been recorded in other months. A litter usually consists of 3 to 15 young that are 115–152 mm in length. Mallow &quot;et al.&quot; (2003) mention a maximum litter size of 23. 
==Venom==
&quot;Echis carinatus&quot; produces on average about 18 mg of dry venom by weight, with a recorded maximum of 72 mg. It may inject as much as 12 mg, whereas the lethal dose for an adult is estimated to be only 5 mg. Envenomation results in local symptoms as well as severe systemic symptoms that may prove fatal. Local symptoms include swelling and pain, which appear within minutes of a bite. In severe cases the swelling may extend up the entire affected limb within 12–24 hours and blisters form on the skin. The venom yield from individual specimens varies considerably, as does the quantity injected per bite. The mortality rate from their bites is about 20%, and due to the availability of the anti-venom, deaths are currently quite rare.

Of the more dangerous systemic symptoms, hemorrhage and coagulation defects are the most striking. Hematemesis, melena, hemoptysis, hematuria and epistaxis also occur and may lead to hypovolemic shock. Almost all patients develop oliguria or anuria within a few hours to as late as 6 days post bite. In some cases, kidney dialysis is necessary due to acute kidney injury (AKI), but this is not often caused by hypotension. It is more often the result of intravascular hemolysis, which occurs in about half of all cases. In other cases, ARF is often caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation.

In any case, antivenin therapy and intravenous hydration within hours of the bite are vital for survival. At least eight different polyvalent and monovalent antivenins are available against bites from this species.

The venom from this species is used in the manufacture of several drugs. One is called &quot;echistatin&quot;, which is an anticoagulant. Even though many other snake venoms contain similar toxins, &quot;echistatin&quot; is not only especially potent, but also simplistic in structure, which makes it easier to replicate. Indeed, it is obtained not only through the purification of whole venom, but also as a product of chemical synthesis. Another drug made from &quot;E. carinatus&quot; venom is called &quot;ecarin&quot; and is the primary reagent in the ecarin clotting time (ECT) test, which is used to monitor anticoagulation during treatment with hirudin. Yet another drug produced from &quot;E. carinatus&quot; venom is Aggrastat (Tirofiban).

Antivenoms have been developed to treat saw-scaled viper bites.

<text>Hexanitrobenzene, also known as HNB, is a nitrobenzene compound in which six nitro groups are bonded to all six positions of a central benzene ring. It is a high-density explosive compound with chemical formula , obtained by oxidizing the amine group of pentanitroaniline with hydrogen peroxide in sulfuric acid.

== Properties ==

The stable conformation of this molecule has the nitro groups rotated out of the plane of the central benzene ring. The molecule adopts a propeller-like conformation in which the nitro groups are rotated about 53° from planar.

HNB has the undesirable property of being moderately sensitive to light and, therefore, hard to utilize safely. As of 2021, it is not used in any production explosives applications, though it is used as a precursor chemical in one method of production of TATB, another explosive.

HNB was experimentally used as a gas source for explosively pumped gas dynamic laser. In this application, HNB and tetranitromethane are preferred to more conventional explosives because the explosion products and are a simple enough mixture to simulate gas dynamic processes and quite similar to conventional gas dynamic laser medium. The water and hydrogen products of many other explosives could interfere with vibrational states of in this type of laser.

== Preparation ==
During World War II, a method of synthesis of hexanitrobenzene was suggested in Germany, and the product was supposed to be manufactured on a semi-industrial scale according to the following scheme:
: (partial reduction)
: (nitration)
: (oxidation)
Complete nitration of benzene is practically impossible because the nitro groups are deactivating groups for further nitration.

<doc id="850961" wikidata="Q1036301" url="?curid=850961" title="Mr. Bogus">
<text>Mr. Bogus is an American animated television series created by Peter Keefe, directed and produced by Tom Burton with Claudia Burton of Zodiac Entertainment, which aired in syndication from September 28, 1991 to November 22, 1993. The show also ran in 1998 on Fox Family Channel. It is loosely based on the French / Belgian clay animation series of shorts simply titled, Bogus. Each episode is separated into two distinct parts, one using mostly traditional cel animation and another using what the show is based on, which are 42 localized versions of the 300 original clay animation shorts (either 8 claymation shorts per episode, 336 in total). Characters often walked around on a kitchen counter having various adventures with common household items.

The show has also aired on Channel 4 and The Children&#x27;s Channel in the UK, on Welsh language channel S4C as &quot;Mr. Bogel&quot; in Wales, as well as on Telefutura program block, &quot;Toonturama&quot; as &quot;El Señor Bogus&quot; in United States with Spanish-dubbed, on TV Globo in Brazil, on TVN in Chile, ANT1 in Greece, on Arutz HaYeladim in Israel as &quot;Mr. Bluffer&quot;, on Max in Australia, on Fun Channel in the Middle East, on M-Net in South Africa, on Bahrain 55 in Bahrain, on TV2 in New Zealand, on ABS-CBN in The Philippines, on Channel 5 in Singapore, on Channel 2 in Jordan, on Dubai 33 in the UAE, on Canal J in France, on Tele 3 and TVP3 in Poland, on kabel eins in Germany, on MBC C&amp;I in South Korea, on TV3 in Sweden, on PTV4 in Finland, on Saudi 2 in Saudi Arabia, on TV3 in Malaysia and on TV6 in Russia.

==Summary==
===Cel-animated version===

In the cel-animated version, Mr. Bogus is a yellow gremlin-like creature living in the walls of the suburban home of Tommy Anybody, alternately creating problems and/or accidentally solving them. Sometimes Bogus adventures to his own world, Bogusland, a distorted alternate dimension of curved and warped perspective and bizarre plots. He often encountered the feared dust bunnies known on the show as Dirt Dudes.

===Clay animated version===
The clay-animated version is a series of shorts that are localized versions of several episodes of the 1987 French / Belgian series of shorts simply titled &quot;Bogus&quot;, and served as lead-ins to commercial breaks. They were originally produced by Antenne 2, Y.C. Aligator Film and Chin Chin Production, and were created by Michel Durieux and Ghislain Honoré. They were first aired on October 30, 1987, and reran from October 2, 1988 to February 1990. There were 300 episodes created, but only 42 were localized and used in the 42 episodes of the cel-animated version.

In the original 1987 plot, the male house owner was awakened by his alarm clock, drank coffee, took his keys, and left for work. But during his absence, the house wasn&#x27;t alone. Bogus, a funny little yellow character, then emerged from his hiding place and had short and fun adventures with surrounding objects. As Bogus clumsily discovered the world around him in different rooms of the house (such as the bathroom and the attic), he always provoked laughter from viewers.

In the 1991 localized version, the original voice-acting and background music were changed to Cam Clarke&#x27;s voice-acting and the instrumental version of the cel-animated version&#x27;s opening theme respectively.

<text>The Aero was a Czechoslovak automobile company that produced a variety of models between 1929 and 1947 by a well-known aircraft and car-body company owned by Dr. Kabes in Prague-Vysocany. Now Aero Vodochody produces aircraft only.

== Type 10 ==
The original Aero model, the &quot;Type 500&quot; or &quot;Type 10&quot; was a small car launched in 1928. Powered by a 494 cc single-cylinder two-stroke engine with water cooling, producing , it could reach a top speed of . Drive was through a 3-speed gearbox to a rear axle without differential. The Type 10 was sold with a choice of body styles; roadster, cabriolet and coupé, all with two seats in the front and one in the rear. Production ran for four years, ending in 1932 with 1,358 built.

== Type 18 ==

Announced in 1931, the Type 18 (also known as the 662) was powered by a larger 660 cc two-cylinder engine developing , with a top speed of . With improved four-wheel brakes, the Type 18 came as a 3-seater roadster and 4-seat saloon, made using steel-covered timber-framed coachwork. 2,615 Type 18s were built before manufacturing ceased in 1934.

== Type 20 ==
Based on the Type 18/662, the 1933 Type 20 (also known as the 1000) came with a larger 999 cc engine which would power the car to a top speed of . Production lasted two years and ceased in 1934 after 2,546 were built.

== Type 30 ==

In 1934 the Type 30 was announced with a 998 cc twin-cylinder engine, front-wheel drive and all independent suspension. The car could reach . The Type 30 was the most successful Aero model, and production reached 7,780 before manufacturing ended in 1940. Another 500 were produced post-war with a new radiator design but was stopped in 1947 when the company was nationalised.

== Type 50 ==

The last, and largest, Aero model was the Type 50 announced in 1936 and manufactured until 1942. The front-wheel-drive model had a 1997 cc four-cylinder two-stroke engine with twin alloy cylinder head and was capable of reaching . 1,205 were made before the company closed.

== 750 Pony ==
The 750 Pony is a small two-seater convertible with only 2 models built as prototypes in 1941 and was intended for post war producing, but nationalisation of the company ended the plan. It was powered by a 745 cc engine producing .

<doc id="850969" wikidata="Q776030" url="?curid=850969" title="Systemic inflammatory response syndrome">
<text>In immunology, systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is an inflammatory state affecting the whole body. It is the body&#x27;s response to an infectious or noninfectious insult. Although the definition of SIRS refers to it as an &quot;inflammatory&quot; response, it actually has pro- and anti-inflammatory components.

==Presentation==
===Complications===
SIRS is frequently complicated by failure of one or more organs or organ systems. The complications of SIRS include
* Acute kidney injury
* Shock
* Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome

==Causes==
The causes of SIRS are broadly classified as infectious or noninfectious. Causes of SIRS include:
* bacterial infections
* severe malaria
* trauma
* burns
* pancreatitis
* ischemia
* hemorrhage

Other causes include:
* Complications of surgery
* Adrenal insufficiency
* Pulmonary embolism
* Complicated aortic aneurysm
* Cardiac tamponade
* Anaphylaxis
* Drug overdose

==Diagnosis==

SIRS is a serious condition related to systemic inflammation, organ dysfunction, and organ failure. It is a subset of cytokine storm, in which there is abnormal regulation of various cytokines. SIRS is also closely related to sepsis, in which patients satisfy criteria for SIRS and have a suspected or proven infection.

Many experts consider the current criteria for a SIRS diagnosis to be overly sensitive, as nearly all (&gt;90%) of patients admitted to the ICU meet the SIRS criteria.

===Adult===
Manifestations of SIRS include, but are not limited to:
* Body temperature less than 36 °C (96.8 °F) or greater than 38 °C (100.4 °F)
* Heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute
* Tachypnea (high respiratory rate), with greater than 20 breaths per minute; or, an arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide less than 4.3 kPa (32 mmHg)
* White blood cell count less than 4000 cells/mm³ (4 x 109 cells/L) or greater than 12,000 cells/mm³ (12 x 109 cells/L); or the presence of greater than 10% immature neutrophils (band forms). Band forms greater than 3% is called bandemia or a &quot;left-shift&quot;.

When two or more of these criteria are met with or without evidence of infection, patients may be diagnosed with &quot;SIRS&quot;. Patients with SIRS and acute organ dysfunction may be termed &quot;severe SIRS&quot;. Note: Fever and an increased white blood cell count are features of the acute-phase reaction, while an increased heart rate is often the initial sign of hemodynamic compromise. An increased rate of breathing may be related to the increased metabolic stress due to infection and inflammation, but may also be an ominous sign of inadequate perfusion resulting in the onset of anaerobic cellular metabolism.

===Children===
The International Pediatric Sepsis Consensus has proposed some changes to adapt these criteria to the pediatric population.

In children, the SIRS criteria are modified in the following fashion:
* Heart rate is greater than 2 standard deviations above normal for age in the absence of stimuli such as pain and drug administration, or unexplained persistent elevation for greater than 30 minutes to 4 hours. In infants, also includes heart rate less than 10th percentile for age in the absence of vagal stimuli, beta-blockers, or congenital heart disease or unexplained persistent depression for greater than 30 minutes.
* Body temperature obtained orally, rectally, from Foley catheter probe, or from central venous catheter probe less than 36 °C or greater than 38.5 °C.
* Respiratory rate greater than 2 standard deviations above normal for age or the requirement for mechanical ventilation not related to neuromuscular disease or the administration of anesthesia.
* White blood cell count elevated or depressed for age not related to chemotherapy, or greater than 10% bands plus other immature forms.
Temperature or white blood cell count must be abnormal to qualify as SIRS in pediatric patients.

==Treatment==
Generally, the treatment for SIRS is directed towards the underlying problem or inciting cause (i.e. adequate fluid replacement for hypovolemia, IVF/NPO for pancreatitis, epinephrine/steroids/diphenhydramine for anaphylaxis).
Selenium, glutamine, and eicosapentaenoic acid have shown effectiveness in improving symptoms in clinical trials. Other antioxidants such as vitamin E may be helpful as well.

Septic treatment protocol and diagnostic tools have been created due to the potentially severe outcome septic shock. For example, the SIRS criteria were created as mentioned above to be extremely sensitive in suggesting which patients may have sepsis. However, these rules lack specificity, i.e. not a true diagnosis of the condition, but rather a suggestion to take necessary precautions. The SIRS criteria are guidelines set in place to ensure septic patients receive care as early as possible.

In cases caused by an implanted mesh, removal (explantation) of the polypropylene surgical mesh implant may be indicated.

==History==
The concept of SIRS was first conceived of and presented by William R. Nelson, of the Department of Surgery of the University of Toronto. SIRS was more broadly adopted in 1991 at the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference with the goal of aiding in the early detection of sepsis.

Criteria for SIRS were established in 1992 as part of the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine Consensus Conference. The conference concluded that the manifestations of SIRS include, but are not limited to the first four described above under adult SIRS criteria.

In septic patients, these clinical signs can also be seen in other proinflammatory conditions, such as trauma, burns, pancreatitis, etc. A follow-up conference, therefore, decided to define the patients with a documented or highly suspicious infection that results in a systemic inflammatory response as having sepsis. Note that SIRS criteria are non-specific, and must be interpreted carefully within the clinical context. These criteria exist primarily for the purpose of more objectively classifying critically ill patients so that future clinical studies may be more rigorous and more easily reproducible.

<doc id="850971" wikidata="Q6382773" url="?curid=850971" title="Keeled scales">
<text>Keeled scales refer to reptile scales that, rather than being smooth, have a ridge down the center that may or may not extend to the tip of the scale, making them rough to the touch. According to Street&#x27;s (1979) description of European lizards and snakes, in those that have keeled scales the keels are usually stronger in male specimens and are consistently arranged according to the species of reptiles, even though many others do not have them. With European lizards, the dorsal scales are usually well keeled, while those on the flanks are more weakly keeled and those on the belly smooth. Non-European lizards such as &quot;Sphaerodactylus macrolepis&quot; also display keeled scales. 

Klauber (1997) describes how the keels on the scales of &quot;Crotalus&quot; rattlesnakes are particularly strong mid-dorsally, but gradually weaken on the lateral rows with the ventral scales being smooth. He then references a 1938 study, stating that it &quot;has suggested that the keels may have an adaptive advantage in reducing shininess, that otherwise might lead to discovery by enemies.&quot;

The purposes of keeled scales are largely understudied, but some other uses may include locomotion in arboreal and grass-dwelling species. Water collection has been shown in some rattlesnakes, though the nanostructure of the scales is thought to be more significant than the macrostructure (keel) of the scales. 

In some viperines, most notably those of the genus &quot;Echis&quot;, the lateral scales are not only keeled, but the keels have minute serrations. The snakes use this in a warning and threat display: the body is arranged into a series of parallel C-shaped (counterlooped) coils that they rub together continuously to produce a sizzling sound, rather like water on a hot plate. This method of making sound is called stridulation.

<doc id="850973" wikidata="Q1153902" url="?curid=850973" title="Phase-change memory">
<text>Phase-change memory (also known as PCM, PCME, PRAM, PCRAM, OUM (ovonic unified memory) and C-RAM or CRAM (chalcogenide RAM)) is a type of non-volatile random-access memory. PRAMs exploit the unique behaviour of chalcogenide glass. In PCM, heat produced by the passage of an electric current through a heating element generally made of titanium nitride is used to either quickly heat and quench the glass, making it amorphous, or to hold it in its crystallization temperature range for some time, thereby switching it to a crystalline state. PCM also has the ability to achieve a number of distinct intermediary states, thereby having the ability to hold multiple bits in a single cell, but the difficulties in programming cells in this way has prevented these capabilities from being implemented in other technologies (most notably flash memory) with the same capability.

Recent research on PCM has been directed towards attempting to find viable material alternatives to the phase-change material Ge2Sb2Te5 (GST), with mixed success. Other research has focused on the development of a GeTe–Sb2Te3 superlattice to achieve non-thermal phase changes by changing the co-ordination state of the germanium atoms with a laser pulse. This new Interfacial Phase-Change Memory (IPCM) has had many successes and continues to be the site of much active research.

Leon Chua has argued that all two-terminal non-volatile-memory devices, including PCM, should be considered memristors. Stan Williams of HP Labs has also argued that PCM should be considered a memristor. However, this terminology has been challenged, and the potential applicability of memristor theory to any physically realizable device is open to question.

==Background==
In the 1960s, Stanford R. Ovshinsky of Energy Conversion Devices first explored the properties of chalcogenide glasses as a potential memory technology. In 1969, Charles Sie published a dissertation at Iowa State University that both described and demonstrated the feasibility of a phase-change-memory device by integrating chalcogenide film with a diode array. A cinematographic study in 1970 established that the phase-change-memory mechanism in chalcogenide glass involves electric-field-induced crystalline filament growth. In the September 1970 issue of &quot;Electronics&quot;, Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, published an article on the technology. However, material quality and power consumption issues prevented commercialization of the technology. More recently, interest and research have resumed as flash and DRAM memory technologies are expected to encounter scaling difficulties as chip lithography shrinks.

The crystalline and amorphous states of chalcogenide glass have dramatically different electrical resistivity values. The amorphous, high resistance state represents a binary 0, while the crystalline, low resistance state represents a 1. Chalcogenide is the same material used in re-writable optical media (such as CD-RW and DVD-RW). In those instances, the material&#x27;s optical properties are manipulated, rather than its electrical resistivity, as chalcogenide&#x27;s refractive index also changes with the state of the material.

Although PRAM has not yet reached the commercialization stage for consumer electronic devices, nearly all prototype devices make use of a chalcogenide alloy of germanium (Ge), antimony (Sb) and tellurium (Te) called GeSbTe (GST). The stoichiometry, or Ge:Sb:Te element ratio, is 2:2:5 in GST. When GST is heated to a high temperature (over 600 °C), its chalcogenide crystallinity is lost. Once cooled, it is frozen into an amorphous glass-like state and its electrical resistance is high. By heating the chalcogenide to a temperature above its crystallization point, but below the melting point, it will transform into a crystalline state with a much lower resistance. The time to complete this phase transition is temperature-dependent. Cooler portions of the chalcogenide take longer to crystallize, and overheated portions may be remelted. A crystallization time scale on the order of 100ns is commonly used. This is longer than conventional volatile memory devices like modern DRAM, which have a switching time on the order of two nanoseconds. However, a January 2006 Samsung Electronics patent application indicates PRAM may achieve switching times as fast as five nanoseconds.

A 2008 advance pioneered by Intel and ST Microelectronics allowed the material state to be more carefully controlled, allowing it to be transformed into one of four distinct states: the previous amorphous or crystalline states, along with two new partially crystalline ones. Each of these states has different electrical properties that can be measured during reads, allowing a single cell to represent two bits, doubling memory density.

===Aluminum/antimony===
Phase-change memory devices based on germanium, antimony and tellurium present manufacturing challenges, since etching and polishing of the material with chalcogens can change the material&#x27;s composition. Materials based on aluminum and antimony are more thermally stable than GeSbTe. Al50Sb50 has three distinct resistance levels, offering the potential to store three bits of data in two cells as opposed to two (nine states possible for the pair of cells, using eight of those states yields log2 8 = 3 bits).

==PRAM vs. Flash==
PRAM&#x27;s switching time and inherent scalability make it more appealing than flash memory. PRAM&#x27;s temperature sensitivity is perhaps its most notable drawback, one that may require changes in the production process of manufacturers incorporating the technology.

Flash memory works by modulating charge (electrons) stored within the gate of a MOS transistor. The gate is constructed with a special &quot;stack&quot; designed to trap charges (either on a floating gate or in insulator &quot;traps&quot;). The presence of charge within the gate shifts the transistor&#x27;s threshold voltage formula_1 higher or lower, corresponding to a change in the cell&#x27;s bit state from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1. Changing the bit&#x27;s state requires removing the accumulated charge, which demands a relatively large voltage to &quot;suck&quot; the electrons off the floating gate. This burst of voltage is provided by a charge pump, which takes some time to build up power. General write times for common flash devices are on the order of 100μs (for a block of data), about 10,000 times the typical 10ns read time for SRAM for example (for a byte).

PRAM can offer much higher performance in applications where writing quickly is important, both because the memory element can be switched more quickly, and also because single bits may be changed to either 1 or 0 without needing to first erase an entire block of cells. PRAM&#x27;s high performance, thousands of times faster than conventional hard drives, makes it particularly interesting in nonvolatile memory roles that are currently performance-limited by memory access timing.

In addition, with flash, each burst of voltage across the cell causes degradation. As the size of the cells decreases, damage from programming grows worse because the voltage necessary to program the device does not scale with the lithography. Most flash devices are rated for, currently, only 5,000 writes per sector, and many flash controllers perform wear leveling to spread writes across many physical sectors.

PRAM devices also degrade with use, for different reasons than flash, but degrade much more slowly. A PRAM device may endure around 100 million write cycles. PRAM lifetime is limited by mechanisms such as degradation due to GST thermal expansion during programming, metal (and other material) migration, and other mechanisms still unknown.

Flash parts can be programmed before being soldered onto a board, or even purchased pre-programmed. The contents of a PRAM, however, are lost because of the high temperatures needed to solder the device to a board (see reflow soldering or wave soldering). This was made worse by the requirement to have lead-free manufacturing requiring higher soldering temperatures. A manufacturer using PRAM parts must provide a mechanism to program the PRAM &quot;in-system&quot; after it has been soldered in place.

The special gates used in flash memory &quot;leak&quot; charge (electrons) over time, causing corruption and loss of data. The resistivity of the memory element in PRAM is more stable; at the normal working temperature of 85 °C, it is projected to retain data for 300 years.

By carefully modulating the amount of charge stored on the gate, flash devices can store multiple (usually two) bits in each physical cell. In effect, this doubles the memory density, reducing cost. PRAM devices originally stored only a single bit in each cell, but Intel&#x27;s recent advances have removed this problem.

Because flash devices trap electrons to store information, they are susceptible to data corruption from radiation, making them unsuitable for many space and military applications. PRAM exhibits higher resistance to radiation.

PRAM cell selectors can use various devices: diodes, BJTs and MOSFETs. Using a diode or a BJT provides the greatest amount of current for a given cell size. However, the concern with using a diode stems from parasitic currents to neighboring cells, as well as a higher voltage requirement, resulting in higher power consumption. Chalcogenide resistance is necessarily larger than that of a diode, meaning operating voltage must exceed 1 V by a wide margin to guarantee adequate forward bias current from the diode. Perhaps the most severe consequence of using a diode-selected array, in particular for large arrays, is the total reverse bias leakage current from the unselected bit lines. In transistor-selected arrays, only the selected bit lines contribute reverse bias leakage current. The difference in leakage current is several orders of magnitude. A further concern with scaling below 40 nm is the effect of discrete dopants as the p-n junction width scales down. Thin film-based selectors allow higher densities, utilizing &lt; 4 F2 cell area by stacking memory layers horizontally or vertically. Often the isolation capabilities are inferior to the use of transistors if the on/off ratio for the selector is not sufficient, limiting the ability to operate very large arrays in this architecture. Chalcogenide-based threshold switches have been demonstrated as a viable selector for high-density PCM arrays 

==2000 and later==
In August 2004, Nanochip licensed PRAM technology for use in MEMS (micro-electric-mechanical-systems) probe storage devices. These devices are not solid state. Instead, a very small platter coated in chalcogenide is dragged beneath thousands or even millions of electrical probes that can read and write the chalcogenide. Hewlett-Packard&#x27;s micro-mover technology can accurately position the platter to 3nm so densities of more than 1Tbit (125GB) per square inch will be possible if the technology can be perfected. The basic idea is to reduce the amount of wiring needed on-chip; instead of wiring every cell, the cells are placed closer together and read by current passing through the MEMS probes, acting like wires. This approach resembles IBM&#x27;s Millipede technology.

===Samsung 46.7 nm cell===
In September 2006, Samsung announced a prototype 512Mb (64MB) device using diode switches. The announcement was something of a surprise, and it was especially notable for its fairly high memory density. The prototype featured a cell size of only 46.7 nm, smaller than commercial flash devices available at the time. Although flash devices of higher &quot;capacity&quot; were available (64Gb, or 8GB, was just coming to market), other technologies competing to replace flash in general offered lower densities (larger cell sizes). The only production MRAM and FeRAM devices are only 4 Mb, for example. The high density of Samsung&#x27;s prototype PRAM device suggested it could be a viable flash competitor, and not limited to niche roles as other devices have been. PRAM appeared to be particularly attractive as a potential replacement for NOR flash, where device capacities typically lag behind those of NAND flash devices. State-of-the-art capacities on NAND passed 512 Mb some time ago. NOR flash offers similar densities to Samsung&#x27;s PRAM prototype and already offers bit addressability (unlike NAND where memory is accessed in banks of many bytes at a time).

===Intel&#x27;s PRAM device===
Samsung&#x27;s announcement was followed by one from Intel and STMicroelectronics, who demonstrated their own PRAM devices at the 2006 Intel Developer Forum in October. They showed a 128 Mb part that began manufacture at STMicroelectronics&#x27;s research lab in Agrate, Italy. Intel stated that the devices were strictly proof-of-concept.

===BAE device===
PRAM is also a promising technology in the military and aerospace industries where radiation effects make the use of standard non-volatile memories such as flash impractical. PRAM devices have been introduced by BAE Systems, referred to as C-RAM, claiming excellent radiation tolerance (rad-hard) and latchup immunity. In addition, BAE claims a write cycle endurance of 108, which will allow it to be a contender for replacing PROMs and EEPROMs in space systems.

===Multi-level cell===
In February 2008, Intel and STMicroelectronics revealed the first multilevel (MLC) PRAM array prototype. The prototype stored two logical bits in each physical cell, in effect 256 Mb of memory stored in a 128 Mb physical array. This means that instead of the normal two states—fully amorphous and fully crystalline—an additional two distinct intermediate states represent different degrees of partial crystallization, allowing for twice as many bits to be stored in the same physical area. In June 2011, IBM announced that they had created stable, reliable, multi-bit phase-change memory with high performance and stability. SK Hynix had a joint developmental agreement and a technology license agreement with IBM for the development of multi-level PRAM technology.

===Intel&#x27;s 90 nm device===
Also in February 2008, Intel and STMicroelectronics shipped prototype samples of their first PRAM product to customers. The 90 nm, 128 Mb (16 MB) product was called Alverstone.

In June 2009, Samsung and Numonyx B.V. announced a collaborative effort in the development of PRAM market-tailored hardware products.

In April 2010, Numonyx announced the Omneo line of 128-Mbit NOR-compatible phase-change memories. Samsung announced shipment of 512 Mb phase-change RAM (PRAM) in a multi-chip package (MCP) for use in mobile handsets by Fall 2010.

===ST 28 nm, 16 MB array===
In December 2018 STMicroelectronics presented design and performance data for a 16 MB ePCM array for a 28 nm fully depleted silicon on insulator automotive control unit.

===In-memory computing===
More recently, there is significant interest in the application of PCM for in-memory computing. The essential idea is to perform computational tasks such as matrix-vector-multiply operations in the memory array itself by exploiting PCM&#x27;s analog storage capability and Kirchhoff&#x27;s circuit laws. PCM-based in-memory computing could be interesting for applications such as deep learning inference which do not require very high computing precision. In 2021, IBM published a full-fledged in-memory computing core based on multi-level PCM integrated in 14 nm CMOS technology node.

==Challenges==
The greatest challenge for phase-change memory has been the requirement of high programming current density (&gt;107A/cm2, compared to 105...106 A/cm2 for a typical transistor or diode). 
The contact between the hot phase-change region and the adjacent dielectric is another fundamental concern. The dielectric may begin to leak current at higher temperature, or may lose adhesion when expanding at a different rate from the phase-change material.

Phase-change memory is susceptible to a fundamental tradeoff of unintended vs. intended phase-change. This stems primarily from the fact that phase-change is a thermally driven process rather than an electronic process. Thermal conditions that allow for fast crystallization should not be too similar to standby conditions, e.g. room temperature, otherwise data retention cannot be sustained. With the proper activation energy for crystallization it is possible to have fast crystallization at programming conditions while having very slow crystallization at normal conditions.

Probably the biggest challenge for phase-change memory is its long-term resistance and threshold voltage drift. The resistance of the amorphous state slowly increases according to a power law (~t0.1). This severely limits the ability for multilevel operation, since a lower intermediate state would be confused with a higher intermediate state at a later time, and could also jeopardize standard two-state operation if the threshold voltage increases beyond the design value.

In April 2010, Numonyx released its Omneo line of parallel and serial interface 128 Mb NOR flash replacement PRAM chips. Although the NOR flash chips they intended to replace operated in the −40-85 °C range, the PRAM chips operated in the 0-70 °C range, indicating a smaller operating window compared to NOR flash. This is likely due to the use of highly temperature-sensitive p–n junctions to provide the high currents needed for programming.

<doc id="850977" wikidata="Q7796499" url="?curid=850977" title="Thornton-Donovan School">
<text>The Thornton-Donovan School (TD) was founded as the New Rochelle School and Kindergarten in New Rochelle, New York by Judge Martin Jerome Keogh in 1901. The first teacher and headmistress was Emily Scott Thornton, a Philadelphia native educated at University College Nottingham (now the University of Nottingham). The headmaster as of 2023 is Douglas E. Fleming, Jr.

The school is now at its third campus, on Overlook Circle in the Beechmont neighborhood of New Rochelle. It inhabits three former homes, including the former Andrew Crawford estate (now the Main Building).

==Overview==
The Thornton-Donovan School is now a New York State accredited high school educating over 175 students in grades K-12 every year. On May 25, 2005, students planted two flowering trees at the end of Overlook Circle and at Lester Place and Beechmont Lake as a gift to the city of New Rochelle, New York.

The school has a swimming pool, an outdoor playset, woodchips, a driveway, more than thirty living trees, a large grassy field, a basketball/tennis/family court, three buildings, a parking lot/Hacky Sack arena, and a shed for arts and crafts which is used only during the summer.

===2008-2009 Renovation===
In early 2008, plans were being made to expand and level the field along with building a new basketball court. A proposal for the renovation was sent to the New Rochelle Department of Development Planning Board on June 24. The proposal stated that the field would be graded, ten irrigation sprinklers would be installed, the basketball court would be taken apart and relocated to allow more field space, a ten-foot chain link fence would enclose the new court, and twenty trees would be removed during the process. Headmaster Douglas Fleming has referred to the final product as the Field of Dreams.

===Summer Challenge Program===
In the summer, the school also holds a summer camp program. Children aged 3–14 are permitted to join the program. The children are split into two divisions: Play School (3–7 years) and Sports Fitness (7–14 years). They participate in a wide variety of sports. Activities include: tennis, softball, field hockey, swimming, arts and crafts, karate, dance, basketball, soccer, trampolining, capture the flag, an outdoor playset, watermelon, and kickball. The older group is also taken to a bowling alley in the Bronx every Friday, where the children have a chance to bowl.

==Thematic Language Education==
Middle and Upper School curricula are themed annually on an area of the world. Students are exposed daily to a dynamic course of learning throughout the year learning not only about international cultures, but actual politics, history and the arts of painting in an intramural and experiential context. The school also has strong ties to several countries, with 35 sister schools throughout Europe, Asia, and Latin America. During the school year, about four students are selected to go to one of several sister schools. The more notable exchange trips are to Busan, South Korea; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Dublin, Ireland; La Rochelle, France; Nottingham, England; Rome, Italy; Mexico City, and Guatemala City.

A rigorous course of learning is punctuated by a &quot;spring-time fling&quot; trip to locations associated with the year&#x27;s theme (i.e. - the country or locale the school studied). Students, faculty and friends can all join for an exceptional educational excursion. Since 1994, there have been 18 trips, of which 14 were international.

===1990s===
Little information about the first six trips taken by the school has been given through their website; however, trips to six countries and one state were undertaken between 1994 and 1999.

===2000- Greece===
The new millennium began with an 11-day trip to Greece that started on May 18 and ended on May 28. The travelers departed from John F. Kennedy Airport in New York City on May 18 and landed in Athens, Greece on May 19. The group spent the morning and early afternoon at the Hotel Plaka in old Athens, overlooking the Acropolis. After touring the old city that evening, the school went to the Acropolis at night before going to Pnyx Hill to see a light show. On May 20, a full day of sightseeing took place. Travelers visited the Propylaea, Temple of Athena, the Erechtheum, the Parthenon, the Acropolis Museum, and the Theatre of Dionysus. At 6:00 pm, they attended a Changing of the Guard ceremony in front of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
===2001- Spain===
In 2001, the school took an 18-day excursion to Spain from May 10 to 28.

===2002- New York===
The following year was a ten-day tour of New York City, Upstate New York, and Montreal from April 12 to 21.

===2003- Florida===
In 2003, the school traveled to southern Florida from April 25 to May 4.

===2004- Belgium===
In 2004, a ten-day trip to Belgium began on April 29 and ended on May 8.

===2005- Illinois and Missouri===
In 2005, the schools&#x27; most recent non-international trip took place from April 1 to 10 in Illinois and Missouri.

===2006- England===
During 2006, the school traveled to England for two weeks from April 28 to May 13.

===2007- Japan===

From May 4 to 17, 2007, the school journeyed to Japan. One of the largest excursions made by the school, a total of 90 people, including teachers and parents, took part in the trip across the Pacific. Due to the large number of people, two flights were taken to Japan, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, both of which were from John F. Kennedy Airport to Narita Airport; however, the first stopped in Los Angeles, California to reduce the amount of waiting time between the two flights. That night was spent in the Shiba Park Hotel in Tokyo. The first destination was the Ghibli Museum in Mitaka, Tokyo before traveling to the Meiji Shrine which dates back to 1920. After visiting the shine, the group traveled across the Rainbow bridge to the Fuji Television building. The final visit of the day was to the Tokyo International Forum where the group attended a performance by La Folle Journee au Japan. The next day the school traveled to the Imperial Palace for an exclusive tour inside the building; however, this did not take place due to misunderstandings by the students and the group toured the outside of the palace. After touring the Imperial Palace, the next stop was the John Lennon Museum in Chūō-ku, Saitama.

===2008- Portugal===

The 2008 trip taken by the school was from April 25 to May 10 in Portugal.

===2009- Brazil===
From April 29, 2009, the school toured Salvador, Brazil. The trip has taken students through the favelas of Rio de Janeiro and entered the Amazon Rainforest on May 1.

===2010- South Africa===
As of September 28, 2008, the 2009-10 semester trip is set to be about South Africa.

<text>Soyuz TM-13 was the 13th expedition to the Mir space station. Launched from the Soviet Union in October 1991 and lasting until March 1992, the mission included cosmonauts from Austria and the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic (Kazakh SSR), the latter of which became an independent state during the mission due to the dissolution of the Soviet Union in December 1991. The launch ceremony at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Baikonur, Kazakh SSR was attended by the Soviet Premier Ivan Silaev, the President of the Kazakh SSR Nursultan Nazarbayev, and the Chancellor of Austria Franz Vranitzky. Before the launch, for the first time, President Nazarbayev received the launch report from cosmonaut Tokhtar Aubakirov in the Kazakh language.

==Crew==
== Mission highlights ==
Soyuz-TM 13 carried commander Alexander Volkov along with Austrian cosmonaut-researcher Franz Viehböck and Soviet-Kazakh cosmonaut-researcher Toktar Aubakirov. The flight was unusual for carrying no flight engineer. Veteran Russian cosmonaut Alexandr Volkov commanded. The Austrians paid $7 million to fly Viehböck to Mir, and the Kazakh cosmonaut flew partly in an effort to encourage the then-Kazakh SSR to continue to permit launchings from Baikonur Cosmodrome. The cosmonaut-researchers photographed their respective countries from orbit and conducted the usual range of materials processing and medical experiments. Artsebarsky and Viehböck returned to Earth in Soyuz TM-12, with Volkov remaining on board Mir for an extended mission.

The Soyuz spent a total of 175 days docked to the Mir space station.

The Soyuz returned from Mir with German Klaus-Dietrich Flade and Krikalev and Volkov, dubbed by some as &quot;the last citizens of the USSR&quot; because they had launched from the Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic within the USSR, and landed in what had since become the independent Republic of Kazakhstan.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Out of the Present&quot;, a 1995 film documentary focused on Soyuz TM-12 cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev&#x27;s stay on Mir, features the arrival of Soyuz TM-13.

<text>Theodor Martens (August 27, 1822, – October 1, 1884) was a 19th-century German artist.

==Life and work==
Martens was born in Wismar, Germany. he had nine children. He resided in Düsseldorf, Paris, Hamburg, Schwerin and Portici, in addition to Wismar. Martens worked as a merchant until age 40 when he took up art as his full-time vocation. Martens studied with August Weber in Düsseldorf and Émile Lambinet in Paris.

His work was especially influenced by the Barbizon school masters such as Corot, Daubigny and Diaz. In 1874 he received a silver medal during a show at the London Crystal Palace. He died from cholera in Portici, Italy, aged 62.

His paintings are in a realistic style that anticipates the impressionists to follow. Many landscapes and architectural subjects are included in his work. His works were considered very modern by contemporaries. Many examples of his work may be found today at the Schwerin State Art Museum in Schwerin, Germany and in the Schwerin Castle located in that northern German city.

A painting by Martens was sold July 6, 2004, at auction at Bonhams in London for $790 (US) it was a 27.5 by 35 centimeter oil titled &quot;A river at dusk&quot;, the auction report did not disclose a date for the painting.

<text>The Homalopsidae are a family of snakes which contains about 30 genera and more than 50 species. They are commonly known as Indo-Australian water snakes, mudsnakes, or bockadams. They are also known as (lit. &quot;water snake&quot;) in Indonesian. They are typically stout-bodied water snakes, and all are mildly venomous. Two monotypic genera are notable for their unusual morphology: &quot;Erpeton&quot; possesses a pair of short, fleshy appendages protruding from the front of the snout, and &quot;Bitia&quot; has uniquely enlarged palatine teeth. &quot;Cerberus&quot; species have been noted to use sidewinding to cross slick mud flats during low tide. &quot;Fordonia&quot; and &quot;Gerarda&quot; are the only snakes known to tear their prey apart before eating it, pulling soft-shelled crabs through their coils to rip them apart prior to ingestion.

<doc id="850992" wikidata="Q182240" url="?curid=850992" title="Siege of Warsaw (1939)">
<text>The siege of Warsaw in 1939 was fought between the Polish Warsaw Army () garrisoned and entrenched in Warsaw and the invading German Army.

It began with huge aerial bombardments initiated by the Luftwaffe starting on September 1, 1939 following the German invasion of Poland. Land fighting started on September 8, when the first German armored units reached the Wola district and south-western suburbs of the city. Despite German radio broadcasts claiming to have captured Warsaw, the initial enemy attack was repelled and soon afterwards Warsaw was placed under siege. The siege lasted until September 28, when the Polish garrison, commanded under General Walerian Czuma, officially capitulated. The following day approximately 140,000 Polish troops left the city and were taken as prisoners of war. On October 1 the Wehrmacht entered Warsaw, which started a period of German occupation that lasted until the devastating Warsaw Uprising and later until January 17, 1945, when the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; troops abandoned the city due to the advance of Soviet forces.

Around 18,000 civilians of Warsaw perished during the siege. As a result of the air bombardments, 10% of the city&#x27;s buildings were entirely destroyed and further 40% were heavily damaged.

== History ==

=== Heavy bombardments ===
From the very first hours of World War II, Warsaw, the capital of Poland, was a target of an unrestricted aerial bombardment campaign initiated by the German Luftwaffe, which was controlled by Hermann Göring. Apart from the military facilities such as infantry barracks and the Okęcie airport and aircraft factory, the German pilots also targeted civilian facilities such as water works, hospitals, market places and schools, which resulted in heavy human casualties that possibly led to the early surrender by lowering of morale of the Polish army defending the city.

The anti-aircraft defence of the capital was divided into active and passive parts. The former was composed mostly of units of the Pursuit Brigade (&quot;Brygada Pościgowa&quot;) under Colonel Stefan Pawlikowski, and anti-aircraft artillery and anti-aircraft machine guns detachments under Colonel Kazimierz Baran. The Pursuit Brigade was equipped with 54 fighter aircraft, mostly the obsolete PZL P.7 and PZL P.11 types. The AA artillery had 86 pieces of anti-aircraft artillery, as well as an unknown number of other anti-aircraft machine guns. The latter was composed mostly of fire-fighter brigades and volunteers and was supervised by Colonel Tadeusz Bogdanowicz and Julian Kulski, the deputy president.

Initially the air defence of Warsaw was fairly successful and by September 6, 1939, the Pursuit Brigade had shot down 43 enemy aircraft, while anti-aircraft artillery had shot down a similar number of enemy bombers. There were also 9 unconfirmed victories and 20 damaged enemy planes. However, the brigade also suffered heavy losses, and by September 7 it had lost over 38 pieces of equipment, or approximately 70% of its initial strength, which greatly contributed to an early surrender.

The AA defence started to crumble when on September 5 by order of the military authorities 11 AA batteries were withdrawn from Warsaw towards the eastern cities of Lublin, Brześć and Lwów. Furthermore, as the war progressed, the German high command redirected more bombers to attack the city, especially the historical old town, the Warsaw Royal Castle and other iconic monuments, significant to the Polish nation and its capital. At the peak of the initial bombing campaign on September 10, there were more than 70 German bombers above Warsaw. During that day, nicknamed &quot;Bloody Sunday&quot;, there were 17 consecutive bombing raids.

=== Eve of the battle ===
On September 3, the forces of German 4th Panzer Division under Major General Georg-Hans Reinhardt managed to break through positions of the Polish Łódź Army near Częstochowa and started their march towards the river Vistula and Warsaw. The same day Polish Commander in Chief, Marshal of Poland Edward Rydz-Śmigły ordered the creation of an improvised &quot;Command of the Defence of Warsaw&quot; (&quot;Dowództwo Obrony Warszawy&quot;). General Walerian Czuma, the head of the Border Guard (Straż Graniczna), became its commander and Colonel Tadeusz Tomaszewski its Chief of Staff.

Initially the forces under the command of General Czuma were very limited. Most of the city authorities withdrew together with a large part of the police forces, fire fighters and the military garrison. Warsaw was left with only four battalions of infantry and one battery of artillery. Also, the spokesman of the garrison of Warsaw issued a communique in which he ordered all young men to leave Warsaw. To coordinate civilian efforts and counter the panic that started in Warsaw, Czuma appointed the president of Warsaw Stefan Starzyński as the Civilian Commissar of Warsaw. Starzyński started to organize the &quot;Civil Guard&quot; to replace the evacuated police forces and the fire fighters. He also ordered all members of the city&#x27;s administration to return to their posts. In his daily radio releases he asked all civilians to construct barricades and anti-tank barriers on the streets and at the outskirts of Warsaw. On September 7 the 40th Infantry Regiment &quot;Children of Lwów&quot; (commanded by Lt.Col. Józef Kalandyk) – transiting through Warsaw towards previously assigned positions with the Army Pomorze – was stopped and joined the defense of Warsaw.

=== Initial clashes ===

The field fortifications were constructed mostly to the west of the city limits. Gradually, the forces of General Walerian Czuma were reinforced with volunteers composed of mostly civilians, including women and children, as well as rearguard troops and units withdrawing from the front. On the morning of September 8, the suburbs of Grójec, Radziejowice, Nadarzyn, Raszyn and Piaseczno were captured by forces of German XVI Panzer Corps. At exactly 5pm the forces of the German 4th Panzer Division attempted an assault on Warsaw&#x27;s western borough of Ochota. The assault was repulsed and the German forces suffered heavy casualties with many Panzer I and Panzer II tanks lost. The following day, the 4th Panzer Division was reinforced with artillery and motorised infantry, and began another assault towards Ochota and Wola. The well-placed Polish 75 mm anti-tank guns firing at point-blank range, and the barricades erected on main streets, successfully managed to repel all initiated assaults and unexpected attacks.

One of the barricades erected at the crossing of Opaczewska and Grójecka streets was defended by the 4th company of the 40th &quot;Children of Lwów&quot; Regiment. After the war a monument was built on the spot to commemorate the battle. On several occasions lack of armament had to be made up for by ingenuity. One of the streets leading towards the city center was covered with turpentine from a nearby factory. When the German tanks approached, the liquid was ignited and the tanks were destroyed without a single shot fired.

The German forces suffered heavy casualties and had to retreat westward to help thwart the Bzura River counter-offensive. The 4th Panzer Division alone lost approximately 80 tanks out of the approximately 220 that took part in the assault.

=== Second phase ===
By then General Czuma had gathered an equivalent of 2 infantry divisions under his command. His forces were supported by 64 pieces of artillery and 33 tanks (27 of Vickers E, 7-TP and R-35 and 6 TK-3 and TKS tankettes). On September 8 the Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Edward Rydz-Śmigły ordered the creation of an improvised Warsaw Army (&quot;Armia Warszawa&quot;) under General Juliusz Rómmel. The newly created force was composed of the forces defending Warsaw and Modlin Fortress, as well as all Polish units defending the Narew and the Vistula between Warsaw and Pilica river lines. General Czuma continued to be the commander of the Warsaw Defence Force, which he split into two sectors: East (Praga district) under Lt.Col. Julian Janowski and West under Colonel Marian Porwit.

The Army Poznań commanded by General Tadeusz Kutrzeba, and Army Pomorze under General Władysław Bortnowski started an offensive on the left flank of the German forces advancing towards Warsaw. As a result of this offensive that later became known as the Battle of Bzura, German commanders withdrew the 4th Panzer Division and sent it to counter the Polish threat near Kutno. Its positions were replaced by forces of a weakened German 31st Infantry Division. In this sense the desperate attempt to buy time for organising a defence of Warsaw was a success. The defenders of the city were joined by various units of the routed Prusy Army. In addition, several new units were created in Warsaw out of reserve centres of Warsaw-based 8th Polish Infantry Division and 36th &quot;Academic Legion&quot; Infantry Regiment.

On September 11 the Polish Commander in Chief ordered that Warsaw was to be defended at all costs, despite the possible heavy casualties and civilian losses. The following day the forces of German 3rd Army (under General Georg von Küchler) broke through Polish lines along the Narew river and started its march southwards to cut off Warsaw from the east. It was assaulted by cavalry units under Władysław Anders, but after heavy fighting the Polish counter-offensive failed and the forces were withdrawn to the south. Other Polish units fighting under General Juliusz Zulauf near the Narew River area retreated and reached Warsaw on September 14. They were incorporated as the core of the defence forces of the borough of Praga district.

On September 15 the German forces reached Warsaw from the east and the capital of Poland was under siege. Only a strip of land along the Vistula leading towards the Kampinos Forest and Modlin Fortress was still controlled by Polish forces. The defence of the Modlin fortress was an important relief to the defenders of Warsaw.

=== Siege of Warsaw ===


On 15 September, the German Third Army from Army Group North attacked Praga. They attacked from both sides of the Vistula.

After heavy fighting for the Grochów area the German 23rd Infantry Regiment was annihilated by the Polish defenders of the 21st &quot;Children of Warsaw&quot; Infantry Regiment under colonel (later promoted to general) Stanisław Sosabowski.

After the Battle of Bzura ended, the remnants of the Poznań Army and the Pomorze Army broke through the German encirclement and arrived in Warsaw and Modlin between 18–21 September from the Kampinos Forest. After that the forces of the defenders amounted to approximately 140,000 soldiers. The German forces preparing for an all-out assault numbered 13 divisions with one thousand artillery pieces. On September 22 the last lines of communication between Warsaw and Modlin were cut by German forces reaching the Vistula.

As preparation for the storming, the city was shelled day and night with artillery and aerial bombardment. Among the guns used were heavy railway guns and mortars. Two entire air fleets took part in the air raids against both civilian and military targets. After September 20 the forces on the eastern bank of the Vistula started daily attacks on the Praga suburb. All were successfully counter-attacked by the Polish forces. On September 24 all German units concentrated around Warsaw were put under command of general Johannes Blaskowitz

An initial German attack took place on 23 September, which was successfully repulsed. On September 25 the next attack started with an artillery and air bombardment, including 1,200 aircraft. This so-called &quot;Black Monday&quot; became a legend in the history of Warsaw.

The following day in the early morning the general assault was started on all fronts of surrounded Warsaw. Western parts of the city were attacked by 5 German divisions (10th, 18th, 19th, 31st and 46th) while the eastern part was attacked by 4 divisions (11th, 32nd, 61st and 217th). The attack was supported by approximately 70 batteries of field artillery, 80 batteries of heavy artillery and two entire air fleets (1st and 4th), which bombarded the city continuously causing heavy losses in the civilian population. On 26 September, the Forts of Mokotów, Dąbrowski and Czerniaków fell to the German assault.

=== Capitulation and surrender ===

General Czuma managed to gather enough forces and war material to successfully defend the city for several weeks longer. However, the situation of the civilian inhabitants of Warsaw became increasingly tragic. Constant bombardment of civilian facilities, lack of food and medical supplies resulted in heavy casualties among the city&#x27;s population.

The water works were destroyed by German bombers and all boroughs of Warsaw experienced a lack of both potable water and water with which to extinguish the fires caused by the constant bombardment. Also, the strategic situation became very difficult. The Soviet Union&#x27;s entry into the war and lack of support from the Western Allies made the defence of the city pointless and heavily demotivated the volunteers in participating in any further military actions.

On September 26, Army Warsaw General Juliusz Rómmel, started capitulation talks with the German commander. On September 27, at 12:00 a cease fire agreement was signed and all fighting halted. Soon afterwards, Warsaw capitulated. Several units declined to put down their weapons and cease fire, and their commanding officers had to be visited by generals Czuma and Rómmel personally.

On September 29, the garrison of Warsaw started to hide or destroy their heavy armament. Some of the hidden war material was later used during the Warsaw Uprising. On September 30, the evacuation of Polish forces to German prisoner of war camps started and, the following day, German units entered the capital. The city was occupied until January 17, 1945.

<doc id="850994" wikidata="Q2034182" url="?curid=850994" title="Stream gradient">
<text>Stream gradient (or stream slope) is the grade (or slope) of a stream. It is measured by the ratio of drop in elevation and horizontal distance. It is a dimensionless quantity, usually expressed in units of meters per kilometer (m/km) or feet per mile (ft/mi); it may also be expressed in percent (%).
The world average river reach slope is 2.6 m/km or 0.26%;
a slope smaller than 1% and greater than 4% is considered gentle and steep, respectively.

Stream gradient may change along the stream course.
An average gradient can be defined, known as the relief ratio, which gives the average drop in elevation per unit length of river.
The calculation is the difference in elevation between the river&#x27;s source and the river terminus (confluence or mouth) divided by the total length of the river or stream.

==Hydrology and geology==
A high gradient indicates a steep slope and rapid flow of water (i.e. more ability to erode); where as a low gradient indicates a more nearly level stream bed and sluggishly moving water, that may be able to carry only small amounts of very fine sediment. High gradient streams tend to have steep, narrow V-shaped valleys, and are referred to as young streams. Low gradient streams have wider and less rugged valleys, with a tendency for the stream to meander. Many rivers involve, to some extent, a flattening of the river gradient as approach the terminus at sea level.

==Fluvial erosion==
A stream that flows upon a uniformly erodible substrate will tend to have a steep gradient near its source, and a low gradient nearing zero as it reaches its base level. Of course, a uniform substrate would be rare in nature; hard layers of rock along the way may establish a temporary base level, followed by a high gradient, or even a waterfall, as softer materials are encountered below the hard layer.

Human dams, glaciation, changes in sea level, and many other factors can also change the &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;natural&quot; gradient pattern.

==Topographic mapping==
On topographic maps, stream gradient can be easily approximated if the scale of the map and the contour intervals are known. Contour lines form a V-shape on the map, pointing upstream. By counting the number of lines that cross a certain segment of a stream, multiplying this by the contour interval, and dividing that quantity by the length of the stream segment, one obtains an approximation to the stream gradient.

Because stream gradient is customarily given in feet per 1000 feet, one should then measure the amount a stream segment rises and the length of the stream segment in feet, then multiply feet per foot gradient by 1000. For example, if one measures a scale mile along the stream length, and counts three contour lines crossed on a map with ten-foot contours, the gradient is approximately 5.7 feet per 1000 feet, a fairly steep gradient.

<text>The Aerocar is an American automobile that was built from 1906 until 1908 in Detroit, Michigan. Backed by Henry Ford&#x27;s former partner, coal merchant Alexander Malcomson, the short-lived company offered an air-cooled four-cylinder luxury car which sold for $2,800.

The factory was sold to Hudson Motor Car Company.

==History==
The Aerocar Motor Company was founded in late 1905 by entrepreneur Alexander Malcolmson, who was also the primary financial backer of the Ford Motor Company in 1903. The two had differing views on serving the marketplace with Malcomson focusing on profitability from more expensive cars in contrast to Henry Ford looking to develop cars for the low-priced market.

The company&#x27;s name refers to the car&#x27;s use of an air-cooled engine. An order was placed with Reeves Pulley Company to deliver 500 four-cylinder, engines. A factory was built in Detroit at the corner of Mack Avenue and Beaufait Street. &quot;The Detroit News&quot; published an article on 3 December 1905, about Malcomson, the new Aerocar Company, and its plan to produce 500 touring cars during the year. This brought a response on 5 December 1905 from Ford&#x27;s board of directors calling for Malcomson&#x27;s resignation from the board.

Production began in February 1906 for a high-end car to compete with the automobiles on the market at that time, including Ford&#x27;s Model K, and Aerocar reserved spaces at the major 1906 auto shows. By April, the company reported selling one car per week and was planning to build three per week. News reports during December 1905 boasted that Aerocar was manufacturing four cars per week, mostly the runabout version. By April 1907, the company announced intentions of buying a large office building near Woodward in Detroit. High fixed costs and low demand for its cars were factors for the company to file for bankruptcy on August 6, 1907, and the process of liquidation during October and November of that year included the sale of 25 new Aerocars &quot;at half of production cost.&quot; A lawsuit in 1909 by Reeves against Aerocar&#x27;s failure to fulfill its 500 engine contract indicated that only 319 were taken. Moreover, the $325 price was high for an &quot;unremarkable, 1905 technology engine.&quot;

Malcolmson went back to the more lucrative coal business.

The Aerocar factory at Mack Avenue and Beaufait Street was leased in April 1909 to the Hudson Motor Car Company. The new company experienced rapid growth of its Model 20. Demand for that first 1910 model exceeded production capacity at the former Aerocar plant &quot;in a matter of months.&quot; Hudson had Albert Kahn design a new factory that was built a few miles away at East Jefferson and Conner. This facility needed to be doubled in size in a couple of years and was producing 100 cars per day. Manufacturing of Hudson cars continued until August 1954 and the plant was purchased by General Motors in 1956 for metal fabrication of Cadillacs, but the facility was demolished in 1959–1960. The original Aerocar factory appeared to be &quot;reasonably well maintained&quot; as of 2012, and &quot;some very old lettering on the east side of the building had the words &quot;The Aerocar Company&quot; in white paint on the red brick.&quot;

==Models==
Trade promotion of the new Aerocar described it &quot;The Car of today, tomorrow and the years to come. Built by practical men&quot; with numerous claims as to its features as well as that &quot;the dealer who has a selling agency for the Aerocar will have a gold mine.&quot;
The first model priced at $2,800 was for a touring car equipped with an air-cooled engine with a three-speed sliding gear transmission, standard steering, tubular front axle, and single battery/timer/coil ignition.

The Model A was powered by a Reeves 24-horsepower, four-cylinder, air-cooled engine. It came with a &quot;Standard Extension Black Top&quot; and two gas headlights as well as &quot;Full Oil Lamp Equipment.&quot; The automobile had a Prest-o-Lite tank, Hartford shock absorbers, Gabriel horn, and a speedometer. It also came with an extra tire and inner tube in a waterproof case with attaching irons, robe-rail and a footrest in tonneau. A toolbox with full equipment was attached to the exterior running board. The air-cooled engine was later replaced by a Reeves water-cooled model.

Aerocar continued to build less expensive autos. Aerocar continued to use the 20 hp air-cooled Reeves engines in both the Model D and roadster, adding a 40 hp water-cooled touring in 1907 and 1908. The larger touring initially sold for $2,750 in 1907, then $2,200 in 1908.

Near the end, the more conventional Model F with a water-cooled 45 hp Rutenber engine was introduced, but it was too late.

The remaining cars were sold in 1908, with a grand total of approximately 300 Aerocars built.

<doc id="850998" wikidata="Q973551" url="?curid=850998" title="Protest Warrior">
<text>Protest Warrior was a conservative political activist group. It was formed in 2003 by Alan Lipton and Kfir Alfia in Austin, Texas. The group is primarily known for organizing counter-protests in favor of the Iraq war. Its slogan is &quot;Fighting the left...doing it right&quot;. As of 2015, it was inactive.

==History==
In February 2003, Alfia was working as a computer chip designer in San Francisco when he reunited with Alan Lipton, a childhood friend, and crashed an anti-war protest in San Francisco on February 16, 2003.

The two carried their own signs. Alfia&#x27;s sign showed a woman in a burqa tied to a pole with a leash around her neck, and was captioned &quot;Protect Islamic Property Rights Against Western Imperialism. Say No To War!&quot; Lipton&#x27;s sign said, &quot;Saddam Only Kills His Own People. It&#x27;s None Of Our Business.&quot; Conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh covered their counter-protest on his website and complimented the group on its work.

==Motivation==
Seeing liberals as &quot;morally and politically bankrupt,&quot; and as having a monopoly of media attention, Protest Warrior believes that the voices of the &quot;left&quot; are &quot;heard disproportionately, demoralizing our troops and emboldening dictators around the world.&quot;

== Method ==
The group&#x27;s primary method of activism is crashing liberal events, chiefly anti-war protest marches and counter-demonstrating within their ranks. For instance, Protest Warriors attended rallies against Halliburton, Caterpillar Inc., Israel, and U.S. President George W. Bush, displaying support for these entities. When doing so, the Protest Warriors carry large signs often designed to appear similar to those held by the participants, enabling them to mingle until observers are close enough to read their signs&#x27; fine-print.

==Website==

The group maintains a website as an organizing and information hub. It also acts as a source for the many slogans and signs presented by Protest Warriors at protests, as well as offering a sign creation tutorial to registered members. The website also includes an online shop. The website also featured numerous forums, but they were shut down without explanation on September 13, 2006, and currently return a HTTP 404 error.

The website has been the target of various attempts at politically motivated hacking in the course of its existence. Most notably, in January, 2005 the site was hacked by Chicago native Jeremy Hammond, affiliated with the website HackThisSite.org, to steal credit card numbers and shut down the web server. Hammond was indicted in May, 2006, and sentenced to two years in prison on December 7, 2006.

==Past operations==
Local and National chapters of Protest Warrior have carried out operations in the United States and abroad. Examples of past Protest Warrior operations include:

*On January 20, 2005, &quot;Operation Hail to the Chief&quot; drew thirteen Protest Warriors to Washington D.C. to oppose those protesting the second inauguration of President George W. Bush.
*During the 2004 Republican National Convention, a group of Protest Warriors staged a counterprotest, &quot;Operation Liberty Rising&quot;.
*On August 27, 2005, a group of three Protest Warriors led by co-founder Kfir Alfia was the target of animosity at a conservative counter-Cindy Sheehan rally in Crawford, Texas. Despite the Protest Warriors&#x27; assurances that they were on the same side, the conservative protesters repeatedly shouted at them, destroyed the Protest Warrior signs, and forced the Protest Warriors to leave the rally, mistaking them for anti-war protesters.
*During the Sept. 24, 2005 Anti-War Protests in Washington D.C., Protest Warrior, along with Move America Forward, RightMarch and Free Republic counter-protested those opposed to the war, and also demonstrated in support of the war and troops.

==Current status, future campaigns ==
The current status of Protest Warrior is unknown:

* &quot;ProtestWarrior, LLC&quot;, formed as a limited liability company in Texas in 2003, is currently listed by the state as &quot;Not In Good Standing&quot;, meaning that Protest Warrior has failed to file its annual paperwork and pay due taxes/fees.
* The main discussion forums for PW closed in September 2006. The public forums were reopened in August 2007 and then subsequently went offline again sometime in 2008.
* On February 21, 2007 a blog was started, announcing a &quot;Protest Warrior 2.0&quot; initiative aimed at revitalizing the organization. Seven articles were written over the span of seven months, with the last entry being dated August 15, 2007. 
* On February 19, 2009 the website was offline again and then returned three months later. The website is currently accessible, but the discussion forums, donation solicitation page, and &quot;HQ&quot; sections are either non-functional or have been entirely removed (HTTP Error 404). The latest &quot;News &amp; Updates&quot; section announces a book publication in June, 2007.

<text>Aerocar International&#x27;s Aerocar (often called the Taylor Aerocar) is an American roadable aircraft designed and built by Moulton Taylor in Longview, Washington in 1949. Although six examples were made, it never entered large-scale production. It is considered one of the first practical flying cars.

==Design and development==
Taylor began designing a roadable aircraft in 1946. During a trip to Delaware, he met inventor Robert E. Fulton, Jr., who had designed an earlier roadable airplane, the Airphibian, with detachable wings. Taylor&#x27;s prototype, the Aerocar, utilized folding wings that allowed the road vehicle to be converted into flight mode in five minutes by one person. When the rear license plate was flipped up, the operator could connect the propeller shaft and attach a pusher propeller. The same engine drove the front wheels through a three-speed manual transmission. When operated as an aircraft, the road transmission was left in neutral (though backing up during taxiing was possible by the using the reverse gear). On the road, the wings and tail unit were towed behind the vehicle. Taylor also put the propeller on the back of the car so it did not have to be removed when the Aerocar went on the road. Aerocars could drive up to 60 miles per hour and had a top airspeed of 110 miles per hour. An early-1950s &quot;Industry on Parade&quot; film shows Taylor driving and piloting his Aerocar, as well as footage of manufacture.

==Testing and certification==
The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) granted the Aerocar civil certification in 1956, and Taylor reached a deal with Ling-Temco-Vought for serial production provided he could obtain 500 orders. When he was able to obtain only half that number, production plans ended. Only six examples were built. One is still flying as of 2008, and Taylor rebuilt another into the only Aerocar III.

==Produced examples==
There are four Aerocar Is, one Aerocar II, and one Aerocar I that was rebuilt as Aerocar III.

===&quot;N4994P&quot;===

&quot;N4994P&quot; (1949, originally &quot;N31214&quot;) is yellow with silver wings. It was the very first Aerocar and is on display at the EAA AirVenture Museum in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. It is maintained in flying condition but is not flown.

===&quot;N101D&quot;===

&quot;N101D&quot; (1954) is owned by Greg Herrick&#x27;s Yellowstone Aviation Inc. It is maintained in flying condition and is on display at the Golden Wings Flying Museum located on the south west side of the Anoka County-Blaine Airport in Minneapolis. This aircraft is featured flying overhead on the cover on the book &quot;A Drive In the Clouds&quot; by Jake Schultz. In December 2011, N101D was being offered for sale at an asking price of USD1.25 million.

===&quot;N102D&quot;===
&quot;N102D&quot; (1960) is yellow and green. The last Aerocar built and the only one still flying, it is owned by Ed Sweeney and is on display at the Kissimmee Air Museum located at the Kissimmee Gateway Airport in Kissimmee, Florida. N102D was the only Aerocar built with the larger O-360 Lycoming powerplant giving it much better performance. It is the only road legal and driven Aerocar left. It is currently flown by the owner&#x27;s son Sean Sweeney. It was previously owned by actor Bob Cummings, who used it in his TV sitcom &quot;The New Bob Cummings Show&quot;. It also appeared on the TV show &quot;James May&#x27;s Big Ideas&quot; on BBC2, aired in September 2008. Inspired by this vehicle, Ed Sweeney began development of the Aerocar 2000.

===&quot;N103D&quot;===
&quot;N103D&quot; (1956) has been repainted to red/black with red wings. It has been owned by Carl Felling and Marilyn Stine of Grand Junction, Colorado since 1981. It once flew Fidel Castro&#x27;s brother, Raúl Castro, in Cuba. The aircraft was damaged after landing on a rural road when a startled horse ran in front of the wing. A temporary fix was made using a flattened five-gallon can, and the aircraft made it to Boston without incident, for more comprehensive repairs 

From 1961 to 1963 the Aerocar was operated under contract between Star Stations (Don Burden) and Wik&#x27;s Air Service, Inc. It was used as a traffic-watch (AIRWATCH) aircraft for KISN (910AM) radio station in Portland, Oregon where it was flown by &quot;Scotty Wright&quot; (Scotty Wright was the alias used by the acting pilot of the Aerocar during traffic-watch transmissions). Several pilots provided the AIRWATCH service beginning with World War II veteran pilot Guilford Wikander, President of Wik&#x27;s Air Service, Inc. Guilford was followed in order by his sister Ruth Wikander, W. John Jacob, Wayne Nutsch and Alan Maris. Scotty Wright reports Nutsch having 350 flying hours in N103D performing AIRWATCH duty. Traffic reporting was from 7:00 AM–8:30 AM and 4:30 PM–6:00 PM. During the Aerocar&#x27;s AIRWATCH missions, it was painted white with red hearts and had the letters KISN on the top and bottom of the wings.

The aircraft was equipped with an emergency police/fire receiver for use in reporting emergency events on KISN radio stations broadcast. When flown for KISN it was based at Wik&#x27;s Air Service, Hillsboro Airport (HIO), Hillsboro Oregon. On one of its more eventful flights for KISN it survived the Columbus Day Storm of 1962 without damage after its evening traffic reporting flight. W. John Jacob was piloting the aircraft at that particular time and should be credited with the successful landing during extreme wind conditions (perhaps more than 100 mph), but Ruth Wikander, who was in the aircraft to assist him, received the acclaim. Ruth Wikander was an active member of the 99&#x27;s, the International Organization of Women Pilots. In 1962 Ruth Wikander drove the Aerocar as an automobile while trailering the wings in the annual Portland Rose Festival parade. The Aerocar was an integral part of KISN Radio along with photos of famous rock musicians and KISN DJ&#x27;s of the times.

Last flown in 1977, the aircraft is no longer airworthy and has been in storage ever since. It is currently listed for sale for the price of US$2.2 million.

===&quot;N107D&quot; (Aerocar II)===

&quot;N107D&quot; (1966) is an Aerocar Aero-Plane, or Aerocar II. It is not a roadable aircraft but is based on the original Aerocar design. It uses the wing and tail section from the Aerocar. It seats four and is powered by a 150 hp IO-320 Lycoming engine. Only a single example was built. As of 2006, it was located in Colorado Springs, Colorado owned by Ed Sweeney, the owner of N102D.

===&quot;N4345F&quot; (Aerocar III)===
The sixth Aerocar (&quot;N4345F&quot;), Moulton Taylor&#x27;s final flying car effort, is red with silver wings. It began as one of the original Aerocars, which Taylor bought back from a customer when it was damaged in an accident on the ground in the 1960s. Taylor rebuilt it as the Aerocar III, replacing the original cabin with a sleeker, more streamlined front-wheel drive version (although it still &quot;fell far short&quot; of the sporty lines Taylor wanted to give it[reference?]). The automotive unit weighs 1,100 lbs and is powered by a 140 hp Lycoming O-320. The trailer wheels for the wings in towed configuration are deployable from a compartment on the outside of each wing&#x27;s leading edge. The propeller driveshaft contains fine ball bearings that swing outward with centrifugal force, creating stiffness and damping. The four retractable wheels are extended for takeoff and landing, partly retracted for road travel, and fully retracted in flight. Taylor attracted some interest from Ford in the Aerocar III, but no production resulted. The single prototype is displayed at Seattle&#x27;s Museum of Flight with the registration &quot;N100D&quot;.

<doc id="851008" wikidata="Q1471710" url="?curid=851008" title="Black hole information paradox">
<text>The black hole information paradox is a paradox that appears when the predictions of quantum mechanics and general relativity are combined. The theory of general relativity predicts the existence of black holes that are regions of spacetime from which nothing—not even light—can escape. In the 1970s, Stephen Hawking applied the semiclassical approach of quantum field theory in curved spacetime to such systems and found that an isolated black hole would emit a form of radiation (now called Hawking radiation in his honor). He also argued that the detailed form of the radiation would be independent of the initial state of the black hole, and depend only on its mass, electric charge and angular momentum.

The information paradox appears when one considers a process in which a black hole is formed through a physical process and then evaporates away entirely through Hawking radiation. Hawking&#x27;s calculation suggests that the final state of radiation would retain information only about the total mass, electric charge and angular momentum of the initial state. Since many different states can have the same mass, charge and angular momentum, this suggests that many initial physical states could evolve into the same final state. Therefore, information about the details of the initial state would be permanently lost; however, this violates a core precept of both classical and quantum physics: that, &quot;in principle only,&quot; the state of a system at one point in time should determine its state at any other time. Specifically, in quantum mechanics the state of the system is encoded by its wave function. The evolution of the wave function is determined by a unitary operator, and unitarity implies that the wave function at any instant of time can be used to determine the wave function either in the past or the future. In 1993, Don Page argued that if a black hole starts in a pure quantum state and evaporates completely by a unitary process, the von Neumann entropy of the Hawking radiation initially increases and then decreases back to zero when the black hole has disappeared. This is called the Page curve.

It is now generally believed that information is preserved in black-hole evaporation. For many researchers, deriving the Page curve is synonymous with solving the black hole information puzzle. But views differ as to precisely how Hawking&#x27;s original semiclassical calculation should be corrected. In recent years, several extensions of the original paradox have been explored. Taken together, these puzzles about black hole evaporation have implications for how gravity and quantum mechanics must be combined. The information paradox remains an active field of research in quantum gravity.

== Relevant principles ==
In quantum mechanics, the evolution of the state is governed by the Schrödinger equation. The Schrödinger equation obeys two principles that are relevant to the paradox—quantum determinism, which means that given a present wave function, its future changes are uniquely determined by the evolution operator, and reversibility, which refers to the fact that the evolution operator has an inverse, meaning that the past wave functions are similarly unique. The combination of the two means that information must always be preserved. In this context &quot;information&quot; means all the details of the state, and the statement that information must be preserved means that details corresponding to an earlier time can always be reconstructed at a later time.

Mathematically, the Schrödinger equation implies that the wavefunction at a time t1 can be related to the wavefunction at a time t2 by means of a unitary operator.
formula_1
Since the unitary operator is bijective, the wavefunction at t2 can be obtained from the wavefunction at t1 and vice versa.

The reversibility of time evolution described above applies only at the &quot;microscopic level&quot;, since the wavefunction provides a complete description of the state. It should not be conflated with thermodynamic irreversibility. A process may appear irreversible if one keeps track only of the system&#x27;s coarse-grained features and not of its microscopic details, as is usually done in thermodynamics. But at the microscopic level, the principles of quantum mechanics imply that every process is completely reversible.

Starting in the mid-1970s, Stephen Hawking and Jacob Bekenstein put forward theoretical arguments that suggested that black-hole evaporation loses information, and is therefore inconsistent with unitarity. Crucially, these arguments were meant to apply at the microscopic level and suggested that black-hole evaporation is not only thermodynamically but microscopically irreversible. This contradicts the principle of unitarity described above and leads to the information paradox. Since the paradox suggested that quantum mechanics would be violated by black-hole formation and evaporation, Hawking framed the paradox in terms of the &quot;breakdown of predictability in gravitational collapse&quot;.

The arguments for microscopic irreversibility were backed by Hawking&#x27;s calculation of the spectrum of radiation that isolated black holes emit. This calculation utilized the framework of general relativity and quantum field theory. The calculation of Hawking radiation is performed at the black hole horizon and does not account for the backreaction of spacetime geometry; for a large enough black hole the curvature at the horizon is small and therefore both these theories should be valid. Hawking relied on the no-hair theorem to arrive at the conclusion that radiation emitted by black holes would depend only on a few macroscopic parameters, such as the black hole&#x27;s mass, charge, and spin, but not on the details of the initial state that led to the formation of the black hole. In addition, the argument for information loss relied on the causal structure of the black hole spacetime, which suggests that information in the interior should not affect any observation in the exterior, including observations performed on the radiation the black hole emits. If so, the region of spacetime outside the black hole would lose information about the state of the interior after black-hole evaporation, leading to the loss of information.

Today, some physicists believe that the holographic principle (specifically the AdS/CFT duality) demonstrates that Hawking&#x27;s conclusion was incorrect, and that information is in fact preserved. Moreover, recent analyses indicate that in semiclassical gravity the information loss paradox cannot be formulated in a self-consistent manner due to the impossibility of simultaneously realizing all of the necessary assumptions required for its formulation.

== Black hole evaporation ==
=== Hawking radiation ===
In 1973–1975, Stephen Hawking showed that black holes should slowly radiate away energy, and he later argued that this leads to a contradiction with unitarity. Hawking used the classical no-hair theorem to argue that the form of this radiation—called Hawking radiation—would be completely independent of the initial state of the star or matter that collapsed to form the black hole. He argued that the process of radiation would continue until the black hole had evaporated completely. At the end of this process, all the initial energy in the black hole would have been transferred to the radiation. But, according to Hawking&#x27;s argument, the radiation would retain no information about the initial state and therefore information about the initial state would be lost.

More specifically, Hawking argued that the pattern of radiation emitted from the black hole would be random, with a probability distribution controlled only by the black hole&#x27;s initial temperature, charge, and angular momentum, not by the initial state of the collapse. The state produced by such a probabilistic process is called a mixed state in quantum mechanics. Therefore, Hawking argued that if the star or material that collapsed to form the black hole started in a specific pure quantum state, the process of evaporation would transform the pure state into a mixed state. This is inconsistent with the unitarity of quantum-mechanical evolution discussed above.

The loss of information can be quantified in terms of the change in the fine-grained von Neumann entropy of the state. A pure state is assigned a von Neumann entropy of 0, whereas a mixed state has a finite entropy. The unitary evolution of a state according to Schrödinger&#x27;s equation preserves the entropy. Therefore Hawking&#x27;s argument suggests that the process of black-hole evaporation cannot be described within the framework of unitary evolution. Although this paradox is often phrased in terms of quantum mechanics, the evolution from a pure state to a mixed state is also inconsistent with Liouville&#x27;s theorem in classical physics (see e.g.).

In equations, Hawking showed that if one denotes the creation and annihilation operators at a frequency formula_2 for a quantum field propagating in the black-hole background by formula_3 and formula_4 then the expectation value of the product of these operators in the state formed by the collapse of a black hole would satisfy formula_5 where is the Boltzmann constant and is the temperature of the black hole. (See, for example, section 2.2 of.) This formula has two important aspects. The first is that the form of the radiation depends only on a single parameter, temperature, even though the initial state of the black hole cannot be characterized by one parameter. Second, the formula implies that the black hole radiates mass at a rate given by formula_6 where is constant related to fundamental constants, including the Stefan–Boltzmann constant and certain properties of the black hole spacetime called its greybody factors.

The temperature of the black hole is in turn dependent on its mass, charge, and angular momentum. For a Schwarzschild Black Hole the temperature is given by
formula_7
This means that if the black hole starts out with an initial mass formula_8, it evaporates completely in a time proportional to formula_9.

The important aspect of these formulas is that they suggest that the final gas of radiation formed through this process depends only on the black hole&#x27;s temperature and is independent of other details of the initial state. This leads to the following paradox. Consider two distinct initial states that collapse to form a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass. Even though the states were distinct at first, since the mass (and hence the temperature) of the black holes is the same, they will emit the same Hawking radiation. Once they evaporate completely, in both cases, one will be left with a featureless gas of radiation. This gas cannot be used to distinguish between the two initial states, and therefore information has been lost.

=== Page curve ===
During the same time period in the 1970s, Don Page was a doctoral student of Stephen Hawking. He objected to Hawking&#x27;s reasoning leading to the paradox above, initially on the basis of violation of CPT symmetry. In 1993, Page focused on the combined system of a black hole with its Hawking radiation as one entangled system, a bipartite system, evolving over the lifetime of the black hole evaporation. Lacking the ability to make a full quantum analysis, he nonetheless made a powerful observation: If a black hole starts in a pure quantum state and evaporates completely by a unitary process, the von Neumann entropy or entanglement entropy of the Hawking radiation initially increases from zero and then must decrease back to zero when the black hole to which the radiation is entangled has totally evaporated. This is known as the Page curve; and the time corresponding to the maximum or turnover point of the curve, which occurs at about half the black-hole lifetime, is called the Page time. In short, if black hole evaporation is unitary, then the radiation entanglement entropy follows the Page curve. After the Page time, correlations appear and the radiation becomes increasingly information rich.

Recent progress in deriving the Page curve for unitary black hole evaporation is a significant step towards finding both a resolution to the information paradox and a more general understanding of unitarity in quantum gravity. Many researchers consider deriving the Page curve as synonymous with solving the black hole information paradox.

== Popular culture ==
The information paradox has received coverage in the popular media and has been described in popular-science books. Some of this coverage resulted from a widely publicized bet made in 1997 between John Preskill on the one hand with Hawking and Kip Thorne on the other that information was not lost in black holes. The scientific debate on the paradox was described in Leonard Susskind&#x27;s 2008 book &quot;The Black Hole War&quot;. (The book carefully notes that the &#x27;war&#x27; was purely a scientific one, and that, at a personal level, the participants remained friends.) Susskind writes that Hawking was eventually persuaded that black-hole evaporation was unitary by the holographic principle, which was first proposed by &#x27;t Hooft, further developed by Susskind, and later given a precise string theory interpretation by the AdS/CFT correspondence. In 2004, Hawking also conceded the 1997 bet, paying Preskill with a baseball encyclopedia &quot;from which information can be retrieved at will&quot;. Thorne refused to concede.

== Solutions ==

Since the 1997 proposal of the AdS/CFT correspondence, the predominant belief among physicists is that information is indeed preserved in black hole evaporation. There are broadly two main streams of thought about how this happens. Within what might broadly be termed the &quot;string theory community&quot;, the dominant idea is that Hawking radiation is not precisely thermal but receives quantum correlations that encode information about the black hole&#x27;s interior. This viewpoint has been the subject of extensive recent research and received further support in 2019 when researchers amended the computation of the entropy of the Hawking radiation in certain models and showed that the radiation is in fact dual to the black hole interior at late times. Hawking himself was influenced by this view and in 2004 published a paper that assumed the AdS/CFT correspondence and argued that quantum perturbations of the event horizon could allow information to escape from a black hole, which would resolve the information paradox. In this perspective, it is the event horizon of the black hole that is important and not the black-hole singularity. The GISR (Gravity Induced Spontaneous Radiation) mechanism of references can be considered an implementation of this idea but with the quantum perturbations of the event horizon replaced by the microscopic states of the black hole.

On the other hand, within what might broadly be termed the &quot;loop quantum gravity community&quot;, the dominant belief is that to resolve the information paradox, it is important to understand how the black-hole singularity is resolved. These scenarios are broadly called remnant scenarios since information does not emerge gradually but remains in the black-hole interior only to emerge at the end of black-hole evaporation.

Researchers also study other possibilities, including a modification of the laws of quantum mechanics to allow for non-unitary time evolution.

Some of these solutions are described at greater length below.

=== GISR mechanism resolution to the paradox ===

This resolution takes GISR as the underlying mechanism for Hawking radiation, considering the latter only as a resultant effect. The physics ingredients of GISR are reflected in the following explicitly hermitian hamiltonian

formula_10

The first term of formula_11 is a diagonal matrix representing the microscopic state of black holes no heavier than the initial one. The second term describes vacuum fluctuations of particles around the black hole and is represented by many harmonic oscillators. The third term couples the vacuum fluctuation modes to the black hole, such that for each mode whose energy matches the difference between two states of the black hole, the latter transitions with an amplitude proportional to the similarity factor of their microscopic wave functions. Transitions between higher energy state formula_12 to lower energy state formula_13 and vice versa, are equally permitted at the Hamiltonian level. This coupling mimics the photon-atom coupling in the Jaynes–Cummings model of atomic physics, replacing the photon&#x27;s vector potential with the binding energy of particles to be radiated in the black hole case, and the dipole moment of initial-to-final state transitions in atoms with the similarity factor of the initial and final states&#x27; wave functions in black holes. Despite its ad hoc nature, this coupling introduces no new interactions beyond gravity, and it is deemed necessary irrespective of the future development of quantum gravitational theories.

formula_14

formula_15

here formula_16 is the index of the radiated particles set with total energy formula_2. In the case of short time evolution or single quantum emission, Wigner-Wiesskopf approximation allows one to show that the power spectrum of GISR is exactly of thermal type and the corresponding temperature equals that of Hawking radiation. However, in the case of long time evolution or continuous quantum emission, the process is off-equilibrium and is characterised by an initial state dependent black hole mass or temperature vs. time curve. The observers far away can retrieve the information stored in the initial black hole from this mass or temperature versus time curve.

The hamiltonian and wave function description of GISR allows one to calculate the entanglement entropy between the black hole and its Hawking particles explicitly.

formula_18

formula_19

formula_20

Since the Hamiltonian of GISR is explicitly Hermitian, the resulting Page curve is naturally expected, except for some late-time Rabi-type oscillations. These oscillations arise from the equal probability of emission and absorption transitions as the black hole approaches the vanishing stage. The most important lesson from this calculation is that the intermediate state of an evaporating black hole cannot be considered a semiclassical object with a time-dependent mass. Instead, it must be viewed as a superposition of many different mass ratio combinations of the black hole and Hawking particles. References designed a Schrödinger cat-type thought experiment to illustrate this fact, where an initial black hole is bounded with a group of living cats and each Hawking particle kills on from the group. In the quantum description, because the exact timing and number of particles radiated by a black hole cannot be determined definitively, the intermediate state of the evaporating black hole must be considered a superposition of many cat groups, each with a different ratio of dead members. The biggest flaw in the argument for the information loss paradox is ignoring this superposition.

=== Small-corrections resolution to the paradox ===
This idea suggests that Hawking&#x27;s computation fails to keep track of small corrections that are eventually sufficient to preserve information about the initial state. This can be thought of as analogous to what happens during the mundane process of &quot;burning&quot;: the radiation produced appears to be thermal, but its fine-grained features encode the precise details of the object that was burnt. This idea is consistent with reversibility, as required by quantum mechanics. It is the dominant idea in what might broadly be termed the string-theory approach to quantum gravity.

More precisely, this line of resolution suggests that Hawking&#x27;s computation is corrected so that the two point correlator computed by Hawking and described above becomes
formula_21
and higher-point correlators are similarly corrected
formula_22
The equations above utilize a concise notation and the correction factors formula_23 may depend on the temperature, the frequencies of the operators that enter the correlation function and other details of the black hole.

Maldacena initially explored such corrections in a simple version of the paradox. They were then analyzed by Papadodimas and Raju, who showed that corrections to low-point correlators (such as formula_24 above ) that were exponentially suppressed in the black-hole entropy were sufficient to preserve unitarity, and significant corrections were required only for very high-point correlators. The mechanism that allowed the right small corrections to form was initially postulated in terms of a loss of exact locality in quantum gravity so that the black-hole interior and the radiation were described by the same degrees of freedom. Recent developments suggest that such a mechanism can be realized precisely within semiclassical gravity and allows information to escape. See § Recent developments.

=== Fuzzball resolution to the paradox ===

Some researchers, most notably Samir Mathur, have argued that the small corrections required to preserve information cannot be obtained while preserving the semiclassical form of the black-hole interior and instead require a modification of the black-hole geometry to a fuzzball.

The defining characteristic of the fuzzball is that it has structure at the horizon scale. This should be contrasted with the conventional picture of the black-hole interior as a largely featureless region of space. For a large enough black hole, tidal effects are very small at the black-hole horizon and remain small in the interior until one approaches the black-hole singularity. Therefore, in the conventional picture, an observer who crosses the horizon may not even realize they have done so until they start approaching the singularity. In contrast, the fuzzball proposal suggests that the black hole horizon is not empty. Consequently, it is also not information-free, since the details of the structure at the surface of the horizon preserve information about the black hole&#x27;s initial state. This structure also affects the outgoing Hawking radiation and thereby allows information to escape from the fuzzball.

The fuzzball proposal is supported by the existence of a large number of gravitational solutions called microstate geometries.

The firewall proposal can be thought of as a variant of the fuzzball proposal that posits that the black-hole interior is replaced by a firewall rather than a fuzzball. Operationally, the difference between the fuzzball and the firewall proposals has to do with whether an observer crossing the horizon of the black hole encounters high-energy matter, suggested by the firewall proposal, or merely low-energy structure, suggested by the fuzzball proposal. The firewall proposal also originated with an exploration of Mathur&#x27;s argument that small corrections are insufficient to resolve the information paradox.

The fuzzball and firewall proposals have been questioned for lacking an appropriate mechanism that can generate structure at the horizon scale.

===Strong-quantum-effects resolution to the paradox===

In the final stages of black-hole evaporation, quantum effects become important and cannot be ignored. The precise understanding of this phase of black-hole evaporation requires a complete theory of quantum gravity. Within what might be termed the loop-quantum-gravity approach to black holes, it is believed that understanding this phase of evaporation is crucial to resolving the information paradox.

This perspective holds that Hawking&#x27;s computation is reliable until the final stages of black-hole evaporation, when information suddenly escapes. Another possibility along the same lines is that black-hole evaporation simply stops when the black hole becomes Planck-sized. Such scenarios are called &quot;remnant scenarios&quot;.

An appealing aspect of this perspective is that a significant deviation from classical and semiclassical gravity is needed only in the regime in which the effects of quantum gravity are expected to dominate. On the other hand, this idea implies that just before the sudden escape of information, a very small black hole must be able to store an arbitrary amount of information and have a very large number of internal states. Therefore, researchers who follow this idea must take care to avoid the common criticism of remnant-type scenarios, which is that they might may violate the Bekenstein bound and lead to a violation of effective field theory due to the production of remnants as virtual particles in ordinary scattering events.

=== Soft-hair resolution to the paradox ===
In 2016, Hawking, Perry and Strominger noted that black holes must contain &quot;soft hair&quot;. Particles that have no rest mass, like photons and gravitons, can exist with arbitrarily low-energy and are called soft particles. The soft-hair resolution posits that information about the initial state is stored in such soft particles. The existence of such soft hair is a peculiarity of four-dimensional asymptotically flat space and therefore this resolution to the paradox does not carry over to black holes in Anti-de Sitter space or black holes in other dimensions.

===Information is irretrievably lost===
A minority view in the theoretical physics community is that information is genuinely lost when black holes form and evaporate. This conclusion follows if one assumes that the predictions of semiclassical gravity and the causal structure of the black-hole spacetime are exact.

But this conclusion leads to the loss of unitarity. Banks, Susskind and Peskin argue that, in some cases, loss of unitarity also implies violation of energy–momentum conservation or locality, but this argument may possibly be evaded in systems with a large number of degrees of freedom. According to Roger Penrose, loss of unitarity in quantum systems is not a problem: quantum measurements are by themselves already non-unitary. Penrose claims that quantum systems will in fact no longer evolve unitarily as soon as gravitation comes into play, precisely as in black holes. The Conformal Cyclic Cosmology Penrose advocates critically depends on the condition that information is in fact lost in black holes. This new cosmological model might be tested experimentally by detailed analysis of the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB): if true, the CMB should exhibit circular patterns with slightly lower or slightly higher temperatures. In November 2010, Penrose and V. G. Gurzadyan announced they had found evidence of such circular patterns in data from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), corroborated by data from the BOOMERanG experiment. The significance of these findings was debated.

Along similar lines, Modak, Ortíz, Peña, and Sudarsky have argued that the paradox can be dissolved by invoking foundational issues of quantum theory often called the measurement problem of quantum mechanics. This work built on an earlier proposal by Okon and Sudarsky on the benefits of objective collapse theory in a much broader context. The original motivation of these studies was Penrose&#x27;s long-standing proposal wherein collapse of the wave-function is said to be inevitable in the presence of black holes (and even under the influence of gravitational field). Experimental verification of collapse theories is an ongoing effort.

=== Other proposed resolutions ===
Some other resolutions to the paradox have also been explored. These are listed briefly below.

* Information is stored in a large remnantThis idea suggests that Hawking radiation stops before the black hole reaches the Planck size. Since the black hole never evaporates, information about its initial state can remain inside the black hole and the paradox disappears. But there is no accepted mechanism that would allow Hawking radiation to stop while the black hole remains macroscopic.
* Information is stored in a baby universe that separates from our own universe.Some models of gravity, such as the Einstein–Cartan theory of gravity, which extends general relativity to matter with intrinsic angular momentum (spin), predict the formation of such baby universes. No violation of known general principles of physics is needed. There are no physical constraints on the number of the universes, even though only one remains observable.The Einstein–Cartan theory is difficult to test because its predictions are significantly different from general-relativistic ones only at extremely high densities.
* Information is encoded in the correlations between future and pastThe final-state proposal suggests that boundary conditions must be imposed at the black-hole singularity, which, from a causal perspective, is to the future of all events in the black-hole interior. This helps reconcile black-hole evaporation with unitarity but contradicts the intuitive idea of causality and locality of time-evolution.
* Quantum-channel theoryIn 2014, Chris Adami argued that analysis using quantum channel theory causes any apparent paradox to disappear; Adami rejects black hole complementarity, arguing instead that no space-like surface contains duplicated quantum information.
* Topological Invariants and Recursive DynamicsThe K-Line Theory offers a novel resolution to the black hole information paradox through a framework based on recursive state evolution, topological invariant dynamics, and probabilistic equivalence. By employing symmetry indices and dynamic constants, the theory ensures that information is preserved throughout the black hole&#x27;s lifecycle, including during its evaporation via Hawking radiation. Unlike previous proposals, which often fail to provide a mechanism for information preservation without introducing confounding drawbacks, K-Line Theory addresses these issues by maintaining a hierarchical structure of states and encoding quantum correlations coherently. Numerical simulations within the K-Line framework produce entropy behaviours consistent with the Page curve, demonstrating information retrieval and coherence. This approach bridges quantum mechanics and general relativity without violating established physical principles, providing a comprehensive mechanism for information conservation in black hole physics.

== Recent developments ==

Significant progress was made in 2019, when, starting with work by Penington and Almheiri, Engelhardt, Marolf and Maxfield, researchers were able to compute the von Neumann entropy of the radiation black holes emit in specific models of quantum gravity. These calculations showed that, in these models, the entropy of this radiation first rises and then falls back to zero. As explained above, one way to frame the information paradox is that Hawking&#x27;s calculation appears to show that the von Neumann entropy of Hawking radiation increases throughout the lifetime of the black hole. But if the black hole formed from a pure state with zero entropy, unitarity implies that the entropy of the Hawking radiation must decrease back to zero once the black hole evaporates completely, i.e., the Page curve. Therefore, the results above provide a resolution to the information paradox, at least in the specific models of gravity considered in these models.

These calculations compute the entropy by first analytically continuing the spacetime to a Euclidean spacetime and then using the replica trick. The path integral that computes the entropy receives contributions from novel Euclidean configurations called &quot;replica wormholes&quot;. (These wormholes exist in a Wick rotated spacetime and should not be conflated with wormholes in the original spacetime.) The inclusion of these wormhole geometries in the computation prevents the entropy from increasing indefinitely.

These calculations also imply that for sufficiently old black holes, one can perform operations on the Hawking radiation that affect the black hole interior. This result has implications for the related firewall paradox, and provides evidence for the physical picture suggested by the ER=EPR proposal, black hole complementarity, and the Papadodimas–Raju proposal.

It has been noted that the models used to perform the Page curve computations above have consistently involved theories where the graviton has mass, unlike the real world, where the graviton is massless. These models have also involved a &quot;nongravitational bath&quot;, which can be thought of as an artificial interface where gravity ceases to act. It has also been argued that a key technique used in the Page-curve computations, the &quot;island proposal&quot;, is inconsistent in standard theories of gravity with a Gauss law. This would suggest that the Page curve computations are inapplicable to realistic black holes and work only in special toy models of gravity. The validity of these criticisms remains under investigation; there is no consensus in the research community.

In 2020, Laddha, Prabhu, Raju, and Shrivastava argued that, as a result of the effects of quantum gravity, information should always be available outside the black hole. This would imply that the von Neumann entropy of the region outside the black hole always remains zero, as opposed to the proposal above, where the von Neumann entropy first rises and then falls. Extending this, Raju argued that Hawking&#x27;s error was to assume that the region outside the black hole would have no information about its interior. 

Hawking formalized this assumption in terms of a &quot;principle of ignorance&quot;. The principle of ignorance is correct in classical gravity, when quantum-mechanical effects are neglected, by virtue of the no-hair theorem. It is also correct when only quantum-mechanical effects are considered and gravitational effects are neglected. But Raju argued that when both quantum mechanical and gravitational effects are accounted for, the principle of ignorance should be replaced by a &quot;principle of holography of information&quot; that would imply just the opposite: all the information about the interior can be regained from the exterior through suitably precise measurements.

The two recent resolutions of the information paradox described above—via replica wormholes and the holography of information—share the feature that observables in the black-hole interior also describe observables far from the black hole. This implies a loss of exact locality in quantum gravity. Although this loss of locality is very small, it persists over large distance scales. This feature has been challenged by some researchers.

<doc id="851013" wikidata="Q249121" url="?curid=851013" title="Qalawun">
<text>&#x27; (, – November 10, 1290) was the seventh Turkic Bahri Mamluk sultan of Egypt; he ruled from 1279 to 1290. He was called &#x27; (, &quot;Qalāwūn the Victorious&quot;). After having risen in power in the Mamluk court and elite circles, Qalawun eventually held the title of &quot;the victorious king&quot; and gained de facto authority over the sultanate. He is the founder of the Qalawunid dynasty that ruled Egypt for over a century. 

The current sultan, Barakah was exiled and rumored to have been poisoned by Qalawun. He would then wage war against the Crusaders, capturing lands held by the County of Tripoli, and later totally defeating them in 1289. Acre, a major Crusader stronghold was besieged by Qalawun but would only be taken by his son al-Ashraf Khalil as the former died before the siege was won in 1291. His son Khalil succeeded him as sultan.

==Biography and rise to power==
Qalawun was a Kipchak (a Turkic people living between the Black Sea and Caspian Sea) from the Burj Oghli () tribe, the same tribe as the earlier Mamluk sultan Baybars. They were both probably sold into slavery during the Mongol invasions of Kipchak territories in the 1220s and 1230s. When he was 14 years old, Qalawun was brought by slave merchants to Egypt, which was under Ayyubid rule at the time. He was then purchased as a mamluk (slave soldier) sometime in the 1230s or 1240s, by a mamluk amir (commander) whom different historical sources name as either &#x27;Ala al-Din Aqsunqur al-Kamili (a mamluk of Sultan al-Kamil) or &#x27;Ala al-Din Aqsunqur al-Saqi al-&#x27;Adili (a mamluk of Sultan al-Adil). He was bought for the unusually high price of a thousand dinars, which earned him the nickname &quot;al-Alfī&quot; (&quot;the Thousander&quot;).

Qalawun initially spoke little Arabic, but he rose in power and influence, becoming an emir under Sultan Baibars, whose son, al-Said Barakah, was married to Qalawun&#x27;s daughter. Baibars died in 1277 and was succeeded by Barakah. In early 1279, as Barakah and Qalawun invaded the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, a revolt in Egypt forced Barakah to abdicate upon his return home. He was succeeded by his brother Solamish, but it was Qalawun, acting as atabeg, who was the true holder of power. Because Solamish was only seven years old, Qalawun argued that Egypt needed an adult ruler, and Solamish was sent into exile in Constantinople in late 1279. As a result, Qalawun took the title &quot;al-Malik al-Manṣūr&quot; (&quot;the victorious king&quot;).

The governor of Damascus, Sunqur al-Ashqar, opposed Qalawun&#x27;s ascent to power and declared himself sultan. Sunqur&#x27;s claim of leadership, however, was repelled in 1280, when Qalawun defeated him in battle. In 1281, Qalawun and Sunqur reconciled as a matter of convenience when Abaqa Khan, head of the Ilkhanate, invaded Syria. Qalawun and Sunqur, working together, successfully repelled Abaqa&#x27;s attack at the Second Battle of Homs.

Barakah, Solamish, and their brother Khadir were exiled to al-Karak, the former Crusader castle. Barakah died there in 1280 (it was rumored that Qalawun had him poisoned), and Khadir gained control of the castle, until 1286 when Qalawun took it over directly.

In 1282 he founded Ribat al-Mansuri, a ribat (hospice) next to the in Jerusalem. The nearby was founded by Kurd al-Manṣūrī, a mamluk of Qalawun.

==Mamluk diplomacy==

As Baibars had done previously, Qalawun entered into land control treaties with the remaining Crusader states, military orders and individual lords who wished to remain independent; he recognized Tyre and Beirut as separate from the Kingdom of Jerusalem, now centered on Acre. The treaties were always in Qalawun&#x27;s favor, and his treaty with Tyre mandated that the city would not build new fortifications, would stay neutral in conflicts between the Mamluks and other Crusaders, and Qalawun would be allowed to collect half the city&#x27;s taxes. 

In 1281 Qalawun also negotiated an alliance with Michael VIII Palaiologos of the Byzantine Empire to bolster resistance against Charles I of Naples, who was threatening both the Byzantine Empire and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. In 1290, he concluded trade alliances with the Republic of Genoa and the Kingdom of Sicily.

==Wars against the Crusader states==

Undeterred by the terms of these newly formed peace treaties, Qalawun sacked the &quot;impregnable&quot; Hospitaller fortress of Margat in 1285, and established a Mamluk garrison there. He also captured and destroyed the castle of Maraclea. He captured Latakia in 1287 and Tripoli on April 27, 1289, thus ending the Crusader County of Tripoli. The Fall of Tripoli in 1289 was spurred by the Venetians and the Pisans, who opposed rising Genoese influence in the area. In 1290, reinforcements of King Henry arrived in Acre and drunkenly slaughtered peaceable merchants and peasants, Christians and Muslims alike. 

Qalawun sent an emissary to ask for an explanation and above all to demand that the murderers be handed over for punishment. The Frankish response was divided between those who sought to appease him and those who sought a new war. Having received neither an explanation nor the murderers themselves, Qalawun decided that the ten-year truce he had formed with Acre in 1284 had been broken by the Franks. He subsequently besieged the city that same year. He died in Cairo on 10 November 1290, before taking the city, but Acre was captured the next year by his son and successor al-Ashraf Khalil.

Despite Qalawun&#x27;s distrust of his son, Khalil succeeded him following his death. Khalil continued his father&#x27;s policy of replacing Turkish Mamluks with Circassians, which eventually led to conflict within the Mamluk ranks. Khalil was assassinated by the Turks in 1293, but Qalawun&#x27;s legacy continued when his younger son, an-Nasir Muhammad, claimed power.

==Family==
Qalawun&#x27;s first wife was Fatima Khatun, known as Umm Salih. She was the daughter of Sayf ad-Din Karmun (Karamūm), a Mongol commander from the Golden Horde who had integrated the Mamluks. They married in 1265–66. She was the mother of his eldest son, as-Salih Ali (died 2 September 1288) and Ghaziya Khatun. She died in 1283–84, and was buried in her own mausoleum in Southern Cemetery, Cairo. 

After her death, he married her sister, the widow of Sayf ad-Din Kunduk. Another wife was Qutqutiya Khatun. She was the mother of his second son, Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil. 

Another wife was Sitt Ashlun Khatun (Ašlūn), the daughter of an Ilkhanate Mongol notable named Suktay bin Qarajin bin Jighan Nuwan (Šaktāy) who also had joined the Mamluks. They married in 1282. She was the mother of his third son, Sultan an-Nasir Muhammad. An-Nasir Muhammad was raised and behaved in Mongol fashion until the age of 29, until he had a change of mood after an illness in 1315, which led him and his followers to &quot;shave their heads [...] and give up their flowing locks&quot;.

Another wife was the daughter of Amir Shams ad-Din Sunqur al-Takriti al-Zahiri. They married in 1288–89. Qalawun, however, dissolved the marriage shortly thereafter. Another son was Amir Ahmad, who died during the reign of his brother al-Ashraf Khalil. Qalawun&#x27;s daughter Ghaziya Khatun was betrothed to as-Said Barakah (son of Sultan Baibars) on 28 May 1276, with a dowry of five thousand dinars. The wedding took place on 8 June 1277. She died in August 1288, and was buried in the mausoleum of her mother. Another daughter was Dar Mukhatar al-Jawhari (Altumish). She was the wife of Mukhtar al-Jawhari. Another daughter was Dar Anbar al-Kamili. She was the wife of Anbar al-Kamili.

<text>Georg Karl Friedrich Kunowsky (3 March 1786 –23 December 1846) was a German lawyer who was also a talented amateur astronomer.

He made observations of Mars with an 11 cm achromatic refractor telescope made by Joseph von Fraunhofer, which was one of the first times that achromatic refractors were used for planetary observation; these were a notable improvement over the reflectors available to earlier observers.

Like William Herschel before him, he came to the correct conclusion that the visible patches on Mars were surface features rather than clouds or other transient features. Observers like Johann Hieronymus Schröter had come to the opposite conclusion.

He also made observations of the Moon, and was one of a number of astronomers to independently discover the return of Comet Halley in 1835.

Kunowsky crater on the Moon and another crater on Mars were named in his honour.</text><links>

<text>Cascais () is a town and municipality in the Lisbon District of Portugal, located on the Portuguese Riviera. The municipality has a total of 214,158 inhabitants in an area of 97.40 km2. Cascais is an important tourist destination. Its marina hosts events such as the America&#x27;s Cup and the town of Estoril, part of the Cascais municipality, hosts conferences such as the Horasis Global Meeting.

Cascais&#x27;s history as a popular seaside resort originated in the 1870s, when King Luís I of Portugal and the Portuguese royal family made the seaside town their residence every September, thus also attracting members of the Portuguese nobility, who established a summer community there. Cascais is known for the many members of royalty who have lived there, including King Edward VIII of the United Kingdom, when he was the Duke of Windsor, King Juan Carlos I of Spain, and King Umberto II of Italy. Exiled Cuban president Fulgencio Batista was also once a resident of the municipality. The Casino Estoril inspired Ian Fleming&#x27;s first James Bond novel, &quot;Casino Royale&quot;.

The municipality is one of the wealthiest in both Portugal and the Iberian Peninsula. It has one of the most expensive real estate markets and one of the highest costs of living in the country, and is consistently ranked highly for its quality of life.

==History==

Human settlement of the territory today known as Cascais dates to the late Paleolithic, as indicated by remnants encountered in the north of Talaíde, in Alto do Cabecinho (Tires) and south of Moinhos do Cabreiro. It was during the Neolithic that permanent settlements were established in the region, their inhabitants utilizing the natural grottoes (such as the Caves of Poço Velho in Cascais) and artificial shelters (like those in Alapraia or São Pedro) to deposit their dead. The bodies were buried along with offerings, a practice that continued to the Chalcolithic.

Roman interventions in the area occurred with the settlement of the &quot;villae&quot; of Freiria (today São Domingos de Rana) and Casais Velhos (Charneca), evidence for which includes a group of ten tanks discovered along the &quot;Rua Marques Leal Pancada&quot; in Cascais, which was the location of a salting factory for fish. Roman dominion over the territory also influenced place names in the region, as was the case with the word &quot;Caparide&quot; (from the Latin &quot;capparis&quot;, meaning &quot;caper&quot;), as well as several inscriptions associated with funerary graves.

The Visigoths also left their mark especially on the Visigothic Cemetery of Alcoitão, as well as in the late-Roman and medieval necropolis of Talaíde.

Similarly, Muslim settlers in the region left their mark on local place names, including &quot;Alcoitão&quot; and &quot;Alcabideche&quot;, where the romantic poet Ibn Muqana al-Qabdaqi, who wrote of the region&#x27;s agriculture and windmills, was born at the beginning of the 11th century. The discovery of several corpses in 1987 at Arneiro, in Carcavelos, led to the identification of fifteen burials that, due to their characteristics, made it possible to verify that the individuals buried there were of Berber origin.

The development of Cascais began in earnest in the 12th century, when it was administratively subordinate to the town of Sintra, located to the north. In its humble beginnings, Cascais depended on the products of the sea and land, but by the 13th century its fish production was also supplying the nearby city of Lisbon. The toponym &quot;Cascais&quot; appears to derive from this period, a plural derivation of &quot;cascal&quot; (&quot;monte de cascas&quot;) which signified a &quot;mountain of shells&quot;, referring to the abundant volume of marine mollusks harvested from the coastal waters. During the 14th century, the population spread outside the walls of its fortress castle.
The settlement&#x27;s prosperity led to its administrative independence from Sintra in 1364. On 7 June 1364, the people of Cascais obtained from King Peter I the elevation of the village to the status of town, necessitating the appointment of local judges and administrators. The townspeople were consequently obligated to pay the Crown 200 pounds of gold annually, as well as bearing the expense of paying the local administrators&#x27; salaries. Owing to the regions&#x27; wealth, these obligations were easily satisfied. The town and the surrounding lands were owned by a succession of feudal lords, the most famous of whom was João das Regras (died 1404), a lawyer and professor of the University of Lisbon who was involved in the ascension of King John I to power as the first King of the House of Aviz.

The castle of Cascais was likely constructed during this period, since by 1370, King Ferdinand had donated the castle and Cascais to Gomes Lourenço de Avelar to hold as a seigneurial fiefdom. These privileges were then passed on to his successors, among them João das Regras and the Counts of Monsanto, and later the Marquess of Cascais. Meanwhile, despite its conquest and sack by Castilian forces in 1373, and blockade of the port in 1382 and 1384, Cascais continued to grow beyond its walls. By the end of the 14th century this resulted in the creation of the parishes of Santa Maria de Cascais, São Vicente de Alcabideche and São Domingos de Rana.
From the Middle Ages onward, Cascais depended on fishing, maritime commerce (it was a stop for ships sailing to Lisbon), and agriculture, producing wine, olive oil, cereals, and fruits. Due to its location at the mouth of the Tagus estuary, it was also seen as a strategic post in the defence of Lisbon. Around 1488, King John II built a small fortress in the town, situated by the sea. On 15 November 1514, Manuel I conceded a foral (&quot;charter&quot;) to Cascais, instituting the region&#x27;s municipal authority. It was followed on 11 June 1551 by a license from King John III to institutionalise the &quot;Santa Casa da Misericórdia de Cascais&quot;. The Mother Church of Cascais, the Church of Nossa Senhora da Assunção, dates back to the early 16th century. The town&#x27;s medieval fortress was inadequate to repel invasions, and in 1580 Spanish troops led by the Duque of Alba took the village during the conflict that led to the union of the Portuguese and Spanish crowns. The fortress was enlarged towards the end of the 16th century by King Philip I (Philip II of Spain), turning it into a typical Renaissance citadel with the characteristic flat profile and star-shaped floorplan. Following the Portuguese restoration in 1640, a dozen bulwarks and redoubts were constructed under the direction of the Count of Cantanhede, who oversaw the defences of the Tagus estuary, the gateway to the city of Lisbon. Of these structures, the citadel of Cascais, which was constructed alongside the fortress of Our Lady of Light, considerably reinforced the strategic defences of the coast.
In 1755, the great Lisbon earthquake destroyed a large portion of the city. Around 1774, the Marquis of Pombal, prime-minister of King José I, took protective measures for the commercialisation of the wine of Carcavelos and established the Royal Factory of Wool in the village, which existed until the early 19th century. During the invasion of Portugal by Napoleonic troops in 1807, the citadel of Cascais was occupied by the French, with General Junot staying some time in the village.

In 1862, the Visconde da Luz built a summer house in Cascais. He and a group of friends also organized the construction of a road from Cascais to Oeiras, effectively linking Cascais to Lisbon, and also promoted other improvements to the town. As a result of these improvement, King Luís I decided to make Cascais into his summer residence and, from 1870 to 1908, the Portuguese royal family from the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha spent part of the summer in Cascais to enjoy the sea, turning the quiet fishing village into a cosmopolitan address. Thanks to King Luís, the citadel was equipped with the country&#x27;s first electric lights in 1878. Cascais also benefited from the construction of a better road to Sintra, a bullfight ring, a sports club, and improvements to basic infrastructure for the population. Many noble families built impressive mansions in an eclectic style commonly referred to as &quot;summer architecture&quot;, many of which are still to be seen in the town centre and environs. The first railway arrived in 1889. Another important step in the development of the area was made in the first half of the 20th century with the building of a casino and infrastructure in neighbouring Estoril.
In 1882 Cascais installed one of the first tide gauges in Europe in order to assist with navigation into the port of Lisbon. In 1896, King Carlos I, a lover of all maritime activities, installed in the citadel the first oceanographic laboratory in Portugal. The King himself led a total of 12 scientific expeditions to the coast; these ended in 1908 after his assassination in Lisbon.

Due to Portugal&#x27;s neutrality in World War II and the town&#x27;s elegance and royal past, Cascais became home to many of the exiled royal families of Europe, including those of Spain (House of Bourbon), Italy (House of Savoy), Hungary and Bulgaria. Their stories are told at the Exiles Memorial Centre.

Nowadays, Cascais and its surroundings are a popular vacation spot for the Portuguese as well as for the international jet set and regular foreign tourists, all of them drawn by its fine beaches. The town hosts many international events, including sailing and surfing. In 2018 it was the European Youth Capital.

==Geography==

Cascais is situated on the western edge of the Tagus estuary, between the Sintra mountains and the Atlantic Ocean; the territory occupied by the municipality is limited in the north by the municipality of Sintra, south and west by the ocean, and east by the municipality of Oeiras.

Administratively, the municipality is divided into 4 civil parishes (&quot;freguesias&quot;), with municipal authority vested in the &quot;Câmara Municipal&quot; of Cascais:
* Alcabideche
* Carcavelos e Parede
* Cascais e Estoril
* São Domingos de Rana

Cascais&#x27; coastline is home to 17 beaches. These are:
Guincho Beach and Carcavelos Beach are especially well known as good surf spots. Close to Praia do Guincho is the Cresmina Dune, which is an unstable dune system due to the constant drifting of sand particles caused by strong winds.

===Climate===
Cascais has a Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;) with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers. Moderated by the Atlantic and the typical urban heat island of a city, temperatures in Cascais rarely get below or above .

== Demographics ==
==Economy==
Cascais is easily reached from Lisbon by car on the A5 Lisbon-Cascais highway, or alternatively on the scenic &quot;marginal&quot; road, as well as by frequent inexpensive commuter trains. Taxis are also a common and inexpensive mode of transport in the area. The city has the ruins of a castle, an art museum and an ocean museum, as well as parks and the cobbled streets of the historic centre. The town has many hotels and tourist apartments as well as many good restaurants of varying cost. It is a fine base to use for those visiting Lisbon and its environs who prefer to stay outside of the city.

Cascais ranks 9th in population density and 6th in percentage of population employed among Portuguese municipalities.

Cascais is surrounded by popular beaches. Guincho Beach to the northwest is primarily a surfing, windsurfing, and kitesurfing beach because of the prevailing winds and sea swells, while the calm waters of the beaches to the east attract sunbathers. The lush Sintra mountains to the north are a further attraction. The shoreline to the west has cliffs, attracting tourists who come for the panoramic views of the sea and other natural sights such as the Boca do Inferno. It is also becoming a popular golf destination, with over 10 golf courses nearby.

A large marina with 650 berths was opened in 1999 and has since held many sailing events. It was the official host of the 2007 ISAF Sailing World Championships for dinghies and racing yachts. The municipality also hosts international tennis and motorcycling events and for many years hosted the FIA F1 Portugal Grand Prix at the Estoril race track. The Estoril Casino is one of the largest in Europe. Near the casino is the &quot;Hotel Palácio&quot; (Palace Hotel), where scenes of the James Bond movie &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot; were shot.

In 2017 the municipality started charging a small tourist tax, as the city had become one of the most visited destinations in Portugal. It is estimated that around 1.2 million tourists stay in the city&#x27;s hotels each year (2016).

The Cascais Aerodrome in Tires (São Domingos de Rana) serves general aviation and also offers domestic scheduled flights by Aero VIP.

==Education==

The Carcavelos community houses the Saint Julian&#x27;s School, a British international school.

The Estoril community hosts a kindergarten and elementary school campus of the German School of Lisbon.

Outeiro de Polima, São Domingos de Rana, in Cascais, houses Saint Dominic&#x27;s International School.

==Culture==

The Gil Vicente theatre dates back to 1869. In its early years it was frequently attended by Portugal&#x27;s royal family. The Cascais Experimental Theatre was established in 1965 and has presented more than a hundred shows since then. Over the years Cascais has developed several art galleries and museums. These are concentrated in a relatively small area of the town, mainly in parkland. Combined, they are known as The Museum Quarter. Several occupy large buildings that were formerly private residences and were subsequently taken over and restored by the Municipality. Entrance is either free or for a small fee (usually not more than €4). The galleries and museums are:

Art galleries
*Casa das Histórias Paula Rego. This is a relatively modern museum devoted to the paintings of Paula Rego and her husband Victor Willing.
* Cascais Cultural Centre. Located on the site of the former convent of Our Lady of Mercy, this colourful building houses rotating exhibitions and also has a small concert hall.
* Casa Duarte Pinto Coelho. The former guardhouse of the Condes de Castro Guimarães Palace, this building houses the Duarte Pinto Coelho art collection.
*Cidadela Arts Centre. This occupies a small part of the Citadel of Cascais and offers space for artists to display and sell their work.
Museums
* The Exiles Memorial Centre is located on the first floor of the iconic modernist building that houses the Estoril post office. It is a history museum which focuses on the lives of the refugees, exiles, and notables who came through Portugal and Cascais during the Second World War.
*The Cascais Citadel Palace Museum is situated inside the grounds of the Citadel. It was used as the summer residence of the royal family from 1870 until 1908, and was subsequently used as one of the official residences of Portuguese presidents. After extensive restoration it was opened as a museum in 2011, with an emphasis on the role of Portuguese presidents.
* Condes de Castro Guimarães Museum. This was built as an aristocrat&#x27;s summer residence and became a museum in 1931. The building follows an eclectic architectural style, while the museum includes paintings, furniture, porcelain, jewellery and a neo-Gothic organ.
*Casa de Santa Maria. This was built for the same person as the building housing the Condes de Castro Guimarães Museum. Both are built on the banks of a small sea cove. It was acquired by the Cascais Municipality in October 2004 and is interesting mainly for the design and the wall tiles.
* Lighthouse museum. This is built into the Santa Marta Lighthouse, next to the Casa de Santa Maria. Examples of lighthouse lens and other technology can be seen and at certain times the lighthouse can be climbed.
* Casa Sommer is a distinguished private residence converted into a historical museum. It also houses the Municipal Archives. It is the newest museum in the Quarter, having been opened in 2016.
* King D. Carlos Sea Museum was inaugurated in 1992. It has a variety of exhibitions reflecting the origins of Cascais as a fishing village.
* Town museum (). Provides an introduction to the history of the town.

<text>The Aymerich Fábrica de Automoviles (AFA) was a Spanish automobile manufactured between 1943 and 1944.

==Cabriolet==
Little is known about the marque other than that a few (1 or 2) 5cv 4-cylinder cabriolets were built by Joan Aymerich Casanoves in Barcelona. The AFA was powered by a four-stroke 527 cc engine that produced at 3,500 rpm. The AFA microcar had a manual transmission with four gears with a top speed of . The AFA prototype was registered in Barcelona in April 1943, with the registration number B-72.107 and its patent number was 159,882. The company exhibited at the Exposición Automovilista Nacional in Madrid on July 10, 1944.

In 2008, a son of Joan Aymerich contacted the mNACTEC, Terrassa, which took the only remaining car and restored it. After three years of restoration work, the AFA is now on exhibition in the Transport collection at mNACTEC.

==Joan Aymerich Casanoves==
In 1935 Casanoves had created the failed &quot;National Ruby&quot; car, due to the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War he was not able to go to production. But his experience served as the basis for the AFA. Casanoves hoped to make 100 cars annually, but only produced one or two cars. He died in 1946, and the car project was then abandoned in 1947.

<doc id="851028" wikidata="Q2663618" url="?curid=851028" title="Alphonso mango">
<text>The Alphonso mango is a named mango cultivar that originates from India. As of now, it is one of the world&#x27;s mostly prized mangoes, known for its exquisite saffron-coloured flesh and can be eaten raw or used extensively in dishes and desserts.

==Origin==
The variety is named after Afonso de Albuquerque, a distinguished militarian and viceroy of Portuguese India from 1509 to 1515. Jesuit missionaries introduced grafting on mango trees in Portuguese Goa, to produce varieties like Alphonso. In 1563, Garcia da Orta wrote of Alphonsos grown in Portuguese Bombay, which were to be presented to the governor (viceroy) in Goa. Alphonso is also one of the most expensive varieties of mango, and is grown mainly in the Konkan region of western India. and also grown in the Valsad and Navsari districts of South Gujarat.

==Description==

The Alphonso mango is a seasonal fruit harvested from mid-April through the end of June. The time from flowering to harvest is about 90 days, while the time from harvest to ripening is about 15 days. The fruits generally weigh between , have a rich, creamy, tender texture and delicate, non-fibrous, juicy pulp. As the fruit matures, the skin of an Alphonso mango turns golden-yellow with a tinge of red across the top of the fruit.

===Culinary===
Mango sorbet, ice cream, lassi, soufflé, mousse, and puree are some culinary preparations using Alphonso mangoes.

==Trade==
The Alphonso is prized in domestic and international markets for its taste, fragrance and vibrant color. It is exported to various countries, including Japan, Korea and Europe.

=== Import bans ===
An import ban imposed in 1989 by the United States on Indian mangoes, including the Alphonso, was lifted in April 2007. However, the mangoes needed to be treated before entering the country in order to stop the introduction of non-native fruit flies, destructive fungi, and other pests that could harm American agriculture. The European Union imposed a ban beginning in April 2014 on import of mangoes after finding &quot;non-European fruit flies&quot; in some consignments, creating a significant threat to UK salad crops. The Indian government had described this decision as arbitrary and businesses claimed they would suffer financial losses due to the ban.

In January 2015, the European Commission lifted the ban following significant improvements in the Indian mango export system.

<text>Lieutenant General Abid Al-Hamid Mahmud al-Tikriti ( ; ) (21 September 1957 – 7 June 2012) was an Iraqi military officer and Saddam Hussein&#x27;s personal secretary.

==Biography==
Mahmud began his military career as a non-commissioned officer in the Iraqi Army. He rose through the ranks to Lieutenant-General, becoming part of Saddam Hussein&#x27;s personal bodyguard detail, and finally, his personal secretary.

A distant cousin of Saddam Hussein, observers regarded Mahmud as being Hussein&#x27;s right-hand man. He always maintained constant contact with Hussein and acted as a gatekeeper, controlling access to him. He was trusted, along with Saddam&#x27;s son Qusay Hussein, in overseeing the Iraqi Special Security Organization.

He was designated &quot;ace of diamonds&quot; in the U.S. administration&#x27;s most-wanted Iraqi playing cards and fourth on the most-wanted list after Saddam and his sons Uday and Qusay.

He was captured in a joint raid by members of B Squadron Delta Force and G Squadron SAS and the 1st Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment of 1st Brigade, 4th Infantry Division, in Tikrit on 16 June 2003. At the time it was recognized as the &quot;greatest success&quot; since the end of major hostilities, and a sign that Saddam Hussein might soon be found. 

On 29 April 2008, he appeared before the Iraq Special Tribunal set up by the Iraq Interim Government and stood trial with six others including Tariq Aziz, Ali Hassan al-Majid, Watban Ibrahim al-Hassan and Sabbawi Ibrahim al-Hassan.

On 26 October 2010, he was sentenced to death by the Iraqi High Tribunal after being found guilty of crimes against humanity and genocide for organizing a crackdown against banned political parties in Iraq in the 1980s and 1990s, including assassinations and unlawful detentions.

On 7 June 2012, he was executed by hanging, according to a spokesman of the Iraqi Ministry of Justice.

<text>The Aktiengesellschaft für Automobilbau (= corporation for automotive engineering, abbreviation A.G.A. or AGA) was a German producer of cars in the 1920s in the German capital of Berlin (Prussia).

The company was founded as &quot;Autogen-Gas-Akkumulator-AG&quot; in Berlin in 1909 as the German subsidiary of the Swedish company Aktiebolaget Gasaccumulator, since 2000 a part of the German Linde group. During World War I the company produced parts for machine-guns, and had a new factory constructed on Herzbergstraße in the suburb of Lichtenberg. The company was rebranded as &quot;Aktiengesellschaft für Automobilbau&quot; in 1920, but AGA was refounded at the same time, so that both gas and automotive versions of the company existed simultaneously. In 1922 AGA became part of Stinnes-trust. AGA continued to be active after 1945 in West Berlin. Those data are based on the commercial register in the Berlin Landesarchiv.

The first car, the Typ A of 1919, had a 1418 cc four-cylinder engine driving the rear wheels through a three-speed manual transmission. The later Typ C followed in 1921 with the same configuration, and its engine gave a maximum of as did the Typ A. The Typ C extended the wheelbase from to , increased the engine&#x27;s power output to , and even added brakes to all four wheels. Only very few cars of that kind were built. Never realized was a Typ D. This type had in the very beginning . The car was without much obvious technical ambition, but it was robust and inexpensive for its size, becoming popular especially with small business owners despite its dire brakes. In several cities, including Berlin and Breslau, it was for some time a popular car for use as a taxi.

After the death of Hugo Stinnes in 1924, AGA ran into cashflow difficulties, which ended in the company&#x27;s bankruptcy at the end of 1925. Stinnes&#x27; son Edmund had been trying to implement a very expensive assembly line production at AGA, but never finished the project.

There were also plans for a small 850cc car to be built under licence from Singer Motors, and a six-cylinder model, but these never reached the production stage. However, production from 1926 was severely curtailed, and ended in 1929. By that time between 8,000 and 12,000 AGA cars were produced.

AGA cars featured in a number of races, with notable Willy Loge as one of the drivers. For the 1924 Targa Florio AGA produced a small number of the TF 6/30 PS sports cars featuring a 1490cc engine. AGA won many races and was entered in the 1926 German Grand Prix. Other racers also drove AGA cars.

The Swedish company Thulin made around a hundred AGA cars under licence between 1920 and 1924.

<doc id="851037" wikidata="Q1552950" url="?curid=851037" title="Guayabera">
<text>The guayabera (), also known as &quot;camisa de Yucatán&quot; (Yucatán shirt) in Mexico, is a men&#x27;s summer shirt, worn outside the trousers, distinguished by two columns of closely sewn pleats running the length of the front and back of the shirt. Typically made of linen, silk, or cotton, and appropriate for hot and/or humid weather, guayaberas are popular in Mexico, Central America, the Caribbean (especially Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Puerto Rico), South America, Southeast Asia, Spain (specifically Andalucia and the Canary Islands), and Portugal.

==Design==
The design of a typical guayabera is distinguished by several details:
* Either two or four patch pockets and two vertical rows of &quot;alforzas&quot; (fine, tiny pleats, usually 10, sewn closely together) run down the front and three down the back of the shirt. The pockets are detailed with &quot;alforzas&quot; that are identical to, and aligned with, the &quot;alforzas&quot; on the body of the shirt.
* Long or short sleeves, the more common being the short-sleeved version, having a cuffed sleeve with a single decorative button.
* Some shirt designs include slits on either side, and these include two or three buttons. The bottom has a straight hem and is never tucked into the trousers.
* The top of each pocket is usually adorned with a matching shirt button, as are the bottoms of the &quot;alforza&quot; pleats. Vertical rows of adjusting buttons are often used at the bottom hem. While most versions of the design have no placket covering the buttons, a few newer designs do.
Though traditionally worn in white and pastels, guayaberas are now available in many solid colors.

Mexican guayaberas often use complicated embroidery as a supplement to the traditional &quot;alforzas&quot;. This style originated in Mérida, Mexico.

==History==
The exact origin of the garment is unknown, although some stories attribute the shirt to the people of the Philippines who introduced the design to Mexico via the Manila-Acapulco galleon trade, from there spreading to Cuba and the rest of the Caribbean. Specifically, the design is believed to be from the lace-like white Philippine barong Tagalog, which has documented origins in the Philippines prior to the arrival of the Spanish.

Some scholars dispute the Philippine origin based on perceived design differences. The barong traditionally does not have pockets and has an intricate U-shaped embroidery around the chest (the &quot;pechera&quot;) which is mostly absent in Cuban guayaberas. Guayaberas are also made from linen or cotton, and not the expensive &quot;piña&quot; or &quot;abacá&quot; sheer fabrics used in formal barong (although informal barong worn by the lower classes in the Philippines use common opaque fabrics like linen).

However, guayaberas in Mexico also have chest designs like pleats and embroidery similar to the barong (and in contrast to Cuban guayaberas); they can range from having no pockets to having one, two, or four. This is the reason why Mexicans also claim that it originated from either the state of Veracruz or the Yucatán Peninsula. In Mexico, the same basic style is also known as the &quot;camisa de Yucatán&quot; (Yucatán shirt) or &quot;wedding shirt&quot;.

Regardless, a clearer line of evidence is that guayaberas are actually also referred to as &quot;filipinas&quot; in Yucatán, Mexico, with the former regarded as a variant of the latter. The only difference between the two is the type of collar used. Filipinas have a collar similar to the Nehru or mandarin-style (a style known as the &quot;baro cerrada&quot; in the 19th-century Philippines), while guayaberas have a more typical spread collar. Both filipinas and the derivative guayaberas were the traditional everyday men&#x27;s shirts in Yucatán since the mid-19th century, before they were replaced by western shirts in the early 20th century. The white filipina shirt is still regarded as the traditional formal dress for men in Yucatán, along with the &quot;terno&quot; for women (cf. &quot;traje de Mestiza&quot; of the Philippines). In particular, white filipinas are the traditional shirts worn for the jarana Yucateca dance, paired with white trousers. This suggests an origin from the Philippines that entered Mexico early during the colonial period through Yucatán then to Cuba, where it was later adapted to local fashion and materials.

Cubans also claim the guayabera originated from Cuba. Cuban literature refers to the shirt from 1893, and documentary evidence mentions the shirt in Cuba as early as 1880. The Cuban origin story tells of a poor countryside seamstress sewing large patch-pockets onto her husband&#x27;s shirts for carrying guava (guayabas) from the field. In another version of the story, in 1709 Spanish immigrants from Granada, José Pérez Rodríguez and his wife Encarnación Núñez García arrived in Sancti Spiritus, located along the Yayabo River. José asked his wife to make him a shirt with long sleeves and four large pockets to store his cigars and belongings while he worked. Because it was easy to make, as well as being useful, it soon became a popular garment in that region. Another belief is that the name guayabera is said to have originated from the word &quot;yayabero&quot;, the nickname for those who lived near the Yayabo River in Cuba.

== Wear and use ==
The guayabera is often worn in formal contexts, such as offices and weddings. In Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Mexico, and Puerto Rico, guayaberas are part of the traditional wear for men and may be considered formalwear. In 2010, Cuba reinstated the guayabera as the &quot;official formal dress garment&quot;.

==Political symbolism==
Guayaberas have been worn extensively by a number of Latin American political leaders, including Andrés Manuel López Obrador, Cesar Chavez, Carlos Prío Socarrás, and Fidel Castro. This is often interpreted as a sign of the wearer&#x27;s affiliation with populist political positions. Michael Manley, populist Jamaican prime minister, specifically advocated for the guayabera as an anti-colonialist mode of dress, and conversely the shirt was later banned in Parliament by the conservative Jamaica Labour Party. Similarly, Mexican left-wing populist Luis Echeverría advocated for its use in Mexico in part to symbolize rejection of European and American-style business suits.

U.S. presidents, including Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Barack Obama, have worn the shirts as a sign of solidarity when visiting the Cuban community in Miami and when attending Latin American summits. Visiting politicians are sometimes given the shirts by Cuban American or Latin American political leaders.

==Similar shirts and alternative names==
A variety of similar, lightweight dress shirts exists in other tropical countries. These include:
* In America: the Western shirts with pointed yokes and elaborate embroidery were directly copied from the guayaberas of 19th century Mexican vaqueros.
* In Guyana: a similar or identical shirt is called a &quot;shirt-jac&quot;.
* In Jamaica: the guayabera is called a &quot;bush jacket&quot;.
* In the Dominican Republic: guayaberas are referred to as &quot;chacabana&quot;. They are worn for both formal and casual occasions. In tropical countries like the Dominican Republic, chacabanas are used for black tie events such as weddings, business meetings and even political events.
* In the Philippines: the barong Tagalog shirt has some features which are similar to the guayabera: it is long-sleeved, light, traditionally white, and worn without being tucked in. However, the most traditional styles are decorated with U-shaped embroidery (called the &quot;pechera)&quot;, rather than the guayabera&#x27;s straight pleats, and lack pockets. It is also traditionally made of hand-woven, fine, translucent piña or jusi fiber, rather than linen.
* In Trinidad and Tobago, physicians often wear them because of their practicality; one pocket for pens, one for a prescription pad, another for a stethoscope, etc.

<text>Tory Channel (officially Tory Channel / Kura Te Au) is one of the drowned valleys that form the Marlborough Sounds in New Zealand. Inter-island ferries normally use it as the principal channel between Cook Strait and the Marlborough Sounds.

Tory Channel lies to the south of Arapaoa Island, separating it from the mainland. At its western end it joins the larger Queen Charlotte Sound, which it meets halfway along the latter&#x27;s length. Its eastern end meets Cook Strait close to the strait&#x27;s narrowest point. The Channel is long, averages in width, and is up to deep, with an average channel depth of .

Tory Channel forms a substantial part of the ferry route between Wellington and Picton. Erosion attributed to the wake from the ferries, particularly the new faster ones (discontinued in 2005), has resulted in speed restrictions.

One of the two candidates for the easternmost point in the South Island (along with Cape Campbell) lies at the entrance of Tory Channel. It is called West Head.

Te Āti Awa and Ngāti Tama recognize the channel Kura Te Au as an important historic (food source), and settlement for Te Āti Awa. The channel was used as a primary highway by Te Āti Awa, and is still monitored and defended by the iwi in the environmental courts.

The name Kura Te Au originates from the red colour of the sea caused by a variety of plankton and the high populations of crustacean krill. According to legend, Kura Te Au is where Kupe killed the giant, mythical octopus, Te Wheke-a-Muturangi, causing its blood to run through the channel, turning the water red. Kurahaupō and Rangitāne give the meaning &quot;the red current&quot; for Kura Te Au.

James Cook anchored several times in the nearby bay he named Ship Cove. He sighted the Tory Channel in an excursion on the pinnace from his ship HMS &quot;Resolution&quot; on 5 November 1774. John Guard established the first permanent whaling station on Arapaoa Island in 1827, targeting whales in the Tory Channel for their baleen and whale oil. Another whaler, John Stein, navigated the areas between Queen Charlotte Sound and Cloudy Bay in his whaling barque William the Fourth, and found &quot;a very large navigable river ... which he named William the Fourth River.&quot; According to Robert McNab&#x27;s 1913 book &#x27;The Old Whaling Days&#x27;, which drew upon the knowledge of John Duncan, a resident of the Sound, to identify the locations visited by Stein in his 1832 voyage, this &#x27;river&#x27; is now known as the Tory Channel. Tory Channel was accurately surveyed in 1840 and named after the New Zealand Company ship &quot;Tory&quot;, a pioneer ship that brought British colonists to Wellington. Around this time, whaling stations were already operating in Te Awaiti Bay. Between 1911 and 1964, the Perano family hunted whales from Whekenui Bay. Humpback whales were spotted from the hills at the Tory Channel entrance during their migration through Cook Strait. The Perano Whaling Station was the last whaling operation in New Zealand and closed in 1964.

The name of the channel was officially altered to Tory Channel / Kura Te Au in August 2014.

==Tidal power==

Energy Pacifica planned to install up to ten underwater tidal stream turbines, each able to produce up to 1.2 MW, near the Cook Strait entrance to Tory Channel. They claimed Tory Channel had tidal flows of with good bathymetry and access to the electricity network. Other designs envisaged up to 50 turbines, but there are uncertainties about flow rates, the area is about from the HVDC Inter-Island transmission station at Ōraumoa / Fighting Bay and a calculation in 2013 suggested that an economic return was unlikely.

<text>Mary Lambert Gary (born October 13, 1951) is an American director. She has directed music videos, television episodes and feature films, mainly in the horror genre.

==Life and career==
Lambert was born in Helena, Arkansas, the daughter of Martha Kelly and Jordan Bennett Lambert III, a rice and cotton farmer. Her younger sister is former U.S. Senator Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas. Lambert graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design with a B.F.A.

==Music Videos==
=== Chris Isaak Music Video &amp; MTV Award Nominations ===

Lambert directed Chris Isaak‘s first music video, “Dancin’,” which earned two nominations at the 1985 MTV Music Video Awards for Most Experimental Video and Best Direction. That same year, she received a third nomination for directing Lone Justice‘s “Ways to Be Wicked,” also in the Most Experimental Video category. Lambert was the only woman nominated at the ceremony and accounted for half of the nominations in that category.

=== Music Videos for Madonna ===

Mary Lambert directed several of Madonna&#x27;s most iconic music videos during the 1980s, contributing significantly to the singer&#x27;s visual identity and artistic evolution.

Lambert&#x27;s collaboration with Madonna began by directing the video for &quot;Borderline&quot; (1984), which depicted Madonna torn between love and ambition in Los Angeles. &quot;Borderline,&quot; filmed on location in Los Angeles, California, from January 30 to February 2, 1984. The video, which juxtaposed colorful scenes in the barrio with black-and-white shots in a photography studio, tells the story of a young woman torn between her Hispanic boyfriend and a British photographer.

Lambert described the process as highly improvisational, stating there was &quot;no formula&quot; and that they were &quot;inventing it as we went along”. In describing the video&#x27;s narrative, Lambert told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;: &quot;[A] boy and [a] girl enjoy simple pleasures of barrio love; girl is tempted by fame, boy gets huffy, girl gets famous, but her new beau&#x27;s out-of-line reaction to a behavioral trifle (all she did was spray-paint his expensive sports car) drives her back to her true love&quot;.

&quot;Borderline&quot; premiered on MTV in March 1984 and became one of the videos that helped establish Madonna&#x27;s early image. Years later, it was included in Madonna&#x27;s video compilations &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot; (1990) and &quot;&quot; (2009).

Lambert went on to direct &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (1984), filmed in Venice, Italy, and New York. The video, featuring Madonna in a gondola and wearing a wedding dress, incorporated symbolic imagery such as a lion, reflecting Lambert&#x27;s vision of combining fantasy and reality.

In 1985, Lambert directed the &quot;Material Girl&quot; video, paying homage to Marilyn Monroe&#x27;s performance of &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl&#x27;s Best Friend&quot; from *Gentlemen Prefer Blondes*. The video blended commentary on fame and materialism, becoming one of Madonna&#x27;s most recognizable works.

Lambert&#x27;s direction of &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot; (1987) featured Madonna portraying both a devout Catholic woman and a vibrant Flamenco dancer, exploring Latin influences and religious symbolism.

In 1989, Lambert directed &quot;Like a Prayer,&quot; which became one of Madonna&#x27;s most controversial videos due to its use of religious imagery, including burning crosses and references to stigmata. Lambert aimed to explore themes of sexual and religious ecstasy, sparking widespread debate and cementing Madonna&#x27;s reputation as a provocative artist.

Through these videos, Lambert played a key role in shaping the visual narratives during a time that Madonna was being propelled to global stardom.

=== Music Videos for Janet Jackson ===

Mary Lambert directed Janet Jackson‘s iconic music videos for “Nasty” and “Control.” The “Control” video, known for its storyline of Jackson asserting independence from her parents, was filmed at the Grand Olympic Auditorium in Los Angeles – but behind the scenes, the production was fraught with challenges.

Both Lambert and producer Sharon Oreck recall it as a difficult and trying experience; Oreck said in 2011 that it was her &quot;worst nightmare&quot; of the many videos she had produced. The crowd, which had been told that they would see Janet Jackson perform, had expected a free concert. The audience, expecting a free Janet Jackson concert, instead endured 50 takes of Jackson lip-syncing “Control.”

At the time, Jackson was in the process of firing her father, Joe Jackson, as her manager. His presence loomed over the set, with Lambert and Oreck recalling how he angrily demanded $1 million in liability insurance before allowing Janet to sit on a trapeze used in the video. When Lambert and Oreck threatened to walk off the project unless the issue was addressed, the record label reluctantly stepped in, telling them, “We don&#x27;t say no to Joe Jackson.”

Tensions escalated further when the label requested more white audience members to be visible on camera. Lambert quietly rearranged the crowd, but when they realized what was happening, the crowd grew angry. Lambert told the record company representative that she absolutely could not go on due to the potential for violence, and he went out and explained things to the crowd, which calmed down enough to complete the video.

Despite the difficulties, Lambert successfully directed the video to completion. In 1988, the song won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R&amp;B/Soul or Rap Music Video, beating out her brother Michael, Whitney Houston, and Jody Watley.

=== Additional Collaborations ===

Annie Lennox: Mary Lambert directed the music video for &quot;Walking on Broken Glass,&quot; showcasing Lennox in a period setting inspired by the film &quot;Dangerous Liaisons&quot;.

Mick Jagger: Lambert directed the video for &quot;Just Another Night,&quot; featuring Jagger performing in a nightclub setting, reflecting the song&#x27;s energetic rock style.

The Go-Go&#x27;s: She directed the video for &quot;Turn to You,&quot; which presents a 1960s prom scenario, aligning with the band&#x27;s upbeat pop-rock sound.

Whitney Houston: Lambert directed the video for &quot;So Emotional,&quot; capturing Houston&#x27;s dynamic stage performance and behind-the-scenes moments, highlighting her vocal prowess.

Alison Krauss: She directed the video for &quot;When You Say Nothing at All,&quot; emphasizing Krauss&#x27;s emotive performance in a simple, elegant setting.

Mötley Crüe: She directed the video for &quot;Smokin&#x27; in the Boys Room,&quot; depicting a rebellious high school scenario, aligning with the band&#x27;s hard rock image.

Queensrÿche: Lambert directed the video for &quot;The Lady Wore Black,&quot; featuring the band&#x27;s performance interspersed with thematic imagery, complementing the song&#x27;s dark tones.

Sting: She directed the video for &quot;Russians,&quot; utilizing stark imagery to underscore the song&#x27;s commentary on Cold War tensions.

Debbie Harry: Lambert directed the video for &quot;I Want That Man,&quot; showcasing Harry in a stylized, futuristic setting, reflecting the song&#x27;s pop sensibilities.

Tom Tom Club: She directed the video for &quot;Genius of Love,&quot; featuring vibrant, animated sequences that match the song&#x27;s eclectic style.

==Films==

In 1987, she released her first feature film, the stylish and controversial &quot;Siesta&quot;, starring Ellen Barkin and Jodie Foster. It was nominated for the IFP Spirit Award for Best First Feature, losing to &quot;Dirty Dancing&quot;. 

She is known to horror fans for directing the 1989 adaptation of Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; and its sequel, &quot;Pet Sematary Two&quot;. 

More recently, Lambert directed 2005&#x27;s &quot;Urban Legends: Bloody Mary&quot; and the 2011 Syfy horror film &quot;Mega Python vs. Gatoroid&quot;. She also directed the 1993 Digital Pictures FMV video game &quot;Double Switch&quot;.

=== &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; (1989) ===
In 1989, Mary Lambert directed &quot;Pet Sematary&quot;, a supernatural horror film based on Stephen King&#x27;s 1983 novel of the same name. The project marked the first film adaptation of King&#x27;s work, with King himself penning the screenplay. Starring Dale Midkiff, Denise Crosby, Blaze Berdahl, Fred Gwynne, and Miko Hughes as Gage Creed, the film&#x27;s title uses a sensational spelling of &quot;pet cemetery&quot;. 

The film premiered on April 21, 1989, and achieved significant box office success, grossing $57.5 million on an $11.5 million budget. The popularity of the film led to a sequel, &quot;Pet Sematary Two&quot;, which was released in 1992 with Lambert returning as director. 

Development for the film began in 1984 when the rights were initially sold to George A. Romero for $10,000. However, Romero was unable to proceed with the project due to scheduling conflicts with &quot;Monkey Shines&quot;. The project languished until the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike, when Paramount Pictures faced a potential shortage of films for 1989. King&#x27;s screenplay for &quot;Pet Sematary&quot; was complete, prompting Paramount to greenlight the project. 

When it came to selecting a director, King retained creative control and personally chose Mary Lambert. She won him over with her passion for his work and her dedication to staying true to the novel&#x27;s tone and themes. 

Filming took place on location in Maine, honoring King&#x27;s stipulation that the film be shot in the same state where the novel is set. Locations included Ellsworth, Bangor, and Mount Hope Cemetery, with King actively involved throughout production. He regularly consulted with Lambert, offering input and collaborating on key decisions to ensure the adaptation preserved the essence of his novel. 

During the casting process, Lambert faced resistance from studio executives. She insisted on casting two-year-old Miko Hughes as Gage Creed, despite the studio&#x27;s preference for using twins, which was the standard cost-effective practice for child roles. Lambert felt Hughes had a natural talent that could not be duplicated. She also fought to cast Fred Gwynne as Jud Crandall, despite concerns that his previous role as Herman Munster would prevent audiences from taking him seriously. 

Another creative decision by Lambert involved the character of Zelda, Rachel Creed&#x27;s sister. Initially, young actresses auditioned for the role, but Lambert ultimately cast Andrew Hubatsek in order to heighten the unsettling nature of the character. 

The film&#x27;s conclusion was changed at Paramount&#x27;s request. Lambert originally filmed a more ambiguous ending, in which Rachel Creed returns as an undead figure, leaving her husband&#x27;s fate uncertain. However, the studio wanted a more graphic climax, resulting in reshoots to depict Rachel attacking Louis Creed. 

The film&#x27;s soundtrack included music by the Ramones, one of King&#x27;s favorite bands. Lambert, having a personal friendship with the band through her work directing music videos, requested they write and perform the track &quot;Pet Sematary,&quot; which plays over the closing credits.

<text>Dilvish, the Damned is a collection of fantasy stories by American writer Roger Zelazny, first published in 1982. Its contents were originally published as a series of separate short stories in various fantasy magazines. Prior to publication, Zelazny&#x27;s working title for the book was &quot;Nine Black Doves&quot;. The working title was later re-used for the fifth volume of &quot;The Collected Short Stories of Roger Zelazny&quot; collection, as a tribute to Dilvish. The storyline begun in this collection was resolved in the novel &quot;The Changing Land&quot;, which was published before the other &quot;Dilvish&quot; stories appeared in book form.

==Plot summary==
Dilvish is the descendant of both elves and humans, a scion of a prominent Elven house and &quot;the Human House that hath been stricken&quot; which lost its peerage for mixing Elven and Human blood. Hundreds of years before the main story, he comes across a dark ritual being performed by the sorcerer Jelerak who is sacrificing a human girl. He attempts to stop the ritual but is turned into stone, with his soul banished to Hell. His body becomes a statue, and for many decades it resides within the square of a nearby town that he had formerly saved from enemy conquerors. When this town is again in need of a hero, their citizens&#x27; plight allows Dilvish the passage he needs to escape from Hell. He returns to the world of the living with his steed, the metal demon horse Black, and a burning desire for revenge against Jelerak, but must first repulse the assault against the endangered town. Dilvish then goes to call upon the Shoredan - a cursed people bound to his family. He searches for Jelerak in the Tower of Ice and finds the sorcerer&#x27;s apprentice and his sister trapped there. The two of them believe him to be a servant of Jelerak, sent to kill them.

<text>The Airedale is an English automobile made in Esholt, near Shipley, West Yorkshire. It was the successor to the Tiny made by Nanson, Barker &amp; Co in the same town from 1911 until the outbreak of war in 1914.

==History==
After the war in 1919 a larger car was developed and the company name changed to Airedale. This new model was rated at 12 hp and had a 1795 cc four-cylinder overhead-valve Dorman KNO engine with Zenith carburettor producing at 1500 rpm. Drive to the rear wheels was through a four-speed gearbox and plate clutch. The car had a wheelbase of and overall length of with conventional half elliptic leaf springs all round. It seems to have also been known as the 12/24 and 11.9 hp. In 1922 they had sufficient confidence to take a stand at the London Motor Show and the name of the company was changed from Nanson, Barker and Company to Airedale Cars. The cars at the show were priced at £575 for a special coupé, £435 for a 4-seat tourer, £425 for a 2-seater with dickey and £375 for a bare chassis.

A larger Meadows engine of 2120 cc was offered in the similar 14hp model from 1922. This car was slightly larger with a wheelbase and total length. A bare chassis was £360, an open two-seater cost £425 and a limousine £625.

Apart from the engines nearly all parts including gearboxes were made on site by Airedale themselves. The cars were very well finished and equipped, which made them expensive. Approximately 90 cars were made, about 55 of the 12 hp and 35 of the 14 hp models.

The company went into liquidation in September 1924, a revival was attempted in 1927 but also failed. No cars are known to survive.

<doc id="851060" wikidata="Q1366544" url="?curid=851060" title="Cetacean stranding">
<text>Cetacean stranding, commonly known as beaching, is a phenomenon in which whales and dolphins strand themselves on land, usually on a beach. Beached whales often die due to dehydration, collapsing under their own weight, or drowning when high tide covers the blowhole. Cetacean stranding has occurred since before recorded history.

Several explanations for why cetaceans strand themselves have been proposed, including changes in water temperatures, peculiarities of whales&#x27; echolocation in certain surroundings, and geomagnetic disturbances, but none have so far been universally accepted as a definitive reason for the behavior. However, a link between the mass beaching of beaked whales and use of mid-frequency active sonar has been found.

Whales that die due to stranding can subsequently decay and bloat to the point where they can explode, causing gas and their internal organs to fly out.

==Species==
Every year, up to 2,000 animals beach themselves. Although the majority of strandings result in death, they pose no threat to any species as a whole. Only about ten cetacean species frequently display mass beachings, with ten more rarely doing so.

All frequently-involved species are toothed whales (Odontoceti), rather than baleen whales (Mysticeti). These species share some characteristics which may explain why they beach.

Body size does not normally affect the frequency, but both the animals&#x27; normal habitat and social organization do appear to influence their chances of coming ashore in large numbers. Odontocetes that normally inhabit deep waters and live in large, tightly knit groups are the most susceptible. This includes the sperm whale, oceanic dolphins, usually pilot and Orcas, and a few beaked whale species. The most common species to strand in the United Kingdom is the harbour porpoise; the common dolphin (&quot;Delphinus delphis&quot;) is second-most common, and after that long-finned pilot whales (&quot;Globicephala melas&quot;).

Solitary species naturally do not strand en masse. Cetaceans that spend most of their time in shallow, coastal waters almost never mass strand.

==Causes==
Strandings can be grouped into several types. The most obvious distinction is between single and multiple strandings. Many theories, some of them controversial, have been proposed to explain beaching, but the question remains unresolved.

;Natural deaths at sea: The carcasses of deceased cetaceans are likely to float to the surface at some point; during this time, currents or winds may carry them to a coastline. Since thousands of cetaceans die every year, many become stranded posthumously. Offshore deaths of multiple whales are unlikely to lead to multiple strandings, since winds and currents are variable and will scatter a group of corpses. Most carcasses never reach the coast, and are scavenged, or decompose enough to sink to the ocean bottom, where the carcass forms the basis of a unique local ecosystem called a &quot;whale fall&quot;. 

;Individual strandings: Single live strandings are often the result of individual illness or injury; in the absence of human intervention these almost inevitably end in death.

;Multiple strandings: Multiple strandings in one place are rare, and often attract media coverage as well as rescue efforts. The strong social cohesion of toothed whale pods appears to be a key factor in many cases of multiple stranding: If one gets into trouble, its distress calls may prompt the rest of the pod to follow and beach themselves alongside.

===Environmental===
Whales have beached throughout human history, with evidence of humans salvaging from stranded sperm whales in southern Spain during the Upper Magdalenian era some 14,000 years before the present. Some strandings can be attributed to natural and environmental factors, such as rough weather, weakness due to old age or infection, difficulty giving birth, hunting too close to shore, or navigation errors.

In 2004, scientists at the University of Tasmania linked whale strandings and weather, hypothesizing that when cool Antarctic waters rich in squid and fish flow north, whales follow their prey closer towards land. In some cases predators (such as killer whales) have been known to panic other whales, herding them towards the shoreline.

Their echolocation system can have difficulty picking up very gently-sloping coastlines. This theory accounts for mass beaching hot spots such as Ocean Beach, Tasmania and Geographe Bay, Western Australia where the slope is about half a degree (approximately deep out to sea). The University of Western Australia Bioacoustics group proposes that repeated reflections between the surface and ocean bottom in gently sloping shallow water may attenuate sound so much that the echo is inaudible to the whales. Stirred up sand as well as long-lived microbubbles formed by rain may further exacerbate the effect.

A 2017 study by scientists from Germany&#x27;s University of Kiel suggests that large geomagnetic disruptions of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, brought on through solar storms, could be another cause for whale beachings. The authors hypothesize that whales navigate using the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field by detecting differences in the field&#x27;s strength to find their way. The solar storms cause anomalies in the field, which may disturb the whales&#x27; ability to navigate, sending them into shallow waters where they get trapped. The study is based on the mass beachings of 29 sperm whales along the coasts of Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and France in 2016.

=== &quot;Follow-me&quot; strandings ===

Some strandings may be caused by larger cetaceans following dolphins and porpoises into shallow coastal waters. The larger animals may habituate to following faster-moving dolphins. If they encounter an adverse combination of tidal flow and seabed topography, the larger species may become trapped.

Sometimes following a dolphin can help lead a whale out of danger: In 2008, a local dolphin was followed out to open water by two pygmy sperm whales that had become lost behind a sandbar at Mahia Beach, New Zealand.

===Orcas&#x27; intentional, temporary strandings===
Pods of killer whales – predators of dolphins and porpoises – very rarely strand. It might be that killer whales have learned to stay away from shallow waters, and that heading to the shallows offers the smaller animals some protection from predators. However, killer whales in Península Valdés, Argentina, and the Crozet Islands in the Indian Ocean &quot;have&quot; learned how to operate in shallow waters, particularly in their pursuit of seals. The killer whales regularly demonstrate their competence by chasing seals up shelving gravel beaches, up to the edge of the water. The pursuing whales are occasionally partially thrust out of the sea by a combination of their own impetus and retreating water, and have to wait for the next wave to re-float them and carry them back to sea.
In Argentina, killer whales are known to hunt on the shore by intentionally beaching themselves and then lunging at nearby seals before riding the next wave safely back into deeper waters. This was first observed in the early 1970s, then hundreds times more since within this pod. This behavior seems to be taught from one generation to the next, evidenced by older individuals nudging juveniles towards the shore, and can sometimes also be a play activity.

===Sonar===
There is evidence that active sonar leads to beaching. On some occasions cetaceans have stranded shortly after military sonar was active in the area, suggesting a link. Theories describing how sonar may cause whale deaths have also been advanced after necropsies found internal injuries in stranded cetaceans. In contrast, some who strand themselves due to seemingly natural causes are usually healthy prior to beaching:
====Direct injury====
The large and rapid pressure changes made by loud sonar can cause hemorrhaging. Evidence emerged after 17 cetaceans were hauled out in the Bahamas in March 2000 following a United States Navy sonar exercise. The Navy accepted blame agreeing that the dead whales experienced acoustically induced hemorrhages around the ears. The resulting disorientation probably led to the stranding. Ken Balcomb, a cetologist, specializes in the killer whale populations that inhabit the Strait of Juan de Fuca between Washington and Vancouver Island. He investigated these beachings and argues that the powerful sonar pulses resonated with airspaces in the dolphins, tearing tissue around the ears and brain. Apparently not all species are affected by sonar.

====Injury at a vulnerable moment====
Another means by which sonar could be hurting cetaceans is a form of decompression sickness. This was first raised by necrological examinations of 14 beaked whales stranded in the Canary Islands. The stranding happened on 24 September 2002, close to the operating area of Neo Tapon, an international naval exercise, about four hours after the activation of mid-frequency sonar. The team of scientists found acute tissue damage from gas-bubble lesions, which are indicative of decompression sickness. 

The precise mechanism of how sonar causes bubble formation is not known. It could be due to cetaceans panicking and surfacing too rapidly in an attempt to escape the sonar pulses. There is also a theoretical basis by which sonar vibrations can cause supersaturated gas to nucleate, forming bubbles, which are responsible for decompression sickness.

====Diving patterns of Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales====
The overwhelming majority of the cetaceans involved in sonar-associated beachings are Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales (&quot;Ziphius cavirostrus&quot;). Individuals of this species strand frequently, but mass strandings are rare.

Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales are an open-ocean species that rarely approach the shore, making them difficult to study in the wild. Prior to the interest raised by the sonar controversy, most of the information about them came from stranded animals. The first to publish research linking beachings with naval activity were Simmonds and Lopez-Jurado in 1991. They noted that over the past decade there had been a number of mass strandings of beaked whales in the Canary Islands, and each time the Spanish Navy was conducting exercises. Conversely, there were no mass strandings at other times. They did not propose a theory for the strandings. Fernández &quot;et al.&quot; in a 2013 letter to &quot;Nature&quot; reported that there had been no further mass strandings in that area, following a 2004 ban by the Spanish government on military exercises in that region.

In May 1996, there was another mass stranding in West Peloponnese, Greece. At the time, it was noted as &quot;atypical&quot; both because mass strandings of beaked whales are rare, and also because the stranded whales were spread over such a long stretch of coast, with each individual whale spatially separated from the next stranding. At the time of the incident, there was no connection made with active sonar; A. Frantzis, the marine biologist investigating the incident, made the connection to sonar because he discovered a notice to mariners concerning the test. His report was published in March 1998.

Peter Tyack, of Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute, has been researching noise&#x27;s effects on marine mammals since the 1970s. He has led much of the recent research on beaked whales (Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales in particular). Data tags have shown that Cuvier&#x27;s dive considerably deeper than previously thought, and are in fact the deepest-diving species of marine mammal yet known.

At shallow depths Cuvier&#x27;s stop vocalizing, either because of fear of predators, or because they don&#x27;t need vocalization to track each other at shallow depths, where they have light adequate to see each other.

Their surfacing behavior is highly unusual, because they exert considerable physical effort to surface by a controlled ascent, rather than passively floating to the surface as sperm whales do. Every deep dive is followed by three or four shallow dives. The elaborate dive patterns are assumed to be necessary to control the diffusion of gases in the bloodstream. No data show a beaked whale making an uncontrolled ascent, or failing to do successive shallow dives. This behavior suggests that the Cuvier&#x27;s are in a vulnerable state after a deep dive – presumably on the verge of decompression sickness – and require time and perhaps the shallower dives to recover.

====Summary review====
De Quirós &quot;et al.&quot; (2019) published a review of evidence on the mass strandings of beaked whale linked to naval exercises where sonar was used. It concluded that the effects of mid-frequency active sonar are strongest on Cuvier&#x27;s beaked whales but vary among individuals or populations. The review suggested the strength of response of individual animals may depend on whether they had prior exposure to sonar, and that symptoms of decompression sickness have been found in stranded whales that may be a result of such response to sonar. It noted that no more mass strandings had occurred in the Canary Islands once naval exercises where sonar was used were banned, and recommended that the ban be extended to other areas where mass strandings continue to occur.

==Disposal==


If a whale is beached near an inhabited locality, the rotting carcass can pose a nuisance as well as a health risk. Such very large carcasses are difficult to move. The whales are often towed back out to sea away from shipping lanes, allowing them to decompose naturally, or they are towed out to sea and blown up with explosives. Government-sanctioned explosions have occurred in South Africa, Iceland, Australia and United States. If the carcass is older, it is buried.

In New Zealand, which is the site of many whale strandings, treaties with the indigenous Māori people allow the tribal gathering and customary (that is, traditional) use of whalebone from any animal which has died as a result of stranding. Whales are regarded as &quot;taonga&quot; (spiritual treasure), descendants of the ocean god, Tangaroa, and are as such held in very high respect. Sites of whale strandings and any whale carcasses from strandings are treated as &quot;tapu&quot; sites, that is, they are regarded as sacred ground.

== Health risks ==
A beached whale carcass should not be consumed. In 2002, fourteen Alaskans ate &quot;muktuk&quot; (whale blubber) from a beached whale, resulting in eight of them developing botulism, with two of the affected requiring mechanical ventilation. This is a possibility for any meat taken from an unpreserved carcass.

==Large strandings==
This is a list of large cetacean strandings (200 or more).

On June 23, 2015, 337 dead whales were discovered in a remote fjord in Patagonia, southern Chile, the largest stranding of baleen whales to date. Three hundred and five bodies and 32 skeletons were identified by aerial and satellite photography between the Gulf of Penas and Puerto Natales, near the southern tip of South America. They may have been sei whales. This is one of only two or three such baleen mass stranding events in the last hundred years. It is highly unusual for baleen whales to strand other than singly, and these Patagonia strandings are tentatively attributed to an unusual cause such as ingestion of poisonous algae.

In November 2018, over 140 whales were witnessed stranded on a remote beach in New Zealand and had to be euthanised because of their declining health condition. In July 2019, nearly 50 long-finned pilot whales were found stranded on Snaefellsnes Peninsula in Iceland. However, they were already dead when spotted.

On the evening of November 2, 2020, over 100 short-finned pilot whales were stranded on the Panadura Beach in western coast of Sri Lanka. Four deaths were reported, and all other whales were rescued.

<text>Amanda Jane Platell (born 12 November 1957) is an Australian journalist. Between 1999 and 2001 she was the press secretary to William Hague, the then leader of the British Conservative Party. She is currently based in the UK.

==Personal life==
Platell was born in Perth, Western Australia. Her father was a journalist working for &quot;The West Australian&quot; newspaper and her mother was a secretary. Platell graduated with an Honours Degree in Politics and Philosophy from the University of Western Australia. Her first job was in 1978 when she joined the &quot;Perth Daily News.&quot;

She has lamented that for medical reasons she has been unable to have children.

==Early British career==
After a backpacking tour of the world with her then fiancé John Chenery, she arrived in London in 1985. Aiming to earn enough money to return home she worked as a freelancer for publications including &quot;The Observer&quot; and the &quot;Sunday Express.&quot;

After being part of the start-up team of &quot;Today,&quot; she then joined Robert Maxwell&#x27;s short-lived &quot;London Daily News,&quot; before returning under &quot;Today&quot; editor David Montgomery in 1987 as deputy editor. In 1993 she was appointed managing editor of the Mirror Group, and then moved in the same year to &quot;The Independent,&quot; initially as marketing director and then managing director.

In 1996 she joined the &quot;Sunday Mirror&quot; as acting editor, where she was the superior of Labour party&#x27;s later director of communications, Alastair Campbell. In 1998 she was appointed acting editor of the &quot;Sunday Express,&quot; a position she was sacked from by Rosie Boycott following the publication of details of Peter Mandelson&#x27;s gay relationship with his Brazilian partner.

In 1999, Platell published a novel &quot;Scandal&quot;, about women in the newspaper industry. &quot;Two editors, one paper, may the best woman win&quot; was how the cover summarised the plot.

It was from 1999 to 2001 that Platell moved into politics to become the Conservative Party&#x27;s head of media, during which she supported William Hague, advising him to just &quot;be yourself&quot; as it was at these times he was his strongest. In her role, Platell made an important contribution to Hague&#x27;s reversion from a modernising agenda to a &#x27;core vote&#x27; strategy pursued during the 1999 European Elections, in which the Conservatives gained the most votes, as well as the 2001 General Election campaign. Hague, however, only managed to make a net gain of 1 seat in 2001, forcing his resignation shortly after the General Election.

==Later media career==

Since 2002, Platell has contributed as a freelancer to the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

On 21 November 2011, at the Leveson Inquiry into the culture, practice and ethics of the British press, Hugh Grant accused Platell of a &quot;hatchet job&quot; on his recent fatherhood following an article she wrote for the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;.

She has written articles calling for greater restrictions on Internet pornography.

Platell regularly reviewed the Sunday newspapers on &quot;The Andrew Marr Show&quot;.

In 2020 the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; paid damages of £25,000 to the Cambridge academic Professor Priyamvada Gopal and agreed to pay her legal costs after Platell libellously claimed, citing fake tweets, that she was &quot;attempting to incite an aggressive and potentially violent race war&quot;.

<text>Soyuz TM-16 was the sixteenth expedition to the Russian Space Station Mir.

The Soyuz-TM crew transports (T - транспортный - Transportnyi - meaning transport, M - модифицированный - Modifitsirovannyi- meaning modified) were fourth generation (1986–2002) Soyuz spacecraft used for ferry flights to the Mir and ISS space stations. It added to the Soyuz-T new docking and rendezvous, radio communications, emergency and integrated parachute/landing engine systems. The new Kurs rendezvous and docking system permitted the Soyuz-TM to maneuver independently of the station, without the station making &quot;mirror image&quot; maneuvers to match unwanted translations introduced by earlier models&#x27; aft-mounted attitude control.

==Crew==
==Mission highlights==
16th expedition to Mir.

First Soyuz without a probe and drogue docking system since 1976. It carried
an APAS-89 androgynous docking unit different from the APAS-75 unit used for ASTP in 1975, yet similar in general principles. Soyuz-TM 16 used it to dock with an androgynous docking port on the Kristall module. This was a test of the docking system in preparation for dockings by the Space Shuttles with Mir.

<text>Philip Pocock is a Canadian artist, photographer and researcher. He was born in Ottawa, Ontario, in 1954. Since the early 1990s, his work has been collaborative, situational, time-, code-, net-based and participatory.

In photography, in the 1980s, Philip Pocock produced two bodies of photographic works: lyrical documentary explorations in New York and Berlin; as well as alchemical Cibachrome photographs. In 1980, &quot;The Obvious Illusion: Murals from the Lower East Side&quot;, a monograph of his color photographs, was published by George Braziller to accompany public exhibitions of his Cibachrome photographs at the Cooper Union, in New York, in 1980, and the Art Gallery of Ontario, in Toronto, in 1981.

In New York City, in 1988, collaborating with the painter, John Zinsser, Philip Pocock co-founded, co-published, co-edited, and designed on an Apple Macintosh Plus and Laserwriter, the early low-cost, interview-based, desktop-published &quot;Journal of Contemporary Art&quot;, announced in the &quot;New York Times&quot; 1988-01-22.

Relocating to Europe, in 1990, Philip Pocock continued collaborative practice, painting and drawing with German artist Walter Dahn, song lyrics from American popular music sources, from the Blues to Indie, under the label &quot;Music Security Administration&quot;, in Cologne, from 1993 to 1995, before entering telecommunication space with FAX performance, database cinema and cybernetic installation from 1993 onward.

In 1993, with Swiss photographer Felix Stephan Huber, Philip Pocock extended collaborative practice with digital cameras, laptops and a Fax modem, co-producing for the Venice Biannual&#x27;s Electronic Café, a digital performance and facsimile book, &quot;Black Sea Diary&quot;.

In 1995, Huber and Pocock created an art weblog, mixing regularly posted live journal, sound and video entries with emails from their users&#x27; forum on the web. Travel-art-art-as-information, a cyber-roadmovie, &quot;Arctic Circle&quot; investigates contemporary loneliness, taking the duo by van from Vancouver, British Columbia, over thousands of kilometers, to walk along the Arctic Circle in Canada&#x27;s northern wilderness, simultaneously searching for any sign of life on the other side, the cyber-side, of their laptop screens. Driving, acting, uploading, what began as 1970s conceptual performance mutated into 1990s pulp melodrama when two hitchhikers, Nora and Nicolas, hopped on board, all becoming fictional characters playing in a digital documentary of their own making. &quot;Arctic Circle&quot; was produced for the traveling exhibition &quot;Fotographie nach der Fotographie&quot;, in 1995-97, included in documenta X, in 1997.

Philip Pocock was invited by documenta X&#x27;s director, Catherine David, in 1996, to produce an Internet cinema piece for the event in 1997. He presented the work in the context of the &quot;documenta X - 100 Days 100 Guests&quot; event. For [ A Description of the Equator and Some ØtherLands] Philip Pocock assembled longtime collaborator, Felix Stephan Huber, Udo Noll, and Florian Wenz, to produce an early online, user-generated, database-driven hypercinematic work, which introduced the term Tag (metadata), taking Pocock and Wenz first to Uganda, then Pocock and Noll to the Java Sea to traverse the Earth&#x27;s equator, and with thousands of users pursue the potential one of &quot;corresponding identities&quot; in cyberspace. &quot;A Description of the Equator and Some ØtherLands&quot; was coded with open source software: php1.0 msql on a Redhat linux operating system. Philip Pocock did not visit the site of his collaboration at the documenta X in Kassel, until he participated as a guest speaker in its 100 Days 100 Guests programme, 1997-08-23.

In 1999, with another group of collaborators, notably the Italian architecture collective, Gruppo A12, net programmer Daniel Burckhardt, Brazilian artist Roberto Cabot, Thing.net founder Wolfgang Staehle, as well as the &quot;Equator&quot; group, Philip Pocock produced &quot;H|u|m|b|o|t&quot; for the ZKM Center for Art and Media&#x27;s &quot;net_condition&quot; exhibition in Karlsruhe, Germany, initiated with support from the Goethe-Institut, Caracas, Venezuela. H|u|m|b|o|t is a movie-mapping, an atlas plotted to ubiquitous screens, transmitted from a database of text and video, mapped as a single screen-world, with the help of an intelligent, self-organizing mapping algorithm from the Finnish mathematician, Teuvo Kohonen. &quot;H|u|m|b|o|t&quot;s text source was Alexander von Humboldt&#x27;s scientific travelogue, &quot;Personal Narrative of a Journey to the Equinoctial Regions of the New Continent 1799–1804&quot;, each paragraph of which was specifically identified according to its Global Positioning GPS meta-data, as well as annotated with emotion, keyword and location markers, using &quot;H|u|m|b|o|t&quot;s XML editor. This meta-data translates into a topography of Humboldt&#x27;s historical narrative, tagged, visually and semantically connecting clusters of text to one shared screen (FLATBOOK), collated with contemporary videos from Venezuela and Cuba by H|u|m|b|o† authors (FLATMOVIE). Together, an atlas is composed through which users travel, each logged as possible itineraries for future users. H|u|m|b|o|t was installed in Hans Ulrich Obrist&#x27;s &quot;Voilà: Le monde dans la tête&quot; exhibition at the Musée d-art moderne, Paris, 2000.

In 2002, pre-YouTube, &quot;UNMOVIE&quot;, a future cinema, codes tagged, user-generated, flash video on-the-fly, the &quot;UNMOVIE Stream&quot;, mashed up from words generated by synthespian dialogue from the &quot;UNMOVIE Stage&quot;. Synthespians ([Chatterbots]) were coded from: the entire oeuvre of &quot;Bob Dylan&quot;, &quot;Beyond Good and Evil&quot; by &quot;Nietzsche&quot;, &quot;Sculpting in Time&quot; by &quot;Tarkovsky&quot;, &quot;The Philosophy of Andy Warhol&quot; by &quot;Drella&quot;, anecdotes by the 13th-century Zen master &quot;Dogen&quot;, male-female cybersex chat from &quot;Geisha&quot;, and visitors to the &quot;Stage&quot;, &quot;You_01 - 06&quot;. As the synthespians match words, some are sent to the database to cull user video to play on the &#x27;Stage&#x27;. With info architect, Axel Heide, sculptor, Gregor Stehle, and designers, Onesandzeros, Philip Pocock produced &quot;UNMOVIE&quot; for the traveling &quot;Future Cinema: The Cinematic Imaginary After Film&quot; exhibition at ZKM Karlsruhe. &quot;UNMOVIE&quot; opened in November 2001, and has been writing itself and playing 24-7 ever since. &quot;UNMOVIE&quot; has been installed at the Kiasma, Helsinki, Finland, and the NTT InterCommunication Center (ICC) gallery, Tokyo, Japan.
In 2006, Philip Pocock created &quot;SpacePlace: Art in the Age of Orbitization&quot; with Peter Weibel, ZKM, Axel Heide and Onesandzeros. As well as being an on-line, web2.0, Mashup (digital) and repository for Outer Space-related art and culture, the SpacePlace database generated a multimedia platform, &quot;SpacePlace mobile&quot;, as well as a dual-screen, free public access Bluetooth installation for specific locations, such as ZKMax, Munich, Germany, where urban guest were greeted by a cellphone message and projected video wobbling to the sound of outer space, opening June 7, 2006, in support of the [United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs] conference in Vienna to check and balance peaceful and cultural utilization of near Earth orbit. and beyond.

Philip Pocock produced and directed in collaboration with several art and design school students and grads, the ZKM Island YOUniverse in Second Life, with cyber-robotic avatars, avatar-sensing cinema structures, participatory and converging with a Moblog and mobile media sculpture presented at the &quot;YOU_ser: The Century of the Consumer&quot; exhibition curated by Peter Weibel at ZKM, Karlsruhe. User-generated images are emailed to Second Life mashup cinemas. ZKM Island in Second Life presents vitrine architecture in a globally warmed wasteland, each supermodern structure&#x27;s components simultaneously screen, wall and window, sensitive to avatar movement and orientation. A Boxing Ring where avatars can get in the ring with six German cultural theorists and philosophy cyber-robotic avatars and punch it out while waxing philosophy, just for fun.

Commissioned by the Seville Biannual (BIACS), Spain, in 2008, Philip Pocock collaboratively produced with Alex Wenger, Linus Stolz, Julian Finn, Daniel Burckhardt and other students &quot;Aland: Scopic Regimes of Uncertainty&quot;, three telescopic, participatory, multi-screen sculptures that converse incessantly and convivially. Alan∂, short for Al-Andalus, a rare moment of cultural conviviality on the Iberian Peninsula between the 8th and 15th centuries, begins with an artificially intelligent, incessant dialogue between Federico García Lorca, raised in Christian Andalusia (his 20th-century poetry), Moses Maimonides (his 11th-century book, &quot;A Guide for the Perplexed&quot;), and Muhammad Ibn Tufail (his 11th-century novel, &quot;Alive, Son of Awake&quot;) Jewish and Muslim Al-Andaluz contemporaries, driving database searches for images of Andalusia in the contemporary blogosphere, compiling them into rhythmic and subtitled video clips, which are surveilled by telescopes, the details captured, retrieving similar images from Andalusian cyberspace. In short, it is scopic media that are surveilled, and pictures looking at pictures, for pictures to display over sculpted arrays of recycled and DIY screens. Web-cams sculpturally integrated as well mix portraits of installation guests with a mashed up overabundance of Andalusia&#x27;s scopic regime.

<text>The is a spiral shape evoking a newly unfurling frond from a silver fern frond. It is an integral symbol in Māori art, carving and tattooing, where it symbolises new life, growth, strength and peace.
Its shape &quot;conveys the idea of perpetual movement,&quot; while the inner coil &quot;suggests returning to the point of origin&quot;.

==Use in traditional design==
The &quot;koru&quot; is the integral motif of the symbolic and seemingly abstract &quot;kōwhaiwhai&quot; designs traditionally used to decorate &quot;wharenui&quot; (meeting houses). There are numerous semi-formal designs, representing different features of the natural world.

==More recent adaptations==
The logo of Air New Zealand, the national carrier, incorporates a &quot;koru&quot; design — based on the Ngaru (Ngāti Kahungunu) &quot;kōwhaiwhai&quot; pattern — as a symbol of New Zealand flora. The logo was introduced in 1973 to coincide with the arrival of the airline&#x27;s first McDonnell Douglas DC-10 wide-body jet. Several other nationwide organisations also use a koru in their logos, among them the New Zealand Department of Conservation.

In 1983, Friedensreich Hundertwasser based his proposed design for a secondary New Zealand flag on the symbol. It also formed the basis for a notable series of artworks by Gordon Walters. Koru swirls are also reminiscent of the Tomoe symbol in Japan.

The New Zealand national korfball team is nicknamed &quot;The Korus&quot;.

<text>Bryan Edgar Magee (; 12 April 1930 – 26 July 2019) was a British philosopher, broadcaster, politician and author, best known for bringing philosophy to a popular audience.

==Early life==
Born of working-class parents in Hoxton, London, in 1930, within a few hundred yards of where his paternal grandparents were born, Magee was brought up poor in a flat above the family clothing shop, where in his early years he shared a bed with his elder sister, Joan. He was close to his father but had a difficult relationship with his abusive and overbearing mother. He was evacuated to Market Harborough in Leicestershire, during World War II, but when he returned to London, much of Hoxton had been bombed flat. Magee was educated at Christ&#x27;s Hospital school on a London County Council scholarship. During this formative period, he developed a keen interest in socialist politics, while during the school holidays he enjoyed listening to political orators at Speakers&#x27; Corner, Hyde Park, London, as well as regular visits to the theatre and concerts.

During his National Service he served in the British Army, in the Intelligence Corps, seeking possible spies among the refugees crossing the border between Yugoslavia and Austria. After demobilisation he won a scholarship to Keble College, Oxford, where he studied history as an undergraduate and then Philosophy, Politics and Economics in one year. His friends at Oxford included Robin Day, William Rees-Mogg, Jeremy Thorpe and Michael Heseltine. While at university, Magee was elected president of the Oxford Union. He later became an honorary fellow at Keble College.

At Oxford, Magee had mixed with poets as well as politicians and in 1951 published a volume of verse through the Fortune Press. The publisher did not pay its writers and expected them to buy a certain number of copies themselves – a similar deal had been struck with such writers as Dylan Thomas and Philip Larkin for their first anthologies. The slim volume was dedicated to the memory of Richard Wagner, with a quote from Rilke&#x27;s &quot;Duino Elegies&quot;: (&quot;... beauty is nothing but the beginning of terror, that we are still able to bear&quot;). Magee said later: &quot;I&#x27;m rather ashamed of the poems now, although I have written poems since which I haven&#x27;t published, which I secretly think are rather good. It has always been a dimension of what I do.&quot; (Later he would also publish fiction, including a spy novel &quot;To Live in Danger&quot; in 1960 and then a long work &quot;Facing Death.&quot; The latter, initially composed in the 1960s but not published until 1977, would be shortlisted for an award by &quot;The Yorkshire Post&quot;).

In 1955 he began a year studying philosophy at Yale University on a postgraduate fellowship. He had expected to hate America but found that he loved it. His deep admiration of the country&#x27;s equality of opportunity was expressed in a swift series of books, &quot;Go West, Young Man&quot; (1958), &quot;The New Radicalism&quot; (1963) and &quot;The Democratic Revolution&quot; (1964). He taught philosophy at Balliol College, Oxford for a period but was not enamoured of the analytical philosophy then in vogue there.

== Politics ==
Magee returned to Britain with hopes of becoming a Labour Member of Parliament (MP). He twice stood unsuccessfully for Mid Bedfordshire, at the 1959 general election and the 1960 by-election, and instead took a job presenting the ITV current affairs television programme &quot;This Week&quot;. He made documentary programmes about subjects of social concern such as prostitution, sexually transmitted diseases, abortion and homosexuality (illegal in Britain at the time). Interviewed in 2003, Magee said: British society was illiberal in a number of areas that are now taken for granted... Roy Jenkins changed them and he was bitterly opposed by the Tories. But if you were liberal with a small L there was a menu of social change and I believed very strongly in that whole liberal agenda.

He was eventually elected MP for Leyton at the February 1974 general election. In &quot;Making the Most of It&quot;, Magee wrote that he decided that the Commons was not suitable for him when he was sitting next to Renee Short, as she constantly interrupted a Conservative to call him a &quot;twit&quot;. He resolved not to spend much time on Parliamentary debates, and preferred to make use of the Commons library for his own research and to act efficiently on correspondence from his constituents. He sometimes went out to the theatre on an evening and returned to Parliament in time to vote, having missed the debate. 

Magee was on the right of the Labour Party: he opposed nationalisation, nuclear disarmament and friendly relations with the Communist countries. He stated that he &quot;detested&quot; Harold Wilson as devoid of principle, and criticised Callaghan for not understanding the role of negotiations with trade unions. Early in Thatcher&#x27;s career, Magee had friendly relations with her and the two discussed Karl Popper&#x27;s philosophy, but he later described her as &quot;limited, narrow, even blinkered&quot;. As a member of the Labour Party&#x27;s Manifesto Group, which advocated unity of all Labour MPs behind the election manifesto, he wrote the pamphlet &quot;What We Must Do&quot;.

From 1981, Magee found himself out of tune with the Labour Party&#x27;s direction under Michael Foot, and he decided to leave after he could not bring himself to oppose the Thatcher Government&#x27;s agenda of curtailing the power of trade unions. On 22 January 1982 he resigned the Labour whip and in March joined the defection of centrist Labour MPs to the newly founded Social Democratic Party. He lost his seat at the 1983 general election.

When asked what he felt he had achieved as an MP, Magee named his work to clear the name of his constituent, David Copper, for the murder of a postmaster, which he believes the police had framed him for. He contributed to the 1980 book &quot;Wicked Beyond Belief&quot;, which was published three weeks before David Cooper was released from prison.

Magee returned to writing and broadcasting which, indeed, he had continued during his parliamentary career and would also serve on various boards and committees. He notably resigned as chairman of the Arts Council music panel in 1994 in protest at funding cuts.

He also returned to scholarship at Oxford, first as a fellow at Wolfson, then at New College. He was also, from 1984, a senior research fellow in the History of Ideas at King&#x27;s College London and, from 1994, a visiting professor. He also found more time to write classical music reviews and worked on his own compositions. He admitted that, while his own work was &quot;whistleable&quot;, it was also &quot;inherently sentimental&quot;.

Interviewed in 2003, Oxford contemporary Lord Rees-Mogg recalled &quot;we never knew which way Bryan would jump. And as his life later demonstrated, there was always a question of whether he was basically at heart an intellectual or someone interested in public life. So it wasn&#x27;t a surprise that he went into public life, but the intellectual was really the predominant element in his personality and the books seemed to represent the real Bryan more than the political activity did.&quot;

== Broadcaster and writer ==
=== Interviews with philosophers ===
Magee&#x27;s most important influence in popular culture were his efforts to make philosophy accessible to the layman.

In 1970–1971 he presented a series for BBC Radio 3 entitled &quot;Conversations with Philosophers&quot;. The series took the form of Magee in conversation with a number of contemporary British philosophers, discussing both their own work, and the work of earlier 20th-century British philosophers. The series began with an introductory conversation between Magee and Anthony Quinton. Other programmes included discussions on Bertrand Russell, G. E. Moore and J. L. Austin, Ludwig Wittgenstein, and the relationship between philosophy and religion, among others. Extracts of each of the conversations were printed in &quot;The Listener&quot; shortly after broadcast. And extensively revised versions of all the discussions would be made available in the 1971 book &quot;Modern British Philosophy&quot;. Karl Popper would appear in the series twice and Magee would soon after write an introductory book on his philosophy that was first published in 1973.

In 1978 Magee presented 15 dialogues with noted philosophers for BBC Television in a series called &quot;Men of Ideas&quot;. This was a series that, as noted in &quot;The Daily Telegraph,&quot; &quot;achieved the near-impossible feat of presenting to a mass audience recondite issues of philosophy without compromising intellectual integrity or losing ratings&quot; and &quot;attracted a steady one million viewers per show.&quot; Following an &quot;Introduction to Philosophy&quot;, presented by Magee in discussion with Isaiah Berlin, Magee discussed topics like Marxist philosophy, the Frankfurt School, the ideas of Noam Chomsky and modern Existentialism in subsequent episodes. During the broadcast run, edited shorter versions of the discussions were published weekly in &quot;The Listener&quot; magazine. Extensively revised versions of the dialogues within the &quot;Men of Ideas&quot; series (which featured Iris Murdoch) were originally published in a book of the same name that is now sold under the title of &quot;Talking Philosophy&quot;. DVDs of the series are sold to academic institutions with the title &quot;Contemporary Philosophy&quot;. Neither this series nor its 1987 &#x27;sequel&#x27; are available for purchase by home users but most of the episodes are freely available on Youtube.

Another BBC television series, &quot;The Great Philosophers&quot;, followed in 1987. In this series, Magee discussed the major historical figures of Western philosophy with fifteen contemporary philosophers. The series covered the philosophies of Plato, Aristotle, and Descartes, among others, including a discussion with Peter Singer on the philosophy of Marx and Hegel, and ending with a discussion with John Searle on the philosophy of Wittgenstein. Extensively revised versions of the dialogues were published in a book of the same name that was published that same year. Magee&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;The Story of Thought&quot; (also published as &quot;The Story of Philosophy&quot;) would also cover the history of Western philosophy.

Between the two series, Magee released the first edition of the work he regarded as closest to his &quot;academic magnum opus&quot;: &quot;The Philosophy of Schopenhauer&quot; (first published in 1983, substantially revised and extended, 1997). This remains one of the most substantial and wide-ranging treatments of the thinker and assesses in-depth Schopenhauer&#x27;s influence on Wittgenstein, Wagner and other creative writers. Magee also addresses Schopenhauer&#x27;s thoughts on homosexuality and the influence of Buddhism on his thought.

== Later work and interest in Wagner ==
In 1997 Magee&#x27;s &quot;Confessions of a Philosopher&quot; was published. This essentially offered an introduction to philosophy in autobiographical form. The book was involved in a libel lawsuit as a result of Magee repeating the rumour that Ralph Schoenman, a controversial associate of Bertrand Russell during the philosopher&#x27;s final decade, had been planted by the CIA in an effort to discredit Russell. Schoenman successfully sued Magee for libel in the UK, with the result that the first printing of the British edition of the book was pulped. A second defamation suit, filed in California against Random House, was settled in 2001. The allegations were expunged by settlement, and a new edition was issued and provided to more than 700 academic and public libraries. In &quot;Confessions of a Philosopher&quot;, Magee charts his own philosophical development in an autobiographical context. He also emphasizes the importance of Schopenhauer&#x27;s philosophy as a serious attempt to solve philosophical problems. In addition to this, he launches a critique of analytic philosophy, particularly in its linguistic form over three chapters, contesting its fundamental principles and lamenting its influence.

Magee had a particular interest in the life, thought and music of Richard Wagner and wrote two notable books on the composer and his world, &quot;Aspects of Wagner&quot; (1968; rev. 1988), and &quot;Wagner and Philosophy&quot; (2000). In &quot;Aspects of Wagner&quot; Magee &quot;outlines the range and depth of Wagner&#x27;s achievement, and shows how his sensational and erotic music expresses the repressed and highly charged contents of the psyche. He also examines Wagner&#x27;s detailed stage directions, and the prose works in which he formulated his ideas, and sheds interesting new light on his anti-semitism.&quot; The revised edition includes a fresh chapter on &quot;Wagner as Music&quot;.

In 2016, approaching his 86th birthday, Magee had his book &quot;Ultimate Questions&quot; published by Princeton University. Writing in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Julian Baggini said &quot;Magee doesn&#x27;t always match his clarity of expression with rigour of argument, sometimes ignoring his own principle that the feeling &#x27;Yes, surely this must be right&#x27; is &#x27;not a validation, not even a credential&#x27;. But this can be excused. Plato and Aristotle claimed that philosophy begins with wonder. Magee is proof that for some, the wonder never dies, it only deepens.&quot;

In 2018 Magee, then living in one room in a nursing home in Oxford, was interviewed by Jason Cowley of &quot;New Statesman&quot; and discussed his life and his 2016 book &quot;Ultimate Questions&quot;. Magee said that he believed he lacked originality and, until &quot;Ultimate Questions&quot;, had struggled to make an original contribution to philosophy, saying:
Popper had this originality, Russell had it, and Einstein had it in spades. Einstein created a way of seeing things which transformed the way we see the world and the way we even understand such fundamental things as time and space. And I fundamentally understand that I could never do that, never. I wish I was in that class – not because I want to be a clever chap but because I want to do things that are at a much better level than I&#x27;ve done them.
He went on to discuss his continuing interest in politics and current affairs and to describe the Brexit yes vote as a &quot;historic mistake&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1953, Magee was appointed to a teaching job in Sweden and while there met Ingrid Söderlund, a pharmacist in the university laboratory. They married the following year and had one daughter, Gunnela and, in time, three grandchildren. Magee later said: The marriage broke up pretty quickly and it was a fairly disastrous period of my life. I came back to Oxford as a postgraduate. But since then Sweden has been a part of my life. I go there every year and my daughter visits me. I always assumed that sooner or later I&#x27;d get married again but it never quite happened, although I had some very long relationships. And now I don&#x27;t want to get married again. I like the freedom.

His memoir, &quot;Clouds of Glory: A Hoxton Childhood&quot;, won The Ackerley Prize in 2004.

== Death ==
Magee died on 26 July 2019, at the age of 89, at St Luke&#x27;s Hospital in Headington, Oxford, the care home in which he had spent his final years. His funeral took place on 15 August.

The last of Magee&#x27;s books to be published during his lifetime – &quot;Making the Most of It&quot; (2018) – closes:

A celebration of his life was held in the chapel of Keble College, Oxford, on 29 October 2019. The event was opened by Sir Jonathan Phillips, Warden of Keble College, and was introduced by Magee&#x27;s executor, the academic, author and editor Henry Hardy. It included audio and video clips of Magee, music chosen by him and played by the Amherst Sextet, and addresses by David Owen and Simon Callow. The music choices were the sextet from Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Capriccio&quot;, the largo from Elgar&#x27;s &quot;Serenade for Strings&quot; and the prelude to Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;. The addresses by Owen and Callow were published together with a notice of Magee&#x27;s life by Hardy in the &quot;Oldie&quot;.

<text>Violet Crumble is an Australian chocolate bar. The bar is a crumbly honeycomb toffee centre coated in a layer of compound chocolate. It was first made by Hoadley&#x27;s Chocolates in South Melbourne around the year 1913; and is currently made in Adelaide, South Australia by Robern Menz after a period of ownership by Nestlé. Its advertising slogan is &quot;It&#x27;s the way it shatters that matters&quot;, and previously was &quot;Nothing else matters&quot;. The bar shares similarities to the Crunchie bar made by British firm Cadbury. Aside from Australia, it is available in Hawaii and a few other places, including Hong Kong, and Mollie Stone&#x27;s Markets and Cost Plus World Market in the United States.

== History ==

Abel Hoadley opened a jam factory in South Melbourne, in 1889, trading as A. Hoadley &amp; Company. By 1895, business had expanded rapidly and Hoadley built a five-storey premises, the Rising Sun Preserving Works. He produced jams, jellies, fruit preserves, candied peels, sauces, and confectionery and employed a workforce as large as 200. By 1901, there were four preserving factories and a large confectionery works. Hoadley had acquired the firm of Dillon, Burrows &amp; Co and extended his products to vinegar, cocoa, and chocolate. In 1910, the jam business was sold to Henry Jones Co-operative and in 1913, Hoadley&#x27;s Chocolates was formed.

The same year, Hoadley produced his first chocolate assortment and packed them in a purple box decorated with violets, in tribute to his wife&#x27;s favourite colour and flower. Within the box assortment was a piece of honeycomb that became so popular that Hoadley decided to produce an individual honeycomb bar.

This proved trickier than first thought because, as the pieces of honeycomb cooled, they absorbed moisture and started sticking together. This hygroscopic nature of honeycomb led Hoadley to eventually dip his bars in chocolate, to keep the honeycomb dry and crunchy, creating the Violet Crumble bar in 1913.

Hoadley wanted to call his new bar just Crumble, but as it was not possible to protect that name with a trademark he used his wife&#x27;s favourite flower and registered the name Violet Crumble. It had a purple wrapper with a small flower logo. It was an instant success. Violet Crumbles are crispier in texture than Crunchie bars, with a slightly more marshmallow taste.

Hoadley&#x27;s Chocolates was acquired by English company Rowntree&#x27;s in 1970, which produced Violet Crumble in Adelaide until 1985. Rowntree&#x27;s was acquired in 1988 by Nestlé, which moved production to the northern Melbourne suburb of Campbellfield.

On 11 January 2018, Robern Menz purchased the Violet Crumble brand and its associated intellectual property, plant and equipment for an undisclosed sum, and production restarted on 10 October 2018.

===Timeline===
*1913, Hoadley&#x27;s Chocolates made the first Violet Crumble bar in Melbourne.
*1972, Hoadley&#x27;s Chocolates was acquired by Rowntree&#x27;s and became known as Rowntree Hoadley Ltd.
*1989, Nestlé acquired Rowntree&#x27;s. The Rowntree chocolate brands were initially branded as Nestlé-Rowntree until Nestlé dropped &quot;Rowntree&quot;.
*2009, Nestlé changed the shape of the Violet Crumble to a wider, flatter bar. The honeycomb formulation was also changed to make it shatter into small pieces when bitten into.
*2010, Nestlé included the popular Violet Crumble “bags” product (not the bars) on their list of deleted products
*2012, an attempt at regaining name and recipe rights for the Violet Crumble was made by young entrepreneur Bryan Hoadley, a descendant of Abel Hoadley.
*2018, in January Robern Menz announced their plans to acquire the rights and equipment to take over production and commenced production in October.
*2019, in March bags of Violet Crumble went on sale, for the first time in nine years, in independent grocery stores such as IGA.
===Packaging===
The hygroscopic nature of the honeycomb centre was problematic. Competitors tried to prove the bars were not fresh by squeezing them. Hoadley responded by instituting a strict coding system to keep track of the shelf life (12 months) and ensure that deteriorated bars were not sold. He also searched worldwide for a new type of airtight wrapper that would keep the bar fresh. Eventually French company La Cellophane invented a moisture-resistant metallised cellophane especially for Violet Crumble.

==Production==
The honeycomb is produced and conveyed into an air-conditioned area where it is cut into bars, then goes through chocolate-coating machines. The bars are double-coated to seal the honeycomb from the air. Cooling tunnels take the bars to the automatic wrapping machines.

Bertie Beetle, a small chocolate bar sold at stores and shows around Australia, was introduced in 1963 to use up broken pieces of Violet Crumble.

<doc id="851089" wikidata="Q1540613" url="?curid=851089" title="Soyuz TM-17">
<text>Soyuz TM-17 was a Russian spaceflight to the space station Mir, launched on July 1, 1993. It carried Russian cosmonauts Vasily Tsibliyev and Aleksandr Serebrov, along with French astronaut Jean-Pierre Haigneré. It lasted 196 days and 17 hours, making more than 3,000 orbits of the planet Earth.

==Crew==
==Mission highlights==

Soyuz TM-17 was the 17th expedition to the Russian Space Station Mir.

At 7:37:11 a.m. Moscow time (MT), on 1994 January 14, Soyuz-TM 17 separated from the forward port of the Mir station. At 7:43:59 a.m., the Mission Control Center in Korolev (TsUP) ordered Tsibliyev to steer Soyuz-TM 17 to within 15 metres of the Kristall module to begin photography of the APAS-89 docking system. At 7:46:20 a.m., Tsibliyev complained that Soyuz-TM 17 was handling sluggishly. Serebrov, standing by for photography in the orbital module, then asked Tsibliyev to move the spacecraft out of the station plane because it was coming close to one of the solar arrays. In Mir, Viktor Afanasyev ordered Valeri Polyakov and Yuri Usachyov to evacuate to the Soyuz TM-18 spacecraft. At 7:47:30 a.m., controllers in the TsUP saw the image from Soyuz-TM 17&#x27;s external camera shake violently, and Serebrov reported that Soyuz-TM 17 had hit Mir. The TsUP then lost communications with Mir and Soyuz-TM 17. Intermittent communications were restored with Soyuz-TM 17 at 7:52 a.m. Voice communications with Mir were not restored until 8:02 a.m. Inspection of Soyuz-TM 17 indicated no serious damage. In this connection, the Russians revealed that they had studied contingency reentries by depressurized spacecraft in the wake of the Soyuz 11 accident. The Mir cosmonauts did not feel the impact, though the station&#x27;s guidance system registered angular velocity and switched to free flying mode.

Later analysis indicated that the right side of the orbital module had struck Mir two glancing blows 2 seconds apart. The impact point was on Kristall, near its connection to the Mir base block. The cause of the impact was traced to a switch error: the hand controller in the orbital module which governed braking and acceleration was switched on, disabling the equivalent hand controller (the left motion control lever) in the descent module. Tsibliyev was able to use the right lever to steer the Soyuz past Mir&#x27;s solar arrays, antennas, and docking ports after it became clear impact was inevitable.

<doc id="851091" wikidata="Q700569" url="?curid=851091" title="Sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse">
<text>The sinking of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; was a naval engagement in World War II, as part of the war in the Pacific, that took place on 10 December 1941 in the South China Sea off the east coast of the British colonies of Malaya (present-day Malaysia) and the Straits Settlements (present-day Singapore and its coastal towns), east of Kuantan, Pahang. The Royal Navy battleship and battlecruiser were sunk by land-based bombers and torpedo bombers of the Imperial Japanese Navy. In Japan, the engagement was referred to as the .

The objective of Force Z, which consisted of one battleship, one battlecruiser and four destroyers, was to intercept the Japanese invasion fleet in the South China Sea north of Malaya. The task force sailed without air support. Although the British had a close encounter with Japanese heavy surface units, the force failed to find and destroy the main convoy. On their return to Singapore they were attacked in open waters and sunk by long-range torpedo bombers. The commander of Force Z, Admiral Sir Tom Phillips, elected to maintain radio silence and an alert was not sent (by the &quot;Repulse&quot;) until one hour after the first Japanese attack.

With the attack on Pearl Harbor only two days earlier, on the other side of the International Date Line, the Malayan engagement illustrated the effectiveness of aerial attacks against even the heaviest of naval assets if they were without air cover. This added to the importance for the Allies of the three United States Navy aircraft carriers in the Pacific: , , and . The sinking of the two ships severely weakened the British Eastern Fleet in Singapore, and the Japanese fleet was engaged only by submarines until the Battle off Endau on 27 January 1942. Singapore itself fell to the Japanese on 15 February, leading to the largest surrender in British history.

==Background==
In meetings on 17 and 20 October, the British Defence Committee formally discussed Far East naval reinforcement in response to the fall of the moderate Konoe government on 16 October. In agreement with August–September assessment of Japanese intentions, Winston Churchill and his cabinet favoured the deployment of a modern battleship for deterrent effect. The Royal Navy, as part of its offensive strategy, planned to send the and s to Singapore, but the &quot;Nelson&quot;s could not deploy. was damaged in the Mediterranean Sea in late-September. Crew leave prevented from deploying until mid-December, and a gun refit scheduled from February to May 1942 was required before she could conduct further operations. With working up, the earliest either could reach the Far East was August 1942. The was, aside from the &quot;Revenge&quot;s, the only worked-up battleship that could sail east before Spring 1942. On 20 October, the Committee decided to send &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; to Cape Town, South Africa. Once at Cape Town, a review would decide whether to send the ship onward to Singapore; this would keep &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; available to respond to an emergency in home waters.

In December 1941, as a deterrent to Japanese territorial expansion which was recently demonstrated by the invasion of French Indochina, it was proposed that a force of Royal Navy warships be dispatched to the Far East with a view to providing reinforcement for Britain&#x27;s possessions there, most notably Singapore. First Sea Lord Sir Dudley Pound represented that Singapore could be adequately defended only if the Royal Navy sent the majority of its capital ships there, to achieve parity with an estimated force of nine Japanese battleships. However, dispatching such a large British force was impractical as the British were at war with Nazi Germany and Fascist Italy much closer to home. Nevertheless, Churchill appeared optimistic about the improving situation in the North Atlantic and Mediterranean; he advocated sending two capital ships along with an aircraft carrier to defend Malaya, Borneo and the Straits Settlements.

Churchill has been criticised for showing &quot;considerable ignorance&quot; and holding an &quot;exaggerated belief in the power of the battleship,&quot; along with &quot;a tendency to interfere in naval matters.&quot; This may have led him to propose a squadron of three modern ships: one battleship, one battlecruiser, and one carrier. His view was that using the Ultra decrypts that would give Japanese ship locations to the British, they could then use their own ships to form a &quot;fleet in being&quot; to deter Japanese action, as the , sister to the lost , was in the North Sea. However, there was no firm plan for such a task. The revised British proposal allocated the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, the veteran , and the for air cover, though the plan had to be revised when &quot;Indomitable&quot; ran aground in the Caribbean Sea.

The dispatch of capital ships to Singapore had been part of the Admiralty&#x27;s strategic planning since the naval base had been expanded and fortified beginning in the early 1920s. The scale of this planned deployment had been reduced during the 1930s, since Germany and Italy presented new threats to British interests in the Atlantic and Mediterranean. Nevertheless, it was still assumed that a significant force of capital ships would deter Japanese expansion. Churchill&#x27;s plan presumed that the United States would agree to send its Pacific Fleet, including eight battleships, to Singapore in the event of hostilities with Japan, or that the British force would add to the deterrent value of the US fleet, should it stay at Pearl Harbor. Admiral of the Home Fleet Sir John Tovey was opposed to sending any of the new &quot;King George V&quot; battleships as he believed that they were not suited to operating in tropical waters. Indeed the humid climate of Malaya would negatively affect the capabilities of the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, such as the breakdown of her surface search radars, deterioration of her anti-aircraft ammunition, and increased crew fatigue due to the lack of air conditioning.

===Deployment===
Force G, consisting of the modern battleship &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, the First World War era battlecruiser &quot;Repulse&quot;, and the four destroyers HMS , , and , arrived at Singapore on 2 December 1941. They were then re-designated Force Z.

The new aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Indomitable&quot; was allocated to Force G, but whilst working up off Jamaica, she had run aground in the entrance to Kingston harbour on 3 November 1941. &quot;Indomitable&quot; required 12 days of dry dock repairs in Norfolk, Virginia, and was not able to take part in the action. &quot;Indomitable&quot; carried one squadron each of Fairey Fulmars and Hawker Sea Hurricanes. Another aircraft carrier, (which was with &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; at Cape Town), was on passage to Singapore to join Force Z, but was not deployed due to lack of speed.

On 1 December, it was announced that Sir Tom Phillips had been promoted to full admiral and appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Eastern Fleet. A few days later, &quot;Repulse&quot; left for Australia with and , but the force was recalled to Singapore to assemble for possible operations against the Japanese.

Also at Singapore were the light cruisers HMS , , and , and the destroyers , &quot;Encounter&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot;. The heavy cruiser , Dutch light cruiser , two more British destroyers ( and ), and four United States Navy destroyers (, , and ) would be there within three days.

Although &quot;Durban&quot; and &quot;Stronghold&quot; were available, Admiral Phillips decided to leave them at Singapore because they were not as fast as the other units. Additionally, &quot;Danae&quot;, &quot;Dragon&quot;, &quot;Mauritius&quot;, &quot;Encounter&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot; were also at Singapore, but were under repair and not ready to sail.

===Japanese preparations===
Churchill publicly announced &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; were being sent to Singapore to deter the Japanese. In response, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto sent 36 Mitsubishi G4M bombers to reinforce the existing Mitsubishi G3M-equipped Kanoya Air Group and Genzan Air Group, whose pilots began training for an attack on the two capital ships. The bomber crews, of the Kanoya Air Group of Kanoya Kōkūtai (751 Ku), Genzan Air Group of Genzan Kōkūtai (753 Ku), and the Mihoro Air Group of Mihoro Kōkūtai (701 Ku), trained in torpedo attacks at an altitude of less than 10 metres (30 ft), and in long-range over-ocean navigation, so they could attack naval targets moving quickly at sea. Genzan Air Group was commanded by Lt Cdr Niichi Nakanishi, Kanoya Air Group by Lt Cdr Shichizo Miyauchi and Mihoro Air Group by Lt Hachiro Shoji. This was the first time in the war that a force of bombers was especially trained and equipped for “ship killing”, an unprecedented capacity, as around that time ordinary land-based bombers (particularly the Mediterranean theatre) had attacked ships at sea with limited success.

==Hostilities commence==
On 8 December 1941, early in the morning, bombers of Mihoro Air Group attacked Singapore. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; responded with anti-aircraft fire; no planes were shot down, and the ships sustained no damage. The Japanese made landings on Kota Bharu, Malaya, on 8 December (local time), commencing the Japanese invasion of Malaya.

News arrived that Pearl Harbor had been attacked and eight US battleships had been sunk or disabled. Pre-war planning had explored the possibility of the United States Pacific Fleet sending major units to Singapore to reinforce the British when war broke out. That was now impossible. Phillips had concluded in an earlier discussion with US General Douglas MacArthur and Admiral Thomas C. Hart that his two capital ships were insufficient to confront the Japanese. However, with the Japanese threatening to overrun Malaya, Phillips was pressed to use his ships in an offensive role; he assembled his flotilla to try to intercept and destroy Japanese invasion convoys in the South China Sea.

Phillips did not believe that the RAF and other Allied air forces could guarantee air cover for his ships, as they had only limited numbers of fighters. Phillips had requested fighter protection before he left and was told it was not possible. However the reply to his request did not make it clear that the reply only applied to the morning of the 10th off Sigora, and he may have had the mistaken impression that fighter protection would not be available generally. And two proposals to provide daylight fighter cover had previously been turned down by Phillips and his staff. See Force Z#Air Cover.

One squadron, No. 453 Squadron RAAF with 10 Brewster F2A Buffalos at RAF Sembawang, had been designated &quot;Fleet Defence Squadron&quot;, to provide close cover for Force Z. The squadron&#x27;s acting CO, Flight Lieutenant Tim Vigors, had been advised of the radio procedures that would be used by Force Z.

Despite his misgivings about the air cover available, Phillips elected to proceed. It is believed that four factors entered into his decision: he thought that Japanese planes could not operate so far from land, he believed that his ships were relatively immune from fatal damage via air attack, he was unaware of the quality of Japanese aircraft and torpedoes, and like many Royal Navy officers, Phillips underestimated the fighting abilities of the Japanese. Up to that point, no capital ship at sea had been sunk by air attack. The Italian heavy cruiser &quot;Pola&quot; had been disabled by a torpedo from a Fleet Air Arm Fairey Swordfish at the Battle of Cape Matapan on 29 March 1941, and was later sunk by a torpedo from the destroyer . These and other Royal Navy operations in the Mediterranean theater (September 1939 – December 1941) showed that it was risky but possible to operate in waters covered by enemy land-based air, as German and Italian aircraft damaged but could not stop Malta convoys, while no British battleships had been lost. Phillips grossly underestimated the scale of attack, and believed that the majority of enemy attack aircraft would be level bombers rather than land-based naval torpedo bombers. However the Japanese bombers that were slated to attack his ships were specially trained and equipped for &quot;ship killing&quot;, which the British did not realize due to intelligence failures.

His flagship, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, had one of the most advanced naval anti-aircraft systems of the time, the High Angle Control System (HACS), which demonstrated accurate long-range radar-directed anti-aircraft fire during Operation Halberd in August and September 1941. However, the extreme heat and humidity in Malayan waters rendered her anti-aircraft fire control radars unserviceable and her 2 pounder ammunition had deteriorated as well. Royal Air Force technicians were called in to examine the &quot;Prince&quot;″s radars but needed a week to effect repairs, and Force Z would be underway in a few days.

No. 453 Squadron RAAF, which was to provide air cover for Force Z, was not kept informed of the ships&#x27; position. No radio request for air cover was sent until one was sent by the commander of &quot;Repulse&quot; an hour after the Japanese attack began. Flight Lieutenant Vigors proposed a plan to keep six aircraft over Force Z during daylight, but this was declined by Phillips. After the war, Vigors remained bitter towards Phillips for his failure to call for air support on time. He later commented, &quot;I reckon this must have been the last battle in which the Navy reckoned they could get along without the RAF. A pretty damned costly way of learning. Phillips had known that he was being shadowed the night before, and also at dawn that day. He did not call for air support. He was attacked and still did not call for help.&quot; Daytime air cover off the coast was also offered by Wing Commander Wilfred Clouston of No. 488 Squadron RNZAF, but his plan, &quot;Get Mobile&quot;, was also rejected. 

Regarding Phillips&#x27; decision to proceed without air cover, naval historian Samuel Eliot Morison wrote:
Those who make the decisions in war are constantly weighing certain risks against possible gains. At the outset of hostilities [US] Admiral Hart thought of sending his small striking force north of Luzon to challenge Japanese communications, but decided that the risk to his ships outweighed the possible gain because the enemy had won control of the air. Admiral Phillips had precisely the same problem in Malaya. Should he steam into the Gulf of Siam and expose his ships to air attack from Indochina in the hope of breaking enemy communications with their landing force? He decided to take the chance. With the Royal Air Force and the British Army fighting for their lives, the Royal Navy could not be true to its tradition by remaining idly at anchor.

===Departure===

After receiving word of a Japanese convoy bound for Malaya, Force Z, consisting of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, &quot;Repulse&quot;, &quot;Electra&quot;, &quot;Express&quot;, &quot;Vampire&quot; and &quot;Tenedos&quot;, sailed from Singapore at 17:10 on 8 December. Phillips hoped to attack off Singora on 10 December; had he departed one day sooner, he might have achieved his objective without coming under air attack at all, for the Japanese squadrons had not yet arrived.

At 07:13 on 9 December, Force Z passed the Anambas Islands to the east, and turned to a new course of 330 degrees, later changing to 345 degrees. Force Z was overflown by two Japanese reconnaissance aircraft, but not reported, before being spotted by Japanese submarine &quot;I-65&quot; at 14:00 on 9 December, which shadowed the British ships for five hours, radioing their positions. Phillips was unaware he was being tracked. After this contact report, Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa, in command of the invasion force, ordered most of his warships to escort the empty transports back to Cam Ranh Bay in southern Vietnam.

&quot;I-65&quot;″s amplifying report, confirming the presence of British battleships, reached 22nd Air Flotilla headquarters two hours later. At that time, their aircraft were in the process of loading bombs for an attack on Singapore Harbour, but they immediately switched to torpedoes. The bombers were not ready until 18:00. The report also prompted the Japanese 2nd Fleet, Southern (Malay) Force&#x27;s Main Body, to sortie south from Indochina to intercept Force Z. The fleet consisted of the battleships , , three s and eight destroyers. They were joined by four s of Cruiser Division 7 and one light cruiser, four destroyers of Destroyer Squadron 3. The cruiser , flagship of Vice Admiral Ozawa, was also ordered south to find Force Z.

About 17:30, just a half-hour before sunset, Force Z was spotted by three Aichi E13A seaplanes, which had been catapulted off the Japanese cruisers , and , which were escorting the transports. These aircraft continued shadowing. At about 18:30, &quot;Tenedos&quot; was detached to return to Singapore, because she was running low on fuel, with instructions to contact Rear Admiral Arthur Palliser, detailed to act as liaison to RAF in Malaya, Phillips&#x27; intention was no longer to attack Singora, although Phillips changed course at 19:00 toward Singora, to deceive the shadowing aircraft, then south toward Singapore at 20:15, when darkness covered him. &quot;Tenedos&quot; dutifully reported at 20:00, thereby preserving the secrecy of Phillips&#x27; position.

A night air attack was attempted by the Japanese because they feared that the British would find the convoy, but bad weather prevented them from finding the ships and they returned to their airfields at Thủ Dầu Một and Saigon about midnight.

===Return to Singapore===
That night, one of the Japanese seaplanes dropped a flare over the Japanese heavy cruiser &quot;Chōkai&quot;, having mistaken her for &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. After this, the Japanese force of six cruisers and several destroyers turned away to the northeast. The flare was also seen by the British force, which feared they had been identified and then turned away to the southeast. At this point, the forces were approximately 5 miles (9 km) apart but did not sight each other, and the Japanese force was not picked up on the radar of the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. At 20:55, Phillips cancelled the operation, saying that they had lost the element of surprise, and ordered the force to return to Singapore.

On the way back, they were spotted and reported by the Japanese submarine &quot;I-58&quot; at 03:40. &quot;I-58&quot; reported that she had fired five torpedoes and missed, and then lost sight of the force three hours later. The British force did not see the torpedoes, and never knew they had been attacked. The report from &quot;I-58&quot; reached 22nd Air Flotilla Headquarters at 03:15, and ten bombers of the Genzan Air Group were dispatched at 06:00 to conduct a sector search for the ships. Many more planes, some armed with bombs and some with torpedoes, soon followed. The Genzan Air Group took off at 07:55, the Kanoya Air Group at 08:14, and the Mihoro Air Group at 08:20. They were ordered to proceed to the best-estimated position of the ships.

===The Japanese air attack===

At 00:50 that same morning, 10 December, Phillips had received a report from Palliser of Japanese landings at Kuantan, on the east coast of Malaya, halfway between Singapore and Kota Bharu; Phillips headed in that general direction, without however signalling Palliser his intentions (which would have revealed his position). Palliser failed to anticipate this and request air cover over Kuantan from Sembawang&#x27;s Buffalo fighters. As it turned out, not until a radio message was sent by &quot;Repulse&quot; an hour after the first Japanese attack were RAF aircraft dispatched. At 05:15, objects were spotted on the horizon; thinking they were the invasion force, Force Z turned towards them. It turned out to be a trawler towing barges. At 06:30, &quot;Repulse&quot; reported seeing an aircraft shadowing the ships. At 07:18, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; catapulted off a Supermarine Walrus reconnaissance aircraft; it flew to Kuantan, saw nothing, reported back to &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, and flew to Singapore.

&quot;Express&quot; was sent to investigate the area, but found nothing. Phillips was unaware that a large force of Japanese land-based bombers were looking for his ships, but, not having anticipated his detour to Kuantan, were searching much farther south. At around 10:00 &quot;Tenedos&quot;, having been detached from the main force the previous day and now about southeast of Force Z, began signalling she was being attacked by Japanese aircraft. The attack was carried out by nine Mitsubishi G3M &#x27;Nell&#x27; twin-engine medium bombers from the Genzan Air Corps, 22nd Air Flotilla, based at Saigon, each armed with one 500 kg (1,100 lb) armour-piercing bomb. They mistook the destroyer for a battleship and wasted their ordnance without scoring a hit. At 10:15, a scout plane to the north of most of the Japanese aircraft piloted by Ensign Masato Hoashi spotted Force Z and sent out a message detailing their exact position.

The remaining Japanese planes converged upon the retreating British task force. The planes had spread out to search for the British warships, so they arrived over the target in small groups. With fuel running short, the Japanese attacked as they arrived rather than forming into a large force for a co-ordinated strike. The first wave of Japanese planes, comprising eight Nell bombers from the Mihoro Air Corps, attacked at 11:13, concentrating solely on &quot;Repulse&quot;. Besides seven near misses by 250 kg (550 lb) bombs, they scored just one hit, which penetrated the hangar and the upper deck and exploded in the marine mess area. The bomb caused no serious damage and relatively few casualties, and &quot;Repulse&quot; continued on at 25 kts (46 km/h, 29 mph), still in fighting trim. Five of the eight bombers were damaged by anti-aircraft fire, and two were forced to return to base.

At around 11:40, 17 Nell torpedo bombers (two squadrons from the Genzan Air Group) approached the two capital ships. Eight concentrated on &quot;Repulse&quot;, while nine attacked &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, sending eight torpedoes speeding towards the flagship (one plane aborted its run on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and peeled off and attacked &quot;Repulse&quot;). One Nell was shot down and three more were damaged by the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; anti-aircraft fire during this attack. This first wave of torpedo attackers made no hits on &quot;Repulse&quot; but managed one ultimately fatal hit on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, right where her outer port propeller shaft exited the hull (some historical accounts state there were two hits in this attack, but an extensive 2007 survey of the hull of the wreck by divers proved there was only one). Turning at maximum revolutions, the shaft twisted and ruptured the glands that prevented sea water entering the ship via the broad shaft tunnel&#x27;s interior bulkheads. The flagship promptly took in 2,400 tons of water and her speed dropped to 16 kts (30 km/h, 18 mph).

Lt Takai of the 2nd Chutai which attacked the Repulse (with G3Ms) said that &quot;All crew members searched the sky vigilantly for the enemy fighters which we expected would be diving in to attack us at any moment. Much to our surprise, not a single enemy plane was in sight. This was all the more amazing since the scene of battle was well; within the fighting range of the British fighters.&quot; 

Testimony from Lt Wildish, in command of &#x27;B&#x27; Engine Room, indicated the shaft was stopped but upon restarting the shaft, water rushed in through the damaged shaft passage, flooding B Engine Room and forcing its evacuation. Also flooded from this hit were the long shaft passage itself, &#x27;Y&#x27; Action Machinery Room, the port Diesel Dynamo Room, &#x27;Y&#x27; Boiler Room, the Central Auxiliary Machinery Room, and a number of other compartments aft.
The torpedo hit had devastating further effects. First, it caused an 11.5-degree list to port, resulting in the starboard 5.25-inch anti-aircraft turrets being unable to depress far enough to engage low-level attackers. Furthermore, power to &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″ aft 5.25 inch dual-purpose turrets was cut, leaving her unable to effectively counter further attacks. Power loss to her pumps meant an inability to pump out the in-rushing flood water faster than it was entering the breached hull. The torpedo damage also denied her much of her auxiliary electrical power, vital for internal communications, ventilation, steering gear, and pumps, and for training and elevation of the 5.25-inch and 2-pounder gun mounts. All but S1 and S2 5.25 inch turrets were almost unmanageable, a factor compounded by the list, rendering their crews unable even to drag them around manually using chains. The crews also had difficulty bringing the heavy 2-pounder mountings into manual operation. The extensive internal flooding and shaft damage caused the shutting down of the inboard port propeller shaft, leaving the ship under the power of only the starboard engines and able to make just 15 knots at best. With her electric steering unresponsive, the ship was virtually unmanageable.
Another torpedo attack was carried out by 26 Betty bombers of the Kanoya Air Group at approximately 12:20, and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was hit by another three torpedoes on her starboard side (some historical accounts state four hits, but the 2007 survey of the hull showed there had been only three); one at the very bow, one opposite B main gun turret, and one abaft Y turret which not only punctured the hull but bent the outer starboard propeller shaft inboard and over the inner shaft, stopping it instantly.

At the same time as this last torpedo attack commenced against &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, planes from the Kanoya Air Group also attacked &quot;Repulse&quot; from both starboard and port. &quot;Repulse&quot;, which had dodged 19 torpedoes so far, was caught in a &#x27;hammer and anvil&#x27; attack (or pincer attack) and was hit on the port side by one torpedo. Within minutes, further attacks resulted in at least three more torpedoes striking &quot;Repulse&quot;. She had been hit seriously and Captain William Tennant soon ordered the crew overboard; &quot;Repulse&quot; listed heavily to port over a period of about six minutes and finally rolled over and sank stern first at 12:33 with heavy casualties.

&quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was now under power by only one propeller shaft, but was still able to fire at a high-level bombing attack which commenced at 12:41, although only with S1 and S2 5.25 inch turrets. Although most of the bombs straddled her, one bomb penetrated her deck amidships. This bomb penetrated the upper deck and exploded amongst the wounded gathered in the Cinema Flat beneath, causing extensive casualties. Soon &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; started to capsize to port (even though she had taken more torpedo hits to starboard) and HMS &quot;Express&quot; came alongside to take off the wounded and non-fighting crew. The order to abandon ship was then given and soon after &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; rolled over to port, floated for a brief moment upside down, and then sank stern first at 13:18. As she rolled over, she scraped &quot;Express&quot;, lying close alongside taking off survivors, with her bilge keel, and very nearly took the destroyer down with her. The rumbling sound of the attacks was heard in Singapore.
The Japanese had achieved eight torpedo hits, four each on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot;, out of 49 torpedoes, while losing only three aircraft during the attack itself (one Nell torpedo bomber from the Genzan Air Group and two Betty torpedo bombers from the Kanoya Air Group) and a fourth plane was so badly damaged that it crashed on landing. The 2007 survey of the two wrecks confirmed that there were four torpedo hits on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;; and could confirm only two hits on &quot;Repulse&quot;, as the amidships area where the other two hits were reported was buried beneath the seabed.

The air cover assigned to Force Z, ten Buffalo fighters of No. 453 Squadron RAAF, arrived over the battle area at 13:18, just as &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; sank. They encountered a scouting aircraft piloted by Ensign Masato Hoashi, who had discovered Force Z earlier, but it managed to escape the Buffalos and returned to confirm the sinkings. Had it been shot down, the Japanese might have assumed that the two ships had survived the attack, and struck again.

===After the action===
The destroyers &quot;Electra&quot; and &quot;Vampire&quot; moved in to rescue survivors of &quot;Repulse&quot;, while &quot;Express&quot; rescued those from the &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;. 840 sailors were lost: 513 in &quot;Repulse&quot; and 327 in &quot;Prince Of Wales&quot;. After they were rescued, some survivors of the &quot;Repulse&quot; manned action stations to free &quot;Electra&quot; sailors to rescue more survivors. In particular, &quot;Repulse&quot; gunners manned &#x27;X&#x27; and &#x27;Y&#x27; 4.7-inch (120 mm) mounts, and &quot;Repulse&quot;&#x27;s dentist assisted &quot;Electra&quot;&#x27;s medical teams with the wounded. In total nearly 1,000 survivors of &quot;Repulse&quot; were rescued, 571 by &quot;Electra&quot;. &quot;Vampire&quot; picked up nine officers, 213 ratings, and one civilian war correspondent from &quot;Repulse&quot;, and two sailors from &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;.

Of the high-ranking officers on &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;, Admiral Phillips and Captain John Leach chose to go down with their ship, and the senior survivors were Lt Cdr A. G. Skipwith, the ship&#x27;s First Lieutenant, and Cdr. (E) L. J Goudy, the chief engineer, who were rescued by &quot;Express&quot;. Captain Tennant of &quot;Repulse&quot; was rescued by &quot;Vampire&quot;. On returning to Singapore the rescued Captain Tennant was greeted by an equally-distressed Air Vice-Marshal Pulford, who exclaimed &quot;My God, I hope you don’t blame me for this. I had no idea where you were&quot;. 

According to the &quot;London Gazette&quot; report by Vigors:
On the way back to Singapore with the survivors, &quot;Express&quot; passed &quot;Stronghold&quot; and the four American destroyers heading north. &quot;Express&quot; signalled the action was over, but the ships proceeded to search the area for more survivors. None were found. While returning to Singapore from this search, &quot;Edsall&quot; boarded the fishing trawler sighted by Force Z that morning. The trawler was identified as the Japanese vessel &quot;Kofuku Maru&quot;, and was taken to Singapore, where the Japanese crew was interned.

While the Japanese bombers were returning to their airfields in French Indochina, a second wave was being prepared for another attack on Force Z. They had not been given accurate information on the progress of the battle. The attack was called off as soon as they received confirmed reports of the sinkings from Ensign Hoashi. The next day, Lt Haruki Iki flew to the site of the battle, dropping two wreaths of flowers into the sea to honour combatants from both sides who had died in the battle. One was for the fellow members of his Kanoya Air Group, while the other was for the British sailors whose display of bravery in defence of the ships had gained them the utmost admiration from all pilots in his squadron.

==Effects of the sinking==

The morning after the battle, Churchill received a phone call at his bedside from Sir Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord.
Churchill delivered news of the sinking to the House of Commons before noon on 11 December, which was followed by a full review of the situation in Malaya the next day. Singapore had essentially been reduced to a land base after both capital ships were lost, being turned into a land fortress, something it was never intended to be, rather than a base from which to project naval power. The Eastern Fleet spent the remainder of the invasion withdrawing their vessels to Ceylon and the Dutch East Indies. They were not reinforced by battleships until March 1942, with the arrival of and four &quot;Revenge&quot; class battleships. Although all five battleships survived the Indian Ocean raid, their service in the Pacific was uneventful and they were later withdrawn to East Africa and the Mediterranean.

The &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; were the first capital ships actively defending themselves to be sunk solely by air power while steaming in the open sea. Both of them were relatively fast ships compared to the slower US battleships that were caught at anchor at Pearl Harbor. Furthermore, &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; was a new battleship with passive and active anti-aircraft defences against contemporary aircraft, being equipped with the advanced HACS, although it was largely inoperable during the battle.

Combined with the earlier raid on Pearl Harbor, this left the Allies with only three operational capital ships in the Pacific Theatre: the three aircraft carriers , and . However, these events did prompt the Allies and the US Navy in particular to realise the potency of aircraft, and their carriers were instrumental in the counterattack.

The sinking of the &quot;Prince Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; caused a massive loss of morale that would end up causing unrest in the British colonies in Asia, resulting in mutinies such as the Cocos Island mutiny, which was done by the local Sri Lankan garrison of the island, but it was ultimately stopped and its leaders were executed for mutiny, making them the only Commonwealth soldiers to be executed for mutiny during the war.

==The ships today== 
The Japanese considered salvaging the ships or at least their radar equipment. In the first week of March 1942, a salvage team located the &quot;Repulse&quot; with little difficulty. Some AA guns and shells were brought up, but the team was called away on more urgent business before any attempt could be made to lift her. 

The wrecks of the two ships were found after the war, &quot;Repulse&quot; in 183 feet (56 m) of water, and &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; in 223 feet (68 m). Both are in a nearly upside-down position. Buoys were attached to the propeller shafts, and flags of the Royal Navy are attached to the lines and are regularly changed by divers. These Royal Navy wrecks are Crown property. &quot;Prince of Wales&quot;″ bell was removed from the wreck in 2002 by an authorised team of Royal Navy and British civilian divers in response to fears it would be stolen by unauthorised divers. The bell is now on display at the Merseyside Maritime Museum in Liverpool. It is a tradition for every passing Royal Navy ship to perform a remembrance service over the site of the wrecks.

In May 2007, a survey of the exterior hull of &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; was conducted. The expedition&#x27;s findings sparked considerable interest among naval architects and marine engineers around the world, because they detailed the nature of the damage to &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and the location and number of torpedo hits for the first time. The findings contained in the initial expedition report and later supplementary reports were analysed by the SNAME (Society of Naval Architects and Marine Engineers) Marine Forensics Committee and a resultant paper was drawn up entitled &quot;Death of a Battleship: A Reanalysis of the Tragic Loss of HMS &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; This paper was subsequently presented at a meeting of RINA (Royal Institution of Naval Architects) and IMarEST (Institute of Marine Engineering, Science &amp; Technology) members in London by William Garzke.

In October 2014, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; and &quot;Repulse&quot; were being &quot;extensively damaged&quot; with explosives by scrap-metal dealers.

==Memorial==

A memorial was dedicated on 10 December 2011 at The National Memorial Arboretum, the UK&#x27;s national site of remembrance at Alrewas, near Lichfield, Staffordshire. The memorial was dedicated in the presence of the few surviving former crew members of the ships.

<doc id="851109" wikidata="Q1037711" url="?curid=851109" title="Carl Akeley">
<text>Carl Ethan Akeley (May 19, 1864 – November 17, 1926) was a pioneering American taxidermist, sculptor, biologist, conservationist, inventor, and nature photographer, noted for his contributions to American museums, most notably to the Milwaukee Public Museum, Field Museum of Natural History and the American Museum of Natural History. He is considered the father of modern taxidermy. He was the founder of the AMNH Exhibitions Lab, the interdisciplinary department that fuses scientific research with immersive design.

==Career==

Akeley was born to Daniel Webster Akeley and Julia Glidden in Clarendon, New York, and grew up on a farm, attending school for only three years. He learned taxidermy from David Bruce in Brockport, New York, and then entered an apprenticeship in taxidermy at Ward&#x27;s Natural Science Establishment in Rochester, New York. While at Ward&#x27;s Akeley also helped mount P.T. Barnum&#x27;s Jumbo after the latter was killed in a railroad accident.

In 1886 Akeley moved on to the Milwaukee Public Museum (MPM) in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Akeley remained in Milwaukee for six years, refining &quot;model&quot; techniques used in taxidermy. At the Milwaukee Public Museum, his early work consisted of animals found in Wisconsin prairies and woodlands. One of these was a diorama of a muskrat group, which is sometimes referred to as the first museum diorama; however, such dioramas, and dioramas depicting &quot;habitat groups,&quot; dated back well into the early 1800s, and were quite popular with taxidermists in Victorian England. He also created historical reindeer and orangutan exhibits. 

Akeley left the Milwaukee Public Museum in 1892 and set up a private studio from which he continued to do contract work, including three mustangs for the Smithsonian Institution for exhibition at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. In 1896, he joined the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, where he developed his innovative taxidermy techniques, notably the creation of lightweight, hollow, but sturdy mannequins on which to mount the animals&#x27; skins. His techniques, which involved sculpting the realistic musculature of the animals in active poses before mounting the skin, were also notable for their life-like representation. Akeley was the Field Museum&#x27;s chief taxidermist from 1896-1909 and prepared more than 130 mounted specimens and dioramas. His most famous creations include the &quot;Fighting African Elephants&quot; in the central hall of the Field Museum, killed by Akeley and his wife Delia Akeley before being brought to Chicago for mounting and first put on display in 1909.

He was also a prolific inventor, perfecting a &quot;cement gun&quot; to repair the crumbling facade of the Field Columbian Museum in Chicago (the old Palace of Fine Arts from the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition. He is today known as the inventor of shotcrete, or &quot;gunite&quot; as he termed it at the time. Akeley did not use sprayable concrete in his taxidermy work, as is sometimes suggested. Akeley also invented a highly mobile motion picture camera for capturing wildlife, started a company to manufacture it, and patented it in 1915. The Akeley &quot;pancake&quot; camera (so-called because it was round) was soon adopted by the War Department for use in World War I, primarily for aerial use, and later by newsreel companies, and Hollywood studios, primarily for aerial footage and action scenes. F. Trubee Davison covered these and other Akeley inventions in a special issue of &quot;Natural History&quot; magazine. Akeley also wrote several books, including stories for children, and an autobiography &quot;In Brightest Africa&quot; (1920). He was awarded more than 30 patents for his inventions.

Akeley specialized in African mammals, particularly the gorilla and the elephant. As a taxidermist, he improved on techniques of fitting the skin over a carefully prepared and sculpted form of the animal&#x27;s body, producing very lifelike specimens, with consideration of musculature, wrinkles, and veins. He also displayed the specimens in groups in a natural setting. Many animals that he preserved he had personally collected.

== The Akeley Method ==
First and foremost, Akeley believed and was obsessively committed to the idea that taxidermy could produce mounted animals that look not just lifelike, but alive. Akeley was equally committed to presenting mounts in the context of their scientifically accurate environments and social interactions.

Akeley&#x27;s techniques resulted in anatomically accurate, skinless manikins of an animal in lifelike actions and postures. The mannequin was extremely lightweight and hollow and made primarily of papier mache and wire mesh. Akeley based the mannequin on precise field measurements and photographs as well as his understanding of the animal&#x27;s anatomy and behavior in its natural environment. After creating the mannequin, the hide and hooves were meticulously attached.

The steps to the Akeley Method:

# Akeley first sculpted a detailed and precise 1/12th scale clay model of his ultimate mount
# He then built an armature using: skeletal bones, wood, metal rods, wire, and wire mesh
# Akeley then covered the armature with plaster and then clay, which he sculpted to produce an exact model of the living animal
# He then coated the clay model with plaster. When dry, the plaster mold was removed from the clay in sections and resulted in a perfect mold of the sculpted model
# Papier mache pulp and supportive mesh wire was applied to the inside of the plaster mold and when dried produced a full-scale hollow mannequin in the exact form of the original sculpture
#The mannequin was clothed with the original pelt and sewn up so that not a seam is discernible

==African expeditions==
Akeley first traveled to Africa in 1896 when he was invited by Daniel Elliot, Curator of the Zoology Department in the new Columbian Field Museum, on an eight month expedition to Somaliland. It was on this trip that Akeley came face to face with a deadly 80-pound leopard which he strangled with his bare hands. Akeley collected hundreds of animal specimens including: hartebeest, gazelles, hyenas, kudus, oryx, and lions. The process of collecting specimens included: killing, measuring, photographing, skinning, de-boning, preserving, and packing them for shipment back to Chicago.

In 1905, Marshall Field funded Akeley’s next trip to Africa which lasted twelve months and brought back two bull elephants which he would later mount for display. Akeley took nearly 1,000 glass plate photos and collected 17 tons of material including: 400 mammal skins, 1200 small mammal skins, 800 bird skins, and a fair number of bird and mammal skeletons. In addition to zoologic material he also collected more than 900 anthropological specimens and crates of leaves that he would use as models for his dioramas.

In 1909, Akeley accompanied Theodore Roosevelt on a year-long expedition in Africa funded by the Smithsonian Institution and began working at the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, where his efforts can still be seen in the Akeley Hall of African Mammals. Akeley joined the Explorers Club in 1912, having been sponsored by three of the Club&#x27;s seven Charter Members: Frank Chapman, Henry Collins Walsh, and Marshall Saville. For qualifying, Akeley wrote only, &quot;Explorations in Somaliland and British East Africa.&quot; He became the Club&#x27;s sixth president serving from 1917–1918.In 1921, eager to learn about gorillas to determine if killing them for museum dioramas was justified, Akeley led an expedition to Mt. Mikeno in the Virunga Mountains at the edge of the then Belgian Congo. At that time, gorillas were quite exotic, with very few even in zoos, and collecting such animals for educational museum exhibitions was not uncommon. In the process of &quot;collecting&quot; several mountain gorillas, Akeley&#x27;s attitude was fundamentally changed and for the remainder of his life he worked for the establishment of a gorilla preserve in the Virungas. In 1925, greatly influenced by Akeley, King Albert I of Belgium established the Albert National Park, (since renamed Virunga National Park). It was Africa&#x27;s first national park. Opposed to hunting them for sport or trophies, he remained an advocate of collection for scientific and educational purposes. 

Akeley began his fifth journey to the Congo with the start of the dry season in late 1926. He died on November 18 of dysentery and was buried in Africa, just miles from where he encountered his first gorilla, the &quot;Old Man of Mikeno&quot;.

== Personal life ==
His second wife, Mary Jobe Akeley, married him two years before he died. He had previously been married to Delia Akeley (1869–1970) for nearly 20 years. Delia Akeley accompanied him on two of his biggest and most productive safaris to Africa, in 1905 and again in 1909. Delia later returned to Africa twice under the auspices of the Brooklyn Museum of Arts and Sciences.

== Legacy ==

The World Taxidermy &amp; Fish Carving Championships awards gold medallions that bear Carl Akeley&#x27;s likeness—based on a photograph he had taken at Stein Photography in Milwaukee—to its &quot;Best in World&quot; winners. There is also a Carl Akeley Award for the most artistic mount at the World Show. The medallions were sculpted by Floyd Easterman of the Milwaukee Public Museum. The Akeley Hall of African Mammals of the American Museum of Natural History and the Akeley Memorial Hall at The Field Museum are named for him.

<doc id="851112" wikidata="Q1368818" url="?curid=851112" title="Tsavo East National Park">
<text>Tsavo East National Park is a national park in Kenya with an area of . It was established in April 1948 and covers a semi-arid area previously known as the Taru Desert. Together with the Tsavo West National Park, it forms an area of about 22,000 square kilometers. The Tsavo River flows west to east through the national park, which is located in the Taita-Taveta County of the former Coast Province.

==Geography==

Tsavo East National Park is generally flat, with dry plains across which the Galana River flows. Other features include the Yatta Plateau and Lugard Falls.
Inside Tsavo East National Park, the Athi and Tsavo rivers converge to form the Athi-Galana-Sabaki River. Most of the park consists of semi-arid grasslands and savanna.
The Yatta Plateau, the world&#x27;s longest lava flow, runs along the western boundary of the park above the Athi-Galana-Sabaki River. Its length was formed by lava from Ol Donyo Sabuk Mountain.
The Mudanda Rock is a inselberg of stratified rock that acts as a water catchment that supplies a natural dam below. It offers an excellent vantage point for the hundreds of elephants and other wildlife that come to drink during the dry season.
Lugard Falls, named after Frederick Lugard, is a series of white water rapids on the Athi-Galana-Sabaki River.
Aruba Dam was built in 1952 across the Voi River. The reservoir created by the dam attracts many animals and water birds.

Tsavo West National Park is more mountainous and wetter, with swamps, Lake Jipe and the Mzima Springs. It is known for birdlife and for its large mammals. It is also home to a black rhino sanctuary.

==Archaeology and history==
Although a few Early Stone Age and Middle Stone Age archaeological sites are recorded from ground surface finds in Tsavo, there is much evidence of thriving Late Stone Age economy from 6,000 to 1,300 years ago. Research has shown that Late Stone Age archaeological sites are found close to the Galana River in high numbers. The inhabitants of these sites hunted wild animals, fished, and kept domesticated animals. Because of the sparse availability of water away from the Galana River, human settlement in Tsavo focused on the riparian areas and in rock shelters as one moves west.

Swahili people traded with the inhabitants of Tsavo for ivory, catskins, and probably slaves as early as 700 AD (and probably earlier). There is no evidence for direct Swahili &quot;colonization&quot; of Tsavo. Instead, trade was probably accomplished by moving goods to and from the Swahili Coast via extended kin-networks. Trade goods such as cowry shells and beads have been recovered from archaeological sites dating to the early Swahili period.
19th century British and German explorers document people we now refer to as Orma and Watha during their travels through the &quot;nyika&quot; (&quot;bush&quot; or &quot;hinterland&quot;) and generally viewed them as hostile toward their interests. Beginning in the late 19th/early 20th century, the British began a concerted effort to colonise the interior of Kenya and built a railway through Tsavo in 1898. Two Tsavo Man-Eaters terrorised the construction crews led by John Henry Patterson who eventually shot the pair but not before they had killed one hundred and thirty five Indians and local workers. The railway was eventually completed through to Kisumu on Lake Victoria.

Tsavo remained the homeland for Orma pastoralists and Watha hunter-gatherers until 1948, when it was gazetted a national park. At that time, the Orma with their livestock were driven off and the aboriginal population of the Watha people was forcefully relocated to Voi and Mtito Andei as well as other locations within the nearby Taita Hills. Following Kenyan independence in 1963, hunting was banned in the park and management of Tsavo was turned over to the authority that eventually became the Kenya Wildlife Service.

== Wildlife ==

Tsavo East National Park is considered one of the world&#x27;s biodiversity strongholds, providing undeveloped homes to vast numbers of animals.

===Mammals===
Famous are the Tsavo lions, a population whose adult males often lack manes entirely. As of 2006, there were about 675 lions in the Amboseli-Tsavo ecosystem.

Some of the many mammals found in the park include:
* Aardwolf
* Yellow baboon
* African buffalo
* Senegal bushbaby
* Bushbuck
* Caracal
* African wildcat
* Southeast African cheetah
* African civet
* Kirk&#x27;s dik-dik
* African wild dog
* African dormouse
* Blue duiker
* Bush duiker
* Harvey&#x27;s red duiker
* Common eland
* African bush elephant
* Bat-eared fox
* Northern greater galago
* Grant&#x27;s gazelle
* Rusty-spotted genet
* Common genet
* Gerenuk 
* Giraffe
* African savanna hare
* Springhare
* Coke&#x27;s hartebeest
* Hunter&#x27;s hartebeest
* East African hedgehog
* Spotted hyena
* Striped hyena
* Yellow-spotted rock hyrax
* Southern tree hyrax
* Impala
* Black-backed jackal
* Side-striped jackal
* Klipspringer
* Lesser kudu
* African leopard
* Lion
* Banded mongoose
* Dwarf mongoose
* Egyptian mongoose
* Marsh mongoose
* Slender mongoose
* White-tailed mongoose
* Vervet monkey
* Sykes&#x27; monkey
* Fringe-eared oryx
* Clawless otter
* Ground pangolin
* Crested porcupine
* Cane rat
* Giant rat
* Naked mole rat
* Honey badger
* Bohor reedbuck
* Black rhinoceros
* Serval
* Elephant shrew
* Bush squirrel
* Red bush squirrel
* Striped ground squirrel
* Unstriped ground squirrel
* Suni
* Common warthog
* waterbuck
* Plains zebra
* Grevy&#x27;s zebra

===Birds===
Over 500 bird species have been recorded in the area, including ostriches, kestrels, buzzards, starlings, weaver birds, kingfishers, hornbills, secretary birds and herons.

== Threats==
Between 2001 and 2006, more than 100 lions, elephants and other wildlife have been killed in the Amboseli-Tsavo ecosystem. Most of them have been speared by young men. The poachers usually do not face serious consequences. In contrast, the game scouts who arrested offenders have been punished by the community.

<text>Soyuz TM-20 was the twentieth expedition to the Russian Space Station Mir. It launched Russian cosmonauts Aleksandr Viktorenko, Yelena Kondakova, and German cosmonaut Ulf Merbold.
==Crew==
==Mission highlights==

The flight carried 10 kg of equipment for use by Merbold in ESA&#x27;s month-long Euromir
94 experiment program. During automatic approach to Mir&#x27;s front port, the
spacecraft yawed unexpectedly. Viktorenko completed a manual docking
without additional incident.

<text>Friedrich Heer (10 April 191618 September 1983) was an Austrian historian born in Vienna. 

==Early life==
Heer received a PhD at the University of Vienna in 1938. Even as a student, he came into conflict with pan-German historians as a staunch opponent of National Socialism.

He was arrested for the first time on 11 March 1938 by the Austrian Nazis. He founded a small Catholic resistance group and sought to amalgamate into one organised band the Christians, communists and trade unionists against the Nazis. As a soldier, he later came into contact with the resistance group &quot;Soldatenrat&quot;.

==Career==
From 1946 to 1961, he was the editor of the weekly magazine &quot;Die Furche&quot; [The Furrow], and in 1961, he was appointed chief literacy to the Vienna Burgtheater. He taught at the University of Vienna. Most of his books have been translated into several languages. He contributed &quot;The Medieval World: 1100-1350&quot; (pub. 1962) to the Weidenfeld and Nicolson History of Civilisation series.

==Later life==
In 1967, he became the first winner of the Martin Buber-Franz Rosenzweig Medal, awarded by a group of forty-four German societies for Christian and Jewish understanding, for his achievement with &quot;God&#x27;s First Love&quot;.

He died in Vienna.

<doc id="851152" wikidata="Q506047" url="?curid=851152" title="Andrew Loomis">
<text>William Andrew Loomis (June 15, 1892 – May 25, 1959) was an American illustrator, writer, and art instructor. His commercial work was featured prominently in advertising and magazines. However, Loomis is best known as the writer of a series of instructional art books printed throughout the 20th century, and also as the inventor of the &quot;Loomis method&quot;. Long after his death, Loomis&#x27;s realistic style has continued to influence popular artists.

==Early life==
Loomis was born on June 15, 1892, in Syracuse, New York. Loomis grew up in Zanesville, Ohio, and spent much of his working life in Chicago, Illinois. He studied at the Art Students League of New York under George Bridgman and Frank DuMond when he was 19. Loomis then went back to Chicago to work at an art studio and study at the Art Institute of Chicago.

==Career==
After military service in World War I, Loomis worked for a couple of advertising agencies before opening his own studio in downtown Chicago in 1922. From that time until the late 1930s Loomis produced advertising paintings for many large companies such as Coca-Cola, Studebaker, Palmolive, Quaker Oats, Munsingwear, and Kellogg&#x27;s. He was the official portrait painter of the Dionne quintuplets, and he created Jack and Bingo for the cover of the Cracker Jack box. In 1932, Loomis created paintings for the advertisements that would introduce 3 Musketeers. One of those paintings was a portrait of a Mars chemist, Frances Herdlinger. Herdlinger was one of three women chemists working regularly with Forrest Mars Sr. on the development of the new candy bar.

In the 1930s, he taught at the American Academy of Art. It was during this time that his teaching techniques were compiled for his first book, &quot;Fun With a Pencil&quot; (1939).

Loomis would go on to release several more books in the coming decades, including one of his most popular, &quot;Figure Drawing for All It&#x27;s Worth&quot; (1943). Many of the books exhibit his own personally crafted techniques – such as the &quot;ball and plane&quot; method of head drawing – guided by Loomis&#x27;s humorous dialogue. Many of the titles gained strong appeal for their academic value and went through several printings during the 20th century. Loomis died in 1959, but his final book, &quot;The Eye of the Painter and the Elements of Beauty&quot; (1961), was printed posthumously.

== The Loomis method ==
The Loomis Method is a drawing technique that uses grids to represent the human head from various angles accurately. This technique was developed by Loomis in the 1940s, and was first described in his book &quot;Drawing the Head and Hands&quot;. The Loomis method for the construction of the head is very popular because it is easy to learn and remember and can be applied to any drawing of the head.

==Influence and legacy==
Titan Books reissued the Andrew Loomis titles in facsimile editions between 2011 and 2013. Prior to that, the books had been out of print for decades, available only as excerpts by Walter Foster Publishing. Some of Loomis&#x27;s books are currently being published in Japanese via Maar Sha Co., Ltd. Early prints have become highly collectible, sought by art enthusiasts and practitioners.

<text>Noah was the name of the first cloned &quot;gaur&quot;. He was cloned and gestated in the womb of a cow named Bessie. Gaurs are listed as a vulnerable species on the IUCN Red List. Noah was delivered on January 8, 2001, but he died within just 48 hours of dysentery on January 10, 2001. Noah&#x27;s condition was monitored by Dr. Jonathan Hill and his teammates in Iowa. The process used to clone Noah was nuclear transfer.

<text>Forrestfield is a suburb of the City of Kalamunda in Western Australia. It lies 15 kilometres to the south-east of Perth at the base of the Darling Scarp and the southern border of Perth Airport.

The suburb is split by Roe Highway into a southern residential area and a northern industrial area. The suburb is adjacent to Wattle Grove, Cloverdale and Kalamunda.

==Industrial area==
===Rail===
The industrial area contains a major rail hub. The 241 hectare Forrestfield Marshalling Yard was built adjacent to the Kwinana railway line opening in stages between 1968 and 1973 in conjunction with the nearby Kewdale Freight Terminal as a replacement for the Perth marshalling yard and two other inner Perth yards. Within the confines of the yard, separate depots were built for locomotive, carriage and wagon maintenance.

It was previously used by the Western Australian Government Railways, Westrail and Australian Railroad Group. As at January 2018, Aurizon, SCT Logistics and Watco Australia use the yard. Aurizon closed its terminal in late-2017 as part of the closure of its intermodal business. Gemco Rail also has a facility.

Bounded by Dundas Road to the east, the Tonkin Highway to the south and Perth Airport to the west, some of the land was no longer required for railway by in the late 1990s and rezoned for industrial use. A combined 102 hectares was sold to the CBH Group, LandCorp and Specialised Container Transport.

CBH Group&#x27;s Metro Grains Centre was completed in 1998. In mid-2005 BlueScope constructed a large warehouse on former Westrail land. Kenworth DAF Trucks also relocated from Guildford to a new complex on Abernethy Road in 2005.

===Infrastructure===
On November 3, 2016, construction commenced on the Airport line, which opened on October 9, 2022. The line has three stations: Redcliffe, Airport Central, and High Wycombe.

The Western Australian Government has prompted the City of Kalamunda to investigate the possibility of business and infrastructure opportunities arising from the completion of the new link for Forrestfield and its surrounding areas. The completion of the Airport Link is expected to facilitate the continuing growth of Perth Airport as a nationally integral part of employment, commerce and international trade.

Forrestfield&#x27;s northern and eastern outskirts are home to the majority of the areas industrial enterprise. The area is host to a wide range of commercial business-to-business industries. Some of the most notable occupants include Grace Removals, Improvid and the Super Retail Group.

==History==

Settlement of the area dates from the late 1800s. Population was minimal until the early 1900s, with growth during the interwar period. Significant development did not occur until the post-war years, with rapid growth from the 1950s into the 1970s. The population has been relatively stable since the early 1990s, a result of some new dwellings being added to the area, but a decline in the average number of persons living in each dwelling.

There is authority to suggest it is named after John Forrest, Western Australia&#x27;s first Premier, or his brother Alexander. However, local folklore suggests that the name comes from Charles Hale, who settled in the area in 1902 and planted crops amongst the native forest bushland, hence Forrestfield. In 1921 a Forrestfield Progress Association was formed, and the name was shown on plans in 1944.

==Shopping==
Located on the corner of Hale Road and Strelitzia Avenue, the Forrestfield Forum and Marketplace comprises 52 shops including Coles and Woolworths supermarkets. It is owned by the Hawaiian Group.

Cumberland Road has a Foodworks supermarket, a newsagency, a hairdresser, some dining and fast-food venues. There are a range of other retail establishments scattered throughout Forrestfield, including taverns, liqueur shops, a nursery, and various delis.

==Educational facilities==
Forrestfield contains the following educational institutions:

*Darling Range Sports College, formerly Forrestfield Senior High School
*Dawson Park Primary
*Forrestfield Primary
*HillSide Christian College, formerly Forrestfield Christian School
*Woodlupine Primary
*Tabor College

==Demographics==
In the , Forrestfield recorded a population of 13,181 people: 50.0% male and 50.0% female. The median/average age of the Forrestfield population is 38 years.

==Politics==
==Amenities==

Hartfield Park Recreation Centre: This complex includes an indoor stadium as well as playing fields for cricket, rugby, Australian rules football, hockey, soccer (football), an 18-hole golf course, an equestrian centre plus support facilities for each. There is also a nature conservation park and a lake. Discovery Park - Perth Airport Caravan and Holiday Park on Hale Road just off of Tonkin Highway.

<doc id="851176" wikidata="Q1424853" url="?curid=851176" title="Soyuz TM-21">
<text>Soyuz TM-21 was a crewed Soyuz spaceflight to &quot;Mir&quot;. The mission launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome, atop a Soyuz-U2 carrier rocket, at 06:11:34 UTC on 14 March 1995. The flight marked the first time thirteen humans were flying in space simultaneously, with three aboard the Soyuz, three aboard &quot;Mir&quot; and seven aboard Space Shuttle &quot;Endeavour&quot;, flying STS-67.

The spacecraft carried expedition EO-18 to the space station. This included the first American astronaut to launch on a Soyuz spacecraft and board &quot;Mir&quot;, Norman Thagard, for the American Thagard Increment aboard the station, which was the first Increment of the Shuttle-Mir program. The three crew members it launched were relieved by Space Shuttle &quot;Atlantis&quot; during STS-71, when they were replaced by expedition EO-19. The crew returned to earth aboard Soyuz TM-21 on 11 September 1995.

== Crew ==
== Mir Principal Expedition 18 ==
The major objectives of the Mir 18 mission were to conduct joint U.S.-Russian medical research and weightlessness effects investigations and to reconfigure the station for the arrival of the Spektr science module and the Space Shuttle Atlantis. The historic mission saw the addition of the first new module (Spektr) since Kristall arrived in 1990, the first American (Thagard) to be part of a Mir crew, and the first docking of a U.S. spacecraft with the Mir space station.

=== March 1995 – Mir 18 Arrives/Mir 17 Departs ===

==== Progress M-26 Undocks for Soyuz TM-21 to Dock ====
Progress M-26 separated from the complex on 15 March and made a destructive reentry into the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere to clear the Kvant docking port for the new Soyuz. Soyuz TM-21 docked by automatic control at the Kvant docking port on the first try at 7:45 UTC on 16 March. The new arrivals were greeted by the Mir 17 crew with the traditional Russian gifts of salt and bread, and shortly thereafter were congratulated on a successful docking and transfer by Russian Space Agency (RSA) Director General Yuri Koptev and NASA Associate Administrator Wayne Littles. The crew spent much of the day transferring equipment and supplies from Soyuz to Mir. Norman Thagard spoke with STS-67 Commander Steve Oswald in a radio hookup, exchanging congratulations on their respective flights and discussing the symbolic importance of Thagard&#x27;s venture as the first American to visit Mir.

On 17 March, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin stopped by the TsUP to congratulate the crew. Later, in a televised communication with ground controllers, Thagard said he hoped his visit to Mir would be the start of long-term space cooperation between the two nations. He and Polyakov agreed that the present joint research might be the foundation for ultimate joint flights to Mars.

During the next few days, the Mir 18 crew took their body mass measurements as a baseline for investigations throughout the mission and were briefed by the Mir 17 crew on the status of the complex and ongoing studies. The outgoing crew stowed equipment and experiment samples in Soyuz TM-20 for their return and checked out the vehicle systems.

==== Mir 17 Mission Ends ====
Aleksandr Viktorenko, Yelena Kondakova and Valeri Polyakov entered Soyuz TM-20 on 21 March and departed from Mir on 22 March, landing safely on the same day about 50 km from Arkalyk, Kazakhstan. Polyakov had set a new record for spaceflight duration: he had been on Mir since 8 January 1994 for 438 straight days. This trip, added to his Mir stay in 1988, brought his total days in space to 679. He was, however, strong enough to walk to the chairs that rescue crews provided for the cosmonauts&#x27; transport to a field hospital. He said his fit condition was a positive indication that humans could withstand a trip to Mars.

==== Mir 18 Crew On Their Own ====
The Mir 18 crew settled into their daily routine, collecting body fluid samples for the seven metabolic experiments to be performed during their mission. They also took air and water samples for four hygiene, sanitation and radiation experiments which would determine the role of the Mir environment in human health, safety and efficiency. Each crewman spent time in a Chibis suit for measurement of cardiovascular system responses to lower body negative pressure. In the absence of gravity, blood pools in the upper torso and head, causing cardiovascular deconditioning. The Chibis suit sealed at the waist and incrementally induced a partial vacuum, or negative pressure, which drew body fluids back to the lower extremities. Dezhurov and Strekalov also changed out a condenser in the air conditioning system, part of a long-term maintenance program to prolong the life of the station.

=== April 1995 – Resupply and Maintenance ===

==== Progress M-27 Resupplies Mir ====
Progress M-27 was launched from Baikonur on 9 April. It docked with the Mir base block on 11 April at 21:00 UTC under flawless control by the automatic Kurs system, although Dezhurov was ready to take over by manual control if Kurs malfunctions recurred. This Progress module carried with it a Raduga return capsule.

==== Cosmonautics Day Observed on 12 April ====
On the 34th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin&#x27;s flight in a Vostock capsule, the Mir crew had a light schedule for Cosmonautics Day, a Russian national holiday. Activities included press conferences through the Russian and U.S. mission control centers.

==== Progress Unloaded ====
On 13 April, the crew began unloading the Progress cargo of food, water, fuel, repair materials for life support systems and equipment for medical and environmental research. Among the biological experiments were some Japanese quail eggs. These, the crew put into an incubator on 14 April. Progress M-27 also brought a new international experiment in the form of GFZ-1, a spherical satellite with a mass of 20 kg and a diameter of 21 cm. The German satellite was built by the German firm Kayser-Threde. Geoforschungszentrum Potsdam would coordinate the satellite&#x27;s transmission of geodetic measurements by means of laser reflection to about 25 observatories around the globe. GFZ-1 was successfully launched by the Mir crew from the base block airlock on 19 April. Two days before, the crew had launched a container with garbage as a practice run for the operation.

==== Interior Station Work ====
Late in April, the crew learned that extravehicular activities (EVAs) for solar array work, scheduled to start on 28 April, had been postponed due to a delay in launch of the Spektr module. One reason for the delay was that equipment to interface with Mir&#x27;s manual control system was added to Spektr in case the Kurs system failed again. The crew continued routine experiment work, defrosted the ESA freezer, replaced a humidity control fan with one from Progress M-27, installed a battery unit in the Kristall module and began removing an unused shower in the Kvant module to make room for a new set of gyrodynes to support the upcoming Atlantis docking. They dismantled the shower and cut it into small pieces for stowage on the Progress module, then installed the gyrodynes.

=== May 1995 – Four EVAs ===

==== Injury Jeopardizes EVA Plans ====
ITAR-TASS reported on 5 May that Strekalov had scratched his hand earlier during cleaning tasks. The scratch became inflamed and caused some concern about Strekalov&#x27;s ability to do the EVA work. Medical specialists on the ground viewed downlink video of the hand and prescribed a medication to be administered by Thagard. The injury healed and the EVA plans proceeded.

==== First Mir 18 EVA ====
On 12 May, Dezhurov and Strekalov began their first EVA to prepare the station for Spektr&#x27;s arrival, exiting the Kvant 2 airlock at 4:20 UTC and transferring to the Kvant astrophysics module by means of the STrela boom. There they installed electrical cable attachments and adjusted solar array actuators. Then they moved to Kristall and practiced folding three panels of the solar array to be moved to Kvant. Thagard supported the crew from inside Mir by relaying instructions from the ground or from reference manuals when the station was not in range of ground communications. The spacewalk lasted 6 hours and 15 minutes.

==== Problems on the Second EVA ====
In their second space walk, on 17 May, the cosmonauts successfully folded the solar array panels, assisted by Thagard, who controlled servomotor switches from inside Kristall. The spacewalkers disconnected the array from Kristall, attached it to the Strela boom, and moved it to Kvant. The work took so much time that, having already almost used the oxygen available through their suits, they were forced to secure the array to Kvant with tool teathers and postpone electrical connection. Even so, the EVA lasted 6 hours and 52 minutes. Power supply inside the station suffered without the connection of the array, necessitating interim agumentation by Progress M-27 and Soyuz TM-21&#x27;s solar arrays.

==== Solar Array Redeployed in Mir 18 Third EVA ====
On their 22 May walk of 5 hours and 15 minutes, Dezhurov and Strekalov successfully connected the solar array to Kvant, and Thagard commanded its redeployment from inside the station. The cosmonauts then returned to Kristall, where the retracted 13 panels of another solar array to provide clearance for rotation of Kristall during its relocation to make room for Spektr. Approximately 60% of that array was still available as a power source.

==== Progress M-27 Undocks to Free -X Port ====
Progress M-27 left Mir at 23:53 UTC on 22 May and made a destructive reentry into the Pacific on 23 May. Thus the -Y port was freed for use in the multiple module relocation that would be necessary for the docking and ultimate permanent placement of Spektr.

==== First Kristall Move and Fourth EVA ====

From inside the station, Dezhurov controlled the undocking of Kristall on 26 May from the -Y port. Then the module was moved by means of its Lyappa arm to the -X port just vacated by Progress M-27. On 28 May, in their fourth EVA of the mission, Dezhurov and Strekalov moved a docking cone (Konus), from the -Y port to the -Z port to serve as the docking receptacle for Kristall in its next move. The space-suited cosmonauts did this work from inside the depressurized base block transfer compartment.

==== Second Kristall Move ====
In another undocking and relocation sequence controlled rom inside the station, on 30 May, Kristall was moved from the -X port to the -Z port. Because of a temporary failure in the hydraulic connections, the docking was not successful until the third attempt.

=== June 1995 – Mir Expansion and Historic Docking ===

==== Spektr Docking and Fifth EVA ====
Despite anxieties about the automatic docking, the Spektr module successfully docked to the -X port under control of the Kurs system on 1 June. The next day, in their fifth EVA, the cosmonauts again entered the depressurized base block to transfer compartment and moved the Konus from the -Z to the -Y port. With the Mir crew and TsUP ground controllers in joint control of the Spektr Layappa arm, the module was moved to the -Y port on 2 June. After the redocking, the crew began checking out and activating the new module&#x27;s systems and transferring new supplies of food, fueled and equipment from Spektr to other parts of the complex. On 5 June, one of Spektr&#x27;s four solar arrays failed to fully unfurl because a restraint that held it in place for launch failed to release, and the crew was unable to extend it by sending pulses of power to the motor or by firing Mir&#x27;s thrusters. TsUP controllers, aided by videos transmitted to them by the crew, began plans for a sixth EVA so that the cosmonauts could release the stuck array.

==== Thagard Surpasses Previous American Record ====
Norm Thagard held a press conference on 6 June, the day he surpassed the long-held record of U.S. human spaceflight duration of 84 days set by the Skylab 4 crew from 16 November 1973, to 8 February 1974.

==== Kristall Relocated Again ====
Before its last scheduled move of the Mir 18 mission, the cosmonauts had to install two new batteries in Kristall to boost its power supply enough to accomplish the undocking and redocking. Then on 10 June, the module was undocked from the -Z port, and again with the use of Lyappa, moved to the -X port.

==== Atlantis Launch on STS-71 ====
After 4 days of delays caused by bad weather at Kennedy Space Center, Atlantis was launched on 27 June at 19:32 UTC. About 3 hours after launch, Atlantis Commander Robert Gibson began a series of orbital maneuvering system firings that would, through the next 2 days, take Atlantis to Mir&#x27;s orbit, gradually decreasing the closing rate as well as distance. On the second mission day, as they moved toward the station, Gibson, Charles Precourt and Bonnie Dunbar began activating the Spacelab module in preparations for life sciences investigations. The crew extended the Orbital Docking System (ODS) docking ring to the docking position and found it in excellent working order.

==== Historic Docking ====
On 29 June at 13:00 UTC, Gibson guided Atlantis to the docking port on the Kristall module and Harbaugh engaged the docking mechanism. The two spacecraft met 216 nautical miles above the Lake Baikal region of Russia. After pressurization and leak checks of the vestibule airlock, the two crews met and exchanged greetings and congratulations. There were ten of them, a new record of the largest crew ever aboard a single complex. The docked Mir and Atlantis totaled 220 tones, a new record for orbiting spacecraft mass.

=== July 1995 – Mir 18 completion ===
After Atlantis left the Russian space station on 4 July, the homeward-bound Mir 18 crew continued their medical and scientific investigations in the Spacelab module in Atlantis&#x27; payload bay. They used the lower body negative pressure unit and a baroreflex neck cuff to test cardiovascular orthostatic function response to microgravity.

== Mir Principal Expedition 19 ==
The only complete Mir mission of 1995 with an all-Russian crew, Mir 19 had many international elements. The first Mir crew launched on a Space Shuttle Orbiter, Anatoly Solovyev and Nikolai Budarin began their work in conjunction with a visiting U.S. crew and departing Mir 18 international crew. Two of their EVAs involved deployment and retrieval of internationals experiments. And they ended their stay by welcoming an incoming international crew.

=== July 1995 – Cosmic Ballet ===

==== The &quot;Cosmic Ballet&quot; ====

On 4 July, Solovyev and Budarin donned their flight suits, entered Soyuz TM-21 and undocked from Mir to a station-keeping position from which they photographed Mir and Atlantis, still docked. About 15 minutes later, Atlantis undocked from Mir when Gibson released the hooks that held the two craft together and allowed the docking system springs to nudge Atlantis away. As Atlantis slowly flew around the station, Soyuz TM-21 redocked and the two craft continued to take pictures of each other and Mir. Gibson called this set of celestial maneuvers a &quot;cosmic ballet.&quot; However, after the Soyuz module had to redock a few minutes sooner than planned when the Mir onboard computer which controls station attitude and solar array pointing malfunctioned. The station complex, about 10 degrees of the correct attitude, was becoming unstable and starting to drift. The cosmonauts had to get back quickly to regain attitude control of the station. TsUP controllers left the station in free drift while the cosmonauts replaced attitude-control hardware in the computer.

==== First EVA of Mir 19 ====
Before their launch, Solovyev and Budarin had trained to use the new tools created for releasing the stuck Spektr solar array. On 14 July, they exited the Kvant 2 hatch and made their way to Spektr using the Strela boom. They quickly cut the offending restraint, and all but one section of Spektr&#x27;s jammed solar array deployed. Then they were able to route the power input to the complex. They inspected the -Z port docking mechanism and found no signs of damage or pollution, clearing the port for relocation of the Kristall module. Before reentering the Kvant 2 hatch, they inspected one of that module&#x27;s solar arrays which was not tracking the sun correctly. Their EVA ran five hours and 34 minutes, about twenty minutes over the originally budgeted time.

==== Kristall Relocated Once More ====
In a 90-minute session on 17 July, Kristall was transferred by means of its Lyapa arm to the -Z docking port from the -X port where Progress M-28 docked later in July.

==== Problems During the Second Mir 19 EVA ====
The primary purpose of the second space walk on 19 July was to deploy the Belgian-French MIRAS (Mir infrared spectrometer) on the far end of the Spektr module. But minutes after the EA began, Solovyev&#x27;s Orlan-DMA suit cooling system malfunctioned and the TsUP ordered him to stay attached by an umbilical to Kvant 2. The MIRAS deployment had to be postponed, but Budarin was able to do some preparatory work alone. he also retrieved the American cosmic ray detector, TREK, which had been on Kvant 2 surface since 1991 and switched out cassettes of sample construction materials as part of an ongoing space exposure experiment. his time outside totaled 3 hours and 8 minutes, but the troubles were not all over: After closing the Kvant 2 EVA hatch, the cosmonauts found a 2 mm gap in the seal through which air was escaping. They had to work with the hatch to get it tightly shut.

==== Progress M-28 Arrives ====
Launched by a Soyuz booster from Baikonur on 20 July, Progress M-28 bore 2.4 tons of food and water, fuel and oxidizer, and science equipment including about 335 kg for use during Euromir 95. Two days later, using the Kurs system, Progress M-28 docked at the -X port of the base block.

==== Installation of MIRAS During Third EVA ====
On 21 July, the cosmonauts opened the Kvant 2 hatch again and retrieved the cooling umbilical left outside in their last EVA. Using the Strela boom, they made their way to the Spektr module, on which they installed the 220 kg MIRAS spectrometer. This final EVA of Mir 18 lasted 5 hours and 35 minutes.

=== August 1995 – Interior Work ===
With their EVAs completed, the Mir 19 crew turned their attention to experiments in life sciences and astrophysics and smelting experiments in the Gallar furnace. They unloaded the cargo brought by the Progress module and monitored the automatic refueling by Progress of the base block propellant tanks. They also performed station maintenance and repairs, including installation in Kvant 2 of new gyrodynes brought up on Progress. They repaired the seals on other gyrodyne cases with a lute-type sealer called &quot;germetik&quot;.

=== September 1995 – Progress M-28 Undocked, Soyuz TM-22 Docked and Soyuz TM-21 Undocked ===

==== Progress M-28 Undocks ====
Packed with trash and obsolete equipment, Progress M-28 left the -X port on 4 September and splashed down into the Pacific, thus clearing the way for Soyuz TM-22 to dock with the next Mir crew.

==== Mir 20 and Euromir 95 Crew Launched ====
Soyuz TM-22 was launched from Baikonur on 3 September at 8:58 UTC. After two days of autonomous orbital flight, on 5 September, the Soyuz spacecraft docked at the -X docking port.

==== Mir 19 Ends ====
Solovyev and Budarin ended their 75-day mission on 11 September, departing the station in the Soyuz TM-21 that had brought the Mir 18 crew up on 16 March. Their Soyuz made a safe landing in Kazakhstan, 302 km northeast of Arkalyk, &quot;far away from the aiming point.&quot; Rescue parties, however, found the crew in excellent condition.

<doc id="851181" wikidata="Q2590329" url="?curid=851181" title="Communist Party of Australia (1971)">
<text>The Communist Party of Australia (CPA) is a communist party in Australia. It was founded in 1971 as the Socialist Party of Australia (SPA) and adopted its current name in 1996. The party was established by former members of the original Communist Party of Australia who resigned or were expelled due to internal disagreements over the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia and the party&#x27;s adoption of Eurocommunism. The party had its first and only electoral win in 2012 when it gained a seat on the Auburn City Council, which they held until 2016.

==History==
===Socialist Party (1971–1996)===
In the late 1960s, the CPA, under the leadership of National Secretary Laurie Aarons, became a strong supporter of &quot;Eurocommunism&quot;, of abandoning Marxism–Leninism and democratic centralism, and trying to form a &quot;united front&quot; of the various left-wing forces thrown up by the movement of opposition to the Vietnam War. The CPA leadership had become increasingly critical of the Soviet Union, particularly over the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. Dissidents took the view that the CPA should not become a left social-democratic party, and should continue as a Marxist–Leninist party. The group was described as pro-Soviet hardliners. Their position put them at odds with the CPA leadership.

The SPA was led by a group of veteran trade union officials such as Pat Clancy and Peter Symon. Clancy resigned from the SPA in 1983, and Symon was the general secretary from its formation until his death in December 2008, a total of 36 years.

===Communist Party (1996–present)===
The old CPA was dissolved in 1991. The SPA, believing itself to be the rightful successor to the original CPA formed in 1920, changed its name to Communist Party of Australia at its 8th Party National Congress in October 1996.

After Symon&#x27;s death, party president Hannah Middleton was elected general secretary by the 11th Party National Congress in October 2009, with Vinicio Molina succeeding Middleton as party president. Bob Briton was elected general secretary at the 12th Party Congress in 2013.

Bob Briton resigned as general secretary of the CPA in March 2019. Briton came into conflict with the central committee (CC) due to ideological differences between himself and others on the central committee, being accused of taking a defeatist position. This accusation was made after Briton attempted to work with the youth outside party structures. Briton deleted most of the party&#x27;s social media outlets in response. Briton split the party and formed the Australian Communist Party alongside other former members.

On 13–14 April 2019, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Australia elected a new leadership led by General Secretary Andrew Irving and National President Vinnie Molina.

==Policies==
The current CPA is a traditional Marxist–Leninist communist party whose ultimate objective is the revolutionary transformation of Australian society and the establishment of socialism in Australia. It describes its objective as being to &quot;change the direction of politics in Australia and eventually, to replace the capitalist system with a socialist one.&quot;

The party has strong, historical links to the Australian trade union movement.

The party maintains friendly relations with communist and socialist parties overseas and is a participant in the International Meeting of Communist and Workers&#x27; Parties (IMCWP).

The party&#x27;s main policies are:
* The socialist reconstruction of the Australian society
* An end to privatisations of assets owned by the federal and state governments
* To free Australia from foreign transnationals
* Regulation by the Federal Government of prices, profit levels, and interest rates
* The abolition of the Goods and Services Tax
* Expansion of the public sector
* Increase in the national minimum wage
* Increase in pension, unemployment benefits
* Reduction of the working week
* Halt reductions in tariffs
* Reduction of military spending

==Elections==
Michael Perth contested the seat of Port Adelaide in the 1998 and in the 2001 federal elections, but polled less than 1% of the vote in both cases. Bob Briton contested the SA state seat of Lee in 2010 and polled 2.9% of the votes.

At the 2010 federal election the party endorsed a candidate for the House of Representatives seat of Sydney as part of the Communist Alliance. The party received 0.83% or 656 of the 79,377 votes cast. It also endorsed two candidates for the Senate in New South Wales, receiving 0.17% or 7,000 of the 4.3 million votes cast. The Australian Electoral Commission deregistered Communist Alliance successor name The Communists on 22 May 2012 due to the party failing to prove it had 500 members.

The Communist Party of Australia received its first electoral win with the election of Tony Oldfield in local government elections on 8 September 2012 to Auburn City Council, New South Wales.

The Communist Party of Australia planned to run candidates in the 2016 federal election, but their registration was rejected by the Australian Electoral Commission. In 2017 the party attempted to register under the name &quot;The Communists&quot;, but they were again rejected due to the party failing to prove it had at least 500 members.

<text>WDRV (97.1 FM, &quot;The Drive&quot;) is a commercial radio station licensed to serve Chicago, Illinois. The station is owned by Hubbard Broadcasting and airs a classic rock format. Its studios were originally located in the John Hancock Center. On May 11, 2018, WDRV moved into all new, state-of-the-art, digital studios in Chicago&#x27;s Prudential Plaza. WDRV&#x27;s antenna is located atop the Aon Center. The station&#x27;s programming is simulcast on sister station 96.9 WWDV in Zion, Illinois.

WDRV uses HD Radio and broadcasts a classic rock format branded as &quot;Deep Tracks&quot; on its HD2 subchannel.

==History==
===WNIB===
====Early history====
WNIB was founded and built by Bill Florian. The call letters stood for Northern Illinois Broadcasting. The station began broadcasting on July 9, 1955, and had the slogan &quot;Chicago&#x27;s FM Voice of Variety.&quot; It primarily broadcast jazz, show tunes, and easy listening music.

Bill Gershon was among the first announcers. Among the other announcers in the early years were Bill Plante, who went on to become a fixture at CBS News, Marty Robinson and Don Tait, both of whom later worked for WFMT, and Ken Alexander, who later worked for WAIT 820, but later returned to WNIB.

====Programming and personalities====
Gershon had the idea of playing classical music Sunday evenings and stated, &quot;Classical music wasn&#x27;t part of our programming at first, since most other FM stations aired lots of classical music, especially WFMT and WEFM. But I told Bill we should make use of the 12 records we had in the library. He said, &#x27;All right. Just don&#x27;t have any of that ivory-tower stuff here.&#x27;&quot; By early 1957 Gershon had left the station, but classical music&#x27;s presence at the station was expanded, though Florian said that it was a tough sell.

Sonia Atzeff, a graduate of Roosevelt University in Chicago, was hired as program director in 1958, and she steered WNIB&#x27;s programming toward a classical music format. As a classical station, WNIB would later be branded &quot;Classical 97&quot;. Sonia Atzeff and Bill Florian were married in 1967, and Sonia later became general manager of the station, a position she held until its sale in 2001.

Ron Ray began as a part-time announcer on WNIB in 1968. Working concurrently at 105.9 WXFM, Ray pre-recorded his announcements. In 1977, Ray began working full-time at WNIB as program director. Live classical hosts on WNIB over the years included Fred Heft, Jay Andres, Bruce Duffie, Carl Grapentine, Scott Thomas, and Obie Yadgar. Miller Peters was the station&#x27;s music director in its final years, and also served as a weekend host. Syndicated programs included &quot;Adventures in Good Music&quot; with Karl Haas, which aired Mon–Fri at 7 p.m.

While classical music was the station&#x27;s primary focus, for a period, brokered ethnic and religious programming aired in some late night hours. The brokered ethnic and religious programming were dropped in the 1980s.

Florian, a jazz aficionado, also hired Dick Buckley as a DJ for the station&#x27;s jazz programming. Neil Tesser also hosted a jazz program on WNIB from 1974 to 1976. Blues hosts included Mr. A. and Big Bill Collins.

&quot;Those Were the Days&quot;, a four-hour old-time radio program hosted by Chuck Schaden, aired on WNIB Saturdays from September 6, 1975, until February 10, 2001. Dick Lawrence hosted &quot;The Dick Lawrence Review&quot;, a weekly program on WNIB that featured nostalgic commentary and readings, along with vintage music.

====Facilities====
WNIB&#x27;s studios and transmitter were originally located at the Midwest Hotel, at Hamlin and Madison in West Garfield Park. Subsequent studio locations for WNIB included 108 N. State St., Riverside Plaza, 25 E. Chestnut St., 12 East Delaware Place, and finally 1140 W. Erie. In 1968, the station&#x27;s transmitter was moved to the Civic Opera Building. In 1976, WNIB&#x27;s antenna and transmitter were relocated to the top of the Standard Oil Building.

In 1983, the Florians purchased 96.9 WKZN in Zion, Illinois, for $1 million. The station&#x27;s call sign was changed to WNIZ, and it began simulcasting the programming of WNIB. The following year, WNIB&#x27;s ERP was increased from 850 watts to 8,400 watts. Its ratings grew significantly in the following years, and by the late 1980s it began to surpass 98.7 WFMT.

====Further history====
In 1969, WNIB began publishing a monthly program guide which listed all the music being played each day on the station. The inclusion of the label and record number enabled listeners to purchase things they enjoyed hearing, and the subscription price helped keep the station going during the leaner times. The covers at first had details of well-known artworks, and later had original sketches and caricatures by Richard Kimmel and Robert Kameczura.

When 99.5 WEFM was sold and abandoned its longtime classical music format in 1978, a portion of its classical music library was donated to WNIB as part of the settlement to permit the station&#x27;s sale.

WNIB was also famous for having dogs and cats in residence, which were audible at times during announcements. The animals were featured in local media, and listeners seemed to enjoy knowing that they were there.

In 1999, the media brokerage team of Bob Heymann and Jack Minkow began serious discussions with Bill and Sonia Florian regarding the possible value of WNIB (and WNIZ) in a sale to another Chicago radio station owner. After much deliberation, in 2000 the Florians listed the stations with Heymann and Minkow. There was significant interest from a number of broadcasters with Bonneville International in November 2000 ultimately making the best offer of $165,000,000 cash for the FM licenses, the WNIB transmitter lease at the Standard Oil Building, the studio lease for WNIZ in Zion, Illinois, and the WNIZ transmitter site and tower in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. With the proceeds of the sale, the Florians established the NIB Foundation, which awarded grants to music, dance, environmental, and animal rights causes.

After the completion of a final program on February 11, the station was turned off. The following day, new owners took the air with a different format.

Bill Florian died on December 7, 2016, of lung cancer at the age of 84.

===WDRV===
On February 12, 2001, 97.1 began to stunt with all day sets from artists such as Barbra Streisand, Garth Brooks, the Beach Boys, Madonna, Pink Floyd, and the Beatles, while its simulcast partner 96.9 WNIZ began simulcasting 101.9 WTMX. On March 15, 2001, the call sign was changed to WDRV, and the station adopted a classic hits format as &quot;The Drive&quot;. In 2003, 96.9 in Zion began simulcasting WDRV, and its call sign was changed to WWDV.

Over the years, The Drive&#x27;s format evolved into a broad-based classic rock format.

Bonneville announced the sale of WDRV and 16 other stations, to Hubbard Broadcasting on January 19, 2011. The sale was completed on April 29, 2011.

On June 27, 2011, WDRV celebrated its 10th anniversary by organizing a free-entrance concert at the Rosemont Theatre by America and headliner Jethro Tull.

Online streaming of the &quot;Deep Tracks&quot; programming broadcast on WDRV&#x27;s HD2 subchannel was discontinued in October 2013, due to its popularity. The high amount of traffic to the site made the stream too expensive to maintain, considering the cost of the service, royalty payments and lack of commercials to offset costs.

The station celebrated its 15th anniversary on Friday, May 20, 2016, with a concert at the Rosemont Theater featuring Boston and Jefferson Starship.

WDRV features &quot;The Sherman &amp; Tingle Show&quot; (Brian Sherman and Steve Tingle which debuted the morning of October 31, 2016.

On March 10, 2018, WDRV became Chicago&#x27;s only classic rock station when former rival WLUP-FM was sold to Educational Media Foundation and became an affiliate of EMF&#x27;s Christian AC network K-Love.

==Signal note==
WDRV is short-spaced to sister station WWDV (licensed to serve Zion, Illinois) as they operate on adjacent channels and the cities they are licensed to serve are only 40 miles apart. The minimum distance between two Class B FM radio stations operating on adjacent channels according to current FCC rules is 105 miles. Both stations use directional antennas to reduce their signals toward each other.

<text>Soyuz TM-34 was the fourth Soyuz mission to the International Space Station (ISS). Soyuz TM-34 was launched by a Soyuz-U launch vehicle.

==Crew==
==Docking with ISS==
*Docked to ISS: April 27, 2002, 07:55 UTC (to nadir port of Zarya)
*Undocked from ISS: November 9, 2002, 20:44 UTC (from nadir port of Zarya)

==Mission highlights==
This was the 17th crewed mission to ISS.

Soyuz TM-34 was a Russian Soyuz TM passenger transportation craft that was launched by a Soyuz-U rocket from Baikonur at 06:26 UT on 25 April 2002. It carried two cosmonauts and a South African tourist, Mark Shuttleworth, to the International Space Station (ISS). Shuttleworth performed some biology experiments, as he carried a live rat and sheep stem cells. All three returned on Soyuz TM-33 after an eight-day mission.

Soyuz TM-34 was the final flight of the Soyuz-TM variant, due to its replacement by the upgraded Soyuz-TMA. It was also the last crewed vehicle to launch atop the Soyuz-U rocket, although the Soyuz-U continued to launch uncrewed vehicles until 2017.

<text>WWDV (96.9 FM) is a radio station in Zion, Illinois, known as &quot;The Drive&quot;. The station is currently owned by Hubbard Broadcasting, and is a full-time simulcast of Chicago-licensed WDRV (97.1 MHz), serving the Kenosha, Wisconsin–Waukegan, Illinois, area. &quot;The Drive&quot; programs a broad-based classic rock format.

==History==
===WAXO===
WAXO first signed on the air on November 4, 1962; the first voice heard was that of Paul Weyrich. The station&#x27;s effective radiated power then was 3,500 watts, broadcasting from a transmitter and tower at 6400 67th Street and studios in the Isermann Building at 616 56th Street in downtown Kenosha, Wisconsin. In 1966, WAXO built new AM/FM studios at the transmitter/tower location, and moved operations there. The building is now a medical facility, though the WAXO tower supports remain on the grounds.

WAXO was Kenosha&#x27;s second modern-day radio station after WLIP and was billed as &quot;The new voice of a new and greater Kenosha&quot;. WAXO&#x27;s first station manager was longtime broadcaster Roy Ambrose of Manitowoc, Wisconsin; Paul Weyrich was the first program director and Don Jensen was the first news director. Subsequent station managers included Richard Blaha and Darrell Gorr. In a late-1968 promotional stunt, WAXO announcer Gary Anderson held a record for constant on-air broadcast duties by performing an air shift of 96.9 hours.

Service Broadcasting Corporation owned WAXO between 1962 and June 14, 1969. Arnold Johnson was president, Dr. Robert Heller was executive vice-president, and John E. Malloy Esq. was secretary-treasurer.

The company had always intended to operate an AM radio station, and there was an available AM frequency allocation on 1500 kilohertz. However, there were competing interests for the AM license, most notably from neighboring Zion, Illinois, which had lost its 50,000–watt radio station in a 1930s fire. After lengthy testimony the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) decided to grant the AM 1500 license to the Zion-Benton Broadcasting Company of Zion (principals: Billie Bicket and family), and the station became WZBN, signing on the air on September 19, 1967. After that, Service Broadcasting decided to sell WAXO, and competition developed for the licensed 96.9 FM frequency from broadcasting interests in both Zion and Racine, Wisconsin. The owners of WZBN in Zion were the successful applicants, and paid $250,000 for WAXO. Within weeks a lightning strike destroyed the transmitter and WAXO&#x27;s new owners were granted permission for an increase in power to 10,000 watts horizontal and 8,100 watts vertical and a new antenna tower at Dexter&#x27;s Corner, Wisconsin.

===Typical WAXO programming===
* &quot;Sundial&quot; with Paul Weyrich
* &quot;The Mike is Yours&quot; with Larry Taylor
* &quot;Home Executive Club&quot; with Lida Hindley
* &quot;The Noon Report&quot; and &quot;Showtime&quot; with Don Jensen
* &quot;The Chuck Presley Show&quot; - Chuck Presley
* &quot;The Lou Rugani Show&quot; - Lou Rugani
* &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot; with Augie Gnorski (Gus Gnorski)
* &quot;Moondial&quot; with Jay Wells
* &quot;Passport to Italy&quot; with Mario Capponi
* &quot;Your Opinion Please&quot; with Roy Ambrose/Wayne Blackmon
* &quot;Sounds of Stereo (Chester Electronics)&quot; Gary Anderson/Dick Scott
* &quot;The Big Bands&quot; with Lew Strangberg
* &quot;Play By Play&quot; with Jim Wynne
* &quot;Invitation to Music&quot; with Wayne Blackmon
* &quot;The Frank Carmichael Show&quot; - Frank Carmichael
* &quot;The Hammond Organ Show&quot; with Lillian Crawford (and later, Lillian Gildenstern)

===WKZN===
By autumn of 1969 Zion-Benton Broadcasting had changed the call sign to WKZN (for &quot;Waukegan-Kenosha-Zion-Newport&quot;). The station&#x27;s on-air moniker was &quot;KZ97&quot;. The new ownership had ordered and installed a new Schafer automation system, then sold the three-year-old building and moved the WKZN studios to 2219 63rd Street in uptown Kenosha, which was built as a fire station. By 1971 WKZN was moved from Kenosha to combined WZBN/WKZN studios on the second floor of the Bicket Pharmacy (a former bank building constructed in 1909) at 2700 Sheridan Road in Zion. A second Schafer automation system was added for WZBN programming. In the early 1970s, music programming was the Adult Standards format which came from a broadcast music service on open-reel tape with PSAs and spots loaded into NAB Cartridge carousels. The AM and FM music playlists differed slightly, but the Bickets&#x27; main focus was on providing ample local news covering a beat from North Chicago, Illinois through Kenosha. News/sports/weather reports were simulcast.

===WNIZ===
In 1983, WKZN was sold to Northern Illinois Broadcasting, the owners of WNIB (97.1 FM), which had been experiencing interference problems from WKZN&#x27;s adjoining frequency. WKZN then became WNIZ-FM, and simulcast nearly all of WNIB&#x27;s programming until both stations were sold in 2000 for $158 million to Bonneville International.

On February 12, 2001, WNIB would begin stunting as a prelude to a change to classic hits as WDRV &quot;The Drive&quot; a month later, while WNIZ-FM became a simulcast of new sister station, WTMX. The call sign for 96.9 was changed to WTNX. This simulcast did very little for WTMX&#x27;s ratings, and management felt it would be more appropriate to be paired up with its neighbor at 97.1. On January 1, 2003, 96.9 became the north metro frequency for &quot;The Drive&quot;, and the call sign was changed to WWDV. &quot;The Drive&quot; would slowly evolve into a broad-based classic rock format.

Bonneville announced the sale of WWDV, as well as 16 other stations, to Hubbard Broadcasting on January 19, 2011. The sale was completed on April 29, 2011.

===HD radio===
In September 2006, WWDV&#x27;s HD 2 station signed on simulcasting with WDRV HD 2 featuring &quot;Deep Tracks&quot;.

It is often held in conjunction with the World Computer Speed Chess Championship and the Computer Olympiad, a collection of computer tournaments for other board games. Instead of using engine protocols, the games are played on physical boards by human operators.

The WCCC is open to all types of computers including microprocessors, supercomputers, clusters, and dedicated chess hardware.

Due to the requirement to be present on-site, play on a physical board, and strict rules of originality, many strong programs refrain from participating in the ICGA events. As the conditions of the software championship can easily be emulated by anyone with a high-end PC, there are now privately conducted tournaments, such as Top Chess Engine Championship, that have much broader attendance, as well as a larger number of games to reduce the influence of chance.

== Championship results ==
In 2007, the reigning champion Junior declined to defend its title. 

For the 2009 edition, the rules were changed to limit platforms to commodity hardware supporting at most eight cores, thereby excluding supercomputers and large clusters. However, this was reversed in the following year and a parallel Software Championship was held instead; unlimited hardware is once again allowed in the championship proper.

==World Chess Software Championship==
From 2010 a new tournament was introduced and held at the same location and during the same period as the World Computer Chess Championship. The rules for the World Chess Software Championship (WCSC) state that competing programs must run on machines with identical hardware specifications. Time control is game in 45 minutes with 15 second increment.

== World Microcomputer Chess Championship==

From 1980 to 2001, the ICCA/ICGA organized a separate cycle of championships limited to programs running on microprocessors. In the first three championships, the winners were dedicated chess computers, and then in 1984, Richard Lang&#x27;s Psion program shared first place, running on an IBM PC under MS-DOS.

At the 14th WMCCC in Jakarta, the Israeli team Junior was denied entry to Indonesia and some other teams dropped out in protest.

The 16th WMCCC was the same as the 9th WCCC above.

<doc id="851212" wikidata="Q7305024" url="?curid=851212" title="Red Shift (novel)">
<text>Red Shift is a 1973 fantasy novel by Alan Garner. It is set in Cheshire, England, in three time periods: Roman Britain, the English Civil War and the present.

==Plot introduction==
This is primarily a novel about adolescent despair, but one that uses devices of fantasy such as having events at different times in history influencing each other. It is said to be inspired by the legend of Tam Lin, where a man or boy kidnapped by fairies is rescued by his true love. The author said that a piece of graffiti seen at a railway station, &quot;Not really now not any more&quot;, became the focus of the novel&#x27;s mood, and it forms the last line of the story.

It took Garner six years to write. He provided three intertwined love stories, one set in the present, another during the English Civil War of the seventeenth century, and the third in the second century CE. Writer and folklorist Neil Philip referred to it as &quot;a complex book but not a complicated one: the bare lines of story and emotion stand clear&quot;. Academic specialist in children&#x27;s literature Maria Nikolajeva characterised &quot;Red Shift&quot; as &quot;a difficult book&quot; for an unprepared reader, identifying its main themes as those of &quot;loneliness and failure to communicate&quot;. Ultimately, she thought that repeated re-readings of the novel bring about the realisation that &quot;it is a perfectly realistic story with much more depth and psychologically more credible than the most so-called &quot;realistic&quot; juvenile novels.&quot; Emma Donoghue wrote that &quot;More than any orthodox work of historical fiction, it was this weird fantasy novel which taught me to look beyond the walls of my own era, my own reality. Garner makes the past numinous, terrifyingly real: anything but passed.&quot;

===Explanation of the title===
The title of the novel arises from the mind of the teenage character Tom. He talks of astronomy, cosmology and other subjects he is learning. He declares that he is too &quot;blue&quot;, i.e. sad, and needs a &quot;red shift&quot;. Since the cosmological red shift results from galaxies moving away from each other, this may be a metaphor for his need to get away from his current life.

There are multiple occurrences of the colour red in the story. After killing many in Barthomley, Macey&#x27;s skin is painted red by the tribal girl, using dye from alder bark. This marks him as a &quot;redman&quot;, one who has killed, possibly one who has done so under the influence of a god. It is also an ancient symbol of rebirth. In Civil War Barthomley, the stone axe head is wrapped in a petticoat which has been dyed with alder. A petticoat can also be called a &quot;shift&quot;. In modern-day Barthomley Tom notices some red colour on the rector&#x27;s undergarment – again a &quot;shift&quot;.

==Plot summary==

In Roman times, Macey is a soldier with a group of deserters. He has berserker fits in which he fights like ten men, using an old stone axe. Escaping from a local tribe, the &quot;Cats&quot; at Rudheath, the soldiers find a stockaded Cat village at Barthomley, which they pillage, killing the inhabitants except for a young girl, whom they take as a slave. They try to &quot;go tribal&quot;, pretending to be members of another tribe, the &quot;Mothers&quot;, and settle on Mow Cop. This is a sacred site to the Cats and the girl is their corn goddess. The Cats mine millstones on Mow Cop and bring food as offerings. The soldiers think they have engineered a truce, but the girl poisons their food and they have hallucinations, killing themselves. Only Macey is spared, as he never touched the girl, who was raped by the others. He and the girl leave together after he returns to Barthomley to bury the axe head in the burial mound, asking forgiveness for killing the villagers.

In the English Civil War, Thomas Rowley lives in Barthomley with his wife Margery. They find the stone axe head buried in a mound and call it a &quot;thunderstone&quot;, believing it to have been created by lightning striking the ground. They intend to build it into a chimney to guard against future strikes. The village is besieged by Royalist troops, who have fought in Ireland, searching for John Fowler, the village leader who has sided with Parliament. The troops eventually kill Fowler and other men of the village. Thomas and Margery are rescued by Thomas Venables, a villager serving with the Royalists who once desired Margery. He leads them to a shanty town settlement at Rudheath and tells them to go to his family on Mow Cop once Thomas has recovered from his wounds. They take the thunderstone with them and embed it in the chimney of their new home.

In the modern day Tom is a teenager living cooped up in a caravan at Rudheath with his parents. He is sustained by his relationship with his girlfriend Jan, who is leaving to become a student nurse in London. They agree to meet regularly in Crewe railway station. One day they follow an ancient path from Crewe to the village of Barthomley. Returning next time on bicycles, they go further to Mow Cop, a hill dominated by a folly tower. Here they find the stone axe head embedded in an old chimney. They decide to make it a symbol of their love. Tom and Jan have been avoiding sex, but Jan reveals that she had an affair while working as an au pair in Germany. After this, Tom becomes unstable. He insists on having sex but becomes even more self-destructive and unbalanced. He tells Jan that he has sold the axe head to a museum, as it was a valuable Neolithic artefact. Their relationship dissolves and they bid a final farewell as Jan&#x27;s train leaves for London.

Pieces of the three narratives are alternated in an inconsistent pattern, calling attention to their similarities beyond the landscape: themes, circumstances, visual descriptions and even lines of dialogue echo throughout.

==Characters in &quot;Red Shift&quot;==

===In modern days===
Tom and Jan are teenagers in love. Tom lives in a caravan park in Rudheath with his parents. His father is a sergeant major in the Army, but Tom&#x27;s mother refuses to live in the barracks. There is no privacy for Tom. He has to pretend not to hear the doings of his parents at night, especially after &quot;Mess night&quot;. Jan&#x27;s parents are doctors, possibly mental health specialists. They also leave Rudheath, removing one of Tom&#x27;s sanctuaries, as he used their house for studying, though his parents accuse the couple of using it for sex.

Tom is highly intelligent and knowledgeable. He quotes cosmology, poetry and Shakespeare constantly, mostly as a defence against the world around him. He is polite, almost florid in his speech with strangers, even as he can be curt and sardonic with those close to him. As the novel progresses he descends into mental breakdown.

Jan&#x27;s commitment to Tom comes partially from the rootlessness of her upbringing, moving from place to place as her parents work at different hospitals. Tom to her represents stability and, to some extent, so does the axe head. She calls it her &quot;Bunty&quot;, a &quot;real thing&quot;. When Tom gives the axe head away it removes that token of stability, even as Tom himself is becoming unstable.

Tom&#x27;s parents seem to be living in a different world. Tom&#x27;s mother does not like Jan, seeing her as a schemer who will derail Tom&#x27;s chance at an education, just another girl who will get pregnant, possibly by some other boy. Tom&#x27;s father is unable to communicate with his son, especially about sex. Both parents try to find refuge in an idealised family life, having Tom pose for pictures while pretending to cut his birthday cake. The family is constantly short of money.

===During the Civil War===

Thomas and Margery Rowley live in Barthomley. Thomas has epileptic fits in which he has visions of another person in turmoil, who may be Tom. The village regards John Fowler, the son of the rector, as their leader. He is charismatic, educated and has sided with the Parliamentary forces. He is wanted by the Royalists. He may also be a sociopath. He taunts Thomas about his fits, about Margery, and about their old rival Thomas Venables, a former villager, enemy of John Fowler and a rival to Thomas Rowley for Margery. Venables was born on Mow Cop, a place thought to be cursed. He is now a soldier with the Royalists. Thomas Rowley stands watches in the church tower but only stares at Mow Cop.

===In Roman times===
A group of Roman soldiers are on the run from the army, the local tribes and anybody else who might threaten them. They are led by Logan, their former cohort leader, who reminds them constantly that they are &quot;the Ninth&quot;, possibly meaning the lost Ninth Legion. Logan also complains that they are &quot;soldiers, not bricklayers&quot;; the last testified activity for the Ninth Legion in Britain is during the rebuilding in stone of the legionary fortress at York (Eboracum) in AD 107–8. Initially the other soldiers are Face, Magoo and Buzzard, along with Macey, who is subject to fits and berserker rages. In these states he fights like ten men but has strange visions, even claiming to be someone else, somewhere else while his body fights.

In some ways Logan reflects John Fowler. Both use others to benefit themselves. Macey is Logan&#x27;s weapon of choice – when there is killing to be done it is Logan who knows the &quot;Big Words&quot; that incite Macey&#x27;s fits. Logan also kills Buzzard for disobeying him, even though Buzzard is the best at scouting territory.

The girl-goddess-priestess sees all the soldiers as being lost from their tribes. This rootlessness echoes Tom and Jan&#x27;s failure to find a place to call their own.

===Accents and dialects===
As in his other works, Garner peppers his characters&#x27; speech with Cheshire dialect. The inhabitants of Civil War Barthomley speak the broadest version, and the dialect is heard least among the rootless modern-day characters. The Roman-era characters speak, in the case of the legionaries, an Englishman&#x27;s perception of contemporary military jargon of American GIs in the Vietnam War, and, for the rest, an English peppered with Cheshire dialect and pagan references. In attempting to &quot;go native&quot; Logan tries to master the differences between &quot;Cats&quot; speech and &quot;Mothers&quot; speech. Though the English language had not yet reached Britain, the differences in vocabulary suggest that the &quot;Mothers&quot; tribe speaks a Yorkshire dialect, e.g. calling a yard or enclosure a &quot;garth&quot;.

The name &quot;Cats&quot; for the Cheshire tribe may be an allusion to the Cheshire Cat popularised by Lewis Carroll, or a reference to the Catti tribes found in Germania. History and archaeology would place the area around Mow Cop on the frontier between the Cornovii and the Brigantes tribes. The etymology of Cornovii contains a reference to &#x27;horns&#x27; rather than &#x27;cats;&#x27; Garner may have employed the Celtic root *&quot;katu-&quot; (as in Catuvellauni) which meant &#x27;battle,&#x27; a reference to the warlike nature of the tribe. The linguistic connection between the Brigantes and the Celtic goddess Brigantia might suggest an origin for Garner&#x27;s &quot;Mothers.&quot;

==Major themes==
The stone axe head is one of two links between the stories. The characters Thomas Rowley and Macey also have shared visions of blue, silver and red. Macey seems to participate in the Civil War massacre while killing at the Barthomley stockade and, while on Mow Cop, he has visions of the folly tower. Tom in the modern day seems to be the source of the madness, although he too has intimations of contact with the other two. It is as if his tortured soul finds release in the savagery of the Roman times and the devotion of Thomas Rowley to his wife. After he and Jan are falsely accused of having sex in Jan&#x27;s house, Tom puts his hands through a glass window in his rage. The narrative immediately switches to Macey in the grip of a berserker rage, after which he tells Logan of seeing hands pressing towards him from far away.

Macey&#x27;s narrative is linked to silver and blue particularly. Garner uses the &quot;blue-silver&quot; livery of British Rail trains to pick this up. The television adaptation makes this prominent.

==Allusions==

On Christmas Eve 1643, during the English Civil War, Barthomley was the scene of a massacre. About 20 Parliamentary supporters had taken refuge in St Bertoline&#x27;s Church when Royalist forces under the command of Lord Byron started a fire. The Parliamentarians surrendered but twelve of them were then killed.

The site of Mow Cop is not particularly isolated as there is a village around the hilltop. The nearby A34 is a former Roman road. The Mow Cop Castle folly was built in 1754 to look like a ruined castle.

Rudheath is near Northwich. Approximately 2 miles (3.2 km) southeast of this is an area called Rudheath Woods, near the villages of Allostock and Goostrey. There is a caravan park outside Allostock, with nearby lakes, as described in the novel. Garner lives in Goostrey.

==Inspirations==
A 1975 lecture by Garner entitled &quot;Inner Time&quot; is concerned with engrams, experiences which remain in our subconscious and continue to affect us. Garner mentions repeatedly recounting a trauma to his psychiatrist to &quot;release&quot; it. The repetition of events over time is one of the main themes of &quot;Red Shift&quot;. Garner goes on to explain how memories form their own sequence, independent of chronology (hence &quot;inner time&quot;): &quot;any two intensely remembered experiences[...] will be emotionally contemporaneous, even though we know that the calendar separates them by years&quot;. He explains that this idea informs the structure of the novel.

As for the plot, in the same lecture Garner stated that &quot;Red Shift&quot; is an &quot;expression&quot; of &quot;the story of Tamlain&quot;, although critics have had some difficulty with the comparison. He also documents, in his introduction to the 2011 New York Review of Books edition, several unrelated bits of &quot;compost&quot; which inspired his novel. The first is the well-documented massacre at the parish church in Barthomley in 1643, the facts of which haunted Garner, a lifelong resident of the area, for some time. Next came a news article about a young couple; after a serious fight culminating in a break-up, the young man had given the woman a taped message in which he apologised but said if she did not care enough to listen to it within a week, he&#x27;d kill himself. She did not listen to the tape and he made good on his threat.

Later, Garner heard a local legend that Mow Cop was first settled by a community of escaped Spanish slaves who were being marched north to build a wall. Garner recognised this as a potential garbled reference to the famous lost Ninth Legion of Rome, also called &quot;The Spanish Legion&quot;. He believed that at the time the Legio IX Hispana disappeared, the emperor Hadrian had ordered the building of the stone barrier, Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. From this he concocted the idea that the Ninth had been sent to build the wall but some went AWOL on the way, settling on Mow Cop; the basic premise for the Rome-era portions of the novel. Garner explains that this scenario immediately brought to his mind the unrelated event of the Barthomley massacre, the first connection between different historical periods that informs &quot;Red Shift&quot;.

Finally, Garner saw some graffiti in a train station that said, in chalk, two lovers&#x27; names; beneath, however, was written in lipstick &quot;not really now not any more&quot;. Upon reading this, all of the above-mentioned bits came back to him in a flash, and he wrote the novel.

==Television adaptation and popular culture==
In 1978 the BBC produced Alan Garner&#x27;s own script adaptation of the story as an episode in the &quot;Play for Today&quot; series. Directed by John Mackenzie, the play was transmitted 17 January 1978. It was released on DVD by the British Film Institute in September 2014.

The novel, including the Vigenère cipher used in the novel, is the theme of &quot;Listener&quot; crossword 4340, &quot;Red Shift&quot;.

==Coded message==
The end papers of the book are covered with a coded message. In the story, Tom and Jan write letters to each other in ciphertext, using a method they find in works by Lewis Carroll. Although we are not told of Tom&#x27;s suggestion for a key, the message can be intuitively decoded and the code&#x27;s key can then be identified as being &quot;Tom&#x27;s a-cold&quot;, representing his isolation and loneliness. This is itself a quote from &quot;King Lear&quot; (Act III, Scene iv) and is a phrase which appears elsewhere in the book during shift sequences. The message in the end papers should be decoded using the key sequence &quot;TOMSACOLD&quot;.

The decoded message is:
:I love you. If you can read this you must care. Help me. I&#x27;m writing before we meet, because I know it&#x27;ll be the last. I&#x27;ll put the letter in your bag, so you&#x27;ll find it on the train afterwards. I&#x27;m sorry. It&#x27;s my fault. Everything&#x27;s clear, but it&#x27;s too late. I&#x27;ll be at Crewe next time. If you don&#x27;t come I&#x27;ll go to Barthomley. I love you. The smell of your hair will be in my face.

<text>New Internationalist (NI) is an international publisher and left-wing magazine based in Oxford, England, owned by a multi-stakeholder co-operative and run day to day as a worker-run co-operative with a non-hierarchical structure. Known for its strong editorial and environmental policies, and its bi-monthly independent magazine, it describes itself as existing to &quot;cover stories the mainstream media sidestep and provide alternative perspectives on today&#x27;s global critical issues.&quot; It covers social and environmental issues through its magazine, books and digital platforms.

&quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine has existed for more than 40 years and was the largest magazine of its type in circulation in the United Kingdom. It has won the Utne Independent Press Award for &quot;Best International Coverage&quot; eight times, most recently in 2013 and an Amnesty International UK Media Awards 2012 award in the consumer magazine category as well as being recognised by the United Nations for its &quot;outstanding contribution to world peace and development&quot;. 

In 2017, New Internationalist ran a Community Share Offer in which 3,409 people invested £704,114 to create a new multi-stakeholder [Co-operative] called New Internationalist Co-operative. In March of that year New Internationalist published the 500th issue of &quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine.

==Publisher==
&quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine is published by New Internationalist Publications Limited, a co-operative-run publisher based in Oxford, United Kingdom.

Originally, &quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine was co-sponsored by Oxfam, Christian Aid and the Cadbury and Rowntree trusts. The magazine is now funded through subscriptions, advertisements, and product sales.

New Internationalist has produced films, books and other materials for various United Nations agencies and related bodies concerned with world development. The book publisher Myriad Editions merged with New Internationalist in 2017.

New Internationalist runs a number of mail-order outlets for NGOs, charities and campaigning organisations. These include Amnesty International UK, Friends of the Earth UK and the Ethical Shop in the United Kingdom; and the New Internationalist North America shop in the United States of America and Canada.

==History==
===Origins===
&quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine was launched as a monthly magazine in 1973. Its forerunner was &quot;The Internationalist&quot;, sent to members of the student development organisation Third World First, since renamed People &amp; Planet.

It was set up with financial help from two UK NGOs, Oxfam and Christian Aid, who wanted to encourage more people to understand the processes of &quot;development&quot; by publishing a monthly magazine to discuss and debate development issues in an accessible way. They formed a new publishing company, Devopress, with a subvention of £50,000 for the period 1973–76. Devopress comprised three Christian Aid directors and three from Oxfam. The board took a lively interest in the editorial and marketing of the magazine, although the editorial line was independent.

Early issues of &quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine included a feature on the Tan-Zam railway in Tanzania, interviews with President Kaunda of Zambia and Bishop Helder Camara in Brazil, and features on Vietnam, drought in the Sahel, and the legacy of Che Guevara. It was an issue of &quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine, in August 1973, that first drew attention to the irresponsible marketing of baby milk in the Third World by multinational companies.

===1970s–1990s===
In the early 1970s, there was a significant public interest in the relationship between the West and developing countries highlighted by issues such as the Vietnam War, armed conflict during the decolonization of Africa, The &quot;Green Revolution&quot;, African Socialism, Cuban domestic and foreign policy under Fidel Castro and in Communist China under Mao Zedong, issues about trickle-down economics, etc.

&quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine published articles about all of these topics. It aimed to offer readers &quot;a radical analysis of rich-poor world relationships, looking critically at the effects of aid programmes, for example, and providing a refreshing alternative to the mainstream development and news channels, and mainstream media&quot;.

Its strapline at the time was &quot;the people, the ideas and the action in the fight for world development&quot;.

&quot;New Internationalist&quot; came close to bankruptcy when postal charges almost doubled in 1975. The publisher was rescued by funding from groups including Cadbury&#x27;s and Rowntree&#x27;s trusts, the Methodist church in the UK, Community Aid Abroad in Australia and Oxfam-Quebec in Canada..

In 1974 New Internationalist was commissioned by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to produce a kit of materials to mark World Population Year. In the following years New Internationalist produced press kits for the World Health Organization, the United Nations Environment Programme and the UN Children&#x27;s Fund and participated in BBC television&#x27;s Global Report series.

By the 1980s, marketing efforts focused on gaining subscriptions (in particular by Direct Debit) rather than on newsstand sales had resulted in a financially stable company. The organization was able purchase premises. 

In 1982, New Internationalist began publishing a One World Calendar, with a number of other organizations. In 1987, New Internationalist became an equal pay co-operative. In 1988 New Internationalist started a mail-order operation. 

In 1993, the magazine switched to full-colour printing and it was printed on recycled paper by 1999.

In the late 1990s New Internationalist set up its website newint.org, originally hosted by oneworld.org.

===Recent history===

In 2017, New Internationalist ran a Community Share Offer in which 3,409 people invested £704,114 to create a new multi-stakeholder Co-operative called New Internationalist Co-operative. 

In April 2017, &quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine had a circulation of 25,000, down from a peak of 75,000 at the turn of the millennium.

In September 2018, &quot;New Internationalist&quot; magazine was redesigned. Since then it has been published bimonthly, six times a year, with its size doubled to 84 pages.

New Internationalist publishes a range of books and calendars. In 2017, New Internationalist acquired the Brighton-based publisher Myriad Editions. New Internationalist also runs a mail order-business called Ethical Shop and has run Amnesty International UK&#x27;s mail order operation since 1999.

A second Community Share Offer was launched in 2021 in the wake of the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, with the slogan &quot;Save Our Stories&quot; and a target of £350,000.

===Organizational structure===

When New Internationalist started, the company operated as a conventional hierarchical organization, albeit with much sharing and teamwork. 

In 1976 a more co-operative approach was adopted and developed over the years so that, although legally it was a limited company owned by the original shareholders, Peter and Lesley Adamson, the &quot;NI&quot; operated as a collective, with decision-making shared by all members on an equal footing. 

In 1987 New Internationalist became an equal pay co-operative. 

Eventually the Adamsons transferred their ownership of the limited company, now called New Internationalist Publications Limited, to a trust called New Internationalist Trust. The trust was 2/3 controlled by the company&#x27;s employees who became trustees automatically while 1/3 of votes were held by co-opted Advisory trustees.

In 2018 the Trust was replaced by a multi-stakeholder co-operative, following a successful Community Share Offer.

===Editorial policy===

Several changes in the editorial approach of New Internationalist magazine have taken place since its founding. 

Although its left-wing, Libertarian socialist-leaning editorial line has remained broadly unchanged the approach has been modified over the years. &quot;New internationalist&quot; magazine nowadays is less Eurocentric and reflects broader concerns with environmental, gender and cultural angles in addition to social, economic and political ones. The magazine aims to reflect the views and concerns of its overseas subscribers as well as those in the UK. There is considerable emphasis on finding women contributors and writers and photographers from the South.

In its early days, a wide range of subjects were covered in each issue. In 1976 this changed and since then each month&#x27;s edition has been devoted to one particular subject (for example Islam or World Food) to give the reader a comprehensive guide and analysis. 

Some magazines are specially produced to tie in with campaigns. There have been issues on East Timor, Western Sahara, Cambodia, Burma, Fair trade (coffee, bananas and cocoa), homelessness, Jubilee 2000 and UN Sanctions on Iraq.

The use of the term &quot;Third World&quot;, more or less unknown when the magazine started, is debated now and discarded by some. Terms such as &quot;Majority World&quot; and &quot;Global South&quot; have become more widespread . &quot;Development&quot; and &quot;sustainable development&quot; similarly are contentious to some people but the magazine still uses them as useful shorthand phrases. Reflecting this change, the magazine altered its strapline, which read &quot;the people, the ideas, the action in the fight for global justice&quot; until 2018. 

In 2018 following a redesign of the magazine, the strapline was changed to &quot;The World Unspun&quot;.

<doc id="851215" wikidata="Q643179" url="?curid=851215" title="Video-in video-out">
<text>Video in video out (usually seen as the acronym VIVO), commonly pronounced ( VEE-voh), is a graphics port which enables some video cards to have bidirectional (input and output) analog video transfer through a mini-DIN connector, usually of the 9-pin variety, and a specialised splitter cable (which can sometimes also transfer analog audio).

VIVO was found on high-end ATI and NVIDIA computer video cards, sometimes labeled &quot;&quot;. VIVO on these graphics cards typically supports composite, component, and S-Video as outputs, and composite and S-Video as inputs. Many other video cards only support component and/or S-Video outputs to complement VGA or DVI, typically using a component breakout cable and an S-Video cable. While component-out operation supports high-definition resolutions, it does not support the HDCP standard which would be required for official HDTV support as set out by the EICTA. 
Some practical uses of VIVO include being able to display multimedia stored on a computer on a TV, and being able to connect a DVD player or video game console to a computer while continuing to allow viewing via a TV monitor. VIVO itself, however, can not decode broadcast signals from any source, and so, like HDTV sets without tuners and composite monitors, additional equipment is required to be able to show broadcast TV programs.

Some manufacturers enable their version of the VIVO port to also transfer sound.

== Limitations ==
The VIVO output on graphics cards is often not used by those who have no need to connect their computer to a TV. Also, there can be issues in software supporting the use of VIVO ports.

A computer using VIVO must have software that can handle an input signal. For example, in the case of Nvidia GeForce series 6 and 7 video card users this means downloading Nvidia&#x27;s WDM drivers. 

Additionally, On Windows XP computers that use GeForce video cards with Scalable Link Interface (SLI) mode enabled, using a TV to display part of the desktop via VIVO is disabled, just as dual-monitor mode is disabled. Confusingly, however, some distorted images may be visible on a properly-connected VIVO-driven television display at boot-up due to the fact that prior to the OS loading the display driver, the video bios might initialize outputs that are then unavailable once the OS takes over and the driver loads into SLI mode.

<text>Soyuz TM-31 was the first Soyuz spaceflight to dock with the International Space Station (ISS). The spacecraft carried the members of Expedition 1, the first long-duration ISS crew. It was launched from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan at 07:52 UT on October 31, 2000, by a Soyuz-U rocket.

The crew consisted of Russian cosmonauts Yuri Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev, and American William Shepherd. Gidzenko was commander of the flight up, but once aboard the station, Shepherd became commander of the long-duration mission Expedition 1. It is notable for beginning the continuous occupation of space from October 31, 2000 to the present.

<doc id="851221" wikidata="Q8023621" url="?curid=851221" title="Win Brockmeyer">
<text>Winfred Otto Brockmeyer (September 16, 1907 – March 14, 1980) was an American football coach from Mankato, Minnesota.

==Early life==
Brockmeyer was born in Mankato, Minnesota on September 16, 1907, the son of Otto and Margaret Brockmeyer. He attended the University of Minnesota where he played football under coaches Doc Spears and Fritz Crisler. He played halfback for the Gophers in a backfield that included Bronko Nagurski. His best college day came in 1928, when he gained 166 yards rushing and scored all the points in the Gophers&#x27; upset of Purdue. He ran 46 yards for one touchdown and passed for two more and Minnesota won 18-0.

==Career==
After his graduation from Minnesota, he played semi-pro ball with the Minnesota All-Stars. His greatest success was in coaching, and he gave up his player role to concentrate on coaching.

He started at Fergus Falls, Minnesota from 1931 to 1933, and at Faribault, Minnesota from 1933 to 1937. In 1937, he came to Wausau. In his 40 years of coaching high school football, his teams had a combined record of 265–43–14. His record at Wausau High was 230–33–9. Over those 34 seasons, his team either won outright or shared in 26 conference championships. &quot;For years he coached basketball, among other sports, and his basketball teams compiled a record of 128 wins against 88 losses, and won the state championship in his first year with the team.&quot;

Wausau High&#x27;s record in the early to mid-1940s was unequaled for many years. In 1939, Wausau won seven games and lost one, the last game they would lose for years. In 1940, they went undefeated and outscored their opponents 299 to 12, without giving up a single point until the final quarter of the final game of the year. In 1941, they went undefeated again, and then again in 1943 and 1945. They finally lost a game in 1946, their 46-game winning streak setting a Wisconsin high school record that lasted until 1987 when it was broken by Manitowoc Lincoln (48 straight games; 1984-1987) and later by Waunakee (48 games; 2009-2012). Brockmeyer&#x27;s winning percentage is .845, making him one of the winningest football coaches in Wisconsin history.

Both Football Hall of Famers Elroy Hirsch and Jim Otto played for him at Wausau High School. Brockmeyer is the only man ever to have coached two members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in high school. He also coached another Hall of Fame member, Bruce Smith the only man to win the Heisman Trophy (1941) from the University of Minnesota.

As coach at Wausau High School from 1937 to 1970, Brockmeyer had a 230-33-9 record. He was undefeated in 13 seasons. His teams won 26 conference titles. In the 1940s, he had a 72-2-4 record that included a 46-game winning streak. A scholarship was later inaugurated in his honor.

== Popular culture ==
In the 1954 movie &quot;Crazylegs,&quot; the story of Elroy Hirsch, Brockmeyer was played by Lloyd Nolan. It was the only Hollywood movie to ever premiere in Wausau.

== Recognition ==

* Wisconsin Football Coaches Hall of Fame (1980)
* National Federation of State High School Associations (1984). 
* National High School Athletic Coaches Association Hall of Fame (2004)

==Personal life==
He married Helen Mae Date on Thanksgiving Day 1932. They raised three children.

On March 14, 1980, Brockmeyer, 72, was on a golf outing in Florida with UW Athletic Director Elroy Hirsch and other members of the UW athletic staff when he was struck by an apparent heart attack and died. He and his wife were cremated and had their ashes scattered within Wausau.

<text>Jørgen Pedersen Gram (27 June 1850 – 29 April 1916) was a Danish actuary and mathematician who was born in Nustrup, Duchy of Schleswig, Denmark and died in Copenhagen, Denmark.

Important papers of his include &quot;On series expansions determined by the methods of least squares&quot;, and &quot;Investigations of the number of primes less than a given number&quot;. The mathematical method that bears his name, the Gram–Schmidt process, was first published in the former paper, in 1883.

For number theorists his main fame is the series for the Riemann zeta function (the leading function in Riemann&#x27;s exact prime-counting function). Instead of using a series of logarithmic integrals, Gram&#x27;s function uses logarithm powers and the zeta function of positive integers. It has recently been supplanted by a formula of Ramanujan that uses the Bernoulli numbers directly instead of the zeta function.

In control theory, the Gramian or Gram matrix is an important contribution named after him. The Controllability Gramian and Observability Gramian are both important in the analysis of the stability of control systems. The Gram matrix is also important in deep learning, where it is used to represent the distribution of features in style transfer.

Gram was the first mathematician to provide a systematic theory of the development of skew frequency curves, showing that the normal symmetric Gaussian error curve was but one special case of a more general class of frequency curves.

Gram&#x27;s theorem, the Gram–Charlier series, and Gram points are also named after him.

He died on his way to a meeting of the Royal Danish Academy after being struck by a cyclist.

<text>A league ( &quot;ayimaγ&quot; &quot;Aimag&quot;; historically, &quot;čiγulγan&quot; &quot;Qûûlgan&quot;; ) is a prefecture-level administrative unit of the autonomous region of Inner Mongolia in the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Leagues are the prefectures of Inner Mongolia. The name comes from a Mongolian administrative unit used during the Qing dynasty in Mongolia. Mongolian Banners (county level regions) were organized into conventional assemblies at the league level. During the Republic of China era, the leagues had a status equivalent to provinces. Leagues contain banners, equivalent to counties.

After the establishment of the provincial level Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in 1947, leagues of Inner Mongolia became equal to prefectures in other provinces and autonomous regions. The administrative commission () of the league is the administrative branch office dispatched by the People&#x27;s Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The leader of the league&#x27;s government, titled as league leader (), is appointed by People&#x27;s Government of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. So are deputy leaders of leagues. Instead of local level of People&#x27;s Congress, league&#x27;s working commissions of the Standing Committee of the People’s Congress of Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are detached and supervise the league&#x27;s governments, but can not elect or dismiss league&#x27;s government officials. In such a way, the &quot;league&#x27;s working committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region&#x27;s committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference&quot; is instead of league&#x27;s committee of CPPCC.

Leagues have existed since the Qing dynasty as a level of government. The head of a league was chosen from jasagh or sula of the banners belonging to it. The original six leagues were Jirem, Ju Ud, Jost, Xilingol, Ulanqab, and Ih Ju. More were added in the subsequent centuries.

Today, leagues belong to the prefecture level of the Chinese administrative hierarchy. Of the 9 leagues that existed in the late 1970s, 6 have now been reorganized into prefecture-level cities. There are only 3 leagues remaining in Inner Mongolia: Xilingol, Alxa, and Hinggan.

<text>Victor Luitpold Berger (February 28, 1860August 7, 1929) was an Austrian–American socialist politician and journalist who was a founding member of the Social Democratic Party of America and its successor, the Socialist Party of America. Born in the Austrian Empire (present-day Romania), Berger immigrated to the United States as a young man and became an important and influential socialist journalist in Wisconsin. He helped establish the so-called Sewer Socialist movement, but also sparked the American Socialist Party&#x27;s nativist turn. In 1910, he was elected as the first Socialist to the U.S. House of Representatives, representing a district in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

In 1919, Berger was convicted of violating the Espionage Act of 1917 for publicizing his anti-interventionist views and as a result was denied the seat to which he had been twice elected in the House of Representatives. The verdict was eventually overturned by the Supreme Court in 1921 in &quot;Berger v. United States&quot;, and Berger was elected to three successive terms in the 1920s.

==Early years==
Berger was born into a Jewish family on February 28, 1860, in Niederrehbach, Austrian Empire (modern Romania). He was the son of Julia and Ignatz Berger. He attended the Gymnasium at Leutschau (today in Slovakia), and the major universities of Budapest and Vienna. In 1878, he immigrated to the United States with his parents, settling near Bridgeport, Connecticut.

Berger&#x27;s wife, Meta, later claimed that Berger had left Austria-Hungary to avoid conscription into the military.

In 1881, Berger settled in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, home to a large population of German Americans and a very active labor movement. Berger joined the Socialist Labor Party (then headed by Daniel de Leon). In 1892, Berger became the editor of &quot;Milwaukee Arbeiter-Zeitung&quot;, and changed its name to &quot;Vorwärts !&quot; He also served as editor of another paper: &quot;Die Wahrheit&quot; [&quot;The Truth&quot;]. Berger taught German in the public school system. His future father-in-law was the school commissioner.

In 1897, he married a former student, Meta Schlichting, an active socialist organizer in Milwaukee. For many years, she was a member of the University of Wisconsin Board of Regents. The couple raised two daughters, Doris (who later went on to write television shows such as &quot;General Hospital&quot;, with her husband Frank) and Elsa, speaking only German in the home. The parents were strongly oriented to European culture.

==Socialist organizing==
Berger was credited by trade union leader Eugene V. Debs for having won him over to the cause of socialism. Jailed for six months for violating a federal anti-strike injunction in the 1894 strike of the American Railway Union, Debs turned to reading:

Books and pamphlets and letters from socialists came by every mail and I began to read and think and dissect the anatomy of the system in which workingmen, however organized, could be shattered and battered and splintered on a single stroke [...] It was at this time, when the first glimmerings of socialism were beginning to penetrate, that Victor L. Berger — and I have loved him ever since — came to Woodstock [prison], as if a providential instrument, and delivered the first impassioned message of socialism I had ever heard — the very first to set the wires humming in my system. As a souvenir of that visit there is in my library a volume of &quot;Capital&quot; by Karl Marx, inscribed with the compliments of Victor L. Berger, which I cherish as a token of priceless value.

In 1896, Berger was a delegate to the People&#x27;s Party Convention in St. Louis.

Berger was short and stocky, with a studious demeanor, and had both a self-deprecating sense of humor and a volatile temper. Although loyal to friends, he was strongly opinionated and intolerant of dissenting views. His ideological sparring partner and comrade Morris Hillquit later recalled of Berger that
He was sublimely egotistical, but somehow his egotism did not smack of conceit and was not offensive. It was the expression of deep and naive faith in himself, and this unshakable faith was one of the mainsprings of his power over men.


Berger was a founding member of the Social Democracy of America in 1897 and led the split of the &quot;political action&quot; faction of that organization to form the Social Democratic Party of America (SDP) in 1898. He was a member of the governing National Executive Committee of the SDP for its entire duration.

Berger was a founder of the Socialist Party of America in 1901 and played a critical role in the negotiations with an east coast dissident faction of the Socialist Labor Party in the establishment of this new political party. Berger was regarded as one of the party&#x27;s leading revisionist Marxists, an advocate of the trade union-oriented and incremental politics of Eduard Bernstein. He advocated the use of electoral politics to implement reforms and thus gradually build a collectivist society.

Relative to other contemporary socialist politicians, Berger was a racial conservative. He regularly fought Eugene V. Debs on the subject. Berger was terrified of Asian immigrants, who he believed would out-reproduce white Americans and further complicate the socialist movement&#x27;s cross-racial solidarity. Between 1907 and 1912, he masterminded racially-discriminatory immigration restrictions in the Socialist Party platform. His views on Jim Crow were only slightly more nuanced: while Berger wrote in a 1902 editorial that &quot;There can be no doubt that the negroes and mulattoes constitute a lower race — that the Caucasian and even the Mongolian have the start on them in civilization by many years,&quot; he does not appear to have believed that this justified &quot;the barbarous behavior of American whites towards the negroes&quot;. Instead, Berger argued that segregation was a symptom of an elite capture that left the American legal system indifferent to the poor of every race.

Berger was a man of the written word and back room negotiation, not a notable public speaker. He retained a heavy Austrian accent and had a voice which did not project well. As a rule he did not accept outdoor speaking engagements and was a poor campaigner, preferring one-on-one relationships to mass oratory. Berger was, however, a newspaper editorialist &quot;par excellence&quot;. Throughout his life he published and edited a number of different papers, including the German language &quot;Vorwärts!&quot; (&quot;Forward&quot;) (1892-1911), the &quot;Social-Democratic Herald&quot; (1901-1913), and the &quot;Milwaukee Leader&quot; (1911-1929).

==First term in Congress==

Berger first ran for public office in April 1904 when he campaigned for mayor of Milwaukee, coming in third place with 23% of the vote. That November, he ran for Congress in Wisconsin&#x27;s 5th congressional district and lost again, but came in second place with 28% of the vote. He finally won in 1910, becoming the first Socialist to serve in the United States Congress. In Congress, he focused on issues related to the District of Columbia and also more radical proposals, including eliminating the President&#x27;s veto, abolishing the Senate, and the social takeover of major industries. Berger gained national publicity for his old-age pension bill, the first of its kind introduced into Congress. Less than two weeks after the &quot;Titanic&quot; passenger ship disaster, Berger introduced a bill in Congress providing for the nationalization of the radio-wireless systems. A practical socialist, Berger argued that the wireless chaos which was one of the features of the &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster had demonstrated the need for a government-owned wireless system.

Although he did not win re-election in 1912, 1914 or 1916, he remained active in Wisconsin and Socialist Party politics. Berger was especially involved in the biggest party controversy of the pre-war years, the fight between the SP&#x27;s centrist &quot;regular&quot; bloc against the syndicalist left wing over the issue of &quot;sabotage&quot;. The bitter battle erupted in full force at the 1912 National Convention of the Socialist Party, to which Berger was again a delegate. At issue was language to be inserted into the party constitution which called for the expulsion of &quot;any member of the party who opposes political action or advocates crime, sabotage, or other methods of violence as a weapon of the working class to aid in its emancipation.&quot; The debate was vitriolic, with Berger, somewhat unsurprisingly, stating the matter in its most bellicose form:

The regulars won the day handily at the Indianapolis convention of 1912, with a successful recall of IWW leader &quot;Big Bill&quot; Haywood from the SP&#x27;s National Executive Committee and an exodus of disaffected left wingers following shortly thereafter. The remaining radicals in the party remembered bitterly Berger&#x27;s role in this affair and the ill feelings continued to fester until erupting anew at the end of the decade.

==World War I==
Although Berger&#x27;s views on World War I were complicated by the Socialist view and the difficulties surrounding his Austrian heritage, he supported his party&#x27;s stance against the war. When the United States entered the war and passed the Espionage Act of 1917, Berger&#x27;s continued opposition made him a target. He and four other Socialists were indicted under the Espionage Act in February 1918. The trial followed on December 9 of that year, and on February 20, 1919, Berger was convicted and sentenced to 20 years in federal prison.

During the 1918 United States Senate special election in Wisconsin, Berger ran for the seat despite being under federal indictment. His newspaper, the &quot;Milwaukee Leader&quot;, had printed a number of anti-war articles, leading the postal service to revoke the paper&#x27;s second-class mail privileges. Despite these circumstances, Berger won 26% of the vote statewide in an April special election to fill a Senate vacancy, including winning 11 counties, in a three-way race.

The espionage trial was presided over by Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Berger&#x27;s conviction was appealed and was ultimately overturned by the US Supreme Court on January 31, 1921, which found that Landis had improperly presided over the case after the filing of an affidavit of prejudice.

Even though Berger was under indictment, the voters of Milwaukee once again elected him to the House of Representatives in 1918. When he arrived in Washington to claim his seat, Congress formed a special committee to determine whether a convicted felon and war opponent should be seated as a member of Congress. On November 10, 1919, they concluded that he should not, and they declared the seat vacant, disqualifying him pursuant to Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Wisconsin promptly held a special election to fill the vacant seat. On December 19, 1919, they elected Berger a second time, and on January 10, 1920, the House again refused to seat him. The seat remained vacant until January 1921, after his previous electoral opponent, Republican William H. Stafford, once again prevailed over Berger in the 1920 general election.

==Second stint in Congress==

Berger defeated Stafford in 1922 and was reelected in 1924 and 1926. In those terms, he dealt with Constitutional changes, a proposed old-age pension, unemployment insurance, and public housing. He also supported the diplomatic recognition of the Soviet Union and the revision of the Treaty of Versailles. After his defeat by Stafford in 1928, he returned to Milwaukee and resumed his career as a newspaper editor. He became national chairman of the Socialist Party upon the death of Eugene V. Debs in 1926, holding the office until his own death in 1929.

==Death==
On July 16, 1929, while crossing the street outside his newspaper office, Berger was struck by a streetcar travelling on North Third Street (now Dr. Martin Luther King Drive) at the intersection with West Clarke Street in Milwaukee. The accident fractured his skull, and he died of his injuries on August 7, 1929. Prior to burial at Forest Home Cemetery his body lay in state at City Hall. 75,000 residents of the city came to pay their respect.

==Legacy==
According to historian Sally Miller:
:Berger built the most successful socialist machine ever to dominate an American city...[He] concentrated on national politics...to become one of the most powerful voices in the reformist wing of the national Socialist party. His commitment to democratic values and the non-violent socialization of the American system led the party away from revolutionary Marxist dogma. He shaped the party into force which, while struggling against its own left wing, symbolize participation in the political order to attain social reforms... In the party schism of 1919, Berger opposed allegiance to the emergent Soviet system. His shrunken party echoed his preference for peaceful, democratic, and gradual transformation to socialism.

Berger&#x27;s papers are housed at the Wisconsin Historical Society, with smaller numbers of items dispersed to other locations.
The complete run of the &quot;Milwaukee Leader&quot; exists on microfilm published by the Wisconsin Historical Society and on site at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.

==Works==
Victor Berger&#x27;s writing was voluminous, but rarely reproduced in book or pamphlet form outside of the newspapers in which it first appeared. In 1912, the Social-Democratic Publishing Co published a collection of his works in a publication entitled &quot;Berger&#x27;s Broadsides.&quot; In 1929, the Milwaukee Leader published the &quot;Voice and Pen of Victor L. Berger: Congressional Speeches and Editorials (1860–1929)&quot; which also included an obituary. This publication included Berger&#x27;s phrase regarding draining the swamp in reference to his assertion that the economic crises such as the Panic of 1893, were &quot;hastened&#x27; by excessive profits—the $900,000,000 to Standard Oil &quot;magnates&quot;. According to Daniel Yergin in his Pulitzer Prize-winning &quot;The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power&quot; (1990), at the time the general public considered the Standard Oil conglomerate which was controlled by a small group of directors to be &quot;all-pervasive&quot; and &quot;completely unaccountable&quot;.

<doc id="851240" wikidata="Q806869" url="?curid=851240" title="Banners of Inner Mongolia">
<text>A banner (; ) is an administrative division of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region in China, equivalent to a county-level administrative division.

Banners were first used during the Qing dynasty, which organized the Mongols into banners, except those who belonged to the Eight Banners. Each banner had sums as nominal subdivisions. In Inner Mongolia, several banners made up a league. In the rest, including Outer Mongolia, northern Xinjiang, and Qinghai, Aimag (Аймаг) was the largest administrative division. While it restricted the Mongols from crossing banner borders, the dynasty protected Mongolia from population pressure from China proper. After the Mongolian People&#x27;s Revolution, the banners of Outer Mongolia were abolished in 1923.

There were 49 banners and 24 tribes in Inner Mongolia during the Republic of China.

Today, banners are a county-level division in the Chinese administrative hierarchy. There are 52 in total, including 3 autonomous banners.

<text>Paul Harold Westerberg (born December 31, 1959) is an American musician, best known as the lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter for the Replacements. Following the breakup of the Replacements, Westerberg launched a solo career that saw him release three albums on two major record labels.

Following the release of his third solo album, Westerberg has been mostly releasing music that he has self-produced and recorded in his basement home studio. He has also released two albums and an EP under the pseudonym Grandpaboy. In 2017, Westerberg released songs on SoundCloud as User 964848511 and on Bandcamp as Dry Wood Garage.

== Career ==

===The Replacements===

In the late 1970s, Westerberg was working as a janitor for U.S. Senator David Durenberger, and one day while walking home from work, he heard a band practicing Yes&#x27;s &quot;Roundabout&quot; in a basement. He talked his way into the band by convincing the singer that the other band members — Bob Stinson, Chris Mars and Tommy Stinson — were going to fire the singer. The singer quit, and Westerberg joined the group. The band was originally called the Impediments, and they played their first gig in the basement of a church, playing to members of a nearby halfway house who did not appreciate their drunken shenanigans. They soon changed their name to the Replacements after several venues declined to advertise the band under their original name.

The Replacements began performing in the Twin Cities punk scene, showcasing Westerberg&#x27;s songs in a classic rock–friendly punk style. The band made three albums and an EP for local label Twin/Tone before signing to Sire Records in 1985. They made four albums for Sire, each with a different lineup.

Despite the jump to Sire, the Replacements never translated their critical success into commercial sales. The band broke up in 1991. Their final album, &quot;All Shook Down&quot;, was mainly a Westerberg solo project; there were a number of guest performers and the other three members of the band (including Slim Dunlap, who had replaced Bob Stinson three years earlier to tour in support of &quot;Pleased to Meet Me&quot;), made minimal contributions. Mars left the band soon after the album was released. After touring for the album (which was critically well-received) with replacement Replacements, Westerberg and bassist Tommy Stinson went their separate ways.

The Replacements reunited in 2012, playing several dates at Riot Fest in 2013 and the Coachella Music Festival in 2014. The Replacements once again disbanded in 2015. 

===Solo work===
Westerberg&#x27;s first solo releases were two songs, &quot;Waiting for Somebody&quot; and &quot;Dyslexic Heart&quot;, for the to the 1992 Cameron Crowe film &quot;Singles&quot;, for which he is also credited with composing and performing the score. The following year, Reprise Records released his first solo album, &quot;14 Songs&quot;. Even though the Replacements had been banned for life from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; after a notoriously chaotic 1986 performance, Westerberg was invited back in 1993 as a solo artist while touring in support of the album. Ironically, one of his two featured songs on SNL was the Replacements tune &quot;Can&#x27;t Hardly Wait.&quot;

During the interim between solo albums, Westerberg&#x27;s songs appeared on &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (&quot;A Star Is Bored&quot;) and &quot;Friends&quot; (his cover of Jonathan Edwards&#x27; &quot;Sunshine&quot; and &quot;Stain Yer Blood&quot;) television soundtracks, in 1994 and 1995 respectively.

Westerberg co-wrote the song &quot;Backlash&quot; with Joan Jett for her 1991 album &quot;Notorious&quot; and played guitar with her on the song&#x27;s video. He also recorded a duet with Jett (&quot;Let&#x27;s Do It&quot;) for the &quot;Tank Girl&quot; soundtrack (1994).

In 1996, he released his second solo album, titled &quot;Eventually.&quot; which was tepidly received by critics and had modest sales. It yielded the alternative radio hit &quot;Love Untold.&quot; Westerberg parted ways with Reprise Records, and the following year chose to release songs that were more blues-influenced and less slickly produced under the name Grandpaboy. An EP and single were released by indie label Soundproof/Monolyth Records. His third album, &quot;Suicaine Gratifaction&quot;, is a piano-driven, melancholy, and highly personal work that was released on Capitol Records in 1999. The label was undergoing reorganization and the album was given minimal promotion. Westerberg appeared on a fifth-season episode of &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; (entitled &quot;Larry&#x27;s New Love&quot;) performing &quot;Ain&#x27;t Got Me&quot; from &quot;Eventually&quot;. The episode first aired on February 26, 1997. Westerberg also performed the song that same year on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; hosted by Jay Leno.

Westerberg quit the major-label circuit for three years before staging a comeback in 2002. With new management and a new independent label, Vagrant Records, he released two records simultaneously, &quot;Stereo&quot; and &quot;Mono&quot; (&quot;Mono&quot; being released under his alter ego Grandpaboy). &quot;Stereo&quot; and &quot;Mono&quot; were recorded in Westerberg&#x27;s basement studio. Westerberg became increasingly prolific, releasing &quot;Dead Man Shake&quot; (as Grandpaboy), &quot;Come Feel Me Tremble&quot;, and &quot;Folker&quot; all within the next two years.

Westerberg contributed a cover of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; for the 2002 soundtrack to the 2001 film &quot;I Am Sam&quot;. Additionally, &quot;Lookin&#x27; Up in Heaven&quot; appears on the Starbucks sampler &quot;Hear Music, Vol. 10: Reveal,&quot; &quot;Outta My System&quot; can be found on &quot;Hot Stove, Cool Music, Vol. 1,&quot; and the Vagrant Records sampler &quot;Another Year on the Streets, Vol. 3&quot; features &quot;As Far As I Know.&quot; All three compilations were released in 2004.

In December 2005, Westerberg reconvened with Tommy Stinson and Chris Mars to record two new songs for the Replacements&#x27; compilation titled &quot;Don&#x27;t You Know Who I Think I Was?&quot;, which was released in 2006.

In 2006, Westerberg wrote eight original songs for the animated film &quot;Open Season.&quot; Two of the songs were covered by other artists. The track &quot;Wild As I Wanna Be&quot; is performed by Deathray, whereas Pete Yorn performs &quot;I Belong (Reprise).&quot; In addition, Tommy Stinson is featured playing bass on the songs &quot;Love You in the Fall&quot; and &quot;Right to Arm Bears.&quot; The soundtrack also includes the song &quot;Good Day&quot; from Westerberg&#x27;s solo album &quot;Eventually&quot;.

After he was seen on stage playing a First Act production model guitar, Westerberg collaborated with the Boston-based guitar manufacturer in September 2006 to create his signature edition PW580 with a red plaid pickguard.

On July 21, 2008, Westerberg released an album with 49 minutes&#x27; worth of music for 49 cents. The album, &quot;49:00... Of Your Time/Life&quot;, was taken down from Amazon.com and TuneCore store a few weeks later. In its place, Westerberg released a song titled &quot;5:05&quot; (a reference to the fact that &quot;49:00&quot; was really 43:55 long, 5:05 shorter than 49:00). From the lyrical content of &quot;5:05,&quot; it is believed that &quot;49:00&quot; was recalled because of copyright issues in the ending cover medley.

On August 27, 2008, Westerberg released two new songs, &quot;3oclockreep&quot; and &quot;Finally Here Once&quot;, on TuneCore. On September 13, 2008, another new song, &quot;Bored of Edukation,&quot; was released as an MP3 download on Amazon.com. On December 24, 2008, Westerberg released three songs; &quot;Always in a Manger&quot;, the folk music standard &quot;Streets of Laredo&quot;, and &quot;D.G.T.&quot; on tunecore.com for $0.74. On September 22, 2009, Westerberg released an EP titled &quot;PW &amp; The Ghost Gloves Cat Wing Joy Boys&quot; with six songs: &quot;Ghost on the Canvas,&quot; &quot;Drop Them Gloves,&quot; &quot;Good as the Cat,&quot; &quot;Love on the Wing&quot;, &quot;Gimmie Little Joy&quot; and &quot;Dangerous Boys&quot;.

Following the March 2010 death of his chief musical influence Alex Chilton, Westerberg wrote a eulogy for Chilton that appeared in &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In May 2010, he played &quot;Dangerous Boys&quot; and &quot;Time Flies Tomorrow&quot; standing on the visitors&#x27; dugout at Target Field for the documentary &quot;40 Nights of Rock &amp; Roll&quot;. Westerberg appeared in the video for the title track of Glen Campbell&#x27;s 2011 farewell studio recording, a cover of &quot;Ghost on the Canvas&quot; (which Westerberg wrote in 2009). In the May 24, 2013 online version of &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; Measure for Measure feature, he set forth his songwriting creed, which privileges the virtues of inspiration and spontaneity over gradually developing and revising a song.

In 2014, a new Westerberg song,“How I Met Your Mother”, was played over the end credits of the series finale of the television show How I Met Your Mother (season 9). The song was later available through most major streaming services.

In late 2015, Westerberg announced that he had formed a new band called the I Don&#x27;t Cares with musician Juliana Hatfield. Their debut album, &quot;Wild Stab&quot;, was released in January 2016.

==Personal life==
Westerberg was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the son of Mary Louise (née Philipp) and Harold (&quot;Hal&quot;) Robert Westerberg (1918–2003), an employee of Cadillac-General Motors. He has four siblings: Anne, Julie, Phil, and Mary. He grew up Catholic.

He married his first wife, Lori Bizer, in 1987. After their divorce, he married former Zuzu&#x27;s Petals guitarist and author Laurie Lindeen on August 26, 2003. They divorced in 2014. Lindeen, who was described by First Avenue as &quot;a dominant force in the &#x27;80s and &#x27;90s female rock movement in Minneapolis,&quot; died in 2024.

He and Lindeen have a son, Johnny (born 1998), whose voice is likely on &quot;49:00&quot; and &quot;Whatever Makes You Happy&quot; from Westerberg&#x27;s solo album &quot;Suicaine Gratifaction.&quot; 

Westerberg severely injured his fretting hand in 2006 in an accident while trying to remove candle wax with a screwdriver, leaving his ring finger on his left hand numb. 

Westerberg resides in Edina, Minnesota, a suburb of Minneapolis. 

His younger sister, Mary Lucia, was a DJ at local radio station 89.3 The Current for many years. 

Westerberg has had problems with alcoholism but overcame his addiction in 1990. He has since resumed drinking occasionally in moderation.

==Honors and awards==
Westerberg has been honored with two stars on the outside mural of the Minneapolis nightclub First Avenue, recognizing performers that have played sold-out shows or have otherwise demonstrated a major contribution to the culture at the iconic venue. Westerberg and the Replacements each have a star on the mural, making Westerberg one of the few musicians to be honored with multiple stars. Receiving a star &quot;might be the most prestigious public honor an artist can receive in Minneapolis,&quot; according to journalist Steve Marsh.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked Westerberg at number 196 on its list of the 200 Greatest Singers of All Time.

<text>The Pegasus Dwarf Irregular Galaxy (also known as Peg DIG or the Pegasus Dwarf) is a dwarf irregular galaxy in the direction of the constellation Pegasus. It was discovered by A. G. Wilson in the 1950s. The Pegasus Dwarf is a companion of the Andromeda Galaxy in the Local Group.

==General information==

In 1975 Tully &amp; Fisher determined that it was part of the Local Group.
The metallicity and the related distance estimate has been subject to discussions in the scientific literature, with varying results; however, recently, by use of the tip of the red-giant branch, a distance within 10% error was achieved in 2000
and then improved to 3% in 2005.

==In popular culture==
The science fiction television series &quot;Stargate Atlantis&quot; takes place in the &quot;Pegasus galaxy&quot; and has shown images of an irregular galaxy. However, the franchise has not explicitly stated if it is the Irregular, Spheroidal, or an entirely fictional location, but since the series claimed the Pegasus galaxy to be 3 million light years away, it is likely the irregular one.

<text>John Phillip Preskill (born January 19, 1953) is an American theoretical physicist and the Richard P. Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics at the California Institute of Technology, where he is also the director of the Institute for Quantum Information and Matter.

Preskill is an active scientist in the field of quantum information science and quantum computation, and he is known for coining the term &quot;quantum supremacy&quot;
and that of &quot;noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)&quot; devices.

==Biography==
Preskill was born on January 19, 1953, in Highland Park, Illinois. He attended Highland Park High School, from where he graduated as class valedictorian in 1971. Preskill graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University with an A.B. in physics in 1975, completing his senior thesis, titled &quot;Broken symmetry of the Pseudoscalar Yukawa theory&quot;, under the supervision of Arthur S. Wightman.
Preskill received his Ph.D. in the same subject from Harvard University in 1980. His graduate adviser at Harvard was Steven Weinberg.

While still a graduate student, Preskill made a name for himself by publishing a paper on the cosmological production of superheavy magnetic monopoles in Grand Unified Theories. Since we do not observe any magnetic monopoles, this work pointed out serious flaws in the then current cosmological models, a problem which was later addressed by Alan Guth and others by proposing the idea of cosmic inflation.

After three years as a junior fellow of the Harvard Society of Fellows, Preskill became associate professor of theoretical physics at Caltech in 1983, rising to full professorship in 1990. Since 2000 he has been the director of the Institute for Quantum Information at Caltech. In recent years most of his work has been in mathematical issues related to quantum computation and quantum information theory. He is known for coining the term &quot;Quantum Supremacy&quot; in a 2012 paper.

Preskill has achieved some notoriety in the popular press as party to a number of bets involving fellow theoretical physicists Stephen Hawking and Kip Thorne. Hawking conceded the Thorne–Hawking–Preskill bet in 2004 and gave Preskill a copy of &quot;Total Baseball, The Ultimate Baseball Encyclopedia&quot;.

Preskill was elected as a Fellow of the American Physical Society in 1991 and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 2014.
