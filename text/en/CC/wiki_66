<text>, also called , , and , are Japanese emblems used to decorate and identify an individual, a family, or (more recently) an institution, municipality or business entity. While is an encompassing term that may refer to any such device, and refer specifically to emblems that are used to identify a family. An authoritative reference compiles Japan&#x27;s 241 general categories of based on structural resemblance (a single may belong to multiple categories), with 5,116 distinct individual . However, it is well acknowledged that there are a number of lost or obscure . Among , the officially used by the family is called . Over time, new have been created, such as , which is unofficially created by an individual, and , which is created by a woman after marriage by modifying part of her original family&#x27;s , so that by 2023 there will be a total of 20,000 to 25,000 .

The devices are similar to the badges and coats of arms in European heraldic tradition, which likewise are used to identify individuals and families. are often referred to as crests in Western literature, the crest being a European heraldic device similar to the in function. Japanese influenced Louis Vuitton&#x27;s monogram designs through Japonisme in Europe in the late 1800s.

==History==

 originated in the mid-Heian period () as a way to identify individuals and families among the nobility. They had a pecking order, and when passed each other on the road, the one with the lower status had to give way, and the was painted on the . The , an depicting the Heiji rebellion, shows painted on . Gradually, the nobility began to use on their own costumes, and the samurai class that emerged in the late Heian period and came to power in the Kamakura period (1185–1333) also began to use . By the 12th century, sources give a clear indication that heraldry had been implemented as a distinguishing feature, especially for use in battle. It is seen on flags, tents, and equipment. On the battlefield, served as army standards, even though this usage was not universal and uniquely designed army standards were just as common as -based standards (cf. , ).

Gradually, spread to the lower classes, and in the Muromachi period (1336–1573), merchants painted emblems on their shop signs, which became . In the Edo period (1603–1867), kabuki actors used , and the general public was allowed to choose and use their favorite . By the Genroku period (1680–1709) in the early Edo period, the use of was fully established among the general public. However, the use of the chrysanthemum used by the imperial family and the hollyhock used by the Tokugawa clan (Tokugawa shogunate) was prohibited. were also adapted by various organizations, such as merchant and artisan guilds, temples and shrines, theater troupes and even criminal gangs. In an illiterate society, they served as useful symbols for recognition.
Japanese traditional formal attire generally displays the of the wearer. Commoners without often used those of their patron or the organization they belonged to. In cases when none of those were available, they sometimes used one of the few which were seen as &quot;vulgar&quot;, or invented or adapted whatever they wished, passing it on to their descendants. It was not uncommon for shops, and therefore shop-owners, to develop to identify themselves.

Occasionally, patron clans granted the use of their to their retainers as a reward. Similar to the granting of the patron&#x27;s surnames, this was considered a very high honor. Alternatively, the patron clan may have added elements of its to that of its retainer, or chosen an entirely different for them.

==Design==
 motifs can be broadly classified into five categories: animals, plants, nature, buildings and vehicles, and tools and patterns, each with its own meaning. The most common animal motifs are the crane and the turtle, which, according to tradition, were symbols of longevity and were used to wish the family a long and prosperous life. Plant were symbols of wealth and elegance, so they were often used to wish for the improvement of the family&#x27;s social status and economic power, and motifs such as wisteria and paulownia were often used. depicting buildings, vehicles, or tools often indicated occupation or status. For example, a with a gate indicated a family associated with Shinto, a with a wheel indicated nobility, and a with a crowbar indicated a family associated with construction. The of nature was a symbol of respect for nature and prayers for a good harvest, and motifs such as the moon, mountains, and thunder were used.

The most commonly used motifs are wisteria, paulownia, hawk feathers, flowering quince, and creeping woodsorrel, which are called the . However, according to a dictionary of published by Shogakukan, oak is listed instead of paulownia. There are more than 150 types of wisteria , and their use by the Fujiwara clan led to their popularization.

Similar to the blazon in European heraldry, are also named by the content of the design, even though there is no set rule for such names. Unlike in European heraldry, however, this &quot;blazon&quot; is not prescriptive—the depiction of a does not follow the name—instead the names only serve to describe the . The pictorial depictions of the are not formalized and small variations of what is supposed to be the same can sometimes be seen, but the designs are for the most part standardized through time and tradition.

The degree of variation tolerated differ from to as well. For example, the paulownia crest with 5-7-5 leaves is reserved for the prime minister, whereas paulownia with fewer leaves could be used by anyone. The imperial chrysanthemum also specifies 16 petals, whereas chrysanthemum with fewer petals are used by other lesser imperial family members.

Japanese heraldry does not have a cadency or quartering system, but it is not uncommon for cadet branches of a family to choose a slightly different from the senior branch. Each princely family (), for example, uses a modified chrysanthemum crest as their . holders may also combine their with that of their patron, benefactor or spouse, sometimes creating increasingly complicated designs.

 are essentially monochrome; the color does not constitute part of the design and they may be drawn in any color.

==Modern usage==
Virtually all modern Japanese families have a , but unlike before the Meiji Restoration when rigid social divisions existed, play a more specialized role in everyday life. On occasions when the use of a is required, one can try to look up their families in the temple registries of their ancestral hometown or consult one of the many genealogical publications available. Many websites also offer lookup services. Professional wedding planners, undertakers and other &quot;ritual masters&quot; may also offer guidance on finding the proper .

 are seen widely on stores and shops engaged in traditional crafts and specialties. They are favored by sushi restaurants, which often incorporate a into their logos. designs can even be seen on the ceramic roof tiles of older houses. designs frequently decorate , , tofu and other packaging for food products to lend them an air of elegance, refinement and tradition. The paulownia appears on the obverse side of the 500 yen coin.

Items symbolizing family crafts, arts or professions were often chosen as a ; likewise, were, and still are, also passed down a lineage of artists. Geisha typically wear the of their (geisha house) on their clothing when working; individual geisha districts, known as , also have their own distinctive , such as the plover crest () of Ponto-chō in Kyoto.

A woman may still wear her maiden if she wishes and pass it on to her daughters; she does not have to adopt her husband&#x27;s or father&#x27;s . Flowers, trees, plants and birds are also common elements of designs.

 also add formality to a kimono. A kimono may have one, three or five . The themselves can be either formal or informal, depending on the formality of the kimono, with formality ranging from the most formal &#x27;full sun&#x27; () crests to the least formal &#x27;shadow&#x27; () crests. Very formal kimono display more , frequently in a manner that makes them more conspicuous; the most formal kimono display on both sides of the chest, on the back of each sleeve, and in the middle of the back. On the armor of a warrior, it might be found on the (helmet), on the (breast plate), and on flags and various other places. also adorned coffers, tents, fans and other items of importance.

As in the past, modern are not regulated by law, with the exception of the Imperial Chrysanthemum, which doubles as the national emblem, and the paulownia, which is the mon of the office of prime minister and also serves as the emblem of the cabinet and government (see national seals of Japan for further information). Some local governments and associations may use a as their logo or trademark, thus enjoying its traditional protection, but otherwise are not recognized by law. One of the best known examples of a serving as a corporate logo is that of Mitsubishi, a name meaning &#x27;three lozenges&#x27; (occasionally translated as &#x27;three buffalo nuts&#x27;), which are represented as rhombuses. Another example of corporate use is the logo for the famous soy sauce maker Kikkoman, which uses the family of the founder, and finally, the logo of music instrument/equipment and motorcycle builder Yamaha, which shows three tuning forks interlocked into the shape of a capital &#x27;Y&#x27; in reference to both their name and the origin of the company.

==In Western heraldry==
Japanese are sometimes used as charges or crests in Western heraldry. They are blazoned in traditional heraldic style rather than in the Japanese style. Examples include the swastika with arrows used by Japanese ambassador Hasekura Tsunenaga, the Canadian-granted arms of the Japanese-Canadian politician David Tsubouchi, and Akihito&#x27;s arms as a Knight of the Garter.

<text>Commercialism is the application of both manufacturing and consumption towards personal usage, or the practices, methods, aims, and distribution of products in a free market geared toward generating a profit. Commercialism can also refer, positively or negatively, to corporate domination. Commercialism is often closely associated with the corporate world and advertising, and often makes use of advancements in technology.

Commercialism can also be used in a negative connotation to refer to the possibility within open-market capitalism to exploit objects, people, or the environment for the purpose of private monetary gain. As such, the related term &quot;commercialized&quot; can be used in a negative fashion, implying that someone or something has been despoiled by commercial or monetary interests.

<doc id="863241" wikidata="Q797886" url="?curid=863241" title="Baby talk">
<text>Baby talk is a type of speech associated with an older person speaking to a child or infant. It is also called caretaker speech, infant-directed speech (IDS), child-directed speech (CDS), child-directed language (CDL), caregiver register, parentese, or motherese.

CDS is characterized by a &quot;sing song&quot; pattern of intonation that differentiates it from the more monotone style used with other adults e.g., CDS has higher and wider pitch, slower speech rate and shorter utterances. It can display vowel hyperarticulation (an increase in distance in the formant space of the peripheral vowels e.g., [i], [u], and [a]) and words tend to be shortened and simplified. There is evidence that the exaggerated pitch modifications are similar to the affectionate speech style employed when people speak to their pets (pet-directed speech). However, the hyperarticulation of vowels appears to be related to the propensity for the infant to learn language, as it is not exaggerated in speech to infants with hearing loss or to pets.

==Terminology ==
* The first documented use of the word &quot;baby-talk&quot;, according to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, was in 1836.
* &quot;Motherese&quot; and &quot;parentese&quot; are more precise terms than &quot;baby talk&quot;, and perhaps more amenable to computer searches, but are not the terms of choice among child development professionals. Critics of gender stereotyping also prefer &quot;parentese&quot; to the term &quot;motherese&quot;, because all caregivers use distinct speech patterns and vocabulary when talking to young children. &quot;Motherese&quot; can also refer to English spoken in a higher, gentler manner, which is otherwise correct English, as opposed to the non-standard, shortened word forms.
*&quot;Child-directed speech&quot; (&quot;CDS&quot;) is the term preferred by researchers, psychologists and child development professionals.
*&quot;Infant-directed speech&quot; (&quot;IDS&quot;) is also used. The terms are interchangeable.
*&quot;Caregiver language&quot; is sometimes used.

==Characteristics==
CDS is a clear and simplified strategy for communicating to younger children, used by adults and by older children. The vocabulary is limited, speech is slowed with a greater number of pauses, and the sentences are short and grammatically simplified, often repeated. Although CDS features marked auditory characteristics, other factors aid in development of language. Three types of modifications occur to adult-directed speech in the production of CDS:
* linguistic modifications, particularly prosody, including the simplification of speech units as well as the emphasis on various phonemes. 
* modifications to attention-gaining strategies, providing visual cues through body language, particularly movements of the face, to more effectively maintain the attention of their infants. 
* modifications to the interactions between parents and infants. Parents use CDS not only to promote language development but to foster a positive relationship with their infants.

The younger the child, the more exaggerated the adult&#x27;s CDS is. The attention of infants is held more readily by CDS over normal speech, as with adults. The more expressive CDS is, the more likely infants are to respond to this method of communication by adults.

A key visual aspect of CDS is the movement of the lips. One characteristic is the wider opening of the mouth present in those using CDS versus adult-directed speech, particularly in vowels. Research suggests that with the larger opening of the lips during CDS, infants are better able to grasp the message being conveyed due to the heightened visual cues.

Through this interaction, infants are able to determine who positive and encouraging caregivers will be in their development. When infants use CDS as a determinant of acceptable caregivers, their cognitive development seems to thrive because they are being encouraged by adults who are invested in the development of the given infants. Because the process is interactive, caregivers are able to make significant progress through the use of CDS.

==Purpose and implications==

===Use with infants===
Studies have shown that from birth, infants prefer to listen to CDS, which is more effective than regular speech in getting and holding an infant&#x27;s attention. 
Some researchers believe that CDS is an important part of the emotional bonding process between the parents and their child, and helps the infants learn the language. Researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Wisconsin found that using basic “baby talk” may support babies in picking up words faster. Infants pay more attention when parents use CDS, which has a slower and more repetitive tone than used in regular conversation.

CDS has been observed in languages other than English.

Purposes and benefits of CDS include supporting the ability of infants to bond with their caregivers.

Children that learn the fastest are those who receive the most acknowledgement and encouragement of what they say, are given time and attention to speak and share, and who are questioned. Infants are able to apply this to larger words and sentences as they learn to process language.

CDS aids infants in bonding to caregivers. Although infants have a range of social cues available to them regarding who will provide adequate care, CDS serves as an additional indicator as to which caregivers will provide developmental support. When adults engage in CDS with infants, they are providing positive emotion and attention, signaling to infants that they are valued.

CDS can also serve as a priming tool for infants to notice the faces of their caregivers. Infants are more sensitive to the pitch and emphasized qualities of this method. Therefore, when caregivers use CDS, they expand the possibility for their infants to observe and process facial expressions. This effect could in part be due to infants associating CDS with positive facial expressions such as smiling, being more likely to respond to CDS if they expect to receive a positive response from their caregiver.

CDS may promote processing of word forms, allowing infants to remember words when asked to recall them in the future. As words are repeated through CDS, infants begin to create mental representations of each word. As a result, infants who experience CDS are able to recall words more effectively than infants who do not.

Infants can pick up on the vocal cues of CDS and will often pattern their babbling after it.

Children of depressed mothers, who do not regularly use CDS, display delayed language development. Even when depressed mothers provide their infants with positive faces, infants do not respond to their attempts at CDS, and in turn do not benefit from this important route for language acquisition. Infants are unable to create the link between speech and visual face movements in situations such as these. When fathers who are not depressed are able to provide the stimulation of CDS, infants respond well and are able to compensate from the deficit left by their mothers. This too can inhibit language and speech development. Therefore, this deficit can be especially harmful to infants with depressed mothers and little contact with male caregivers. Socioeconomic status has been found to influence the development of vocabulary and language skills. Lower-status groups tend to be behind the development of children in higher-status families. This finding is thought to be due to the amount of time parents spend with the child and the ways they interact; mothers from higher-status groups are found to say more to their children, use more variety, and speak in longer sentences.

====Aid to cognitive development====
Shore and others believe that CDS contributes to mental development as it helps teach the child the basic function and structure of language. Studies have found that responding to an infant&#x27;s babble with meaningless babble aids the infant&#x27;s development; while the babble has no logical meaning, the verbal interaction demonstrates to the child the bidirectional nature of speech, and the importance of verbal feedback. Some experts advise that parents should not talk to young children solely in baby talk, but should integrate some normal adult speech as well. The high-pitched sound of CDS gives it special acoustic qualities which may appeal to the infant. CDS may aid a child in the acquisition and/or comprehension of language-particular rules which are otherwise unpredictable; an example is the reduction or avoidance of pronoun reversal errors. It has been also suggested that motherese is crucial for children to acquire the ability to ask questions.

===Use with non-infants===
The use of baby talk is not limited to interactions between adults and infants, as it may be used among adults, or by people to animals. In these instances, the outward style of the language may be that of baby talk, but is not considered actual &quot;parentese&quot;, as it serves a different linguistic function .

====Patronizing or derogatory baby talk====
Baby talk and imitations of it may be used by one non-infant to another as a form of verbal abuse, in which the talk is intended to infantilize the victim. This can occur during bullying, when the aggressor uses baby talk to assert that the victim is weak, cowardly, overemotional, or otherwise inferior.

====Flirtatious baby talk====
Baby talk may be used as a form of flirtation between sexual or romantic partners. In this instance, the baby talk may be an expression of tender intimacy, and may perhaps form part of affectionate sexual roleplaying in which one partner speaks and behaves childishly, while the other acts motherly or fatherly, responding in &quot;parentese&quot;. One or both partners might perform the child role. Terms of endearment, such as &quot;poppet&quot; (or, indicatively, &quot;baby&quot;), may be used for the same purpose in communication between the partners.

====Baby talk with pets====
Many people speak to their dogs as if they were another human being. These actions are not providing communication with the dog, but social interactions for the speaker, usually in order to solve some problem. The speaking style people use when talking to dogs is very similar to CDL and has been referred to as &quot;Doggerel&quot;. People tend to use sentences of around 11 words when talking to another adult; this is reduced to four words when speaking to a dog. People employ more imperatives or commands to a dog, but ask twice as many questions of the dog as of other humans, even though they do not expect the dog to answer. Recordings show that 90% of pet-talk is spoken mostly in the present tense because people talk to dogs about what is happening now rather than the past or the future, which is twice as much as with humans. Also, people are 20 times more likely to repeat or rephrase themselves to dogs than they do to humans.

A significant difference is that CDL contains many more sentences about specific bits of information, such as &quot;This cup is red,&quot; because they are intended to teach children about language and the environment. Pet-speech contains perhaps half the sentences of this form, as, rather than instructive, its primary purpose is as a social function for humans; whether the dog learns anything does not seem to be a major concern. However, dogs are capable of recognizing specific words and responding accordingly, which means that some information can be transmitted when a human talks to a dog.

As well as the raised vocal pitch, pet-speech strongly emphasizes intonations and emotional phrasing. There are diminutives such as &quot;walkie&quot; for &quot;walk&quot; and &quot;bathie&quot; for &quot;bath&quot;.

====Foreigner talk====

When addressing a listener not skilled in the speaker&#x27;s language, people may simplify their spoken language in an attempt to improve understanding. Some use gestures to communicate with others, especially if hearing is limited, although this is not always understood by people, as some gestures may be difficult to interpret by some people, especially as gestures have different meanings from place to place, so they may use a baby-talk–like language to communicate, leaving out small words and possibly using demonstratives instead of pronouns, for example &quot;Do not cross the road&quot; becoming &quot;No cross road&quot;. While this kind of simplification could be helpful for, say, foreign tourists, this type of communication is perceived as rude or offensive in some societies, because it may cause the foreigner to feel infantilized. It can also be considered insulting if the foreigner is skilled in the speaker&#x27;s language. While not considered to be actual parentese, it has aspects which make the two language styles similar.

==Universality and differences by region==
Researchers Bryant and Barrett (2007) have suggested (as have others before them, e.g., Fernald, 1992) that CDL exists universally across all cultures and is a species-specific adaptation. Other researchers contend that it is not universal among the world&#x27;s cultures, and argue that its role in helping children learn grammar has been overestimated, pointing out that in some societies (such as certain Samoan tribes), adults do not speak to their children at all until the children reach a certain age. Furthermore, even where baby-talk is used, it has many complicated grammatical constructions, and mispronounced or non-standard words.

Other evidence suggests that baby talk is not a universal phenomenon: for example Schieffelin &amp; Ochs (1983) describe the Kaluli tribe of Papua New Guinea who do not typically employ CDS. Language acquisition in Kaluli children was not found to be significantly impaired.

The extent to which caregivers rely on and use CDS differs based on cultural differences. Mothers in regions that display predominately introverted cultures are less likely to display a great deal of CDS, although it is still used. Further, the personality of each child experiencing CDS from a caregiver deeply impacts the extent to which a caregiver will use this method of communication.

CDS has been seen in languages such as Japanese, Italian, Mandarin, British English, American English, French, and German. This is the basis for claims that CDS is a necessary aspect of social development for children. Although found in many cultures, CDS is far from universal in terms of style and amount of use. A factor found to influence the way adults communicate with children is the way the culture views children. For example, if they view children as helpless and unable to understand, adults tend to interact with children less than if they believe that children are capable of learning and understanding. Often, cultures lacking a form of CDS make up for it in other ways, such as involving the children more in everyday activities, though the reverse might also be a valid assessment.

==Vocabulary and structure==

===Vocabulary===

With respect to English-speaking parents, it is well-established that Anglo-Saxon or Germanic words tend to predominate in informal speech registers, whereas Latinate vocabulary is usually reserved for more formal uses such as legal and scientific texts. Child-directed speech, an informal speech register, also tends to use Anglo-Saxon vocabulary. The speech of mothers to young children has a higher percentage of having native Anglo-Saxon verbs than speech addressed to adults. In particular, in parents’ CDS the clausal core is built in the most part by Anglo-Saxon verbs, namely, almost all tokens of the grammatical relations subject-verb, verb-direct object and verb-indirect object that young children are presented with, are constructed with native verbs. The Anglo-Saxon verb vocabulary consists of short verbs, but its grammar is relatively complex. Syntactic patterns specific to this sub-vocabulary in present-day English include periphrastic constructions for tense, aspect, questioning and negation, and phrasal lexemes functioning as complex predicates, all of which occur also in CDS.
As noted above, baby talk often involves shortening and simplifying words, with the possible addition of slurred words and nonverbal utterances, and can invoke a vocabulary of its own. Some utterances are invented by parents within a particular family unit, or are passed down from parent to parent over generations, while others are quite widely known and used within most families, such as &quot;wawa&quot; for water, &quot;num-num&quot; for a meal, &quot;ba-ba&quot; for bottle, or &quot;beddy-bye&quot; for bedtime, and are considered standard or traditional words, possibly differing in meaning from place to place.

Baby talk, language regardless, usually consists of a muddle of words, including names for family members, names for animals, eating and meals, bodily functions and genitals, sleeping, pain, possibly including important objects such as diaper, blanket, pacifier, bottle, etc., and may be sprinkled with nonverbal utterances, such as &quot;goo goo ga ga&quot;. The vocabulary of made-up words, such as those listed below, may be quite long with terms for a large number of things, rarely or possibly never using proper language, other times quite short, dominated by real words, all nouns. Most words invented by parents have meaning, although the nonverbal sounds are usually meaningless and just fit the speech together.

=== Diminutives ===

Standard adult English words can be derived into baby talk following certain rules of transformation. In English, adding a terminal sound, usually written ⟨ie⟩, ⟨y⟩, or ⟨ey⟩, is a common way of forming diminutives often used as part of baby talk. Many languages have similar mechanisms .

===Duplications===

Still other transformations, but not in all languages, include elongated vowels, such as &quot;kitty&quot; and &quot;kiiiitty&quot;, (emphasized ) meaning the same thing. While this is understood by English-speaking toddlers, it is not applicable with Dutch toddlers as they learn that elongated vowels reference different words.

<text>Service class people () were a class of free people in Russia in the 14th to the 17th centuries, obliged to perform military or administrative service on behalf of the state.

== Background ==
There were two main groups of service people:
* &quot;hereditary servitors&quot; &quot;(&quot;servitors by birth&quot;)&quot;, included boyars, noblemen and &quot;Boyars&#x27; children&quot;. They served in the &quot;Landed Army&quot;, and received land and serfs for their service.
* &quot;chosen servitors (&quot;servitors by contract&quot;),&quot; included streltsy, Cossacks and clerks. They served in the infantry or administration, and were paid in coin.
In early Siberia, service-men and &quot;promyshlenik&quot;s (promyshlenniki) were the two main classes of the Russian population. Service-men were nominally servants of the tsar, had certain legal rights and duties and could expect pay if they were lucky. &quot;Promyshlenik&quot;s were free men who made their living any way they could.

A minor group were sworn-men (&quot;tseloval&#x27;niki&quot;, literally [cross or bible] &#x27;kissers&#x27;). These men swore an oath and gained certain rights and duties.

In practice the groups blended into each other, and the distinction was most important when dealing with the government. When petitioning the tsar, a service-man would call himself &#x27;your slave&#x27; and a promyshlenik &#x27;your orphan&#x27;. These people were often called Cossacks, but only in the loose sense of being neither landowners nor peasants.

<text>:&quot;Men, written with the kanji (面) means &quot;face&quot; or &quot;helmet&quot;.&quot;

Men is one of the five strikes in kendo (along with &quot;tsuki&quot;, &quot;dō&quot;, &quot;hidari kote&quot; and &quot;migi kote&quot;). It is a long slashing stroke that falls on the centre-line of the head. &quot;Men&quot; also designates the movement, the target, and the part of the kendo armour that covers the whole head. The &quot;kiai&quot; for this strike, as for all strikes in kendo, is the name of the target area.

The &quot;men&quot; strike is executed as a &quot;vertical&quot; slash in numerous ways. The basic technique is to raise the &quot;shinai&quot; or sword such that it is forty-five degrees from the vertical behind the swordsman&#x27;s head, with the tip either directly above the &quot;tsuba&quot; or directly above the right point of the acromion (as viewed from the front), and the left hand exactly one fist from the forehead. From this position, power is given from the left hand to bring the sword down. At the point at which the shinai strikes the opponent, both right and left hands should be squeezed for a second which is called &quot;tenouchi&quot;, (手の内) also the right arm must be exactly parallel with the ground and at shoulder height. The shoulders should be relaxed. At the moment of the strike, both hands should flex inwards in a movement called &quot;shibori&quot;, (絞り) the Japanese verb for &quot;to wring out (a cloth)&quot;. This flexion should only be maintained for an instant. It serves to make the strike clean, fast, and bring the shinai off the target area such that a follow-up strike can be made with great ease.

Sa-yu men (左右面) strikes - or hidari (left, 左) and migi (right, 右) men, respectively - are variants on the men strike and are made at points either fifteen degrees to the left or right of centreline as drawn from the point between the eyes to the top of the head. This strike is made only with a subtle variation on the basic men technique. The tip is simply directed slightly more left or right as it is cocked back into the ready position.

Men is the first and most practiced strike in kendo. It is a favourable attack for those with a height advantage.

<text>Mtwara Region (&quot;Mkoa wa Mtwara&quot; in Swahili) is one of Tanzania&#x27;s 31 administrative regions, with its capital as the municipality of Mtwara. Mtwara Region is home to one of the most infuluential people in Tanzania, the Makonde. Mtwara is home to Tanzania&#x27;s 4th president Benjamin Mkapa and is home to a number of influential artists. The boundary with Mozambique to the south is formed by the Ruvuma River. To the west, Mtwara is bordered by Ruvuma Region, to the north by Lindi Region, and to the east is the Indian Ocean.

Mtwara Region is home for being the nation&#x27;s largest producer of Cashew nuts. According to the 2012 national census, the region had a population of 1,270,854, which was lower than the pre-census projection of 1,374,767. For 2002-2012, the region&#x27;s 1.2 percent average annual population growth rate was the 26th highest in the country. It was also the fourteenth most densely populated region with 76 people per square kilometer.

==Population==
The native peoples of the Mtwara Region are the Makonde, the Yao and the Makua. The Makonde are the dominant ethnic group in Mtwara Region and are native to east and central Mtwara, specifically in Mtwara-Mikindani District, Mtwara District, Newala, and Tandahimba districts. As of 1967, the Makonde made up 60% of the region. The second-largest group in terms of the territory is the Makua people, who are native to Nanyumbu and Masasi Districts. The Yao are native to parts of Tandahimba District. Since 1988, the region has been facing mass migration as younger people seek economic opportunities in Dar es Salaam creating a vibrant Makonde community in Temeke District of Dar es Dalaam especially in Mbagala, which is named after the Mbagala River located in Mtwara Region.

== History ==

The recorded history of the Mtwara region primarily centers on the Middle Ages town of Mikindani, situated to the north of Mtwara. Mikindani is recognized as a significant Swahili trading port, playing an essential role in maritime commerce along the East African coast. Its historical importance is linked to the broader context of trade and cultural exchange that characterized the Swahili coast.

==Colonial era==
=== Groundnut scheme during the British colonial occupation ===
In 1948, the British Government formulated the &quot;Tanganyika groundnut scheme&quot; through the Overseas Food Corporation (OFC). The purpose was to alleviate the worldwide shortage of vegetable oils. However, inadequate research and adverse environmental conditions due to poor planning resulted in the complete and disastrous failure of the scheme. In this region, the exported crop was to go through the port of Mtwara. This port was created for the scheme; it was linked to the growing areas near Nachingwea by a new railway.

Mtwara was part of Lindi Region until 1971.

==Geography==
Mtwara is both the most eastern and southern region in the country. The region is located between 10 and 11 degrees south of the Equator. Mtwara is the third smallest region after Dar es Salaam Region and Kilimanjaro Region at , only occupying about 1.9% of the country. In comparison, Mtwara is slightly smaller than the African nation of Eswatini at 17,230 square kilometers. Mtwara&#x27;s central area is of high elevation, home to the Makonde plateau with Mtwara Region&#x27;s highest point being Masasi peak at 837 meters above sea level. The largest and longest river in Mtwara Region is the Ruvuma River which is fed by the Mbangala River within the region as one of Ruvuma&#x27;s many tributaries.

===Climate===
The rainy season, which runs from November/December to April/May, has only one peak. The storm&#x27;s peak typically occurs in January, but may also occur in February or March. The overall amount of annual precipitation varies with altitude. Rainfall in the Mtwara district ranges from 935 mm to 1160 mm in the highlands and plateau. At Masasi Mission, the rainfall is 893 mm, whereas at Newala, it is 1001 mm. It also ranges between Mtopwa and Lukwika Mission, ranging from 1133 mm to 832 mm. Similarly, the highest monthly mean temperature at Mtwara on the seashore in December is 27 degrees Celsius, while the lowest monthly mean temperature is 23 degrees Celsius in July. In Mtwara, relative humidity ranges from 87 percent in March to 79 percent in October. Inland, temperatures and humidity are lower. 

===Geology===
Soils are determined by geology. There are two geological zones in the region, resulting in two geologically determined soil types. The first zone is the coastal sedimentary deposit, which stretches 31-125 kilometers from the Indian Ocean to the tip of Newala&#x27;s Makonde Plateau. Deep, well-drained, sandy soils with poor fertility and moisture holding capacity are produced in this zone. Sandstones are used to make them. Marine heavy clay soils, also known as vertisols, are found in some regions. Coastal limestones also provide red, well-drained soils with a thick texture.
The second zone extends west of the coastal sediments geologically. Gneisses and granulites make up this zone of pre-cambrian basement rocks. The soils in this basement are diverse. To the north of Masasi town, there are deep, well-drained red clays. These are the best soils in the area since they are most suited to the region&#x27;s upland crops. Course-grained sandy soils are common south of Masasi.

The region is separated into two sections in terms of topography. The coastal plain&#x27;s landforms are complicated. Second, at 300mm to 400mm, the Makonde Plateau dominates the basement plain. It&#x27;s mostly low-lying, with scattered rocky outcroppings and steep riverbanks.
The western part, which is beyond the Makonde Plateau, flows to the south via the Ruvuma River&#x27;s tributaries. The Makonde Plateau is drained by the Maombi and Mbuo rivers. 

==Economy==
Mtwara, like the rest of Tanzania, is mostly a farming community. Farming is the main source of income for the region&#x27;s residents. Agribusiness employs over 92 percent of the population, in addition to other rural activities such as fishing, beekeeping, and small-scale manufacturing. Arable land makes up about 85 percent of the region&#x27;s total area. However, only about a quarter of this is cultivated. The average farm size per rural home (169,482 households - 1988 Census) is projected to be 1.5 ha, with an average of 4.4 people.

Mechanization and oxenization of farms are still developing. In this area, the hand hoe is the most popular agricultural implement. Cassava, millet, and sorghum are all important food crops, with maize only recently gaining popularity. The most important cash crop in the area is cashew nuts, followed by groundnuts and sesame. Because livestock rearing is not a common practice among the people of the region, its economic contribution is negligible. The cashew nut crop, which accounts for about 25% of the region&#x27;s GDP, is one of Mtwara&#x27;s significant contributors. The Mtwara Region produces 40% of the country&#x27;s cashew nut production. Tanzanian cashew nut production is mostly for export and predictably, only a small portion of the yield is consumed. The Mtwara Region is officially recognized as the country&#x27;s leading cashew nut grower, producing roughly half of the country&#x27;s output. Newala district produces more over half of the region&#x27;s cashewnut harvest. Masasi comes in second with a 29 percent contribution, and Mtwara district comes in last with a 19 percent average contribution.

The mining industry in the region has a bright future. On a limited scale, 35 minerals have been discovered and mined. The Masasi District has been mining sapphire, christalbella, alexandrite, tourmaline, and rhodolite since 1995. 

===National Parks and Forest Reserves===
Mtwara Region is home to the Mnazi Bay-Ruvuma Estuary Marine Park that is one of the largest marine parks in the country. The marine park is a sanctuary for breeding Humpback whales. Forest reserves occupy about 8.33 percent of the region&#x27;s 1,672,000 ha of land. This area is 139,295 hectares. Masasi district has the greatest amount of forest cover in the region. The central government manages 130,545 hectares of forest reserves. This equates to 93.7 percent. District councils possess another 8,749 hectares, or 6.3 percent of total forest reserves. In total, there are 16 forest reserves in the region. The majority of them are located in the Masasi district. 

==Administrative divisions==
===Districts===
Mtwara Region is divided into two towns (Mtwara Municipal and Masasi Town) and seven districts, each administered by a council:

<doc id="863252" wikidata="Q2568066" url="?curid=863252" title="Captain Boomerang">
<text>Captain Boomerang is the name of two supervillains appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, who respectively serve as enemies to both the Barry Allen and Wally West versions of the Flash. Created by writer John Broome and artist Carmine Infantino, the first Captain Boomerang, George &quot;Digger&quot; Harkness, first appeared in &quot;The Flash&quot; #117 (December 1960). He has also been a prominent member of the Suicide Squad since its second iteration in the late 1980s. During the 2004 storyline &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, George Harkness is killed and his son, Owen Mercer, created by Brad Meltzer and Michael Turner, takes over his father&#x27;s role as Captain Boomerang for a period of time. However, during the 2009–2010 &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline, Owen is killed and Harkness returns to life, resuming his role as Captain Boomerang, and, overwhelmed by grief and rage, evolves as a dangerous threat after the loss of his son.

Both Harkness and Mercer have been adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including television series, feature films, and video games. In particular, Harkness appeared in the Arrowverse television series &quot;Arrow&quot;, portrayed by Nick E. Tarabay, and the DC Extended Universe films &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (2016) and &quot;The Suicide Squad&quot; (2021), portrayed by Jai Courtney. Additionally, Mercer appears in the Arrowverse series &quot;The Flash&quot;, portrayed by Richard Harmon.

==Publication history==
George &quot;Digger&quot; Harkness appeared in &quot;The Flash&quot; #117 (December 1960) and was created by writer John Broome and artist Carmine Infantino. Throughout the first several years of the character&#x27;s existence, Captain Boomerang spoke with an American accent. Beginning in the late 1980s, he developed an Australian accent.

Owen Mercer first appeared in &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; #2 (2004), and was created by Brad Meltzer and Rags Morales.

==Fictional character biographies==
===George &quot;Digger&quot; Harkness===

Secretly the illegitimate son of an American soldier and an Australian woman, Harkness was raised in an Australian town called Korumburra in poverty, during which time he developed great skill in making boomerangs, and in using them as weapons. As a young adult, he was hired as a performer and boomerang promoter by a toy company which was, unbeknownst to him, owned by his biological father. It was at this time that he developed the Captain Boomerang persona that he would continue to use in his later criminal career. Audiences ridiculed him, and a resentful Harkness turned to using his boomerangs for crime.

When he began committing crimes, he threw suspicion off himself by briefly pretending another man was impersonating him, showing his &#x27;parents&#x27;, (really other crooks) to the Flash after the Flash caught him next to a crime scene. He nearly succeeded in killing the Flash after knocking him out with a boomerang, then tying him to a giant boomerang that he fired, which then got sent into space and then fell into the ocean. However, the Flash escapes from his friction-proof bonds by quickly vibrating his molecules. He also increased the boomerang&#x27;s velocity so much he was able to use it to defeat and jail Harkness and the two crooks.

Boomerang becomes a recurring enemy of the Flash and joins the Rogues, a group of villains dedicated to opposing Flash. Later on, Harkness joins the Suicide Squad in exchange for a pardon. However, his grating personality and blatant racism cause considerable friction among his teammates, and he is considered to be a dangerous, vicious, cowardly and undependable member.

In &quot;Identity Crisis&quot;, Captain Boomerang is sent to kill Jack Drake, who kills him before dying. In &quot;Blackest Night&quot; and &quot;Brightest Day&quot;, Boomerang returns as a Black Lantern before the Life Entity fully resurrects him.
In &quot;The New 52&quot; continuity reboot, Captain Boomerang returns to the Suicide Squad. In &quot;Doomsday Clock&quot;, he is among the villains who meet with the Riddler to discuss the Superman Theory.

===Owen Mercer===

At the beginning of the 2004 &quot;Identity Crisis&quot; storyline, &quot;Digger&quot; Harkness a.k.a. Captain Boomerang found himself an obsolete villain in the modern world of supervillains. Regularly going up to the supervillain satellite looking for jobs, asking favors from the Calculator, he was at the end of his rope looking for a job to put him on the map again.

During this time he felt it was finally time to reach out to the son he never raised, Owen Mercer. Before Harkness&#x27;s death, the two bonded. Taking up his father&#x27;s legacy, he became the second Captain Boomerang. Captain Cold, brother to Golden Glider (who was believed to be Owen&#x27;s mother), took Owen in as one of the Rogues.

Though Owen initially had no real attachment to the Rogues (and even voiced various, albeit short, opinions out loud), he grew to enjoy the purpose and sense of family the team offered after finding that his father&#x27;s body had been stolen for use in a lab (which was later revealed to be part of a plan to get memories from Harkness).

Around this time the &quot;Rogue War&quot; storyline began, in which the &quot;reformed&quot; Rogues fought the Rogues under Captain Cold. Ashley Zolomon is told by Harkness himself (he is briefly revived by the &quot;reformed&quot; Rogues as part of an experiment) that Golden Glider is not Owen&#x27;s real mother. Later, it is revealed in &quot;Flash&quot; #225 (January 2006) that Meloni Thawne is the mother of Owen Harkness, formerly Owen Mercer, the new Captain Boomerang, having conceived him by the original Boomerang while he was trapped in the 30th Century. It is unknown whether she gave birth to Bart Allen or Owen first, or how Owen made it back to our own time.

During the 2005–2006 &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot; storyline, Owen was part of Alexander Luthor Jr.&#x27;s group of villains. He, Captain Cold, and Mirror Master were sent to guard a factory against the Outsiders, under the command of Deathstroke (who was actually Arsenal in disguise). When the ensuing battle between Outsiders and Rogues destroyed the machinery in the factory, the Rogues and other villains would not help in the fight at all and then at the explosion, he is saved by the Outsiders, while the Rogues left them at the base to blow up. He is then turned over to the authorities off-panel.

During the &quot;52&quot; series, Owen is part of a Suicide Squad sent by Amanda Waller to attack Black Adam.

In the 2006 &quot;One Year Later&quot; storyline, Owen finds himself placed in the metahuman prison known as Iron Heights. There he finds himself being the cellmate of Black Lightning, who was arrested for a murder that Deathstroke the Terminator committed. It is soon discovered that the other inmates have learned of Black Lightning&#x27;s identity and are planning to murder him. The Outsiders become aware of this and attempt to break Pierce out of jail. Unfortunately it goes terribly wrong. As they escape, Black Lightning asks that they take Owen with them, which they grudgingly agree. As they escape, the Outsiders&#x27; jet, the &quot;Pequod&quot;, is shot down, and while the team escapes, the world believes them dead.

Because of this event and the Freedom of Power Treaty, the team now works covertly. Most of the current Outsiders were believed dead until a botched mission revealed their presence to the world. His history as a Rogue has been exploited several times by team leader Nightwing from torturing dictators to taking down a cloned Jay Garrick. However, it is revealed that his desire to join the Outsiders comes from his desire for a family. Nightwing allowed him to join his team partially because Arsenal felt he would be worthy, and because Owen has been striving to find a family since the death of his father and the outbreak of the Rogue War.

Owen searched out the current Robin because of their connection, where their fathers killed one another. While Robin originally believed Owen was searching for him to finish the fight his father started, in &quot;Robin&quot; #152, Owen revealed that he wished to make amends with the younger hero, and has offered his assistance to help Robin destroy a bomb created by the Joker. The two later spend the following night spreading out old hideouts of several villains. Afterward, Robin gained a bit of civil respect for Boomerang despite what their fathers did to one another. Boomerang attempted to shake hands with Robin, but Robin refused the gesture feeling unready to make that step.

At some point during his tenure with the Outsiders, Captain Cold approached the mercenary Deathstroke with an offer concerning Owen. In exchange for kidnapping Deathstroke&#x27;s daughter Rose (who had betrayed her father and joined the Teen Titans) and delivering her to her father, Deathstroke would track down the Outsiders and turn Owen over to the Rogues. The villains planned to force Owen to cooperate with the team by administering the same mind-controlling agent that Deathstroke had used on his daughter as well as Batman&#x27;s partner Cassandra Cain. However, this plan fell apart when Rose escaped and helped the Teen Titans defeat the Rogues, which led to Deathstroke backing out of the deal.

Owen has also developed a close friendship with Supergirl, Kara Zor-El. After Supergirl returned from her time away with Power Girl, Kara began looking to start a normal life on Earth and went out a &#x27;date&#x27; with Owen, during which they spoke of their past problems. Kara has nicknamed Owen &#x27;Boomer&#x27;. Although the pair often flirts with one another, they have never progressed to a romantic relationship. This comes primarily from the fact that Kara continues to show interest in Nightwing, and jokingly says that what she and Owen has is more of a brother-sister relationship, in which he has an unhealthy fixation on his &#x27;little sis&#x27;.

Feeling rejected after Kara&#x27;s relationship with Power Boy, Owen goes to a bar where he meets Cassandra Cain (Batgirl), who at the time was being mind-controlled by Deathstroke the Terminator, and who had been hired to kill Supergirl. Cassandra kidnaps and tortures Owen to lure Supergirl. Unfortunately, this proves unnecessary, as Kara had tracked down Cassandra on her own, without any knowledge of Owen&#x27;s kidnapping. Batgirl nearly manages to defeat Supergirl, but is defeated when Kara grows Krypton Sunstones which impale her foe. Kara then rushes Owen to the hospital where he is treated. While still in medical care, it is discovered that Power Boy has been stalking Kara.

Following Kara&#x27;s rather violent break-up with Power Boy, the Earth was overtaken by spirits from the Phantom Zone, which began to emerge from within Superman. Kara managed to defeat the Phantoms and return the Earth to normal. Afterwards, in &quot;Supergirl&quot; #19 Kara begins to make amends with all the people who she has hurt since arriving on earth. Amongst them, Boomer, to whom she apologises for letting him get hurt and leading him on. During this conversation, the matter of Owen&#x27;s relationship with Kara is finally clarified. When asked by Kara how he feels about her leading him on, Owen replies, &quot;Well, if I may ... for me to have been &#x27;led on&#x27; would presume I thought I had a shot with you ... For me to think I had a shot with a sixteen-year-old girl -- crystal-powered hypersleep whatever junk aside ... that would mean I am a dirtbag with a thing for jailbait. Which I am not&quot;.

In &quot;Checkmate&quot; #13-15, crossover with &quot;Outsiders&quot; #47-49, Checkmate abducts all members of the Outsiders except Nightwing, allowing him to infiltrate their headquarters to offer them a deal: The Outsiders will not be shut down over their actions in Africa in exchange for infiltrating Oolong Island on behalf of Checkmate. During the operation, Nightwing, Owen, and Checkmate&#x27;s Black Queen are taken captive by Chang Tzu, and the latter two are tortured and experimented on. After Batman rescues the Outsiders over North Korean territory, and Nightwing hands over the team to him, Owen and Nightwing are paired with each other in &quot;auditions&quot; for the new lineup. Pushed too far, feeling he does not need to prove himself anymore, Owen returns to the Suicide Squad although Batman feels he could make a good double agent.

In &quot;All Flash&quot; #1, Owen as part of the new Suicide Squad captures two of the Rogues that are responsible for Bart Allen&#x27;s murder, Heat Wave and Weather Wizard, in Louisiana. In &quot;Countdown&quot; #39, he and the rest of the Squad chase after Piper and Trickster in Gotham City after they had escaped capture from Squad member Deadshot. The Squad however is just as unsuccessful as Deadshot, and the two Rogues escape capture.

Owen visits his father&#x27;s grave along with Tar Pit, when the swarm of black rings fly into the crypt and reanimate all the deceased villains as Black Lanterns, including his father. The Rogues battle in the Iron Heights, when the battle resulted in a draw on both sides, Owen arrives and abducts Digger from the battle, believing he can bring his father back. Later on, Owen has apparently chained up his father&#x27;s body and is feeding him victims such as a villain named Sandblast who was relying on Owen to get him into the Rogues. It is revealed that Owen has been deceived by Boomerang into believing the blood of enough victims can bring him back to life. The Rogues track Owen down with Captain Cold berating him for believing Harkness&#x27; lies. Realizing that Owen has broken the Rogues&#x27; code of honor by killing women and children, Cold shoves him into the pit. Owen has his heart ripped out by his father, with a ring flying in to revive him as a Black Lantern. The Black Lantern Owen and his father are then encased in ice by Cold. His father manages to escape and join in the mass battle against the heroes where he is brought back to life and full health.

==Powers and abilities==
Captain Boomerang carries a number of boomerangs in his satchel. He is an expert at throwing the weapons and as well as ordinary boomerangs he has a number with special properties, including bladed, explosive, incendiary, and electrified boomerangs. Upon his resurrection, Digger finds he has the ability to create boomerangs out of energy that explode on contact. However, this new ability is lost when he completes the task given by the White Lantern Entity.

The original Captain Boomerang then began to train his son Owen Mercer before he died. He has exhibited creativity in his boomerangs by creating &quot;razorangs&quot; and an acid-spewing boomerang. Owen has also exhibited &quot;speed bursts&quot;, short bursts of limited super speed over short distances, most notably when throwing boomerangs. These were even possible during the time period that Bart Allen fully contained the Speed Force, usually displayed as his ability to throw boomerangs at high velocities, rather than running. However, during Chang Tzu&#x27;s experiments, he claimed he believed Mercer could access the Speed Force, and Mercer denied having super speed at all anymore, but Chang Tzu was able to activate Owen&#x27;s speed involuntarily, causing him great pain. The exact source of this power remains unrevealed. Regardless, as of &quot;Justice Society of America&quot; #8, the Speed Force appears to have returned and is accessible to all former speedsters once more.

<text>Bunaken is an island of 8 km2, part of the Bunaken National Marine Park. Bunaken is located at the northern tip of the island of Sulawesi, Indonesia. It belongs administratively to the municipality of Manado. Scuba diving attracts many visitors to the island.
Bunaken National Park extends over an area of 890.65 km2 of which only 3% is terrestrial, including Bunaken Island, as well as the islands of Manado Tua, Mantehage, Nain and Siladen.

The waters of Bunaken National Marine Park are up to 1,566 m deep in Manado Bay, with temperatures ranging between 27 and 29 °C. It has a high diversity of - corals, fish, echinoderms and sponges. Notably, 7 of the 8 species of giant clams that occur in the world, occur in Bunaken. It also claims to have seven times more genera of coral than Hawaii, and has more than 70% of all the known fish species of the Indo-Western Pacific.

Oceanic currents may explain, in part, why Bunaken National Marine Park has such a high level of biodiversity. Northeasterly currents generally sweep through the park but abundant counter currents and gyros related to lunar cycles are believed to be a trap for free swimming larvae. This is particularly true on the south side of the crescent-shaped Bunaken Island, lying in the heart of the park. A snorkeler or diver in the vicinity of &quot;Lekuan&quot; or &quot;Fukui&quot; may spot over 33 species of butterfly fish and numerous types of groupers, damsels, wrasses and gobies. The gobies, smallish fish with bulging eyes and modified fins that allow them to attach to hard surfaces, are the most diverse but least known group of fish in the park.

<text>Deadshot (Floyd Lawton) is a character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Created by David Vern Reed and Lew Schwartz, based on a concept from Batman co-creator Bob Kane, the character made his first appearance in &quot;Batman&quot; #59 (June 1950). The introduction story features Deadshot using standard firearms while wearing a tuxedo, top hat, and simple domino mask. The character was not seen again until twenty-nine years later when writer Steve Englehart along with artists Marshall Rogers and Terry Austin retooled him in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; (vol.1) #474 (1979), now presenting him with customized wrist-mounted guns and a unique mask featuring a multi-use lens over his right eye. Since then, he has been a recurring character in Batman comics. Since 1986, Deadshot has also been frequently portrayed in comics books featuring the Suicide Squad.

Deadshot is an expert in firearms and an excellent sniper who regularly boasts of never missing a shot. He is often considered one of the deadliest assassins in the DC Universe. Lawton is eventually brought to justice by the superhero Batman, who becomes Lawton&#x27;s most recurring enemy over the years (though he also occasionally comes into conflict with other heroes). While typically portrayed as a supervillain, he is also sometimes depicted as an antihero as a member of the Suicide Squad where he fights more dangerous villains and threats, as well as through his need to protect those he regards as family, and through his occasional efforts to hold himself accountable to a personal code of ethics.

The character has been substantially adapted from the comics into various forms of media, including television series, feature films and video games. Deadshot was portrayed by Bradley Stryker in the final season of &quot;Smallville&quot;, Michael Rowe in the live-action Arrowverse franchise, and Will Smith in the DC Extended Universe film &quot;Suicide Squad&quot; (2016).

==Fictional character biography==

In his debut story, Floyd Lawton is shown to be an independently wealthy man with a trusted staff member and valet named Stevens. Gotham&#x27;s wealthier citizens, such as businessman Bruce Wayne, refer to Lawton as someone &quot;new&quot; to Gotham City. Following his recruitment to Task Force X (the &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;), Lawton&#x27;s past is further explained by therapist Dr. Marnie Herrs.

As a child, Floyd Lawton and his older brother Eddie are raised in a wealthy family that has great influence over their community. Their father George owns interests in much of the local real estate and hold sway over the local police, while their mother Genevieve, a prize-winning sharp shooter, controls the Pitt banking businesses. The Lawton parents are seen as a power couple in their society circles, but in private they grow to hate each other. By various accounts, Floyd is repeatedly judged by his parents for not matching the achievements of his brother in academics and sports, leading the younger Lawton child to act out in various ways.

When Eddie is in his mid-teens and Floyd is around 12 years old, Genevieve tells her sons about her husband&#x27;s infidelities and the many abuses she suffers under him, then asks the boys to kill George. Floyd attempts to warn George, but Eddie locks his younger brother in the nearby boathouse and then locks the doors of the family home so no one can enter or intrude on the killing. Floyd escapes, grabs a hunting rifle, and climbs a nearby tree to get a better view through all the windows of the family home. Seeing Eddie enter the house library to shoot their father, Floyd fires his rifle, hoping to disarm his brother. But the tree branch Floyd is on suddenly gives way and throws off his aim, causing him to shoot Eddie just as the elder brother shoots at their father. Eddie&#x27;s aim is also thrown off, leading his bullet to shatter George&#x27;s spine.

Refusing to have his family name tarnished by the scandal that would occur, George arranges with the police to cover up details of the crime. The official report concludes that an unknown sniper opened fire twice on George and that his son Eddie heroically died while diving into the path of the second bullet. As punishment for her efforts, George refuses to divorce Genevieve and instead forces her to live on a limited allowance and in isolation in another, smaller house the Lawton&#x27;s own on the outskirts of town. After high school, Floyd Lawton his family home to travel. Despite his later claims that he felt nothing on seeing his brother die, he often shows anger when recalling the incident and Eddie&#x27;s death inspires him to swear that in the future when he fires a gun, he will &quot;never miss.&quot;

The next several years of Floyd Lawton&#x27;s life before his arrival in Gotham City are not fully explained in the comics, though it is eventually revealed that as a young man he did meet David Cain, a highly skilled assassin who years earlier had been one of the teachers of Batman during the hero&#x27;s many years of preparation for crime-fighting. As a member of the League of Assassins, who sometimes take private contracts but are also available as operatives of the terrorist Ra&#x27;s al Ghul, David Cain is an expert in marksmanship, hand-to-hand combat techniques, martial arts, and military tactics, and he trains Floyd Lawton in all these areas. Floyd later remarks that Cain was his &quot;best teacher&quot;.

Lawton becomes a hired assassin in Europe and South America, staying largely unknown to authorities but gaining a reputation among certain gangs and cartels as a killer who never misses. At some point, Floyd Lawton marries a woman named Susan and they have a child together, a boy named Edward after Floyd&#x27;s deceased brother. Floyd later divorces Susan and removes himself from her and Edward&#x27;s life. He later claims he did this because Susan saw him not as who he is but who she thought he could be, and that his presence endangered the lives of happiness of her and Edward.

=== Gotham City ===
Eventually, Floyd takes residence in Gotham City and hires an assistant and trusted valet named Steven. He decides to become an influential figure and crime lord, similar to how his parents operated in his home town. While attending a charity ball, Floyd witnesses Gotham City&#x27;s hero Batman apprehend a group of thieves. Seeing Batman as a rival, Floyd decides to reduce the hero&#x27;s influence on Gotham before fully embarking on a criminal career. Donning a tuxedo, top hat, gun belt, and domino mask, Lawton operates publicly in Gotham City as a vigilante called Deadshot and uses his marksmanship abilities to disarm criminals without killing them.

Batman becomes suspicious of Deadshot and eventually learns his true motives and identity. Later, Deadshot reveals himself and attempts to kill Batman but is shocked when each of his shots miss. Batman taunts that Deadshot has no nerve to properly face and kill an opponent. In truth, Batman had gotten to Deadshot&#x27;s weapons ahead of time and altered their sights to throw off his aim, hoping to shake the villain psychologically.

Publicly exposed, Deadshot is taken to trial and imprisoned. After some time, he becomes resentful that he is considered a forgotten enemy of Batman&#x27;s while others such as the Penguin and Riddler gain greater renown. At his first opportunity, he escapes imprisonment and decides to prove himself in combat against Batman with new, wrist-mounted guns, customized body armor, and a mask that helps his already impressive aim. Despite his efforts, Deadshot is once again defeated by Gotham City&#x27;s hero. After escaping authorities again, Deadshot once again becomes an assassin for hire rather than focusing on revenge against the Dark Knight.

===Suicide Squad===
Government operative Amanda Waller gets permission to revive Task Force X, a special operations group that in the past was also known as the Suicide Squad. Under Waller&#x27;s leadership, Task Force X is no longer a group of government and military operatives but now is primarily made up of incarcerated super-villains who are considered expendable if lost on dangerous missions and are promised reduced prison time in exchange for their services.

After being defeated by the Flash, Floyd Lawton is imprisoned again and transferred to Belle Reve, a prison in Louisiana that also serves as the secret hub for the new Suicide Squad. There, Deadshot is recruited by Amanda Waller. It is later said Deadshot is selected not only due to his skills but also because mandated therapy sessions have revealed he sometimes is prone to a &quot;death-wish&quot;, internally hoping a proper enemy will end his life in a dramatic battle (it is also suggested this is why he initially decorates his second costume with a target on his chest). During his time with the team, Deadshot frequently clashes with teammate Captain Boomerang and field leader Rick Flag (for whom Floyd develops a grudging respect).

Soon after Deadshot joins the Suicide Squad, Batman learns of the team&#x27;s existence and confronts them, threatening to expose that the US government is employing super-villains for covert and possibly illegal missions. Amanda Waller counters that public exposure of Task Force X will force her to reveal Batman&#x27;s true identity. Before Batman leaves, Deadshot threatens him but the Dark Knight remarks that Lawton always &quot;pulls&quot; his shots when they are in battle with each other. Therapist Dr. Marnie Herrs later agrees with this conclusion, remarking that Deadshot sometimes sabotages his own efforts as if inviting his opponents to take advantage of the situation and end his life.

Deadshot&#x27;s son Edward, now about eight years old, is kidnapped by a gang of criminals hoping to manipulate Floyd. One of the gang members, Wes Anselm, is a pedophile with documented incidents of assaults against children. When Deadshot hunts down the gang, Wes grabs young Eddie and knocks him out, then flees with the boy in a car. Later, Deadshot finds Wes in his apartment and Eddie lying dead. Wes implies the boy struggled against an assault, which resulted in Wes becoming enraged and killing him. Deadshot takes revenge by delivering several non-lethal gunshots to Wes before finally killing him.

Having learned that Eddie&#x27;s kidnapping was part of a complicated plot by Genevieve Lawton to inspire Floyd to finally kill his father, Deadshot returns to his home town. Confronting his mother in her home, Deadshot first intends to kill her but then reconsiders when his therapist Marnie Herrs points out that Genevieve also has her own desire for death and hopes to be killed as she does not wish to harm herself. Rather than possibly give her the outcome she desires, Deadshot chooses not to kill his mother and instead shoots her with a precision shot to the spine, causing her to be a paraplegic. Deadshot remarks that this is fitting since her efforts to kill George Lawton only resulted in his own paralysis, and now they are a &quot;matched set.&quot;

Later on, a US senator threatens to expose the Suicide Squad to the world. Task Force X field leader Rick Flag decides to assassinate the senator and Deadshot is ordered to stop Flag. On the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, Deadshot publicly kills the senator himself, justifying that this is in compliance with his literal orders: &quot;Stop Flag from killing the senator. Exact words.&quot; DC police then gun down Deadshot where he stands, but he survives his wounds and after a hospital stay and physical therapy he returns to active duty with the Suicide Squad.

Lawton&#x27;s uniform is stolen by a man who then uses the Deadshot name and equipment to commit crimes and murders. After Lawton kills the impostor while the man is still dressed in the Deadshot uniform and mask. Later, Floyd is haunted by the experience of having shot down his own &quot;image&quot; and for some time does not fix the fatal bullet hole that now occupies his uniform.

Eventually, the Suicide Squad operations are temporarily halted and Deadshot returns to his own life and agenda. At one point, he becomes a host body for the demon lord Neron and nearly kills a kindergarten class. To Lawton&#x27;s relief, he is stopped and then relieved of his demonic possession by the Justice League. Later on, Deadshot accepts a contract to kill the Pope, but is thwarted by Wonder Woman.

After both of his parents die, Deadshot inherits some of their documents and belongings. He find a letter from Michelle Torres, a woman who claims Floyd Lawton is the father of her daughter Zoe Torres. Deadshot visits Michelle Torres in the Triangle, a neighborhood of Star City. Realizing Zoe is indeed his daughter, he recognizes Michelle as a sex worker he spent time with years before. Haunted by the memory of abandoning his son Eddie and later finding him dead, Floyd decides to take up temporary residence in the Triangle and look after Zoe and Michelle. He learns more about Michelle as a person, such as that she is proud of her Cuban and Italian heritage, and he comes to understand the different criminal gangs and slum lords that threaten the Triangle. Announcing his presence, Deadshot begins systematically fighting the corruption in the Triangle, hoping to make it a safer place for Zoe and Michelle. This results in the local population advocating to protect Deadshot from vigilantes such as local hero Green Arrow, and also leads to a new romance between Michelle and Floyd.

As supervillains with a grudge against Deadshot begin appearing in the Triangle, Lawton decides to put distance between himself and Michelle and Zoe. After setting up a school scholarship for Zoe, Deadshot kills several supervillains targeting him and then fakes his own death in an explosion. He decides to act more covertly for the time being. His efforts in the Triangle also inspire Green Arrow to take more interest in the area, ensuring the Zoe and Michelle&#x27;s neighborhood remains protected.

Lawton decides to do right by his daughter, and embarks on a lethal war on the local gangs that plague the area. The series ends with Deadshot faking his death, having realized a normal life is not for him, but also having mostly cleared up the area and convincing Green Arrow to patrol it more regularly.

===Secret Six===
During the 2005–2006 Infinite Crisis storyline, Deadshot briefly operates with a short-lived incarnation of the Secret Six, joining other villains who are recruited by the mysterious Mockingbird (a temporary alias used by Lex Luthor). For accepting membership, Deadshot is offered the reward of ruling North America; if he declines, his punishment will be the destruction of the Triangle in Star City, where Michelle and Zoe still live. At the conclusion of their main objective, Deadshot is rewarded with significant money that he then sends to Michelle.

Despite no longer being employed by Lex Luthor, the Secret Six remain active for a time and Deadshot stays on as a member. He develops a grudging friendship with teammate Catman, another former enemy of Batman&#x27;s. When this version of the Secret Six disbands, Deadshot is said to have returned to Amanda Waller&#x27;s new Suicide Squad.

While part of the Suicide Squad, Deadshot is sent against the villains Pied Piper and Trickster and then seemingly kills Trickster. These events occur during the year-long series &quot;Countdown.&quot; Like many events depicted in that series, Trickster&#x27;s death is later contradicted by other stories.

Amanda Waller decides to exile all criminals with superhuman abilities to another planet, without trial. The Suicide Squad works on rounding up as many villains as possible, sending them to another planet via a Boom Tube. After helping the effort, Deadshot is betrayed and exile to the planet as well, as he is still a supervillain as far as Amanda Waller and Rick Flag are concerned. Eventually, the exiled villains escape back to Earth.

===&quot;Secret Six&quot; volume 2===
Deadshot, along with Scandal Savage, Bane, Rag Doll and Catman reunite the Secret Six. The team is hired to retrieve Tarantula from Alcatraz Island, and find a card which she stole from Junior, a mysterious villain who supposedly runs the entire West Coast mob. Junior has practically the entire villain community at her beck and call, as many fear her methods and formidability. The Six later learn that the card in question was made by the demon lord Neron and serves a special function: &quot;Get Out Of Hell Free.&quot;

Soon, the Six are attacked by a small army of super-villains, all wanting to recover the card and collect the reward of $20 million for each of the Six. It is later revealed that Junior is in fact Rag Doll&#x27;s sister, as well as the daughter of the first Rag Doll.

The Six escape and head for Gotham City, only to be attacked by Junior and the Super villains. It is revealed that they were initially hired by the Mad Hatter, simply so they would be killed. Tarantula sacrifices herself and Junior, seemingly destroying the card as well in the process. It is later revealed that Scandal is now in possession of the card.

While on a mission to Gotham City to kill several of Batman&#x27;s allies, the Six are ambushed by a group of superheroes who have come to assist Batman. Deadshot is rendered unconscious by Green Lantern and the rest of the Six are similarly defeated soon after.

===The New 52===

In The New 52 (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe), a new timeline is presented which features a Deadshot with a significantly different past. Rather than a child of wealth, he is a child born to poverty who then joins the military before becoming an assassin for hire. He has a daughter named Suchin Lawton who has Japanese heritage. His children from the previous timeline, Edward and Zoe, are not mentioned.

Before joining the Suicide Squad, Lawton is described as a Batman villain and a rival of Mad Dog, a bounty hunter. He also is bitter enemies with Captain Boomerang. In the New 52 stories, he no longer sports his trademark mustache except at one point to grow one to cover a scar. A mercenary protégé of Lawton named Will Evans tried to usurp his role as Deadshot but was killed by Lawton.

Deadshot is arrested for a failed assassination of a U.S. Senator by Batman and is sentenced to life in prison. Later, he is recruited to be part of the Suicide Squad in exchange for early release. Deadshot is made team leader due to his skill under pressure. He develops a casual relationship with new teammate Harley Quinn. Deadshot later grows disillusioned with the group after a planned visit with his daughter, his first since his arrest, is withheld from him.

Deadshot ultimately sacrifices his life to kill the evil cult member Regulas. Deadshot is later resurrected, possibly through genetic material taken from Resurrection Man during an earlier mission.

During the 2013–2014 &quot;Forever Evil&quot; story line, the Justice League teams are seemingly killed. To ensure Earth is protected, Amanda Waller pays Deadshot to reunite the Suicide Squad. Deadshot&#x27;s first visit is to Harley Quinn.

===DC Rebirth===

Following the events of DC Rebirth in 2016, Deadshot&#x27;s pre-New 52 history is restored. When a character mentions having heard that Deadshot grew up in poverty, Lawton now remarks that this was a lie he told.

In the story &quot;The War of Jokes and Riddles,&quot; it is retroactively revealed that soon after his first defeat at Batman&#x27;s hands, Deadshot sided with the Joker in a gang war against the Riddler and other criminals. During this time, he sustained head trauma and was hospitalized after a battle with Batman.

Deadshot returns to service with the Suicide Squad. After several more missions, he is seemingly killed by Black Mask.

==Powers and abilities==
Deadshot has no superhuman powers but is the top marksman in the DC Universe. He possesses superhuman-like accuracy, and regularly boasts that he &quot;never misses&quot; his target. Deadshot once shot an apple off of Captain Boomerang&#x27;s head with his eyes closed. He also intentionally grazed the skull of Enchantress while she was flying, since he was asked to take her down non-lethally. He is so skilled that he can make his shots ricochet from structures and kill multiple targets at the same time. He can even shoot around corners. Deadshot is also a tactical genius and master strategist and is also a highly skilled demolitions expert.

Deadshot has access to a vast array of weaponry, most notably, his sniper rifle and twin machine guns mounted on each arm. Deadshot is allegedly bilingual, and learned to speak Russian as a youth.

Deadshot has proven to be a formidable hand-to-hand combatant when needed due to his excellent physical condition and training as an assassin. He has gone toe-to-toe against Batman on several occasions and has also fought Deathstroke to a standstill. He is adept in Karate, Jiu-Jitsu, Judo, Boxing, Krav Maga and Muay Thai. He is also an expert in many different styles of knife fighting. Lawton also possesses advanced knowledge of the human anatomy and knows all the weak spots and pressure points of the human body.

<text>Carl Constantine Kosak (1934 – March 23, 2023), better known by the pen name K. C. Constantine, was an American mystery author.

Little is known about Kosak, as he preferred anonymity and gave only a few interviews. He was born in McKees Rocks, Pennsylvania, and served in the Marines in the early 1950s. He was an alumnus of Westminster College in New Wilmington, Pennsylvania, and claimed that he &quot;flunked freshman composition twice&quot; because he &quot;did not know how to make an English sentence.&quot; (As reported in the bulletin of that college&#x27;s &quot;Friends of the Library&quot; Autumn, 1990.) He lived in Greensburg, Pennsylvania, with wife Linda (they married in 1962) and continued after she died in 2018.

Other than that, the information is sketchy. He may have been a minor league baseball player (some had even been suggesting that Kosak was a pseudonym for former Major League baseball player Phil Rizzuto), and he may have studied at the University of Iowa&#x27;s writers&#x27; program in the 1960s. Other evidence suggests he never got near a baseball and instead was a journalist at a western Pennsylvania newspaper.

Kosak continued to work a day job until 1993, when he lost his job and turned to writing full-time. He worked for several years as an English teacher at Seton Hill University (then Seton Hill College) in Greensburg, where he taught creative writing and composition until his refusal to complete his master&#x27;s degree prompted his dismissal.

His most famous creation is Mario Balzic, police chief in fictional Rocksburg, Pennsylvania. Rocksburg is a by-product of Kosak&#x27;s hometown, McKees Rocks, and the nearby cities Greensburg and Johnstown. Kosak is much more interested in the people in his novels than the actual mystery, and his later novels become ever more philosophical, threatening to leave the mystery/detective genre behind completely. In 1989, Constantine was nominated for the Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Novel for the Mario Balzic novel &quot;Joey&#x27;s Case&quot;. In 1999 &quot;Booklist&quot; ranked &quot;Blood Mud&quot; among the year&#x27;s best crime novels, saying (along with &quot;Brushback&quot;), &quot;Constantine has given us two more superb police procedurals and a wonderful opportunity to renew our acquaintance with one of the most memorable characters in contemporary crime fiction.&quot;

In May 2011, Kosak appeared in person for the first time at the 16th annual Festival of Mystery held at the Greek Orthodox Church in Oakmont, signing his books and giving a live interview.

Kosak died on March 23, 2023, at the age of 88. Mysterious Press announced they would be publishing a final novel—more than twenty years after his last publication—entitled &quot;Another Day&#x27;s Pain&quot;.

<text>SubEthaEdit is a collaborative real-time editor designed for Mac OS X. The name comes from the Sub-Etha communication network in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; series.

== History ==
SubEthaEdit was first released under the name Hydra in early 2003 but, for legal reasons, the name was changed to SubEthaEdit in late 2004.

The first version of Hydra was built in just a few months with the intent of winning an Apple Design Award, which it did at Apple&#x27;s Worldwide Developers Conference 2003. In 2007, TheCodingMonkeys licensed the &quot;Subetha Engine&quot; to Panic for use in Coda.

In June 2014, SubEthaEdit 4 was released, distributed exclusively in the Mac App Store. With version 5 released in 2019, the application became free and open source, under the MIT license.

== Features ==
Apart from the usual text-editing capabilities, collaborative editing is one of SubEthaEdit&#x27;s key features. The collaboration is document-based, non-locking, and non-blocking. Anyone participating in the collaborative edit can type in the document anywhere at any time. Using Bonjour (formerly Rendezvous) and BEEP, SubEthaEdit works without any configuration on the LAN but can also coordinate collaborative editing over the Internet. SubEthaEdit can be used for distributed pair programming and collaborative note-taking in conferences.

Other SubEthaEdit features include:
*Regular expression search and replace in many regexp dialects 
*Customizable syntax highlighting and symbol pop-up for more than twenty languages — and over 40 user contributed languages. 
*Full line-ending and character encoding support (including Unicode) 
*Live-updating preview of rendered HTML documents using WebKit

<text>The Cesky Terrier ( ; , &#x27;Bohemian Terrier&#x27; or &#x27;Czech Terrier&#x27;) is a small terrier type dog originating in Czechoslovakia.

== History ==
The Cesky Terrier was created by a Czech breeder, František Horák, in 1948, as a cross between a Sealyham Terrier and a Scottish Terrier, to create a terrier suitable for hunting in the forests of Bohemia. Although not a trained scientist, Horák worked for many years as a research assistant at the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences and used knowledge gained there in his dog breeding. Czechoslovakia was ruled by a communist regime at the time; when Horák&#x27;s dogs became more popular around the world, he began to receive a large volume of mail from outside the country, which earned him the attention of the secret police. Horák died in 1997.

The Cesky Terrier was recognized for international competition by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 1963 as breed number 246 in Group 3, Terriers. The breed is now recognized by all of the major kennel clubs in the English-speaking world. The Cesky Terrier is one of the six most rare dog breeds worldwide.

The breed was first imported into the US in the 1980s by a group of enthusiasts. They formed the Cesky Terrier Club of America in January 1988. As interest grew, the breed became eligible to join the American Kennel Club (AKC) Foundation Stock Service Program from January 1, 2004, allowing it to compete in AKC Earthdog tests. At this stage the American Cesky Terrier Fanciers Association was formed and recognised by the AKC. It is the club accepted as the parent club by the AKC. However, the Cesky Terrier Club of America remains active in promoting the breed in the USA.
From mid-2011, the Cesky Terrier was able to compete in the terrier group in America as it was accepted for entry in the AKC Stud Book.

The breed first arrived in the UK in 1989 and had to compete from the imported register. The Cesky Terrier was recognised by the Kennel Club (UK) in 1990 and on January 1, 2000, it gained rare breed status. It has since competed successfully in show competition in the UK.

== Description ==

=== Appearance ===

The Cesky Terrier is a well-muscled, short legged, well-pigmented, hunting terrier of a rectangular format. The Cesky has natural drop ears, a natural tail, and sports a long, silky with slight texture coat in shades of gray from charcoal to platinum (black pigmented) or rarely brown (liver pigmented). The Cesky is longer than it is tall and has a topline that rises slightly to the rear.

*Ears - Medium size, dropping in such a way to well cover the orifice. Ears are set rather high with forward edge lying close to the cheek. Shaped like a triangle, with the shorter side of the triangle at the fold of the ear.
*Head – Head is ideally 8 inches long, 3.5 to 4 inches wide and is shaped like a long, blunt wedge. The plane of the forehead forms a slight but definite stop with the bridge of the nose. The breadth between the ears is slightly larger for a dog than a bitch.
*Skull – Skull is shaped like a blunt wedge with the broadest part between the ears which apers moderately towards the supraorbital ridges. Occipital protuberance easy to palpate, cheek bones moderately prominent. Frontal furrow only slightly marked.
* Muzzle - Nasal Bridge straight. Narrow foreface undesirable.
*Stop – Not accentuated but apparent.
*Nose – Dark and well developed. The color is black in all shades of grey and liver in brown dogs.
* Lips—Relatively thick, fitting neatly.
* Bite—Scissors or level bite, complete dentition preferred. Absence of 2 premolars in lower jaw not to be penalized. Absence of more than 4 teeth or any incisors is a disqualifying fault.
* Teeth – Set square to the jaw, strong and regularly aligned.
Neck, Topline and Body
* Neck – Well muscled and strong. Medium-long, carried on a slant.
* Topline – Not straight but with a slight rise.
* Body – Fully muscled, oblong. Withers not very pronounced with the neck set rather high. Croup is strongly developed, muscular; pelvis moderately slanting. Hip bones often slightly higher than the withers.
* Chest – More cylindrical than deep.
* Ribs – Well sprung.
* Underline – Ample belly and slightly tucked up. Flanks well filled.
* Loins – Relatively long, muscular, broad and slightly rounded.
* Tail – Ideal length is inches, relatively strong and low set. Tail may be carried downward or with a slight bend at tip; or carried saber shaped horizontally or higher. All of these tail carriages are considered correct with none having preference over the other. Curled tail or carried over the back to be penalized.

Forequarters
* Angulation—Moderately well angulated.
* Shoulder – Muscular, well laid back and powerful.
* Elbows – Somewhat loose, yet not turned in or out.
* Legs – Short, straight, well boned and parallel. Dewclaws may be present.
* Feet – Large, well-arched toes with strong nails and well-developed thick pads.

Hindquarters
* Angulation—Well angulated.
* Legs – Strong, parallel and well muscled.
* Upper Thigh - Well Muscled.
* Stifle—Well bent.
* Second Thigh—relatively short
* Hock Joint - Strong and well developed. Set relatively high.
* Feet – Smaller than forefeet, well arched toes, strong nails and thick well developed pads.

Coat
:Long, fine, firm with slight texture, slightly wavy with a silky gloss. Not overdone with too much furnishings. Faults: Curly, Coarse or cotton-wool like texture. The Cesky Terrier is groomed by clipping and scissoring into a saddle pattern on the body, with the longer hair ending in a V on the tail. A &quot;U&quot; shape is cut out of the top lateral portion of the front legs and Areas of the neck, head, chest, shoulder, tail and rear thigh from the top of the V on the tail to the top of the hock and round the vent is clipped shorter to achieve this appearance and to highlight the well developed muscles of the Cesky Terrier. The Hair on the fore face from mid eye to the rear edge of the lip line is not to be clipped thus forming brows and a beard. The transition between clipped and unclipped areas should be pleasing to the eye and never abrupt.

Color
:The Cesky Terrier has two varieties of color: In mature dogs, 3 years or older: 1. Any shade of gray from charcoal to platinum gray with Black pigment. 2. Coffee Brown with Liver pigment. Black may appear on the head, beard, cheeks, ears, feet and tail. White, grey, brown and yellow markings are permitted on the head, beard, cheeks, neck, chest, limbs and around the vent. A white collar or white tip is permitted on the tail. The base color must always be predominant. Faults: Long brindled coat on dogs older than 2 years, white covering more than 20%, and a white blaze are disqualifying faults.

Gait
:The action should be free, driven and enduring. Gallop rather slow but lasting. The forelegs extend in a straight line forward.

=== Temperament ===
The breed standard calls for a calm dog, and aggression is a disqualifying fault. Cesky Terriers are reputed to be less active and quieter than other terriers. This may or may not make them suitable pets for families with children.

== Care ==
The coat of the Cesky Terrier is not &quot;stripped&quot; (dead hair pulled out with the fingers or a special knife) as in other terriers, but rather is clippered. .) The longer hair should be brushed daily.

== Health ==
This breed occasionally suffers from the Scotty Cramp, a minor problem causing awkward movement, but it is not life-threatening.

Breeding stock should be checked for hip dysplasia, patella luxation, cardiac abnormalities, PLL (primary lens luxation) and other eye disorders such as cataracts, thyroid issues, degenerative myelopathy, and Type 3 von Willebrand disease, all of which have been documented issues in the breed.

<text>Madan ( ) is a town in Smolyan Province, the very south of Bulgaria in the Yellow Share of the Rhodope Mountains. It is the administrative centre of the homonymous Madan Municipality. In 2019, the town had a population of 6,597.

==Geography==
Madan is a part of Ardino Ridge, sloping down to the northeast between the rivers Arda and Varbitsa. In the central part of the Yellow Share rise the peaks Buchovitsa (1404 m), Veternitsa (1372 m) and Petrovitsa (1309 m).

The end of the ridge is Alada Peak (1241 m). From all sides the Yellow Share is separated by mountain-spurs, whose segmentations gradually slope down and vanish into the valleys of the rivers. The river system of the region is presented by the basins of the upper reaches of some of the longer rivers – to the north the basin of the Arda River with the headers Elhovska and Chepinska Rivers.

==History and population==
Madan is an ancient ore-miners&#x27; settlement, the extraction of lead ore having begun around 5th-4th century BC.

Most of the town&#x27;s population consists of local Pomaks and a minority of Eastern Orthodox Bulgarians.

==Honour==
Madan Saddle on Smith Island, South Shetland Islands is named after Madan.

<doc id="863286" wikidata="Q1156071" url="?curid=863286" title="Misha">
<text>Misha (), also known as Mishka () or The Olympic Mishka (), is the name of the Russian Bear mascot of the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games (the XXII Summer Olympics). He was designed by children&#x27;s books illustrator Victor Chizhikov.

Misha is the first mascot of a sporting event to achieve large-scale commercial success in merchandise. The Misha doll was used extensively during the opening and closing ceremonies, appeared on several merchandise products and had both an animated short film (animated by Soyuzmultfilm) and a television series (animated by Nippon Animation), all of which are now common practice not only in the Olympic Games, but also in the FIFA World Cup and other events&#x27; mascots.

== Origins ==
In 1977, the committee organizing the Olympics held a contest for the best illustration of a bear. The judges chose Victor Chizhikov&#x27;s design depicting a smiling bear cub wearing a blue-black-yellow-green-red (colors of the Olympic rings) weightlifter&#x27;s belt, with a golden buckle shaped like the five rings. Misha&#x27;s design of a small, cuddly and smiling bear cub was evidently intended to counter the &quot;big and brutal Russian Bear&quot;. Misha was confirmed as an official mascot on 19 December 1977. Chizhikov complained that the country reneged on a promise to grant him the copyright to his bear which deprived him of royalties, although the Russian Olympic Committee stated &quot;in accordance with the Olympic Charter, after Dec. 31 of the year in which the Olympic Games had been held, all the rights to the intellectual property and the symbols of the Olympics go the International Olympic Committee&quot;.

During the closing ceremony of the 1980 Olympic Games, a giant effigy of Misha the Bear holding a cluster of balloons was paraded in the stadium. On one side of the stadium where the Olympic Torch was situated, there was a placard mural of Misha which shed tears of happiness from his left eye. At the end of the ceremony, Misha with his balloons was released and rose in the air away from the stadium, and this nostalgic moment has been fondly remembered by Russians. A few hours later Misha landed on Vorobyovy Gory and later was exhibited at the Exhibition Centre.

== Legacy ==
Misha&#x27;s designer, Viktor Chizhikov, accused the designer of the polar bear mascot (named Bely Mishka, and is said to be Misha&#x27;s grandson) for the 2014 Sochi Olympics of plagiarism. Chizhikov noted that the Bely&#x27;s facial features were all taken from Misha, saying &quot;they just pumped him up and made him fatter&quot;. Chizhikov also complained that Bely and the other two mascots (the Hare and Leopard) was lacking personality. As a result of these issues, as well as being denied the copyright to Misha, Chizhikov declined to help when asked by the organizers of the 2014 Winter Olympics closing ceremony.

A short clip of the 1980 Summer Olympics closing ceremony of Misha&#x27;s departure was shown in the closing ceremony of the 2014 Winter Olympics. Afterwards, the giant animatronic polar bear Mishka blew out the 2014 Games Olympic torch and shed a tear (in a nod to Misha&#x27;s tears during the end of the 1980 Games).

<text>The Old Carleton County Court House is an 1833 court house in Upper Woodstock, New Brunswick, Canada.

The Courthouse was built in 1833. A new courthouse was constructed, obviating the need for the old one, which was used as a horse barn from 1911 until 1960 when it was purchased by the Carleton County Historical Society. It was designated as a protected heritage site in 1977.

It is open to the public Monday to Saturday from 11am-7pm from July 1 to August 31, Monday to Saturday, and at other times by appointment. The Victorian Christmas Concert is held here on the last weekend in November.

Renovation work on the roof was begun in December 2012.

<doc id="863292" wikidata="Q1639843" url="?curid=863292" title="Jagged Alliance">
<text>Jagged Alliance is a series of turn-based tactics video games. The first games in the series were released for DOS. From &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot; on, the games were developed using DirectX for native Windows operation. &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot; was also released for Linux and is available on Steam and on GOG.com for Windows.

== Overview ==
The &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; games center on strategically controlling mercenary squads, on and off the field, who complete various missions such as freeing countries from oppressive dictators. The games feature a mix of turn-based battle simulation, 4X (explore, expand, exploit, and exterminate) elements and role-playing.

Humour via spoken character comments is a trademark of the series. The personalities of the individual mercenaries range from mildly eccentric to disturbed. This contrasts the games&#x27; setting which is otherwise closely linked to such subjects as war and death.
Each mercenary is an individual with their own traits. Part of the strategy was the player&#x27;s freedom to select a multi-faceted team to win the game in different ways. Not all teams would work; for example, Ivan and his nephew Igor, who work well together, are hated by Steroid, the Polish bodybuilder. &quot;Buns&quot;, a Danish markswoman, hates &quot;Fox&quot;, a medic with centerfold looks. In contrast, &quot;Fox&quot; loves working with &quot;Grizzly,&quot; on whom she has something of a crush.

The mercenaries may be out on various assignments, determined randomly, so that the available pool of characters is never the same for each game.

The player has to maintain a level of reputation in the &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; games. If the player gets their troops killed often, regularly hires and dismisses members or generally is insensitive (such as not paying for deceased merc body shipments back home), their reputation will lower. Bad player&#x27;s reputation affects all mercenaries. Mercs may demand a significant pay raise to consider working for the player. Hired mercenaries may quit unless the player discreetly pays them a bonus. And only desperate-for-work mercs will agree to work for really notorious players.

==Intellectual property==
The intellectual property (IP) for &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; has been exchanged between many companies. The series and IP were created by Mad Labs Software, who later became a part of the publisher for the first game, Sir-Tech Software, Inc., along with a transfer of IP. The second game, &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot;, was also started by Sir-Tech. When Sir-Tech&#x27;s publishing arm went bankrupt, the game rights were transferred to its development house Sir-Tech Canada and published by TalonSoft. By the time &quot;Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business&quot; was released, Sir-Tech&#x27;s publishing arm was out of business and the game was released by Interplay. Subsequently TalonSoft went bankrupt. At the moment Strategy First owns the IP and has published &quot;Jagged Alliance: Wildfire&quot;. Strategy First made several attempts to extend the series with &quot;Jagged Alliance 3D&quot; and &quot;Jagged Alliance 3&quot;, both of which never saw the light of day. Strategy First was acquired by Silverstar Holdings, which then ran into financial problems and was delisted by NASDAQ. It is unclear what effect this will have on future games using the &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; IP, though in the final SEC filing before being delisted Silverstar stated that it had reached a settlement of some issues with Russia-based Akella: &quot;Akella and 3A Entertainment have the option to acquire certain intellectual property rights for the Jagged Alliance and Disciples franchises for an additional $100,000&quot;.

The first &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; game was developed by MadLab Software, Montreal. Qc, the following three games were developed by Sir-Tech Development based in Ottawa, Ontario. Ian Currie, Shaun Lyng and Linda Currie were the lead designers on the &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; series. MadLab was absorbed by Sir-Tech Canada but the company shut down in late 2003.

Nordic Games acquired the rights for &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; in 2015 after bitComposer&#x27;s bankruptcy.

== Games ==
=== &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; ===
Released in 1995 for MS-DOS, this first game of the series tasks the player with freeing the fictional island of Metavira from the greedy Santino. The player must recruit mercenaries as they explore, capture, and hold new territory. The natives harvest the valuable trees from which a revolutionary medicine can be extracted; a result of the island having been used as a nuclear testing ground in 1952. The more trees the player holds, the more income they make. Income can be used to hire native guards and hire more mercenaries to take the offensive and clear more sectors of enemies.

This game features a top-down perspective of the game field for battles, with character portraits framing the view on the left and right sides. A separate map view shows the entire country broken up into distinct conquerable sectors.

==== &quot;Jagged Alliance DS&quot; ====

In May 2009, a Nintendo DS &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; game was released, based on the original &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot;.

=== &quot;Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games&quot; ===

Released in 1996, &quot;Deadly Games&quot; is a DOS sequel to the original game. It features a different format, however, and is considered by some to be more of a spin-off than a sequel. This game features the same engine and top-down perspective as the original game.

=== &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot; ===
This game was released in 1999 for Windows and was later ported to Linux by Tribsoft. The mission of this second official game of the series is to free the country of Arulco from its evil dictator Queen Deidranna. Deidranna married the democratically elected King of Arulco, then launched a coup d&#x27;état eight years ago, deposing her husband and taking power for herself. The player is &quot;hired&quot; by the exiled king, Enrico Chivaldori, to free his homeland of Deidranna&#x27;s dictatorial regime.

Gameplay is similar to the original grand adventure style of &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot;, but features higher-resolution graphics and an isometric pseudo-3D view of the battleground. The terrain has two height levels (ground and rooftops) for player / enemy sprites and a basic physics engine for thrown objects and ballistics. It also features &quot;destructible terrain&quot; in that players are able to blow open walls and buildings with explosives. The game also takes place across diverse and rather imaginative locations, including a multi-level prison facility, a school, a hospital, surface-to-air missile (SAM) sites, a swamp and a junkyard.

The weapons arsenal has grown considerably to include a variety of weapons based on real-life counterparts (such as automatic weapons, shotguns, rocket launchers) and also fictional weapons like an auto firing rocket rifle. There are some more role-playing elements like specialty professions and the possibility to create a custom mercenary as well.

Mercs can talk to one another during missions, usually spouting one-liners and other comments to each other.

In June 2005, Pocket PC Studios and Strategy First announced a conversion of &quot;Jagged Alliance 2 Gold&quot; for the Nintendo DS. This was never released.

JA2 has been extensively modded by fans of the series. Most notable include, but are not limited to: &quot;v1.13&quot;, &quot;Urban Chaos&quot;, &quot;Deidranna Lives&quot;, &quot;Renegade Republic&quot;. and &quot;JA2-Stracciatella&quot;.

==== &quot;Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business&quot; ==== 
&quot;Jagged Alliance 2: Unfinished Business&quot;, alternatively known as &quot;Jagged Alliance 2.5&quot;, is a short, mission-based standalone sequel released by Sir-Tech in 2000. This release adds some tweaks to the combat engine, as well as a scenario editor, yet the gameplay remains largely unchanged. It allows importing of the character created for JA2 with his or her final stats; the improved stats of other mercenaries will then be imported too.

A new plot is introduced in &quot;Unfinished Business&quot;. The original owners of Arulco&#x27;s lucrative mines have returned and established a missile base in the nearby country of Tracona, demanding the mines are returned to them. They destroy Arulco&#x27;s now-empty Tixa prison as an example of what happens if their demands are not met. The player must put a team of mercenaries together to infiltrate Tracona and disable the missile base.

==== &quot;Jagged Alliance 2: Gold Pack&quot; ==== 
&quot;Jagged Alliance 2: Gold Pack&quot; was published by Strategy First on August 6, 2002 and adds the improvements of &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; to the final release of &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot;. &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; and a scenario editor are also included in the package.

&quot;Gold Pack&quot; introduces notable changes to the difficulty setting. The player choosing an advanced difficulty level may also decide to make the player turns timed and whether to disallow saving during combat, as opposed to the original &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot;, which set these settings automatically.

==== &quot;Jagged Alliance 2: Wildfire&quot; ==== 
&quot;Jagged Alliance 2: Wildfire&quot;, version 5, was programmed by i-Deal Games and published by Strategy First in 2004 as an official expansion pack. The game&#x27;s sourcecode was also published in the package, albeit under license. The project had started as a hobby add-on by Serge &quot;WildFire&quot; Popoff, who decided to make it commercial since version 4.

Compared to the original &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot;, &quot;Wildfire&quot; 5 has not altered the game engine or controls and can be considered a mod. The focus was instead directed into designing revamped environments, new items and stronger enemies. This presents players with a more challenging campaign, however the goals and progression remain the same. In terms of gameplay features, the game remains almost unchanged.

Soon after release, i-Deal Games terminated relations with Strategy First stating &quot;...SF fulfilled none of obligation of contract and paid no single cent to i-Deal Games...&quot;. Consequently, WF5 remains largely unpatched, only minor hotfixes were published. I-Deal Games also stated that buggy version were released by Strategy First.

After the falling out with Strategy First, i-Deal Games developed another version of &quot;Wildfire&quot;, identified as &quot;version 6&quot;, with Zuxxez Entertainment (now TopWare Interactive AG) as distributor.

 contains changed source code, a tweaked graphics engine that allows for a higher resolution, introduces new mercenaries and increases squad size from 6 to 10. It can be patched up to version 6.04 (for English version), up to 6.06 (for German version), or up to 6.08 (for Russian version).

WF5 can not be upgraded to and patches for can not be applied. See Digital distribution for further details.

&quot;Jagged Alliance 2 Wildfire (v5)&quot; was distributed electronically by Strategy First. &quot;Jagged Alliance 2 Wildfire (v6)&quot; was distributed electronically by Zuxxez Entertainment. Two versions of the same game (&quot;Wildfire&quot;) exist due to the game&#x27;s publisher Strategy First, Inc. falling out after a disagreement with the game&#x27;s developer, I-Deal Games Studios concerning expenses. Version 5 is the version published by SF before this spat and so is more problematic than v6, the version released through Zuxxez and others by the developer since the incident.

=== &quot;Jagged Alliance 3&quot; ===
==== &quot;Jagged Alliance 3D / Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge&quot; ====

Strategy First and Game Factory Interactive announced in June 2004 that Russian developer MiST Land South would develop the next two games in the &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; series: &quot;Jagged Alliance 3D&quot; (JA3D) and &quot;Jagged Alliance 3&quot; (JA3).

&quot;Jagged Alliance 3D&quot; was envisioned as &quot;JA2 in 3D&quot;, or basically the same game as &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot; but using a 3D engine. &quot;Jagged Alliance 3&quot; would be the &quot;true sequel&quot; to JA2, a full-fledged game in the same spirit as JA2, and using the engine developed for JA3D. JA3D would come out quickly, within a year or two of the release of the generally successful &quot;Wildfire&quot; mod, and be followed by &quot;Jagged Alliance 3&quot;. SFI choose GFI because GFI had already released &quot;Cops 2170&quot;, a tactical-strategy game published by SFI in North America. The two companies already had a relationship, and it was felt the JA3D project could be mutually beneficial.

From statements made by both Strategy First and Game Factory Interactive, it is apparent that GFI assumed the costs for the development, with SFI providing the intellectual property and the overall vision for the project. This arrangement proved to be very cumbersome, and prone to misunderstandings and confusion. SFI, naturally enough, had very ambitious goals for JA3D while GFI sought to control development costs and time.

The initial plan was for GFI to use a modified &quot;Cops 2170&quot; engine to quickly produce JA3D. However, GFI already had a second strategy game in production, &quot;ALFA: Anti-terror&quot;, and they made the decision to use this engine for both games. GFI planned to set the game in Africa, which was fine with SFI. However, GFI ran into trouble with the strategic layer for Jagged Alliance. They proposed a mission-based structure for JA3D instead. There would be no free-flowing strategic layer, as in &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; and &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot; where the player made strategic movement decisions, and initiated attacks on a map. Instead, the game would be structured like &quot;Jagged Alliance: Deadly Games&quot;, with a series of missions, which were essentially combat-only levels. SFI was resistant to the idea, but agreed to it, feeling this would shorten the development time. Besides, JA3D was always intended as a bridge between JA2 and JA3, so it was acceptable that it was not a &quot;full game&quot;.

In 2004, initial screenshots of the new engine were released, showing a somewhat primitive 3D engine with familiar &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; characters, such as Shadow.

In May 2005, the MiST Land South developers announced they would be discarding the turn-based combat system in favor of real-time combat. The turn-based combat had been a hallmark of &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; from the very beginning, and it was a major reason why most fans stayed with the game. This announcement was a surprise to Strategy First, and was very quickly vetoed by Richard Therrien, VP product development of SFI.

In September 2005, SFI withdrew the rights for &quot;Jagged Alliance 3&quot; from GFI, leaving them with the &quot;JA3D&quot; license only.

A pre-beta version of &quot;JA3D&quot; was shown at the 2006 E3 convention, and received a generally favorable reception. The gameplay appeared to be very similar to &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot;, with updated and improved graphics, as well as a 3D combat engine.

On July 20, 2006, Game Factory Interactive announced that MiST Land South was being dissolved, as of August 1, 2006.

In August 2006, SFI withdrew the rights to &quot;JA3D&quot; as well. GFI claimed that the game simply did not fit within SFI&#x27;s plans. SFI, on the other hand, stated that &quot;JA3D&quot; was in an incomplete state and not ready for the scheduled release date. It was obvious that SFI, having faced years of development without any progress, had finally given up on the project.

This left GFI with no rights to use any of the intellectual property of &quot;JA3D&quot;, including characters and story line. GFI announced plans to rework the characters and story to remove &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot;-specific details and publish the game under a different name. In a September 3, 2006 post on its discussion boards, GFI claimed that SFI owed it money, but this was denied by SFI without further elaboration. One of the changes GFI planned to make to &quot;JA3D&quot; was the introduction of a strategic layer.

In November 2007 Game Factory Interactive released &quot;Hired Guns: The Jagged Edge&quot;. The game does not have any storyline or characters in common with &quot;JA2&quot;, as GFI lost the rights to use any of the intellectual property of Strategy First. Still, it is seen as a spiritual successor; the game is structurally similar to &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; series and features a mercenary-themed plot, turn-based gameplay, and a familiar game interface.

==== &quot;Jagged Alliance 3&quot; development hell ====
Strategy First intended to produce &quot;Jagged Alliance 3&quot; internally, with head developer Thiessen promising a much more open experience than any other &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; game. There were expected to be five separate factions to fight in &quot;JA3&quot;, instead of a single enemy. Characters were said to have their own agendas and allegiances in addition to randomization of various settings of the game upon startup in order to make it less predictable; a character who was allied with the player in one game could be their enemy in the next. Player actions were also said to influence how the characters of the world react to them.

In December 2006, Strategy First outsourced &quot;Jagged Alliance 3&quot; again. The publisher, along with Russian developers Akella and F3games, were to create the game, setting an approximate release date of late 2008.

As of October 2008 the game has been delayed again, and Akella&#x27;s website was displaying a release date of Q1 2010. This delay was likely due to publishers demand to improve graphics.

On December 21, 2009, a German language game site reported that Akella had stopped development on &quot;Jagged Alliance 3&quot;. Strategy First had made no statement on the future of the &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; series.

On March 9, 2010, German outfit bitComposer Games (now bitComposer Interactive) picked up the rights to the PC strategy series, and started &quot;preliminary development&quot; on the third full game for release in 2011. In August 2015, Nordic Games (now THQ Nordic) acquired the rights from bitComposer. “The decision to acquire Jagged Alliance was an absolute no-brainer for us”, commented Reinhard Pollice, Business &amp; Product Development Director at Nordic Games, although no immediate announcement has been made regarding their specific plans for the series.

==== &quot;Jagged Alliance 3&quot; release ====

On September 17, 2021, during the THQ Nordic 10th Anniversary Digital Showcase &quot;Jagged Alliance 3&quot; was announced for PC, now in development by Haemimont Games. It was released on July 14, 2023.

=== &quot;Jagged Alliance: Back in Action&quot; ===

On August 20, 2010, bitComposer Games announced &quot;Jagged Alliance: Back in Action&quot;, a full-scale remake of &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot;. It was originally titled &quot;Jagged Alliance: Reloaded&quot;. The game was demonstrated at GDC 2011 and released on February 9, 2012.

The stated goal of the remake was to improve the original game concept as well as the visual weaknesses of the original. The story and content are noticeably different from the original as well, with key strategic elements such as boardable vehicles and training of militia removed. Mercenaries are easier to train and permanently hired for a one-time fee rather than the time-based pay of the original. Conversation trees with NPCs have been replaced with linear &quot;talk or stop talking&quot; dialogue. Humorous cut-scenes featuring the exploits of the Queen have also been removed.

&quot;Jagged Alliance: Back in Action&quot; features then-modern 3D graphics in an isometric perspective. The user interface was completely redesigned and includes a new detailed tutorial that helps new players to learn how to play the game properly. The new real time &quot;Plan &amp; Go&quot; system optionally removes the classic &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; staple of turn based gameplay. It also initially removed the fog of war, making the tactical element of the game simpler and faster to play as it was unnecessary for the player to prepare for enemy surprise attacks or ambushes with all enemies immediately visible. A fog of war system was added to the game post-release called tactical mode, which requires mercenaries to acquire a line of sight on an enemy for them to become visible. The developers estimate that the remake will take players around 70 hours to complete.

The critical reception was mixed at best, with armchairempire.com saying &quot;&quot;Jagged Alliance: Back In Action&quot; is, and probably will for many years hence be, the definitive textbook example of how to mess up by the numbers when attempting to &quot;relaunch&quot; a classic franchise&quot;. Even Finnish Pelit magazine, in one of the most positive reviews internationally, stated &quot;&quot;Back in Action&quot; is not a bad game, but pales in comparison to its father&quot;.

The first downloadable content pack &quot;Shades of Red&quot; was released for &quot;Jagged Alliance: Back in Action&quot; on May 18, 2012.

The second downloadable content pack &quot;Point Blank&quot; was released on June 14, 2012.

==== &quot;Jagged Alliance: Crossfire&quot; ====
On June 13, 2012, bitComposer Games and Kalypso announced the first add-on to &quot;Jagged Alliance: Back in Action&quot;. The standalone add-on, &quot;Jagged Alliance: Crossfire&quot; adds new mercenaries, new environments and new weapons.

The setting of Crossfire takes place shortly after the events of &quot;Jagged Alliance 2&quot; at Khaanpa, a small micronation located somewhere in the volatile Asia region. A huge temple has been uncovered and with it a large vein of coltan ore. This triggers a destructive religious conflict funded by the resources which had led to the deaths of many innocent people caught in crossfire, as the leader of the Jenitenn Cult profits from the disaster through humanitarian aid. The United Nations is unwilling to send peacekeepers in a possible chance to fail in peacekeeping efforts and the ambassador of Khaanpa sends AIM to defuse the threat. Upon the death of the leader of the cult, a volcanic eruption occurs near Khaanpa and the UN finally sends in a peacekeeping effort to help rebuild the nation in the wake of the crossfire.

It was released on August 24, 2012, on Steam in a downloadable format and elsewhere on September 25, 2012 as a physical product.

&quot;Jagged Alliance: Crossfire&quot; was developed by the Coreplay Studio in Munich.

=== &quot;Jagged Alliance Online&quot; ===
&quot;Jagged Alliance Online&quot; was developed by Vienna-based Cliffhanger Productions and features full 3D graphics. It was a free-to-play game made in Unity. It had single-player and player versus player missions.

The MMO offers the usual &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; game mechanics, a mix of turn-based combat and real-time action. From a 3D isometric perspective, each player controls and maintains a group of mercenaries and is tasked to use their abilities to complete missions and collect money and build reputation. To succeed, players are required to train and equip their mercenaries with better weapons and tools. Players can also help each other working together to complete battlegrounds and there are also player versus player battles. Players operate from a Headquarters which can be built up and improved upon. From here players can send their mercenaries on over 100 missions around the globe. Although the game is free, there is additional single player content that needs to be purchased, which can be done so online.

gamigo AG and bitComposer Games announced at Gamescom 2010 that a new title, &quot;Jagged Alliance Online&quot;, a web browser tactical MMORPG was in development and due for a 2011 release. A closed beta version was released on November 18, 2011. A multiplayer mode was added to the beta on January 16, 2012. An open beta version was released on February 16, 2012. The game received a major update before a 2013 Steam release.

&quot;Jagged Alliance Online&quot; won the 2012 Deutscher Entwicklerpreis for best browser game.

&quot;Jagged Alliance Online&quot; was shut down in April 2015. A successor, &quot;Jagged Alliance Online: Reloaded&quot;, was released in May 2015 by Cliffhanger Productions. &quot;Reloaded&quot; was shut down on November 30, 2018.

=== &quot;Jagged Alliance: Flashback&quot; ===

In April 2013, Full Control, a Denmark-based game studio, launched a Kickstarter campaign to fund &quot;Jagged Alliance: Flashback&quot;. The Kickstarter campaign was successful on May 23, 2013, resulting in the game being fully funded including its firsts stretch goal. The game was released on October 21, 2014.

Upon release &quot;Jagged Alliance: Flashback&quot; received mostly negative reviews from both critics and players alike and, as a result of poor sales, the developers of Full Control announced that they would no longer be providing support for the game. Full Control went out of business shortly afterwards due to financial difficulties.

=== &quot;Jagged Alliance: Rage!&quot; ===

&quot;Jagged Alliance: Rage!&quot; is set 20 years after the first &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot;. The game was developed by now-defunct Vienna-based developer Cliffhanger Productions and published by HandyGames on December 6, 2018.

== Other media ==
In March 2007, Strategy First announced that they had penned a deal for the creation of a film based upon the &quot;Jagged Alliance&quot; property. The movie license was acquired by Los Angeles-based Union Entertainment.

On October 20, 2017, Underground Games announced a board game based on the franchise, titled &quot;Jagged Alliance: The Board Game&quot;. The game was originally planned for a 2018 release but this was delayed to 2019. Charles Theel of &quot;Strategy Gamer&quot; gave the game a positive review, saying: &quot;This is a high quality game, full stop.&quot;

<doc id="863296" wikidata="Q16013890" url="?curid=863296" title="Harrison Marks">
<text>George Harrison Marks (6 August 1926 – 27 June 1997) was an English glamour photographer and director of nudist, and later, pornographic films.

==Personal life==
Born in Tottenham, Middlesex in 1926 to a Jewish family, Marks was 17 when he married his first wife, Diana Bugsgang. He worked as a stand-up comedian in variety halls towards the end of the music hall era, in the late 1940s and early 1950s, in a duo called Harrison and Stuart. Marks left the act in 1951 to develop his photographic career, taking pictures of music-hall performers and showgirls. The model and actress Pamela Green was performing as a dancer in a 1952 revue called &quot;Paris to Piccadilly&quot;, a version of the Folies Bergère in London. She became Marks&#x27; lover and began working with him as a model. Their relationship ended in 1961. During the 1960s Marks had a relationship with another of his models, June Palmer, and he married his second wife Vivienne Warren in 1964.

While he was filming &quot;The Naked World of Harrison Marks&quot; he began a relationship with Toni Burnett, an actress and model who made a brief appearance in the film. In 1967, the year the film came out, Marks and Burnett had a daughter, Josie Harrison Marks. Marks&#x27; and Green&#x27;s business partnership was dissolved in the same year, and in 1970 Marks was bankrupt.

In 1971 he was tried at the Old Bailey for dealing in pornography by post. Marks and Burnett married in September 1973, but they split up around 1978. In 1979 Marks began a relationship with Louise Sinclair, a teenage glamour model.

==Glamour photography==
In the 1950s Marks and Pamela Green opened a photographic studio at 4 Gerrard Street, Soho. Marks provided nude photographs for photographic magazines on a freelance basis as well as selling his own stills directly. With the profits from this work, they launched &quot;Kamera&quot; magazine in 1957. &quot;Kamera&quot; featured Marks&#x27; glamour photography of nude women taken in the small studios or Marks&#x27; kitchen. June Palmer began modelling professionally for Marks in the late 1950s and became one of his most famous models. Marks&#x27; 1958 publicity materials contained one of the first uses of the word &quot;glamour&quot; as a euphemism for nude modelling/photography. The magazine was an immediate success and the business expanded to employ around seventeen staff by the early 1960s, selling a number of other magazine titles such as &quot;Solo&quot;, postcards and calendars, and distributing imported French books and glamour magazines. Photographic exhibitions were held at the Gerrard Street studio.

Marks was also the photographic consultant for the film &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960), which featured Green in a cameo role. In the 1960s Marks moved his studio to Saffron Hill near King&#x27;s Cross Station and began selling photoshoots to the American magazine &quot;Swank&quot;. His &quot;Kamera&quot; and &quot;Solo&quot; magazines ceased publication in 1968, with occasional single-issue magazines appearing subsequently.

In later years he supplied photographs to the men&#x27;s magazines &quot;Men Only&quot; and &quot;Lilliput&quot;, and sold photosets to David Sullivan&#x27;s magazines &quot;Ladybirds&quot; and &quot;Whitehouse&quot;.

==Films==
In 1958, as an offshoot of his magazines, Marks began making short films of his models undressing and posing topless, for the 8 mm film market. These were popularly known as &quot;glamour home movies&quot;. His films were available over the counter at camera shops, and also supplied discreetly by mail order from the back pages of his &quot;Kamera&quot; magazine. One Marks 8mm glamour film was &quot;The Window Dresser&quot; (1961), in which Pamela Green starred as a cat burglar who hides from the law by posing as a display mannequin in a lingerie shop. Marks appears in the film as the shop&#x27;s owner; Green performs a striptease in the store&#x27;s display window. Clips from &quot;The Window Dresser&quot; were used in a 1964 piece on the glamour film scene in the Rediffusion programme &quot;This Week&quot;. These clips showed Pamela Green fully unclothed; the ensuing controversy resulted in Green having to defend the film on the BBC Light Programme&#x27;s &quot;Woman&#x27;s Hour&quot;. After a judge threw out an obscenity charge against &quot;The Window Dresser&quot;, Marks continued to make 8 mm glamour films throughout the 1960s.

One such film, &quot;Witches Brew&quot; (1960) features Pamela Green as a witch casting spells; Marks makes a brief appearance as her hunchback assistant. In another, &quot;Model Entry&quot; (1965), a cat burglar breaks into Marks&#x27; studio, strips and leaves him her address. In &quot;Danger Girl&quot;, a stripping secret agent is put into bondage by a Russian spy; the agent breaks free, ultimately throwing her captor onto a circular saw. Even more macabre is Marks&#x27; &quot;Perchance to Scream&quot; (1967) in which a model is transported to a medieval torture chamber. In this film, Stuart Samuels plays an evil inquisitor who sentences topless women to be whipped and beheaded by a masked executioner.

His feature films as a director were &quot;Naked - As Nature Intended&quot; (1961), &quot;The Chimney Sweeps&quot; (his only non-sex feature, 1963), &quot;The Naked World of Harrison Marks&quot; (1967), &quot;Pattern of Evil&quot; (1967), &quot;The Nine Ages of Nakedness&quot; (1969) and &quot;Come Play With Me&quot; (1977), which featured Mary Millington. &quot;Pattern of Evil&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Fornicon&quot;, a heavy S&amp;M film which features scenes of murder and whipping in a torture chamber, was never shown in the UK. Marks implied in several interviews over the years that the film was financed by organised crime.

After directing &quot;The Nine Ages of Nakedness&quot;, Marks endured a particularly turbulent time in the early seventies including bankruptcy (1970), an obscenity trial at the Old Bailey in 1971, and alcoholism. Ironically, a segment of &quot;The Nine Ages of Nakedness&quot; had ended with Marks&#x27; alter-ego &quot;The Great Marko&quot; being brought up before a crooked Judge (Cardew Robinson) on obscenity charges. Marks made ends meet during this period by continuing to shoot short films for the 8mm market and releasing them via his Maximus Films company.

Based at Marks&#x27; Farringdon studio, Maximus was run on a &quot;film club&quot; basis, meaning that clients would have to sign up for membership before purchasing the films, mirroring the way membership-only sex cinemas were run at the time. While his earlier 8mm films largely consisted of nothing more explicit than the models posing topless, late-sixties titles like &quot;Apartment 69&quot; and &quot;The Amorous Masseur&quot; were generally softcore pornography. Marks had been eager to shoot soft porn material ever since the &quot;Window Dresser&quot; case, much to the disdain of Pamela Green, who dissolved their business partnership in 1967. &quot;He was fond of good living and a drink or two, and he wanted to go on to soft porn,&quot; Green told &quot;Tit-Bits&quot; magazine in 1995, adding &quot;there was this one film where he was dressed as a dirty old man and he&#x27;s creeping round Piccadilly Circus, then you see him in bed with this girl&quot;. One Maximus short &quot;The Ecstasy of Oral Love&quot; adopts a pseudo-documentary format, showing a couple frantically licking each other, ending with some relatively graphic oral sex scenes which are inter-cut with ostensibly socially redeeming title cards issuing advice to &quot;young married couples&quot;.

In the mid seventies Marks had begun selling explicit photo sets to adult magazine publisher David Sullivan&#x27;s top-shelf magazines. Evidently Marks had also sold Sullivan the rights to some of his 8mm sex films, as adverts by Kelerfern (a Sullivan mail order company) carried Marks-directed sex shorts like &quot;Hole in One&quot;, &quot;Nymphomania&quot;, &quot;King Muff&quot; and &quot;Doctor Sex&quot; for sale around this period.

While the Marks films offered in UK porn magazines throughout the 1970s appear to have been softcore, and their pornographic nature greatly exaggerated by the advertisements (a familiar trait of David Sullivan), from the early 1970s onwards Marks had begun experimenting with hardcore production. He made short films for a British hardcore pornographer known only as &quot;Charlie Brown&quot;, and began making hardcore versions of his own Maximus short films which were released overseas on the Color Climax and Tabu labels. In later years Marks was reluctant to discuss these hardcore short films and claimed &quot;not to remember&quot; their names. &quot;Arabian Knights&quot; (also filmed for Color Climax in 1979) was shot at the Hotel Julius Caesar in Queens Gardens in Bayswater and features mainstream actor Milton Reid in a non-sex role.

==Other works==
A lover of animals, in particular felines, in the early stages of his career Marks had a sideline photographing cats, and provided the photographs for Compton Mackenzie&#x27;s book &quot;Cats&#x27;s Company&quot; (1960).

&quot;He was an excellent photographer of nudes,&quot; producer Tony Tenser remarked to John Hamilton in a 1998 interview, &quot;but he also excelled in photographs of cats, that were much more beautiful than some of his nudes&quot;. Marks&#x27; cats remained a fixture of his studio and can be spotted scurrying about in several of the 8mm glamour films of the period, occasionally even appearing in prominent roles.

In the wake of the success of his early &quot;glamour&quot; films Harrison Marks also produced a series of slapstick comedies also sold via the photographic shops and magazines that were the outlet for his adult work. As well as directing these films he also appeared as one of the main actors. Titles like &quot;Uncle&#x27;s Tea Party&quot;, &quot;Defective Detectives&quot;, &quot;High Diddle Fiddle&quot;, &quot;Dizzy Decorators&quot; and &quot;Musical Maniacs&quot; were founded in the music hall and classic silent comedy traditions. Needless to say, they were less successful than his girlie films and the competition from the real thing (i.e., the Chaplin, Keaton, and Harrold Lloyd classics that he paid homage to), which provided most of the package film releases of the day.

===Janus and Kane===
In the late 1970s Marks was hired as a photographer for &quot;Janus&quot;, a fetish magazine specialising in spanking and caning imagery. He also produced and directed short erotic corporal punishment films for Janus for the then-emerging home video market. One of these, &quot;Warden&#x27;s End&quot; (1981), starring glamour model and pornographic actress Linzi Drew, shows the exterior and interior of Janus&#x27;s London storefront office at 40 Old Compton Street.

In 1982 Marks left the &quot;Janus&quot; stable to set up his own fetish magazine &quot;Kane&quot; which also featured caning and spanking photos. &quot;Kane&quot; described itself as &quot;The CP Journal of Fantasy, Fact and Fiction for Adults.&quot;

Corporal punishment would now become Marks&#x27; big theme for the final act of his career. According to his official website, Marks&#x27; corporal punishment material &quot;kept him in booze and cigarettes and an acceptable degree of comfort for the rest of his life&quot;. He created the Kane International Videos division and went on to direct (and sometimes also performed in) a number of full-length corporal punishment videos in the 1980s and 1990s. Some of his videos include: &quot;The Cane and Mr Abel&quot; (1984), also with Linzi Drew, &quot;Bad Girls Don’t Cry&quot; (1989), &quot;The Spanking Academy of Dr. Blunt&quot;, &quot;Stinging Tales&quot; (both 1992), &quot;Naughty Schoolgirls Revenge&quot; (1994), and &quot;Spanker&#x27;s Paradise&quot; (parts 1 &amp; 2) in 1992 in which he also acted opposite English porn star Vida Garman.

After his death in 1997, his daughter Josie Harrison Marks took over the editing of &quot;Kane&quot;.

==Biography==

In 1967 Franklyn Wood, a former art editor of &quot;The Times&quot; and the first editor in Fleet Street to run a diary (in the &quot;Daily Sketch&quot;) under his own name, published a biography of Harrison Marks called &quot;The Naked Truth About Harrison Marks&quot;. It was reprinted in 2017.

<doc id="863298" wikidata="Q1088804" url="?curid=863298" title="Chrysler Valiant">
<text>The Chrysler Valiant was a full-size car which was sold by Chrysler Australia between 1962 and 1981. Initially a rebadged locally assembled Plymouth Valiant from the United States, from the second generation launched in 1963, the Valiant was fully manufactured in Australia. It was sold locally but also in New Zealand and South Africa, with smaller numbers also exported to South-East Asia and the United Kingdom.

Parent company Chrysler made a substantial investment in Australian manufacturing facilities by establishing operations in South Australia with an assembly plant at Tonsley Park in 1964 and an engine foundry at Lonsdale in 1968. The Valiant thus established its position as the third of the &quot;Big 3&quot; Australian-made vehicles behind the Holden Kingswood and Ford Falcon.

The Australian Valiant was built on the North American A-body platform but with many parts and components from Australian suppliers. Apart from a sedan and wagon body style, 1965 saw the introduction of a commercial utility that was badged the Wayfarer and later exported to South Africa as the Rustler.

Greater differentiation from the donor car creeped in over time, particularly since the VE series, which was embraced by the Australian motoring press and won the 1967 &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine Car of the Year award. The VF series of 1969 and the VG of 1970 departed even further from its North American donor both in terms of styling and performance—with the latter series introducing the &quot;Hemi-6&quot; engine that replaced the &quot;Slant-6&quot;. Moreover, Australia continued to produce a station wagon model, called the Safari, even after this body style being discontinued for North America.

Beginning in 1971, the VH series saw Chrysler Australia develop the entire lineup locally including the Charger. Local design and production continued until the CM series of 1979, which marked the end of local production in 1981, after the takeover of operations by Mitsubishi Motors Australia.

==First generation==

===RV1 (R Series)===

After the Plymouth Valiant turned out to be a success in the United States (starting with its 1959 introduction), Chrysler released Australia&#x27;s first locally assembled Valiant, the RV1 (R-series). It was officially unveiled by South Australia&#x27;s Premier, Sir Thomas Playford, in January 1962 and was assembled at Chrysler&#x27;s Mile End facility.

The RV1 (or R Series) Valiant was an instant success. Not everyone was taken instantly by the car&#x27;s styling, but the general consensus was that the car had a modern, almost space age quality about it.

Also notable was the Valiant&#x27;s performance with from the 225 &quot;Slant-6&quot; engine. This was a lot of power compared to the competing Holdens and Fords, which offered only and SAE respectively.

Standard transmission in the RV1 was a floor-shifted three-speed manual with a non-synchro first gear. A button-operated three-speed TorqueFlite automatic was optional. Other options included a heater-demister unit, as well as a &quot;Moparmatic&quot; deluxe pushbutton transistor radio.

The RV1 Valiant was the first Australian car to come with an alternator instead of a generator, and instead of coil springs, the Valiant came with torsion bar suspension. Brakes were hydraulic 9&quot; drums front and rear. The RV1 had a simulated spare wheel outline on the bootlid, but the spare wheel was actually under the floor of the boot.

The base model sold for £1299.

===SV1 (S Series)===

In March 1962, Chrysler replaced the American 1961-model R Valiant with the American 1962 SV1 (S Series) Valiant. The SV1 used the same body shell as the RV1, with cosmetic changes including the deletion of the simulated spare wheel on the bootlid, and round tail lamps replacing the R-model&#x27;s cat-eye shaped ones. There was a revised radiator grille and new exterior trim.

Mechanical changes included relocation of the manual transmission shifter to the steering column, new ball joints, and a new gear-reduction starter motor.

10,009 SV1 Valiants were sold, of which 5,496 were automatics and 4,513 were manuals.
==Second generation==

===AP5 Series===

On 30 May 1963, Chrysler Australia produced the first fully Australian manufactured Valiant, the AP5. In February of that year, Chrysler Australia had begun work on its new $36 million Tonsley Park facility in South Australia, where it could boost annual production to 50 thousand cars. The new plant produced its first Valiants on 31 March 1964.

The AP5 (&quot;AP&quot; for &quot;Australian Production&quot;) was an entirely new design with only the four doors, windscreen, and front guards shared with its North American counterpart. Initial cars retained the left-hand-drive wiper pattern but this was soon changed to a RHD layout. The &quot;Slant-6&quot; driveline was retained, but the AP5 was considerably more straightforward in styling than its R- and S-model antecedents. With high local content and specifications optimised for local conditions, this new Valiant strengthened the brand&#x27;s position in the marketplace. A new upmarket Regal version was included in the range. In November 1963 an AP5 Safari station wagon was released. 
Total production of the AP5 range amounted to 49,440 vehicles.
===AP6 Series===


In March 1965, the AP5 was supplanted by the AP6. The body shell was the same, but there was a new grille on the theme of the 1964 North American Plymouth Barracuda, and there was new trim inside and out. The automatic transmission was no longer controlled by pushbuttons, but instead by a conventional shift lever. The AP6 also included other new features such as self-adjusting brakes and acrylic enamel paint, at the time the most advanced auto finish available. The AP6 model range included the Valiant Wayfarer, the first Valiant-based coupe utility to be built by Chrysler Australia.

The AP6 was the first Australian-built Valiant to be offered with a V8 engine – the LA V8, introduced in American Valiants in 1964, and released in Australia in August 1965. The engine developed and pushed the Valiant to a top speed of .

The V8 was only available as a model in its own right, the V8 Valiant, which had a vinyl-covered roof, individual bucket seats, floor console mounted automatic shift lever and two-tone steering wheel.

The &quot;Slant-6&quot;&#x27;s camshaft was also slightly upgraded for improved torque by dint of increased duration and lift.

Chrysler Australia had difficulty meeting demand, with the Valiant being built at Tonsley Park at a maximum rate of 200 cars per eight-hour shift. Customers had to wait up to four months for delivery of a new AP6. Prices ran from $2,500 to $3,650.
===VC Series===


The VC Valiant was introduced in March 1966 and, although underneath it was basically the same car as the preceding AP6 Series, the body was extensively restyled giving the illusion of being longer and lower.

The modern new design was highlighted by sharp, squared-off edges and corners clearly influenced by Chrysler in the United States. The front now had a full-width horizontal grille while the rear was also much squarer with vertical taillights.

The range of models again consisted of the Valiant standard or Regal sedan, standard or Safari Regal wagon and Wayfarer utility. They featured higher standard equipment levels as well as new safety features, such as optional disc brakes on V8 models, which were named &#x27;Valiant V8/Safari V8&#x27; and were essentially Regal models.

The VC Series was built both for its major market, Australia, but also for export to the United Kingdom, as announced at the October 1966 London Motor Show, based on the following range of uniquely named models (brackets indicate the equivalent Australian nameplate):

* Medium Saloon (Valiant equivalent)
* Medium Safari Estate Car (Valiant Safari wagon equivalent)
* Regal Highline Saloon Automatic (Valiant Regal equivalent)
* Regal Highline Safari (Valiant Safari Regal wagon equivalent)
* Premium V8 Saloon (Valiant V8 equivalent)
* Premium Safari Estate Car (Valiant Safari V8 wagon equivalent)

In total, Chrysler Australia built 65,634 VC Series models.

==Third generation==

===VE Series===


This Valiant was an all-new design introduced in October 1967, based on the North American platform, which had a wheelbase. The bonnet and guards were shared with the also-new 1967 North American Dodge Dart, with other styling cues otherwise inherited from the North American Valiant. The car featured slightly larger body dimensions and greater interior space than the preceding VC Series. The roofline was also flattened out and the rear window was given a concave profile.

Higher levels of standard equipment were featured and two engine options became available. The basic &quot;Slant-6&quot; was retained with its rating, but a new 2-barrel carbureted version was released with output of . The 273 V8 was also improved and made available across the entire Valiant range.

Other upgrades included the introduction of a larger fuel tank, shorter gear lever throw on the manual gearbox, relocation of the dipswitch from under the brake pedal to the high left of the firewall, and the windscreen wiper motor was relocated to the engine side of the firewall – greatly reducing wiper noise. All models benefited from additional safety features (some compulsory under new Australian Design Rules, or ADRs) such as dual circuit brakes with a tandem master cylinder, double sided safety rims, front seat belts and front power disc brakes on V8 models.

The VE range consisted of Valiant &amp; Valiant Regal sedans, Valiant Safari &amp; Valiant Regal Safari station wagons and Valiant, Valiant Wayfarer &amp; Dodge utilities, the latter being a lower-priced version of the Valiant utility. The flagship model followed on from the AP6 and VC V8 theme, being similarly equipped with bucket seats, floor shift automatic, and vinyl roof all standard, but was given the new name &quot;VIP&quot; to distinguish it from other models, since the V8 engine option was made available across the range. It also shared the 3 &#x27;sergeant stripes&#x27; of the VC V8 on the rear quarter panel.

The biggest accolade for the VE Valiant was &quot;Wheels&quot; &quot;Car of the Year&quot; in 1967 – the first for Chrysler Australia.

68,688 VE Valiants were built.

===VF Series===

In March 1969, the VE was replaced by the VF model. The new car shared its middle section with the previous VE Valiant, but there was new front and rear styling. The new front end featured a horizontally convex grille, replacing the VE&#x27;s concave design. The front indicators were placed at the top leading edge of the front guards rather than in a more conventional location in the grille or front bumper. This allowed the VF&#x27;s front bumper to be thinner and less prominent, which made the single round headlights look larger, and the front end appeared more aggressive as a result.

Valiant and Valiant Regal models were once again available, and the VF range also saw the introduction of the Valiant Regal 770 and an upgraded VIP model. The VF VIP was introduced two months after the Valiant range and was no longer a Valiant V.I.P. but was now marketed as a Chrysler VIP, in sedan form only. It offered a stretched () wheelbase, with longer rear doors than the Valiant. As with previous model changes, the VF boasted even more safety features including a padded instrument panel and energy absorbing steering column.

A larger version of the LA V8 replaced the 273, taking the V8&#x27;s top speed to . Transmission options remained the same: three-speed manual or three-speed TorqueFlite automatic.

The most significant introduction to the VF range was the all new two-door Valiant Hardtop – essentially, a North American Dodge Dart coupé with the Australian Valiant front sheetmetal and interior trim. At over , it is the longest coupe ever built in Australia. Released six months after the other VF Valiants in September 1969, it was available in Valiant, Valiant Regal and Valiant Regal 770 models.

In mid 1969, Chrysler released a fast four-door named Valiant Pacer. A low-cost, high-power version of the bread-and-butter Valiant sedan, the Pacer featured a high-performance six-cylinder engine and three-speed manual gearbox with floor shifter. Despite a lack of exterior chrome, the VF Pacer stood out with its red and black grille, simulated-mag wheel hub caps, special body striping, &#x27;Pacer 225&#x27; decals, and choice of &quot;Wild Blue&quot;, &quot;Wild Red&quot;, or &quot;Wild Yellow&quot; exterior colours. The sparsely trimmed interior featured high back bucket seats, and distinctive black on white instrument dials with a dash-top-mounted tachometer. Although lacking the V8 of its rivals, the Pacer could reach almost and, at $2798, was $400 cheaper than the base GTS Monaro. The Pacer was powered by a special version of the trusty 225 &quot;Slant-6&quot;. With two-barrel carburettor, high-flow exhaust system, and 9.3:1 compression ratio, it produced . Standard brakes were finned, servo-assisted drum brakes all round, although most buyers opted for the optional front discs. Underneath was Valiant&#x27;s basic torsion bar suspension, lowered by to improve handling and with a front anti-sway bar fitted. A &#x27;Sure-Grip&#x27; limited-slip differential with either 3.23:1 or 2.92:1 ratios was optional.

Contemporary road testers were mostly full of praise for the Pacer, noting there were few cars that could match it on a performance for price basis. &quot;Modern Motor&quot; (May, 1969) took a VF Pacer sedan to in a respectable 10.5 seconds, the in 17.5 seconds and topped out at .

In 1969, Chrysler&#x27;s market share reached 13.7%. In total, 52,944 VF Valiants were built.

===VG Series===


August 1970 saw the introduction of another facelifted version of the VE/VF bodystyle in the VG Valiant. The VG&#x27;s most noticeable difference was the use of rectangular headlamps instead of the traditional round ones (except on VIP models, which used quad round headlamps). The guard-top indicator location was carried over from the VF. The grille was a horizontal, single-plane item, and the taillamps were revised and wrapped around to the body side. Sedan, Wagon, Ute and Hardtop body styles were offered once again as well as the same luxury levels as before.

The biggest announcement to come with the VG Valiant was of the all new &quot;Hemi-6 engine&quot;, replacing the &quot;Slant-6&quot;. The new engine was introduced as a unit with quasi-hemispherical combustion chambers. The &quot;Hemi&quot; name was already legendary in America with Chrysler&#x27;s use of the &quot;Hemi V8&quot;, hence Chrysler Australia&#x27;s marketing leverage for its 6-cylinder offering. The 1-barrel version of the 245 produced and .

The sporty Pacer sedan was available again, but whereas the VF Pacer was only offered with the one power output, the new VG Pacer offered 3 different versions of the new 245 &quot;Hemi-6&quot; engine, though Chrysler Australia didn&#x27;t publish any power output figures for the Pacers. The standard Pacer had a 2-barrel carburettor and produced . Option E31 produced and included a two-barrel carburettor, higher-performance camshaft, smaller fan, and windage tray. Option E34 produced and included a 4-barrel carburettor, high-performance camshaft, dual-plate clutch, manual choke, modified instrument cluster, torque-limiting engine mount strut, larger radiator, smaller fan, windage tray, premium engine bearings, shot-peened crankshaft and connecting rods, and high-capacity oil pump. Option E35 included a 4-barrel carburettor, high-performance camshaft, heavy-duty engine bearings, a dual-plate clutch, torque-limiting engine mount strut, and the ordinary Pacer-spec transmission.

The VG series Pacers were also the first and last to be offered in the Hardtop body style, of which three were optioned with the E31 package and three were optioned with E35 package. No VG Pacer Hardtops were available with the E34 option. Due to Chrysler Australia&#x27;s policy (local content law/government law) of using only locally produced components, and the unavailability of a local four-speed gearbox, the Pacer was offered with only a three-speed floor shift manual transmission.

A total of 46,374 VG Valiants were built.

==Fourth generation==

===VH Series===


Chrysler released the VH Valiant range in June 1971. The VH was the first fully Australian-designed Valiant and was a major change from the preceding VG range – these were larger cars, styled to look even larger than they were. The grille treatment on the new VH range was a direct design descendant from the US Mopars with the central recessed area for grille and headlamps, surrounded by uninterrupted trim on the outer leading edge of the whole assembly. The rectangular headlamps were carried over from the VG model.

The model range of the VH Valiant was quite extensive, starting with the new entry-level Valiant Ranger, and progressing to Valiant Ranger XL, Valiant Pacer, Valiant Regal, and Valiant Regal 770.

Carried over from the VG range, the basic &quot;Hemi-6&quot; 245ci engine was standard equipment for Ranger XL and Regal, but a new version offered and was standard equipment for the Regal 770. The &quot;Fireball&quot; 318 V8 engine was still an option, but only available on the Regal 770 sedan. The basic Ranger sedan featured a new low compression &quot;Hemi-6&quot; 215ci engine that operated on Standard grade petrol. This engine was not available on the other sedan cars in the VH range.

Unlike the VG range, Valiant Pacer was now only available in 4-door sedan form. Apart from vivid paint colours, optional bonnet blackouts and striping, the new Pacer featured a higher performance version of the 265ci engine, with at 4,800 rpm and at 3,000 rpm. The Pacer could run the quarter-mile in 15.9 seconds, get to 100 km/h in 7.6 seconds and reach a top speed of 185 km/h.

In fact, at its release, the VH Valiant Pacer set the record for being the fastest mass-produced four-door sedan with a six-cylinder engine manufactured in Australia, a record which stood for 17 years.

The Pacer&#x27;s days as the VH performance model were numbered, because that same year saw the announcement and introduction of what was to become Chrysler Australia&#x27;s most recognised new car – the Valiant Charger. In total, only 1,647 VH Valiant Pacer sedans were produced.

The new Valiant Charger was unlike anything that had come before and it had the Australian motoring press calling it, &quot;...the most handsome car Chrysler has ever produced, and probably the best looking car ever produced by an Australian manufacturer&quot;. A short-wheelbase, fastback coupe with an aggressive wedge-like stance, the Charger&#x27;s design gave the effect of speed, even when it was standing still.

Chrysler&#x27;s TV campaign for the Charger featured the young adults at whom it was targeted, waving at one as it swept by them and shouting &quot;Hey, Charger!&quot; One of the more memorable TV ads of the time, it created a cliché that haunts today&#x27;s owners. Charger won &quot;Wheels&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year award for 1971 and was widely acclaimed by others in the motoring press, as well as the public.

The Valiant Charger came in four model guises, closely mirroring the existing sedan range – Charger, Charger XL, Charger 770, and Charger R/T. The first of the serious &quot;track pack&quot; R/T Chargers had option E38. Despite being hampered by a three-speed gearbox, it still drew favourable comments from &quot;Wheels&quot;: &quot;We achieved a time of 14.8 seconds for the quarter-mile – on smoother surfaces the Charger galloped away so easily that a best of 14.5 seconds is within reach&quot;. Being a three-speed gearbox, these quarter-mile runs took only one gear change.

The most recognised performance Chargers were the Six Pack cars. The term &quot;six pack&quot; denoted the triple side-draught Weber 2BBL carburettors with which the 265 &quot;Hemi-6&quot; engine – in option E37, option E38, and later option E49 – produced levels of power unheard of on a naturally aspirated six-cylinder at the time. The triple carburettors also made for a distinctive throaty note when under acceleration.

E38 versions of the Charger R/T featured a 265 &quot;Hemi-6&quot; which produced while the E37 was the street tune option made available on Charger 770 and Charger R/T. E38 was a race-ready Charger R/T with the additional A84 Track Pack option, which included a fuel tank. There was also an A87 Track Pack option that included all the race track goodies, but for the larger fuel tank.

In mid-1972, the E38 option was superseded by the more powerful and greatly refined four-speed transmission E49 option. This drew comments from &quot;Wheels&quot; such as, &quot;The raw quivering power is instantaneously on tap and with a ratio for every conceivable situation the Charger just storms through. It would take a Ferrari Daytona with racing driver Jackie Ickx at the wheel to stay with one&quot;. All E49s came with a Track Pack, 21 of which featured the huge fuel tank with dual fillers. The E49 six pack engine came with a baffled sump, tuned length headers, special shot-peened crankshaft, connecting rods, pistons, rings, cam, valve springs, a twin plate clutch and of course the triple 45 mm dual throat Weber carburetors. Chrysler quoted this engine as producing which, in a car, made for rapid acceleration.

The R/T E49 was the ultimate Valiant Charger, and with only 149 built the E49s are still widely considered today as one of the greatest Australian &quot;muscle&quot; cars ever produced. Road tests of the era recorded quarter-mile times of between 14.1 and 14.5 seconds. 0 to in 14.1 seconds was the norm. This compares to times of 14.6 for the next quickest accelerating Australian muscle car, the Ford XY Falcon GT-HO (Phase III).

Although the Six Pack Chargers were the dominant performance players in the VH range, there was another Charger, the , V8 powered E55, that came close. Option E55 was applied to the new Charger 770 SE in August 1972, and this car could reach in 7.2 seconds and complete the quarter-mile in 15.5 seconds – all topped off by a top speed of .

A batch of several hundred VH Charger 770 318 V8s were exported to Japan along with CH sedans. The Chargers had a CH-like nose with VH sheet metal surrounding the CH four headlights and grille, a combination that NZ assembler Todd Motors would later use to create its unique VJ Valiant Regal 770 sedan. The Japanese cars also had air conditioning, side marker lights and separate white reversing lights as well as mirrors conforming to Japanese market regulations.

Overall, Chrysler Australia manufactured 67,800 VH Valiant cars.

New Zealand distributor Todd Motors had assembled the Valiant sedan from CKD kits since the AP5, mostly following the Australian range though with fewer variants and engine choices plus local upholstery. For the VH, it was a little more adventurous, launching a unique-to-NZ Ranger XL sedan as the base model with a two-barrel carburetor version of the 245ci &quot;Hemi-6&quot; engine, no tail lamp trim surrounds or door window brightwork, unique seats and upholstery, and manual or automatic, column-shift transmission. The Regal 770 had the 265ci &quot;Hemi-6&quot;, floor-console automatic shifter, round dials with wood trim in place of the strip speedo and its own unique front bucket seats and trim. The 318ci V8 was optional and a vinyl roof was standard but could be deleted to order. Todd&#x27;s sole locally built Charger model was also to &#x27;770&#x27; trim with the 265ci &quot;Hemi-6&quot; six and three-speed floor shift auto and did not have the bumper overriders standard in Australia. Early runs had one-piece front door glass and hinged opening rear side windows but, due to problems with water leaks and excessive wind noise, this was soon changed to opening front quarterlights and fixed rear side glass. Wagons were imported from Australia, to Australian specification.

===CH Series===
The VH model range also saw the introduction of the new luxury class vehicles, the CH range. The CH was a further longer in the wheelbase than the VH Valiant – – with a total length of . It featured quad round headlamps and a different rear end treatment, and had quieter suspension and higher equipment levels.

The CH (or &quot;Chrysler by Chrysler&quot;, as it is commonly referred to) was a four-door luxury model intended to compete with the Ford Fairlane and Holden&#x27;s Statesman models in the luxury car market in Australia.

Also released in October 1971 was a two-door version of the CH which was called the Chrysler Hardtop, and shared the same wheelbase as the four-door Chrysler, along with the front and rear end treatment.
===VJ Series===

May 1973 saw the introduction of the next model in the new All-Australian designed Valiant – The VJ. Although essentially a facelifted version of the VH Valiant before it, the VJ&#x27;s subtle changes made enough of an impact on the buying public to make it the biggest selling Chrysler Valiant model of all, with 90,865 units being sold.

Externally the VJ Valiant continued on with the VH series body styles, though the VJ reverted to single 7&quot; round headlamps and a new 8-segment grille. VJ sedans also received new horizontal taillights. Although the physical changes were few, many other new features were introduced in the VJ Valiant range, such as electronic ignition, rustproofing and floor-mounted shifters as standard features. Chrysler upgraded equipment levels in July 1974 with front disc brakes, door reflectors, lockable glovebox and retractable seatbelts all as standard features.

While the VJ range still offered sedan, wagon, ute, hardtop and coupe variants, the performance-oriented Pacer sedans and Charger R/T coupes were deleted from the new range. However, a variation of the E37 Six Pack engine (now with four-speed manual transmission) was made available, in the form of option E48, with most of the cars bearing this option ending up being base model VJ Charger coupes. Four VJ Charger coupes were built by special order featuring the VH series option E49 engine. The other carry-over performance variant was option E55, with the 340ci V8 engine option officially remaining as restricted to Charger 770 coupe application only.

In August 1974, a special run of 500 Sportsman coupes were released, based upon the Charger XL model. They were only available in Vintage Red with white body accents. These cars also had a unique white interior with plaid cloth seats and featured a standard 265 engine with a choice of either manual or automatic transmissions.

In New Zealand, Todd Motors was even more adventurous with the VJ. The base Ranger XL and Charger were updated, as in Australia, with similar NZ-only variations as the VH but the VJ Regal 770 was something of a &#x27;parts bin special&#x27; and essentially a merger of a VJ Regal with a CH Chrysler. The nose – also used for several hundred VH Chargers built for the Japanese market – combined the CH&#x27;s four headlamps and grille with VH Valiant sheetmetal (retaining the older, larger, clear park/indicator lamps) while the rest of the body was as per Australian VJ. Inside, new front seats were CH style, with individual chairs forming a bench shape, and a column automatic shifter was now used. Earlier cars had all-vinyl upholstery but cloth was fitted as standard later. New Zealand VJ Regals also had a vinyl roof in black or beige and the panel between the tail lights was also trimmed in vinyl to match – the vinyl trim could be deleted to order.
===CJ Series===

The Chrysler was given a facelift in May 1973 to become the CJ Series. The two-door hardtop was dropped leaving only the four-door sedan to carry on the fight against its Ford and Statesman luxury competitors. The related Valiant hardtop&#x27;s production continued.

===VK Series===

In October 1975 the VK Valiant was released with few external changes from the previous VJ model. The Ranger now had an argent version of the VJ Charger grille, the Charger XL had a white version and the Charger 770 also had the argent grille. The VK Valiant Regal featured a &quot;grille within a grille&quot;. The Ranger sedan, Regal sedan, and Charger all now shared the same tail-light treatment, using a horizontal layout with four chrome contours to keep air flow away and keep the lenses clean. The Chargers were not called Chrysler Valiant Chargers any longer; with the &#x27;Valiant&#x27; name being dropped.

The VK Regal also had blinker repeaters housed in small chrome boxes which sat on top of both front guards. Another unusual option was the Fuel Pacer option from the Chrysler US parts bin which detected low engine vacuum – as under hard acceleration – and illuminated the driver side guardtop blinker repeater to indicate wasteful driving. Inertia-reel seatbelts and slightly different heater controls were introduced on the VK, as well as a combination control stalk for the lights and wipers from the Mitsubishi Galant. The Ranger also got full-length door trims, and carpet was now standard.

VK six-cylinder series engines were the same as the VJ&#x27;s, and the 245 &quot;Hemi-6&quot; now featured a two-barrel carburettor like the 265 variant. The V8s were mainly units, though the remained an option across the entire range. It was not very popular as the mid-1970s saw the trend towards smaller cars with smaller motors. While the &quot;three on the tree&quot; column shift manual gearbox was still available, it was rarely specified (although still popular on Utes) and the three-speed floor change was now gone too. Buyers seeking floor-shift manual could choose the four-speed, which was available on all models but could only be had with a &quot;Hemi-6&quot;, not with a V8.

Late in the VK model run a limited edition Charger called the White Knight Special (option A50) was offered with a factory-fitted front air dam. The changes were mainly cosmetic with running gear being largely stock. There were 200 White Knight Specials made – 100 Arctic White and 100 Amarante Red. 120 were automatics and 80 were four-speeds.

20,555 VK Valiants were produced and production ceased in June 1976. This was because ADR 27A for exhaust emission control became effective on 1 July 1976, and all the car manufacturers used that date as the introduction of a new model to comply with the new standard.

VK assembly did not begin in New Zealand until nearly a year after Australian launch because a 60% sales tax levied on large engine cars, introduced during the 1973-4 oil crisis, drastically slowed VJ sales. The model range in New Zealand was pared down to Regal and Regal 770 editions.

A version of the Regal was manufactured for the South African Police as the SPP package in the late 1970s which featured triple carburetors, an uprated gearbox, uprated differential, and larger disc brakes. Approximately 2000 of this version were built and supplied

===CK Series===

The Chrysler was given a slight a facelift in October 1975 to become the CK series. Production ceased just one year later in October 1976 when the Chrysler was replaced by the Chrysler Regal SE, a prestige version of the CL Series Valiant.

===CL Series===

The CL Series Valiant was introduced in November 1976. Although it used the same bodyshell as the previous VK range, the front and rear ends were restyled. The front end used horizontally arrayed quad round headlamps flanking a central grille. The front guards and bonnet were also reworked accordingly. The new bootlid&#x27;s curved leading edge flowed down to new taillights that sandwiched a simple centre garnish panel. The bumpers, however, were the same units as had been used on the 1969 VF series Valiants.

The Ranger name was dropped; the base model CL was simply called &quot;Valiant&quot;, and the long-wheelbase &quot;Chrysler by Chrysler&quot; was replaced by the &quot;Regal SE&quot;. The CL series Regal was marketed as the Chrysler Regal, in contrast to the Valiant Regal name used from the AP5 series through to the recently superseded VK Series. The CL series was the last to include a Charger model, which – like the previous VK model – was badged and sold as a &quot;Chrysler&quot;, not as a &quot;Valiant&quot; submodel. The CL Charger was generally available in only one trim level, the Charger 770, though a Charger XL was made available to police departments. The CL series also saw the arrival of the panel van variant to compete with similar offerings from rival makers.

Interiors carried over largely unchanged from the VK range, though the Regal SE offered luxurious buttoned-leather seating as an option. Base Valiants continued with the previous Ranger style strip speedometer, while the Regal dash featured recessed circular gauges and clock with a woodgrain finish. The Charger 770 dash was similar to that of the Regal, except it was finished in black and had a tachometer instead of a clock.

The &quot;Hemi-6&quot; and V8 were dropped, and the only engine options were low- and high-compression versions of the &quot;Hemi-6&quot; and the V8. The CL&#x27;s introduction had closely coincided with that of the strict exhaust emission regulations contained in ADR 27A. With the 318 engine, a new emissions control system was introduced: Electronic Lean Burn.

Transmission options were 3-speed manual with floor or column shift, four-speed manual with floor shift, and three-speed Torqueflite automatic with floor or column shift. The automatic was standard equipment with the 318 V8, and optional with a 6-cylinder. The 4-speed was optional for six- and eight-cylinder models. The floor-shift auto option was fitted to most Regals and all Regal SE&#x27;s.

In 1978 Chrysler released a limited edition run of 400 special Regal Le Baron models (option A17). The Le Baron was available only in Silver, with red or blue interiors. The 265 &quot;Hemi-6&quot; was standard, and the 318 V8 was optional.

Valiant and Regal sedans also benefited from the 1978 introduction of &quot;Radial Tuned Suspension&quot; in response to Holden&#x27;s having marketed their suspension as particularly suited to radial tyres. RTS improved the car&#x27;s handling and roadholding significantly, and &quot;Modern Motor&quot; magazine proclaimed that the Valiant offered a better drive than the Holden.

The last special option in the CL range was the $816 Drifter package, available on the Charger. The Drifter package included Impact Orange, Sundance Yellow, Spinnaker White or Harvest Gold body paint, and large side and rear stripes. Drifters in white had additional &quot;strobe stripes&quot; on the bootlid. Engine options were again the 265 six or 318 V8, but the 4-speed manual was the only transmission option. A Drifter Pack was also offered on the Valiant Panel Van and on the Utility.

36,672 CL Valiants – including the last-ever Chargers – were built.

The CL was the last Valiant series assembled in New Zealand – by now the Chargers and Ranger were gone and the Regal and the Regal SE, replacing the 770, were the only models. The Regal SE was the first car to be assembled in the country with standard air conditioning.

===CM series===

The CM was released in November 1978, and was little changed bodywise from the CL model. Only sedan and wagon models were produced.

A sports sedan called the GLX (option A16) was released as a replacement for the discontinued Charger and earlier the Pacer. Its features included a Charger grill and dashboard, special cloth trim, Cheviot Hotwire mag wheels and black door frames. It was advertised as the car &quot;For People Who Like Their Cars Rare&quot;, as it was the last of the sports models and the jewel in the CM series. The GLX could be optioned with a &quot;Hemi-6&quot; or V8.

The computer-controlled Electronic Lean Burn system continued giving favourable fuel economy; when &quot;Wheels&quot; performed an economy test in 1979, they found the ELB-equipped Valiant used less fuel than a Ford Cortina. A Valiant achieved better than in the Total Oil Economy Run.

Production of this car continued after Mitsubishi&#x27;s takeover of Chrysler&#x27;s Australian operations. Mitsubishi could build the car profitably even in small numbers due to its high 97% level of local Australian content and amortised tooling. However, the car was still badged as the &quot;Chrysler&quot; Valiant, not as a Mitsubishi. The profit from the sale of one Valiant was equal to the profit from 3 Mitsubishi Sigmas- by this time the company&#x27;s main seller.

Valiant production ended in August 1981 with production of the CM reaching 16,005 units out of 565,338 units of all models. Eventually, the Mitsubishi Magna was developed to replace both the Sigma and Valiant. Full-sized Chryslers were not marketed again in Australia until the 2005 release of the Chrysler 300C.

==Motorsport==
Although the Charger is arguably the best remembered Valiant in Australian motorsport, earlier models achieved class wins at the annual &quot;Bathurst 500&quot; production car race, something that the Charger never did. A Valiant AP5 won Class D at the 1963 Armstrong 500, a VC Valiant V8 won Class D at the 1966 Gallaher 500 and a VG Valiant Pacer won Class D at the 1970 Hardie-Ferodo 500.
Chargers were raced in the Hardie-Ferodo 500 at Bathurst in 1971 and 1972 with factory support. They gained a best placing of third outright and second in class in 1972. Chrysler&#x27;s policy was to race &quot;Australian made&quot; product, which meant the race cars ran six-cylinder engines equipped with triple Weber carburettors and 3-speed gearboxes. Even skilled driving and good engineering could not defeat Ford&#x27;s legendary Falcon GTHO Phase III with its V8. In New Zealand, however, the Chryslers proved to be virtually unbeatable from 1971 to 1979 at the famous B&amp;H 500-mile (later 1000 km) series at Pukekohe Park Raceway. The most successful drivers were Leo Leonard and Jim Little, who still races his Valiants (mostly pre-65 class).

<text>Prince Diponegoro (, &quot;Dipånegårå&quot;; born Bendara Raden Mas Mustahar, ; later Bendara Raden Mas Antawirya ; 11 November 1785 – 8 January 1855), also known as Dipanegara, was a Javanese prince who opposed the Dutch colonial rule. The eldest son of the Yogyakarta Sultan Hamengkubuwono III, he played an important role in the Java War between 1825 and 1830. After his defeat and capture, he was exiled to Makassar, where he died at 69 years old.

His five-year struggle against the Dutch control of Java has become celebrated by Indonesians throughout the years, acting as a source of inspiration for the fighters in the Indonesian National Revolution and nationalism in modern-day Indonesia among others. He is a national hero in Indonesia.

== Early life ==
Diponegoro was born on 11 November 1785 in Yogyakarta, and was the eldest son of Sultan Hamengkubuwono III of Yogyakarta. During his youth at the Yogyakarta court, major occurrences such as the dissolution of the VOC, the British invasion of Java, and the subsequent return to Dutch rule took place. During the invasion, Sultan Hamengkubuwono III pushed aside his power in 1810 in favor of Diponegoro&#x27;s father and used the general disruption to regain control. In 1812 however, he was once more removed from the throne and exiled off-Java by the British forces. In this process, Diponegoro acted as an adviser to his father and provided aid to the British forces to the point where Raffles offered him the &quot;Sultan&quot; title which he declined, perhaps because his father was still reigning.

When the sultan died in 1814, Diponegoro was passed over for the succession to the throne in favor of his younger half-brother, Hamengkubuwono IV (r. 1814–1821), who was supported by the Dutch despite the late Sultan&#x27;s urging for Diponegoro to be the next Sultan. Being a devout Muslim, Diponegoro was alarmed by the relaxing of religious observance at his half-brother&#x27;s court in contrast with his own life of seclusion, as well as by the court&#x27;s pro-Dutch policy.

In 1821, famine and plague spread in Java. Hamengkubuwono IV died in 1822 under mysterious circumstances, leaving only an infant son as his heir. When the year-old boy was appointed as Sultan Hamengkubuwono V, there was a dispute over his guardianship. Diponegoro was again passed over, though he believed he had been promised the right to succeed his half-brother – even though such a succession was illegal under Islamic rules. This series of natural disasters and political upheavals finally erupted into full-scale rebellion.

== Fighting against the Dutch ==

Dutch colonial rule was becoming unpopular among local farmers because of tax rises and crop failures, and among Javanese nobles because the Dutch colonial authorities deprived them of their right to lease land. Diponegoro was widely believed to be the Ratu Adil, the just ruler predicted in the Pralembang Jayabaya. Mount Merapi&#x27;s eruption in 1822 and a cholera epidemic in 1824 furthered the view that a cataclysm was imminent, eliciting widespread support for Diponegoro.

In the days leading up to the war&#x27;s outbreak, no action was taken by local Dutch officials although rumors of his upcoming insurrection had been floating about. Prophesies and stories, ranging from visions at the tomb of Banten&#x27;s former Sultan Ageng Tirtayasa alleged to be the ghost of Sultan Agung (the first Sultan of Mataram, predecessor of the Yogyakarta and Surakarta sultanates) to Diponegoro&#x27;s contact with Nyai Roro Kidul, spread across the populace.

The beginning of the war saw large losses on the side of the Dutch, due to their lack of coherent strategy and commitment in fighting Diponegoro&#x27;s guerrilla warfare. Ambushes were set up, and food supplies were denied to the Dutch troops.
The Dutch finally committed themselves to control the spreading rebellion by increasing the number of troops and sending General De Kock to stop the insurgency. De Kock developed a strategy of fortified camps (benteng) and mobile forces. Heavily fortified and well-defended soldiers occupied key landmarks to limit the movement of Diponegoro&#x27;s troops while mobile forces tried to find and fight the rebels. From 1829, Diponegoro definitively lost the initiative and he was put in a defensive position; first in Ungaran, then in the palace of the Resident in Semarang, before finally retreating to Batavia. Many troops and leaders were defeated or deserted.

The racial aspect of Diponegoro&#x27;s Java War also made it notorious. Diponegoro&#x27;s forces targeted the Chinese minority in Java in addition to the Dutch, for example the Chinese residents of Ngawi and Bengawan Solo&#x27;s riverbanks. Diponegoro&#x27;s forces mutilated Chinese children, women, and men. The Diponegoro troops despised the Dutch and the Chinese as foreign infidels who had come to pillage Java. The Chinese community&#x27;s relationship with Javanese was never the same after the Java War.

== Capture and exile ==
In 1830 Diponegoro&#x27;s military was as good as beaten and negotiations were started. Diponegoro demanded to have a free state under a sultan and wanted to become the Muslim leader (caliph) for the whole of Java. In March 1830 he was invited to negotiate under a flag of truce. He accepted and met at the town of Magelang but was taken prisoner on 28 March despite the flag of truce. De Kock claims that he had warned several Javanese nobles to tell Diponegoro he had to lessen his previous demands or that he would be forced to take other measures.

Circumstances of Diponegoro&#x27;s arrest were seen differently by himself and the Dutch. The former saw the arrest as a betrayal due to the flag of truce, while the latter declared that he had surrendered. The imagery of the event, by Javanese Raden Saleh and Dutch Nicolaas Pieneman, depicted Diponegoro differently – the former visualizing him as a defiant victim, the latter as a subjugated man. Immediately after his arrest, he was taken to Semarang and later to Batavia, where he was detained at the basement of what is today the Jakarta History Museum. In 1830, he was taken to Manado, Sulawesi by ship.

After several years in Manado, he was moved to Makassar in July 1833 where he was kept within Fort Rotterdam due to the Dutch believing that the prison was not strong enough to contain him. Despite his prisoner status, his wife Ratnaningsih and some of his followers accompanied him into exile, and he received high-profile visitors, including 16-year-old Dutch Prince Henry in 1837. Diponegoro also composed manuscripts on Javanese history and wrote his autobiography, &quot;Babad Diponegoro&quot;, during his exile. His physical health deteriorated due to old age, and he died on 8 January 1855, at 69 years old.

Before he died, Diponegoro had mandated that he wanted to be buried in &quot;Kampung Melayu&quot;, a neighborhood then inhabited by the Chinese and the Dutch. This was followed with the Dutch donating of land for his graveyard which today has shrunk to just . ft.). Later, his wife and followers were also buried in the same complex. His tomb is today visited by pilgrims – often military officers and politicians.

== Legacy ==

Diponegoro&#x27;s dynasty would survive to the present day, with their sultans holding secular powers as the governors of the Special Region of Yogyakarta. In 1969, a large monument Sasana Wiratama was erected in Tegalrejo, in Yogyakarta city&#x27;s perimeter, with sponsorship from the military where Diponegoro&#x27;s palace was believed to have stood, although at that time there was little to show for such a building.
In 1973, under the presidency of Suharto, Diponegoro was made a National Hero of Indonesia.

Kodam IV/Diponegoro, Indonesian Army regional command for the Central Java Military Region, is named after him. The Indonesian Navy has two ships named after him. The first of these was KRI &quot;Diponegoro&quot; (306), a commissioned in 1964 and retired in 1973. The second ship is , the lead ship of purchased from the Netherlands. Diponegoro University in Semarang was also named after him, along with many major roads in Indonesian cities. Diponegoro is also depicted in Javanese stanzas, &quot;wayang&quot;, and performing arts, including self-authored &quot;Babad Diponegoro&quot;.

The militancy of people&#x27;s resistance in Java would rise again during the Indonesian Revolution, which saw the country gain independence from the Netherlands. Early Islamist political parties in Indonesia, such as the Masyumi, portrayed Diponegoro&#x27;s &quot;jihad&quot; as a part of the Indonesian national struggle and by extension Islam as a prominent player in the formation of the country.

During the Royal Netherlands state visit to Indonesia in March 2020, King Willem-Alexander offered the kris of Prince Diponegoro to Indonesia, received by President Joko Widodo. His kris was long considered lost but has now been found, after being identified by the Dutch National Museum of Ethnology in Leiden. The kris of Prince Diponegoro represents a historic importance, as a symbol of Indonesian heroic resilience and the nation&#x27;s struggle for independence. The gold-inlaid Javanese dagger previously was held in the Dutch state collection and is now part of the collection of the Indonesian National Museum. There is doubt whether the Kris is the original Kris of Dipenegoro. Experts think not.

<doc id="863301" wikidata="Q959726" url="?curid=863301" title="Eagle Summit">
<text>The Eagle Summit is a line of subcompact cars produced for two generations by Mitsubishi and sold by Eagle from 1989 until 1996. It was marketed as a captive import by the Jeep-Eagle sales division that was established after Chrysler Corporation purchased American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987.

==Overview==
Use of the Eagle model name originated with the innovative all-wheel-drive AMC Eagle introduced for the 1980 model year. Production continued even after Chrysler purchased AMC, but both the AMC brand and the original Eagle line were discontinued after 1988. The replacements were &quot;badge-engineered products designed, Chrysler said, to compete with hot-selling import cars.&quot;

The Eagle Summit joined the Dodge Colt and Plymouth Colt starting in 1989 as Chrysler wound down the assembly of the subcompact Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni twins. The introduction of the Summit coincided with the release of the Mitsubishi Mirage&#x27;s third generation.

The Eagle Summit was positioned as a subcompact automobile model in the product mix for Jeep-Eagle dealers. Previously, this position was held by the Renault Alliance until it was discontinued following Chrysler&#x27;s acquisition of AMC from Renault in 1987. 

The Eagle Summit line continued through the extent of the Mirage&#x27;s fourth generation, which ended in 1996. The somewhat related Eagle Summit Wagon (a compact MPV) was marketed from 1992 through 1996 and was based on the Mitsubishi RVR.

The Chrysler Neon was introduced in January 1994 and distributed through Dodge and Plymouth dealers. Chrysler officials declared that an Eagle version of the Neon was not planned. This decision meant that Eagle dealers had no competitor to the Neon and, combined with the Summit&#x27;s Mitsubishi heritage, made the Eagle line expendable.

==Year-to-year changes==

===First generation (1989–1992)===
The Summit was a badge engineered version of the Mitsubishi Mirage. In a pairing of the Japanese-built Mitsubishi Mirage and the identical Eagle Summit to test if Lee Iacocca&#x27;s theory was true regarding the preference of a Japanese to an American brand on similar cars, &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; found that American consumers were &quot;not sold on Japanese cars. Quite the opposite. They want to &quot;Buy American,&quot; but the Japanese manufacturers seem to offer more of the type of cars Americans need and at a better price, and from more cooperative dealers.&quot; The Summit was originally manufactured in Japan. Starting with the 1991 model year, the Eagle Summits were also built by Diamond-Star Motors (DSM), a joint-venture between Chrysler and Mitsubishi, in Normal, Illinois.

: 1989: Summit was introduced as a sedan in DL and LX trim, both powered by a 1.5-liter 8-valve four-cylinder engine with . The LX could have a 1.6-liter 16-valve DOHC engine with . The of interior volume classified the Summit into the compact car class, while most of its competitors were still subcompacts. The Summit was also noted for its generous rear legroom. Sales started in August 1988.

: 1990: A low-cost base model was added to the bottom of the Summit line. Added to the top was a new ES, which paired the 1.6-liter engine with a sport suspension, 4-wheel-disc brakes, and alloy wheels with P195/60R14 tires. All models received all-capital lettering on the back.

: 1991: The 1.5-liter engine output increased to due to 4 additional valves (for 12 total). The ES models returned to wheels and disc brakes on only the front. New was the 2-door Summit hatchback; both it and the sedan was available in base and ES trims. The manual transmission was a 4-speed on the base hatchback and a 5-speed on all others; the automatic was a 3-speed on hatchbacks and a 4-speed on sedans. All models featured a new front grille.

: 1992: The Summit Wagon joined the line, and it was a completely different vehicle featuring a high roofline and sliding rear side door. This &quot;crossover&quot; design was actually a rebadged Mitsubishi RVR, thus not related to the Mirage-based Summits. The Wagon was available in DL and LX trims, as well as in a four-wheel drive (AWD) version. The new Summit Wagon was marketed as blending the maneuverability of a small car with the roominess of a minivan with its interior offering high seating positions and removable rear seats. It was designed to attract young families with seating for five.
: Production Figures:

===Second generation (1993–1996)===
The 1993 model year Summits were completely new and featured more room on the inside as well as weighing less than before. The Summit was now based the fourth generation Mitsubishi Mirage &#x27;CC&#x27; chassis platform featuring a multilink rear suspension and the body was given a rounder shape. 

The hatchback body design was dropped in favor of a two-door coupe version, while a four-door sedan joined the Summit lineup.

The Summit Wagon, a rebadged Mitsubishi RVR was classified as a compact minivan, or a compact MPV.

: 1993: As with the Mirage and both Colts, the base 1.5-liter engine remained, paired to a 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic. New was a 1.8-liter SOHC engine, whose optional automatic was a 4-speed. The Summit was offered in sedan and coupe body styles, in both DL and ES trim lines. The RVR-based minivan version, marketed as the Summit Wagon, replaced the Canada-only Eagle Vista wagon.

: 1994: All Summits featured a driver&#x27;s side airbag, replacing one of the motorized seatbelts. The lower-end DL sedan was rebadged LX and inherited the 1.8-liter engine, which was now an option for the ES coupe as well. The ES sedan upgraded to larger wheels.

: 1995: A passenger&#x27;s side airbag on all Summits replaced the other motorized seatbelt, and ES models were renamed ESi. More significantly, the 1994 demise of both Colts left the Summit as the only remaining Mirage clone, and the cancellation of the Mirage sedan at the end of 1994 left the Summit as the only four-door offering.

: 1996: Summit models entered its last model year with new paint colors and seat fabrics.

<text>Argostoli (, Katharevousa: ) is a town and a municipality on the island of Kefalonia, Ionian Islands, Greece. Since the 2019 local government reform it is one of the three municipalities on the island. It has been the capital and administrative centre of Kefalonia since 1757, following a population shift down from the old capital of Agios Georgios, also known as Kastro, to take advantage of the trading opportunities provided by the sheltered bay upon which Argostoli sits. 

Argostoli developed into one of the busiest ports in Greece, leading to prosperity and growth. The municipality has an area of 377.0 km2 and the municipal unit (the pre-2010 municipality) has an area of 157.670 km2. The 2021 census recorded a population of 13,666 in the Argostoli municipal unit, and 23,574 in the municipality in its post-2019 extension.

==Urban landscape==


To the east of Argostoli, at the end of the bay, beneath the aforementioned Castle of St. George, sits the Koutavos Lagoon, a feeding ground for the Loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta). Now a nature reserve, the Koutavos Lagoon was once an almost impassable swamp where mosquitoes and malaria were rife.

During the period of British occupation of the Ionian Islands, Kefalonia&#x27;s governor, General Sir Charles James Napier, constructed a wooden bridge across the lagoon. This was done in 1813 by Colonel Charles Philip de Bosset, a Swiss engineer in the employ of the British army.
Four years later stone arches were added and, after some 26 years, the entire bridge was rebuilt in stone. In continuous use until 2005, this narrow bridge is now closed to traffic, currently undergoing renovation by the Greek Ministry of Culture. Almost halfway along the De-Bosset Bridge stands a stone column built by the British to celebrate their presence.

The coastal road out of Argostoli to the west was known during the Venetian period as the ‘Piccolo Gyro’. Along the Piccolo Gyro, in the Vlikha area facing Lixouri, lie the ‘Swallow Holes’ of Katovothres, a geological phenomenon. Sea water disappears underground and travels under the island, re-emerging around fourteen days later in the Karavomylos area of Sami, having passed through the nearby, underground Melissani lake. The power of this sea water was harnessed, in 1835, to power a water mill. Further along the Piccolo Gyro is the Agion Theodoron lighthouse, named after the small adjacent church. More commonly known as the Fanari lighthouse, this too was built during the British occupation, in 1829. The original building was destroyed in the earthquake of 1953, the recently restored present structure was rebuilt, complete with Doric-style columns, from the original plans.

Buildings that weren&#x27;t shattered by German bombing in 1943 were destroyed in 1953 by the earthquake that razed virtually all of Kefalonia, apart from the Fiskardo area, to the ground.

Opposite the Archaeological Museum of Argostoli are the law courts, originally constructed by the British with stone from the Cyclopean site at nearby Krani. Along Lithostroto, next to the Catholic Church, is a tiny museum (open some mornings and most evenings) dedicated to the soldiers of the &quot;Acqui Division&quot;. A little further along is the Bell Tower, rebuilt in 1985 to house the original clock mechanism.

On the Ionian Sea coast southwest of the town centre is the holiday resort town Lassi, which has several small beaches.

==Subdivisions==
Following the Kapodistrias reform of 1997, communities around the town united to form a larger municipality of Argostoli, which included the settlements of Spilia, Helmata, Kompothekrata, Lassi, Minies and ten former communities: Agona, Davgata, Dilinata, Zola, Thinia, Kourouklata, Nifi, Troyiannata, Faraklata and Farsa. As a result of the 2010 Kallikratis Programme, this municipality became a municipal unit of the municipality of Kefalonia, which covered the whole island. In 2019 three new municipalities were formed on the island, including Argostoli.

The municipality of Argostoli consists of the following municipal units (former municipalities):
* Argostoli
* Eleios-Pronnoi
* Leivatho
* Omala

The municipal unit of Argostoli is subdivided into the following communities. Constituent villages are given in brackets:
*Agkonas
*Argostoli (Argostoli, Kokolata, Kompothekrata, Minia)
*Davgata
*Dilinata
*Faraklata (Faraklata, Drapano, Prokopata, Razata)
*Farsa
*Thinaia (Kardakata)
*Kourouklata
*Nyfi
*Troianata (Troianata, Demoutsantata, Mitakata)
*Zola

==Transportation==
Between the Koutavos Lagoon and the De-Bosset Bridge is the new bus station which connects Argostoli with the other towns and some of the villages on the island, as well as with Athens and Patras. The main ferry port, connecting Argostoli with the mainland (via Kyllini) and Zakynthos (also known as Zante) is next to this building with the Lixouri ferry (once an hour in winter, twice an hour in summer) docking a little further along.

* Car ferry service to Kyllini (mainland) and Zakynthos (Zante)
* Car ferry to Lixouri
* KTEL Bus service to Athens, via Kyllini, Patras and the Corinth Canal bridge
* Infrequent bus service to Poros, Sami, Skala, Fiskardo and various villages en route
* Frequent summer service to Lassi, Airport &amp; Ai Chelis, Lourdas, Ammes, Myrtos &amp; Antisamos.
* Transit bus service is provided between the Airport and the city of Argostoli (only during summer season). There is a public bus stop in front of the terminal building. Tickets can be purchased by the bus driver.
* Scheduled flights to Zakynthos and Athens, charter flight in summer, via Kefalonia Airport
* Taxis from Plateia Valianos and seafront, car and motorcycle/scooter hire

<doc id="863306" wikidata="Q2672742" url="?curid=863306" title="Vote counting">
<text>Vote counting is the process of counting votes in an election. It can be done manually or by machines. In the United States, the compilation of election returns and validation of the outcome that forms the basis of the official results is called canvassing.

Counts are simplest in elections where just one choice is on the ballot, and these are often counted manually. In elections where many choices are on the same ballot, counts are often done by computers to give quick results. Tallies done at distant locations must be carried or transmitted accurately to the central election office.

Manual counts are usually accurate within one percent. Computers are at least that accurate, except when they have undiscovered bugs, broken sensors scanning the ballots, paper misfeeds, or hacks. Officials keep election computers off the internet to minimize hacking, but the manufacturers are on the internet. They and their annual updates are still subject to hacking, like any computers. Further voting machines are in public locations on election day, and often the night before, so they are vulnerable.

Paper ballots and computer files of results are stored until they are tallied, so they need secure storage, which is hard. The election computers themselves are stored for years, and briefly tested before each election.

Despite the challenges to the U.S. voting process integrity in recent years, including multiple claims by Republican Party members of error or voter fraud in 2020 and 2021, a robust examination of the voting process in multiple U.S. states, including Arizona (where claims were most strenuous), found no basis in truth for those claims. The absence of error and fraud is partially attributable to the inherent checks and balances in the voting process itself, which are, as with democracy, built into the system to reduce their likelihood.

==Manual counting==

Manual counting, also known as hand-counting, requires a physical ballot that represents voter intent. The physical ballots are taken out of ballot boxes and/or envelopes, read and interpreted; then results are tallied.
Manual counting may be used for election audits and recounts in areas where automated counting systems are used.

===Manual methods===
One method of manual counting is to sort ballots in piles by candidate, and count the number of ballots in each pile. If there is more than one contest on the same sheet of paper, the sorting and counting are repeated for each contest. This method has been used in Burkina Faso, Russia, Sweden, United States (Minnesota), and Zimbabwe.

A variant is to read aloud the choice on each ballot while putting it into its pile, so observers can tally initially, and check by counting the piles. This method has been used in Ghana, Indonesia, and Mozambique. These first two methods do not preserve the original order of the ballots, which can interfere with matching them to tallies or digital images taken earlier.

Another approach is for one official to read all the votes on a ballot aloud, to one or more other staff, who tally the counts for each candidate. The reader and talliers read and tally all contests, before going on to the next ballot. A variant is to project the ballots where multiple people can see them to tally.

Another approach is for three or more people to look at and tally ballots independently; if a majority agree on their tallies after a certain number of ballots, that result is accepted; otherwise they all re-tally.

A variant of all approaches is to scan all the ballots and release a file of the images, so anyone can count them. Parties and citizens can count these images by hand or by software. The file gives them evidence to resolve discrepancies. 

The fact that different parties and citizens count with independent systems protects against errors from bugs and hacks. A checksum for the file identifies true copies.
Election machines which scan ballots typically create such image files automatically,
though those images can be hacked or be subject to bugs if the election machine is hacked or has bugs. Independent scanners can also create image files. Copies of ballots are known to be available for release in many parts of the United States.
The press obtained copies of many ballots in the 2000 Presidential election in Florida to recount after the Supreme Court halted official recounts. Different methods resulted in different winners.

===When manual counts happen===
The tallying may be done at night at the end of the last day of voting, as in Britain, Canada, France, Germany, and Spain, or the next day, or 1–2 weeks later in the US, after provisional ballots have been adjudicated.

If counting is not done immediately, or if courts accept challenges which can require re-examination of ballots, the ballots need to be securely stored, which is problematic.

Australia federal elections count ballots at least twice, at the polling place and, starting Monday night after election day, at counting centres.

===Errors in manual counts===
Hand counting has been found to be slower and more prone to error than other counting methods.

Repeated tests have found that the tedious and repetitive nature of hand counting leads to a loss of focus and accuracy over time. A 2023 test in Mohave County, Arizona used 850 ballots, averaging 36 contests each, that had been machine-counted many times. The hand count used seven experienced poll workers: one reader with two watchers, and two talliers with two watchers.

The results included 46 errors not noticed by the counting team, including:
*Caller called the wrong candidate, and both watchers failed to notice the incorrect call
*Tally markers tried to work out inconsistencies while tallying
*Tally markers marked a vote for an incorrect candidate and the watchers failed to notice the error
*Caller calling too fast resulted in double marking a candidate or missed marking a candidate
*Caller missed calling a vote for a candidate and both watchers failed to notice the omission
*Watchers not watching the process due to boredom or fatigue
*Illegible tally marking caused incorrect tally totaling
*Enunciation of names caused incorrect candidate tally
*Using incorrect precinct tally sheets to tally ballots resulted in incorrect precinct level results.

Similar tallying errors were reported in Indiana and Texas election hand counts. Errors were 3% to 27% for various candidates in a 2016 Indiana race, because the tally sheet labels misled officials into over-counting groups of five tally marks, and officials sometimes omitted absentee ballots or double-counted ballots. 
12 of 13 precincts in the 2024 Republican primary in Gillespie County, TX, were added or written down wrong after a hand count, including two precincts with seven contests wrong and one with six contests wrong.
While the Texas errors were caught and corrected before results were finalized, the Indiana errors were not.
Average errors in hand-counted candidate tallies in New Hampshire towns were 2.5% in 2002, including one town with errors up to 20%. Omitting that town cut the average error to 0.87%. Only the net result for each candidate in each town could be measured, by assuming the careful manual recount was fully accurate. Total error can be higher if there were countervailing errors hidden in the net result, but net error in the overall electorate is what determines winners. Connecticut towns in 2007 to 2013 had similar errors up to 2%.

In candidate tallies for precincts in Wisconsin recounted by hand in 2011 and 2016, the average net discrepancy was 0.28% in 2011 and 0.18% in 2016.

India hand tallies paper records from a 1.5% sample of election machines before releasing results. For each voter, the machine prints the selected candidate on a slip of paper, displays it to the voter, then drops the slip into a box. In the April–May 2019 elections for the lower house of Parliament, the Lok Sabha, the Election Commission hand-tallied the slips of paper from 20,675 voting machines (out of 1,350,000 machines) and found discrepancies for 8 machines, usually of four votes or less. Most machines tally over 16 candidates, and they did not report how many of these candidate tallies were discrepant. They formed investigation teams to report within ten days, were still investigating in November 2019, with no report as of June 2021. Hand tallies before and after 2019 had a perfect match with machine counts.

An experiment with multiple types of ballots counted by multiple teams found average errors of 0.5% in candidate tallies when one person, watched by another, read to two people tallying independently. Almost all these errors were overcounts. The same ballots had errors of 2.1% in candidate tallies from sort and stack. These errors were equally divided between undercounts and overcounts of the candidates. Optical scan ballots, which were tallied by both methods, averaged 1.87% errors, equally divided between undercounts and overcounts. Since it was an experiment, the true numbers were known. Participants thought that having the candidate names printed in larger type and bolder than the office and party would make hand tallies faster and more accurate.

Intentional errors hand tallying election results are fraud. Close review by observers, if allowed, may detect fraud, and the observers may or may not be believed. 
If only one person sees each ballot and reads off its choice, there is no check on that person&#x27;s mistakes. In the US only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia give anyone but officials a legal right to see ballot marks during hand counting.
If fraud is detected and proven, penalties may be light or delayed. US prosecution policy since the 1980s has been to let fraudulent winners take office and keep office, usually for years, until convicted,

and to impose sentencing level 8–14, which earns less than two years of prison.

In 1934, the United States had been hand-counting ballots for over 150 years, and problems were described in a report by Joseph P. Harris, who 20 years later invented a punched card voting machine,

Data in the table are comparable, because average error in candidate tallies as percent of candidate tallies, weighted by number of votes for each candidate (in NH) is mathematically the same as the sum of absolute values of errors in each candidate&#x27;s tally, as percent of all ballots (in other studies).

===Time needed and cost of manual counts===
Cost depends on pay levels and staff time needed, recognizing that staff generally work in teams of two to four (one to read, one to watch, and one or two to record votes). Teams of four, with two to read and two to record are more secure and would increase costs. Three to record might more quickly resolve discrepancies, if 2 of the 3 agree.

Typical times in the table below range from a tenth to a quarter of a minute per vote tallied, so 24-60 ballots per hour per team, if there are 10 votes per ballot.

One experiment with identical ballots of various types and multiple teams found that sorting ballots into stacks took longer and had more errors than two people reading to two talliers.

==Mechanical counting==
Mechanical voting machines have voters selecting switches (levers), 

pushing plastic chips through holes, or pushing mechanical buttons which increment a mechanical counter (sometimes called the odometer) for the appropriate candidate.

There is no record of individual votes to check.

===Errors in mechanical counting===
Tampering with the gears or initial settings can change counts, or gears can stick when a small object is caught in them, so they fail to count some votes. When not maintained well the counters can stick and stop counting additional votes; staff may or may not choose to fix the problem.
Also, election staff can read the final results wrong off the back of the machine.

==Electronic counting==

Electronic machines for elections are being procured around the world, often with donor money. In places with honest independent election commissions, machines can add efficiency, though not usually transparency. Where the election commission is weaker, expensive machines can be fetishized, waste money on kickbacks and divert attention, time and resources from harmful practices, as well as reducing transparency.

An Estonian study compared the staff, computer, and other costs of different ways of voting to the numbers of voters, and found highest costs per vote were in lightly used, heavily staffed early in-person voting. Lowest costs per vote were in internet voting and in-person voting on election day at local polling places, because of the large numbers of voters served by modest staffs. For internet voting they do not break down the costs. They show steps to decrypt internet votes and imply but do not say they are hand-counted.

===Optical scan counting===


In an optical scan voting system, or marksense, each voter&#x27;s choices are marked on one or more pieces of paper, which then go through a scanner. The scanner creates an electronic image of each ballot, interprets it, creates a tally for each candidate, and usually stores the image for later review.

The voter may mark the paper directly, usually in a specific location for each candidate, either by filling in an oval or by using a patterned stamp that can be easily detected by OCR software.

Or the voter may pick one pre-marked ballot among many, each with its own barcode or QR code corresponding to a candidate.

Or the voter may select choices on an electronic screen, which then prints the chosen names, usually with a bar code or QR code summarizing all choices, on a sheet of paper to put in the scanner. This screen and printer is called an electronic ballot marker (EBM) or ballot marking device (BMD), and voters with disabilities can communicate with it by headphones, large buttons, sip and puff, or paddles, if they cannot interact with the screen or paper directly. Typically the ballot marking device does not store or tally votes. The paper it prints is the official ballot, put into a scanning system which counts the barcodes, or the printed names can be hand-counted, as a check on the machines. Most voters do not look at the paper to ensure it reflects their choices, and when there is a mistake, an experiment found that 81% of registered voters do not report errors to poll workers.

Two companies, Hart and Clear Ballot, have scanners which count the printed names, which voters had a chance to check, rather than bar codes and QR codes, which voters are unable to check.

====Timing of optical scans====
The machines are faster than hand-counting, so are typically used the night after the election, to give quick results. The paper ballots and electronic memories still need to be stored, to check that the images are correct, and to be available for court challenges.

====Errors in optical scans====

Scanners have a row of photo-sensors which the paper passes by, and they record light and dark pixels from the ballot. A black streak results when a scratch or paper dust causes a sensor to record black continuously.
 A white streak can result when a sensor fails. In the right place, such lines can indicate a vote for every candidate or no votes for anyone. Some offices blow compressed air over the scanners after every 200 ballots to remove dust.
Fold lines in the wrong places can also count as votes.

Software can miscount; if it miscounts drastically enough, people notice and check. Staff rarely can say who caused an error, so they do not know whether it was accidental or a hack. Errors from 2002 to 2008 were listed and analyzed by the Brennan Center in 2010. There have been numerous examples before and since.

*In a 2020 election in Baltimore, Maryland, the private company which printed ballots shifted the location of some candidates on some ballots up one line, so the scanner looked in the wrong places on the paper and reported the wrong numbers. It was caught because a popular incumbent got implausibly few votes.
*In a 2018 New York City election when the air was humid, ballots jammed in the scanner, or multiple ballots went through a scanner at once, hiding all but one.
*In a 2000 Bernalillo County (Albuquerque area), New Mexico, election, a programming error meant that straight-party votes on paper ballots were not counted for the individual candidates. The number of ballots was thus much larger than the number of votes in each contest. The software was fixed, and the ballots were re-scanned to get correct counts.
*In the 2000 Florida presidential race the most common optical scanning error was to treat as an overvote a ballot where the voter marked a candidate and wrote in the same candidate.

Researchers find security flaws in all election computers, which let voters, staff members or outsiders disrupt or change results, often without detection.
Security reviews and audits are discussed in Electronic voting in the United States#Security reviews.

When a ballot marking device prints a bar code or QR code along with candidate names, the candidates are represented in the bar code or QR code as numbers, and the scanner counts those codes, not the names. If a bug or hack makes the numbering system in the ballot marking device not aligned with the numbering system in the scanner, votes will be tallied for the wrong candidates. This numbering mismatch has appeared with direct recording electronic machines (below).

Some US states check a small number of places by hand-counting or use of machines independent of the original election machines.

====Recreated ballots====
Recreated ballots are paper
or electronic
ballots created by election staff when originals cannot be counted for some reason. They usually apply to optical scan elections, not hand-counting. Reasons include tears, water damage and folds which prevent feeding through scanners. Reasons also include voters selecting candidates by circling them or other marks, when machines are only programmed to tally specific marks in front of the candidate&#x27;s name.
As many as 8% of ballots in an election may be recreated.

Recreating ballots is sometimes called reconstructing ballots, ballot replication, ballot remaking or ballot transcription.
The term &quot;duplicate ballot&quot; sometimes refers to these recreated ballots, and sometimes to extra ballots erroneously given to or received from a voter.

Recreating can be done manually, or by scanners with manual review.

Because of its potential for fraud, recreation of ballots is usually done by teams of two people working together 
or closely observed by bipartisan teams. 
The security of a team process can be undermined by having one person read to the other, so only one looks at the original votes and one looks at the recreated votes, or by having the team members appointed by a single official.

When auditing an election, audits need to be done with the original ballots, not the recreated ones.

====Cost of scanning systems====
List prices of optical scanners in the US in 2002–2019, ranged from $5,000 to $111,000 per machine, depending primarily on speed. List prices add up to $1 to $4 initial cost per registered voter. Discounts vary, based on negotiations for each buyer, not on number of machines purchased. Annual fees often cost 5% or more per year, and sometimes over 10%. Fees for training and managing the equipment during elections are additional. Some jurisdictions lease the machines so their budgets can stay relatively constant from year to year. Researchers say that the steady flow of income from past sales, combined with barriers to entry, reduces the incentive for vendors to improve voting technology.

If most voters mark their own paper ballots and one marking device is available at each polling place for voters with disabilities, Georgia&#x27;s total cost of machines and maintenance for 10 years, starting 2020, has been estimated at $12 per voter ($84 million total). Pre-printed ballots for voters to mark would cost $4 to $20 per voter ($113 million to $224 million total machines, maintenance and printing). The low estimate includes $0.40 to print each ballot, and more than enough ballots for historic turnout levels. the high estimate includes $0.55 to print each ballot, and enough ballots for every registered voter, including three ballots (of different parties) for each registered voter in primary elections with historically low turnout. The estimate is $29 per voter ($203 million total) if all voters use ballot marking devices, including $0.10 per ballot for paper.

The capital cost of machines in 2019 in Pennsylvania is $11 per voter if most voters mark their own paper ballots and a marking device is available at each polling place for voters with disabilities, compared to $23 per voter if all voters use ballot marking devices. This cost does not include printing ballots.

New York has an undated comparison of capital costs and a system where all voters use ballot marking devices costing over twice as much as a system where most do not. The authors say extra machine maintenance would exacerbate that difference, and printing cost would be comparable in both approaches. Their assumption of equal printing costs differs from the Georgia estimates of $0.40 or $0.50 to print a ballot in advance, and $0.10 to print it in a ballot marking device.

===Direct-recording electronic counting===


A touch screen displays choices to the voter, who selects choices, and can change their mind as often as needed, before casting the vote. Staff initialize each voter once on the machine, to avoid repeat voting. Voting data and ballot images are recorded in memory components, and can be copied out at the end of the election.

The system may also provide a means for communicating with a central location for reporting results and receiving updates,
which is an access point for hacks and bugs to arrive.

Some of these machines also print names of chosen candidates on paper for the voter to verify. These names on paper can be used for election audits and recounts if needed. The tally of the voting data is stored in a removable memory component and in bar codes on the paper tape. The paper tape is called a Voter-verified paper audit trail (VVPAT). The VVPATs can be counted at 20–43 seconds of staff time per vote (not per ballot).

For machines without VVPAT, there is no record of individual votes to check.

====Errors in direct-recording electronic voting====
This approach can have software errors. It does not include scanners, so there are no scanner errors. When there is no paper record, it is hard to notice or research most errors.
*The only forensic examination which has been done of direct-recording software files was in Georgia in 2020, and found that one or more unauthorized intruders had entered the files and erased records of what it did to them. In 2014-2017 an intruder had control of the state computer in Georgia which programmed vote-counting machines for all counties. The same computer also held voter registration records. The intrusion exposed all election files in Georgia since then to compromise and malware. Public disclosure came in 2020 from a court case. Georgia did not have paper ballots to measure the amount of error in electronic tallies. The FBI studied that computer in 2017, and did not report the intrusion.
*A 2018 study of direct-recording voting machines (iVotronic) without VVPAT in South Carolina found that every election from 2010 to 2018 had some memory cards fail. The investigator also found that lists of candidates were different in the central and precinct machines, so 420 votes which were properly cast in the precinct were erroneously added to a different contest in the central official tally, and unknown numbers were added to other contests in the central official tallies. The investigator found the same had happened in 2010. There were also votes lost by garbled transmissions, which the state election commission saw but did not report as an issue. 49 machines reported that their three internal memory counts disagreed, an average of 240 errors per machine, but the machines stayed in use, and the state evaluation did not report the issue, and there were other error codes and time stamp errors.
*In a 2017 York County, Pennsylvania, election, a programming error in a county&#x27;s machines without VVPAT let voters vote more than once for the same candidate. Some candidates had filed as both Democrat and Republican, so they were listed twice in races where voters could select up to three candidates, so voters could select both instances of the same name. They recounted the DRE machines&#x27; electronic records of votes and found 2,904 pairs of double votes.
*In a 2011 Fairfield Township, New Jersey, election a programming error in a machine without a VVPAT gave two candidates low counts. They collected more affidavits by voters who voted for them than the computer tally gave them, so a judge ordered a new election which they won.
*A 2007 study for the Ohio Secretary of State reported on election software from ES&amp;S, Premier and Hart. Besides the problems it found, it noted that all &quot;election systems rely heavily on third party software that implement interfaces to the operating systems, local databases, and devices such as optical scanners... the construction and features of this software is unknown, and may contain undisclosed vulnerabilities such trojan horses or other malware.&quot;

==General issues==

===Interpretation, in any counting method===
Election officials or optical scanners decide if a ballot is valid before tallying it. Reasons why it might not be valid include: more choices selected than allowed; incorrect voter signature or details on ballots received by mail, if allowed; lack of poll worker signatures, if required; forged ballot (wrong paper, printing or security features); stray marks which could identify who cast the ballot (to earn payments); and blank ballots, though these may be counted separately as abstentions.

For paper ballots officials decide if the voter&#x27;s intent is clear, since voters may mark lightly, or circle their choice, instead of marking as instructed. The ballot may be visible to observers to ensure agreement, by webcam or passing around a table, or the process may be private. In the US only Massachusetts and the District of Columbia give anyone but officials a legal right to see ballot marks during hand counting.
For optical scans, the software has rules to interpret voter intent, based on the darkness of marks. Software may ignore circles around a candidate name, and paper dust or broken sensors can cause marks to appear or disappear, not where the voter intended.

Officials also check if the number of voters checked in at the polling place matches the number of ballots voted, and that the votes plus remaining unused ballots matches the number of ballots sent to the polling place. If not, they look for the extra ballots, and may report discrepancies.

===Secure storage to enable counts in future===


If ballots or other paper or electronic records of an election may be needed for counting or court review after a period of time, they need to be stored securely.

Election storage often uses tamper-evident seals, 
although seals can typically be removed and reapplied without damage, especially in the first 48 hours. Photos taken when the seal is applied can be compared to photos taken when the seal is opened.
Detecting subtle tampering requires substantial training. Election officials usually take too little time to examine seals, and observers are too far away to check seal numbers, though they could compare old and new photos projected on a screen. If seal numbers and photos are kept for later comparison, these numbers and photos need their own secure storage. Seals can also be forged. Seals and locks can be cut so observers cannot trust the storage. If the storage is breached, election results cannot be checked and corrected.

Experienced testers can usually bypass all physical security systems. Locks 
and cameras
are vulnerable before and after delivery.
Guards can be bribed or blackmailed. Insider threats
and the difficulty of following all security procedures are usually under-appreciated, and most organizations do not want to learn their vulnerabilities.

Security recommendations include preventing access by anyone alone,
which would typically require two hard-to-pick locks, and having keys held by independent officials if such officials exist in the jurisdiction; having storage risks identified by people other than those who design or manage the system; and using background checks on staff.

No US state has adequate laws on physical security of the ballots.

Starting the tally soon after voting ends makes it feasible for independent parties to guard storage sites.

===Secure transport and internet===

The ballots can be carried securely to a central station for central tallying, or they can be tallied at each polling place, manually or by machine, and the results sent securely to the central elections office. Transport is often accompanied by representatives of different parties to ensure honest delivery. Colorado transmits voting records by internet from counties to the Secretary of State, with hash values also sent by internet to try to identify accurate transmissions.

Postal voting is common worldwide, though France stopped it in the 1970s because of concerns about ballot security. Voters who receive a ballot at home may also hand-deliver it or have someone else to deliver it. The voter may be forced or paid to vote a certain way, or ballots may be changed or lost during the delivery process,

or delayed so they arrive too late to be counted or for signature mis-matches to be resolved.
Postal voting lowered turnout in California by 3%.
It raised turnout in Oregon only in Presidential election years by 4%, turning occasional voters into regular voters, without bringing in new voters.
Election offices do not mail to people who have not voted recently, and letter carriers do not deliver to recent movers they do not know, omitting mobile populations.

Some jurisdictions let ballots be sent to the election office by email, fax, internet or app. 
Email and fax are highly insecure.
Internet so far has also been insecure, including in Switzerland,
Australia,
and Estonia.
Apps try to verify the correct voter is using the app by name, date of birth and signature,
which are widely available for most voters, so can be faked; or by name, ID and video selfie, which can be faked by loading a pre-recorded video. Apps have been particularly criticized for operating on insecure phones, and pretending to more security during transmission than they have.

<text>The Locrian mode is the seventh mode of the major scale. It is either a musical mode or simply a diatonic scale. On the piano, it is the scale that starts with B and only uses the white keys from there on up to the next higher B. Its ascending form consists of the key note, then: Half step, whole step, whole step, half step, whole step, whole step, whole step.

==History==
&quot;Locrian&quot; is the word used to describe an ancient Greek tribe that habited the three regions of Locris. Although the term occurs in several classical authors on music theory, including Cleonides (as an octave species) and Athenaeus (as an obsolete &quot;harmonia&quot;), there is no warrant for the modern use of Locrian as equivalent to Glarean&#x27;s hyperaeolian mode, in either classical, Renaissance, or later phases of modal theory through the 18th century, or modern scholarship on ancient Greek musical theory and practice.

The name first came into use in modal chant theory after the 18th century, when &quot;Locrian&quot; was used to describe the newly-numbered mode 11, with its final on B, ambitus from that note to the octave above, and with semitones therefore between the first and second, and between the fourth and fifth degrees. Its reciting tone (or tenor) is G, its mediant D, and it has two participants: E and F. The final, as its name implies, is the tone on which the chant eventually settles, and corresponds to the tonic in tonal music. The reciting tone is the tone around which the melody principally centers, the term &quot;mediant&quot; is named from its position between the final tone and the reciting tone, and the participant is an auxiliary note, generally adjacent to the mediant in authentic modes and, in the plagal forms, coincident with the reciting tone of the corresponding authentic mode.

==Modern Locrian==
In modern practice, the Locrian may be considered to be one of the modern minor scales: The natural minor with the step before second and the fifth scale degrees reduced from a tone to a semitone. The Locrian mode may also be considered to be a scale beginning on the seventh scale degree of any Ionian, or modern natural major scale. The Locrian mode has the formula:

: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
The chord progression for Locrian starting on B is B, C, D, E, F, G, A.
Its tonic chord is a diminished triad (B = B = , in the Locrian mode using the white-key diatonic scale with starting note B, corresponding to a C major scale starting on its 7th tone). This mode&#x27;s diminished fifth and the Lydian mode&#x27;s augmented fourth are the only modes that contain a tritone as a note in their modal scale.

==Overview==
The Locrian mode is the only modern diatonic mode in which the tonic triad is a diminished chord (flattened fifth), which is considered very dissonant. This is because the interval between the root and fifth of the chord is a diminished fifth. For example, the tonic triad of B Locrian is made from the notes B, D, F. The root is B and the dim 5th is F. The diminished-fifth interval between them is the cause for the chord&#x27;s striking dissonance.

&lt;/score&gt;

The name &quot;Locrian&quot; is borrowed from music theory of ancient Greece. However, what is now called the &quot;Locrian mode&quot; was what the Greeks called the diatonic &quot;Mixolydian&quot; tonos. The Greeks used the term &quot;Locrian&quot; as an alternative name for their &quot;Hypodorian&quot;, or &quot;common&quot; tonos, with a scale running from &quot;mese&quot; to &quot;nete hyperbolaion&quot;, which in its diatonic genus corresponds to the modern Aeolian mode.

In his reform of modal theory, Glarean named this division of the octave &quot;hyperaeolian&quot; and printed some musical examples (a three-part polyphonic example specially commissioned from his friend Sixtus Dietrich, and the Christe from a mass by ), though he did not accept hyperaeolian as one of his twelve modes. The use of the term &quot;Locrian&quot; as equivalent to Glarean&#x27;s &quot;hyperaeolian&quot; or the ancient Greek (diatonic) &quot;mixolydian&quot;, however, has no authority before the 19th century.

==Use==
===Used in orchestral music===

There are brief passages that have been, or may be, regarded as being in the Locrian mode in orchestral works by
* Sergei Rachmaninoff (Prelude in B minor, op. 32, no. 10),
* Paul Hindemith (&quot;Ludus Tonalis&quot;),
* Jean Sibelius (Symphony No. 4 in A minor, op. 63).
* Claude Debussy&#x27;s &quot;Jeux&quot; has three extended passages in the Locrian mode.
* Paul Hindemith&#x27;s &quot;Turandot Scherzo&quot;, the theme of the second movement of &quot;Symphonic Metamorphosis of Themes by Carl Maria von Weber&quot; (1943) alternates sections in mixolydian and Locrian modes, ending in Locrian.
* Benjamin Britten used the Locrian mode for &quot;In Freezing Winter&#x27;s Night&quot;, the ninth song in &quot;A Ceremony of Carols&quot;.

===Use in folk and popular music===
The Locrian mode is almost never used in folk or popular music:

: &quot;In practical terms it should be said that few rock songs that use modes such as the Phrygian, Lydian, or Locrian actually maintain a harmony rigorously fixed on them. What usually happens is that the scale is harmonized in [chords with perfect] fifths and the riffs are then played [over] those [chords].&quot;

Among the very few instances of folk &amp; popular music in the Locrian mode:

* The Locrian is used in Middle Eastern music as &quot;maqam Lami&quot;. In 24 TET, it is possible to create 12 TET scales, and Lami has the same intervals as Locrian.
* Slipknot&#x27;s track &quot;Everything Ends&quot; uses an A Locrian scale with the fourth note sometimes flattened.
* English folk musician John Kirkpatrick&#x27;s song &quot;Dust to Dust&quot; was written in the Locrian mode, backed by his concertina. The Locrian mode is not at all traditional in English music, but was used by Kirkpatrick as a musical innovation.
* Björk&#x27;s &quot;Army of Me&quot; is dominated by a heavy bassline in C Locrian.
* The song &quot;Gliese 710&quot; from King Gizzard &amp; the Lizard Wizard&#x27;s 2022 album &quot;Ice, Death, Planets, Lungs, Mushrooms and Lava&quot; is in Locrian, following the album&#x27;s theme of basing each song around one of the Greek modes.

<doc id="863323" wikidata="Q723564" url="?curid=863323" title="Azekah">
<text>Azekah (, &quot;ʿazēqā&quot;) was an ancient town in the Shephela (&quot;lowlands of Judea&quot;) guarding the upper reaches of the Valley of Elah, about 26 km (16 mi) northwest of Hebron.

The current &quot;tell&quot; (ruin) by that name, also known as Tel Azeka (, &quot;ʿtel azēqā&quot;) or Tell Zakariya, has been identified with the biblical Azekah, dating back to the Canaanite period. Today, the site lies on the purlieu of Britannia Park.

According to Epiphanius of Salamis, the name meant &quot;white&quot; in Hebrew. The &quot;tell&quot; is pear shaped with the tip pointing northward. Due to its location in the Elah Valley it functioned as one of the main Judahite border cities, sitting on the boundary between the lower and higher Shfela. Although listed in Joshua 15:35 as being a city in the plain, it is actually partly in the hill country, partly in the plain.

==Biblical history==

In the Bible, it is said to be one of the places where the Amorite kings were defeated by Joshua, and one of the places their army was destroyed by a hailstorm (). It was given to the tribe of Judah (). In the time of Saul, the Philistines massed their forces between Sokho and Azekah, putting forth Goliath as their champion (). Rehoboam fortified the town in his reign, along with Lachish and other strategic sites (). In a clay tablet inscribed in Assyrian script Azekah is mentioned as being a fortified town, during the time of Sennacherib&#x27;s military excursion in the country. Lachish and Azekah were the last two towns to fall to the Babylonians before the overthrow of Jerusalem itself (). It was one of the places re-occupied by the people on the return from the Captivity ().

==Identification==
Although the hill is now widely known as the Tel (ruin) of Azekah, in the early 19th-century the hilltop ruin was known locally by the name of &quot;Tell Zakariyeh&quot;. J. Schwartz was the first to identify the hilltop ruin of &quot;Tell-Zakariyeh&quot; as the site of Azekah on the basis of written sources. Schwartz&#x27;s view was supported by archaeologist William F. Albright, by R.A. Stewart Macalister, and by 1953, the Government Naming Committee in Israel had already decided upon giving the name &quot;Tel Azekah&quot; to &quot;Khirbet Tall Zakariya&quot;.

In 1838, British-American explorer Edward Robinson passed by the site of &quot;Tell Zakariyeh&quot;, which stood to the left of the modern village bearing the same name (Az-Zakariyya, which was depopulated in 1948 and later settled by the moshav Zekharia). French explorer Victor Guérin thought another &quot;Beit Zecharias&quot; to be the village mentioned in the Book of I Maccabees (6:32), and which he locates further to the east at a place called &quot;Beit Zakaria&quot; (Beit Skaria), a view also held by C.R. Conder who thought the site of the battle between Judas Maccabeus and the Grecian army was in none other than the more easterly &quot;Beit Skaria&quot;. C.W.M. van de Velde who visited the site between 1851-1852 held the view that this Tell Zakariya and its adjacent Kefr Zakariya are not the same as Josephus&#x27; Beit Zacharia, where Judas Maccabeus engaged the invading Grecian army. The matter, however, remains disputed.

&quot;As for Azekah,&quot; Guérin writes, &quot;it has not yet been found with certainty, this name appearing to have disappeared.&quot; Scholars believe that the town&#x27;s old namesake (Azekah) can be seen in its modern-day corruption, &quot;az-Zakariyeh&quot;. In contrast, Conder of the Palestine Exploration Fund had strong reservations about connecting the site &quot;Tell Zakariya&quot; with the biblical Azekah.

In the mosaic layout of the Madaba Map of the 6th century CE (ca. 565 CE), the site is mentioned in conjoined Greek uncials: Το[ποθεσία] του Αγίου Ζαχαρίου, Βεθζαχαρ[ίου] (= [The] site of St. Zacharias, Beth Zachar[ias]). Epiphanius of Salamis writes that, in his day, Azekah was already called by the Syriac name &quot;Ḥǝwarta&quot;.

Modern Israeli archaeologists have noted that, because of the existence of an adjacent ruin now known as &quot;Khirbet Qeiyafa&quot;, and which is situated opposite Socho, not to mention the site&#x27;s &quot;unusual size and the nature of the fortifications,&quot; that there are good grounds to suggest that the site in question may actually point to the biblical Azekah.

==Non-Biblical mention==
Azekah, known to have been built on a mountain ridge, is mentioned in two sources outside of the Bible. A text from the Assyrian king Sennacherib describes Azekah and its destruction during his military campaign.
:(3) […Ashur, my lord, encourage]ed me and against the land of Ju[dah I marched. In] the course of my campaign, the tribute of the kings of Philistia? I received…
:(4) […with the mig]ht of Ashur, my lord, the province of [Hezek]iah of Judah like […
:(5) […] the city of Azekah, his stronghold, which is between my [bo]rder and the land of Judah […
:(6) [like the nest of the eagle? ] located on a mountain ridge, like pointed iron daggers without number reaching high to heaven […
:(7) [Its walls] were strong and rivaled the highest mountains, to the (mere) sight, as if from the sky [appears its head? …
:(8) [by means of beaten (earth) ra]mps, mighty? battering rams brought near, the work of […], with the attack by foot soldiers, [my] wa[rriors…
:(9) […] they had seen [the approach of my cav]alry and they had heard the roar of the mighty troops of the god Ashur and [their] he[arts] became afraid […
:(10) [The city Azekah I besieged,] I captured, I carried off its spoil, I destroyed, I devastated, [I burned] with fire…

Azekah is also mentioned in one of the Lachish letters. Lachish Letter 4 suggests that Azekah was destroyed, as they were no longer visible to the exporter of the letter. Part of the otracon reads:
:&quot;And inasmuch as my lord sent to me concerning the matter of Bet Harapid, there is no one there. And as for Semakyahu, Semayahu took him and brought him up to the city. And your servant is not sending him there any[more -], but when morning comes round [-]. And may (my lord) be apprised that we are watching for the fire signals of Lachish according to all the signs which my lord has given, because we cannot see Azeqah.&quot;

===Tell Zakariya===
Conder and Kitchener, citing Sozomenus (&quot;Rel. Pal.&quot;, p. 753), mention the non-biblical site of &quot;Caphar Zachariah&quot; () being in the region of Eleutheropolis, and conclude that this would point to the village Zakariya near Tell Zakariya. Theodosius, archdeacon and pilgrim to the Holy Land, produced a Latin map and itinerary of his travels in Palestine, entitled &quot;De Situ Terrae Sanctae&quot; ca. 518-530, in which he wrote: &quot;De Eleutheropoli usque in locum, ubi iacet sanctus Zacharias, milia VI&quot; [= &quot;From Beit Gubrin, as far as to the place where lies the holy [prophet], Zechariah, there are 6 milestones&quot;]. Israeli archaeologist Yoram Tsafrir has identified this &quot;resting place of the holy Zechariah&quot; with the nearby Arab village of the same name, Az-Zakariyya, north of Beit Gubrin. Tsafrir notes that Theodosius&#x27; location corresponds with the &quot;Beth Zechariah&quot; inscribed on the Madaba Map, and which site is placed alongside of &quot;Saphitha&quot; (now Kh. es-Safi). J. Gildemeister reasons that one can ask whether it (Kefar Zakariah) is the same place that appears in distorted forms (e.g. Beit Zachariah) in other writings. Robinson thought that Zakariyeh, as applied to a village, referred here to the site of the Caphar Zechariæ mentioned by Sozomen in the region of Eleutheropolis. Most scholars point to the other Khirbet Beit Zakariyyah, towards the east (grid 1617.1190), as the burial place of the said Zachariah, having been found there the ruins of a Byzantine church now turned mosque, and which church is thought to be featured in the Madaba Map.
==Archaeological findings==
PEF researcher, C.W. Wilson, concluded in 1899 that &quot;Tell Zakariya&quot; was occupied at an early pre-Israelite period, and that it was probably deserted soon after the Roman occupation. The wall which encircles the old ruin shows signs of having been several times rebuilt. In cut and design, the stones appear to have been of Maccabean construction.

PEF surveyors, Conder and Kitchener, described the ruin in their &quot;magnum opus&quot;, the &quot;Survey of Western Palestine&quot;, saying that they noted on the south-side of the summit an ancient olive-press, among other ruins.

Excavations by the English archaeologists Frederick J. Bliss and R. A. Stewart Macalister in the period 1897-1900 at Tel Azekah revealed a fortress, water systems, hideout caves used during Bar Kokhba revolt and other antiquities, such as LMLK seals. The principal areas of excavation were on the summit&#x27;s southwestern extremity, where were found the foundations of three towers; the southeastern corner of the &quot;tell&quot;, where the fortress was located and built primarily of hewn stones; and at an experimental pit located in the center of the summit. Azekah was one of the first sites excavated in the Holy Land and was excavated under the Palestine Exploration Fund for a period of 17 weeks over the course of three seasons. At the close of their excavation Bliss and Macalister refilled all of their excavation trenches in order to preserve the site. The site is located on the grounds of a Jewish National Fund park, Britannia Park.

In 2008 and 2010, a survey of the site was conducted by Oded Lipschits, Yuval Gadot, and Shatil Imanuelov, on behalf of Tel-Aviv University&#x27;s Institute of Archaeology.

The Lautenschläger Azekah Expedition, part of the regional Elah Valley Project, commenced in the summer of 2012. It is directed by Prof. Oded Lipschits of the Institute of Archaeology of Tel Aviv University, together with Dr Yuval Gadot of TAU and with Prof. Manfred Oeming of Heidelberg University. and is a consortium of over a dozen universities from Europe, North America, and Australia. In its first season 300 volunteers worked for six weeks and uncovered walls, installations, and many hundreds of artifacts. As part of the Jewish National Fund park, whenever possible structures will be conserved and displayed to the public.

<doc id="863329" wikidata="Q869645" url="?curid=863329" title="Creem">
<text>Creem (often stylized in all caps) is an American rock music magazine and entertainment company, founded in Detroit, whose initial print run lasted from 1969 to 1989. It was first published in March 1969 by Barry Kramer and founding editor Tony Reay. Influential critic Lester Bangs served as the magazine&#x27;s editor from 1971 to 1976. It suspended production in 1989 but attained a short-lived renaissance in the early 1990s as a tabloid. In June 2022, &quot;Creem&quot; was relaunched as a digital archive, website, weekly newsletter, and quarterly print edition.

The magazine is noted for having been an early champion of various heavy metal, punk rock, new wave and alternative bands, especially bands based in Detroit. The term &quot;punk rock&quot; was coined in the May 1971 issue of &quot;Creem,&quot; in Dave Marsh&#x27;s &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; column about ? and the Mysterians. That same issue is sometimes credited with having originated the term &quot;heavy metal&quot; as well; in fact, the term had been used earlier, though &quot;Creem&quot; did help to popularize the term throughout the 1970s.

==History==
In the winter of 1969, Barry Kramer owned the Detroit record store Full Circle, as well as Mixed Media, a head shop/bookstore, and was an unsuccessful concert promoter and band manager. After the local alternative paper rejected a concert review he had written, he decided to start publishing his own paper. Tony Reay, a clerk at Kramer&#x27;s record store, became its first editor, and came up with its name, a tribute to his favorite band, Cream. Charlie Auringer became the photo editor and designer, and Dave Marsh joined soon after at age 19. The first issue was distributed only in Detroit, as a tabloid-sized newspaper, but then a deal was struck with a distributor. Many copies were ordered by porn shops who were confused by the faintly suggestive title, and who displayed it next to the similarly sized &quot;Screw&quot; magazine. Richard &quot;Ric&quot; Siegel became circulation director, &quot;Creem&quot; become a glossy color magazine sized for newsstand distribution, and within two years had secured a national distribution deal.

For the magazine&#x27;s first two years, its offices were at 3729 Cass Avenue in Detroit. An armed robbery of the offices prompted Kramer to move the operation to a 120-acre farm in Walled Lake, Michigan, at 13 Mile and Haggerty Roads. Just before the move, Lester Bangs was hired, originally to write a feature on Alice Cooper. He had been fired from the rival music magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; by publisher Jann Wenner for &quot;disrespecting musicians&quot; after a particularly harsh review of the group Canned Heat. Bangs fell in love with Detroit, calling it &quot;rock&#x27;s only hope&quot;, and remained there for five years.

Many of the staff members lived in the Walled Lake farmhouse, where there were occasional physical altercations between writers. One day, Marsh, who objected to Bangs&#x27; poorly housebroken dog, placed the dog&#x27;s dung on Bangs&#x27; typewriter. This resulted in a fistfight that gave Marsh a gash on his head. Eventually, the magazine was successful enough to move to editorial offices in downtown Birmingham, Michigan. In 1971, Bangs became editor, and in 1976 he left the magazine; he never wrote for it again. On January 29, 1981, Kramer died of an accidental overdose of nitrous oxide. A year later, on April 30, 1982, Bangs died in New York City of an accidental Darvon overdose.

The magazine&#x27;s offices were geographically separated from most of the entertainment industry in the United States, which was then primarily based in Hollywood and New York City. It was known for its irreverent, deprecatory and humorous tone, and became famous for its comical photo captions, which poked fun at rock stars, the industry, and even the magazine itself. The magazine dubbed the tall Plexiglas pyramid that was presented to the winner of the annual American Music Award &quot;the Object From Space&quot;, and said it was endowed with the power to force celebrities to look ridiculous while holding it. Because of the magazine&#x27;s location, it was among the first national publications to provide in-depth coverage of many popular Detroit-area artists, such as Bob Seger, Mitch Ryder, Alice Cooper, The MC5, The Stooges, Iggy Pop, and Parliament-Funkadelic, as well as other Midwestern acts such as Raspberries and Cheap Trick.

==Influence==

By the mid-1970&#x27;s &quot;Creem&quot; had a circulation of over 200,000, making it the second largest rock magazine after &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. 
&quot;Creem&quot; picked up on punk rock and new wave movements early on. &quot;Creem&quot; gave exposure to artists like Lou Reed, David Bowie, Roxy Music, Blondie, and The New York Dolls before the mainstream press. In the 1980s, it provided early coverage of upcoming rock bands such as R.E.M., The Replacements, The Smiths, The Go-Go&#x27;s and The Cure. It was also among the first to praise metal acts like Motörhead, Judas Priest, and Van Halen. It also focused on Detroit acts.

Melvins guitarist Roger &quot;Buzz&quot; Osborne taught Kurt Cobain about punk by loaning him records and old copies of &quot;Creem&quot;.

Alice Cooper referenced the magazine in his song &quot;Detroit City&quot; – &quot;But the Riff kept a Rockin&#x27;, the &quot;Creem&quot; kept a-talkin&#x27;, and the streets still smokin&#x27; today&quot;. Thurston Moore of Sonic Youth said: &quot;Having a certain sense of humor in the rock&#x27;n&#x27;roll culture – &quot;CREEM&quot; nailed it in a way that nobody else was. It informed a lot of people&#x27;s sensibilities.&quot;

==Staff==
Publishers, editors and writers for &quot;Creem&quot; included Barry Kramer, his partner (later his wife) Connie Warren Kramer, Lester Bangs, Dave Marsh, Billy Altman, Bob Fleck, John Morthland, Ben Edmonds, Ed Ward, Richard Riegel, Ric Siegel, Robert Christgau, Richard Meltzer, Nick Tosches, Greil Marcus, Jeffrey Morgan, Lisa Robinson, Richard C. Walls, Rob Tyner, Patti Smith, Peter Laughner, Cameron Crowe, Trixie A. Balm (a.k.a. Lauren Agnelli), Laura Levine, Judy Adams, Jaan Uhelszki, Penny Valentine, Susan Whitall, John &quot;The Mad&quot; Peck, John Mendelsohn, Mike Gormley, Sylvie Simmons, Gregg Turner, Chuck Eddy, Mark J. Norton, Alan Niester, Robert Duncan, Alan Madlane (as Alan Madeleine), Judy Wieder, Colman Andrews, Jim Esposito, Dave DiMartino, Bill Holdship and John Kordosh. These last three edited the final versions of &quot;Creem&quot; in the 1980s.

The magazine moved its office to Los Angeles in January 1987. Holdship and Kordosh were both involved in &quot;Creem&quot;&#x27;s move to Los Angeles after it was purchased by Arnold Levitt, but both had already left the magazine before its move to New York City after Levitt licensed the name to a publisher there, and its ultimate demise. Before licensing &quot;Creem&quot; to the New Yorkers, Levitt made Judy Wieder editor-in-chief of a heavy metal version of &quot;Creem&quot;, called &quot;Creem Metal&quot;, which was originally edited by DiMartino, Holdship and Kordosh and which sold well. 

A young female audience-targeted spinoff, &quot;Creem Rock-Shots&quot;, was also published, as were countless special editions throughout the 1980s. Former William Morris agent, musician and journalist Mark J. Petracca (aka Dusty Wright) became the editor during its New York residence over 1992–93. Chris Nadler was the last editor before the magazine was shut down. Steve Peters and David Sprague were the final members remaining in the original editorial chain that reached back to 1969.

==Graphic design==
The &quot;Creem&quot; logo was designed by Bob Wilson, who also wrote a regular comic strip, &quot;Mike and Barney&quot;. The &quot;Mr. Dream Whip&quot; and &quot;Boy Howdy&quot; icons were designed by underground cartoonist Robert Crumb. Both appeared on the cover of the second issue as a black and white drawing titled &quot;Detroit 1969&quot;. For the December 1971 issue, Wilson colored the drawing, which appeared in every following issue in a &quot;Creem&#x27;s Profiles&quot;, a parody of the then-popular &quot;Dewar&#x27;s Profiles&quot;, featuring musicians and bands holding cans of &quot;Boy Howdy&quot; beer.

==Change of ownership and disputes==
Ownership of the magazine, trademark and intellectual property has changed hands numerous times since the death of publisher Barry Kramer in 1981, and the magazine&#x27;s subsequent bankruptcy.

Arnold Levitt bought the rights to the magazine in 1986 from Connie Kramer, and added titles including one devoted exclusively to metal along with numerous monthly special editions, before shutting down in 1989. In 1990, he licensed it to a group of Florida investors who published a bimonthly glossy tabloid version, but it was not successful either.

The release of writer and director Cameron Crowe&#x27;s semi-autobiographical film &quot;Almost Famous&quot; in 2000, and Philip Seymour Hoffman&#x27;s portrayal of editor Lester Bangs, rekindled interest in &quot;Creem&quot; and rock journalism of the era. Former &quot;Creem&quot; photographer Robert Matheu formed Creem Media in 2001 with his cousin Jason Turner and Michigan businessman Ken Kulpa. They negotiated a five-year licensing deal with Levitt, with the option to purchase the magazine&#x27;s intellectual property rights for $100,000. There was talk about a quarterly print publication in 2011. They launched a website and generated new content, primarily to maintain the brand.

As the five-year deadline of the licensing deal approached, Matheu sought investors, and got a $52,500 investment from Los Angeles disk jockey Chris Carter and Barry Kramer&#x27;s son J.J. Kramer. Matheu provided the balance of the $100,000.

* Carter and Kramer claim that they were verbally promised one-third of Creem Media for their investment by Matheu.
* Turner and Kulpa claim they were never consulted about the deal, and never approved it.
* Matheu claims he never promised Carter and Kramer such a large share for their investment.

In 2007, Kramer sued in New York County and won, as the Court ruled that Creem Media could take no action without the approval of Carter and Kramer.

Creem Media was sued by T.A. Riggs Licensing LLC in 2010 for breach of contract. Creem Media lost that suit, and Riggs was awarded $575,000. Creem Media was either unable or unwilling to pay. In November 2011, Creem Media attempted to have the judgment set aside, but in January 2012, the Court upheld the Judgment. In February 2012, the Court appointed a Receiver to seize all of Creem Media&#x27;s assets to help satisfy the outstanding judgment. The Receiver then transferred all of the Intellectual Property from Creem Media, Inc to Riggs. CREEM International, Inc purchased the assets from Riggs to become the new successor company with all rights of ownership.

Matheu tired of the legal battle and resigned from the board of Creem Media in 2009. Creem Media, Inc. became defunct shortly thereafter.

In 2017, a group headed by Kramer acquired the &quot;Creem&quot; brand and its archives.

==&quot;Creem&quot; documentary==
In 2019, the Kramer-led Boy Howdy Productions, in partnership with Muse Production House and New Rose Films, wrapped production on a &quot;Creem&quot; documentary entitled &quot;CREEM: America&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Magazine&quot;, which world premiered at SXSW 2019 to rave reviews. In February 2020, the film was acquired by Greenwich Entertainment and subsequently released online through paid virtual cinema streaming rental in August 2020.

==2022 relaunch==
Following years of litigation, the relaunch of &quot;Creem&quot; was announced on June 1, 2022, by JJ Kramer, an IP attorney and son of founder Barry Kramer. Management includes former &quot;Vice&quot; publisher John Martin as CEO, VP of content Fred Pessaro (&quot;Vice&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot;, &quot;BrooklynVegan&quot;), former &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; copy chief Dan Morrissey as executive editor and original staffer Jaan Uhelszki as editor-at-large. 

The relaunched &quot;Creem&quot; includes digital archives of all 224 issues of the original magazine, a website and weekly newsletter called &quot;Fresh Creem&quot;, and a quarterly oversized glossy print edition, which commenced publication in the fall of 2022, on a subscription-only basis, with no newsstand sales.

=== Summer Sunburn concerts ===
The relaunched &quot;Creem&quot; hosts annual live concert events in New York City called &quot;Summer Sunburn.&quot; The 2023 version, held at Roberta&#x27;s in Bushwick, Brooklyn, included a performance by Philadelphia-based shoegaze band Nothing. The 2024 Summer Sunburn concert, also held at Roberta&#x27;s, featured a performance by hardcore band Pissed Jeans.

<doc id="863333" wikidata="Q1237726" url="?curid=863333" title="Dominicus Gundissalinus">
<text>Dominicus Gundissalinus, also known as Domingo Gundisalvi or Gundisalvo ( 1115 – after 1190), was a philosopher and translator of Arabic to Medieval Latin active in Toledo, Spain. Among his translations, Gundissalinus worked on Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;Liber de philosophia prima&quot; and &quot;De anima&quot;, Ibn Gabirol&#x27;s &quot;Fons vitae&quot;, and al-Ghazali&#x27;s &quot;Summa theoricae philosophiae&quot;, in collaboration with the Jewish philosopher Abraham Ibn Daud and Johannes Hispanus. As a philosopher, Gundissalinus crucially contributed to the Latin assimilation of Arabic philosophy, being the first Latin thinker in receiving and developing doctrines, such as Avicenna&#x27;s modal ontology or Ibn Gabirol&#x27;s universal hylomorphism, that would soon be integrated into the thirteenth-century philosophical debate.

==Life==
Born in Castile around 1115–1125, Gundissalinus received his education in Chartres, supposedly following the teaching of William of Conches and Thierry of Chartres. Since 1148, Gundissalinus is in Castile: the capitular archives of Segovia refer to him as archdeacon of Cuéllar, a small town not far from Segovia, where he presumably spent around 14 years, regarding which almost no information is available. Following Ibn Daud&#x27;s request to the archbishop of Toledo, John II, to start a series of translations into Latin of Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;Kitab al-Shifāʾ&quot;, Gundissalinus moved to Toledo in 1161–1162, where he worked with Ibn Daud on the translation of Avicenna&#x27;s &quot;De anima&quot;, realised before 1166.

Gundissalinus remained in Toledo for twenty years, collaborating with Abraham Ibn Daud and Johannes Hispanus to the realisation of around twenty translations of Arabic works into Latin. In the Castilian capital, Gundissalinus also wrote his philosophical treatises. The Toledan chapter names Gundissalinus for the last time in 1178 but he presumably remained in Toledo at least until 1181, when a document written in Arabic mentions his name.

The last record witnessing Gundissalinus alive is the report of a meeting between the chapters of Segovia and Burgos, held in Segovia in 1190. It is probable that the last years of Gundissalinus&#x27;s life were spent in that Castilian town, and he died sometime after 1190.

==Translations of Gundissalinus==
Together with Avendauth, that is, Abraham ibn Daud, and Iohannes Hispanus, Gundissalinus translated around twenty philosophical works from Arabic to Latin, which decisively marked the passage from Platonism to Aristotelianism typical of Latin speculation of the 13th century. Translations traditionally attributed to Gundissalinus are:

Alexander of Aphrodisias, De intellectu et intellecto
al-Farabi, De intellectu et intellecto
al-Kindi, De intellectu
Avicenna, De anima seu sextus naturalium
Avicenna, De convenientia et differentia subiectorum
al-Farabi, Exposición del V libro de los Elementa de Euclide
pseudo al-Kindi, Liber introductorius in artem logicae
pseudo al-Farabi, De ortu scientiarum
Isaac Israeli ben Solomon, Liber de definitionibus
Avicenna, Logica
Avicenna, De universalibus
Al-Ghazali, Logica
Avicena, Liber de philosophia prima
Avicena, Liber primus naturalium, tractatus primus
Avicenna, Liber primus naturalium, tractatus secundus
al-Ghazali, Metaphysica
Avicebron, Fons vitae
Pseudo-Avicena, Liber caeli et mundi
al-Farabi, Liber exercitationis ad viam felicitatis
al-Farabi, Fontes quaestionum
Avicenna, Prologus discipuli et capitula
Avicenna, De viribus cordis

==Works==
Dominicus Gundissalinus also wrote five philosophical works, in which he embraces the ideas of Avicenianna and al-Gabirol, combining them with the Latin philosophical tradition, and particularly Boethius together with some authors of his time, such as the philosophers of the School of Chartres or Herman of Carinthia. Gundissalinus&#x27; treatises show his deep knowledge of Arabic-Hebrew philosophy, and there are the three philosophical disciplines that characterize his thought: metaphysics, epistemology and psychology. The five treatises of Dominicus Gundissalinus are:

* De divisione philosophiae – is an epistemological treatise in which Gundissalinus proposes his division of philosophy into various scientific disciplines, structured hierarchically. In this work, Gundissalinus combines the divisions of al-Farabi and Avicenna with the classifications of knowledge of Isidore of Seville and Boethius. It had a prolific diffusion and reception in Latin land.
* De scientiis – this is a Gundisalvian revision of al-Farabi&#x27;s work of the same name, very similar to De divisione, although the latter manifests a higher level of philosophical analysis and critical reception of Latin sources.
* De anima – De anima is a treatise on psychology in which Gundissalinus mainly welcomes Avicenna&#x27;s De anima, often modifying the speculative results that could be problematic for Latin reflection, and ibn Gabirol&#x27;s Fons Vitae.
* De unitate et uno – brief metaphysical and ontological treatise where Gundissalinus examines the onto-metaphysical and theological doctrine of the One, following the Arabic-Hebrew and Latin Neoplatonic tradition, and in particular the perspective of ibn Gabirol.
* De processione mundi – work of maturity, here Gundissalinus analyzes the generation of creation from the prima cause, following the various logical-ontological distinctions that are specified in the progressive unions of matter and form, until the generation of sentient creatures. In this treatise, the doctrine of universal hylemorphism inherited from ibn Gabirol and of which Gundissalinus is one of the main supporters, plays a fundamental role.

In addition to these five treatises, on which scholars agree, the De immortalitate animae has also been traditionally attributed to Gundissalinus, a text that the majority of the academic community nevertheless attributes to William of Auvergne. Gundissalinus&#x27; works were well received. both in the Latin philosophical field, and in the Hebrew.

<text>The Dodge Colt is a subcompact car manufactured by Mitsubishi Motors and marketed by Dodge for model years 1971 to 1994 as a captive import. Rebadged variants included the Plymouth Champ and Plymouth Colt, both were marketed by Plymouth.

The Colt was initially a rebadged variant of the rear-wheel drive Galant and Lancer families before shifting to the smaller front-wheel drive Mitsubishi Mirage subcompacts in 1979.


==First generation (1971–1973)==

Introduced in 1970 as a 1971 model, the first generation Dodge Colt was a federalized first-generation Mitsubishi Colt Galant. Available as a 2-door pillared coupe, 2-door hardtop coupe, 4-door sedan, and 5-door wagon, the Colt had a 4-cylinder engine. The unibody layout was traditional, front engine and rear-wheel drive with MacPherson struts in front and a live rear axle. Standard transmission was a 4-speed manual, with a 3-speed automatic being an option. The engine was initially rated for , but dropped to in 1972 when manufacturers revised the method of measuring horsepower from gross to SAE net. For 1973, a GT hardtop coupe model was added featuring rally stripes, sport wheels, and a center console amongst other features. The Dodge Colt was Chrysler&#x27;s response to the AMC Gremlin, Ford Pinto, and Chevrolet Vega. As a captive import from Mitsubishi, the Colt also competed directly with other Japanese imports, such as the Toyota Corolla, Honda Civic and Datsun 1200.
==Second generation (1974–1977)==

Based on the platform of the first generation model, the Galant sedans and coupes received a new, somewhat rounder body in 1973, while wagons continued with the old body with a facelifted front end. The new version, with single headlights rather than the doubles of the previous generation, became the 1974 Dodge Colt in the US, available in the same bodystyles as the first one. The base engine also remained the same, but a larger G52B &quot;Astron&quot; engine became optionally available, originally only in combination with the automatic transmission. Later, the 2-liter engine became available with a manual transmission as well and was made standard fitment in the GT coupe. The 2-liter engine developed at 5500 rpm, with the California version making two fewer horsepower. Ratings varied from for the smaller one and for the larger engine in different publications and across the years.

A four-speed manual or three-speed automatic remained available, although the original Borg-Warner automatic transmission was replaced by Chrysler&#x27;s own Torqueflite unit in the 2-liter version. The Torqueflite later supplanted the old Borg-Warner unit entirely. For 1977 a five-speed manual became available (standard in the GT and Carousel coupes). The Carousel, introduced in 1975 along with larger bumpers, was more luxurious and carried special blue and white paint. For 1977, the &quot;Silent Shaft&quot; version of the smaller engine became available and was fitted as standard equipment in GT and Carousels. The introduction of the new Dodge Colt &quot;Mileage Maker&quot; meant there was a mix of second and third generation models in 1977. The second-generation 2-door hardtops and wagons continued to be offered alongside the new 2- and 4-door &quot;Mileage Makers&quot;. The wagon was also available with an &quot;Estate&quot; package that included woodgrain applique on the body sides and adjustable reclining front seats.

This model was also sold as the Dodge Colt 1600 GS in South Africa, only as a two-door hardtop coupé.

In Canada, the second-generation Dodge Colt was rebadged as the &quot;Plymouth Cricket&quot; for the 1974 and 1975 model years — not to be confused with the rebadged Hillman Avenger, marketed in the United States for model years 1971-1973 without success. All Canadian Crickets for model years 1974-1975 Crickets the grille from the 1974-1977 Dodge Colt station wagons. All Colt body styles were shared with the Cricket, with the Cricket equivalent of the Colt GT marketed as the Cricket Formula S. These second-generation, Canada-only Crickets were rebadged as Plymouth Colts for 1976.
==Third generation (1977–1979)==


The third-generation Dodge Colt effectively comprised two lines: coupes and sedans were of a smaller, Lancer-based series, and the station wagons were based on the new Mitsubishi Galant Sigma. In late 1976, for the 1977 model year, the smaller A70-series Mitsubishi Lancer became the Dodge Colt available in two-door coupe and four-door sedan body designs. While the wheelbase was slightly shorter than that of the second generation Colt, overall length was down from 171.1 to 162.6 inches (4346 to 4130 mm). The new Colt was also referred to as the Dodge Colt &quot;Mileage Maker&quot; to differentiate it from its larger predecessor. Second generation coupe and wagon versions remained on sale for the 1977 model year.

The engine was the &quot;4G32&quot; iteration of Mitsubishi&#x27;s Saturn engine family 1597 cc rated at at 5,500 rpm. A &quot;Silent Shaft&quot; (balance shaft) version of this engine along with a five-speed manual transmission (instead of the standard four-speed) were part of a &quot;Freeway Cruise&quot; package, which also included a maroon/white paintjob. For 1978 power dropped to with the introduction of the &quot;MCA-Jet&quot; high-swirl system.

For 1978 a new Dodge Colt wagon was the larger, rebadged Mitsubishi Galant Sigma. The 1.6-litre MCA-Jet four as the smaller sedans and coupes was standard with the 2.6-litre, Astron engine optional as well as a five-speed manual transmission. While the last year for the Lancer-based Colts was 1979, the wagon was continued alongside the front-wheel drive Mirage-based fourth generation models until 1981 when it was effectively replaced by the domestic Dodge Aries K wagon. The larger Mitsubishi Galant Lambda coupé was also marketed as the Dodge Colt Challenger from 1978, although the &quot;Colt&quot; part was later dropped. It shared the chassis as well as the engine options of the Colt wagon.

==Fourth generation (1979–1984)==
In late 1978 for the 1979 model year, the Dodge Colt and Plymouth Champ were marketed as North American captive imports, as rebadged variants of the front-wheel-drive Mitsubishi Mirage. The Colt and Champ (Plymouth Colt after 1982) as a 3-door hatchback in Deluxe or Custom equipment levels. These imports used a Mitsubishi Orion 4G12 1.4-liter overhead-cam, four-cylinder engine at first, which received the highest United States Environmental Protection Agency fuel economy rating in its debut year. This engine was joined by the 1.6-liter, 4G32 Saturn engine at the end of the year. For 1981, a decontented version was introduced. An RS package also became available, with stiffer suspension, sportier interior with extra gauges, and a larger fuel tank.

There were three manual transmissions and one automatic transmission available. There was a KM110 four-speed manual transmission or a &quot;Twin Stick&quot; (Mitsubishi Super Shift) version of the transmission that used a two-speed transfer case to give 8 forward and 2 reverse speeds. There was also the option of a KM119 five-speed manual transmission or a TorqueFlite three-speed automatic transmission.
For 1982, a five-door hatchback joined the lineup. The names of the equipment levels changed to &quot;E&quot; and &quot;DL&quot;. At some point claimed power dropped to 64 and 72 hp respectively for the small and large engines, while the 1.6 was only available with the automatic transmission. In August 1983, for the 1984 model year (which was to be the last year of this model of Colt), the GTS Turbo model arrived along with a naturally aspirated GTS package, similar to the earlier RS one. Unique for North America - the turbocharged Colt/Mirages sold elsewhere had a 1.4-litre engine - this used the fuel-injected 1.6-litre 4G32T engine also seen in the next-generation Colt, providing at 5500 rpm and considerable performance. It, too, featured the eight speed Twin Stick transmission and also received ventilated brakes in front. Both GTS models, available with three-door bodywork only, received a larger gas tank rather than the E and DL&#x27;s tank. They also featured a sporty appearance with uprated suspension, blacked out trim details, and a sizable front air dam.

==Fifth generation (1985–1988)==

Beginning in September 1984, the fifth generation Dodge/Plymouth Colt was marketed for model year 1985, as three door hatchbac, four door sedan, and as a five-door minivan/station wagon marketed the Dodge/Plymouth &quot;Colt Vista&quot;; a rebadged Mitsubishi Chariot. A twin-barrel carbureted 1468 cc four was the Colt&#x27;s base engine, while the 4G32BT turbocharged 1.6-litre already seen in the last model year of the previous Colts was optional on the upscale Premier four-door sedan and standard on the GTS Turbo hatchback. Power remained at 5500 rpm, as for the previous generation. A first for FWD Colts was the availability of a three-box four-door sedan body; it and the 3-door hatchback were available in the US from 1985 to 1988; the 5-door hatchback only in 1985 (and only in base E trim) and the wagon not until 1988. The five-door hatchback was only available for a single model year as Chrysler was worried about this car cannibalizing sales of their own Omni/Horizon. The five-door was replaced by the E sedan for 1986. In Canada, the five-door hatchback was also available in DL trim.

Beginning in January 1988, Chrysler Canada began sourcing Colts from Thailand, assembled there from Japanese parts, planning on bringing in 8,000 cars per annum. Thai Colts were imported to Canada until 1994. From 1988 (and lasting until 1991), the Colt/Mirage was also marketed as the &quot;Eagle Vista&quot; in Canada.

Early cars have small rectangular headlights in black inserts, while later models received more aerodynamic, flush-fitting units. The facelift model appeared for the 1987 model year, presented in late September 1986. The lowest-priced model was the &quot;E&quot; (for economy), followed by the &quot;DL&quot; and topped by the turbocharged but slow selling Premier and GTS Turbo models. In 1987 the turbocharged engine became an option for the DL hatchback, which replaced the GTS. Power for the turbo versions crept up to for the 1988 model year. The DL Turbo remained available through 1988. 1988 also marked the introduction of the wagon, initially only available with front-wheel drive. Unlike the remainder of the lineup, the 1988 wagon received a fuel injected version of the 1.5-liter engine which produces at 5500 rpm.

The Colt wagon, while never available with the turbocharged engine, did receive a more powerful 1,755 cc engine in the four-wheel-drive version which was added for 1989. The Wagon was only ever offered in DL trim. Unlike the FWD version, the DL 4x4 was not available with an automatic transmission. The larger engine produces . For the fifth generation Colt&#x27;s final year in the United States, the DL model received fully body-colored trim (including bumpers, mirrors, and so on) for what Plymouth referred to as a &quot;dipped look.&quot;

While the hatchback Colts were replaced for 1989 in the United States, the Colt Wagon continued to be available until the 1991 introduction of the Mitsubishi RVR-based Colt Wagon, which also replaced the Colt Vista. The late Colt Wagons of this generation received the newer, twin cam Sirius 1.6-liter engine with when equipped with front-wheel drive. This model was also marketed as the Eagle Vista Wagon in Canada. In Canada, this generation Colt sedans and hatchbacks also continued to be offered alongside the next generation under the &#x27;Colt 100&#x27; moniker, as a lower-priced alternative to the new model which was badged &quot;Colt 200&quot;. The Colt 100 was still available with the turbo engine as well as in luxuriously appointed LX trim in 1990, but by 1991 only the E and DL models remained.


==Sixth generation (1989–1992)==

For the 1989 model year, Eagle began marketing its Summit as another rebadged Mitsubishi Mirage. Sales started in August 1988. In Canada, the previous generation continued as a carryover model with Eagle Vista or Colt 100 badging, replacing the earlier Colt sedan. The new model was sold as the Dodge/Plymouth &#x27;Colt 200&#x27; in Canada, to distinguish it from the previous version.

Since the demise of the Dodge Omni/Plymouth Horizon in 1990, the Colt was the only subcompact in the Dodge and Plymouth lineups. The Colt sedan was not sold in the United States for the sixth generation (though it was sold in Canada), as it would be replaced by the Dodge Shadow/Plymouth Sundance liftbacks in the Dodge/Plymouth lineup for 1989. The sedan bodywork, however, was available to American consumers as an Eagle Summit. Dodge and Plymouth Colt sedans returned for 1993-1994 as a variant of the next-generation Eagle Summit. The Dodge/Plymouth Colt, Eagle Summit, and Mitsubishi Mirage of this generation used 1.5 or 1.6-litre inline-four engines.

A model powered by the 1.6-litre 4G61T turbocharged four-cylinder was produced for the 1989 model year only. There are a rumored 1,500 of these special editions to have been produced. The engine was only offered in the Mirage and the Colt GT Turbo, which were distinguished by their ground effects and spoilers (although these parts were also available for a price as add-ons to other model ranges) and by their extra features not normally found on base model ranges such as power seats, power windows, power locks, and power mirrors, special colored interior and seats, as well as a 150 mph/9000 rpm gauge cluster. The Turbo Colt/Mirage Turbo was one of &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best for 1989. A naturally aspirated version of this engine was available for the following years Colt GT, with power down to 113 hp.
Power of the 1.5-litre 4G15 was up to thanks to multi-point fuel injection. Top speed was .

The Colt Wagon was redesigned in 1991, now based on the RVR, and continued in production until the 1996 model year.
==Seventh generation (1993–1995)==

The seventh generation of the Colt was the same as Plymouth&#x27;s version, and also the same as the Eagle Summit. As usual, they were all simply badge-engineered versions of the Mitsubishi Mirage/Lancer. There was no hatchback version of the seventh generation Dodge/Plymouth Colt. Originally available in Base and GL versions, the ES (with supposedly more sporting intentions) was added later.

1.5 and 1.8 litre four-cylinder engines were used, with the larger engine originally only available to four-door Colts. While the sporting variants offered in the sixth generation were not renewed, the two-door ES was available with the more powerful sixteen-valve SOHC 1.8 for the 1994 model year. The smaller engine has while the larger version has . The previous Colt Wagon (Mitsubishi RVR) continued to be sold until 1996, while the Dodge and Plymouth Colts were replaced by the new Neon after the 1994 model year.
==Related versions==
The Plymouth Cricket nameplate was used (in addition to Dodge Colt) on Galants sold in Canada between mid-1973 and 1975, after Chrysler stopped using the Plymouth Cricket name for a rebadged Hillman Avenger-based model sourced from the United Kingdom (and sold across North America between 1971 and 1973).

The Plymouth Arrow was offered from 1976 to 1980 as a rebadged version of the Mitsubishi Lancer Celeste, not to be confused with the rebadged Mitsubishi truck sold as the Plymouth Arrow starting in 1979.

<text>Falmouth ( ) is an unincorporated community in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia, located along the Avon River in Hants County between Mount Denson and Windsor.

==History==
Falmouth and the surrounding area was known as Pisiquid by the Acadians. Having migrated from Port Royal (current day Annapolis Royal) (see also Habitation at Port-Royal, an earlier settlement several miles away that predates the French occupation of Annapolis Royal), the Acadians first settled the area in the early 1680s, as the 1686 census lists a number of families on well established farms utilizing productive dyked fields. During Queen Anne&#x27;s War, in response to the French Raid on Deerfield, Massachusetts, in the Raid on Pisiquid (1704), Benjamin Church burned the many villages of the two parishes (Ste. Famille and Notre Dame de l&#x27;Assumption) that made up the district to the ground and took prisoners to Boston. One of these prisoners was Acadian leader Noel Doiron. As with the other Acadian districts of the Bay of Fundy region, the Acadians of Piziquid were deported in the fall of 1755 (see Expulsion of the Acadians).

By 1760, the land, which was left vacant by the deportation of the Acadians, began to be resettled by New England Planters. Amongst these new settlers was a young Henry Alline, who in the 1770s would start a Great Awakening religious revival. His New Lights ideas and followers quickly spread across the region and into northeastern New England.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Falmouth had a population of 1,553 living in 579 of its 605 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 1,368. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

==Notable residents==
* Amanda Peters, writer
* George Lawrence Price (1892–1918), last soldier of the British Empire to be killed in the First World War.
* Henry Alline (1748–1784), minister and writer
* Joseph Frederick Wallet DesBarres (1721–1824), cartographer
* Noel Doiron (1684–1758), Acadian leader

<doc id="863345" wikidata="Q1738129" url="?curid=863345" title="Kel-Tec SUB-2000">
<text>The SUB-2000 is a pistol-caliber carbine manufactured by Kel-Tec CNC Industries of Cocoa, Florida, United States. The rifle is a blowback operated, semi-automatic firearm with its operating spring located in the tubular stock.

The weapon feeds from a grip-located magazine well, using magazines designed for popular models of various other manufacturers&#x27; handguns, and is an inexpensive carbine. The distinguishing characteristic of this rifle is that it folds in half, for storage and transportation, and its slim profile compared to other rifles.

==Design==
It is available in two versions chambered for 9 mm or .40 S&amp;W caliber cartridges. It was designed by George Kellgren, a Swedish-American designer who also designed many earlier Husqvarna (in Sweden), Grendel, and Intratec brand firearms, including the famous TEC-9 handgun.

The receiver is made of an impact modified glass reinforced Zytel. The front end houses a hinge block holding the barrel and the rear sight. This block is securely locked in place by a swiveling trigger guard. The receiver rigidly attaches to the stock by multiple lugs. The bottom of the receiver forms the pistol grip, also accepting different magazines according to the version specified. The receiver also houses the firing mechanism. The 4130 ordnance steel barrel has a spring-loaded collar to ensure an accurate lock between the receiver and the polymer fore-end and the fully adjustable front sight. The tubular steel stock contains the bolt and is ended by the polymer buttstock. The heavy two-piece steel bolt holds the firing pin, the extractor and has the operating handle on the bottom. A captive guide recoil spring with buffer actuates the bolt. The firing mechanism is of conventional single action type. It has a positive disconnector, a push bolt safety that blocks the sear and disengages the trigger bar. The hardened steel ejector is internal. This design, with its long bolt travel, allows for very large functioning marginals.

The basic SUB-2000 design is implemented in a rather unusual folding design that folds for storage into half its total extended length. Folding is accomplished by pulling downward on the trigger guard and swinging the barrel assembly back over the top of the rifle. A latch in the buttstock secures to the front sight housing, and the gun can be locked with a key in the folded position for added safety. The gun cannot be fired when folded.

==Variants==
Models are available using a variety of semi-automatic pistol magazines in 9mm Parabellum, .40 S&amp;W &amp; 5.7x28mm.

<doc id="863348" wikidata="Q1363954" url="?curid=863348" title="Caracas Metro">
<text>The Caracas Metro () is a mass rapid transit system serving Caracas, Venezuela. It was constructed and is operated by Compañía Anónima Metro de Caracas, a government-owned company that was founded in 1977 by José González-Lander who headed the project for more than thirty years since the early planning stages in the 1960s. Its motto is &quot;&quot; (translated as &#x27;We are part of your life&#x27;). In 1978 MTA – New York City Transit&#x27;s R46 #816 (now 5866) was shipped from the Pullman Standard&#x27;s plant as a sample of rolling stock to be used for the new metro system that was under construction at the time. 

It was inaugurated on January 2, 1983 with and currently the total length of the railway reaches . Its purpose is to contribute to the development of collective transportation in Caracas and its immediate area, through the planning, construction, and commercial exploitation of an integrated transportation system. The C. A. Metro de Caracas is in charge of its construction, operation and exploitation as a decentralized public body attached to the Ministry of People&#x27;s Power for Land Transportation.

As a consequence of the crisis that the country is experiencing, by October 2018 it was estimated that 25% of the Caracas Metro trains were out of service due to lack of maintenance. In 2020, 9 of them remain operational. 48 trains on Line 1; 6 of 44 on Line 2; and 4 of 16 on Line 3; which, together with electrical failures, causes users to experience permanent delays. In 2022, the Caracas Metro only had 23 of the 169 trains operational.

The system has 49 stations. The company is run by Major General Juan Carlos Du Bolay Perozo.

==Lines==

The Caracas Metro currently has the following lines in operation:

These lines were built between 1978 and 2006. Line 2 has four terminal stations.

Part of Line 2 was constructed as Line 4, but after its inauguration it was renamed Line 2. One must transfer on Line 3 at El Valle station to continue the ride.

Construction of the first phase of Line 4 (now officially renamed Line 2) started in 2001; this line runs parallel to Line 1 to the south, and connects &quot;Plaza Venezuela&quot; station on Line 1 with &quot;Capuchinos&quot; station on Line 2. It is expected to provide much needed relief to congestion along this segment of Line 1 where most of Metro&#x27;s ridership is concentrated.

==Commuter rail transfer points==


Construction was begun on the Los Teques Metro from Caracas Metro Las Adjuntas station (the expanded station with independent platforms connected by overhead walkways is now common to both metro systems) to the suburban city of Los Teques Alí Primera (formerly called El Tambor) station in 2001 and completed November 3, 2006.

===IFE===

Line 3 station La Rinconada is the interchange station between the Caracas Metro and the Caracas train station Libertador Simón Bolívar, where connections can be made to and from Charallave and Cúa.

===Guarenas/Guatire Metro===
The Guarenas / Guatire Metro is a new line with the intention of providing access to the eastern suburban communities. Both subsystems would allow for transfers at the Guaraira Repano (Petare North) station. In December 2006, the government awarded a 2 billion dollar contract for the construction of the new line between a soon-to-be-built Caracas Metro Parque del Este II station and the nearby twin cities of Guarenas/Guatire, with completion set for July 2012. However, by November 2012, only 7% of the metro project had been completed, and the completion date had slipped to at least 2016. , there is no official opening date.

==Services==
===Metrobus===
The system possesses a complementary bus transit network called the Metrobus, which covers 20 urban routes and four suburban routes, with the aim of transporting users to other popular destinations in the Greater Caracas area that are not reached by the metro, including bedroom communities close to the city.

===External ticket sale===
A modality implanted by the enterprise is the wholesale of tickets used in the Metro and in the &quot;Metrobús&quot;. A number of tickets is sold to some middlemen, and from there to authorized points of sale, such as kiosks and other commercial establishments. This allows Metro users to buy tickets outside of the stations, thus making them more widely available. The points of sale formally authorized for these operations are identified with the &quot;Metroseñal&quot; (Metro-sign). Tickets sold at such locals have a price discount of 3%.

==Fares and types of tickets==
The values for tickets depend mostly on the number of travels the user has planned. There are also special prices for students, and fares differ for the &quot;Metrobús&quot; usage. The types of tickets and their pricings are listed below.

In 2018, the metro became free to ride. While Metro de Caracas said this was because of a passenger number assessment, workers revealed that the government had not given the company hard money for over a year, and they could not import paper to print tickets, necessitating unlocked turnstiles.

==Future expansions==
The next phases of the Line 2 extension (also known as Line 5 during construction phase) were to be constructed with an opening planned for 2012. The first project, a extension, includes six new stations in &quot;Bello Monte&quot;, &quot;Las Mercedes&quot;, &quot;Tamanaco&quot;, &quot;Chuao&quot;, &quot;Bello Campo&quot; and &quot;Parque del Este II&quot; station. A separate project was to be carried out simultaneously, an additional Line 2 extension (also known as Line 5 or Metro Guarenas-Guatire Urban Route during the construction phase) with four additional stations in &quot;Montecristo&quot;, &quot;Boleíta&quot;, &quot;El Marques&quot; and terminal/transfer station &quot;La Urbina&quot; (Petare Norte).

The La Urbina station was also destined to be the Caracas Guarenas-Guatire light rail transfer point. This long section was originally assigned funds for a 2012 completion.

Long term proposals include expanding the system with two more lines: Line 5 ( long) to southeast Caracas, and Line 6 () that would run parallel to Line 1 to the north.

==Incidents==
*On July 30, 2007, after 24 years without a single accident, a collision took place that took the life of a person and injured 11 others. It was on Line 1 at Plaza Sucre station at 9:09 a.m. when a train headed in the Propatria direction stopped on the platform. It was hit from behind by another travelling in the same direction. Although there has been much speculation about the cause of the accident, it is clear that there was a defect in the emergency braking system; the operational control centre from the La Hoyada station never activated the automatic braking mechanism when a train approaches a second train.
*On November 12, 2010, 33 people were arrested after staging a protest at Propatria Station over increasingly deteriorating service on the Metro.
* On 23 January 2017, several thousand Venezuelans protested throughout the country the government had also cordoned of the planned march areas with police and closed all subway and transportation systems to the area.
* During the 2017 protests, it was common for the government to close Metro stations. On 4 April, twelve subway stations were closed; on 8 April, 16 subway stations and 19 Caracas Metrobus routes were closed. On 13 April, 27 stations were closed, and on 26 April the Metro was closed completely after being open for two hours, along with the suspension of the Metrobus and Bus Caracas services.
* On 5 February 2018, after a protests because of the delay of the Metro, tear gas was fired in the subway, causing the service to be suspended for 25 minutes.
* On 14 February 2018, Metro users had to walk across the subway tunnels after an electric failure.
*In July 2018, the Metro stopped issuing tickets as they ran out of paper for printing the tickets.
*In October 2018, it was announced that 25% of Caracas Metro trains were out of service due to a lack of maintenance.
*In March 2019, the metro was out of service for several days due to an energy blackout caused by the poor political and economic situation in the country.

<doc id="863350" wikidata="Q13476361" url="?curid=863350" title="Sir Richard Fletcher, 1st Baronet">
<text>Lieutenant-Colonel Sir Richard Fletcher, 1st Baronet (1768 – 31 August 1813) was an engineer in the British Army known for his work on the Lines of Torres Vedras. He fought in the French Revolutionary Wars and Peninsular Wars, and was mentioned in dispatches a number of times, most notably for his actions at Talavera, Busaco, Badajoz and Vitoria. Fletcher was twice wounded in the line of duty before being killed in action at the Siege of San Sebastian.

==Personal life==
Little is known of Richard Fletcher&#x27;s early life, even his exact date of birth is obscure. It is known however that the year was 1768 and his father was a clergyman. On 27 November 1796, at Plymouth, he married Elizabeth Mudge the daughter of a doctor. Fletcher and his wife went on to have five children together; two sons and three daughters. Though Fletcher was buried near to where he was killed at San Sebastián, a monument to his memory, purchased by the Royal Engineers, stands at the western side of the north aisle in Westminster Abbey, London.

==Early career==
Richard Fletcher enrolled as a cadet in the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich on 7 October 1782. He began his career in the Royal Artillery where he became a second-lieutenant on 9 July 1788, before joining the Royal Engineers on 29 June 1790. Fletcher was promoted to lieutenant on 16 January 1793 and when France declared war on Britain, later that year, he was sent to serve in the West Indies.

==French Revolutionary Wars==

While in the West Indies, Fletcher played an active role in the successful attacks on the French colonies of Martinique, Gaudeloupe and St Lucia, which occurred between February and April 1794. It was during the capture of St Lucia he received a gunshot wound. Fletcher was transferred to the British controlled island of Dominica where he was appointed chief engineer before being sent home at the end of 1796.

While in England, Fletcher served as adjutant to the Royal Military Artificers in Portsmouth until December 1798 when he was sent to Constantinople (now Istanbul) to act as an advisor to the Ottoman Government. Intending to travel through Hanover, Fletcher set sail from England but his ship was wrecked near the mouth of the river Elbe and Fletcher was forced to walk across two miles of ice before reaching land. After three months travelling through Austria and Ottoman territories in the Balkans, Fletcher finally arrived in Constantinople on 29 March 1799. In June 1799, Fletcher, alongside Ottoman troops, advanced into Syria, forcing Napoleon to forgo his siege of Acre and retreat to Egypt.

During 1799, after his return from Syria, Fletcher took part in the preparation of the defences for the Turks in the Dardanelles. After a spell with Ottoman forces in Cyprus, Fletcher returned to Syria in June 1800, to oversee the construction of fortifications at Jaffa and El Arish. Fletcher served under Sir Ralph Abercromby in December 1800 at Marmaris Bay, practising beach assaults for the expected invasion of Egypt the following year. An expedition to reconnoitre the Egyptian port of Alexandria, led to Fletcher&#x27;s capture when, while returning to his ship after a night reconnaissance mission ashore, Fletcher was intercepted by a French patrol vessel. He was held prisoner in Alexandria until its capture on 2 September 1801.

In October 1801, when the general armistice was signed, Fletcher returned to England, having been promoted to captain while he was imprisoned and later decorated by the Ottoman Empire for his services. The Treaty of Amiens was signed on 25 March 1802 but peace was short-lived and war broke out in May the following year. Fletcher was again sent to Portsmouth where he helped bolster the defences of Gosport. Promoted to major on 2 April 1807, Fletcher took part in the Battle of Copenhagen in August that year.

==Peninsular War==

Soon after the start of the Peninsular War, Fletcher was sent to Portugal. He was part of the force that occupied Lisbon when the French withdrew following the Convention of Sintra, after which he accompanied Wellington as his chief engineer in the field. Promoted to lieutenant-colonel in the army, 2 March 1809, and then the Royal Engineers, 24 June 1809, he fought at the Battle of Talavera (27-28 July 1809) for which he received a mention in dispatches.

===Lines of Torres Vedras===
It was while Wellington was making preparations for a retreat to Portugal, that Fletcher became famous for one of the greatest military engineering feats in history. The celebrated Lines of Torres Vedras were constructed on the narrow peninsula between the Atlantic and the Tagus. These three lines of defence; the first 6 miles in front of the principal one and the last 20 miles behind, were intended to protect Lisbon and provide a line of retreat for the British to their ships should it be required. Fletcher began work on these defences on 20 October 1809, using Portuguese soldiers and civilians for the bulk of the labour. Rocky slopes were steepened and reinforced, and defiles were obstructed with forts and earthworks; trees and vegetation were removed to deprive the enemy of cover and sustenance, watercourses were dammed in order to construct impassable lakes or swamps and any buildings were either fortified or destroyed. Fortifications guarded every approach and batteries commanded the highground, while a system of signal stations and roads ensured that troops could be sent quickly to where they were needed the most. And all was conducted with the utmost secrecy so that neither Napoleon nor even the British Government were aware of the lines&#x27; existence until Wellington was obliged to retreat behind them later the following year.

In July 1810, shortly before completion of the lines, Fletcher left the fortifications to serve alongside Wellington once more in the field, and was thus at the Battle of Buçaco (27 September 1810) where he again distinguished himself and was mentioned in dispatches. Wellington fell back to the Lines of Torres Vedras in October 1810, pursued by Marshal Masséna, who was shocked to find such extensive defences, having been promised by Portuguese rebels that the road to Lisbon was an easy one. Wellington&#x27;s superiors were equally surprised to hear about the defences when they later received his report. After an unsuccessful attack on 18 October, Masséna initially retreated to Santarém but when his supplies ran out the following March, he abandoned any thoughts of another attempt and headed north.

===Later campaigns===
Fletcher, as part of Wellington&#x27;s forces, chased Masséna to Sabugal where, after some skirmishing, on 2 April, Masséna was finally brought to action at the Battle of Sabugal; the first of a number of engagements as Wellington and Masséna competed for position along the Portuguese and Spanish border. After forcing Masséna to abandon Sabugal, Wellington turned his attention towards Almeida and Ciudad Rodrigo; two fortresses that guarded the northern approach to Portugal. Wellington had planned to capture both while Masséna&#x27;s army was still in disarray but the loss of Badajoz to Marshall Soult on 11 March, which protected the south, compelled him to divide his force. Wellington sent a quarter of his troops to reinforce General Beresford&#x27;s, with orders to re-take Badajoz, while his remaining force, which included Fletcher, would lay siege to Almeida. Masséna, now with a superior force, marched to relieve Almeida and Wellington, not wishing to fight under those conditions, withdrew to the town of Fuentes d&#x27;Onoro. The town changed hands a number of times during a battle that took place over three days (3–5 May), but ultimately remained under British control. Massénna&#x27;s troops were neither able to reach the fort nor stay in the open and were thus forced to leave on 8 May. Wellington continued his siege and took possession of Almeida two days later.
Fletcher was again mentioned in dispatches when serving as chief engineer at the second siege of Badajoz (19 May – 10 June 1811). The engineers suffered many casualties in their attempts to dig the thin rocky soils around a fort that had been repaired and reinforced since the last unsuccessful siege. Running short of ammunition and having sustained heavy losses; and with news that French reinforcements were on the way, Wellington withdrew his forces to Elvas on 10 June. Fletcher was also present when Ciudad Rodrigo (7 – 19 January 1812) and, on the third attempt, Badajoz (17 March – 16 April 1812) were captured. In the latter engagement it was Fletcher who identified the weak point in the defences and so ultimately decided where the main attack should be. On 19 March, Fletcher was shot in the groin when a French sortie in the fog reached the trenches where he and his engineers were working. His injury might have been much worse if it had not been for a Spanish Silver Dollar in his pocket which took the main force of the musket ball. Fletcher&#x27;s injury had him confined to his tent where Wellington, desperately short of good engineers, visited him daily for advice. Fletcher returned to England to recover, and was made a baronet on 14 December 1812, and awarded a pension of £1.00 per diem. He received the Portuguese award of the Order of the Tower and Sword; and the Army Gold Cross for Talavera, Bussaco, Ciudad Rodrigo, and Badajoz.

Fletcher returned to the Peninsular in 1813 and received a further mention in dispatches for his role in the Battle of Vitoria on 21 June. Fletcher directed the sieges of Pamplona and San Sebastián. He was killed in action during the final assault on San Sebastián on 31 August 1813.

<text>Alexander Alfredovich Bek (; 2 November 1972), sometimes transliterated from the Russian Cyrillic as Aleksandr Bek or Anglicized to Alexander Beck, was a Soviet novelist and writer.

==Biography==
Alexander Bek was born on 3 January 1903. The son of a physician employed by the Imperial Russian Army, Bek received an upbringing in his native city of Saratov, where he attended a &quot;Realschule&quot;.

Following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and the outbreak of the Russian Civil War between the Red and White movements, he joined the Bolsheviks&#x27; Red Army as a sixteen-year-old volunteer and began contributing articles to the army&#x27;s divisional newspaper in 1919. His first novel, &quot;Kurako&quot;, completed in honor of the outstanding russian metallurgist Mikhail Kurako and set down following the impressions left on Bek after a visit to the town of Kuznetsk, was published in 1934. Several other works in the style of socialist realism were written during the 1930s.

Bek returned for duty in the Red Army during World War II at Moscow as a volunteer in the 3rd Company, 1st Battalion, 24th Regiment of the 8th (Krasnaya Presnya) Volunteer Rifle Division, known as &quot;The Writers&#x27; Company&quot;. However, before entering combat he was reassigned to serve as a war correspondent, in which role he witnessed the Soviet defense of Moscow in 1941. He produced one of his life&#x27;s most famous works, &quot;Volokolamsk Highway&quot; («Волоколамское шоссе»), in 1944, depicting the heroism of Moscow&#x27;s defenders. He witnessed the surrender of Nazi Germany in World War II in Berlin the following year.

The more famous of Bek&#x27;s 1950s and 1960s works included the &quot;Several Days&quot; («Несколько дней») and &quot;General Panfilov&#x27;s Reserve&quot; («Резерв генерала Панфилова»), both of which appeared in 1960, as well as the 1956 &quot;Talent (The Life of Berezhkov)&quot; («Талант (Жизнь Бережкова)»), which appeared in English as &quot;Berezhkov - The Story Of An Inventor&quot; and was based on the real life of a specialist involved in the Soviet automobile industry.

Bek&#x27;s 1965 novel &quot;The New Appointment&quot; was written as a &quot;roman à clef&quot; centered around Soviet politician Ivan Tevosian, who under Joseph Stalin&#x27;s period as head of the Soviet Union had been appointed to play a key role in heading the Soviet metallurgical production. Despite the initial announcement of the book&#x27;s publication in the pages of &quot;Novy Mir&quot;, the novel was not published in the Soviet Union until 1986 – in large part as a result of the protests of Tevosian&#x27;s widow, who complained that the work unfairly discussed the more private aspects of her late husband&#x27;s life. Accordingly, &quot;The New Appointment&quot; first appeared in Frankfurt am Main in 1972.

Bek died on 2 November 1972 in Moscow.

<text>&quot;The Ballad of Chevy Chase&quot; is an English ballad, catalogued as Child Ballad 162 (Roud 223). There are two extant ballads under this title, both of which narrate the same story. As ballads existed within oral tradition before being written down, other versions of this once-popular song also may have existed. 

Its tune has been used by other, unconnected songs.

==Synopsis==


The ballads tell the story of a large hunting party upon a parcel of hunting land (or &quot;chase&quot;) in the Cheviot Hills, a range of rolling hills straddling the Anglo-Scottish border between Northumberland and the Scottish Borders—hence, Chevy Chase. The hunt is led by Percy, the English Earl of Northumberland, against the wishes of the Scottish Earl Douglas, who had forbidden it. Douglas interprets the party&#x27;s arrival as an invasion of Scotland and attacks. Only 110 people survive the bloody battle that follows. 

==Historical basis==
Thomas Percy and scholar Francis J. Child noted similarities with the older &quot;The Battle of Otterburn&quot;, about the 1388 Battle of Otterburn. Neither set of lyrics is completely historically accurate. Versions of either ballad often contain parallel biographical and historical information; nonetheless, the differences led Child to believe that they did not originally refer to the same occurrence.

Simpson suggests that the music of &quot;Chevy Chase&quot; was identical to the tune of &quot;Flying Flame&quot;, in which the former superseded the latter by the beginning of the seventeenth century.

Both ballads were collected in Thomas Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques.&quot; The first of the ballads is in Francis James Child&#x27;s &quot;English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot;. Different versions were collected in England, Scotland, and the United States.

Versions of &quot;The Ballad of Chevy Chase&quot; exist in several ballad collections, including the Roxburghe Ballads, the Pepys Library, the Huntington Library Miscellaneous, the Glasgow University Library, and the Crawford Collection at the National Library of Scotland. The ballads in these collections were printed with variations between 1623 and 1760. Online facsimiles of the ballad are also available for public consumption at the English Broadside Ballad Archive and other online repositories.

==First ballad==
The first of the two ballads of Chevy Chase may have been written as early as the 1430s, but the earliest record we have of it is in &quot;The Complaynt of Scotland&quot;, printed around 1549. One of the first printed books in Middle Scots, the book calls the ballad &quot;The Hunting of Cheviot.&quot; 

The first manuscript version of the ballad was written around 1550 (MS Ashmole 48, Bodleian Library). 

In the seventeenth century, the tune was licensed in 1624 and again in 1675.

==Second ballad==
In 1711, Joseph Addison wrote in &quot;The Spectator&quot;:

The old song of &quot;Chevy-Chase&quot; is the favourite ballad of the common people of England, and Ben Jonson used to say he had rather have been the author of it than of all his works. Sir Philip Sidney, in his discourse of Poetry [&quot;The Defence of Poesie&quot;], speaks of it in the following words: &quot;I never heard the old song of Percy and Douglas that I found not my heart more moved than with a trumpet; and yet it is sung by some blind crowder with no rougher voice than rude style, which being so evil apparelled in the dust and cobweb of that uncivil age, what would it work trimmed in the gorgeous eloquence of Pindar?&quot; For my own part, I am so professed an admirer of this antiquated song, that I shall give my reader a critique upon it without any further apology for so doing.

Apparently, Addison was unaware that the ballad, which he proceeded to analyze in detail, was not the same work praised by Sidney and Jonson. The second of the ballads appears to have been written in modernized English some years after Sidney&#x27;s comments, perhaps around 1620, and to have become the better-known version.

==Cultural references==

William Hutton, in &quot;A Journey from Birmingham to London&quot; (1785), mentions &quot;the old song of Chevy Chace&quot; and its tale about &quot;the animosity between England and Scotland&quot;.

In Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;Rob Roy&quot; (1817), the main character, Frank, upon seeing the trophies on the walls of Osbaldistone hall, imagines them being from the Chevy Chase.

An early and popular painting of 1825–6 by Edwin Landseer was titled &quot;The Hunting of Chevy Chase&quot;.

In Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1847), Catherine Heathcliff (&quot;née&quot; Catherine Linton) scorns Hareton Earnshaw&#x27;s primitive attempts at reading, saying, &quot;I wish you would repeat Chevy Chase as you did yesterday; it was extremely funny!&quot;

In Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s &quot;North and South&quot; (1855), on hearing the conversation between Mr. Thornton and her father, Margaret Hale wonders, “How in the world had they got from cog-wheels to Chevy Chace?”

In F. Anstey&#x27;s &quot;Vice Versa&quot; (1882), the boys at Dr. Grimstone&#x27;s boarding school are required to play a game called &quot;chevy&quot; (a version of &quot;prisoners&#x27; base&quot; or &quot;darebase&quot;), &quot;so called from the engagement famed in ballad and history&quot;.

==Legacy==
A tract of land in British America was named &quot;Cheivy Chace&quot; by 1725, and was in the 1890s and early 1900s developed into the affluent areas of Chevy Chase, Maryland, and Chevy Chase, Washington, D.C. A golf club in the Maryland Chevy Chase inspired the name of Chevy Chase, Lexington, Kentucky.

A shopping mall in the Eldon Square Shopping Centre in Newcastle upon Tyne is named &quot;Chevy Chase&quot; in allusion to the ballad.

The ballad inspired the childhood nickname and adult stage name of the American comedian and actor Chevy Chase (born Cornelius Crane Chase, 1943).

The ballad has given the English language the verb &quot;to chivvy&quot;, meaning to pester or encourage someone to perform a task.

<text>Yevgeny Abramovich Baratynsky (; 11 July 1844) was lauded by Alexander Pushkin as the finest Russian elegiac poet. After a long period when his reputation was on the wane, Baratynsky was rediscovered by Russian Symbolism poets as a supreme poet of thought.

== Biography ==
A member of the noble , or, more accurately, 
Boratynsky family, the future poet received his education at the Page Corps at St. Petersburg, from which he was expelled at the age of 15 after stealing a snuffbox and five hundred roubles from the bureau of his accessory&#x27;s uncle. After three years in the countryside and deep emotional turmoil he entered the army as a private.

In 1820 the young poet met Anton Delvig, who rallied his failing spirits and introduced him to the literary press. Soon the military posted Baratynsky to Finland, where he remained for six years. His first long poem, &quot;Eda&quot;, written during this period, established his reputation.

In January 1826 he married the daughter of Major-General Gregory G. Engelhardt. Through the interest of friends he obtained leave from the Emperor to retire from the army, and he settled in 1827 in Muranovo just north of Moscow (now a literary museum). There he completed his longest work, &quot;The Gipsy&quot;, a poem written in the style of Pushkin.

Baratynsky&#x27;s family life seemed happy, but a profound melancholy remained in the background of his mind and of his poetry. He published several books of verse which Pushkin and other perceptive critics praised highly, but which met with a comparatively cool reception from the public, and with violent ridicule on the part of the young journalists of the &quot;plebeian party&quot;. As time went by, Baratynsky&#x27;s mood progressed from pessimism to hopelessness, and elegy became his preferred form of expression. He died in 1844 at Naples, where he had gone in pursuit of a milder climate.

== Poetry ==
Baratynsky&#x27;s earliest poems are punctuated by conscious efforts to write differently from Pushkin whom he regarded as a model of perfection. Even &quot;Eda&quot;, his first long poem, though inspired by Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;The Prisoner of the Caucasus&quot;, adheres to a realistic and homely style, with a touch of sentimental pathos but not a trace of romanticism. It is written, like all that Baratynsky wrote, in a wonderfully precise style, next to which Pushkin&#x27;s seems hazy. The descriptive passages are among the best—the stern nature of Finland was particularly dear to Baratynsky.

His short pieces from the 1820s are distinguished by the cold, metallic brilliance and sonority of the verse. They are dryer and clearer than anything in the whole of Russian poetry before Akhmatova. The poems from that period include fugitive, light pieces in the Anacreontic and Horatian manner, some of which have been recognized as the masterpieces of the kind, as well as love elegies, where a delicate sentiment is clothed in brilliant wit.

In his mature work (which includes all his short poems written after 1829) Baratynsky is a poet of thought, perhaps of all the poets of the &quot;stupid nineteenth century&quot; the one who made the best use of thought as a material for poetry. This made him alien to his younger contemporaries and to all the later part of the century, which identified poetry with sentiment. His poetry is, as it were, a short cut from the wit of the 18th-century poets to the metaphysical ambitions of the twentieth (in terms of English poetry, from Alexander Pope to T. S. Eliot).

Baratynsky&#x27;s style is classical and dwells on the models of the previous century. Yet in his effort to give his thought the tersest and most concentrated statement, he sometimes becomes obscure by sheer dint of compression. Baratynsky&#x27;s obvious labour gives his verse a certain air of brittleness which is at poles&#x27; ends from Pushkin&#x27;s divine, Mozartian lightness and elasticity. Among other things, Baratynsky was one of the first Russian poets who were, in verse, masters of the complicated sentence, expanded by subordinate clauses and parentheses.

<doc id="863370" wikidata="Q2165474" url="?curid=863370" title="Ron MacLean">
<text>Ronald Joseph Corbett MacLean (born April 12, 1960) is a Canadian sportscaster for the CBC and Rogers Media, best known as the host of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; from 1986 to 2014 and again since 2016, and is also a hockey referee.

==Early life and education==
MacLean was born in Zweibrücken, West Germany, at the NATO Royal Canadian Air Force (RCAF) Number 3 Fighter Wing Zweibrucken, West Germany on April 12, 1960. His father was stationed at the NATO RCAF Number 1 Air Division Headquarters, Chateau de Mercy, Metz, France where he was employed in the Chateau as a NCO Communications Operator (Crypto Centre). 

Ron MacLean Sr., of Sydney, Nova Scotia, married in July 1959 at 1 Air Division Metz, a member of the RCAF, Sarah &quot;Lila&quot; MacDonald, from Iona, Nova Scotia. In 1956-57 Ron MacLean Sr. worked as a communications operator at RCAF Station Edmonton, while MacDonald was an airwoman/clerk stationed at RCAF Station Namao, just outside Edmonton. Fourteen months after MacLean&#x27;s birth, the family moved back to Canada, initially settling in Chester, Nova Scotia. MacLean was four years old when his dad was stationed in Whitehorse, Yukon, with the Royal Canadian Air Force before relocating eventually in Sylvan Lake, Alberta.

He attended high school in Red Deer, Alberta, where he met his future wife Cari. After high school, MacLean was prepared to attend the University of Alberta until he was asked to fill in for a sick friend at CKRD-FM, which led to a job at CKRD-TV.

==Career==
===&quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;===

MacLean has worked on &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot; since 1986–87. He began hosting telecasts in Calgary and Toronto when Dave Hodge moved to Vancouver. Hodge was later suspended, and eventually quit, protesting a CBC programming decision on-air. He worked his first Stanley Cup Finals that spring and has been the early game host ever since. Part of his duties included hosting &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; with Don Cherry.

Contract negotiations with CBC Sports Executive Director Nancy Lee and the president of English television had hit a standstill in the 2001–02 NHL season. MacLean threatened to leave CBC on the advice of his agent Don Meehan. That made headlines across Canada and following a huge public outcry, the CBC quickly gave in to his demands.

In addition to hosting &quot;HNIC&quot;, he has been a part of the CBC&#x27;s Olympics coverage since 1988. He took over as chief anchor following the departure of Brian Williams to CTV/TSN. MacLean was the main sportscaster and host for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing until his mother died, causing him to hand over duties to Scott Russell. In 1993, MacLean served as an ice level reporter for NBC Sports&#x27; coverage of the NHL All-Star Game in Montreal. MacLean has also hosted CBC&#x27;s coverage of the Queen&#x27;s Plate.

Beginning with the 2014–15 NHL season, MacLean was hired by Rogers Media when the company acquired the national rights to the NHL. MacLean was removed from the host position of &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, but retained his role as host of &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;, and became an on-location host for the new, travelling &quot;Hometown Hockey&quot; broadcasts introduced that season. On June 27, 2016, Rogers announced that MacLean would be reinstated as host of the early games on &quot;Hockey Night&quot; beginning in the upcoming season, replacing George Stroumboulopoulos.

On November 9, 2019, MacLean&#x27;s co-host Don Cherry made remarks during &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot; suggesting that Canadian immigrants benefit from the sacrifices of veterans and do not wear remembrance poppies. MacLean, who nodded during Cherry&#x27;s rant and flashed a thumbs-up sign at the end of Saturday&#x27;s segment, apologized the following day for staying silent during Cherry&#x27;s remarks. The following day, Sportsnet president Bart Yabsley announced that Cherry had been fired: &quot;Following further discussions with Don Cherry after Saturday night&#x27;s broadcast, it has been decided it is the right time for him to immediately step down.&quot; The following day, Cherry expressed his disappointment over MacLean&#x27;s apology. On November 16, 2019, MacLean addressed and reflected on the incident during &quot;Hockey Night in Canada&quot;, the first without Cherry, also announcing the end of &quot;Coach&#x27;s Corner&quot;.

===Hockey Canada===
In addition to his work at the CBC, MacLean is a former Level 5 referee with Hockey Canada. He has refereed in junior, minor pro, senior, and university leagues across Canada, mostly in the Southern Ontario region. He served as a referee in the September 29, 2006, NHL preseason matchup of the Buffalo Sabres and the Pittsburgh Penguins, calling one penalty in the final minute of the game.

==Awards and honours==
MacLean has won eight Gemini Awards for his work with CBC. His first was in 1992 for Best Sports Broadcaster; he also won the Best Sports Broadcaster award in 1994, 1997, 1998 and 2001. He won Best Host or Interviewer in a Sports Program or Sportscast in 2004 and again in 2006. In 1996, he was inducted into the Alberta Sports Hall of Fame. In 2015, he was inducted into the Oakville Sports Hall of Fame. In 2016, MacLean, along with his Coach&#x27;s Corner co-host Don Cherry, received a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

MacLean received an honorary degree from Lakehead University in 2018, and the University of Alberta in 2019.

==Personal life==
MacLean was named Honorary Colonel of the 1 Air Movements Squadron at 17 Wing Winnipeg of the Canadian Forces&#x27; Air Command.

On June 3, 2010, MacLean helped to rescue a man trying to take his own life, by jumping into the Delaware River in Philadelphia.

In 2010, MacLean and his 1986 Ford Mustang were profiled by &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

<doc id="863381" wikidata="Q5242314" url="?curid=863381" title="Dawes Rolls">
<text>The Dawes Rolls (or Final Rolls of Citizens and Freedmen of the Five Civilized Tribes, or Dawes Commission of Final Rolls) were created by the United States Dawes Commission. The commission was authorized by United States Congress in 1893 to execute the General Allotment Act of 1887.

Traditionally, the land in these tribal communities had been held communally. With the establishment of the Dawes Commission, the ruling was made by the colonial agents to divide the land into parcels and institute a system of individual ownership in accordance with US laws, overriding the treaty and tribal laws of the region. To allot the communal lands, citizens of the Five Tribes (Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, Creek, and Seminole) were to be enumerated and registered by the US government. These counts also included the Freedmen – formerly enslaved African-Americans who had been emancipated after the American Civil War, and their descendants. 

The rolls were used to assign allotments to heads of household and to provide an equitable division of all monies obtained from sales of surplus lands. These rolls became known as the &quot;Dawes Rolls&quot;. When word got out that people could get land, many non-Natives appeared at the offices and falsely claimed to be Native. Most of these false claimants claimed to be Cherokee. Family myths still persist of &quot;hiding in the hills&quot;, or of being &quot;rejected from the rolls&quot;, or &quot;refusing to enroll&quot; when the reason for having not been enrolled is that the applicants were simply not Native American.

==Enumeration and enrollment==
The Dawes Commission went to the individual tribes to obtain the membership lists, but it took a series of attempts to gain anything approaching an accurate count. In 1898, Congress passed the Curtis Act, which provided that a new roll would be taken and supersede all previous rolls. Difficulties in enumerating the population included the forced migrations of the period as well as the American Civil War. Additionally, non-Native census takers introduced the idea of Blood Quantum, a concept previously foreign to the tribal communities. Those recording this percentage of ancestry wrote down an estimation, based on physical appearance and personal opinion if the individual was present.

Tribal citizens were listed under several categories:
:*Citizen by Blood
:**New Born Citizen by Blood
:**Minor Citizens by Blood
:*Citizen by Marriage
:*Freedmen (persons formerly enslaved by Native Americans or adopted by the Cherokee tribe)
:**New Born Freedmen
:**Minor Freedmen
:*Delaware Indians (those adopted by the Cherokee tribe were enrolled as a separate group within the Cherokee)

More than 250,000 people applied for membership, and the Dawes Commission enrolled just over 100,000. Most were rejected because they were non-Natives who showed up demanding land, but could not prove any connection to an existing Native community, such as naming living relatives or speaking the Native language. Overrun with prospective claimants, the commission was overwhelmed and instituted guidelines: 

An act of Congress on April 26, 1906 closed the rolls on March 5, 1907. An additional 312 persons were enrolled under an act approved August 1, 1914.

While some initially refused to be enumerated, almost all were later arrested and enrolled against their will; enrollment was not a matter of &quot;choice&quot;. Refusing to be enumerated, and even fleeing, would mean warrants being issued for the person&#x27;s arrest; they could then be treated brutally and imprisoned in the process of being enrolled by force. Still, due to understandable distrust of the government, there were those who tried to avoid enumeration. Notable among those who resisted were Muscogee Chitto Harjo (Crazy Snake), and Cherokee Redbird Smith. But both Harjo and Smith were eventually coerced into enrolling. According to Cherokee professor Steve Russell, some Natives hiding in the Cookson Hills never enrolled, but some of them were later arrested and forcibly enrolled, while others were enrolled on their behalf by people in their communities. Additionally all individuals on the Census Roll of 1896 were enrolled without notification to the parties involved. The only real choice to avoid enumeration entirely meant completely leaving one&#x27;s community and assimilating. Since that period, the tribes have relied on the Dawes Rolls as part of the membership qualification process, using them as records of citizens at a particular time, and requiring new members to document direct descent from a person or persons on these rolls. Courts have upheld this rule even when it has been proven that a brother or sister of an ancestor was listed on the rolls but not the direct ancestor himself/herself.

Another issue on the Dawes Rolls are people termed &quot;Five-Dollar Indians&quot;. Some white people bribed government officials to obtain land allotments, but this was not as widespread as some would believe.

Gregory Smithers, associate professor of history at Virginia Commonwealth University stated, &quot;These were opportunistic white men who wanted access to land or food rations. ... These were people who were more than happy to exploit the Dawes Commission – and government agents, for $5, were willing to turn a blind eye to the graft and corruption.&quot; For the small minority that managed this, this fraudulent enrollment may have earned white people potential benefits for themselves and their descendants, but also could have subjected them to further removal, relocation or incarceration. There were also land runs during this era, and other methods for white people to obtain land. Most of the white people on the Dawes Rolls are noted as included due to marrying a member of the tribe and having Indian children.

The Dawes Rolls, though recognized as flawed, are still essential to the citizenship process of the Nations that include them in their laws. The federal government uses them in determining blood-quantum status of individuals for Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood.

<doc id="863389" wikidata="Q884508" url="?curid=863389" title="Blitzkrieg (video game)">
<text>Blitzkrieg () is a 2003 real-time tactics video game based on the events of World War II and is the first title in the &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; series. The game allows players to assume the role of commanding officer during the battles of World War II that occurred in Europe and North Africa. Each country has its respective historically correct military units. Similar to the &quot;Sudden Strike&quot; games, &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; focuses on battles rather than real-time strategy aspects like base building.

Virtual Programming published a Mac OS X version of the game on the Mac App Store on April 20, 2011.

Certain versions of the original game, and several sequels, use the StarForce copy protection system. &quot;Blitzkrieg Anthology&quot; does not appear to use StarForce.

Graphics deliver realistic 3-D rendered isometric terrain and details include seasons, climatic zones and weather conditions which can affect game play. Blood is present although it can be deactivated. The game features over 350 different units and objects. The player has the ability to build pontoon bridges, dig trenches, lay mines, resupply and repair units or call in air support but there are no resources. Virtually everything can be destroyed including buildings and bridges. Forests can be flattened by tanks or artillery. Each unit of a respective nation speaks its own language, adding immensely to the immersion.

The game shipped with a mission and resource editors for users to create their own units and maps.

==Gameplay==
The game is split into three modes: campaign, multiplayer and custom game. &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; centers on 3 distinctive campaigns which features some of the major factions battling it out in World War II. They feature the Allies (American and British campaigns), the Germans, and the Soviets. Each of those attempt to chronologically re-enact the time periods of the war by devising Chapters into each of the campaigns.

Each player starts with &#x27;core units&#x27;. These named units would be the same personnel accompanying the player throughout the chosen Campaign and may gain rank and experience as the player progresses from one Chapter to the other. As they fight, units will expend their ammunition, forcing the player to pay attention. Each of the individual units can be used separately or in groups, and by highlighting vehicles or humans, groups can be created and then called by a button at any time. Because of the dismissal of base-building and unit spawning, strategy is a key ingredient of overall gameplay.

==Reception==
== Add-ons ==
There are three official expansions of the original &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; to date, all three developed by La Plata Studios (Germany) in collaboration with Nival Interactive, the developer of the original &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; game. They are published and distributed by CDV Interactive. The base game &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; was released together with its three expansions as &quot;Blitzkrieg Anthology&quot;.

* Blitzkrieg: Burning Horizon follows the footsteps of General Erwin Rommel starting from the crossing of the Ardennes to the battles of the Afrika Korps and continuing to the last struggle of German resistance in occupied France. It also includes a new nation, Japan, with unique new units and weaponry (Belgium is also added, in single player only as an enemy), as well as 8 brand new single player missions, in which battles rage in many different countries and islands, from the Pacific island of Papua New Guinea to the jungles of Burma and Singapore and the deserts of Northern Africa and much more. It also includes over 56 new and improved units, including tanks, aircraft, squads, and artillery. It was first released in Germany in April 2004, although a Finnish release may have come earlier. It was then sold in English-language and several other markets in June.
* Blitzkrieg: Rolling Thunder traces the career of General George S. Patton during World War II ranging from the deserts of the North African campaign to the snowy forests of the Ardennes during the Battle of the Bulge. &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; is also known as &quot;Roar of the Storm&quot; or &quot;Rumble of the Storm&quot; in the Russian market. It was first released in November 2004.
* Blitzkrieg: Iron Division, also known as Green Devils, is an expansion that requires &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; and &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; in order to play. The &quot;Green Devils&quot; add-on is also known as &quot;Devils in Khaki&quot; in the Russian market. Unlike the first two expansions, it is not a full campaign, but a set of 4 custom missions. It follows the German 9th Panzer Division&#x27;s actions in the Battle of France, the Eastern Front and the Normandy campaign. It also includes 1st airborne campaign called &quot;Eagles&quot; as well as a few new units and a new campaign: &quot;Tank School&quot;. First released in June 2005, it was sold in the US in September 2006.

== Stand-alone games ==
The &quot;Enigma Engine&quot; used in &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; was heavily outsourced and plenty of games were made using the engine:
* Stalingrad, developed by Russian developers DTF Games, is a stand-alone game covering the advance toward and the battle for Stalingrad from both the German and Soviet sides. It was first released in December 2004, and then in the UK in March 2005. A Steam digital version was released in March 2015. It is unrelated to the similarly worded &quot;Great Battles: Stalingrad&quot; spin-off game from a different developer, built on the &quot;Blitzkrieg 2&quot; engine and released in 2007.
* , developed by Blitzfront Game Studio, is a game based on the Finnish-Russian Winter War in 1939–1940. It was first released in November 2007.
* WWI: The Great War, developed by Dark Fox, is a World War I-based game built on the Blitzkreg engine. The player assumes the role of the commanding officer of either the armed forces of the United Kingdom, France, Russia, Germany or Austria-Hungary on the battlefields of the Great War with the country&#x27;s respective weaponry from 1914 to 1918. It was first released in June 2005, and an initial UK budget retail label was released in 2008. As of April 2015, the game is now officially available on Steam.
* Mission Barbarossa and Kursk developed by UK developers ACTive Gaming, follow the invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941 and the Battle of Kursk in 1943. The &quot;Mission Barbarossa&quot; add-on is also known as &quot;Eastern Front&quot; in the Russian market. &quot;Mission Barbarossa&quot; and &quot;Kursk&quot; were first released in January 2005 (as a Russian budget label) and August 2005, respectively.
* Blitzkrieg: Operation &quot;North&quot;, developed by Dark Fox, was released in February 2004.
* Panzerkrieg: Burning Horizon 2 was developed by German studio La Plata Studios, who also made the official expansions &quot;Burning Horizon&quot; &amp; &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot;. &quot;Burning Horizon II&quot; is an unofficial compilation of three previously released games in the series — &quot;Blitzkrieg: Red Horizon&quot; (Soviet), &quot;Blitzkrieg: Rolling Thunder&quot; (American), and &quot;Blitzkrieg: Lost Victories&quot; (German) and released in Germany in October 2008 and UK in June 2009. In the sequel, players can choose between the Allied, German or Soviet campaigns, reliving key battles from history such as the Battle of the Bulge, Operation Sturgeon Catch and Battle of the Frontiers.

=== Non-WWII or WWI based ===
* Conflict 2012: Operation Kosovo Sunrise was developed by Patriote Interactive and La Plata Studios, who has experience in releasing unofficial add-ons. This game is set in 2012 in the Balkans as the players take command of a special mixed army unit in an attempt to stop invasion. The main factions are the NATO and Serbian forces. It was released in limited batches in Serbian/Cyrillic and/or maybe Russian language in October 2009. The English language retail version or patch also had a limited release around June 2010. The 2012 mod version is available at Mod DB.
* Cuban Missile Crisis: The Aftermath was developed by G5 Software LLC. This game, built on the Enigma engine used by &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;, provides a hypothetical scenario in which the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis became a full-blown worldwide nuclear war. It was first released in Russia in February 2005 with some other European releases following later the same year. The US retail edition was first released in November 2005 and was digitally available on GamersGate in March 2008. The Russian developers also made a standalone expansion to this game called &quot;Cuban Missile Crisis: Ice Crusade&quot;, set in 1967, five years after the Cuban Missile Crisis which turned into a nuclear war. This expansion was first released in Russia in June 2005 and was digitally released on GamersGate in May 2009. Both games went on the Steam digital shop in March 2015.
* Desert Law was developed by Arise and used a modified version of &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot;″s engine. It is a real-time strategy game set in the southern states of post-apocalyptic America, but without base building. The storytelling is told through comic book cutscenes as well as in-mission dialog. Mechanically, it is similar to &quot;Command &amp; Conquer&quot;, and visually similar to the early &quot;Fallout&quot; games. It was first released in retail form in April 2005. It is also known &quot;Coyotes: Desert Law&quot; in Russia and &quot;Desert Law: Warriors of the Desert&quot; in Poland. It was digitally available on GamersGate in March 2008 and a Steam digital version was released in March 2015.

===&quot;Panzerkrieg - Burning Horizon II&quot;===
Hamburg-based La Plata Studios (developers of the &quot;Burning Horizon&quot;, &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; and &quot;Green Devils&quot; titles) released &quot;Panzerkrieg - Burning Horizon II&quot; in 2008. The project was produced in conjunction with the head of the original &quot;Blitzkrieg&quot; team. By the end of October 2008, the game was released in Germany where it was successful and sold more copies than any &quot;Blitzkrieg 2&quot; extension.

<doc id="863395" wikidata="Q1420144" url="?curid=863395" title="Fischerspooner">
<text>Fischerspooner was an electroclash duo and performance troupe formed in 1998 in New York City after meeting in school. The name is a combination of the founders&#x27; last names, Warren Fischer and Casey Spooner.

==Career==
Originally a duo formed by classically trained musician Warren Fischer and video-artist and experimental theater performer Casey Spooner for an impromptu rendition of their makeshift track &quot;Indian Cab Driver&quot; at the Astor Place Starbucks, the group grew to over 20 performers, most of whom are dancers and guest vocalists. &quot;We started as a performance art piece about entertainment that ultimately became legitimate entertainment,&quot; said Casey Spooner, when talking about the group&#x27;s origins in an April 2009 interview.

===&quot;#1&quot; (2001)===
Their debut album, &quot;#1&quot;, has been released on several record labels, including International DJ Gigolo, Ministry of Sound and Capitol Records, and includes their hit singles &quot;Sweetness&quot;, &quot;Emerge&quot;, and a cover of Wire&#x27;s &quot;the 15th&quot;. In the final months of 2004, Fischerspooner opened up their FS Studios in New York City to the public for a few hours once a week, allowing people to meet the band and production team, as well as preview new video, music and dance projects that they were working on.

===&quot;Odyssey&quot; (2005)===
In 2005, &quot;Odyssey&quot;, the band&#x27;s second album, was released. The album featured songs that were more structured and more accurately described as electropop than electroclash. &quot;&quot;Odyssey&quot; was really about being on Capitol, which was this icon of classic American music, trying to embrace that cliché and find a way to embody it and infiltrate it and take it apart at the same time&quot;, says Spooner.

The lead single, &quot;Just Let Go&quot;, featuring live drums and guitars, possessed a markedly different sound than those heard on their debut album. &quot;Just Let Go&quot; was featured on season 2, episode 15 of &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;; &quot;All We Are&quot; was also featured on the same TV series, in season 3, episode 1. The second single, &quot;Never Win&quot;, went on to become the album&#x27;s biggest hit, and was well received in both clubs and radio. Furthermore, it was also featured in the 2006 Happy Madison movie &quot;Grandma&#x27;s Boy&quot;. &quot;A Kick in the Teeth&quot; was rumored to be the album&#x27;s third, and possibly final, single but was only pressed on 12&quot; that included a remix by Tiefschwarz. This was followed after a duration of silence by a 12&quot; remix of &quot;We Need a War&quot; with a mix by DJ Hell. Other remixes believed to have been done are of &quot;All We Are&quot; and &quot;Get Confused&quot;. &quot;All We Are&quot; was featured as the credits track in the first episode of season two of Sweetbitter.

After the album&#x27;s release, Fischerspooner toured a new, more elaborate show in Europe, but the band found themselves without the funds to tour the show fully in North America. &quot;I was incredibly frustrated because I had worked two years on this huge record and I was only able to perform for three months&quot;, recalls Spooner, who subsequently retreated to his theatrical roots, joining experimental New York performance ensemble The Wooster Group. During this period, it was unclear whether the band would record together again; and, in May 2007, the band was released from its Capitol Records recording contract.

===&quot;Entertainment&quot; (2009)===
Early European gig recordings of &quot;The Best Revenge&quot; surfaced on the internet during summer 2007. &quot;The Best Revenge&quot; was released on January 14, 2008, with French label Kitsune Music. The track includes a remix package from the likes of Autokratz, Tocadisco, Alex Gopher, The Passions and Tony Senghore. Fischerspooner also released &quot;Danse en France&quot; as a single on the Kitsuné label.
The album &#x27;Entertainment&#x27; was released by Lo Recordings. 

Warren and Casey subsequently began to work on more material for a new album while Casey was performing the role of Ophelia&#x27;s brother Laertes in The Wooster Group&#x27;s production of Hamlet (Fischerspooner also contributed two original songs to the production).
Released in North America via the band&#x27;s own label FS Studios on May 4, 2009, &quot;Entertainment&quot; is their third full-length album and was produced by Jeff Saltzman (The Killers, The Black Keys, The Sounds).

The album&#x27;s cover was listed on Pitchfork&#x27;s worst album covers of 2009.

===&quot;Sir&quot; (2018)===
The album &quot;Sir&quot;, executive-produced and co-written by Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and Boots, was released on February 16, 2018, on Ultra. The band released the first single &quot;Have Fun Tonight&quot; on June 19, 2017. The song &quot;Top Brazil&quot;, was released on January 19, 2018; along with an electro-pop music video which Billboard called, &quot;provocative.&quot; 
NPR interpreted the album as a retrospective collage of Reagan-era queer references framed in an undeniably contemporary style;

&quot;Even the cheapskate metaphor passions in the lyrics, read as physical, often NSFW desires — &#x27;raging motorcycle thoroughbred,&#x27; &#x27;not opposed to humiliation,&#x27; &#x27;denim on denim,&#x27; &#x27;dorsal fins at night in Berlin,&#x27; &#x27;Butterscotch Goddam,&#x27; &#x27;dark pink Saturday night&#x27; — that are dated just enough to seem older and odder. Pairing these with layered synthesizer lines and drum-machines that invoke Reagan-era industrial and EBM reinforces nostalgic notions of sexual danger.&quot;

In an interview with the album collaborators, it was said that, &quot;[the album] explores Spooner’s &#x27;re-entry into the sexual playground now defined by technology, but also the muddled ways that feelings and self-image are present in that experience&#x27; while simultaneously examining the years of &#x27;emotional and sexual turbulence&#x27; he experienced with his ex-partner.&quot;

===Break-up===
On October 30, 2019, the duo announced their breakup via Instagram.

<doc id="863398" wikidata="Q677910" url="?curid=863398" title="World Business Council for Sustainable Development">
<text>The World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) is a CEO-led organization of over 225 international companies. The council is also connected to 60 national and regional business councils and partner organizations.

Its origins date back to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit of 1992, when Stephan Schmidheiny, a Swiss business entrepreneur, was appointed chief adviser for business and industry to the secretary general of the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED). He created a forum called &quot;Business Council for Sustainable Development&quot;, which went on to become &quot;Changing Course&quot;, a book that coined the concept of eco-efficiency.

The WBCSD was created in 1995 as a merger of the Business Council for Sustainable Development and the World Industry Council for the Environment and is based at the Maison de la paix in Geneva, Switzerland, with offices in New York and New Delhi.

==Operations==
The council works on a variety of issues related to sustainable development. It works to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) through the transformation of six economic systems: circular economy, cities and mobility, climate and energy, food, land and water, people and redefining value. Each system transformation is set up as a WBCSD Program with a number of supplementary Projects.

==Impact and influence==
A 2003 World Bank/IFC commissioned study identified the WBCSD as one of the &quot;most influential forums&quot; for companies on corporate social responsibility (CSR) issues. A 2004 Globescan survey found the WBCSD as the second most effective SD research organization. The 2006 survey by the same company reports that 54% of all surveyed experts believe the WBCSD will play a &quot;major role&quot; in advancing sustainable development. Only the European Union received higher approval (69%).

In the Ethisphere Institute&#x27;s 2007 list of the 100 Most Influential People in Business Ethics, WBCSD President Bjoern Stigson was ranked ninth, which made him the second most influential NGO leader.

The organization helped launch the Concrete Sustainability Initiative.

==Membership==
Membership of the WBCSD is by invitation of the executive committee to companies committed to sustainable development. WBCSD has over 180 members.

===Forética===
Forética claims to be a global network of Spanish speaking businesses and professionals whose mission is to promote an ethical management and corporate social responsibility by the establishment of a National standard in Spain known as SGE-21, (sistema de gestión ética para el Siglo 21) which is also Annex 1 to ISO 26000 and supported by CSR Europe
Membership is said to around 400 and includes companies of all sizes and sectors, as well as individual specialists, professionals, and academics and it was incorporated into WBCSD on 2 September 2014.

==Governance==
The WBCSD is a member-led organization governed by a Council composed of the Council Members of its member companies. The Council elects the executive committee, including the chairman and four Vice Chairmen. Past chairmen include:

* Rodney F. Chase – BP (1995)
* Livio D. DeSimone – 3M (1996/97)
* Egil Myklebust – Norsk Hydro (1998/99)
* Charles O. Holliday, Jr. – DuPont (2000/01)
* Sir Philip Watts KCMG – Royal Dutch Shell (2002/03)
* Bertrand Collomb – Lafarge (2004/05)
* Travis Engen – Alcan (2006/07)
* Sam DiPiazza – PwC (2008/09)
* Paul Polman – Unilever (2012–17)
*Sunny Verghese – Olam (2018–2020)

==Geographic balance==
Most of WBCSD&#x27;s member companies are headquartered in Europe (47%). 22% member companies are headquartered in Asia, 22% in North America and 5% in Latin America. The geographically least represented regions are Africa, Australasia and the Middle East with 1% each.

== Controversies ==

According to Greenpeace the &quot;World Business Council for Sustainable Development &quot; is among the key players responsible for holding back the world societies from tackling the climate change and energy management challenges for the past 20 years. The WBCSD Executive Committee was dominated by the largest non-renewable energy and carbon-intensive companies in the world at least until 2011. According to Greenpeace the WBCSD executive committee has been a &#x27;Who&#x27;s Who&#x27; of the world&#x27;s largest carbon-intensive companies.

The Sierra Club has collaborated with the World Business Council on a number of initiatives, as well as inviting its representatives to speak at Sierra Club events. The Environmental Defense Fund recommends the World Business Council&#x27;s auditing methods to companies seeking to reduce greenhouse emissions, and the Natural Resources Defense Council has drawn upon WBCSD guidelines in drawing up their own guidelines for determining biofuels sustainability. The WBCSD&#x27;s Vision 2050 report was highlighted by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;the largest concerted corporate sustainability action plan to date – include reversing the damage done to ecosystems, addressing rising greenhouse gas emissions and ensuring societies move to sustainable agriculture.&quot;

<doc id="863399" wikidata="Q4931388" url="?curid=863399" title="Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett">
<text>Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356 (2001), was a United States Supreme Court case about Congress&#x27;s enforcement powers under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The Supreme Court decided that Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act was unconstitutional, insofar as it allowed states to be sued by private citizens for money damages.

==Background==
The plaintiffs were Milton Ash and Patricia Garrett, both employees of the University of Alabama school system. They were disabled under the definition of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Ash was a security guard who had a lifelong history of severe asthma, and Garrett was a nurse who had been diagnosed with breast cancer requiring time-consuming radiation and chemotherapy treatments. Both alleged that they had been discriminated against at their jobs. The university had refused to assign Ash to duties that would alleviate his asthma and insisted on transferring Garrett because of her absences. Ash and Garrett filed a suit in federal court against the University of Alabama for damages, arguing that the university had violated Title I of the ADA, which prohibiting discrimination in employment on the basis of disability.

The University of Alabama responded with a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the Eleventh Amendment prohibited the suit. The United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama dismissed both cases on that ground, but the Eleventh Circuit reversed and held that Congress had expressly abrogated the sovereign immunity of the states.

==Issue==
Can Congress abrogate states&#x27; immunity under its Fourteenth Amendment power to enforce the Equal Protection Clause?

==Decision==
The majority opinion stated that Congress, in enacting the ADA, had satisfied the requirement that it make clear its intention to abrogate state sovereign immunity and allow states to be sued for damages under the Fourteenth Amendment. However, the majority opinion also stated that part of the ADA to lack the &quot;congruence and proportionality&quot; required when Congress exercises its enforcement power under the Fourteenth Amendment, citing &quot;City of Boerne v. Flores&quot; (1997).

Under the Equal Protection Clause, discrimination against people with disabilities is analyzed by &quot;rational basis&quot; scrutiny: if the discrimination has a rational basis, it is constitutional. In this case, the Court held that Congress, like the judiciary, was required to use rational basis review of state action, with its presumptions favoring constitutionality. The Supreme Court decided that the legislative record of the ADA &quot;fails to show that Congress did in fact identify a pattern of irrational state discrimination in employment against the disabled.&quot;

The Supreme Court stated that the &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; requirement of the ADA law failed the congruence and proportionality test despite the hardship exception to the accommodation requirement:
&quot;The ADA does except employers from the &#x27;reasonable accommodatio[n]&#x27; requirement where the employer &#x27;can demonstrate that the accommodation would impose an undue hardship on the operation of the business of such covered entity.&#x27; § 12112(b)(5)(A). However, even with this exception, the accommodation duty far exceeds what is constitutionally required in that it makes unlawful a range of alternate responses that would be reasonable but would fall short of imposing an &#x27;undue burden&#x27; upon the employer. The Act also makes it the employer&#x27;s duty to prove that it would suffer such a burden, instead of requiring (as the Constitution does) that the complaining party negate reasonable bases for the employer’s decision. See ibid.&quot;

The Supreme Court called disability discrimination rational in that hiring non-disabled employees would conserve scarce financial resources by avoiding the need for costly reasonable accommodations: &quot;whereas it would be entirely rational (and therefore constitutional) for a state employer to conserve scarce financial resources by hiring employees who are able to use existing facilities, the ADA requires employers to &#x27;mak[e] existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.&#x27;&quot;

Thus, states have rational reasons for violating the part of the ADA law banning policies that have a disparate impact on the disabled. Even in cases of racial discrimination in which the courts apply a different standard of scrutiny to government action from rational basis review, evidence of disparate impact is insufficient:
&quot;The ADA also forbids &#x27;utilizing standards, criteria, or methods of administration&#x27; that disparately impact the disabled, without regard to whether such conduct has a rational basis. § 12112(b)(3)(A). Although disparate impact may be relevant evidence of racial discrimination, see Washington v. Davis, 426 U. S. 229, 239 (1976), such evidence alone is insufficient even where the Fourteenth Amendment subjects state action to strict scrutiny.&quot;

The Supreme Court had held in &quot;Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Corp.&quot; (1977) that disparate impact was not proof of discrimination based on &quot;race, color or national origin,&quot; which would trigger strict scrutiny.

The Supreme Court considered the burden of proof to be on those who allege a state action toward the disabled to be irrational: &quot;Moreover, the State need not articulate its reasoning at the moment a particular decision is made. Rather, the burden is upon the challenging party to negative &quot;&#x27;any reasonably conceivable state of facts that could provide a rational basis for the classification.&#x27;&quot; Heller, supra, at 320 (quoting FCC v. Beach Communications, Inc., 508 U.S. 307, 313 (1993)).&quot;

The Supreme Court mentioned the government&#x27;s argument that &quot;the inquiry as to unconstitutional discrimination should extend not only to States themselves, but to units of local governments, such as cities and counties.&quot; It admitted that local governments &quot;are &#x27;state actors&#x27; for purposes of the Fourteenth Amendment&quot; but added, &quot;These entities are subject to private claims for damages under the ADA without Congress&#x27; ever having to rely on § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to render them so. It would make no sense to consider constitutional violations on their part, as well as by the States themselves, when only the States are the beneficiaries of the Eleventh Amendment.&quot; Also, &quot;States are not required by the Fourteenth Amendment to make special accommodations for the disabled, so long as their actions towards such individuals are rational. They could quite hardheadedly – and perhaps hardheartedly – hold to job-qualification requirements which do not make allowance for the disabled. If special accommodations for the disabled are to be required, they have to come from positive law and not through the Equal Protection Clause.&quot;

The ADA, by allowing states to be sued for damages by private plaintiffs for failing to provide reasonable accommodations provided significantly more Fourteenth Amendment protection for people with disabilities than was allowed by &quot;Boerne&quot;. That level of protection, the Supreme Court held, was not &quot;congruent and proportional&quot; to the wrong of discrimination against people with disabilities.

The Supreme Court did not address the ability of the federal government to sue the states directly or the ability of Congress to subject local governments to private lawsuits, enforcing federal anti-discrimination laws enacted pursuant to Article I, for example.

Thus, the ADA did not constitutionally abrogate the states&#x27; sovereign immunity.

The decision&#x27;s scope, however, should not be overstated. While it prevents states from being subject to money damages for violations of Title I of the ADA, states are still subject to prospective injunctive relief, under &quot;Ex parte Young&quot; (1908).

===Dissent===
The Court split 5–4, with Justice Stephen Breyer filing a dissenting opinion in which he was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, David Souter, and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. The dissent stated the following about rational basis review:

On &quot;congruence and proportionality,&quot; Justice Breyer said that &quot;City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Center, Inc&quot; (1985) and &quot;Katzenbach v. Morgan&quot; (1966) were precedents that require deference by the Court, not Congress:

<doc id="863402" wikidata="Q1486175" url="?curid=863402" title="GNU Assembler">
<text>The GNU Assembler, commonly known as gas or as, is the assembler developed by the GNU Project. It is the default back-end of GCC. It is used to assemble the GNU operating system and the Linux kernel, and various other software. It is a part of the GNU Binutils package.

The GAS executable is named , the standard name for a Unix assembler. GAS is cross-platform, and both runs on and assembles for a number of different computer architectures. GAS is free software released under the GNU General Public License v3.

==History==
The first version of GAS was released in 1986–1987. It was written by Dean Elsner and supported the VAX architecture.

==General syntax==
GAS supports a general syntax that works for all of the supported architectures. The general syntax includes assembler directives and a method for commenting. The default syntax is AT&amp;T syntax.

===Directives===
GAS uses assembler directives (also known as pseudo ops), which are keywords beginning with a period that behave similarly to preprocessor directives in the C programming language. While most of the available assembler directives are valid regardless of the target architecture, some directives are machine dependent.

Since version 2.10, Intel syntax can be used through use of the codice_1 directive.

===Comments===
GAS supports two comment styles.

Multi-line

As in C, multi-line comments start and end with mirroring slash-asterisk pairs:
comment


Single-line

Single line comments have a few different formats varying on which architecture is being assembled for.
* A hash symbol (#) — i386, x86-64, i960, 68HC11, 68HC12, VAX, V850, M32R, PowerPC, MIPS, M680x0, and RISC-V
* A semicolon (;) — AMD 29k family, ARC, H8/300 family, HPPA, PDP-11, picoJava, Motorola, and M32C
* The at sign (@) — 32-bit ARM
* A double slash (//) — AArch64
* A vertical bar (|) — M680x0
* An exclamation mark (!) — Renesas SH

==Usage==
Being the back-end for a popular compiler suite, namely GCC, the GNU Assembler is very widely used in compiling modern free and open source software. GAS is often used as the assembler on Linux operating systems in conjunction with other GNU software. A modified version of GAS can also be found in the macOS development tools package.

==Example program==
A standard &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program for Linux on IA-32:
.global _start

.text
_start:
 movl $4, %eax # 4 (code for &quot;write&quot; syscall) -&gt; EAX register
 movl $1, %ebx # 1 (file descriptor for stdout) -&gt; EBX (1st argument to syscall)
 movl $msg, %ecx # 32-bit address of msg string -&gt; ECX (2nd argument)
 movl $len, %edx # length of msg string -&gt; EDX (3rd arg)
 int $0x80 # interrupt with location 0x80 (128), which invokes the kernel&#x27;s system call procedure

 movl $1, %eax # 1 (&quot;exit&quot;) -&gt; EAX
 movl $0, %ebx # 0 (with success) -&gt; EBX
 int $0x80 # see previous
.data
msg:
 .ascii &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot; # inline ascii string
 len = . - msg # assign (current address - address of msg start) to symbol &quot;len&quot;

<doc id="863406" wikidata="Q5117327" url="?curid=863406" title="Church of St Peter &amp; St Paul, Godalming">
<text>The Church of St. Peter and St. Paul is a parish church of the Church of England in Godalming, Surrey. The parish is mostly urban and excludes rural outskirts, it includes another church, St Mark&#x27;s, in which the joint clergy provide less formal and family services.

The present building, the oldest in the town, was built in the twelfth century, replacing an earlier Anglo-Saxon church. Two medieval chapels are integrated into the present building. Its core is made from the local sandstone, Bargate stone from the nearby Greensand Ridge, which is found close to the town. Also found around the church is the old Lammas, or &#x27;common&#x27;, land.

The church is set on the town centre thoroughfare, Church Street, in the urban part of the market town that doubles as a commuter and retirement town and is a Grade I-listed building.

==Social history==
;Origins

A church has stood on this site since at least the mid-ninth century. It features several carved stones, which are dated between 820 and 840. A few Anglo Saxon remnants survive in the present structure, which was largely rebuilt in the twelfth century. In 1086, the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; recorded that Ranulf Flambard, justiciar of William Rufus, held Godalming church.

The lammas, or common land, complemented a substantial glebe, the funds from which allowed for a grand and spacious structure to be built.

;The church in the European wars of religion and English Civil War
Godalming, at the end of King Charles the First&#x27;s reign, was a Calvinistic stronghold. The vicar at that time, known as Dr. Andrews, was ejected from his living in 1640, and the town welcomed the Calvinistic preacher, Thomas Edwards. As he travelled the 30 miles from London, via the Portsmouth Road, three or four times a week, he would preach to people at certain points along the road.

Some of the land around the church and the town belonged to Salisbury Cathedral, and due to the diversity of important clergymen who owned the land, in the seventeenth century &#x27;Godalming&#x27; became a byword for piety. A proverb of the time says:

:&quot;He that shall say well, do well, and think well in mind,&quot;
:&quot;Shall as soon come to heaven, as they that dwell at Godalming.&quot;

;Rectory
The rectory, which was considered a manor, was not owned by the church. Therefore, its owner appointed a vicar in 1066 named Ulmaer, who held it under Edward the Confessor. Save for 11 years of seizure under the governments of Cromwell it was held by the Dean and Chapter of Salisbury Cathedral between 1128 and 1846. In that year the Ecclesiastical Commissioners took charge of it and it was sold in 1860 to John Simmonds, who it to Mr J. Whateley Simmonds.

==Architectural history==

First built during the Anglo-Saxon and early Norman periods, the structure has been proven in ecclesiastical records to have been a redevelopment of an Anglo-Saxon church:

In the thirteenth century, the cruciform church of the Norman England was converted into a rectangle by the construction of the north and south chapels and the widening of the nave aisles. In the same century, the magnificent oak-timbered spire was constructed, which was clad in lead (and still is to this day).

Further building work followed in subsequent centuries, particularly in the fourteenth century. In the nineteenth century, the nave was lengthened and the aisles were extended westwards and widened, and the twentieth century saw the construction of a porch in 1911 and vestries in 1925.

The structure gained listed status in 1947 and is classed as Grade I.

==Services==
A weekday service of Holy Communion, in traditional language, is held on Tuesdays at 12 pm.

Holy Communion, according to the Book of Common Prayer of 1662 (in traditional language), is held every Sunday at 8 am.

On the second, third and fourth Sundays of the month, Choral Eucharist is held at 10 am.

==Chapels and paintings==

In the two chapel sections are decorative mural paintings and a medieval painting of St John the Baptist.

==Monuments==
The church has interior monuments to Judeth Elyott, d.1615: a figure of a lady kneeling before a book on a lectern in an elaborately-decorated aedicule, the cornice surmounted by coat of arms, shields, and end pedestals with skull and hour-glass, and tablet with skull and cross-bones underneath; Thomas and Joan Purvoche, d.1509, John Barker, d.1595 and John and Elizabeth Westbrook.

Wall paintings on its window frames have been re-exposed in the twenty-first century.

==Heraldic Roof Bosses==
There are currently 68 roof bosses in the nave. The bosses are not in their original settings. One notable boss is that of the arms of Thomas Howard, Earl of Surrey who defeated the Scots at Flodden on the 9th September 1513. 
==Bells==
The Church has a fine set of bells hung for the traditional English-style of bell-ringing. The tenor weighs just over a tonne and weighs in at 1221 kg.

In 2017, all of the bells were recast, with the tenor weighing two hundredweight more than previously (now weighing 24 hundredweight, 0 quarters and 4 pounds, or 1221 kg). The restoration and recasting were carried out by John Taylor &amp; Co, now Britain&#x27;s largest church-bell firm.

The bells are rung regularly for the 10 am service in Church, and ringing practice is held on Tuesday evenings.

<text>Eco-efficiency refers to the delivery of goods and services to meet human needs and improve quality of life while progressively reducing their environmental impacts of goods and resource intensity during their life-cycle.

==Terminology==
As countries and regions around the world began to develop, it slowly became evident that industrialization and economic growth come hand in hand with environmental degradation. &quot;Eco-efficiency&quot; has been proposed as one of the main tools to promote a transformation from unsustainable development to one of sustainable development. It is based on the concept of creating more goods and services while using fewer resources and creating less waste and pollution. &quot;It is measured as the ratio between the (added) value of what has been produced (e.g. GDP) and the (added) environment impacts of the product or service (e.g. CO2 emissions).&quot; The term was coined by the World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD) in its 1992 publication &quot;Changing Course&quot;. At the 1992 Earth Summit, eco-efficiency was endorsed as a new business concept and means for companies to implement Agenda 21 in the private sector. The term has now become synonymous with a management philosophy geared towards sustainability, combining ecological and economic efficiency.
==History==
Although eco-efficiency is a rather new method, the idea is not. In the early 1970s Paul R. Ehrlich and John Holdren developed the lettering formula I = PAT to describe the impact of human activity on the environment. Furthermore, the concept of eco-efficiency was first described by McIntyre and Thornton in 1978, but it wasn&#x27;t until 1992, when the term was formally coined and widely publicized by Stephan Schmidheiny in &quot;Changing Course&quot;. Schmidheiny set out &quot;to change the perception of industry as being part of the problem of environmental degradation to the reality of its becoming part - a key part - of the solution for sustainability and global development&quot;. The major drivers in the early phase of eco-efficiency&#x27;s development were the &quot;forward-looking managers and thinkers in 3M and Dow&quot;. It was their involvement which catapulted eco-efficiency into development. The results of the WBCSD&#x27;s work creating the &quot;linkage between environmental performance and the bottom line was published in 1997 in its report Environmental Performance and Shareholder Value&quot;.

==Methods==

According to the WBCSD definition, eco-efficiency is achieved through the delivery of &quot;competitively priced goods and services that satisfy human needs and bring quality of life while progressively reducing environmental impacts of goods and resource intensity throughout the entire life-cycle to a level at least in line with the Earth&#x27;s estimated carrying capacity&quot;. 
It works by implementing 4 main types of ratios. 
: &quot;The first two are environmental productivity and its inverse, environmental intensity of production, referring to the realm of production. The second pair, environmental improvement cost and its inverse, environmental cost-effectiveness, are defined from an environmental improvements measures point-of-view.&quot;
The ratios may be applied to any unit comprising economic activities because such activities always relate to cost and value, &quot;and having some physical substrate, always influence the environment.&quot; Furthermore, there are two different levels upon which to orchestrate the ratios: &quot;micro&quot; and &quot;macro&quot;. 
There are three different methods to determine eco-efficiency at the micro-level. First, &quot;incremental eco-efficiency&quot;, which &quot;specifies the effects of the total value of a product system or sector and its total concomitant environmental effects.&quot; Second, an analysis method nicknamed &quot;win-win&quot;, which &quot;gives a comparison between a historical reference situation and potentially new situations based on the use of new technologies.&quot; The win-win micro-method is limited because it cannot give a concrete answer on the question of whether it improves overall environmental performance. And the third is &quot;difference eco-efficiency&quot;, which is similar to the win-win variant, but removes all irrelevant alternatives to heighten potential for optimal technologies while comparing two alternatives.
Now the macro-level is much less defined and has shown less accurate results. However, &quot;the ultimate aim of eco-efficiency analysis is to help move micro-level decision making into macro-level optimality.&quot; The main goal in years to come is to create headline indicators to carry out macro-level analysis at a country/world scale.

There are two life-cycle assessment (LCA)–based calculation systems on eco-efficiency: the analysis method of BASF, and the method of the eco-costs value ratio of the Delft University of Technology.

==Uses==

The reduction in ecological impacts translates into an increase in resource productivity, which in turn can create a competitive advantage. According to the WBCSD, critical aspects of eco-efficiency are:
* A reduction in the material intensity of goods or services;
* A reduction in the energy intensity of goods or services;
* Reduced dispersion of toxic materials;
* Improved recyclability;
* Maximum use of renewable resources;
* Greater durability of products;
* Increased service intensity of goods and services.
Strategies that have been linked to eco-efficiency include &quot;Factor 4&quot; and &quot;Factor 10&quot;, which call for specific reductions in resource use, &quot;natural capitalism&quot;, which incorporates eco-efficiency as part of a broader strategy, and the &quot;cradle-to-cradle&quot; movement, which claims to go beyond eco-efficiency in abolishing the very idea of waste. According to Boulanger, all versions of eco-efficiency share four key characteristics:
* Confidence in technological innovation as the main solution to un-sustainability;
* Reliance on business as the principal actor of transformation. The emphasis is on firms designing new products, shifting to new production processes, and investing in R&amp;D, etc., more than on the retailer or the consumer, let alone the citizen.
* Trust in markets (if they are functioning well);
* &quot;Growthphilia&quot;: the idea that there is nothing wrong with growth as such.

The view that improvements in eco-efficiency are sufficient for achieving sustainability has been challenged by Huesemann and Huesemann, who demonstrate using extensive historical evidence that increases in technological efficiency have not reduced overall resource use and pollution. Moreover, with &quot;cradle-to-cradle&quot;, growth is conducive to sustainability &quot;per se&quot;. This broader concept is called &quot;Sustainable Production and Consumption&quot; (SPC). &quot;This concept involves changes in production and consumption patterns that lead to sustainable use of natural resources;&quot; business has taken a key role in accelerating the use of this concept because businesses both consume and produce. Eco-efficiency is routinely a concept used because it combines performance along two of the three axes of sustainable development, making it easier for academics and leading thinkers to tease out the associated social issues.

===Examples===
Furthermore, eco-efficiency can adapt and flex to be fit different sizes of companies, while also maintaining relevance with the larger scale of government and national policies. For example, larger national players such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD 2002), European Commission (EU 2005), European Environment Agency (EEA) and the National Round Table on the Environment and the Economy (NRTEE) have all recognized that eco-efficiency is a practical approach that businesses should adopt in setting and achieving their environmental performance objectives. It has been proven to heighten market values for firms, serve as an effective management tool for governments, benefit civil society, and increase quality of life. &quot;It does this by changing industrial processes, creating new products and changing and influencing markets with new ideas and with new rules.&quot; More people aim to get more value for their money in the market, while also enjoying a better environment.

Eco-efficiency is also implemented in more non-traditional ways, such as the integration of environmental criteria into the credit approval process; looking at &quot;eco-integrated economic risks of a customer&quot;. Besides, it plays a growing role where &quot;eco-efficient choices are always preferred,&quot; especially in service sectors such as tourism (see ecotourism).

<text>The Plymouth Laser is a two-door 2+2 sports coupe sold by Plymouth from 1989 until 1994. The Laser and its siblings, the Mitsubishi Eclipse and Eagle Talon, were the first vehicles produced under the newly formed Diamond-Star Motors, a joint-venture between the Chrysler Corporation and the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation.

==Overview==
Introduced as &quot;the first Plymouth of the &#x27;90s&quot; in advertising, the Plymouth Laser debuted in January 1989 as a 1990 model. The company produced a Chrysler Laser model from 1984 to 1986. The 2-door hatchback was based on the Dodge Daytona model prior to the name badge moving, to the Plymouth brand. Commercials for the 1990 Laser featured R&amp;B singer Tina Turner who appeared in a series of 1990 promotional ads for Plymouth. With three available engines, two transmission offerings, and sporty &quot;aero&quot; styling, the Laser was the most performance-oriented Plymouth since the Barracuda, Duster, and Road Runner muscle cars of the 1970s.

Despite its close resemblance to its Mitsubishi and Eagle siblings, it has several unique styling cues intended to set it apart from the other two. Apart from badging, Lasers sport a race-inspired look, with a plastic panel in the place of a grille, a full rear light-bar, a bulge on the hood for 2.0 L engine models (not necessarily turbocharged), and available stylish &quot;lace&quot; patterned alloy wheels. Rallye Sport (RS), models are set apart from the base models by their black roof with body-colored targa band, power steering, lower bodyside accent striping, and dual power mirrors, as well as an array of options not available on base Lasers.

Base model Lasers carry a 1.8 L four-cylinder engine, whereas a , 2.0 L 16-valve DOHC four-cylinder was optional with the Laser RS. The top-of-the-line RS Turbo came equipped with a 2.0 L DOHC 16-valve turbocharged 4-cylinder engine rated at . A 5-speed manual transmission was standard. A 4-speed automatic was optional, except with the turbocharged engine, which could only be ordered with the manual transmission until 1991 models debuted.

==Model history==

===Model year changes===

1990: the Plymouth Laser was released in January 1989 as a 1990 model. Three models were initially offered: base, RS, and RS Turbo. The similar Mitsubishi Eclipse was also released in 1989, and the Eagle Talon soon followed. The RS models, among other options could be equipped with a factory-installed CD player, a first such option on any Plymouth.

1991: the Laser received anti-lock brakes (ABS), and the turbocharged engine could now be ordered with an automatic transmission.

1992: the Laser received cosmetic changes for 1992, and a new all-wheel-drive (AWD) model joined the lineup. The RS Turbo AWD came only with a manual transmission, while the front-wheel drive version could still be ordered with an automatic. There was also a freshening to the hood and front and rear fascias. The pop-up headlights were removed in favor of multi-form fixed headlights, making the car look more aerodynamic. The rear lightbar was replaced by two separate taillights. The RS model came with alloy wheels and other cosmetic differences. The RS could also be ordered with the Gold Package, which featured gold-trimmed wheels, pin stripes, and graphics. Only a limited number of RSs with this package were built.

1993: AWD Lasers could now be ordered with an automatic transmission. With the automatic, the power rating of turbocharged models dropped to . All Lasers except for the base model could be equipped with ABS.

1994: Production of the Laser ended on June 3, 1994., due to poor sales. Nothing, including the price, was changed.

==Awards==
The Laser &quot;Turbo&quot; was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list from 1989 through 1992.

==Discontinuation==
The Plymouth Laser was not a major sales success. It did not sell as well as the Eagle Talon, and certainly not as well as the Mitsubishi Eclipse. Several factors influenced this. First, the Laser was a product of badge engineering, therefore it had to compete with two other cars that were virtually identical. Compounding the problem, it faced in-house competition from the Talon, as the Eagle brand was also owned by Chrysler. Where Plymouth was generally marketed as the value-oriented, mainstream brand, Chrysler was trying to market Eagle as their performance brand. Due to this, a much heavier amount of advertising was devoted to the Talon. The fact that the Laser was far different from any other product Plymouth was selling at the time did not help its popularity. In the early 1990s, Plymouth&#x27;s bread and butter lineup still consisted of K-car-derived cars and minivans; the Laser simply did not fit into this group.

Due to these factors, the Laser was discontinued after a brief run of 1994 models. This failure of badge-engineering was just a preview of what would happen to the whole Plymouth marque in subsequent years. The Laser&#x27;s discontinuation coincided with the introduction of its successor, the 1995 Plymouth Neon. The Neon was available as a two-door coupe and a four-door sedan and was a far better sales success than the Laser. The Mitsubishi Eclipse and Eagle Talon were both redesigned for 1995. The Talon became Eagle&#x27;s last surviving model in 1998; the car and the Eagle marque were both dropped after that year. The Eclipse continued until the 2012 model year.

<doc id="863414" wikidata="Q8068113" url="?curid=863414" title="Zdzisław Marchwicki">
<text>Zdzisław Marchwicki (18 October 1927 – 26 April 1977), known as The Zagłębie Vampire (), was an alleged Polish serial killer who, together with several accomplices, was convicted of killing 14 women and attacking 7 others around the country from 1964 to 1970. For this, Marchwicki was executed in 1977, but since then his guilt has been questioned.

==Early life==
Zdzisław Marchwicki was born on 18 October 1927, in a dysfunctional family from Dąbrowa Górnicza. His father Józef had married five times and had four children from his marriages. Later on, all of his siblings would aid Zdzisław in his crimes. Due to his lack of interest in studying and average intelligence, Marchwicki failed to graduate from school.

==Murders==
From 1964, a series of atrocious crimes took place on the territories of the Dąbrowa Basin and Upper Silesia, continuing (with short interruptions) until 1970. In total, 19 women were attacked, 14 of which were fatal. The Vampire&#x27;s modus operandi consisted of stalking the chosen victim, running up and hitting them in the back of the head with a blunt object, then beating the victim until she died. In some cases, he had sexually abused the corpses, but never raped them, as no trace of his sperm was found in their bodies. Some of the women were left with exposed genitalia, with one having her pubic mound cut.

On 7 November 1964, the body of 15-year-old Anna Mycek was discovered in Katowice&#x27;s Dąbrówka Mała district. The autopsy established that she had been killed by blunt force trauma to the head, inflicted with a heavy object, and the offender had hit her several times post-mortem. He then dragged the body about ten meters away, unbuttoned her coat, lifted her skirts and exposed her genitals. Despite an investigation by the MoD, nobody was arrested. In the following months, several attacks on women were recorded: on 20 January 1965, Ewa Pakan was found dead in Czeladź, followed by the murder of Lidia Nowacka in Będzin on 17 March and the non-fatal attack on Irena Szymańska in the same city on 14 May. Due to their similarities, the crimes were connected as serial in nature, and since the killer attacked in the vicinity of the Dąbrowa Basin, which is also known as the Zagłębie Dąbrowskie, he was nicknamed &quot;The Zagłębie Vampire&quot;.

However, since Polish operatives had not yet encountered such a vicious criminal, a special summit was held in the second half of July 1965 by the provincial administration of the Ministry of Defence, which combined all the known cases into one investigation. Despite the fact that the authorities remained silent about the murders, rumours about the Vampire quickly spread, sending the local populace and that of nearby Silesia into fear. Female residents from Sosnowiec, Będzin, Dąbrowa Górnicza, Czeladź, Siemianowice Śląskie and even Katowice were afraid to go outside in the evening, prompting their husbands to escort them during the night. Another rumour claimed that the Vampire intended to kill a thousand women to commemorate Poland&#x27;s millennium. Policewomen were dispatched as &#x27;decoys&#x27; in an attempt to apprehend the killer, without any success.

In 1965, a total of 11 attacks were attributed to the Zagłębie Vampire, which further hampered investigators. On 12 November, the body of Jolanta Gierek, the niece of the First Secretary of the Polish&#x27;s People Republic, Edward Gierek, was fished out of the Przemsza river in Będzin. While Gierek had little interaction with his niece, Jolanta&#x27;s murder resulted in the apprehension and punishment of the criminal to become top-priority, and the Vampire was labelled public enemy number one.

Following this killing, the murder of a previous victim in July, Maria Gomółka, was examined under a different lens: it was suggested that she had been killed in anti-communist action, as her surname was similar to that of politician Władysław Gomułka, and the fact that she had been killed on 22 July - the date for which the Constitution of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic was signed and the Polish Committee of National Liberation was established. Another victim, Jadwiga Sąsiek, had two high-ranking militia operatives in her family, and her brother was on duty at the police station in Będzin.

In 1968, the Polish authorities finally appealed to citizens of the voivodeship to provide any information that could lead to the arrest of the Vampire, offering a reward of one million zlotys. As a result, numerous false denunciations were sent to the police, both against neighbours and family members, which preoccupied the police with letters and phone calls. Each of these denunciations was carefully examined, and some even helped solve unrelated crimes.

At a meeting with the head of the Homicide Division of the Ministry of Defence, Col. Jerzy Muniak and Brigadier General Jerzy Gruba proposed a new, hitherto unused method of investigation, which the task force accepted. This consisted of compiling 483 known supposed characteristics of the Vampire, both physical and mental, which were then compared with those of the thousands of male residents of the Dąbrowa Basin. Following this, 267 potential suspects remained, and in fourth place was Zdzisław Marchwicki. For various reasons, the other top three suspects were later eliminated, and more attention was paid to Marchwicki, but authorities could not yet arrest him, as there was no direct evidence of his guilt. On 4 March 1970, renowned philologist and the first teacher of Silesian literature at the Silesian University in Katowice, 46-year-old Jadwiga Kucianka, was brutally murdered. This shocking crime was quickly attributed to the Vampire, but it was also established that in this case, he had not acted alone. A mentally ill craftsman from Sosnoweic, Piotr Olszowy, confessed to being the Vampire when he was interrogated for the crime, but was released due to lack of evidence. Not long after, on the night of 14–15 March, he killed his family and later committed suicide by setting the house on fire while still inside. As his corpse had been charred, no fingerprints could be taken and compared to those left behind by the Vampire on the crime scenes. Just three days prior, the militia had received an anonymous letter stating: &quot;This was the last murder, there will be no more and you will never catch me&quot;.

==Arrest, trial and execution==
In November 1971, the police received a letter from Maria Marchwicki, in which she accused her husband Zdzisław of abusing her and their children, and also claimed that he was the Vampire. Because of this, on 6 January 1972, Marchwicki was arrested in Dąbrowa Górnicza. Three days after his arrest, newspapers published information about the arrest of a suspect in the murders, which was carried out by Brig. Gen. Gruba himself. There are several versions as to what Marchwicki may have said during his arrest: according to technician Wiesław Tomaszek, he said &quot;Have you arrived in two Volgas for the sake of one person? How many of you are here - no more, no less, as the Vampire himself has been grabbed&quot;; in the court files, he is recorded as saying &quot;Well, now, finally, the Vampire has been caught&quot;. Almost immediately after his arrest, the task force was split into two groups: those who believed that Marchwicki was guilty (chief among them being Gruba) and those who strongly doubted it (among these were Colonels Zygmunt Kalisz and Stefan Tokarz, Lt. Zbigniew Gątarz and prosecutor Leszek Polański). Marchwicki himself denied responsibility, but behaved oddly at interrogations, talking about supposedly undisclosed murders, and when asked to sign the protocol, he wrote at the bottom that &quot;this is all a lie&quot;. At one point, he took the protocol and attempted to swallow it.

Meanwhile, the investigators also arrested his accomplices in the murder of Kucianka: they turned out to be his brothers, Henryk and Jan. Henryk was arrested on 21 May 1972, followed by Jan three days later. The latter, an employee for the administration at the Faculty of Law at the Silesian University, had come into conflict with Kucianka, who had accused him of accepting bribes from applicants and claimed that his sexual orientation sullied the university&#x27;s reputation. At the same time, while he was a secret informant for the security service, Jan feared that Kucianka would report him to the rector Kazimierz Popelek, so he persuaded Zdzisław to kill her with his help. On 4 July, the investigators also arrested the Marchwickis&#x27; sister, Halina Flak, and on 11 November, Jan&#x27;s lover, Józef Klimczak (who later testified that Jan had indeed participated in the murder) was also arrested. The final arrest occurred on 29 December, when Flak&#x27;s son, Zdzisław, was also detained.

The investigation into the case lasted over two years, with the case file consisting of 166 volumes. The trial began on 18 September 1974, at the venue Klub Fabryczny Zakłady Zynkowe &quot;Silesia&quot; (Factory Club of Zakłady Zynkowe) in Katowice; due to the notoriety of the proceedings, people were only allowed to enter by purchasing a special ticket. The hearing was chaired by Justice Władysław Ochman and prosecuted by Józef Gurgul and Zenon Kopiński; Marchwicki&#x27;s attorneys were well-known lawyers Bolesław Andrysiak and Mieczysław Frelich. The main defendant, Zdzisław Marchwicki, was charged with 23 crimes, the most serious of which were 14 murders and 7 attempted murders. The charges seemed sensible to the court, as he had a history of beating his family members, disrespecting police officers, embezzlement of public property and other offences. His brother, Jan, was charged with 8 crimes, the most notable of which was inciting and participating in the murder of Jadwiga Kucianka. Henryk Marchwicki and Józef Klimczak were accused of complicity in Kucianka&#x27;s murder (Henryk was additionally charged with stealing her clock); Halina Flak was charged with selling stolen property, and her son Zdzisław was accused of not reporting any of the crimes to the authorities.

On 28 July 1975, the court announced the verdicts for all six defendants: Zdzisław and Jan Marchwicki were given the death penalty; Henryk - 25 years; Klimczak - 12 years; Halina and Zdzisław Flak - 4 years.

At 21:00 on 26 April 1977, Zdzisław Marchwicki was hanged in a specially-built police garage in Katowice; his brother Jan was executed in another garage an hour later. Both were buried in graves marked only with numbers in a special cemetery designated for criminals. Zdzisław&#x27;s grave, at number 39, was next to that of another serial killer, Bogdan Arnold. In 1997, after the abolition of the death penalty in the country, the cemetery was destroyed by decree of the President, Aleksander Kwaśniewski.

===Aftermath for accomplices===
* Henryk Marchwicki was remanded to a prison in Rzeszów to serve his 25-year sentence. While he was imprisoned, the militia harassed his family, demanding that his wife divorce him and change her name, or else they would imprison her and put the children in an orphanage. In 1985, they were falsely informed that Henryk had died in prison, but in 1990, the wife found from the media that her husband was still alive. Even when he was still in prison, Henryk began a campaign to clear his and his brothers&#x27; names, which he continued following his release in November 1992. In 1998, he died under suspicious circumstances, with the official cause of death being given as him falling down the stairs and breaking his spine, before going back up, going to bed and succumbing to his injuries while in a drunken stupor. The investigation into his death was later discontinued.
* Halina and Zdzisław Flak were both released from prison; the former was granted amnesty, while the latter had his sentence reduced to 32 months and released.
* Józef Klimczak was released in February 1982 due to prison overcrowding, and now lives in a large city in northern Poland (some sources erroneously claimed that he had emigrated to Sweden). He is married and has a child. Police files indicate that the militia blackmailed him into cooperating with the investigation under the pseudonym &quot;Jastrząb&quot;, but he gave only one interview and then categorically refused to cooperate further.

==Doubts of guilt==
There is much confusion about the Zagłębie Vampire&#x27;s true identity. The 2001–2002 series &quot;Paragraf 148 – Kara śmierci&quot; had an episode on the case, directed by Maciej Żurawski, which presented Marchwicki as innocent. The episode presents testimony from contemporary militia officers and lawyers, and claims that the whole case was a show trial. In a similar vein, director Maciej Pieprzyca produced the 1998 documentary &quot;Jestem mordercą...&quot;, in which he proclaimed that Marchwicki was innocent.

In the nineties, information appeared that undermined the fairness of the court. Attention was drawn to the fact that Zdzisław Marchwicki had never pleaded guilty, and that he was identified only by people who thought he corresponded to the perpetrator&#x27;s suspected profile. The authorities were eager to convict somebody, and since Piotr Olszowy, the only alternative suspect, had committed suicide by self-immolation, it would bring shame on the justice system to not bring the purported killer to trial. The case remains controversial to this day.

<text>The CSA Group (formerly the Canadian Standards Association; CSA) is a standards organization which develops standards in 57 areas. CSA publishes standards in print and electronic form, and provides training and advisory services. CSA is composed of representatives from industry, government, and consumer groups.

CSA began as the Canadian Engineering Standards Association (CESA) in 1919, federally chartered to create standards. During World War I, lack of interoperability between technical resources led to the formation of a standards committee.

CSA is accredited by the Standards Council of Canada, a crown corporation which promotes voluntary standardization in Canada. This accreditation verifies that CSA is competent to carry out standards development and certification functions, and is based on internationally recognised criteria and procedures.

The CSA registered mark shows that a product has been independently tested and certified to meet recognized standards for safety or performance.

==History==
During World War I, lack of interoperability between technical resources led to frustration, injury, and death. Britain requested that Canada form a standards committee.

Sir John Kennedy, as chairman of the Civil Engineers&#x27; Canadian Advisory Committee, led the investigation into the necessity of an independent Canadian standards organization. As a result, the Canadian Engineering Standards Association (CESA) was established in 1919. CESA was federally chartered to create standards. At the beginning, they attended to specific needs: aircraft parts, bridges, building construction, electrical work, and wire rope. The first standards issued by CESA were for steel railway bridges, in 1920.
In 1927, CESA published the Canadian Electrical Code. Enforcing the code called for product testing, and in 1933, the Hydro-Electric Power Commission of Ontario became the sole source for testing nationwide. In 1940, CESA assumed responsibility for testing and certifying electrical products intended for sale and installation in Canada. CESA was renamed the Canadian Standards Association (CSA) in 1944. The certification mark was introduced in 1946.
Known in the French-language as &quot;Association canadienne de normalisation&quot;, CSA used the French-language acronym of ACNOR. The initialism &quot;CSA&quot; is now used in both official languages.

In the 1950s, CSA established international alliances in Britain, Japan, and the Netherlands, to expand its scope in testing and certification. Testing labs were expanded from their first in Toronto, to labs in Montreal, Vancouver, and Winnipeg.

In the 1960s, CSA developed national occupational health and safety standards, creating standards for headgear and safety shoes. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, the CSA began to expand its involvement in consumer standards, including bicycles, credit cards, and child resistant packaging for drugs.

Tom Pashby became chairman of the CSA in 1975, serving for two decades to set standards for manufacturers of ice hockey helmets and lacrosse helmets.

In 1984, CSA established QMI, the Quality Management Institute for registration of ISO9000 and other standards. In 1999, CSA International was established to provide international product testing and certification services while CSA shifted its primary focus to standards development and training. In 2001, these three divisions were joined under the name &quot;CSA Group&quot;. In 2004, OnSpeX was launched as the fourth division of CSA Group. In 2008, QMI was sold to SAI-Global for $40 million.

In 2009, CSA purchased SIRA.

==Standards development==

CSA exists to develop standards. Among the fifty-seven different areas of specialization are business management and safety and performance standards, including those for electrical and electronic equipment, industrial equipment, boilers and pressure vessels, compressed gas handling appliances, environmental protection, and construction materials.

Most standards are voluntary, meaning there are no laws requiring their application. Despite that, adherence to standards is beneficial to companies because it shows products have been independently tested to meet certain standards. The CSA mark is a registered certification mark, and can only be applied by someone who is licensed or otherwise authorised to do so by the CSA.

CSA developed the CAN/CSA Z299 series, now called N299, of quality assurance standards, which are still in use today. They are an alternative to the ISO 9001 quality management standard, specific to companies supplying goods to nuclear power plants. Currently forty percent of all the standards issued by CSA are referenced in Canadian legislation.

Laws in many jurisdictions in North America require that certain products be tested for standards compliance by a body officially recognized for that purpose. CSA Group is accredited to do so in a variety of areas by the SCC in Canada and OSHA in the United States (as a Nationally Recognized Testing Laboratory).

<text>Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer (; 31 October 1835 – 20 August 1917) was a German chemist who synthesised indigo and developed a nomenclature for cyclic compounds (that was subsequently extended and adopted as part of the IUPAC organic nomenclature). He was ennobled in the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1885 and was the 1905 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.

==Family and education==

Baeyer was born in Berlin as the son of the noted geodesist and captain of the Royal Prussian Army Johann Jacob Baeyer and his wife Eugenie Baeyer née Hitzig (1807–1843). Both his parents were Lutherans at the time of his birth and he was raised in the Lutheran religion. His mother was the daughter of Julius Eduard Hitzig and a member of the originally Jewish Itzig family, and had converted to Christianity before marrying his father, who was of non-Jewish German descent. Baeyer had four sisters: Clara (born 1826) Emma (born 1831), Johanna (Jeanette) (born 1839), Adelaide (died 1843) and two brothers: Georg (born 1829) and Edward (born 1832). Baeyer lost his mother at a young age while she was giving birth to his sister Adelaide.

Although his birth name was Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf Baeyer, he was known simply as Adolf throughout most of his life. The poet Adelbert von Chamisso and the astronomer Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel were his godparents. On his 50th birthday he was raised to the hereditary nobility by King Ludwig II of Bavaria, conferring on him the &quot;von&quot; distinction.

Baeyer became interested in science early, performing experiments on plant nutrition at his paternal grandfather&#x27;s Müggelsheim farm as a boy. In Berlin he began chemical experimentation at the age of nine. Three years later, he synthesized a previously unknown chemical compound -double carbonate of copper and sodium. On his 13th birthday, he initiated his lifework, buying a chunk of indigo worth two Thalers for his first dye experiments.

When a schoolboy, his chemistry teacher at the Friedrich Wilhelm Gymnasium appointed him as his assistant. After graduating from secondary school in 1853, he entered the Berlin University to study physics and mathematics. A stint in the Prussian army interrupted his study until 1856, when he returned to academia at the University of Heidelberg, intending to study chemistry under Robert Bunsen. After an argument with the renowned chemist he changed his mentor to August Kekulé. He continued to collaborate with Kekulé even after he returned to Berlin in 1858 for the completion of his doctorate on arsenic methyl chloride, or cacodylic chloride.

==Academic career and achievements==
After completing his doctorate, he followed Kekulé to the University of Ghent, when Kekulé became professor there. He became a lecturer at the (Royal Trade Academy) in 1860 and a professor at the University of Strasbourg in 1871. In 1875, he succeeded Justus von Liebig as Chemistry Professor at the University of Munich.

Baeyer&#x27;s chief achievements include the synthesis and description of the plant dye indigo, the discovery of the phthalein dyes, and the investigation of polyacetylenes, oxonium salts, nitroso compounds (1869) and uric acid derivatives (1860 and onwards) (including the discovery of barbituric acid (1864), the parent compound of the barbiturates). He was the first to propose the correct formula for indole in 1869, after publishing the first synthesis three years earlier. His contributions to theoretical chemistry include the &#x27;strain&#x27; (&quot;Spannung&quot;) theory of triple bonds and strain theory in small carbon rings.

In 1871 he discovered the synthesis of phenolphthalein by condensation of phthalic anhydride with two equivalents of phenol under acidic conditions (hence the name). That same year he was the first to obtain synthetic fluorescein, a fluorophore pigment which is similar to naturally occurring pyoverdin that is synthesised by microorganisms (e.g., by some fluorescent strains of &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;). Baeyer named his finding &quot;resorcinphthalein&quot; as he had synthesised it from phthalic anhydride and resorcinol. The term fluorescein would not start to be used until 1878.

In 1872 he experimented with phenol and formaldehyde; the resinous product was a precursor for Leo Baekeland&#x27;s later commercialization of Bakelite.

In 1881 the Royal Society of London awarded Baeyer the Davy Medal for his work with indigo. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1884. In 1905 he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;in recognition of his services in the advancement of organic chemistry and the chemical industry, through his work on organic dyes and hydroaromatic compounds&quot;, and he continued in full active work as one of the best-known teachers in the world of organic chemistry up to within a year of his death.

His name is reflected in various &quot;name reactions&quot; as the Baeyer–Villiger oxidation and Baeyer&#x27;s reagent. There is also the Von Baeyer nomenclature in structural chemistry and Baeyer strain theory (which granted him the Nobel prize) of alicyclic compounds.

In 2009 von Baeyer lunar crater was named after him.

== Personal life ==
In 1868, Baeyer married Adelheid (Lida) Bendemann, the daughter of a family friend, and together the couple had three children: Eugenie, Hans, and .

He died on 20 August 1917 in Starnberg at the age of 81.

<text>Jake Hess (December 24, 1927 – January 4, 2004) was an American Grammy Award-winning southern gospel singer.

==Life==
The son of &quot;a sharecropper who was a shape-note singing-school teacher,&quot; Hess was born in Mt. Pisgah, near Athens, in Limestone County, Alabama. His parents were Stovall and Lydia Hess. He was the youngest of 12 children.

Hess&#x27;s entry on the Encyclopedia of Alabama&#x27;s website says of his name: &quot;His parents did not officially name him, so the attending physician entered his name as &#x27;Man Child&#x27; Hess in official documents.&quot;

When he registered with the draft board in Lincoln, Nebraska, he gave his name as &quot;William Jesse Hess.&quot; In 1997, when Hess was preparing to get a passport to travel overseas, he discovered that his birth certificate actually read Manchild Hess. His son, Jake Jr., named his recording company Manchild Records in honor of his father.

==Career==
Hess&#x27; career started at the age of 16, when he joined the popular John Daniel Quartet in 1943, making his recorded debut on &quot;Just a Prayer Away&quot;. (He had previously sung with Louie Auten and the Tennessee Valley Boys.) After that, he sang with three of his brothers as the Hess Brothers Quartet. He also sang with the Sunny South Quartet and their rival, the Melody Masters Quartet. In the latter part of his life, Hess sang with The Old Friends Quartet which was featured on the Bill Gaither Homecoming videos.

===Statesmen Quartet===
Hess sang lead with the Statesmen Quartet from 1948 until 1963. Their recordings included projects long-term with RCA Victor. In 1977-1978 Hess reunited with the surviving members of The Statesmen Quartet, Hovie Lister, Doy Ott, and Rosie Rozell to record three projects, including &quot;Songs Elvis Loved&quot;. The reunited Statesmen sang at Presley&#x27;s funeral. In the fall of 1980, Hess, Lister, and Rozell assembled a new group with James Blackwood and J.D. Sumner. As a result, the southern gospel group the Masters V was born. They toured from 1981 until 1988 when illnesses prompted several of the members to retire from full-time singing.

===Jake Hess and the Jordanaires===

===The Imperials===
Upon leaving the Statesmen Quartet at the end of 1963, Hess formed his &quot;dream&quot; group, the Imperials. Although they were not immediately accepted by his peers because of their innovative use of electric guitars and drums, they went on to become pioneers in Contemporary Christian Music, and would eventually be inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame. They backed Elvis Presley from 1966 to 1971. Presleys has been quoted as noting Hess as his favorite singer. Hess left the Imperials in 1967 due to health problems.

===The Jake Hess Sound===
Hess also sang with his children, Becky and Chris, in a group he named &quot;The Jake Hess Sound&quot;. In the late 1970s, Hess and his son Chris were featured singers on the television broadcasts of evangelist Dr. Gene Scott.

===With Elvis Presley===
Jake Hess was an idol of Presley, and had a major influence on Presley&#x27;s career. As a teenager, Presley would attend gospel sings and Hess&#x27;s style so impressed Presley, that Presley would emulate it for the remainder of his life. Hess sang backup on several albums recorded by Presley, and also sang at Presley&#x27;s funeral in 1977.

===Solo career===
Hess was a noted soloist in his own right. He had won several Grammy Awards on RCA Victor as a solo artist. His last 12 years, he appeared on the Gaither Homecoming concerts and videos. These videos featured Hess from noted concerts in the U.S. at the Kennedy Center, the Ryman Auditorium, and Hawaiian islands and Europe.

===Television===
Hess had &quot;The Jake Hess Show&quot; on WLAC in Nashville, Tennessee and performed in the &quot;Old Time Singing Convention&quot;.

==Family==
Hess and Joyce McWaters were married on October 5, 1952. They had three children.

Jake Hess, Jr. has become a well-known southern gospel songwriter, in addition to being married to Judy Martin of The Martins. In 1989 Jake&#x27;s nephew Steve Hess &amp; Eugene Baker (Hess &amp; Baker, Skylite/Sing) were in Nashville to record several segments on &quot;Bobby Jones Gospel&quot; (BET Network). Jake accompanied them to the studio and liked what he heard. While they were visiting with Jake in Brentwood, he asked whether they would be interested in forming with him a new version of Jake Hess &amp; Friends. The group would ultimately consist of Jake, Steve, Eugene &amp; Chris, Jake&#x27;s son. They started rehearsals in Jake&#x27;s family room and started touring later in the year. There were several dates in Missouri and Florida, but Jake determined that the traveling was going to be more demanding than he anticipated, so by 1990 the tours were put on hold with the possibility of doing something with television.

==Book==
In 1995, Hess&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Nothin&#x27; but Fine: The Music and the Gospel According to Jake Hess&quot;, was published by Buckland Press.

==Death==
Hess died January 4, 2004, in Opelika, Alabama after suffering a heart attack December 14, 2003, just days after a performance in Atlanta, Georgia.

He was survived by a daughter, two sons, 10 grandchildren, one great-grandchild and a sister.

<text>Weekly Alibi, commonly referred to as The Alibi, was a free weekly news, arts, culture, and entertainment newspaper and website in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The main features were the website&#x27;s award-winning news section, featuring cultural commentary by August March; the calendar listings; reviews and guides to arts; art criticism; entertainment news; music interviews; and film reviews by noted film critic/Managing Editor Devin O&#x27;Leary. Its &quot;Chowtown&quot; restaurant guide and its &quot;Best of Burque&quot; award issues, which covered everything from &quot;Best Community Action Group&quot; and &quot;Best All-You-Can-Eat&quot; to &quot;Best Gay Bar&quot; were popular features of Weekly Alibi.

Originally the newspaper was a bi-weekly newspaper called &quot;NuCity&quot;, but changed its name due to a similar Chicago newspaper entitled &quot;Newcity&quot;.

The newspaper and website were members of the Association of Alternative Newsmedia as well as the National Newspaper Association.

The &quot;Weekly Alibi&quot; is closed; its last edition was published in late August, 2020.

<doc id="863435" wikidata="Q757967" url="?curid=863435" title="California State Route 82">
<text>State Route 82 (SR 82) is a state highway in the U.S. state of California that runs from Interstate 880 (I-880) in San Jose to I-280 in San Francisco following the San Francisco Peninsula. It is the spinal arterial road of the peninsula and runs parallel to the nearby Caltrain line along much of the route. For much of its length, the highway is named El Camino Real and formed part of the historic El Camino Real mission trail. It passes through and near the historic downtowns of many Peninsula cities, including Burlingame, San Mateo, Redwood City, Menlo Park, Palo Alto, Mountain View, Sunnyvale, and Santa Clara, and through some of the most walkable and transit-oriented neighborhoods in the region.

==Route description==
At its south end SR 82 starts as The Alameda at I-880 in San Jose. Once it enters Santa Clara, it bends north-east around Santa Clara University and onto El Camino Real, where it continues for the remainder of its trip up the San Francisco Peninsula, paralleling the Caltrain corridor. SR 82, generally called &quot;El Camino&quot; by local residents, runs through a number of cities on the Peninsula, including Palo Alto (passing by Stanford University), San Carlos, San Mateo, Burlingame, and Millbrae, and it is a central artery of the Peninsula communities through which it passes.

In Daly City, SR 82 becomes Mission Street, connecting with San Francisco&#x27;s Mission Street, but then quickly flows onto San Jose Avenue, crossing Alemany Boulevard, and terminating at I-280.

SR 82 takes an inland course paralleling US 101. The entire route is at street level with at least four lanes of traffic; no portions of it exist as a freeway, although the route is occasionally a divided highway. The Bayshore Freeway and I-280 tend to provide faster alternatives than Route 82 even during traffic jams on those freeways.

From 1964 to 1968, SR 82 continued past its current end north on Alemany Boulevard to Bayshore Boulevard in San Francisco (see below).

Prior to 2013, SR 82 continued past its current south end on The Alameda, becoming Santa Clara Street in Downtown San Jose then turning south on Montgomery Street (southbound) / Autumn Street (northbound); then it turned east on San Carlos Street It turned south on Market Street, which becomes First Street and then Monterey Highway. It followed Monterey Highway until it turned east briefly on Blossom Hill Road, where it ended at US 101. This relinquished segment south of I-880 within San Jose is legally no longer a state highway, but the state&#x27;s Streets and Highways Code mandates that the City of San Jose is still required to maintain &quot;signs directing motorists to the continuation of Route 82&quot; and &quot;ensure the continuity of traffic flow&quot; on this segment. Signs along US 101, I-280, and SR 87 where these relinquished segments intersect still have SR 82 shields. Though as of 2017, certain signs with SR 82 shields have been removed along US 101 near Blossom Hill Road and Capitol Expressway.

SR 82 is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration.

==History==

Originally a segment of US 101 (and before that, the historic El Camino Real), the highway became completely inadequate for the needs of traffic with the rapid growth of the San Francisco Bay Area after World War II, including urbanization of the towns along its path. The Bayshore Highway to the east was originally built as &quot;Bypass (BYP) US 101&quot; and was upgraded to a freeway in 1937. With this upgrade, the original US 101 route was transferred to the Bayshore Freeway, and El Camino Real became US 101 BYP, but in response to protests, the switch in designations was reversed two years later, in 1939, and the Bayshore Freeway remained US 101 BYP until 1964.

In 1964, US 101 was moved again onto the Bayshore Freeway, and its former alignment on El Camino Real became SR 82. It was defined as two portions: From Route (US) 101 near Ford Road south of San Jose to Route (US) 101 in San Francisco (which today corresponds to the Alemany Maze), and from Route (US) 101 near Alemany Boulevard to Route (SR) 87 (current unconstructed SR 230) in San Francisco. In 1968, the portions from I-280 (at current SR 82) to US 101 and from SR 101 to SR 87 were transferred to I-280. SR 87 was then deleted north of SR 237 in 1980, and is only constructed south of US 101, and SR 82 today is designated as part of El Camino Real.

In 2013, SR 82 was relinquished south of I-880 through San Jose. However, the state&#x27;s Streets and Highways Code states that the City of San Jose is still required to &quot;ensure the continuity of traffic flow on the relinquished former portion of Route 82&quot; along The Alameda into downtown San Jose, and from there along Monterey Road to its former terminus at Blossom Hill Road and US 101. The city also has the further option to apply to make this segment a business route.

===Grand Boulevard Initiative===
The Grand Boulevard Initiative is a partnership of nineteen Bay Area transit agencies and municipalities that operate or manage various portions of the route. Although El Camino Real is ultimately under the stewardship of Caltrans, the organization nevertheless sponsors aesthetic and infrastructural improvements along the corridor and its neighboring parcels in order to revitalize the streetscape and promote density and more walkable and transit-oriented development.

<doc id="863442" wikidata="Q831548" url="?curid=863442" title="Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence">
<text>Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence is the sixth studio album by American progressive metal band Dream Theater, released as a double-disc album on January 29, 2002, through Elektra Records. It is the first full-length Dream Theater album to feature a title track. It is also their second longest studio album to date, after &quot;The Astonishing&quot; (2016).

==Songs==
*The first track of the album, &quot;The Glass Prison&quot;, is the beginning of the Twelve-step Suite, dealing with Mike Portnoy&#x27;s story of rehabilitation from alcoholism, continued in tracks on subsequent albums (&quot;This Dying Soul&quot; on &quot;Train of Thought&quot;, &quot;The Root of All Evil&quot; on &quot;Octavarium&quot;, &quot;Repentance&quot; on &quot;Systematic Chaos&quot; and &quot;The Shattered Fortress&quot; on &quot;Black Clouds &amp; Silver Linings&quot;). &quot;The Glass Prison&quot; is composed of three parts, mirroring the first three of the twelve steps of the AA program by Bill W. for rehabilitation of alcoholics. Furthermore, it begins with the static phonograph noise that ended &quot;Finally Free&quot; on &quot;Metropolis Pt. 2: Scenes from a Memory&quot; (1999).
*&quot;Blind Faith&quot; features lyrics written by James LaBrie about questioning religious belief. It is the second longest song for which LaBrie has contributed lyrics to date, the longest being &quot;Sacrificed Sons&quot; from &quot;Octavarium&quot;. It was also the first time he had written lyrics for more than one song on an album. The next time would also be on &quot;Octavarium&quot;.
*In the song &quot;Misunderstood&quot;, John Petrucci wrote and played the guitar solo, and then reversed it. He then learned how to play this reversed version, and he tries to mimic the reversed version live with effects. This track is in its shorter radio edit form on the cassette edition.
*&quot;The Great Debate&quot; is intended to be a non-partisan song dealing with the topic of stem-cell research. It was originally titled &quot;Conflict at Ground Zero&quot; based on the lyrics in the chorus but was changed at the last minute as news reports started to refer to the site of the 9/11 terrorist attack in New York City as &quot;Ground Zero&quot;. The band was actually in a Manhattan studio conducting final mixes of the album on the day in question.
*Lyrics for the song &quot;Disappear&quot; were written by James LaBrie about the subject of death; it was originally titled &quot;Move On&quot;. This track is omitted entirely from the cassette edition.
*The sixth song, &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot;, which makes up the entire second CD (albeit split into eight separate tracks), is the longest song Dream Theater have recorded to date. While recording, they wanted to keep the song at 20 minutes, but more and more ideas came which resulted in the length doubling. Realizing that they would have to cut &quot;Disappear&quot; and &quot;Misunderstood&quot; to keep the album at one CD, their record label was now open for the idea of a double album, something the band had previously been denied when recording &quot;Images and Words&quot; and &quot;Falling into Infinity&quot;. Despite this, the cassette edition reduced &quot;Misunderstood&quot; to its radio edit version and omitted &quot;Disappear&quot; entirely.
*The last chord of &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; is used to open &quot;As I Am&quot; on the next album &quot;Train of Thought&quot;, continuing a chain which ended with &quot;Octavarium&quot;.

==Influences==
Influences for the album&#x27;s writing and recording, according to the authors, include:

*U2, &quot;Achtung Baby&quot;
*Alice in Chains, &quot;Dirt&quot;
*Béla Bartók
*Galactic Cowboys, &quot;Space in Your Face&quot;
*Kevin Gilbert,&quot;Thud&quot;
*King&#x27;s X, &quot;Faith Hope Love&quot;
*Maria Tipo, &quot;Chopin Nocturnes&quot;.
*Megadeth, &quot;Rust in Peace&quot;
*Metallica, &quot;Master of Puppets&quot;
*Nine Inch Nails, &quot;The Downward Spiral&quot;
*Pantera, &quot;Far Beyond Driven&quot;
**(and the song &quot;Mouth for War&quot;)
*Radiohead, &quot;OK Computer&quot;
**(and also a Radiohead bootleg Portnoy brought in)
*Rage Against the Machine, &quot;The Battle of Los Angeles&quot;
*Soundgarden, &quot;Superunknown&quot;
*Tool&#x27;s &quot;Ænima&quot;

<text>The Dalton School, originally the Children&#x27;s University School, is a private, coeducational college preparatory school in New York City and a member of both the Ivy Preparatory School League and the New York Interschool. The school is located in four buildings within the Upper East Side of Manhattan. In the 2024–25 academic year, tuition rates totaled $64,300.

==History==
The Dalton School, originally called the Children&#x27;s University School, was founded by Helen Parkhurst in 1919. After experimentation in her own one-room school with Maria Montessori, Parkhurst visited other progressive schools in Europe including Bedales School and its founder and headmaster John Haden Badley in England. She developed what she called the Dalton Plan, which encouraged teachers and students to work together toward individualized goals. The Laboratory Plan was first put into effect as an experiment in the high school of Dalton, Massachusetts, in 1916. The estate of her benefactor Josephine Porter Boardman, was also near the town of Dalton and from this beginning the Laboratory Plan and school eventually took their names.

In 1919, Helen Parkhurst relocated to New York City, where she opened her first school on West 74th Street. Larger facilities soon became necessary; the Lower School was moved to West 72nd Street, and the High School opened in the autumn of 1929 in the current building at 108 East 89th Street. Eleanor Roosevelt admired the work of Helen Parkhurst and played an important role in expanding the population and resources of the school by promoting a merger between the Todhunter School for girls (founded by Winifred Todhunter) and Dalton in 1939.

Enlarged and modified through the years, Dalton still celebrates many traditions like lighting candles before winter break and holding a Greek Festival. Academically, the school still subscribes to the Dalton Plan, which Parkhurst helped to create. Over the years, the Dalton Plan has been adopted by schools around the world, including schools in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Chile, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Japan, and the Netherlands.

==Admission==
As of early 2013, the overall acceptance rate for grades K–12 at Dalton was reported by Peterson&#x27;s to be 14%. Parental anxiety created by the highly competitive admission process was the subject of press coverage from 1999 to 2001. Long seen as a bastion of privilege, Dalton&#x27;s efforts to broaden its mandate for diversity have met with some difficulty. In 2010, a financial aid budget of $6.5 million supported an outreach program for socio-economic diversity at the school. As of 2008 students of color made up 38% of the Dalton First Program. In the 2008–2009 school year, the kindergarten was composed of 44% children of color. Articles in &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Atlantic&quot; have described difficulties experienced by some African-American children at the school.

&quot;American Promise&quot; was a PBS documentary that followed two African American students who enrolled at Dalton as kindergartners and the challenges they faced due to Dalton&#x27;s lack of diversity. In 2020, Dalton found itself in controversy during the broader diversity, equity, and inclusion movement that followed the murder of George Floyd. The discussions continued into the following school year and resulted in the departure of school head Jim Best.

<text>When Dream and Day Unite is the debut studio album by American progressive metal band Dream Theater, released on March 6, 1989, through Mechanic/MCA Records. The album is composed mostly of material that originally surfaced during the band&#x27;s early years as Majesty, and it is the only Dream Theater album to be recorded with their full original lineup. James LaBrie replaced Charlie Dominici as the lead vocalist on all subsequent albums.

==History==
The band was originally formed in 1985 by Berklee College of Music students John Myung (bass), Mike Portnoy (drums), and John Petrucci (guitar) under the name Majesty, which was inspired by Portnoy&#x27;s commentary on the ending of &quot;Bastille Day&quot; by Rush. After the band found a keyboardist in Petrucci&#x27;s childhood friend Kevin Moore, the band hosted auditions and settled on Chris Collins as the lead vocalist.

Majesty recorded &quot;The Majesty Demos&quot; between 1985 and 1986 but, shortly thereafter, were forced to change their name after another band threatened to take legal action. While touring around New York, Collins left the band, and the band went through many lead singers before settling in with experienced vocalist Charlie Dominici. Still trying to come up with ideas to rename their band, Portnoy&#x27;s father suggested the name Dream Theater, which was the name of a nearby movie theater. They accepted the name, and eventually signed their first recording contract with Mechanic/MCA. The album was then recorded in mid-1988 at Kajem/Victory Studios in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania, notable for the recording of &quot;&quot; by Queensrÿche, and the whole process took three weeks.

With the relatively warm reception of their original demos, the band expected their debut album to be received with much fanfare and buzz, but the album went largely unnoticed by the music industry, and eventually led to Mechanic/MCA cutting their contract ties with the band, resulting in a small club tour for the album exclusively in the New York area. They also produced two promotional singles, &quot;Status Seeker&quot; and &quot;Afterlife&quot;, whose remixes and single edits for radio were done by Terry Brown of Rush production fame. Due to tensions within the band and creative differences, Dominici was fired from the band, and they were without a lead singer until late 1990.

==15th anniversary performance==
On the 15th anniversary of the album, the band performed it in its entirety in Los Angeles. Furthermore, during two additional songs in the encore, special guests Dominici and Derek Sherinian (both now former Dream Theater members) performed along with the rest of the band; however, original keyboardist Kevin Moore did not appear. The entire performance was recorded live and first released on CD and DVD under the title &quot;When Dream and Day Reunite&quot; through Portnoy&#x27;s independent label YtseJam Records and later reissued officially via InsideOut as part of Dream Theater&#x27;s Lost Not Forgotten Archives series. The album also featured a live version of &quot;Metropolis—Part I&quot;, which was originally from the band&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Images and Words&quot;, and a performance of a B-side from &quot;Awake&quot; called &quot;To Live Forever&quot;, both originally written shortly after the release of &quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot;, and played live on the tour for the album.

==Critical reception==

&quot;When Dream and Day Unite&quot; did not receive much attention upon release. The &quot;Colorado Springs Gazette-Telegraph&quot; concluded that the music &quot;is well-intentioned, but so overplayed that it leaves the listener guessing which odd-time signature or tempo change will bolt out of the darkness next.&quot;

Due to the commercial success of &quot;Images and Words&quot;, the album later received critical reviews and criticism from many resources. Robert Taylor of AllMusic remarked an obvious Queensrÿche influence in the band&#x27;s &quot;progressive metal&quot; music and defined Petrucci and Portnoy &quot;competent musicians&quot;, whose &quot;individual styles were not yet refined&quot;; he criticized the &quot;subpar singing, too many metal clichés, and poor production&quot;, but added that the album has &quot;enough interesting playing to make it a worthwhile listen for fans of this genre.&quot; Canadian journalist Martin Popoff positively reviewed the album which contained &quot;startingly progressive yet very heavy and explosive prog metal&quot;, but criticized the &quot;clattery, thin production of Terry Date&quot; and the sound of keyboards and drums.
It is the only Dream Theater album that failed to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

<doc id="863468" wikidata="Q1276852" url="?curid=863468" title="Eagle Vision">
<text>The Eagle Vision is a full-sized, front-wheel drive four-door sports sedan produced from 1992 until 1997. Marketed by the newly-formed Eagle brand by Chrysler Corporation, it replaced the AMC/Renault-designed Eagle Premier from which the car was derived. The Eagle Vision was badged as the Chrysler Vision in Europe. 

The Vision debuted at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. As one of the LH sedans, it was &quot;Automobile Magazine&#x27;s&quot; Automobile of the Year in 1993, and ultimately the only Eagle model to be wholly designed and built in-house by Chrysler.

==Design background==

The Vision&#x27;s design can be traced to 1986 when Chrysler designer Kevin Verduyn completed the initial exterior design of a new aerodynamic concept sedan called Navajo. The design never passed the clay model stage.

At this time, the Chrysler Corporation also purchased the bankrupt Italian sports car manufacturer Lamborghini. The Navajo&#x27;s exterior design was reworked and became the Lamborghini Portofino, released as a concept at the 1987 Frankfurt Auto Show. The Portofino was heralded as a design triumph, setting in motion Chrysler&#x27;s decision to produce a production sedan with the Portofino&#x27;s revolutionary exterior design, called &quot;cab forward”.

This design was characterized by the long, low-slung windshield and relatively short overhangs. The wheels were effectively pushed to the car&#x27;s corners, creating a larger passenger cabin than contemporary vehicles in its class.

The design of the chassis began in the late 1980s after Chrysler bought American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987, from which the Eagle division is derived. During this time, Chrysler began designing replacements for the Dodge Dynasty, Chrysler Fifth Avenue, and a potential Plymouth version. The initial design of Dodge&#x27;s LH bore a resemblance to the outgoing Dynasty, and this design was scrapped entirely after François Castaing, formerly AMC&#x27;s Vice President of product engineering and development, became Chrysler&#x27;s Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988. Under Castaing&#x27;s leadership, the new design began with the Eagle Premier.

The chassis design was continually refined throughout the following years, as it underpinned more Chrysler concepts: the 1989 Chrysler Millennium and 1990 Eagle Optima. The Premier&#x27;s longitudinal engine mounting layout was inherited, as were the front suspension geometry and braking system. The chassis itself became a flexible architecture capable of supporting front or rear-wheel drive (designated &quot;LH&quot; and &quot;LX&quot; respectively). The transmission was inspired by the Premier&#x27;s Audi and ZF automatics. Borrowing heavily from Chrysler&#x27;s A604 (41TE) &quot;Ultradrive&quot; transversely mounted automatic, it became the A606 (also known as 42LE).

By 1990, Chrysler managers decided that the new technologically advanced car would need to include an updated engine. Until then, the only engine confirmed for use was Chrysler&#x27;s 3.3 L pushrod V6. The 3.3 L engine&#x27;s 60° block was bored out to 3.5 L, while the pushrod-actuated valves were replaced with SOHC cylinder heads with four valves per cylinder, making it an advanced 3.5 L V6.

The appearance of the Vision continued the cab-forward exterior design of the 1987 Lamborghini Portofino concept with its aerodynamic shape, contributing to little wind noise inside this large car. The engineering and sleek styling gave the Vision a low drag coefficient (0.31), equal to the two-seat Porsche 997 sports car.

Without badges, the Vision could easily pass as a (first-generation) Concorde. The main difference between the two are the taillight clusters. Like the European sedans it was marketed to compete against, the Vision incorporates rear amber turn signals over the Concorde&#x27;s red ones. Neither does the Vision have the Concorde&#x27;s faux rear lightbar between the taillights. While the two cars share headlights, the Vision&#x27;s grille is smaller and, separated by its prominent center badge, has been likened to the appearance of &quot;nostrils.&quot; The interior of the Vision is nearly identical to the Concorde, the most significant difference being the absence of the Concorde&#x27;s faux wood trim and steering wheel emblem. Unlike the Vision, the Concorde never offered the Autostick option. Marketed as a sports sedan, the Vision featured bucket seats with a center console, never having an available split bench with a column-mounted shifter.

The Vision featured a monochromatic design inside and out, with no brand or model badge on the doors (as found on the Concorde) and available aluminum wheels with a simple design. The single-color motif was more pronounced on models without the grey lower body trim paint scheme. In keeping with its high-performance image, the Vision was the only LH sedan to come standard with &quot;touring&quot; suspension. &quot;Performance&quot; suspension was an available option on the Vision.

The upscale TSi model featured leather-trimmed seats, 8-way power seats for both the driver and front passenger, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, a leather shift knob, cloth door inserts, rear seat vents, center rear armrest, and personal reading lamps.

Power windows and central door locks were standard for both trims, as were dual airbags, with remote keyless entry available. Among the factory-installed sound systems was the top-of-the-line Infinity sound system, which included eight speakers throughout the cabin and an equalizer. Head units included a radio with either cassette or CD playback and a maximum five-band adjustable graphic equalizer.


The TSi model was distinguishable as it did not have a fixed mast antenna, but included a retractable powered system inside the rear right fender. Anti-lock brakes (ABS) were standard, with traction control optional.

Dual-way power sunroofs were available on this car in either trim. They were designed and installed by American Sunroof Corp. (now ASC Global) from its Columbus, Ohio plant, not by Mopar itself. An installed sunroof eliminated most of the front overhead console that featured storage bins for a garage door opener and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), an onboard computer with integrated map lights, was retained.

The Vision was generally the middle offering of the original three LH cars, with the ESi priced between a base Intrepid and a base Concorde (usually just under the Concorde by a few hundred dollars). However, the TSi&#x27;s base price was more than the basic Concorde version. The other LH cars, the New Yorker and LHS, were priced higher than the Vision.

===Trims===
*&quot;ESi&quot; - 1993–1997
*&quot;TSi&quot; - 1993–1997

==Drivetrains==
The Eagle Vision ESi came equipped with a 3.3 L V6 engine initially rated which was raised to in the 1994 and 1995 models. For 1996, it lost , but gained 9 ft·lbf of torque. The TSi featured the more powerful SOHC 24-valve 3.5 L V6 engine rated at . 

Both engines included a 4-speed automatic transmission. The 1996 and 1997 TSi with its 3.5 had the 4-speed AutoStick option featuring a unique PRNDL mechanism invented by Peter Gruich.

*3.3 L V6 – Horsepower and Torque: &amp; (1992–93), &amp; (1994–1995) and, &amp; (1996–1997)
*3.5 L V6 – &amp; 
The 3.3 L engine was engineered to run on 87 octane gasoline, while the larger 3.5 requires mid-grade 89 octane fuel as a minimum, but benefits from premium 91 octane fuel.

==Year-to-year changes==
===1994=== 
* Variable-assist power steering was available, providing more feel at higher speeds. Both models now wore the same lower-body cladding, minimizing the evident differences between the ESi and TSi. The 3.3 L engine&#x27;s power output was increased by 8 hp, while the 4-speed automatic transmission was revised for smoother shifting.
===1995=== 
* New standard features included heated power exterior rear-view mirrors, power windows, and an AM/FM stereo with a cassette player. The 3.5  engine became available as an upgrade option for the ESi trim level.
===1996=== 
* A new Autostick shifting feature became available for the TSi trim. The car could be &quot;manually&quot; shifted by tilting the shift knob right or left to change gears up or down. Plastic lower trim was deleted in favor of body color lower trim for a monochromatic color scheme. The Pentastar logo previously present on the front fenders in front of the doors was deleted. Windshield wiper jets were moved from the wiper arms to the hood. All 1996 Eagle Visions were made OBD-II compliant.
* The headlights are now more powerful.

===1997=== 
* Only minor changes were made to the 1997 Vision. After this model year, the Vision was discontinued.

==Discontinuation==
The Vision sold around 105,000 units, from 1993 to 1997, and Chrysler was planning to continue it to redesign the LH cars for 1998. Some prototypes featured the Eagle logo, and Vision production continued into September 1997 to offer dealers an adequate amount of 1997 models, until the introduction redesigned 1998 Vision. However, Chrysler made the decision to stop production of the Vision and Talon (Eagle&#x27;s only other model by then) with the last unit built on September 5, 1997. On September 29, 1997, the automaker notified 2,340 U.S. and 337 Canadian dealers that the Eagle brand would be discontinued by the end of the 1998 model year.

The car that was planned to be the redesigned Vision, became the 1999 model year Chrysler 300M. It was released a year after the other redesigned LH cars in 1998.

<doc id="863469" wikidata="Q838223" url="?curid=863469" title="Plymouth Voyager">
<text>Plymouth Voyager is a nameplate for a range of vans that were marketed by Plymouth from 1974 to 2000. One of the few light trucks marketed by the division, the Voyager was initially a full-size van, later becoming one of the first minivans successfully marketed in North America. 

For its first generation, the Voyager was a full-size van, serving as the Plymouth counterpart of the Dodge Sportsman (renamed Dodge Ram Wagon for 1980). For 1984, the Voyager was reintroduced as a minivan, becoming a divisional counterpart of the Dodge Caravan. For 1987, the model line was expanded with the extended-wheelbase Plymouth Grand Voyager and the luxury-trim Chrysler Town &amp; Country for 1990. Three generations of the model line were sold until the closure of the Plymouth brand during the 2000 model year. 

The Voyager nameplate has also seen use multiple times under the Chrysler brand. From 1988 to 2016, the Chrysler Voyager nameplate was used for export-market minivans. Following the demise of Plymouth, Chrysler reintroduced the Voyager as a Chrysler for North America, discontinuing the model after 2003. 

The Chrysler minivans (including versions sold under Chrysler, Ram, Lancia, and Volkwagen nameplates) are a model family that collectively rank as the 13th best-selling automotive model line worldwide. The Plymouth Voyager minivan was assembled by Chrysler at its Windsor Assembly facility in Windsor, Ontario, Canada; from 1987 to 2000, the Voyager was also assembled at Saint Louis Assembly in Fenton, Missouri (North plant from 1987 through 1995; South plant from 1996 until 2000). The full-size Plymouth Voyager van was assembled from 1974 until 1983 at the Pillette Road Truck Assembly in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and at the St. Louis North Assembly Plant in Fenton, Missouri. 

==Full-size van (AB; 1974–1983)==


For the 1974 model year, Plymouth debuted light trucks under its own brand (for the first time since 1942), introducing the Voyager full-size van and the Trail Duster SUV. The Voyager was a Plymouth counterpart of the Dodge Sportsman van, while the Trail Duster was derived from the Dodge Ramcharger. In contrast to Dodge, Plymouth only marketed the Voyager as a passenger van; as with the Sportsman, the model line was offered with seating options for up to 15 passengers (depending on body length); the 18-inch longer Extended Body Voyager was derived from the Dodge MaxiWagon. 

1974-1977 Plymouth Voyagers were visually similar to their Dodge counterparts, centering Plymouth badging within the grille (a design shared by Fargo vans and 1971-1973 Dodges). 

Dependent on body size, the Voyager was sold in PB100, PB200, and PB300 series. In 1976, the Voyager was joined by the Voyager Custom and Voyager Sport (to better match its Dodge counterpart). For 1977, the single-panel rear door (introduced in 1975 as an option) became standard (trading places with the two-panel rear door). The rear seat mountings were redesigned, allowing for easier removal.

For 1978 and 1979, the Voyager followed its Dodge counterpart through a two-year transition of the model line into its second generation. 1978 brought major structural changes, as a redesigned B-pillar on long-wheelbase models saw the deletion of the filler panels between the front doors and side doors (on the driver side, one fewer window); On extended-length vans, the body was fitted with wraparound rear corner windows to improve rear visibility. The interior underwent a redesign with all-new trim and seats, with the dashboard redesigned to increase parts commonality with newer Chrysler vehicles (Dodge would use this design through 1997). 1979 brought a taller, longer hoodline and a larger grille (though large-block V8 engines were retired by Chrysler), and redesigned headlamp clusters (in contrast to Dodge, the Voyager was fitted with four headlamps as standard). With the exception of its Plymouth badging, the Voyager was essentially indistinguishable from its Dodge Royal Sportsman counterpart. 

For 1981, the Plymouth Voyager gained a degree of brand differentiation as Dodge dropped the Sportsman/Tradesman branding in favor of Dodge Ram Wagon/Van, featuring large RAM badging on the door. In contrast, the Voyager retained the badging introduced in 1979. 

Following the 1983 model year, Plymouth discontinued the full-size Voyager van, transferring the nameplate to its 1984 minivan. As the Trail Duster had been discontinued after 1981, the full-size Voyager would become the final full-size truck offered by the Plymouth brand. 

==Background==
During the early 1970s, Ford and Chrysler had begun work on smaller passenger vans as &quot;garageable vans&quot;; the vehicles were intended to feature a lower height (though taller than a station wagon, the design would be easily accommodated within a standard-height garage). Also, the smaller vans were intended primarily to carry people, not cargo, so design and comfort were prioritized over payload. 

The Ford project led to the 1973 Ford Carousel, a running prototype deriving its body and chassis from the Ford Club Wagon then in development for 1975; the Carousel was restyled with its own body, lowered to a height of approximately 6 feet. Though supported by both Lee Iaccoca and Henry Ford II, internal opposition from other Ford executives led to the cancellation of the Carousel project during 1974. 

At the same time, Dodge Truck Engineering began design work of its own &quot;garageable van&quot; (to market a small van as a practical second car). Though the Volkswagen Microbus had established popularity, designers sought to develop a safer and more practical vehicle. To utilize then-existing Chrysler powertrains, a front-engine, rear-wheel drive layout was selected. In 1972, designers began developing clay models of a potential exterior design (along with interior layouts). However, the Chrysler small van project was shelved, as Chrysler management cited the lack of funds and that it was a design that had no competition from either Ford or GM. 

At the end of 1977, Chrysler started development on a new small van project that would ultimately become the Chrysler minivans. Following the firing of both Lee Iacocca and Hal Sperlich from Ford, the two joined Chrysler in similar capacities during 1978. Beginning life as a modified version of the Dodge Omni, the new vans adopted a front-wheel drive layout. The models grew in size as designers determined the Omni/Horizon chassis would be too small with an underpowered powertrain. Following the project approval, the &quot;T-115&quot; small van program was funded through a large portion of the Chrysler federal loan guarantees. 

The Chrysler minivans launched a few months ahead of the Renault Espace (the first MPV/minivan in Europe)— effectively creating the modern minivan segment in the United States, followed by the introduction of the Chevrolet Astro/GMC Safari and the Ford Aerostar.

==First generation (S; 1984–1990)==


For 1984, the Plymouth Voyager name returned, introduced as the Plymouth version of the Chrysler minivans, joining the all-new Dodge Caravan. Though the two vehicles shared a distinct model architecture, the minivans shared powertrains with the K-Cars, along with portions of the interior, including the dashboard controls and instrument cluster from the Plymouth Reliant. 

The model line was designed with a passenger-side sliding door (like a full-size van), but its front-wheel drive chassis allowed for a lower floor height (closer to a sedan/station wagon); the rear door used a one-piece liftgate, similar to a hatchback or smaller station wagons. 

The Voyager was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1985.

For 1987, the Voyager received minor cosmetic updates as well as the May 1987 introduction of the Grand Voyager, which was built on a longer wheelbase adding more cargo room. It was available only with &quot;SE&quot; or &quot;LE&quot; trim.

First-generation Voyager minivans were offered in three trim levels: an unnamed base model, mid-grade &quot;SE&quot;, and high-end &quot;LE&quot;, the latter bearing simulated woodgrain paneling. A sportier &quot;LX&quot; model was added in 1989, sharing much of its components with the Caravan ES.

Safety features included 3-point seat belts for the front two passengers and lap belts for rear passengers. Standard on all Voyagers were legally mandated side-impact reinforcements for all seating front and rear outboard positions. Safety features such as airbags or ABS were not available. The Voyager, along with the Dodge Caravan, are considered to be the first mass-produced vehicles to include dedicated cup holders.

Original commercials for the 1984 Voyager featured magician Doug Henning as a spokesperson to promote the Voyager &quot;Magic Wagon&#x27;s&quot; versatility, cargo space, low step-in height, passenger volume, and maneuverability. Later commercials in 1989 featured rock singer Tina Turner. Canadian commercials in 1990 featured pop singer Celine Dion.

===Seating===
1984-1986 Voyagers could be equipped for five, six, or seven passengers, with an eight-passenger variant available only in 1985. Five-passenger seating, standard on all trim levels, consisted of two front bucket seats and an intermediate three-passenger bench seat. In 1985, on base and SE models, the front buckets could be replaced by a 40/60 split three-passenger bench seat, bringing the total number of occupants to six. Seven-passenger seating was an option on SEs and LEs, with dual front buckets, an intermediate two-passenger bench, and a rear three-passenger bench. Eight-passenger seating was available on SE models only, with both the additional middle two-passenger bench and the three-passenger front bench. Depending on the configuration, the base model could seat up to six, the SE could seat up to eight, and the LE could seat up to seven.

The two bench seats in the rear were independently removable (though not foldable), and the large three-seat bench could also be installed in the second-row location via a second set of attachment points on the van&#x27;s floor, ordinarily hidden with snap-in plastic covers. This configuration allowed for conventional five-passenger seating with a sizable cargo area in the rear. The latching mechanisms for the benches were very intuitive and easy to operate.

On base models, the front buckets were low-back items, upholstered with plain cloth or vinyl. On SEs, the buyer could choose between low-back buckets in deluxe cloth or high-back buckets in upgraded vinyl. LEs came standard with high-back front buckets, upholstered in either luxury cloth or luxury vinyl.

In 1985 and 1986, there was also a five-passenger version with a back seat that could be folded flat with the pull of a handle into a bed that filled the rear compartment from the back of the front seats to the rear. This option was known as the Magic Camper. The Magic Camper back seat had an extra rear-facing cushion that formed the back-most section of the bed when folded flat and the seat, though very heavy, was removable. The Magic Camper option included a tent that attached magnetically to the side of the vehicle allowing access in and out of the sliding side door.

For 1987 the six- and eight-passenger options were withdrawn, leaving seating for five standard and seven optional on the base and SE, and seating for seven with high-back front buckets standard on the LE, Grand SE, and Grand LE. The deluxe cloth upholstery was now standard on base and all SE models, with the luxury vinyl optional on SEs. On LEs, luxury cloth came standard and for the first time, leather seats were available on the LE models.

===Engines===
For the first three years of production, two inline-4 engines with 2 barrel carburetors were offered. The base 2.2 L was from the Chrysler K-cars and produced horsepower. The higher performance fuel-injected version of the 2.2 L engine later offered in the Chrysler K-cars was offered in the Voyager for the 1987 model year and remained the base engine until mid-1987. Alongside the 2.2 L, an optional Mitsubishi 2.6 L engine was available producing .

At launch, the Voyager&#x27;s low horsepower to weight ratio had not been much of a concern. Its main competitors were the Toyota Van and the Volkswagen Vanagon, both of which offered similar performance. In mid-1987, the base 2.2 L I4 was replaced with a fuel-injected 2.5 L I4, which produced , while the Mitsubishi &quot;G54B&quot; I4 was replaced with the new fuel-injected 3.0 L Mitsubishi V6 producing in March of that year.

A turbocharged version of the base 2.5 L producing was available in 1989 and 1990. Also in 1989, revisions to the Mitsubishi V6 increased output to . In 1990, a new 3.3 L V6 was added to the option list. Sales of the 2.5 turbo dwindled as a result, and it was dropped at the end of the year.

* 1984–1987 2.2 L &quot;K&quot; I4, , 
* 1984–1987 2.6 L Mitsubishi &quot;G54B&quot; I4, , 
* 1987½–1990 2.5 L &quot;K&quot; I4, , 
* 1987½–1988 3.0 L Mitsubishi &quot;6G72&quot; V6, , 
* 1989–1990 2.5 L &quot;Turbo&quot; I4, , 
* 1989-1990 3.0 L Mitsubishi &quot;6G72&quot; V6, , 
* 1990 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6, , 

===Transmissions===
Both a three-speed TorqueFlite automatic transmission and a five-speed manual were available with all inline-four engines, including the turbocharged 2.5 L (this was a rare combination). V-6 engines were only offered with the venerable fully hydraulically operated TorqueFlite, until the computer-controlled Ultradrive 4-speed automatic became available in 1989. The Ultradrive offered much better fuel economy and responsiveness, particularly when paired with the inline-four engine.

==Second generation (AS; 1991–1995)==


The Plymouth Voyager was modified for 1991 with new sheet metal. The S platform was still used, though renamed the &quot;AS platform&quot;. These were the last Voyagers that were derived from the Chrysler K platform.

Trim levels were carried over from the previous generation. 1991 Voyagers were available in base, mid-grade &quot;SE&quot;, high-end &quot;LE&quot;, and high-end &quot;LX&quot;. The LX which was available only on short-wheelbase Voyagers, was marketed as a sport-luxury minivan and came with the most standard equipment including alloy wheels, fog lamps, and a wide array of power-operated features.

In later years various trim packages were offered on SE models. The &quot;Sport Wagon&quot; package available from 1993 until 1995 featured accent color (gray) bumpers and molding, fog lamps, and special aluminum wheels. The &quot;Rallye&quot; package offered in 1995, took the place of the departed &quot;LX&quot; model. It was more luxury-oriented, with lower body two-tone paint — regardless of upper body color, the lower body was painted &quot;Driftwood Beige&quot; — silver aluminum wheels, and special badging. The font first used for the Rallye&#x27;s badging was adopted for all of Plymouth&#x27;s badging from 1996 onward.

Interiors were more differentiated in this generation than on the first with a redesigned dashboard for 1994 featuring a passenger-side front airbag. and a seating package, marketed as the &quot;Quad Command&quot; seating package, available on SE, LE, and LX models. Quad command replaced the second-row bench with two individual bucket seats with a center aisle to the third-row bench. Interior options varied with trim levels and packages. Cloth seating was standard on all models; leather seating was a standalone extra-cost option on LE and LX models.

Only badging and minor cosmetics differentiated the Voyager from its Dodge Caravan rebadged variant. The Chrysler Town &amp; Country shared the Voyager&#x27;s headlamps and taillights. In Mexico, the Voyager was sold as a Chrysler and shared the chrome waterfall grille with the Town &amp; Country.


===Innovations===
This generation of vans brought additional innovations, including:
* &quot;Quad Command&quot; bucket seating (1990)
* Available All-wheel drive (1990)
* Available anti-lock brakes (1990)
* First driver&#x27;s side airbag in a minivan (1991), made standard (1991), and first dual front airbags (1993)
* Integrated child safety seats (1991), improved design with recliners (1993)
* First minivan to meet 1998 U.S. federal safety standards (1993)

The turbocharged engine and Convert-A-Bed feature were dropped.

===Engines===
* 1991–1995 2.5 L &quot;K&quot; I4, , 
* 1991–1995 3.0 L Mitsubishi &quot;6G72&quot; V6, , 
* 1991–1993 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6, , 
* 1994–1995 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6, , 
* 1994–1995 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot; V6, , 

===Year-to-year changes===
* 1991: Second-generation minivans released.
*1992: A driver&#x27;s side airbag was made standard for this year. Integrated child safety seats in the second-row bench were optional on 1992 Voyagers. The Grand Voyager was available with a lower-cost powertrain. A 3.0 L V6 and a 3-speed automatic could be substituted for the standard 3.3 L V6 with its 4-speed automatic. The 5-speed manual transmission could once again be paired with the base engine, which was now the 2.5 L I4 instead of the original 2.2 L I4.
* 1993: On 7-passenger models, the optional &quot;Quad Command&quot; bucket seats replaced the middle bench seat. The right bucket tilted forward to ease entry and exit to the rearmost bench. The front shoulder belts became height-adjustable and rear shoulder belts had lower anchor points and the horn button was black.
* 1994: New bumpers and body moldings, and a redesigned dashboard appeared on all 1994 Voyagers. New safety features which included a passenger-side airbag and side door-guard beams enabled the Voyager to meet all passenger car safety requirements through 1998. A cassette player became standard on all models but the base and a CD player was available on all models. Under the hood, a 3.8 L V6 was a new option for top-of-the-line Grand Voyager LE models. The 3.3 L V6 was upgraded to produce as well. For 1994 the &quot;10th Anniversary Edition&quot; was an option on Voyager &quot;SE&quot; models; it had unique two-tone paint and badges.
* 1995: No major changes were made for 1995, except for the new &quot;Rallye&quot; option package available on &quot;SE&quot; models. Rallye models came with special silver-accent wheels and special two-toned paint on the lower body.

==Third generation (NS; 1996–2000)==


The 1996 Plymouth Voyager was redesigned from the ground up. The previous K-car automobile platform and architecture were replaced with modern components and utilized Chrysler&#x27;s cab-forward design. The third generation redesign was built on the new Chrysler NS platform and included a driver&#x27;s-side sliding door, a minivan first. 

The Voyager was listed on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1996 and 1997.


In a shift from previous minivans, the third-generation Voyager was marketed as the entry-level Chrysler minivan rather than as a direct counterpart of the Dodge Caravan. While sharing the same bodyshell, the Voyager and Caravan saw significant changes in body trim and feature content. Distinguished by a dark gray egg-crate grille (a body-color grille became an option in 1998), the Voyager used matte gray bumpers across all trim levels with matte gray side moldings. Before the calendar year 1996, the NS Voyager was produced with the Pentastar grille emblem and rear badging carried over from the previous model year, shifting to the &quot;sailboat&quot; Plymouth grille emblem and new badging in script font afterward.

The Voyager retained the base, SE, and LE trims from its predecessor. To reduce model overlap, the LE trim was discontinued in the United States (in favor of an expanded Town &amp; Country range). To allow the Plymouth brand to remain competitive, the Rallye option package was introduced on the SE trim; along with exterior badging, the Rallye offered interior content featured in LE-trim Voyagers and Caravans. For 1998, the Rallye trim was renamed Expresso.

Third generation Voyagers and Grand Voyagers were equipped nearly identically to their Dodge counterparts, save for front fascias, badging, and the wheels on LE-trim vans, which are shared with the Town &amp; Country. However, to maintain its position as the entry-level minivan, the Voyager was never produced with automatic headlights, fog lights, power driver&#x27;s seat and power mirror memory, or auto-dimming rearview mirrors.

All-wheel drive was also discontinued in some markets. The vinyl woodgrain-appearance side paneling was no longer available, as the new side sheet metal was no longer flat.

Third generation Voyagers introduced a new system of rear seats to simplify installation, removal, and re-positioning— marketed as &quot;Easy-Out Roller Seats&quot;. All Voyagers and Grand Voyagers were equipped with this feature. When installed, the second- and third-row seats (either bucket or bench seats) are latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lifted each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks had locator depressions for rollers, thus enabling simple installation. Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks released the floor latches single-handedly without tools and raised the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks were permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions were aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were relocated inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames and allowing them to be lighter.

===Engines===
* 1996–2000 2.4 L &quot;EDZ&quot; I4, , (Canadian vans beginning in 1999 included a 3.0 L V6 as standard equipment)
* 1996–2000 3.0 L Mitsubishi &quot;6G72&quot; V6 , (not available in certain U.S. states, 3.3 L V6 offered as standard equipment in those states instead)
* 1996–2000 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6, , 
* 1996–1997 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot; V6, , 
* 1998–1999 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot; V6, , 

===Year-to-year changes===
===1996=== 
* As running changes during this model year, the Pentastar front logo and rear badging carried over from the previous generation were replaced with the new &quot;sailboat&quot; logo and script font, while the front interior door panels were redesigned, losing the discrete grab handles in favor of ones integrated into the armrests. Another running change saw the elimination of the plastic intake manifold cover from the 3.8 L engine.
* The base engine is now the 2.4 L DACT engine with 150 hp.
* Optional rear sliding doors.

===1997=== 
* A CD player was a new option. Other than that, only minimal changes.
===1998=== 
* Grocery bag hooks were added to the rearmost bench. The Rallye package was renamed Expresso and now included new wheel covers (if equipped with steel wheels), a standard CD player, and a body-colored grille). SE models with optional low-back seats and LE models received updated cloth upholstery. As a running change during this model year, the HVAC vents on the driver&#x27;s side and in the center of the dashboard were changed to a more conventional design.
===1999=== 
* The 3.8 L V6 was available for front-wheel drive SE models. A small cargo net between the front seats, additional standard equipment, integrated child-safety seats, and second-row buckets were added to the Voyager this year. Air conditioning was made standard on &quot;SE&quot; models. In Canada, the 3.0 L V6 was made standard equipment. 1999 also saw the addition of a one-year-only 15th anniversary &quot;Platinum Edition&quot;, to mark Caravan&#x27;s 15th year of production. This package was offered on various trim levels and included Platinum Metallic paint along with fender badges.
===2000===
* Now standard on all models was air conditioning, power windows, and power locks (the latter two standard on &quot;SE&quot; models only). A dealer-installed rear-seat video entertainment system was newly available on all models. The 2000 model year offered packages that included the &quot;2000+&quot; and &quot;Millennium&quot; packages. These only added unique fender badges on vans with popular equipment. As Chrysler withdrew the Plymouth brand, the Voyager was marketed by both Chrysler and Plymouth during this model year.

===Crash test results===
The 1996-2000 Dodge Grand Caravan (twin of the Voyager/Grand Voyager) received a &quot;Marginal&quot; rating in the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety&#x27;s 40 mph offset test. The structural performance and restraints were graded &quot;Acceptable&quot;, but the foot injuries were very high.

In the NHTSA crash tests, it received 4 stars for the driver and front passenger in the frontal impact. In the side-impact test, it received 5 stars for the driver, and 3 stars for the rear occupant, and resulted in a fuel leak that could cause a fire hazard.

==Discontinuation==

Following the retirement of the Plymouth brand after the 2000 model year, the Voyager nameplate was continued by the Chrysler division. While used by all exported Chrysler minivans since 1988, in North America, the Chrysler Voyager served as the lowest-trim Chrysler-brand minivan. Offered only in a short-wheelbase configuration, the Voyager continued with matte-black bumpers and exterior trim. Following the 2001 introduction of the RS-generation minivans, the Voyager was distinguished by a winged Chrysler emblem atop a black plastic grille (a shape adopted by the later PT Cruiser).

For 2004, Chrysler discontinued the Voyager in the United States and Canada, replacing the model line with the Dodge Caravan and a short-wheelbase Town &amp; Country (the Voyager remained in Mexico through 2007). In markets outside of North America, the nameplate remained in use through 2016 for all export versions (as both a Chrysler and a Lancia).

After skipping the 2008-2020 fifth generation, the Voyager nameplate returned to use in North America for 2020 production, slotted below the Chrysler Pacifica and effectively replacing the Dodge Grand Caravan.

==Trim levels==
*Base – 1984–2000
*LE – 1984–1995 (unavailable in the US for the third generation; replaced by standalone Rallye and Expresso models)
*SE – 1984–2000
*LX – 1989–1992
*Sport Wagon – 1993–1995 (package available on SE and LE)
*Rallye – 1995–1997 (1995 as a package on SE and LE; 1996–1997 as either a package on SE or a standalone model)
*Expresso – 1998–2000 (as a package on SE or standalone model)

<text>The Chrysler Concorde is a full-size car that was produced by Chrysler from 1992 to 2004. It assumed the C-body Chrysler New Yorker Salon&#x27;s position as the entry-level full-size sedan in the Chrysler brand lineup. One of Chrysler&#x27;s three original Chrysler LH platform models, it has a front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout.

The Concorde was related to the Chrysler/Dodge Intrepid, Eagle Vision, Chrysler 300M, Chrysler LHS, and the eleventh and final generation Chrysler New Yorker.

It was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1993 and 1994.

== Design background ==

The Concorde&#x27;s design can be traced to 1986 when designer Kevin Verduyn completed the initial exterior design of a new aerodynamic concept sedan called Navajo. The design never passed the clay model stage. Also at this time, the Chrysler Corporation purchased bankrupt Italian sports car manufacturer Lamborghini. The Navajo&#x27;s exterior design was reworked and became the Lamborghini Portofino, released as a concept at the 1987 Frankfurt Auto Show. The Portofino was heralded as a design triumph, setting in motion Chrysler&#x27;s decision to produce a production sedan with the Portofino&#x27;s revolutionary exterior design, called &quot;cab-forward&quot;. The cab forward design was characterized by the long, low slung windshield, and relatively short overhangs. The wheels were effectively pushed to the corners of the car, creating a much larger passenger cabin compared to equivalent contemporary cars.

Design of the future Concorde chassis began in the late 1980s after Chrysler had bought another automaker, American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1987. During this time, Chrysler began designing the replacement for the Dodge Dynasty and Chrysler New Yorker, as well as a potential Plymouth. The initial design of Dodge&#x27;s LH bore resemblance to the Dynasty, and this design was scrapped entirely after François Castaing, formerly AMC&#x27;s Vice President of product engineering and development, became Chrysler&#x27;s Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988.

The new design, under Castaing&#x27;s leadership, began with the Eagle Premier, also sold later as the Dodge Monaco. The Premier&#x27;s longitudinal engine mounting layout was inherited, as was the front suspension geometry, and parts of the braking system. The chassis itself became a flexible architecture capable of supporting front or rear-wheel drive (designated &quot;LH&quot; and &quot;LX&quot; respectively). The transmission was inspired by the Premier&#x27;s Audi and ZF automatics. Borrowing heavily from Chrysler&#x27;s A604 (41TE) &quot;Ultradrive&quot; transversely mounted automatic, it became the A606 (also known as 42LE). The chassis design was continually refined throughout the following years, as it underpinned more Chrysler prototypes: the 1989 Chrysler Millennium and the 1990 Eagle Optima.

By 1990, it was decided that the new technologically advanced car would need a new technologically advanced engine to power it. Until that time, the only engine confirmed for use was Chrysler&#x27;s 3.3 L pushrod V6 engine. Chrysler&#x27;s old engineering system would have required up to five years, but both the engine and manufacturing teams committed to &quot;Job 1&quot; to have a new 3.5 L engine as &quot;an absolute cornerstone for the car.&quot; Under Castaing&#x27;s leadership, Chrysler developed an advanced engine in three years for the start of Concorde production that featured SOHC cylinder heads with four valves per cylinder.

The appearance, still based on the cab forward exterior design of the 1987 Lamborghini Portofino concept, with its aerodynamic shape, made for little wind noise inside this large car. This sleek styling gives the Concorde a low drag coefficient which was ahead of its time. Although American Motors&#x27; Eagle Premier (and Dodge Monaco) was discontinued by Chrysler after the 1992 model year, the new Concorde&#x27;s packaging was derived from the Premier, and all the suspension and drivetrain development mules were Premiers. Other design features found their way into the Chrysler LH platform, most notably the longitudinal engine layout, a hallmark of Renault&#x27;s front-wheel-drive designs. This design allowed engineers to lower the hood line, made maintenance/servicing simpler, and tightened the car&#x27;s turning diameter.

== First generation (1993–1997) ==
The first generation of the Concorde debuted at the 1992 North American International Auto Show in Detroit as a 1993 model. It debuted as a single, well-equipped model with a base price of US$18,341.
Out of all the LH sedans, the first generation Concorde was most closely related to the Eagle Vision. The Concorde was given a more traditional image than the Vision. The two shared nearly all sheet metal in common with the main differences limited to their grilles, rear fascias, bodyside moldings, and wheel choices. The Concorde featured a modern take on Chrysler&#x27;s signature waterfall grille. It was split into six sections divided by body-colored strips with the Chrysler Pentastar logo on the center strip. The Concorde&#x27;s rear fascia was highlighted by a full-width and full-height lightbar between the taillights, giving the appearance that the taillights stretched across the entire trunk. 

In keeping with its upscale position, Concorde&#x27;s body side moldings incorporated bright chrome (later golden colored) work not found on its Dodge or Eagle siblings. On Concordes with gray lower body paint color, the gray came all the way up to the chrome beltline; on Visions, the gray lower body paint area was smaller and much more subtle. Wheel styles, which included available aluminum wheels with a Spiralcast design, were also unique to the Chrysler LH sedans (Concorde, LHS, New Yorker); Dodge and Eagle had their own different wheel styles.

The similar Eagle Vision featured a smaller split-grille with a large Eagle badge in the center. The Vision&#x27;s taillights, although the same shape as the Concorde&#x27;s were clustered differently and featured European-inspired amber turn signals. The Vision did not share the Concorde&#x27;s lightbar, instead of using the area as space for a trunk-mounted license plate (as opposed to the rear bumper-mounted license plate on the Concorde). On the other hand, the Intrepid incorporated different headlight and taillight assemblies and had no grille at all. 

The interior of the Concorde was also nearly identical to that of the Vision, the main difference being the Concorde&#x27;s faux wood trim and steering wheel emblem; the Intrepid&#x27;s interior was substantially different from the Concorde and Vision. Concordes and Intrepids could be equipped with a front bench seat and column shifter, bringing total capacity to six. The Vision could only be equipped with front bucket seats. Unlike its Dodge and Eagle siblings, Chrysler Concordes never had the option of autostick transmission and its special instrument cluster. It was only available with an automatic transmission.

The upscale Concorde models featured leather-trimmed seats, steering wheels, shift knobs, and door inserts. Other interior options included rear-seat vents (in the five-seater), rear center rear armrest, and eight-way power seats for both the driver and passenger, as well as personal reading lamps. Power windows and central door locks were standard on all Concordes, as were dual airbags. Other options included remote keyless system and a choice of several Infinity sound systems with CD, cassette with up to eight speakers, and an equalizer.

The upscale LXi model was distinguishable as it did not have a retractable antenna, but a fixed antenna inside the rear passenger-side fender. Anti-lock brakes (ABS) were standard, with traction control optional.

Dual-way power sunroofs were available on this car. They were designed and installed by American Sunroof (now American Specialty Cars) from its Columbus, Ohio plant, not by Mopar itself. An installed sunroof eliminated most of the front overhead console that featured storage bins for a garage door opener and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), or on-board computer with integrated map lights, was retained.

A notable achievement included the Center for Auto Safety ranking the 1993 Concorde as superior in crashworthiness after testing it at into a wall. Another achievement was being featured on Car and Driver&#x27;s top 10 list for both 1993 and 1994.

=== Model year changes ===

===1993=== 
* Base 3.3 L engine had and standard non-touring suspension. A six-disc trunk-mounted Mopar CD changer with wire remote and an alarm system were dealer-installed options. This was the first car, along with Intrepid and Vision, to have the 3.5 L 24-valve SOHC V6 engine. A Panasonic cell phone with an externally mounted antenna could be ordered. The split-bench seat with column shift lever was not yet available, but planned from the beginning.
===1994=== 
* For this year, the touring suspension became standard. Also, base engines gained . A front split-bench seat with twofold-down armrests with cup holders and column shift became available to make it a six-seater. Power steering added more assistance, to reduce turning effort for parking as well as deliver a greater feel at higher speeds. The 3.3 L engine was rated at for 1992 and 1993 and in the remaining years of the first generation. Both 3.3 L engines achieved city, combined, and highway. Chrysler&#x27;s Visorphone was offered as well as a more conventional dealer-installed Chrysler car phone and the same Panasonic cell phone from the 1992 launch, all shown in the 1994 model year brochure.
===1995===
* Improvements made to the transaxle, a modification to the optional remote keyless entry system, and the addition of &#x27;thumb-touch&#x27; acceleration and cancel features, placed on the steering wheel spokes, to the cruise control. Later 1995 models were produced with sheet metal front fenders, which replaced the composite fenders on earlier models to improve structural integrity. The corporate &quot;Pentastar&quot; logo was replaced by the Chrysler wreath on the grille, horn pad, and various other places (except the keyless entry key fob and keys, which still had the old &quot;Pentastar&quot; logo). Chrysler waited until 1995 for this change on its other models with the exception of the Cirrus and Sebring, with the Plymouth brand getting a related new logo on all 1996 and later models. Dodge had already begun phasing out the Pentastar in 1992.
===1996===
* The Concorde gained two distinguished trim levels for 1996: lower-level LX and higher-level LXi. Extra sound insulation and revised structural engineering promised to make the Concorde quieter. Sheet metal front fenders added for 1996 and later on all models as part of the structural upgrade.
* The base model now has 16&#x27; wheels standard, better insulation, OBD-II, a new finish to the front seats and more powerful headlights.
* Optional &quot;gold&quot; finish on the aluminum rims.

===1997=== 
* The only major change for this year was that on the base LX model, the 3.3 L V6 was dropped as the standard engine.

All of the first-generation 3.5 L engines were rated at with city and with 89 octane fuel required.

Production Figures:
== Second generation (1998–2004) ==


The Concorde was completely redesigned for the 1998 model year. The &quot;Second Generation&quot; design was introduced in 1996 as the Chrysler LHX concept car. This concept vehicle had large, 20-inch wheels, a centrally located instrument cluster, and a closed-circuit television system within the windshield pillars replacing conventional rearview mirrors. While the concept vehicle&#x27;s wheelbase was expanded to to allow for rear passenger supplement restraints, rear occupant entertainment center and storage compartment, production second generation LH cars retained the original&#x27;s wheelbase.

Despite overall length increasing by , the second generation&#x27;s weight dropped by nearly a hundred pounds. This was achieved by extensive use of aluminum for the rear suspension, hood, as well as in the two new engines. There was a new 2.7-liter V6 and 3.2 L V6. The 3.5 L was redone and output upgraded to and was available on the 2002 through 2004 Concorde Limited (formerly LHS).

Much was done in the design process to make the second generation LH sedans look more distinct from each other. The 1998 Concorde differed far greater from the Dodge Intrepid and the new 1999 Chrysler 300M (successor to the Eagle Vision), than did the first generation models. With the exception of the doors and roof, the Concorde shared little sheet metal with the Intrepid and 300M. The new Concorde&#x27;s front end was underscored by a striking full-width grille, relocated to the front bumper to give the impression of a bottom breather. Sweeping curves and a more rounded front end also set the Concorde apart from the Intrepid and 300M.

As in the previous generation, six-passenger seating with a front bench seat, folding center armrest, and a column-mounted transmission shifter was available on the base model through the 2004 model year. Cloth seating was standard on base &quot;LX&quot; with leather seating optional. Leather was standard on upscale &quot;LXi&quot; and later &quot;Limited&quot; models.

The Concorde, 300M, and Intrepid were discontinued in 2004. The all-new, rear-wheel-drive Chrysler 300 replaced the Concorde (and 300M) in early 2004 as a 2005 model.

=== Model year changes ===

* 1998: The Concorde was completely redesigned for the 1998 model year. Bodyshells were designed to be stronger and stiffer, as well as incorporating double-shear suspension mounts and integrated side impact protection.
* 1999: The Concorde&#x27;s suspension system was softened to enhance ride comfort and reduce road noise. Thicker carpeting was installed inside, and a new standard cargo net went into the trunk. LXi models added a new CD player and Chrysler&#x27;s Sentry Key theft-deterrent system, which disabled the ignition unless the proper key was used to start the engine.
* 2000: A new factory-installed power sunroof was available on both base LX and upscale LXi models. The Concorde also earned additional suspension changes designed to provide a quieter, smoother ride. Tires grew to 16 inches for the LX, to match those of the LXi. The LXi edition gained standard speed-sensitive, variable-assist steering, as well as an optional 4-disc in-dash CD changer.
* 2001: Optional front side airbags and a 3-point safety belt for the rear seat&#x27;s middle position were added. The LX&#x27;s 22D option package now included alloy wheels. Also, the LXi&#x27;s optional Infinity sound system gained steering wheel-mounted controls.
* 2002: Adopting the body of the discontinued &quot;LHS&quot;, a new trim level was added, the range-topping Limited, which featured 17-inch wheels and a &quot;high output&quot; 3.5 L V6 engine producing . With the former &quot;LHS&#x27;s&quot; shorter nose, the 2002–2004 Concorde was shorter than 1998–2001 models. At midyear, Limited models became available with an optional Pro-Am Edition Group that included two-tone leather upholstery, unique interior trim, full-size spare tire on a matching chrome road wheel, a set of TaylorMade golf clubs (irons only), a special leather and suede Chrysler golf bag, exterior &#x27;Pro-Am&#x27; appliques on the exterior rear windows, as well as a &#x27;Pro-Am&#x27; trunk organizer for holding the clubs and accessories.
* 2003: No major changes were made except the optional 4-disc in-dash CD changer was replaced with the optional 6-disc in-dash CD changer.
* 2004: The Concorde&#x27;s last year. For the 2005 model year, the Concorde was replaced by the Chrysler 300. The last Concorde was produced on August 30, 2003.

<doc id="863472" wikidata="Q1648917" url="?curid=863472" title="Chrysler Voyager">
<text>The Chrysler Voyager (and the long-wheelbase Chrysler Grand Voyager) is a minivan produced by the Chrysler division of Stellantis. In the current lineup, it is positioned as the lower-end Chrysler minivan, having replaced the Dodge Grand Caravan in 2020, below the Chrysler Pacifica.

The Chrysler Voyager was introduced in Europe in 1988, and was a rebadged version of the Dodge Caravan in the United States. It originally evolved with the Caravan, the Plymouth Voyager, and the Chrysler Town &amp; Country. In the United States, the Chrysler Voyager nameplate replaced the short-wheelbase (SWB) version of the Plymouth Voyager following the folding of the Plymouth division by DaimlerChrysler AG in 2001, and was discontinued in 2003. The nameplate was revived for the 2021 model year following the discontinuation of the Dodge Grand Caravan after the 2020 model year, and is rebadged as the Chrysler Grand Caravan in Canada.

In Europe, the Chrysler Voyager was rebadged as the Lancia Voyager from the 2011 until 2016 model years. The Voyager was sold with different engines, including diesel engines, and was also available with manual transmission and a foot-operated emergency brake. Although now produced solely in Ontario, Canada, the Grand Voyagers were still available with diesel engines as standard. These diesel engines are based on a modern double overhead cam common rail design from VM Motori of Italy. The last European Chrysler Grand Voyagers are very similar to the 2008 and later Chrysler Town &amp; Country vans, and were sold only in the long-wheelbase version (as in North America). Following the fifth generation, the Grand Voyager nameplate was discontinued in all markets.

Together with its nameplate variants, the Chrysler minivans have ranked as the 13th bestselling automotive nameplate worldwide, with over 12 million sold.

==First generation (1988–1990)==


The Caravan was first introduced as a North American minivan for the United States and Canadian markets, sold along with the identical Plymouth Voyager, in November 1983, for the 1984 model year. Interior trim, controls, and instrumentation were borrowed from the Chrysler K platform, and coupled with the lower floor enabled by the front-wheel-drive, the Caravan featured car-like ease of entry. 
The line was first introduced into the European market in 1988 as Dodge Caravans rebranded as Chryslers. Europe&#x27;s Chrysler Voyager was nearly identical to the American Dodge Caravan except that the turbocharged I4 engine and the 3.3 L Chrysler &quot;EGA&quot; V6 were not available.

===Engines ===
*2.2 L &quot;K&quot; I4
*2.5 L &quot;K&quot; I4
*3.0 L Mitsubishi &quot;6G72&quot; V6
==Second generation (1991–1995)==


Introduced for the 1991 model year, the Chrysler Voyager in Europe continued to be identical to the Dodge Caravan in the United States except that the 3.8 L V6 was not available for the Chrysler Voyager. This would be the final generation available with a manual transmission in the United States. A 2.5 L turbo-diesel four-cylinder engine produced by VM Motori was made available beginning in 1994. There were also military modifications available for the Voyager in South Africa, which included large fuel tanks available in 240 and 360-liter capacities.

===Engines===
* 2.5 L &quot;K&quot; I4
* 2.5 L &quot;VM425&quot; Turbo Diesel (1994–1995)
* 3.0 L Mitsubishi &quot;6G72&quot; V6
* 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6
* 3.8L
==Third generation (1996–2000)==


The 1996–1999 models in Mexico are rebadged Dodge Caravans, although the Caravan was sold alongside the Voyager. For 2000, the Chrysler Voyager was identical to the Plymouth Voyager except that the 3.8 L V6 was not available. Base models of the Voyager were offered in most states with either a 2.4 L four-cylinder or a 3.0 L Mitsubishi V6 engine, except in California and several northeastern states, where the Mitsubishi V6 didn&#x27;t meet emissions standards. In those locales, the 3.3 L engine was offered instead.

For the European market, Voyagers continued to be rebadged Caravans. Unique to this market were 2.0 L Straight-4 SOHC and DOHC engines and 2.5 L turbo diesel produced by VM Motori. European market vans also came with manual transmissions and in a six-passenger model with six captains chairs, not available elsewhere.

===Engines===
* 2.0 L &quot;A588&quot; I4 SOHC
* 2.0 L &quot;ECC&quot; I4 DOHC
* 2.4 L &quot;EDZ&quot; I4
* 2.5 L &quot;VM425&quot; I4 Turbo Diesel
* 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6
* 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot; V6 (AWD; not available in UK)
* 3.0 L Mitsubishi &quot;6G72&quot; V6

===Safety===
According to Euro NCAP crash test results, the 1999 model Chrysler Voyager did so badly in the frontal impact that it earned no points, making it the worst of the group. The body structure became unstable and the steering column was driven back into the driver&#x27;s chest and head&#x27;. The 2007 model Chrysler Voyager fared little better, achieving just 19% in the frontal impact test, with an overall score of 2 stars out of a possible 5. However, chest compression measurements on the test dummy &#x27;indicated an unacceptably high risk of serious or fatal injury. As a result, the final star in the adult occupant rating is struck-through&#x27;.


==Fourth generation (2001–2007)==


From 2001 until 2003, the Voyager was offered in the SWB model only, replacing the SWB Plymouth Voyager. It resembled the Town and Country more than the previous generation, the only major cosmetic difference besides the trim (where the Town and Country&#x27;s is fancier) was the placement of the Chrysler emblem on the grille. After the 2003 model year, the Voyager was discontinued (United States market) and replaced by the Chrysler Town and Country, SWB model. The SWB Town &amp; Country continued under the Voyager name in the Mexican market.

===Engines===
* 2001–2008 3.3 L &quot;EGA&quot; V6
* 2001–2008 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot; V6
* 2001–2008 2.4 L &quot;EDZ&quot; I4
* 2008–2011 (China) 3.0 L &quot;6G72&quot; V6

===Year to year changes===
*2000: The Voyager is sold as a Plymouth and as a Chrysler, with the same options and features, however the Chrysler versions have sticker prices of about US$500 more.
*2001: The Chrysler Voyager was completely redesigned for this year as were the other Chrysler minivans. It was now only sold under the Chrysler marque; no &quot;Grand&quot; LWB versions are sold. Some new features include side airbags and an optional navigation system.
*2002: Either a VCR or a DVD-based rear-seat entertainment system was a new option available for dealer installation on all 2002 Voyagers. A high-value entry-level model, the &quot;eC&quot; was offered this year along with the base and &quot;LX&quot; models. All 2002 Voyagers now used a four-speed automatic transmission.
*2003: Power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals were available on 2003 Voyagers. Anti-lock brakes remained optional for the upscale &quot;LX&quot;, but were no longer available for base Voyagers. The Voyager was discontinued after this year and was replaced by the little-changed SWB Town and Country.


In Europe Chrysler began offering the Voyager with the first generation, followed by the second generation model in 2001, with a new engine range – including larger, more economical diesel engines (2.5 L and for 2005 – the 2.8 L 4 cylinder from VM Motori) and more fuel-efficient gasoline engines (I4 and V6).

The fourth generation Grand Voyager continued production for the Chinese market alongside the Dodge Grand Caravan until late 2010. Both models were built by Soueast in China, using a Town &amp; Country production line relocated from Taiwan, and were powered by Mitsubishi 6G72 engines.
==Fifth generation (2008–2016)==

Chrysler introduced the new Grand Voyager for 2008 and successfully positioned it in the automotive market as a luxury MPV suited for large families. Some versions of Grand Voyager are visually identical to the Chrysler Town &amp; Country which is sold in the North American and South American markets. In a similar fashion to the other large multi-purpose vehicles (MPVs) on the market, the Grand Voyager was sold with a standard diesel engine in Europe. This was also the first generation of the model that was not sold as the Chrysler Grand Caravan; markets in which it was previously sold under that nameplate received as either the Grand Voyager or Town &amp; Country.

However, the seating is arranged in the 2–2–3 (front to rear) layout common in North America, rather than the 2–3–2 layout often seen in SUVs and MPVs in Europe. On right-hand drive (RHD) models the gear shift lever is placed on a floor-mounted console between the seats, in contrast to the instrument panel positioning found on LHD models.

===Standard engine===

*2008–2015: 2.8 L CRD I4, at 3800 rpm and at 1600 rpm. (RA 428 DOHC)

The 2009 Grand Voyager with diesel motor gets a combined fuel economy of .

Optional engine on top of the range Limited models:

* 2008–2010: 3.8 L &quot;EGH&quot; V6, 197 hp (147 kW) at 5200 rpm and 230 lb·ft (312 N·m) at 4000 rpm
* 2010–2015: 3.6 L &quot;Pentastar&quot; V6, 283 hp (211 kW) at 6600 rpm and 260 lb·ft (353 N·m) at 4800 rpm
All engines are paired with Chrysler&#x27;s 62TE 6-speed automatic transmission with variable line pressure (VLP) technology (See Ultradrive).

===Lancia Voyager===
All Voyagers sold since October 2011 in continental Europe are sold under the Lancia brand.

The Chrysler-branded variant continues to be sold in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, South Africa, South Korea, Singapore, and China, as Lancia does not have sales operations in those markets. Voyager became the successor to previous unrelated series of minivans produced by Lancia, the last of which is the Phedra.

However, the parent company Fiat Chrysler Automobiles under the leadership of CEO Sergio Marchionne has decided to shut down both Chrysler and Lancia brands out of its European market (with the exception of keeping one model of Lancia available for sale in Italy). Due to this decision, the Lancia Voyager too is no longer being sold in Europe.

===European engines===
The Lancia version is offered with engines compliant with Euro V emission standards.

==Sixth generation (2020–present)==

For the 2020 model year, the Chrysler Pacifica&#x27;s low-end &quot;L&quot; and &quot;LX&quot; models were separated from the Pacifica lineup and given the Voyager name. This marks the return of the Voyager nameplate to the Chrysler model lineup, in which it was last used in 2016, and the North American market, in which it was last used in 2003 and 2008 in the United States and Mexico, respectively. In addition to the &quot;L&quot; and &quot;LX&quot; trim levels, an &quot;LXi&quot; model will be available to fleet customers.

The 2020 Voyager went on sale in the U.S. in the fall of 2019 with base prices ranging from $26,985 for the entry &quot;L&quot; model to $32,995 for the fleet-only &quot;LXi&quot; model. Seven-passenger seating, a six-speaker sound system with Active Noise Cancellation, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are standard on all models. Among the available options is the SafetyTec Group which includes rear park assist, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-path detection. The LX adds SiriusXM Satellite Radio and seventeen-inch aluminum-alloy wheels. The fleet-only LXi adds easy-clean leatherette-trimmed seating surfaces and dual heated front bucket seats. LX and LXi models offer a single-screen rear DVD entertainment system as on option. All Voyagers will be powered by the same 3.6 L Pentastar V6 gasoline engine with Variable Valve Timing (VVT) that powers the Chrysler Pacifica, producing and of torque, mated to the ZF-manufactured 948TE nine-speed automatic transmission controlled by a rotary control knob mounted in the Voyager&#x27;s center console. Unlike the Chrysler Pacifica, which is available with either front-wheel drive (FWD) or all-wheel drive (AWD), the Voyager is only offered with front-wheel drive.

Production of the Dodge Grand Caravan ended in 2020, thereby making Voyager the new entry minivan in FCA&#x27;s U.S. lineup. In Canada, the Voyager nameplate was not in use for 2020 and all models still carried the Pacifica name. In the 2021 model year, FCA began selling Voyager as the Chrysler Grand Caravan in Canada. 

The 2022 Voyager is targeted exclusively for fleet buyers. Only offered in the LX model, the 2022 Voyager includes standard features that include heated front seats and steering wheel, second-row Stow &#x27;n Go seats, clear air filtration system, Uconnect 5 system as well as power sliding doors and rear lift gate. There are just two option packages that provide more driver-assist and connectivity features.

The fleet-only 2022 Voyager model is predicted by Kelley Blue Book to have &quot;attractive deals on the used market&quot; as the rental companies begin selling them in a few years.

Public sales of the Voyager were discontinued in 2021, making it a fleet exclusive model. For the 2023 model year, the LX remained the only model on offer. The Voyager returned to the retail market for the 2025 model year, offered exclusively in an unnamed base trim. 

==Seating features==
The Chrysler Voyager has incorporated various seating systems for their minivans to enhance interior flexibility.

===Integrated child safety seats===
In 1992, Chrysler introduced a second-row bench seat integrating two child booster seats. These seats continued as an available option through fifth generation until they were discontinued in 2010.

===Easy Out Roller Seats===
In 1996, Chrysler introduced a system of seats to simplify installation, removal, and re-positioning— marketed as &quot;Easy-Out Roller Seats&quot;. The system remained in use throughout the life of the &quot;Chrysler Voyager&quot;.

When installed, the seats are latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lift each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks have locator depressions for rollers, thus enabling simple installation. Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks release the floor latches single-handedly without tools and raise the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward. Seat roller tracks are permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions are aligned, facilitating the longitudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter.

When configured as two- and three-person benches, the Easy Out Roller Seats could be unwieldy. Beginning in 2001, second and third-row seats became available in a &#x27;quad&#x27; configuration – bucket or captain chairs in the second row and a third-row three-person 50/50 split &quot;bench&quot; — with each section weighing under .

===Stow&#x27;n Go seating===
In 2005, Chrysler introduced a system of second and third-row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments – marketed as &quot;Stow &#x27;n Go&quot; seating and exclusively available on long-wheelbase models.

In a development program costing $400 million, engineers used an erector set to initially help visualize the complex interaction of the design and redesigned underfloor components to accommodate the system — including the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking brake cables, rear climate control lines, and the rear suspension. Even so, the new seating system precluded incorporation of an AWD system, effectively ending that option for the Chrysler minivans.

The system in turn creates a combined volume of of under-floor storage when second-row seats are deployed. With both rows folded, the vans have a flat load floor and a maximum cargo volume of .

The Stow &#x27;n Go system received &quot;Popular Science&quot; Magazine&#x27;s &quot;Best of What&#x27;s New&quot; for 2005 award.

The Stow &#x27;n Go system is not offered on the Volkswagen Routan, a rebadged nameplate variant of the Chrysler minivans.

===Swivel &#x27;n Go seating===
Chrysler introduced a seating system in 2008, marketed as &quot;Swivel&#x27;n Go&quot;. In the seating system, two full-size second-row seats swivel to face the third row. A detachable table can be placed between the second and third-row seats. The Swivel&#x27;n Go seating system includes the third-row seating from the Stow&#x27;n Go system.

The system is noted for its high strength. The entire load of the seat in the event of a crash is transferred through the swivel mechanism, which is almost twice as strong as the minimum government requirement.

The swivel mechanism includes bumpers that stabilize the seat while in the lock position. When rotated the seat comes off these bumpers to allow easy rotation.

The seat is not meant to be left in an unlocked position or swiveled with the occupant in it, although this will not damage the swivel mechanism.

==Production worldwide==

In the early years of its marketing (1988–1991), the Voyager was manufactured in North America and exported to Europe.
The Voyager began to be manufactured in Europe in 1991, at the Eurostar plant near Graz, Austria. Eurostar was a joint venture between Chrysler and the Austrian company Steyr-Daimler-Puch. It was later acquired by DaimlerChrysler and finally the plant was sold to Magna Steyr in 2002. The minivan production ended there at the end of 2007. Units produced in Austria were marketed in Europe, Asia, and Africa. They were built with gasoline and diesel engines, with manual transmission, in short-wheelbase (SWB) and long-wheelbase versions, and in right and left-hand drive versions (all sold as Chrysler Voyager).

From 2008 until 2010, the fourth generation Grand Voyager was produced in China by Soueast using a relocated Taiwanese Town &amp; Country assembly line.

The fifth generation Voyagers (2008–2011) have been exported to Europe from Windsor, Canada, where they are produced. Beginning in October 2011, they were exported and sold as the Lancia Voyager in most European markets, as Chrysler operations were merged with those of Lancia in many European countries. In the United Kingdom, only the Grand Voyager is marketed.

Since 2011, the Voyager is sold under the Lancia badge in Europe to strengthen the Chrysler-Lancia integration, though it remains branded as the Chrysler Voyager in the United Kingdom and Ireland. In March 2015, Fiat Group announced that in 2017, Chrysler would be discontinued in the United Kingdom. It was removed from Chrysler UK&#x27;s website in January 2016.

<doc id="863474" wikidata="Q728629" url="?curid=863474" title="Haibun">
<text>is a prosimetric literary form originating in Japan, combining prose and haiku. The range of &quot;haibun&quot; is broad and frequently includes autobiography, diary, essay, prose poem, short story and travel journal.

==History==
The term &quot;haibun&quot; was first used by the 17th-century Japanese poet Matsuo Bashō, in a letter to his disciple Kyorai in 1690. Bashō was a prominent early writer of &quot;haibun&quot;, then a new genre combining classical prototypes, Chinese prose genres and vernacular subject matter and language. He wrote some &quot;haibun&quot; as travel accounts during his various journeys, the most famous of which is &quot;Oku no Hosomichi&quot; (&quot;Narrow Road to the Interior&quot;).

Bashō&#x27;s shorter &quot;haibun&quot; include compositions devoted to travel and others focusing on character sketches, landscape scenes, anecdotal vignettes and occasional writings written to honor a specific patron or event. His &quot;Hut of the Phantom Dwelling&quot; can be classified as an essay while, in &quot;Saga Nikki&quot; (&quot;Saga Diary&quot;), he documents his day-to-day activities with his disciples on a summer retreat.

Traditional &quot;haibun&quot; typically took the form of a short description of a place, person or object, or a diary of a journey or other series of events in the poet&#x27;s life. &quot;Haibun&quot; continued to be written by later &quot;haikai&quot; poets such as Yosa Buson, Kobayashi Issa and Masaoka Shiki.

==In English==
&quot;Haibun&quot; is no longer confined to Japan, and has established itself as a genre in world literature that has gained momentum in recent years.

In the Haiku Society of America 25th anniversary book of its history, &quot;A Haiku Path&quot;, Elizabeth Lamb noted that the first English-language &quot;haibun&quot;, titled &quot;Paris,&quot; was published in 1964 by Canadian writer Jack Cain. However, an earlier example is Carolyn Kizer&#x27;s &quot;A Month in Summer,&quot; an extended haibun with 21 haiku and one tanka, published in 1962. Her piece (identified as a haibun) first appeared in &quot;Kenyon Review.&quot;

James Merrill&#x27;s &quot;Prose of Departure&quot;, from &quot;The Inner Room&quot; (1988), is a later example. John Ashbery also included several experiments with haibun in his 1984 collection &quot;A Wave&quot;.

The first contest for English-language &quot;haibun&quot; took place in 1996, organized by poet and editor Michael Dylan Welch, and judged by Tom Lynch and Cor van den Heuvel. Anita Virgil won first prize, and honorable mentions (in alphabetical order) went to Sydney Bougy, David Cobb, and John Stevenson. The contest resulted in the publication of &quot;Wedge of Light&quot; (Press Here) in 1999. As credited by Welch, the first anthology of English-language &quot;haibun&quot; was Bruce Ross&#x27;s &quot;Journey to the Interior: American Versions of Haibun&quot; (Tuttle), published in 1998.

Jim Kacian and Bruce Ross edited the inaugural number of the annual anthology &quot;American Haibun &amp; Haiga&quot; (Red Moon Press) in 1999; that series, which continues to this day, changed its name to &quot;Contemporary Haibun&quot; in 2003 and sponsored the parallel creation in 2005 of &quot;Contemporary Haibun Online&quot;, a quarterly journal that added Welsh &quot;haibun&quot; author Ken Jones to the founding editorial team of Kacian and Ross.

==Characteristics==
A &quot;haibun&quot; may record a scene, or a special moment, in a highly descriptive and objective manner or may occupy a wholly fictional or dream-like space. The accompanying haiku may have a direct or subtle relationship with the prose and encompass or hint at the gist of what is recorded in the prose sections.

Several distinct schools of English &quot;haibun&quot; have been described, including &quot;Reportage narrative mode&quot; such as Robert Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Vietnam Ruminations&quot;, &quot;Haibunic prose&quot;, and the &quot;Templum effect&quot;.

Contemporary practice of &quot;haibun&quot; composition in English is continually evolving. Generally, a &quot;haibun&quot; consists of one or more paragraphs of prose written in a concise, imagistic &quot;haikai&quot; style, and one or more haiku. However, there may be considerable variation of form, as described by editor and practitioner Jeffrey Woodward.

Modern English-language &quot;haibun&quot; writers (aka, practitioners) include Jim Kacian, Bruce Ross, Mark Nowak, John Richard Parsons, Sheila Murphy, Nobuyuki Yuasa, Lynne Reese, Peter Butler, Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, and David Cobb, founder of the British Haiku Society in 1990 and author of &quot;Spring Journey to the Saxon Shore,&quot; a 5,000-word haibun which has been considered seminal for the English form of kikōbun (i.e., travel diary).

<doc id="863475" wikidata="Q1276830" url="?curid=863475" title="Eagle Premier">
<text>The Eagle Premier is a full-size executive car that was developed by American Motors Corporation (AMC) during the 1980s through its partnership with Renault. This model was manufactured in the then-brand-new Brampton Assembly in Canada. 

Chrysler Corporation bought the rights to the Premier when it acquired Renault&#x27;s outstanding shares in AMC in 1987, and began selling the car under the new Eagle marque.

The four-door sedan was manufactured from September 1987 (for the 1988 model year) until December 1991 (for the 1992 model year). A rebadged variant was also marketed as the [[Dodge Monaco]] from 1990 until 1992. The Premier was exported to Japan where it was marketed as a Chrysler. 

==Design==
In 1982 American Motors and Renault, a major shareholder in AMC since 1979, began work on a new downsized full-size front-drive passenger car, code-named X-58, for introduction in late 1986. A companion two-door coupe, code named &quot;X-59&quot;, was to debut for the 1988 model year. These two body styles were to be the first full-size cars sold by AMC since the 1978 AMC Matador to re-position the automaker with a broader product offering in the marketplace. The strategy was to expand AMC&#x27;s reliance on sub-compact cars (which were the Alliance and Encore) as demand was increasing for larger, &quot;family-size&quot; cars such as the Chevrolet Celebrity and the new Ford Taurus.

Rather than engineer a completely new chassis for the Premier, the then-new Renault 25&#x27;s monocoque underpinnings were used as a basis and adapted for the new product. Using the Renault 25 chassis the suspension was derived from the Renault Medallion (Renault 21). The suspension featured a four-wheel independent system with MacPherson struts at the front wheels and two torsion bars at each rear wheel, with stabilizer bars in both front and rear.
The exterior by Giorgetto Giugiaro&#x27;s Italdesign was picked over other concepts generated by AMC&#x27;s styling department and other independent firms. The Premier&#x27;s body&#x27;s drag coefficient of 0.31 is slightly lower (more efficient) than the 1986 Ford Taurus that was well known for its aerodynamic shape. The Premier&#x27;s body was finished using a baked enamel clearcoat for all the available colors. The body was covered by a seven-year, warranty. The car&#x27;s trunk capacity was also large, offering of cargo space.

The Eagle also featured new technology to improve the luminous efficiency of its headlamp system, afford greater styling freedom, and have a rectangular frontal aspect. The 1988 Eagle Premier was one of the first cars featuring Valeo headlamps with nonparabolic, complex-surface reflector headlamps with optic lenses.

Stretched in all dimensions, the Premier provided more interior room than any of its contemporaries. The interior was an all-new design by AMC&#x27;s in-house staff under the direction of Dick Teague. It also included features that were considered unique at the time. The instrument panel featured &quot;a heavy dose of electronics&quot;, with all driver controls housed within a fingertip distance from the steering wheel. This included a dash-mounted gear selector that has been described reminiscent of the 1955 Chrysler PowerFlite transmission shifter. The Premier features a metal lever at the end which was a grip handle: if the gear selector shifted downward in the traditional fashion, the lever dropped into the dash pod in which it was mounted.

The climate controls used an unusual up-down button that cycled through the different heating modes, indicated by an array of lights. All of these controls were housed in a control panel on the right side of the steering column. On the left side of the column, another control contained the light and windshield wiper controls. The turn signal control was also electronic returning to its centered position immediately after a driver signaled a turn, and a gong indicated its cancellation after completing a turn. The optional cruise control was built into the leather-wrapped steering wheel. Other features included intermittent wipers, as well as automatic variable-speed that adjusted wiper speed to the amount of water that hit the windshield; with less moisture, the slower they would move, but increasing their action if a passing truck splashed the windshield with a large amount of water. Another exclusive was the computer controlled automatic temperature control climate system that did not run the interior blower fan until the until the heater core became warm, thus enhancing passenger comfort.

Standard on all Premiers was an electronically controlled AM/FM stereo sound system. It had an exclusive feature of being a &quot;self-diagnosing&quot; radio. A premium speaker system was standard on the ES models. Successive years featured more sophisticated entertainment units that included a seven band equalizer with memory functions, an advanced cassette deck with music search functionality, and a CD player.

For the initial launch, there was a choice of two powertrains. Eschewing the Renault 25&#x27;s French-built four-cylinder engines, the base Premier &quot;LX&quot; trim featured a standard 2.5 L AMC four-cylinder engine. Featuring electronically controlled throttle-body fuel injection, it developed a peak power output of and of torque at 1400 rpm. This engine was coupled to a new electronically controlled four-speed automatic gearbox, developed by ZF Friedrichshafen. Fuel economy for the base model was EPA estimated at in the city and on the highway, giving it a cruising range with the gas tank. Optional in the LX and standard in &quot;ES&quot; models was a 3.0 L version of the Peugeot-Renault-Volvo (PRV) V6 engine, fitted with multiple port fuel injection, producing peak power and torque figures of at 5000 rpm and at 3570 rpm. Fuel efficiency of the V6 was rated at for the city and on the highway. Factory acceleration estimates from standstill to 60 miles per hour (97 km/h) were 11.5 seconds with the four-cylinder, and 10 seconds with the six. The Premier&#x27;s powertrains were covered by a 7-year, warranty, which was longer than offered by any of the competitors at the time.

Developed by AMC, which was &quot;the Big Three&#x27;s little sister ... with almost no resources, and fighting a vastly superior enemy&quot;, Bob Lutz, then a vice president at Chrysler, wrote that the Premier sedan as one of the &quot;impressive succession of new products&quot; that Chrysler gained from acquiring the small automaker. The Eagle Premier replaced the so-called Liberty car that Chrysler had been developing as the basis of its future cars for many years, but was experiencing problems with this major project.

The Eagle Premier was described as &quot;a world-class car&quot; by automotive journalists, in addition to its international origins with an Italian design and Canadian assembly. &quot;Considered by some the most sophisticated car in Chrysler&#x27;s lineup&quot;, the Eagle Premier offers an &quot;incredible 122 cubic feet of interior room; almost unheard of for a mid-sized passenger car&quot; along with &quot;European handling&quot;. The Premier was &quot;final offspring of the AMC-Renault marriage&quot; and the new car entered the marketplace &quot;well endowed in just about every department. It has the most powerful conventional engines in its field, state-of-the-art electronics with a first-ever feature, and is made in the newest assembly plant in the world.&quot; Road test by &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine described the new &quot;Euro-sedan&quot; as competitive, a &quot;pleasant surprise,&quot; &quot;with a dash of weirdness,&quot; and concluded that &quot;it&#x27;s a sure bet to scare hell out of its competition.&quot;

== Model years ==
=== 1988 ===
The Eagle Premier was launched in January 1988, with the first production models rolling off the assembly line on 28 September 1987. Although the car is sometimes referred to as a Renault Premier, this car was never marketed anywhere in the world as a Renault. Pre-production prototypes left the factory with Renault emblems on their grille and wheel covers, but had an Eagle nameplate on the trunk lids. The Eagle marketing department had to indicate this difference in its dealer information brochures and videos. Before its January 1988 launch, all pre-production cars had the Renault emblem removed from the grille and steering column horn hub pad. Depending on which stereo system was ordered, one would find either a Renault or Eagle emblem in the car through 1989 on the stereo. It was to have been the first body style in a series of three, along with a four-door station wagon and a two-door coupe. After Chrysler purchased Renault&#x27;s stake (46%) in AMC and all other outstanding stock (54%), the wagon and coupe body styles were canceled as was a planned Premier &quot;DL&quot; model featuring a five-speed manual gearbox.

The interior of the &quot;LX&quot; featured standard six-passenger seating, with reclining 55/45 split front bench seats along with a rear seat that included a fold-down center armrest. Map pockets were standard in the front seatbacks. The standard four-speed automatic transmissions were operated using a column shifter. The &quot;ES&quot; models included lower bodyside cladding, a firmer suspension, and larger &quot;touring&quot; tires, as well as individual front bucket seats with adjustable see-through headrests and a full-length console with center armrest. The ES models had seating for five adults. The front bucket seats were optional in the LX, and a console-mounted gear shift was optional in both the LX and ES.

The Premier was highlighted in Chrysler&#x27;s broad product line as being &quot;shaped right&quot; in its being the most aerodynamic sedan built in North America and offering &quot;an American car with European sophistication and handling.&quot;

=== 1989 ===

The second model year the Premier saw almost no other changes except for the addition of cruise control and the mid-year introduction of an &quot;ES Limited&quot; model featuring monochromatic paint and body-colored trim. The list of standard features was expanded or enhanced such as eight premium &quot;Accusound by Jensen&quot; speakers becoming standard on ES models.

Marketing focused on &quot;the swift reflexes of eagles&quot; describing the Premier&#x27;s fully independent suspension components to be sure-footed and athletic to &quot;inspire driver confidence&quot; in addition to the car&#x27;s exclusive seven-year, 70,000-mile protection plan. 

The &quot;sporty&quot; two-door companion model that was announced by Iacocca for this model year to &quot;get the Eagle soaring&quot; with new products and a &quot;brand personality that&#x27;s unique ...and exciting... and upscale&quot; was not released.

====Exports to Japan====
During 1989 sales in the Japanese market began as the Chrysler Premier ES. Available in one version and included the 3.0 L V6 engine and four-speed automatic transmission. The maximum power was . While branded as a Chrysler and given the model code E6U, the Eagle badging remained unchanged from the North American model. The only visible changes were indicator lights on the front fenders and the incorporation of amber turn signals into the rear lights to meet local requirements. Marketing of the special model ended during 1990.

=== 1990 ===

In 1990 the Premier was substantially reengineered. Standard were four-wheel disc brakes and a stainless steel exhaust system. The electrical system was replaced with standard Chrysler parts that proved to be more reliable than the original Renix system. The exterior was changed slightly, the &quot;Design Giugiaro&quot; badges being removed from the front fenders as a result. The fuel crisis period was fading and most buyers selected the V6 engine. The four-cylinder engine was officially dropped from the lineup, with the V6 remaining as the sole engine.

A badge engineered version of the Premier was added using a familiar Chrysler name, the Dodge Monaco, a moniker that was first used by Dodge in 1965 and last used in 1978 on a full-size, rear-drive sedan.

Because of its design &quot;as up-to-date as anything in the mid-sized market,&quot; the Premier now became the foundation for Chrysler&#x27;s next generation of automobiles.

The automatic shifter was relocated to the floor.

=== 1991 ===

The 1991 model year had little news for the Premier except for a new anti-lock braking system (ABS) that was also available on the Canadian-built Dodge Monaco twin. The new safety feature came standard on the ES Limited and was optional on other models. The Limited model received a new front grille and rear tail lamp assemblies.

The marketplace saw a downturn and all automakers began offering incentives to move inventory. At the beginning of the year, supplies of the Eagle Premier climbed up to 222 days and Chrysler gave a $1,000 discount to dealers on the invoice price, a $1,500 rebate to purchasers, and a $2,000 incentive to the dealer per car after their fourth sale. An ES Limited model listing for $19,978 was only $15,478 after the marketing incentives. By the end of the year, Jeep-Eagle dealers had low inventories of Premiers – with only 28 days supply – compared to 119 days for overstocked cars such as the Chevrolet Caprice.

=== 1992 ===

The Eagle Premier and its badge engineered variant, the Dodge Monaco, continued mostly unchanged for 1992, except every model received the grille and tail lamps that were only on the Limited in 1991.&gt; Chrysler also announced it would be the Premier&#x27;s final year as the automaker prepared to launch all its new LH models in the Bramalea assembly plant. Bramalea ended Dodge Monaco and Eagle Premier output on 17 December 1991.

==Legacy==
The Eagle brand targeted consumers that would not typically include purchasing an American sedan, &quot;but would have instead sought out a Volvo or an Audi.&quot; The &quot;upscale&quot; Premier was the flagship of the new Eagle division at Chrysler and in the same class &quot;as cars like the Audi 5000, ... roomy, understated and elegantly turned out.&quot;

&quot;Popular Science&quot;, in a four-car road test, considered the Premier one of the sportiest sedans (by measure of road holding and drive precision) available on the American market. The fully independent suspension on all the wheels made for better ride quality and handling characteristics, as did the rack and pinion steering design. &quot;The Premier was for its size, the lightest car that Chrysler built at the time [with a shipping weight of ], the stiffest (torsionally), and the best riding almost of wheel travel vs. 4.5 for the K-cars that underpinned every Chrysler car then available. It benefited from decades of Renault experience with front-wheel-drive, and a good example will still impress even today.&quot; The engineering levels achieved in the Premier are arguably the most refined in a sedan that was then produced by AMC or Chrysler.

The original projections were to have annual production of 150,000 Premiers. Magna International had signed a contract in 1986 to supply body panels for the Premiers. As a result, the automotive supplier received $10 million in grants from the governments of both Canada and Ontario to expand the metal stamping plant in Milton, Ontario. However, the Premier did not achieve its sales targets, with calendar year production for 1989 only reaching 32,720 examples.

Critics have argued that Chrysler did not properly market the Premier, having confused its intended market. ES models were compared directly with the Audi 80, Acura Legend, and similar &#x27;import&#x27; sedans, while LX models were aimed at a lower-tier market competing against the Ford Taurus and GM A-platform cars (Buick Century, Chevrolet Celebrity, Oldsmobile Cutlass Ciera). Chrysler also ended up with six different brands after the purchase of AMC, just one less than GM, which was four times as large an automaker. Not only could Chrysler not afford to properly promote and advertise each of its brands, but it also faced the legacy of failure by French cars in the United States.

The Premier carried many vestiges of AMC and Renault&#x27;s engineering long after Chrysler acquired the car&#x27;s design. For example, the vehicle identification number for the entire 1988 model year production retained AMC format. The AMC logo was featured on many of the car&#x27;s components through to the end of production.
The introduction of a rebadged model named Dodge Monaco resulted from a contractual obligation to use 260,000 of the PRV engines over five years, a clause in the AMC buyout from Renault. The Monaco sold in low numbers, and both it and the Premier were canceled in 1992. There was little marketing support for the Premier by the Jeep-Eagle dealers themselves because they were focused on selling the highly successful and more profitable Jeep models. Furthermore, the decision to eventually combine Jeep-Eagle with Chrysler-Plymouth dealers called for the long-term corporate goal of phasing out the Eagle brand. There were 139,051 Premiers and Monacos built at Bramalea. Chrysler paid a penalty for every car not produced and V6 engine not purchased from Renault.

A new, &quot;highly advanced&quot; factory (called Bramalea Assembly) was built to manufacture the Premier at Bramalea. This was near an existing AMC plant in Brampton, Ontario, Canada. This state-of-the-art plant was opened in 1986 and was one of AMC&#x27;s assets that interested Chrysler. It was renamed Brampton Assembly after the buyout. Brampton Assembly was retooled for the production of the Chrysler LH-cars that debuted in the autumn of 1992, including the Premier&#x27;s replacement, the Vision, and the Vision&#x27;s sister vehicles, the Dodge Intrepid and the Chrysler Concorde.

The Premier inspired many of the LH platform&#x27;s design features. François Castaing, formerly AMC&#x27;s Vice President of product engineering and development, became Chrysler&#x27;s Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988, and as a result, the Premier was the starting point for Chrysler&#x27;s new LH sedans. Although the cab forward styling was quite different, the engines in the LH cars were mounted longitudinally, like the Premier. This was &quot;a hallmark of Renault&#x27;s front-wheel-drive designs&quot; and unlike any other car built by Chrysler up to that time. The LH platform&#x27;s dedicated transmission, the A606, was also quite similar in design to the electronically controlled automatic featured in four-cylinder Premiers. The Premier&#x27;s body shell was used for LH prototype development mules, under which the LH drivetrain was tested.

Although only a four-door sedan, the Premier could be a &quot;future classic&quot; according to an automotive journalist, Dan Roth, as &quot;one of the best American cars of the last 20 years, able to hold its own against luxury European marques, and being a caretaker of the last AMC car (Jeeps aren&#x27;t cars!) would be a responsibility we&#x27;d relish.&quot;

<doc id="863481" wikidata="Q617415" url="?curid=863481" title="Chrysler 300M">
<text>The Chrysler 300M is a full-size luxury car that was produced by Daimler/Chrysler from 1999 to 2004. It is a front-wheel drive, V6 engined car using the Chrysler LH platform. Versus its platform mates, the 300M was roughly shorter to make it more easily exportable to Europe. Priced above the Concorde and identically to the LHS, the 300M shared Chrysler&#x27;s flagship position with the LHS until the LHS&#x27;s discontinuation after 2001, upon which it became Chrysler&#x27;s sole flagship model.

==Design==
Prior to Chrysler redesigning the LH-cars in 1998, the Eagle Vision filled the &quot;import-fighter&quot; segment. Its second-generation replacement was reportedly benchmarked against the BMW 5 Series, yet with Chrysler discontinuing the entire Eagle line after 1998, the automaker shifted this vehicle to the Chrysler lineup, bringing back the famed &quot;300&quot; model name. Although the cars were not rear-wheel-drive, special-production models, nor V8-powered with engines rated at 300 horsepower as did the historic models, the 300M used the next letter available in the 300 Letter Series, following the 1965 300L. The 300M also lacked the traditional &quot;cross-hair&quot; grille of previous 300 models, as by the mid-1980s it had been adopted by sister division Dodge for its entire model line.

Had the Eagle brand not been dropped, the 300M reportedly would have been sold as a redesigned Eagle Vision. Test cars, factory manuals, and design images were prepared for the second-generation Vision featuring a prominent Eagle badge on the grille. Sharing its powertrain and interior with the Chrysler LHS, the 300M was some ten inches shorter in overall length, allowing it to fit the European &quot;5-metre&quot; (16.4 ft) size class for exports to Europe. Despite this, wheelbase was shared with all other second generation LH cars, with reductions in length coming from shortened front and rear overhangs.

==Powertrain==
Only one engine was available, the Chrysler-engineered 3.5 L V6, initially created for first-generation LH vehicles and revamped for the newer LH line. It was shared with the Plymouth Prowler and a limited edition R/T variant of the second-generation Dodge Intrepid. The engine was shared with the LHS and rebadged Concorde (2002–2004). For 1999, it was rated at , and of torque. It was connected to the 42LE, a four-speed automatic transmission with Autostick, which allowed manual selection of gears. Standard gear ratio on the 300M was 3.66:1.

==Year-to-year changes==

In 1999, automatic headlamps were added, and the Handling Group removed the speed limiter. In 2000, an interlock was added to prevent shifting the transmission from Park unless the brake pedal was pressed; and tether anchors were added to the rear shelf for child seats. The 2001 model year brought more changes, with an optional luxury group that included an automatic dimming driver-side mirror and supplemental side airbags. A more advanced EVIC (trip computer) was made optional. The 300M also received new jeweled taillights.

In 2002, electronic brake distribution was added to the antilock brakes; a new computer combined engine and transmission controls; latch tethers were now built-in; and &quot;natural&quot; evaporative emission monitoring was added. The 300M Special was offered beginning midyear 2002. It featured a 3.5 liter engine designed to use premium (91+ octane) gasoline and producing of torque, with a 3.89 final drive ratio. Performance-type dual exhaust, high-performance brakes, and 18-inch Z-rated tires were standard, with Michelin Pilot Sport 245/45R18 performance tires optional. Other standard features of the Special included premium &quot;Waterfall&quot; leather seats, signal mirrors, body cladding, and slightly lower ride height. This model also included high-intensity discharge headlamps and imitation-carbon-fiber interior trim panels that replaced the standard woodgrain trim panels. A limited number of 300M &quot;Pro-Am&quot; models were marketed during 2002. These versions included an Infinity audio system with subwoofers as well as two-toned leather interiors. The Pro-Am also came with a set of limited edition golf clubs and a holder for a golf bag in the trunk. In 2003, new colors were added, a six-disc CD changer replaced the four-disc changer, and the changer controls were added to the stereo.

2004 brought optional Sirius Satellite Radio and an optional stereo with DVD-based GPS navigation. For the 2004 model year, Chrysler offered the Platinum Series 300M to coincide with the company&#x27;s 20th anniversary of Chrysler&#x27;s original minivan (Dodge Caravan/Chrysler Town &amp; County/Plymouth Voyager). In addition to the 300M, five other vehicles were offered as Platinum Series: the Sebring Convertible, PT Cruiser, Sebring Sedan, Sebring Coupe, and Town &amp; Country. The Platinum Series 300M was available only in three exterior colors: Graphite Metallic, Bright Silver Metallic, or Brilliant Black Crystal. Other features included: deep slate/light taupe two-tone interior, chrome door handles, deep gloss black turn signal mirrors with a reverse gear auto pivot feature, and 17-inch chrome wheels. A 360-watt Infinity II Cassette/CD player, and a no-charge SIRIUS satellite radio system with a one-year SIRIUS subscription were also included. Additional features include leather seats, satin silver bezels, chrome or platinum clad wheels, and other unique interior features. These models have a special Platinum Series badging on the C pillars.

For 2005, both the 300M and the Concorde were replaced with the Chrysler 300.

==Awards==
The 300M was &quot;Motor Trend&quot; magazine&#x27;s Car of the Year for 1999. It also was on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s Ten Best list for 1999 and 2000.

<text>Capsella is a genus of herbaceous annual and biennial plants in the family Brassicaceae. It is a close relative of &quot;Arabidopsis&quot;, &quot;Neslia&quot;, and &quot;Halimolobos&quot;.

Some authors circumscribe &quot;Capsella&quot; to contain only three species: &quot;Capsella bursa-pastoris&quot;, &quot;Capsella rubella&quot; and &quot;Capsella grandiflora&quot;. , Kew&#x27;s Plants of the World Online list eight species.

&quot;Capsella rubella&quot; is a self-fertilizing species that became self-compatible 50,000 to 100,000 years ago. Its outcrossing progenitor was &quot;Capsella grandiflora&quot;. In general, the shift from outcrossing to self-fertilization is among the most common transitions in flowering plants. &quot;Capsella rubella&quot; is studied as a model for understanding the evolution of self-fertilization.

The name is said to derive from Latin &quot;capsa&quot;, a box or case, alluding to fruit resembling a medieval wallet or purse; the suffix &quot;-ella&quot; denotes &quot;lesser&quot;.

==Species==
Species include:
*&quot;Capsella bursa-pastoris&quot; 
*&quot;Capsella gracilis&quot; (sterile hybrid)
*&quot;Capsella grandiflora&quot; 
*&quot;Capsella lycia&quot; 
*&quot;Capsella mexicana&quot; 
*&quot;Capsella orientalis&quot; 
*&quot;Capsella puberula&quot; 
*&quot;Capsella rubella&quot; 
*&quot;Capsella tasmanica&quot;

<text>Royal Air Force Abingdon, or more simply RAF Abingdon, is a former Royal Air Force station near Abingdon, Oxfordshire. It is now known as Dalton Barracks and is used by the Royal Logistic Corps.

==History==
In 1925, a plan was approved to build an airfield near Abingdon, south west of Oxford, which would be suitable as a base for light bombers. Construction began in 1929, and the RAF station was formally opened on 1 September 1932. 40 Squadron, a light bomber squadron equipped with the Fairey Gordon arrived on 8 October that year, with Oxford University Air Squadron moving in during November. On 16 November 1933 HQ Central Area moved to RAF Abingdon. The Hawker Hart-equipped 15 Squadron reformed at Abingdon in June 1934, bringing the station up to its designed peacetime establishment of two squadrons. 40 Squadron re-equipped with Harts in 1935. In 1936, the RAF began a major expansion of its strength, with a flight of 40 Squadron being detached to form the nucleus of 104 Squadron in January, and 98 Squadron similarly created from a flight of 15 Squadron in February. Central Area was disbanded by being renamed No. 1 (Bomber) Group RAF on 1 May 1936, which became part of RAF Bomber Command on 14 July 1936.

98 and 104 Squadrons moved out of Abingdon to RAF Hucknall in August 1936, but the expansion process continued, with 52 Squadron being split off from 15 Squadron in January 1937 before moving to RAF Upwood in March, and 62 Squadron being split from 40 Squadron in May, moving to RAF Cranfield in July. In March 1938, 185 Squadron was split off from 40 Squadron, with 106 Squadron split off from 15 Squadron in June 1938. The Abingdon-based squadrons re-equipped with the Fairey Battle monoplane light bomber in July 1938, before 106 and 185 Squadrons moved to RAF Thornton in August and September that year. 103 Squadron moved to Abington to equip with Battles in September 1938, before transferring to RAF Benson in April 1939. 

===Second World War===
Orders arrived on 24–25 August 1939 to mobilise the squadrons at Abingdon prior to proceeding to France as part of the Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF). On receipt of orders to move to France, Headquarters No. 1 Group became Headquarters AASF and the station headquarters and the two Fairey Battle squadrons (15 and 40 Squadrons) at Abingdon became No. 71 (Bomber) Wing RAF, departing for France on 2 September.

In September 1939, two squadrons (97 Squadron and 166 Squadron), both equipped with the Armstrong Whitworth Whitley bomber and serving as training squadrons for 4 Group&#x27;s operational squadrons, moved to Abingdon. In April 1940, the two squadrons merged to form No. 10 Operational Training Unit RAF. 10 OTU was based at the airfield from April 1940 until 1946. From 1940 to 1942, Abingdon&#x27;s station commander was Herbert Massey.

===1945–1960===
After the Second World War RAF Abingdon became part of RAF Transport Command, and also became the home of No. 1 Parachute Training School RAF which is now stationed at RAF Brize Norton. The Parachute Training School, and RAF Abingdon generally, featured heavily in the 1953 Alan Ladd film &quot;The Red Beret&quot; (called &quot;Paratrooper&quot; in the USA), and the Parachute Training School was used as a location for some scenes for the films &quot;Carve Her Name With Pride&quot; (1958) and &quot;Operation Crossbow&quot; (1965) as well as the French comedy &quot;Babette s&#x27;en va-t-en guerre&quot; (1959) which starred Brigitte Bardot. On 14 June 1968 Queen Elizabeth II conducted a royal review at RAF Abingdon to mark the 50th anniversary of the RAF.

About 1948–49 Headquarters No. 47 Group RAF, Transport Command, was at RAF Abingdon. The station, its personnel and aircraft (Yorks and Hastings) were involved in the Berlin Airlift.

In 1952 a ferry unit was based at RAF Abingdon. It moved Mosquito, Hornet, Meteor, Vampire and Spitfire aircraft. 15 Sabres were ferried from Canada but only 12 arrived. After checks and servicing the Sabres went to RAF Germany.

In 1953 all flying units dispersed to other units to make way for Nos. 24 and 47 Squadrons operating Handley Page Hastings Mks 1, 2 and 4. The three Mk 4 Hastings (&quot;shiny fleet&quot;) belonged to 24 Squadron, serialled WD324, 326 and 500.

Also 1953, RAF Abingdon received the freedom of Abingdon.

On 22 April 1953 the spy George Blake arrived at RAF Abingdon, back from Korea via Moscow and Berlin.

In 1955 47 Squadron changed its Hastings for the Blackburn Beverley. Later 24 Squadron moved to RAF Colerne. It was replaced by No. 53 Squadron RAF operating the Beverley.

In 1956 in support of the R.A.F. relief efforts to Hungarian Freedom Fighters, 47 Squadron Beverley&#x27;s flew medical, canteen and bedding supplies to Vienna, Austria Nov.7th 1956.

===1961–1992===
Besides London University Air Squadron, the Oxford University Air Squadron was based at RAF Abingdon. Abingdon was also the home of No. 6 AEF (Air Experience Flight) operating between 6 and 8 DHC Chipmunks for ATC/CCF Air Cadet flight experience training. 6 AEF was one of a very few locations that offered air cadets the &quot;Air Cadet Navigator&quot; training course, leading to the award of Cadet Navigation Wings.

In the late 1960s the Blackburn Beverleys&#x27; hangars had dormer extensions put in the roof to take the extra height of the tailplane of the Short Belfasts of No. 47 Squadron. Once the nose of the Belfast was in the hangar the nose had to be lifted to get the tail fin under the lip of the roof. The nose was then lowered and the tail fin rose up into the dormer roof for that parking position. No. 46 Squadron was also at Abingdon at this time flying Hawker Siddeley Andovers, one of their roles being to support UK MAMS (United Kingdom Mobile Air Movements). A small Army Air Dispatch unit was also supported by the airfield at this time.

From 1975 through to the 1990s, Abingdon became a maintenance field, with the AMS (Aircraft Maintenance Squadron) servicing:
* SEPECAT Jaguar; the last Jaguar to undergo major maintenance here left during April 1992.
* Hawker Hunter
* Blackburn Buccaneer from September 1987, previously at St Athan.
* BAE Hawk which were maintained by the Hawk Major Maintenance Flight, which had formed in January 1982. 

In the early 80s the Battle of Britain Memorial Flight&#x27;s Lancaster bomber spent a couple of winters at RAF Abingdon to undergo major refurbishment. During this period, RAF Abingdon was also home to the Field Repair Squadron (later Repair &amp; Salvage Squadron) which included Aircraft Repair Flight, Aircraft Salvage and Transportation Flight (formerly 71 MU &quot;Crash &amp; Smash&quot;) and Battle Damage Repair Flight.

From 1986 to 1988 RAF Abingdon became home to the Thames Valley Police Air Support Unit, flying a helicopter on police operations. It was also the home of the University of London Air Squadron in the seventies. An annual airshow took place at RAF Abingdon until the early nineties.

From 1981 many ex-airline Vickers VC10s were stored at the station following their purchase by the MoD. By the early 1990s, the aircraft were either converted to tankers or scrapped. It was intended that the 3 Air Maintenance Support (3 AMS) unit would move from RAF Brize Norton, only a few miles away, to undertake the major servicing of the VC10 military fleet. This would have involved the modification of a number of hangars to raise the roof to allow access for the VC10 high tail section at a cost of £5m, instead this work was moved to St. Athan. 

=== Closure ===
In July 1992 a white paper to review defence requirements &quot;Option for Change&quot; recommended the closure of RAF Abingdon and that a new hangar, known as &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; be built at RAF St Athan with the reforming of 3 AMS, from RAF Brize Norton to 1 AMS at RAF St Athan in August 1992.

RAF Abingdon closed on 31 July 1992, with the Oxford and London University Air Squadron and No. 6 Air Experience Flight moving to RAF Benson. The station was transferred to the British Army and it was renamed Dalton Barracks. RAF Benson continues to use Abingdon as a diversion airfield and for helicopter training.

===Squadrons===
===Units===
The following units were also here at some point:
==Accidents and incidents==
The operational training unit at RAF Abingdon suffered numerous air crashes from 1939 to 1946. Many of the crashes were close to the airfield.
* On 17 January 1941 Armstrong Whitworth Whitley V N1494 was taking off from Abingdon for a night training flight despite there being a snowstorm. The aircraft crashed in Wootton Road, killing the pilot and three other members of the crew. Two other crewmen parachuted to safety. The survivors reported that ice had caused one engine to fail.
* On 5 July 1941 Armstrong Whitworth Whitley V Z6667 was on a night training flight from Abingdon when it crashed at Chiselhampton. The cause was variously attributed to either a &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; night fighter or friendly fire by a local anti-aircraft unit. All six crew were killed.
* On 22 June 1953 Handley Page Hastings WJ335 stalled and crashed on takeoff at RAF Abingdon. The elevator control locks had been left engaged. All six crew were killed.
* On 5 March 1957 a 53 Squadron Blackburn Beverley took off from the airfield but suffered fuel starvation, tried to turn back and crashed at Sutton Wick from the airfield. Three crew, 15 passengers (including RAF Police and six of their dogs) and two civilians on the ground were killed.
* On 6 July 1965 another RAF Handley Page Hastings took off for a parachute drop but crashed at Little Baldon, killing all 41 people aboard.
* On 23 September 1988 a Lockheed S-3 Viking failed to stop on the runway, skidded across the grass and came to a stop on Barrow road to the south of the airfield, while ferrying from USS Theodore Roosevelt. No crew members were injured.
* On 23 September 1988 a McDonnell Douglas Phantom FGR2 crashed at the airfield while practising for the annual airshow, killing both crew (Flt Lt Chris Lackman &amp; Flt Lt Jack Thompson).
* On 14 September 1989 a Panavia Tornado crashed near the airfield.
* On 14 June 2009 an RAF Grob Tutor and a civilian glider crashed near the airfield, killing an Air Training Corps cadet and an instructor. The glider pilot parachuted from his aircraft in time and was unharmed.
* On 14 May 2017 a Silence Twister aerobatics plane crashed whilst performing a display at an airshow. The pilot was injured but made a full recovery.

<text>The Atlanta Botanical Garden is a botanical garden located adjacent to Piedmont Park in Midtown Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Incorporated in 1976, the garden&#x27;s mission is to &quot;develop and maintain plant collections for the purposes of display, education, conservation, research and enjoyment.&quot;
==History==

Following a petition by citizens of Atlanta in 1973, the garden was incorporated in 1976, as the private, 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation &quot;Atlanta Botanical Garden Inc.&quot;. The garden incorporated the pre-existing Dr. A. Leslie Stephens Memorial Bonsai Garden, now known as the Japanese Garden. Within a year Bill Warner, previously employed at Holden Arboretum, was assigned office as the first executive director. He was soon followed by Ann L. Crammond in 1979. The following year marked a turning point in the history of the garden as a 50-year lease was negotiated with the city, securing the site of the Garden for years to come.

A number of promotional activities started taking place, including social events, major art exhibitions and the annual Garden of Eden Ball. The Atlanta Botanical Garden welcomed its 50,000th visitor within a mere three years after the lease was arranged - this was even before any permanent structures had been erected. In 1985, the Atlanta Botanical Garden built its first permanent structure, the Gardenhouse. Expansions following this were The Children&#x27;s Garden (1999), the Fuqua Conservatory in 1989, and the Fuqua Orchid Center which was added in 2002.

Blockbuster summertime exhibitions began in 2003 with TREEmendous TREEhouses. Chihuly in the Garden opened in 2004, while in 2005 Locomotion in the Garden featured G-scale model trains. On April 29, 2006, an exhibition of the sculpture of Niki de Saint Phalle opened to the public. These huge mosaic sculptures came to the Garden from France, Germany, and California. In 2007, the exhibition was David Rogers&#x27; Big Bugs and Killer Plants, and 2008 is Sculpture in Motion, Art Choreographed by Nature, a display of moving, kinetic art. In 2009, the Garden hosted an exhibition of the monumental bronze sculptures of Henry Moore. The summers of 2010 and 2011 showcased the Garden&#x27;s green expansion (see below), and in 2012, the Garden hosted Independent Visions, an exhibition of contemporary sculptures by nine artists. In 2013, the Garden will unveil Imaginary Worlds: Plants Larger than Life, made up of 19 mosaic culture sculptures. In 2016, Chihuly in the Garden open again with 19 installations throughout the Garden.

In the winter the Garden has a holiday light show. &quot;Garden Lights, Holiday Nights&quot; began in 2011 featuring displays created with more than 1 million lights, most of them LED. The following year, the show grew to more than 1.5 million lights and attracted more than 160,000 visitors. 

==Chihuly in the Garden Exhibition==
In 2004, the Atlanta Botanical Garden hosted an exhibition of glass art by Dale Chihuly titled &quot;Chihuly in the Garden&quot;. The exhibit ran through the end of October and was extended until December 31, 2004. During the eight-month run, an estimated 425,000 attendees visited the exhibit. The peak per-day rates of 7,500 were double the previous single-day attendance record at the Garden. Chihuly in the Garden returned to the Atlanta location on April 30, 2016, with 19 new installations.

==Green Expansion Plan==

The Green Expansion Plan was a large-scale expansion project that was completed in the spring of 2010 that doubled the size of the Garden while modernizing them at the same time. The expansion plan encompassed the construction of a number of new facilities, the most noticeable of which are the new visitor center and canopy walk.

The plan was built around five key areas of human and environmental health: sustainable site development, water savings, energy efficiency, materials selection and indoor environmental quality. By employing an array of energy-saving strategies with environmental sustainability considered throughout the project and recycling any trees removed as a result of construction, considerable efforts were made to make this expansion eco-friendly. A 100,000-gallon cistern was installed underground in December 2007 to aid in water conservation; the cistern fills with only an inch and a quarter of rain and waters about 40% of the new gardens.

One striking feature of the new visitor center is the innovative green roof, with plants covering nearly 50% of the roof area. It provides natural cooling, sound insulation and additional garden area for visitors, and even a new wildlife habitat. The visitor center leads visitors to the canopy walk.

The garden&#x27;s old parking lot is now a Edible Garden featuring an outdoor kitchen; this new garden reconnects people with food and healthful eating. And the final aspect of the garden expansion plan is the conversion of its old entry drive to a large cascades garden filled with tropical plants and gently flowing waterfalls.

==Canopy Walk==

The Atlanta Botanical Garden is home to the Kendeda Canopy Walk, a skywalk that allows the visitors to tour one of the city&#x27;s last remaining urban forests from around 40 feet in the air through the treetops of the Storza Woods. The skywalk extends from a bluff in the Garden into the branches of oaks, hickories and poplars. The structure also provides an aerial view of the woodland garden below.

The Canopy Walk was built for $55 million and opened in 2010. It was originally set to open in 2009, but during its construction in 2008, the skywalk collapsed, killing one worker and injuring 18 others. Because of the uniqueness of the Canopy Walk, city leaders believe it will become an icon for Atlanta.

==Exhibits==
The Botanical Garden is composed of a number of smaller themed gardens. Each contains different landscapes to display a variety of plants. Near the entrance are formal gardens, such as the Japanese garden and the rose garden. Two woodland areas, the Upper Woodland and the Storza Woods feature large trees and shade-loving flowers and undergrowth. The Children&#x27;s Garden features whimsical sculptures, fountains, and interpretive exhibits on botany, ecology, and nutrition.

The Dorothy Chapman Fuqua Conservatory contains indoor exhibits of plants from tropical rainforests and deserts. The rain forest room of the Fuqua Conservatory is also populated by tropical birds, turtles, and several exhibits of poison dart frogs, the last of which is a collaboration in conservation efforts with Zoo Atlanta. Adjoining this building, the Fuqua Orchid Center contains separate rooms simulating the tropics and high elevations in order to house rare orchids from around the world.

The Fuqua Orchid Center is home to the largest collection of species orchids on permanent display in the U.S. and hosts a wintertime display known as Orchid Daze. Its unique Tropical High Elevation House provides the correct habitat for montane orchids and companion plants from around the equator at elevations of 6,000 to 10,000 feet. An Air Washer System, technology adapted from the textile industry, was combined with traditional greenhouse heating and cooling to create this environment and allows rare orchids to thrive. The Tropical Display House is filled with fragrant orchids from around the world.

The Earth Goddess is a 25-foot sculpture that is a centerpiece of the Cascades Garden. It was the highlight of the &quot;Imaginary Worlds&quot; exhibition that was showcased in 2013–2014. It has since become a permanent part of the Cascades Garden.

Danielson released his own statement a day later that expressed regret at his decision to &quot;cross the line.&quot; &quot;I accept responsibility for my choices and apologize to everyone in my life for them – in and out of the sport&quot;, he said.

In August 2015, Danielson revealed he tested positive for synthetic testosterone. In October 2016, he accepted a four-year suspension for &quot;unintentionally consuming&quot; dehydroepiandrosterone.
