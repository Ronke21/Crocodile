<text>The Forest Stewardship Council [[Gesellschaft mit beschränkter Haftung|GmbH]] (FSC) is an international non-profit, multistakeholder organization established in 1993 that promotes responsible management of the world&#x27;s forests via timber certification. This organization uses a market-based approach to transnational environmental policy.

FSC is a global forest certification system established for forests and forest products. According to the council, the use of the FSC logo signifies that a product comes from environmentally, socially, and economically responsible sources. In addition to its global certification standard, FSC develops national standards in selected countries. The FSC has 10 Principles and associated Criteria (FSC P&amp;C) that form the basis for all FSC standards and certification.

FSC was established in 1993 as a response to concerns over global deforestation. It now has around 1200 members, including the World Wide Fund for Nature and IKEA.

== History ==

Tropical deforestation as a global concern rose to prominence in the 1980s and can be attributed in part to environmentalists and northern countries advocating for the need to protect tropical woodland. A number of other economic and regulatory mechanisms such as financial aid, policy frameworks, and trade conventions were also established to prevent and mitigate deforestation. These include the International Tropical Timber Agreement (1983), the Convention of International Trade on Endangered Species (1975) and the Global Environment Facility (1991).

Despite the increased levels of concern in the run-up to the 1992 Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, tensions between the North and the global South over access to finance and technology for the preservation of forests protracted negotiations. Although many Northern countries had hoped for a legally binding convention, the resulting Statement of Forest Principles represents the &quot;mean position of the lowest common denominator&quot; and is voluntary. Disappointed with the outcome of the Earth Summit, NGOs such as the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) began to turn their attention to industry for a governance-oriented resolution to deforestation.

In the lead-up to the Earth Summit, social groups, NGOs, and industries were also beginning to consult on the issue of deforestation. In America, the consultation process that eventually led to the establishment of the FSC was initiated in 1990 and concluded in the confirmation of support for the development of a voluntary worldwide certification and accreditation governance system that would cover all forest types.

In the UK, NGO WWF began to facilitate action through the establishment of the 1995 Group, recruiting organizations that had been spurred on by instances of direct action and boycotting over the sale of tropical wood to form an NGO-business partnership. Through stakeholder involvement, it became apparent that a standard-setting body would be required to verify the source of wood products and define sustainable forest management. After 18 months of consultation in ten different countries, the Forest Stewardship Council was established in 1993.

The failure of governments to reach any notable form of consensus in the form of an internationally reaching and legally binding agreement caused both disillusionment and an opportunity for change through the involvement of civil society and business actors to form &quot;soft law&quot;. As such the establishment of the Forest Stewardship Council as the response to this disillusionment also represents a global shift from government to governance and its creation is a primary example of the use of market and economic factors to create movement on a global environmental issue.

In February 2012, the membership approved the first major revision to the 10 Principles and associated Criteria (FSC P&amp;C), which form the basis for all FSC standards and certification, in order to bring its certification up to date. The review and revision of the FSC P&amp;C began in 2008 and gathered feedback from many FSC members and other stakeholders. This revision also marked the start of a process of developing baseline requirements for each of the revised Criteria. These requirements – called International Generic Indicators (IGIs) – are intended to ensure consistent application of the FSC P&amp;C across all countries. Where national standards are not currently established, the IGIs will be used as interim standards.

On 25 September 2009, the first FSC Friday took place in Bonn. FSC Friday is a once-a-year promotional event dedicated to the celebration of forests around the globe and the promotion of responsible forest management worldwide.

== Purpose ==

The FSC&#x27;s stated mission is to &quot;promote environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial, and economically viable management of the world&#x27;s forests&quot;. It claims that forests managed to its standards offer benefits to both local and wider communities, and these are said to include cleaner air and water, and a contribution to mitigating the effects of climate change. FSC addresses issues such as illegal logging, deforestation and global warming and some reports indicate positive effects on economic development, environmental conservation, poverty alleviation, and social and political empowerment.

To this end, the body has published a global strategy with five goals:
# Advancing globally responsible forest management.
# Ensure equitable access to the benefits of FSC systems.
# Ensure integrity, credibility and transparency of the FSC system.
# Create business value for products from FSC certified forests.
# Strengthen the global network to deliver on goals 1 through 4.

These goals are promoted, managed, and developed through six program areas: forests, chain of custody, social policy, monitoring and evaluation, quality assurance, and ecosystem services.

== Structure and governance ==

FSC is an international membership organization with a governance structure based on participation, democracy, equity and transparency. It is a platform for forest owners, timber industries, social groups and environmental organizations to find solutions to improve forest management practices. It is an example of a product-oriented multistakeholder governance group.

It is governed by its members, who join either as individuals or as representatives of organizations. Members apply to join one of three chambers – environmental, social and economic. Each chamber is divided into northern and southern sub-chambers and votes are weighted to ensure that north and south each have 50%. This system is designed to ensure that influence is shared equally between different interest groups, without having to limit the number of members.

FSC has three levels of decision-making bodies: The General Assembly, the Board of Directors and the executive director. The General Assembly, which takes place every three years, is made up of the three membership chambers and is the highest decision-making body in FSC. Every member has the right to attend, formulate and submit motions, and vote. The FSC Board of Directors is accountable to the FSC members. It is made up of nine elected individuals who are FSC members and advocates. One member of the board of directors is elected from each sub-chamber of the General Assembly. The executive director runs FSC on a day-to-day basis with the support of a professional team at the FSC International Center. He or she is accountable to the FSC Board of Directors.

While the FSC International Center is based in Bonn, Germany, it has a decentralized network of FSC Network Partners that promote responsible forest management on behalf of FSC. FSC Network Partners include FSC National Offices, FSC National Representatives and FSC National Focal Points.

Kim Carstensen has been the Director General of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) since October 2012.

=== Membership and partners ===
FSC has around 1200 members, including NGOs such as the World Wide Fund for Nature; civil society organizations; forestry-focused research organizations; certification organizations; private companies in the forestry, timber and paper industries, such as IKEA (Sweden); and trade unions and workers&#x27; associations.

Numerous governments worldwide have strengthened market-based incentives for timber certification by providing tax benefits to certified companies, referencing certified products as requirements in their procurement policies and supporting projects linked to FSC through their international development agencies. Some companies also choose timber certification as a tool to demonstrate their commitment to sustainability.

FSC is a member of the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labelling (ISEAL) Alliance, an association of voluntary international standard setting and certification organizations focused on social and environmental issues. Since 2006, FSC has complied with ISEAL&#x27;s Code of Good Practice for Setting Social and Environmental standards, aimed at assuring high standards for credible behavior in ethical trade.

In 2009, FSC began a pilot project with Fairtrade International (FLO) to help community-based and small-scale timber producers get a fair price for their products and gain visibility in the marketplace. The first jointly labelled FSC-FLO products went onto the market in 2011, using wood from the forests of the Curacautín Valley in Chile, manufactured commercially by Swedish firm Kährs.

FSC also works in liaison with the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). It contributes to the ISO&#x27;s committees on sustainable criteria for bioenergy, environmental auditing and environmental labelling.

== Standards and accreditation ==
FSC is a global forest certification system established for forests and forest products. FSC International sets the framework for developing and maintaining international, national and sub-national standards. This is intended to ensure that the process for developing FSC policies and standards is transparent, independent and participatory. A number of alternative national and regional forest certification bodies also exist around the globe.

The FSC has 10 Principles and associated Criteria that form the basis for all FSC standards and certification.

Using the FSC logo supposedly signifies that the product comes from responsible sources—environmentally appropriate, socially beneficial and economically viable. The FSC label is used on a wide range of timber and non-timber products, from paper and furniture to medicine and jewelry, and aims to give consumers the option of supporting responsible forestry.

=== National Forest Stewardship Standard ===
In addition to its global certification standard, FSC develops national standards in selected countries. These standards are closely aligned to the global certification standard and its criteria, but are adapted to local context conditions. Currently, so called National Forest Stewardship Standards exist for the following countries (sorted by first year of introduction):

=== Accreditation ===
FSC does not conduct certification audits itself, developing procedures and standards to evaluate whether certification bodies can provide independent and competent certification services. This process is known as &#x27;accreditation&#x27;.

A potential certification body must gain FSC accreditation to be able to evaluate, monitor and certify companies to FSC standards. To become FSC accredited, certifiers have to comply with an extensive set of rules and procedures verified by Assurance Services International GmbH – an international assurance organisation for voluntary sustainability standards and initiatives including MSC and RSPO. To control the continued implementation of FSC rules and procedures, every year ASI conducts at least one office and one field assessment for each FSC accredited certification body. The exact number and distribution of ASI assessments takes a number of complex factors into account (geographic areas, policies or products that carry increased risk) and the number of FSC certificates handled by an accredited certification body.

Some summaries of ASI surveillance audits are publicly available on the ASI website. If an FSC accredited certification body is found to not fully comply with FSC rules and procedures, nonconformities are raised.

If an accreditation body finds forest management at an organisation to be non-compliant, pre-conditions are noted which must be fulfilled before the FSC certificate can be awarded. If minor non-compliances are noted, the certificate can be issued with conditions that have to be met within a clearly determined timeframe. An accreditation body audits each FSC certificate issued at least once a year. Non-compliance results in a request to make the prescribed changes within a given timeframe or lose its FSC certificate. Depending on the seriousness of the infringement, the timeline can go from one year for minor administrative infringements to immediate action for major infringements.

== Certifications ==
In September 2012, some 165 million hectares were certified to FSC&#x27;s Principles and Criteria in 80 countries. Around 24,000 FSC Chain of Custody certificates were active in 107 countries. The FSC website has statistics on regional distributions, ownership and forest type and numbers of FSC certificates representing all valid forest management and chain of custody certificates. 
The expenses for successful forest management certification typically are divided into costs for the enhancement of sustainability, audits, and secondary costs (e.g. losses of stumpage revenues).

=== Forest management certification ===
Forest management certification is a voluntary process for verifying responsible forest practices. An FSC-accredited certification body performs a forest inspection at the request of the forest owner or operator. Certificate holders are charged an annual fee to renew their accreditation, and continuous compliance is expected.

The FSC P&amp;C apply to all tropical, temperate and boreal forests and many tree plantations and partially replanted forests. Though mainly designed for forest management for timber products, they are also largely relevant for non-timber products (e.g. Brazil nuts) and other environmental services such as clean water and air and carbon sequestration.

The Revised P&amp;C were approved in February 2012. The basic requirements are:

# The Organization shall comply with all applicable laws, regulations and nationally ratified international treaties, conventions and agreements.
# The Organization shall maintain or enhance the social and economic wellbeing of workers.
# The Organization shall identify and uphold indigenous peoples&#x27; legal and customary rights of ownership, use and management of land, territories and resources affected by management activities.
# The Organization shall contribute to maintaining or enhancing the social and economic wellbeing of local communities
# The Organization shall efficiently manage the range of multiple products and services of the Management Unit to maintain or enhance long-term economic viability and the range of environmental and social benefits.
# The Organization shall maintain, conserve and/or restore ecosystem services and environmental values of the Management Unit, and shall avoid, repair or mitigate negative environmental impacts.
# The Organization shall have a management plan consistent with its policies and objectives and proportionate to scale, intensity and risks of its management activities. The management plan shall be implemented and kept up to date based on monitoring information in order to promote adaptive management. The associated planning and procedural documentation shall be sufficient to guide staff, inform affected stakeholders and interested stakeholders and to justify management decisions.
# The Organization shall demonstrate that, progress towards achieving the management objectives, the impacts of management activities and the condition of the Management Unit, are monitored and evaluated proportionate to the scale, intensity and risk of management activities, in order to implement adaptive management.
# The Organization shall maintain and/or enhance the High Conservation Values in the Management Unit through applying the precautionary approach.
# Management activities conducted by or for The Organization for the Management Unit shall be selected and implemented consistent with The Organization&#x27;s economic, environmental and social policies and objectives and in compliance with the Principles and Criteria collectively.

=== Chain of Custody certification ===

The FSC Chain of Custody (CoC) system allows the tracking of FSC certified material from the forest to the consumer. It is a method by which companies can show their commitment to the environment and responsible forest management. Only companies that have FSC chain of custody certification are allowed to use the FSC trademarks and labels to promote their products. The FSC label therefore provides a link between responsible production and responsible consumption and helps the consumer to make socially and environmentally responsible buying decisions.

Once a forest is certified it is important to be able to trace the products that come from it throughout the supply chain to ensure that any claims on the origin of the product are credible and verifiable. FSC chain of custody certification is a voluntary process. It is a tracking system that allows manufacturers and traders to demonstrate that timber comes from a forest that is responsibly managed in accordance with the FSC P&amp;C. It tracks the flow of certified wood through the supply chain and across borders through each successive stage – including processing, transformation and manufacturing – all the way to the final product. It is up to a company to initiate the certification process by requesting the services of an accredited certification body to inspect its internal tracking procedures. Companies committing to FSC include home-improvement or DIY companies, publishers and retailers, amongst many others.

All operations that want to produce an FSC-certified product or want to make corresponding sales claims must comply with FSC&#x27;s international standards for chain of custody. An operation must specify the range of products they wish to sell as FSC certified and promote with the FSC trademark. The certification body inspects the operation to ensure that controls are in place to identify eligible sources for the specified product range and to prevent certified and recycled material from mixing with material from unacceptable sources. If an operation complies with FSC standards, the company is issued an FSC chain of custody certificate. Major failure to comply with the standard will normally disqualify the candidate from certification or lead to de-certification.

=== Controlled wood certification ===

The FSC Mix label was introduced in 2004. It allows manufacturers to mix FSC-certified material with uncertified materials in FSC-labeled products under controlled conditions. It aims to avoid the use of wood products from &quot;unacceptable&quot; sources in FSC-labeled products. Unacceptable sources include illegally harvested wood, wood harvested in violation of traditional and civil rights, wood harvested in HCV forests and wood harvested from areas where genetically modified trees are planted.

=== Recognition in green building certification systems ===
FSC certified construction wood and construction products made from FSC certified wood can contribute to green building certification systems. Some green building certification systems are recognizing a FSC certification in general. Others award different scores to products with FSC 100, FSC MIX or FSC RECYCLED.

FSC certified wood products contribute to score up to 2 points in the LEED v4.1 credit &#x27;Sourcing of Raw Materials&#x27;. In addition, FSC certified wood products can contribute to score up to 1 point in the LEED v4.1 pilot credit &#x27;Social Equity within the Supply Chain&#x27;. BREEAM awards credits for FSC certified wood products in the Mat 03 credit. The BREEAM Guidance Note GN18 attributes different scores to FSC 100% (7 points) and FSC MIX / FSC RECYCLED (5 points). DGNB recognizes FSC certified wood products in the ENV1.3 credit. FSC Mix scores in the Quality Level 1.2 (up to 25 out of 100 points) and FSC 100 / FSC RECYCLED score in the Quality Level 1.3 (up to 70 out of 100 points. FSC RECYCLED also scores points in the Quality Level 2.2.

=== Competing certification schemes ===
There are a number of certification schemes for forest management apart from FSC certification.

The main competing forest certification system is the Programme for the Endorsement of Forest Certification (PEFC), established by a number of stakeholders, including associations of the forest industry, pulp-and-paper production and forest owners in response to the creation and increasing popularity of FSC. PEFC has been criticized for having little influence from local people or environmental organizations, lack of transparency and non-objective requirements.

Other certification schemes include the Sustainable Forestry Initiative (SFI), the Malaysian Timber Certification Council, the Australian Forestry Standard, and Keurhout.

== Criticism ==

Since it was founded, FSC has been criticized for a range of different reasons.

=== Concerns by founding NGOs and members ===
In the late 2000s, a number of NGOs and environmental organizations withdrew their support for FSC. These included FERN (2011), Friends of the Earth UK (2008), ROBINWOOD (2009), the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation (SSNC) (2011), and smaller groups such as Rainforest Rescue and the Association for the Ecological Defence of Galicia (ADEGA).

In this same period other NGO members and commenters issued critical evaluations of FSC&#x27;s performance and made recommendations to improve the credibility of the organization. Greenpeace International published a 2008 report &quot;Holding the line with FSC&quot; focused on controversial certificates and ways forward.

FSC was also harshly criticized by Simon Counsell, one of its founding members, later the director of the Rainforest Foundation. In 2008, he described the FSC as the &quot;Enron of Forestry&quot;. He cited case studies from six countries which suggested that in these cases FSC was not properly controlling accredited auditors or certifiers. The FSC reviewed the certificates in question, and showed that some of the initial investigations were justified. This resulted in the removal of the license to certify from the Thai company, Forest Industry Organization.

FSC-Watch is a website critical of FSC which is run by a group of people, including Simon Counsell, who are concerned about what they perceive as the constant and serious erosion of the FSC&#x27;s reliability and credibility. Its website offers a wide range of extensive and detailed criticisms of FSC. FSC-Watch commonly accuses FSC of practices that are a form of greenwashing.

In 2008, the EcoEarth/Rainforest Portal, an Internet ecological news aggregation service, publicly questioned the FSC-endorsed policy of old-growth forest logging. They asserted that research does not support the idea that this type of logging is carbon positive or sustainable, though these views are disputed.

In 2011, Greenpeace International issued a revised version of their report, which concluded that some progress had been made. But it also identified ongoing weaknesses, including a lack of guidance on high conservation value forests (HCVFs), activities in controversial areas like the Congo Basin, problems with the Controlled Wood label, and the integrity of the Chain of Custody system and logo. In 2018, Greenpeace International chose not to renew its membership with FSC, claiming that FSC is not meeting its goals of protecting forests and human rights.

=== Violation of indigenous rights and sovereignty ===
The world&#x27;s largest manager of FSC certified forests, Resolute Forest Products, has been accused of illegal logging on Barriere Lake Algonquin territory and of violating indigenous rights. In July 2012, members of the Algonquin community in southern Quebec staged a camp to observe and deter the logging of their unceded territory. The firm stated that their &quot;right to harvest in the area [had] been approved by the QMNRW, following appropriate consultation with the Barrière Lake Algonquin band council.&quot;

In 2018 FSC investigated allegations made by local tribesmen in Papua against FSC certificate holder Korindo Group. The investigation found Korindo to have violated the rights of the Papuan indigenous peoples and benefited from close ties with the Indonesian military for its own economic benefit. While the report recommended stripping Korindo of it FSC certificate, FSC chose not to publicly release the report and continued its collaboration with Korindo. In August 2021, FSC announced its decision of disassociation from the Korindo Group which came into effect on 16 October 2021.

=== Preference for bigger companies ===
Some critics argue that FSC certification is not suited for small businesses, that it is anti-competitive and that it is counter-ecological. It has been argued that only large businesses with rigid structures can afford the process of assessment and maintenance of the schemes, with certification schemes being anti-competitive because they favor larger firms over smaller ones. FSC has thus been criticised for promoting a counter-ecological model of a few massive suppliers owing to a bias towards large companies.

Partly in response to these criticisms, to make certification more accessible to small and medium-sized businesses, FSC instituted the Small and Low Intensity Managed Forests (SLIMF) initiative and group certification. SLIMF adapts the FSC system by offering special streamlined procedures with less rigorous requirements for a number of its forest management criteria. SLIMF are defined as forests of 100 hectares or less. Group certification allows a group of forest owners to share certification costs. In October 2012, worldwide, 8.7% of FSC certificates were held by community-owned forests.

=== Responses by FSC ===
Complainants to FSC must meet a number of conditions to be able to file complaints, and it is disputed whether the FSC takes effective action even in the case of some formal complaints.

FSC has implemented actions to strengthen its stakeholder engagement process. In 2013, it established a Quality Assurance Unit within FSC. To improve its process for tracking FSC certified products, FSC launched an online claims platform in 2014. This platform is intended to enable streamlined verification of specific transactions. In 2014, FSC also published dispute resolution procedures to process complaints against the certification scheme.

== Non-state market driven environmental governance ==

Because it works outside of state regulations, some academics have classified FSC as an example of a non-state market driven (NSMD) form of environmental governance. This means that it uses the market to drive the sustainable management of forests. As Cashore observes, the FSC network does not have the political authority of a traditional nation state and no one can be fined or imprisoned for failing to comply with its regulations. In addition, governments are forbidden from being members of the FSC and their only engagement with FSC is as land owners. The authority of the FSC is determined by the approval of external audiences, such as environmental NGOs.

The FSC Label is an example of the use of public purchasing power to create shifts in industry and regulate the negative environmental impacts of deforestation. The FSC Label &quot;works&quot; by providing an incentive for responsible forestry in the market place. It offers manufacturers a competitive advantage and thereby increases market access to new markets and maintains access to existing ones.

Non-state market-driven methods are often used because of allegations of &#x27;state failure&#x27; in managing the environment. In the neoliberal view, market based methods are seen as one of the most effective and efficient ways to meet environmental goals. The market is seen as the key mechanism for producing the maximum social good and governance networks are seen as the most efficient way to regulate environmental concerns.

The FSC transnational NGO network demonstrates theories of global governance, more specifically in governance network theory. FSC is an example of how network governance can create change in industry and encourage organizations to improve the sustainability of industrial forestry practices. As Bäckstrand states, the FSC governance network brings together private companies, organizations and civil society in a non-hierarchical fashion, to voluntarily address certain goals. According to governance network theory, actors in the network are dependent on each other and collaborate to reach specific goals, through exchanging information or resources.

Through the chamber system, governance of FSC has checks at local, national and international levels which mean that it includes interests regardless of their geographical location. This gives FSC some advantages over state governance systems. In theory, as a governance network, FSC members share knowledge, environmental goals and knowledge of what those goals entail. This means that they coordinate effectively, improving the process and outcomes of the environmental policies they pursue. Moreover, knowledge sharing and collaboration enables the FSC network to deal with complex and interrelated issues.

Some critiques however suggest that network governance does not always work this way. Network governance theory suggests that partnerships should be equal, but inequalities of power within networks can result in hierarchical relationships determined by more dominant actors. Within FSC, larger international actors may have a stronger influence than smaller stakeholders, meaning that the FSC governance network may not represent all participants fairly. FSC has instituted the chamber system to try to tackle this imbalance.

Furthermore, actors in networks operate as representatives of certain groups but also as individuals with their own agendas and values, and members in the FSC network are usually motivated by pragmatic rather than moral considerations. Moreover, Sorenson and Torfing (2005) argue that for governance networks to achieve their goals they should be controlled by democratically elected politicians. Although formerly there were no elections in the FSC governance system, reforms mean that the board of directors is now democratically elected by the membership chambers.

<text>George Robert Waterhouse (6 March 1810 – 21 January 1888) was an English naturalist. He was a keeper at the department of geology and later curator of the Zoological Society of London&#x27;s museum.

==Early life==
George was born in Somers Town to James Edward Waterhouse and Mary Newman. His father was a solicitor&#x27;s clerk and an amateur entomologist. He was the brother of Frederick George Waterhouse, who also became a zoologist. George went to school at Koekelberg, near Brussels. He returned to England in 1824 and worked as an apprentice to an architect. Part of the work was in designing the garden of Charles Knight in the Vale of Health, Hampstead and the ornamentation for St. Dunstan&#x27;s Church.

==Natural history==

George became interested in entomology through his father and he founded the Entomological Society of London along with Frederick William Hope in 1833 with himself as honorary curator. He became its president in 1849–50. He wrote articles for Knight&#x27;s &quot;Penny Cyclopædia.&quot; The Royal Institution at Liverpool appointed him curator of its museum in 1835 and he exchanged this in 1836 for a position at the Zoological Society of London. His early work was on cataloguing the mammals at the museum and although he completed the work the next year, it was not published as he had not followed the quinary system of that time.

He was invited to join Charles Darwin on the voyage of the Beagle but he declined it. On Darwin&#x27;s return, the collection of mammals and beetles was entrusted to him. In November 1843 he became an assistant in the mineralogical department of the British Museum of Natural History. He became keeper in 1851 upon the death of Charles Konig and held the position until his retirement in 1880.

He was married to Elizabeth Ann, daughter of musician G. L. J. Griesbach of Windsor, on 21 December 1834. One of their daughters married the entomologist and writer Edward Caldwell Rye. He died at Putney on 21 January 1888.

He had three sons (Charles Owen Waterhouse, Frederick Herschel Waterhouse, and Edward Alexander Waterhouse), all coleopterists, and three daughters.

Waterhouse was the author of &quot;A natural history of the Mammalia&quot; (1846–48). The work was begun in 1844 was done slowly as the original French publisher M. Hippolyte Baillière was unable to take it up. The two volumes covered the Marsupials and the rodents. The famous &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; specimen was acquired when he was curator. Amongst the numerous species he described are the numbat (&quot;Myrmecobius fasciatus&quot;), and the Syrian or golden hamster (&quot;Mesocricetus auratus&quot;). He also assisted Louis Agassiz with his &quot;Nomenclator Zoologicus&quot; (1842).

<doc id="868056" wikidata="Q489523" url="?curid=868056" title="Earthquake swarm">
<text>In seismology, an earthquake swarm is a sequence of seismic events occurring in a local area within a relatively short period. The time span used to define a swarm varies, but may be days, months, or years. Such an energy release is different from the situation when a major earthquake (main shock) is followed by a series of aftershocks: in earthquake swarms, no single earthquake in the sequence is obviously the main shock. In particular, a cluster of aftershocks occurring after a mainshock &quot;is not&quot; a swarm.

== History and generalities ==
The Ore Mountains (Erzgebirge), which form the border between the Czech Republic and Germany, western Bohemia and the Vogtland region, have been known since the 16th century as being prone to frequent earthquake swarms, which typically last a few weeks to a few months. In 1899, Austrian geologist Josef Knett, while studying a swarm of about a hundred events felt in western Bohemia/Vogtland between January and February 1824, coined the noun &quot;Schwarmbeben&quot;, i.e. &quot;swarm [earth]quake&quot;. The term &quot;swarm&quot; comes from the fact that hypocentres give the impression of agglutinating like a bee swarm when plotted onto a map, a cross-section or a 3D model.

One of the best-documented swarms occurred near Matsushiro, a suburb of Nagano, to the north-west of Tokyo. The Matsushiro swarm lasted from 1965 to 1967 and generated about 1 million earthquakes. This swarm had the peculiarity of being sited just under a seismological observatory installed in 1947 in a decommissioned military tunnel. It began in August 1965 with three earthquakes too weak to be felt, but three months later, a hundred earthquakes could be felt daily. On 17 April 1966, the observatory counted 6,780 earthquakes, with 585 of them having a magnitude great enough to be felt, which means that an earthquake could be felt, on average, every two and a half minutes. The phenomenon was clearly identified as linked to a magma uplift, perhaps initiated by the 1964 Niigata earthquake, which occurred the previous year.

Earthquake swarms are common in volcanic regions such as Japan, Central Italy, the Afar depression or Iceland, where they occur before and during eruptions, but they are also observed in zones of Quaternary volcanism or of hydrothermal circulation, such as Vogtland/western Bohemia and the Vosges massif, and less frequently far from tectonic plate boundaries in locations such as Nevada, Oklahoma or Scotland. In all cases, high-pressure fluid migration in the Earth&#x27;s crust seems to be the trigger mechanism and the driving process that govern the evolution of the swarm in space and time.
The Hochstaufen earthquake swarm in Bavaria, with 2-km-deep foci, is one of the rare examples where an indisputable relationship between seismic activity and precipitation could be established.

Earthquake swarms raise public-safety issues: first, because the end of seismic activity cannot be predicted; second, because it is uncertain whether another earthquake with a magnitude larger than those of previous shocks in the sequence will occur (the 2009 L&#x27;Aquila earthquake in Italy illustrates this, with an &quot;M&quot;W 6.3 shock following a swarm activity with magnitudes between 1 and 3). Even though swarms usually generate moderate shocks, the persistence of felt earthquakes can be disruptive and cause distress to the population.

== Examples ==
The following examples were chosen for peculiarities of certain swarms (for instance: large number of events, complex interaction with larger shocks, long period of time, ultra-shallow focal depth), or because of their geographical region, some swarms occurring in otherwise aseismic regions. It is not intended to be a list of all the swarms happening worldwide.

=== Asia ===

==== India ====
* Since 11 November 2018, an earthquake swarm has been observed in the region of Dahanu, Maharashtra, an otherwise aseismic area. Ten to twenty quakes are felt daily, with magnitudes usually smaller than 3.5 (maximum magnitude 4.1 in February 2019). Even with this low-level of magnitude, two shocks proved destructive and even lethal, probably because their foci were very shallow.
* Bamhori village in Seoni district is also experiencing regular earthquakes since February 2000.

==== Philippines ====
* An earthquake swarm occurred from early April 2017 to mid August 2017 in the province of Batangas. Four shocks in the 5.5–6.3 magnitude range (2017 Batangas earthquakes) caused damage in southern Luzon; they occurred at the beginning of the swarm: &quot;M&quot;s5.5 (4 April), &quot;M&quot;s5.6 and &quot;M&quot;s6.0 (8 April), and &quot;M&quot;s6.3 (11 April). The origin of the 3 first major quakes seems established since they had practically the same epicentre; they occurred within the crust (7–28-km depth range). However, the strongest and latest quake does not seem related to the swarm: its epicentre is 50 km away, and its focal depth is moreover very different (177 km, according to Phivolcs, the local seismic monitoring agency, a value which classifies this quake as an &quot;intermediate-depth event&quot;). This example shows how complex can be the interaction between a swarm and an independent earthquake, even though this last one is very likely to have been triggered by the swarm activity.
* October 15, 2020, an earthquake swarm occurred on the island of Panay ranging from magnitudes 2.5-4.5. Most of these quakes felt in Iloilo City. A previous swarm also hit Panay on November 5, 2018 (Including Antique, Iloilo and Guimaras) ranging from magnitudes 4.0-4.8. The first earthquake (magnitude 4.7) at 7:45 A.M, occurred at San Jose, Antique. Just a few minutes after, the second quake (magnitude 4.0) occurred at Sibunag, Guimaras. At 10:54 A.M, The third quake (magnitude 4.8) occurred at Guimbal, Iloilo. Intensity 4 was felt in Iloilo City
* A series of earthquakes that hit Mindanao in 2019 were classified as an earthquake swarm.&lt;br&gt;On October 16, a magnitude 6.3 (Mwp) Struck Tulunan cotabato (Epicenter of earthquake). Intensity VII was felt in Tulunan, M&#x27;lang, Makilala and Kidapawan City, Cotabato. Intensity VI was felt in Digos City, Davao del Sur; Santo Niño, South Cotabato and Tacurong City, Sultan Kudarat. On October 29, a magnitude 6.6 (Mww) struck Tulunan again. At least ten deaths were reported and four hundred individuals were injured. Intensity VII was recorded in Tulunan and Makilala; Kidapawan City; Digos City, Bansalan and Magsaysay, Davao del Sur and Malungon, Sarangani. Intensity VI was recorded in Koronadal City and Davao City. Just 2 days after on October 31, an earthquake struck Tulunan again (Magnitude 6.5Mww) The death toll of two quakes was raised into 24 and 563 were injured. Eva&#x27;s Hotel in Kidapawan City collapsed during the quake
* On October 14-18 2021 an earthquake swarm occurred on Camarines Sur ranging from magnitudes 1.7-4.3 with the depth of 1–40 km. Some of these events were felt on Camarines Norte and Albay. PHIVOLCS recorded at least 27 earthquakes (10 were felt) in Camarines Sur.

=== Europe ===

==== Iceland ====

* A swarm of intense earthquakes in the Reykjanes Peninsula, Iceland began on 24 October 2023, due to a magmatic intrusion underneath the area. The frequency and intensity of the earthquakes dramatically increased 10 November, with 20,000 tremors recorded by that time, the largest of which exceeded magnitude 5.2. An evacuation was ordered in the town of Grindavík, which is located near the area of the seismic activity. Large-scale subsidence in and around the town is reported to have caused significant damage.An earthquake swarm began on the evening of 24 October due to the magmatic intrusion, with the intensity of the earthquakes decreasing by 30 October. Approximately 8,000 earthquakes were detected; most of these tremors occurred at a depth of 2–4 km. The Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) reported that the swarm was focused around Svartsengi, north of Grindavík. About 700 earthquakes were recorded earlier in the month, the largest reaching magnitude 3.3.The largest of the earthquakes to date reached magnitude 5.1 on 10 November. By this time, over 22,000 earthquakes had been recorded since the beginning of the swarm in October. The IMO predicted that an eruption was likely, stating that &quot;it will take several days (rather than hours) for magma to reach the surface.&quot; The greatest extent of the magma intrusion was inferred to be around the Sundhnúkur crater chain, approximately 3.5 km north of Grindavík. Instruments detected the presence of sulphur dioxide in the atmosphere on 14 November, indicating that magma was now only a few hundred metres under the surface. Although the number of earthquakes decreased somewhat since 10 November, the IMO was still recording between 700 and 1,000 earthquakes daily by 14 November. Ground deformation sensors at Festarfjall and Svartsengi recorded that the ground had moved apart by 120 centimetres. Satellite measurements recorded the subsidence by about one metre of a swathe of land measuring approximately five kilometers long and two kilometers wide, running from the Sundhnúkur craters to the western side of Grindavík. The creation of this graben-like formation has enabled scientists to estimate the volume of the magmatic intrusion as approximately 70 million cubic metres. It is estimated that the subsidence has been continuing at a rate of about four centimeters (1.6 inches) a day. A large crack opened up through the town, which old maps indicate is a reactivation of an existing fault. Scientists at the University of Iceland believe that the fault was created by the last Sundhnúkur eruption over 2,000 years ago. Sensors emplaced in a borehole in Svartsengi detected the presence of sulphur dioxide on 16 November, a classic signature of magma close to the surface. This has led the IMO to conclude that the area around the volcanic edifice of Hagafell, approximately 2 km north of Grindavík, is at the highest level of risk. A rapid 30 mm uplift of the ground in the Svartsengi area was recorded from 18 to 21 November, likely indicating an upwelling of magma from a source five or more kilometers below the ground. An eruption started on 18 December 2023 and eruptions lasted until December 2024.

==== Czech Republic / Germany ====
* The western Bohemia/Vogtland region is the border area between the Czech Republic and Germany where earthquake swarms were first studied at the end of the 19th century. Swarm activity is recurrent there, sometimes with large maximum magnitudes, as for instance in 1908 (maximum magnitude 5.0), 1985–1986 (4.6), 2000 (3.2), or 2008 (3.8). This latter swarm occurred near Nový Kostel in October 2008 and lasted only 4 weeks, but up to 25,000 events were detected by WEBNET, the local monitoring network. The swarm is located on a steeply-dipping fault plane where an overall upward migration of activity was observed (first events at the bottom and last events at the top of the activated fault patch).

==== France====

* In Alpes-de-Haute-Provence, the Ubaye Valley is the most active seismic zone in the French Alps. Earthquakes can follow there the classical scheme &quot;mainshock + aftershocks&quot; (for instance the 1959 &quot;M&quot;5.5 earthquake, which caused heavy damage and two casualties). But seismic energy is principally released by swarms. This is particularly the case in the upper valley, between Barcelonnette and the French-Italian border. At the beginning of the 21st century, La Condamine-Châtelard experienced an exceptional swarm activity in an area where usually only a few low-magnitude events occur every year. A first swarm developed in 2003–2004 when more than 16,000 events were detected by the local monitoring network, but with magnitudes keeping to low values (2.7). On a map, the 2003–2004 swarm is 8-km long. After a period of almost complete inactivity, it was followed by a second swarm (2012–2014), slightly offset by a few kilometres, and with a length of 11 km. This second swarm was initiated by an &quot;M&quot;4.3 earthquake in February 2012. Another &quot;M&quot;4.8 earthquake in April 2014 reactivated the swarm in 2014–2015. These two major shocks, which caused damage in the nearby localities, were of course followed by their own short sequence of aftershocks, but such a 4-year activity for moderate magnitude shocks clearly characterizes a swarm. Most foci were located in the 4–11-km depth range, within the crystalline basement. Focal mechanisms involve normal faulting, but also strike-slip faulting.
* In the lower Rhône Valley, the Tricastin has been known from the 18th century as the seat of earthquake swarms which sometimes caused damage, as in 1772–1773 and 1933–1936, and which were characterized by barrage-like detonations—at least so reported by the inhabitants. No seismic activity had been documented in the region since 1936, when a very weak swarm appeared for a few months in 2002–2003 (maximal magnitude 1.7). Had their foci not been sited just under a hamlet in the vicinity of Clansayes, and very close to the surface (200 m deep), these shocks would have gone unnoticed. In such a scenario of &quot;ultra-shallow&quot; seismicity, even earthquakes of very low magnitude (1, or 0, or even negative magnitude) can be felt as explosions or water-hammer noises, more than as vibrations. Most foci were located in an Upper-Cretaceous reef-limestone slab which bursts out periodically in the course of centuries for still unknown reasons for a few months or a few years. A 200-m focal depth is believed to be a worldwide record value for tectonic events.
* In the French Alps, the Maurienne Valley is from time to time prone to earthquake swarms. During the 19th century, a protracted swarm lasted 5 years and a half, from December 1838 to June 1844. Some earthquakes of the sequence caused damage in the region close to Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne, but this long swarm with many felt events made things particularly difficult for the population. More recently, a swarm appeared in October 2015 near Montgellafrey, in the lower part of the valley. Its activity kept low until 17 October 2017, when more than 300 earthquakes occurred within two weeks, with a maximal magnitude of 3.7 being reached twice in late October 2017. The seismic activity lasted another full year, thus yielding a duration of more than 3 years for the full swarm.

====Greece====
Since January 26, 2025, intense seismic activity has been observed between Amorgos and Santorini, centered on Anydros. Specifically, over 7,700 earthquakes of which around 100 exceeded magnitude 4 on the Richter scale have been observed, with the largest earthquake being 5.2R on the evening of February 5.

=== Central America ===
==== El Salvador ====
* In April 2017, the Salvadoran municipality of Antiguo Cuscatlán, a suburb of San Salvador, experienced a sequence of close to 500 earthquakes within 2 days, with magnitudes in the 1.5–5.1 range. There was one casualty and minor damage due to the strongest quake. Local experts did not identify any anomalous activity at nearby volcanoes.

=== North America ===
==== United States ====
* Between February and November 2008, Nevada experienced a swarm of 1,000 low-magnitude quakes generally referred to as the 2008 Reno earthquakes. The peak activity was in April 2008, when 3 quakes with magnitudes larger than 4 occurred within 2 days. The largest one registered a moment magnitude of 4.9 and caused damage in the immediate area around the epicenter.
* The Yellowstone Caldera, a supervolcano in NW Wyoming, has experienced several strong earthquake swarms since the end of the 20th century. In 1985, more than 3,000 earthquakes were observed over a period of several months. More than 70 smaller swarms have been detected since. The United States Geological Survey states these swarms are likely caused by slips on pre-existing faults rather than by movements of magma or hydrothermal fluids. At the turn of the year 2008, more than 500 quakes were detected under the NW end of Yellowstone Lake over a seven-day span, with the largest registering a magnitude of 3.9. Another swarm started in January 2010, after the Haiti earthquake. With 1,620 small events in late January 2010, this swarm is the second-largest ever recorded in the Yellowstone Caldera. Interestingly, most of these swarms have &quot;rapid-fire&quot; characteristics: they seemingly appear out of nowhere and can churn out tens or hundreds of small to moderate quakes within a very short time frame. Such swarms usually occur within the caldera boundary, as was especially the case in 2018.

* The Guy–Greenbrier earthquake swarm occurred in central Arkansas beginning in August 2010. Epicentres show a linear distribution, with a clear overall shift in activity towards the southwest with time, and a magnitude of 4.7 was computed for the largest event. Analysis of the swarm has suggested a link with deep waste disposal drilling. It has led to a moratorium on such drilling.
* On 2 September 2017, an earthquake swarm appeared around Soda Springs, Idaho. Five quakes with magnitudes between 4.6 and 5.3 occurred within 9 days. Keeping the 2009 L&#x27;Aquila case in mind, and because Idaho had experienced an &quot;M&quot;6.9 earthquake in 1983, experts warned residents that a stronger quake could follow (an unlikely but still possible scenario for them).
* From early 2016 to late 2019, a swarm of earthquakes occurred near Cahuilla in Riverside County, California. More than 22,000 individual seismic events were recorded, ranging in magnitude from 0.7 to 4.4. The strongest one occurred in August 2018, south of Lake Riverside, just off Cahuilla Road (SR 371). By using computer algorithms and machine learning, researchers were able to infer the following detailed picture of the Cahuilla fault zone responsible for the earthquake swarm. The fault zone is no more than wide, long, with the earliest seismic swarm events localized down near its base at below the surface and the latest events migrating upwards to below the surface and spreading throughout the fault zone&#x27;s length. Containing complex subterranean horizontal channels and prominent bents in its depth profile, the fault zone sits on top of a deeper natural underground reservoir of fluid under pressure with a connector at below the surface that was initially sealed off from the fault zone. When that seal broke open in early 2016, fluids were injected up into the fault zone&#x27;s base and diffused slowly through the complex channels up to below the surface, which triggered the prolonged earthquake swarm that lasted until late 2019. This analysis provides detailed evidence that fault zone valving is a mechanism for seismogenesis in swarms.

=== Atlantic Ocean ===
* In El Hierro, the smallest and farthest south and west of the Canary Islands, hundreds of small earthquakes were recorded from July 2011 until October 2011 during the 2011–12 El Hierro eruption. The accumulated energy released by the swarm increased dramatically on 28 September. The swarm was due to the movement of magma beneath the island, and on 9 October a submarine volcanic eruption was detected.

=== Indian Ocean ===
* An earthquake swarm began east of Mayotte on 10 May 2018. The strongest quake (&quot;M&quot;5.9), the largest-magnitude event ever recorded in the Comoro zone, struck on 15 May 2018. The swarm includes thousands of quakes, many of them felt by Maorais residents. Temporarily-installed ocean-bottom seismometers showed that the swarm active zone was sited 10 km east of Mayotte, deep into the oceanic lithosphere (in the 20–50-km depth range), a rather surprising result because the swarm was believed to be caused by the deflation of a magma reservoir located 45 km east of Mayotte, at a depth of 28 km. (Accordingly, an oceanographic campaign discovered in May 2019 a new submarine volcano, 800-m high and located 50 km east of Mayotte.) The swarm had been tapering off between August and November 2018 when the 11-November-2018 event occurred. This event had no detectable P nor S waves, but generated surface waves which could be observed worldwide by seismological observatories. Its origin is thought to be east of Mayotte. The swarm continued to be active all through 2019.

=== Pacific Ocean ===
* In January and February 2013, the Santa Cruz Islands experienced a large earthquake swarm with many magnitude 5 and 6 earthquakes: more than 40 quakes with magnitude 4.5 or larger took place during the previous 7 days, including 7 events with magnitude larger than 6. The swarm degenerated into the M8.0 2013 Solomon Islands earthquake (6 February 2013).

<text>Route 24 is a freeway south of Interstate 93 (I-93) in southeastern Massachusetts, linking Fall River with the Boston metropolitan area. It begins in the south in Fall River at the border with Tiverton, Rhode Island, and runs north to an interchange with I-93/US 1 in Randolph. Route 24 is also known as the Fall River Expressway, and officially as the Amvets Highway. Route 24 has a total of 21 interchanges (including the split at its northern terminus with I-93.)

Route 24 connects many of the major cities of Southeastern Massachusetts with Boston and Providence: Brockton, Taunton, Fall River, and New Bedford (via the junction with Route 140).

==Route description==
The highway continues at the Rhode Island border at Rhode Island Route 24 and meets Interstate 195 in Fall River. It briefly runs concurrently with I-195 east (for less than a mile), then exits the interstate and travels north, merging with Route 79 at Exit 7 in northern Fall River. Routes 24 and 79 run concurrently northward until Exit 9 (Assonet). At this point, Route 79 exits the freeway and heads northeast. Route 24 continues north, intersecting the northern end of the Taunton-New Bedford Expressway (Route 140) in Taunton, and Interstate 495 in Bridgewater. The highway continues north through the city of Brockton and into Randolph, where Route 24 ends at a split junction with Interstate 93. This section of I-93 from Braintree to its junction with I-95 is frequently, yet erroneously, referred to by its former designation of Route 128. This designation was removed from I-93 in 1989, when the roadway obtained the additional designation of U.S. Route 1, although this is not shown on exit signs from Route 24. The route is officially 40.9 miles in length, however, mileposts continue up to 41.2 on the Exit 21B ramp to I-93 south.

The speed limit on Route 24 is from the Rhode Island border to the exit from Interstate 195. North of I-195, the speed limit is , excluding a short drop to at the 79 merge northbound.

Service plazas are located on either side of Route 24 in Bridgewater.

==History==
Route 24, along with Route 138, are both built parallel to an old Native American trail that went along the same north/south route from south of the Boston area into Boston. Route 124 on Cape Cod was originally designated Route 24 before 1951, and its number was changed to 124 upon the completion of the initial stretch of the Route 24 freeway.

The original portion of Route 24 opened in 1951, and brought commuters from Exit 10 in Assonet to Raynham. Route 24 is currently 40 miles (65 km) in length and has 21 interchanges from Fall River to Randolph.

==Efforts to upgrade to Interstate standards==
There have been calls over the years for Route 24 to be upgraded to an interstate highway. In 1997, a study was initiated by the Massachusetts Highway Department (MHD) and the SRPEDD on what improvements were necessary in order to convert the route to an Interstate highway. The project would require major upgrades to 11 interchanges and minor work on 6 others, and the plan was halted due to high costs. In April 2007 the Old Colony Regional Planning Council included this proposal in its 25-year regional transportation plan draft. The Southeastern Regional Planning and Economic Development District (SRPEDD) endorsed a similar proposal the month before which if built, according to a MassHighway official, would have been signed as an extension of I-93. The portion south of I-195 would have remained MA-24 and then RI-24. This proposal too was eventually tabled due to high costs, especially those projected for reconstruction of part of the highway south of Interstate 495. Here were the early cost estimates for the Interstate upgrade project: Phase I: Randolph I-93 Interchange Reconstruction ($30 million), Phase II: Randolph to Stoughton ($56 million), Phase III: Canton to Bridgewater ($224 million), Phase IV: Bridgewater to I-495 ($175 million), Phase V: I-495 to US 44 ($35 million), and Phase VI: US 44 to Fall River ($357 million). The total cost was expected to be $877 million. There are currently no proposals in the MassDOT highway listings to upgrade MA 24 to an interstate. The only projects that may relate to this happening in the future are reconstruction of three bridges starting in 2015, which include the one for US 44 in Raynham.

==Exit list==
All interchanges were to be renumbered to mileage-based numbers under a project scheduled to start in 2016. However, this project was indefinitely postponed by MassDOT until November 18, 2019, when MassDOT confirmed that beginning in late summer 2020 the exit renumbering project will begin. Renumbering the exits along this highway started on January 6, 2021, and it was completed on January 19.

<text>In Finnish mythology, Ahti () is a heroic character in folk poetry who is sometimes given the epithet Saarelainen (, &quot;Islander&quot;).

Ahto is a Finnish sea god. Ahti is the more common name for Ahto, but Ahto is used in the Finnish epic Kalevala as to avoid confusion with Ahti Saarelainen, the hero. 

==Description==
===Ahti===

In the Kalevala the compiler Elias Lönnrot conflated several mythological persons into the main characters in an attempt to create a consistent narrative from several songs. The heroic figures &quot;Kaukomieli&quot; and &quot;Ahti&quot; were condensed into &quot;Lemminkäinen&quot; in the work. Ahti&#x27;s story is of a man so eager to fight that he abandons his young wife and sets out on an adventure with his friend &quot;&quot;. The original songs in the Ahti cycle have been tentatively dated to the Viking Age because of their references to sea voyages, but Oinas also sees an adventurous element in both Ahti and Kaukamoinen&#x27;s tales.

&quot;Ahti Saarelainen&quot; is described as a fierce seagoing warrior. He makes a double vow with his wife &quot;Kyllikki&quot;, binding him to stay at home and not to engage in raiding, and binding her to stay faithful. However, Kyllikki breaks her oath and Ahti goes on a voyage with his old war companions. 

In the Kalevala, Ahti is mentioned (as a synonym of Lemminkäinen) in Rune IX, where his close association with the sea is made clear; in this verse his marriage to Kyllikki, and their vows, are described. Rune XII describes Kyllikki&#x27;s breaking of her vow. In Rune XX Ahti is briefly mentioned, and the conflation with Lemminkainen and Kaukomiele is made explicit.

Ahti is also mentioned in Rune XXVI, in Rune XXVIII he is called &quot;Ahti, hero of the Islands&quot;, and in Rune XXX he is again identified with Lemminkainen. A pattern of association of the name &quot;Ahti&quot; with islands and seafaring is found in Runes XX, XXVI, XXVII, XXVIII, and other runes.

===Ahto===
&quot;Ahto&quot; is the name of the king or god of the sea, and &quot;Ahtola&quot; is his sea-castle. His wife is &quot;Wellamo&quot;, and they live together at the bottom of the sea. The &quot;Sampo&quot; comes into his possession and he is unwilling to return it.

In the Kalevala, &quot;Ahto&quot; appears in Rune XLI; in Rune XLII, where &quot;Väinämöinen&quot; charms him with his magic harp playing; in Rune XLIII, where the &quot;Sampo&quot; is lost in the sea; and in Rune XLVIII, where he is briefly mentioned.

In a fable similar to Mercury and the Woodman, Ahto dives to return the lost knife of a shepherd, out of pity. He first finds a gold knife, and then a silver knife, but the shepherd does not claim them as his. The third knife Ahto retrieves is the correct one; as a reward for his honesty, Ahto gives the shepherd all three.

<text>The aigamuxa (a.k.a. &#x27;Bushmen&#x27;) are legendary creatures of the Khoikhoi people. Its main diet is humans, which it regards as zebras, and eats with its extremely elongated teeth. The bushmen are said to target lone desert travelers at night. The monster is said to have eyes on its feet, meaning that it cannot see the humans it preys upon as it hunts. In order to see, it must stand on its hands or head, or lie in the sand. Tales of the aigamuxa were notably collected from the Khoikhoi people by Leonhard Schultze-Jena for his book &quot;Aus Namaland und Kalahari&quot;.

<text>An adventure is a playable scenario in a tabletop role-playing game. These can be constructed by gamemasters for their players, and are also released by game publishers as pre-made adventure modules. Different types of designs exist, including linear adventures, where players move between scenes in a predetermined order; non-linear adventures, where scenes can go in multiple directions; and solo adventures, which are played alone, without a game group.

==Overview==
An adventure is a playable scenario in a tabletop role-playing game which a gamemaster leads the players and their characters through. Various types of designs exist, including linear adventures, where players need to progress through each predetermined scene in turn; and non-linear adventures, where each situation can lead in multiple directions. The former is more restrictive, but is easier to manage, whereas the latter is more open-ended but more demanding for the gamemaster. A series of adventures played in succession are collectively called a campaign. Adventures meant to be played alone, without a game group, are called solo adventures.

Adventures can be created by gamemasters, but are also released by game publishers in the form of modular, supplementary books for role-playing games, sometimes combined with additional game mechanics or background information on the game&#x27;s setting. Pre-written adventure modules have the advantage of being easier to run for new gamemasters, especially linear ones. Still, it is most common for groups to play adventures they have made up themselves, and even when playing published adventures, it is common for alterations to be made.

==History==
Published adventure modules began in 1975 with Dave Arneson&#x27;s &quot;The Temple of the Frog&quot;, released for the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; setting Blackmoor, and have since then become commonplace in the role-playing game industry; White Wolf Publishing, a major role-playing game publisher in the 1990s and 2000s, stood out by rarely publishing adventure modules, preferring to let gamemasters construct their own adventures. Solo adventures rose in popularity in 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic preventing people from playing role-playing games together in person.

&quot;Aji&quot; (O.J. &quot;adi&quot;) may mean either &quot;excellent&quot; (cf. &quot;aji&quot; &quot;taste, flavor&quot;) or &quot;flock, mass, many&quot;, while &quot;shiki&quot; (O.J. &quot;siki2&quot;) is variously interpreted either as a corruption of &quot;suki&quot; (O.J. &quot;suki1&quot;, &quot;spade&quot; or &quot;plough&quot;), a derivation from the Baekje word &quot;suki&quot; &quot;village&quot;, a word meaning &quot;blade&quot;, or a place name in Yamato Province. (One factor that complicates a proper interpretation of the name is that &quot;ki1&quot; and &quot;ki2&quot; are thought to be different syllables in Old Japanese.)

Basil Hall Chamberlain, in his 1882 translation of the &quot;Kojiki&quot;, left the name untranslated (noting that &quot;[t]he meaning of the first two members of this compound name is altogether obscure&quot;); likewise, William George Aston (1896) merely commented that there is &quot;no satisfactory explanation of this name.&quot; Donald Philippi (1968) proposed two possible interpretations of the name: &quot;Massed-Ploughs High-Princeling Deity&quot; or &quot;Excellent Shiki High-Princeling Deity&quot; (with &#x27;Shiki&#x27; being understood here to be a toponym). Gustav Heldt&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Kojiki&quot; (2014) meanwhile renders the name as &quot;Lofty Little Lad of Fine Plows&quot;.

==Mythology==
===Parentage===
The &quot;Kojiki&quot; describes Ajisukitakahikone as one of the two children of the god Ōkuninushi by Takiribime, one of the three Munakata goddesses, the other being (also known as Takahime).

He is frequently portrayed as a baby who is unable to sleep. His mother carried him up and down a ladder in an attempt to make him sleep, this is what causes the sound of growing thunder. In infancy, his crying and screaming were so loud that he had to be placed in a boat and sailed around the islands of Japan until he was calm. 

In adulthood, he was the father of Takitsuhiko, a rain god. 

===Ajisukitakahikone and Ame-no-Wakahiko===

When the sun goddess Amaterasu and the primordial god Takamimusubi, the rulers of the heavenly realm of Takamagahara, decreed that the earth below (Ashihara-no-Nakatsukuni) should be ruled over by Amaterasu&#x27;s progeny, they dispatched a series of messengers to its ruler, Ōkuninushi, to command him to cede supremacy over the land. One of these, Ame-no-Wakahiko, ended up marrying , one of Ōkuninushi&#x27;s daughters, and even plotted to gain the land for himself. After eight years had passed, a pheasant sent by the heavenly gods arrived and remonstrated with Ame-no-Wakahiko, who killed it with his bow and arrow. The arrow flew up to Takamagahara, but was then promptly thrown back to earth; it struck Ame-no-Wakahiko in the chest while he was asleep, killing him instantly.

During Ame-no-Wakahiko&#x27;s funeral, &#x27;s brother Ajisukitakahikone, a close friend of Ame-no-Wakahiko, arrived to pay his condolences. As he closely resembled Ame-no-Wakahiko in appearance, the family of the deceased mistook him for Ame-no-Wakahiko come back to life. Offended at being mistaken for his friend (as corpses were regarded as unclean, to be compared with or mistaken for a dead person was seen as an insult), Ajisukitakahikone in anger drew his ten-span sword, hacked to pieces the funeral hut (喪屋 &quot;moya&quot;) where Ame-no-Wakahiko&#x27;s corpse was laid and the funeral held, and then kicked it away. The ruined hut landed in the land of Mino and became a mountain called Moyama (喪山, lit. &#x27;mourning mountain&#x27;).

Ajishikitakahikone, still fuming, then flew off, the radiance that exuded from him being such that it illuminated the space of two hills and two valleys. , wishing to reveal to the mourners her brother&#x27;s identity, then composed the following song in his honor:

<text>Shang Tsung () is a fictional character and one of the main antagonists of the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. He debuted as the antagonist of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992) and has remained one of the franchise&#x27;s primary characters. Shang is a sorcerer; he is principally defined by his abilities to shapeshift into other characters and to absorb the souls of his defeated opponents. In the series, he is usually confronted by the series&#x27; protagonist Liu Kang. Shang has appeared in various media outside of the games, including the 1995 film and the 2021 film. He has received positive commentary for his design, abilities, and role in the series.

==Creation==
Shang Tsung (originally named &quot;Shang Lao&quot;) was based on a &quot;Chinese sorcerer&quot; archetype from martial arts films, including but not limited to the character Lo Pan from the film &quot;Big Trouble in Little China&quot;. He was originally envisioned as the one who would behead the losing fighter, prior to the concept of character-specific Shang Fatalities. A cut character named &quot;Kitsune&quot;, which was later developed into Kitana, &quot;was going to fit into the story as Shang Lao&#x27;s (Tsung&#x27;s) princess daughter - the spoil of victory for winning the tournament&quot;, who would betray her father after she fell for Liu Kang. However, mid-development, Boon and the team thought it would be fun to put the finishing power in the player&#x27;s hands, and started coming up with gruesome ways we could finish off their enemies rather than just Shang Tsung. So it was going to be just the boss, but just &quot;goofing around one time&quot; they made Johnny Cage duck down and uppercut the sorcerer. Following this test, the staff decided to turn everybody into finishers. The original idea was that Shang Tsung was a human traitor who had sold his soul. &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; art director Herman Sanchez said that as the series progressed he decided to emphasize Tsung&#x27;s air of &quot;sinister regality.&quot;

Shang Tsung&#x27;s design varies throughout the series. The initial history of the character was explained in the 1992 Midway-produced comic book based on the original &quot;MK&quot; game, in which he was the first-ever Mortal Kombat (then the Shaolin Tournament) champion over 500 years ago from the date of the then-current tournament depicted in the actual game, yet he was stricken with a curse that forced him to consume the souls of his defeated opponents in order to keep his youth. The book cited his &quot;failure to appease the gods&quot; as the reason for his premature aging to a withered old man, but he was noticeably younger in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, in which Shao Kahn had restored Shang Tsung&#x27;s youth and powers as part of his plan to take over Earthrealm by luring Liu Kang and his fellow Earth warriors into Outworld for the next MK tournament. His actor in the sequel changed to Phillip Ahn, turning from the original game&#x27;s Ho-Sung Pak.

According to &quot;GamePro&quot; magazine in 1993, the &quot;MKII&quot; version of Shang Tsung was nineteen years old, and an article about the game also included a rough sketch by &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator John Tobias of Tsung&#x27;s &quot;true form,&quot; a twisted demon, which has never actually appeared in the video games. Tobias wanted Shang Tsung&#x27;s long hair to hang loose in &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (in which his actor was John Turk), but potential problems with it flopping about whenever he jumped resulted in it being tied back into a ponytail. Responding to player queries about how Shang Tsung&#x27;s last name is pronounced, Acclaim Entertainment stated in 1994 that there is no one definitively correct way of pronouncing the character&#x27;s name.

In the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game Shang Tsung is a computer-controlled boss that launches fireball projectiles (consisting of a flaming skull, in contrast to Liu Kang&#x27;s fireball which is shaped like a Chinese dragon) and can morph into other characters at will; this gives him access to all of the Kombatants&#x27; signature moves. The character was originally given the morphing ability due to technical limitations as the arcade machines for the game had no memory left for his images. As a player character in &quot;MKII&quot;, he retains his morphing ability, but can only transform into playable characters (although he can transform into the non-playable sub-boss Kintaro for a fatality). His flaming skull projectile&#x27;s versatility is also expanded: he can summon skulls from above or below the opponent as well as shoot multiple skulls from his hands. Tsung&#x27;s shapeshifting went mostly unused in &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot;, &quot;Deception&quot;, &quot;Armageddon&quot;, and &quot;Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe&quot;. Ed Boon explained this was due to a lack of sufficient memory. After the ending of &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, Ed Boon decided to cast Tagawa as Shang Tsung for &quot;Aftermath&quot; as he believes several gamers often visualize him when seeing the character. Despite being presented as an anti-hero, Boon acknowledges that everybody knows he is the actual villain instead and they look forward to the obvious revelation. Tagawa himself said that &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; in general was one of the biggest experiences in his career, having enjoyed both films and gaming citing the franchise&#x27;s length in general. For &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, Shang Tsung is returning as a major villain but according to Boon he will not be final one.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; games===
First appearing in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; comic and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; game (1992), Shang Tsung was a sorcerer cursed by his gods to steal souls lest he age rapidly and die prematurely. Nonetheless, he discovered that stealing souls allowed him to absorb his victims&#x27; knowledge and fighting prowess. After entering and eventually becoming Grand Champion of the first Mortal Kombat tournament, he became its coordinator and went on to aid the otherworldly realm of Outworld win nine consecutive Mortal Kombat tournaments with the intention of using the tenth to allow Outworld&#x27;s tyrant Shao Kahn to conquer Earthrealm. However, Shang Tsung and his protégé and champion Goro are defeated by the Shaolin monk Liu Kang.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;, Shao Kahn restores Shang Tsung&#x27;s youth so the latter can resurrect the former&#x27;s queen Sindel as part of Shao Kahn&#x27;s efforts to merge Outworld with Earthrealm. While hunting survivors of the plot however, Shang Tsung is defeated by Liu Kang once more.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot;, Shang Tsung joins forces with fellow sorcerer Quan Chi in a bid to conquer the realms by resurrecting Onaga the Dragon King&#x27;s undead army, only for Onaga to be revived and reclaim his army. The sorcerers join forces with Earthrealm&#x27;s protector Raiden in a failed attempt to defeat Onaga, but the pair are killed in the process. Nonetheless, Shang Tsung is resurrected during &quot;Mortal Kombat Armageddon&quot;.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2011), Raiden alters the timeline to avert the events of &quot;Armageddon&quot;. Despite this, Shang Tsung&#x27;s role plays out as it did in the original trilogy until Shao Kahn eventually steals his soul to empower Sindel.

As of the &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; DLC story expansion &quot;Aftermath&quot;, Shang Tsung was resurrected and imprisoned in the Void by the keeper of time, Kronika, after he refused to aid her in seeking revenge on Raiden by destroying the timeline. Ever since, he secretly began plotting his own revenge. After Fire God Liu Kang kills her and gains control of her Hourglass, Shang Tsung, Fujin, and Nightwolf emerge from the Void and warn him that he can cannot use the Hourglass to restore the timeline without her Crown of Souls. Liu Kang sends the trio back in time to retrieve a past version of it, during which the sorcerer orchestrates events to ensure that he can gain the Crown with little to no opposition from Earthrealm, Outworld, and Kronika&#x27;s forces. Once they are all defeated, Shang Tsung attempts to restart history for himself, only to discover that Liu Kang had manipulated events to ensure the sorcerer&#x27;s victory over Kronika. During their subsequent battle, they unknowingly fracture time further, resulting in two timelines where each of them defeated the other, became a Titan, and used Kronika&#x27;s Hourglass to forge their own timelines, with Shang Tsung going on to conquer the various realms.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot;, Titan Shang Tsung eventually discovers Liu Kang&#x27;s timeline, where a powerless version of the former exists as a struggling snake oil salesman in Outworld. Assuming Kronika&#x27;s form and the alias of &quot;Damashi&quot;, Titan Shang Tsung secretly helps him and a similarly powerless Quan Chi regain their powers and infiltrate Empress Sindel&#x27;s court with further help from Outworld patriot General Shao. Additionally, Shang Tsung enslaved Reptile to study his ability to shapeshift, helps treat Sindel&#x27;s daughter and crown princess Mileena&#x27;s Tarkat disease, and turns Sindel and Sub-Zero of the Lin Kuei clan against Earthrealm. After Sindel eventually learns the truth of his and Quan Chi&#x27;s treachery and joins forces with Liu Kang to stop him, the sorcerers are betrayed by Titan Shang Tsung, who intends to absorb Liu Kang&#x27;s timeline. Reluctantly working with Earthrealm and Outworld, the sorcerers assist Liu Kang in thwarting and killing Titan Shang Tsung. Following this, Shang Tsung is imprisoned in Lei Chin prison, but later breaks out and attempts to return to his childhood home to recuperate and plot revenge. While travelling by sea however, a storm sends him to a deserted island that had been previously used by powerful sorcerers and contains a &quot;Well of Souls&quot;.

===Other media===

Shang Tsung appears in Malibu Comics&#x27; &quot;Blood &amp; Thunder&quot; miniseries. In addition to his original video game trilogy backstory, he displays a bitter rivalry with Raiden that usually end in verbal assaults or draws. While hosting the tenth Mortal Kombat tournament for Shao Kahn&#x27;s plot to conquer Earthrealm, Shang Tsung secretly attempts to acquire the mystical book &quot;Tao Te Zhan&quot;, which grants immense power to whoever solves its seven riddles. When Goro seeks the book, Shang Tsung and Raiden join forces to stop him. Shang Tsung also makes further appearances in the succeeding &quot;Battlewave&quot; miniseries along with DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; prequel comic.

Shang Tsung appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1995), portrayed by Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa. While hosting the Mortal Kombat tournament, he employs intimidation tactics and trickery to manipulate its outcome until he is defeated and killed by Liu Kang, who sought revenge on him for killing his brother Chan. Shang Tsung also appears in the prequel &quot;Mortal Kombat: The Journey Begins&quot;, voiced by Jim Cummings. Here, it is revealed this version also possesses telepathy, allowing him to predict enemy attacks and adapt his strategy to exploit their weaknesses.

Shang Tsung appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot;, voiced by Neil Ross.

Shang Tsung appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Konquest&quot;, portrayed by Bruce Locke. This version seeks revenge on the Great Kung Lao, who defeated him in Mortal Kombat. For this, Shao Kahn put Shang Tsung to work in the former&#x27;s cobalt mines, where he enslaves and abuses fellow prisoner and Kreevan princess Vorpax. Though Shang Tsung later escapes, he is defeated by Shao Kahn&#x27;s Shadow Priests.

Shang Tsung makes a cameo appearance in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Rebirth&quot;, portrayed by James Lew, and the &quot;Death Battle!&quot; episode &quot;Akuma vs. Shang Tsung&quot;.

Shang Tsung appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Legacy&quot; portrayed by Johnson Phan in the episode &quot;Johnny Cage&quot; and Tagawa in the second season.

Shang Tsung appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Battle of the Realms&quot;, voiced by Artt Butler. Butler has compared Shang Tsung to the &quot;Star Wars&quot; character Darth Vader due to how powerful he is despite serving under Shao Kahn. In retrospect, Butler enjoyed the fight between Shang Tsung and Liu Kang, praising Jordan Rodrigues&#x27;s performance of the character.

Shang Tsung appears in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (2021), portrayed by Chin Han. Upon learning of a prophecy that will deny Outworld a crucial victory in the Mortal Kombat tournament, Shang Tsung sends his warriors to kill Earthrealm&#x27;s champions before then. Though they are defeated, Shang Tsung threatens retaliation.

==Reception==
The character was met with a positive critical reception. Shang Tsung was ranked 17th on GameDaily&#x27;s 2009 list of top evil masterminds of all time, which noted his attack style and goals while stating he is &quot;one twisted freak.&quot; That same year, GamesRadar listed him as one of the top villains who will never stay dead. He was also sixth on GamesRadar&#x27;s list of most misunderstood videogame villains. GamesRadar also listed his Fatality where he morphs into Kintaro from &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; as one of &quot;ten greatest things about &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;&quot;. In 2010, Shang Tsung was ranked 97th in IGN&#x27;s list of top video game villains, with a comment that &quot;considering Shang Tsung&#x27;s devious powers and his cruel methods, his status as a reputable villain of the series is well deserved.&quot; Den of Geek said that while he never looked as menacing as the sub-boss Goro, his shapeshifting powers would surprise the player while his personality surprised the audience, making him one of the best bosses in fighting game history. In &quot;Game of Death&quot;, David Church found Liu Kang and Shang Tsung as obvious references Lee and Han from &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;.

He was also ranked as third in Game Revolution&#x27;s list of top old school &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters for his ability to morph into other fighters during battles. Game Rant ranked Shang Tsung at number five on their list of &quot;most awesome&quot; &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters, praising his ability to transform into other characters and adding &quot;despite Shang Tsung&#x27;s limited arsenal of unique special attacks, the character still provides experienced players with a stylish way to dispatch opponents.&quot; In UGO&#x27;s 2012 list of top &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters, Shang Tsung placed at 15th. &quot;Complex&quot; placed this &quot;cold-blooded mastermind&quot; at the top of their lists of the greatest wizards in games in 2012, calling him the &quot;coolest video game wizard ever, by far,&quot; and of the most brutal fighters in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; in 2013. In 2013, &quot;Complex&quot; also included his transformation into Kintaro and his &quot;Soul Purge&quot; in &quot;MK3&quot; among the best finishing moves in the series. Shang Tsung also became famous in the &quot;Deadly Alliance&quot; intro cutscene for killing the hero Liu Kang which surprised game journalist for the impact such dark twist had on the main narrative.

Cary Hiroyuki Tagawa&#x27;s take on Shang Tsung is now regarded as the ideal portrayal of the sorcerer. JoBlo.com noted that every actor who has taken the role since have been compared to Tagawa, commenting that his delivery &quot;has all the cadence and embellished style like he&#x27;s on Broadway, but he holds himself physically like he&#x27;s just casually laying down the law. Tagawa &quot;is&quot; Shang Tsung.&quot; &quot;Screen Rant&quot; reported that while they felt all the main cast members were equally outstanding, Tagawa was &quot;the best casting of the movie to many&quot;. While reviewing &quot;Legacy&quot;, IGN said &quot;the most noteworthy bit of recasting involves Shang Tsung&quot; due to Tagawa&#x27;s appeal on the character especially with his age despite there not being connections to the 1995 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; movie. 

Tagawa&#x27;s portrayal of Shang Tsung in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11: Aftermath&quot; was praised by HobbyConsolas for often being the center of attention in his scenes. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; praised the handling of Shang Tsung in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; in general to the point he is a more enjoyable than the already striking DLC RoboCop due to his charismatic and manipulative characterization when working alongside Raiden&#x27;s forces to obtain the power he wanted. In retrospect, the site said &quot;Tagawa gave the most memorable performance of the movie.&quot; which further proves the reason to why the &quot;Aftermath&quot; storyline is so appealing despite being an obvious villain working with the heroes.

<text>Fashion Island is an outdoor regional shopping mall in Newport Beach, California. Opened in 1967 by The Irvine Company as the anchor to their master-planned Newport Center district, Fashion Island is anchored by Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Macy&#x27;s, Neiman Marcus, and Nordstrom.

==Early history==
The $20 million, million-square-foot, Fashion Island shopping center opened on September 9, 1967, with parking spaces for 5,500 cars. It was built in the same year as the Segerstrom family&#x27;s nearby South Coast Plaza in Costa Mesa. At its launch, it featured 52 mall stores plus four anchor department stores:
*Buffums, , designed by Welton Becket and Associates
*Robinson&#x27;s, , designed by William Pereira
*The Broadway, , designed by Charles Luckman
*JCPenney, , also designed by Luckman

The overall shopping center, mall shops, and Buffums were designed by Welton Becket and Associates with only a trace of the Spanish architectural theme that later defined the property. However, one early feature of the property—a landmark koi pond constructed in 1968—remains used to this day. Later additions to Fashion Island&#x27;s anchor roster included Bullocks Wilshire, which opened in August 1977, and Neiman Marcus, which opened in March 1978.

==The 1980s==

The first major change at the shopping center occurred in April 1982, when JCPenney shut its doors. The building JCPenney occupied was redeveloped into a new, enclosed shopping area dubbed the Atrium Court, which featured a basement-level food court and two levels of shops above. An El Torito Grill, the first in the company, opened in a stand-alone building adjacent to Bullock&#x27;s in 1986.

In 1989, the center underwent a major expansion and renovation based on the design of architect Jon Jerde, adding the Island Terrace—a second food court and a seven-screen Edwards Theatres cinema - along with a dramatic restructuring of the existing center. A large portion of the property between The Broadway and Bullocks Wilshire was redeveloped into a series of pedestrian avenues radiating from a new circular courtyard with the &quot;Iris fountain&quot;, an animated fountain created by WET Design.

==1990 to 2010==

The 1990s and early 2000s brought about major consolidation and change in the department store industry of Southern California and beyond, significantly affecting Fashion Island.
In February of 1990, all Bullocks Wilshire stores were rebranded as I. Magnin, including the Fashion Island location. Buffum&#x27;s closed the following year as part of a chain-wide liquidation, with its building subdivided in 1992 to accommodate several uses including a Circuit City store. Other new additions that same year included The Cheesecake Factory adjacent to I. Magnin, a Bookstar book store near the property&#x27;s cinema, and a new multi-tenant restaurant building with a Hard Rock Cafe on the property&#x27;s perimeter.

May Department Stores opted to consolidate its two West Coast department store chains (Robinson&#x27;s and May Company California) into a single business unit, resulting in the rebranding of most Robinson&#x27;s and May Co. department stores - including the Robinson&#x27;s at Fashion Island - to Robinsons-May in 1993.

The I. Magnin brand was phased out by parent company Federated Department Stores in 1995, with the Fashion Island location rebranded as a Bullock&#x27;s Women&#x27;s Store in June of that same year.

The purchase of Broadway Stores, Inc. - the parent company of The Broadway - by Bullock&#x27;s owner Federated Department Stores in 1996 led to another significant shift in the property&#x27;s anchors. Federated announced it would rebrand the Broadway fleet of department stores into Macy&#x27;s or Bloomingdale&#x27;s, closing redundant locations in the process. The Bullock&#x27;s Women&#x27;s store at Fashion Island was converted to a women&#x27;s-only Macy&#x27;s store in the summer of 1996. The Broadway, the sole remaining anchor from the property&#x27;s 1967 opening, was renovated and reopened as Bloomingdale&#x27;s in the fall of 1996, as part of the company&#x27;s entry into California. The arrival of Bloomingdale&#x27;s was considered a major achievement for Fashion Island, beating its rival South Coast Plaza in a bidding war for the department store&#x27;s first Orange County location. The third floor of the Atrium Court building was converted into a separate Bloomingdale&#x27;s Home Store in 1997.

The first Fleming&#x27;s Prime Steakhouse &amp; Wine Bar opened adjacent to the Hard Rock Cafe in 1998, followed by then-sister concept Roy&#x27;s the following year.

Fashion Island was renovated once more in 2003, strengthening the property&#x27;s Mediterranean design and adding refreshed landscaping, architectural elements, and a new carousel.

The Hard Rock Cafe closed in 2005, and was replaced by Blue Coral, a short-lived seafood concept from Fleming&#x27;s and Roy&#x27;s parent OSI International (now Bloomin&#x27; Brands). That same year, a major renovation to the property&#x27;s Neiman Marcus created a third level above the still-operating department store.

The 2006 merger of Federated Department Stores and May Department Stores brought another wave of changes to Fashion Island. The property&#x27;s Robinsons-May store became a full-line Macy&#x27;s store, while the stand-alone Macy&#x27;s Women&#x27;s store was shuttered and sold to The Irvine Company for future development. Bookstar rebranded as Barnes &amp; Noble, and moved to a significantly larger space in the Atrium Court that same year.

In 2009, The Irvine Company began another renovation to the property, at a cost of $100 million. The renovation project included the demolition and replacement of the former Macy&#x27;s Women&#x27;s store with Nordstrom, the construction of a new multi-tenant building with a flagship Dean &amp; Deluca next to the Atrium Court, the replacement of the Island Terrace food court with upscale restaurants, and a re-leasing initiative aimed at bringing more upscale tenants to the property.

==2010 to present==

The Great Recession led to several changes at Fashion Island. The 2009 bankruptcy and subsequent liquidation of Circuit City led to the addition of a large-scale Forever 21 store in 2010. Dean &amp; Deluca cancelled its plans to open at Fashion Island in 2009, causing a delay in the construction of the multi-tenant building it was slated to occupy. Whole Foods Market signed on as a replacement for Dean &amp; Deluca in 2011, opening in 2012 along with Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods and Ulta Beauty. 

Edwards Cinemas sold their Island Terrace cinema in 2011 to The Irvine Company, who renovated the seven-screen complex and reopened it as the Island Cinema in December 2011. Several changes came about on the property&#x27;s perimeter, with True Food Kitchen supplanting Blue Coral in 2010, the El Torito Grill closing in 2012, and the construction of several new buildings on the property&#x27;s southern side in 2013. A multi-tenant building was constructed on former parking space adjacent to Macy&#x27;s, and two new restaurant buildings—intended for upscale restaurants Fig &amp; Olive and Red O—were constructed at the property&#x27;s southern entrance. Finally, the El Torito Grill became locally-owned restaurant concept Cucina Enoteca in 2014.

The Island Cinema closed in 2017 and was leased by upscale cinema operator The Lot, which renovated the theater and reopened it the following year. Forever 21 closed its Fashion Island store as part of a bankruptcy filing in 2019. The building sat vacant until 2022, when it was demolished to make room for a large-scale RH gallery store slated to open in 2024. Roy&#x27;s and Fig &amp; Olive closed in 2019 and 2022 respectively. JOEY, a Canadian restaurant group, opened in the former Roy&#x27;s space in late 2022.

Nanomaterials research takes a materials science-based approach to nanotechnology, leveraging advances in materials metrology and synthesis which have been developed in support of microfabrication research. Materials with structure at the nanoscale often have unique optical, electronic, thermo-physical or mechanical properties.

Nanomaterials are slowly becoming commercialized and beginning to emerge as commodities.
==Definition==
In ISO/TS 80004, &quot;nanomaterial&quot; is defined as the &quot;material with any external dimension in the nanoscale or having internal structure or surface structure in the nanoscale&quot;, with &quot;nanoscale&quot; defined as the &quot;length range approximately from 1 nm to 100 nm&quot;. This includes both &quot;nano-objects&quot;, which are discrete pieces of material, and &quot;nanostructured materials&quot;, which have internal or surface structure on the nanoscale; a nanomaterial may be a member of both these categories.

On 18 October 2011, the European Commission adopted the following definition of a nanomaterial:A natural, incidental or manufactured material containing particles, in an unbound state or as an aggregate or as an agglomerate and for 50% or more of the particles in the number size distribution, one or more external dimensions is in the size range 1 nm – 100 nm. In specific cases and where warranted by concerns for the environment, health, safety or competitiveness the number size distribution threshold of 50% may be replaced by a threshold between 1% to 50%.

==Sources==
===Engineered===
Engineered nanomaterials have been deliberately engineered and manufactured by humans to have certain required properties.

Legacy nanomaterials are those that were in commercial production prior to the development of nanotechnology as incremental advancements over other colloidal or particulate materials. They include carbon black and titanium dioxide nanoparticles.

===Incidental===
Nanomaterials may be unintentionally produced as a byproduct of mechanical or industrial processes through combustion and vaporization. Sources of incidental nanoparticles include vehicle engine exhausts, smelting, welding fumes, combustion processes from domestic solid fuel heating and cooking. For instance, the class of nanomaterials called fullerenes are generated by burning gas, biomass, and candle. It can also be a byproduct of wear and corrosion products. Incidental atmospheric nanoparticles are often referred to as ultrafine particles, which are unintentionally produced during an intentional operation, and could contribute to air pollution.

===Natural===
Biological systems often feature natural, functional nanomaterials. The structure of foraminifera (mainly chalk) and viruses (protein, capsid), the wax crystals covering a lotus or nasturtium leaf, spider and spider-mite silk, the blue hue of tarantulas, the &quot;spatulae&quot; on the bottom of gecko feet, some butterfly wing scales, natural colloids (milk, blood), horny materials (skin, claws, beaks, feathers, horns, hair), paper, cotton, nacre, corals, and even our own bone matrix are all natural &quot;organic&quot; nanomaterials.

Natural &quot;inorganic&quot; nanomaterials occur through crystal growth in the diverse chemical conditions of the Earth&#x27;s crust. For example, clays display complex nanostructures due to anisotropy of their underlying crystal structure, and volcanic activity can give rise to opals, which are an instance of a naturally occurring photonic crystals due to their nanoscale structure. Fires represent particularly complex reactions and can produce pigments, cement, fumed silica etc.

Natural sources of nanoparticles include combustion products forest fires, volcanic ash, ocean spray, and the radioactive decay of radon gas. Natural nanomaterials can also be formed through weathering processes of metal- or anion-containing rocks, as well as at acid mine drainage sites.

==Types==
Nano-materials are often categorized as to how many of their dimensions fall in the nanoscale. A &quot;nanoparticle&quot; is defined a nano-object with all three external dimensions in the nanoscale, whose longest and the shortest axes do not differ significantly. A &quot;nanofiber&quot; has two external dimensions in the nanoscale, with &quot;nanotubes&quot; being hollow nanofibers and &quot;nanorods&quot; being solid nanofibers. A &quot;nanoplate/nanosheet&quot; has one external dimension in the nanoscale, and if the two larger dimensions are significantly different it is called a &quot;nanoribbon&quot;. For nanofibers and nanoplates, the other dimensions may or may not be in the nanoscale, but must be significantly larger. In all of these cases, a significant difference is noted to typically be at least a factor of 3.

Nanostructured materials are often categorized by what phases of matter they contain. A &quot;nanocomposite&quot; is a solid containing at least one physically or chemically distinct region or collection of regions, having at least one dimension in the nanoscale. A &quot;nanofoam&quot; has a liquid or solid matrix, filled with a gaseous phase, where one of the two phases has dimensions on the nanoscale. A &quot;nanoporous material&quot; is a solid material containing nanopores, voids in the form of open or closed pores of sub-micron lengthscales. A &quot;nanocrystalline material&quot; has a significant fraction of crystal grains in the nanoscale.

===Nanoporous materials===

The term &quot;nanoporous materials&quot; contain subsets of microporous and mesoporous materials. Microporous materials are porous materials with a mean pore size smaller than 2 nm, while mesoporous materials are those with pores sizes in the region 2–50 nm. Microporous materials exhibit pore sizes with comparable length-scale to small molecules. For this reason such materials may serve valuable applications including separation membranes. Mesoporous materials are interesting towards applications that require high specific surface areas, while enabling penetration for molecules that may be too large to enter the pores of a microporous material. In some sources, nanoporous materials and nanofoam are sometimes considered nanostructures but not nanomaterials because only the voids and not the materials themselves are nanoscale. Although the ISO definition only considers round nano-objects to be nanoparticles, other sources use the term nanoparticle for all shapes.

===Nanoparticles===
Nanoparticles have all three dimensions on the nanoscale. Nanoparticles can also be embedded in a bulk solid to form a nanocomposite.

====Fullerenes====
The fullerenes are a class of allotropes of carbon which conceptually are graphene sheets rolled into tubes or spheres. These include the carbon nanotubes (or silicon nanotubes) which are of interest both because of their mechanical strength and also because of their electrical properties.
The first fullerene molecule to be discovered, and the family&#x27;s namesake, buckminsterfullerene (C60), was prepared in 1985 by Richard Smalley, Robert Curl, James Heath, Sean O&#x27;Brien, and Harold Kroto at Rice University. The name was a homage to Buckminster Fuller, whose geodesic domes it resembles. Fullerenes have since been found to occur in nature. More recently, fullerenes have been detected in outer space.

For the past decade, the chemical and physical properties of fullerenes have been a hot topic in the field of research and development, and are likely to continue to be for a long time. In April 2003, fullerenes were under study for potential medicinal use: binding specific antibiotics to the structure of resistant bacteria and even target certain types of cancer cells such as melanoma. The October 2005 issue of Chemistry and Biology contains an article describing the use of fullerenes as light-activated antimicrobial agents. In the field of nanotechnology, heat resistance and superconductivity are among the
properties attracting intense research.

A common method used to produce fullerenes is to send a large current between two nearby graphite electrodes in an inert atmosphere. The resulting carbon plasma arc between the electrodes cools into sooty residue from which many fullerenes can be isolated.

There are many calculations that have been done using ab-initio Quantum Methods applied to fullerenes. By DFT and TDDFT methods one can obtain IR, Raman, and UV spectra. Results of such calculations can be compared with experimental results.

====Metal-based nanoparticles====
Inorganic nanomaterials, (e.g. quantum dots, nanowires, and nanorods) because of their interesting optical and electrical properties, could be used in optoelectronics. Furthermore, the optical and electronic properties of nanomaterials which depend on their size and shape can be tuned via synthetic techniques. There are the possibilities to use those materials in organic material based optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells, OLEDs etc. The operating principles of such devices are governed by photoinduced processes like electron transfer and energy transfer. The performance of the devices depends on the efficiency of the photoinduced process responsible for their functioning. Therefore, better understanding of those photoinduced processes in organic/inorganic nanomaterial composite systems is necessary in order to use them in optoelectronic devices.

Nanoparticles or nanocrystals made of metals, semiconductors, or oxides are of particular interest for their mechanical, electrical, magnetic, optical, chemical and other properties. Nanoparticles have been used as quantum dots and as chemical catalysts such as nanomaterial-based catalysts. Recently, a range of nanoparticles are extensively investigated for biomedical applications including tissue engineering, drug delivery, biosensor.

Nanoparticles are of great scientific interest as they are effectively a bridge between bulk materials and atomic or molecular structures. A bulk material should have constant physical properties regardless of its size, but at the nano-scale this is often not the case. Size-dependent properties are observed such as quantum confinement in semiconductor particles, surface plasmon resonance in some metal particles, and superparamagnetism in magnetic materials.

Nanoparticles exhibit a number of special properties relative to bulk material. For example, the bending of bulk copper (wire, ribbon, etc.) occurs with movement of copper atoms/clusters at about the 50 nm scale. Copper nanoparticles smaller than 50 nm are considered super hard materials that do not exhibit the same malleability and ductility as bulk copper. The change in properties is not always desirable. Ferroelectric materials smaller than 10 nm can switch their polarization direction using room temperature thermal energy, thus making them useless for memory storage. Suspensions of nanoparticles are possible because the interaction of the particle surface with the solvent is strong enough to overcome differences in density, which usually result in a material either sinking or floating in a liquid. Nanoparticles often have unexpected visual properties because they are small enough to confine their electrons and produce quantum effects. For example, gold nanoparticles appear deep red to black in solution.

The often very high surface area to volume ratio of nanoparticles provides a tremendous driving force for diffusion, especially at elevated temperatures. Sintering is possible at lower temperatures and over shorter durations than for larger particles. This theoretically does not affect the density of the final product, though flow difficulties and the tendency of nanoparticles to agglomerate do complicate matters. The surface effects of nanoparticles also reduces the incipient melting temperature.

===One-dimensional nanostructures===
The smallest possible crystalline wires with cross-section as small as a single atom can be engineered in cylindrical confinement. Carbon nanotubes, a natural semi-1D nanostructure, can be used as a template for synthesis. Confinement provides mechanical stabilization and prevents linear atomic chains from disintegration; other structures of 1D nanowires are predicted to be mechanically stable even upon isolation from the templates.

===Two-dimensional nanostructures===
2D materials are crystalline materials consisting of a two-dimensional single layer of atoms. The most important representative graphene was discovered in 2004.
Thin films with nanoscale thicknesses are considered nanostructures, but are sometimes not considered nanomaterials because they do not exist separately from the substrate.

===Bulk nanostructured materials===
Some bulk materials contain features on the nanoscale, including nanocomposites, nanocrystalline materials, nanostructured films, and nanotextured surfaces.

Box-shaped graphene (BSG) nanostructure is an example of 3D nanomaterial. BSG nanostructure has appeared after mechanical cleavage of pyrolytic graphite. This nanostructure is a multilayer system of parallel hollow nanochannels located along the surface and having quadrangular cross-section. The thickness of the channel walls is approximately equal to 1 nm. The typical width of channel facets makes about 25 nm.

==Applications==
Nano materials are used in a variety of, manufacturing processes, products and healthcare including paints, filters, insulation and lubricant additives. In healthcare Nanozymes are nanomaterials with enzyme-like characteristics. They are an emerging type of artificial enzyme, which have been used for wide applications in such as biosensing, bioimaging, tumor diagnosis, antibiofouling and more. High quality filters may be produced using nanostructures, these filters are capable of removing particulate as small as a virus as seen in a water filter created by Seldon Technologies. Nanomaterials membrane bioreactor (NMs-MBR), the next generation of conventional MBR, are recently proposed for the advanced treatment of wastewater. In the air purification field, nano technology was used to combat the spread of MERS in Saudi Arabian hospitals in 2012. Nanomaterials are being used in modern and human-safe insulation technologies; in the past they were found in Asbestos-based insulation. As a lubricant additive, nano materials have the ability to reduce friction in moving parts. Worn and corroded parts can also be repaired with self-assembling anisotropic nanoparticles called TriboTEX. Nanomaterials have also been applied in a range of industries and consumer products. Mineral nanoparticles such as titanium-oxide have been used to improve UV protection in sunscreen. Phosphorus, carbon and nitrogen doped titanium-oxide nanoparticles are used as additive to water based paint for self-cleaning properties. In the sports industry, lighter bats to have been produced with carbon nanotubes to improve performance. Another application is in the military, where mobile pigment nanoparticles have been used to create more effective camouflage. Nanomaterials can also be used in three-way-catalyst applications, which have the advantage of controlling the emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx), which are precursors to acid rain and smog. In core-shell structure, nanomaterials form shell as the catalyst support to protect the noble metals such as palladium and rhodium. The primary function is that the supports can be used for carrying catalysts active components, making them highly dispersed, reducing the use of noble metals, enhancing catalysts activity, and potentially improving the stability.

==Synthesis==
The goal of any synthetic method for nanomaterials is to yield a material that exhibits properties that are a result of their characteristic length scale being in the nanometer range (1 – 100 nm). Accordingly, the synthetic method should exhibit control of size in this range so that one property or another can be attained. Often the methods are divided into two main types, &quot;bottom up&quot; and &quot;top down&quot;.

===Bottom-up methods===
Bottom-up methods involve the assembly of atoms or molecules into nanostructured arrays. In these methods the raw material sources can be in the form of gases, liquids, or solids. The latter require some sort of disassembly prior to their incorporation onto a nanostructure. Bottom up methods generally fall into two categories: chaotic and controlled.

Chaotic processes involve elevating the constituent atoms or molecules to a chaotic state and then suddenly changing the conditions so as to make that state unstable. Through the clever manipulation of any number of parameters, products form largely as a result of the insuring kinetics. The collapse from the chaotic state can be difficult or impossible to control and so ensemble statistics often govern the resulting size distribution and average size. Accordingly, nanoparticle formation is controlled through manipulation of the end state of the products. Examples of chaotic processes are laser ablation, exploding wire, arc, flame pyrolysis, combustion, and precipitation synthesis techniques.

Controlled processes involve the controlled delivery of the constituent atoms or molecules to the site(s) of nanoparticle formation such that the nanoparticle can grow to a prescribed sizes in a controlled manner. Generally the state of the constituent atoms or molecules are never far from that needed for nanoparticle formation. Accordingly, nanoparticle formation is controlled through the control of the state of the reactants. Examples of controlled processes are self-limiting growth solution, self-limited chemical vapor deposition, shaped pulse femtosecond laser techniques, plant and microbial approaches and molecular beam epitaxy.

===Top-down methods===
Top-down methods adopt some &#x27;force&#x27; (e. g. mechanical force, laser) to break bulk materials into nanoparticles. A popular method involves mechanical break apart bulk materials into nanomaterials is &#x27;ball milling&#x27;. Besides that, nanoparticles can also be made by laser ablation which apply short pulse lasers (e. g. femtosecond laser) to ablate a target (solid).

==Characterization==

Novel effects can occur in materials when structures are formed with sizes comparable to any one of many possible length scales, such as the de Broglie wavelength of electrons, or the optical wavelengths of high energy photons. In these cases quantum mechanical effects can dominate material properties. One example is quantum confinement where the electronic properties of solids are altered with great reductions in particle size. The optical properties of nanoparticles, e.g. fluorescence, also become a function of the particle diameter. This effect does not come into play by going from macrosocopic to micrometer dimensions, but becomes pronounced when the nanometer scale is reached.

In addition to optical and electronic properties, the novel mechanical properties of many nanomaterials is the subject of nanomechanics research. When added to a bulk material, nanoparticles can strongly influence the mechanical properties of the material, such as the stiffness or elasticity. For example, traditional polymers can be reinforced by nanoparticles (such as carbon nanotubes) resulting in novel materials which can be used as lightweight replacements for metals. Such composite materials may enable a weight reduction accompanied by an increase in stability and improved functionality.

Finally, nanostructured materials with small particle size, such as zeolites and asbestos, are used as catalysts in a wide range of critical industrial chemical reactions. The further development of such catalysts can form the basis of more efficient, environmentally friendly chemical processes.

The first observations and size measurements of nano-particles were made during the first decade of the 20th century. Zsigmondy made detailed studies of gold sols and other nanomaterials with sizes down to 10 nm and less. He published a book in 1914. He used an ultramicroscope that employs a &quot;dark field&quot; method for seeing particles with sizes much less than light wavelength.

There are traditional techniques developed during the 20th century in interface and colloid science for characterizing nanomaterials. These are widely used for &quot;first generation&quot; passive nanomaterials specified in the next section.

These methods include several different techniques for characterizing particle size distribution. This characterization is imperative because many materials that are expected to be nano-sized are actually aggregated in solutions. Some of methods are based on light scattering. Others apply ultrasound, such as ultrasound attenuation spectroscopy for testing concentrated nano-dispersions and microemulsions.

There is also a group of traditional techniques for characterizing surface charge or zeta potential of nano-particles in solutions. This information is required for proper system stabilization, preventing its aggregation or flocculation. These methods include microelectrophoresis, electrophoretic light scattering, and electroacoustics. The last one, for instance colloid vibration current method is suitable for characterizing concentrated systems.

==Mechanical properties==
The ongoing research has shown that mechanical properties can vary significantly in nanomaterials compared to bulk material. Nanomaterials have substantial mechanical properties due to the volume, surface, and quantum effects of nanoparticles. This is observed when the nanoparticles are added to common bulk material, the nanomaterial refines the grain and forms intergranular and intragranular structures which improve the grain boundaries and therefore the mechanical properties of the materials. Grain boundary refinements provide strengthening by increasing the stress required to cause intergranular or transgranular fractures. A common example where this can be observed is the addition of nano Silica to cement, which improves the tensile strength, compressive strength, and bending strength by the mechanisms just mentioned. The understanding of these properties will enhance the use of nanoparticles in novel applications in various fields such as surface engineering, tribology, nanomanufacturing, and nanofabrication.

Techniques used:

Steinitz in 1943 used the micro-indentation technique to test the hardness of microparticles, and now nanoindentation has been employed to measure elastic properties of particles at about 5-micron level. These protocols are frequently used to calculate the mechanical characteristics of nanoparticles via atomic force microscopy (AFM) techniques. To measure the elastic modulus; indentation data is obtained via AFM force-displacement curves being converted to force-indentation curves. Hooke&#x27;s law is used to determine the cantilever deformation and depth of the tip, and in conclusion, the pressure equation can be written as:

P=k (ẟc - ẟc0) 

ẟc : cantilever deformation

ẟc0 : deflection ofset

AFM allows us to obtain a high-resolution image of multiple types of surfaces while the tip of the cantilever can be used to obtain information about mechanical properties. Computer simulations are also being progressively used to test theories and complement experimental studies. The most used computer method is molecular dynamics simulation, which uses newton&#x27;s equations of motion for the atoms or molecules in the system. Other techniques such direct probe method are used to determine the adhesive properties of nanomaterials. Both the technique and simulation are coupled with transmission electron microscope (TEM) and AFM techniques to provide results.

Mechanical properties of common nanomaterials classes:

Crystalline metal nanomaterials: Dislocations are one of the major contributors toward elastic properties within nanomaterials similar to bulk crystalline materials. Despite the traditional view of there being no dislocations in nanomaterials. Ramos, experimental work has shown that the hardness of gold nanoparticles is much higher than their bulk counterparts, as there are stacking faults and dislocations forming that activate multiple strengthening mechanisms in the material. Through these experiments, more research has shown that via nanoindentation techniques, material strength; compressive stress, increases under compression with decreasing particle size, because of nucleating dislocations. These dislocations have been observed using TEM techniques, coupled with nanoindentation. Silicon nanoparticles strength and hardness are four times more than the value of the bulk material. The resistance to pressure applied can be attributed to the line defects inside the particles as well as a dislocation that provides strengthening of the mechanical properties of the nanomaterial. Furthermore, the addition of nanoparticles strengthens a matrix because the pinning of particles inhibits grain growth. This refines the grain, and hence improves the mechanical properties. However, not all additions of nanomaterials lead to an increase in properties for example nano-Cu. But this is attributed to the inherent properties of the material being weaker than the matrix.

Nonmetallic nanoparticles and nanomaterials:  Size-dependent behavior of mechanical properties is still not clear in the case of polymer nanomaterials however, in one research by Lahouij they found that the compressive moduli of polystyrene nanoparticles were found to be less than that of the bulk counterparts. This can be associated with the functional groups being hydrated. Furthermore, nonmetallic nanomaterials can lead to agglomerates forming inside the matrix they are being added to and hence decrease the mechanical properties by leading to fracture under even low mechanical loads, such as the addition of CNTs. The agglomerates will act as slip planes as well as planes in which cracks can easily propagate (9). However, most organic nanomaterials are flexible and these and the mechanical properties such as hardness etc. are not dominant.

Nanowires and nanotubes:  The elastic moduli of some nanowires namely lead and silver, decrease with increasing diameter. This has been associated with surface stress, oxidation layer, and surface roughness. However, the elastic behavior of ZnO nanowires does not get affected by surface effects but their fracture properties do. So, it is generally dependent on material behavior and their bonding as well.

The reason why mechanical properties of nanomaterials are still a hot topic for research is that measuring the mechanical properties of individual nanoparticles is a complicated method, involving multiple control factors. Nonetheless, Atomic force microscopy has been widely used to measure the mechanical properties of nanomaterials.

Adhesion and friction of nanoparticles

When talking about the application of a material adhesion and friction play a critical role in determining the outcome of the application. Therefore, it is critical to see how these properties also get affected by the size of a material. Again, AFM is a technique most used to measure these properties and to determine the adhesive strength of nanoparticles to any solid surface, along with the colloidal probe technique and other chemical properties. Furthermore, the forces playing a role in providing these adhesive properties to nanomaterials are either the electrostatic forces, VdW, capillary forces, solvation forces, structure force, etc. It has been found that the addition of nanomaterials in bulk materials substantially increases their adhesive capabilities by increasing their strength through various bonding mechanisms. Nanomaterials dimension approaches zero, which means that the fraction of the particle&#x27;s surface to overall atoms increases.

Along with surface effects, the movement of nanoparticles also plays a role in dictating their mechanical properties such as shearing capabilities. The movement of particles can be observed under TEM. For example, the movement behavior of MoS2 nanoparticles dynamic contact was directly observed in situ which led to the conclusion that fullerenes can shear via rolling or sliding. However, observing these properties is again a very complicated process due to multiple contributing factors.

Applications specific to Mechanical Properties:

* Lubrication
* Nano-manufacturing
* Coatings

==Uniformity==
The chemical processing and synthesis of high performance technological components for the private, industrial and military sectors requires the use of high purity ceramics, polymera, glass-ceramics, and composite materials. In condensed bodies formed from fine powders, the irregular sizes and shapes of nanoparticles in a typical powder often lead to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in packing density variations in the powder compact.

Uncontrolled agglomeration of powders due to attractive van der Waals forces can also give rise to in microstructural inhomogeneities. Differential stresses that develop as a result of non-uniform drying shrinkage are directly related to the rate at which the solvent can be removed, and thus highly dependent upon the distribution of porosity. Such stresses have been associated with a plastic-to-brittle transition in consolidated bodies, and can yield to crack propagation in the unfired body if not relieved.

In addition, any fluctuations in packing density in the compact as it is prepared for the kiln are often amplified during the sintering process, yielding inhomogeneous densification. Some pores and other structural defects associated with density variations have been shown to play a detrimental role in the sintering process by growing and thus limiting end-point densities. Differential stresses arising from inhomogeneous densification have also been shown to result in the propagation of internal cracks, thus becoming the strength-controlling flaws.

It would therefore appear desirable to process a material in such a way that it is physically uniform with regard to the distribution of components and porosity, rather than using particle size distributions which will maximize the green density. The containment of a uniformly dispersed assembly of strongly interacting particles in suspension requires total control over particle-particle interactions. A number of dispersants such as ammonium citrate (aqueous) and imidazoline or oleyl alcohol (nonaqueous) are promising solutions as possible additives for enhanced dispersion and deagglomeration. Monodisperse nanoparticles and colloids provide this potential.

Monodisperse powders of colloidal silica, for example, may therefore be stabilized sufficiently to ensure a high degree of order in the colloidal crystal or polycrystalline colloidal solid which results from aggregation. The degree of order appears to be limited by the time and space allowed for longer-range correlations to be established. Such defective polycrystalline colloidal structures would appear to be the basic elements of sub-micrometer colloidal materials science, and, therefore, provide the first step in developing a more rigorous understanding of the mechanisms involved in microstructural evolution in high performance materials and components.

==Nanomaterials in articles, patents, and products==
The quantitative analysis of nanomaterials showed that nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanocrystalline materials, nanocomposites, and graphene have been mentioned in 400,000, 181,000, 144,000, 140,000, and 119,000 ISI-indexed articles, respectively, by September 2018. As far as patents are concerned, nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanocomposites, graphene, and nanowires have been played a role in 45,600, 32,100, 12,700, 12,500, and 11,800 patents, respectively. Monitoring approximately 7,000 commercial nano-based products available on global markets revealed that the properties of around 2,330 products have been enabled or enhanced aided by nanoparticles. Liposomes, nanofibers, nanocolloids, and aerogels were also of the most common nanomaterials in consumer products.

The European Union Observatory for Nanomaterials (EUON) has produced a database (NanoData) that provides information on specific patents, products, and research publications on nanomaterials.

==Health and safety==
===World Health Organization guidelines===
The World Health Organization (WHO) published a guideline on protecting workers from potential risk of manufactured nanomaterials at the end of 2017. WHO used a precautionary approach as one of its guiding principles. This means that exposure has to be reduced, despite uncertainty about the adverse health effects, when there are reasonable indications to do so. This is highlighted by recent scientific studies that demonstrate a capability of nanoparticles to cross cell barriers and interact with cellular structures. In addition, the hierarchy of controls was an important guiding principle. This means that when there is a choice between control measures, those measures that are closer to the root of the problem should always be preferred over measures that put a greater burden on workers, such as the use of personal protective equipment (PPE). WHO commissioned systematic reviews for all important issues to assess the current state of the science and to inform the recommendations according to the process set out in the WHO Handbook for guideline development. The recommendations were rated as &quot;strong&quot; or &quot;conditional&quot; depending on the quality of the scientific evidence, values and preferences, and costs related to the recommendation.

The WHO guidelines contain the following recommendations for safe handling of manufactured nanomaterials (MNMs)

A. Assess health hazards of MNMs
# WHO recommends assigning hazard classes to all MNMs according to the Globally Harmonized System (GHS) of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals for use in safety data sheets. For a limited number of MNMs this information is made available in the guidelines (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 
# WHO recommends updating safety data sheets with MNM-specific hazard information or indicating which toxicological end-points did not have adequate testing available (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 
# For the respirable fibres and granular biopersistent particles&#x27; groups, the GDG suggests using the available classification of MNMs for provisional classification of nanomaterials of the same group (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence).
B. Assess exposure to MNMs
# WHO suggests assessing workers&#x27; exposure in workplaces with methods similar to those used for the proposed specific occupational exposure limit (OEL) value of the MNM (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). 
# Because there are no specific regulatory OEL values for MNMs in workplaces, WHO suggests assessing whether workplace exposure exceeds a proposed OEL value for the MNM. A list of proposed OEL values is provided in an annex of the guidelines. The chosen OEL should be at least as protective as a legally mandated OEL for the bulk form of the material (conditional recommendation, low-quality evidence). 
# If specific OELs for MNMs are not available in workplaces, WHO suggests a step-wise approach for inhalation exposure with, first an assessment of the potential for exposure; second, conducting basic exposure assessment and third, conducting a comprehensive exposure assessment such as those proposed by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) or Comité Européen de Normalisation (the European Committee for Standardization, CEN) (conditional recommendation, moderate quality evidence). 
# For dermal exposure assessment, WHO found that there was insufficient evidence to recommend one method of dermal exposure assessment over another.
C. Control exposure to MNMs
# Based on a precautionary approach, WHO recommends focusing control of exposure on preventing inhalation exposure with the aim of reducing it as much as possible (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 
# WHO recommends reduction of exposures to a range of MNMs that have been consistently measured in workplaces especially during cleaning and maintenance, collecting material from reaction vessels and feeding MNMs into the production process. In the absence of toxicological information, WHO recommends implementing the highest level of controls to prevent workers from any exposure. When more information is available, WHO recommends taking a more tailored approach (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 
# WHO recommends taking control measures based on the principle of hierarchy of controls, meaning that the first control measure should be to eliminate the source of exposure before implementing control measures that are more dependent on worker involvement, with PPE being used only as a last resort. According to this principle, engineering controls should be used when there is a high level of inhalation exposure or when there is no, or very little, toxicological information available. In the absence of appropriate engineering controls PPE should be used, especially respiratory protection, as part of a respiratory protection programme that includes fit-testing (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 
# WHO suggests preventing dermal exposure by occupational hygiene measures such as surface cleaning, and the use of appropriate gloves (conditional recommendation, low quality evidence).
# When assessment and measurement by a workplace safety expert is not available, WHO suggests using control banding for nanomaterials to select exposure control measures in the workplace. Owing to a lack of studies, WHO cannot recommend one method of control banding over another (conditional recommendation, very low-quality evidence).
For health surveillance WHO could not make a recommendation for targeted MNM-specific health surveillance programmes over existing health surveillance programmes that are already in use owing to the lack of evidence. WHO considers training of workers and worker involvement in health and safety issues to be best practice but could not recommend one form of training of workers over another, or one form of worker involvement over another, owing to the lack of studies available. It is expected that there will be considerable progress in validated measurement methods and risk assessment and WHO expects to update these guidelines in five years&#x27; time, in 2022.

===Other guidance===
Because nanotechnology is a recent development, the health and safety effects of exposures to nanomaterials, and what levels of exposure may be acceptable, are subjects of ongoing research. Of the possible hazards, inhalation exposure appears to present the most concern. Animal studies indicate that carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers can cause pulmonary effects including inflammation, granulomas, and pulmonary fibrosis, which were of similar or greater potency when compared with other known fibrogenic materials such as silica, asbestos, and ultrafine carbon black. Acute inhalation exposure of healthy animals to biodegradable inorganic nanomaterials have not demonstrated significant toxicity effects. Although the extent to which animal data may predict clinically significant lung effects in workers is not known, the toxicity seen in the short-term animal studies indicate a need for protective action for workers exposed to these nanomaterials, although no reports of actual adverse health effects in workers using or producing these nanomaterials were known as of 2013. Additional concerns include skin contact and ingestion exposure, and dust explosion hazards.

Elimination and substitution are the most desirable approaches to hazard control. While the nanomaterials themselves often cannot be eliminated or substituted with conventional materials, it may be possible to choose properties of the nanoparticle such as size, shape, functionalization, surface charge, solubility, agglomeration, and aggregation state to improve their toxicological properties while retaining the desired functionality. Handling procedures can also be improved, for example, using a nanomaterial slurry or suspension in a liquid solvent instead of a dry powder will reduce dust exposure. Engineering controls are physical changes to the workplace that isolate workers from hazards, mainly ventilation systems such as fume hoods, gloveboxes, biosafety cabinets, and vented balance enclosures. Administrative controls are changes to workers&#x27; behavior to mitigate a hazard, including training on best practices for safe handling, storage, and disposal of nanomaterials, proper awareness of hazards through labeling and warning signage, and encouraging a general safety culture. Personal protective equipment must be worn on the worker&#x27;s body and is the least desirable option for controlling hazards. Personal protective equipment normally used for typical chemicals are also appropriate for nanomaterials, including long pants, long-sleeve shirts, and closed-toed shoes, and the use of safety gloves, goggles, and impervious laboratory coats. In some circumstances respirators may be used.

Exposure assessment is a set of methods used to monitor contaminant release and exposures to workers. These methods include personal sampling, where samplers are located in the personal breathing zone of the worker, often attached to a shirt collar to be as close to the nose and mouth as possible; and area/background sampling, where they are placed at static locations. The assessment should use both particle counters, which monitor the real-time quantity of nanomaterials and other background particles; and filter-based samples, which can be used to identify the nanomaterial, usually using electron microscopy and elemental analysis. As of 2016, quantitative occupational exposure limits have not been determined for most nanomaterials. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has determined non-regulatory recommended exposure limits for carbon nanotubes, carbon nanofibers, and ultrafine titanium dioxide. Agencies and organizations from other countries, including the British Standards Institute and the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in Germany, have established OELs for some nanomaterials, and some companies have supplied OELs for their products.

Nanoscale diagnostics

Nanotechnology has been making headlines in the medical field, being responsible for biomedical imaging. The unique optical, magnetic and chemical properties of materials on the Nano scale has allowed the development of imaging probes with multi-functionality such as better contrast enhancement, better spatial information, controlled bio distribution, and multi-modal imaging across various scanning devices. These developments have had advantages such as being able to detect the location of tumors and inflammations, accurate assessment of disease progression, and personalized medicine.

# Silica nanoparticles- Silica nanoparticles can be classified into solid, non-porous, and mesoporous. They have large surface are, hydrophilic surface, and chemical and physical stabilities. Silica nanoparticles are made by the use of the Stöber process. Which is the hydrolysis of silyl ethers such as tetraethyl silicate into silanols (Si-OH) using ammonia in a mixture of water and alcohol followed by the condensation of silanols into 50–2000 nm silica particles. The size of the particle can be controlled by varying the concentration of silyl ether and alcohol or the micro emulsion method. Mesoporous silica nanoparticles are synthesized by the sol-gel process. They have pores that range in diameter from 2 nm to 50 nm. They are synthesized in a water-based solution in the presence of a base catalyst and a pore forming agent known as a surfactant. Surfactants are molecules that present the particularity to have a hydrophobic tail (alkyl chain) and a hydrophilic head (charged group, such as a quaternary amine for example). As these surfactants are added to a water-based solution, they will coordinate to form micelles with increasing concentration in order to stabilize the hydrophobic tails. Varying the pH of the solution and composition of the solvents, and the addition of certain swelling agents can control the pore size. Their hydrophilic surface is what makes silica nanoparticles so important and allows them to carry out functions such as drug and gene delivery, bio imaging and therapy. In order for this application to be successful, assorted surface functional groups are necessary and can be added either by the co-condensation process during preparation or by post surface modification. The high surface area of silica nanoparticles allows them to carry much larger amounts of the desired drug than through conventional methods like polymers and liposomes. It allows for site specific targeting, especially in the treatment of cancer. Once the particles have reached their destination, they can act as a reporter, release a compound, or be remotely heated to damage biological structures in close proximity.  Targeting is typically accomplished by modifying the surface of the nanoparticle with a chemical or biological compound. They accumulate at tumor sites through Enhanced Permeability Retention (EPR), where the tumor vessels accelerate the delivery of the nanoparticles directly into the tumor. The porous shell of the silica allows control over the rate at which the drug diffuses out of the nanoparticle. The shell can be modified to have an affinity for the drug, or even to be triggered by pH, heat, light, salts, or other signaling molecules. Silica nanoparticles are also used in bio imaging because they can accommodate fluorescent/MRI/PET/ SPECT contrast agents and drug/DNA molecules to their adaptable surface and pores. This is made possible by using the silica nanoparticle as a vector for the expression of fluorescent proteins. Several different types of fluorescent probes, like cyanine dyes, methyl violegen, or semiconductor quantum dots can be conjugated to silica nanoparticles and delivered into specific cells or injected in vivo. Carrier molecule RGD peptide has been very useful of targeted in vivo imaging. 
# Topically applied surface-enhanced resonance Raman ratiometric spectroscopy (TAS3RS)- TAS3RS is another technique that is starting to make advancement in the medical field. It is an imaging technique that uses Folate Receptors (FR) to detect tumor lesions as small as 370 micrometers. Folate Receptors are membrane bound surface proteins that bind folates and folate conjugates with high affinity. FR is frequently overexpressed in a number of human malignancies including cancer of the ovary, lung, kidney, breast, bladder, brain, and endometrium. Raman imaging is a type of spectroscopy that is used in chemistry to provide structural fingerprint by which molecules can be identified. It relies upon inelastic scattering of photons, which result in ultra high sensitivity. There was a study that was done where two different surface enhanced resonance Raman scattering were synthesized (SERRS). One of the SERRS was a &quot;targeted nanoprobe functionalized with an anti-folate-receptor antibody (αFR-Ab) via a PEG-maleimide-succinimide and using the infrared dye IR780 as the Raman reporter, henceforth referred to as αFR-NP, and a nontargeted probe (nt-NP) coated with PEG5000-maleimide and featuring the IR140 infrared dye as the Raman reporter.&quot; These two different mixtures were injected into tumor bearing mice and healthy controlled mice. The mice were imaged with Bioluminescence (BLI) signal that produces light energy within an organism&#x27;s body. They were also scanned with the Raman microscope in order to be able to see the correlation between the TAS3RS and the BLI map. TAS3RS did not show anything in the healthy mice, but was able to locate the tumor lesions in the infected mice and also able to create a TAS3RS map that could be used as guidance during surgery. TAS3RS shows to be promising in being able to combat ovarian and peritoneal cancer as it allows early detection with high accuracy. This technique can be administered locally, which is an advantage as it does not have to enter the bloodstream and therefore bypassing the toxicity concerns circulating nanoprobes. This technique is also more photostable than fluorochromes because SERRS nanoparticles cannot form from biomolecules and therefore there would not be any false positives in TAS3RS as there is in fluorescence imaging.

<text>A recurring character is a fictional character, usually in a prime time TV series, who frequently appears from time to time during the series&#x27; run. Recurring characters often play major roles in more than one episode, sometimes being the main focus. They may be contrasted with &quot;regular&quot; characters, who typically appear in every or almost every episode of a series. Recurring characters appear less frequently than regulars, but more frequently than guest star characters, who may appear in only one, two or more episodes without being expected to return.

Recurring characters sometimes start out as guest stars in one episode, who then reappear in future episodes because creators or audiences found the actors or storylines compelling enough to revisit. Sometimes a recurring character eventually becomes part of the main cast of characters; such a character is sometimes called a breakout character. Some notable examples of main characters who were originally recurring characters are: Eli Gold on &quot;The Good Wife&quot;; Leo Chingkwake on &quot;That &#x27;70s Show&quot;; Angel and Oz on &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;; Marc St. James on &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;; Vanessa Abrams on &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;; Zack Allan on &quot;Babylon 5&quot;; Steve Urkel on &quot;Family Matters&quot;; Donna Moss on &quot;The West Wing&quot;; Steve Harrington on &quot;Stranger Things&quot;; and Felicity Smoak on &quot;Arrow&quot;.

In other cases, recurring characters have been given spin-off series of their own, such as Dr. Frasier Crane who originally was a recurring character on &quot;Cheers&quot;. Kelsey Grammer, along with fellow recurring actor John Ratzenberger were hired for seven episodes, to play Frasier Crane and Cliff Clavin respectively. Cliff was scheduled to recur during the 1982–1983 season, Frasier to recur during 1984–1985 season. Both actors were subsequently upgraded to the main cast, and Crane continued in his own series following the end of &quot;Cheers&quot;.

On sketch comedy programs, recurring characters are generally a . For example, in the sketch comedy series &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, Sid Caesar used the concept frequently:

Usually they appear in their own sketch and the sketch itself can become a regular part of the show. Some notable examples include the Church Lady and Hans and Franz from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, the Gumbys from &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, and Bob and Doug McKenzie from &quot;SCTV&quot;. However, the characters are not always limited to their own sketches. Sometimes, characters from a recurring sketch go on to appear in other sketches, or develop into their own TV shows. For example, when &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; was canceled the central character of a popular recurring sketch called &quot;The Family&quot;, Thelma &quot;Mama&quot; Harper, went on to have her own show &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;. Also, recurring characters in sketch comedy shows can go on to have their own movies. This is especially true with &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; which has had many recurring characters turn into movies such as Stuart Smalley, Wayne and Garth of &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, The Blues Brothers, and &quot;The Ladies Man&quot;. Recurring characters may even revisit shows long after the actor who played them has left the cast, for example, the character Mary Katherine Gallagher was portrayed by Molly Shannon when she hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 2007, six years after she left the cast. Sometimes a recurring character from one show appears on another show, such as when Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1983 and portrayed Bob and Doug MacKenzie, or when Emily Litella (portrayed by Gilda Radner) from &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; appeared on &quot;The Muppet Show&quot; in 1978. Sacha Baron Cohen&#x27;s character Ali G is another example, originating on the Channel Four series &quot;The Eleven O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;. The character was such a huge success that Cohen got his own show as the original show was cancelled.

Recurring characters are not limited to television. In the early 20th century, the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; frequently had recurring characters in their cover art, such as Baby New Year. The Shmoo was a recurring character in the comic strip Li&#x27;l Abner, which eventually went on to appear in the TV cartoon series &quot;Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo&quot; and &quot;The New Shmoo&quot;. The Sherlock Holmes series of novels by Arthur Conan Doyle featured well-known recurring characters such as Inspector Lestrade and Mrs. Hudson.

In American daytime soap operas, recurring characters are ones played by actors who do not have a contract. They are not obligated to play the role and have no guarantee of work. Actors on recurring status used to be referred to as day players.

<text>Rāgarāja () is a deity venerated in the Esoteric and Vajrayana Buddhist traditions. He is especially revered in Chinese Esoteric Buddhism in Chinese communities as well as Shingon and Tendai in Japan.

==Nomenclature==
Rāgarāja is known to transform worldly lust into spiritual awakening. When scriptures related to him reached China during the Tang dynasty, his Sanskrit name was translated as &quot;Àirǎn Míngwáng&quot; &quot;Love-stained Wisdom King&quot;. In Japanese, the same Kanji characters are read &quot;Aizen Myō&#x27;ō&quot;.

==Depiction==
Rāgarāja, also known as Aizen-Myōō, is one of many Wisdom kings, (but not in the traditional grouping of the five great Myoo, or Godai Myoo) Wisdom Kings like Acala (Fudo-Myōō). There are four different mandalas associated with Rāgarāja: The first posits him with thirty-seven assistant devas, the second with seventeen. The other two are special arrangements: one made by Enchin, fourth Tendai patriarch; the other is a Shiki mandala which represents deities using their mantra seed syllables drawn in bonji. Rāgarāja is also depicted in statuary and thangka having two heads: Rāgarāja and Acala or Rāgarāja and Guanyin, both iterations symbolizing a commingling of subjugated, complementary energies, typically male/female but also male/male. There are two, four or six armed incarnations of Rāgarāja but the six-armed one is the most common. Those six arms bear a bell which calls one to awareness; a vajra, the diamond that cuts through illusion, an unopened lotus flower representing the power of subjugation, a bow and arrows (sometimes with Rāgarāja shooting the arrow into the heavens), and the last one holding something that we cannot see (referred to by advanced esoteric practitioners as &quot;THAT&quot;.) Rāgarāja is most commonly depicted sitting in full lotus position atop an urn that ejects jewels showing beneficence in granting wishes.

He is portrayed as a red-skinned man with a fearsome appearance, a vertical third eye and flaming wild hair that represents rage, lust and passion. Rāgarāja was also popular among Chinese tradesmen who worked in the fabric-dying craft, typically accomplished with sorghum. He is petitioned by devotees for a peaceful home and fortune in business. There is usually a lion&#x27;s head on top of his head in his hair, representing the mouth into which thoughts and wishes may be fed. Some of these are the wishes of local devotees who make formal requests for success in marriage and sexual relations. According to the &quot;Pavilion of Vajra Peak and all its Yogas and Yogins Sutra&quot; with the abbreviated name of the &quot;&quot;Yogins Sutra&quot; (likely an apocryphal work attributed to the great Buddhist patriarch Vajrabodhi) Rāgarāja represents the state at which harnessed sexual excitement or agitation—which are otherwise decried as defilements—are seen as equal to enlightenment &quot;bonno soku bodai,&quot; and passionate love can become compassion for all living things.

Rāgarāja is similar to the red form of Tara, called &quot;Kurukulla&quot;, in Tibetan Buddhism. Appropriately, Rāgarāja&#x27;s mantras are pronounced in either Chinese or Japanese transliterations of Sanskrit; the cadences depending upon the respective region where his devotees reside and practice, and whether in the Shingon or Tendai schools. His seed vowel, as written in bonji, is pronounced &quot;HUM,&quot; usually with a forceful emphasis coming from the use of lower belly muscles. This is part of the syncretic practice of mixing Tantra and Buddhism as was popular during the Heian period courts and amongst the lower classes of both China and Japan. His popularity in Japan reached an apogee when a Shingon priest used magical chants and rituals to call up the Kamikaze that protected the Japanese from sea-born invaders.

==Patronage of homosexuality in Japan==

At various periods throughout Japanese history, Rāgarāja was invoked as a patron and symbol of homoerotic male desire. While it is ahistorical to ascribe a &quot;gay&quot; self-identification to historical figures, clear examples of Rāgarāja&#x27;s patronage of men having intimate sexual relations with other men appear in the historical record. Male kabuki actors placed love letters to the men they desired on the wall of Rāgarāja&#x27;s temple at Naniwa in hopes of attaining success in love. In a story from the Ashikaga era, a man praises his male lover by comparing him to Rāgarāja. Rāgarāja&#x27;s dharani was also included in the preparatory prayers performed by the young male consorts of Japanese Buddhist monks in some kanjo rituals.

<doc id="868123" wikidata="Q4523041" url="?curid=868123" title="Ralph Sherwin">
<text>Ralph Sherwin (25 October 1550 – 1 December 1581) was an English Roman Catholic priest, executed in 1581. He is a Catholic martyr and saint.

==Early years and education==
Sherwin was born at Rodsley, Derbyshire to John and Constance Sherwin and christened in Longford church. He was educated at Eton College. In 1568, he was nominated by Sir William Petre to one of the eight fellowships which he had founded at Exeter College, Oxford, probably influenced by Sherwin&#x27;s uncle, John Woodward, who from 1556 to 1566 had been rector of Ingatestone, Essex, where Petre lived. A talented classical scholar, Sherwin obtained his Bachelor of Arts in 1571 and Master of Arts on 2 July 1574, and the following year converted to Roman Catholicism. He soon made for the English College at Douai, where he was ordained a priest by the Bishop of Cambrai on 23 March 1577. On 2 August 1577, he left for Rome, where he stayed at the English College, Rome for nearly three years. On 18 April 1580, Sherwin and thirteen companions left Rome for England as missionaries. He got into England in early August and started his successful ministry in different parts of the country but not for long.

==Prison and death==
On 9 November 1580, he was arrested while preaching in the house of Nicholas Roscarrock in London and imprisoned in the Marshalsea, where he converted many fellow prisoners, and on 4 December was transferred to the Tower of London, where he was twice tortured on the rack and then laid out in the snow. Later he was put into an isolation cell, without food. He is said to have been personally offered a bishopric by Elizabeth I if he converted, but refused. After spending a year in prison he was finally brought to trial with Edmund Campion on a charge of treasonable conspiracy. He was convicted in Westminster Hall on 20 November 1581. Eleven days later he was taken to Tyburn on a hurdle along with Alexander Briant and Edmund Campion, where the three martyrs were hanged, drawn and quartered. On the scaffold Ralph Sherwin again &quot;professed his innocence, proclaimed his Catholic faith, and prayed for the Queen&quot;. Sherwin&#x27;s last words were &quot;Iesu, Iesu, Iesu, esto mihi Iesus!&quot;

==Veneration==

Sherwin was the first member of the English College in Rome to be martyred. During the years 1581–1681 over forty more students were martyred for their faith. He was beatified on 29 December 1886 by Pope Leo XIII. He was canonised on 25 October 1970 by Pope Paul VI as one of the Forty Martyrs of England and Wales with a common feast day of 25 October. His individual feast day is celebrated on 1 December, the day of his martyrdom.

A Catholic church in the Chellaston area of Derby, registered in January 1981, was dedicated to Ralph Sherwin. The church was demolished in 2018 to make space for a Lidl supermarket.

There is a Sherwin Football Club based in the Normanton area of Derby. Founded in 1973, the club provides football and social opportunities for all ages and both genders in the local community. The club colours are purple with yellow trim.

<doc id="868125" wikidata="Q1810368" url="?curid=868125" title="Heartbeat (British TV series)">
<text>Heartbeat is a British police procedural period drama series, based upon the &quot;Constable&quot; series of novels written by Nicholas Rhea, and produced by Yorkshire Television until it was merged with ITV, then by ITV Studios, from 1992 until 2010. The series is set in the North Riding of Yorkshire during the 1960s, with plots centred on the fictional locations of Aidensfield and Ashfordly. 

The programme initially starred Nick Berry, Niamh Cusack, Derek Fowlds, William Simons, Mark Jordon and Bill Maynard, but as more main characters were added to the series, additional actors included Jason Durr, Jonathan Kerrigan, Philip Franks, Duncan Bell, Clare Wille, Lisa Kay, Tricia Penrose, Geoffrey Hughes, Peter Benson and Gwen Taylor. Production of episodes involved filming of outdoor and exterior scenes around the North Riding, including in and around Whitby and Goathland, with interior scenes filmed at The Leeds Studios.

&quot;Heartbeat&quot; proved popular from the beginning, when early series consistently drew over 10 million viewers, achieving a peak audience of 13.82 million in 2001, and 12.8 million viewers in 2003. Its success eventually led to a spin-off series, titled &quot;The Royal&quot;, as well as a special episode, and three documentaries. In June 2010, ITV announced the cancellation of &quot;Heartbeat&quot; after its eighteenth series, following discussions on its future.

==Premise==

&quot;Heartbeat&quot; is a period drama set within the North Riding of Yorkshire during the 1960s. Plots for each episode are centred around the fictional locations of Aidensfield and Ashfordly, occasionally including the real town of Whitby. Some episodes featured references to the counterculture movement of the 1960s.

The programme&#x27;s title was chosen by writers to represent the series&#x27; key characters who worked as police officers and medical staff &quot;heart&quot; for the medical themes featured regularly in the programme, and &quot;beat&quot; for a policeman&#x27;s &quot;beat&quot; or area that he patrols. Each episode&#x27;s set of storylines were inspired by those of the &quot;Constable&quot; series of books, written by Nicholas Rhea (the pen-name of former policeman Peter Walker), which were focused on a police constable in the 1960s who came to Aidensfield. Many of the characters and locations in the &quot;Constable&quot; series were used for creating the setting and plots in &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, under guidance from Rhea.

The series was originally intended as a launch platform for actor Nick Berry, following his involvement on the BBC&#x27;s soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Berry and actress Niamh Cusack were the prominent main actors of the programme for its first two series. Storylines mainly focused around both their characters, as they offered aid to those around the village and beyond, though the tone of plots was portrayed with grittiness and social realism. From the third series onwards, the role of the village policeman continued to be central to the storyline, but supporting actors were redefined as the programme&#x27;s main cast, with their characters elevated in presence, effectively developing &quot;Heartbeat&quot; into an ensemble drama that was themed as more cosy and comfortable compared to more modern TV police dramas. The changes were more notable by how supporting actors gained more prominence in the opening titles after being elevated into the series&#x27; main cast up until the fifth series, both Berry and Cusack were prominently featured in the opening credits, but this changed in later series so that by the beginning of the seventh series, all actors in the main cast were given credit for their involvement.

After the fifth series, storylines became less centralized around the village constable, focusing on separate storylines that retained a set structure within episodes: one focusing on a crime solved by the village constable and his colleagues at Ashfordly police; one focused on a medical issue that the village doctor and/or nurse would treat; and a side story focused on the programme&#x27;s &quot;lovable rogue&quot; character which mainly was designed as comic relief, but sometimes featured light-hearted plots. In addition, over-arching storylines covering several episodes or even series, provided sub-plots between main characters, allowing for character and relationship development between them, with additional characters added in over time. In time, &quot;Heartbeat&quot; saw the cast being changed throughout its broadcast history, as new characters were introduced to replace those who left the show.

Sixties pop music features prominently in episodes, notably from the Beatles and Chuck Berry, forming the backbone of &quot;Heartbeat&quot;″s soundtrack, although music from other decades sometimes is played in episodes. 

Some 1970s records appear anachronistically, such as the Hollies&#x27; 1974 song &quot;The Air That I Breathe&quot;, Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Black Dog&quot; (1971), Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s &quot;Free Bird&quot; (1974) or Pink Floyd&#x27;s 1971 instrumental &quot;One of These Days&quot;. The end scene of the series 17 episode &quot;You Never Can Tell&quot; is accompanied by the Flying Pickets&#x27; 1983 song &quot;Only You&quot;, an episode which featured a guest appearance by the band&#x27;s lead singer Brian Hibbard.

Although &quot;Heartbeat&quot; was broadcast over 18 years from 1992 to 2010, the show remained set in the 1960s throughout its entire run. Series 1, which broadcast in 1992, was set in 1963 at the very earliest, but mostly in 1964, due to mentions of Christine Keeler in the first episode, the Dallas police at John F. Kennedy&#x27;s assassination being mentioned in the past tense, and Lyndon B. Johnson being the current US president. By roughly Series 8, &quot;Heartbeat&quot; had reached 1969, and yet the show seemingly remained set in 1969 until the end of Series 18&#x27;s broadcast in 2010, never moving into the 1970s. The episode titled &quot;One Small Step&quot;, which was the 21st episode of Series 16, took place at the time of the July 1969 Apollo 11 moon landings.

&quot;Heartbeat&quot; had five main stars over the course of its 18 series run, i.e. Nick Berry as Nick Rowan (Series 1–7, 1992–1998), Jason Durr as Mike Bradley (Series 7–12, 1997–2003), James Carlton as Steve Crane (Series 12–13, 2003–2004), Jonathan Kerrigan as Rob Walker (Series 14–16, 2004–2007), and Joe McFadden as Joe Mason (Series 17–18, 2007–2010).

==Episodes==

===Special programmes===
The following is a list of specials made for &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, most of which were behind-the-scene documentaries. All were later included in DVD boxsets for specific series of the programme:

* &quot;Heartbeat: Changing Places&quot; (13 June 1999) – A one-off special, starring Nick Berry and Juliette Gruber, who reprised their roles as Nick and Jo Rowan respectively. This extended episode was initially released on VHS in 1998, before its television debut over a year later. It focused on life for the Rowans after they move to Canada, including Nick&#x27;s new job as a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. The episode was filmed on location in Cochrane, Alberta, which is around 22 miles from the city of Calgary. In Cochrane, Nick discovers a lot of similarities to what he had in Aidensfield, such as a police boss like Blaketon and a female lovable rogue who is similar to Greengrass. There are also differences, such as the need to use guns in the line of duty, the presence of First Nations people, and the different animals that roam the countryside and bins, such as bears and moose.

===Filming===


The series was filmed at various locations around North Yorkshire. These include shots on the moors and frequent mentions of local roads (like the A171). Exterior scenes of Aidensfield are filmed in the village of Goathland in North Yorkshire, with the village&#x27;s railway station also appearing occasionally. Other prominent filming locations include Whitby, Otley and Scarborough. The &quot;Heartbeat: Changing Places&quot; special includes location filming in Canada and in series 18, two episodes were filmed on location in Queensland, Australia.

==Broadcast==
When &quot;Heartbeat&quot; first began on 10 April 1992 it aired on Fridays at 9.00 pm (on the ITV Network) but from series 2 it was moved to Sunday evenings in the 7.00 pm or 8.00 pm timeslot. All &quot;Heartbeat&quot; episodes are around 42–51 minutes long (one hour with adverts). The opening episode of Series 11 was planned to be the show&#x27;s first two-hour episode, but it was eventually split into a two-part story, &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Leaving Home&quot;. In 1994 a one-off feature-length episode was filmed, starring Lloyd Owen as constable Tom Merriweather.

&quot;Heartbeat&quot; repeats have appeared on ITV during the summer months (often billed on-screen as &quot;Classic Heartbeat&quot;), typically at 5.00 pm or, in 2006, at 4.00 pm. In 2006, episodes from the first few series were repeated again. Most of the swearing (&quot;bloody&quot;, &quot;bastard&quot;, etc.) and violence that was present in the early episodes was edited out for these daytime broadcasts.

For several years (as of 2016) &quot;Heartbeat&quot; reruns from series 11–18 have shown on ITV3, formerly in the original two-commercial-break format and latterly with three breaks. These repeats run daily each weekday lunchtime, with a second airing in an early-evening timeslot. Episodes from different series were shown on ITV3 at weekends.

As of autumn 2015, series 1–10 of &quot;Heartbeat&quot; was being aired on the then-new ITV Encore channel, which was only available on the Sky TV platform (until ITV Encore ceased broadcasting). These episodes were broadcast at a time when ITV had two commercial breaks and therefore have a running time of around 50 minutes. However ITV Encore has 60-minute programme slots which include three commercial breaks, so some scenes are edited or have been completely removed, purely for timing reasons. An example of this was the series 7 episode 22 &quot;Unconsidered Trifles&quot;, in which the scene with PC Mike Bradley and Bernie Scripps herding cows back into the farm shed was completely omitted.

After ITV Encore&#x27;s closure in 2018, all series of &quot;Heartbeat&quot; aired each weekday on ITV3.

Ratings slowly declined after series 13. The schedule was split in half to incorporate the launch of &quot;The Royal&quot; from Series 12. Series 1 and 2 (1992–1993) aired between April and June, Series 3–6 (1993–1996) moved to the autumn schedule between September and December when there were either 10 or 16 episodes per series. Series 7–11 (1997–2002), comprising 24 episodes, aired between September and March.

==&quot;The Royal&quot;==

The ITV medical drama series &quot;The Royal&quot; was originally a spin-off from &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, with the twelfth-series &quot;Heartbeat&quot; episode &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; serving as an introductory pilot for the show, with the Aidensfield police officers conducting parts of their investigations in &quot;The Royal&quot; hospital. The series initially had close ties with &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, and several &quot;Heartbeat&quot; characters made an appearance. Over time, however, the crossovers were dropped and &quot;The Royal&quot; developed its own identity.

==Cancellation==
On 5 June 2001, ITV planned cutbacks for dramas such as &quot;London&#x27;s Burning&quot;, &quot;Heartbeat&quot; and &quot;Peak Practice&quot; to make room for new commissions which could have seen the programme&#x27;s demise. A spokesman said &quot;The temptation is to just cancel long running shows. But if you do that you can spend years trying to find replacements that achieve the same viewing figures.&quot;

Kathleen Beedles, the new producer as of series 18, originally said &quot;Heartbeat&quot; was expected to continue until at least series 20 (at the time scheduled for 2010–11). However, it was announced on 28 January 2009 that production of both &quot;Heartbeat&quot; and its spin off show &quot;The Royal&quot; would be suspended for an unspecified period of time so that a large backlog of unbroadcast episodes could be cleared. Some newspaper reports interpreted this as meaning the show would be permanently cancelled. A report in &quot;The Telegraph&quot; suggested &quot;Heartbeat&quot; may return in &quot;a new lower budget form&quot;.

In March 2009, a meeting to discuss the future of the show took place between ITV bosses and &quot;Heartbeat&quot; cast and crew members. The mood after the meeting was reportedly pessimistic about the show&#x27;s long-term survival. Actor Steven Blakeley, who played PC Younger, said the cast were to be released after series 18, indicating the show had been cancelled and filming had finished.

News of the show&#x27;s alleged cancellation prompted protests from &quot;Heartbeat&quot; fans around the world, as well as from communities in the Yorkshire Television region where the series was filmed, and where the &quot;Heartbeat&quot;-themed tourist trade was seen as an important part of the local economy.

In January 2010, rumours were published that Sky might buy &quot;Heartbeat&quot; from ITV and take over its production. In February 2010, it was reported that Adam Crozier, the newly appointed ITV chief executive, would be responsible for making the decision about the future of the show. In March 2010, a survey was carried out by the &quot;Whitby Gazette&quot;, a newspaper local to the area in which the show is set, asking &quot;Do you think that popular ITV show &quot;Heartbeat&quot; should be axed after 16 years?&quot; 71% of respondents voted &quot;No&quot;, 19% voted &quot;Yes&quot; and 10% voted &quot;Don&#x27;t Care&quot;.

Series 18 was unusually protracted. Filming ran from May 2008 to May 2009. It premiered on 12 October 2008 and took a break after the sixth episode, then continued from 19 April 2009 to 14 June 2009. The last nine episodes were shown between 18 July 2010 and 12 September 2010 in the UK, but in Sweden on TV4 from 25 August 2009 to 4 September 2009, and in Denmark on TV 2 Charlie from 16 December 2009 to 24 December 2009. As of 3 January 2025, &quot;Heartbeat&quot; continues to be aired on TVO in Ontario, Canada.

During the period of uncertainty about the show&#x27;s future, ITV continued to maintain that reports of the show being &quot;axed&quot; were untrue, saying that production was &quot;taking a rest&quot; so that stockpiled episodes could be aired. However, on 25 June 2010, ITV finally confirmed that the show would be cancelled after series 18, with a spokesman saying &quot;&quot;Heartbeat&quot; has been an important part of the television landscape over the last 18 years and we are incredibly proud of what it achieved in its heyday as one of ITV1&#x27;s top rated dramas&quot;.

<doc id="868126" wikidata="Q2001106" url="?curid=868126" title="TetriNET">
<text>TetriNET is a multiplayer online &quot;Tetris&quot; game for up to six people that supports team play.

== History ==
Tetrinet was originally developed by St0rmCat in 1997, with its last official version as 1.13. The game was originally developed for Windows and was later ported to other systems.

St0rmCat released &quot;TetriNET 2&quot; in 2000, which features improved graphics, more types of special blocks, additional features (such as hold piece and block shadows), and a master server.

==Gameplay==
TetriNET plays like standard multiplayer Tetris but with a twist: clearing rows will cause special blocks to appear in the player&#x27;s field. If a line containing a special block is cleared, then that special block is added to the player&#x27;s inventory. Clearing multiple lines at once increases the number of special blocks received.

At any point, a player may use the special block at the beginning of their inventory on one of the six fields (either their own or an opponent&#x27;s). The effect depends on the type of special block:

* a : &quot;Add Line&quot; - Adds one broken line to the bottom of the target field.
* c : &quot;Clear Line&quot; - Clears the line on the bottom of the target field.
* b : &quot;Clear Special Blocks&quot; - Causes all special blocks on the target field to return to normal blocks.
* r : &quot;Random Blocks Clear&quot; - Random blocks are removed from the target field, often creating gaps in lines.
* o : &quot;Block Bomb&quot; - Causes any Block Bombs on the target field to &quot;explode&quot;, causing surrounding pieces to scatter throughout the field.
* q : &quot;Blockquake&quot; - Causes blocks on each line on the target field to shift, creating an earthquake-like effect.
* g : &quot;Block Gravity&quot; - Causes blocks on that target field to immediately fall into any gaps and instantly deletes any complete lines which are created.
* s : &quot;Switch Fields&quot; - User and target switch fields.
* n : &quot;Nuke Field&quot; - Removes all blocks from the target field.

The last player still able to place pieces in their field is the winner.

Depending on the server used, some alternative rules may be available.
* &quot;pure&quot;: special blocks are disabled, providing gameplay similar to traditional multiplayer Tetris.
* &quot;7tetris&quot;: the first player to make seven Tetris is the winner.

==Music==
The classic TetriNET download came with a single MIDI file that plays during game. This music is known as &quot;The Dance of the Spheres&quot; and its authorship is claimed by David Lilja, who was known as Davie M. Karlsson when he wrote the midi file.

== Variants ==

In addition to the rules implemented by the standard TetriNET 1.13 client, there are a number of variants available.

=== TetriFast ===
TetriFast removes the one second delay between pieces found in the standard TetriNET gameplay. As the piece delay is implemented client side, a trivial modification was made to the network protocol to prevent TetriFast clients connecting to standard TetriNET games.

=== TetriNET/TetriFast 1.14 ===
The 1.14 protocol is another variant, where every player will receive the same sequence of pieces.

=== Blocktrix ===
Blocktrix is an alternative TetriNET client for Windows. In addition to supporting traditional TetriNET and TetriFast protocols, it has a newer Blocktrix mode that includes a number of additional special block types:

* l : &quot;Left Gravity&quot; - Pulls all blocks as far left as possible, leaving any horizontal gaps at the right edge of the field.
* p : &quot;Piece Change&quot; - Changes the current piece.
* z : &quot;Zebra Field&quot; - Clears every second column of the field.

=== TetriNET2 ===
&quot;TetriNET2&quot; is a multiplayer &quot;Tetris&quot; game by the original creator of &quot;TetriNET&quot;. In addition to the special blocks found in the original TetriNET, it has five new ones:

* &quot;Immunity&quot; - Target cannot be affected by any special for a default of 15 seconds.
* &quot;Clear Column&quot; - Deletes a random column from the target field.
* &quot;Mutate Pieces&quot; - A certain number of the target&#x27;s next pieces (default 3) become large and awkwardly shaped.
* &quot;Darkness&quot; - Target cannot see anything on his field besides the current piece and its immediate surroundings for a default of 10 seconds.
* &quot;Confusion&quot; - Causes target&#x27;s controls to &quot;mix up&quot; for a default of 10 seconds (for example, the key that normally moves the piece left may start moving the piece right instead.)

In late 2007, like other clones, TetriNET2 was shut down per the request of The Tetris Company. The TetriNET2 website and servers became unavailable for several years. As of early 2010, TetriNET2 is back up and running (per request of many fans that are not satisfied with the lack of game development by The Tetris Company). The TetriNET2 website and servers have been recovered, relocated, and restored.

== Popularity and reception ==
With clients for various platforms available, the game was also well received in the Linux community. The Linux conference linux.conf.au even included a programming contest where contestants tried to program TetriNET playing bots, who could connect to the game server and play the game. The prize for the best bot was a A$40,000 IBM pSeries server. The game was also played in LAN parties. Game Revolution named Tetrinet as affordable alternative to Tetris.
In a 1999 review of The Next Tetris, Game Revolution named TetriNet as &quot;truer to its Tetris roots&quot; and &quot;If you want multi-player Tetris, the network based Tetrinet is much more fun.&quot;.

==Summary==

The Investment Advisers Act (IAA) was passed in 1940 to monitor those who, for a fee, advise people, pension funds, and institutions on investment matters. Impetus for passage of the act began with the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, which authorized the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to study investment trusts. The thrust of the study, which led to the passage of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act, was to provide a closer look at investment trusts and investment companies. The study, however, found many instances of investment adviser abuse, such as unfounded &quot;hot tips&quot; and questionable performance fees.

The IAA sought less to regulate investment advisers than to keep track of who was in the industry and their methods of operation. The IAA does not mandate qualifications for becoming an investment adviser but requires registration for those using the mails to conduct investment counseling business.

The IAA mandated all persons and firms receiving compensation for serving as investment advisers to register with the SEC. The requirement has been revised on several occasions since then, most notably with the passage of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. There are, however, several exceptions and exemptions to the registration requirement: investment advisers whose clients all reside in the same state as the adviser&#x27;s business office and who do not provide advice on securities listed on national exchanges; investment advisers whose clients are solely insurance companies; and certain investment advisers who manage solely private funds holding less than $100 million from US investors.

===Investment advisers covered===
A hallmark of the IAA is the required registration of virtually all investment advisers. Much verbiage, however, has gone into exactly what constitutes an investment adviser and corollary—investment advice. The act defines an investment adviser as &quot;any person who, for compensation, engages in the business of advising others, either directly or through publications or writings, as to the value of securities or as to the advisability of investing in, purchasing, or selling securities, or who for compensation and as part of a regular business, issues or promulgates analyses or reports concerning securities.&quot; The SEC further refined its definition of an adviser in its Release 1092, which stated that the &quot;giving of advice need not constitute the principal business activity or any particular portion of the business activities in order for a person to be an investment adviser.&quot; Release 1092 went on to state that the &quot;giving of advice need only be done on such a basis that it constitutes a business activity occurring with some regularity. The frequency of the activity is a factor, but is not determinative.&quot;

Whether or not a person is considered to be an investment adviser under the IAA generally depends on three criteria: the type of advice offered, the method of compensation, and whether or not a significant portion of the &quot;adviser&#x27;s&quot; income comes from proffering investment advice. Related to the last criterion is the consideration of whether or not a person leads others to believe that he or she is an investment adviser, such as by through advertising.

Under the Act, a person is generally considered to be an investment adviser by the offering of advice or the making of recommendations on securities as opposed to other types of investments. Securities may be defined under the act as including but not necessarily limited to notes, bonds, stocks (both common and preferred), mutual funds, money market funds, and certificates of deposit. The term &quot;securities&quot; does not generally include commodity contracts, real estate, insurance contracts, or collectibles such as works of art or rare stamps and coins. Even those who receive finder&#x27;s fees for referring potential clients to investment advisers are considered to be investment advisers themselves.

Generally excluded from coverage under the act are those professionals whose investment advice to clients is incidental to the professional relationship. The IAA exempts &quot;any lawyer, accountant, engineer, or teacher whose performance of such services is solely incidental to the practice of his profession.&quot; The key phrase is &quot;solely incidental.&quot; An accountant, for instance, who acts as an investment adviser is in fact considered to be an investment adviser under the Act. If professionals are not to be considered investment advisers under the IAA, they must not present themselves to the public as investment advisers, any investment advice given must be reasonably related to their primary professional function, and fees for the &quot;investment advice&quot; must be based on the same criteria as fees for the primary professional function.

The IAA, however, excludes from its definition of an investment adviser &quot;any broker or dealer whose performance of such [advisory] services is solely incidental to the conduct of his business as a broker or dealer and who receives no special compensation thereof.&quot; Banks, publishers, and government security advisers are also excepted from the Act. Those who call themselves &quot;financial planners&quot; may, under certain circumstances, be considered investment advisers under the Act. The difference between a financial planner and an investment adviser, as it relates to the IAA, is also addressed in the aforementioned Release 1092.

===Registration===

Under the Act, investment advisers must register using Form ADV accompanied by a relatively modest fee. Form ADV asks for such information as educational background, experience, exact type of business engaged in, assets, information on clients, history of a legal and/or criminal nature, and type of investment advice to be offered. Registration under the Act does not constitute an endorsement of the investment adviser, and the person or firm may not advertise as such. Part 2A and 2B of Form ADV forms the basis of the &quot;brochure&quot; that registered advisers must provide to clients. Part 3, also known as Form CRS, is a short relationship summary that also must be provided to clients.

Registered investment advisers are required to update their Form ADV at least annually. Advisers may receive compensation based on the performance of their advice only under prescribed circumstances, and they may not engage in excessive trading or profit from market activity resulting from their advice to clients. Investment advisers must also act in the best interest of their clients at all times and take into consideration their clients&#x27; financial positions and financial sophistication.

There are also many provisions in the Act dealing with fraud in terms of advertising, control of client assets, soliciting clients, and information disclosure.

<text>Cholangiography is the imaging of the bile duct (also known as the biliary tree) by x-rays and an injection of contrast medium.
==Types==
There are at least four types of cholangiography:

# Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC): Examination of liver and bile ducts by x-rays. This is accomplished by the insertion of a thin needle into the liver carrying a contrast medium to help to see blockage in liver and bile ducts.
# Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Although this is a form of imaging, it is both diagnostic and therapeutic, and is often classified with surgeries rather than with imaging.
# Primary cholangiography (or &quot;perioperative&quot;): Done in the operation room during a biliary drainage intervention.
# Secondary cholangiography: Done after a biliary drainage intervention.

In both cases fluorescent fluids are used to create contrasts that make the diagnosis possible. Cholangiography has largely replaced the previously used method of intravenous cholangiography (IVC).
* Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is another cholangiography method.

<text>Anammelech ( &quot;ʿAnammelekh&quot;), according to the Hebrew Bible, was a Syrian and Mesopotamian deity worshipped alongside Adrammelech. He is a lunar deity and is said to have been worshipped at Sepharvaim, an Assyrian town. Although some scholars have related him to the Mesopotamian god Anu based on the belief that his name means &quot;Anu is king&quot;, more recent scholarship understands the initial element of the name represents the masculine counterpart of the goddess Anat, as attested in Amorite personal names.

<doc id="868139" wikidata="Q286008" url="?curid=868139" title="Seconds Out">
<text>Seconds Out is the second live album by English progressive rock band Genesis. It was released as a double album on 14 October 1977 on Charisma Records, and was their first with touring drummer Chester Thompson and their last with guitarist Steve Hackett. The majority was recorded in June 1977 at the Palais des Sports in Paris during the Wind &amp; Wuthering Tour. One track, &quot;The Cinema Show&quot;, was recorded in 1976 at the Apollo in Glasgow during their A Trick of the Tail Tour.

&quot;Seconds Out&quot; received average to positive reviews upon its release, and reached No. 4 in the UK and No. 47 in the US. Hackett left the group to pursue a solo career while the album was being mixed, reducing Genesis to a core trio of keyboardist Tony Banks, guitarist/bassist Mike Rutherford, and drummer and singer Phil Collins. &quot;Seconds Out&quot; was reissued in 1994 and 2009, the latter as part of the &quot;Genesis Live 1973–2007&quot; box set.

==Background==

In July 1977, the Genesis line-up of lead singer and drummer Phil Collins, keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist Mike Rutherford, guitarist Steve Hackett, and touring drummer Chester Thompson finished a seven-month tour supporting &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; (1976). For their next step, the group began the process of selecting live recordings that they had assembled in 1976 and 1977 for an official release and their first since &quot;Genesis Live&quot; (1973).

&quot;Seconds Out&quot; is compiled mostly from the band&#x27;s four dates at the Palais des Sports in Paris between 12–14 June 1977. Collins said the group considered the recordings made that year were superior in quality than the ones taken a year prior, and that his singing and Banks&#x27;s keyboards sounded better compared to the previous tour. The run of shows in Paris allowed the band to spend more time on getting their performance and quality of the recordings right. One track, &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; was recorded at De Montfort Hall in Leicester on 21 January 1977 and &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; was recorded at the Apollo in Glasgow on 9 July 1976 during the A Trick of the Tail Tour which featured Bill Bruford on drums. Many songs have overdubbed vocals that Phil Collins recorded in a studio prior to the album&#x27;s release, including all of &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot;, &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot;, &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; and &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; and parts of &quot;Squonk&quot;, &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot; and &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot;.

Mixes of &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot;, Los Endos&quot;, &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot;, and &quot;White Mountain&quot; from 1976 were produced, but scrapped. The band recorded performances of &quot;Inside and Out&quot; (from the EP &quot;Spot the Pigeon&quot;), but were unable to get the song to sound as good as the studio version. &quot;I Know What I Like&quot; contains a snippet of the 1953 song &quot;I Love Paris&quot;.

===Hackett&#x27;s departure===
When &quot;Seconds Out&quot; was announced in the press on 8 October 1977, the news coincided with Hackett&#x27;s departure from Genesis. He had announced his decision to the group two months earlier while cuts for the album were selected and mixed. Collins recalled spotting Hackett on the street while on his way to the studio and offered him a lift, but Hackett declined. Collins found out from Banks and Rutherford that Hackett had quit. Hackett later said that if he had got in the car, Collins would have been the one person to make him reconsider.

==Release==
&quot;Seconds Out&quot; was released on 14 October 1977. Charisma Records organised an extensive promotional campaign for the album that included double page spreads in newspapers, window displays, colour posters, and commercials on national radio. In the US, the album was released by Atlantic Records. It peaked at No. 4 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 47 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Reception==
Hugh Fielder of &quot;Sounds&quot; gave the album five stars out of five. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; reporter Chris Welch, with assistance from Bob Gallagher, also praised the album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the contemporary incarnation of the band, noting they had &quot;less reliance on theatrics&quot; than before Peter Gabriel&#x27;s departure, &quot;and an added dollop of jazz-rock inclinations&quot;.

In their retrospective review, AllMusic wrote that Genesis&#x27;s renderings of songs from &quot;A Trick of the Tail&quot; and &quot;Wind &amp; Wuthering&quot; surpass the studio recordings, with &quot;superb vocals by Collins throughout,&quot; and drumming by Chester Thompson, which they described as &quot;at least a match for Collins&#x27; best playing.&quot; They considered the tracks from earlier albums to be weaker, however, finding Collins &quot;...can&#x27;t match the subtlety or expressiveness of Gabriel&#x27;s singing, though he comes close.&quot;

Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins has described &quot;Seconds Out&quot; as &quot;one of my drum bibles&quot; and &quot;one of my favorite-sounding drum records too&quot;.

==Reissues==
In 1994, a digitally remastered version was released on CD by Virgin Records in Europe and by Atlantic Records in the US. &quot;Seconds Out&quot; was reissued with new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes completed by Nick Davis and released as part of the &quot;Genesis Live 1973–2007&quot; box set in September 2009. On the original LP, &quot;Dance on a Volcano&quot; and &quot;Los Endos&quot; are banded as one track. This error was corrected on the box set. In November 2012, a 35th anniversary LP was pressed using the 2009 remix.

<text>Paul Dominique Laxalt ( ; August 2, 1922 – August 6, 2018) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 22nd governor of Nevada from 1967 to 1971 and a United States senator representing Nevada from 1974 until 1987. A member of the Republican Party, he was one of Ronald Reagan&#x27;s closest friends in politics. After Reagan was elected president in 1980, many in the national press referred to Laxalt as &quot;the first friend&quot;. He was the older brother of writer Robert Laxalt and maternal grandfather of Adam Laxalt, who served as the 33rd attorney general of Nevada from 2015 to 2019.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Laxalt was born on August 2, 1922, in Reno, Nevada. He was the son of Basque parents, Therese (née Alpetche) and Dominique Laxalt, who emigrated to the United States in the early 1900s from their homeland in the French Pyrenees. A shepherd, Dominique became wealthy in the sheep industry. After losing everything in the early 1920s, he returned to shepherding for the rest of his career. Therese, who had been trained at Paris&#x27;s &quot;Le Cordon Bleu&quot; cooking school, eventually opened a restaurant called The French Hotel in Carson City, Nevada.

Therese and Dominique had six children: Paul, Robert (born in 1923), Suzanne (1925), John (1926), Marie (1928) and Peter (1931). Robert became an author; Suzanne, a Roman Catholic nun; John, a lawyer and political consultant; Marie, a school teacher; and Peter (Mick), an attorney. The Laxalt children were raised largely by their mother, as Dominique spent long periods of time away from the household tending his sheep in the deserts and mountains of Nevada. The children all helped Therese at The French Hotel.

Paul played on the 1938 state basketball champion team at Carson High School before graduating and attending Santa Clara University. When World War II broke out, Paul joined the U.S. Army and served as a medic, seeing action in the Battle of Leyte in the Philippines. After the war, he graduated from the Sturm College of Law.

== Early career ==
After graduating from law school and after serving as a district attorney, Laxalt enjoyed a successful career as a lawyer. His clients included George Whittell, who owned a large portion of the Lake Tahoe frontage on the Nevada side of the lake, Harvey and Llewellyn Gross, who built and ran Harvey&#x27;s Wagon Wheel on Lake Tahoe&#x27;s south shore, and Dick Graves, founder of the Sparks Nugget. While representing Graves, Laxalt helped win the famous &quot;Golden Rooster case&quot; in which the federal government tried to confiscate a 15-pound solid gold rooster that Graves displayed near the entrance of his Golden Rooster restaurant.

==Political career==
Paul Laxalt&#x27;s first attempt for public office was in 1950 when he ran for District Attorney of Ormsby County, Nevada, turning out the incumbent D.A. He served from 1950 to 1954. Laxalt&#x27;s first run for statewide office came in 1962 when he ran for Lieutenant Governor against former Rep. Berkeley L. Bunker. Using innovative television ads and personal television appearances, Laxalt was able to introduce himself to the electorate, particularly in Southern Nevada where he was virtually unknown. In the middle of the campaign, at a Fourth of July rally in Las Vegas, Republican gubernatorial candidate and then-Lt. Gov. Rex Bell, a former Hollywood actor who had persuaded Laxalt to run with him on the GOP &quot;ticket&quot;, died of a heart attack. A great amount of pressure was applied to Laxalt to run in Bell&#x27;s place, but the young attorney demurred, and he remained in the lieutenant governor&#x27;s race. He ended up defeating Bunker by a comfortable margin. Laxalt served one term as lieutenant governor from 1963 to 1967.

===1964 U.S. Senate campaign===
In 1964, while serving as lieutenant governor, Laxalt ran for the United States Senate against freshman Democratic incumbent Sen. Howard Cannon. Laxalt had wanted to remain lieutenant governor. However, he declared his candidacy in mid-1964 after no other serious Republican contenders expressed interest. He did not have to give up his lieutenant governor&#x27;s post for this race, since he was not up for reelection until 1966.

Republican candidates, running concurrently with the 1964 federal election, were undermined by the unpopularity of Sen. Barry Goldwater from Arizona, the Republican nominee for President against incumbent Lyndon B. Johnson, and the leader of their political ticket. Not long before election day, Goldwater scheduled a visit to Las Vegas. Laxalt&#x27;s advisors told him he should &quot;duck&quot; Goldwater, as they feared any association with Goldwater would spell trouble. Laxalt, who often described Goldwater as his &quot;political Godfather&quot;, reportedly told his aides, &quot;Listen, Barry Goldwater is my friend. If I snubbed him now, I could never look him in the face again. I would rather lose.&quot; The Laxalt-Goldwater meeting on the tarmac was splashed on the front pages of local newspapers. (Goldwater lost Nevada by 28,000 votes.) Still, the Laxalt-Cannon race remained far closer than expected. As he watched the returns come in from his home in Carson City, Laxalt was stunned when one of the television networks actually declared him the winner. The next morning he flew to Las Vegas where he was told that certain precincts reported late and that Cannon had won by 48 votes, among the narrowest margins in a popular election for the U.S. Senate. The race was the subject of intense controversy for years.

===1966 Gubernatorial campaign===

Laxalt then decided to challenge two-term Governor Grant Sawyer. Although the election would not take place until November of 1966, Laxalt launched his campaign in the middle of 1965. One of the most hotly debated issues during the campaign was the federal government&#x27;s involvement in Nevada gaming operations. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Justice Department had deep suspicions about organized crime&#x27;s involvement in the gambling industry. Sawyer took the position that the federal government should stay out of Nevada&#x27;s affairs. Laxalt took the position that Nevada had to cooperate with &quot;the Feds&quot; in order to be in a position to regulate gambling credibly. (In fact, one of Laxalt&#x27;s first moves after his election was to meet with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover to express Nevada&#x27;s desire to establish a cooperative relationship.) During the gubernatorial campaign, Laxalt also led a movement to purge members of the John Birch Society from the state Republican Party. Laxalt defeated Sawyer by 5,937 votes. and served one term as governor, from January 1967 to January 1971.

===Governor of Nevada===
Laxalt&#x27;s tenure as governor was noteworthy for coinciding with the purchase of several hotel-casinos by reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes. Laxalt allowed Hughes to secure his gaming license without appearing before the state&#x27;s gaming regulatory authorities because he thought having an internationally acclaimed businessman involved in Nevada gaming would send a positive signal about the legitimacy of the industry. Laxalt also supported corporate ownership of gaming operations in Nevada, which helped pave the way for modern-day gambling. With the financial support of Hughes, Laxalt helped establish the state&#x27;s first community colleges and Nevada&#x27;s first medical school.

Along with Gov. Ronald Reagan of neighboring California, Laxalt helped create the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency, to protect scenic Lake Tahoe. He also expanded the park system and promoted prison reform in Nevada. On one occasion, Laxalt, against the advice of his staff, went to the Nevada State Penitentiary during a prisoner uprising. He met personally with several prisoners who described to the governor the deplorable conditions under which they were living. Laxalt sympathized with their concerns and ordered the prison staff to address the problems. When he was later asked by the media if he had qualms about entering the prison yard, Laxalt, a former trial lawyer, said, &quot;No, not really. Many of them were my former clients!&quot;

In 1970, Laxalt lobbied President Richard Nixon to reduce the prison sentence of notorious Teamster leader Jimmy Hoffa after Hoffa was convicted of attempting to bribe Sen. Howard Cannon, whom Laxalt had unsuccessfully challenged in 1964. While governor, Laxalt worked with Teamster officials on gambling investments in Nevada.

Laxalt governed Nevada as a fiscal conservative, but felt compelled to raise taxes at the outset of his administration because of the budget situation. Laxalt did not seek a second term. He bequeathed a budget surplus to his successor, Gov. Mike O&#x27;Callaghan. He left office saying that he had &quot;a gut-full&quot; of politics.

===U.S. Senator===
====Elections====
After leaving the governor&#x27;s mansion, Laxalt and his family opened a hotel/casino in Carson City. In 1974, when twenty-year Democratic incumbent Sen. Alan Bible announced his retirement, Republican political insiders pressed Laxalt to re-enter politics and seek the open U.S. Senate seat. He eventually agreed and wound up running against the Democratic nominee, then-Lt. Gov. Harry Reid. At that time the Watergate scandal was a burden for all Republicans running for national office in 1974. Nonetheless, early in the campaign, Laxalt enjoyed a consistent but tight lead over Reid in most polls. However, after President Gerald Ford pardoned former President Richard Nixon, Laxalt&#x27;s prospects, like Republican prospects everywhere, suddenly took a dramatic turn for the worse. Laxalt compared it to having &quot;a hundred pound weight around my neck.&quot; Still, he managed a victory by fewer than one thousand votes. To give Laxalt a leg-up in seniority, Sen. Bible resigned three weeks early on December 18, 1974. Gov. Mike O&#x27;Callaghan (Laxalt&#x27;s successor as governor) appointed Laxalt to finish out Bible&#x27;s term.

In 1980, Laxalt won re-election over former state Sen. Mary Gojack by 52,095 votes.

====Tenure====

In his first term in the United States Senate, Laxalt was active in many legislative battles. In 1977, he led the fight against President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s proposal to transfer the Panama Canal to the Panamanian government. Despite being in the minority in the Senate, Laxalt helped build a coalition opposed to the Panama Canal Treaties. Opponents successfully built a grassroots campaign designed to put pressure on the Senate. On the day of the vote, Laxalt was confident that he would be able to secure the 34 votes needed to defeat the treaties. However, his colleague, Sen. Howard Cannon (also from Nevada), decided to support the treaties. Even in defeat, Laxalt had won plaudits from both sides of the aisle for the manner in which he led the opposition. Indeed, throughout his Senate tenure, Laxalt remained popular among his colleagues, principally because he was viewed as a &quot;straight shooter&quot; and someone who never allowed political differences to turn personal. He was good friends with conservative Sen. Jesse Helms from North Carolina and liberal Sen. Ted Kennedy from Massachusetts. (At the request of Sen. Kennedy, Laxalt arranged to have President Ronald Reagan present Ethel Kennedy with the original copy of the medal honoring her late husband Robert F. Kennedy.)

During Laxalt&#x27;s two terms in the U.S. Senate, he served on several influential committees, including the Labor and Public Welfare Committee, the Appropriations Committee, and the Judiciary Committee. When Republicans took control of the Senate in 1981, Laxalt became chairman of the Judiciary Committee&#x27;s Regulatory Reform Subcommittee, and the Appropriations Committee&#x27;s State, Justice and Commerce Subcommittee. In 1986, while serving on the Judiciary Committee, Laxalt played a key behind-the-scenes role in securing the committee&#x27;s approval of President Reagan&#x27;s nomination of then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Negotiating principally with Sen. Ted Kennedy and Sen. Joe Biden from Delaware, Laxalt was able to strike a deal that allowed the committee to vote on the nomination. Rehnquist was subsequently approved by the full Senate by a margin of 65–33.

===Relationship with Ronald Reagan===
Laxalt had become close friends with Ronald Reagan during his time as governor, when Reagan was also in his first term as governor of neighboring California. They worked on many issues of mutual interest to both states, particularly those dealing with the preservation of Lake Tahoe. During Reagan&#x27;s presidency, Laxalt was sometimes referred to as &quot;The First Friend&quot;. Laxalt was national chairman of three Reagan presidential campaigns and placed Reagan&#x27;s name in nomination at the Republican National Conventions of 1976, 1980, and 1984. During the 1980 Republican National Convention, Laxalt&#x27;s name was floated as a potential vice presidential nominee for the Reagan ticket, but George H. W. Bush was chosen instead. At the behest of President Reagan, Laxalt served in the then-unprecedented role of General Chairman of the Republican Party from 1983 to 1987.
In fact, during Laxalt&#x27;s second Senate term, several Nevadans came to Washington, D.C., due in large measure to his relationship with Reagan, to serve in prominent governmental and campaign positions. His long-time aide, Barbara Vucanovich, had been elected to serve in the House in 1982, becoming the first female elected to a federal position from Nevada. A long-time friend and prominent Nevada trial attorney, Frank Fahrenkopf, was elected to serve as Chairman of the Republican National Committee where he helped oversee Reagan&#x27;s re-election and the 1988 election of President George H. W. Bush. Bob Broadbent of Boulder City became Assistant Secretary for Water and Science in the Department of the Interior; Bob Horton of Reno became Director of the Bureau of Mines; Cameron Batjer of Reno, a former Nevada Supreme Court Justice, served on the U.S. Sentencing Commission; Reese Taylor of Las Vegas served as Chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission; and Ed Allison of Reno, Sig Rogich of Las Vegas, and Ralph V. Whitworth of Winnemucca all served in key roles in Reagan&#x27;s 1984 re-election campaign. Laxalt&#x27;s former Press Secretary and Chief of Staff, Tom Loranger, joined Laxalt in his post-Senate government consulting practice and now runs the D.C. office of the Ferraro Group, a Nevada government-relations firm founded by former Laxalt aide Greg Ferraro. In early 1987, Laxalt was at the top of the short list to replace Donald Regan as White House Chief of Staff, but he declined because he intended to run for president in 1988. Instead, he recommended former U.S. Senate Majority Leader Majority Howard Baker, who took the job.

Pres. Reagan also relied on Laxalt to be his troubleshooter when it came to the precarious relationship with Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos. With Marcos&#x27; negative track record on human rights, kleptocratic governance, and erosion of democratic ideals and principles in the Southeast Asian country, and Marcos&#x27; penchant off-the-cuff remark that he and Reagan have a special relationship, it has become an embarrassment to the White House. Laxalt visited Manila in October 1985 to relay to Marcos that he should start work on some reforms to deal with the sinking Philippine economy as well as the Armed Forces of the Philippines - particularly the overstaying and overaged generals loyal to Marcos, beginning with Chief-of-Staff Gen. Fabian Ver. Despite Laxalt regaling Marcos of his World War II track record and experience during the liberation of the Philippines, the Philippine President rejected the call on retiring Gen. Ver. On the last night of the People Power Revolution, which saw the Marcoses ousted from power, Marcos phoned Laxalt to get a feel on how Reagan views the situation in Manila. Uncannily, Laxalt was in the middle of a top-secret briefing in Washington to discuss about the coup that was happening in the Philippines. Laxalt informed the Philippine President &quot;cut and cut cleanly. The time has come.&quot; Marcos responded that he was disappointed.

It was the 1976 Republican presidential race that may have cemented the tight political friendship between Laxalt and former-Gov. Reagan. In 1976, Reagan had decided to run for president, challenging President Gerald Ford for the Republican nomination. Ford enjoyed widespread support among the Republican establishment, particularly in Washington, D.C. Reagan decided that having Laxalt serve as his national chairman would give his campaign credibility it was otherwise lacking. Although Laxalt was not well known on a national level, he was well liked and respected in the U.S. Congress, and he was similarly respected by many prominent members of the national media. Laxalt eventually acceded to Reagan&#x27;s request, even though doing so severely jeopardized his relationship with the Ford White House. Laxalt campaigned all over the United States on behalf of Reagan, often campaigning by his side.

With his back to the wall, Reagan won shocking victories in North Carolina and Texas, which propelled the race all the way to the national convention in Kansas City. Laxalt nominated Reagan at the convention. Eventually, the Reagan campaign lost a key procedural vote to Ford and the sitting president eked out a victory. Although he was on the losing side, Laxalt&#x27;s national profile increased dramatically as a result of his efforts on behalf of Reagan. When Reagan defeated Democratic incumbent President Jimmy Carter in 1980, with Laxalt again serving as national chairman of Reagan&#x27;s campaign, Laxalt&#x27;s profile rose even higher.

====Sacramento &quot;Bee&quot; libel suit====
As a long-time public official in Nevada, where individuals with alleged ties to organized crime were prominent in the early Las Vegas gaming industry, Laxalt came under scrutiny for his relationships with certain individuals. In 1983, during Laxalt&#x27;s second Senate term and on the eve of Reagan&#x27;s re-election bid, the Sacramento &quot;Bee&quot; published two articles about Laxalt&#x27;s business dealings while his family owned the Ormsby House, a hotel-casino in Carson City, in the early 1970s. The articles claimed that certain Federal agents had alleged that the casino had been skimmed of profits while owned by the Laxalt family. Laxalt sued the &quot;Bee&quot; for libel, claiming that the articles&#x27; allegations were false, and that the implication that Laxalt associated with members of organized crime was defamatory. He also denied knowing about skimming activities and, in fact, denied that any skimming whatsoever had taken place.

Laxalt sought $250 million in damages. In 1987, the lawsuit was settled. In a statement, the &quot;Bee&quot; acknowledged that pretrial discovery &quot;had not shown that there was a skim&quot; at the Ormsby House. Laxalt declared that pretrial investigations had found no evidence of the wrongdoing at issue. The &quot;Bee&quot; maintained that it did not commit libel because it had not stated that Laxalt was involved in wrongdoing; it had merely reported that a third party held suspicions that wrongdoing had taken place at the Ormsby House. Under the settlement, the two sides agreed to allow the question of attorneys&#x27; fees to be decided by a panel of former federal judges.

In March 1988, after an extensive review, the judges awarded Laxalt $647,452.52 in fees and costs. One of the panelists, former U.S. Attorney General Griffin Bell, who had served under President Jimmy Carter, said that he would have preferred awarding $2 million, but he felt the final amount was &quot;fair.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot; described the judges&#x27; decision as a &quot;slap&quot; at the &quot;Bee&quot; newspapers. Laxalt was quoted as saying that the case had proven the &quot;Bee&quot;″s allegations to be without basis.

===1988 presidential election===
Laxalt retired from the Senate in 1987 and was replaced by the man he had defeated in 1974, Harry Reid, who would go on to become the Senate Majority Leader and the longest-serving U.S. Senator from Nevada. Laxalt made a brief run for the Republican presidential nomination for the 1988 election in 1987. The campaign lasted only four months after Laxalt determined that the effort had fallen short of its fundraising goals. Political commentators at the time concluded that he had waited too long to enter the race, which meant that not only did his competitors have a leg up in organization, but also many of the top political strategists and fundraisers had already signed on with other camps. He was eventually named a co-chairman of George H. W. Bush&#x27;s successful presidential campaign. Eight years later, he served in a similar capacity in Bob Dole&#x27;s failed presidential bid in the 1996 election.

==After politics==
Laxalt was a partner in the New York City-based law firm of Finley, Kumble, Wagner, Underberg, Manley, Myerson &amp; Casey and its successor law firm, Laxalt, Washington, Perito &amp; Dubuc. He later formed a small government consulting firm known as The Paul Laxalt Group. After his retirement from the U.S. Senate, Laxalt was named by President George H. W. Bush to a prestigious deficit reduction panel that consisted of current and former members of Congress and other prominent Americans. The commission eventually deadlocked on how best to address federal budget deficits. Laxalt was honored in various ways both during and after his public service career. The Paul Laxalt Mineral Engineering Center, an $11 million building that was completed in 1983, has been described as a giant step forward for the University of Nevada-Reno and the School of Mines. The 60,000-square-foot building houses classrooms and laboratories for mining engineering, chemical and materials engineering, and geological sciences. The Paul Laxalt State Building in Carson City was formerly the U.S. Post Office (built in 1891) and the first Federal building erected in Nevada. It is located in the center of Carson City&#x27;s Historic District.

One of Laxalt&#x27;s initiatives that gave him great personal satisfaction was the &quot;Intern&quot; program he established during his two terms in the United States Senate. The program was designed to bring college-age students to Washington, D.C., to work in Laxalt&#x27;s Senate office for the equivalent of a college semester. The program produced several individuals who went on to prominent careers in government and business, including Brian Sandoval, former Governor of Nevada.

On August 2, 2012, Governor Sandoval issued a proclamation declaring that date, Laxalt&#x27;s 90th birthday, as &quot;Paul Laxalt Day&quot; in the state of Nevada.

==Personal life==
Laxalt was married in 1946 to Jackalyn Ross (1927–2004), the daughter of John Rolly Ross, who was a federal judge in Nevada. The couple had five daughters (Gail, Sheila, Michelle, Kevin, and Kathleen) and one son (John Paul). They divorced in 1972. Laxalt was married to his second wife, Carol, until his death. She had one daughter (Denise) from a previous marriage. After he retired from the Senate, Paul and Carol Laxalt continued to reside in northern Virginia. Laxalt had twelve grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

In 1978, Laxalt&#x27;s daughter Michelle had a son, Adam Laxalt, with Laxalt&#x27;s then-Senate colleague, Pete Domenici of New Mexico. Michelle Laxalt raised Adam as a single parent. Adam Laxalt&#x27;s paternity was not publicly acknowledged by his parents until 2013. At that time, Domenici acknowledged that Laxalt was his son and was born as a result of an extramarital affair. Laxalt&#x27;s grandson Adam served as Attorney General of Nevada from 2015 to 2019. In the 2022 midterm elections, Adam narrowly lost his bid to unseat Catherine Cortez Masto, the incumbent United States Senator from Nevada.

===Death===
Laxalt died on August 6, 2018, at a health care facility in McLean, Virginia, four days after his 96th birthday.

Former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said in a statement after Laxalt&#x27;s death: “We came from different political parties and backgrounds, but that didn&#x27;t matter to Paul Laxalt. He was the epitome of a gentleman. He treated me, and everyone, with the utmost respect and friendship.&quot;

Nevada governor Brian Sandoval remarked that “Paul Laxalt was many things – a statesman, a gentleman and a class act – above all, he was a champion for his beloved Nevada and our country.&quot;

On September 6, 2018, a funeral service was held for Senator Laxalt at St. Matthew&#x27;s Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Attendees included former Vice President Dick Cheney, former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, former Attorney General Edwin Meese III and scores of Nevadans who made the trek to the nation&#x27;s capital to pay their last respects to Laxalt. Just before Thanksgiving, a memorial service took place at the Governor&#x27;s Mansion in Nevada&#x27;s capital and Laxalt&#x27;s hometown, Carson City. Speakers included Governor Sandoval, Greg Ferraro, Frank Fahrenkopf, Ed Allison and Sig Rogich. Attendees included former Governors Bob List, Richard Bryan and Bob Miller. In addition, several former Laxalt staff members attended including Doug Fuller, Robbie Aiken, Hal Furman and Gene Drakulich. A few weeks later, with family and close friends present, and in honor of his service during World War II, Laxalt was interred at Arlington National Cemetery. A 21-gun salute concluded the ceremony.

<text>An aperiodic tiling is a non-periodic tiling with the additional property that it does not contain arbitrarily large periodic regions or patches. A set of tile-types (or prototiles) is aperiodic if copies of these tiles can form only non-periodic tilings. 

The Penrose tilings are a well-known example of aperiodic tilings. 

In March 2023, four researchers, David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig S. Kaplan, and Chaim Goodman-Strauss, announced the proof that the tile discovered by David Smith is an aperiodic monotile, i.e., a solution to the einstein problem, a problem that seeks the existence of any single shape aperiodic tile. In May 2023 the same authors published a chiral aperiodic monotile with similar but stronger constraints.

Aperiodic tilings serve as mathematical models for quasicrystals, physical solids that were discovered in 1982 by Dan Shechtman who subsequently won the Nobel prize in 2011. However, the specific local structure of these materials is still poorly understood.

Several methods for constructing aperiodic tilings are known.

==Definition and illustration==

Consider a periodic tiling by unit squares (it looks like infinite graph paper). Now cut one square into two rectangles. The tiling obtained in this way is non-periodic: there is no non-zero shift that leaves this tiling fixed. But clearly this example is much less interesting than the Penrose tiling. In order to rule out such boring examples, one defines an aperiodic tiling to be one that does not contain arbitrarily large periodic parts.

A tiling is called aperiodic if its hull contains only non-periodic tilings. The hull of a tiling formula_1 contains all translates + &quot;x&quot; of &quot;T&quot;, together with all tilings that can be approximated by translates of &quot;T&quot;. Formally this is the closure of the set formula_2 in the local topology. In the local topology (resp. the corresponding metric) two tilings are formula_3-close if they agree in a ball of radius formula_4 around the origin (possibly after shifting one of the tilings by an amount less than formula_3).

To give an even simpler example than above, consider a one-dimensional tiling &quot;T&quot; of the line that looks like where &quot;a&quot; represents an interval of length one, &quot;b&quot; represents an interval of length two. Thus the tiling &quot;T&quot; consists of infinitely many copies of &quot;a&quot; and one copy of &quot;b&quot; (with centre 0, say). Now all translates of &quot;T&quot; are the tilings with one &quot;b&quot; somewhere and &quot;a&quot;s else. The sequence of tilings where &quot;b&quot; is centred at formula_6 converges – in the local topology – to the periodic tiling consisting of &quot;a&quot;s only. Thus &quot;T&quot; is not an aperiodic tiling, since its hull contains the periodic tiling 

For well-behaved tilings (e.g. substitution tilings with finitely many local patterns) holds: if a tiling is non-periodic and repetitive (i.e. each patch occurs in a uniformly dense way throughout the tiling), then it is aperiodic.

==History==

The first specific occurrence of aperiodic tilings arose in 1961, when logician Hao Wang tried to determine whether the domino problem is decidable – that is, whether there exists an algorithm for deciding if a given finite set of prototiles admits a tiling of the plane. Wang found algorithms to enumerate the tilesets that cannot tile the plane, and the tilesets that tile it periodically; by this he showed that such a decision algorithm exists if every finite set of prototiles that admits a tiling of the plane also admits a periodic tiling. In 1964, Robert Berger found an aperiodic set of prototiles from which he demonstrated that the tiling problem is in fact not decidable. This first such set, used by Berger in his proof of undecidability, required 20,426 Wang tiles. Berger later reduced his set to 104, and Hans Läuchli subsequently found an aperiodic set requiring only 40 Wang tiles. A smaller set, of six aperiodic tiles (based on Wang tiles), was discovered by Raphael M. Robinson in 1971. Roger Penrose discovered three more sets in 1973 and 1974, reducing the number of tiles needed to two, and Robert Ammann discovered several new sets in 1977. The number of tiles required was reduced to one in 2023 by David Smith, Joseph Samuel Myers, Craig S. Kaplan, and Chaim Goodman-Strauss.

The aperiodic Penrose tilings can be generated not only by an aperiodic set of prototiles, but also by a substitution and by a cut-and-project method. After the discovery of quasicrystals aperiodic tilings become studied intensively by physicists and mathematicians. The cut-and-project method of N.G. de Bruijn for Penrose tilings eventually turned out to be an instance of the theory of Meyer sets. Today there is a large amount of literature on aperiodic tilings.

An &quot;einstein&quot; (, one stone) is an aperiodic tiling that uses only a single shape. The first such tile was discovered in 2010 - Socolar–Taylor tile, which is however not connected into one piece. In 2023 a connected tile was discovered, using a shape termed a &quot;hat&quot;.

== Constructions ==

There are a few constructions of aperiodic tilings known. Some constructions are based on infinite families of aperiodic sets of tiles. The tilings which have been found so far are mostly constructed in a few ways, primarily by forcing some sort of non-periodic hierarchical structure. Despite this, the undecidability of the domino problem ensures that there must be infinitely many distinct principles of construction, and that in fact, there exist aperiodic sets of tiles for which there can be no proof of their aperiodicity. 

However, there are three principles of construction that have been predominantly used for finite sets of prototiles up until 2023:
* matching rules,
* substitution and expansion rules and
* the cut-and-project method.
For some tilings only one of the constructions is known to yield that tiling. Others can be constructed by all three classical methods, e.g. the Penrose tilings. 

Goodman-Straus proved that all tilings generated by substitution rules and satisfying a technical condition can be generated through matching rules. The technical condition is mild and usually satisfied in practice. The tiles are required to admit a set of &quot;hereditary edges&quot; such that the substitution tiling is &quot;sibling-edge-to-edge&quot;.

=== Aperiodic hierarchical tilings through matching===

For a tiling congruent copies of the prototiles need to pave all of the Euclidean plane without overlaps (except at boundaries) and without leaving uncovered pieces. Therefore the boundaries of the tiles forming a tiling need to match geometrically. This is generally true for all tilings, aperiodic and periodic ones. Sometimes these geometric matching condition is enough to force a tile set to be aperiodic, this is e.g. the case for Robinsion&#x27;s tilings discussed below.

Sometimes additional matching rules are required to hold. These usually involve colors or markings that have to match over several tiles across boundaries. Wang tiles usually require such additional rules. 

In some cases it has been possible to replace matching rules by geometric matching conditions altogether by modifying the prototiles at their boundary. The 
Penrose tiling (P1) originally consists of four prototiles together with some matching rules. One of the four tiles is a pentagon. One can replace this pentagon prototile by three distinct pentagonal shapes that have additional protrusions and indentations at the boundary making three distinct tiles. Together with the three other prototiles with suitably adapted boundaries one gets a set of six prototiles that essentially create the same aperiodic tilings as the original four tiles, but for the six tiles no additional matching rules are necessary, the geometric matching condition suffice.

Also note that Robinsion&#x27;s protiles below come equipped with markings to make it easier to visually recognize the structure, but these markings do not put more matching rules on the tiles as are already in place through the geometric boundaries.

To date, there is not a formal definition describing when a tiling has a hierarchical structure; nonetheless, it is clear that substitution tilings have them, as do the tilings of Berger, Knuth, Läuchli, Robinson and Ammann. As with the term &quot;aperiodic tiling&quot; itself, the term &quot;aperiodic &quot;hierarchical&quot; tiling&quot; is a convenient shorthand, meaning something along the lines of &quot;a set of tiles admitting only non-periodic tilings with a hierarchical structure&quot;.

For aperiodic tilings, whether additional matching rules are involved or not, the matching conditions forces some hierarchical structure on the tilings that in turn make period structures impossible.

Each of these sets of tiles, in any tiling they admit, forces a particular hierarchical structure. (In many later examples, this structure can be described as a substitution tiling system; this is described below). No tiling admitted by such a set of tiles can be periodic, simply because no single translation can leave the entire hierarchical structure invariant. Consider Robinson&#x27;s 1971 tiles:

Any tiling by these tiles can only exhibit a hierarchy of square lattices: the centre of any orange square is also a corner of a larger orange square, ad infinitum. Any translation must be smaller than some size of square, and so cannot leave any such tiling invariant.

Robinson proves these tiles must form this structure inductively; in effect, the tiles must form blocks which themselves fit together as larger versions of the original tiles, and so on.
This idea – of finding sets of tiles that can only admit hierarchical structures – has been used in the construction of most known aperiodic sets of tiles to date. 

However, the tiling produced in this way is not unique, not even up to isometries of the Euclidean group, e.g. translations and rotations. A complete tiling of the plane constructed from Robinsion&#x27;s tiles may or may not have &quot;faults&quot; (also called &quot;corridors&quot;) going off to infinity in up to four &quot;arms&quot; and there are additional choices that allow for the encoding of infinite words from Σω for an alphabet Σ of up to four letters. In summary there are uncountably many different tilings unrelated by Euclidean isometries, all of them necessarily nonperiodic, that can arise from the Robinsion&#x27;s tiles.

=== Substitutions ===

Substitution tiling systems provide a rich source of aperiodic tilings. A set of tiles that forces a substitution structure to emerge is said to enforce the substitution structure. For example, the chair tiles shown below admit a substitution, and a portion of a substitution tiling is shown at right below. These substitution tilings are necessarily non-periodic, in precisely the same manner as described above, but the chair tile itself is not aperiodic – it is easy to find periodic tilings by unmarked chair tiles that satisfy the geometric matching conditions.

However, the tiles shown below force the chair substitution structure to emerge, and so are themselves aperiodic.

The Penrose tiles, and shortly thereafter Amman&#x27;s several different sets of tiles, were the first example based on explicitly forcing a substitution tiling structure to emerge. Joshua Socolar, Roger Penrose, Ludwig Danzer, and Chaim Goodman-Strauss have found several subsequent sets. Shahar Mozes gave the first general construction, showing that every product of one-dimensional substitution systems can be enforced by matching rules. Charles Radin found rules enforcing the Conway-pinwheel substitution tiling system. In 1998, Goodman-Strauss showed that local matching rules can be found to force any substitution tiling structure, subject to some mild conditions.

=== Cut-and-project method ===

Non-periodic tilings can also be obtained by projection of higher-dimensional structures into spaces with lower dimensionality and under some circumstances there can be tiles that enforce this non-periodic structure and so are aperiodic. The Penrose tiles are the first and most famous example of this, as first noted in the pioneering work of de Bruijn. There is yet no complete (algebraic) characterization of cut and project tilings that can be enforced by matching rules, although numerous necessary or sufficient conditions are known.

=== Other techniques ===

Only a few different kinds of constructions have been found. Notably, Jarkko Kari gave an aperiodic set of Wang tiles based on multiplications by 2 or 2/3 of real numbers encoded by lines of tiles (the encoding is related to Sturmian sequences made as the differences of consecutive elements of Beatty sequences), with the aperiodicity mainly relying on the fact that 2&quot;n&quot;/3&quot;m&quot; is never equal to 1 for any positive integers &quot;n&quot; and &quot;m&quot;. This method was later adapted by Goodman-Strauss to give a strongly aperiodic set of tiles in the hyperbolic plane. Shahar Mozes has found many alternative constructions of aperiodic sets of tiles, some in more exotic settings; for example in semi-simple Lie groups. Block and Weinberger used homological methods to construct aperiodic sets of tiles for all non-amenable manifolds. Joshua Socolar also gave another way to enforce aperiodicity, in terms of &quot;alternating condition&quot;. This generally leads to much smaller tile sets than the one derived from substitutions.

==Physics==

Aperiodic tilings were considered as mathematical artefacts until 1984, when physicist Dan Shechtman announced the discovery of a phase of an aluminium-manganese alloy which produced a sharp diffractogram with an unambiguous fivefold symmetry – so it had to be a crystalline substance with icosahedral symmetry. In 1975 Robert Ammann had already extended the Penrose construction to a three-dimensional icosahedral equivalent. In such cases the term &#x27;tiling&#x27; is taken to mean &#x27;filling the space&#x27;. Photonic devices are currently built as aperiodical sequences of different layers, being thus aperiodic in one direction and periodic in the other two. Quasicrystal structures of Cd–Te appear to consist of atomic layers in which the atoms are arranged in a planar aperiodic pattern. Sometimes an energetical minimum or a maximum of entropy occur for such aperiodic structures. Steinhardt has shown that Gummelt&#x27;s overlapping decagons allow the application of an extremal principle and thus provide the link between the mathematics of aperiodic tiling and the structure of quasicrystals. Faraday waves have been observed to form large patches of aperiodic patterns. The physics of this discovery has revived the interest in incommensurate structures and frequencies suggesting to link aperiodic tilings with interference phenomena.

==Confusion regarding terminology==

The term &quot;aperiodic&quot; has been used in a wide variety of ways in the mathematical literature on tilings (and in other mathematical fields as well, such as dynamical systems or graph theory, with altogether different meanings). With respect to tilings the term aperiodic was sometimes used synonymously with the term non-periodic. A &quot;non-periodic&quot; tiling is simply one that is not fixed by any non-trivial translation. Sometimes the term described – implicitly or explicitly – a tiling generated by an aperiodic set of prototiles. Frequently the term aperiodic was just used vaguely to describe the structures under consideration, referring to physical aperiodic solids, namely quasicrystals, or to something non-periodic with some kind of global order.

The use of the word &quot;tiling&quot; is problematic as well, despite its straightforward definition. There is no single Penrose tiling, for example: the Penrose rhombs admit infinitely many tilings (which cannot be distinguished locally). A common solution is to try to use the terms carefully in technical writing, but recognize the widespread use of the informal terms.

<text>The Apology of Socrates (, &quot;Apología Sokrátous&quot;; ), written by Plato, is a Socratic dialogue of the speech of legal self-defence which Socrates (469–399 BC) spoke at his trial for impiety and corruption in 399 BC.

Specifically, the &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot; is a defence against the charges of &quot;corrupting the youth&quot; and &quot;not believing in the gods in whom the city believes, but in other &quot;daimonia&quot; that are novel&quot; to Athens (24b).

Among the primary sources about the trial and death of the philosopher Socrates, the &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot; is the dialogue that depicts the trial, and is one of four Socratic dialogues, along with &quot;Euthyphro&quot;, &quot;Phaedo&quot;, and &quot;Crito&quot;, through which Plato details the final days of the philosopher Socrates. There are debates among scholars as to whether we should rely on the &quot;Apology&quot; for information about the trial itself.

==The text of &quot;Apology&quot;==

The &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot;, by the philosopher Plato (429–347 BC), was one of many explanatory &quot;apologiae&quot; about Socrates&#x27;s legal defence against accusations of corruption and impiety; most &quot;apologiae&quot; were published in the decade after the Trial of Socrates (399 BC). As such, Plato&#x27;s &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot; is an early philosophic defence of Socrates, presented in the form of a Socratic dialogue. Although Aristotle later classified it as a genre of fiction, it is still a useful historical source about Socrates (469–399 BC) the philosopher. Aristotle believed the dialogue, particularly the scene where Socrates questions Meletus, represented a good use of interrogation.

Except for Socrates&#x27;s two dialogues with Meletus, about the nature and logic of his accusations of impiety, the text of the &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot; is in the first-person perspective and voice of the philosopher Socrates (24d–25d and 26b–27d). Moreover, during the trial, in his speech of self-defence, Socrates twice mentions that Plato is present at the trial (34a and 38b).

==Introduction==
The &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot; begins with Socrates addressing the jury of perhaps 500 Athenian men to ask if they have been persuaded by the Orators Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus, who have accused Socrates of corrupting the young people of the city and impiety against the pantheon of Athens.

Immediately after, Socrates protests his accusers for telling the audience to guard themselves against his eloquence. He claims that his use of language will be extemporaneous, in his own common manner of interrogating highly respected Athenians, and that he himself is a stranger in the ways of court unaccustomed to giving ornamented speech. Socrates later argues that whatever wisdom he does in fact possess comes from knowing that he knows nothing (23b, 29b).

In the course of the trial, Socrates imitates, parodies, and corrects the Orators, his accusers, and asks the jury to judge him by the truth of his statements, not by his oratorical skill (&quot;cf&quot;. Lysias XIX 1,2,3; Isaeus X 1; Isocrates XV 79; Aeschines II 24). Socrates says he will not use sophisticated language—carefully arranged ornate words and phrases—but will speak using the common idiom of the Greek language. Socrates says that he will speak in the manner he has used in the &quot;agora&quot; and at the money tables. Although offered the opportunity to appease the prejudices of the jury, with a minimal concession to the charges of corruption and impiety, Socrates does not yield his integrity to avoid the penalty of death. The jury condemns Socrates to death.

==Accusers of Socrates==
In the society of 5th-century BC Athens, the three men who formally accused the philosopher Socrates of impiety and corruption against the people and the city, officially represented the interests of the politicians and the craftsmen, of the scholars, poets, and rhetoricians. The accusers of Socrates were:

* Anytus, a rich and socially prominent Athenian who opposed the Sophists on principle. Socrates says that Anytus joined the prosecution because he was &quot;vexed on behalf of the craftsmen and politicians&quot; (23e–24a); moreover, Anytus appears in the &quot;Meno&quot; dialogue (90f). Whilst Socrates and Meno (a visitor to Athens) are discussing Virtue, Anytus unexpectedly appears before them, and overhears their conversation. From the philosophic stance that virtue cannot be taught, Socrates adduces that many socially prominent Athenians have produced sons who are inferior to themselves, as fathers; Socrates names several such men, including Pericles and Thucydides. In the event, Anytus is offended by the observation, and warns Socrates that stepping on people’s toes (&quot;kakós legein&quot;) could, someday, cause trouble for him (Meno 94e–95a).
* Meletus, the only accuser to speak during Socrates&#x27;s speech of self-defence; he was the tool of Anytus, the true enemy of Socrates. Socrates says that Meletus joined the prosecution because he was &quot;vexed on behalf of the poets&quot; (23e); moreover, Meletus features in the &quot;Euthyphro&quot; dialogue. At trial, Socrates identifies Meletus as an unknown, young man with an aquiline nose. In the &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot;, Meletus agrees to be cross-examined by Socrates, whose questions lead Meletus into a semantic trap. Inattentive to the logical implications of his accusations of corruption and impiety, Meletus contradicts himself in accusing Socrates of atheism and of believing in demigods.
*Lycon, who represented the professional rhetoricians as an interest group. Socrates says that Lycon joined the prosecution because he was &quot;vexed on behalf of the rhetoricians&quot; (24a). That he joined the prosecution because he associated Socrates with the pro–Spartan Oligarchy of the Thirty Tyrants (404 BC), who killed his son, Autolycus. As a prosecutor of Socrates, Lycon also is a figure of ridicule in a play by Aristophanes and had become a successful democratic politician in the democracy restored after the fall of the Oligarchy of the Four Hundred (411 BC).

;The accusations
In his defence at trial, Socrates faced two sets of accusations: (i) &quot;asebeia&quot; (impiety) against the pantheon of Athens, by introducing new gods; and (ii) corruption of Athenian youth. Socrates says to the court that these old accusations arise from years of gossip and prejudice against him; hence, are matters difficult to address. He then summarizes in his own words the accusations from the orators against him in legal form: &quot;Socrates is an evil-doer, and a curious person, who searches into things under the earth and in heaven, and he makes the worse appear the better cause; and he teaches the aforesaid doctrines to others&quot; (19b-c).

Socrates also says that the accusations for which he is answering in court already had been spoken and published by the comic poet Aristophanes, and are therefore beyond the legal scope of a trial for corruption and impiety. Years earlier, in the play &quot;The Clouds&quot; (423 BC), Aristophanes lampooned Socrates as a charlatan, the paradigm philosopher of atheist and scientific sophistry—carefully arranged arguments constructed of ornate words and phrases—misrepresented as wisdom. In light of that definition, Socrates defensively argues that he cannot be mistaken for a Sophist philosopher because Sophists are wise men, are thought to be wise by the people of Athens, and, thus, are highly paid for their teaching; whereas he (Socrates) lives in ten-thousand-fold poverty, and knows nothing noble and good (23c).

;Impiety
For his self-defence, Socrates first eliminates any claim that he is a wise man. He says that Chaerephon, reputed to be impetuous, went to the Oracle of Delphi and asked her, the prophetess, Pythia, to tell him of anyone wiser than Socrates. The Pythia answered to Chaerephon that there was no man wiser. On learning of that oracular pronouncement, Socrates says he was astounded, because, on the one hand, it is against the nature of the Oracle to lie, but, on the other hand, he knew he was not wise. Therefore, Socrates sought to find someone wiser than himself, so that he could take that person as evidence to the Oracle at Delphi. Hence why Socrates minutely queried everyone who appeared to be a wise person. In that vein, he tested the minds of politicians, poets, and scholars, for wisdom; although he occasionally found genius, Socrates says that he found no one who possessed wisdom; yet, each man was thought wise by the people, and each man thought himself wise; therefore, he thought he was the better man, because he was aware that he was not wise.

;Corruption of the Athenian youth

Socrates explained that the young, rich men of the city of Athens have little to do with their time. They, therefore, follow him about the city, observing his questioning of the arguments made by other Athenians and their exposed ignorance of their own pretensions. In turn, young men imitate the method of Socrates. Socrates thought that the arguments of the men he examined were wanting, and when he said this, to not lose face, they would restate stock accusations against Socrates; that he is a morally abominable man who corrupts the youth of Athens with sophistry and atheism. In his defence, Socrates said: &quot;For those who are examined, instead of being angry with themselves, are angry with me!&quot;.

==The dialogue==

The &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot;, by Plato, is a Socratic dialogue in three parts that cover the Trial of Socrates (399 BC): (i) the legal self-defence of Socrates, (ii) the verdict of the jury, and (iii) the sentence of the court.

===Part one: The defence of Socrates===
Socrates begins his legal defence by telling the jury that their minds were poisoned by his enemies when they (the jury) were young and impressionable. He also says that his false reputation as a sophistical philosopher comes from his enemies and that all of them are malicious, yet must remain nameless—except for the playwright Aristophanes, who lampooned him (Socrates) as a charlatan-philosopher in the comedy play &quot;The Clouds&quot; (423 BC). About corrupting the rich, young men of Athens, Socrates argues that deliberate corruption is an illogical action because it would hurt him, as well. He says that the accusations of him being a corrupter of youth began at the time of his obedience to the Oracle at Delphi, and tells how Chaerephon went to the Oracle, to ask her, the Pythian prophetess, if there was a man wiser than Socrates. When Chaerephon reported to him that the Oracle said there is no wiser man, Socrates interpreted that divine report as a riddle—because he was aware of possessing no wisdom &quot;great or small&quot;, and that lying is not in the nature of the gods.

;The wisest man

Socrates then sought to solve the divine paradox—how an ignorant man also could be the wisest of all men—in effort to illuminate the meaning of the Oracles&#x27; categorical statement that he is the wisest man in the land. After systematically interrogating the politicians, the poets, and the craftsmen, Socrates determined that the politicians were not wise like he was. He says of himself, in reference to a politician: &quot;I am wiser than this man; it is likely that neither of us knows anything worthwhile, but he thinks he knows something when he does not.&quot;(21d). Socrates says that the poets did not understand their poetry; that the prophets and seers did not understand what they said; and that the craftsmen while knowing many things, thought they also had much knowledge on things of which they had none. In that light, Socrates saw himself as a spokesman for the Oracle at Delphi (22e). He asked himself if he would rather be an impostor, like the &quot;wise people&quot; he interrogated, or if he would rather be himself, Socrates of Athens. Socrates tells the jury that he would rather be himself than be anyone else. He says that in searching for a man wiser than himself, he came to be regarded as a social gadfly and acquired a bad reputation among Athens&#x27; politically powerful personages.

;Corrupter of youth

Having addressed the social prejudices against him, Socrates addresses the first accusation—the moral corruption of Athenian youth—by accusing his accuser, Meletus, of being indifferent to the persons and things about which he professes to care. Whilst interrogating Meletus, Socrates says that no one would intentionally corrupt another person—because the corrupter later stands to be harmed in vengeance by the corrupted person. The matter of moral corruption is important for two reasons: (i) the accusation is that Socrates corrupted the rich, young men of Athens by teaching atheism; (ii) that if he is convicted of corruption, it will be because the playwright Aristophanes already had corrupted the minds of his audience, when they were young, by lampooning Socrates as the &quot;Sophistical philosopher&quot; in &quot;The Clouds&quot;, a comic play produced about twenty-four years earlier.

;Atheist

Socrates then addresses the second accusation—&quot;asebeia&quot; (impiety) against the pantheon of Athens—by which Meletus says that Socrates is an atheist. In cross-examination, Socrates leads Meletus to contradict himself: that Socrates is an atheist who also believes in spiritual agencies and demigods. Socrates tells the judges that Meletus has contradicted himself and then asks if Meletus has designed a test of intelligence for identifying logical contradictions.

On death

Socrates proceeds to say that people who fear death are showing their ignorance, because death might be a good thing, yet people fear it as if it is evil; even though they cannot know whether it is good or evil. Socrates says that his wisdom is in being aware that he is ignorant on this, and other topics.

;Precedence of authority

Regarding a citizen&#x27;s obedience to authority, Socrates says that a lawful authority, either human or divine, should always be obeyed. In a conflict of obedience to such authorities, he thinks that obeying divine authority supersedes obeying human authority: &quot;Gentlemen, I am your grateful and devoted servant, but I owe a greater obedience to the [Delphic] god than to you; and, as long as I draw breath and have my faculties, I shall never stop practising philosophy&quot;(29d). As a spokesman for the Oracle at Delphi, he is to spur the Athenians to greater awareness of ethics and moral conduct and always shall question and argue. Therefore, the philosopher Socrates of Athens asks his fellow citizens: &quot;Are you not ashamed that you give your attention to acquiring as much money as possible, and similarly with reputation and honour, and give no attention or thought to truth and understanding, and the perfection of your soul?&quot;(29e)

;Provocateur

Granting no concession to his precarious legal situation, Socrates speaks emotionally and provocatively to the court and says that the greatest good to occur upon Athens is his moral concern for them as fellow citizens. He thinks that material wealth is a consequence of goodness; that the god does not permit a better man to be harmed by a lesser man; and that he is the social gadfly required by Athens: &quot;All day long, I will never cease to settle here, there, and everywhere — rousing, persuading, and reproving every one of you.&quot; In support of the moral mission assigned him by the Oracle at Delphi, Socrates tells the court that his &quot;daimonion&quot; continually forbids him to act unethically (implicitly validating Meletus&#x27; accusation that Socrates believes in novel deities not of the Athenian pantheon).

Socrates says he never was a paid teacher; therefore, he is not responsible for the corruption of any Athenian citizen. If he had corrupted anyone, he asks: why have they not come forward to bear witness? If the corrupted Athenians are ignorant of having been corrupted, then why have their families not spoken on their behalf? Socrates indicates, in point of fact, relatives of the Athenian youth he supposedly corrupted are present in court, giving him moral support.

Socrates concludes his legal defence by reminding the judges that he shall not resort to emotive tricks and arguments, shall not cry in public regret, and that his three sons will not appear in court to pathetically sway the judges. Socrates says he is not afraid of death and shall not act contrary to religious duty. He says he will rely solely upon sound argument and truth to present his case at trial.

Rhetoric

In Plato&#x27;s version of the trial, Socrates mocks oratory as a deceitful rhetorical practice designed to lead jurors away from the truth. Some scholarship, however, views this mockery only as a critique of narrow views of rhetoric-as-speechmaking and, in turn, sees the whole trial as an implicit depiction of a more expansive view of rhetoric that unfolds over the course of a lifetime.

===Part two: Socrates&#x27; sentencing plea===
The jurors of the trial voted the guilt of Socrates by a relatively narrow margin (36a). In the &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot;, Plato cites no total numbers of votes condemning or acquitting the philosopher of the accusations of moral corruption and impiety; Socrates says that he would have been acquitted if thirty more jurors had voted in his favour. This would likely mean that if the court were composed of 500 people then 280 voted against Socrates and 220 voted in his favor. This would make the margin about 12 percent. In such cases—where the penalty of death might arise as a legal sanction for the accusations is presented—Athenian law required that the prosecutor and the defendant each propose an administrative penalty to punish the actions reported in the accusations.

Socrates antagonises the court by proposing, rather than a penalty, a reward—perpetual maintenance at public expense. He notes that the vote of judgement against him was close. In that vein, Socrates then engages in dark humour, suggesting that Meletus narrowly escaped a great fine for not meeting the statutory requirement of receiving one-fifth of the votes of the assembled judges in favour of his accusations against Socrates. In that way, Socrates published the financial consequence for Meletus to consider as a plaintiff in a lawsuit—because the Athenian legal system discouraged frivolous lawsuits by imposing a financially onerous fine upon the plaintiff if the vote of the judges was less than one-fifth of the number of judges required by the type of lawsuit.

As punishment for the two accusations formally presented against him at trial, Socrates proposed to the court that he be treated as a benefactor to the city of Athens; that he should be given free meals, in perpetuity, at the Prytaneum, the public dining hall of Athens. Receiving such public &quot;largesse&quot; is an honour reserved for Olympic athletes, prominent citizens, and benefactors of Athens, as a city and as a state.

Finally, after the court dismisses the proposed reward—free meals at the Prytaneum—Socrates considers imprisonment and banishment, before settling upon a punishment fine of 100 drachmae. Despite his poverty, this was a minor punishment compared to the death penalty proposed by the prosecutors, and encouraged by the judges of the trial. His supporters, Plato, Crito, Critobulus, and Apollodorus offered even more money to pay as a fine—3,000 drachmae (thirty minae); nonetheless, to the judges of the trial of Socrates, a pecuniary fine was insufficient punishment.

===Part three: Socrates&#x27; departing remarks===
In the Trial of Socrates, the judgement of the court was death for Socrates; most of the jurors voted for the death penalty (&quot;Apology&quot; 38c), yet Plato provides no jury-vote numbers in the text of the &quot;Apology of Socrates&quot;; but Diogenes Laërtius reports that 280 jurors voted for the death penalty and 220 jurors voted for a pecuniary fine for Socrates (2.42). Moreover, the politically provocative language and irreverent tone of Socrates&#x27;s self-defence speech angered the jurors and invited their punishment of him.

Socrates responds to the death-penalty verdict by first addressing the jurors who voted for his death. He says that instead of waiting a short time for him to die from old age, they will now have to accept the harsh criticisms from his supporters. He prophesied that his death will cause the youngsters to come forward and replace him as a social gadfly, spurring ethical conduct from the citizens of Athens, in a manner more vexing than him(39d).

To the jurors who voted to acquit him, Socrates gives encouragement: his supernatural &quot;daimonion&quot; did not interfere with his conduct of the legal defence, which he viewed as a sign that such a defence was the correct action. In that way, the &quot;daimonion&quot; communicated to Socrates that death might be a good thing; either death is annihilation (release from earthly worry) and not to be feared, or death is migration to a higher plane of existence in which reside the souls of personages and heroes, such as Hesiod and Homer and Odysseus.

Socrates concludes his self-defence by saying to the court that he bears no ill-will, neither towards his accusers—Lycon, Anytus, and Meletus—nor the jurors. He then asks the Athenians to correct his three sons if they value material wealth more than living virtuously, or if they become too prideful; and in doing that, justice will finally be served.

<doc id="868159" wikidata="Q507863" url="?curid=868159" title="Gwar">
<text>Gwar, often stylized as GWAR, is an American heavy metal band formed in Richmond, Virginia, in 1984, composed of and operated by a frequently rotating line-up of musicians, artists, and filmmakers collectively known as Slave Pit Inc. Since the death of frontman Dave Brockie in 2014, the collective has continued recording and performing without any of its founding artists or musicians.

Identified by their distinctively grotesque costumes, Gwar&#x27;s core thematic and visual concept revolves around an elaborate science fiction-themed mythology which portrays the band members as barbaric medieval nordic, mythological, biblical or interplanetary warriors, a narrative which serves as the basis for all of the band&#x27;s albums, live shows and media. With over-the-top violent, sexual, and scatological humor typically incorporating social and political satire, Gwar has attracted both acclaim and controversy for its music and stage shows, the latter of which notoriously showcase enactments of graphic violence that result in the audience being sprayed with fake blood, urine, and semen. Such stagecraft regularly leads Gwar to be labeled a &quot;shock rock&quot; band by the media.

Since its formation, Gwar has released 15 studio albums, two live albums, and numerous singles among other recordings, and has sold over 820,000 records in the United States. Fueled largely by the controversies surrounding their concerts, Gwar experienced brief mainstream notoriety during the first half of the 1990s, receiving regular airplay on MTV as well as frequent in-character guest appearances on daytime talk shows, satirizing the topics of censorship and media violence. Though the band&#x27;s mainstream popularity declined by the end of the 1990s, Gwar has retained a dedicated cult following. The band&#x27;s extensive videography consists of both live recordings and long-form feature films, most notably 1992&#x27;s &quot;Phallus in Wonderland&quot;, which earned a Grammy Award nomination for Best Long Form Music Video. Gwar has also expanded its brand into other areas such as books, comic books board games, beer, whisky, barbecue sauce, CBD, e-liquids, toy collectibles, and sex toys.

==History==
===Formation and debut (1984–1989)===
Gwar is the result of two separate projects merged into one. Dave Brockie was the vocalist and bassist for a punk band named Death Piggy that staged mini-plays and used crude props to punctuate its music. Bands would occasionally practice in a room at the Richmond Dairy, a deserted bottling plant that had been taken over by hippies. The hippies rented out interior areas to various artists and musicians. It was at the Richmond Dairy that Death Piggy met Hunter Jackson (Techno Destructo) and Chuck Varga (Sexecutioner), both attendees of Virginia Commonwealth University who had set up &quot;The Slave Pit&quot;, a production space for &quot;Scumdogs of the Universe&quot;, a movie they intended to make. 

Jackson created props for Death Piggy to use on stage. Brockie had an idea to use the costumes made for &quot;Scumdogs of the Universe&quot; and have Death Piggy open for itself as a barbaric band from Antarctica, playing nonsense songs while sacrificing fake animals. The name of the joke group was &quot;Gwaaarrrgghhlllgh&quot;. The members of Death Piggy began noticing that more people were coming to see Gwaaarrrgghhlllgh and leaving immediately after the set. After several refinements, including shortening the band&#x27;s name, Death Piggy was phased out in favor of the band now named Gwar.
The first known line-up for Gwar consisted of Ben Eubanks (vocals), Brockie (guitar), Steve Douglas (guitar), Chris Bopst (bass guitar), Jim Thomson (drums) and Jackson. However, this line-up was short-lived and would suffer multiple changes in the following months, with Eubanks quitting after just one or two shows and being replaced by Joe Annaruma, who went on to record several demo tracks with the band. Annaruma quit soon after this, and Brockie became the main vocalist for the band. The band solidified into a line-up consisting of Jackson, Don Drakulich, Varga, Mike Delaney, Mike Bonner, Scott Krahl, Dave Musel and Brockie. 

Mike Delaney left in 1987. Dewey Rowell (Flattus Maximus), Michael Bishop (Beefcake the Mighty) and Rob Mosby (Nippleus Erectus) were recruited in 1987, along with Steve Douglas (Balsac the Jaws of Death), who rejoined the band after having previously left. Danielle Stampe (alias: Slymenstra Hymen) joined in 1988 as the first full-time female member of Gwar for the first U.S. tour supporting Gwar&#x27;s debut album &quot;Hell-O&quot; and toured consistently with the band until 2000. The band has also recruited, and lost, three other female members: The Temptress, Heather Broome (1986); Amazina, Colette Miller (1986–87); and Gwar Woman, Lisa Harrelson (1987–88).

The band&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Hell-O&quot;, a crossover thrash metal-punk rock album, was released in 1988 under Shimmy Disc. The band started touring in support of the album, with Steve Douglas leaving that same year, later to form the alternative band Log, and being replaced by current rhythm guitarist Michael Derks, who took over Douglas&#x27; alias as Balsac the Jaws of Death.

However, the band&#x27;s line-up underwent further changes before 1990. In 1988, the Slave Pit saw the joining of Bob Gorman, a young, new artist who would help with the art design and fabrication aspects of the band. One year later, in 1989, Rob Mobsy left the band and was replaced by Pete Luchter, who also quit to be replaced temporarily by Jim Thompson, who had been in the band prior to the release of &quot;Hell-O&quot;. Thompson later quit and was replaced by Brad Roberts, who has since portrayed Jizmak Da Gusha.

===&quot;Scumdogs of the Universe&quot; and &quot;This Toilet Earth&quot; (1990–1994)===
With Gwar&#x27;s line-up somewhat solidified, the band would set up to record &quot;Scumdogs of the Universe&quot; released worldwide on producer Ivan Healy Purvis&#x27; label Master Records, a subsidiary of Blue Beat Records. The album met a moderately large mainstream success and would mark the start of a career under the Metal Blade Records record label. The band would tour extensively in support for this album, releasing the &quot;Live from Antarctica&quot; produced by Ivan Healy Purvis, VHS tape in July 1990, containing, among other things, the music video for the song &quot;Sick of You&quot;. It was shortly after the video&#x27;s release when the Slave Pit took in another new, young artist, Matt Maguire, to help out with costume fabrication, as well as illustrations for comics and related material.

In August 1990, the birth of Michael Derks&#x27;s daughter resulted in his taking a short break from the band. Barry &#x27;D&#x27;live&#x27; Ward from the band Rich Kids on LSD filled in on guitar as Balsac during Gwar&#x27;s 1991 European tour. On September 18, 1990, Brockie wore his &quot;Cuttlefish of Cthulhu&quot; codpiece during a show in Charlotte, North Carolina, resulting in Brockie&#x27;s arrest and, ultimately, a one-year ban from the band performing in the state of North Carolina - the band would later highlight the absurdity of the case by pointing out that the presiding judge over the case was called Dick Boner. Upon returning home, Gwar filmed its first cameo in a mainstream film, &quot;Mystery Date&quot;.

&quot;Scumdogs of the Universe&quot; was originally released through the U.K. label Master before being picked up by Metal Blade in 1991. In the group&#x27;s hunt for a larger label, they auditioned for Relativity Records, one of the larger independent heavy metal labels. The group failed their audition when they arrived in costume and Slymenstra Hymen broke a blood capsule from her codpiece onto one of the office chairs, simulating menstruation.

The band suffered further line-up changes during this period, with Dewey Rowell leaving the band in 1991 and not being replaced until 1992 by Pete Lee, after the recording of &quot;America Must Be Destroyed&quot;. The Charlotte, North Carolina incident from 1990 was the inspiration for Gwar&#x27;s third album, &quot;America Must Be Destroyed&quot;, released in 1992. The album was accompanied by the movie &quot;Phallus in Wonderland&quot;, which documented the main concept and contained music videos for the album. &quot;Phallus in Wonderland&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in 1993. After recording for &quot;This Toilet Earth&quot; was completed, bassist Mike Bishop left the band. He was replaced by Casey Orr, from the band Rigor Mortis.

&quot;This Toilet Earth&quot; was released in 1994, to moderate success. The album received additional attention due to controversy surrounding &quot;B.D.F.&quot;, a song that graphically refers to subjects such as sodomy, necrophilia, pre-natal rape, pedophilia and mutilation. 1994 also saw the music videos for &quot;Saddam a Go-Go&quot; and &quot;The Road Behind&quot; being aired on &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;. This would also mark the beginning of the band straying from their trademark sound, as the album contained several experimental songs as opposed to the punk of &quot;Hell-O&quot; and thrash of &quot;Scumdogs of the Universe&quot;.

===&quot;Ragnarok&quot;, &quot;Carnival of Chaos&quot; and &quot;We Kill Everything&quot; (1995–2000)===

In 1995, Gwar released &quot;Ragnarok&quot;, an album characterized by a unique sound, including the use of keyboards, something largely unseen before by the band, as well as a much larger use of secondary vocalists. The record is considered to have been largely unnoticed after the success of the previous three albums. Despite this, the band would record two videos for the album, &quot;Surf of Syn&quot; and &quot;Meat Sandwich&quot; as well as release &quot;Rendezvous with Ragnarok&quot; to support the album&#x27;s plot through footage from the supporting tour. Later that year, the band also made a cameo appearance in the film &quot;Empire Records&quot;.

The band&#x27;s first side project, X-Cops, would also come to life after the Ragnarok tour, releasing their only full-length album, &quot;You Have the Right to Remain Silent...&quot;, the same year.

&quot;Doom&quot; developer, id Software, hired Gwar to produce a showcase space at Microsoft&#x27;s Judgement Day event for Halloween of 1995.

Gwar appeared in a video game focused Circuit City television advertisement in 1996.

The band&#x27;s next record would come out in 1997 under the name &quot;Carnival of Chaos&quot;, proving to be the epitome of this experimental period containing songs from many different genres, including the classic heavy metal, but also hard rock, country, and even jazz. Shortly after the release of &quot;Carnival of Chaos&quot;, select members of the Gwar ensemble appeared on &quot;The Jerry Springer Show&quot; to discuss the growing trend of &quot;shock rock&quot; and their role as entertainers. Aside from their appearance on &quot;The Joan Rivers Show&quot;, this guest appearance is still recognized as one of their most infamous appearances on national TV. In 1998, Gwar fought the ska band, The Aquabats!, during The Ska Parade.

&quot;Carnival of Chaos&quot; would be the last album with Pete Lee on guitar, being replaced by Tim Harriss who had previously been in the band around 1986 and was featured as a guest guitarist on &quot;America Must Be Destroyed&quot;. For the recording of &quot;We Kill Everything&quot; between late 1998 and early 1999, Michael Bishop would temporarily rejoin the band as the bassist during the absence of Casey Orr. The record, largely influenced by punk rock, is the band&#x27;s least favorite album and thus its songs are rarely played live.

Following this, co-founder, Hunter Jackson, left the group in 2000 to focus on personal projects. Danielle Stampe also left the band to focus on a personal project named &quot;Girly Freakshow&quot;; however, she rejoined the band temporarily for the Bitch Is Back tour in 2002.

===&quot;Violence Has Arrived&quot; and the DRT Entertainment years (2001–2009)===

Due to the band&#x27;s distaste for the previous album, Gwar&#x27;s sound changed considerably for the next recording. With Tim Harriss gone, Zach Blair was hired to fill his spot as Flattus Maximus, Casey Orr also having returned to the band as Beefcake the Mighty for the recording of the band&#x27;s first entirely thrash metal album in years: &quot;Violence Has Arrived&quot;, released on November 6, 2001, the album being seen as a &quot;comeback&quot; of sorts and setting off changes that resulted in the current state of the band.

In 2002 Zach Blair left Gwar to form the power-pop band Armstrong along with drummer Brad Roberts. The band released one album titled &quot;Dick the Lionhearted&quot;. Since February 2007, Blair has been the guitarist for Rise Against.

As the band focused on a heavier, more brutal sound near the end of this period, it would also result in the creation of another side project, the Dave Brockie Experience, a band created by frontman Dave Brockie along with rhythm guitarist Mike Derks and drummer Brad Roberts as a way of continuing the comedic sound found on albums like &quot;We Kill Everything&quot; while maintaining a more serious focus in releases by Gwar. They released their first LP on March 20, 2001, &quot;Diarrhea of a Madman&quot;.

In June 2004, Gwar left Metal Blade and signed with DRT Entertainment. The band left Metal Blade due to the label&#x27;s perceived lack of faith in the band and the lack of album distribution beyond the US, along with the band&#x27;s belief that they were funding &quot;shitty bands on the label&quot;. Despite this, the band maintained they had no animosity to Brian Slagel or the label in general.

Their first album for the label, &quot;War Party&quot;, was released in October of that year&quot;.&quot; The album met with a large underground success, as it followed the same path &quot;Violence Has Arrived&quot; did, but this time with a more serious and technical edge, partially thanks to the efforts of new lead guitarist Cory Smoot (Flattus Maximus) and bass guitarist Todd Evans (Beefcake the Mighty). Videos were released for &quot;Bring Back the Bomb&quot; and &quot;War Party,&quot; and the band was invited to play on the Sounds of the Underground tour in 2005. That same year the band released &quot;Live from Mt. Fuji&quot;, the band&#x27;s first live album besides the then extremely rare &quot;You&#x27;re All Worthless and Weak&quot;, released in 2000 (and re-released in 2006) on Slave Pit Records.

In 2004 Gwar teamed up with Grey DeLisle (as the voice of Grandma Stuffum) in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Operation F. O. O. D. F. I. T. E.&quot;; the band was credited as Rawg and the songs &quot;The Private Pain of Techno Destructo&quot;, &quot;Morality Squad&quot;, and &quot;Gor-Gor&quot; were performed with new lyrics, pertaining to the episode, written for each song.
Gwar began work on their next album, tentatively titled &quot;Go to Hell!&quot;, in January 2006. That same month, Gwar opened a gallery show called &quot;The Art of Gwar&quot; at Art Space gallery in Richmond to display the many props, costumes, cartoons, paintings produced by The Slave Pit, Gwar&#x27;s art and effects studio.

On February 23, 2006, Gwar&#x27;s official website announced Gwar&#x27;s album, officially titled &quot;Beyond Hell&quot;, for which, at the urging of DRT Entertainment, a cover version of Alice Cooper&#x27;s &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; was recorded and released. The music video was directed by David Brodsky on July 2, 2006. The part of the &quot;school marm&quot; has been mistakenly identified as Devin Townsend, the producer of the &quot;Beyond Hell&quot; CD. It is actually Scott Krahl, a long-time Gwar &quot;slave&quot; and inventor of Gor-Gor. &quot;School&#x27;s Out&quot; was nominated for Best Video of 2006 on MTV2&#x27;s &quot;Headbanger&#x27;s Ball&quot;.

The &quot;Blood Bath and Beyond&quot; DVD was released on June 20, 2006, containing exclusive behind the scenes and vintage footage of the band.

Gwar performed a special &quot;half-time&quot; show at the Sounds Of The Underground 2006 tour. Gwar went on to headline the following year&#x27;s Sounds of the Underground Tour in 2007.

Vocalist Oderus Urungus is also featured on the last Strapping Young Lad album The New Black as a guest vocalist on the song &quot;Far Beyond Metal&quot;. Oderus&#x27; lines in the song are taken directly from the Gwar song &quot;Maggots&quot; (&quot;now in the halls of the Necrolord...&quot; etc.).

&quot;Beyond Hell&quot; was released on August 29, 2006, with Gwar touring to support the album and being helped by the creation of new props for this tour, including several characters from &quot;Beyond Hell&quot;″s plot, including Jitler and Jewcifer. Gwar was also present at the third annual Rock &amp; Shock festival from October 13 to 15 as a part of this tour.

In Spring 2008 Todd Evans left Gwar to focus efforts on his project Mobile Deathcamp. Shortly after Todd&#x27;s departure, Casey Orr was confirmed to return as Beefcake the Mighty.

Sleazy P. Martini returned to the stage with Gwar during their Electile Dysfunction &#x27;08 tour.

=== Twenty-fifth anniversary, return to Metal Blade and death of Cory Smoot (2009–2014) ===
In May 2009, Gwar re-signed with Metal Blade after DRT Entertainment closed down (with the band getting their master tapes from DRT), and the band and celebrated their 25th year of existence.

Gwar&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;Lust in Space&quot;, was released on August 18, 2009, They performed at the 2009 Gathering of the Juggalos and toured nationwide with Lamb of God and Job for a Cowboy. In 2009, Gwar celebrated their 25th year as a band.

The band released a 2009 Christmas vinyl record consisting of a new song titled &quot;Christmas Stripper Summer Weekend&quot; and a live &quot;Hell-O&quot; medley.

Oderus Urungus hosted the &quot;Crack-a-Thon&quot; in Brooklyn, New York at the MF Gallery in April 2010. A second Crack-A-Thon followed in 2011.

On November 9, 2010, Gwar released their twelfth studio album, &quot;Bloody Pit of Horror&quot;.

On November 3, 2011, lead guitarist Cory Smoot, who had portrayed Flattus Maximus since 2002, was found dead by his fellow band members in the band&#x27;s tour bus as they prepared to cross the border into Manitoba, Canada from North Dakota. The cause of death was &quot;a coronary artery thrombosis brought about by his pre-existing coronary artery disease.&quot; On November 4, Dave Brockie officially announced that the character of Flattus Maximus would be retired out of respect to Smoot.

The last single recorded with Smoot was released on December 22, 2011, and is a cover of the Dayglo Abortions song &quot;Isn&#x27;t This Disgusting&quot;. The single was made available on iTunes and appeared on the Dayglo Abortions tribute album in 2012.
On April 3, 2012, a television sit-com created by horror filmmaker Adam Green and starring Brockie portraying Oderus Urungus titled &quot;Holliston&quot; debuted on the FEARnet cable television network. The series starred Oderus as series lead Green&#x27;s imaginary alien friend who lives in his closet. Brockie toured and appeared with his castmates as Oderus at many live performances of &quot;Holliston&quot; across the United States in 2012 and 2013. 

Green appeared on stage with Gwar several times when the band had him introduce their encore performance. The full &quot;Holliston&quot; cast was &quot;murdered&quot; on stage and fed to both Gwar&#x27;s world maggot and meat grinder at several US shows. A third season of &quot;Holliston&quot; was being scripted by Green when Brockie died of a heroin overdose in March 2014.

Cannabis Corpse guitarist Brent Purgason took over the late Cory Smoot&#x27;s role under the name Pustulus Maximus in late 2012, making his first appearance with the band in a video on The A.V. Club of the band playing a cover of Kansas&#x27; 1976 hit tune &quot;Carry on My Wayward Son&quot;. In September 2013 Gwar&#x27;s thirteenth studio album, titled &quot;Battle Maximus,&quot; was released. Promotional activities for the record included a video of Gwar covering Billy Ocean&#x27;s &quot;Get Outta My Dreams, Get Into My Car&quot; and The Who&#x27;s &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot;, and a one-off Funny Or Die animated cartoon produced by Myke Chilian and Gwar titled &quot;The Animated Tales of Gwar&quot;.

=== Death of Dave Brockie, GwarBar, and future (2014–present) ===
On March 23, 2014, Dave Brockie, age 50, was found dead by a roommate in his Richmond, Virginia, apartment. The cause of death was later confirmed to be a heroin overdose. Brockie&#x27;s death left the collective without any of its founding artists or musicians.

The surviving members of Gwar and the Slave Pit released a video statement to announce the creation of the David Brockie Foundation, a charity fund for the encouragement of future talent and the preservation of Brockie&#x27;s body of work. Their first goal with the foundation was to construct a memorial monument to him in Richmond to provide a place of respect for the former frontman of Gwar. Former bassist Mike Bishop, the original Beefcake the Mighty, re-joined the band as vocalist for their first performance without Brockie at the fifth Gwar B-Q at Hadad&#x27;s Lake. The performance was preceded by a public memorial service the day before, the singer&#x27;s Oderus Urungus character was given a Viking funeral.

Gwar played at the following month&#x27;s Riot Fest in Chicago and went back on tour in December 2014, with new character Vulvatron, played by Kim Dylla . They also appeared again in an A.V Club video, playing a cover of the Pet Shop Boys&#x27; &quot;West End Girls&quot; which transitioned into &quot;People Who Died&quot; by Jim Carroll—as a tribute to Cory Smoot, Dave Brockie and other friends of Gwar who have since passed on. Kim Dylla was released from the band at the end of 2014. In October 2016 Gwar released &quot;The Blood of Gods,&quot; their first album without founding member and longtime vocalist Brockie.

In January 2015, GwarBar (stylized as GWARbar) opened in the Jackson Ward neighborhood of Richmond, Virginia. Mike Derks and Travis Croxton, Richmond&#x27;s &quot;Restaurateur of the Year 2014,&quot; co-own the upscale dive bar. Derks, who also serves as executive chef, collaborated with head chef Jeremy Dutra to create the restaurant&#x27;s menu. The band&#x27;s website describes the bar as &quot;a fantasy land of food and beverage, catering to everyone from local punk metal freaks, rock stars, businessmen, celebrity chefs and starving artists.&quot; On May 29, 2020, the restaurant opened its long-planned outdoor beer garden after being closed to indoor dining for two months as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

In February 2019, Jamison Land left the band and Casey Orr later returned to fill the role of Beefcake once again. A remixed and remastered 30th anniversary edition of &quot;Scumdogs of the Universe&quot; was released the following year and on day of release the band broadcast an anniversary reunion concert where the album was performed in its entirety for the first time. Dubbed &quot;Scumdogs XXX Live,&quot; it marked the first time that Gwar co-founder Hunter Jackson had directly worked with the band since his departure in 2000.

&quot;The Disc with No Name&quot;, a limited edition picture disc containing four acoustic renditions of previously released songs, was released in May 2021. The band embarked on a Scumdogs 30th anniversary tour, featuring co-founder Hunter Jackson, and released the &quot;Scumdogs XXX Live&quot; concert album. On June 3, 2022, Gwar released their fifteenth studio album, &quot;The New Dark Ages&quot;, alongside a graphic novel, &quot;Gwar in The Duoverse of Absurdity&quot;, released by Z2 Comics. In July 2023, Gwar performed on NPR&#x27;s Tiny Desk Concert. The band dedicated their final song to Oderus Urungus. On November 5, 2023, Purgason announced his departure from the band after eleven years of membership, noting that he was leaving on good terms and would still be involved in some capacity behind the scenes.

On November 21, 2023, Balsac the Jaws of Death announced that he was co-writing a Gwar movie entitled &quot;Gwar Must Die&quot;.

On February 29, 2024, It was announced that Tommy Meehan (of Squid Pisser and formerly of Cancer Christ) had joined the touring lineup, taking over as lead guitarist for Brent Purgason, also known as Pustulus Maximus.

==Gwar-B-Q==
From 2009 to 2016 Gwar hosted an annual festival in Richmond, Virginia, called &quot;Gwar-B-Q&quot;. The festival boasted of barbecue, rock-and-roll vendors, a haunted house of sorts (which &quot;bohabs&quot; can visit to be spewed and bled upon) and live music. Held at Hadad&#x27;s Lake, a natural water park in Richmond, Gwar-B-Q quickly grew into a destination event having hosted bands like Clutch, Down, Dead Earth Politics, Cancer Bats,
and The Dickies. At the 2014 Gwar-B-Q, the first since Dave Brockie&#x27;s death, the singer&#x27;s Oderus Urungus character was given a Viking funeral, with his stage costume burned on a funeral pyre on Hadad&#x27;s Lake.

==Etymology==
Despite various explanations that Gwar is an acronym for something (such as &quot;God what an awful racket&quot;), band members have consistently stated that the letters do not stand for anything. The official website of Slave Pit Inc. indicates that Gwar is a shortened version of &quot;Gwaaarrrgghhlllgh&quot;, the name the band used originally when opening for Death Piggy.

<text>In Sioux mythology (Indigenous American mythological tradition that includes Lakota mythology), Anpao (Lakota: &quot;Aŋpáo&quot;), or Anp, is a spirit with two faces that represents the dawn.

Anpao dances with Han, a primordial spirit of darkness, to ensure that Wi does not burn up the Earth, resulting in day and night.

George Bushotter (Yankton Dakota-Lakota, 1860–1892) wrote that when his younger brother was ill, the brother was told to pray to Anpao, the Dawn, and recovered.

&quot;Anpao zi&quot; is the &quot;yellow of the dawn&quot;, which oral history described as the meadowlark&#x27;s breast.

<text>Valleberga Church is a church in the village of Valleberga, Sweden. It is situated is about 15 miles east of Ystad in Skåne County. It is in the parish of Löderup of the Diocese of Lund. 

==History==
It was built of limestone in the middle of the 12th century.
It is the only known fortified round church in Skåne. Master mason of the church, Carl stenmästare, also built churches on Bornholm, where round churches were common. The baptismal font was cut by the Romanesque artist known today as Majestatis and shows one of the legends about Saint Peter and Paul of Tarsus. The pulpit was made in 1619. The altar cabinet dates to the beginning of the 16th century.
In 1791, the round church was considerably altered when extensions were made to the north, west and south. These extensions were demolished in 1908–1910 when the round church was restored and a large cathedral-like extension was made to the west, including a new tower.

<doc id="868170" wikidata="Q7294396" url="?curid=868170" title="Rapture TV">
<text>Rapture TV was a previously free-to-air satellite television station (although now an exclusively online channel) operated from the United Kingdom, founded in 1997. Focusing mostly on electronic dance music and extreme sports, it is notable for the number of times it has failed financially only to be relaunched.

==History==
===1997-2001===
The channel was initially launched by the United Business Media group as a cable television channel on 22 November 1997. Due to common UBM ownership, the channel shared facilities with, and was broadcast from, the Anglia Television studios in Norwich. The channel was later carried free-to-view on the analogue transponder of FilmFour on Astra 1A at weekends, and eventually used this transponder full-time, until closing its analogue service on 12 December 1999. Shortly before this, on 27 October 1999, the channel had moved to digital broadcasting via Sky Digital, where it launched in the general entertainment section of the EPG.

Rapture made agreements with cable companies in 1999, starting with NTL in January 1999, adding 700,000 potential households, and later in September with Cable &amp; Wireless, effective 16 October, adding 850,000 potential households. The agreement with CWC also enabled the production of five programmes for CWC&#x27;s Local Channel. In May 1999, it announced that Rapture TV would start a seven-day service from March 2000, a move that would double its production output. Rapture made a production agreement with BBC Choice to produce &quot;Problem Page&quot;, presented by Heather Darroch. In October 1999, Rapture TV made its first acquisition, &quot;Clubavision&quot;, produced by London Weekend Television, as well as an agreement with Channel 4 to relay thirty hours of its output per week. The channel made its first outside broadcast on 13 November 1999 at the Slope X snowboarding festival in Battersea Park. For New Year&#x27;s Eve, the channel planned to air a five-part documentary about Radio 1 DJ Carl Cox&#x27;s two gigs in Sydney and Honolulu.

A notable feature of the station during this time was its &quot;Mouse Cam&quot;, broadcast as a time filler when the station was off-air. This featured some mice in a Habitrail-like setup, with shots changing between cameras. The station also featured one of the first SMS-based request shows during this era. A launch to ITV Digital was planned at this time, but never came to completion.

Co-founder Debbie Mason quit the channel in late January 2000, to spend more time with her family. The channel started its seven-day schedule on 7 February 2000, nearly a month ahead of the initial March 2000 target. Richard Kilgarriff left the channel in March, starting a platform of his own instead. Shortly afterwards, the channel announced a one-off celebrity special of &quot;That Film Show&quot; presented by Neil Stuke. Hobbins Sides devised a new identity for the channel in 2000, being implemented from 1 May that year. On 24 July, the channel was made available full-time on Sky Digital.

Rapture started facing difficulties in September 2000. On 27 September a meeting was being held at the now-defunct Rapture TV studio at Anglia&#x27;s facilities, eyeing a massive cut of its staff, which before the crisis was estimated to be at 40. After the cuts were announced, Rapture greenlighted its first independent commission, &quot;Club Class&quot; and a co-production with Ministry of Sound to broadcast a concert held at the Millennium Dome.

===2001 shutdown, first relaunch===
The channel had never been profitable, and its average audiences were in the region of 100,000. UBM placed the channel on the market in January 2001, but as it was unable to find a buyer, UBM announced in September that it would close the channel later in 2001, pending a consultation regarding the date of its closedown, with the loss of 46 jobs and debts estimated at £12 million, before closing down on 31 October, notably playing &quot;Rapture&quot; by iio as its final track over pictures of the station staff. During this time, it had refocused almost entirely on dance music, and had moved to the music section of the EPG.

In April 2002, the channel&#x27;s assets were bought by Edinburgh based independent production company Power TV, who had previously produced some shows for the channel. A temporary relaunch occurred to Channel 232 in June 2002, and lasted until August of the same year, when problems caused it to close again.

===2003 relaunch===
In November 2002, Power TV appointed Feel to devise the next look for Rapture, eyeing a possible relaunch of the channel in 2003. It was again relaunched on 12 May 2003 on EPG channel 265. Recurring financial issues, aggravated by the technical failure of a premium-rate SMS service on the channel which would have brought in funding, and various other problems, left the channel in a precarious state. By April 2004 it was running on an almost autopilot, having moved (again) to EPG channel 205, with a somewhat randomised playlist of a few videos, reruns of old club nights overnight, and extreme sports in the day.

In July 2004, the channel ran out of money terminally, a potential purchase by Video Interactive Television fell through and the channel ceased to broadcast and was removed from the Sky EPG. Plans for its relaunch were kept active, however. Its named holding company, Rapture TV (Scotland), which was incorporated in 2002, was wound up in 2005.

In December 2004, the channel returned in part-time format after an agreement with The Musicians&#x27; Channel, an FTA educational channel. The arrangement occupied the 12am to 12pm timeslot.

The story of Rapture TV has been a defining one for the birth of digital satellite. With the increase in capacity, and lower cost base, a whole host of such channels were launched, with most languishing at unpopular EPG locations, or even outside the EPG. Although the satellite TV became cheaper to enter, many operators rushed onto the scene without a viable business plan that would make money. Unlike other such channels, Rapture TV has refused to disappear.

===2005 relaunch===
Ahead of its return to the air, Rapture TV bought programming to fill its new line-up. The channel relaunched on Sky Digital broadcasting from Eutelsat 28A on 14 November 2005, after some time awaiting an EPG number from Sky – a period of time which was deemed excessive enough to warrant a complaint to OFCOM by the channel. At the same time it was awarded a five-year contract with Arqiva for satellite uplink.

The re-launched Rapture TV showed clubbing and extreme sports, programming that the channel is well known for, as well as new programmes from genres such as comedy and drama. In addition, programmes focusing on computer games and technology, including Cybernet (previously seen on ITV) and G@mers, an in-house production were added to the lineup. The channel also broadcast feature films. Dance music content, which made up much of the channels output on previous editions, was retained, with the addition of Underground, a hardcore dance show presented by Jon Doe of CLSM.

The channel launched a broadband simulcast in March 2006, and claims to be the first UK based entertainment channel to launch such a service.

In September 2006, Rapture lodged a complaint with OFCOM against BSkyB, claiming &quot;BSkyB is charging excessively high fees for the supply of a EPG service on the UK&#x27;s only DSat platform&quot;. This was furthered on 23 February 2007 with Rapture submitting further evidence to OFCOM in regard to what they felt was &quot;Bullying&quot; on the part of BSkyB. 
The complaint was furthered just under a week before Virgin Media removed BSkyB&#x27;s Basic channels from their service after an unsuccessful round of negotiations in regard to the worth of the channels. Ofcom rejected this complaint.

===2007===
On 19 March 2007, BSkyB decided to remove Rapture TV from their EPG based on the fact that Rapture TV had failed to pay for a slot in the EPG. Rapture TV was available on the BSkyB platform on channel 193.

On 25 April 2007, Rapture published a statement that outlined the temporary cut off of the channel, whilst giving details of upgrading the site with more content and on-demand video.

On 9 May 2007 a case brought by Rapture TV to Ofcom concerning the BSkyB EPG (Electronic Programme Guide) went to Appeal at the Competition Commission Appeals Tribunal (CAT). The hearing was heard on 18 and 19 December 2007.

===Rapture TV Live===
On 12 June 2007, Rapture relaunched its live stream, which initially broadcast R:Muzik 24/7 but now also broadcast programmes from the Rapture archive. A week beforehand the stream was trialled unsuccessfully using peercast. The free stream was a temporary measure, and in the future was likely going to be replaced with a high quality paid service. In October 2007, a new feature was added enabling viewers to select music videos to play on the live stream for free via the Rapture website.

===2008===
On 31 March 2008, the Competition Commission Appeals Tribunal released their judgement, in which they unanimously dismissed the appeal.

Rapture continued to be very vocally critical of Sky and the various related Murdoch companies on public forums for some time before focusing their efforts elsewhere.

===2009===
Rapture attempted to restart their satellite broadcast presence in an audio-only capacity by broadcasting several shows for satellite radio broadcaster RTI, Radio Tatras International (Sky channel 0195), a British-Slovak station. These broadcasts took place on 17 and 24 January 2009.

RTI closed down shortly after this, on 25 January.

<doc id="868184" wikidata="Q771497" url="?curid=868184" title="Anshar">
<text>Anshar ( , , ) was a Mesopotamian god regarded as a primordial king of the gods. He was not actively worshiped. He was regarded as the father of Anu. In the first millennium BCE his name came to be used as a logographic representation of the head god in the Assyrian state pantheon, Ashur. He is attested in a number of god lists, such as &quot;An = Anum&quot;, and in literary compositions, including the &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot;.

==Name and character==
Anshar&#x27;s name was written in cuneiform as AN.ŠÁR. It can be translated from Sumerian as &quot;the whole heaven&quot;. Benjamin R. Foster suggests that together with Kishar he was understood as the personification of the circle of the horizon, which represented the totality of heaven and earth. It was believed that he was involved in creation of the world and the other deities. He was regarded as a primordial deity. As such, he was an abstract figure who was not actively worshiped. 

The theonym Anshargal attested in god lists is presumed to be a variant of Anshar.

==Associations with other deities==
The goddess Kishar (&quot;whole earth&quot;) was regarded as Anshar&#x27;s spouse. They appear together in the &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot; and in the exorcistic formula &quot;Gattung A&quot;, which opens with an invocation of them both. However, in a late astronomical commentary (tablet BM 68593) Kishar is instead the spouse of the star Gudanna (&quot;mulgud-an-na&quot;), described as the &quot;Enlil of Shuruppak&quot;.

===Anshar and Anu===
Anshar could be regarded as the father of Anu. He is one of the deities belonging to the so-called &quot;theogony of Anu&quot;, a conventional term used in Assyriology to refer to listings of the latter&#x27;s ancestors. They are typically less systematic than better known enumerations of the ancestors of Enlil, and in many cases Alala and Belili are Anu&#x27;s parents instead of Anshar and Kishar. The oldest attestation of the tradition presenting Anshar as Anu s father is the Old Babylonian forerunner of the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;, but no other references to it are known from this period. 

Anu and Anshar could alternatively be equated with each other. A god list with the incipit &quot;Anšar = Anu&quot; was in circulation in the first millennium BCE. In the bilingual poem &quot;Exaltation of Ishtar&quot; Anshar corresponds to Anu in the Akkadian version, with Kishar analogously representing Antu. &quot;An = Anum&quot; (tablet I, line 8) equates Anshar with both Anu and Antu (&quot;da-nu-um u da-n-tu&quot;). Further examples are available from various scholarly texts from Uruk postdating the Neo-Babylonian period, in which dAN.ŠÁR(.GAL) is used as a logographic representation of Anu&#x27;s name. However, Julia Krul stresses that equations of deities with their fathers represent speculation mostly typical for god lists, and did not necessarily influence the sphere of cult.

===Anshar and Ashur===
As attested for the first time in sources from the reign of Sargon II, with the only possible earlier forerunner being a bead inscription from the reign of either Tukulti-Ninurta I or Tukulti-Ninurta II, in Assyria the logogram AN.ŠÁR could be used to represent the name of the supreme deity of the state pantheon, Ashur. Under Sennacherib it became the conventional writing of Ashur&#x27;s name. The goal of this equation was to establish the seniority of Ashur over Marduk, who in the light of the genealogy of deities presented in the &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot; was a descendant of Anshar.

Paul-Alain Beaulieu suggests that the logogram AN.ŠÁR also designates Assur in texts from Neo-Babylonian Uruk. He points out that they indicate AN.ŠÁR was actively worshiped, which would be unusual if the name referred to the primordial god. A small shrine dedicated to AN.ŠÁR is attested in sources from the Neo-Babylonian and early Achaemenid periods, but it is uncertain when his cult was introduced to the city. It might have originally been established either when the city was under the control of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, or later on by a group of Assyrian immigrants. In the former case, the worship of Ashur in Uruk would most likely reflect a political alliance between local elites and the Assyrian state, as there is no evidence his cult was imposed in any Babylonian cities.

Beaulieu argues that the identification between Anshar and Ashur was additionally meant to facilitate equating the latter with Anu. He suggests this might have been the reason why Anu&#x27;s prominence in the local pantheon of Uruk increased from the fifth century BCE onward. Julia Krul disagrees with this proposal, and points out that while it is plausible that in Uruk the clergy might have accepted the equation between Anshar and Ashur, there is no evidence that the latter was viewed as related to Anu, or that theological ideas pertaining to him influenced Anu&#x27;s cult.

Piotr Steinkeller notes that the association between Anshar and Ashur might explain why Kakka, a deity chiefly worshiped in Upper Mesopotamia rather than in Babylonia, appears as a messenger of the former in the &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot;.

==Mythology==
===&quot;Enūma Eliš&quot;===
Anshar&#x27;s role in the conventional genealogy of Anu resulted in his incorporation into the &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot;. The text does not explicitly state whether he and Kishar are the children of Lahmu and Lahamu, or instead a second pair of Apsu&#x27;s and Tiamat&#x27;s children. However, the former option is considered the correct interpretation. Anshar serves for a time as the king of the gods. His grandson Ea informs him about Tiamat plotting against the younger deities, which prompts Anshar to blame him and task him with finding a solution. After he fails, Anshar sends Anu to attempt to solve the issue, but he is similarly unsuccessful. Ea eventually convinces him that the only god who can defeat Tiamat is his own son, Marduk. Anshar then summons his attendant Kakka to inform Lahmu and Lahamu about his decision to rely on Marduk. After emerging victorious, Marduk replaces Anshar as the new king of the gods. The latter is the first deity to provide him with new names. He states that Marduk will be known as Asalluhi and subsequently partakes in further name-giving alongside Lahmu and Lahamu.

In an Assyrian recension of the &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot;, known only from a number of incomplete late copies from Assur and Nineveh tentatively dated to the reign from Sennacherib, the logogram AN.ŠÁR is used to refer to both Anshar himself and to Ashur, who replaces Marduk as the protagonist, but is also identified with the aforementioned primordial deity. As noted by Wilfred G. Lambert, the change is &quot;superficial&quot; and &quot;leaves the plot in chaos by attributing Marduk&#x27;s part to his great-grandfather, without making any attempt to iron out the resulting confusion&quot;. This rewrite might be referenced in a late Assyrian commentary on the &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot;, which states that Anshar came into being &quot;when heaven and underworld had not been created&quot; but &quot;city and house were in existence&quot;, which reflects the role of Marduk (and thus Ashur) more accurately than that of Anshar himself.

An esoteric commentary linking passages from the &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot; with various ritual observances from Babylon states that Anshar sending Anu to confront Tiamat corresponds to the celebrations during which Mandanu headed to Ḫursagkalamma (Kish).

===Other compositions===
Anshar is referenced in passing in the myth &quot;Enlil and Sud&quot; and in a hymn to Haya from the reign of Rim-Sîn I.

Anshar appears in multiple lists of defeated primordial figures alongside Asag, Enmesharra, Lugaldukuga, Qingu and others. Such enumerations are embedded in a number of expository or ritual texts. In one case, Anshar is equated in this context with the minor underworld god Alla.

A royal hymn from the reign of Nebuchadnezzar I focused on establishing a connection between him and Enmeduranki, a mythical king of Sippar, mentions Anshar in passing and refers to Shuzianna as his sister.

A myth only known from five fragments dated to either Seleucid or Parthian period, four of which come from the same copy, refers to Anshar as the father of Anu. While restoration of the text remains uncertain, it is possible that it describes his death at the hands of Enki and Ninamakalla, which would indicate it preserves a succession narrative in which the actively worshiped members of the Mesopotamian pantheon depose a generation of primordial deities. 

A reference to Anshar has been identified in a quotation from Eudemus of Rhodes preserved by the Neo-Platonic philosopher Damascius, according to which in Babylonian cosmology figures named Assōros and Kissarē were the parents of Anos (Anu), Illinos (Enlil) and Aos (Ea). It is presumed that Eudemus relied on a source related to the tradition represented by the &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot;, but not identical with it.

<doc id="868191" wikidata="Q411824" url="?curid=868191" title="Antu (goddess)">
<text>Antu () or Antum was a Mesopotamian goddess regarded as the feminine counterpart and spouse of the sky god, Anu. She was sometimes identified with the earth rather than the sky, though such references are not common. While already attested in the third millennium BCE, she was only a minor goddess, and only came to be worshiped commonly in Uruk in the Achaemenid and Seleucid periods due to religious reforms which elevated her and Anu to the position of tutelary deities of the city. At some point Antu was also incorporated into Hurrian religion, in which she was understood as a primeval deity. In the so-called &quot;Standard Babylonian&quot; edition of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; Antu is addressed as the mother of Ishtar, but this tradition was not commonly adhered to.

==Name and character==
Antu&#x27;s name is etymologically an Akkadian feminine derivative of the theonym Anu. The cuneiform sign representing the latter name, AN, in addition to designating the sky god could also function as an ordinary noun, read as either /an/, &quot;heaven&quot;, or /dingir/, &quot;deity&quot;. Antu accordingly functioned as the feminine counterpart of Anu. She was also regarded as his spouse. Cases of Anu and Antu being equated with each other are attested too. Paul-Alain Beaulieu interprets this as an indication the cuneiform sign AN could be used as a logogram (sumerogram) to represent the name of Antu. However, as noted by it is also possible that the sky was at some point envisioned as an androgynous being in Mesopotamian tradition.

A small number of sources, including the god list &quot;An = Anum&quot;, treat Antu as deified earth (&quot;ki&quot;/&quot;erṣetum&quot;). An Old Babylonian lexical list, &quot;Diri&quot;, equates her with Urash, an earth goddess also associated with Anu. It has also been suggested that the phrase AN URAŠ occurring on seals from the Kassite period, agreed to represent a compound of two theonyms, might also have been understood as &quot;Anu-Antu&quot;. Antu might have also played the role of earth in formulaic references to Anu, representing the sky, inseminating the ground with his rains. Thorkild Jacobsen in the 1970s asserted that as an extension of this belief rain was believed to come out of Antu’s breasts, which according to his assumption were envisioned as clouds. This conclusion is also supported by Karen Rhea Nemet-Nejat.

In the Seleucid period, Antu’s name and her epithets became a subject of both theological and philological speculation. A text focused on this topic is preserved on the tablet MLC 1890 (presently in the Morgan Library Collection, part of the Yale Babylonian Collection), dated to the reign of Seleucus III Ceraunus (most likely 225 BCE) and according to its colophon copied by a scribe named Illut-Anu. As already attested in earlier god lists, she could be equated with various primordial deities, same as Anu. For example, an equation between Antu and Anu and, respectively, Kishar and Anshar is preserved in &quot;An = Anum&quot;. The link between her and Kishar recurs in a later composition from Uruk. An Assyrian expository text (KAR 307), presumably dependent on Babylonian &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot;, in a paragraph discussing Tiamat states that she can be understood as &quot;Antum who makes offerings for the dead to Anu&quot; alongside other esoteric speculations about her identity. Wilfred G. Lambert suggested that this identification might be derived from the frequent references to Anu being a father of various demons, which would by extension make Antu their mother and thus a suitable figure to identify with Tiamat. Examples of demons directly identified as children of Anu include Asakku (in &quot;Lugal-e&quot;), Utukku (in &quot;Udug-Hul&quot;) and Sebitti (in the &quot;Epic of Erra&quot;). Additionally, Lamashtu was explicitly identified as a daughter of both Antu and Anu.

Antu&#x27;s association with the underworld attested in KAR 307 is also mentioned in a number of texts compiled by Seleucid &quot;kalû&quot; clergy, but it remains unknown if this belief was shared by other social groups. In a single case, &quot;great Antu&quot; is attested as a title of Ereshkigal in a funerary ritual prescribing the offering of beer and wine to her, Gilgamesh and a group of figures described as sailors, presumably the crew of a ferry carrying the dead.

Sources from the Seleucid period indicate that in Mesopotamian astronomy Antu and Anu were identified with a pair of circumpolar stars referred to as &quot;Great Anu and Antu of Heaven&quot;. However, attestations of the latter astral body are limited to texts from Uruk, and no sources from earlier periods or other cities ever linked any stars to Antu. According to Erica Reiner, it can be assumed that the &quot;Great Antu&quot; was one of the stars of the constellation Ursa Major.

==Worship==

Antu is already attested in the third millennium BCE, with the oldest possible reference tentatively identified in an Early Dynastic god list from Abu Salabikh. However, prior to the fifth century BCE she was not a commonly worshiped deity, and her position in the Mesopotamian pantheon has been described as “unimportant and elusive” by Paul-Alain Beaulieu. She is attested next to Anu among the deities mentioned in the inscription of Anubanini on the so-called Anubanini rock relief. This king&#x27;s reign has been dated to the early Isin-Larsa period, and his kingdom, Lullubum, was centered in the area in the proximity of modern Sulaymaniyah. References to Antu also occur in letters from the Old Babylonian period, but they are not common. She also appears alongside Anu in the Agum-Kakrime inscription. In incantations, she is attested in formulas against illness and demons, for example Lamashtu. In &quot;Maqlû&quot;, she is invoked against witches alongside Anu and Belet-Seri.

In later periods, Antu was worshiped in Uruk. However, no references to her are present in any texts from this city predating the first millennium BCE, and in the Neo-Babylonian period she is only mentioned in a single letter. It mentions that a garment (&quot;kusītu&quot;) was borrowed for an occasion connected to her from the Eanna temple. Additionally, it describes offerings to her, Bēl-āliya and Mār-bīti. Paul-Alaian Beaulieu points out that the letter was sent from a temple partially subordinate to Eanna, which alongside the fact that its sender bore the name invoking Larsa&#x27;s tutelary god Shamash, Šamaš-aḫ-iddin, lead him to suggest it might deal with worship of Antu in this city rather than Uruk. A second possibility is that Kullab is meant, as while it is not known if Larsa had its own Bēl-āliya, a “divine mayor”, this title is well attested for Pisangunug in the case of the other settlement.

A change in Antu&#x27;s status in Uruk occurred over the course of the Achaemenid and Seleucid periods, when she was elevated to the position of one of the lead deities of the city alongside Anu. She came to be worshiped alongside him in a newly built temple, Bīt Rēš. Its ceremonial name can be translated as &quot;foremost temple&quot;. Antu&#x27;s cella in it was known as Egašananna, &quot;house of the lady of heaven&quot;. One of its chambers was also designated as her bedroom, and was referred to with the ceremonial name Enir, possibly to be understood as Eanir (Akkadian &quot;bīt tānēḫi&quot;), &quot;house of weariness&quot;. According to Andrew R. George and Paul-Alain Beaulieu, Bīt Rēš might have developed from the É.SAG, a sanctuary of Lugalbanda attested in earlier periods whose name was written with the same signs, but this remains hypothetical. Its establishment marked the first time in the history of Uruk when Eanna was not its main temple. This development was a result of the rise of new priestly families in the aftermath of failed revolts which took place in 484 BCE and Xerxes I&#x27;s retaliation against the participants. The status of the city&#x27;s former tutelary deity, Ishtar, declined, and some of her attributes were absorbed by Antu. For example, in the text MLC 1890 Ninsianna, the personification of the planet Venus, who in earlier periods could be treated as a form of Ishtar, is instead treated as an epithet of Antu. The &quot;kalû&quot; clergy of Uruk, responsible for Emesal prayers and formerly associated with Ishtar, came to be linked to the cult of Anu and Antu instead in Seleucid times. In some cases, the change makes it possible to date individual texts with no other direct indication of their age than their authors being a kalû in service of one of these deities. It is not certain if Seleucid kings were involved in the worship of Antu and other deities of Uruk, though it has been argued that the attested building and renovation projects required royal support.

In texts from Seleucid Uruk, Antu almost always appears alongside Anu. As argued by Joan Goodnick Westenholz, the local theologians effectively treated the pair as &quot;one single divine manifestation&quot;. She argues that the process of their elevation can therefore be seen as part of a broader phenomenon focused on predominance of city gods (rather than city goddesses) in the late period of Mesopotamian antiquity, which was linked to henotheist tendencies. However, according to Julia Krul speculative henotheist theology, while well attested, never enjoyed much popularity outside of small intellectual circles. It is also known that Antu was celebrated with a procession during the new year festival, during which she was accompanied by a number of deities normally not associated with her and seemingly grouped only for the sake of newly established celebrations: Bēlet-ilī, Shala, Mārāt-Ani (&quot;Daughters of Anu&quot;), Aya, Gula, Ninešgal (&quot;Mistress of the Ešgal temple&quot;, a manifestation of Ishtar), Amasagnudi, Sadarnunna, Ašratu and Šarrat-šamê (&quot;Queen of the Heavens&quot;, possibly another manifestation of Ishtar). The formula &quot;may it be preserved by the command of Anu and Antu&quot; is attested in scholarly compositions, as well as legal and administrative documents, especially marriage agreements. In addition to direct references to Antu in ritual and economic texts, she is also attested in theophoric names.

===Hurrian reception===
Antu was at some point incorporated into Hurrian religion, and in this context came to be regarded as one of the primeval deities alongside other figures originating in Mesopotamia, such as Anu, Enlil, Ninlil or Alalu. Most likely this classification reflected their perception in areas located on the periphery of the Mesopotamian cultural sphere. In Hurrian context Antu formed a triad alongside Anu and Apantu. The latter deity&#x27;s name according to Alfonso Archi was formed in assonance with her own.

In a trilingual edition of the Weidner god list from Ugarit, Antu corresponds to the entries Ašte Anive (in the Hurrian column) and Tahāmatu (in the Ugaritic column). The first of these names does not represent an actual deity, and instead is a neologism invented by the text&#x27;s compilers, who provided Anu, under a Hurrian variant of his name, with a wife whose Hurrian name would be similarly derived from his own, literally &quot;the wife of Ani&quot;. The second can be translated as &quot;the deep waters&quot; and presumably represented the freshwater springs in the proximity of Ugarit. Due to multiple entries considered to be either similar scholarly inventions or scribal word plays, the list is not considered to be an accurate source of information about either Hurrian or Ugaritic religion.

==Mythology==
Antu is mentioned in the so-called &quot;Standard Babylonian&quot; edition of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; when Ishtar demands Anu to give her the permission to use the Bull of Heaven to punish Gilgamesh (tablet VI, line 83). While she and Anu are addressed as Ishtar&#x27;s parents in this passage, as pointed out by Paul-Alain Beaulieu the tradition according to which she was a daughter of Nanna and Ningal was more widespread. Walter Burkert has suggested that the passage might have influenced the reference to Aphrodite&#x27;s mother Dione in the &quot;Iliad&quot;, with the name Dione being a calque of Antu, as it is a feminine form of Zeus. However, as stressed by Andrew R. George in his discussion of the work of Burkert and other authors who assume Homer was directly influenced by the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, it cannot be established with certainty that any possible similarities arose from direct contact with the Mesopotamian composition. He notes it might be more plausible to assume similar motifs reflect a shared tradition rather than necessarily direct derivation.

According to incantations against Lamashtu, Antu and Anu cast this demon down from heaven and denied her the right to have a sanctuary (&quot;parakku&quot;) on earth.

While Antu is not attested in &quot;Enūma Eliš&quot;, and Anu is addressed as the sole parent of Ea in this composition, according to Spencer L. Allen based on supplementary evidence from an esoteric Assyrian commentary it is nonetheless possible that she was implicitly understood as his mother and thus as the grandmother of Marduk in derived tradition.

In a Seleucid astronomical text, Papsukkal is described as the vizier of both Anu and Antu.

<text>Chris Omprakash Sharma (born 23 April 1981) is an American rock climber who is considered one of the greatest and most influential climbers in the history of the sport. He dominated sport climbing for the decade after his 2001 ascent of &quot;Realization/Biographie&quot;, the world&#x27;s first-ever redpoint of a consensus graded route, and ushered in what was called a &quot;technical evolution&quot; in the sport. Sharma carried the mantle of &quot;world&#x27;s strongest sport climber&quot; from Wolfgang Güllich (who held it for almost a decade from the early 1980s), and passed it to Adam Ondra (who held it from 2012).

In 2008, Sharma redpointed the world&#x27;s first-ever consensus route with &quot;Jumbo Love&quot;, and in 2013, became only the second-ever person to climb a route with &quot;La Dura Dura&quot;. Sharma is also known for free soloing the world&#x27;s first-ever deep-water solo route, &quot;Es Pontàs&quot; in 2006. Sharma became one of the most commercially successful climbers in his sport, and was noted for his &quot;King Lines&quot; – iconic routes that inspired him to spend the months and even years needed to climb them – some of which feature in the award-winning 2007 climbing film, &quot;King Lines&quot;.

==Early life==
Chris Omprakash Sharma was born and raised in Santa Cruz, California, the only child of Gita Jahn and Bob Sharma. His parents were devotees of the yogi Baba Hari Dass, and adopted the surname Sharma when they got married. He went to Mount Madonna, and attended Soquel High School for a year. Sharma started rock climbing when he was 12 at the Pacific Edge Climbing Gym, and he described himself as &quot;one of the first climbing-gym-generation kids&quot;.

==Climbing career==
===1996–2002 (to &quot;Realization&quot;)===
From the outset, Sharma was considered a prodigy in the climbing world. At age 14, he won the adult 1996 US Open Bouldering Nationals, and a year later aged 15, he freed Boone Speed&#x27;s project &quot;Necessary Evil&quot; in the Virgin River Gorge, the hardest sport climb in North America at the time. The following year, Sharma won silver at the biennial UIAA World Championships at Paris, and gold at the Kranj leg of the UIAA World Cup, both for lead climbing. Still 16, he suffered a serious knee injury that sidelined him for over a year. Aged 18, Sharma moved to Bishop, California, and began a US bouldering revolution with his 1999 film &quot;Rampage&quot;, and in February 2000, completed the first ascent of &quot;The Mandala&quot;, a world-famous boulder problem.

On 18 July 2001, aged 20, Sharma completed the extension of the route &quot;Biographie&quot; in Ceüse in France, and named it &quot;Realization&quot;; the route was the first consensus in the world, and has since become an important route in the history of sport climbing, with &quot;Climbing&quot; magazine noting that &quot;technical rock climbing jumped in its evolution&quot;. It was the first confirmed increase in grades since Wolfgang Gullich&#x27;s ascent of &quot;Action Directe&quot; , a decade earlier. Sharma&#x27;s ascent of the route was captured in Josh Lowell&#x27;s 2002 film, &quot;Dosage Volume 1&quot;. Days later, Sharma won the Munich leg of the IFSC World Cup in bouldering, only to be disqualified on testing positive for marijuana.

===2002–2008 (to &quot;Jumbo Love&quot;)===

After &quot;Realization&quot;, Sharma considered quitting climbing and went on Buddhist pilgrimages. A 2003 trip to Mallorca, Spain to meet Miquel Riera, a pioneer of deep-water soloing, led him to &quot;fall in love with climbing all over again&quot;. Sharma largely abandoned competitions, to focus on &quot;King Lines&quot;, a term he adopted for iconic routes that motivated him. In 2004, Sharma solved the boulder problem &quot;Practice of the Wild&quot; , and in 2005 solved the dramatic roof of &quot;Witness the Fitness&quot; , followed by redpointing &quot;Dreamcatcher&quot; , regarded as one of North America&#x27;s most iconic sport climbs. In 2006, he made an early repeat of &quot;La Rambla&quot; , and in 2006, after 50 attempts, stuck the crux dyno of &quot;Es Pontàs&quot; in Mallorca, the world&#x27;s first-ever DWS route. Some of Sharma&#x27;s climbs from this era are in the iconic and award-winning 2007 climbing film, &quot;King Lines&quot;.

In 2007, Sharma moved to Lleida, a town near the Spanish Pyrenees, in Catalonia, Spain, and over the next five years, created an unprecedented series of new to sport climbs, predominantly in Catalonian limestone crags (namely Oliana, Siurana, Santa Linya and Margalef), starting with the classic of &quot;Papichulo &quot; in May 2008. In September 2008, Sharma made a trip back to the United States and climbed the world&#x27;s first-ever consensus route when he freed Randy Leavitt&#x27;s bolted route, &quot;Jumbo Love&quot; in Clark Mountain in California.

=== 2008–2013 (to &quot;La Dura Dura&quot;) ===
Sharma said that after climbing &quot;Jumbo Love&quot;, he needed to change his approach. His previous breakthroughs had been on routes established and bolted by other climbers who had given up on them, and now he needed to find his own limit saying: &quot;I wanted to push myself to the next level. Where is that? I had to discover it. That was a big process in itself. So I bolted all these routes [in Spain]. And a lot of them ended up being that next level&quot;. The period saw Sharma bolt and free numerous new extreme -graded &quot;King Lines&quot;, including &quot;&quot; (2008), &quot;Neanderthal&quot; (2009), and &quot;First Round First Minute&quot; (2011), each a major project in itself and since regarded as important classics, with Sharma saying &quot;That&#x27;s the thing about being on the cutting edge. You have to invent it&quot;.

In 2011, Sharma invited the then 19-year-old climbing prodigy Adam Ondra, to try an Oliana route he had bolted in 2009 called &quot;La Dura Dura&quot;, which Sharma himself had given up on saying &quot;I never saw myself being able to climb it.&quot;, and &quot;I figured it would be for the next generation&quot;. For the next year, the two climbers worked the route in a collaborative process that saw Ondra make the first ascent in February 2013, and Sharma make the first repeat in March 2013. &quot;National Geographic&quot; called their collaboration a defining moment in the sport of rock climbing, when the title of &quot;world&#x27;s best climber&quot; had begun to pass from one generation to the next. Both Ondra and Sharma declared the collaboration to be a very positive experience with Sharma saying post his March ascent: &quot;It was a healthy process for both of us, we fed off each other&#x27;s motivation and through him, I think I became a better climber myself&quot;. Their collaboration was documented in &quot;Reel Rock 7&quot; (2012), and &quot;La Dura Complete&quot; (2013).

===Post 2013===

At , &quot;La Dura Dura&quot; would hold the rank of &quot;world&#x27;s hardest climb&quot; until Ondra climbed &quot;Silence&quot; at in 2017, and while Sharma would put up several more &quot;King Lines&quot; over the next 5 years, it marked the high-point in terms of his hardest route. In 2015, he freed &quot;El Bon Combat&quot;, considered at the time to be close to , and in 2016 he soloed &quot;Alesha&quot;, the world&#x27;s first DWS route. One of Sharma&#x27;s unfinished projects was a potential route in Oliana beside &quot;La Dura Dura&quot; called &quot;Le Blond&quot;, named in memory of Patrick Edlinger; it remains unfinished. In March 2023, aged 41, Sharma made the first redpoint of &quot;Sleeping Lion&quot;, a route beside &quot;La Rambla&quot; in Spain, which he described as the hardest thing he had done in over eight years. After completing the second ascent of the route in January 2024, Alexander Megos proposed that &quot;Sleeping Lion&quot; be downgraded to . At the same time in 2023, noting that neighboring &quot;Golpe de Estado&quot; has never had a third ascent, Sharma wondered if it was a really graded route, which would have made it the world&#x27;s first-ever at that grade.

==Legacy==
Sharma is widely considered one of the greatest and most important rock climbers in the history of the sport. Sharma took on the title of &quot;world&#x27;s strongest sport climber&quot; in 2001 from Wolfgang Gullich (who dominated in the decade from the early 1980s to the early 1990s), and passed it on to Adam Ondra (who dominated after 2012). In 2003, the &quot;LA Times&quot; called him the &quot;greatest natural rock climber in the world&quot;. In 2007, Melissa Block on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, introduced him saying &quot;Chris Sharma is hailed as the world&#x27;s best rock climber, a pioneer who has mastered some of the most spectacular and difficult routes in the history of the sport&quot;. In 2016, &quot;Outside&quot; said &quot;Sharma shaped modern rock climbing. Whatever he thought was cool, we followed. Bouldering. Projecting hard sport routes. Deep water soloing. In 2022, &quot;Climbing&quot; said: &quot;The pioneering American sport climber is among the best to ever tie in, and was arguably the world&#x27;s strongest rock climber for almost 20 years&quot;.

Sharma is noted for a &quot;humble softly-spoken meditative disposition&quot; (who often leaves it to others to grade his routes) coupled with a &quot;highly aggressive and dynamic&quot; climbing style. In 2016, &quot;Climbing&quot; said: &quot;Over the past three decades, Sharma has cultivated a mellow Southern California persona, but in reality, he&#x27;s one of the most competitive, focused, and driven athletes out there&quot;. His demeanor has been ascribed to his Buddhist raising; the &quot;LA Times&quot; called him &quot;the Karma Climber&quot;. He has credited Zen meditation techniques with helping him on routes, or when seeking direction and motivation. Sharma was also known for eschewing any gym-based training (including fingerboards or cross-training) or dieting, preferring to climb as his sole method of training.

Sharma is credited with developing the commercial potential of extreme sport climbing, with &quot;Climbing&quot; saying &quot;Not only did Sharma have the guns to become the first human to climb 5.15, he had the genius to see the potential, coupled with the commitment to spend months and years of his life proving it&quot;, and calling Sharma &quot;arguably the highest-paid pro climber in the world&quot;. &quot;Outside&quot; added, &quot;Before Sharma figured out how to balance elite performance with making a living, &quot;professional climber&quot; was an oxymoron. Sharma&#x27;s commercial appeal, and becoming one of the most filmed climbers, was attributed to his focus on &quot;King Lines&quot;, which Sharma described as: &quot;It&#x27;s not enough to do something hard; it needs to be in an amazing position, a route that asks you to pour your heart and soul into climbing it&quot;.

Sharma is the founder of the rock climbing gym Sender One, headquartered in Santa Ana, California, which he opened in 2013 as a business partnership with Walltopia, who was a sponsor of Sharma. In 2015, he opened a second gym, Sharma Climbing BCN, in Barcelona in Spain, and in 2021 he opened a third gym, Sharma Climbing Gava, on the outskirts of Barcelona.

Sharma was in a long-term public relationship with the Spanish professional climber , and they lived together in Oliana. In August 2015, he married Venezuelan model and television personality Jimena Alarcón, and the couple moved from Oliana to Barcelona. Their first child, a daughter named Alana, was born in June 2016, and their second child, a son, in 2019.

===Zen===

Sharma&#x27;s parents were practising Zen Buddhists (although they did not live in at the Mount Madonna ashram) and for long periods Sharma has followed Zen routines (including daily 5.45am temple meditation). Sharma has been on various Asian pilgrimages lasting several months, including the Shikoku Pilgrimage in Japan that he undertook after climbing &quot;Realization&quot; in 2001.

The 2010 book &quot;Climbing: Because It&#x27;s There (Philosophy for Everyone)&quot; discussed the impact of Zen Buddhism on Sharma saying: &quot;Sharma&#x27;s affinity for Buddhism, and Zen in particular, is well documented in film and print. He exemplifies the spirit of Zen, being humble (but potent), ordinary (but extraordinary), self-aware, and most of all, authentic&quot;.

Sharma has however rejected the label of &quot;spiritual climber&quot;, saying in 2011: &quot;To be stereotyped like that definitely detracts from me personally. Like I said, I&#x27;m totally happy talking about this stuff. I just don’t want to make some image for myself like I’m some sort of saint or something. I get frustrated, and I get bummed out&quot;. Sharma is no longer a practicing Zen Buddhist, and said in 2022: &quot;Climbing is fully engaging… it’s an easy way to access that [meditative] state of mind… easier than sitting down and meditating&quot;.

<text>Arthur Claud Spencer Chichester, 4th Baron Templemore (12 September 1880 – 2 October 1953), was a British soldier and politician of Anglo-Irish descent.

==Early life==
Chichester was the eldest son of the 3rd Baron Templemore and his wife, Evelyn (&quot;née&quot; Stracey-Clitherow). From his father&#x27;s second marriage, he had a younger half-brother, Sir Gerald Chichester, a diplomat and courtier who served as Private Secretary to Queen Mary.

He was educated at Harrow and trained at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, before being commissioned into the Royal Fusiliers as a second lieutenant on 20 January 1900. 

==Career==
He fought in the Second Boer War, and was promoted to lieutenant on 23 February 1901, staying in South Africa until the end of the war, when he returned home on the SS &quot;Assaye&quot; in September 1902. When he was back in the United Kingdom, he returned as a regular lieutenant in his regiment in November 1902. He later served in Mauritius, India, and the British expedition to Tibet.

By now a captain, Chichester distinguished himself in the First World War with his service in France and Italy, becoming a major with the Irish Guards and winning, along with several other awards, the DSO (1918) and an OBE (1919).

In 1924, he succeeded his father as Baron Templemore, and three years later was appointed Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Earl of Onslow as Under-Secretary of State for War and Paymaster General.

Lord Templemore was a Lord in Waiting to George V from February to June 1929, and again from 1931 to 1934. He was also Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard for 11 years (1934–1945), and served as Conservative Chief Whip in the House of Lords (1940–1945). He was appointed KCVO in 1938. He was a Deputy Lieutenant of Hampshire.

==Personal life==
Templemore married the Hon. Clare Meriel Wingfield, second daughter of Mervyn Wingfield, 7th Viscount Powerscourt, at St George&#x27;s, Hanover Square, London, in 1911. They had three sons:

* Major Hon. Arthur Patrick Spencer Chichester (23 March 1914 – 23 December 1942), killed in action in North Africa in World War II
* Major Hon. Dermot Richard Claud Chichester (18 April 1916 – 19 April 2007)
* Lord Desmond Clive Chichester MC (1920–2000)

Lord Templemore died in 1953 in County Wicklow. His second son succeeded him in the barony and in 1975 inherited the title of Marquess of Donegall in the Peerage of Ireland from a distant cousin.

<doc id="868206" wikidata="Q520979" url="?curid=868206" title="Arthur Goldreich">
<text>Arthur Goldreich (25 December 1929 – 24 May 2011) was a South African-Israeli abstract painter and a key figure in the anti-apartheid movement in the country of his birth and a critic of the form of Zionism practiced in Israel.

==Early life==
Goldreich was born in Pietersburg, South Africa, and settled in Palestine, where he participated in the 1948 Arab-Israeli war as a member of the Palmach, the elite military wing of the Haganah. In time he became a leading figure at Bezalel Academy in Jerusalem. In 1966, he became the head of Industrial and Environmental Design Department, which he helped transform into an internationally recognized center for design.

By the age of 33, Goldreich had moved back to South Africa where he became one of the country&#x27;s most successful artists. In 1955, he won South Africa&#x27;s Best Young Painter Award for his figures in black and white, but to the Prime Minister Hendrik Verwoerd&#x27;s government, he was a key suspect in the clandestine operations of the anti-apartheid underground.

== Escape from jail ==

Goldreich and Harold Wolpe, a lawyer, used South African Communist Party funds to buy Liliesleaf Farm in Rivonia for use as a secret meeting place by leaders of the banned African National Congress (ANC) and its armed wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe. Goldreich and Wolpe also helped locate sabotage sites for Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military arm of the ANC, and draft a disciplinary code for guerrillas.

In 1963, Liliesleaf Farm was raided by the police, leading to the arrest of most of the ANC leadership, including Goldreich. Wolpe was arrested shortly after the raid and was held with Goldreich at Marshall Square prison in the city.

The two met up with Moosa Moolla and Abdulhay Jassat, members of the Natal Indian Congress, allied to the African National Congress. Moolla and Jassat had been held in solitary confinement, where they had been tortured (they were believed to be the first political activists tortured in South African jails). Eventually the four men, working together with the aid of a prison warden, escaped successfully from custody, splitting up outside the prison (with Goldreich disguised as a priest). 

Wolpe and Goldreich spent several days hiding in and around Johannesburg&#x27;s suburbs to avoid capture. Eventually, they were driven to Swaziland, and from there were flown to Botswana, still disguised as priests to avoid being identified by potentially pro-South African British colonial authorities (at this time Swaziland was not independent).

== Criticism of Israel ==

According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, by February 2006, Goldreich was living in the city of Herzliya. &quot;There was a time when he believed the young Jewish state might provide the example of a better way for the country of his birth. Goldreich saw Israel as closer to the white regime he fought against and modern South Africa as providing the model. Israeli governments, he said, ultimately proved more interested in territory than peace, and along the way Zionism mutated.

Goldreich speaks of the &#x27;bantustanism we see through a policy of occupation and separation&#x27;, the &#x27;abhorrent&#x27; racism in Israeli society all the way up to cabinet ministers who advocate the forced removal of Arabs, and &#x27;the brutality and inhumanity of what is imposed on the people of the occupied territories of Palestine&#x27;. &#x27;Don&#x27;t you find it horrendous that this people and this state, which only came into existence because of the defeat of fascism and Nazism in Europe, and in the conflict six million Jews paid with their lives for no other reason than that they were Jews, is it not abhorrent that in this place there are people who can say these things and do these things?&#x27; he asks.

<text>Charles Joseph &quot;Curry&quot; Foley (January 16, 1856 – October 20, 1898) was an Irish born professional baseball player who played in the National League (NL) for five seasons from 1879 to 1883. He played as a pitcher, outfielder and first baseman for two teams in the NL; the Boston Red Caps (1879–80) and Buffalo Bisons (1881–83).

==Early life==
Foley was born Milltown, County Kerry, to Charles Foley (a farmer) and Betsy Gearin. His family emigrated to the United States, arriving in New York City on June 27, 1863.

==Baseball career==
Foley played in 337 games; 204 in the outfield, 69 as a pitcher, and 54 at first base. He compiled six home runs, 128 RBIs, and a .286 batting average as a batter, and posted a 27–27 win–loss record, 127 strikeouts and a 3.54 ERA as a pitcher in 442 innings pitched.

===First major league cycle===
On May 25, 1882, Foley became the first major league player to officially hit for the cycle. In a game against the Cleveland Blues, Foley hit a home run in the first inning, a triple in the second inning, a single in third inning and a double in the fifth inning. 

==Post-baseball life==
On October 23, 1883, Foley became a naturalized citizen of the United States. Foley was working as a laborer, and listed as single when died at the age of 42 in Boston, Massachusetts. His cause of death was cirrhosis of the liver, and he is interred at Mount Cavalry Cemetery in Roslindale, Massachusetts.

<doc id="868220" wikidata="Q7181502" url="?curid=868220" title="Phi Alpha Theta">
<text>Phi Alpha Theta () is an American honor society for undergraduate and graduate students and professors of history. It was created in 1921 at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville, Arkansas. It has more than 400,000 members, with new members numbering about 9,000 a year through its 970 chapters. 

== History ==
Nels Andrew N. Cleven, a professor of history at the University of Arkansas, played an active role in fraternity and sorority social affairs and became inspired by the structure of those groups to create a society for historical study. Cleven invited students to a meeting to form what was then called the University Historical Society on March 14, 1921, establishing the society on March 17, 1921. In April, the decision was made for the society to be known by the Greek letters Phi Alpha Theta.

== Symbols ==
The description of the society&#x27;s emblem is precise: The emblem of the Society is a gold disc, &quot;&quot;&quot;with the edge milled to represent a serpent&#x27;s body, the forepart of the serpent&#x27;s body being on the right side of the badge, and the eye shall be represented by a red jewel.&quot; On the face is a raised six-pointed star faced with black, &quot;and bearing in gold the Greek letters Phi Alpha Theta horizontally across the middle, and the points bearing the Greek letters psi, pi, alpha, lambda, upsilon, and psi [, , , , , and again] in clockwise rotation beginning at the uppermost point.&quot; The emblem can be jeweled.

Its emblem may be mounted upon a gold key, &quot;&quot;&quot;which shall be in the form of a rectangle nineteen by twenty-one millimeters, and the corners of which shall be cut along the arcs of circles having a radius of four millimeters, the centers of said circles being at the corners of the key, and the edges of the key shall be [beveled] to a distance not to exceed one millimeter from the edge.&quot; A cylindrical stem projects from the top of the emblem finished with a ring. The cylinder projects from the lower edge of the key, similarly.

Phi Alpha Theta&#x27;s motto is &quot;Seek Truth: The society&#x27;s colors are &quot;Madonna red&quot; and &quot;Madonna blue&quot;. Its flower is the red rose. Its quarterly publication is &quot;The Historian&quot;, which includes articles and book reviews. &quot;Voces Novae: Chapman University Historical Review&quot; was founded in the Spring of 2009 by the Alpha Mu Gamma chapter of Phi Alpha Theta at Chapman University.

== Governance ==
The society&#x27;s national headquarters and the journal&#x27;s editorial offices are located at the University of South Florida.

Hosok O of Utah Tech University the current president, and Kyriakos Nalmpantis of Baldwin Wallace University is the vice president of Phi Alpha Theta National History Honor Society. Debra A. Mulligan is chair of the Advisory Board. Kees Boterbloem of the University of South Florida is the managing editor of &quot;The Historian&quot;, and Jonathan Scott Perry also of USF is the journal&#x27;s book review editor.

== Membership ==
Undergraduate students must have a 3.0 overall grade point average, and at least a 3.1 average in their history courses. Undergraduate candidates must also be in the top 35% of their class. Students need not be majoring in history but must have taken at least four history courses at the university level. Specific universities may develop higher qualifications. For example, the College of Staten Island&#x27;s PAT chapter requires undergraduate students to have a GPA of or better than 3.25, a History GPA of or better than 3.5, and at least 16 hours completed in History classes. Graduate students must have a GPA of better than 3.5 and have completed approximately 30% of the residence requirements for the master&#x27;s degree.

<doc id="868221" wikidata="Q885559" url="?curid=868221" title="Richard Bryan">
<text>Richard Hudson Bryan (born July 16, 1937) is an American retired politician and attorney who served as the 25th Governor of Nevada from 1983 to 1989 and as a United States Senator representing Nevada from 1989 until 2001. A Democrat, Bryan previously served as the state&#x27;s attorney general and a member of the State Senate.

==Early life==
Bryan was born in Washington, D.C., and graduated from the University of Nevada at Reno in 1959 where he was a member of Alpha Tau Omega and the president of ASUN. He earned his J.D. degree from the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. In 1963 he was admitted to the Nevada Bar. He was Clark County&#x27;s first public defender.

==Political career==

Bryan served as a member of the Nevada Senate from 1972 to 1978. In 1979, Bryan became the Nevada Attorney General, and served in the position until 1983. In 1982, Bryan challenged incumbent Republican Nevada Governor Robert List, who was running for reelection. He defeated List and became governor in January 1983. Bryan was easily reelected in 1986, defeating Nevada State Treasurer Patricia Cafferata.

=== U.S. Senate ===
By 1987, Bryan was encouraged by several prominent politicians, including Harry Reid and Alan Cranston, to run for the U.S. Senate. He declared his candidacy shortly after, and in the 1988 U.S. Senate election, he defeated incumbent Republican Senator Chic Hecht. He was sworn in at the convening of the 101st Congress on January 3, 1989. During his tenure in the Senate, Bryan served on the Finance, Banking, Intelligence and Commerce Committees.

Bryan was an opponent of Search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI), stating: &quot;As of today millions have been spent and we have yet to bag a single little green fellow. Not a single Martian has said take me to your leader, and not a single flying saucer has applied for FAA approval.&quot; He introduced an amendment to the 1994 budget that secured the cancellation of the High Resolution Microwave Survey and terminated NASA&#x27;s SETI efforts less than one year after their launch. Bryan ran for reelection in the Senate in 1994, easily defeating Republican challenger Hal Furman.

Bryan also focused on preventing Yucca Mountain from being used as a nuclear waste long-term storage site. Though the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository would be built during Bryan&#x27;s time in the Senate, his opposition, delayed any actual storage from occurring. This opposition would continue after Bryan had retired before plans for storage were discontinued by President Barack Obama.

Bryan opted not to run for a third term in the Senate in 2000.

<text>The NuMachine, or Nu Machine, is an early microprocessor-based computer workstation designed to interface with local area networks. It was developed in the late 1970s at MIT&#x27;s Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) by Professor Steve Ward and his research group in concert with Western Digital. The NuMachine is 68010-based running at 10 MHz. The project included the development of TRIX, a Unix operating system variant.

The NuMachine was first developed commercially by Western Digital, but they decided not to enter the workstation business. It was bought by Texas Instruments in 1983. Texas Instruments dropped the NuMachine development in 1985 in favor of the TI Explorer.

Its main legacy is a bus architecture called NuBus that was later adopted by Apple Computer for its Macintosh II and by NeXT, and influenced the design of the PCI bus. The TRIX operating system was used by the GNU Project for its first attempt at an operating system kernel.

<text>Needful Things is a 1991 horror novel by American author Stephen King. It is the first novel King wrote after his rehabilitation from drug and alcohol addiction. It was made into a film of the same name in 1993 which was directed by Fraser C. Heston. The story focuses on a shop that sells collectibles and antiques, managed by Leland Gaunt, a new arrival to the town of Castle Rock, Maine, the setting of many King stories. Gaunt often asks customers to perform a prank or mysterious deed in exchange for the item they are drawn to. As time goes by, the many deeds and pranks lead to increasing aggression among the townspeople, as well as chaos and death. A protagonist of the book is Alan Pangborn, previously seen in Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;The Dark Half&quot;.

According to the cover, this novel is &quot;The Last Castle Rock Story.&quot; However, the town later serves as the setting for the short story &quot;It Grows on You&quot; (published in King&#x27;s 1993 collection &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot; which, according to King, serves as an epilogue to &quot;Needful Things)&quot;, as well as King&#x27;s 2017 novella &quot;Gwendy&#x27;s Button Box&quot; (cowritten with Richard Chizmar) and his 2018 novella &quot;Elevation&quot;.

==Plot summary==
A new shop named &quot;Needful Things&quot; opens in the small town of Castle Rock, Maine, sparking the curiosity of its citizens. The proprietor, Leland Gaunt, is a charming elderly gentleman purportedly from Akron, Ohio who always seems to have an item in stock that is perfectly suited to any customer. The prices are surprisingly low, considering the merchandise – such as a rare Sandy Koufax baseball card, a picture of Elvis Presley, a carnival glass lampshade, and a fragment of petrified wood stated to be from Noah&#x27;s Ark – but he expects each customer to also play a &quot;prank&quot; on someone else in town. Each customer enters a trance and becomes highly agreeable when making a deal with Gaunt, afterwards forgetting anything abnormal about the encounter. Gaunt has complete knowledge of the long-standing private histories and conflicts between the various townspeople, and the pranks are his means of forcing them to escalate.

Gaunt quickly marks local Sheriff Alan Pangborn and Polly Chalmers, Alan&#x27;s sweetheart and proprietor of a local sewing shop, as &quot;tough customers&quot; who are likely to question and interfere with him. Gaunt avoids Alan and offers Polly an ancient charm that relieves the terrible arthritic pain in her hands, as well as giving Gaunt control over her. Local boy Brian Rusk vandalizes the home of Wilma Jerzyck, who loathes Nettie Cobb, Polly&#x27;s housekeeper, and alcoholic Hugh Priest kills Nettie&#x27;s dog. Nettie and Wilma then kill each other with knives in a public confrontation, increasing tensions in town.

Other rivalries begin to fester, spurred by the personal motives and secrets of the people involved. Gaunt hires petty criminal John &quot;Ace&quot; Merrill as his assistant, providing him with high-quality cocaine and hinting at buried treasure that could relieve the debt he owes to drug dealers. Ace&#x27;s first assignment is to retrieve crates of pistols, ammunition, and blasting caps from a garage in Boston; Gaunt soon begins to sell the pistols to his customers so they can protect their purchases.

The truth is eventually revealed: for centuries, Gaunt has tricked people into buying worthless junk that magically appears to be whatever they treasure or desire most. They then become so paranoid about keeping their items safe that they eagerly buy up the weapons that he offers, until the whole town is caught up in madness and violence. Ace begins to suspect the supernatural background of his new employer, but Gaunt keeps him in line through intimidation and promises of revenge against Alan and Castle Rock.

Several cases of violence happen simultaneously: gym coach Lester Pratt attacks Deputy John LaPointe (his fiancée&#x27;s ex-boyfriend) and is killed in self-defense; Hugh Priest and bar owner Henry Beaufort kill each other in a shootout; Brian commits suicide out of guilt for his role in Wilma and Nettie&#x27;s deaths; and town selectman Danforth &quot;Buster&quot; Keeton (who has been secretly embezzling from public funds to fuel his gambling addiction) attacks Deputy Norris Ridgewick before escaping to his home and killing his wife, Myrtle, with a hammer. Buster is then recruited by Ace to join him in his work for Gaunt. With the violence in Castle Rock rapidly escalating, Ace and Buster plant dynamite all over town, using the caps Ace brought back. Alan sets out to kill Ace, led by Gaunt to believe him responsible for the car accident that killed his wife and son. Polly realizes the evil of the charm she bought and destroys it. Norris attempts suicide, realizing that his prank on Priest led to the fatal shootout, but decides to go to the police station to help. As the bombs explode, Buster is wounded by Norris and is put out of his misery by Ace. Taking Polly hostage, Ace demands that Alan hand over a hoard of buried cash he allegedly stole. Norris kills Ace, leaving Alan to face off against Gaunt.

Using sleight of hand and magic novelties that suddenly come to life, Alan forces Gaunt back and grabs his valise, which contains the souls of his customers. Gaunt flees the scene, his car turning into a horse-drawn wagon (with the words CAVEAT EMPTOR - &quot;Let the buyer beware&quot; - written on the side), and the survivors are left to ponder an uncertain future. The novel ends as it begins, in first-person direct address indicating that a new and mysterious shop called &quot;Answered Prayers&quot; is about to open in a small Iowa town –ominously implying that Gaunt is ready to begin his business cycle again.

==Characters==
*Alan Pangborn: the Sheriff of Castle Rock and the main protagonist. He appeared in &quot;The Dark Half&quot;, another novel by King. He quits his job as sheriff at the end of the novel.
*Leland Gaunt: Presumably a demon in human form (implied in the film to be Satan), who has spent centuries traveling about the world and tricking people into selling their souls to him, usually in exchange for useless objects disguised as the things they want most. Gaunt&#x27;s plans are ultimately thwarted and he is forced to leave Castle Rock without the souls he collected.
*Brian Rusk: An 11-year-old boy who becomes the first customer of &quot;Needful Things,&quot; buying a rare Sandy Koufax baseball card. Brian&#x27;s prank leads to the death of Nettie and Wilma. Brian is overcome with guilt, sinking into depression. Brian ultimately shoots himself with his father&#x27;s gun in front of his little brother Sean, warning Sean to stay out of &quot;Needful Things&quot;.
*Patricia &quot;Polly&quot; Chalmers: known as the town&#x27;s most eccentric woman, Polly was originally a Castle Rock native but the residents consider her an &quot;out-of-towner&quot; after she lives in San Francisco for years before returning. She suffers from arthritis which causes severe pain in her hands. After she accepts a magical amulet from Gaunt that relieves her pain, she becomes susceptible to his influence and is turned against Alan by fabricated evidence that he investigated the death of the infant child she had in San Francisco. Polly is able to realize Alan is innocent, destroys the amulet and the spider creature inside it, and convinces Alan not to kill Ace.
*Norris Ridgewick: one of the town&#x27;s deputies and Sheriff Pangborn&#x27;s closest ally. He buys a Bazun fishing rod from Gaunt in exchange for a prank on Hugh Priest, leading to the deaths of both Priest and Henry Beaumont. Ridgewick is assaulted by Keeton, then attempts suicide, but after realizing how worthless his fishing rod is plays a key role in Gaunt&#x27;s defeat. Later books reveal that he would take Pangborn&#x27;s place as sheriff of Castle Rock
*John &quot;Ace&quot; Merrill: the town&#x27;s resident &quot;bad boy&quot; and petty criminal, who is back after time in prison. Gaunt hires Ace into his service, and manipulates him into deciding to kill Alan. Ace is ultimately shot dead by Ridgewick when he goes after Polly, his death not being noticed by Alan or Gaunt. Merrill also appears in King&#x27;s novella &quot;The Body&quot;.
*Danforth &quot;Buster&quot; Keeton: the town&#x27;s head selectman, who often uses the authority of his office to intimidate others. He is also a secret gambling addict who has embezzled funds from the town. Keeton suffers from paranoid delusions, believing that a group known as &quot;They&quot; are out to get him. Keeton is mortally wounded by a gunshot from Norris, and Ace finishes him off with a headshot.
*Wilma Jerzyck: The town bully and first victim of one of Mr. Gaunt&#x27;s pranks, performed by Brian Rusk, which starts the cycle. Wilma is a cruel woman, often starting fights and begins tormenting Nettie after the prank. Wilma and Nettie both attack and kill each other.
*Netitia &quot;Nettie&quot; Cobb: Polly&#x27;s best friend and housekeeper, and enemy of Wilma Jerzyck. Nettie is mentally unstable, having killed her abusive husband. Nettie is implied to develop a crush on Gaunt, and is ultimately killed when she attacks Wilma for killing her dog (a deed actually committed by Hugh Priest).
*Myrtle Keeton: Lonely wife of Buster Keeton. Myrtle buys a porcelain doll from Mr. Gaunt. Myrtle is ultimately beaten to death by a deranged Keeton with a hammer.
*Hugh Priest: Local drunk who purchases a foxtail from Gaunt. Priest kills Nettie&#x27;s dog Raider for a prank, and spirals into madness. Priest is killed in a firefight with Henry Beaumont.
*Henry Beaumont: Owner of the local bar; incurs Hugh&#x27;s wrath after refusing to serve him any more alcohol one night and then taking his car keys because he was too drunk to drive home. He and Hugh kill each other in a shootout at the bar.
*Sally Ratcliffe: A speech teacher and a deeply religious woman, who buys a wooden splinter from Gaunt that is supposedly a remnant of Noah&#x27;s Ark. She later hangs herself out of guilt after taking part in the town-wide pranks and discovering that her fiancé has supposedly cheated on her with another woman.

== Relation to other works ==
In the notes to &quot;Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes&quot;, King suggested that his short story &quot;It Grows on You&quot; (originally written in 1973, and published in revised format in 1993) could serve as a sequel to &quot;Needful Things&quot;.

==Film adaptation==

In 1993, a film adaptation of King&#x27;s book directed by Fraser C. Heston and starring Max von Sydow, Ed Harris, Bonnie Bedelia and J. T. Walsh was released in theaters. It received generally negative reviews from critics, with an overall rating of 32% on Rotten Tomatoes.

==In popular culture==
The &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; episode &quot;Something Ricked This Way Comes&quot; features the Devil as the proprietor of a store named &quot;Needful Things&quot;, which sells cursed items.

<doc id="868235" wikidata="Q1436500" url="?curid=868235" title="Khol">
<text>The khol is a terracotta two-sided drum used in northern and eastern India for accompaniment with devotional music (&quot;bhakti&quot;). It is also known as a &quot;mridanga&quot; (&lt; Sanskrit + , ), not to be confused with &quot;mridangam&quot;. It originates from the Indian states of Odisha, West Bengal, Assam and Manipur. The drum is played with palms and fingers of both hands.

== Description ==
The khol is regarded as resembling to the ancient &quot;gopuchha&quot; shape of drums, as described in Natya Shastra. The right face of the drum has a high pitch and produces a metallic sound, whereas the left face, produces a lower bass sound. The larger side can be tuned with humidity. On a humid day the larger side will loosen up and vibrate more producing the lower sound. During a dry day the side tightens up producing a high pitched sound. Players of the instrument will add water to their drum if they feel it does not produce a low enough sound. They will put a bit of water on their finger and spread it around the edge of the large side. They will either let it sit there for a few minutes, or manually stretch it with their palm. 

==Construction==

The khol is a drum with a hollow earthen body, with drumheads at both ends, one far smaller than the other. The drumheads are made of cow or goat skin, and are three-layered and treated with a circle of rice paste, glue, and iron known as &quot;syahi&quot;. Some modern instruments are made with a fibreglass body and synthetic drumheads.

==History==

There are so many histories about its origin. Different types of Khol are available in north eastern India. Odisha, Manipur, Bengal and Assamese Khol are commonly found in different forms. The wooden khol was made into terracotta by the Assamese polymath Sankardev.

==Use==
The khol is considered an integral part of the Ek Saran Naam Dharma culture and is used in &quot;bhaona&quot; (plays), &quot;gayan-bayan&#x27;, &quot;prasanga-kirtan&quot; and &quot;borgeet&quot;s (lyrical songs) in Assam. Assamese polymath Sankardeva is known to have adapted and evolved the tradition of &quot;gayan-bayan&quot; by using musical instruments like the khol and taal. According to Assamese Neo-Vaishnavites, playing the khol is regarded as a holy activity and it is also considered to be one of the most important traditional percussion instruments. It is also a key musical instrument that accompanies a Sattriya performance.

The instrument is used in every Vishnu (Jagannath, Radha Krishna) temple in Odisha during arati rituals.
The drum is used to accompany Odia, Bengali kirtans by medieval poets like Chandidas, Govindadasa and Gyanadas. It is also used to accompany Gaudiya Nritya, one of the nine Indian classical dances (as recognized by Ministry of Culture, and not recognized by Sangeet Natak Akademi).

In the International Society for Krishna Consciousness (ISKCON, &quot;Hare Krishnas&quot;) and in Gaudiya Vaishnava societies, the khol is the primary drum for bhajan and kirtan.

<text>Calma Company, based in Sunnyvale, California, was, between 1965 and 1988, a vendor of digitizers and minicomputer-based graphics systems targeted at the cartographic and electronic, mechanical and architectural design markets.

In the electronic area, the company&#x27;s best known products were GDS (an abbreviation for &quot;Graphic Design System&quot; ), introduced in 1971, and GDS II, introduced in 1978. By the end of the 1970s, Calma systems were installed in virtually every major semiconductor manufacturing company.

The external format of the GDS II database, known as GDS II Stream Format, became a &quot;de facto&quot; standard for the interchange of IC mask information. The use of this format persisted into the 21st century, long after the demise of the GDS II computer system.
In the integrated circuit industry jargon of 2008, &quot;GDS II&quot; referred no longer to the computer system, but to the format itself. Vendors of electronic design automation software often use the phrase &quot;from RTL to GDSII&quot; to imply that their system will take users from a high-level logic design to a completed integrated circuit layout ready for delivery to the mask vendor.

In the mechanical area, the DDM (for &quot;Design Drafting and Manufacturing&quot;) product was introduced in 1977. It was later extended, under the name &quot;Dimension III&quot;, to address the architecture, engineering and construction (AEC) market. By 1983, these two products together accounted for 60% of Calma&#x27;s revenue. 
Dimension III continued to be used as late as the late 1990s.

== History ==
Calma Company was incorporated in California on November 13, 1963. Its initial business was as a product distributor, continuing the business of a previously existing partnership of the same name. The company took its name from its founders, Calvin and Irma Louise Hefte.

In 1965 Calma introduced the Calma Digitizer, a device consisting of a table-like surface with constrained cursor, whereby an operator could enter coordinate data from a paper drawing and have it turned into computer readable form.

In about 1969, the company undertook to develop a minicomputer-based graphics system built around a digitizer. This effort was spurred by the arrival of Josef Sukonick, a recent MIT math PhD who had become aware of the market potential for such a system for integrated circuit (IC) design through his work at the CAD (computer-aided design) group of Fairchild Semiconductor in Sunnyvale, CA. The GDS software system was conceived and, in its initial implementation, almost single-handedly built by Dr. Sukonick. The first GDS system was shipped in late 1971 to Intel.

The growth of sales of GDS paralleled that of the nascent integrated circuit industry. By August 1976 there were 121 GDS systems installed at 70 companies including many Fortune 500 corporations including Motorola, International Telephone &amp; Telegraph, Fairchild Semiconductor, and others. Of these, 43 were installed outside the U.S.

In 1978, Calma, which never had a public stock offering, was acquired by United Telecommunications, Inc., (UTI) of Kansas City, Missouri, for $17 million in stock. Calma became part of UTI&#x27;s United Computing Systems (UCS) operating unit. UTI took a hands-off approach to managing its acquisition, allowing Calma to continue largely unchanged on its growth path.

In 1978, Calma introduced GDS II (pronounced &quot;G-D-S two&quot;), a modernized replacement for GDS. With its 32-bit database, GDS II met the need for greater capacity and resolution in IC designs. GDS II quickly replaced GDS as the data entry system of choice for many IC design groups. By late 1980, there were 171 installed GDS II systems.

In December 1980, the sale of Calma by UTI to General Electric (GE) was announced. The sale price was $110 million, with an additional $60 million contingent on Calma&#x27;s profits over the next five years. The acquisition was completed on April 1, 1981. 

GE had grander designs for Calma than had UTI. In addition to the hope of maintaining dominance in the IC market, GE aimed for Calma to expand in the architectural, engineering, manufacturing and construction markets – &quot;factory of the future&quot; was a prominent slogan. Due partly to a mass exodus of talent after GE moved its own people into key management positions, partly due to excessive expectations, the changing nature of the market and the inherent difficulty of keeping up with rapidly changing technology, these ambitions went largely unrealized.

Beginning in 1988, GE sold Calma. The electronic side of the business was sold to Valid Logic Systems in April 1988. (Valid in turn was acquired by Cadence Design Systems in 1991). The remainder of the business (mechanical/architectural) was acquired by Prime Computer in a sale completed in January 1989. Prime had just completed a hostile take-over of Computervision. Prime basically merged the Calma Mechanical and AEC product lines with Computervision. Computervision, including the Dimension III product, was acquired by Parametric Technology Corporation in 1998.

== Business and financial ==

The following data on sales, earnings, and employee count are drawn from a number of sources. Financial data 1973–1977 are from.

At the time of the 1978 acquisition by UTI, the largest shareholder was Calma board chairman Ronald D. Cone. He held 321,706 of Calma&#x27;s 635,266 outstanding shares.

=== Legal ===

In February 1977, Computervision (CV) filed suit in federal court over Calma&#x27;s hiring of a group of 5 employees from CV in San Diego. (This group developed Calma&#x27;s DDM product.) The CV suit against Calma and the five employees alleged breach of competition, breach of non-competition agreements, and interference with contractual relations. This draining lawsuit was finally settled out of court in October 1979. In the UTI acquisition of Calma in 1978, 5% of the newly issued stock was held in escrow as a reserve pending the outcome of this litigation.

=== Buildings ===

As early as 1970, Calma occupied a building at 707 Kifer Road in Sunnyvale. Roughly , the building consisted of a large warehouse/manufacturing area in the rear, with an office area of about 10 offices in the front. Somewhat later, an additional building to the rear (on San Gabriel Drive) was leased as a manufacturing/shipping area, bringing total square footage to 35,000.

In February 1978, the company relocated to a single-story building at 527 Lakeside Drive in Sunnyvale, part of the newly developed Oakmead Village industrial park.

Additional buildings were added as the employee count grew. In 1979, the R&amp;D department moved to a building at 212 Gibraltar Drive (corner of Borregas Avenue) in the Moffett Park area of Sunnyvale. Other buildings were added in the area.

In 1980 a new manufacturing facility was opened in Milpitas, California. 

In 1982 a new headquarters was opened in Santa Clara, California.

In 1984 Calma bought a facility near Dublin, Ireland, that had originally been built for Trilogy Systems.

=== General description (1978) ===

The following is quoted from:

Calma&#x27;s computer-aided design and drafting systems (also referred to as interactive graphics systems) are component hardware modules, electronic interfaces, and software programs. Most of the systems sold are constructed by combining available components to meet the requirements of the customers&#x27; specific design or drafting application. Calma&#x27;s systems enable customers to automate a wide variety of design and manufacturing processes which have previously been performed manually.

The primary hardware components of a system are a central processing unit, operator stations and plotter outputs.

Their GDS I and II software operated on Data General Corporation&#x27;s Nova and Eclipse line of 16 bit mini Computers. Sketches or layouts of electronic system were first manually drawn on mylar or paper to scale and were placed on large backlit 48 by 60 inch table digitizers. Using a moving stylus, these layouts were organized in layers, first placing the smaller common and custom circuits, created in a library, then manually traced their interconnecting circuitry on further layers, the completed layout then stored in computer files. 

Printed Circuit Boards (PCB&#x27;s) and Small Scale Integrated Circuits (SSIC) were manually traced buy an operator, usually a draftsman or electronic engineer then plotted on a large pen plotter (In later years to faster Electrostatic Plotters) to be visually inspected to confirm that the physical layout properly matched the schematic. Once the layout and schematics final edits were manually checked to confirm their accuracy, the multiple layers of the physical circuitry were sent to a film plotter to create masks for fabrication.

The central processing unit consists of a minicomputer, a computer console and page printer, a magnetic tape transport and a magnetic disk memory unit.
Other optional peripheral devices such as card readers and paper tape punches are also available. These components are interfaced with Calma-designed and manufactured controllers, and integrated into a single unit with system software designed and programmed by Calma.

An operator station consists of a digitizing device, an interactive cathode ray tube (CRT) display unit, coordinate readouts and a keyboard. The main difference between stations is in the type of digitizing input station used. The Calma digitizer is a backlit 48 by 60 inch table. To digitize analog graphical data directly on computer-compatible medium, the operator of the digitizer manually traces graphical data with a moveable stylus. The graphic tablet has a smaller surface and is operated with an electromechanical graphic pen and were used primary to edit an electronic layout once it was digitized.

The digitizing input station is linked by system software to the CRT display, which allows an almost instantaneous display of any segment of the source drawing or a graphic element from the library. The CRT display also has windowing and magnification capability.

An alphanumeric keyboard is used for entering text, scaling information, dimensions and commands, and an optional functional keyboard is available for entering frequently used functions, symbols and macro commands.

The output most commonly used in Calma&#x27;s systems is a graphic plotter. Calma software supports both on and off-line pen and photo plotting devices.

Calma&#x27;s computer-aided design systems are used in a wide variety of applications. To date systems have been sold principally to electronics firms for use in the design of integrated circuits, printed circuit boards and electrical schematics; to governmental agencies and public utilities for use in cartographic applications; and to manufacturing companies for use in the design of mechanical parts and systems.

=== GDS ===

=== GDS II ===

For an overview of the GDS II system as it was 1981, see. Some scanned product documents can be found at and.

The original GDS system used Data General mini-computers to digitize and assemble chip designs. The UI consisted of simple one or two letter commands, and a set of colored lights as a response. The operator typed a command, and if the green light came on, it was successful.

GDSII introduced an actual Command Line Interface (CLI), where the user typed commands that were echoed back to the screen. GDS systems had no text screen at all, just a &quot;green-screen&quot; oscilloscope type display. GDSII introduced a text display, using a regular text terminal in addition to the &#x27;scope screen, and also introduced the first color screens.

This ushered in the new method of &quot;online design&quot;, where the drafting employees actually sat at the screen and drew the chips. In the older GDS systems, an operator took the mylar drawings and digitized them in.

A typical GDSII system in 1980 would have a 300 MB disk, 1-2 MB of memory, using a 16-bit DG minicomputer and up to 4 screens. This cost over $500,000 in 1980 dollars.

=== DDM ===

DDM (short for &quot;Design, Drafting, Manufacturing&quot;) was a 3-dimensional wireframe computer-aided design application. In the mid-1980s, it was one of the top ten selling CAD packages on the market. By 2006, DDM continued to be supported by Parametric Technology Corporation as &quot;Dimension III&quot;.

The General Motors Central Foundry Division (GM-CFD) had applied DDM to the design of castings and tooling for automotive components such as engine blocks, cylinder heads and steering knuckles. DDM was run on Calma&#x27;s proprietary dual-monitor workstation hardware connected to Data General Nova and later Digital VAX 11/780-series computers. GM-CFD had DDM installations in Saginaw, MI, Pontiac, MI, Defiance, OH, Bedford, IN, Danville, IL and Massena, NY.

<text>John Christopher Wells (born 11 March 1939) is a British phonetician and Esperantist. Wells is a professor emeritus at University College London, where until his retirement in 2006 he held the departmental chair in phonetics. He is known for his work on the Esperanto language and his invention of the standard lexical sets and the X-SAMPA phonetic script system.

==Early life==
Wells was born on 11 March 1939 in Bootle, Lancashire.

Wells earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree at Trinity College, Cambridge, and his master&#x27;s degree and his PhD at the University of London.

==Career==
Wells is known for his book and cassette &quot;Accents of English&quot;, the book and CD &quot;The Sounds of the IPA&quot;, &quot;Lingvistikaj Aspektoj de Esperanto&quot;, and the &quot;Longman Pronunciation Dictionary&quot;. He is the author of the most widely used English-Esperanto dictionary.

Until his retirement, Wells directed a two-week summer course in phonetics for University College London, focusing on practical and theoretical phonetics, as well as aspects of teaching phonetics. The course ends with written and oral examinations, for which the &quot;IPA Certificate of Proficiency in the Phonetics of English&quot; is awarded.

From 2003 to 2007 he was president of the International Phonetic Association. He is also a member of the six-man Academic Advisory Committee at Linguaphone.

Wells has long been a pioneer of new technology. He is the inventor of the X-SAMPA ASCII phonetic alphabet for use in digital computers that could not handle IPA symbols. He learned HTML during the mid-1990s, and he created a Web page that compiled media references to Estuary English, although he was sceptical of the concept. After retirement, Wells ran a regular blog on phonetic topics from March 2006 to April 2013. He announced the end of his blog on 22 April 2013 saying, &quot;if I have nothing new to say, then the best plan is to stop talking.&quot;

===Work on accents of English===

A considerable part of Wells&#x27;s research focuses on the phonetic description of varieties of English. In 1982, Cambridge University Press published his three volumes of &quot;Accents of English&quot; that described accents all over the English-speaking world in phonetic terminology. This applied consistent terminology to accents that had previously been analysed in isolation. &quot;Accents of English&quot; defined the concept of &quot;lexical sets,&quot; a concept in wide usage. A lexical set is a set of words (named with a designated element) that share a special characteristic. For example, words belonging to lexical set BATH have the phoneme in the United States and phoneme in Received Pronunciation. In addition, Wells is acknowledged as the source of the term &quot;rhotic&quot; to describe accents where the letter r in spelling is always pronounced phonetically.

Before writing &quot;Accents of English&quot;, Wells had written a very critical review of the &quot;Linguistic Atlas of England&quot;, which was the principal output of the Survey of English Dialects. He argued that the methodology was outdated, that the sample was not representative of the population and that it was not possible to &quot;discover with any certainty the synchronic vowel-system in each of the localities investigated&quot;. KM Petyt noted in his review of &quot;Accents of English&quot; that Wells had made abundant use of the data from the Survey of English Dialects in some sections of the work whilst criticising the survey in other parts of the same work.

Wells was part of the committee of the Atlas Linguarum Europae for England and Wales, but never played a large role.

===&quot;Longman Pronunciation Dictionary&quot;===
Wells was appointed by Longman to write its pronunciation dictionary, the first edition of which was published in 1990. There had not been a pronunciation dictionary published in the United Kingdom since 1977, when Alfred C. Gimson published his last (the 14th) edition of &quot;English Pronouncing Dictionary&quot;. The book by Wells had a much greater scope, including American pronunciations as well as RP pronunciations and including non-RP pronunciations widespread in Great Britain (such as use of a short vowel in the words &quot;bath, chance, last&quot;, etc. and of a long vowel in &quot;book, look&quot;, etc.). His book also included transcriptions of foreign words in their native languages and local pronunciations of place names in the English-speaking world.

===Esperanto===

Wells was the president of the World Esperanto Association (UEA) from 1989 to 1995. He has also been the president of the Esperanto Academy (2007–2013) and the Esperanto Association of Britain (2011–2013).

===Work for spelling reform===
Wells was president of the Spelling Society, which advocates spelling reform, from 2003 to 2013. In 2008, he was criticised in a speech by then-Leader of the Opposition David Cameron, who referred to him only as &quot;President of the Spelling Society&quot;, for advocating tolerance of text spelling.

==Personal life==
His father was originally from South Africa, and his mother was English; he has two younger brothers. Wells grew up in Up Holland, Lancashire, born to the vicar of the parish, Philip Wells. He has commented on the accent of the area and how it contrasted with the Received Pronunciation that was spoken in his home in his book &quot;Accents of English; vol. 2: the British Isles&quot;.

He attended St John&#x27;s School, Leatherhead, studied languages and taught himself Gregg shorthand. Having learned Welsh, he was interviewed in Welsh on radio; according to his CV, he has a reasonable knowledge of ten languages. He was apparently approached by the Home Office to work on speaker identification but turned down the offer as it was still considered unacceptable to be gay at the time, and he feared that the security check would make his sexual orientation public. In September 2006 he signed a civil partnership with Gabriel Parsons, a native of Montserrat and his partner since 1968. Parsons died on 16 November 2023.

===Music===
Wells is a member of London Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus and was featured in their &quot;It Gets Better&quot; video. He is also a player of the melodeon and has uploaded videos of his playing to YouTube.

<doc id="868263" wikidata="Q1190979" url="?curid=868263" title="MythTV">
<text>MythTV is a free and open-source home entertainment application with a simplified &quot;10-foot user interface&quot; design for the living room TV. It turns a computer with the necessary hardware into a network streaming digital video recorder, a digital multimedia home entertainment system, or home theater personal computer. It can be considered a free and open-source alternative to TiVo or Windows Media Center. It runs on various operating systems, primarily Linux, macOS, and FreeBSD.

==History==
The MythTV project was started in April 2002 by Isaac Richards, who explained his motivation:

==Features==
* Pause, skip, and rewind live TV shows
* Completely automatic commercial detection and optional skipping
* Intelligently schedules recordings to avoid conflicts
* Interfaces with television listing sources such as XMLTV or PSIP
* Interfaces with nonprofit subscription listings service Schedules Direct in the United States and Canada. Schedules Direct delivers the same Tribune Media Services listings data that TiVo and other video recorders use.
* Supports ATSC, QAM, DMB-T/H and DVB (everything supported by LinuxTV) high-definition television
* Supports Xv, OpenGL, and VDPAU video output
* Supports H.264 codec
* Supports VP9 and H.265 codecs as of version 0.28
* A backend server and frontend client architecture, allowing multiple frontend client machines to be remotely served content from one or more backend servers. A single computer can perform as both the frontend client and the backend server.
* Plays recordings at an accelerated or decelerated rate, adjusting the audio pitch as necessary
* Schedule and administer various system functions using a web browser-based interface
* Controls a set-top box using an infrared remote (IR blaster), or Firewire

===HDTV support===
MythTV is capable of capturing HDTV streams from any source that will provide unencrypted video. This means broadcast ATSC and DVB content, as well as encrypted DVB content when using a tuner with an integrated CI module. Most U.S. cable and satellite providers use encrypted video only accessible through their own set-top boxes. Cable systems may provide some unencrypted QAM channels, but these will generally only be local broadcast stations, and not cable programming or premium channels.

OpenCable devices are available to access encrypted content on U.S. cable systems, but as this is a full DRM system, and not just CA like DVB CI, every piece of hardware and software on the playback chain must be tested and licensed by CableLabs. At current, Windows Media Center is the only DVR software to meet these requirements, and only it, and other software using its recording libraries, can use these devices. In 2010, CableLabs relaxed the DRM restrictions allowing unlicensed devices to record &quot;copy freely&quot; content using these devices, however it is still entirely up to cable operators what content they provide flagged as such.

As an alternative to direct digital capture, one can use an external decoder to receive the channels, and then capture using digital-analog-digital conversion (the analog hole). A popular means of doing this conversion is to connect the component outputs of a set-top box to the Hauppauge HD PVR.

===Modules===
MythTV&#x27;s add-on modules (plugins) include:
* MythVideo plays various video file formats
* MythMusic a music player, jukebox, collection manager, and CD ripper
* MythGallery online photo gallery manager
* MythNews RSS feed news reader
* MythWeather fetches weather forecasts – including weather radar – from the Internet
* MythBrowser small web browser
* MythGame frontend for game console emulators
* MythWeb controls MythTV from a remote web browser
* MythArchive DVD burner
* MythNetvision streaming video player intended primarily for Flash-websites like YouTube
* MythZoneMinder frontend interface for a ZoneMinder system
* UPnP AV MediaServer v1.0 compliant server: share media files with UPnP-clients

The base system integrates with its modules. A system can be controlled with an infrared remote control using LIRC, or radio remote control using kernel modules.

==Operating systems==
MythTV is available for many operating systems based on Linux or Unix, including Mac OS. The MythTV website distributes only source code, which must be compiled for the desired system; executable programs can be downloaded from various third-party sources. The software runs on and is officially supported by Microsoft Windows, but no official executable version was available; there are detailed instructions for compiling for Windows. All core frontend features work under Windows, including LiveTV, scheduling, and watching recordings, but most plugins do not work without additional patches.

===Bundles===
Notable projects that include a Linux distribution bundled with MythTV (and associated libraries) are:
* FreeBSD has several ports to support MythTV
* LinHES is a bootCD derivative of Arch Linux. Its MythTV frontend can be run from the CD. An entire installation to the hard disk can be made in minutes.
* LinuxMCE bundles MythTV with Kubuntu as the Linux distro, along with the Pluto Home automation suite.
* Mythbuntu combines Ubuntu distributions with MythTV. The Ubuntu community has built extensive resources for installing, configuring and troubleshooting MythTV. It was discontinued in 2016.
* Ubuntu TV integrates MythTV into a television-ready interface (based on the Ubuntu Unity user interface).
* Xebian is a distribution of Debian Linux for the Microsoft Xbox game console and includes MythTV.

<doc id="868269" wikidata="Q334210" url="?curid=868269" title="Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher">
<text>Reginald Baliol Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher, (30 June 1852 – 22 January 1930) was a British historian and Liberal Party politician, although his greatest influence over military and foreign affairs was as a courtier, member of public committees and behind-the-scenes &quot;fixer&quot;, or rather éminence grise. Behind the scenes, he influenced many pre-First World War military reforms and was a supporter of the British–French &quot;Entente Cordiale&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Reginald Baliol Brett, known to his family as Regy, was born on 30 June 1852 in London. His father, William Baliol Brett, 1st Viscount Esher, was a distinguished barrister who later gained prominence as a Member of Parliament for his dutiful support of Benjamin Disraeli during the 1867 Reform Act debate. He was Solicitor General in Disraeli&#x27;s first ministry in 1868, and later a judge on the Court of Common Pleas, Lord Justice of Appeal and Master of the Rolls. In 1885, he was raised to the peerage as Baron Esher by Prime Minister Lord Salisbury. On his retirement as Master of the Rolls in 1897, he was created first Viscount Esher. Reginald&#x27;s mother, Eugénie Mayer (1814–1904), was the French stepdaughter of Colonel John Gurwood, the editor of Wellington&#x27;s dispatches who killed himself in 1845.

The young Brett&#x27;s childhood was spent between London and Heath Farm, the family&#x27;s modest country house near Watford, with occasional visits to his mother&#x27;s family in Paris and to Lowther Castle in Westmorland, the home of his father&#x27;s friend, William Lowther, 2nd Earl of Lonsdale. 

He first attended Cheam School, where he was tutored by Arthur Campbell Ainger to prepare him for Eton College. He entered Eton in January 1865, where he was taught by influential master William Johnson. The exact nature of Brett&#x27;s relationship with Johnson, a proponent of the ancient Greek practice of ephebophilia who was forced to resign from Eton in 1872 over an indiscreet letter to a young pupil, has long been a source of speculation. At the very least, Johnson was an eager observer and catalyst of homosexual relationships among his pupils, including Brett, who began romances with Charles D. R. Williamson and Francis Elliot. Johnson recounted these observations in his letters to Brett and others.

He began studies at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1870. At Cambridge, Brett was profoundly influenced by the radical lawyer, politician and professor of international law William Harcourt and Harcourt&#x27;s advisor Lady Ripon, a wealthy Christian Socialist and radical. Through the Ripons and Harcourt, Brett came to reject his father&#x27;s Toryism and adopt the Whig principles that would lead him to join the Liberal Party.

When Disraeli unsuccessfully tried to enforce Anglicanism in the Public Worship Bill, Brett wrote copious letters to the Marquess of Hartington, leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons, and Harcourt was pushed into the limelight as a leading Liberal in the Commons.

Having been a Conservative as a young man, Brett began his political career in 1880 as Liberal Member of Parliament for Penryn and Falmouth and associate of Lord Hartington. However, the resolution of the Great Eastern Crisis and success of the 187880 Midlothian Campaign had re-energized William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s authority as rightful leader of the Liberals, marginalising Hartington and Brett as jingoes. Brett remained loyal to Hartington, serving as his parliamentary private secretary during Hartington&#x27;s term as Secretary of State for War (1882–85) and once drove him to a Cabinet meeting on a sleigh through the snow. When Hartington broke with the Liberals to form the Liberal Unionist Party, Brett became the mediator between the factions and was a leading figure at the Liberal Round Table Conference of 1887. After losing an election at Plymouth in 1885, Brett elected to withdraw from public politics in favour of a behind the scenes role.

He was instrumental in the Jameson raid of 1895, vigorously defending Cecil Rhodes. During the Boer War, Esher intervened in the row between Lord Lansdowne and General Garnet Wolseley, the Commander-in-Chief, who tended to blame Lansdowne for military failures. Esher&#x27;s memoranda on the conflict became established civil service procedure.

== Courtier and military reforms ==
In 1895, Brett became Permanent Secretary to the Office of Works, where Edward, Prince of Wales, was impressed by his zeal and dedication to the elderly Queen Victoria. In Kensington Palace, Esher would push the Queen in a wheel chair so she could revisit her childhood. Upon his father&#x27;s death on 24 May 1899, he succeeded him as 2nd Viscount Esher. In 1901, Lord Esher was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Berkshire and became Deputy Governor and Constable of Windsor Castle; he lived at Orchard Lea, Winkfield, on the edge of the Great Park. After Edward&#x27;s coronation in 1902, he gained greater royal influence and shunned political office; by the end of 1903, he met or corresponded with Edward VII daily and meeting with the King&#x27;s adviser Lord Knollys three to four times daily. During this period, he helped edit Queen Victoria&#x27;s papers, publishing &quot;Correspondence of Queen Victoria&quot; in 1907.

=== Esher Report and military influence ===
From 1903, Esher was a member of Lord Elgin&#x27;s South African War Commission, which investigated the British Army&#x27;s near-failure in the Boer War. In that role, he informed the King of the views of the Commission, party leaders, and War Office civil servants with whom he was still in touch from his days working for Hartington. Secretary of State for War St John Brodrick was resentful of Esher&#x27;s influence, which paralysed Brodrick&#x27;s scope for operation, and the government was much weakened in October 1903, when Joseph Chamberlain and Hartington resigned over the former&#x27;s plans for Tariff Reform.

In 1903, Esher was appointed to chair the Report of the War Office (Reconstitution) Committee, a sub-committee of the Elgin Commission which became known as the Esher Committee. The sub-committee consisted of Esher, Admiral Sir John Fisher, and Colonel Sir George Clarke. To advance the King&#x27;s desired reforms of the Army, Esher formed an uneasy alliance with Clarke to directly undermine Secretary of State for War H. O. Arnold-Forster, an opponent of reform. On 7 December, Arnold-Foster advised the militia must be absorbed into the Army to save £2,000,000. Encouraged by the King, Esher wanted prime minister Arthur Balfour to look to party first, while at the same time warning the King&#x27;s Secretary that, &quot;the Prime Minister will have to take matters into his own hands&quot;. Esher&#x27;s role, playing both Crown and Parliament against each other by confidential memoranda was kept secret for sixty-seven years. It was decided on 19 December a Reserve Force should be set up &quot;in commission&quot;. On 12 January, Esher told the minister to accept his sub-committee&#x27;s recommendation, even though Arnold-Foster had not even been told of the agenda. Despite the intrigues, the King approved of the committee&#x27;s work. The sub-committee produced the Esher Report in February and March 1904, recommending radical reform of the British Army, including the establishment of the Army Council and the Committee of Imperial Defence, a permanent secretariat. The King successfully urged adoption of its recommended reforms by Balfour.

Esher cultivated a friendship with Colonel Sir Edmund Ward, secretary to the Army Council, in order to control minute-taking, the Council agenda, and quorum at meetings. In 1904, Esher told Ward he had &quot;proof of the Army Order&quot; and a plan toward Army decentralisation, called &quot;Traverse&quot;. Believing the royal prerogative had been circumvented &quot;without reference to the Sovereign&quot;, Esher marched into Arnold-Foster&#x27;s office to remind him that precedent under Victoria had been to yield to arguments from the monarch, which had already been put forward by the Adjutant-General.

After 1904, all War Office appointments were approved and often suggested by Esher. He approved the establishment of the Territorial Force, although he saw it as a step toward conscription, a step not taken. Many of Esher&#x27;s recommendations were implemented between 1905 and 1918 under Secretary of State for War Richard Haldane, assisted by Esher&#x27;s protégé, the young Major-General Douglas Haig. Haldane&#x27;s initial Liberal reforms were thrown out by the House of Lords, and the resulting documents more closely resembled Esher&#x27;s original efforts. Esher&#x27;s biographer Peter Fraser thus argued &quot;the Haldane reforms owed little to Haldane.&quot; Although Edward VII urged Esher&#x27;s appointment as Secretary of State for War, he declined it, along with many other public offices, including the Viceroyalty of India.

In 1909, Esher was appointed a Deputy Lieutenant of the County of London and the King&#x27;s Aide-de-Camp. He gained a reputation as a disciple of national efficiency, an able administrator, and a silky, smooth influence as a courtier. He was accused of being an arch-insider, undemocratic and interfering. However, the King favoured Esher, and his influence over the Army grew, with a focus on to averting conflict in Europe. Despite his close political connections, including included Lord Tweedmouth and Lord Rosebery, his undemocratic reputation and ties to the monarch prevented further political ambition or any high cabinet office. He founded the Society of Islanders, established on the principle of &quot;two for one Keels&quot;, an expression of British naval supremacy in order to maintain global peace.

Esher&#x27;s involvements in the Territorials were not limited to the War Office. He was the first chairman appointed in 1908 to the County of London Territorial Forces Association and its president from 1912 to his death, in addition he was appointed Honorary Colonel of the 5th (Reserve) Battalion of the Royal Fusiliers in 1908 and held the same appointment with the 6th County of London Brigade, Royal Field Artillery, from 1910 to 1921.

In 1911, Esher helped ease out Lord Knollys, who was then seventy-five years old and a member of the Royal Household since 1862, but who had lost royal confidence over his negotiation of the Parliament Act 1911. Esher arranged Lord Stamfordham as his replacement.

Together with Lewis Harcourt, he established the London Museum, which opened its doors on 5 March 1912. 

===Great War===
After the outbreak of the First World War, Esher served as an emissary to France and often travelled to France as a respite from the &quot;mephitic&quot; atmosphere of the War Office. In one writer&#x27;s description, Esher served as &quot;de facto&quot; head of British Intelligence in France, reporting on the French domestic and political situation, although he told his son he preferred not to have a formal position where he would have to take orders. His son Maurice set up a bureau in Paris called &quot;Intelligence Anglaise,&quot; keeping his father informed through a small spy network with links to newspaper journalists.

He visited Prime Minister of France Aristide Briand in Paris in January 1915, and Briand told him that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George, had &quot;a longer view than any of our leaders&quot; and that an earlier opening of the Salonica front might have prevented the entry of Bulgaria into the war. Following the Russian defeats on the Eastern Front, H. H. Asquith&#x27;s neutrality over Briand&#x27;s Salonica Plan perplexed Esher, and he perceived the balance of power in cabinet shifting toward a more conservative coalition. He also made contact in Paris with Maurice Bunau-Varilla, owner and editor of &quot;Le Matin&quot;, with the intent of influencing the Russian Empire to remain in the Allied Forces and the United States to join. 

By 1916, however, the French war effort was almost spent, and Esher reported that Finance Minister Alexandre Ribot sought to sue for peace. At the Chantilly Conference, they discussed combined operations to maintain the momentum. Esher accompanied Haig to the Amiens Conference, but on his return to Paris, was informed of the sinking of the HMS &quot;Hampshire&quot; and death of Earl Kitchener. Returning to London, Esher spoke with Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes. The following month at the Beaugency Conference, they discussed the Somme Offensive. Esher told Maurice Hankey, &quot;For heaven&#x27;s sake put every ounce you have got of will power into this offensive.&quot; He also learnt firsthand the French government&#x27;s scheme for a &quot;Greater Syria&quot; to include British controlled Palestine.

In 1917, he told Lloyd George, now Prime Minister, that diplomacy in Paris was weak and that Lloyd George &quot;was badly served&quot;. Ambassador Lord Bertie was the last of the Victorian imperial envoys and Esher argued he had failed to do enough to persuade France to remain in the war. When offered the ambassadorship himself, Esher crowed, &quot;I cannot imagine anything I would detest more.&quot; Following a French mutiny the next month, Haig and Henry Wilson lent support to an offensive to bolster the French. Phillipe Petain, the new French commander-in-chief, was deemed too defensive, and Esher sent Colonel Charles à Court Repington on a &quot;charm offensive&quot;. With support from Munitions Minister Winston Churchill and Lord Milner for dramatic action, Esher entered diplomatic conversation with the War Policy Committee, a unique departure in the management of British policy. However, bad weather and sickness of war made Esher ill in 1917, and he was encouraged by the King to holiday at Biarritz.

Partly on Esher&#x27;s advice, the War Office undertook major re-organization in 1917, unifying all British military commands at the Imperial War Office. Esher was at the famous Crillon Club dinner meeting in Paris on 1 December 1917, at which with Clemenceau, they took critical decisions over the strategy for 1918. The Allied Governments proposed a unified Allied Reserve, despite negative press and publicity in the Commons. As cabinet enforcer, Esher visited Henry Wilson on 9 February 1918, during the crisis over his succession to William Robertson as Chief of the Imperial General Staff. Esher became instrumental in remonstrating against the war effort with loose press articles in Lord Northcliffe&#x27;s newspapers and &quot;The Morning Post&quot;. In France, Esher established a &quot;rapprochement&quot; with the press to help hold the Poincare-Clemenceau government together, at a time when England was at the zenith of her military strength.

As the war concluded, Esher learned that the King wanted his resignation as Deputy-Governor of Windsor. In fact, he coveted the post of Keeper of the Royal Archives. Lord Stamfordham demanded his resignation in favour of historian Sir John Fortescue, but Esher remained as Governor. Professionalization also warned Maurice Hankey against becoming secretary to the Paris Peace Conference, which to Esher&#x27;s mind was beyond his competence. Esher also persuaded his friend not to desert the British Empire for the League of Nations. Domestic unrest and trade unionism, which Esher loathed, as it threatened peace and stability, also destabilized his position as President of the Army of India Committee. Ever skeptical of political changes, &quot;omnivorous&quot; introductions to the Viceroy&#x27;s work forced him to decline a solicitous offer to chair a sub-committee of the Conditions of the Poor.

===Post-war work===
Esher was admitted to the Privy Council in 1922. In 1928 he became Constable and Governor of Windsor Castle, an office he had always wanted, holding it until his death in 1930.

Lord Esher was also a historian; besides the aforementioned work, he also published works on King Edward VII and Lord Kitchener. In February 1920, he proofread Haig&#x27;s &quot;History of the General Head Quarters 1917–1918&quot;. That summer, Esher&#x27;s critique of a &quot;Life of Disraeli&quot; appeared in &quot;Quarterly Review&quot;. His memoir, &quot;Cloud-capp&#x27;d Towers&quot;, was published in 1927. After his death, his sons published four volumes of his &quot;Journals and Letters&quot; (1934–1938).

==Honours and arms==

==Personal life==

=== Family ===
In 1879, Reginald Brett married Eleanor Van de Weyer, daughter of Belgian ambassador Sylvain Van de Weyer and granddaughter of Anglo-American financier Joshua Bates. They had four children.
* Their elder son, Oliver Sylvain Baliol Brett became 3rd Viscount Esher and was a Fellow of the Royal Institute of British Architects. He married Antoinette Heckscher, daughter of August Heckscher.
* Their second son, Maurice Vyner Baliol Brett, married the famous musical theatre actress Zena Dare.
* Their older daughter, Dorothy, was a painter and member of the Bloomsbury Group. She studied at the Slade School of Fine Arts and spent years in New Mexico.
* Their younger daughter, Sylvia, became the last Ranee of Sarawak on 24 May 1917, following the proclamation of her husband Charles Vyner Brooke as Rajah.
Esher found his son, Oliver, a job as an additional secretary to John Morley and he was on good terms with Captain Sinclair, Campbell-Bannerman&#x27;s secretary.

=== Sexuality ===
Although married with children, Lord Esher had homosexual inclinations. His flirtations with young men were regarded with tolerant amusement in polite society, and the years before his marriage were marked by a series of what Esher described as &quot;rapturous&quot; love affairs with various young men, beginning with his time at Eton. His marriage in no way stopped or curtailed these activities, and he told a friend he could not remember a single day when he was not in love with one young man or another. He later anonymously published a book of verse called &quot;Foam&quot;, in which he glorified &quot;golden lads&quot;. According to his biographer James Lees-Milne, Esher &quot;never deliberately concealed his infatuations&quot; but explicitly confided them to only a few, including Esher&#x27;s son Maurice, to whom Maurice wrote prurient and even romantic letters during the boy&#x27;s time at Eton.

One of Esher&#x27;s most significant male companions was his private secretary Lawrence Burgis, who met Esher when he was attending King&#x27;s School, Worcester. Although Burgis&#x27;s was heterosexual and the relationship likely was not physically unconsummated, they remained closely acquainted until Esher&#x27;s death in 1930. After British entry into World War I, Esher personally intervened to have Burgis appointed as an aide-de-camp to the British Expeditionary Force Commander of Intelligence John Charteris so that he could avoid front-line service on the Western Front. Esher also had Burgis appointed as a secretary to the Cabinet Office, and Burgis later used this position to keep verbatim records of Prime Minister Winston Churchill&#x27;s War Cabinet meetings in defiance of the Official Secrets Act 1911, providing one of the most important records of World War II.

<text>Structures from Silence is the third studio album by American ambient musician Steve Roach. It was released on July 15, 1984 by Fortuna.

==Recording==
The title track, &quot;Structures from Silence&quot;, took Steve Roach a few months to compose. He would play the song using an Oberheim OB-8 and Oberheim DSX sequencer day and night, adjusting it until it sounded right to him. Finally, he went to a recording studio and recorded the song in a single 30-minute long pass, using his own gear along with a second OB-8 as well as a Lexicon 224 digital reverberator.

==Release==
A remastered version of this album, with a different cover, was released in 2001 by Projekt.

A 30-year anniversary edition was released by Projekt in 2014. The album was remastered in 24-bit/96 kHz from the original analog mixes. There is both a single-CD edition, and a 3-CD deluxe edition that includes two bonus discs created in 2013. Both editions use the original cover art. The remastered original album (but not the two bonus discs) was made available as 24-bit/96 kHz digital downloads.

===Video release===
In 1987 a VHS video titled &quot;Structures from Silence&quot; was released. It featured imagery created by Marianne Dolan set to the album&#x27;s title track. This video was also released on laserdisc under the title &quot;Space Dreaming&quot;.

==Reception==

In late November 2014, Steve Roach was selected as Echoes Radio&#x27;s #1 Artist and &quot;Structures from Silence&quot; was voted as the #2 album.

&quot;Fact&quot; listed &quot;Structures from Silence&quot; as the tenth best album of the 1980s, calling it a &quot;thoughtful, slow-paced study in synthesizer&quot; and one of the most important ambient albums of all time. They listed the 2014 reissue as the fourth best reissue that year, commenting that &quot;it&#x27;s a perfect time to return to this classic album – still spellbinding, three decades on.&quot; In 2016, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; listed it as the 33rd best ambient album of all time.

<doc id="868274" wikidata="Q911037" url="?curid=868274" title="Teraina">
<text>Teraina (written also Teeraina, also known as Washington Island – these two names are constitutional) is a coral atoll in the central Pacific Ocean and part of the Northern Line Islands which belong to Kiribati. Obsolete names of Teraina are New Marquesas, Prospect Island, and New York Island. The island is located approximately 4.71° North latitude and 160.76° West longitude. Teraina differs from most other atolls in the world in that it has a large freshwater lake (Washington Lake), an open lens, concealed within its luxuriant coconut palm forest; this is the only permanent freshwater lake in the whole of Kiribati.

Measuring about NW-SE and SW-NE, it has a land area of about ; its circumference is about . The island is generally low-lying, with a maximum elevation ASL of about , while most of the island rises some high; trees in the dense inland forest grow to several times this height however. At the western end of the island is the capital, Tangkore (or Tengkore). There are (as at the 2020 Census) about 1,893 inhabitants, making it the least-populated of the permanently inhabited Northern Line Islands. However, population density (177 per km2) is three times as high as on Tabuaeran and vastly more than on the much larger (300-plus km2) Kiritimati with its about 15 people/km2.

There are two dirt roads around the island&#x27;s perimeter – an outer (Beach Road) and an inner one (Ring Road). Transport inland is done by boat on artificial canals, rather uniquely for a Pacific island. A navigation light tower and two radio masts stand near Tangkore. What cannot be produced locally is shipped in about twice a year; there is also some minor inter-island traffic by ship or boat. The old landing was at the western tip, but this was dangerous due to being exposed to surf breaking on the reef flats; it has been more recently replaced by a new and more easily accessible landing south of Tangkore, where the canal system feeds into the ocean. A rough airstrip of some length exists near Kaaitara. It may become temporarily unusable after heavy rains.

== History ==

Permanent early human occupation of Teraina is disputed. Although there were no occupants on the island at the time of European discovery, a number of human made sites have been identified on the island including dry stacked stone architecture. Additionally, ethnographic data from the Cook Islands and the Tuamotu Islands points to Polynesian knowledge of the island. Perhaps the most compelling discovery on Teraina is the recovery of an intact voyaging canoe. Although archaeological sites are known to exist on the island, the general lack of fresh water makes long-term human habitation unlikely though more work is needed in establishing the timeline of human use.

Teraina was sighted on 12 June 1798 by the American whaling captain Edmund Fanning of &quot;Betsy&quot;; he named the island for George Washington but did not attempt to land. The first exploration of the island arrived later with captain Adam Johann von Krusenstern, on a Russian expedition (called then New Marquesas). The island was subsequently claimed under the Guano Islands Act of 1856 for the United States under the name &quot;Prospect Island&quot;. Guano was never mined or exported to any notable extent, however; the humid climate prevents the formation of substantial deposits. It was occupied by Captain John English and people from Manihiki in about 1860.

Later William Greig who began planting the island with coconut trees. Eventually the sons of Greig owned the plantation with Father until he sold his interest to the Fanning Island Limited, and started a coconut plantation on Christmas Island.

Fanning Island was annexed by the British by Commander Nichols of on May 29, 1889. It became a part of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony in 1916. The name of the island was changed to Teraina in 1979 when Kiribati gained independence. The major export of Teraina is copra, the dried meat of the coconut.

The Burns Philip Copra Company operated plantations on the island after the Second World War. At various times, contract laborers were brought from Manihiki, Tahiti, and the Gilbert Islands to work the coconut plantations. More recently, settlement from Gilbert group has been encouraged during the re-settlement schemes of 1989–1995.

Washington Island Post Office opened on 1 February 1921, closed around 1923, reopened in 1924, closed in 1948 and reopened again around August 1979.

== Political geography ==
The population of Teraina lives in nine villages. It is increasing; from 416 in 1978, it had risen to 936 in 1990 and had exceeded 1,000 by 2000. The population of Teraina in the 2010 census was 1,690. Compared to the 2005 population of 1,155 and the 2000 population of 1,087, the population is growing very rapidly. The population of Teraina grew by 535 people between 2005 and 2010, an annual population growth of 7.9%.

All villages are listed in the following table, with the preliminary census results of 2005, counterclockwise around the perimeter of the atoll, starting in the northeast with Abaiang and ending in the southeast with Onauea. Tangkore is near the westernmost point of Teraina:

Teraina has an unusual age structure; nearly half the population (44%) is aged under 15 and one in five people (19%) are children under five years. There are more males than females in almost all age groups except the elderly.

== Physical geography ==

As regards its physical characteristics, this is one of the most interesting islands in the Pacific. It is a raised coral atoll, but it has not filled up with sand and soil, yet still retains a significant remnant of the former lagoon. The lake, however, is only just barely perceptibly brackish, as its only significant source is the plentiful rain. The lake is only a few feet (around 1–2 meters) deep for the most part, though the supposed maximum depth is nearly . Being only about away from the equator, Teeraina is inside the ITCZ; its climate is thus extremely humid, making it one of the &quot;wet&quot; Pacific islands.

The western inland is made up by peat bog, which is still flooded after heavy rains, and constitutes infilled former lakebed. It is not clear in what way the western lake or lakes – there are now 2 main areas of bogland, which may correspond to former lake basins – were connected to the remaining waterbody. One bog is immediately adjacent to the lake&#x27;s western end, the other is halfway between that and the island&#x27;s northwest tip. Canals have been cut into the bogs, for punting, rowing and motor boats transporting people and produce. There is some removal of peat and sediments to stem the lake&#x27;s ongoing infilling; in addition it seems that in recent times, the lake&#x27;s level is slowly rising again so that the eastern bog&#x27;s area has receded somewhat. The peat reaches thicknesses of about , much of which is located above sea level.

It is also not precisely known where the last connection of the inland waters to the ocean were, and when they closed. The southeast end is more likely however, as the island is in the Equatorial Counter Current which runs west to east, and drifting coral and other reef-builder larvae as well as flotsam would therefore predominantly land at the island&#x27;s western side. Thus, it is to be expected that land builds up faster there. This also agrees with the eastern location of the remaining lake. In any case, the canal network now opens to the sea south of Tangkore, and there is a direct connection from the lake to the ocean at Teraina&#x27;s eastern tip.

== Ecology ==
Ecologically, Teraina is also highly interesting, for several reasons. Firstly, as is readily apparent from its peculiar geographical and geological features, it possesses a combination of ecosystems that is quite unique in the entire world. Secondly, it holds the world&#x27;s largest population of a rare bird species though it is over from that bird&#x27;s original home. Furthermore, it was until fairly recently home to some enigmatic dabbling ducks which are now extinct. Last, the island&#x27;s biodiversity seems to prove quite conclusively that, probably by about 1200 AD or so, the island was temporarily inhabited by a significant number of humans.

At present, there is no formal protection for the islands&#x27; ecosystems or species, but it has been suggested to legally protect key habitat, namely the boglands. Though it is globally endangered, the Rimatara lorikeet (&quot;Vini kuhlii&quot;) does not appear to be in need of formal protection; it actually benefits from human land use change and the feral cats. The former provides the birds with more habitat, while the cats have so far managed to keep Teraina completely free of black rats (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;) which due to their tree-climbing habits would seriously jeopardize the species&#x27; existence, should they become established in numbers. Given the negative experience e.g. from Rennell Island, maintenance of a vigorous tilapia fishery would seem to be advisable. These fish certainly represent a valuable source of protein on Teraina, and in fact were originally introduced for that purpose.

=== Flora ===
Over 30 species of flowering plants are known from the island, but most seem to be not originally native. &quot;Cocos nucifera&quot;, the coconut palm, is the most conspicuous tree on Teraina. It is found planted, but also constitutes one of the dominant forest trees. The palms occur in wet forest around the bogs, mixed with &quot;Pandanus&quot; (screwpine), and an undergrowth dominated by the ferns &quot;Asplenium pacificum&quot; and &quot;Phymatosorus scolopendria&quot;. In more elevated places near the beach, &quot;Pisonia&quot; (catchbird tree) atoll forest is found, though Teraina has not that much of this ubiquitous Pacific ecosystem for its size.

The most conspicuous plants of the boglands are the arum &quot;Cyrtosperma merkusii&quot; and the giant bulrush (&quot;Schoenoplectus californicus&quot;).

Among the local crops, sugar-apple (&quot;Annona squamosa&quot;), breadfruit (&quot;Artocarpus altilis&quot;), papaya (&quot;Carica papaya&quot;), bananas (&quot;Musa&quot; cultivars, including Fe&#x27;i bananas) and apple guava (&quot;Psidium guajava&quot;) are the most significant, apart from the coconuts. Frangipani (&quot;Plumeria&quot;) and hibiscus are popular as ornamental plants.

=== Birds ===

Though numerous seabirds nest on Teraina, for many such species the limited habitat makes it a less important rookery than other, similar-sized raised atolls. About 10 species of seabirds breed here, most significantly tree-nesters like the little white tern (&quot;Gygis microrhyncha&quot;) and the red-footed booby (&quot;Sula sula&quot;). The eastern reef egret (&quot;Egretta sacra&quot;), widespread throughout the region, can also be found on Teraina.

Among migratory birds, the ruddy turnstone (&quot;Arenaria interpres&quot;), sanderling (&quot;Calidris alba&quot;), bristle-thighed curlew (&quot;Numenius tahitiensis&quot;), Pacific golden plover (&quot;Pluvialis fulva&quot;), and grey-tailed (&quot;Tringa brevipes&quot;) and wandering tattlers (&quot;T. incana&quot;) use Teraina as stopover location or winter quarters on a regular basis. Other shorebirds, gulls, and occasionally ducks of North American and East Asian species may occur as vagrants.

In historic times, two species of landbirds and one subspecies of duck have been recorded. The latter, Coues&#x27;s gadwall (&quot;Anas strepera couesi&quot;), was the only distinct subspecies of the widespread gadwall. It is surrounded by considerable mystery, mainly as regards the origin of the population, the age and therefore validity of the subspecies (it is sometimes disputed to be significantly distinct), and the causes and date of its disappearance. Only two specimens are known – a couple that is not fully mature, and therefore only limited information can be gleaned from it. What is certain is that there was a duck population of some size in the mid-1870s, while in 1900 all were gone.

The bokikokiko (&quot;Acrocephalus aequinoctialis&quot;) is Kiribati&#x27;s endemic reed-warbler. This small greyish passerine is well-known, due to its bold and inquisitive habits, and its song, a series of alternating higher and lower squeaks after which it is named.

The Rimitara lorikeet (&quot;Vini kuhlii&quot;) is present with about 1,000 birds. It is a tiny parrot with brilliant plumage and an endearing and highly social behavior, owing to which they were known to late 19th century settlers as &quot;love-birds&quot;. This species was originally native to the Austral and Cook Islands in SE Polynesia, a long distance to the south. They were treasured by the natives of the Society Islands and were an item of high value in inter-island trade; these birds were kept as pets, and in addition their feathers were used in crafts and art. In any case, there is considerable evidence from Ancient Hawaiʻi that Polynesian seafarers travelled between southeastern Polynesia and Hawaiʻi with some regularity, perhaps as early as 400 AD, but certainly by about 1200 AD. Since it is almost inconceivable – given the prevailing winds, ocean currents, known trade routes, and the difficulty with which these birds can be kept alive during voyages – that &quot;Vini kuhlii&quot; was transported from the Austral or Cook Islands to the Gilbert Islands and from there to Teraina, the presence of the birds there is best explained by them having been introduced by SE Polynesian travelers. Today, the species is extinct on many islands on which it formerly occurred, while the Teraina population, considered crucially important for its survival, contains some 60% of the remaining global wild population. Ironically, the reason for the Rimitara lorikeet thriving on Teraina is the replacement of native forest with coconut plantations; these birds feed mainly on the nectar of coconut palm flowers and nest in old coconut shells or husks.

As it thus seems clear that there was prehistoric human activity of some degree on Teraina, it is also likely that birds became extinct consequently, like on all such Outer Pacific islands for which research has been conducted. David Steadman in his comprehensive review lists several such hypothetical taxa for Kiribati as a whole. For Teraina specifically, considering the habitat and what birds still exist, one or more rails (&quot;Gallirallus&quot; and/or &quot;Porzana&quot;), an imperial-pigeon (&quot;Ducula&quot;), and maybe a &quot;Todiramphus&quot; kingfisher or an &quot;Aplonis&quot; starling make the most likely candidates for birds gone extinct prehistorically. It must be considered, however, that given the lack of fieldwork it is not quite clear what effect changing sea levels would have had on Teraina. If the sea level were only half a meter (c. 2 ft) higher it is certainly possible that the forest and freshwater lake would be replaced by shrubland or dunes and a brackish lagoon. That notwithstanding, it is well possible that a Polynesian sandpiper related to or identical with the Christmas sandpiper from Kiritimati once lived on Teraina.

=== Other fauna ===
As with most outer Pacific islands, there are no native land mammals.

Polynesian rats (&quot;Rattus exulans&quot;) are present on Teraina, apparently since prehistoric times. They may have arrived with flotsam after storms further west, or accidentally or deliberately (as food) been introduced by prehistoric seafarers. Their present-day impact on the bird population is minor, but if rails were once present on Teraina, the rats had probably some role in these birds&#x27; disappearance, and maybe in that of any other birds gone extinct in prehistoric times too. If a Polynesian sandpiper once bred on Teraina, it is almost certainly those rats that are responsible for these birds&#x27; disappearance; only a single taxon of &quot;Prosobonia&quot; remains today, precariously holding its own on atolls that are devoid of any rat species.
Feral dogs, cats and pigs occur in varying numbers on Teraina; the cats especially are responsible for some decline in the number of ground-nesting seabirds. On the other hand, as noted above, the cats have thus far kept the rat population at bay.

Lacustrine species reported from Teraina include fish. and some unspecified &quot;shrimp&quot;, i.e. (in all probability) a member of the Crustacea. Teraina&#x27;s freshwater fish include the marbled eel (&quot;Anguilla marmorata&quot;), a &quot;Caranx&quot; freshwater trevally, and &quot;Oreochromis&quot; tilapias and the milkfish (&quot;Chanos chanos&quot;). The latter two, and perhaps also the trevally, were introduced in recent times. The eels were already established by 1877; like many Anguillidae they are catadromous and able to migrate some distance on dry land. Thus it may be presumed that the lake is continuously being restocked from the Pacific, though apparently no actual field data exists on the habits of the eels of Teraina.

As on many Indopacific islands rich in coconut (&quot;Cocos nucifera&quot;) trees, the coconut crab (&quot;Birgus latro&quot;) is often encountered on Teraina.

A few green turtles (&quot;Chelonia mydas&quot;) nest on the beaches. It is not a very important nesting site however and the clutches have a rather low probability of success, as Teraina is one of the Kiribati islands where turtle egg collecting is permitted.

<text>Thomas Aufield (1552 – 6 July 1585), also called Thomas Alfield, was an English Roman Catholic martyr.

He was born in Gloucestershire and educated at Eton College and King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. He then converted to Roman Catholicism and in September 1576 went to the English College at Douai, France, but suspecting danger returned to England in November.

In September 1580 Aufield returned to the English College, by then at Rheims. He was ordained a priest on 4 March 1581 at Châlons-sur-Marne and later that month set out for the English Mission. He seems to have mostly operated in the North, where he was arrested on 2 May 1582. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London, where he apostatized under torture, returning to Protestantism. Released on bond, he then returned to Gloucester.

By the following April he was again at Rheims, and having returned to Catholicism around the beginning of Michaelmas term visited his brother-in-law in Aldersgate Street, London. Around this time he was approached by Captain John Davis requesting an introduction to William Allen. Davis proposed that the ships he had been given by the government for piracy against Spain be crewed by Catholics to serve the Pope or the King of Spain against the Turks or other enemies. Aufield met Davis at Rouen and brought him to Rheims to meet Williams. Davis&#x27;s plan was conveyed to the Pope, who referred Davis to the King of Spain.

On the failure of the negotiations, Aufield returned to England and was arrested for circulating Catholic texts and sent to the Tower, and again put to torture. Aufield was charged under Religion Act 1580 s.4 which prohibited publication of any book against the queen. He was then transferred to Newgate. He was then tried, convicted and hanged at Tyburn alongside his assistant Thomas Webley. He was beatified in 1929. His feast day is 6 July, the date of his martyrdom.

<text>Regionalisation is the tendency to form decentralised regions.

Regionalisation or land classification can be observed in various disciplines:

*In agriculture, see Agricultural Land Classification.
*In biogeography, see Biogeography#Biogeographic units.
*In ecology, see Ecological land classification.
*In geography, it has two ways: the process of delineating the Earth, its small areas or other units into regions and a state of such a delineation.
*In globalisation discourse, it represents a world that becomes less interconnected, with a stronger regional focus.
*In politics, it is the process of dividing a political entity or country into smaller jurisdictions (administrative divisions or subnational units) and transferring power from the central government to the regions; the opposite of unitarisation. See &quot;Regionalism (politics)&quot;.
*In sport, it is when a team has multiple &quot;home&quot; venues in different cities. Examples of regionalized teams include a few teams in the defunct American Basketball Association, or the Green Bay Packers when they played in both Green Bay and Milwaukee from 1933 to 1994.
* In linguistics, it is when a prestige language adopts features of a regional language, such as how, in medieval times, Church Latin developed regional pronunciation differences in the countries it was used, including Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, England, Germany, Denmark, Hungary, and Slavic countries.

<text>Charles Hinton Russell (December 27, 1903 – September 13, 1989) was an American politician who served as the 20th Governor of Nevada. He was a member of the Republican Party.

==Biography==
Russell was born on December 27, 1903, in Lovelock, Nevada. He graduated from the University of Nevada in 1926. He taught school in Ruby Valley for one term and then went to Ruth to work for the copper company. He was the editor of the &quot;Ely Record&quot; for seventeen years, beginning in 1929.

==Political career==
Russell was a member of the Nevada state Senate from 1941 to 1946. After that, he was elected as a Republican to the Eightieth Congress, succeeding Democrat Berkeley L. Bunker, who ran unsuccessfully for the U. S. Senate. He was an unsuccessful candidate for reelection in 1948 to the Eighty-first Congress, narrowly losing to Reno City Councilman Walter S. Baring. He was elected Nevada Governor in 1951 and signed into law SB79, which made Nevada into a right-to-work state. He left office in 1959.

==Death==
Russell died on September 13, 1989, in Carson City, Nevada, at the age of 85. He is interred at the Dayton Cemetery in Dayton, Nevada.

<text>Regionalism is a political ideology that seeks to increase the political power, influence and self-determination of the people of one or more subnational regions. It focuses on the &quot;development of a political or social system based on one or more&quot; regions, and/or the national, normative, or economic interests of a specific region, group of regions or another subnational entity, gaining strength from or aiming to strengthen the &quot;consciousness of and loyalty to a distinct region with a homogeneous population&quot;, similarly to nationalism. More specifically, &quot;regionalism refers to three distinct elements: movements demanding territorial autonomy within unitary states; the organization of the central state on a regional basis for the delivery of its policies including regional development policies; political decentralization and regional autonomy&quot;.

Regions may be delineated by administrative divisions, culture, language and religion, among others. Regionalists&#x27; demands occur in &quot;strong&quot; forms (such as sovereigntism, separatism, sovereignty, secession and independence), as well as more &quot;moderate&quot; campaigns for greater autonomy (such as states&#x27; rights, decentralization or devolution). Strictly speaking, regionalists favour confederations over unitary nation states with strong central governments. They may, however, embrace intermediate forms of federalism. Proponents of regionalism usually claim that strengthening the governing bodies and political powers within a region, at the expense of a centralized government, will benefit local populations by improving regional or local economies, in terms of better fiscal responsibility, regional development, allocation of resources, implementation of localist policies and plans, competitiveness among regions and, ultimately, the whole country, consistent with the principle of subsidiarity.

== Definition ==
Regionalism, autonomism, separatism and nationalism are interrelated concepts, yet they often have different and sometimes opposite meanings. For instance, in Spain &quot;regionalism&quot; is regarded as strongly associated with &quot;nationalism&quot; and, often, &quot;separatism&quot;, whereas in Italy, it is generally seen as a synonym of &quot;federalism&quot; and the opposite of &quot;nationalism&quot;. In some cases movements or parties campaigning for independence may push for federalism or autonomy within the pre-existing nation state.

In developed, Western, liberal-democratic countries, secessionist parties include the &quot;Parti Québécois&quot; in Quebec (Canada), the Scottish National Party and the Scottish Greens in Scotland (United Kingdom), &quot;Plaid Cymru&quot; in Wales (United Kingdom) and, to some extent, &quot;Sinn Féin&quot; in Northern Ireland (United Kingdom), the New Flemish Alliance and Vlaams Belang in Flanders (Belgium), &quot;Corsica Libera&quot; in Corsica (France), the Basque Nationalist Party and &quot;Euskal Herria Bildu&quot; in the Basque Country (Spain and France), Together for Catalonia and the Republican Left of Catalonia in Catalonia and the Catalan Countries (Spain and France), the Galician Nationalist Bloc in Galicia (Spain), South Tyrolean Freedom and &quot;Die Freiheitlichen&quot; in South Tyrol (Italy), factions of &quot;Lega&quot; and several minor parties in northern Italy (Italy), nominally the Sardinian Action Party and several minor parties in Sardinia. In developing countries they include the Polisario Front in Western Sahara (Morocco), the National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad in Azawad (Mali), the Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda in the Cabinda Province (Angola), all national liberation movements and the Democratic Progressive Party in Taiwan (a country whose sovereignty is disputed by China).

Federalist and/or autonomist regional parties include the &quot;Coalition Avenir Québec&quot; in Quebec (Canada), the New Progressive Party and the Popular Democratic Party in Puerto Rico (a commonwealth of the United States), &quot;Femu a Corsica&quot; and the Party of the Corsican Nation in Corsica (France), &quot;Lega Nord&quot; and its sister/successor party &quot;Lega&quot; in northern Italy (the party has, at times, advocated Padania&#x27;s independence and its &quot;national section&quot; in Veneto, &quot;Liga Veneta&quot;, is a mild proponent of Venetian independence), the Martinican Progressive Party in Martinique and the Communist Party of Réunion in Réunion (both French overseas territories) and the New Macau Association in Macau (China).

In some countries, the development of regionalist politics may be a prelude to further demands for greater autonomy or even full separation, especially when ethnic, cultural and economic disparities are present. This was demonstrated, among other examples, in the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia in the early 1990s.

== Regional vs. regionalist ==
Political parties that are &quot;regional&quot; are not necessarily &quot;regionalist&quot; parties. A &quot;regional party&quot; is any political party with its political base in a single region, whatever its objectives and platform may be, whereas &quot;regionalist&quot; parties are a subset of regional parties that specifically campaign for greater autonomy or independence in their region.

Because regional parties – including regionalist parties – often cannot receive enough votes or legislative seats to be politically powerful, they may join political alliances or seek to be part of a coalition government. Notable examples include the Sinn Féin&#x27;s participation in the Northern Ireland Executive since 1999, the New Flemish Alliance&#x27;s participation in the Federal Government of Belgium in 2014–2019 and &quot;Lega&quot;&#x27;s frequent participation in the Italian government.

Examples of regional parties that do not generally campaign for greater autonomy or federalism include most provincial parties in Canada, most regional and minority parties in Europe, notably including the Christian Social Union in Bavaria (Germany), most political parties in Belgium, most political parties in Northern Ireland (United Kingdom), the Istrian Democratic Assembly in Istria (Croatia), the Alliance of Primorje-Gorski Kotar in Primorje-Gorski Kotar (Croatia) and most political parties in India.

Regional parties with an autonomist/federalist or separatist agendas have included the aforementioned &quot;Bloc Québécois&quot;, &quot;Lega Nord&quot;, the &quot;Vlaams Belang&quot;, the New Flemish Alliance, the defunct Catalan European Democratic Party, the Republican Left of Catalonia, the Scottish National Party, &quot;Plaid Cymru&quot; and &quot;Sinn Féin&quot;

<text>John Sankey, 1st Viscount Sankey (26 October 1866 – 6 February 1948) was a British lawyer, judge, Labour politician and Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain, famous for many of his judgments in the House of Lords. He gave his name to the Sankey Declaration of the Rights of Man (1940).

==Background and education==
He was the son of Thomas Sankey, a grocer of Moreton-in-Marsh, Gloucestershire, by his second wife Catalina (née Dewsbury). Sankey&#x27;s father died when he was 8 years old, when the family moved to Castle Road (now City Road) in Roath, Cardiff. Sankey was educated at a local Anglican school, and with the financial support of an Anglican clergyman he attended Lancing College, a public school in Sussex. He studied at Jesus College, Oxford, graduating with a second-class BA in Modern History in 1889, and a third-class Bachelor of Civil Law degree in 1891. He was called to the Bar at Middle Temple in 1892.

==Political and legal career==
Sankey began his practice as a barrister in south Wales, later specialising in workmen&#x27;s compensation cases. In 1909 he was appointed a King&#x27;s Counsel.

Sankey became a judge of the High Court, King&#x27;s Bench Division, in 1914. In 1919, Prime Minister David Lloyd George appointed him to chair the Sankey Commission into the coal industry, which recommended a seven-hour day for miners and the nationalisation of the industry. He was appointed a Lord Justice of Appeal in 1928.

On Labour&#x27;s victory in the 1929 general election, Sankey was appointed Lord Chancellor by Ramsay MacDonald, and was raised to the peerage as Baron Sankey, of Moreton in the County of Gloucester. He was one of the few Labour politicians to follow MacDonald into the National Government in 1931, and served as Lord Chancellor until 1935, when Stanley Baldwin re-entered office. In 1932 he was created Viscount Sankey, of Moreton in the County of Gloucester.

Several of his judgments in the House of Lords have become landmark statements of law. Sankey&#x27;s judgment in &quot;Woolmington v DPP&quot; [1935] AC 462 is famous for iterating the duty inherent on the prosecution to prove the prisoner&#x27;s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. In pertinent part, his judgment stated:
Throughout the web of the English criminal law one golden thread is always to be seen – that it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner&#x27;s guilt subject to what I have already said as to the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception...
This judgment is usually referred to as the &quot;golden thread&quot;.

Sitting in the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, Lord Sankey gave decisions in significant Canadian constitutional law cases. Of particular note is Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General) (often referred to as the Persons Case). In his decision, Sankey affirmed that women are eligible to be appointed to the Senate of Canada. In his analysis, he set out the living tree doctrine of constitutional interpretation that has become a foundation of Canadian constitutional law. In another significant decision, the Aeronautics Reference, Sankey held that the federal government had exclusive regulatory jurisdiction over aeronautics.

== Sankey Declaration ==
Sankey&#x27;s name was associated with the Sankey Declaration of the Rights of Man, the product of the Sankey Committee, which was set up in 1940 by the &quot;Daily Herald&quot; and the National Peace Council, and which Sankey chaired. The most active member of the committee was H. G. Wells, who prepared the draft that the Declaration was based on. It identified eleven fundamental human rights:
*right to life
*protection of minors
*duty to the community
*right to knowledge
*freedom of thought and worship
*right to work
*right to personal property
*freedom of movement
*personal liberty
*freedom from violence
*right of law-making.

The Sankey Declaration was widely publicised by its sponsors at the time, but has since been largely forgotten, having been overtaken by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

Sankey played a key role in establishing the legal framework of the newly disestablished Church in Wales.

==Personal life==
Sankey never married. He died in London on 6 February 1948, aged 81, when the peerage became extinct. He is buried in The Lower Cemetery of Moreton in Marsh, Gloucestershire. A house at his former school Lancing College is named after him. Sankey endowed a scholarship for students at Jesus College Oxford seeking to practise at the English Bar.

<doc id="868296" wikidata="Q164025" url="?curid=868296" title="Patrol Boat, River">
<text>Patrol Boat, Riverine, or PBR, is the United States Navy designation for a small rigid-hulled patrol boat used in the Vietnam War from March 1966 until 1975. They were deployed in a force that grew to 250 boats, the most common craft in the River Patrol Force, Task Force 116, and were used to stop and search river traffic in areas such as the Mekong Delta, the Rung Sat Special Zone, the Saigon River and in I Corps, in the area assigned to Task Force Clearwater, in an attempt to disrupt weapons shipments. In this role, they frequently became involved in firefights with enemy soldiers on boats and on the shore, were used to insert and extract Navy SEAL teams, and were employed by the United States Army&#x27;s 458th Transportation Company, known as the 458th Sea Tigers. 

The PBR was replaced by the Special Operations Craft – Riverine (SOC-R)

==Design==
The PBR was a versatile boat with a fiberglass hull and water jet drive which enabled it to operate in shallow, weed-choked rivers. It drew only of water fully loaded. The drives could be pivoted to reverse direction, turn the boat in its own length, or come to a stop from full speed in a few boat lengths.

The PBR was manufactured in two versions, the first with length and 10-foot, 7-inch beam. The Mark II version was long, and had a wider beam than the Mark I. It also had improved drives to reduce fouling and aluminum gunwales to resist wear.

The PBR was designed by Willis Slane and Jack Hargrave of Hatteras Yachts, located in High Point, NC at the time, and its hull was based on an existing Hatteras Yacht hull. Just seven days after a meeting with US Navy officials, Slane and Hargrave had a prototype ready.

The 11 PBRs delivered in March 1966 and the approximately 300 delivered over the next few years to the U.S. and South Vietnamese military were based on a pleasure boat design constructed by Uniflite, a boatyard in Bellingham, Washington, on the northern end of Puget Sound near the Canadian border.

In October 1965, the Navy awarded a contract to the company for construction of 140 PBRs. The first craft off the assembly line, called the Mark I, was 31 feet long with a hull constructed entirely of fiberglass, a technology developed in the early 1950s.

===Crew===
The PBR was usually manned by a four-man crew. Typically, a First Class Petty Officer served as boat captain, with a gunner&#x27;s mate, an engineman and a seaman on board. Each crewman was cross-trained in each other&#x27;s jobs in the event one became unable to carry out his duties. Generally, PBRs operated in pairs under the command of a patrol officer who rode on one of the boats.

===Power===
The boats were powered by dual Detroit Diesel 6V53N engines with Jacuzzi Brothers 14YJ water-jet drives. The boats reached top speeds of .

===Armament===
The boats had a comparatively heavy firepower for their size. Typical armament configuration included twin M2HB .50 caliber (12.7 mm) machine guns forward in a rotating, shielded tub, a single rear M2HB, one or two M60 7.62 mm light machine guns mounted on the port and starboard sides, and a Mk 18 grenade launcher. There was also a full complement of M16 rifles, shotguns, .45 ACP handguns and hand grenades. Some had a &quot;piggyback&quot; arrangement, a .50 cal machine gun on top of an 81mm mortar; others had a bow-mounted Mk16 Mod 4 Colt 20 mm automatic cannon, derived from the AN/M3 version of the Hispano-Suiza HS.404 and also found on the LCMs and PBRs.

The boats are not well protected, aside from some ceramic armor shielding for the machine gun pit, and some quarter-inch thick steel armor plate for the coxswain&#x27;s flat.

They were designed to rely on rapid acceleration, maneuverability, and speed to get out of dangerous situations.

==Operational career==
From 1966 to 1972, PBRs were operated by the Navy as the principal component of Task Force 116. PBRs operated with the U.S. Naval Reserve up until 1995 at Mare Island, California, prior to the base&#x27;s closure due to BRAC action that year. During the Vietnam War, Mare Island was home to the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Repair Facilities, Mothballing Operations, Submarine Operations, and Riverine Training Operations for both Patrol Craft Fast (PCF—more commonly known as Swift Boats), PBRs, and the River Assault Boats of the Mobile Riverine Force.

The training areas for the PBRs and Swift Boats still exist today within the Napa Sonoma Marsh state wildlife area. Sloughs such as Dutchman Slough, China Slough, Napa Slough, Devil&#x27;s Slough, Suisun marshland and the Napa River all run through the former training area.

Since the Navy was busy patrolling the rivers, the U.S. Army had to secure the waters around its military ports. So, it converted the 458th Transportation Company (LARC) into a PBR company in early 1968 under the 18th Military Police Brigade. With the company headquarters at Cat Lai, the company assigned pairs of PBRs to each of the Army ports. The crews consisted of two army mariners, coxswain and engineman, and two military police as gunners.

In the late 1990s, what remained of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s PBR force was solely in the Naval Reserve (Swift Boats had been retired from the active duty U.S. Navy immediately following the Vietnam War during the early 1970s), and was moved further inland towards Sacramento, California, the state capital, which is also intertwined with rivers. From Sacramento, PBRs could still transit directly to and through San Francisco Bay and into the Pacific Ocean, if need be. The waters of the State Wildlife Area, next to the former U.S. Navy (Riverine) training base at Mare Island, are still available for U.S. Navy PBR usage.

== Medals ==
James &quot;Willie&quot; Williams was a United States Navy sailor commanding PBR &quot;105&quot;. During a patrol operation on 31 October 1966, an engagement between the two PBRs (105 and one other) and two Viet Cong (VC) sampans escalated into a three-hour running battle involving more than 50 enemy vessels, numerous VC ground troops, and U.S. Navy attack helicopter support. For his role in this battle, Williams received the Medal of Honor. According to the citation, &quot;the patrol accounted for the destruction or loss of 65 enemy boats and inflicted numerous casualties on the enemy personnel.&quot; Williams is considered the most heavily decorated enlisted sailor in U.S. Navy history. The U.S. Navy posthumously named a guided missile destroyer, USS &quot;James E. Williams&quot;, after him.

On March 6, 1967, United States Navy Seaman David George Ouellet was the forward machine gunner on PBR &quot;124&quot;. After observing a grenade hurtled in his boats direction, Seaman Ouellet left the protection of his position and ran to the rear of his boat warning his shipmates to take cover. He then pushed the boat&#x27;s captain down to safety and placed himself between the grenade and his shipmates. His actions saved the other men, but Ouellet was mortally wounded when the grenade detonated. For his actions that day, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. 

Patrick Osborne Ford was a United States Navy sailor serving on a PBR patrol boat who was killed in South Vietnam after he saved the lives of two of his shipmates. The U.S. Navy posthumously awarded him the Navy Cross and later named a frigate, USS &quot;Ford&quot; (FFG-54), after him.

A major part of the action in the 1979 movie &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; takes place on a fictional United States Navy PBR that used the radio call-sign &quot;PBR Street Gang&quot;.

An unarmed PBR Mk. II replica called &quot;Boat Machine&quot; or &quot;Du Ma&quot; was used in the &quot;Seamen&quot; special of the television show &quot;The Grand Tour&quot; by Jeremy Clarkson, who claimed that as there were no surviving PBRs the replica had to be built completely from scratch in New Zealand. The total cost of building Clarkson&#x27;s PBR was £100,000.

&quot;Gunboat&quot; is a simulation video game of the PBR developed and released by Accolade in 1990 for MS-DOS.

<doc id="868298" wikidata="Q3140798" url="?curid=868298" title="Political unitarism">
<text>Political unitarism designates various theories, concepts or policies that advocate or enforce a fully unified and centralized system of government, with ultimate goal in creating a unitary state. In practice, unitarism is often manifested as a political doctrine or movement within complex political entities (confederations, federations, and other political unions), advocating for the highest degree of political integration and unification, beyond mere administrative centralization. 

One of the main goals of political unitarists (proponents of unitarism) is to abolish or substantially suppress all forms of regional self-government and autonomy, by transferring powers of confederated states, federal units, autonomous regions or cantons directly to the central government. Unitarization and regionalization are often confused with centralization and decentralization, respectively.

==History==

Historically, complex processes of political unitarization were often accompanied by political struggle between proponents of unitarism and radical centralization, and their opponents, advocating decentralization and regionalism. In political history, that kind of political struggle was very frequent, even from ancient times. One of the most famous examples of local resistance to political unitarism in classical times was the internal conflict between ancient Athens and other federated city-states within the Delian League.

In modern history, one of the most notable examples of political unitarization was the creation of Kingdom of Great Britain by the Acts of Union in 1701, and subsequently the creation of United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland by the Acts of Union in 1800.

One of practical goals of political unitarism is to create a singular legislature, with exclusive legislative powers over the entire territory of a state. Through the process of political unitarization, local regions within an emerging unitary state are deprived of any form of contract with the centralized government. Thus, the remaining regional powers, if any have been left at all, are not protected by being entrenched in the constitution of the unitary state; they can be reduced even more, or completely abolished, by the acts of the central government.

<doc id="868308" wikidata="Q7988311" url="?curid=868308" title="Western Spaces">
<text>Western Spaces is a collaborative album by the American ambient musicians Steve Roach and Kevin Braheny. This album is the first of Steve Roach’s many musical tributes to the Southwestern Desert.

On several tracks Kevin Braheny uses his trademark sound created by playing a cello preset on his Steiner EWI (Electronic Woodwind Instrument). This album was originally released on the Innovative Communications label by Chameleon Records as a Steve Roach/Kevin Braheny/Richard Burmer album and was released later the same year on the Fortuna label as a Steve Roach/Kevin Braheny album, with Burmer&#x27;s solo contributions (“A Story from the Rain” and “Across the View”) replaced by two pieces from Roach.

The liner notes contain a poem by Roach&#x27;s wife Linda Kohanov from which many of the song titles and perhaps the album title were derived.

<doc id="868312" wikidata="Q1952515" url="?curid=868312" title="Dreamtime Return">
<text>Dreamtime Return (1988) is a double album by the American ambient musician Steve Roach, based on Australian Aboriginal culture and the concept of the Dreamtime. Described as &quot;one of the pivotal works of ambient music&quot; and &quot;groundbreaking,&quot; the album has been included on a number of lists of the world&#x27;s best music, including &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot;.

== Overview ==
Roach had already begun composing this album when by chance he received a letter from writer/photographer David Stahl. Stahl had heard Steve Roach’s third album, &quot;Structures from Silence&quot;, on the radio while driving through the desert towards Mexico. He informed Steve Roach of his current documentary film project &quot;Art of the Dreamtime&quot;. Several months later Roach and Stahl traveled to Northern Australia to visit that region&#x27;s ancient Aboriginal sites.

The earliest recorded track on the album is “The Other Side”. This piece was recorded live, with Kevin Braheny playing a Steiner EWI (Electronic Woodwind Instrument). This piece was broadcast on the National Public Radio program &quot;Music from the Hearts of Space&quot; in 1986. This particular edition of the program, titled &quot;Starflight 1&quot;, was so popular that later that year it was released as an album, consequently “The Other Side” was released two years before the rest of &quot;Dreamtime Return&quot;.

Before this album was released, Steve Roach traveled to Australia for musical inspiration.

== Reception ==
In a 1989 appraisal for &quot;CD Review&quot;, Linda Kohanov lauded &quot;Dreamtime Return&quot; as Roach&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece&quot; and wrote that Roach &quot;demonstrates that electronic music&#x27;s greatest potential may lie in bringing our most elusive dreams and ancient memories into focus through potent, highly imaginative soundscapes.&quot;

&quot;Dreamtime Return&quot; helped Roach gain a worldwide reputation. Retrospectively, the album has been described by the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;″s Roger Catlin as &quot;groundbreaking&quot;, and by AllMusic as a landmark of &quot;fourth world&quot; music. Author David B. Knight opined that Roach &quot;seeks to activate listeners to reach a deep level of consciousness that draws upon the trance-inducing music he has created.&quot; Reviewing the album&#x27;s 1998 reissue, Mark Burbey of &quot;Alternative Press&quot; wrote that &quot;Dreamtime Return&quot; &quot;remains a landmark recording of extraordinary emotional resonance.&quot; It has also been included on a number of lists of the world&#x27;s best music, including Tom Moon&#x27;s &quot;1,000 Recordings to Hear Before You Die&quot; (2008), which notes that it has come to be regarded as &quot;one of the pivotal works of ambient music.&quot; 

John Diliberto, host of the ambient music radio program &quot;Echoes&quot;, commented in 2005 that &quot;Dreamtime Return&quot; was &quot;a seminal recording that has influenced a generation of musicians&quot;, while &quot;Hearts of Space&quot; presenter Stephen Hill said, &quot;Musically &quot;Dreamtime&quot; richly deserves its classic status, but Roach also deserves credit for leading electronic musicians out of their sheltered studios and into an active relationship with the landscape, the wider world, and deep cultural history.&quot;

After &quot;Dreamtime Return&quot; was remastered and reissued for its 30th anniversary in 2018, Bryon Hayes from &quot;Exclaim!&quot; wrote, &quot;Thirty years later, in a period of intense rediscovery of barely remembered classic albums, it&#x27;s fitting that this iconic gem has been uncovered.&quot;

<text>The chiesa di Sant&#x27;Agostino (Church of St Augustine) is the second largest church in San Gimignano, Italy, after the Collegiata. It is owned by the Order of Saint Augustine.

Sant&#x27;Agostino is an imposing 13th century building. The interior is a large hall dominated by the seventeen-panel fresco cycle on &quot;The Life of St Augustine&quot; around the high altar, painted by Benozzo Gozzoli between 1463 and 1467. By Benozzo is also a votive fresco of Saint Sebastian commissioned by the Augustinians after the 1464 plague. Unlike traditional depictions the Saint as a martyr, he is shown in a tunicle and large cloak, shielding the population praying at his feet. A painted inscription on the floor dates the work to July 28, 1464. The altarpiece is the &quot;Coronation of the Virgin&quot; by Piero del Pollaiuolo (1483). There are a number of other frescoes in the church. The &quot;Cappella di San Bartolo&quot; houses the remains of the eponymous saint (1228–1300), a lay Franciscan who died of leprosy. The magnificent altar in the chapel is by Benedetto da Maiano.

*Hope - [Germany] - in production

==History==
The first international distribution took place in the Soviet Union in 1990 before the breakup of the nation into its current individual parts, including Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Belarus and other relatively new countries.

This was followed up in the early 90s by distribution in Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, and other former Eastern bloc nations.

Since then distribution has spread into other Eastern European regions and former USSR countries, followed by success in China, Mongolia, and Francophone Africa, where it has representatives in Mali, Benin, Togo, Cameroon and Congo (RDC), and the Middle East.

===Climate===
Nanmoku has a humid continental climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) characterized by warm summers and cold winters with heavy snowfall. The average annual temperature in Nanmoku is 11.0 °C. The average annual rainfall is 1127 mm with September as the wettest month. The temperatures are highest on average in August, at around 24.0 °C, and lowest in January, at around -1.3 °C.

==Demographics==
Per Japanese census data, the population of Nanmoku peaked around the year 1950 and has decreased drastically since then. As of 2023, 67.5% of the population is 65 or older, making Nanmoku the oldest village in Japan.

==History==
During the Edo period, the area of present-day Nanmoku was largely part of the &quot;tenryō&quot; territory held directly by Tokugawa shogunate within Kōzuke Province. The area was divided into villages with the establishment of the modern municipalities system on April 1, 1889. The village of Nanmoku was created on March 15, 1955 by the merger of the villages of Iwado, Tsukigata and Ozawa.

==Government==
Nanmoku has a mayor-council form of government with a directly elected mayor and a unicameral village council of eight members. Nanmoku, together with the other municipalities in Kanra District contributes one member to the Gunma Prefectural Assembly. In terms of national politics, the town is part of Gunma 5th district of the lower house of the Diet of Japan.

==Economy==
During the postwar decades Nanmoku had a thriving economy anchored by sericulture, konjac cultivation and forestry. However, by the late 20th century konjac production had relocated to more economical areas while Nanomku&#x27;s silk and forest products struggled to compete with cheap foreign imports. The lack of economic opportunity accelerated Nanmoku&#x27;s population decline, further weakening the economy. In the present day, economic activity in Nanmoku is centered around services and small-scale agriculture.

==Education==
Nanmoku has a nursery school, compulsory school operated by the village government. The village does not have a high school.

==Transportation==
===Railway===
Nanmoku is not served by any passenger railway service. The nearest train station is Shimonita Station in the neighboring town of Shimonita.

===Highway===
Nanmoku is not served by any national highways.

==Local attractions==
Nanmoku is popular locally for its scenery. The village is located in the valley of a small mountain range, where there are excellent hiking opportunities. One of the mountains, Mt. Arahune, is home to a park with a campsite, including a large multipurpose recreational area that has tennis, water sports, and fishing facilities. There is also an astronomy center located on the grounds. Nanmoku also has a museum that documents local culture and history.

The village is particularly famous for , the two-day local fire festival, the largest in the prefecture. Many people who have moved away but still have family in the village return for this festival, and it is popular with tourists as well. Though such fire festivals were once popular, few remain. Nanmoku&#x27;s version falls on August 14 and 15, and coincides with Obon, a festival honoring ancestors. However, Hitoboshi itself commemorates the village&#x27;s victorious alliance with the Takeda clan during the Sengoku period. During the festival, villagers take turns standing on a bridge and twirling burning bales of hay over the edge.

<doc id="868336" wikidata="Q6886961" url="?curid=868336" title="Mobile Riverine Force">
<text>In the Vietnam War, the Mobile Riverine Force (MRF) (after May 1967), initially designated Mekong Delta Mobile Afloat Force, and later the Riverines, were a joint US Army and US Navy force that comprised a substantial part of the brown-water navy. It was modeled after lessons learned by the French experience in the First Indochina War of Dinassaut and had the task of both transport (of soldiers and equipment) and combat. The primary land base was at Đồng Tâm Base Camp, with a floating base which operated in the major rivers of the Mekong Delta. Soldiers and sailors went out in river boats from the floating base to assault the Viet Cong. During part of the 1968-69 period, there were two such mobile bases operating in different parts of the Delta, Mobile Riverine Groups Alpha and Bravo. The MRF played a key role in the Tet Offensive.

==Concept of operations==
The Mekong Delta Mobile Afloat Force was originally conceived as providing an all weather &quot;strike&quot; capability in the Mekong Delta, to actively prosecute contact with Viet Cong units in the Vietnam War. A &quot;strike&quot; force was inherently and essentially different from the existing Navy interdiction and patrol forces (the River Patrol Boats of Operation Game Warden, and the coastal blockade of Operation Market Time). The Delta presented a classic venue appropriate to riverine operations such as had not been seen since the Union Navy in the (American Civil War) Mississippi Delta, and Sino-American operations in World War II. The Delta had a dearth of reliable roadways, all with predictable choke points at bridges, a literal myriad of creeks, streams, rivers, and canals, frequent monsoon conditions restricting air operations, and ground conditions that were often muddy.

==Historical experience==

A wide range of riverine craft were used by the allies, both before, and during the formalization of the US Navy Brown Water Navy, in 1964–1965. Foremost were the surplus World War II US naval craft; LCMs, LCVPs, LSMs, PGMs, LSSLs, etc., as well as post-war &quot;Nasty&quot; class patrol boats. One of the most popular riverine craft was the all-steel LCM converted into a naval Monitor, and was used by the French during the first Indochina war; and later by the US and South Vietnamese Navies. However, The French, during their war in Vietnam (1945–1954), had been heavily inspired by the US Navy LCVP, which they had received from the US, as part of the United States massive assistance program to fight communism. The French took the LCVP design and created an all new, and as it turned out, the only &quot;original&quot; or entirely new boat built for riverine warfare during the French Indochina war; the STCAN (a corruption of the acronym STCN, which stood for the French equivalent of the US Navy&#x27;s BuShips, which read Service Technique de Construction Navale). The French STCAN was built of steel, approximately long, &quot;V&quot; hulled, with a shiplike bow, was armed with one .50 cal machine gun, three .30 cal machine guns, and eight crewmen.

==Creation of the Mobile Riverine Force==

The Mekong Delta Mobile Riverine Force concept paired newly created assault boat units with a brigade of Army infantry. The force contained a U.S. Army reinforced brigade consisting of three infantry battalions, an artillery battalion, and other combat and combat service support. 

The force would be based aboard U.S. Navy ships that would include 5 self-propelled barracks ships, 2 LST&#x27;s, 2 large harbor tugs, and 2 landing craft repair ships. In addition, two U.S. Navy river assault groups would provide tactical water mobility. 

Each assault group would be capable of lifting the combat elements of one reinforced infantry battalion. A small salvage craft would be necessary to recover damaged ships or craft. The reinforced brigade would be organized under the current standard ROAD (Reorganization Objective Army Divisions) tables of organization and equipment, with limited augmentation. Certain equipment specified in the tables, such as tents, mess facilities, 106mm recoilless rifles, antitank wire-guided missiles, and all wheeled vehicles except artillery prime movers were to be deleted from the force requirements. The number of 90mm recoilless rifles in each rifle company was to be reduced from six to three to improve the mobility of the weapons squads. The 4.2-inch mortars would accompany the force and be moved by water or air to field positions as necessary. Radios would be either ship-mounted or man-portable. 

Coxswains of plastic assault boats were to be designated in the proposed tables and trained upon arrival in Vietnam. Enough troops from each of the units afloat would be left at a land base to maintain equipment left in storage. 

The plan provided for an augmentation of three counter-mortar radar sections, each manned by nine men, to operate and maintain ship-mounted counter-mortar radars. 

A mobile Army surgical hospital team, U.S. Air Force tactical air control parties which included forward air controllers, Army of the Republic of Vietnam liaison troops, and additional ANPRC-25 radios were to be furnished from sources outside the parent division of the brigade.

Each river assault group, later designated river assault squadron, was to consist of the following: 52 Armored Troop Carriers (ATCs or &quot;Tangos&quot;), 10 Monitors with 40mm cannon and 81mm mortar, 32 Assault Support Patrol Boats (ASPBs), 5 Monitors to serve as command and control boats and 2 LCM-6&#x27;s to serve as refuelers. A salvage force would include: 2 2,000-ton heavy lift craft, 2 YTB&#x27;s for salvage, 2 LCU&#x27;s (landing craft, utility), and 3 100-ton floating dry docks.

==Navy Assault Squadrons==
Originally two, and ultimately four Navy Assault Squadrons were created: River Assault Squadrons 9, 11, 13 and 15. The 2nd (Riverine) Brigade of the U.S. 9th Infantry Division was assigned to work with these units. A fixed land base was created by dredging a portion of the Song Ham Luong near My Tho and was named &quot;Đồng Tâm.&quot; This became the administrative headquarters of the MRF.

Nonetheless, the Navy created a floating Mobile Riverine Base (MRB) by assigning barracks ships, and barrage barges (non-self propelled) to house both Army and Navy personnel, provide communications and staff support, mooring and support facilities on Ammi pontoons alongside, and refit, rearm and resupply stores. The MRB also included repair ships (ARLs) and supply ships (LSTs). The ships of the MRB also had helicopter landing capabilities, providing air resupply and medical air evacuation (&quot;dust off&quot;) capability and had significant medical care facilities aboard. Thus, the entire force could move throughout the major rivers of the Delta, and launch troops, on boats, into assault operations deep into the narrowest rivulets and canals. Given the low limit speed of perhaps (or less if opposing the fierce lower Delta currents), this &quot;MOBILE&quot; capability made boat assault operations in the furthest reaches of the Delta feasible.

Eventually, the MRF included Army floating artillery and mortar barges, which could be moved throughout the Delta and positioned to support the planned area of each assault operation. Integral air support came from newly created Navy gunship helicopter squadron HAL 3 (Helicopter Attack, Light), the SEAWOLVES, based at Dong Tam a unit of CTF 116. This was additional to such air support, both troop insertion and gunfire ships, as the Army tasked to each operation, and air support from Air Force TAC air units on call.

The southern part of the city of Takasaki and all of the city of Tomioka were formerly part of the district.

==History==
The area of Kanra District was formerly part of Kōzuke Province and appears in Nara period records, such as the 711 AD &quot;Shoku Nihongi&quot; as .

Per a census conducted at the end of the Edo period, the area was divided into three towns and 79 villages administered as &quot;tenryō&quot; directly by the Tokugawa shogunate, 21 villages under the control of Nanokaichi Domain and 32 villages under the control of Obata Domain. Two more villages were under the shared control of Obata Domain and the Tokugawa shogunate.

On December 7, 1878, the area was divided into Minamikanra District (which became Tano District and Kitakanra District (present-day Kanra District).
With the establishment of the municipality system on April 1, 1889 the area was organized into five towns (Tomioka, Ichinomiya, Myōgi, Shimonita and Fukushima) and 18 villages.
