<text>Yuri Fyodorovich Orlov (, 13 August 1924 – 27 September 2020) was a particle accelerator physicist, human rights activist, Soviet dissident, founder of the Moscow Helsinki Group, a founding member of the Soviet Amnesty International group. He was declared a prisoner of conscience while serving nine years in prison and internal exile for monitoring the Helsinki human rights accords, he was declared a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International as a founder of the human rights movement in the Soviet Union. Following his release from exile, Orlov was allowed to emigrate to the U.S. and became a professor of physics at Cornell University. 

== Early career ==
Yuri Orlov was born into a working-class family on 13 August 1924 and grew up in a village near Moscow. His parents were Klavdiya Petrovna Lebedeva and Fyodor Pavlovich Orlov. In March 1933, his father died.

From 1944 to 1946, Orlov served as an officer in the Soviet army. In 1952, he graduated from the Moscow State University and began his postgraduate studies at the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Physics where he later worked as a physicist.

In 1956, Orlov nearly lost his scientist career due to his speech at the party meeting about discussion of the report &quot;On the Personality Cult and its Consequences&quot; by Khrushchev at the 20th Congress of the CPSU. He publicly called Stalin and Beria &quot;killers who were in power&quot; and put forward the requirement of &quot;democracy on the basis of socialism.&quot; For his pro-democracy speech in 1956, he was expelled from the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and fired from his job.

What is the meaning of life? That your soul may outlive your remains in something sacred and should escape decay ... I have again looked at, added up, corrected, and sized up what I have been doing during these last years and have seen that this is good ... 

Orlov obtained the Candidate of Sciences degree in 1958 and the Doctor of Sciences degree in 1963. He became an expert on particle acceleration. In 1968, he was elected a corresponding member of the Armenian Academy of Sciences after he found work at the Yerevan Physics Institute. In 1972, he came back to Moscow and worked at the Institute of Terrestrial Magnetism.

== Dissidence ==
In September 1973, when &quot;Pravda&quot; published a statement by a group of prominent academics denouncing Andrei Sakharov&#x27;s anti-patriotic activity, Orlov decided to support him, while recollecting the well memorized spells of the 1930s, in which some academics demanded the death penalty for others already arrested; later some of these academics themselves were arrested, with some academics who were not arrested demanding the death penalty for them.

Defending Sakharov, Orlov on 16 September 1973 wrote &quot;Open Letter to L.I. Brezhnev about the Reasons for the Intellectual Backwardness in the USSR and Proposals to Overcome It&quot; which appeared in underground samizdat circulation. The Western press published the letter in 1974 but publication in the Russian press was only in 1991. In the early 1970s, the article by Yuri Orlov &quot;Is a Non-Totalitarian Type of Socialism Possible?&quot; also appeared in underground samizdat circulation.

In 1973, he was fired after becoming a founding member of the first Amnesty International group in the Soviet Union.

In May 1976, he organized the Moscow Helsinki Group and became its chairman. Andrei Sakharov praised Orlov for systematically documenting Soviet violations of the human rights provisions of the Helsinki accords. Orlov ignored orders to disband the Moscow Helsinki Group when the KGB told him the group was illegal. The KGB head Yuri Andropov determined, &quot;The need has thus emerged to terminate the actions of Orlov, fellow Helsinki monitor Ginzburg and others once and for all, on the basis of existing law.&quot;

== Arrest and trial ==
On 10 February 1977, Orlov was arrested. In March 1977, Orlov published the article about his arrest &quot;The road to my arrest.&quot; In a closed trial, he was denied the right to examine evidence and to call witnesses.

The courtroom was filled with some 50 individuals selected by the authorities, while supporters and friends of Orlov, including Andrei Sakharov, were barred from entering because there was no room. Orlov&#x27;s summation was interrupted many times by the judge and the prosecutor and by spectators who shouted &quot;spy&quot; and &quot;traitor.&quot; According to Orlov&#x27;s wife Irina, hostile spectators in the courtroom applauded the sentence and shouted: &quot;You should have given him more.&quot;

Orlov at the trial argued that he has a right to criticize the government and a right to circulate such criticism under the freedom of information provisions of the Helsinki Accords. Orlov also argued that he circulated such information for humanitarian, not subversive, reasons. On 15 May 1978, Orlov was sentenced to seven years of a labor camp and five years internal exile for his work with the Moscow Helsinki Group.

=== Protests over Orlov&#x27;s trial ===
US President Jimmy Carter expressed his concern over the severity of the sentence and the secrecy of the trial. Washington senator Henry M. Jackson said, &quot;The Orlov trial, and the Ginzburg and Shcharansky incarcerations, are dramatic cases in point&quot; when discussing Soviet breaches of law. The US National Academy of Sciences officially protested against the trial of Orlov.

In the summer of 1978, 2,400 American scientists including physicists at the University of California&#x27;s Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory created &quot;Scientists for Sakharov, Orlov and Shcharansky&quot; (SOS), an international movement to promote and protect the human rights of scientists. An initiator of SOS was American physicist Andrew Sessler, its chairman was Prof. Morris Pripstein. Scientists at CERN have spoken out against Orlov&#x27;s imprisonment for &quot;disseminating anti-Soviet propaganda&quot;. 43 physicists have called off Soviet trips to protest his jailing.

== Imprisonment and exile ==

For a year and a half, Orlov was imprisoned in Lefortovo Prison, then Perm Camp 35 and 37. In Perm Camp 37, he mounted three hunger strikes to make the prison authorities return his confiscated writings and notes. Two articles written by him in the camp were smuggled and published abroad. On 5 July 1983, Austrian Chancellor Bruno Kreisky sent the Soviet leader Yuri Andropov a letter asking for his release to Austria, but it was intentionally not answered.

The New York-based Helsinki Watch issued a statement about Orlov&#x27;s health deterioration, &quot;He has frequent headaches and dizzy spells, resulting from an old skull injury. He suffers from kidney and prostate inflammation, low blood pressure, rheumatic pains, toothaches, insomnia and vitamin deficiency. Medical care in the labor camp is extremely inadequate.&quot; Orlov suffered from tuberculosis. He lost a good deal of weight and most of his teeth. Orlov&#x27;s wife said he looked emaciated and that she was &quot;very fearful for my husband&#x27;s health. The authorities are gradually killing him.&quot;

In 1984, Orlov was exiled to Kobyay in Siberia and was allowed to buy a house with a garden. On 14 November 1985, Professor George Wald raised the case of Orlov in a talk with the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev who answered he had not heard of Orlov.

== Deportation and US citizenship ==
On 30 September 1986, the KGB proposed to expel Orlov from the Soviet Union after depriving him of his Soviet citizenship and met with approval from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Orlov&#x27;s discharge from Siberian exile was part of the U.S.–Soviet deal to release journalist Nicholas Daniloff. Orlov&#x27;s release from exile and expulsion from the USSR lifted hopes among Westerners that the Helsinki process might finally start yielding progress. Former US President Jimmy Carter said, &quot;As for Orlov, we&#x27;re very delighted with this happy occurrence. We would like to meet with him if he comes to this country, but I don&#x27;t know that he will. I have no way of knowing his plans.&quot;

On 10 December 1986, Orlov was awarded the Carter–Menil Human Rights Prize of $100,000. In 1987, Orlov began work at Cornell University as a scientist and professor. Orlov was a visiting fellow at the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in 1988/89. A member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Orlov studied particle accelerator design, beam interaction analysis and quantum mechanics. He authored and co-authored numerous research papers, articles on human rights, and an autobiography, &quot;Dangerous Thoughts&quot; (1991).

In 1990, Gorbachev restored Soviet citizenship to Orlov and other 23 prominent exiles and emigres who lost the right in the period from 1966 to 1988. Orlov told Gorbachev, &quot;I would say you have a very great power in your hands, the K.G.B., and you should therefore carry out your reforms without fearing anyone at all. Afterward, you should liquidate the K.G.B., because it is a cancer.&quot; On 18 July 1991, Orlov and Elena Bonner wrote an open letter about the fact that Soviet army and special troops have been systematically deporting thousands of Armenians from Azerbaijan to Armenia.

In 1993, Orlov received American citizenship.

In 1995, the American Physical Society awarded him the Nicholson Medal for Humanitarian Service. In 2005, he was named the first recipient of the Andrei Sakharov Prize, awarded biennially by the American Physical Society to honor scientists for exceptional work in promoting human rights. In 2020, a few days before Orlov died, the American Physical Society awarded him the 2021 Robert R. Wilson Prize for Achievement in the Physics of Particle Accelerators for his scientific work and for &quot;embodying the spirit of scientific freedom.&quot;

In 2004, Orlov expressed his opinion about Russia and Vladimir Putin by saying, &quot;Russia is flying backwards in time. Putin is like Stalin, and he speaks in the language of the thug, the mafia.&quot; On 24 March 2005, Orlov wrote a letter to Putin to express disquiet over the criminal prosecution of Anna Mikhalchuk, Yuri Samodurov, and Ludmila Vasilovskaya in the case concerning the Sakharov Museum exhibition on religion.

Orlov participated in two documentaries about the Soviet dissident movement, &quot;They Chose Freedom&quot; in 2005, and &quot;Parallels, Events, People&quot; in 2014. He was a member of the Human Rights Watch Asia Advisory and Academic Freedom Committees, and member of the Honorary 25th Anniversary Committee, Global Rights.

Orlov died on 27 September 2020, aged 96.

<text>Lieutenant-Commander Arthur Leyland Harrison, VC (3 February 1886 – 23 April 1918) was an English Royal Navy officer, and World War I recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces.

==Early life==
Harrison was born in Torquay, Devon, and educated at Brockhurst Preparatory School, where he is remembered every Armistice Day and at Dover College. At school Harrison was a tremendous all-round games player and, whilst in the Navy, he played rugby union and was capped twice for the England national rugby union team. He is the only England rugby union international to have been awarded the VC. Rugby league namesake Jack Harrison was also awarded the VC posthumously in 1917.

On 15 September 1902 he was posted as a naval cadet to the pre-dreadnought battleship &quot;Mars&quot;, serving in the Channel Squadron. The following month it was reported that he would be lent to the armoured cruiser &quot;Good Hope&quot; which was in the last stages of completion before her first commission in November.

==First World War==
He served aboard the battlecruiser HMS &quot;Lion&quot; for most of the war, seeing action at the battle of Heligoland Bight in 1914 and battle of Dogger Bank in 1915. He also saw action at the Battle of Jutland in 1916, and was mentioned in despatches 

===Zeebrugge raid===
The Zeebrugge Raid was an attack in April 1918 on the Belgian port of Zeebrugge to stop it being a base for German submarines. The raid was two actions: landing raiding parties on the mole from the obsolete cruiser HMS &quot;Vindictive&quot; and two ferries and the sinking of three old ships in the entrance of the harbour to block it. &quot;Vindictive&quot; was fitted with howitzers, flame-throwers and mortars so she could be used against the German defenders and as well as naval raiding parties carried two infantry companies of the 4th Battalion, Royal Marine Light Infantry .

The official citation for the award:

His body was never recovered. He, along with three others who were missing in action on the Zeebrugge raid, are commemorated on the Zeebrugge Memorial, at the Zeebrugge Churchyard. He is also commemorated by a brass plaque, mounted in the Warrior Chapel at St Mary&#x27;s Wimbledon.

George Bradford who led the raiding parties from the ferry &quot;Iris II&quot; was also awarded a posthumous VC for his actions in the raid.

==The Medal==
His mother Adelaide Ellen Harrison, who lived in Wimbledon, London, received the VC and in 1967 relatives donated it to the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth, Devon where it is on public display.

<text>The Eagle&#x27;s Conquest is a 2001 novel by Simon Scarrow, about the Roman invasion of Britain in 43 AD. It is the second book in the &quot;Eagles of the Empire&quot; series.

==Plot summary==
The book opens immediately after the events of &quot;Under the Eagle&quot;, with the troops relaxing and watching prisoners of war fight to the death in a makeshift arena. &quot;Optio&quot; Cato is bequeathed an ivory-hilted sword by the chief centurion, Bestia, who was mortally wounded in the British ambush and respected Cato for his tenacity. Meanwhile, the legate of the Second Legion, Vespasian, worries about his wife Flavia back in Rome, whom he has learned has connections to &quot;The Liberators&quot;, a group of conspirators who want the feeble-minded Emperor Claudius out of power.

Soon afterwards the Legion moves off again, heading to the River Meadway (present-day Medway river, in Kent). As the Britons under Caratacus have heavily fortified the opposite bank, Macro and Cato are ordered to scout ahead for a ford upstream. Cato finds one, and the next day the attack goes in. The Ninth Legion, supported by artillery fire from triremes on the river, crosses and assault the enemy ramparts. After sustaining heavy losses, the attack falters, and only the Second Legion&#x27;s intervention saves the day. Using the ford upstream, the legionaries are able to surprise the Britons and attack them from behind, overrunning their encampment; Cato is badly burned when he accidentally spills a cauldron of boiling water over himself. While recuperating, he strikes up a friendship with the North African surgeon, a Carthaginian called Nisus. They discover that the lead shot the British were using in their slings came from the Legion&#x27;s stores, indicating there is a traitor placed high in the army command, supplying the British with arms in an attempt to undermine the campaign.

Over the next few days, the British are pushed back to the North Kent marshes, on the banks of the Tamesis river. The Second Legion is ordered to clear the southern bank in preparation for a crossing, but as twilight approaches, the Legion is scattered and lost in the marshes. Macro&#x27;s unit, with Cato in tow, is ambushed by a war band; Macro holds the Britons at bay while Cato and a handful of men escape by boat. When the roll-call is held, Macro is declared missing, presumed dead. Cato, in a fit of anguish, volunteers to be in the first wave of the troops crossing the river. It is a suicide mission, and he does not expect to live, but he is able to survive long enough for the second wave of Romans to reach him. Macro reappears, having survived his ordeal in the marshes, and chastises Cato for being a fool. Cato renews his friendship with Nisus the surgeon, who lets slip some of his bitterness at being a Carthaginian (one of many cultures conquered by the Romans) in the Roman army.

Meanwhile, the army has received orders to halt on the far side of the Tamesis so that Emperor Claudius can arrive and take command in person for the final assault in the British capital at Camulodunum; this is intended to boost his popularity with the &quot;populares&quot; in Rome. While waiting for the Emperor to arrive, tribune Vitellius, Macro and Cato&#x27;s nemesis, is plotting to assassinate him. He enlists Nisus, playing on his Carthaginian patriotism, and uses him as a liaison with the British tribes who resist Rome. Unfortunately, while crossing the lines one night, Nisus is accidentally killed by a sentry, and Cato, who is present, takes a bandage from his body; it is covered in strange markings and Cato thinks these are worth investigating. All thought of it is put out of his mind, however, when Claudius arrives, escorted by the Praetorian Guard and elephants to overawe the Britons. He insists on taking charge in the coming battle.

Despite the Emperor&#x27;s buffoonery, the final battle is won and the legions march into Camulodunum. To celebrate &#x27;his&#x27; victory, Claudius orders a lavish banquet to be held in his honour.

Vespasian finally gets to spend some time with his wife, and Cato renews his relationship with the slave girl Lavinia. Unfortunately, she is allied with Vitellius, having consorted with him previously whilst in the ownership of Tribune Plinius. She agrees to smuggle an ornate dagger into the banquet hall, believing it to be a gift for the Emperor. Before she does this, she decides to break up with Cato, who is aware that she is cheating on him with Vitellius. While she does this, Cato is fiddling with the late Nisus&#x27;s bandage, which he has in his pocket. When it is rolled up in a certain way, the markings become a coded message; Cato is only able to discover that it concerns a plot to kill the emperor before he is knocked out by Lavinia, who read on ahead and saw Vitellius&#x27; name. When he is woken by Macro, Lavinia has disappeared. The only hope of saving the Emperor is to warn Vespasian, who is at the feast, and hope he believes them. They get there in time to see Vitellius and Lavinia being presented to the emperor; while Claudius is distracted by Lavinia&#x27;s charms, a supposedly loyal Briton leaps at the emperor with a dagger.

Thanks to Cato&#x27;s intervention, the Emperor&#x27;s bodyguards are able to catch the assassin and mortally wound him. Vitellius finishes him off before he can talk, and discreetly murders Lavinia as he leaves. A distraught Cato is taken away by Macro before he is recognised as the Emperor&#x27;s saviour, and Vitellius, as in the last book, gets all the credit. He is given a position on the Emperor&#x27;s staff, and leaves with Claudius for Rome, leaving the legions to pacify the last remnants of resistance. Vespasian is tasked with an independent command for the coming months; clearing the south bank of the Thames of resistance. As for Cato, he is distracted by Macro, who promises to introduce him to his latest conquest - a young Briton called Boudicca...

<text>Stevens Point Brewery is a regional American brewery located in Stevens Point, Wisconsin. The brewery is the fifth-oldest continuously operating brewery and the third-oldest privately owned brewery in the nation.

The company&#x27;s sales volume among all breweries in the nation increased from 50th in 2009 to 32nd in 2015. Among craft breweries, the company&#x27;s sales volume ranks 25th in the nation as of 2015.

The brewer has won awards several times including the category for American-style amber three times for their &quot;Point Amber Classic&quot; brand (Gold in 1996; Silver in 2002; Gold in 2012), and three times in the Schwarzbier category for their &quot;Point 2012 Black Ale&quot; (Silver in 2011; Silver in 2012; Gold in 2013). The brewer has also won awards for other brands in its portfolio.

==History==
The company was founded in 1857 by George Ruder and Frank Wahle. In 1864, the company provided its beer to the troops during the American Civil War. The brewery was subsequently sold to Andrew and Jacob Lutz in 1867. The Lutz family continued operations until it was sold to Gustav Kuenzel in 1897. The company was then organized as the Gustav Kuenzel Brewing Company in 1901. The following year, it was renamed the Stevens Point Brewing Company. Ludwig Korfman purchased a controlling interest in the company in 1924 and reorganized the company as the Stevens Point Beverage Company. The company faced local competition from the mid-1860s through the Prohibition era of the 1920s, when the remaining competition went out of business. During the 1950s, the brewery began using cans in production. In 1973, Point Special brand beer was rated the top American beer in a taste test as reported by Mike Royko, a prominent columnist for the &quot;Chicago Daily News&quot;. By the 1970s the company was owned by Felix and Ken Shibilski. In 1990, the company first began selling its product outside Wisconsin, in Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Minnesota. In 1992, the Shibilskis sold the company to Chicago-based Barton Beers Ltd. The new ownership was unique for Barton in that Point beer was its only domestic product line, with all of its other offerings being imports. The company planned to tie sales to its Mexican brand, Corona, but when that brand&#x27;s sales exploded, the Point brand became a distraction. In 2002, the company was sold back to Wisconsin ownership by Milwaukee-based real estate developers Joe Martino and Jim Wiechmann. That same year, the company introduced gourmet sodas to its beverage list. In 2003, Point Special won the gold medal at the Great American Beer Festival in the premium lager category. In 2005, the company bought four beer brands from the James Page Brewing Company. By 2008, the company&#x27;s products were distributed to 18 different states. For nearly 20 years, the company brewed and bottled Karl Strauss Brewing Company brands until production was moved in January, 2009. The company expanded its annual brewery capacity to 100,000 barrels in 2011, and to 150,000 barrels in 2013.

<doc id="848395" wikidata="Q4862076" url="?curid=848395" title="Barometer Rising">
<text>Barometer Rising is a romantic-realist novel by Canadian author Hugh MacLennan. The work explores life in Halifax, Nova Scotia during World War I, and its interruption by the Halifax explosion. The narrative predominantly follows and pivots upon the romantic life of Penny Wain.

The book had been difficult to publish as MacLennan had previously written regarding international themes, while &quot;Barometer Rising&quot; contained a decidedly nationalist overtone. Once published, the novel was wildly successful, and permitted MacLennan to leave his full-time job at Lower Canada College.

The novel, with afterword by Alistair MacLeod, ranks among the books which compose the New Canadian Library.

==Background==
Dorothy Duncan, Hugh MacLennan&#x27;s wife, convinced him that the failure of his first two novels arose from not truly knowing the setting, as one had been set in Europe and the other in the United States. She encouraged him to write about Canada, the country he knew best. She told him that &quot;Nobody&#x27;s going to understand Canada until she evolves a literature of her own, and you&#x27;re the fellow to start bringing Canadian novels up to date.&quot; &quot;Barometer Rising&quot; became Hugh MacLennan&#x27;s first published novel. He drew upon his own experiences of the Halifax Explosion, having survived it as ten-year-old boy, but also on Homer&#x27;s &quot;Odyssey&quot; for narrative direction.

Prior to MacLennan&#x27;s novel, there had been no real tradition of Canadian literature; he sought to define Canada for Canadians through a national novel.

==Plot summary==
The novel takes place during the week of the Halifax Explosion - 2 December 1917 to 10 December 1917.

Penelope Wain believes that her cousin, Neil Macrae, has been killed while serving overseas under her father, Colonel Geoffrey Wain. The family is under the impression that Neil had died in the disgrace of desertion. Neil, however, had not died, but has returned to Halifax to clear his name of its tarnish. Neil seeks Alec MacKenzie, the only other survivor of their unit who can confirm that Colonel Wain had given an contradictory order, which was impossible to fulfill. When the order ended in disaster, Colonel Wain attempted to blame Neil in hopes of retaining his position in the military. Yet, prior to the court martial, Neil was believed to have died in artillery strike. Colonel Wain was forced to return to Canada as a transportation officer.

In Halifax, the war has given Penny the opportunity to become a successful naval architect at the Halifax Shipyard. She develops a friendship with Angus Murray, a doctor wounded from the war. Angus eventually proposes marriage to Penny; she defers the proposal. While her father, Colonel Wain, disapproves of Angus, he warms up to him after learning that Neil is alive and in Halifax. Neil and Penny had also been lovers and Angus realizes that Colonel Wain is desperate to ensure that Neil is not court martialed and given an opportunity to clarify the occurrences overseas. The colonel had been offered a new position in the war, and the trial will ruin his promotion.

Penny and Neil are briefly reunited, but Penny finds herself unable to reveal that she has given birth to their daughter, Jean, after their affair in Montreal. Jean had been adopted and cared for by her aunt and uncle. Angus intrudes upon the reunion to warn Neil of the colonel&#x27;s intentions. Neil leaves to find Alec, who is willing to testifying in Neil&#x27;s defence, despite the colonel providing Alec with a job at the shipyard. The men are later joined by Angus, who also agrees to testify in favour of Neil.

On the following morning, the Halifax Explosion occurs. The blast kills several characters, including Penny&#x27;s aunt and uncle.

Neil and Murray manage to rescue Alec and his wife from their house, although Alec had sustained grievous injury. Once the two men locate Penny, who had been wounded in the eye, Angus sets up a makeshift hospital at the Wains&#x27; house. Meanwhile, Neil enters the city to procure supplies and assist with rescue efforts, no longer concerned who will recognize him. Neil, however, is shocked when he finds Colonel Wain&#x27;s dead body in the wreckage of the explosion. Although Alec dies from his injuries, he and Murray acquire an affidavit with a testimony to clear Neil&#x27;s name. When Penny had recovered sufficiently from her injury and her surgery, she goes with Neil to retrieve Jean.

==Influence==
In Hugo MacPherson&#x27;s 1958 preface, he describes &quot;Barometer Rising&quot; as &quot;a major weather sign in the history of Canadian writing&quot;, which spurred the most productive period in Canadian writing.

==Potential movie==
Crawley Films Limited of Ottawa bought the film rights to &quot;Barometer Rising&quot; by February 1962 with the intent of making a main-feature movie.

<text>Duncan Cowan Ferguson (born 27 December 1971) is a Scottish football coach and former player who was most recently the manager of Scottish League One club Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

He began his career at Dundee United in 1990, and moved to Rangers in 1993 for what was then a British transfer record fee. He spent the remainder of his career in England, moving to Everton in 1994 before a stint with Newcastle United between 1998 and 2000, after which he returned to Everton, where he retired in 2006.

During his career, Ferguson won the FA Cup with Everton in 1995. He was capped for Scotland seven times, playing at UEFA Euro 1992, but made himself unavailable for selection for the national team from 1997 due to a dispute with the Scottish Football Association (SFA). He has scored more goals than any other Scottish player in England&#x27;s Premier League since its creation in 1992.

Ferguson&#x27;s aggressive style of play resulted in a career total of nine red cards, as well as a three-month prison sentence following an on-field assault of Raith Rovers&#x27; John McStay in 1994. Eight of those red cards were in the English Premier League, where he holds the joint record for dismissals alongside Patrick Vieira and Richard Dunne. He is known by the nicknames &quot;Big Dunc&quot; and &quot;Duncan Disorderly&quot;.

Ferguson was promoted to the first-team coaching staff at Everton in 2014. Following the dismissal of Everton manager Marco Silva in December 2019, he was named as the team&#x27;s caretaker manager until Silva&#x27;s replacement Carlo Ancelotti was appointed manager a few weeks later, at which point Ferguson was made assistant manager. Ferguson left Everton after a second stint as caretaker manager in 2022. After a brief spell as Forest Green Rovers manager, he was appointed manager of Inverness Caledonian Thistle in September 2023 and was sacked when the club went into administration in October 2024.

==Club career==
===Dundee United===
Born in Stirling, Ferguson played for the juvenile side Carse Thistle. Dundee United signed him as a schoolboy, and he went on to win the BP Youth Cup in 1990. Later that year, on 10 November, Ferguson made his professional debut for them against Rangers at Ibrox Stadium. His first goal was an extra-time winner against East Fife in the Scottish Cup on 29 January 1991.

The following season saw him become a first-team regular. With 41 appearances and 16 goals, he became the club&#x27;s top scorer. His good form continued in 1992–93 with 33 appearances and 15 goals. The form he displayed at Dundee United also saw him win a call-up to the Scotland national team.

===Rangers===

Ferguson moved to Rangers in 1993 for a transfer fee of £4 million, which set a new British record. During a match with Raith Rovers in April 1994, Ferguson headbutted the visitors&#x27; John McStay in the south-west corner of the Ibrox pitch. Referee Kenny Clark did not see the incident, but Ferguson was subsequently charged and found guilty of assault. As it was his third conviction for assault, he received a three-month prison sentence in October 1995. The SFA banned Ferguson for 12 matches before the court case was heard.

Ferguson scored a last-minute winner against Motherwell, from a Brian Laudrup pass, in the first game of the season. Four days later, he scored a hat-trick in a 6–1 win over Arbroath. 

Of Ferguson&#x27;s time at Rangers, one of his strike partners Mark Hateley said: &quot;Duncan was a really good player, but I think he came to Rangers a couple of years too early. Walter Smith wanted me to take him under my wing. He was a boisterous young lad who wanted to play all the time. It was a period in his career where he&#x27;d gone from being a big fish in a small pond to being a small fish in the big pond at Rangers. He probably found that a bit difficult.&quot;

===Everton===
In October 1994, Everton were struggling under the management of Mike Walker and looking for options to reinvigorate their faltering season. The solution enacted was to take two Rangers players on a loan deal, Ian Durrant for one month and Ferguson for three. Ferguson&#x27;s move to Everton was later made permanent by Walker&#x27;s successor Joe Royle, and Ferguson played a key role in saving Everton from relegation, and also helping them win the 1994–95 FA Cup. The subsequent 1995–96 season was less successful for Ferguson. A persistent hernia problem caused him to be unavailable for large amounts of time, as did his prison sentence during the first half of the season.

On 28 December 1997, Ferguson scored a hat-trick against Bolton Wanderers in a 3–2 victory, the first time that a trio of headers had been scored in the Premier League. Everton finished the season surviving relegation only on goal difference.

Ferguson was sold to Newcastle United for a fee of £8 million in November 1998. The deal was done to sell Ferguson by the Everton chairman, Peter Johnson, without the knowledge of Walter Smith. Ferguson wrote a two-page goodbye letter in the club magazine to fans, stating his sadness at leaving and that he would never forget them.

===Newcastle United===
After bringing Ferguson to Newcastle, manager Ruud Gullit was rewarded when Ferguson scored twice on his debut against Wimbledon in the Premier League. The final result was a 3–1 victory to Newcastle. At the start of 1999, Ferguson suffered a hernia injury, meaning that he played only seven times in the 1998–99 season. He made his comeback on 11 April, coming on as a substitute in a 2–0 extra-time FA Cup semi-final win over Tottenham Hotspur, and did the same in the 1999 FA Cup Final, which Newcastle lost to Manchester United.

In 1999–2000, Ferguson scored in three rounds of the FA Cup as Newcastle beat Tottenham 6–1, Sheffield United 4–1 and Tranmere Rovers 3–2, before a semi-final elimination by Chelsea. He scored six league goals, including two in a 5–0 home win over Southampton on 16 January 2000.

===Return to Everton===

On 17 August 2000, Ferguson moved back to Everton for a fee of £3.75 million. The transfer had previously been close to collapse as he sought a £1 million &quot;loyalty payment&quot; from Newcastle for not personally asking for a transfer; he had made the same amount of money from Everton when he transferred in 1998 on the same basis. Two days after signing, he played his first game in a 2–0 loss at Leeds United, coming on for Stephen Hughes after 56 minutes. On 23 August, on his return to Goodison Park, he scored twice in a 3–0 win over Charlton Athletic after coming on for Mark Hughes in the 67th minute.

On 1 April 2002, Ferguson was sent off after 20 minutes for elbowing Bolton Wanderers&#x27; Kostas Konstantinidis in an off-the-ball incident in a 3–1 win for a struggling Everton side.

In August 2003, Jamie Jackson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called Ferguson &quot;arguably the biggest waste of money of all&quot;, citing his high transfer fees and wages compared to his injury record and age. By that point, he had scored 12 times in 41 games in three years at Everton, while earning over £5 million in salary. His 192 minutes of play in 2002–03 as a goalless substitute cost the club £9,000 per minute.

Ferguson was accused of racial abuse by Fulham&#x27;s Luís Boa Morte after an FA Cup fourth round match in January 2004. The accusation was dismissed by the Football Association, who found insufficient evidence. On 28 December that year, Ferguson came on for Marcus Bent in the 74th minute of Everton&#x27;s 2–0 loss at Charlton, and within ten minutes he was sent off for an elbow on Hermann Hreiðarsson.

During the 2005–06 season, Ferguson was sent off against Wigan Athletic for violent conduct. His confrontation with Paul Scharner and subsequent fracas with Pascal Chimbonda resulted in a seven-match ban and his eighth Premier League red card, equalling Patrick Vieira&#x27;s record. On 7 May 2006, against West Bromwich Albion at Goodison Park, Ferguson was named captain in the game that marked the end of his Everton career. His 90th-minute penalty kick was saved by Tomasz Kuszczak, but he subsequently scored from the rebound, netting his final goal for the club. Ferguson was not given a new Everton deal and retired, moving his family to Mallorca and spurning advances from a number of clubs.

Ferguson played for Everton in a testimonial match in his honour on 2 August 2015 against Villarreal.

==International career==
Ferguson made his first full international appearance for Scotland on 17 May 1992, in a 1–0 win over the United States in Denver. He was selected for UEFA Euro 1992 in Sweden, making one substitute appearance against reigning champions the Netherlands on 12 June. He withdrew from UEFA Euro 1996 in England due to surgery on a recurring hernia. He made seven Scotland appearances in all, with his last appearance coming in February 1997.

Ferguson refused international selection after 1997, partly in protest against his treatment by the SFA after his conviction for assault on John McStay and in particular the imposition of a 12-game ban on top of his three-month prison sentence. Ferguson believed that second punishment violated the principle of double jeopardy. Speaking in February 2023, Ferguson said that not playing more for Scotland was the &quot;biggest regret in my career&quot;. He also revealed that Scotland managers had repeatedly asked him to come out of retirement, with the last request coming from Walter Smith in 2005. Ferguson blamed his own &quot;pig-headedness&quot; for not accepting those invitations.

==Coaching career==
===Everton===

Having spent five years in Mallorca following his retirement from playing, Ferguson contacted his former manager at Everton, David Moyes. Ferguson asked if he could work with the Everton academy students at Finch Farm.

Initially Ferguson was a voluntary worker at the academy, working for Alan Irvine, a former mentor of his from his playing career. Although Ferguson remains disappointed with the Scottish FA for what he sees as a lack of support following his sentencing in 1995, he enrolled on a nine-day Scottish FA organised coaching course in Largs, Scotland to earn a UEFA B-Licence. In May 2012, he returned to Largs to achieve a UEFA A licence and in January 2013 he enrolled on a further course for the UEFA Pro Licence. In February 2014 Ferguson was promoted to the first-team coaching staff at Everton. His first game in the role was a home game against West Ham United on 1 March 2014.

Following the dismissal of manager Marco Silva on 5 December 2019, Ferguson was named as caretaker manager of Everton. In his first game in charge two days later, Everton beat Chelsea 3–1 to lift themselves out of the relegation zone. Following the appointment of Carlo Ancelotti as the new manager later that month, Ferguson was made assistant manager, a role he retained under Rafael Benítez who joined the club following Ancelotti&#x27;s departure to Real Madrid in June 2021.

On 18 January 2022, Ferguson was again appointed caretaker manager following the sacking of Benítez. He oversaw one game as caretaker, a 1–0 home loss to Aston Villa, before Frank Lampard was appointed as the new manager. Ferguson remained at the club for the rest of the season as a first-team coach, before announcing his departure from the club in July 2022.

===Forest Green Rovers===
On 26 January 2023, Ferguson was appointed head coach of League One side Forest Green Rovers, his first managerial role of his career.

Upon his appointment, Ferguson stated; &quot;I&#x27;m really delighted to join FGR for the next step of my career, and I plan to be here for a while. We have a bit of a fight on our hands to stay up in League One and I am ready for the challenge.&quot; Dale Vince, Chairman of the club, commented: &quot;We&#x27;re all excited to welcome Duncan, he is someone I have admired from afar for a while. It&#x27;s just fantastic to have the opportunity to work with him in this next phase of our journey toward the Championship.&quot; Ferguson did not win a game as manager until 26 March when Forest Green beat second-placed Sheffield Wednesday 1–0. Forest Green were relegated to League Two on 15 April after a 5–1 home defeat to Barnsley. With four games remaining in the season, they became the first team in any EFL league to be relegated in the 2022–23 season. He left the club on 4 July 2023. During his 18 games in charge, Forest Green Rovers won only a single game.

===Inverness Caledonian Thistle===
Ferguson was appointed manager of Scottish Championship club Inverness Caledonian Thistle on 26 September 2023; at the time of his appointment, the club was bottom of the league.
Returning to Scottish football after an absence of 29 years, his first game as manager of Inverness Caledonian Thistle was on 30 September, a 3–2 away win against Arbroath. The club were relegated after a 5–3 aggregate defeat to Hamilton Academical. On 3 October 2024, Ferguson admitted to working with no salary to help the club through its financial crisis. On 23 October 2024, he was sacked after the club was put into administration the previous day.

==Personal life==

Ferguson&#x27;s son Cameron is also a professional footballer who plays for Connah&#x27;s Quay Nomads. He has represented Scotland at Youth level.

===Burglary attempts at his homes===
In 2001, two burglars broke into Ferguson&#x27;s home in Rufford, Lancashire. Ferguson confronted them and was able to detain one of them, who subsequently spent three days in hospital. The second man managed to flee but was eventually caught. Both men were sentenced to 15 months&#x27; imprisonment for their actions.

In January 2003, Ferguson caught another burglar at his home in Formby, Merseyside; the burglar attacked Ferguson, who retaliated. The burglar was hospitalised and later alleged that Ferguson had assaulted him, but this was dismissed by police.

===Convictions for physical altercations===
Ferguson has had four convictions for assault – two arising from taxi rank scuffles, one an altercation with a fisherman in an Anstruther pub, and one for his on-field headbutt on Raith Rovers defender John McStay in 1994 while playing for Rangers, which resulted in a rare conviction for an on-the-field incident.

The first incident led to a £100 fine for headbutting a policeman and a £25 fine for a Breach of the Peace, while the second resulted in a £200 fine for punching and kicking a supporter on crutches. He was sentenced to a year&#x27;s probation for the third offence. For the 1994 on-the-field headbutting, he received and served a three-month jail term for assault. Ferguson&#x27;s troubles with the law and his imprisonment inspired Finnish composer Osmo Tapio Räihälä to write a symphonic poem as a &quot;musical portrait&quot; of Ferguson, titled &quot;Barlinnie Nine&quot;.

===Campaigning===
In 2009 Ferguson pledged his support to the &quot;Keep Everton in Our City&quot; campaign, saying:

<doc id="848409" wikidata="Q311324" url="?curid=848409" title="Thomas Gravesen">
<text>Thomas Gravesen (; born 11 March 1976) is a Danish former professional footballer who played as a midfielder.

Gravesen played as a professional in Denmark, Germany, England, Spain and Scotland for Vejle Boldklub, Hamburger SV, Everton, Real Madrid and Celtic.

For the Denmark national team, Gravesen was capped 66 times and scored five goals, from his debut in August 1998 until he ended his national team career in September 2006. He represented Denmark at the international Euro 2000, 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004 tournaments.

He is the older brother of footballer Peter Gravesen.

==Club career==
===Vejle Boldklub===
Born in Vejle, Gravesen began his career in 1995 with hometown club Vejle Boldklub (VB) in the Danish Superliga, alongside a handful of youths making it through the VB youth scheme, including good friend Kaspar Dalgas. At VB he played as sweeper and defensive midfielder, and after he won silver medals in the 1996–97 Superliga season he moved to German team Hamburger SV in 1997.

Gravesen made a total of 94 appearances and six goals in three years with HSV.

===Everton===
Following the Euro 2000 tournament, Gravesen went to English club Everton and quickly became a favourite amongst the fans. Gravesen played a key role in Everton&#x27;s rise toward the top of the 2004–05 Premier League table. With his contract due to expire in the summer of 2005, which would enable him to leave on a free transfer, Everton sold Gravesen to Real Madrid in January 2005 for a surprisingly low fee of £2.5 million.

===Real Madrid===
Gravesen was signed to fill a hole in Madrid&#x27;s defensive midfield, a position somewhat different from his role at Everton. He found immediate playing success at Real Madrid, scoring in one of his first games, a 4–0 win against Espanyol. However, Gravesen would eventually find himself benched. Following public outcry over his tough style of play and the sacking of Real coach Vanderlei Luxemburgo and sporting director Arrigo Sacchi, who were in charge of acquiring Gravesen, he looked ready to leave Real Madrid in the winter transfer window of 2006. However, new coach López Caro would revive Gravesen&#x27;s career at Real, picking him regularly, using him in the holding role in the new 4–1–4–1 formation Real adopted. Towards the end of the season, Gravesen once again found himself out of the team, and in May 2006 a number of clubs were reported to be interested in him.

In August 2006, a scuffle erupted at a Real Madrid training session following a hard tackle by Gravesen on teammate Robinho. Fabio Capello, the former Real Madrid manager, said about Gravesen: &quot;The way he is, we won&#x27;t have problems with him. He&#x27;s just a little bit peculiar. I don&#x27;t mess with him, he works well tactically. His behaviour is like this, and I don&#x27;t like it, everything has to be done like he wants it to be done&quot;. Gravesen looked likely to leave Real Madrid before the start of the 2006–07 season, with his agent John Sivebæk confirming that a number of clubs – including Newcastle United in England and Scottish club Celtic – were interested in signing the midfielder.

===Celtic===
On 28 August 2006, Gravesen attended Celtic Park in Glasgow for a medical examination and, on 30 August, signed a three-year deal (with the option of a fourth) with the club, for a speculated fee of around £2 million. There was a period of uncertainty as to whether Gravesen would sign for Celtic after false rumours arose of a failed medical and of an eleventh-hour bid by Newcastle.

He scored his first goal for Celtic against arch rivals Rangers on 23 September 2006. He then went on to score the first hat-trick of his professional career when Celtic won 3–1 against St Mirren on 12 November. After a promising start to his Celtic career, Gravesen was replaced in the starting line-up by Dutch midfielder Evander Sno. In April 2007, Celtic manager Gordon Strachan denied rumours that Gravesen would leave the club to play for English club Sunderland, but in May 2007 he declared his disappointment that Gravesen did not work harder to recapture his place in the starting line-up.

On 18 August 2008, Celtic and Gravesen parted company.

===Loan to Everton===
Gravesen re-signed for Everton on a season-long loan from Celtic on 29 August 2007. On his first game back for Everton, as a second-half substitute in the 2–1 win at Bolton Wanderers, he took the corner that Joleon Lescott headed the winner from. In his first European appearance of the season, in Everton&#x27;s 3–1 victory over Larissa at Goodison Park in the UEFA Cup group stage, Gravesen set up Everton&#x27;s third goal, scored by Victor Anichebe. However, Gravesen failed to make as big an impact as many Everton fans had hoped. A rare highlight was scoring a penalty in the shootout following the UEFA Cup match against Fiorentina, although Everton would go on to lose the shootout when Phil Jagielka missed the crucial spot-kick. After the last game of the 2007–08 season, manager David Moyes confirmed that Gravesen&#x27;s contract would not be renewed and he would be returning to Celtic.

===Retirement===
On 27 January 2009, Gravesen announced his retirement from professional football after he failed to find a new club after being released by Celtic. On 12 September 2009, he stated in an interview with FourFourTwo that he had been approached by a number of clubs about a possible return to football, but nothing came of these approaches.

It was reported in December 2013 that Gravesen had been successful with investments and was living in Las Vegas.

==International career==
Gravesen debuted for the Danish national team in a 0–1 friendly match loss to the Czech Republic on 19 August 1998. Gravesen was selected to play for Denmark at the 2000 European Championship (Euro 2000) by coach Bo Johansson, despite concern from Johansson that he was not &quot;psychologically stable&quot; enough.

While at Everton, new Danish national team coach Morten Olsen fully supported Gravesen and made him one of his pivotal players in the 2002 World Cup and Euro 2004 campaigns. His display in the 2002 World Cup qualifying game with Iceland, where Gravesen scored two goals in a 6–0 win, was so impressive that American boxer Mike Tyson asked for his shirt and wore it throughout his stay in Denmark. He played all four of Denmark&#x27;s matches at the 2002 World Cup, though Gravesen and his partner in the Danish midfield duo, Stig Tøfting, justified their pit bull reputations when they ganged up to play a prank on teammate Jesper Grønkjær at a World Cup training session.

He missed the first group match at Euro 2004 as he was suspended due to a sending off in the last qualifying match before the tournament but he played the remaining three games before Denmark were eliminated.

On 15 September 2006, Gravesen announced his decision to end his international career, deciding now to focus his efforts solely on Celtic.

==Personal life==
Gravesen previously dated Danish adult film star Kira Eggers. He now lives in a gated community in Los Angeles, with Andre Agassi and Nicolas Cage as two of his neighbours.

<doc id="848414" wikidata="Q7592761" url="?curid=848414" title="St Catherine's Court">
<text>St Catherine&#x27;s Court is a manor house in a secluded valley north of Bath, Somerset, England. It is a Grade I listed property. The gardens are Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England.

The original house was a priory grange for the monks of Bath Abbey adjacent to the Church of St Catherine. At the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the manor was granted to John Malte and passed down to the courtier John Harington. It was bought in 1591 by John Blanchard and housed his descendants for generations, but the property fell into disrepair. In the 19th century, the house was bought by Colonel Joseph Holden Strutt who renovated it, with the work being continued by his sons. In 1984, actress Jane Seymour bought the house and carried out further renovation. During her ownership, the property was used as a recording studio and party venue, which caused complaints among the neighbours. It has since been further extended and is now rented out as a wedding venue.

The fabric of the building has changed over the centuries with a two-storey porch being added in 1610. Further extensions were added in the early 19th century, and the orangery and library were added in the early 20th century. In the 21st century, another addition including a swimming pool was added. The house is surrounded by of landscaped grounds with terraces joined by flights of steps. The barn within the grounds is from the 13th to 15th centuries.

==History==

The manor of St Catherine belonged to Prior Cantlow of Bath Abbey in medieval times. It takes its name from the Church of St Catherine beside the manor house. When the house was not occupied by the monks, it was leased. In 1536, the lease was to Thomas Llewellyn, who remained as the tenant after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Henry VIII granted the manor to his tailor, John Malte, in 1546. Part of the condition of the gift was that he adopt the king&#x27;s illegitimate daughter Ethelreda Malte. Ethelreda inherited the house and married John Harington. After Ethelreda&#x27;s death in 1551, Harrington married again. His son from this marriage was another John Harington who grew up and became a courtier of Elizabeth I and invented the first flush toilet. He spent most of his time at his principle seat at nearby Kelston and, in 1591, sold St Catherine&#x27;s Court to John Blanchard. His son, William Blanchard, remodelled the house. His initials appear in the plasterwork frieze of a bedroom. The Blanchard family lived at the court for several generations. In 1610, the porch was added and a terraced garden laid out. The house passed by marriage to the Parry family but was not maintained, and the fabric of the building was declining by the 18th century, when half of the building was used by a tenant farmer.

The house was bought by Colonel Joseph Holden Strutt, a British soldier and long-standing Member of Parliament. He renovated the house and neighbouring church. He extended the house before his death in 1845. His youngest daughter Charlotte Olivia inherited the house and lived there with her husband, the Reverend Robert Drummond, until her death in 1897. In 1912, it was inherited by Richard Strutt, the youngest son of the second Baron Rayleigh. Richard Strutt added an orangery and built the library based on designs by Charles Bateman. In addition, he joined the ruined chapel near the gate to the rest of the house. The house was then inherited by his son, John Strutt.
In 1984, actress Jane Seymour bought the house with her then husband David Flynn for £350,000. After spending £3 million on refurbishments, they undertook renovation of the house. They brought purchased furniture from Littlecote House, owned by Sir Seton Wills, as he was selling his house and there was little furniture at St Catherine&#x27;s. Seymour spent summers at the house. After her divorce from Flynn and marriage to American film producer James Keach, Seymour rented out the manor as a film set, recording studio and latterly country house estate/hotel for corporate events and weddings. The English band The Cure recorded their album &quot;Wild Mood Swings&quot; there in 1994 and 1995. The band came back in the autumn of 1998 to record most of their 2000 album &quot;Bloodflowers&quot;. Radiohead recorded most of their 1997 album &quot;OK Computer&quot; there. New Order also recorded part of their 2005 album &quot;Waiting for the Sirens&#x27; Call&quot; and the unreleased 2013 track &quot;Lost Sirens&quot; at St Catherine&#x27;s Court. The property was also rented by Robbie Williams, as seen in the first episode of MTV Cribs. In May 2007, Seymour was granted a 24-hour alcohol and entertainment licence under new UK regulations, by Bath and North East Somerset council. Neighbours complained that the access lane was too narrow and the noise excessive. Seymour won the court battle, but sold the house in November 2007 to an unknown buyer. In 2009, a planning application for a two-storey extension, including a swimming pool was submitted to the local council. This was on the site of a previous orchard from which the trees were transplanted. The house is now available for catered rental and weddings.

==Architecture==

The oldest part of the house, the north front, was built in the Elizabethan era but incorporates parts of the earlier priory grange on the site. The front has sloping gables which reduce the load on the walls beneath them. The porch which was added in 1610 has tuscan columns supporting a balustrade with a statue of &quot;Bungey&quot;, a favourite spaniel of John Harrington. It leads into a passage and the &quot;oak room&quot; which has wooden panelling with a moulded ceiling and 17th century fireplace. Similar features can be found in the hall and dining room. The ceiling of the library is an imitation of that at Audley End House, while the woodwork is mostly Jacobean. The staircase to the bedrooms incorporates the base of a tree trunk growing under the house.

The gardens and grounds and laid out in terraces and include a paved court with an octagonal pool and separate areas enclosed by clipped yew hedges. More recent landscaping to the south of the house is in an Italianate style with pergolas. The barn within the grounds was probably built between the 13th and 15th centuries. In 2008 proposals were submitted to turn the barn into offices and a workshop.

Many of the walls and structures within the gardens, such as the central flight of steps, were built in the late 17th century. The gatepiers and flanking walls north east of the house were added in the mid 19th century. The gardens are Grade II* listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens of special historic interest in England.

<text>William Ralph &quot;Dixie&quot; Dean (22 January 1907 – 1 March 1980) was an English footballer who played as a centre forward. Dean holds the record for the most goals scored in a single season in top-flight English football, with 60. He is regarded as one of the greatest centre-forwards of all time and was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in 2002.

Born in Birkenhead, he began his career at his hometown club Tranmere Rovers before moving on to Everton, the club he had supported as a child. A prolific goalscorer, he was particularly known for having a penchant for scoring goals with his head, courtesy of his elevation and athleticism, as well as his powerful and accurate heading ability, which has led pundits to describe him as one of the greatest aerial specialists of all time. Dean played the majority of his career at Everton before injuries caught up with him and he moved on to new challenges at Notts County, and eventually Sligo Rovers.

In Everton&#x27;s league championship-winning season of 1927-28, Dean scored a record 60 league goals (out of the team&#x27;s 102), having played in 39 of Everton&#x27;s 42 games. That season, he also made his debut for England: he went on to score eighteen goals in sixteen appearances for his country.

A statue of Dean was unveiled outside Goodison Park in May 2001. A year later, he became one of 22 players inducted into the inaugural English Football Hall of Fame.

==Early years==
Dean was born at 313 Laird Street in Birkenhead, Cheshire, across the River Mersey from Liverpool. Dean&#x27;s family on both sides hailed from Chester. He was the grandson of Ralph Brett, a train driver who drove the royal train during the reign of George V. Dean grew up as a supporter of Everton thanks to the efforts of his father, William Sr., who took him to a match during the 1914–1915 title-winning season.

Dean&#x27;s childhood coincided with the First World War, and between the ages of seven and eleven he delivered cow&#x27;s milk to local families as part of the war effort: &quot;Well, it was war time you see, so you were grafting all the time. I used to take milk out. I&#x27;d be up at half-past four in the morning and go down and get the ponies and the milk floats, then I&#x27;d come out to this place in Upton, between Upton and Arrowe Park, and Burgess&#x27; Farm was there. We used to collect the milk in the big urns and take it out to people&#x27;s houses, serving it out of the ladle. And not only that, you had an allotment, and that was in school time. And there was no such thing as pinching and stealing and all that bloody caper. In those days, you were growing all that stuff and you needed it for the war time.&quot;

Dean attended Laird Street School but felt he received no formal education: &quot;My only lesson was football ... I used to give the pens out on Friday afternoons ... the ink, and the chalks. That was the only job I had in school ... I never had any lessons.&quot; When he turned eleven he attended Albert (Memorial) Industrial School, a borstal school in Birkenhead, because of the football facilities on offer. The Dean family home had little room for him due to the family&#x27;s size; Dean was happy with the arrangement, since he could play on the school&#x27;s football team. Dean falsely told fellow pupils he had been caught stealing, since he wanted to be &quot;one of the boys&quot;.

He left school at fourteen and worked for Wirral Railway as an apprentice fitter; his father also worked there and had been working since he was eleven years old for Great Western Railway. The elder Dean later became a train driver before moving to Birkenhead to work for Wirral Railway, to be closer to his future wife (and William Jr.&#x27;s mother) Sarah. Dean&#x27;s father would later retire with the company.

Dean took a night job so that he could concentrate on his first love, football: &quot;The other two apprentice fitters, they didn&#x27;t like the night job because there were too many bloody rats around there, coming out of the Anglo-Oil company and the Vacuum Oil Company  ... rats as big as whippets. So I took their night job, and of course, I could always have a game of football then.&quot; Dean would kick the trespassing rats against the wall.

The sons of Dean&#x27;s manager at Wirral Railway were directors of New Brighton, and they were interested in signing Dean. However, Dean told the club he was not interested in signing and instead played for local team Pensby United in Pensby. It was at Pensby United where Dean attracted the attention of a Tranmere Rovers scout.

===&quot;Dixie&quot; nickname===
Some said that Dean and his family disliked his nickname, and preferred people to call him &quot;Bill&quot; or &quot;Billy&quot;. The popular theory regarding how Dean acquired his nickname is that he did so in his youth, perhaps due to his dark complexion and hair (which bore a resemblance to people from the Southern United States). In Dean&#x27;s obituary in &quot;The Times&quot;, Geoffrey Green suggested that the nickname was taken from a &quot;Dixie&quot; song that was popular during Dean&#x27;s childhood; there was &quot;something of the Uncle Tom about his features&quot;.

Alternatively, Tranmere Rovers club historian Gilbert Upton uncovered evidence, verified by Dean&#x27;s Godmother, that the name &quot;Dixie&quot; was a corruption of his childhood nickname, Digsy (acquired from his approach to the children&#x27;s game of tag, where Dean would dig his fist into a girl&#x27;s back, hence &quot;Digsy&quot;).

==Club career==

===Tranmere Rovers===
He played football for Laird Street School, Moreton Bible Class, Heswall and Pensby United. He then joined the professional ranks with his local club, Tranmere Rovers in November 1923. He was sixteen at the time.

Whilst at Tranmere, he was on the receiving end of a tough challenge which resulted in him losing a testicle in a reserve game against Altrincham. Immediately following the challenge, a teammate rubbed the area to ease the pain. Dean shouted, &quot;Don&#x27;t rub &#x27;em, count &#x27;em!&quot;

In his sixteen months at Tranmere, spanning seasons 1923/24 and 1924/25, he scored 27 goals in 30 league appearances. All 27 were in the second of those two seasons in which he averaged exactly a goal per game. His exploits attracted the interest of many clubs across England, including Arsenal and Newcastle United. Upon leaving Tranmere Rovers, secretary Bert Cooke reneged on an agreement to pay ten percent of the transfer fee to Dean. Dean was paid one percent of the fee, which he gave to his parents (who donated it to Birkenhead General Hospital).

===Everton===
His father had taken him to a league game at Goodison Park when he was eight years old. It was a dream come true for Dean when Everton secretary Thomas H. McIntosh arranged to meet him at the Woodside Hotel in 1925. Dean was so excited that he ran the distance from his home in north Birkenhead to the riverside to meet him. He signed for Everton in March 1925, having just turned eighteen.

He later revealed that he expected a £300 signing fee to be given to his parents when he transferred to Everton. They received only £30, and Tranmere Rovers manager Bert Cooke told him &quot;That&#x27;s all the League will allow&quot;. Dean appealed to John McKenna, chairman of the Football Association, but was told &quot;I&#x27;m afraid you&#x27;ve signed, and that&#x27;s it.&quot; Dean signed for Everton in March 1925 for £3,000, then a record fee received for any Third Division player, any 18-year old, and any Tranmere Rovers player. He made his debut away to Arsenal, and scored his first Everton goal later that month, at home to Aston Villa. He scored 32 goals in his first full season, 1925–26, benefiting from a change to the offside law. A motorcycling accident at Holywell in north Wales in summer 1926 left Dean with a fractured skull and jaw, and doctors were unsure whether he would be able to play again. In his next game for Everton he scored using his head, leading Evertonians to joke that the doctor left a metal plate in Dean&#x27;s head. He re-joined the first team in October 1926, scoring in his first game back, away to Leeds United. Dean finished the 1926–27 season with 21 goals from 27 games as Everton avoided relegation by a single place.

Dean&#x27;s greatest point of note is that he is still the only player in English football to score 60 league goals in one season (1927–28). At that season&#x27;s end he was 21 years old. Middlesbrough&#x27;s George Camsell, who holds the highest goals-to-games ratio for England, had scored 59 league goals the previous season, although this was in the Second Division.

In that 1927–28 season Everton won the First Division title. When they were relegated to Second Division in 1930 Dean stayed with them. The club went on to immediately win the Second Division in 1931, followed by the First Division again in 1932. They then immediately won the FA Cup in 1933 (in which he scored in the final) – a sequence unmatched since.

In December 1933, Dean issued a public appeal to have stolen goods returned to him. &quot;The Times&quot; issued a statement: &quot;Dixie Dean, the Everton and England forward appeals to the thief who robbed him of an international cap and presentation clock to return them. His house in Caldy Road, Walton, Liverpool was entered in his absence over Christmas, and the thief left behind gold watches and jewellery (sic).&quot; By then, Dean was captain of the side. However, the harsh physical demands of the game (as it was played then) took their toll and he was dropped from the first team in 1937.

Dean&#x27;s 310 First Division goals for Everton remain as the record for most goals for a single club in English football&#x27;s top tier.

===Later teams===
Dean went on to play for Notts County for one season, in which he scored three goals in nine games. At age 32, Dean signed for Irish team Sligo Rovers in January 1939 to help the club in their FAI Cup campaign. On his arrival, the railway station in Sligo was said to be filled with locals trying to catch a glimpse of him. Dean scored ten goals in seven games for the club, including five in a 7–1 win over Waterford (which remains a club record for the most goals scored in a single game). He also played in four Cup matches, scoring once (in the 1–1 final against Shelbourne, who won the replay 1–0). Dean&#x27;s runner-up medal was later stolen from his hotel room; on a return trip to Ireland to watch Rovers 39 years later in the 1978 FAI Cup final, a package was delivered to his hotel room with the medal inside. He is considered a legend at The Showgrounds and is featured in the club&#x27;s outdoor museum.

Dean ended his professional playing days with Hurst (now Ashton United) in the Cheshire County League 1939–40 season, managing two games and one goal before the outbreak of war ended his career. He made his debut in a 4–0 loss to Stalybridge Celtic; 5,600 people attended the game, paying sixpence, earning the club gate receipts of £140.

==International career==
Dean made his debut for the England national football team against British rivals Wales at the Racecourse Ground in Wrexham in February 1927, less than a month after his 20th birthday. His final game for England came in a 1–0 victory over Ireland in October 1932 at Blackpool&#x27;s Bloomfield Road, when Dean was 25 years old.

Dean was involved in the 1927 and 1929 editions of the British Home Championship. During the 1927 edition, Dean scored four goals in his two games for England and scored twice against Scotland at Hampden Park. Despite the loss, the Scots won the competition overall and applauded Dean (who finished the tournament as top scorer). In the 1929 edition, he scored in his only outing against Ireland at Goodison Park.

The only international competitions outside the British Home Championship during Dean&#x27;s international career were the 1928 and 1936 Olympic Games and the inaugural FIFA World Cup, which took place in 1930; however, neither Great Britain nor England participated. Dean represented England sixteen times, scoring eighteen goals in nine games (including hat-tricks against Belgium and Luxembourg).

==Later life and death==
Dean became a Freemason in 1931 while playing for Everton and England. He was initiated in Randle Holme Lodge, No. 3261, in Birkenhead on 18 February 1931. After retiring, he went on to run the Dublin Packet pub in Chester (Everton and the Dublin Packet commemorate this with memorabilia) and work at Littlewoods football pools as a porter at their Walton Hall Avenue offices, where he was remembered by fellow workers as a quiet, unassuming man.

In January 1972, Dean was admitted to St Catherine&#x27;s hospital in Birkenhead suffering from the effects of influenza and was released a month later. In November 1976, he had his right leg amputated due to a blood clot; his health was declining, and he became increasingly housebound. Dean died on 1 March 1980 at age 73 after suffering a heart attack at Everton&#x27;s home ground Goodison Park whilst watching a match against their closest rivals, Liverpool. It was the first time that he had visited Goodison Park in several years, due to ill health. &quot;He belongs to the company of the supremely great, like Beethoven, Shakespeare and Rembrandt&quot;, said Bill Shankly. His funeral took place at St James&#x27; Church on Laird Street (the street where he was born) in Birkenhead. He was survived by his four children: William, Geoffrey, Ralph and Barbara; he outlived his wife Ethel, who died of a heart attack in 1974 after 43 years of marriage.

==Legacy==

Dean was an internationally known figure. Military records show that during the Second World War, an Italian prisoner of war was captured by British troops in the Western Desert and told his captors &quot;fuck your Winston Churchill and fuck your Dixie Dean&quot;. One of the soldiers present was Liverpool-born Patrick Connelly, who later went into show business using the pseudonym &quot;Bill Dean&quot;.

Everton arranged a testimonial for Dean on 7 April 1964. Over 34,000 people saw teams from Scotland and England, composed of players from Everton and Liverpool, compete; The &quot;Scots&quot;, with one Englishman and one Welshman, won 3–1.

The match raised £7,000 for Dean.
Dean&#x27;s 1933 FA Cup winners medal sold for £18,213 at auction in March 2001. In May 2001 local sculptor Tom Murphy created a statue of Dean, which was erected outside the Park End of Goodison Park at a cost of £75,000 with the inscription &quot;Footballer, Gentleman, Evertonian&quot;. In 2002, Dean was an inaugural inductee to the English Football Hall of Fame. There is an annual Dixie Dean award, which is given to the Merseyside player of the year; it has been won by players from his former clubs (Tranmere and Everton) and Liverpool.

When asked if he thought his record of scoring 60 goals in a season would be broken, Dean said: &quot;I think it will. But there&#x27;s only one man who&#x27;ll do it. That&#x27;s the fellow that walks on the water. I think he&#x27;s about the only one.&quot; In total, Dean scored 383 goals for Everton in 433 appearances — an exceptional strike-rate which includes 37 hat-tricks, 30 in league matches. He was known as a sporting player, never booked or sent off during his career despite rough treatment and provocation from opponents. Only Arthur Rowley has scored more English-league career goals; however, while Rowley made 619 appearances and scored 433 goals (0.70 goals per game) Dean scored 379 goals in 438 games (0.87 goals per game).

In December 1930 and again in October 1931, Dean became the first Everton player to score two hat-tricks in one month of competitive play. His record would not be equalled for nearly ninety years (Dominic Calvert-Lewin did so in September 2020).

<text>A salon is a gathering of people held by a host. These gatherings often consciously followed Horace&#x27;s definition of the aims of poetry, &quot;either to please or to educate&quot; (Latin: &quot;aut delectare aut prodesse&quot;). Salons in the tradition of the French literary and philosophical movements of the 17th and 18th centuries are still being conducted.

==Historical background==
The salon first appeared in Italy in the 16th century, then flourished in France throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. It continued to flourish in Italy throughout the 19th century. In 16th-century Italy, some brilliant circles formed in the smaller courts which resembled salons, often galvanized by the presence of a beautiful and educated patroness such as Isabella d&#x27;Este or Elisabetta Gonzaga.

Salons were an important place for the exchange of ideas. The word &quot;salon&quot; first appeared in France in 1664 (from the Italian &quot;salone&quot;, the large reception hall of Italian mansions; &quot;salone&quot; is actually the augmentative form of &quot;sala&quot;, room). Literary gatherings before this were often referred to by using the name of the room in which they occurred, like &quot;cabinet&quot;, &quot;réduit&quot;, &quot;ruelle&quot;, and &quot;alcôve&quot;. Before the end of the 17th century, these gatherings were frequently held in the bedroom (treated as a more private form of drawing room): a lady, reclining on her bed, would receive close friends who would sit on chairs or stools drawn around.

This practice may be contrasted with the greater formalities of Louis XIV&#x27;s &quot;petit lever&quot;, where all stood. &quot;Ruelle&quot;, literally meaning &quot;narrow street&quot; or &quot;lane&quot;, designates the space between a bed and the wall in a bedroom; it was used commonly to designate the gatherings of the &quot;précieuses&quot;, the intellectual and literary circles that formed around women in the first half of the 17th century. The first renowned salon in France was the Hôtel de Rambouillet not far from the Palais du Louvre in Paris, which its hostess, Roman-born Catherine de Vivonne, marquise de Rambouillet (1588–1665), ran from 1607 until her death. She established the rules of etiquette of the salon which resembled the earlier codes of Italian chivalry.

In Britain, mathematician and inventor Charles Babbage is credited with introducing the scientific soirée, a form of salon, from France. Babbage began hosting Saturday evening soirées in 1828.

== Studying the salon ==
The history of the salon is far from straightforward. The salon has been studied in depth by a mixture of feminist, Marxist, cultural, social, and intellectual historians. Each of these methodologies focuses on different aspects of the salon, and thus have varying analyses of its importance in terms of French history and the Enlightenment as a whole.

Major historiographical debates focus on the relationship between the salons and the public sphere, as well as the role of women within the salons.

Breaking down the salons into historical periods is complicated due to the various historiographical debates that surround them. Most studies stretch from the early 16th century up until around the end of the 18th century. Goodman is typical in ending her study at the French Revolution where, she writes: &#x27;the literary public sphere was transformed into the political public&#x27;. Steven Kale is relatively alone in his recent attempts to extend the period of the salon up until Revolution of 1848:A whole world of social arrangements and attitude supported the existence of French salons: an idle aristocracy, an ambitious middle class, an active intellectual life, the social density of a major urban center, sociable traditions, and a certain aristocratic feminism. This world did not disappear in 1789.In the 1920s, Gertrude Stein&#x27;s Saturday evening salons (described in Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot; and depicted fictionally in Woody Allen&#x27;s &quot;Midnight in Paris&quot;) gained notoriety for including Pablo Picasso and other twentieth-century luminaries like Alice B. Toklas.

Her contemporary Natalie Clifford Barney&#x27;s handmade dinner place setting is on display at The Brooklyn Museum. Like Stein, she was also an author and American ex-pat living in Paris at the time, hosting literary salons that were attended by Ernest Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald as well. She bought a home with an old Masonic temple in the backyard which she dubbed Temple d’Amitié, the Temple of Friendship, for private meetings with attendees of her salons.

In 2018, Barnard College professor Caroline Weber&#x27;s book “Proust&#x27;s Duchess: How Three Celebrated Women Captured the Imagination of Fin-de-Siècle Paris” was shortlisted for the Pulitzer Prize and was the first in-depth study of the three Parisian salon hostesses Proust used to create his supreme fictional character, the Duchesse de Guermantes.

== Conversation, content and the form of the salon ==
Contemporary literature about the salons is dominated by idealistic notions of politeness, civility and honesty, though whether they lived up to these standards is a matter of debate. These older texts tend to portray reasoned debates and egalitarian polite conversation. Dena Goodman contends that, rather than being leisure-based or &quot;schools of civilité&quot;, salons were at &quot;the very heart of the philosophic community&quot; and thus integral to the process of Enlightenment. In short, Goodman argues, the 17th and 18th century saw the emergence of the academic, Enlightenment salons, which came out of the aristocratic &quot;schools of civilité&quot;. Politeness, argues Goodman, took second place to academic discussion.

The period in which salons were dominant has been labeled the &quot;age of conversation&quot;. The topics of conversation within the salonsthat is, what was and was not &quot;polite&quot; to talk aboutare thus vital when trying to determine the form of the salons. The salonnières were expected, ideally, to run and moderate the conversation (See Women in the salon). There is, however, no universal agreement among historians as to what was and was not appropriate conversation. Marcel Proust &quot;insisted that politics was scrupulously avoided&quot;. Others suggested that little other than government was ever discussed. The disagreements that surround the content of discussion partly explain why the salon&#x27;s relationship with the public sphere is so heavily contested. Individuals and collections of individuals that have been of cultural significance overwhelmingly cite some form of engaged, explorative conversation regularly held with an esteemed group of acquaintances as the source of inspiration for their contributions to culture, art, literature and politics, leading some scholars to posit the salon&#x27;s influence on the public sphere as being more widespread than previously appreciated.

=== The salon and the &quot;public sphere&quot; ===
Recent historiography of the salons has been dominated by Jürgen Habermas&#x27; work, &quot;The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere&quot; (triggered largely by its translation into French in 1978, and then English in 1989), which argued that the salons were of great historical importance. Theaters of conversation and exchangesuch as the salons and the coffeehouses in Englandplayed a critical role in the emergence of what Habermas termed the &quot;public sphere&quot;, which emerged in cultural-political contrast to court society. Thus, while women retained a dominant role in the historiography of the salons, the salons received increasing amounts of study, much of it in direct response to or heavily influenced by Habermas&#x27; theory.

The most prominent defense of salons as part of the public sphere comes from Dena Goodman&#x27;s &quot;The Republic of Letters&quot;, which claims that the &quot;public sphere was structured by the salon, the press and other institutions of sociability&quot;. Goodman&#x27;s work is also credited with further emphasizing the importance of the salon in terms of French history, the Republic of Letters and the Enlightenment as a whole, and has dominated the historiography of the salons since its publication in 1994.

Habermas&#x27; dominance in salon historiography has come under criticism from some quarters, with Pekacz singling out Goodman&#x27;s &quot;Republic of Letters&quot; for particular criticism because it was written with &quot;the explicit intention of supporting [Habermas&#x27;] thesis&quot;, rather than verifying it. The theory itself, meanwhile, has been criticized for a fatal misunderstanding of the nature of salons. The main criticism of Habermas&#x27; interpretation of the salons, however, is that the salons of most influence were not part of an oppositional public sphere, and were instead an extension of court society.

This criticism stems largely from Norbert Elias&#x27; &quot;The History of Manners&quot;, in which Elias contends that the dominant concepts of the salons&quot;politesse&quot;, &quot;civilité&quot; and &quot; honnêteté&quot;were &quot;used almost as synonyms, by which the courtly people wished to designate, in a broad or narrow sense, the quality of their own behavior&#x27;. Joan Landes agrees, stating that, &quot;to some extent, the salon was merely an extension of the institutionalized court&quot; and that rather than being part of the public sphere, salons were in fact in conflict with it. Erica Harth concurs, pointing to the fact that the state &quot;appropriated the informal academy and not the salon&quot; due to the academies&#x27; &quot;tradition of dissent&quot;something that lacked in the salon. But Landes&#x27; view of the salons as a whole is independent of both Elias&#x27; and Habermas&#x27; school of thought, insofar that she views the salons as a &quot;unique institution&quot; that cannot be adequately described as part of the public sphere or court society. Others, such as Steven Kale, compromise by declaring that the public and private spheres overlapped in the salons. Antoine Lilti ascribes to a similar viewpoint, describing the salons as simply &quot;institutions within Parisian high society&quot;.

=== Debates surrounding women and the salon ===

When dealing with the salons, historians have traditionally focused upon the role of women within them. Works in the 19th and much of the 20th centuries often focused on the scandals and &quot;petty intrigues&quot; of the salons. Other works from this period focused on the more positive aspects of women in the salon. Indeed, according to Jolanta T. Pekacz, the fact women dominated history of the salons meant that study of the salons was often left to amateurs, while men concentrated on &quot;more important&quot; (and masculine) areas of the Enlightenment.

Historians tended to focus on individual salonnières, creating almost a &quot;great woman&quot; version of history that ran parallel to the Whiggish, male-dominated history identified by Herbert Butterfield. Even in 1970, works were still being produced that concentrated only on individual stories without analysing the effects of the salonnières&#x27; unique position. The integral role that women played within salons as salonnières began to receive greaterand more seriousstudy in latter parts of the 20th century, with the emergence of a distinctly feminist historiography. The salons, according to Carolyn Lougee, were distinguished by &quot;the very visible identification of women with salons&quot; and the fact that they played a positive public role in French society. General texts on the Enlightenment, such as Daniel Roche&#x27;s &quot;France in the Enlightenment&quot;, tend to agree that women were dominant within the salons, but that their influence did not extend far outside of such venues.

It was, however, Goodman&#x27;s &quot;The Republic of Letters&quot; that ignited a real debate surrounding the role of women within the salons and the Enlightenment as a whole. According to Goodman: &quot;The salonnières were not social climbers but intelligent, self-educated, and educating women who adopted and implemented the values of the Enlightenment Republic of Letters and used them to reshape the salon to their own social intellectual, and educational needs&quot;.Wealthy members of the aristocracy have always drawn to their court poets, writers and artists, usually with the lure of patronage, an aspect that sets the court apart from the salon. Another feature that distinguished the salon from the court was its absence of social hierarchy and its mixing of different social ranks and orders. In the 17th and 18th centuries, &quot;salon[s] encouraged socializing between the sexes [and] brought nobles and bourgeois together&quot;. Salons helped facilitate the breaking down of social barriers which made the development of the enlightenment salon possible. In the 18th century, under the guidance of Madame Geoffrin, Mlle de Lespinasse, and Madame Necker, the salon was transformed into an institution of Enlightenment. The enlightenment salon brought together Parisian society, the progressive philosophes who were producing the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, the Bluestockings and other intellectuals to discuss a variety of topics.

==Salonnières and their salons: the role of women==
At that time women had powerful influence over the salon. Women were the center of life in the salon and carried very important roles as regulators. They could select their guests and decide the subjects of their meetings. These subjects could be social, literary, or political topics of the time. They also served as mediators by directing the discussion.

The salon was an informal education for women, where they were able to exchange ideas, receive and give criticism, read their own works and hear the works and ideas of other intellectuals. Many ambitious women used the salon to pursue a form of higher education.

Two of the most famous 17th-century literary salons in Paris were the Hôtel de Rambouillet, established in 1607 near the Palais du Louvre by the marquise de Rambouillet, where gathered the original précieuses, and, in 1652 in Le Marais, the rival salon of Madeleine de Scudéry, a long time &quot;habituée&quot; of the Hôtel de Rambouillet. &quot;&quot;, borrowed from England&#x27;s &quot;blue-stockings,&quot; soon found itself in use upon the attending ladies, a nickname continuing to mean &quot;intellectual woman&quot; for the next three hundred years.
Paris salons of the 18th century hosted by women include the following:

* Adèle and Aurore de Bellegarde
* Madame Geoffrin
* Madame de Tencin
* Jeanne Quinault, hostess of the Bout-du-Banc
* Madame Dupin
* Constance Pipelet, later Constance de Salm following her divorce
* Françoise de Graffigny, author of &quot;Lettres d&#x27;une Péruvienne&quot;
* Julie de Lespinasse: her chief draw was d&#x27;Alembert, but &quot;though the name of M. d&#x27;Alembert may have drawn them thither, it was she alone who kept them there.&quot;
* the marquise du Deffand, the friend of Horace Walpole
* the marquise de Lambert
* the duchesse du Maine
* Madame d&#x27;Épinay
* Madame Necker, the wife of the financier Jacques Necker
* Madame de Staël, daughter of the Neckers, took over from her mother and in exile hosted the international Coppet group
* Madame Helvétius, the wife of Helvétius
* Sophie de Condorcet, wife of the mathematician and philosopher Condorcet, visited by foreign notables and French thinkers alike
* Juliette Récamier, socialite and friend of Germaine de Staël
* Madame Roland, the political salon that was the resort of the Girondists at the first stages of the Revolution
*Madame Swetchine, wife of General Swetchine
*Julie Talma, a friend of Benjamin Constant

Some 19th-century salons were more inclusive, verging on the raffish, and centered around painters and &quot;literary lions&quot; such as Madame Récamier. After the shock of the 1870 Franco-Prussian War, French aristocrats withdrew from the public eye. However, Princess Mathilde still held a salon in her mansion, rue de Courcelles, later rue de Berri. From the middle of the 19th century until the 1930s, a lady of society had to hold her &quot;day&quot;, which meant that her &quot;salon&quot; was opened for visitors in the afternoon once a week, or twice a month. Days were announced in &quot;Le Bottin Mondain&quot;. The visitor gave his visit cards to the lackey or the &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot;, and he was accepted or not. Only people who had been introduced previously could enter the &quot;salon&quot;.

Marcel Proust called up his own turn-of-the-century experience to recreate the rival salons of the fictional duchesse de Guermantes and Madame Verdurin. He experienced himself his first social life in &quot;salons&quot; such as Mme Arman de Caillavet&#x27;s one, which mixed artists and political men around Anatole France or Paul Bourget; Mme Straus&#x27; one, where the cream of the aristocracy mingled with artists and writers; or more aristocratic &quot;salons&quot; like Comtesse de Chevigné&#x27;s, Comtesse Greffulhe&#x27;s, Comtesse Jean de Castellane&#x27;s, Comtesse Aimery de La Rochefoucauld&#x27;s, etc. Some late 19th- and early 20th-century Paris salons were major centres for contemporary music, including those of Winnaretta Singer (the princesse de Polignac), and Élisabeth, comtesse Greffulhe. They were responsible for commissioning some of the greatest songs and chamber music works of Fauré, Debussy, Ravel and Poulenc.

Until the 1950s, some &quot;salons&quot; were held by ladies mixing political men and intellectuals during the IVth Republic, like Mme Abrami, or Mme Dujarric de La Rivière. The last salons in Paris were those of Marie-Laure de Noailles, with Jean Cocteau, Igor Markevitch, Salvador Dalí, etc., Marie-Blanche de Polignac (Jeanne Lanvin&#x27;s daughter) and Madeleine and Robert Perrier, with Josephine Baker, Le Corbusier, Django Reinhardt, etc.

== Salons outside France ==
Salon sociability quickly spread through Europe. In the 18th and 19th centuries, many large cities in Europe held salons along the lines of the Parisian models.

===Belgium===
Prior to the formation of Belgium, Béatrix de Cusance hosted a salon in Brussels in what was then the Spanish Netherlands in the mid-17th century. In the late 18th century, the political salon of Anne d&#x27;Yves played a role in the Brabant Revolution of 1789.

In Belgium, the 19th-century salon hosted by Constance Trotti attracted cultural figures, the Belgian aristocracy and members of the French exiled colony.

===Denmark===
In Denmark, the salon culture was adopted during the 18th century. Christine Sophie Holstein and Charlotte Schimmelman were the most notable hostesses, in the beginning and in the end of the 18th century respectively, both of whom were credited with political influence. During the Danish Golden Age in the late 18th century and early 19th century, the literary salon played a significant part in Danish culture life, notably the literary salons arranged by Friederike Brun at Sophienholm and that of Kamma Rahbek at Bakkehuset.

===Jewish culture in Central Europe===
In the German-speaking palatinates and kingdoms, the most famous were held by Jewish ladies, such as Henriette Herz, Sara Grotthuis, and Rahel Varnhagen, and in Austria in the late 18th and early 19th centuries by two prominent Jewish Patrons of the Arts: Adele Bloch-Bauer and Berta Zuckerkandl. Increasingly emancipated German-speaking Jews wanted to immerse themselves in the rich cultural life. However, individual Jews were faced with a dilemma: they faced new opportunities, but without the comfort of a secure community. For Jewish women, there was an additional issue. German society imposed the usual gender role restrictions &quot;and&quot; antisemitism, so cultivated Jewish women tapped into the cultural salon. But from 1800 on, salons performed a political and social miracle. The salon allowed Jewish women to establish a venue in their homes in which Jews and non-Jews could meet in relative equality. Like-minded people could study art, literature, philosophy or music together. This handful of educated, acculturated Jewish women could escape the restrictions of their social ghetto. Naturally the women had to be in well-connected families, either to money or to culture. In these mixed gatherings of nobles, high civil servants, writers, philosophers and artists, Jewish salonnières created a vehicle for Jewish integration, providing a context in which patrons and artists freely exchanged ideas. Henriette Lemos Herz, Fanny Mendelssohn Hensel, Dorothea Mendelssohn Schlegel, Amalie Wolf Beer and at least twelve other salonnières achieved fame and admiration.

In Spain, by María del Pilar Teresa Cayetana de Silva y Álvarez de Toledo, 13th Duchess of Alba at the end of the 18th century; and in Greece by Alexandra Mavrokordatou in the 17th century.

=== Italy ===
Italy had had an early tradition of the salon; Giovanna Dandolo became known as a patron and gatherer of artists as wife of Pasquale Malipiero, the doge in Venice in 1457–1462, and the courtesan Tullia d&#x27;Aragona held a salon already in the 16th century, and in the 17th century Rome, the abdicated Queen Christina of Sweden and the princess Colonna, Marie Mancini, rivaled as salon hostesses. In the 18th century, Aurora Sanseverino provided a forum for thinkers, poets, artists, and musicians in Naples, making her a central figure in baroque Italy.

The tradition of the literary salon continued to flourish in Italy throughout the 19th century. Naturally there were many salons with some of the most prominent being hosted by Clara Maffei in Milan, Emilia Peruzzi in Florence and Olimpia Savio in Turin. The salons attracted countless outstanding 19th-century figures including the romantic painter Francesco Hayez, composer Giuseppe Verdi and naturalist writers Giovanni Verga, Bruno Sperani and Matilde Serao. The salons served a very important function in 19th-century Italy, as they allowed young attendees to come into contact with more established figures. They also served as a method of avoiding government censorship, as a public discussion could be held in private. The golden age of the salon in Italy could be said to coincide with the pre-unification period, after which the rise of the newspaper replaced the salon as the main place for the Italian public to engage in the room of sex.

===Latin America===
Argentina&#x27;s most active female figure in the revolutionary process, Mariquita Sánchez, was Buenos Aires&#x27; leading &quot;salonnière&quot;. She fervently embraced the cause of revolution, and her &quot;tertulia&quot; gathered all the leading personalities of her time. The most sensitive issues were discussed there, as well as literary topics. Mariquita Sánchez is widely remembered in the Argentine historical tradition because the Argentine National Anthem was sung for the first time in her house, on 14 May 1813. Other notable &quot;salonnières&quot; in colonial Buenos Aires were Mercedes de Lasalde Riglos and Flora Azcuénaga. Along with Mariquita Sánchez, the discussions at her houses led up to the May Revolution, the first stage in the struggle for Argentine independence from Spain.

===Poland-Lithuania===
In the vast Commonwealth of Poland-Lithuania, Duchess Elżbieta Sieniawska held a salon at the end of the 17th century. They became very popular there throughout the 18th century. Most renowned were the &quot;Thursday Lunches&quot; of King Stanisław II Augustus at the end of the 18th century, and among the most notable &quot;salonnières&quot; were Barbara Sanguszko, Zofia Lubomirska, Anna Jabłonowska, a noted early scientist and collector of scientific objects and books, Izabela Czartoryska, and her later namesake, Princess Izabela Czartoryska founder of Poland&#x27;s first museum and a patron of the Polish composer Frederic Chopin.

===Russia===
The salon culture was introduced to Imperial Russia during the Westernization Francophile culture of the Russian aristocracy in the 18th century. During the 19th century, several famous salon functioned hosted by the nobility in Saint Petersburg and Moscow, among the most famed being the literary salon of Zinaida Volkonskaya in 1820s Moscow.

===Sweden===
In Sweden, the salon developed during the late 17th century and flourished until the late 19th century. During the 1680s and 1690s, the salon of countess Magdalena Stenbock became a meeting where foreign ambassadors in Stockholm came to make contacts, and her gambling table was described as a center of Swedish foreign policy.

During the Swedish Age of Liberty (1718–1772), women participated in political debate and promoted their favorites in the struggle between the Caps (party) and the Hats (party) through political salons. These forums were regarded influential enough for foreign powers to engage some of these women as agents to benefit their interests in Swedish politics.
The arguably most noted political salonnière of the Swedish age of liberty was countess Hedvig Catharina De la Gardie (1695–1745), whose salon has some time been referred to as the first in Sweden, and whose influence on state affairs exposed her to libelous pamphlets and made her a target of Olof von Dahlin&#x27;s libelous caricature of the political salon hostess in 1733. Magdalena Elisabeth Rahm was attributed to have contributed to the realization of the Russo-Swedish War (1741–1743) through the campaign for the war she launched in her salon. Outside of politics, Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht acted as the hostess of the literary academy &quot;Tankebyggarorden&quot; and Anna Maria Lenngren did the same for the Royal Swedish Academy.

During the reign of Gustavian age, the home of Anna Charlotta Schröderheim came to be known as a center of opposition. Salon hostesses were still attributed influence in politic affairs in the first half of the 19th century, which was said of both Aurora Wilhelmina Koskull in the 1820s as well as Ulla De Geer in the 1840s.

In the 19th century, however, the leading salon hostesses in Sweden became more noted as the benefactors of the arts and charity than with politics. From 1820 and two decades onward, Malla Silfverstolpe became famous for her Friday nights salon in Uppsala, which became a center of the Romantic era in Sweden and, arguably the most famed literary salon in Sweden. During the 1860s and 1870s, the &quot;Limnell Salon&quot; of the rich benefactor Fredrika Limnell in Stockholm came to be a famous center of the Swedish cultural elite, were especially writers gathered to make contact with wealthy benefactors, a role which was eventually taken over by the &quot;Curman Receptions&quot; of Calla Curman in the 1880s and 1890s.

===Spain===
In Iberia or Latin America, a tertulia is a social gathering with literary or artistic overtones. The word is originally Spanish and has only moderate currency in English, in describing Latin cultural contexts. Since the 20th century, a typical &quot;tertulia&quot; has moved out from the private drawing-room to become a regularly scheduled event in a public place such as a bar, although some tertulias are still held in more private spaces. Participants may share their recent creations (poetry, short stories, other writings, even artwork or songs).

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, the salon culture was extant in the mid-18th century, represented by Julie Bondeli in Bern and Barbara Schulthess in Zürich, and the salon of Anna Maria Rüttimann-Meyer von Schauensee reached in influential role in the early 19th century.

In Coppet Castle close to Lake Geneva, the exiled Parisian salonnière and author, Madame de Staël, hosted a salon which played a key role in the aftermath of the French Revolution and especially under Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s Regime. It has become known as the &quot;Coppet group&quot;. De Staël is author of around thirty publications, from which &quot;On Germany&quot; (1813) was the most well known in its time. She has been painted by such famous painters as François Gérard and Elisabeth Vigée-Lebrun.

===United Kingdom===
In 18th-century England, salons were held by Elizabeth Montagu, in whose salon the expression bluestocking originated, and who created the Blue Stockings Society, and by Hester Thrale. In the 19th century, the Russian Baroness Méry von Bruiningk hosted a salon in St. John&#x27;s Wood, London, for refugees (mostly German) of the revolutions of 1848 (the Forty-Eighters). Clementia Taylor, an early feminist and radical held a salon at Aubrey House in Campden Hill in the 1860s. Her salon was attended by Moncure D. Conway, Louisa May Alcott, Arthur Munby, feminists Barbara Bodichon, Lydia Becker, Elizabeth Blackwell, and Elizabeth Malleson. Holland House in Kensington under the Fox family in the late 18th and early 19th centuries was akin to a French salon, largely for adherents to the Whig Party. Charles Babbage&#x27;s Saturday night soirées from 1828 and into the 1840s were a related phenomenon attracting men and women, scientists and writers.

===United States===
Martha Washington, the first American First Lady, performed a function similar to the host or hostess of the European salon. She held weekly public receptions throughout her husband&#x27;s eight-year presidency (1789–1797). At these gatherings, members of Congress, visiting foreign dignitaries, and ordinary citizens alike were received at the executive mansion. More recently, &quot;society hostesses&quot; such as Perle Mesta have done so as well. The Stettheimer sisters, including the artist Florine Stettheimer, hosted gatherings at their New York City home in the 1920s and &#x27;30s. During the Harlem Renaissance, Ruth Logan Roberts, Georgia Douglas Johnson and Zora Neale Hurston hosted salons that brought together leading figures in African-American literature, and in the culture and politics of Harlem at the time.

===Arab world===
== Modern-day salons ==
Modern-day versions of the traditional salon (some with a literary focus, and others exploring other disciplines in the arts and sciences) are held throughout the world, in private homes and public venues.

Sally Quinn and her husband Ben Bradlee hosted influential salons in Washington DC from the 1970s until the 2000s. &quot;An invitation to the couple’s historic Georgetown home was one of the most coveted status symbols in the nation’s capital, an entry to an elite salon of the powerful, talented and witty.&quot; In the 1980s, former nun and musician Theodora di Marco and her sister Norma hosted musical and debating soirées in their home in Notting Hill, London.

In 2014, in response to the isolation of the digital life, in-person events and salons grew in popularity. In 2021 response to the isolation of the pandemic, Susan MacTavish Best, who was part of the movement, launched an educational resource for those who wish to host salons in their community called The Salon Host.

==Other uses of the word==

The word salon also refers to art exhibitions. The Paris Salon was originally an officially sanctioned exhibit of recent works of painting and sculpture by members of the Académie royale de peinture et de sculpture, starting in 1673 and soon moving from the Salon Carré of the Palace of the Louvre.

The name &quot;salon&quot; remained, even when other quarters were found and the exhibits&#x27; irregular intervals became biennial. A jury system of selection was introduced in 1748, and the salon remained a major annual event even after the government withdrew official sponsorship in 1881.

The related terms &quot;salon-style exhibition&quot; or &quot;salon-style hang&quot; describe the practice of displaying large numbers of paintings, thus requiring placing them close together at multiple heights, often on a high wall.

<text>David Anthony Yallop (27 January 1937 – 23 August 2018) was a British author who wrote chiefly about unsolved crimes. In the 1970s, he contributed scripts for a number of British television shows, including &quot;Minder&quot;. In the same decade he also wrote 10 episodes for the ITV court drama, &quot;Crown Court&quot;.

His book, &quot;In God&#x27;s Name: An Investigation Into the Murder of Pope John Paul I&quot; (1984), posited that Pope John Paul I, found dead at age 65 in his chambers barely a month after becoming pope in 1978, had been poisoned by secretive Masons who had infiltrated the Vatican and the Vatican Bank. Reviewers, and the Roman Catholic Church, dismissed the book as groundless conspiracy theory. The book made the &quot;New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for 15 weeks, was translated into multiple languages, and was repeatedly reprinted, selling over six million copies.

In late 1989 he was sacked as a scriptwriter for &quot;EastEnders&quot; when he proposed killing some of the characters by means of an Irish Republican Army bomb. Yallop successfully sued the BBC for breach of contract. He was also one of the co-authors of Graham Chapman&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;A Liar&#x27;s Autobiography (Volume VI)&quot;.

Yallop suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in his later years. He died of pneumonia in London on 23 August 2018.

==Books==

*&quot;To Encourage The Others&quot; (about the Craig/Bentley murder case)
*&quot;The Day The Laughter Stopped&quot; (a biography of Roscoe &quot;Fatty&quot; Arbuckle)
*&quot;Beyond Reasonable Doubt?&quot; (the conviction of New Zealand farmer Arthur Allan Thomas (later pardoned), for the murder of Harvey and Jeannette Crewe) was made into a docu-drama feature film, 1978,

<doc id="848426" wikidata="Q1373014" url="?curid=848426" title="Covenant theology">
<text>Covenant theology (also known as covenantalism, federal theology, or federalism) is a biblical theology, a conceptual overview and interpretive framework for understanding the overall structure of the Bible. It is often distinguished from dispensational theology, a competing form of biblical theology. It uses the theological concept of a covenant as an organizing principle for Christian theology. The standard form of covenant theology views the history of God&#x27;s dealings with mankind, from Creation to Fall to Redemption to Consummation, under the framework of three overarching theological covenants: those of redemption, of works, and of grace.

Covenentalists call these three covenants &quot;theological&quot; because, though not explicitly presented as such in the Bible, they are thought of as theologically implicit, describing and summarizing a wealth of scriptural data. Historical Reformed systems of thought treat classical covenant theology not merely as a point of doctrine or as a central dogma, but as the structure by which the biblical text organizes itself. Covenant theology is upheld by the Reformed Churches (Continental Reformed, Presbyterian, Congregationalist and Reformed Anglican traditions). The most well-known form of Covenant Theology is associated with Presbyterians and comes from the Westminster Confession of Faith. A variant of this traditional Reformed form is sometimes called Baptist Covenant Theology or 1689 Federalism, to distinguish it from the standard covenant theology of Presbyterian Westminster Federalism. It is associated with Reformed Baptists and comes from the Second London Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689. Methodist hermeneutics traditionally use a variation of this, known as Wesleyan covenant theology, which is consistent with Arminian soteriology.

As a framework for Biblical interpretation, covenant theology stands in contrast to dispensationalism in regard to the relationship between the Old Covenant (with national Israel) and the New Covenant (with the house of Israel [Jeremiah 31:31] in Christ&#x27;s blood). That such a framework exists appears at least feasible, since from New Testament times the Bible of Israel has been known as the Old Testament (i.e., Covenant; see [NRSV], &quot;they [Jews] hear the &quot;reading&quot; of the &quot;old covenant&quot;&quot;), in contrast to the Christian addition which has become known as the New Testament (or Covenant). Detractors of covenant theology often refer to it as &quot;supersessionism&quot; or as &quot;replacement theology&quot;, due to the perception that it teaches that God has abandoned the promises made to the Jews and has replaced the Jews with Christians as His chosen people on the Earth. Covenant theologians deny that God has &quot;abandoned&quot; His promises to Israel, but see the fulfillment of the promises to Israel in the person and the work of the Messiah, Jesus of Nazareth, who established the church in organic continuity with Israel, not as a separate replacement entity. Many covenant theologians have also seen a distinct future promise of gracious restoration for unregenerate Israel.

== Theological covenants ==
God&#x27;s covenantal relationship with God&#x27;s creation is not made automatically or out of necessity. Rather, God chooses to establish the connection as a covenant, wherein the terms of the relationship are set down by God alone according to God&#x27;s own will.

=== Covenant of works ===
The covenant of works (, also called the covenant of life) was made in the Garden of Eden between God and Adam who represented all humankind as a federal head (Romans 5:12–21). God offered Adam a perfect and perpetual life if he did not violate God&#x27;s single commandment, but warned that death would follow if he disobeyed that commandment. Adam broke the covenant, thus standing condemned as representative for all humankind.

The term &quot;&quot; was first used by Dudley Fenner in 1585, though Zacharias Ursinus had mentioned a covenant of creation in 1562. The concept of the covenant of works became commonly recognized in Reformed theology by 1590, though not by all; some members of the Westminster Assembly disagreed with the teaching in the 1640s. John Calvin writes of a probationary period for Adam, a promise of life for obedience, and the federal headship of Adam, but he does not write of a covenant of works. It is not referred to as a covenant in the opening chapters of Genesis, but is referred to as a covenant in Hosea 6:7, &quot;But like Adam, they transgressed the covenant; there, they dealt faithlessly with Me.&quot;

==== Adamic covenant ====
Covenant theology first sees a covenant of works administered with Adam in the Garden of Eden. Upon Adam&#x27;s failure, God established the covenant of grace in the promised seed Genesis 3:15, and shows His redeeming care in clothing Adam and Eve in garments of skin—perhaps picturing the first instance of animal sacrifice. The specific covenants after the fall of Adam are seen as administered under the overarching theological covenant of grace.

==== Mosaic covenant ====
There is debate among the reformed if the Mosaic covenant was in some way a republication of the covenant of works. The view that there was such a republication was advocated by Thomas Boston, Edward Fisher, Meredith Kline and John Owen.

=== Covenant of grace ===
The covenant of grace promises eternal life for all people who have faith in Christ. God also promises the Holy Spirit to the elect to give them willingness and ability to believe. Christ is the substitutionary covenantal representative fulfilling the covenant of works on their behalf, in both the positive requirements of righteousness and its negative penal consequences (commonly described as His active and passive obedience). It is the historical expression of the eternal covenant of redemption. Genesis 3:15, with the promise of a &quot;seed&quot; of the woman who would crush the serpent&#x27;s head, is usually identified as the historical inauguration for the covenant of grace.

The covenant of grace runs through the Old and New Testaments, and is the same in substance under both the law and gospel, though there is some difference in the administration. Under the law, the sacrifices, prophesies, and other types and ordinances of the Jews signified Christ, and men were justified by their faith in Him just as they would be under the gospel. These were done away with the coming of Christ, and replaced with the much simpler sacraments of baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper.

Reformed orthodox theologians taught that the covenant was primarily unilateral or monopleuric () on the part of God, but also entailed conditions on the part of men. The conditions of the covenant of grace were spoken of as assumptive and confirmatory rather than duties required in order to receive the covenant. The covenant was therefore also bilateral or dipleuric (). Scholars have challenged the notion in contemporary scholarship that Genevan Reformers taught a unilateral and unconditional covenant relationship whilst the Rhineland Reformers taught a bilateral contractual relationship. Mark Jones, Richard Muller, J. Mark Beach, and John Von Rohr have argued that Leonard Trinterud&#x27;s identification of the apparent polarisation between Calvin and Olevianus on the one hand and Luther, Bullinger, and the Puritans on the other hand is a faulty reading of history.
==== Noahic covenant ====
The Noahic covenant is found in Genesis 8:20–9:17. Although redemption motifs are prominent as Noah and his family are delivered from the judgment waters, the narrative of the flood plays on the creation motifs of Genesis 1 as de-creation and re-creation. The formal terms of the covenant itself more reflect a reaffirmation of the universal created order, than a particular redemptive promise.

==== Abrahamic covenant ====
The Abrahamic covenant is found in Genesis chapters 12, 15, and 17. In contrast with the covenants made with Adam or Noah which were universal in scope, this covenant was with a particular people. Abraham is promised a seed and a land, although he would not see its fruition within his own lifetime. The Book of Hebrews explains that he was looking to a better and heavenly land, a city with foundations, whose builder and architect is God (11:8–16). The Apostle Paul writes that the promised seed refers in particular to Christ (Galatians 3:16).

The Abrahamic covenant is:
#Exclusive: it is only for Abraham and his (spiritual) descendants. Genesis 17:7
# Everlasting: it is not replaced by any later covenant. Genesis 17:7
# Accepted by faith. Genesis 15:6
# The external sign of entering into the Abrahamic covenant was circumcision. Genesis 17:10, but it has to be matched by an internal change, the circumcision of the heart. Jeremiah 4:4, Philippians 3:3
# According to Paul, since the Abrahamic covenant is eternal, the followers of Christ are &quot;children of Abraham&quot; and therefore part of this covenant through faith. &quot;Understand, then, that those who have faith are children of Abraham.&quot; Galatians 3:7
# According to covenant theology, Paul makes it clear that baptism is the external sign of faith in Christ (&quot;…you were baptized into Christ…&quot;), and that through faith in Christ the believer is part of the Abrahamic covenant (&quot;Abraham&#x27;s seed&quot;). This provides the basis for the doctrine that baptism is the New Testament sign of God&#x27;s covenant with Abraham, Galatians 3:26. Non-covenantal theology does not teach that the Abrahamic covenant is inherited by gentiles, and thus presents a different view of baptism.
# Romans 11 teaches disobedient Jews are broken off of the family tree of Abraham. It is only after the full number of the Gentiles have been grafted into Abraham&#x27;s family tree that God will pour out His mercy on the people of Israel.

==== Mosaic covenant ====
The Mosaic covenant, found in Exodus 19–24 and the book of Deuteronomy, expands on the Abrahamic promise of a people and a land. Repeatedly mentioned is the promise of the Lord, &quot;I will be your God and you will be my people&quot; (&quot;cf&quot;. Exodus 6:7, Leviticus 26:12), particularly displayed as His glory-presence comes to dwell in the midst of the people. This covenant is the one most in view when referring to the &quot;Old Covenant&quot;.

Although it is a gracious covenant beginning with God&#x27;s redemptive action (&quot;cf&quot;. Exodus 20:1–2), a layer of law is prominent. Concerning this aspect of the Mosaic Covenant, Charles Hodge makes three points in his &quot;Commentary on Second Corinthians&quot;: (1) The Law of Moses was in first place a reenactment of the covenant of works; viewed this way, it is the ministration of condemnation and death. (2) It was also a national covenant, giving national blessings based on national obedience; in this way it was purely legal. (3) In the sacrificial system, it points to the Gospel of salvation through a mediator.

===== Moabite covenant=====
Some commentators, like John Gill, see in the passage that begins in a distinct and gracious covenant, involving circumcision of the heart, which foresees the embrace of the Gentiles and which is looked back upon as distinct from the Mosaic Covenant by the Apostle Paul in .

===== Levite covenant=====
Other commentators, such as Douglas Van Dorn, recognize a separate priestly covenant, independent of the Mosaic covenant (which he takes as a prophetic covenant). In taken with the Davidic (kingly) covenant, this represents the three offices of Christ. Van Dorn argues this case on the basis of Nehemiah 13:29 which refers to &quot;the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites&quot;, Malachi 2:8 who speaks of &quot;the covenant of Levi,&quot; and Jeremiah 33:21 who points to the &quot;covenant with the Levitical priests.&quot; Van Dorn argues that the covenant document for this covenant is the book of Leviticus itself.

==== Davidic covenant ====
The Davidic covenant is found in 2 Samuel 7. The Lord proclaims that He will build a house and lineage for David, establishing His kingdom and throne forever. This covenant is appealed to as God preserves David&#x27;s descendants despite their wickedness (&quot;cf&quot;. 1 Kings 11:26–39, 15:1–8; 2 Kings 8:19, 19:32–34), although it did not stop judgment from finally arriving (compare 2 Kings 21:7, 23:26–27; Jeremiah 13:12–14). Among the prophets of the exile, there is hope of restoration under a Davidic king who will bring peace and justice (&quot;cf&quot;. Book of Ezekiel 37:24–28).

==== New Covenant ====

The New Covenant is anticipated with the hopes of the Davidic messiah, and most explicitly predicted by the prophet Jeremiah (Jeremiah 31:31–33). At the Last Supper, Jesus alludes to this prophecy, as well as to prophecies such as Isaiah 49:8, when he says that the cup of the Passover meal is &quot;the New Covenant in [His] blood.&quot; This use of the Old Testament typology is developed further in the Epistle to the Hebrews (esp. chs. 7–10). Jesus is the last Adam and Israel&#x27;s hope and consolation: he is the fulfillment of the law and the prophets (Matthew 5:17–18). He is the prophet greater than Jonah (Matthew 12:41), and the Son over the house where Moses was a servant (Hebrews 3:5–6), leading His people to the heavenly promised land. He is the high priest greater than Aaron, offering up Himself as the perfect sacrifice once for all (Hebrews 9:12, 26). He is the king greater than Solomon (Matthew 12:42), ruling forever on David&#x27;s throne (Luke 1:32). The term &quot;New Testament&quot; comes from the Latin translation of the Greek &quot;New Covenant&quot; and is most often used for the collection of books in the Bible, but can also refer to the New Covenant as a theological concept.

The covenant of grace became the basis for all future covenants that God made with mankind such as with Noah (Genesis 6, 9), with Abraham (Genesis 12, 15, 17), with Moses (Exodus 19–24), with David (2 Samuel 7), and finally in the New Covenant founded and fulfilled in Christ. These individual covenants are called the biblical covenants because they are explicitly described in the Bible. Under the covenantal overview of the Bible, submission to God&#x27;s rule and living in accordance with His moral law (expressed concisely in the Ten Commandments) is a response to grace – never something which can earn God&#x27;s acceptance (legalism). Even in His giving of the Ten Commandments, God introduces His law by reminding the Israelites that he is the one who brought them out of slavery in Egypt (grace).

=== Subservient Covenant ===
Moses Amyraut and few others proposed that the Mosaic Covenant is a third kind of substance, called the Subservient Covenant. As opposed to most covenant theologians, Moses Amyraut did not hold that the two substances are only the &quot;Covenant of Grace&quot; and the &quot;Covenant of Works&quot;.

=== Covenant of redemption ===
The covenant of redemption is the eternal agreement within the Godhead in which the Father appointed the Son through the Spirit to become incarnate, suffer, and die as a federal head of mankind to make an atonement for their sin. In return, the Father promised to raise Christ from the dead, glorify Him, and give Him a people. Two of the earliest theologians to write about the covenant of redemption were Johannes Cocceius and John Owen, though Caspar Olevian had hinted at the idea before them. This covenant is not mentioned in the Westminster Standards, but the idea of a contractual relationship between the Father and Son is present. Scriptural support for such a covenant may be found in Psalms 2 and 110, Isaiah 53, Philippians 2:5–11 and Revelation 5:9–10. Some covenant theologians have denied the intra-Trinitarian covenant of redemption, or have questioned the notion of the Son&#x27;s works leading to the reward of gaining a people for God, or have challenged the covenantal nature of this arrangement.

== Covenantal signs and seals ==
In Reformed theology, a sacrament is usually defined as a sign and seal of the covenant of grace. Since covenant theology today is mainly Reformed in its outlook, proponents view Baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper as the only two sacraments in this sense, which are sometimes called &quot;church ordinances.&quot; Along with the preached word, they are identified as an ordinary means of grace for salvation. The benefits of these rites do not occur from participating in the rite itself (&quot;ex opere operato&quot;), but through the power of the Holy Spirit as they are received by faith.

Sometimes Reformed covenantal theologians define &quot;sacrament&quot; to include signs and seals of the covenant of works. The Garden of Eden, the tree of life, the tree of knowledge of good and evil, and the Sabbath are commonly considered to be the sacraments of the covenant of works.

=== Lord&#x27;s Supper ===
The Eucharist or the Lord&#x27;s Supper was instituted by Jesus at a Passover meal, to which he gave a radical reinterpretation. The festival of Passover commemorates the Israelites&#x27; deliverance from Egypt – specifically, how the lamb&#x27;s blood which God commanded them to place on their door posts caused the Angel of Death to &quot;pass over&quot; their dwellings, so that their firstborn might be spared from the final plague. The New Testament writers understand this event typologically: as the lamb&#x27;s blood saved the Israelites from the plague, so Jesus&#x27; substitutionary death saves God&#x27;s New Covenant people from being judged for their sins. Calvinism has generally viewed the Eucharist as a mysterious participation in the Real Presence of Christ mediated by the Holy Spirit (that is, real spiritual presence or &quot;pneumatic presence&quot;). This differs from Roman Catholicism and Lutheranism which believe in the Real Presence as an actual bodily presence of Christ, as well as from the generally Baptist position that the supper is strictly a memorial commemoration.

=== Baptism ===

Paedobaptist Covenant theologians argue that the Abrahamic Covenant is still in force, and that God&#x27;s covenantal promise &quot;to be your God and the God of your descendants after you&quot; still stands for every believer. The argument that the administration of all (other) Biblical covenants, including the New Covenant, include a principle of familial, corporate inclusion, or &quot;generational succession&quot; is therefore of secondary importance to whether infants should be baptized or not. The familial nature of the Abrahamic covenant is undisputed. Genesis 17 &quot;You are to undergo circumcision, and it will be the sign of the covenant between me and you. 12 For the generations to come every male among you who is eight days old must be circumcised, including those born in your household or bought with money from a foreigner—those who are not your offspring. 13 Whether born in your household or bought with your money, they must be circumcised.&quot;

In the Acts of the Apostles 2:38–39, the promise is seen to extend to the children of believers as it always was in the Abrahamic Covenant. The Biblical covenants between God and man include signs and seals that visibly represent the realities behind the covenants. These visible signs and symbols of God&#x27;s covenant redemption are administered in a corporate manner (for instance, to households—see Acts 16:14–15; 16:31–34), not in an exclusively individualistic manner.

Baptism is considered to be the visible New Testament sign of entrance into the Abrahamic Covenant and therefore may be administered individually to new believers making a public profession of faith. Paedobaptists further believe this extends corporately to the households of believers which typically would include children, or individually to children or infants of believing parents (see Infant baptism). In this view, baptism is thus seen as the functional replacement and sacramental equivalent of the Abrahamic rite of circumcision (Colossians 2:11–14) and symbolizes the internal cleansing from sin, among other things.

Credobaptist Covenant theologians (such as the Baptists Benjamin Keach, John Gill, and Charles Spurgeon) hold that baptism is only for those who can understand and profess their faith, and they argue that the regulative principle of worship, which many paedobaptists also advocate and which states that elements of worship (including baptism) must be based on explicit commands of Scripture, is violated by infant baptism. Furthermore, because the New Covenant is described in Jeremiah 31:31–34 as a time when all who were members of it would have the law written on their hearts and would know God, Baptist Covenant Theologians believe only those who are born again are members of the New Covenant.

== History ==
Huldrych Zwingli and Johannes Oecolampadius were among the first reformers to speak of God&#x27;s salvation economy under the categories of a covenant of works and a covenant of grace. John Calvin (&quot;Institutes&quot; 2:9–11), like Heinrich Bullinger (&quot;A Brief Exposition of the One and Eternal Testament or Covenant of God&quot;), focused on the continuity of the covenant of grace, but taught the substance of what became classic covenant theology in terms of Law and Gospel. Early post-reformation writings, including Zacharius Ursinus (1534–1583) in &quot;Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism&quot; (published posthumously, 1591), Caspar Olevianus (1536–1587) in &quot;Concerning the Substance of the Covenant of Grace between God and the Elect&quot; (&quot;De substantia foederis gratuiti inter deum et electos&quot;, 1585), and Scottish Theologian Robert Rollock (1555–1599) in &quot;A Treatise of our Effectual Calling&quot; (&quot;Tractatus de vocatione efficaci&quot;, 1597), developed the covenant of works and covenant of grace scheme along the lines of the law-gospel distinction.

Classical statements of covenant theology can be found in the British Westminster Confession of Faith (particularly chap. 7, 8, 19), as well as in the writings of English theologians such as John Owen (1616–1683), &quot;Biblical Theology&quot;, and &quot;An Exposition of the Epistle to the Hebrews&quot;. The classical statements among 17th century continental theologians include Johannes Cocceius (c. 1603–1669) in &quot;The Doctrine of the Covenant and Testament of God&quot; (&quot;Summa doctrinae de foedere et testamento dei&quot;, 1648), Francis Turretin (1623–1687) in his &quot;Institutes of Elenctic Theology&quot;, and Hermann Witsius (1636–1708) in &quot;The Economy of the Covenants Between God and Man&quot;. It may also be seen in the writings of Jonathan Edwards (1703–58) in &quot;Collected Writings of Jonathan Edwards&quot;, Vol 2, Banner of Truth edition, p. 950.

In the United States, the Princeton theologians (Charles Hodge, A. A. Hodge, B. B. Warfield, Geerhardus Vos, and J. Gresham Machen) and, in the Netherlands, Herman Bavinck followed the main lines of the classic view, teaching the Covenant of Redemption, the Covenant of Works (Law), and the Covenant of Grace (Gospel).

Recent well-known covenant theologians in the United States include Michael Horton, J. Ligon Duncan III, Meredith G. Kline, J. I. Packer, Richard L. Pratt Jr., O. Palmer Robertson and R. C. Sproul. This system is taught at schools such as Covenant Theological Seminary, Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, Knox Theological Seminary, Reformed Theological Seminary, Westminster Theological Seminary, and Westminster Seminary California.

== Developments ==
There have been recent developments in classical covenant theology by Reformed (Calvinist) pastors and theologians. Wesleyan covenant theology, a variation of classical covenant theology, was designed by John Wesley, the founder of Methodism.

=== Classical covenant theology ===
==== Covenant structure ====
Meredith G. Kline did pioneering work in the field of Biblical studies, in the 1960s and 1970s, building on prior work by George E. Mendenhall, by identifying the form of the covenant with the common Suzerain–Vassal treaties of the Ancient Near East in the 2nd millennium BC. One of the highlights of his work has been the comparison of the Mosaic Covenant with the Hittite Suzerainty Treaty formula. A suggested comparison of the treaty structure with the book of Deuteronomy is as follows:
*Preamble (&quot;cf&quot;. Deuteronomy 1:1–4)
*Historical prologue (&quot;cf&quot;. Deuteronomy 1:5–3:29)
*Stipulations (&quot;cf&quot;. Deuteronomy 4–26)
*Document clause (&quot;cf&quot;. Deuteronomy 27)
*List of gods as witnesses (notably lacking in Deuteronomy)
*Sanctions: curses and blessings (&quot;cf&quot;. Deuteronomy 28; 31–34).

Kline has argued that comparisons between the suzerain-vassal treaties and royal grants of the Ancient Near East provide insight in highlighting certain distinctive features of the Mosaic covenant as a law covenant, in contrast with the other historic post-Fall covenants. Many who have embraced Kline&#x27;s insights have still insisted, however, in accordance with the Westminster Confession of Faith, that the Mosaic covenant was fundamentally an administration of the Covenant of Grace.

==== Contemporary revisions and controversy ====
A number of major 20th-century covenant theologians including Karl Barth, Klaas Schilder, and John Murray have departed from the traditional recognition of a covenant of works in classical covenant theology to develop a monocovenantal scheme subsuming everything under one Covenant of Grace. The focus of all biblical covenants is then on grace and faith. This has not been developed consistently between the various theologians. For example, Barth, influential in the mainline churches and in certain evangelical circles, conceived of grace as the fundamental reality underlying all of creation. Influential among more conservative Calvinist churches, Murray acknowledged the traditional concept of a works principle as a condition for life with Adam in the Garden of Eden, comparing Adam&#x27;s works to the works of Christ. He disputed its label as a covenant, however, preferring to call this arrangement the Adamic administration.

=====Shepherd controversy=====
At Westminster Theological Seminary in the late 1970s, Norman Shepherd, a professor of systematic theology was dismissed due to controversy over his teaching on justification. His views involved a reconfiguration of covenant theology that went beyond those of Murray, his predecessor. Shepherd denied any notion of a works or merit principle, leading to a denial of the imputation of Christ&#x27;s active obedience to the believer. He argued that Jesus&#x27; own justification was due to His faith and obedience. In the same way then, the believer must be justified before God by faith and obedience. Shepherd&#x27;s followers claim that the Covenant of Works between Adam and God in the Garden of Eden was not originally part of covenant theology, following John Murray&#x27;s observation that a covenant of works at creation does not receive explicit mention in early confessions such as the French Confession (1559), the Scots Confession (1560), the Belgic Confession (1561), the Thirty-Nine Articles (1562), the Heidelberg Catechism (1563), and the Second Helvetic Confession (1566).

Some of Shepherd&#x27;s critics contend that the concept of a works principle distinct from a Covenant of Grace is evident in the commentaries and dogmatic works of the earliest covenant theologians, particularly in the distinction made between Law and Gospel (for instance, Zacharias Ursinus, &quot;Commentary on the Heidelberg Catechism&quot;). There is also explicit articulation of a Covenant of Works in the writings of those such as Olevianus and Rollock. Additionally, defenders of the merit-based view argue that the concept of this works principle operating in the pre-Fall state in the Garden of Eden as a covenant is present in the early confessions even if the Covenant of Works is not explicitly named. Examples include Belgic Confession, article 14, which speaks of Adam having received and transgressed the &quot;commandment of life&quot;; or Heidelberg Catechism, Question and Answer 6 affirming the goodness of man in creation. The later Westminster Confession of Faith (1646) explicitly names the Covenant of Works which Adam transgressed (7.2; 19.1), and which &quot;continues to be a perfect rule of righteousness&quot; in the form of the moral law (19.2, 3).

=====Kline=====
In opposition to the modern revisers, Meredith Kline reemphasized the idea of a covenant of works as expressed in the Westminster Confession of Faith 7.2 as a means to protect a gospel of grace. Kline wrote:
Kline, Michael Horton, and others have sought to uphold the distinction of two sorts of covenant traditions: one based on merit, earned by obedience to law (works), and the other on promise (grace). While the consensus in Calvinist theology is that works are antithetical to grace as the means of justification, differences emerge in attempts to describe this antithesis.

On the one hand, Calvinist theologians were more in line with Kline tend to say that works are ultimately the basis for grace, since God requires perfect upholding of the law for heavenly reward. Since this is understood to be an impossible task for the corrupted sinner, it is Christ who perfectly obeyed the law in fulfillment of the covenant of works. Jesus, earning the reward, graciously bestows it to His people (&quot;cf.&quot; Luke 22:29). For example, R. C. Sproul writes, &quot;Man&#x27;s relationship to God in creation was based &quot;on works&quot;. What Adam failed to achieve, Christ, the second Adam, succeeded in achieving. &quot;Ultimately the only way one can be justified is by works&quot;.&quot; The sinner is thus saved by Christ&#x27;s works and not his own. Right standing before God is then due to an alien or imputed righteousness received by faith, not by personal faithfulness which is the fruition of salvation and not its ground.

On the other hand, Calvinist theologians more in line with Murray tend to say that works were never meant to be the basis for grace, but that grace precedes the call for obedience. Consequently, works are the necessary response to grace and not the precondition for it. For example, Michael Williams writes, &quot;The function of law within Scripture is the maintenance of relationship, not the creation of relationship. Legal obligation is not the precondition for life and relationship. Rather, life and relationship form the necessary environment for obligation.&quot; While this view still affirms the necessity of the merit of Christ, it departs from Kline&#x27;s construal of merit as a fundamental principle of the covenant of works.

=== Wesleyan covenant theology ===

Methodism maintains the superstructure of classical covenant theology, but being Arminian in soteriology, it discards the &quot;predestinarian template of Reformed theology that was part and parcel of its historical development.&quot; The main difference between Wesleyan covenant theology and classical covenant theology is as follows:

As such, in the Wesleyan-Arminian view, only Adam and Eve were under the covenant of works, while on the other hand, all of their progeny are under the covenant of grace. With Mosaic Law belonging to the covenant of grace, all of humanity is brought &quot;within the reach of the provisions of that covenant.&quot; This belief is reflected in John Wesley&#x27;s sermon &quot;Righteousness of Faith&quot;: &quot;The Apostle does not here oppose the covenant given by Moses, to the covenant given by Christ. …But it is the covenant of grace, which God, through Christ, hath established with men in all ages&quot;. The covenant of grace was therefore administered through &quot;promises, prophecies, sacrifices, and at last by circumcision&quot; during the patriarchal ages and through &quot;the paschal lamb, the scape goat, [and] the priesthood of Aaron&quot; under Mosaic Law. Under the Gospel, the covenant of grace is mediated through the greater sacraments, baptism and the Lord&#x27;s Supper. The Methodist theologian Richard Watson, with regard to the Eucharist, stated:
Wesleyan covenant theology is also seen in the Methodist theology of baptism, e.g. when introducing this sacrament, United Methodist Book of Worship teaches: &quot;The Baptismal Covenant is God&#x27;s word to us, proclaiming our adoption by grace, and our word to God, promising our response of faith and love. Those within the covenant constitute the community we call the Church&quot;. Watson explicates Wesleyan-Arminian theology regarding baptism:
In Wesleyan covenant theology, the source of the covenant of grace is Jesus Christ, as &quot;the &quot;prophet, priest, and king&quot;, the &quot;head&quot; and &quot;saviour&quot; of His church, the &quot;heir of all things&quot; and &quot;judge of the world&quot;.&quot;

As with the Reformed view, the founder of the movement, John Wesley held that the moral law, which is contained in the Ten Commandments, continues to stand today:
Wesleyan covenant theology, unlike Reformed classical covenant theology, emphasizes that though God initiates a covenant with humanity, humans are given the free will to follow Him, and &quot;God is always the innocent party in cases where salvation is lost&quot;.

When persons become professing members of a Methodist connexion, they personally bind themselves to a covenant with God and the Church through the making of vows. On New Year&#x27;s Eve, congregations belonging to various Methodist connexions, such as the United Methodist Church, Free Methodist Church and Pilgrim Holiness Church, conduct a watchnight service in the form of the Covenant Renewal Service, so that Methodist believers can personally renew their covenant with the Creator every year; this liturgy is traditionally preceded by prayer and fasting.

===Baptist covenant theology===
The most well-known form of Covenant theology is associated with Presbyterians (paedobaptists) and comes from the Westminster Confession of Faith. Another form is sometimes called Baptist covenant theology or 1689 Federalism, to distinguish it from Westminster Federalism, and is associated with Reformed Baptists (credobaptists) and comes from the Second London Baptist Confession of Faith, published in 1689. The principal difference between these two variants of covenant theology is their understanding of the Covenant of Grace. Standard Westminster covenant theology sees the Covenant of Grace beginning with the Fall in Genesis 3, and continuing through the Old Covenant and the New Covenant, under the same &quot;substance&quot; but different &quot;administrations&quot;. The Covenant of Grace, the Old Covenant, and the New Covenant, then, all have the same substance and only differ in the fact that the Old Covenant and the New Covenant constitute two separate administrations of that single substance. Covenant theology under the Second London Baptist Confession, in contrast, also sees the Covenant of Grace as beginning with the Fall in Genesis 3, and continuing through the Old Covenant and the New Covenant. But it sees the substance of the Covenant of Grace as being the same as the New Covenant, though not the Old Covenant. The Covenant of Grace, then, is the same thing as the New Covenant. As such, the Covenant of Grace coexists with the Old Covenant though is not the Old Covenant. Instead, under the Old Covenant, it is a series of promises that point towards the New Covenant, and will not be realized until that point.

The Westminster Confession of Faith outlines this &quot;one substance, two administrations&quot; understanding by specifying that under the Old Covenant, the covenant was &quot;administered by promises, prophecies, sacrifices, circumcision, the paschal lamb, and other types and ordinances&quot;, while under the New Covenant, the covenant is administered by &quot;the preaching of the Word, and the administration of the sacraments&quot; so that &quot;there are not, therefore, two covenants of grace differing in substance, but one and the same under various dispensations. In contrast, the Second London Baptist Confession of Faith condenses this all down to say that the Covenant of Grace was revealed progressively over Old Testament history after Genesis 3 &quot;by further steps, until the full discovery thereof was completed in the New Testament.&quot;

Since the Covenant of Works and the Covenant of Grace are the only redemptive covenants, stemming from the Covenant of Redemption, salvation is only possible through the Covenant of Grace, as in the covenant theology of standard Westminster pedobaptist federalism. Between The Fall in Genesis 3 and the New Covenant are several other covenants, in particular the covenant of Abraham, the covenant of Moses, and the covenant of David. But these covenants are &quot;works and law&quot; covenants and not &quot;redemptive&quot; covenants, since they exist only for specific earthly purposes in space and time, such as to allow Israel to live in the promised land under the conditions given in the covenant. Though their substance is different from the Covenant of Grace, and are therefore not part of that covenant, they do point to the promises in that covenant. They do this by drawing on typology, and as such consist of &quot;types&quot; and &quot;antitypes&quot;, where the &quot;type&quot; is the explicit purpose of that covenant, but the &quot;antitype&quot; is the way in which that covenant points towards the promises of the Covenant of Grace through the New Covenant. Salvation was therefore possible for people under the Old Covenant through the Covenant of Grace if they had saving faith in these promises. Covenant theology under Westminster Federalism allows paedobaptism since it sees a greater continuity between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant. Covenant theology under 1689 Federalism, in contrast, supports credobaptism under the regulative principle since it sees less direct continuity between the Old Covenant and the New Covenant, even if it still sees major continuity through the overarching Covenant of Grace.

<text>Janusz Adam Onyszkiewicz (, born 18 December 1937) is a Polish mathematician, alpinist and politician, who served as Minister of Defence twice, in the cabinets of Hanna Suchocka (1992–1993) and Jerzy Buzek (1997–2000).

Later in his career, Onyszkiewicz was a Member of the European Parliament.

==Early life and education==
Onyszkiewicz was born in Lwów (then Poland, now Lviv, Ukraine). He graduated in mathematics from Warsaw University. He became a mathematician, and was also known as an alpinist in the 1970s along with his wife Alison Chadwick-Onyszkiewicz. After Alison&#x27;s death on Annapurna in 1978, Onyszkiewicz gave up altitude climbing and turned to politics. 

==Political career==
In the 1980s, Onyszkiewicz became the spokesman for the anti-communist Solidarity movement. He became popular among foreign journalists because of his fluent English. After the introduction of martial law in Poland on 13 December 1981, he was arrested and interned. In 1986, he was again detained by the police, preventing him from holding a news conference on behalf of political prisoners that was scheduled to coincide with the start of a conference of intellectuals.

===Member of the Polish Parliament===
After the fall of communism in 1989, Onyszkiewicz became a member of the Polish Sejm. He served all subsequent terms from May 1989 until 2001. In the spring of 1990, Onyszkiewicz and Bronisław Komorowski became the first civilian vice-ministers of defence in the communist-dominated Ministry of Defence. Later, Onyszkiewicz was Minister of Defence twice, in the cabinets of Hanna Suchocka (1992–1993) and Jerzy Buzek (1997–2000).

Initially, Onyszkiewicz was a member of the Obywatelski Klub Parlamentarny, then the Democratic Union and the Freedom Union. Today, he is a member of the Democratic Party, the continuation of Democratic Union.

In 1999, Onyszkiewicz was awarded the Manfred Wörner Medal by the German Minister of Defence.

===Member of the European Parliament===
On 13 June 2004, Onyszkiewicz was elected to the European Parliament as a candidate of Democratic Union in the 10th constituency (Lesser Poland+Swietokrzyskie Voivodeships) receiving 50 155 votes (6,37%). On 20 July 2004 he was elected a vice-president of the European Parliament. 

==Other activities==
Onyszkiewicz is Chairman of the ICDT&#x27;s International Board of Directors.

<doc id="848433" wikidata="Q921839" url="?curid=848433" title="Jacek Saryusz-Wolski">
<text>Jacek Emil Saryusz-Wolski (born 19 September 1948) is a Polish diplomat and PiS (Law and Justice) politician. He has been a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) since June 2004. He served as vice president of the European Parliament (2004–2007). Saryusz-Wolski is chairman of the executive board of the “Foundation College of Europe”, in charge of the Natolin campus of the College of Europe.

== Early life and education ==
Saryusz-Wolski comes from a family of the Jelita coat of arms. His father, Emil, a chemical engineer, was stationed with Polish troops in Britain during the Second World War, while his mother, Eryka, worked as a landscape gardener.

He graduated from the First High School of &quot;Nicolaus Copernicus&quot; in Łódź and he obtained a degree in economics from the University of Łódź. He also completed postgraduate studies at the &quot;Centre Européen Universitaire&quot; in Nancy, France. In the 1970s he was a lecturer on the European Communities at the University of Łódź and in the 1980s he was an assistant professor in the Department of Socialist Political Economy of the University of Łódź. At the turn of the 1980s and 1990s led the Center for European Studies at the University of Łódź.

==Political career==

Saryusz-Wolski was nominated the first Polish plenipotentiary for European integration and foreign aids (&quot;pełnomocnik ds. integracji europejskiej i pomocy zagranicznej&quot;) when this office was created in 1991 by the prime minister Jan Krzysztof Bielecki. He held this position till 1996, despite the frequent government changes. He returned to the government in 2000, when the prime minister Jerzy Buzek has nominated him a secretary in the European Integration Committee (&quot;Komitet Integracji Europejskiej&quot;). Jacek Saryusz-Wolski played an important role in the negotiations in Nice in 2000. In 2001, he unsuccessfully ran for the Polish Senate on behalf of &quot;Blok Senat 2001&quot;.

===Member of the European Parliament ===
Saryusz-Wolski was elected an MEP at the European Parliament election on 13 June 2004, as a candidate of Civic Platform, in the constituency #6 (Łódź Voivodship) receiving 66,589 votes (that is 16.92%, the best result in the region).

On 20 July 2004, he was elected as one of the Vice Presidents of the European Parliament for the EPP, and was at the position till 16 January 2007. He was re-elected in 2009 and 2014.

Since first joining the European Parliament, Saryusz-Wolski has been a member of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, which he chaired between 2007 and 2009.

In late 2004, Saryusz-Wolski&#x27;s candidacy to become Poland’s first-ever European Commissioner was supported by the main Polish opposition parties but the post eventually went to the country’s Europe minister, Danuta Hübner.

In March 2006, Saryusz-Wolski was elected vice president of the European People&#x27;s Party (EPP) for a three-year term. He also served as vice-president and member of the national board of Civic Platform until October 2010 and as leader of the Polish delegation of centre-right MEPs until 2012. In 2007, the Civic Platform failed to secure sufficient backing from within the centre-right European People’s Party Group for Saryusz-Wolski, its candidate as for the post of vice-president of the European Parliament.

In 2010, Saryusz-Wolski joined the &quot;Friends of the EEAS&quot;, a unofficial and independent pressure group formed because of concerns that the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy Catherine Ashton was not paying sufficient attention to the Parliament and was sharing too little information on the formation of the European External Action Service.

In addition to his parliamentary assignments, Saryusz-Wolski chaired the EPP Energy Ministers Meeting until 2017. In 2015, he and Françoise Grossetête guided the EPP’s working groups on economy and environment and foreign affairs in developing options for getting the EU to speak with a unified voice on external energy security matters.

In March 2017, the Polish government of Prime Minister Beata Szydło openly opposed the reelection of Donald Tusk as President of the European Council for a second two-and-a-half year term and put forward Saryusz-Wolski as a challenger. After Saryusz-Wolski accepted the nomination for council president, Civic Platform ejected him from the party. He was subsequently stripped of his position of vice-president within the EPP. He also stopped being a member of the EPP group in the Parliament.

In February 2019, he was appointed as the leader of the Law and Justice (PiS) list in the European elections in constituency No. 4 (Warsaw).
In March of the same year he joined the parliamentary group of European Conservatives and Reformists.
As a result of the May vote, he was elected the MEP for the fourth time, receiving 186,851 votes.

==Political positions==
Saryusz-Wolski is widely regarded as having played a big role in the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine and in support for the opposition in Belarus. In the debate on the EU’s energy diversification and security policies, he has in the past argued that “Nord Stream 2 would be, above all, detrimental in geopolitical terms . . . for the purpose of exerting more political pressure and applying blackmail on the EU, its eastern member states and its eastern neighbours.”

In 2015, news media reported that Saryusz-Wolski was included in a Russian blacklist of prominent people from the European Union who are not allowed to enter the country.

<doc id="848434" wikidata="Q2353171" url="?curid=848434" title="M-51 (Michigan highway)">
<text>M-51 is a north–south state trunkline highway in the southwestern portion of the US state of Michigan. The southern terminus is at a connection with State Road 933 across the Michigan–Indiana state line near South Bend, Indiana. From there the trunkline runs north through an interchange with US Highway 12 (US 12) into Niles along a route that was once part of Business US 12 (Bus. US 12). North of Niles, the highway runs parallel to a river and a rail line through rural areas. The northern terminus is on Interstate 94 (I-94) west of Paw Paw.

There were two other highways that bore the M-51 designation. The first connected Holland and Grand Rapids with the birth of the highway system in 1919. After the creation of the United States Numbered Highway System in 1926, the number was moved to a different highway in The Thumb area. That second highway was scaled back and later decommissioned in the 1960s. The current highway dates back to 1971 when the southern end of M-40 was rerouted, and the previous alignment was given the M-51 moniker. It was extended to the state line in 1998 to complete the current highway.

==Route description==
M-51 starts at the Indiana state line as a continuation of SR 933 into Michigan. The trunkline runs north through residential areas along 11th Street into Niles. On the south side of town, it meets US 12 before continuing northward through commercial areas. Between the intersections with Maple and Main streets, M-51 splits into a one-way pair of streets to follow 12th Street northbound and 11th Street southbound. Oak Street marks the western end of Bus. M-60, and M-51 turns westward on Main Street into downtown Niles. At 5th Street, the highway turns north again to exit downtown. The highway crosses a rail line owned by Amtrak before curving northeasterly near the Plym Park Golf Course. M-51 angles parallel to the Dowagiac River and the Amtrak line as the highway crosses from Berrien County into Cass County. The landscape transitions to farmland along the river, and the highway turns to the east between Sumnerville and Pokagon.

Past Pokagon, M-51 turns back northeasterly toward Dowagiac. Once the highway reaches that city, it merges with M-62. The two highways run concurrently eastward along Spruce, Main and Division streets through downtown. M-51 turns to the north along Front Street, separating from the concurrency and leaving downtown. North of town in rural Cass County, M-51 intersects M-152 near the location where the highway crosses the Dowagiac River. North of that intersection, the trunkline crosses into Van Buren County and turns to the east again. M-51 passes south of Knickerbocker Lake before turning northeasterly parallel to the rail line along Delaware Street in Decatur. after which is heads due north to I-94.

M-51 is maintained by MDOT like other state highways in Michigan. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction. These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT&#x27;s surveys in 2010 showed that the highest traffic levels along M-51 were the 20,298 vehicles daily south of US 12; the lowest counts were the 2,658 vehicles per day west of Decatur. M-51 between US 12 and the state line has been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country&#x27;s economy, defense, and mobility.

==History==

===Previous designations===
When the state highway system was originally signed in 1919, M-51 was initially designated from Holland to Grand Rapids. The highway ran from Zeeland along a route that used Byron Road and 32nd Avenue to connect with Port Sheldon Street in Jenison before connecting with Chicago Drive. The highway&#x27;s course was simplified by 1924 to use Chicago Drive between Zeeland and Jenison. When the US Highway System debuted in 1926, this original M-51 was renumbered as an extension of M-21, and the M-51 number was reused for the original M-27 in The Thumb. The highway ran from Port Huron to M-83 (now M-142) west of Harbor Beach. The designation of M-51 from Port Huron to M-46 was removed in late 1961, and the remainder to M-142 was removed in 1965.

===Current designation===
In 1971, all of M-40 south of I-94 to Niles was reassigned the designation M-51 while M-40 was shifted to the east to take over the routing of the contemporary M-119 between Paw Paw and its intersection with US 12 in Porter Township near Mottville. The routing of M-51 was extended down to the state line in April 1998 when US 33 was decommissioned out of the state of Michigan; the extension formed a concurrency with Business US 12 (Bus. US 12) through Niles in the process. In early 2010, the central section of Bus. US 12 was transferred to the City of Niles. In doing so, the Bus. US 12 designation was decommissioned in the city, removing that designation from the M-51 concurrency.

<doc id="848439" wikidata="Q1900188" url="?curid=848439" title="Forage harvester">
<text>A forage harvesteralso known as a silage harvester, forager or chopperis a farm implement that harvests forage plants to make silage. Silage is grass, corn or hay, which has been chopped into small pieces, and compacted together in a storage silo, silage bunker, or in silage bags. It is then fermented to provide feed for livestock. Haylage is a similar process to silage but using grass which has dried.

==Uses==
Forage harvesters can be implements attached to a tractor, or they can be self-propelled units. In either configuration, they comprise a drum (cutterhead) or a flywheel with a number of knives fixed to it that chops and blows the silage out of a chute of the harvester into a wagon that is either connected to the harvester or to another vehicle driving alongside. Towed harvesters are either single-chop, double-chop or precision-chop. Most larger machines also have paddle accelerators to increase material speed and improve unloading characteristics.

Older machines were operated by cables; later, hydraulics; the newer types are operated by electronics. While towed harvesters continue to be used by small-family farms, the more efficient way of silage-making is with a self-propelled machine with a tractor or truck running along with the forager. Today&#x27;s largest machines have engines producing up to , are fitted with headers able to cut up to a swath of corn in a single pass, and an output exceeding 400 tons of silage per hour. Once a wagon is filled up, the wagon can be detached and taken back to a silo for unloading, and another wagon can be attached. Because corn and grass require different types of cutting equipment, there are different heads for each type of silage, and these heads can be connected and disconnected from the harvester. 

Grass silage is usually cut prior to harvesting to allow it to wilt, before being harvested from swathes with a collection header (windrow pickup). Maize and whole crop silage are cut directly by the header, using reciprocating knives, disc mowers or large saw-like blades. Kernel processors (KP), modules consisting of two mill rolls with teeth pressed together by powerful springs, are frequently used when harvesting cereal crops like corn and sorghum to crack the kernels of these plant heads. Kernel processors are installed between the cutterhead and accelerator. In most forage harvesters, the KP can be quickly removed and replaced with a grass chute for chopping non-cereal crops.

Silage made from grass, canola, oats or wheat are chopped into pieces (depending on knife, cutterhead, and length of cut transmission configuration), and treated with additives including bacteria, enzymes, mold inhibitors, and preservatives to accelerate the fermentation process. When silage is made of corn or sorghum, additives are not necessary because of the high sugar and starch levels in the plants. Additives, however, are frequently added to corn and sorghum to augment their fermentation.

<doc id="848442" wikidata="Q63132" url="?curid=848442" title="Bruno Streckenbach">
<text>Bruno Streckenbach (7 February 1902 – 28 October 1977) was a German SS functionary during the Nazi era. He was the head of Administration and Personnel Department of the Reich Security Main Office (RSHA). Streckenbach was responsible for many thousands of murders committed by Nazi mobile killing squads known as &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;.

== Early years ==
Bruno Streckenbach was born in Hamburg, Germany on 7 February 1902. His highest education was Gymnasium, which he left in April 1918 to voluntarily report to the German Army during World War I. Just like his close colleagues Erwin Schulz and Heinrich Himmler, he never served on the front lines of the battlefield due to the ceasefire that took place in November 1918.

After the end of the First World War, he was an active member of the Freikorps Bahrenfeld, which took part in the 1920 Kapp-Putsch. He was employed as a wholesale merchant, tried his hand at advertising, being a radio editor and also trying to establish himself as the director of a local office.

== Nazi seizure of power in 1933 ==
1933 was a huge year for many soon-to-be SS and police officers. As some historians have mentioned, for people like Streckenbach, 1933 was the year in which they assumed positions of the Gestapo (Political Police), but also the year which they were put into “leadership positions, posts they would hardly have occupied without the National Socialist seizure of power.” Following the Reichstag Fire on 27 February 1933 which the Nazis falsely propagated to be “communist-led,” there was a suspension of constitutional rights in the Weimar Republic, which increased the power of the government. Protests occurred and subsequently severe persecution towards left-wing politicians followed the Presidential Decree for the Protection of Volk and State on 28 February. In the March 5 Reichstag Elections, the National Socialists won power, although only upon merging with the Deutschnationale Volkspartei. After having the majority vote, the Nazis seized full power. Persecution against political opponents and Jews increased, as did incidence of brutal assault, sporadic murder, and arson. It was during this seizure of power that many of the future leaders of the RSHA were given their first positions in the party.

More than a quarter of the future RSHA leaders had already been police officers in their respective home towns before 1933. In 1933, almost two-thirds of these men were given political police positions in their towns or cities, or sent to Berlin as a part of the Gestapo Office. Streckenbach himself only entered the police force on 31 August 1931 as the leader of the SS-&quot;Sturmbanner&quot; in Hamburg, Streckenbach&#x27;s placement as chief of the Gestapo in Hamburg illustrates the “superficiality of professional continuity” – referring to the lack of qualifications many candidates possessed – as some historians characterize the Nazi Party&#x27;s seizure of power. For years, these young radical right-wing militants had been marginalized, but with the rise of the Nazis, they were now given the chance to pursue a career which preserved their radical and violent worldviews, and indeed encouraged such behaviour. Historian Bradley Smith argues that the Nazi seizure of power offered these young men, including Bruno Streckenbach, a career which abided by and even enhanced their radicalism, and provided professional advancements which they had failed to receive in their careers up to this point.

== In the invasion of Poland ==
Reinhard Heydrich and Himmler were always trying to expand their power and authority beyond the confines of the German Reich. In accordance with Hitler&#x27;s notion of &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, active persecution against Polish people, and long-term goals of “conquering extensive territories in the Soviet Union”, Hitler and other top Nazi leadership started preparing for a war, marked by the invasion of Poland. In preparation for the invasion of Poland, Heydrich expressed his ambition of having mobilized killing squads, a “fighting administration” as he put it.

The &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were in charge of securing German power and occupational authority in Poland through terror, furthering the ideology of ethnic cleansing and &quot;Lebensraum&quot; via deportations out of the occupied territory and mass executions within. The number of &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; corresponded to the Wehrmacht army units deployed. The leaders of the &quot;Sicherheitspolizei&quot; (SiPo; Security Police) in Berlin selected the office heads of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; very carefully, most of them being prior SD members or leaders. The members of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;— 500 men per &quot;Einsatzgruppe&quot;— were taken from local SS and police stations near the five units’ locations.

After the war, Bruno Streckenbach testified that Werner Best had directed deployment orders directly to him at the end of July or beginning of August. Streckenbach immediately left Hamburg to drive to Vienna, where he was deployed as head of &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot;. The German Wehrmacht invaded Poland on the morning of 1 September 1939. The &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; followed after them sending reports back to Berlin detailing the actions of Operation Tannenberg, the code name given to the anti-Polish extermination action carried out by the SD and SiPo in Poland during the opening weeks of the war. It was Streckenbach&#x27;s task to oversee four districts as &quot;Befehlshaber der Sicherheitspolizei im General Gouvernement&quot;: Warsaw, Krakow, Radom and Lublin. In each of these districts, thousands of Polish intellectuals—many former officers, professors, teachers, or politicians—were arrested and soon after, murdered. Streckenbach detailed the mission of the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;: they were to seize and destroy all political and racial enemy groups, such as leftists, Roma, Polish resistance and Jews. In addition, they were to report on and evaluate material seized during the campaign and to gather information from agents among the Soviet population. Streckenbach ordered all enemies of the Third Reich to be deported to concentration camps and there to be executed. Jews were especially singled out for &quot;Sonderbehandlung&quot; (&quot;special treatment&quot;), a process that entailed particularly brutal beatings. On 9 November 1941 he was promoted to &quot;SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei&quot;.

== Einsatzgruppen ==
By the end of 1939, the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were permanent units of the RSHA. Many members of the RSHA worked alongside the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; in implementing brutal violence and mass murder throughout Poland. In May 1940, thousands of Poles were reported as liquidated. At the end of this month, Streckenbach had reported that “sentencing by martial law” was completed, with over 8,500 persons–whether accused as being “career criminals” or summoned to “summary sentencing”–were either already executed or would be shortly.

During his time in Poland, he had earned a reputation as the ruthless chief, who fought with such determination and mercilessness to eradicate any, and all, Nazi opponents.

Historian Michael Wildt suggests a stark increase in the activation of Streckenbach&#x27;s radicalism from his time as a Gestapo chief in Hamburg to his first few months as the head of &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; in Poland. Wildt notes the difference in responsibilities, going from arrests, abuses, assaults and killings of prisoners to the mindset of extermination of large groups of people. More than just a racial justification, Wildt suggests that Streckenbach&#x27;s first few months as head of &quot;Einsatzgruppe I&quot; escalated into a murderous ideology that was inconceivable before this position.

Most of the previous SD men who were now employed in the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; had not inflicted such murderous activity on so many people up until this point. As Wildt suggests, the deployment in Poland for the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; was a defining moment for how policing matters were to be handled. It was these men&#x27;s “first experience as racist mass murderers”. The deportations to the General-Gouvernement came from the Reich as well as newly “Germanized” territories which Germany had taken from Poland, removed the local “opponents”–Jews, Poles, Roma, and “asocial persons”–and replaced with ethnic Germans. During the late months of 1939, a span of eight weeks consisted of the execution of over 60,000 people by the Nazi forces, including by the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;. Hitler insisted that this “harsh ethnic battle” could only be won without any internal resistance or legal restrictions upon implementation. Furthermore, the RSHA was the appropriate department for this “ethnic battle.&quot;

== German offensive on the Soviet Union ==
At the beginning of 1941, the attack on Soviet Union was first discussed among leaders of the RSHA. In March 1941, Heydrich informed a small circle of leaders, including Streckenbach, about the offensive that was to take place. The Wehrmacht army would lead and the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; would secure the area after Soviets had been defeated. Streckenbach volunteered his units but Heydrich decided differently.

Streckenbach had commissioned the Personnel and Administration Office Leaders, advising them to prepare for deployment. In May 1941, Streckenbach called on his long-time colleague Erwin Schulz to prepare his men in the Leadership School of the Security Police in Berlin-Charlottenberg for deployment after just having completed their training as Criminal Police inspectors. Streckenbach sent them to Pretzsch, where they were to assume leadership status of the Einsatzkommando. These young soldiers, many of them recent college graduates, came motivated to fight and impress authority. The &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; were divided and formed in Pretzsch in May 1941. Streckenbach, Müller and Heydrich had the most authority in dispersing directions of the &quot;Einsatzkommandos&quot; in Pretzsch leading up to the offensive on the Soviet Union. Furthermore, in Otto Ohlendorf&#x27;s Nuremberg Trial, he testified that Bruno Streckenbach had communicated the “order for the Final Solution” to the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;.

== Heydrich&#x27;s death impacts the RSHA ==
Himmler and Hitler&#x27;s actions following the assassination attempt and death of Heydrich were particularly vengeful. Hitler stated in reference to the Czechs who killed Heydrich, whenever you “kill someone, what results is always worse.” Streckenbach was called to Prague following the 4 June death of Heydrich. Himmler deemed the situation dire, the head of the RSHA having been killed with such abruptness.

Despite considering many leaders to assume Heydrich&#x27;s position, Himmler decided to lead the RSHA himself. While Himmler was the head of the RSHA, Streckenbach — along with each of the other RSHA office heads — had near-full autonomy in deciding the internal structure of their respective divisions. Himmler focused his efforts on ensuring that Western European Jews be sent to extermination camps as efficiently and completely as possible, allowing the office heads like Streckenbach to control how it was done.

At the end of July 1942, Himmler named Streckenbach his representative as the legal authority of the RSHA. This essentially gave the latter absolute authority in deciding disciplinary cases regarding members of the RSHA. After Streckenbach had served as RSHA chief for about six months, Himmler concluded that a successor had to be publicly named. Bruno Streckenbach&#x27;s responsibilities and qualifications were highly regarded and far exceeded expectations, and for this reason he was largely considered the best candidate for the position. Historian Tuviah Friedmann speculated that Himmler saw Streckenbach in some regards as having far too much power in his hands, possibly even seeing him as professional competition. To this day however, it is still unknown why Streckenbach was not appointed for the position of head of the RSHA, and Ernst Kaltenbrunner was chosen instead.

== After the RSHA ==
Hitler and Himmler wanted to name Streckenbach as the Senior SS and Police Leader of the Alpenland in Salzburg, Austria. Extremely disappointed, nonetheless, Streckenbach declined and in a personal letter to Himmler, requested to be placed in a military position.

Streckenbach trained in Hilversum, Holland with an antitank unit (as an &quot;Untersturmführer&quot;) in the beginning of 1943, and quickly advanced through the ranks of the Waffen-SS, even for being a senior SS leader. He was a regiment and division leader of the 8th SS Cavalry Division Florian Geyer and went on to lead the 19th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS (2nd Latvian) in the offensive against the Soviet Union in 1944 as a general. On 10 May 1945, Streckenbach and his division were taken prisoner in the Courland Pocket by the Soviet army. A Soviet military court sentenced him to 25 years in prison for war crimes. Streckenbach served his sentence at Vladimir Central Prison, and remained a Soviet prisoner of war until 9 October 1955, when he was sent back to Hamburg.

== Legal prosecution ==
When Streckenbach returned to Hamburg, he was informed that he faced charges for actions he had taken as the city&#x27;s Gestapo chief. He was accused of beating someone in the kidneys; however after further investigation, the state prosecutor could not obtain the appropriate documents which provided evidence of the charges.

During the Nuremberg Trials, Streckenbach&#x27;s name was continuously mentioned in court papers, among which was a testimony from Otto Ohlendorf who, as mentioned before, identified Streckenbach as one who had directed the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; towards implementation of the Final Solution. However, the Hamburg State Prosecutor&#x27;s Office concluded that there was not sufficient evidence to prove that his actions conflicted with the extant governing laws of the National Socialist rule. It was the case that many inhumane acts taken by the former Nazi members; as Wildt says, the assumption that National Socialism was synonymous with the “German Dictatorship rendered indivisible” the murderous acts that the party had taken in eastern and southern Europe and the Soviet Union.

In 1957, state prosecutors in Germany began discovering the unfathomable atrocities and millions of deaths of Soviet Jews culminating in the Ulm Einsatzkommando trial. This case prompted the 1959 establishment of the Central Office of State Justice Administration for the Investigation of National Socialist Crimes (&quot;Zentrale Stelle der Landesjustizverwaltungen zur Aufklärung der nationalsozialistischen Gewaltverbrechen&quot;) in Ludwigsburg. In the early 1960s, the office discovered a document providing evidence of deployment orders to Criminal Police and Gestapo officers that incited murderous activity. The court ordered the resumption of the investigation of crimes committed by Bruno Streckenbach.

On 30 June 1973, a bill of indictment for the murder of at least a million people was brought. Streckenbach, who was suffering from serious heart disease at the time, claimed ineligibility notwithstanding the strains a trial might place on his health. On 20 September 1974, the Hanseatic Appellate Court confirmed a diagnosis postponing trial commencement indefinitely. Bruno Streckenbach never had to answer for his part in the Nazi regime. He died on 28 October 1977 in Hamburg, Germany.

<doc id="848451" wikidata="Q3083164" url="?curid=848451" title="Feminine hygiene">
<text>Feminine hygiene products are personal care products used for women&#x27;s hygiene during menstruation, vaginal discharge, or other bodily functions related to the vulva and vagina. Products that are used during menstruation may also be called menstrual hygiene products, including menstrual pads, tampons, pantyliners, menstrual cups, menstrual sponges and period panties. Feminine hygiene products also include products meant to cleanse the vulva or vagina, such as douches, feminine wipes, and soap.

Feminine hygiene products are either disposable or reusable. Sanitary napkins, tampons, and pantyliners are disposable feminine hygiene products. Menstrual cups, cloth menstrual pads, period panties, and sponges are reusable feminine hygiene products.

==Types==
=== Menstrual hygiene products ===

Disposable:
*Menstrual pad: Made of absorbent material that is worn on the inside of underwear to absorb a heavier menstrual flow. They are made of cellulose and are available in many different absorbencies and lengths. They may have wings and/or an adhesive backing to hold the pad in place.
*Pantyliner: Similar to a menstrual pad, they are smaller, thinner and used for lighter periods, intermittent bleeding and vaginal discharge, or as a supplement to a tampon.
*Tampon: Inserted inside the vagina to absorb menstrual blood, can also be used while swimming, available in different levels of absorbency.

Reusable:
* Menstrual cup: Made of silicone, natural rubber, or plastic; is inserted inside the vagina to catch blood and/or uterine lining. Most are reusable: they are emptied when full and can be washed or boiled.
*Cloth menstrual pad: Worn inside underwear; can be made of materials such as cotton, flannel or terry cloth.
*Period underwear (AKA period panties): Can refer to either underwear that keeps pads in place, or absorbent underwear that can take the place of tampons and pads.
*Menstrual sponge: Inserted like a tampon or cup and worn inside the body.
*Towel: large reusable piece of cloth, most often used at night (if nothing else is available), placed between legs to absorb menstrual flow.
*Menstrual disc: is a reusable, medical-grade silicone product designed to collect menstrual fluid for up to 12 hours. Unlike traditional pads and tampons, it sits comfortably higher in the vaginal canal, offering a discreet, leak-free period experience. Safe for IUD users, cost-effective, and sustainable for over five years, often delivering a modern, eco-conscious solution for period care.

=== Cleansing products ===

*Douches: A fluid used to flush out the inside of the vagina.
*Feminine wipes: A moist, sometimes scented cloth used to wipe the vulva.
* Feminine hygiene products that are meant to cleanse may lead to allergic reaction and irritation, as the vagina naturally flushes out bacteria. Many health professionals advise against douching because it can change the balance of vaginal flora and acidity. Research shows that the vagina&#x27;s features allow it to naturally defend itself from harmful microorganisms. The innate defense mechanisms against vulvovaginal infections encompass the normal vaginal flora, acidic vaginal pH, and vaginal discharge. Resident bacteria play a crucial role in maintaining an acidic pH and outcompeting external pathogens for adhesion to the vaginal mucosa. Additionally, these bacteria defend against pathogens by generating antimicrobial compounds like bacteriocin. In vitro analysis of vaginal fluids from five women demonstrated activity against non-resident bacterial species, including Escherichia coli and Group B Streptococcus. This protection against Group B Streptococcus holds particular significance for pregnant women, as it commonly colonizes the vagina via the gastrointestinal tract, elevating the risk of preterm delivery, neonatal meningitis, and fetal death. Moreover, it may lead to asymptomatic bacteriuria, urinary tract infections, upper genital tract infections, and postpartum endometritis.
==Environmental impact==
The environmental impact of each product varies enormously:
In a lifetime, a menstruating person in developed countries can use between 5,000 and 15,000 pads and tampons creating about 400 pounds of packaging.

Worst in terms of environmental impact are tampons as they usually contain plastic or a blend of cotton and rayon and synthetic fibers, packaged in paper and plastic, may have plastic strings and plastic applicators, which cannot be recycled. the most environmentally friendly option is considered to be the menstrual cup.

== Health issues ==
The different products may carry different health risks, some of which might be proven, others speculative.

* Toxic shock syndrome: A rare illness that may occur when tampons are worn for long periods of time, although not directly linked to tampon use but caused by poison linked to bacteria of the &quot;Streptococcus pyogenes&quot; or &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot; type.
* Irritation: Can be caused by fragrances, neomycin (adhesive on pads), tea tree oil, benzocaine. Inflammation can also be a risk associated with some products.
* Yeast infection: A fungus.
* Bacterial vaginosis: Overgrowth of naturally occurring bacteria in the vagina that leads to a type of vaginal inflammation. The imbalance of bacteria from its natural state has been connected to bacterial vaginosis Bacterial vaginosis manifests as a uniform white/gray layer on the vaginal walls and vulva, accompanied by a fishy odor and a vaginal pH exceeding 4.5. The challenge of recurrence arises from the adaptive mechanisms of the bacteria and the inadequate re-establishment of normal vaginal flora.
* Exposure to chemicals: some period underwear companies (like Thinx, Ruby Love, and Knix) are facing class action lawsuits for products containing harmful toxins like per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) which may be linked to adverse health outcomes like cancer.

== The vulvovaginal area ==
The vulva acts as the initial defense line, shielding the genital tract from infections. Often, contaminants accumulate in the folds of the vulva, and factors like increased moisture, sweating, menstruation, and hormonal fluctuations can impact the growth and balance of microbial species, potentially leading to odor and vulvovaginal infections.

Distinct from other skin areas, vulvar skin exhibits variations in hydration, friction, permeability, and visible irritation. It is more susceptible to topical agents compared to forearm skin due to increased hydration, occlusion, and friction. The non-keratinized vulvar vestibule is likely more permeable than keratinized skin. Notably, genital skin is unique with a thin stratum corneum and large hair follicles, making it easier for microbes and substances to permeate.

The vagina, a fibromuscular canal extending from its external opening in the vulva to the cervix, is primarily composed of smooth muscle covered by a non-keratinized epithelial lining. This lining, until menopause, remains thick, kept moist by fluid from the vaginal wall and mucus from cervical and vestibular glands.

=== Vaginal discharge ===
Before reaching puberty until after menopause, women typically experience a natural and healthy occurrence of vaginal discharge. This discharge comprises bacteria, desquamated epithelial cells shedding from the vaginal walls, along with mucus and fluid (plasma) produced by the cervix and vagina. Throughout the menstrual cycle, the quantity and consistency of the discharge undergo variations. At the start and end of the cycle when estrogen levels are low, the discharge is dense, adhesive, and unwelcoming to sperm. As estrogen levels increase before ovulation, the discharge gradually becomes clearer, more liquid, and stretchier.

== Discrepancies in various ethnic groups ==
Feminine hygiene presents discrepancies in various ethnic groups. Differences in feminine hygiene practices are often associated with varying cultural beliefs and religious customs. Research indicates that Afro-Caribbean immigrants, in contrast to Caucasian women, are more inclined to cleanse the vulva with bubble bath or antiseptic. This practice aligns with the belief in the necessity of thorough body cleansing for health and well-being. Among Orthodox Jewish women, a ritual bath known as mikveh is performed after menstrual periods or childbirth to achieve ritual purity. In the Muslim faith, both men and women partake in a bathing ritual called full ablution (ghusl) after sexual intercourse or menstruation as a purification practice. In regions like Mozambique and South Africa, certain women opt for internal cleansing of their vaginas using substances such as lemon juice, saltwater, or vinegar with the intention of eliminating vaginal discharge and &quot;treating&quot; sexually transmitted diseases.

A research study involving 500 women in Iran revealed a notable association between bacterial vaginosis and inadequate menstrual and vaginal hygiene practices. Additionally, findings from a household survey conducted by Anand et al. indicated that women employing unhygienic methods during menstruation—excluding sanitary pads or locally prepared napkins—were 1.04 times more likely to report symptoms of reproductive tract infections. Furthermore, these women were 1.3 times more likely to experience abnormal vaginal discharge, encompassing symptoms like itching, vulvar irritation, lower abdomen pain, pain during urination or defecation, and low back pain. In another investigation, findings revealed that women engaging in the use of bubble bath on the vulva exhibited a twofold increase in the likelihood of experiencing bacterial vaginosis, in contrast to those who refrained from using this product. Furthermore, the occurrence of bacterial vaginosis was three times greater among women who applied antiseptic solutions to the vulva or within the vagina. Additionally, the frequency of bacterial vaginosis was six times higher in women utilizing a douching agent. When it comes to bacterial vaginosis, African American women are 2.9 times more likely to be diagnosed with bacterial vaginosis compared to women of European ancestry, possibly due to variations in their &quot;normal&quot; vaginal flora.

== Menstrual hygiene: the adolescent girl ==
To observe the menstrual hygiene in adolescent girls, a cross-sectional study conducted in a secondary school in Singur West Bengal involved 160 girls. the findings were published in 2008 and revealed that a significant portion of respondents became aware of menstruation before menarche, with mothers being the primary source of information. While the majority recognized menstruation as a physiological process, knowledge and usage of sanitary pads were limited. Most girls employed soap and water for cleaning purposes, and a considerable percentage observed various restrictions during menstruation. Among the 160 respondents, 108 (67%) girls were aware of menstruation before experiencing menarche. Mothers were the primary source of information for 60 (37.5%) girls. A majority, 138 (86%), considered menstruation a physiological process. Only 78 (48%) girls were familiar with the use of sanitary pads during menstruation. In terms of practices, merely 18 (11.25%) girls used sanitary pads during menstruation. For cleaning purposes, 156 (97%) girls utilized both soap and water. Regarding restrictions, 136 (85%) girls adhered to various restrictions during menstruation.

==Society and culture==
According to the World Health Organization, as of 2018 there are about 1.9 billion women who are of reproductive age. In low-income countries, women&#x27;s choices of menstrual hygiene materials are often limited by the costs, availability and social norms. Not only are women&#x27;s choices limited but, according to the WHO and UNICEF, 780 million people do not have access to improved water sources and about 2.5 billion people lack access to improved sanitation. The lack of proper hygiene leads to a harder time for women to manage feminine hygiene.

===Costs and tax===
Tampon tax is a shorthand for sales tax charged on tampons, pads, and menstrual cups. The cost of these commercial products for menstrual management is considered to be unacceptably high for many low-income women. At least half a million women across the world do not have enough money to adequately afford these products. This can result in missing days of school or even dropping out entirely in the worst cases. In some jurisdictions, similar necessities like medical devices and toilet paper are not taxed. Several initiatives worldwide advocate to eliminate the tax all together. In some countries, such petitions have already been successful (for example parts of the UK and the United States). The UK abolished the 5% minimum VAT imposed on sanitary products on 1 January 2021, as previously whilst a member of the European Union; EU law prohibited the UK or any EU member state from removing the 5% VAT imposed on sanitary products.

===Access to products in prisons===
The Federal Bureau of Prisons in the United States announced that women in its facilities would be guaranteed free menstrual pads and tampons. In section 411 of the First Step Act which was passed on May 22, 2018, states, &quot;The Director of the Bureau of Prisons shall make the healthcare products described in subsection (c) available to prisoners for free, in a quantity that is appropriate to the healthcare needs of each prisoner&quot;.

=== Other social views ===

Some girls and women may view tampons and menstrual cups as affecting their virginity even though they have not engaged in sexual intercourse.

For those with autism, using pads before menstruation begins may help reduce sensory issues associated with menstrual hygiene products. Prior education and practice may help familiarize an individual with body changes and the process of using products associated with menstruation.

Menstruation may occur despite paralyzation; product use depends on the individual&#x27;s personal preference.

== History ==
In ancient Egypt, the Roman Empire and Indonesia, various natural materials – wool, grass, papyrus – were used as tampons. In ancient Japan, the tampon was made of paper and held in place by a special binder called , and was changed up to 12 times a day.

In 18th-century Sweden, women in common society were not known to use feminine hygiene products and visible period stains on clothing did not attract much attention. A common expression for menstruation during this period was to &quot;wear the clothes&quot; or &quot;wear the &quot;, a chemise-like undergarment.

It is likely that pieces of cloth or special rags were used to collect the menstrual fluid. However, there are few records of menstrual pads from the pre-industrial era. As artifacts, the various types of menstrual pads have not been preserved or survived in any particular sense, as the cloths used were discarded when they became worn out or the need for them ceased with menopause. However, as technology evolved, commercial hygiene products were introduced in the form of the menstrual pad, also known as the sanitary napkin. In Sweden, this happened at the end of the 19th century and has been linked to an increased focus on cleanliness, personal hygiene and health that occurred in the early part of the 20th century in the wake of urbanization. By the end of the 19th century, the first commercial sanitary napkin had also been introduced on the American market by Johnson &amp; Johnson. It was a variant of the menstrual pad made of flannel.

Advertisements and product information for sanitary pads are the primary source of knowledge about the history of sanitary pads.
=== Early 20th-century commercial products ===
Sanitary napkins could be made of woven cotton, knitted or crocheted and filled with rags. They could be homemade for personal use or mass-produced and sold, such as in towns that had a textile industry.

The menstrual receptacle was the very earliest hygiene product to be launched as menstrual protection in Sweden, as early as 1879. It was made of rubber, like many of the hygiene articles of the time, and resembled a bowl-shaped casing that would sit on the outside of the abdomen. The menstrual receptacle is not considered to have gained much popularity.

The first half of the 20th century also saw the development of early intravaginal menstrual products similar to the menstrual cup, with an early patent dating from 1903.

Menstrual belts were another form that menstrual protection took and began to appear in the late 19th century. They were made so that the pad itself was contained in a special holder that was fastened around the waist with a belt. The pads in these designs are referred to as &quot;suction pads&quot; in Swedish patent documents, such as the &quot;Suction pad for menstruation&quot; patent from 1889. The price for a menstrual belt could be between 2.75 – 3.50 SEK and pads had to be purchased for about 4–5 SEK each, depending on the size of the pack. From the price information available, menstrual protection was likely a costly purchase that was not available to everyone.

The sanitary belt can be seen as a modern version of the menstrual belt, but more like a girdle. The function of the belt is to hold the pad in place while giving the user greater freedom of motion. In Sweden, the product was introduced in the 1940s and was in use until the 1960s. In the 1970s, the adhesive strip on the underside of the pad was introduced, allowing it to be attached to the underwear and held in place without the use of a girdle, safety pin or belt.

<doc id="848457" wikidata="Q9948893" url="?curid=848457" title="Arapaima">
<text>The arapaima, pirarucu, or paiche is any large species of bonytongue in the genus Arapaima native to the Amazon and Essequibo basins of South America. &quot;Arapaima&quot; is the type genus of the subfamily Arapaiminae within the family Osteoglossidae. They are among the world&#x27;s largest freshwater fish, reaching as much as in length. They are an important food fish. They have declined in the native range due to overfishing and habitat loss. In contrast, arapaima have been introduced to several tropical regions outside the native range (within South America and elsewhere), where they are sometimes considered invasive species. In Kerala, India, arapaima escaped from aquaculture ponds after floods in 2018. Its Portuguese name, &quot;pirarucu&quot;, derives from the Tupi language words &quot;pira&quot; and &quot;urucum&quot;, meaning &quot;red fish&quot;.

&quot;Arapaima&quot; was traditionally regarded as a monotypic genus, but later, several species were distinguished. As a consequence of this taxonomic confusion, most earlier studies were done using the name &quot;A. gigas&quot;, but this species is only known from old museum specimens and the exact native range is unclear. The regularly seen and studied species is &quot;A. arapaima&quot;, although a small number of &quot;A. leptosoma&quot; also have been recorded in the aquarium trade. The remaining species are virtually unknown: &quot;A. agassizii&quot; from old detailed drawings (the type specimen itself was lost during World War II bombings) and &quot;A. mapae&quot; from the type specimen. 

==Taxonomy==
FishBase recognizes four species in the genus. In addition to these, evidence suggests that a fifth species, &quot;A. arapaima&quot;, should be recognized (this being the widespread, well-known species, otherwise included in &quot;A. gigas&quot;).

* &quot;Arapaima agassizii&quot; (Agassiz&#x27;s arapaima)
* &quot;Arapaima gigas&quot; (&quot;pirarucu&quot;, arapaima)
* &quot;Arapaima leptosoma&quot; (slender arapaima; Solimoes arapaima)
* &quot;Arapaima mapae&quot; (Mapa arapaima)

These fish are widely dispersed and do not migrate, which leads scientists to suppose that more species are waiting to be discovered in the depths of the Amazon Basin harbors. Sites such as these offer the likelihood of diversity.

==Morphology==

Arapaima can reach lengths more than , in some exceptional cases even exceeding and over . The maximum recorded weight for the species is , while the longest recorded length verified was 3.07 m (10 ft 1 in). Anecdotal reports suggest that specimens as long as 4.57 m (15 ft 0 in) exist, but verification is deemed impossible, and thus considered questionable. As a result of overfishing, arapaima more than are seldom found in the wild.

The arapaima is torpedo-shaped, with large, blackish-green scales and red markings. It is streamlined and sleek, with its dorsal and anal fins set near its tail.

Arapaima scales have a mineralised, hard, outer layer with a corrugated surface under which lie several layers of collagen fibres in a Bouligand-type arrangement. In a structure similar to plywood, the fibres in each successive layer are oriented at large angles to those in the previous layer, increasing toughness. The hard, corrugated surface of the outer layer, and the tough internal collagen layers work synergistically to contribute to their ability to flex and deform while providing strength and protection—a solution that allows the fish to remain mobile while heavily armored. The arapaima has a fundamental dependence on surface air to breathe. In addition to gills, it has a modified and enlarged swim bladder, composed of lung-like tissue, which enables it to extract oxygen from the air.

==Ecology==
The diet of the arapaima consists of fish, crustaceans, fruits, seeds, insects, and small land animals that walk near the shore. The fish is an air breather, using its labyrinth organ, which is rich in blood vessels and opens into the fish&#x27;s mouth, an advantage in oxygen-deprived water that is often found in the Amazon River. This fish is able to survive in oxbow lakes with dissolved oxygen as low as 0.5 ppm. In the wetlands of the Araguaia, one of the most important refuges for this species, it is the top predator in such lakes during the low-water season, when the lakes are isolated from the rivers and oxygen levels drop, rendering its prey lethargic and vulnerable.

Arapaima may leap out of the water if they feel constrained by their environment or harassed.

==Life history/behavior==
===Reproduction===
Due to its geographic ranges, arapaima&#x27;s lifecycle is greatly affected by seasonal flooding. Various pictures show slightly different coloring owing to colour changes when they reproduce. The arapaima lays its eggs when water levels are low or beginning to rise. They build a nest about wide and deep, usually in muddy-bottomed areas. As the water rises, the eggs hatch and the offspring have the flood season from May to August in which to prosper, such that yearly spawning is regulated seasonally.

=== Breeding ===
The arapaima male is a mouthbrooder, like the related &quot;Osteoglossum&quot; genus, meaning the young are protected in his mouth until they are older. The female arapaima helps to protect the male and the young by circling them and fending off potential predators.

In his book, &quot;Three Singles to Adventure&quot;, naturalist Gerald Durrell reported that in British Guyana, female arapaima had been seen secreting a white substance from a gland in the head, and that their young were seemingly feeding on the substance.

==Evolution==
Some 23-million-year-old fossils of arapaima or a very similar species have been found in the Miocene Villavieja Formation of Colombia. Museum specimens are found in France, England, the United States, Brazil, Guyana, Ecuador and Perú. This makes them some of the oldest known species of freshwater fish.

==Relation to humans==
Arapaima is exploited in many ways by local human populations.

Its tongue is thought to have medicinal qualities in South America. It is dried and combined with guarana bark, which is grated and mixed into water. Doses are given to kill intestinal worms.
The bony tongue is used to scrape cylinders of dried guarana, an ingredient in some beverages, and the bony scales are used as nail files.

Arapaima produce boneless steaks and are considered a delicacy. In the Amazon region, locals often salt and dry the meat, rolling it into a cigar-style package that is then tied and can be stored without rotting, which is important in a region with little refrigeration. Arapaima are referred to as the &quot;cod of the Amazon&quot;, and can be prepared in the same way as traditional salted cod.

Designers have begun using the skin of the arapaima as leather to make jackets, shoes, and handbags, and to cover furniture.

In July 2009, villagers around Kenyir Lake in Terengganu, Malaysia, reported sighting &quot;A. gigas&quot;. The &quot;Kenyir monster&quot;, or &quot;dragon fish&quot; as the locals call it, was claimed to be responsible for the mysterious drowning of two men on 17June.

In August 2018, &quot;India Times&quot; reported that arapaima has been spotted in the Chalakudy River, following floods in Kerala; their presence in India is attributed to illegal importation for fish farming.

The arapaima is depicted on both the flag and the seal of the Department of Ucayali, Peru.

===Fishing===
Wild arapaima are harpooned or caught in large nets. Since the arapaima needs to surface to breathe air, traditional arapaima fishermen harpoon them and then club them to death. An individual fish can yield as much as of meat.

The arapaima was introduced for fishing in Thailand and Malaysia. Fishing in Thailand can be done in several lakes, where specimens over are often landed and then released.

On 14 May 2020, a 30 kg specimen was found floating in the river in Angkor Wat area, Krovanh village, Sangkat Norkor Thom, Siem Reap, Cambodia; the locals said it was a rare fish, and not commonly seen in this area.

With catch-and-release after the fish is landed, it must be held for 5 minutes until it takes a breath. The fish has a large blood vessel running down its spine, so lifting the fish clear of the water for trophy shots can rupture this vessel, causing death.

=== Aquaculture ===
In 2013, Whole Foods began selling farm-raised arapaima in the United States as a cheaper alternative to halibut or Chilean sea bass.

In Thailand, the only legal breeding farm is located in Tambon Phrong Maduea, Amphoe Mueang Nakhon Pathom, Nakhon Pathom Province. This has been approved by both the Department of Fisheries and CITES since early 2018, and has been exporting them worldwide as an aquarium fish.

=== Conservation ===
Arapaima are particularly vulnerable to overfishing because of their size and because they must surface periodically to breathe. Some 7000 tons per year were taken from 1918 to 1924, the height of commercial arapaima fishing; demand led to farming of the fish by native &quot;ribeirinhos&quot;. As efforts at restricting catches were largely unsuccessful, arapaima fishing was banned outright in Brazil in 1996, due to declining populations. Indeed, a 2014 study found that the fish were depleted or overexploited at 93% of the sites examined and well-managed or unfished in only 7%; the fish appeared to be extirpated in 19% of these sites. The status of the arapaima population in the Amazon River Basin is unknown, hence it is listed on the IUCN red list as data deficient. Conducting a population census in so large an area is difficult, as is monitoring catches in a trade that was once largely unregulated. Since 1999, both subsistence and commercial fishing have been permitted in specially designated areas under a sophisticated sustainable management strategy. This approach has led to massive recovery of once-depleted stocks; in a sampling of 10 areas conducted using traditional counting methods, the population was found to have grown from 2,500 in 1999 to over 170,000 in 2017.

Colombia only bans fishing and consumption of the arapaima between October 1 and March 15, during breeding season.

<text>The reaper-binder, or binder, is a farm implement that improved upon the simple reaper. The binder was invented in 1872 by Charles Baxter Withington, a jeweler from Janesville, Wisconsin. In addition to cutting the small-grain crop, a binder also &#x27;binds&#x27; the stems into bundles or . These sheaves are usually then &#x27;shocked&#x27; into A-shaped conical stooks, resembling small tipis, to allow the grain to dry for several days before being picked up and threshed.

Withington&#x27;s original binder used wire to tie the bundles. There were problems with using wire and it was not long before William Deering invented a binder that successfully used twine and a knotter (invented in 1858 by John Appleby).

Early binders were horse-drawn, their cutting and tying-mechanisms powered by a bull-wheel, that through the traction of being pulled forward creates rotational forces to operate the mechanical components of the machine. Later models were tractor-drawn and some were tractor-powered. (This mechanical power transfer is commonly referred to as a PTO or power take-off device.) Binders have a reel and a sickle bar, like a modern grain head for a combine harvester. The cut stems fall onto a canvas bed which conveys the cut stems to the binding mechanism. This mechanism bundles the stems of grain and ties the bundle with string to form a sheaf. Once tied, the sheaf is discharged from the side of the binder, to be picked up by the &#x27;stookers&#x27;.

With the replacement of the threshing machine by the combine harvester, the binder has become almost obsolete. Some grain crops such as oats are now cut and formed into windrows with a swather. With other grain crops, such as wheat, the grain is now mostly cut and threshed by a combine in a single operation, but the much lighter binder is still in use in small fields or mountain areas too steep or inaccessible for heavy combines.

Reaper-binders were in wide use in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland, but farmers often could not operate them due to shortages of twine and a lack of replacement parts. This was such a regular occurrence that baling twine () remains a symbol of the dysfunction of the communist economy in the cultural memory of Poland.

<text>Marquis is a Germany- based fetish magazine originally produced by Peter W. Czernich since 1994. For around 25 years, the magazine was published under his auspices. First, the magazine ceased publication in 2015 with issue 63. Then, in 2016, issue 64 appeared after an economic restructuring. Czernich&#x27;s last issue as editor-in-chief in charge was issue 67, the 25th anniversary issue. Czernich&#x27;s original publishing venture entitled &quot;«O»&quot; began as a spin-off of the British &quot;Skin Two&quot; magazine but quickly developed its own identity. After losing the right to the &quot;«O»&quot; name, Czernich created &quot;Marquis&quot; in 1994. It has continued to be published semiannually-to-quarterly ever since.

== The Time after Peter W. Czernich ==
In 2019, the magazine was sold to the U-Line publishing house, which had mainly appeared with its imprint &quot;Ubooks&quot; in the years before. &quot;Marquis&quot; issue 68 was released in March 2020. Peter W. Czernich remained on board as creative consultant and photographer, but the owner of U-Line Verlag, Andreas Reichardt, was now responsible. In the first issue under new management, the cabaret artist Lisa Eckhart, among others, could be won for an exclusive interview along with a photo shoot in latex.

&quot;Marquis&quot; magazine is published semi- to quarterly. It is mainly made for fetish, latex and fashion lovers. Topics include photography, models, books, films, fashion and lifestyle. The name of the magazine refers to the Marquis de Sade. The first issue was published in 1994 as a successor to the magazine &quot;O&quot;. 

== &quot;Heavy Rubber&quot; ==
The magazine &quot;Heavy Rubber&quot; was created as a spin-off in 1996. While &quot;Marquis&quot; magazine focuses more on fashion, mainstream and glamour, &quot;Heavy Rubber&quot; is clearly aimed at fetishists. It is all about latex, rubber as a source of erotic pleasure.

<text>Iris Maud du Pré (née Greep; 3 June 1914 – 27 September 1985) was an English pianist, composer, conductor and educator. She was the mother of cellist Jacqueline du Pré, flautist Hilary du Pré, and Piers du Pré.

==Life and career==
Iris Maud Greep was born in Plymouth, Devon, in 1914. She was the daughter of Maud (&quot;née&quot; Mitchell) and William Greep, a shipbuilder. She started learning the piano at the age of seven. Having acquired a reputation as a gifted pianist, at age eighteen in 1932 she won a scholarship to the London School of Dalcroze Eurhythmics where she studied for two years before winning a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, where she studied piano and composition.

Her performance career was disrupted by the events of World War II. Du Pré then started teaching and travelling. In 1940, she married Derek du Pré (1908-1990), an assistant editor at &quot;The Accountant&quot; whom she met by chance in 1938 in Poland where he was travelling and she was attending a summer course given by the pianist Egon Petri. Du Pré&#x27;s compositions were included in London performances of the &quot;Ballet de la jeunesse anglaise&quot; in autumn 1941.

In 1942 their first daughter, Hilary du Pré, was born, and in 1945 they had a second daughter, Jacqueline du Pré. Their son, Piers, was born in 1948.

As a music teacher, she recognised her two daughters&#x27; talents and she started their musical education early with Jacqueline learning the cello from age four. Du Pré taught music in the public sector as well at places like Apsley Grammar School, Hemel Hempstead during the 1970s.

Her daughter Jacqueline became a world-renowned musician until she was struck with multiple sclerosis, which ended her life in 1987.

In the 1998 Oscar-nominated film &quot;Hilary and Jackie&quot;, Iris du Pré is portrayed by Celia Imrie.

Du Pré died of cancer on 27 September 1985 in Ashmansworth, Hampshire at the age of 71.

<text>Arthur Holmes (14 January 1890 – 20 September 1965) was an English geologist who made two major contributions to the understanding of geology. He pioneered the use of radiometric dating of minerals, and was the first earth scientist to grasp the mechanical and thermal implications of mantle convection, which led eventually to the acceptance of plate tectonics.

==Life==
He was born in Hebburn, County Durham, near Newcastle upon Tyne, the son of David Holmes, a cabinet-maker, and his wife, Emily Dickinson.

As a child, he lived in Low Fell, Gateshead, and attended the Gateshead Higher Grade School (later Gateshead Grammar School). At 17, he enrolled to study physics at the Royal College of Science (now Imperial College London), but took a course in geology in his second year, which settled his future, against the advice of his tutors. After graduation, he took a job prospecting for minerals in Mozambique. After six months, with no discoveries, he became so ill with malaria that a notice of his death was posted home. However, he recovered enough to catch the boat home and became a demonstrator at Imperial College.

He obtained his Doctorate of Science in 1917, and in 1920 he joined an oil company in Burma as chief geologist. The company failed, and he returned to England penniless in 1924. He had been accompanied in Burma by his three-year-old son, who contracted dysentery and died shortly before Holmes&#x27;s departure.

He was head of the Department of Geology, Durham University, 1924–1943. He held the chair of geology at the University of Edinburgh from 1943–1956.

Holmes died at 20 St John&#x27;s Avenue in Putney, London, on 20 September 1965. He was 75.

==Personal life==
He married his first wife, Margaret Howe, in 1914. After she died in 1938, Holmes in the following year married Doris Reynolds, a geologist who had joined the teaching staff at Durham. After his death, she edited the third edition of the &quot;Principles&quot;.

==Age of the Earth==
Holmes was a pioneer of geochronology, and performed the first accurate uranium-lead radiometric dating (specifically designed to measure the age of a rock) while an undergraduate in London, assigning an age of 370 Ma to a Devonian rock from Norway, improving on the work of Boltwood who published nothing more on the subject. This result was published in 1911, after his graduation in 1910.

1912 saw Holmes on the staff of Imperial College, publishing his famous book &quot;The Age of the Earth&quot; in 1913 in which he argued strongly for radioactive methods compared with methods based on geological sedimentation or cooling of the earth (many people still clung to Lord Kelvin&#x27;s calculations of less than 100 Ma). He estimated the oldest Archean rocks to be 1,600 Ma, but did not speculate about the Earth&#x27;s age. By this time the discovery of isotopes had complicated the calculations and he spent the next years grappling with these. His promotion of the theory over the next decades earned him the nickname of &quot;Father of modern geochronology&quot;. By 1927 he had revised this figure to 3,000 Ma and in the 1940s to 4,500±100 Ma, based on measurements of the relative abundance of uranium isotopes by Alfred O. C. Nier. The general method is now known as the &quot;Holmes-Houterman model&quot; after Fritz Houtermans who published in the same year, 1946.

In 1924 he was appointed to the newly created post of reader in geology at Durham University. Eighteen years later his achievements were recognised, when he became a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1942. In the following year he was appointed to the chair of geology at the University of Edinburgh, following the death of Prof Thomas James Jehu, which post he held until retirement in 1956. In 1944 he published the first edition of his &quot;Principles of Physical Geology&quot; which became a standard textbook in the UK and elsewhere.

==Continental drift==

Holmes championed the theory of continental drift promoted by Alfred Wegener at a time when it was deeply unfashionable with his more conservative peers. One problem with the theory lay in the mechanism of movement, and Holmes proposed that Earth&#x27;s mantle contained convection cells that dissipated radioactive heat and moved the crust at the surface. His &quot;Principles of Physical Geology&quot; ended with a chapter on continental drift. Part of the model was the origin of the seafloor spreading concept.

==Honours and awards==
Honours included:
* 1940 Murchison Medal, Geological Society of London
* 1946 Sederholm Medal, Geological Society of Finland
* 1955 Foreign Member Académie des sciences, Institut de France
* 1956 Penrose Medal, Geological Society of America
* 1956 Wollaston Medal, Geological Society of London
* 1962 Makdougall Brisbane Medal, Royal Society of Edinburgh
* 1964 Vetlesen Prize, Columbia University

The Arthur Holmes Medal of the European Geosciences Union and a crater on Mars have been named in his honour. The Durham University Department of Earth Sciences&#x27; Isotope Geology Laboratory is also named after him, as is the students&#x27; Geology Society.

&quot;Editor note: Honours is honors it&#x27;s just British spelling for all of you Americans out there, this is not intended to be part of the main topic but it&#x27;s just a quick reminder for the Americans. Pls don&#x27;t remove this mods. ;)&quot;

<doc id="848478" wikidata="Q1651801" url="?curid=848478" title="Willy Bach, Baron Bach">
<text>William Stephen Goulden &quot;Willy&quot; Bach, Baron Bach (born 25 December 1946) is a British Labour member of the House of Lords. He was a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Justice from 2008 to 2010. He resigned from the opposition front bench when he was elected the Leicestershire Police and Crime Commissioner on 6 May 2016. He did not stand again at the 2021 PCC election and was succeeded by the Conservative Rupert Matthews.

==Early life==
Bach was educated at Westminster School, then an all-boys public school located within the precincts of Westminster Abbey. He studied at New College, Oxford, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree. In 1972, he was called to the Bar, and then worked as a barrister. He went on to become head of barristers&#x27; chambers at King Street Chambers in Leicester on the Midland Circuit in 1996. He also was a councillor in Leicester and Harborough.

==Political career==
Bach was the unsuccessful Labour parliamentary candidate for Gainsborough in 1979 and for Sherwood in both the 1983 and 1987 general elections.

On 27 July 1998, Bach was created a life peer, as Baron Bach, &quot;of Lutterworth in the County of Leicestershire&quot;, where he lives. He was appointed a Government Whip in the Lords exactly one year later on 27 July 1999 in the 1999 government reshuffle, thereby enjoying the office as one of Her Majesty&#x27;s Lords in Waiting.

From November 2000, Lord Bach served as a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s Department, until June 8, 2001 when, after the general election, Lord Bach replaced The Baroness Symons of Vernham Dean as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defence Procurement.

During Lord Bach&#x27;s tenure, the United Kingdom was involved in choosing between the Boeing X-32 and Lockheed X-35 designs for the Joint Strike Fighter project. Highlighting the level of British participation in the project, Lord Bach was present at the United States Department of Defense announcement that Lockheed Martin had won the competition. Lord Bach was also at the signing of &quot;Type Acceptance&quot; – essentially, the release into service – of the RAF&#x27;s Typhoon platform.

Following the 2005 general election, Lord Drayson succeeded Lord Bach at the Ministry of Defence, and Lord Bach was transferred to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State responsible for Sustainable Farming and Food. He held this post until 2006, when he returned to the back benches. As of 5 October 2008, Lord Bach was brought back into government as Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice replacing former Lord Hunt of Kings Heath OBE.

Lord Bach was chairman of the SELEX Sensors and Airborne Systems SpA Board of Directors and Director (UK) of Italian arms company Finmeccanica until 2007, when he resigned from the board in order to return to his role as a government whip. In October 2008, Lord Bach was promoted to become a Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State in the Ministry of Justice, where he served until May 2010.

In October 2013, Lord Bach became a Shadow Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister on the Official Opposition frontbench headed by Ed Miliband. On 3 December 2014, he took on the additional role of Shadow Attorney General following the resignation of Emily Thornberry. He was replaced by Catherine McKinnell after the election of Jeremy Corbyn as Labour Party leader.

== The Bach Commission ==
The Bach Commission was founded at the end of 2015, and worked to find evidence on the current legal aid crisis in the UK justice system. Lord Bach chairs this commission, with Sir Henry Brooke as vice-chair. The Commission argued that LASPO had severely affected access to justice, and identified six key features in the justice system to demonstrate this.

== Personal life ==
In &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot;, Lord Bach listed his interests as watching cricket and football (he is a supporter of Leicester City FC). He is married, with three children. He is also a great-nephew of suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst.

<doc id="848480" wikidata="Q16205183" url="?curid=848480" title="David Brent">
<text>David Brent is a fictional character in the BBC television mockumentary &quot;The Office&quot;, portrayed by the show&#x27;s co-creator, co-writer, and co-director Ricky Gervais. Brent is a white-collar office middle-manager and the principal character of the series. He is the general manager of the Slough branch of Wernham Hogg paper merchants and the boss of most other characters in the series. Much of the comedy of the series centres on Brent&#x27;s many idiosyncrasies, hypocrisies, self-delusions, and overt self-promotion.

== Character ==

Gervais came up with the basic idea of Brent several years before &quot;The Office&quot;&#x27;s debut in 2001. &quot;David Brent was like a Frankenstein of all the people I&#x27;d met in my adult life. He was just a guy who wanted to be loved.&quot; Gervais based the filming format on reality-television series such as &quot;Airport&quot;. He had also worked in an office environment for almost ten years.

Brent is presented as an employer who wholeheartedly believes that his employees love him, whereas in fact, apart from Gareth Keenan, they actually resent him. This is best noticed in the Series 1 finale, where Brent betrays his staff and accepts a promotion to higher management, saving his own skin from the inevitable downsizing that will befall the Slough branch as a consequence. Brent is later forced to turn the position down after failing a medical examination, but he insists to his employees that he failed it on purpose to save the branch.

Despite being the manager, Brent is totally spineless when it comes to confrontation. This is best seen through the character of Chris Finch, who Brent views unconditionally as his best friend despite his appalling attitude towards women and his many chances at ridiculing Brent as well as his staff. Brent&#x27;s inability to stand up for himself or his staff members properly and professionally often results in him lashing out at his employees, pointing out their weight or age if his own is brought to ridicule.

In the second series, Neil Godwin, manager of the Swindon branch, is given Brent&#x27;s promotion. Neil is shown to be everything that Brent is not, which provokes Brent&#x27;s insecurity and jealousy. Neil effortlessly bonds with Brent&#x27;s staff and earns their trust, perhaps best shown when a payroll issue is brought to Neil&#x27;s attention, essentially going over Brent&#x27;s head. Brent&#x27;s dismissive attitude to key issues such as this culminates in a later confrontation with Neil and Jennifer when Brent fails to produce a report he promised to do. When given an official warning, Brent recklessly challenges Neil in an effort motivated by his hurt pride, stating that his removal from managing the Slough branch would result in a staff uprising. This, however, proves to be totally baseless, as when Neil and Jennifer announce that Brent will be made redundant, his staff are shown to be completely unconcerned and even relieved by the news.

Despite his unlikeable nature, Brent is not wholly perceived as insufferable. Instead, Brent is shown as the increasingly tragic figure of the series: a lonely man without any friends, goals or achievements who would rather please everybody around him even if it is met at his own expense. Of these key moments where sympathy is garnered for Brent, perhaps one of the most crucial scenes is when Brent begs Neil and Jennifer to reconsider their decision to make him redundant, after a secondary role as a motivational speaker falls through.

In the Christmas special, Brent is working as a travelling salesman following his dismissal from Wernham Hogg, but he remains emotionally attached to his old workplace and constantly visits the office during working hours, eventually resulting in Neil banning him from the premises. He earns additional income on the side from Z-list celebrity appearances at various club nights trading on the minor fame the documentary series has given him, but he is frequently met with heckles and abuse from the crowds and gradually hits an emotional low. He is allowed to attend the Wernham Hogg Christmas party that ends the special, at which he meets a blind date who genuinely enjoys his company and says she would go out with him again. In higher spirits, Brent is later shown bonding with his former colleagues and finally succeeds in making them laugh when they take a group photo together.

== Appearances outside &quot;The Office&quot; ==
In 2002, Gervais wrote an in-character piece for the BBC website on &quot;what makes a winner&quot; of the FA Cup. He said, &quot;Managing a Premiership football team is a bit like running a successful paper merchant. There&#x27;s a lot of similarities. I have to pick the right team, I have to lead by example, I have to instil trust and discipline.&quot;

In 2004, Gervais and Stephen Merchant (who co-created the show and the Brent character) put together two videos for Microsoft in the UK entitled &quot;The Office Values&quot;, in which David Brent is brought in as a motivational speaker. In the videos, Brent repeatedly shows a deep hatred for Bill Gates, at one point calling him a litterbug. Additionally, Brent plays a guitar song about the ills of technology versus the human condition, elaborates upon his desire for a comedy show (such as by impersonating Max Wall) and repeatedly makes fun of Jeff (Merchant&#x27;s character), calling him a dweeb and a nerd for using the big word &quot;&quot;. This culminates in an appraisal in which Jeff repeatedly insults Brent, calling him an idiot, ill-informed, ill-educated and a shaved baboon in a suit, among others.

Intended as internal training videos, the two videos were leaked online in August 2006 and Microsoft was reportedly unhappy about the leak.

At Wembley Stadium on 1 July 2007, Ricky Gervais performed as David Brent at the Concert for Diana. Alongside Mackenzie Crook as Gareth, Gervais performed a rendition of the song &quot;Freelove Freeway&quot; from episode four of &quot;The Office&quot;.

In 2009, Ricky Gervais appeared on &quot;Inside the Actors Studio&quot;, in which the host James Lipton asked if he could interview Gervais in character as David Brent for a brief period in the show. Gervais went on to perform a shortened version of the song &quot;Freelove Freeway&quot;.

Brent made two brief appearances in the American version of &quot;The Office&quot;. In the season 7 episode &quot;The Seminar&quot;, he meets his American counterpart Michael Scott (Steve Carell) while coming out of a lift the latter is waiting for. Unsurprisingly, the two develop an instant rapport. David learns that Michael manages the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin (the paper company that is the equivalent of Wernham Hogg in the UK series) and asks if there are any jobs available there, but is told there are no openings at the moment. In the final episode of the same season, &quot;Search Committee&quot;, Brent appears (via pre-recorded video resumé) as an interviewee for the Scranton manager&#x27;s job, following Michael Scott&#x27;s departure from the show several episodes earlier. In addition to appearing in the latter episode, Gervais contributed to the script.

In March 2013, the BBC broadcast a mini-episode called &quot;The Office Revisited&quot; for Comic Relief 2013, a charity fund-raising event.

After ten years, Gervais revived the character for his YouTube channel in the web series &quot;Learn Guitar with David Brent.&quot; In each episode he plays the guitar, gives tips on how to play and answers fan questions. Among the songs he has played are &quot;Freelove Freeway&quot;, &quot;Spaceman&quot;, &quot;Ooh La La&quot; and &quot;Life on the Road&quot;.

On 5 August 2014, it was announced that Gervais would reprise the role of Brent for a film titled &quot;David Brent: Life on the Road&quot;, which features the character as he tours the UK with his band Foregone Conclusion. The film was released in August 2016.

In August 2016, David Brent and Foregone Conclusion released the album &quot;Life on the Road&quot;. On 13 August 2016, Gervais appeared on the Dermot O&#x27;Leary show on BBC Radio 2 to publicise this album. Gervais was initially interviewed as himself and then after a short music interlude, O&#x27;Leary interviewed David Brent about the album release, and gave a stripped back acoustic session, playing the tracks &quot;Life on the Road&quot; and &quot;Slough&quot;.

<doc id="848489" wikidata="Q14637172" url="?curid=848489" title="Colonial India">
<text>Colonial India was the part of the Indian subcontinent that was occupied by European colonial powers during and after the Age of Discovery. European power was exerted both by conquest and trade, especially in spices. The search for the wealth and prosperity of India led to the colonisation of the Americas after Christopher Columbus went to the Americas in 1492. Only a few years later, near the end of the 15th century, Portuguese sailor Vasco da Gama became the first European to re-establish direct trade links with India by being the first to arrive by circumnavigating Africa (). Having arrived in Calicut, which by then was one of the major trading ports of the eastern world, he obtained permission to trade in the city from the Saamoothiris (Zamorins). The next to arrive were the Dutch, with their main base in Ceylon. Their expansion into India was halted after their defeat in the Battle of Colachel to the Kingdom of Travancore, during the Travancore–Dutch War.

Trading rivalries among the seafaring European powers brought other coastal powers from the empires of Europe to India. The Dutch Republic, England, France, and Denmark–Norway all established trading posts in India in the early 17th century. As the Mughal Empire disintegrated in the early 18th century, and then as the Maratha Empire became weakened after the third battle of Panipat, many relatively weak and unstable Indian states which emerged were increasingly open to manipulation by the Europeans, through dependent Indian rulers.

In the later 18th century, Great Britain and France struggled for dominance, partly through proxy Indian rulers but also by direct military intervention. The defeat of the formidable Indian ruler Tipu Sultan in 1799 marginalised the French influence. This was followed by a rapid expansion of British power through the greater part of the Indian subcontinent in the early 19th century. By the middle of the century, the British had already gained direct or indirect control over almost all parts of India. British India, consisting of the directly ruled British presidencies and provinces, contained the most populous and valuable parts of the British Empire and thus became known as &quot;the jewel in the British crown&quot;.

India, during its colonial era, was a founding member of the League of Nations, a participating nation in the Summer Olympics in 1900, 1920, 1928, 1932, and 1936, and a founding member of the United Nations in San Francisco in 1945. In 1947, India gained its independence and was partitioned into the Dominion of India and the Dominion of Pakistan, the latter of which was created as a homeland for colonial India&#x27;s Muslims.

== Portuguese ==
The Portuguese, first arriving by ship in May 1498, began establishing trading outposts in India. 
The first successful voyage to India was by Vasco da Gama in 1498, when after sailing around the Cape of Good Hope he arrived in Calicut, now in Kerala. Having arrived there, he obtained permission from Saamoothiri Rajah to trade in the city. The navigator was received with traditional hospitality, but an interview with the Saamoothiri (Zamorin) failed to produce any definitive results. Vasco da Gama requested permission to leave a factor behind in charge of the merchandise he could not sell; his request was refused, and the king insisted that Gama should pay customs duty like any other trader, which strained their relations. The ruler of the Kingdom of Tanur, who was a vassal to the Zamorin of Calicut, sided with the Portuguese, against his overlord at Calicut. As a result, the Kingdom of Tanur (&quot;Vettathunadu&quot;) became one of the earliest Portuguese allies in India. The ruler of Tanur also sided with Cochin. Many of the members of the royal family of Cochin in 16th and 17th members were selected from Vettom. However, the Tanur forces under the king fought for the Zamorin of Calicut in the Battle of Cochin (1504). However, the allegiance of the Mappila merchants in Tanur region still stayed under the Zamorin of Calicut.

Francisco de Almeida was appointed Viceroy of India in 1505. During his reign, the Portuguese dominated Kochi and established a few fortresses on the Malabar Coast. The Portuguese suffered setbacks from attacks by Zamorin forces in South Malabar; especially from naval attacks under the leadership of Calicut admirals known as Kunjali Marakkars, which compelled them to seek a treaty. The Kunjali Marakkars were credited with organizing the first naval defence of the Indian coast. &quot;Tuhfat Ul Mujahideen&quot; written by Zainuddin Makhdoom II (born around 1532) of Ponnani in 16th-century CE is the first-ever known book fully based on the history of Kerala, written by a Keralite. It is written in Arabic and contains pieces of information about the resistance put up by the navy of Kunjali Marakkar alongside the Zamorin of Calicut from 1498 to 1583 against Portuguese attempts to colonise Malabar coast. In 1571, the Portuguese were defeated by the Zamorin forces in the battle at Chaliyam Fort.
Though Portugal&#x27;s presence in India initially started in 1498, their colonial rule lasted from 1505 until 1961. The Portuguese Empire established the first European trading centre at Quilon (Kollam) in 1502. It is believed that the colonial era in India started with the establishment of this Portuguese trading centre at Quilon. In 1505, King Manuel I of Portugal appointed Dom Francisco de Almeida as the first Portuguese viceroy in India, followed in 1509 by Dom Afonso de Albuquerque. In 1510, Albuquerque conquered the city of Goa, which had been controlled by Muslims. He inaugurated the policy of marrying Portuguese men with native women who had converted to Catholicism, the consequence of which was a great miscegenation in Goa and other Portuguese territories in Asia. The first revolt against the Portuguese was the Conspiracy of the Pintos in 1787. 

For decades after, the Conspiracy was used as a stick to defame and denigrate Goan missionaries and priests in British India by their opponents, the Vicars Apostolic of the Propaganda party, Goans being of the Padroado party. The incident was used to represent the Goans to the British government and to the Christians in British India as untrustworthy, rebellious and willing to compromise with their own enemies (Tipu Sultan). This became Goa&#x27;s black legend.

Abbé Faria teamed up with the revolutionaries of the French Revolution and participated along with the &quot;juring&quot; clerics in the Revolutionaries&#x27; brutal persecution of the Catholic Church in France and elsewhere. Two Pinto brothers Lt. Col Francisco and Jose Antonio joined the army of the Maratha Empire under Baji Rao II and fought against the British in the Second Anglo-Maratha War and Third Anglo-Maratha War.

While the revolt failed, Goans did achieve stronger forms of Government and when the Portuguese Constitution of 1822 was adopted, two native Goans Bernardo Peres da Silva and Constâncio Roque da Costa were elected to the first parliament in Portugal, a practice that continued till the Annexation of Goa in 1961

An account of this was done by the Portuguese civil servant Joaquim Heliodoro da Cunha Rivara which is one of the major accounts of the Pinto Revolt and subsequently translated into English by Dr. Charles Borges.
Goa was annexed by India on 19 December 1961. Another feature of the Portuguese presence in India was their promotion of Catholicism by sponsoring missionaries from various orders, such as the Jesuit missionary Saint Francis Xavier, who is revered among the Catholics of India.

== Dutch ==

The Dutch East India Company established trading posts along different parts of the Indian coast. For some time, they controlled the Malabar southwest coast (Pallipuram, Cochin, Cochin de Baixo/Santa Cruz, Quilon (Coylan), Cannanore, Kundapura, Kayamkulam, Ponnani) and the Coromandel southeastern coast (Golkonda, Bhimunipatnam, Pulicat, Parangippettai, Negapatnam) and Surat (1616–1795). They conquered Ceylon from the Portuguese. The Dutch also established trading stations in Travancore and coastal Tamil Nadu as well as at Rajshahi in present-day Bangladesh, Hugli-Chinsura, and Murshidabad in present-day West Bengal, Balasore (Baleshwar or Bellasoor) in Odisha, and Ava, Arakan, and Syriam in present-day Myanmar (Burma). However, their expansion into India was halted, after their defeat in the Battle of Colachel to the Kingdom of Travancore, during the Travancore-Dutch War. The Dutch never recovered from the defeat and no longer posed a large colonial threat to India.

Ceylon was lost at the Congress of Vienna in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars, where the Dutch having fallen subject to France, saw their colonies captured by Britain. The Dutch later became less involved in India, as they had the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia).

==English and British India==

===Rivalry with the Netherlands===
At the end of the 16th century, England and the United Netherlands began to challenge Portugal&#x27;s monopoly of trade with Asia, forming private joint-stock companies to finance the voyages: the English (later British) East India Company, and the Dutch East India Company, were chartered in 1600 and 1602 respectively. These companies were intended to carry on the lucrative spice trade, and they focused their efforts on the areas of production, especially the Indonesian archipelago the &quot;Spice Islands&quot;, and on India as an important market for the trade. The close proximity of London and Amsterdam across the North Sea, and the intense rivalry between England and the Netherlands, inevitably led to conflict between the two companies, with the Dutch gaining the upper hand in the Moluccas (previously a Portuguese stronghold) after the withdrawal of the English in 1622, but with the English enjoying more success in India, at Surat, after the establishment of a factory in 1613.
The Netherlands&#x27; more advanced financial system and the three Anglo-Dutch Wars of the 17th century left the Dutch as the dominant naval and trading power in Asia. Hostilities ceased after the Glorious Revolution of 1688, when the Dutch prince William of Orange ascended the English throne, bringing peace between the Netherlands and England. A deal between the two nations left the more valuable spice trade of the Indonesian archipelago to the Netherlands and the textiles industry of India to England, but textiles overtook spices in terms of profitability, so that by 1720, in terms of sales, the English company had overtaken the Dutch. The English East India Company shifted its focus from Surat—a hub of the spice trade network—to Fort St. George.

===East India Company===

In 1757, Mir Jafar, the commander-in-chief of the army of the Nawab of Bengal, along with Jagat Seth and some others secretly working with the British, asked for their support to overthrow the Nawab in return for trade grants. The British forces, whose sole duty until then was guarding Company property, were numerically inferior to the Bengali armed forces. At the Battle of Plassey on 23 June 1757, fought between the British under the command of Robert Clive and the Nawab, Mir Jafar&#x27;s forces betrayed the Nawab and helped them to defeat him. Jafar was installed on the throne as a British subservient ruler. The battle transformed British perspective as they realised their strength and potential to conquer smaller Indian kingdoms and marked the beginning of the imperial or colonial era in South Asia.

British policy in Asia during the 19th century was chiefly concerned with expanding and protecting its hold on India, viewed as its most important colony and the key to the rest of Asia. The East India Company drove the expansion of the British Empire in Asia. The company&#x27;s army had first joined forces with the Royal Navy during the Seven Years&#x27; War, and the two continued to cooperate in arenas outside India: against the French campaign in Egypt and Syria, the capture of Java from the Netherlands in 1811, the acquisition of Singapore in 1819 and Malacca in 1824, and the First Anglo-Burmese War in 1826.

From its base in India, the company was also engaged in an increasingly profitable opium trade to China, which had begun in the 1730s. This trade helped reverse the trade imbalances resulting from British imports of tea, which saw large outflows of silver from Britain to China. The Chinese authorities banned the importation of opium, and in 1839, 20,000 chests of opium were confiscated and destroyed in Canton by Lin Zexu. This led to the First Opium War, which was concluded in the Treaty of Nanjing, re-legalizing the importation of opium into China.

The British had direct or indirect control over all parts of present-day India before the middle of the 19th century. In 1857, a local rebellion by a group of &quot;sepoys&quot; escalated into the Indian Rebellion of 1857, which took six months to suppress with heavy loss of life on both sides; with British casualties numbering in the thousands and Indian casualties numbering in the hundreds of thousands. The trigger for the rebellion has been a subject of dispute among historians. The rebellion, although short-lived, was triggered by attempts from the East India Company to expand its control in India. According to Olson, several reasons may have triggered the rebellion. For example, Olson concludes that the East India Company&#x27;s attempt to annex and expand its direct control of India, by arbitrary laws such as Doctrine of Lapse, combined with discrimination in employment against Indians, contributed to the 1857 Rebellion. The East India Company officers lived lavish lives, the company finances were in shambles, and the company&#x27;s effectiveness in India was examined by the British crown after 1858. As a result, the East India Company lost its powers of government and British India formally came under direct Crown control, with an appointed Governor-General of India. The East India Company was dissolved the following year in 1858. A few years later, Queen Victoria took the title of Empress of India.

===British Raj===
India suffered a series of crop failures in the late 19th century, leading to widespread famines that caused tens of millions of deaths in India. Responding to earlier famines as threats to the stability of their control, the East India Company had already begun to concern itself with famine prevention during the early colonial period. This greatly expanded during the &quot;Raj&quot;, in which commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to take an effect.

The slow but momentous reform movement developed gradually into the Indian independence movement. During the First World War, the hitherto bourgeois &quot;home-rule&quot; movement was transformed into a popular mass movement by Mahatma Gandhi, a pacifist lawyer. Revolutionaries such as Bagha Jatin, Khudiram Bose, Bhagat Singh, Chandrashekar Azad, Surya Sen, Subhas Chandra Bose differed from Gandhi in their use of violence during their campaigns against British rule. The independence movement attained its objective with the independence of Pakistan and India on 14 and 15 August 1947 respectively.

== French ==
Following the Portuguese, English, and Dutch, the French also established trading bases in India. Their first establishment was in Pondicherry on the Coromandel Coast in southeastern India in 1674. Subsequent French settlements were Chandernagore in Bengal, northeastern India in 1688, Yanam in Andhra Pradesh in 1723, Mahe in 1725, and Karaikal in 1739. The French were constantly in conflict with the Dutch and later on mainly with the British in India. At the height of French power in the mid-18th century, the French established several outposts in southern India and the area lying in today&#x27;s northern Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. Between 1744 and 1761, the British and the French repeatedly attacked and conquered each other&#x27;s forts and towns in southeastern India and in Bengal in the northeast. After some initial French successes, the British decisively defeated the French in Bengal in the Battle of Plassey in 1757 and in the southeast in 1761 in the Battle of Wandiwash, after which the British East India Company was the supreme military and political power in southern India as well as in Bengal. In the following decades, it gradually increased the size of the territories under its control. The enclaves of Pondichéry, Karaikal, Yanam, Mahé, and Chandernagore were returned to France in 1816 and were integrated with the Republic of India in 1954.

== Danish ==
Denmark–Norway held several factories in India for more than 200 years, but the Danish presence in India was of little significance to the major European powers as they presented neither a military nor a mercantile threat. Denmark–Norway established trading outposts in Tranquebar, Tamil Nadu (1620); Serampore, West Bengal (1755); Calicut, Kerala (1752) and the Nicobar Islands (1750s). At one time, the main Danish and Swedish East Asia companies together imported more tea to Europe than the British did. Their outposts lost economic and strategic importance, and Tranquebar, the last Dano-Norwegian outpost, was sold to the British on 16 October 1868.

== Other external powers ==

===Sweden===
The Swedish East India Company (1731-1813) very briefly possessed a factory in Parangipettai for about one month of 1733.

=== Austria ===
The Austrian colonisation of the Nicobar Islands (, renamed to the Theresia Islands [&quot;Theresia-Inseln&quot;]) involved a series of three separate attempts to colonize and settle the Nicobar Islands by the Habsburg monarchy, and later the Austrian Empire, between 1778 and 1886. During the period of Austrian colonisation, the Nicobar Islands were previously colonized by the Danish in 1756, but were abandoned due to multiple outbreaks of malaria.

=== Japanese occupation ===
The Andaman and Nicobar Islands were briefly occupied by the Japanese Empire during World War II.

<text>: &quot;For the pyrotechnic initiator, see Shock tube detonator&quot;


A shock tube is an instrument used to replicate and direct blast waves at a sensor or model in order to simulate explosions and their effects, usually on a smaller scale. Shock tubes (and related impulse facilities such as shock tunnels, expansion tubes, and expansion tunnels) can also be used to study aerodynamic flow under a wide range of temperatures and pressures that are difficult to obtain in other types of testing facilities. Shock tubes are also used to investigate compressible flow phenomena and gas phase combustion reactions. More recently, shock tubes have been used in biomedical research to study how biological specimens are affected by blast waves.

A shock wave inside a shock tube may be generated by a small explosion (blast-driven) or by the buildup of high pressures which cause diaphragm(s) to burst and a shock wave to propagate down the shock tube (compressed-gas driven).

==History==
An early study of compression driven shock tubes was published in 1899 by French scientist Paul Vieille, though the apparatus was not called a shock tube until the 1940s. In the 1930s it was rediscovered by W. H. Payman and WCF Shepherd of English Safety in Mines Research Board in order to study underground methane explosions, but the term was not coined until Bleakney et al. publication of 1949.

In the 1940s, interest revived and shock tubes were increasingly used to study the flow of fast moving gases over objects, the chemistry and physical dynamics of gas phase combustion reactions. The modern version of the shock tube was developed during WWII at Princeton University by a group led by Walker Bleakney, who published overviews of their studies in 1946 and 1949.

In 1966, Duff and Blackwell described a type of shock tube driven by high explosives. These ranged in diameter from 0.6 to 2 m and in length from 3 m to 15 m. The tubes themselves were constructed of low-cost materials and produced shock waves with peak dynamic pressures of 7 MPa to 200 MPa and durations of a few hundred microseconds to several milliseconds.

Both compression-driven and blast-driven shock tubes are currently used for scientific as well as military applications. Compressed-gas driven shock tubes are more easily obtained and maintained in laboratory conditions; however, the shape of the pressure wave is different from a blast wave in some important respects and may not be suitable for some applications. Blast-driven shock tubes generate pressure waves that are more realistic to free-field blast waves. However, they require facilities and expert personnel for handling high explosives. Also, in addition to the initial pressure wave, a jet effect caused by the expansion of compressed gases (compression-driven) or production of rapidly expanding gases (blast-driven) follows and may transfer momentum to a sample after the blast wave has passed. More recently, laboratory scale shock tubes driven by fuel-air mixtures have been developed that produce realistic blast waves and can be operated in more ordinary laboratory facilities. Because the molar volume of gas is much less, the jet effect is a fraction of that for compressed-gas driven shock tubes. To date, the smaller size and lower peak pressures generated by these shock tubes make them most useful for preliminary, nondestructive testing of materials, validation of measurement equipment such as high speed pressure transducers, and for biomedical research as well as military applications.

==Operation==

A simple shock tube is a tube, rectangular or circular in cross-section, usually constructed of metal, in which a gas at low pressure and a gas at high pressure are separated using some form of diaphragm. See, for instance, texts by Soloukhin, Gaydon and Hurle, and Bradley. The diaphragm suddenly bursts open under predetermined conditions to produce a wave propagating through the low pressure section. The shock that eventually forms increases the temperature and pressure of the test gas and induces a flow in the direction of the shock wave. Observations can be made in the flow behind the incident front or take advantage of the longer testing times and vastly enhanced pressures and temperatures behind the reflected wave.

The low-pressure gas, referred to as the driven gas, is subjected to the shock wave. The high pressure gas is known as the driver gas. The corresponding sections of the tube are likewise called the driver and driven sections. The driver gas is usually chosen to have a low molecular weight, (e.g., helium or hydrogen) for safety reasons, with high speed of sound, but may be slightly diluted to &#x27;tailor&#x27; interface conditions across the shock. To obtain the strongest shocks the pressure of the driven gas is well below atmospheric pressure (a partial vacuum is induced in the driven section before detonation).

The test begins with the bursting of the diaphragm. Several methods are commonly used to burst the diaphragm. 
*A mechanically-driven plunger is sometimes used to pierce it or an explosive charge may be used to burst it. 
*Another method is to use diaphragms of plastic or metals to define specific bursting pressures. Plastics are used for the lowest burst pressures, aluminum and copper for somewhat higher levels and mild steel and stainless steel for the highest burst pressures. These diaphragms are frequently scored in a cross-shaped pattern to a calibrated depth to ensure that they rupture evenly, contouring the petals so that the full section of the tube remains open during the test time. 
*Yet another method of rupturing the diaphragm utilizes a mixture of combustible gases, with an initiator designed to produce a detonation within it, producing a sudden and sharp increase in what may or may not be a pressurized driver. This blast wave increases the temperature and pressure of the driven gas and induces a flow in the direction of the shock wave but at lower velocity than the lead wave.

The bursting diaphragm produces a series of pressure waves, each increasing the speed of sound behind them, so that they compress into a shock propagating through the driven gas. This shock wave increases the temperature and pressure of the driven gas and induces a flow in the direction of the shock wave but at lower velocity than the lead wave. Simultaneously, a rarefaction wave, often referred to as the Prandtl-Meyer wave, travels back in to the driver gas.

The interface, across which a limited degree of mixing occurs, separates driven and driver gases is referred to as the contact surface and follows, at a lower velocity, the lead wave.

A &#x27;Chemical Shock Tube&#x27; involves separating driver and driven gases by a pair of diaphragms designed to fail after pre-determined delays with an end &#x27;dump tank&#x27; of greatly increased cross-section. This allows an extreme rapid reduction (quench) in temperature of the heated gases.

== Uses ==
In addition to measurements of rates of chemical kinetics shock tubes have been used to measure dissociation energies and molecular relaxation rates they have been used in aerodynamic tests. The fluid flow in the driven gas can be used much as a wind tunnel, allowing higher temperatures and pressures therein replicating conditions in the turbine sections of jet engines. However, test times are limited to a few milliseconds, either by the arrival of the contact surface or the reflected shock wave.

They have been further developed into shock tunnels, with an added nozzle and dump tank. The resultant high temperature hypersonic flow can be used to simulate atmospheric re-entry of spacecraft or hypersonic craft, again with limited testing times.

Shock tubes have been developed in a wide range of sizes. The size and method of producing the shock wave determine the peak and duration of the pressure wave it produces. Thus, shock tubes can be used as a tool used to both create and direct blast waves at a sensor or an object in order to imitate actual explosions and the damage that they cause on a smaller scale, provided that such explosions do not involve elevated temperatures and shrapnel or flying debris. Results from shock tube experiments can be used to develop and validate numerical model of the response of a material or object to an ambient blast wave without shrapnel or flying debris. Shock tubes can be used to experimentally determine which materials and designs would be best suited to the job of attenuating ambient blast waves without shrapnel or flying debris. The results can then be incorporated into designs to protect structures and people that might be exposed to an ambient blast wave without shrapnel or flying debris. Shock tubes are also used in biomedical research to find out how biological tissues are affected by blast waves.

There are alternatives to the classical shock tube; for laboratory experiments at very high pressure, shock waves can also be created using high-intensity short-pulse lasers.

<doc id="848496" wikidata="Q2056663" url="?curid=848496" title="Brighton Rock (novel)">
<text>Brighton Rock is a novel by Graham Greene, published in 1938 and later adapted for film and theatre. The novel is a murder thriller set in 1930s Brighton. The first of Greene&#x27;s works to explore Catholic themes and moral issues, its treatment of class privilege and the problem of evil is paradoxical and ambivalent.

==Plot==
There is an incidental link between this novel and Greene&#x27;s earlier &quot;A Gun for Sale&quot; (1936), in that the murder of the gang boss Kite, mentioned in &quot;A Gun For Sale&quot;, allows the seventeen-year-old sociopath Pinkie to take over his gang and thus sets the events of &quot;Brighton Rock&quot; in motion. The murder of Kite had been brought about because of a report by Charles &quot;Fred&quot; Hale in the &quot;Daily Messenger&quot; about his slot machine racket. Now Hale has been sent to Brighton to distribute cards anonymously for a newspaper competition and realises that he is being hunted by Pinkie&#x27;s mob.

Hale meets middle-aged Ida Arnold by chance in a pub and then on the Palace Pier as the mob is closing in, but he is snatched away without her realising what has happened to him. To confuse the police investigation, Pinkie has gang member Spicer distribute Hale&#x27;s cards about the town and then tries to retrieve one card from the café in which sixteen-year-old Rose is working as a waitress. Since Rose had spotted Spicer leaving the card, Pinkie realises that she can now disprove his trail of deception and must take measures to prevent this. He therefore courts Rose until she falls in love with him, his aim being to marry her so that she cannot testify against him. In reality he looks down on her, since she comes from the same socially deprived neighbourhood as himself, and is even repelled by her physically.

Back in London, Ida reads about the inquest on Hale&#x27;s death, which had found that he died of heart failure. Remembering the state of terror that Hale was in when she last saw him, she decides to go down to Brighton and discover the full story. While there she recruits the help of one of her old bed-fellows and manages to finance her trip with a lucky bet at long odds. Her enquiries soon establish the broad outlines of the story, even though Rose consistently refuses to co-operate and warns Pinkie of Ida&#x27;s investigation.

Pinkie is summoned to an interview with Colleoni, a leading mobster whose aim is to take over all the illegal operations in Brighton. At the time Pinkie is too cocksure to take up Colleoni&#x27;s invitation to join his operation. Afterwards he pretends to have reconsidered in order to get Colleoni to murder Spicer, whom Pinkie suspects of being close to turning informer. In fact both men are set up for a razor attack at the horse races but escape separately. Discovering that Spicer is still alive, Pinkie throws him to his death from an unstable staircase in their lodgings and implicates their terrified solicitor Prewitt into helping him cover up the murder.

Prewitt has also helped Pinkie and Rose avoid the legal obstacles to their marriage and Pinkie now discovers that Rose has known of his criminality all along but not minded. Feeling trapped, and with what remains of his gang disintegrating, Pinkie proposes a suicide pact to Rose, on the pretence that Ida is close to having him arrested by the police. His plan is to get her to shoot herself at the developing resort of Peacehaven but not to fulfil his part of the pact. Ida meanwhile has tailed them, sensing that Rose may be in danger, and has brought a policeman along with her. Pinkie&#x27;s attempt to throw vitriol at his attackers misfires and, blinded by it himself, he runs over a cliff to his death.

Rose later goes to confession and explains to the priest that she had wanted to accompany Pinkie even into damnation. She is told that since Pinkie had loved her, then there was good in him and she might become the means for his ultimate salvation. She leaves, looking forward to playing a recording he made on the day of their marriage, not realising that it really contains the declaration of his hatred.

==Themes==
Although ostensibly an underworld thriller, the book is also noted as the first of Greene&#x27;s series of religious novels and deals with Roman Catholic doctrine concerning the nature of sin and the basis of morality. Pinkie and Rose are Catholics (as was Greene), and their beliefs are contrasted with Ida&#x27;s sentimental sense of right and wrong. Greene is also initiating here the series of moral problems with which his later novels wrestle. In this case he is asking what place has a creature as heartless as Pinkie within God&#x27;s infinite mercy. Rose had wanted to share in the damnation that Pinkie had earned, but the solution to her dilemma only arises indirectly in her interview in the confessional. There the priest refers her to the example of an unnamed Frenchman who rebelled against the Catholic doctrine of divine judgment and &quot;who decided that if any soul was going to be damned, he would be damned too.&quot; This was, in fact, the case of the writer Charles Péguy.

Another aspect of the problem&#x27;s difficulty is the impossibility of changing an environmentally conditioned character, as suggested in the title of the novel. Primarily, rock is a hard type of confectionery sold at seaside resorts, with the town&#x27;s name embedded in the centre and elongated down its length, so that it is revealed wherever the stick is broken. At the most obvious level, it stands for the tawdry 1930s seaside town, from a disadvantaged part of which both Pinkie and Rose have emerged. But in terms of the plot it is also the murder weapon ironically chosen to choke Hale. And beyond that again, it is the symbol of unchangeable human nature for the trite and morally neutral Ida. It was against just such seeming inflexibility that Péguy reacted.

The way opposites are handled in the novel adds this further layer of complexity to its meaning. The tourist aspect of Brighton and the gangsterism that takes advantage of it are at odds but depend on each other. The affluent characters coming and going in its luxury hotels and bars contrast with the down-and-out beachcomber, the old woman crouching to say her rosary in an alley, and characters like Pinkie and Rose struggling to escape the slums that bred them. Then there is the irreconcilable difference between the Catholic ideological interpretations of good and evil and Ida&#x27;s humanistic moral intuition, which goes far beyond a simple contrast of alternatives. The two are mutually exclusive. So, when Ida declares in her argument with Rose in Chapter 7: 
&quot;I know the difference between Right and Wrong. They didn&#x27;t teach you that at school,&quot; Rose didn&#x27;t answer; the woman was quite right: the two words meant nothing to her. Their taste was extinguished by stronger foods - Good and Evil.
This leads to a further paradox on which the novel dwells more than once: that, their common origin apart, Pinkie and Rose are so much opposites that they make a whole. As another interpreter has commented, &quot;Their only possible relation is the paradox of the Catholic novel&quot;.

==Adaptations==
A number of dramatic adaptations continue to be made from the novel. The first of those designed for the stage was written by Walter Kerr and Leo Brady for the Catholic University of America Theatre in Washington, D.C. The show starred Eric Linden as Pinkie and ran from 4 – 10 February in 1942. In Britain the following year, Frank Harvey&#x27;s play ran for a hundred performances at the Garrick Theatre in the West End, starring Richard Attenborough and Dulcie Gray. 

In 2004, composer John Barry and lyricist Don Black wrote a musical version based on the novel. The show opened in London&#x27;s Almeida Theatre on 20 September and ran until 13 October. However, owing to poor reviews, it failed to get a West End transfer. A more successful adaptation followed in 2018, when Bryony Lavery&#x27;s play opened at York Theatre Royal in February before touring the UK. 

Terence Rattigan and Greene himself wrote the screenplay for a 1948 film, produced and directed by John and Roy Boulting. It again starred Richard Attenborough as Pinkie, with Carol Marsh as Rose. In the United States, the film was released under the title &quot;Young Scarface&quot;. The climax differs from the novel in taking place at the Palace Pier. In the new century, Rowan Joffé directed a film adaptation which was released in 2010, starring Sam Riley as Pinkie, Andrea Riseborough as Rose and Helen Mirren as Ida Arnold. In a chronological departure from Greene&#x27;s 1930s novel, the film is set in the Mods and Rockers subculture of a divided Brighton in the 1960s.

There have also been two radio adaptations. Evelyn Russell&#x27;s 90-minute dramatisation for the BBC Home Service was aired in 1953 with Jimmy Thompson as Pinkie. In 1994, Ken Whitmore adapted the story for a five-episode BBC Radio dramatisation, directed by John Yorke and starring Steven Mackintosh as Pinkie.

<doc id="848505" wikidata="Q454616" url="?curid=848505" title="Branwell Brontë">
<text>Patrick Branwell Brontë (, commonly ; 26 June 1817 – 24 September 1848) was an English painter and writer. He was the only son of the Brontë family, and brother of the writers Charlotte, Emily, and Anne. Brontë was rigorously tutored at home by his father, and earned praise for his poetry and translations from the classics. However, he drifted between jobs, supporting himself by portrait-painting, and gave way to drug and alcohol addiction, apparently worsened by a failed relationship with a married woman. Brontë died at the age of 31.

==Youth==
Branwell Brontë was the fourth of six children and the only son of Patrick Brontë (1777–1861) and his wife, Maria Branwell Brontë (1783–1821). He was born in a house (now known as the Brontë Birthplace) in Market Street, Thornton, near Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, and moved with his family to Haworth when his father was appointed to the perpetual curacy in 1821.

While four of his five sisters were sent to Cowan Bridge boarding school, Branwell was educated at home by his father, who gave him a classical education. Elizabeth Gaskell, biographer of his sister, Charlotte Brontë, says of Branwell&#x27;s schooling &quot;Mr. Brontë&#x27;s friends advised him to send his son to school; but, remembering both the strength of will of his own youth and his mode of employing it, he believed that Branwell was better at home, and that he himself could teach him well, as he had told others before.&quot; His two eldest sisters died just before his eighth birthday in 1825, and their loss affected him deeply.

Even as a young boy Brontë read extensively, and was especially fond of the &quot;Noctes Ambrosianae&quot;, literary dialogues published in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;. He took a leadership role with Charlotte in a series of fantasy role-playing games which the siblings wrote and performed about the &quot;Young Men&quot;, characters based on a set of wooden soldiers. The plays evolved into an intricate saga based in West Africa about the fictitious Glass Town confederacy. From 1834, he both collaborated and competed with his sister Charlotte to describe another imaginary world, &quot;Angria&quot;. Branwell&#x27;s particular interest in these paracosms were their politics and wars, including the destructive rivalry between their heroes, Charlotte&#x27;s Arthur Wellesley, Duke of Zamorna, and his Alexander Percy, Earl of Northangerland. These writings impress by their virtuosity and scope, but are also repetitive when compared to Charlotte&#x27;s contributions. Christine Alexander, a Brontë juvenilia historian at the University of New South Wales, wrote &quot;Both Charlotte and Branwell ensured the consistency of their imaginary world. When Branwell exuberantly kills off important characters in his manuscripts, Charlotte comes to the rescue and, in effect, resurrects them for the next stories [...]; and when Branwell becomes bored with his inventions, such as the Glass Town magazine he edits, Charlotte takes over his initiative and keeps the publication going for several more years. It was Branwell, however, who took a pride in systematizing their private world and maintaining a consistent political structure, features typical of paracosmic play. He documented in encyclopaedic detail, in neat lists, footnotes, sketches, and maps, the geography, history, government, and social structure of the Glass Town Federation (and later, the new kingdom of Angria)—laying down the parameters of the imaginary world&quot;. He often wrote under several pseudonyms, such as Captain John Bud, Sergeant Bud, and Chief Genius Bany, who were also characters in their world.

Surrounded by female company and missing that of males, there are signs of pleasure in his early works of the wider options he would have due to his sex.
Aged 11 in January 1829 he began producing a magazine, later named &quot;Branwell&#x27;s Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; which included his poems, plays, criticisms, histories, and dialogues.
Unlike his sisters, Brontë was not prepared for a specific career. In his only real attempt to find work, on the death of James Hogg, a Blackwood&#x27;s writer, the 18-year-old Brontë boldly wrote to the magazine suggesting himself as a replacement. Between 1835 and 1842, Brontë wrote a total of six times to the magazine, sending poems and arrogantly offering his services. His letters were left unanswered. He began enjoying masculine company in the pubs in Haworth, and in February 1836 joined Haworth&#x27;s Masonic Lodge of the Three Graces at the youngest possible age.

In 1829–30, Patrick Brontë engaged John Bradley, an artist from neighbouring Keighley, as drawing-master for the children. Bradley was an artist of some local repute, rather than a professional instructor, but he may well have fostered Branwell&#x27;s enthusiasm for art and architecture. Bradley emigrated to America in 1831, and Branwell Brontë continued his studies under the portrait painter William Robinson. In 1834, he painted a portrait of his three sisters. He included his own image but became dissatisfied with it and painted it out. This portrait is now one of the best known images of the sisters and hangs in the National Portrait Gallery.

In 1835, he wrote a letter to the Royal Academy of Arts seeking to be admitted. Earlier biographers reported a move to London to study painting, which quickly ended following Brontë&#x27;s dissolute spending on drink. Other biographers speculated that he was too intimidated to present himself at the Academy. More recent scholarship suggests that Brontë did not send the letter or even make the trip to London. According to Francis Leyland, Brontë&#x27;s friend and a future biographer of the family, his first job was as an usher at a Halifax school. More certainly, Brontë worked as a portrait painter in Bradford in 1838 and 1839. Though certain of his paintings, for example that of his landlady Mrs. Kirby and a portrait of Emily show talent for comedic and serious styles, other portraits lack life. He returned to Haworth in debt in 1839.

==Adulthood==
With his father, Brontë reviewed the classics with a view to future employment as a tutor. At the beginning of January 1840, he started his employment with the family of Robert Postlethwaite in Broughton-in-Furness. During this time he wrote letters to his pub friends in Haworth which give &quot;a vivid picture of Branwell&#x27;s scabrous humour, his boastfulness, and his need to be accepted in a man&#x27;s world&quot;. According to Brontë, he started his job off with a riotous drinking session in Kendal.

During this employment he continued his literary work, including sending poems and translations to Thomas De Quincey and Hartley Coleridge who both lived in the Lake District. At Coleridge&#x27;s invitation, he visited the poet at his cottage who encouraged him to pursue his translations of Horace&#x27;s &quot;Odes&quot;. In June 1840 he sent the translations to Coleridge, after having been dismissed by the Postlethwaites. According to Juliet Barker&#x27;s biography of the Brontës, he may have fathered an illegitimate child during time in the town, but others suspect that it may be more of Brontë&#x27;s boasting. Coleridge began an encouraging letter about the quality of the translations in November–December 1840 but never finished it.
In October 1840, Brontë moved near to Halifax, where he had many good friends including the sculptor Joseph Bentley Leyland and Francis Grundy. He obtained employment with the Manchester and Leeds Railway, initially as &#x27;assistant clerk in charge&#x27; at Sowerby Bridge railway station, where he was paid £75 per annum (paid quarterly).
Later, on 1 April 1841, he was promoted to &#x27;clerk in charge&#x27; at Luddendenfoot railway station in West Yorkshire, where his salary increased to £130. In 1842 he was dismissed due to a deficit in the accounts of £11–1s–7d (£11.06) This had probably been stolen by Watson, the porter, who was left in charge when Brontë went drinking. This was attributed to incompetence rather than theft and the missing sum was deducted from his salary.
A description by Francis Leyland of Brontë at this time described him as &quot;rather below middle height, but of a refined and gentleman-like appearance, and of graceful manners. His complexion was fair and his features handsome; his mouth and chin were well-shaped; his nose was prominent and of the Roman type; his eyes sparkled and danced with delight, and his forehead made up of a face of oval form which gave an irresistible charm to its possessor, and attracted the admiration of those who knew him.&quot; Another described him less flatteringly as &quot;almost insignificantly small&quot; and with &quot;a mass of red hair which he wore brushed off his forehead – to help his height I fancy... small ferrety eyes, deep sunk and still further hidden by the never removed spectacles.&quot;

In January 1843, after nine months at Haworth, Brontë took up another tutoring position in Thorp Green, Little Ouseburn, near York, where he was to tutor the Reverend Edmund Robinson&#x27;s young son. His sister Anne had been the governess there since May 1840. As usual, at first things went well, with Charlotte reporting in January 1843 that her siblings were &quot;both wonderously valued in their situations.&quot; During his 30 months service Branwell corresponded with several old friends about his increasing infatuation with Robinson&#x27;s wife Lydia, née Gisborne, a charming and sophisticated woman, almost fifteen years senior to him. He wrote, perhaps unreliably, to one of his friends that &quot;my mistress is DAMNABLY TOO FOND OF ME&quot; and sent him a &quot;lock of her hair, wch has lain at night on his breast – wd to God it could do so legally !&quot; In July 1845, he was dismissed from his position. According to Gaskell, he received a letter &quot;sternly dismissing him, intimating that his proceedings were discovered, characterising them as bad beyond expression and charging him, on pain of exposure, to break off immediately, and for ever, all communication with every member of the family.&quot; Multiple explanations have been given for this, including inappropriate relationships with a Robinson daughter or son, or that he had passed forged cheques. The most likely explanation is Brontë&#x27;s own account that he had an affair with Mrs Robinson which Brontë hoped would lead to marriage after her husband&#x27;s death. For several months after his dismissal, he regularly received small amounts of money from Thorp Green, sent by Mrs. Robinson herself, probably to dissuade him from blackmailing his former employer and lover.

Brontë returned home to his family at the Haworth parsonage, where he looked for another job, wrote poetry and attempted to adapt Angrian material into a book called &quot;And the Weary are at Rest&quot;. During the 1840s, several of his poems were published in local newspapers under the name of Northangerland, making him the first of the Brontës to be a published poet. Soon however, after Mr Robinson&#x27;s death, Mrs Robinson made clear that she was not going to marry Branwell, who then &quot;declined into chronic alcoholism, opiates and debt&quot;. Charlotte&#x27;s letters from this time demonstrate that she was angered by his behaviour. In January 1847, he wrote to his friend Leyland about the easy existence he hoped for: &quot;to try and make myself a name in the world of posterity, without being pestered by the small but countless botherments.&quot; His behaviour became increasingly impossible and embarrassing to the family. He managed to set fire to his bed, after which his father had to sleep with him for the safety of the family. Towards the end of his life he was sending notes to a friend asking of &quot;Five pence (5d) worth of Gin&quot;. Charlotte Brontë wrote to her publisher that Branwell died without &quot;ever knowing that his sisters had published a line.&quot; However, according to Juliet Barker&#x27;s biography, Branwell may have known about his sisters&#x27; publication of their poetry, having been the accidental recipient of some proofs since their pseudonyms were thought to be male. Barker also states that Branwell&#x27;s friends said he claimed authorship of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (though they may have said this out of loyalty).

==Death==
On 24 September 1848, Brontë died at Haworth parsonage, most likely due to tuberculosis aggravated by delirium tremens, alcoholism, and laudanum and opium addiction, despite the fact that his death certificate notes &quot;chronic bronchitis-marasmus&quot; as the cause. Elizabeth Gaskell&#x27;s biography of Charlotte reports an eye-witness account that Brontë, wanting to show the power of the human will, decided to die standing up, &quot;and when the last agony began, he insisted on assuming the position just mentioned.&quot; On 28 September 1848, he was interred in the family vault.

Emily Brontë died of tuberculosis on 19 December of that year and Anne Brontë on 29 May 1849 in the coastal resort of Scarborough. Charlotte, the last living sister, married the Reverend Arthur Bell Nichols, curate of Haworth, in 1854 and died in March 1855, due to complications from pregnancy.

==Cultural references==

Polly Teale wrote a 2005 play entitled &quot;Brontë&quot; about the three sisters, in which Branwell was portrayed as a drunk and jealous brother due to the growing successes of his sisters.

Blake Morrison wrote the play &quot;We are Three Sisters&quot; (2011), a re-working of Chekhov&#x27;s &quot;Three Sisters&quot; based on the lives of the Brontë sisters and featuring Branwell and Mrs Robinson, which premiered in Halifax on 9 September before touring.

British novelist Robert Edric wrote &quot;Sanctuary&quot; (2014), a novel chronicling Branwell&#x27;s final months, during which family secrets are revealed and he learns about the publication of his sisters&#x27; books.

Branwell is referenced by the character &quot;Mr Mybug&quot; in Stella Gibbons&#x27; 1932 comic novel Cold Comfort Farm. In a parody of the &quot;Hampstead intellectual&quot; scene of the time of the book&#x27;s creation, the Mr Mybug character boasts of working on a biography of Branwell Brontë, his thesis being that Branwell was in fact the real author of the books ascribed to his sisters.

In Tim Powers&#x27; novel &quot;My Brother’s Keeper&quot; (2023), Branwell is a major character, along with his sister Emily as the protagonist, as well as, to a lesser extent, the rest of the Brontë family.

===Portrayals===

<text>William Joseph Hussey (August 10, 1862 – October 28, 1926) was an American astronomer.

== Early life and education ==
He was born at Mendon, Ohio, August 10, 1862, son of John Milton Hussey and Mary Catherine Stevens. He attended the Valparaiso Normal School in 1880 and completed the scientific curriculum with a specialization in education in one year. Afterward, he attended the University of Michigan to study civil engineering.

He had to stop his education his sophomore year of university due to a lack of funds. During a three-year hiatus from his education he worked as a principal of the schools at Ohio Station, Illinois. During summer breaks, he did clerical work for railroad surveyors in the Northwest. He then returned to the University of Michigan to finish his civil engineering degree in 1889.

== Career ==
After graduating with a BS in civil engineering from the University of Michigan in 1889, he served as assistant in the Nautical Almanac Office of Washington. He soon returned to Ann Arbor as instructor in mathematics, and became instructor in astronomy in 1891.

He is most famous for the discovery and study of close binary stars. In the period from 1898 to 1899, he observed all binaries discovered by Otto Struve, with at least three observations of each. His amazing efficiency is demonstrated by these numbers: he made 1,920 observations in one year, with a record of 80 in one night. He had travelled all around the world for this research to places such as California, Arizona, and Australia. He also designed many of the telescopes that he used during these studies. At the conclusion of his double star work in 1905, he had discovered and measured 1,327 close binaries. For this work, he was awarded the Lalande Medal in 1906, which he shared with Robert Grant Aitken.

In 1892, he joined the faculty of Stanford University as an assistant professor of astronomy. From 1896 to 1905 he was Astronomer at the Lick Observatory, returning to the faculty of the University of Michigan in 1905 to become professor of astronomy and fifth director of the Detroit Observatory. In 1897, he was elected president of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific. During his time at the Lick Observatory, he took photographs of Comet Rordame. From 1905 to 1912, Hussey served as the secretary of the American Astronomical Society. In 1911, Hussey traveled to the University of La Plata in Argentina to help them develop their Observatory and telescopes. In 1912, he went on to earn another degree from Brown University.

=== Time at the University of Michigan ===
As an astronomy professor and director of the Detroit Observatory, Hussey made many meaningful contributions to the astronomy department at the University of Michigan. He was responsible for securing large donations to the observatory and for the installation of a 37 1/2-inch reflecting telescope. He was able to expand the astronomy department from twelve students to over one-hundred. Hussey often argued against any developments around the Observatory to protect it from anything that could disrupt observations, such as dirt, dust, and light. In 1912, while Hussey was voyaging across the Atlantic on his way to La Plata University in Argentina, the president of the university, Harry B. Hutchins, and the board of regents decided to build a power plant near the observatory. Hussey and his wife, Ethel Hussey, argued against the plant&#x27;s development but it was developed despite their opposition. Ethel Hussey was the first president of the Michigan League at the time.

== Death ==
On his way to install a new telescope in South Africa, Hussey died unexpectedly in London, England on October 28, 1926. He had worked for many years preparing for this project. A crater on Mars was named in his honor. The Lamont–Hussey Observatory in Bloemfontein, Free State, South Africa was named after him.

<text>Infield is a sports term whose definition depends on the sport in whose context it is used.

== Baseball ==
In baseball, the diamond, as well as the area immediately beyond it, has both grass and dirt, in contrast to the more distant, usually grass-covered, &quot;outfield&quot;. The &quot;diamond&quot; can also refer to the defensive unit of players that are positioned in the region: first baseman, second baseman, shortstop, third baseman. Sometimes it includes the catcher and pitcher who (as a tandem) are often referred to separately as the battery.

In baseball the physical infield is where most of the action in a baseball game occurs, as it includes that area where the all-important duel between the pitcher and batter takes place. The pitcher stands on the pitcher&#x27;s mound (a raised mound of dirt located at the center of the infield) and from there he pitches the ball to his catcher, who is crouched behind home plate sixty feet, six inches away at what might be called the cutlet of the diamond-shaped baseball field. To the left and right of the catcher are chalk boxes in the dirt called batter&#x27;s boxes. The opposing team&#x27;s batter must stand in one of the two boxes and from there he will attempt to hit the pitched ball with his bat. The umpire, who officiates the game, stands behind the catcher. The other important parts of the infield are the three bases, first base (to the pitcher&#x27;s left, looking toward home plate), second base (behind the pitcher) and third base (to the pitcher&#x27;s right). Together, home plate and the three bases form a diamond around the pitcher, with each side of the diamond measuring .

== Cricket ==

In cricket infield is a central oval on the cricket field, the reference point for fielding restrictions in short forms of the game; in contrast to the more distant &quot;outfield&quot;.

==Tracks==
Infield can refer to a region inside a closed race track used for horse racing or auto racing, or to an area encircled by the track of a roller coaster.

<text>Winter Kills is a black comedy novel by Richard Condon, exploring the assassination of a U.S. president. It was published in 1974. The novel parallels the death of John F. Kennedy and the conspiracy theories about it.

==Plot summary==
The novel begins with U.S. President Timothy Kegan already having been assassinated in Philadelphia at Hunt Plaza. The ensuing presidential commission condemns a lone gunman as the killer. The narrative starts years later, when Kegan&#x27;s half-brother, Nick, witnesses the death-bed confession of a man claiming to have been part of the killing&#x27;s &#x27;hit squad&#x27;. As the protagonist attempts to uncover those behind it, he encounters numerous groups and persons that could have led or been part of the conspiracy. One is Lola Camonte, a hostess, lobbyist and fixer. She recounts the story of President Kegan asking her about appointing a member of organized crime to the Court of St. James&#x27;s. The character &quot;Joe Diamond&quot; is the fictional representation of the killer of Kennedy&#x27;s assassin, Lee Harvey Oswald, the Mob-connected Dallas nightclub owner Jack Ruby.

Condon&#x27;s book describes numerous intertwined threads, variously implicating (or proffering as diversions to put the protagonist off the trail) the Jewish/Italian-American Mob, figures related to Cuba, even possible domestic police connections. Only in the final act, in which Nick meets with his vicious and perverse Joseph P. Kennedy-like &#x27;father-figure&#x27;, is the truth revealed with a twist ending implicating the &quot;system&quot; of interrelated interests embracing organized crime, the U.S. covert world, big business, and political fixers.

==Film adaptation==
In 1979, a film adaptation of the novel was released, &quot;Winter Kills&quot;, which starred Jeff Bridges and John Huston.

<text>The outfield, in cricket, baseball and softball is the area of the field of play further from the batsman or batter than the infield. In association football, the outfield players are positioned outside the goal area.

==In bat and ball games==

In baseball, softball and cricket, fielders in the outfield have more ground to cover than infielders, but also more time before the ball reaches them. Catches are most likely to arise from shots that have been &#x27;skied&#x27; (in cricket) or &#x27;popped
&#x27; (in baseball and softball). If a catch is not possible (for example, the ball has bounced, or is rolling or skidding across the turf) the fielder will attempt to head off, pick up and throw in the ball as quickly as possible to reduce the distance the runners can run and hopefully to effect a run out (cricket) or tag out (baseball and softball).

In cricket, where the ball is far more likely to stay low against the ground than in baseball or softball, the condition of the turf has a major effect on the speed at which the ball travels through the outfield. On a slow outfield the ball decelerates significantly, making fielding easier and batting harder — in particular boundaries are far harder to hit. This usually occurs if the playing surface is uneven or if it is damp from rain or dew. However, on a fast outfield the ball does not decelerate significantly even when rolling along the turf, often racing past the fielders and over the boundary rope. In these circumstances, batsmen find it easier to score runs quickly. Commentators often refer to the ball accelerating to the boundary on fast outfields, but this only physically occurs on grounds with a slope and on which the ball is moving downhill.

In baseball and softball, a slow, damp outfield is usually considered an advantage for the hitter, in as much as a batted ball will not travel as quickly to an outfielder in the traditional deep position for fly balls, and thus may permit additional advance by batters and other runners on the basepaths. In addition, a wet, slick ball can not be thrown with the accuracy of a dry one, also permitting the opportunity for additional advance on the bases. Moreover, a wet field generally slows the footspeed of the defense, so fielders will be able to reach fewer flies and line drives in the air before they go through to the fences.

==Association football==
In association football, eleven players are fielded in each match. The goalkeeper remains in the goal, and the remaining ten players are &quot;outfield&quot; players.

<text>In Classical architecture, a &#x27; () or &#x27; () is the inner chamber of an ancient Greek or Roman temple. Its enclosure within walls has given rise to extended meanings, of a hermit&#x27;s or monk&#x27;s cell, and since the 17th century, of a biological cell in plants or animals.

==Greek and Roman temples==

In ancient Greek and Roman temples, the &quot;cella&quot; was a room at the center of the building, usually containing a cult image or statue representing the particular deity venerated in the temple. In addition, the &quot;cella&quot; might contain a table to receive supplementary votive offerings, such as votive statues of associated deities, precious and semi-precious stones, helmets, spear and arrow heads, swords, and war trophies. No gatherings or sacrifices took place in the &quot;cella&quot;, as the altar for sacrifices was always located outside the building along the axis and temporary altars for other deities were built next to it. The accumulated offerings made Greek and Roman temples virtual treasuries, and many of them were indeed used as treasuries during antiquity.
The &quot;cella&quot; was typically a simple, windowless, rectangular room with a door or open entrance at the front behind a colonnaded portico facade. In larger temples, the &quot;cella&quot; was typically divided by two colonnades into a central nave flanked by two aisles. A &quot;cella&quot; may also contain an &quot;adyton&quot;, an inner area restricted to access by the priests—in religions that had a consecrated priesthood—or by the temple guard.

With very few exceptions, Greek buildings were of a peripteral design that placed the &quot;cella&quot; in the center of the plan, such as the Parthenon and the Temple of Apollo at Paestum. The Romans favoured pseudoperipteral buildings with a portico offsetting the &quot;cella&quot; to the rear. The pseudoperipteral plan uses engaged columns embedded along the side and rear walls of the &quot;cella&quot;. The Temple of Venus and Roma built by Hadrian in Rome had two &quot;cellae&quot; arranged back-to-back enclosed by a single outer peristyle.
==Etruscan temples==
According to Vitruvius, the Etruscan type of temples (as, for example, at Portonaccio, near Veio) had three &quot;cellae&quot;, side by side, conjoined by a double row of columns on the façade. This is an entirely new setup with respect to the other types of constructions found in Etruria and the Tyrrhenian side of Italy, which have one cell with or without columns, as seen in Greece and the Orient.

==Egyptian temples==
In the Hellenistic culture of the Ptolemaic Kingdom in ancient Egypt, the &quot;cella&quot; referred to that which is hidden and unknown inside the inner sanctum of an Egyptian temple, existing in complete darkness, meant to symbolize the state of the universe before the act of creation. The &quot;cella&quot;, also called the &quot;naos&quot;, holds many box-like shrines. The Greek word &quot;naos&quot; has been extended by archaeologists to describe the central room of the pyramids. Towards the end of the Old Kingdom, &quot;naos&quot; construction went from being subterranean to being built directly into the pyramid, above ground. The &quot;naos&quot; was surrounded by many different paths and rooms, many used to confuse and divert thieves and grave robbers.

==Christian churches==
In early Christian and Byzantine architecture, the &quot;cella&quot; or &quot;naos&quot; is an area at the center of the church reserved for performing the liturgy.

In later periods, a small chapel or monk&#x27;s cell was also called a &quot;cella&quot;. This is the source of the Irish language &quot;cill&quot; or &quot;cell&quot; (Anglicised as Kil(l)-) in many Irish place names.

<text>Kitchen gods are mythical beings that represent abstract concepts such as luck or just propel the minor changes of everyday life. Little things that cannot be explained, such as losing small objects like socks in the laundry, are often attributed to these creatures because the explanation eludes the believer.

<doc id="848552" wikidata="Q6583042" url="?curid=848552" title="Vietnamese Constitutional Monarchist League">
<text>Vietnamese Constitutional Monarchist League (VCML; ) is a monarchist and anti-communist organization based in the United States, which seeks the restoration of the Nguyễn dynasty to the throne of Vietnam under a constitutional monarchy, similar to those in Cambodia and Thailand. The VCML&#x27;s position is that Emperor Bảo Đại was the last legitimate ruler of Vietnam. Bảo Đại and his children do not support the VCML or their political aspirations.

== History ==
The VCML was established in 1993 by its current President and Regent of the Imperial Nguyen dynasty Nguyễn Phúc Bửu Chánh, a member of the Vietnamese royal family who fled from South Vietnam for political reasons after 1975.

Vietnam&#x27;s last emperor, Bảo Đại, lived in Europe until his death on 30 July 1997. His son, Crown Prince Bảo Long, intentionally remained out of politics and lived quietly in Paris, France until his death on 28 July 2007. His brother, Prince Bảo Thăng, did not support the VCML through to his death on 15 March 2017. The position of Head of the Imperial House is now held by Prince Phúc Bảo Ngọc.

== Political positions ==
The VCML believes that &quot;only the limited monarchy of the Imperial Nguyen Dynasty can succeed in preserving the cultural independence of Vietnam&quot; and that &quot;only a government that upholds Vietnamese nationalism and personal freedom can fully succeed in restoring the nation&quot;.

The VCML has repeatedly denounced the communist government of Vietnam over corruption and human rights abuses.

<text>Baščaršija Nights (also known as Nights of Baščaršija; Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian: &quot;Baščaršijske noći&quot; / Башчаршијске ноћи) is the biggest culture festival in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina. Taking place throughout July every year, it celebrates various aspects of the nation&#x27;s culture, and includes performances of classical music, rock and roll and folk music; live theatre; various exhibits and folklore displays; as well as books, film, children&#x27;s programming, opera and ballet.

Performances usually take place outdoors, in the streets of Sarajevo&#x27;s Old Town district and its historic Baščaršija neighborhood. Admission is free. It is estimated that about 150,000 people attend the festival&#x27;s 40–50 events each year.

The first day of the festival always features a performance by the Sarajevo Philharmonic Orchestra, which is attended by numerous city and canton politicians.

A concert by popular Bosnian singer Dino Merlin concluded the festival in 2000. It was held in Stadium Koševo and was sold out. The first Bosnian opera in history was part of the festival in 2003, as well as a performance by local rockers Zabranjeno pušenje.

<doc id="848560" wikidata="Q526920" url="?curid=848560" title="Nasolacrimal duct">
<text>The nasolacrimal duct (also called the tear duct) carries tears from the lacrimal sac of the eye into the nasal cavity. The duct begins in the eye socket between the maxillary and lacrimal bones, from where it passes downwards and backwards. The opening of the nasolacrimal duct into the inferior nasal meatus of the nasal cavity is partially covered by a mucosal fold (valve of Hasner or &quot;plica lacrimalis&quot;).

Excess tears flow through the nasolacrimal duct which drains into the inferior nasal meatus. This is the reason the nose starts to run when a person is crying or has watery eyes from an allergy, and why one can sometimes taste eye drops. This is for the same reason when applying some eye drops it is often advised to close the nasolacrimal duct by pressing it with a finger to prevent the medicine from escaping the eye and having unwanted side effects elsewhere in the body as it will proceed through the canal to the nasal cavity.

Like the lacrimal sac, the duct is lined by stratified columnar epithelium containing mucus-secreting goblet cells, and is surrounded by connective tissue.

==Nasolacrimal canal==

The canal containing the duct is called the nasolacrimal canal. It is formed by indentations in the inferior nasal conchae, maxilla and lacrimal bone. The canal drains into the nasal cavity through the anterior portion of the inferior meatus, which is between the inferior concha and the floor of the nasal cavity.

==Clinical significance==
Obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct may occur. This leads to the excess overflow of tears called &quot;epiphora&quot; (chronic low-grade nasolacrimal duct occlusion). A congenital obstruction can cause cystic expansion of the duct and is called a dacryocystocele or &quot;Timo cyst&quot;. Persons with dry eye conditions can be fitted with punctal plugs that seal the ducts to limit the amount of fluid drainage and retain moisture.

During an ear infection, excess mucus may drain through the nasolacrimal duct in the opposite way tears drain. 

In humans, the tear ducts in males tend to be larger than the ones in females.

<doc id="848561" wikidata="Q2521552" url="?curid=848561" title="Flesch–Kincaid readability tests">
<text>The Flesch–Kincaid readability tests are readability tests designed to indicate how difficult a passage in English is to understand. There are two tests: the Flesch Reading-Ease, and the Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level. Although they use the same core measures (word length and sentence length), they have different weighting factors.

The results of the two tests correlate approximately inversely: a text with a comparatively high score on the Reading Ease test should have a lower score on the Grade-Level test. Rudolf Flesch devised the Reading Ease evaluation; somewhat later, he and J. Peter Kincaid developed the Grade Level evaluation for the United States Navy.

==History==
&quot;The Flesch–Kincaid&quot; (F–K) reading grade level was developed under contract to the U.S. Navy in 1975 by J. Peter Kincaid and his team. Related U.S. Navy research directed by Kincaid delved into high-tech education (for example, the electronic authoring and delivery of technical information), usefulness of the Flesch–Kincaid readability formula, computer aids for editing tests, illustrated formats to teach procedures, and the Computer Readability Editing System (CRES).

The F–K formula was first used by the Army for assessing the difficulty of technical manuals in 1978 and soon after became a United States Military Standard. Pennsylvania was the first U.S. state to require that automobile insurance policies be written at no higher than a ninth-grade level (14–15 years of age) of reading difficulty, as measured by the F–K formula. This is now a common requirement in many other states and for other legal documents such as insurance policies.

== Flesch reading ease ==

In the Flesch reading-ease test, higher scores indicate material that is easier to read, while lower numbers mark passages that are more difficult to read. The formula for the Flesch reading-ease score (FRES) test is:

formula_1

Scores can be interpreted as shown in the table below.

&quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; magazine has a readability index of about 65, &quot;Time&quot; magazine scores about 52, an average grade six student&#x27;s written assignment (age of 12) has a readability index of 60–70 (and a reading grade level of six to seven), and the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; has a general readability score in the low 30s. The highest (easiest) readability score possible is 121.22, but only if every sentence consists of only one-syllable words. &quot;The cat sat on the mat.&quot; scores 116. The score does not have a theoretical lower bound; therefore, it is possible to make the score as low as wanted by arbitrarily including words with many syllables. The sentence &quot;This sentence, taken as a reading passage unto itself, is being used to prove a point.&quot; has a readability of 69. The sentence &quot;The Australian platypus is seemingly a hybrid of a mammal and reptilian creature.&quot; scores 37.5 as it has 24 syllables and 13 words. While Amazon calculates the text of &quot;Moby-Dick&quot; as 57.9, one particularly long sentence about sharks in chapter 64 has a readability score of −146.77. One sentence in the beginning of Scott Moncrieff&#x27;s English translation of &quot;Swann&#x27;s Way&quot;, by Marcel Proust, has a score of −515.1.

The U.S. Department of Defense uses the reading ease test as the standard test of readability for its documents and forms. Florida requires that insurance policies have a Flesch reading ease score of 45 or greater.

Use of this scale is so ubiquitous that it is bundled with popular word processing programs and services such as KWord, IBM Lotus Symphony, Microsoft Office Word, WordPerfect, WordPro, and Grammarly.

Polysyllabic words affect this score significantly more than they do the grade-level score.

==Flesch–Kincaid grade level== 
These readability tests are used extensively in the field of education. The &quot;Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level Formula&quot; presents a score as a U.S. grade level, making it easier for teachers, parents, librarians, and others to judge the readability level of various books and texts. It can also mean the number of years of education generally required to understand this text, relevant when the formula results in a number greater than 10. The grade level is calculated with the following formula:

formula_2

The result is a number that corresponds with a U.S. grade level. The sentence, &quot;The Australian platypus is seemingly a hybrid of a mammal and reptilian creature&quot; is an 11.3 as it has 24 syllables and 13 words. The different weighting factors for words per sentence and syllables per word in each scoring system mean that the two schemes are not directly comparable and cannot be converted. The grade level formula emphasizes sentence length over word length. By creating one-word strings with hundreds of random characters, grade levels may be attained that are hundreds of times larger than high school completion in the United States. Due to the formula&#x27;s construction, the score does not have an upper bound.

The lowest grade level score in theory is −3.40 (belonging to the passage &quot;Go. See. Stop. Rest.&quot; for example), but there are few real passages in which every sentence consists of a single one-syllable word. &quot;Green Eggs and Ham&quot; by Dr. Seuss comes close, averaging 5.7 words per sentence and 1.02 syllables per word, with a grade level of −1.3. (Most of the 50 used words are monosyllabic; &quot;anywhere&quot;, which occurs eight times, is the only exception.)

==Limitations==

As readability formulas were developed for school books, they demonstrate weaknesses compared to directly testing usability with typical readers. They neglect between-reader differences and effects of content, layout and retrieval aids.

<text>Y. Bhekhirst is an outsider musician based in New Hyde Park, New York. 

== History ==
Although not much is known about him, his sole known record, &quot;Hot in the Airport&quot;, released in 1986 and re-released in 1994 on New Hyde Park-based label HDG Records, is prized by some outsider music collectors for its decidedly dadaistic, shambling songs. Both releases of &quot;Hot in the Airport&quot; were cassette-only. The title track of the album, which has been described as &quot;oblique&quot;, was released contemporaneously as a 7-inch single, and has been anthologized in the compilation &quot;Interesting Results: Music by a Committee of One&quot;. Slightly more polished musically than the other songs, it includes a number of lines sung in Spanish.

Information on Y. Bhekhirst is scarce. Irwin Chusid, who brought Bhekhirst&#x27;s music to the public&#x27;s attention in the mid-90s with &quot;Songs in the Key of Z&quot;, reported that a man calling himself Y. Bhekhirst was distributing his cassettes in New York record stores; handing them over to the clerks and then walking out abruptly without further explanation. Chusid and former colleague Michelle Boulé played selections from &quot;Hot in the Airport&quot; on numerous occasions when they worked together at station WFMU.

Searches at the U.S. Copyright Office have revealed that a man named José Hugo Díaz Guzmán (born in 1946 and also known as Pepe Díaz Guzmán) is somehow involved with Y&#x27;s music, as the name &quot;H. Díaz&quot; or &quot;H. Díazg&quot; shows up on most known releases of material from &quot;Hot in the Airport&quot;. Some have speculated that Díaz Guzmán and Bhekhirst are the same individual.

Under various pseudonyms (such as &quot;Al Pol&quot;, &quot;Al Phol&quot;, &quot;Al Phool&quot; and &quot;Al Phooz&quot;), Díaz Guzmán appears to have copyrighted numerous songs and cassette recordings, the earliest in 1981 and the latest in 1992.

Kane co-created the modern-day versions of the superheroes Green Lantern and the Atom for DC Comics, and co-created Iron Fist and Adam Warlock with Roy Thomas for Marvel Comics. He was involved in the anti-drug storyline in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #96–98, which, at the behest of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, bucked the then-prevalent Comics Code Authority to depict drug abuse, and ultimately spurred an update of the Code. Kane additionally pioneered an early graphic novel prototype, &quot;His Name Is... Savage&quot;, in 1968, and a seminal graphic novel, &quot;Blackmark&quot;, in 1971.

In 1997, he was inducted into both the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame and the Harvey Award Jack Kirby Hall of Fame.

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Gil Kane was born Eli Katz () on April 6, 1926, in Latvia to a Jewish family who immigrated to the U.S. in 1929, settling in Brooklyn, New York City. His father was a struggling poultry merchant. Kane attended high school at Manhattan&#x27;s School of Industrial Art, but left in his senior year when he saw an opportunity to work at MLJ Comics (later Archie Comics). He recalled in a 1996 interview,

Until being fired after three weeks, Kane worked in production, &quot;putting borders on pages. The letterers would only put in the lettering, not the balloons, so I would put in the borders, balloons, and I&#x27;d finish up artwork—whatever had to be done on a lesser scale.&quot; Within &quot;a couple of days&quot; of being let go, &quot;I got a job with Jack Binder&#x27;s agency. Jack Binder had a loft on Fifth Avenue and it just looked like an internment camp. There must have been 50 or 60 guys up there, all at drawing tables. You had to account for the paper that you took.&quot; Kane began penciling professionally there, but, &quot;They weren&#x27;t terribly happy with what I was doing. But when I was rehired by MLJ three weeks later, not only did they put me back into the production department and give me an increase, they gave me my first job, which was &#x27;Inspector Bentley of Scotland Yard&#x27; in &quot;Pep Comics&quot;, and then they gave me a whole issue of &quot;The Shield and Dusty&quot;, one of their leading books&quot;. He would also do spot illustrations for other studios.

His earliest known credit is inking Carl Hubbell on the six-page Scarlet Avenger superhero story &quot;The Counterfeit Money Code&quot; in MLJ&#x27;s &quot;Zip Comics&quot; #14 (cover-dated May 1941), on which he signed the name &quot;Gil Kane&quot;. Other early credits include some issues of the company&#x27;s &quot;Pep Comics&quot;, sometimes under pseudonyms including Stack Til and Stacktil, and, in conjunction with artist Pen Shumaker, Pen Star. He even used his birth name on rare occasions, including on at least one story each in the Temerson / Helnit / Continental publishing group&#x27;s &quot;Terrific Comics&quot; and &quot;Cat-Man Comics&quot;.

In 1944 he did his first work for the future Marvel Comics, as one of two inkers on the 28-page &quot;The Spawn of Death&quot; in the wartime kid-gang comic &quot;Young Allies&quot; #11 (March 1944), and the future DC Comics, as the uncredited ghost artist for Jack Kirby on the Sandman superhero story &quot;Courage a la Carte&quot; in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #91 (May 1944). That same year Kane either was drafted or enlisted in the Army and served in the World War II Pacific theater of operations. After 19 months in the service, he returned to in December 1945. All-American Publications editor Sheldon Mayer hired him in 1947, for a stint that lasted six months. He contributed again to the &quot;Sandman&quot; feature in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; and, as penciler Gil Stack and inker Phil Martel, to the &quot;Wildcat&quot; feature in &quot;Sensation Comics&quot;. Around this time, he said, he &quot;worked with director Garson Kanin when he was involved in TV&quot;, drawing storyboards.

In 1949, Kane began a longtime professional relationship with Julius Schwartz, an editor at National Comics, the future DC Comics. Kane drew stories for several DC series in the 1950s including &quot;All-Star Western&quot; and &quot;The Adventures of Rex the Wonder Dog&quot;.

===Silver Age of Comic Books===

In the late 1950s, freelancing for DC Comics precursor National Comics, Kane illustrated works in what fans and historians call the Silver Age of Comic Books, creating character designs for the modern-day version of the 1940s superhero Green Lantern, for which he pencilled most of the first 75 issues of the reimagined character&#x27;s comic. Comics historian Les Daniels praised Kane&#x27;s work on the character, stating &quot;The design was part of an approach that emphasized grace as well as strength, an approach especially notable in Kane&#x27;s flying scenes ... Green Lantern appeared to soar effortlessly across the cosmos.&quot; DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz noted in 2010 that Kane &quot;modeled the Guardians on Israeli founding father David Ben-Gurion, even as the human figures in the cast tended to mimic Kane&#x27;s own tall, elongated build.&quot; Kane and writer John Broome&#x27;s stories for the &quot;Green Lantern&quot; series included transforming Hal Jordan&#x27;s love interest, Carol Ferris, into the Star Sapphire in issue #16. Black Hand, a character featured prominently in the &quot;Blackest Night&quot; storyline in 2009–2010, debuted in issue #29 (June 1964) by Broome and Kane. The creative team created Guy Gardner in the story &quot;Earth&#x27;s Other Green Lantern!&quot; in issue #59 (March 1968).

Kane similarly co-created an updated version of the Atom with writer Gardner Fox. Kane — who by 1960 was living in Jericho, New York, on Long Island — also drew the youthful superhero team the Teen Titans, a revival of Plastic Man, and, in the late 1960s, such short-lived titles as &quot;Hawk and Dove&quot; and the licensed-character comic &quot;Captain Action&quot;, based on the action figure. Kane and Marv Wolfman created an origin for Wonder Girl in &quot;Teen Titans&quot; #22 (July–Aug. 1969) which introduced the character&#x27;s new costume.

He briefly freelanced some Hulk stories in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot;, first under the pseudonym Scott Edward and then in his own name, defying the practice in which DC artists moonlighting at Marvel used pseudonyms. He and writer/editor Stan Lee introduced the Abomination as an enemy of the Hulk in &quot;Tales to Astonish&quot; #90 (April 1967). Kane also freelanced in the 1960s for Tower Comics&#x27; &quot;T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents&quot;, a superhero/espionage title, as well as the &quot;Tiger Boy&quot; strip for Harvey Comics. Kane then found a home at Marvel, eventually becoming the regular penciller for &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;, succeeding John Romita in the early 1970s, and becoming the company&#x27;s preeminent cover artist through that decade. Kane&#x27;s first Spider-Man storyline culminated in the death of supporting character George Stacy.

During that run, he and editor-writer Stan Lee produced in 1971 a three-issue story arc in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #96-98 (May–July 1971) that marked the first challenge to the industry&#x27;s self-regulating Comics Code Authority since its inception in 1954. The Code forbade mention of drugs, even in a negative context. However, Lee and Kane created an anti-drug storyline conceived at the behest of the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and upon not receiving Code Authority approval, Marvel published the issues without the Code seal on their covers. The comics met with such positive reception and high sales that the industry&#x27;s self-censorship was undercut, and the Code soon afterward was revamped. Another landmark in Kane&#x27;s Spider-Man run was the arc &quot;The Night Gwen Stacy Died&quot; in issues #121–122 (June–July 1973), in which Spider-Man&#x27;s girlfriend Gwen Stacy, as well as the long-time villain Green Goblin were killed, an unusual occurrence at the time.

With writer Roy Thomas, Kane helped revise the Marvel Comics version of Captain Marvel, and revamped a preexisting character as Adam Warlock. Kane and Thomas co-created the martial arts superhero Iron Fist, and Morbius the Living Vampire. Kane and writer Gerry Conway transformed John Jameson, an incidental character in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; series, into the Man-Wolf.

Conway, Kane&#x27;s collaborator on the death-of-Gwen-Stacy storyline and elsewhere, described Kane in 2009 as

===Pioneering new formats===
Kane&#x27;s side projects include two long works that he conceived, plotted and illustrated, with scripting by Archie Goodwin (writing under the pseudonym of Robert Franklin): &quot;His Name Is... Savage&quot; (Adventure House Press, 1968), a self-published, 40-page, magazine-format comics novel; and &quot;Blackmark&quot; (1971), a science-fiction/sword-and-sorcery paperback published by Bantam Books and one of the earliest examples of the graphic novel, a term not in general use at the time. Howard Chaykin served as Kane&#x27;s assistant during the production of &quot;Blackmark&quot; and would call Kane &quot;the most influential male&quot; in his life.

===Later career===
During the 1970s and 1980s, Kane did character designs for various Hanna-Barbera and Ruby-Spears animated TV series including &quot;The Centurions&quot; which he co-created with Jack Kirby. In 1974 he contributed to redesigning the obscure Marvel Comics character the Cat into Tigra, and three years later created the newspaper daily comic strip &quot;Star Hawks&quot; with writer Ron Goulart. The strip, which ran through 1981, was known for its experimental use of a two-tier format during the first years. During this decade he also illustrated paperback and record-album covers, drew model box art, and co-wrote, with John Jakes, the 1980 novel &quot;Excalibur!&quot; He drew the &quot;John Carter, Warlord of Mars&quot; series for Marvel beginning in June 1977.

In 1971, Kane met Michel &quot;Greg&quot; Regnier, then the editor of French-Belgian comics anthology Tintin Weekly. He ended up creating a science fiction/fantasy tale called &quot;Jason Drum&quot;, about an astronaut stranded on a sword and sorcery world. The series debuted in Tintin weekly, making the cover of #202 (July 1979). Due to a medical emergency Kane reached out to Joe Staton to help with layouts and, starting with Tintin #205, uninked penciled pages were sent to France. Belgian artist Franz inked five pages of Kane’s pencils and pencilled and inked the last pages of the story himself (in #206 and 207 [Aug. ’78]). After his recovery, Kane lost contact with Tintin. In 2006 Kane´s friend Gary Groth and publisher at Fantagraphics discovered that Kane did evidently finish the Jason Drum project with 44 fully inked pages with dialogue. The project had never been published in English, but the original 27 page version assisted by Staton and Franz was published in some other languages including Swedish (as back-up in Lee Falk&#x27;s The Phantom in 1980).

Kane was one of the artists on the double-sized &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #200 (March 1982), and had a brief run on &quot;The Micronauts&quot; series in 1982. In the early 1980s, he shared regular art duties on the Superman feature in &quot;Action Comics&quot; with Curt Swan and contributed to the 1988 &quot;Superman&quot; animated TV series. The Brainiac character, a nemesis of Superman, was revised by Kane and Marv Wolfman in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #544 (June 1983). He was one of the contributors to the &quot;DC Challenge&quot; limited series in 1986. Kane was the artist on the early Green Lantern serial in the short-lived anthology &quot;Action Comics Weekly&quot; from issues #601–605 with writer James Owsley, and illustrated the Nightwing cover for issue #627 in 1988. He returned to drawing the Atom in the &quot;Sword of the Atom&quot; limited series, a collaboration with writer Jan Strnad. In 1989–1990 Kane illustrated a comic-book adaptation of Richard Wagner&#x27;s mythological opera epic &quot;The Ring of the Nibelung&quot;.

During the following decade, Kane drew for publishers including Topps Comics, for which he illustrated a miniseries adaptation of the film &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;; Malibu Comics, for which he and writer Steven Grant created the superhero Edge for a 1994–95 miniseries; Awesome Entertainment, in which he illustrated Alan Moore&#x27;s four-page Kid Thunder story &quot;Judgment Day: 1868&quot; in &quot;Judgment Day Alpha&quot; #1 (June 1997); and DC, for which he drew several Superman stories. He was one of the many creators who contributed to the &quot;&quot; one-shot wherein the title character married Lois Lane. He and his former apprentice Howard Chaykin worked together again on a three-part story for &quot;&quot; #24–26 (Nov. 1991 – Jan. 1992) and the &quot;Superman: Distant Fires&quot; one-shot (1998).

Kane collaborated with writer Mark Waid on &quot;The Life Story of the Flash&quot; graphic novel. As well during that decade, he designed the set of the 1997 Santa Monica Playhouse production of the play &quot;Lovely!&quot;.

Though his last full comic during his lifetime was Awesome&#x27;s 40-page &quot;Judgment Day: Aftermath&quot; #1 (March 1998) — written by Moore and featuring the characters and teams Glory, Spacehunter, Youngblood and others in individual tales — his final narrative works, all for DC, were penciling the two-page &quot;Antibiotics: The Killers That Save Lives&quot; in &quot;Celebrate the Century: Super Heroes Stamp Album&quot; #5 (1999); portions of seven pages and the cover, all shared with humor artist Sergio Aragonés, of DC&#x27;s &quot;Fanboy&quot; #2 (April 1999); and a two-page pastiche of 1970s Hostess Fruit Pie superhero ads, &quot;The Star Sheriffs&quot;, in &quot;Green Lantern Secret Files and Origins&quot; #2 (Sept. 1999). His last published comics art during his lifetime was a one-page illustration in Dark Horse Comics&#x27; &quot;Sin City: Hell and Back&quot; #4 (Oct. 1999). Posthumously published was his final completed work, the two-issue Green Lantern / Atom story in &quot;Legends of the DC Universe&quot; #28–29 (May–June 2000); and four years later, the final issue, drawn in the mid-1990s, of Malibu&#x27;s planned four-issue miniseries &quot;Edge&quot;, as part of the iBooks hardcover collection &quot;The Last Heroes&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
He remained active as an artist until his death on January 31, 2000, in Miami, Florida from complications of lymphoma. He was survived by his second wife, Elaine; as well as a son and two stepchildren, Scott, Eric and Beverly. For a time the family lived in Wilton, Connecticut, where he was drama chairman of the Wilton Arts Council. His final home was Aventura, Florida.

An homage to Kane and to writer John Broome appears in &quot;In Darkest Night&quot;, a novelization of the &quot;Justice League&quot; animated series. The book refers to the Kane/Broome Institute for Space Studies in Coast City. The Broome Kane Galaxy in &quot;Green Lantern: Emerald Knights&quot; is named for him and John Broome. Writer Alan Moore made Kane a character in Awesome Comics&#x27; &quot;Judgment Day: Aftermath&quot; which Kane illustrated.

While he was alive, Kane was made the lead character in writer Mike Friedrich&#x27;s story &quot;His Name Is... Kane&quot; (a play on Kane&#x27;s &quot;His Name Is... Savage&quot;) in DC Comics&#x27; supernatural anthology &quot;House of Mystery&quot; #180 (June 1969). In the six-and-a-half-page tale, penciled by Kane and inked by Wally Wood, frustrated comic-book artist Gil Kane kills his &quot;House of Mystery&quot; editor, Joe Orlando. Orlando, also an artist, and Friedrich exact revenge by drawing Kane into artwork that is then framed and mounted in the house.

Kane&#x27;s work has been extensively reprinted. Marvel Comics released &quot;Marvel Visionaries Gil Kane&quot; in 2002 and DC Comics published &quot;Adventures of Superman: Gil Kane&quot; in 2013. IDW Publishing released an &quot;artist&#x27;s edition&quot;, a reproduction of the original art, of Kane&#x27;s Spider-Man work in 2012.

==Awards and exhibitions==
Kane received numerous awards over the years, including the 1971, 1972, and 1975 National Cartoonists Society Awards for Comic Books: Story, and the group&#x27;s &quot;Newspaper Strip: Story Strip Award&quot; for 1977 for &quot;Star Hawks&quot;.

He also received the comic book industry&#x27;s Shazam Award for Special Recognition in 1971 &quot;for &quot;Blackmark&quot;, his paperback comics novel&quot; and was given an Inkpot Award in 1975. Kane was named to both the Eisner Award Hall of Fame and the Harvey Award Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1997.

Work by Kane was part of the 1995 Muckenthaler Cultural Center exhibit &quot;KAPOW: A Showcase of Superheroes&quot;, in Fullerton, California.

<text>Winterton is a market town and civil parish in North Lincolnshire, England, north-east of Scunthorpe. The 2021 census found 4,765 inhabitants living in the town. Winterton is located near the banks of the Humber and is south-west of the Humber Bridge which can be seen from many parts of the town.

As of 2022, the mayor of Winterton is Marilynne Harrison.

==History==

Winterton has a history going back to Roman times and several large mosaic floors and other Roman remains have been found there.

In October 1968, during road-widening works on the A1077, workers found a massive stone coffin containing a skeleton later identified as being that of a young woman aged between 20 and 25 years of age, who stood tall (the so-called Winterton Lady). She was of high status, as evidenced by the high quality of the coffin made from a single block of limestone and she was also found to be laid on a sheet of lead. Down the hill from this spot are the remains of one of the Winterton Roman villas, which is famous for its mosaic pavements where it is most likely she lived.

Both Winterton and neighbouring Winteringham seem to contain mention of &quot;Winter&quot; or &quot;Wintra&quot;, the first of the kings of Lindsey with any pretence to an historical basis (after the mythological Woden). The position of the two settlements on the south bank of the Humber, close to the point where the main Roman road from the south reaches the river, may be significant, as it is the obvious point from where the settlement of Lindsey is likely to have originated.

The town was also served by the former North Lindsey Light Railway which connected the town to Scunthorpe via Winteringham. The former railway station is now long since closed and is currently disused. The station was between the town and neighbouring village Thealby.

== Winterton Agricultural Show ==
The Winterton Agricultural Society was formed in 1872 to further the interests of a rapidly modernising agricultural community. For many years the society held a two-day Agricultural Show and sports in the town.

Today, the two day show occupies over 20 acres, which the society now owns to accommodate the growing demand for trade stands, sideshows and entertainment. The show caters for many agricultural and countryside pursuits involving all elements of the local and neighbouring communities. It successfully blends a variety of events appealing to both rural and town dwellers; as a consequence it is very well supported, drawing crowds in excess of twelve thousand from across the region.

==Toponymy==

The village&#x27;s name is thought to mean the ‘farmstead, the village or the estate of the &quot;Winteringas&quot;&#x27;, who were perhaps followers or dependants of someone called &quot;Winter&quot; or &quot;Wintra&quot;. In the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 the place is called variously &quot;Wintrintune&quot;, once; &quot;Wintrintone&quot;, four times; &quot;Wintritone&quot;, twice and &quot;Wintretune&quot;, once.

==Notable people==

<doc id="848569" wikidata="Q93181" url="?curid=848569" title="Ehud Olmert">
<text>Ehud Olmert (; , ; born 30 September 1945) is an Israeli politician and lawyer. He served as the 12th prime minister of Israel from 2006 to 2009 and before that as a cabinet minister from 1988 to 1992 and from 2003 to 2006. Between his first and second stints as a cabinet member, he served as mayor of Jerusalem from 1993 to 2003. After serving as prime minister, he was sentenced to serve a prison term over convictions for accepting bribes and for obstruction of justice during his terms as mayor of Jerusalem and as trade minister.

==Biography==
Ehud Olmert was born near Binyamina in the British Mandate of Palestine. According to Olmert, his parents, Bella (Wagman) and Mordechai Olmert, escaped &quot;persecution in Ukraine and Russia, and found sanctuary in Harbin, China. They immigrated to Israel to fulfill their dream of building a Jewish and democratic state living in peace in the land of our ancestors.&quot; His father later became a member of the Knesset for Herut. Olmert&#x27;s childhood included membership in the Beitar Youth Organization and dealing with the fact that his parents were often blacklisted and alienated due to their affiliation with the Jewish militia group the Irgun. They were also part of Herut, the opposition to the long-ruling Mapai party. However, by the 1970s, this was proving less detrimental to one&#x27;s career than during the 1950s.

Olmert graduated from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem with degrees in psychology, philosophy and law. He opened a successful law partnership in Jerusalem. Olmert served with the Israel Defense Forces in the Golani Brigade. While in service he was injured and temporarily released. He underwent many treatments, and later completed his military duties as a journalist for the IDF magazine &quot;BaMahane&quot;. During the Yom Kippur War, he joined the headquarters of Ariel Sharon as a military correspondent. Already a member of the Knesset, he decided to go through an officer&#x27;s course in 1980 at the age of 35.

Olmert is married to Aliza, an author, playwright and artist. The couple has four biological children and an adopted daughter. The oldest daughter, Michal, holds a master&#x27;s in psychology and leads workshops in creative thinking. Another daughter Dana is a lecturer in literature at the Tel Aviv University, and the editor of a literature series. She is a lesbian and lives with her partner in Tel Aviv. Her parents are accepting of her sexual orientation and partner. Dana is active in the Jerusalem branch of the Israeli human rights organization Machsom Watch. In June 2006 she attended a march in Tel Aviv protesting alleged Israeli complicity in the Gaza beach blast, which made her the subject of bitter criticism from right-wing personalities.
Olmert&#x27;s father Mordechai, a pioneer of Israel&#x27;s land settlement and a former member of the Second and Third Knessets, grew up in the Chinese city of Harbin, where he led the local Betar youth movement. Olmert&#x27;s grandfather J. J. Olmert settled in Harbin after fleeing post-World War I Russia. In 2004, Olmert visited China and paid his respects at the tomb of his grandfather in Harbin. Olmert said that his father had never forgotten his Chinese hometown after moving to what was then the British Mandate of Palestine, in 1933, at the age of 22. &quot;When he died at the age of 88, he spoke his last words in Mandarin Chinese&quot;, he recalled.

In October 2007, Olmert was diagnosed with prostate cancer.

==Political career==
===Member of Knesset and Minister===
In 1966, during the Gahal party convention (a predecessor to today&#x27;s Likud), party leader Menachem Begin was challenged by the young Olmert, who called for his resignation. Begin announced that he would retire from party leadership, but soon reversed his decision when the crowd emotionally pleaded with him to stay. Olmert was first elected to the Knesset in 1973 at the age of 28, and was re-elected seven consecutive times. Between 1981 and 1989, he served as a member of the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee and served on the Finance, Education and Defense Budget Committees. He served as minister without portfolio, responsible for minority affairs between 1988 and 1990, and as minister of health from 1990 until 1992. Following Likud&#x27;s defeat in the 1992 election, instead of remaining a Knesset member in the opposition, he successfully ran for mayor of Jerusalem in November 1993.

===Mayor of Jerusalem===
Between 1993 and 2003, Olmert served two terms as mayor of Jerusalem, the first member of Likud or its precursors to hold the position. During his term in office, he devoted himself to the initiation and advancement of major projects in the city, the development and improvement of the education system, and the development of road infrastructure. He also spearheaded the development of the light rail system in Jerusalem, and the investment of millions of shekels in the development of mass transportation options for the city.

While mayor of Jerusalem, Olmert was an invited speaker at an international conflict resolution conference held in Derry, Northern Ireland. In his address, he spoke of how &quot;Political leaders can help change the psychological climate which affects the quality of relationships among people.&quot; His speech concluded with reflections on the importance of political process in overcoming differences: &quot;How are fears born? They are born because of differences in tradition and history; they are born because of differences in emotional, political and national circumstances. Because of such differences, people fear they cannot live together. If we are to overcome such fear, a credible and healthy political process must be carefully and painfully developed. A political process that does not aim to change the other or to overcome differences, but that allows each side to live peacefully in spite of their differences.&quot;

Olmert ran unsuccessfully in the September 1999 Likud leadership election.

===Deputy prime minister===
Olmert was elected as a member of the sixteenth Knesset in January 2003. He served as the head of the election campaign for Likud in the elections, and subsequently was the chief negotiator of the coalition agreement. Following the elections he was appointed as Designated Acting Prime Minister and Minister of Industry, Trade and Labor. From 2003 to 2004, he also served as Minister of Communications.

On 7 August 2005, Olmert was appointed acting finance minister, replacing Benjamin Netanyahu, who had resigned in protest against the planned Israeli withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Olmert, who had originally opposed withdrawing from land captured in the Six-Day War, and who had voted against the Camp David Peace Accords in 1978, was a vocal supporter of the Gaza pullout. After his appointment, Olmert said:I voted against Menachem Begin, I told him it was a historic mistake, how dangerous it would be, and so on and so on. Now I am sorry he is not alive for me to be able to publicly recognize his wisdom and my mistake. He was right and I was wrong. Thank God we pulled out of the Sinai. When Sharon announced he was leaving Likud to form a new party, Kadima, Olmert was one of the first to join him.

===Acting prime minister===
On 4 January 2006, as the designated Acting Prime Minister, Olmert became Acting Prime Minister as a result of the serious stroke suffered by then Prime Minister Ariel Sharon. This occurred after consultations took place between Cabinet Secretary Yisrael Maimon and Attorney General Menachem Mazuz, who declared Sharon &quot;temporarily incapable to carry out the duties of his office&quot;, while only officially in office. Then, Olmert and the cabinet reaffirmed in an announcement that the 28 March elections would be held as scheduled. During the days following the stroke, Olmert met with Shimon Peres and other Sharon supporters to try to convince them to stay with Kadima, rather than return to Likud or, in Peres&#x27; case, Labor. On 16 January 2006, Olmert was elected chairman of Kadima, and Kadima&#x27;s candidate for prime minister in the upcoming election. In his first major policy address on 24 January 2006 after becoming caretaker prime minister, Olmert stated that he backed the creation of a Palestinian state, and that Israel would have to relinquish parts of the West Bank to maintain its Jewish majority. At the same time, he said, &quot;We firmly stand by the historic right of the people of Israel to the entire Land of Israel.&quot; In a number of interviews, he also introduced his Realignment plan, which would see Israel unilaterally withdraw from most of the West Bank and redraw its borders to incorporate major settlement blocs into Israel. The plan was shelved following the 2006 Lebanon War.

Following the March 2006 election, Kadima won 29 seats, making it the largest party. On 6 April, Olmert was officially asked by President Moshe Katsav to form a government. Olmert had an initial period of 28 days to form a governing coalition, with a possible two-week extension. On 11 April, the Israeli Cabinet deemed that Sharon was incapacitated. The 100-day replacement deadline was extended due to the Jewish festival of Passover, and a provision was made that, should Sharon&#x27;s condition improve between 11 and 14 April, the declaration would not take effect. Therefore, the official declaration took effect on 14 April, formally ending Sharon&#x27;s term as prime minister and making Olmert the country&#x27;s new Interim Prime Minister in office (he would not become the official prime minister until he formed a government).

==Prime minister of Israel==

On 4 May 2006, Olmert presented his new government to the Knesset. Olmert became prime minister and minister for welfare. Control over the Welfare Ministry was expected to be given to United Torah Judaism if it would join the government. The post was later given to Labor&#x27;s Isaac Herzog. Olmert took over as acting prime minister of Israel after Ariel Sharon suffered a stroke.

On 24 May 2006, Olmert was invited to address a joint session of the U.S. Congress. He stated that his government would proceed with the disengagement plan if it could not come to agreement with the Palestinians. Olmert was the third Israeli prime minister to have been invited to speak at a joint session of Congress.

Following the 2006 Lebanon War, Olmert&#x27;s popularity ratings fell and, on 15 September 2006, former chief of staff Moshe Ya&#x27;alon publicly stated that Olmert should resign. In May 2007, Olmert&#x27;s approval rating fell to 3%, and he became the subject of a Google Bomb for the Hebrew for &quot;miserable failure&quot;.

On 9 December 2006, Olmert stated that he could not rule out the possibility of a military attack against Iran, and called for the international community to step up action against that country. He called Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad&#x27;s repeated threats to destroy Israel &quot;absolutely criminal&quot;, and said that he expected &quot;more dramatic steps to be taken&quot;. In an interview with German TV network Sat.1 on 11 December 2006, Olmert included Israel in a list of nuclear powers, saying: &quot;Iran, openly, explicitly and publicly, threatens to wipe Israel off the map. Can you say that this is the same level, when they are aspiring to have nuclear weapons, as America, France, Israel and Russia?&quot; He immediately attempted to backtrack, insisting that Israel&#x27;s doggedly held position of nuclear weapons ambiguity had not changed. He nonetheless came under harsh criticism from both ends of the Israeli political spectrum due to the perceived threat to Israel&#x27;s policy of ambiguity regarding its nuclear status. On 2 May 2007, the Winograd Commission accused Olmert of failing to properly manage the 2006 Lebanese War, which prompted a mass rally of over 100,000 people calling for his resignation.

Olmert welcomed the Arab League&#x27;s 2007 re-endorsement of the Arab Peace Initiative. Olmert wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper that Israel was ready to make &quot;painful concessions&quot; to achieve peace with the Palestinians.
&quot;I take the offer of full normalization of relations between Israel and the Arab world seriously; and I am ready to discuss the Arab peace initiative in an open and sincere manner. Working with our Jordanian and Egyptian partners, and hopefully other Arab states, we must pursue a comprehensive peace with energy and vision... But the talks must be a discussion, not an ultimatum.&quot; On 4 November 2007, he declared Israel&#x27;s intention to negotiate with the Palestinians about all issues, stating, &quot;Annapolis will be the jumping-off point for continued serious and in-depth negotiations, which will not avoid any issue or ignore any division that has clouded our relations with the Palestinian people for many years.&quot; On 29 November 2007, he warned of the end of Israel in case a two-state solution is not eventually found for the Israeli-Palestinian dispute. &quot;If the day comes when the two-state solution collapses, and we face a South African-style struggle for equal voting rights (also for the Palestinians in the territories), then, as soon as that happens, the State of Israel is finished&quot;, Olmert said on the last day of the Annapolis Conference. &quot;The Jewish organizations, which were our power base in America, will be the first to come out against us&quot;, Olmert said, &quot;because they will say they cannot support a state that does not support democracy and equal voting rights for all its residents&quot;.

During the talks, Olmert agreed that Israel would share Jerusalem as the joint capital of Israel and a Palestinian state and hand over its holy sites to a multinational committee, land swaps that would allow Israel to keep its major settlement blocs in the West Bank, the construction of a tunnel connecting the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and a demilitarized Palestinian state with an American-led international security force stationed on the Palestinian–Jordanian border. Both sides disagreed over how much land would be exchanged in the swaps, with Olmert demanding at least 6.3–6.8% of the West Bank and Abbas insisting a swap would not exceed 1.9%. In his memoirs, Olmert wrote that he agreed Israel would generously compensate the remaining refugees. Olmert later stated that U.S. President George W. Bush offered to accept another 100,000 refugees as American citizens if a peace agreement was signed. U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice wrote in her memoirs that the Palestinians demanded they be allowed to negotiate additional &quot;returns&quot; to Israel following the peace deal, insisting that the right of return was a matter of individual choice that would ultimately have to apply to every refugee. In his memoirs, Olmert claimed that he and Abbas were very close to an agreement, but Abbas&#x27; hesitation, Olmert&#x27;s legal troubles, and the Gaza War (2008–09) caused the talks to end. President Bush wrote in his memoirs that the talks broke down when Olmert announced that he would resign from office, and Abbas then broke off the talks and refused to finalize an agreement on the grounds that he did not want to sign a peace deal with a prime minister on his way out of office.

During at least two meetings, Olmert made a secret promise to Abbas: Once a prisoner exchange deal for captive Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit was finalized with Hamas, Israel would bolster Abbas&#x27; government by releasing Fatah prisoners. After a prisoner exchange deal was agreed upon in 2011 under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Olmert&#x27;s successor, Palestinian officials demanded that Netanyahu live up to Olmert&#x27;s promise and release Fatah prisoners.

On 6 September 2007, Israel launched Operation Orchard, an airstrike against a suspected nuclear reactor in Syria, allegedly being built with North Korean and Iranian assistance. The strike was preceded by years of covert operations by Israeli special forces and the Mossad. Details of the strike were censored in Israel, and the attack was not confirmed to have taken place until 2 October. Following the attack, Olmert&#x27;s approval rating rose to 35%.

President Bush wrote in his memoirs that Olmert had first asked him to bomb the facility, but ordered the attack after Bush refused and told him that he would prefer diplomatic action and sanctions. Following the strike, Bush claimed to have suggested to Olmert to hide the strike for a while and then make it public as a way to isolate the Syrian government, but Olmert asked for total secrecy, wanting to avoid anything that could force Syria to retaliate. However, Israeli columnist Caroline Glick wrote that Israel had bowed to US demands in concealing the airstrike.

In May 2008, Israel opened Turkish-brokered indirect peace talks with Syria. Olmert stated that the resumption of peace talks with Syria was a national obligation that must be tried. However, Syria broke off the talks several months later in response to the Gaza War.

Rocket and mortar attacks by Palestinian militants from the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip on Israel occurred frequently throughout the spring and summer of 2008, until a ceasefire was agreed between Hamas and Israel in June. Rocket attacks increased sharply in November after an Israeli raid on a Hamas-built smuggling tunnel. The ceasefire expired in December 2008 and negotiations stalled between the two parties to renew the ceasefire. On 24 December, the Negev was hit by more than 60 mortar shells and Katyusha and Qassam rockets, and the IDF was given a green light to operate. Hamas claimed to have fired a total of 87 rockets and mortar rounds that day at Israel, code-naming the firing &quot;Operation Oil Stain&quot;.

On 25 December 2008, Olmert delivered a &quot;last minute&quot; warning to Gaza in direct appeal to Gaza&#x27;s people via the Arabic language satellite channel al-Arabiya, to pressure their leaders to stop the rocket barrages. &quot;I am telling them now, it may be the last minute, I&#x27;m telling them stop it. We are stronger&quot;, he said. The attacks did not stop and Israel launched its military operation, codenamed &quot;Operation Cast Lead&quot;, on the morning of 27 December, when more than 50 fighter jets and attack helicopters began to bomb strategic targets. Air and naval strikes continued for days, when on 3 January 2009 the IDF began a ground invasion of the Gaza Strip. The fighting lasted 22 days until a ceasefire came into effect. Israel subsequently withdrew from Gaza.

On 1 February 2009, Olmert stated:
The UN Security Council passed a resolution on 8 January 2009 calling for an immediate ceasefire to the hostilities in the Gaza Strip. It passed 14–0–1, with one abstention from the United States. Olmert told reporters, &quot;[U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice] was left shamed. A resolution that she prepared and arranged, and in the end she did not vote in favor. In the night between Thursday and Friday, when the Secretary of State wanted to lead the vote on a ceasefire at the Security Council, we did not want her to vote in favor. I said &#x27;get me President Bush on the phone&#x27;. They said he was in the middle of giving a speech in Philadelphia. I said I didn&#x27;t care. &#x27;I need to talk to him now&#x27;. He got off the podium and spoke to me. I told him the United States could not vote in favor. It cannot vote in favor of such a resolution. He immediately called the Secretary of State and told her not to vote in favor.&quot; When asked about the comments, a White House spokesman said that Olmert&#x27;s version of events was &quot;inaccurate&quot;.

The war ended on 18 January 2009. A day before, Israeli officials announced a unilateral ceasefire, without an agreement with Hamas. In a press conference, Olmert declared the ceasefire effective that night, at 00:00 GMT.

==Resignation==
On 30 July 2008, Olmert announced that he would not contest the Kadima party leadership election in September and would resign from office once his party elects a new leader. In his resignation speech, he said he was &quot;proud to be a citizen of a country in which a Prime Minister can be investigated like any other citizen&quot;, but also stated he &quot;was forced to defend [himself] from ceaseless attacks by the self-appointed soldiers of justice, who sought to oust [him] from [his] position&quot;. The move was interpreted as signaling the end of Olmert&#x27;s political career.

Many politicians across the political spectrum praised Olmert&#x27;s decision to resign. Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni said &quot;the personal decision was not simple, but it was a correct one. Kadima must continue to act in a way that will preserve its unity and ability to lead.&quot; Defense minister and Labor party leader Ehud Barak called Olmert&#x27;s announcement &quot;a proper and responsible decision made at the right time&quot;. Opposition leaders called for the resignation to be followed by general elections. The Likud party leader, Benjamin Netanyahu, called for snap elections: &quot;It doesn&#x27;t matter who heads Kadima. They are all partners in this government&#x27;s total failure. National responsibility requires a return to the people and new elections.&quot;

After Tzipi Livni won the leadership election, Olmert officially resigned but remained prime minister, according to the dictates of the law. Even after an official resignation, he remained in power until a new prime minister was sworn in, in order to prevent a government void. Livni tried unsuccessfully to form a new coalition government. After Livni announced she could not form the new government, new parliamentary elections were set for 10 February 2009, and Olmert remained in power until after the elections, just as the law dictates.

==Corruption and bribery investigations==
Beginning in the mid-1980s, Olmert was subjected to a string of corruption allegations that resulted in multiple police investigations. According to Israeli journalist Yossi Melman, the repeated investigations led some to believe that Olmert was corrupt but a master at covering his tracks, while others believed that the authorities were simply obsessed with harassing him.

On 7 March 2006, it was disclosed that an inquiry was being carried out on the 1999 sale and lease-back of a Jerusalem property purchased by Olmert in 2004, which allegedly was done on financial terms very favorable to Olmert, in what would amount to an illegal campaign contribution and/or bribe. Olmert was alleged to have paid $325,000 below market value. A criminal investigation regarding the matter was formally launched on 24 September 2007. The investigation closed in August 2009 due to lack of evidence.

On 16 January 2007, a criminal investigation was initiated against Olmert on suspicion that during his tenure as finance minister, he tried to steer the tender for the sale of Bank Leumi in order to help Slovak-born Australian real estate baron Frank Lowy, a close personal associate. Israeli Finance Ministry Accountant General Dr. Yaron Zelekha was as a key witness, according to the State Comptroller&#x27;s office. The state comptroller testified against Olmert. Israeli Police who investigated the case eventually concluded that the evidence that was collected was insufficient for indictment, and no recommendations were made to press charges. In October 2007, he was questioned for five hours by three officers from the National Fraud Investigations Unit in his Jerusalem residence. State Prosecutor Moshe Lador closed the case in December 2008 due to lack of evidence.

In April 2007, it was further alleged that while Olmert was Minister of Trade, Industry and Labor, he may have been guilty of criminal behavior by taking an active part in an investment center. Prosecutors said that Olmert placed himself in a conflict of interest by personally dealing with issues involving business figures represented by his friend and former business partner, lawyer Uri Messer. Olmert was alleged to have changed some decisions made by his ministry in their favor. During a parliamentary inquest in July 2007, Olmert flatly denied these accusations.

In October 2007, Attorney General Mazuz ordered a police investigation into allegations that Olmert, when he held the positions of trade minister, communications minister and finance minister, had improperly appointed associates from the Likud party to posts on government bodies. Police completed their investigation in 2009, and concluded that there was a basis to indict Olmert and others for fraud and breach of trust.

In July 2008, &quot;Haaretz&quot; reported that in 1992, Olmert took a loan from U.S. businessman Joe Almaliah but never repaid it and concealed the size of the loan from the State Comptroller. In March 2003, State Comptroller Eliezer Goldberg asked Olmert to submit the wealth-declaration statement required of all cabinet ministers. Olmert disclosed that he had taken a loan from Almaliah, but did not say when it was due. In 2004, Olmert conceded that he had taken $75,000, and stressed that Almaliah had not asked for repayment of the loan. At Goldberg&#x27;s insistence, Olmert signed a contract with Almaliah undertaking to repay the loan in January 2009. According to an indictment, Olmert had actually taken another $100,000 from Almaliah, which was deposited into his personal bank account. The State Prosecutor&#x27;s office said that it was not aware of Olmert&#x27;s repayment of either loan.

===Bribery investigation===
In May 2008, Olmert was the subject of another police investigation on allegations of bribery. Olmert said that he took campaign contributions from Jewish-American businessman Morris Talansky when he was running for mayor of Jerusalem, leadership of the Likud and candidacy in the Likud list for the Knesset. It was alleged that Olmert unlawfully received millions of shekels in illegal campaign funding from Talansky over a 15-year period. Olmert resisted calls to resign, and stated: &quot;I never took bribes, I never took a penny for myself. I was elected by you, citizens of Israel, to be the Prime Minister and I don&#x27;t intend to shirk this responsibility. If Attorney General Meni Mazuz, decides to file an indictment, I will resign from my position, even though the law does not oblige me to do so.&quot; On 2 May, head of the National Fraud Investigations Unit Brigadier-General Shlomi Ayalon and two investigators questioned Olmert for 90 minutes in his Jerusalem residence. On 23 May, National Fraud Investigations Unit officers interrogated Olmert for an hour in his Jerusalem residence. On 27 May, Talansky testified in court that over the last 15 years he gave Olmert more than $150,000 in cash in envelopes to fund political campaigns, and hinted that Olmert also used the money for fine hotels, cigars, pens and watches. On 6 September 2008, the Israel Police recommended that criminal charges should be brought against Olmert. In their indictment, prosecutors claimed that Olmert had received some $600,000 from Talansky in either cash or bank transfers, and that $350,000 of this was held in a &quot;secret cache&quot; managed by Olmert&#x27;s close associate Uri Messer. The prosecution also claimed that Olmert used his official capacity as minister of trade and industry to facilitate introductions with hotel managers for Talansky, a partner in a firm providing mini-bars for hotels. It was alleged that Olmert sometimes used official letterheads. The charge sheet said that Olmert was aware he was in an &quot;acute conflict of interest&quot;.

On 26 November 2008, Attorney General Menachem Mazuz informed Olmert that he would be indicted in the so-called &quot;Rishon Tours&quot; affair, pending a hearing before Mazuz. The scheme allegedly worked as follows: Olmert would speak abroad on behalf of groups such as the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial, a support group for the Israel Defense Forces or a charity for mentally disabled Israeli children. Rishon Tours then billed each group for the same trip as if they alone were paying, and placed the money in a special bank account allegedly for Olmert&#x27;s personal use. Prosecutors charged that Olmert had gained $92,164.

On 1 March 2009, Attorney General Mazuz announced that he would file an indictment against him in what is known as the &quot;cash envelopes&quot; affair, pending a hearing before the attorney general.

In 2010, the National Fraud Investigations Unit accused Olmert of involvement in the &quot;Holyland Affair&quot;, where officials took bribes in exchange for promoting real estate projects, especially the Holyland real estate development project in southwest Jerusalem, which was allowed to grow 1,200% beyond the limit authorized. As Mayor of Jerusalem, Olmert allegedly took thousands of shekels in bribe money from businessmen, entrepreneurs, and stakeholders.

===Indictments, trials and criminal convictions===
On 30 August 2009, an indictment against Olmert was served at the Jerusalem District Court. The indictment includes the following counts: obtaining by fraud under aggravating circumstances, fraud, breach of trust, falsifying corporate documents, and tax evasion. The indictment refers to three out of the four corruption-related cases standing against him: &quot;Rishon Tours&quot;, &quot;Talansky&quot; (also known as the &quot;money envelopes&quot; affair), and the &quot;Investment Center&quot;. This was the first indictment of someone who has ever held the office of Israeli Prime Minister. On 25 September 2009, Olmert&#x27;s trial opened. The court began hearing testimonies on 22 February 2010, with three discussions per week. The prosecution began arguing its case at the beginning of the trial, and the prosecution phase ended on 30 March 2011. The defense phase began on 31 May, and they began with Olmert testifying in his own defense. On 30 June, the prosecution began a cross-examination on the various charges.

In January 2012, Olmert was indicted for taking bribes over the Holyland affair. The indictment was filed in the Tel Aviv District Court. After Olmert began accusing his secretary, Shula Zaken, of committing the crimes he was charged with, Zaken began negotiating a plea bargain with prosecutors. In late March 2014, prosecutors signed a plea bargain with Zaken, under which she would plead guilty, and prosecutors would not request a prison term longer than 11 months. As part of the plea bargain, Zaken agreed to provide evidence and testify against Olmert as a state&#x27;s witness.

On 10 July 2012, Olmert was convicted on one count of breach of trust over the investment center case, but exonerated over the Talansky and Rishon Tours affairs. In September 2012, he was given a one-year suspended sentence and a fine of ₪75,000 ($21,000).

On 31 March 2014, five years to the day after he was replaced by Benjamin Netanyahu as prime minister, Olmert was convicted of two counts of bribery over the Holyland affair by Tel Aviv District Court Judge David Rosen, who ruled that he had accepted ₪560,000 ($160,000) while serving as mayor of Jerusalem, and had lied about it in court. He was acquitted on two other corruption charges. Olmert and eight other defendants, including former Jerusalem mayor Uri Lupolianski and former Bank Hapoalim chairman Dan Dankner, were convicted of accepting bribes in exchange for helping land developers receive municipality licenses for the Holyland Park residential project in the city.

Olmert&#x27;s sentencing hearing began on 28 April 2014. On 13 May 2014, he was sentenced to 6 years in prison and fined ₪1.5 million ($430,000). He was ordered to report to prison on 1 September to begin serving his sentence.

In addition to the Holyland affair, Zaken provided new evidence against Olmert in the Talansky and Rishon tours affairs. Olmert and his lawyers were subsequently questioned by police on suspicion of obstruction of justice and witness tampering. Following an investigation, police announced that there was sufficient evidence to indict Olmert for obstruction of justice. On 7 August 2014, following Zaken&#x27;s testimony, the Israeli Supreme Court ordered a retrial of Olmert in the Talansky case.

In September 2014, the Supreme Court ruled that Olmert could stay out of prison pending an appeal. Oral arguments would have to take place within three months, but together with the delay in the final verdict he could potentially stay out of prison for over a year. He began serving a 19-month sentence on 15 February 2016 in Maasiyahu Prison.

In December 2014, Zaken again provided new evidence, revealing that Olmert had offered her $10,000 for every month she would serve in jail for taking the blame in the Holyland case, to be paid in a foreign bank account. In one of the eight recordings revealed, Olmert can also be heard talking about buying Sheldon Adelson&#x27;s, a Jewish-American billionaire&#x27;s, testimony, and how he told U.S. President George W. Bush about Olmert&#x27;s traitorship: &quot;Adelson – this dog, son of a dog – went to President Bush and said that I’m a traitor. Bush told me.&quot;

In March 2015, Olmert was convicted in Jerusalem District Court of fraud, breach of trust, and tax evasion in his retrial on corruption charges over the Talansky case. The judges ruled that he had taken bribes and used the funds for personal reasons without reporting it. Sentencing was set for May, and his lawyers advised he would appeal.

Olmert was sentenced to eight months in prison in connection with the Talansky case on 25 May 2015, as well as fined ₪100,000 ($25,000) and given an additional suspended sentence of eight months. The prison sentence was stayed for 45 days to allow Olmert&#x27;s legal team time to appeal the ruling. The verdict acknowledged Olmert&#x27;s public service, and he was given a weaker sentence than prosecutors sought. Olmert filed an appeal of his conviction to the Supreme Court of Israel in July 2015; the court agreed that Olmert&#x27;s sentence would be suspended until after the outcome of the appeal.

Olmert eventually served 16 months of a 27-month prison sentence before being released on parole in early July 2017.

==Post premiership==
In 2009, Olmert spoke at various colleges throughout the United States to mixed receptions. In October 2009, he visited Magnolia, Arkansas, and spoke about Israeli farming, technology and Israel&#x27;s view on Iran. The speech was given at Southern Arkansas University, where he also invited the rural university to form a partnership with Israel&#x27;s Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

In 2012, Olmert expressed opposition to a military strike on Iran. In July 2019, he canceled a visit to Switzerland after being notified that he would face questioning for his role in Operation Cast Lead. In 2021 Israeli legislative election and 2022 Israeli legislative election, he voiced support for the Israeli Labor Party. He also became a &quot;Haaretz&quot; columnist, together with fellow politicians, former Meretz leader Zehava Galon, and former Prime Minister Ehud Barak.

<text>A decommissioned highway is a highway that has been removed from service by being shut down, or has had its authorization as a national, provincial or state highway removed, the latter also referred to as downloading. Decommissioning can include the complete or partial demolition or abandonment of an old highway structure because the old roadway has lost its utility, but such is not always the norm. Where the old highway has continuing value, it likely remains as a local road offering access to properties denied access to the new road or for use by slow vehicles such as farm equipment and horse-drawn vehicles denied use of the newer highway.

Decommissioning can also include the removal of one or more of the multiple designations of a single segment of highway. As an example, what remains as U.S. Route 60 (US 60) between Wickenburg, Arizona, and Phoenix, Arizona, carried the routes of three US Highways (US 60, US 70, US 89) and one state highway (Arizona State Route 93). Since then, US 60 was diverted to other routes.

==United States==

Decommissioned highways are common in the United States. Even in the early years of the United States Numbered Highway System, some highways had short lives as US Highways especially if they were themselves short routes, such as the early US 110 in Wisconsin. Indeed, the fourteen shortest U.S. Numbered Highways that have ever existed were stripped of &quot;US&quot; status in 1982 or earlier. Extensions of US Routes have implied the elimination of earlier designations; for example, US 6, which originally went no farther west than the Hudson River in New York, was extended to Long Beach, California over routes that included an old Indiana State Road 6, most of an old US 32 between Chicago and Omaha, all of US 38 between Omaha and Denver, and an old California State Route 7 mostly in the Mojave Desert. US 6 was itself pared back to Bishop, California, in the Great Renumbering of California in 1964.

As the states build freeways as a new classification of highways, the state may strip the old highway of its old designation as a numbered highway or downgrade it to a lesser status. For example, US 66, which connected Los Angeles and Chicago from 1926 until 1985, lost its designation as a U.S. Highway in favor of faster, more direct Interstate Highways which had supplanted it. Some highways may be partly decommissioned, such as two segments of M-21 in Michigan from Holland to Grand Rapids as Interstate 196 and between Flint and the Canadian border at the Blue Water Bridge as Interstate 69 (I-69) supplanted much of it and M-21 remained in existence between Grand Rapids and Flint. US 33 in Lancaster, Ohio, was signed as US 33 Business following relocation of US 33 and construction to Interstate Highway standards. Other highways have been wholly decommissioned in favor of newer Interstates, as was the case with Texas State Highway 9. However, the reverse can also be done, such as I-170 in Baltimore being removed in favor of US 40 (which was previously routed on parallel-running one-way streets) because its parent route (I-70) had been cancelled due to longstanding opposition.

Some state routes built on freeway alignments may be upgraded to Interstate Highway standards (or already built to Interstate standards) and receive Interstate designation, such as the case with Pennsylvania Route 60 being largely replaced by I-376. On the other hand, some routes are downgraded, as with US 61 in Minnesota, which became Minnesota State Highway 61 from Duluth to the Canadian border. At times, a state can abandon a number as the reason for state maintenance of the entire route no longer exists; Arizona transferred the short Arizona State Route 62 to the Mohave County government after a mine in Chloride closed and so did the economic purpose of the town. At the extreme a decommissioned route may be demolished, as was done with California State Route 480. Once part of the Interstate Highway System, it required retrofitting to remain in service after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake to remain in use; instead the highway was demolished.

&quot;Alternate&quot;, &quot;Bypass&quot; and suffixed routes (such as US 6A in Connecticut, the old US 71 bypass around Kansas City that disappeared in favor of Interstate 435 and Missouri Route 291, and the former US 30S in Ohio) have often been redesignated as lesser routes, in accordance with a policy of the AASHTO that now deprecates such highways, especially if short and confined to one state.

Some states have decommissioned state highways which were within a state-numbered system because significant parts of those highways were not up to state standards, such as being unpaved and unlikely to ever be paved, as with Nevada State Route 49.

Indiana removed all state and US Highway designations in Indianapolis within the Interstate 465 beltway, either truncating the highway at the beltway (U.S. Highway 136), deleting the highway altogether (Indiana State Road 100), or diverting the routes onto the beltway. Similar removals happened in Fort Wayne after the completion of Interstate 469 in 1998. 

A decommissioned route may also find other use besides automobile use. The Abandoned Pennsylvania Turnpike, a bypassed section of the Pennsylvania Turnpike that features two vehicle tunnels that were overcapacity after the Turnpike saw a surge in usage after World War II, is perhaps the most notable example of this, as it has since become a bike and pedestrian trail and, due to using the alignment for the stillborn South Pennsylvania Railroad, is also unofficially a rail trail.

Even as superhighways supplant older surface routes, some historical highways get attention from those with antiquarian (and commercial) interests in the continued recognition of such routes. US 66 in the midwestern and southwestern United States is a prime example of such efforts; &quot;Historic Route US 66&quot; markers, completely unofficial, designate most of the old surface road, some of which has literary significance (as in John Steinbeck&#x27;s novel &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot;).

==Canada==
Many of Quebec&#x27;s Autoroutes supplant old through routes.

In New Brunswick, when a bypass road or freeway is constructed, it normally takes the number of the road it replaced, often removing portions of the old road from the provincial highway system entirely. Most become local or county roads; in some cases (such as the Moncton-Fredericton Highway 2, bypassed as freeway in 2001) a section of the old road would be retained as part of some other provincial highway because it reaches a major town the new road had bypassed.

In 1997 and 1998, the province of Ontario undertook a major highway decommissioning project, dropping over of road from the provincially maintained highway system. Most of the former highways are now numbered as county roads. See also List of former provincial highways in Ontario.

The Thousand Islands Parkway in Ontario was originally four lanes and part of Ontario Highway 401, Canada&#x27;s busiest highway, before 401 traffic was bypassed inland on completion of that freeway in 1968. Two of the lanes are provincially maintained for automobile traffic by the St. Lawrence Parks Commission but the other pair have been replaced with footpaths and a bicycle trail.

==Europe==
In Germany, many Autobahns supplant an older through route, as in Bundesstraße 60 (best translated as Federal Highway 60), which disappeared as the A40 Autobahn supplanted it.

In the Republic of Ireland, National Primary Routes are often realigned after the construction of new motorway sections, dual carriageways or bypasses. The old route thus loses its national route status and is usually redesignated as a Regional Road.

== New South Wales ==
Most (old system) state and national routes in New South Wales are decommissioned routes. Among those was state route 30 between Ryde and Kellyville that existed between 1974 and 1993.

<text>StarBand was a two-way satellite broadband Internet service available in the U.S. from 2000–2015.

StarBand ceased operations effective September 30, 2015 citing increased competition from other internet providers.

The StarBand satellite Internet system was a VSAT platform that used Ku band satellites for transmission of data from users&#x27; PCs to the StarBand network operations center. Two-way bandwidth for residential users was up to 1.5 Mbit/s download speed and 256 kbit/s upload speed, with unlimited usage and online hours. A 0.75 meter satellite dish is needed; the antenna was sufficiently small that homeowner associations could not prohibit its installation.

==History==
StarBand Communications Inc. was initially a joint venture between Gilat Satellite Networks, EchoStar and Microsoft, and the StarBand service launched in 2000. StarBand Communications filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2002 and emerged from bankruptcy in 2003.
In March 2005, StarBand Communications was wholly acquired by Spacenet, a division of Gilat Satellite Networks, which continued to operate the service. As of mid-2005, StarBand had approximately 32,000 subscribers.

StarBand announced in August 2015 that they would cease operations on 30 September 2015, citing competitive pressures from other current satellite internet providers, as well as new higher-bandwidth providers (Starlink and OneWeb) on the horizon, with new constellations slated to come online before 2020.

==Technology==

StarBand offered the first residential two-way satellite Internet service in the United States market. Launched in November 2000, StarBand began selling the Gilat Satellite Networks SkyBlaster PCI card VSAT. Initially, the only way to purchase the StarBand system was to purchase a PC with the send/receive adapter card pre-installed as well as hosting software.

In 2001, StarBand began offering service using standalone VSAT units using the StarBand Model 180 (based on the Gilat Skystar Advantage/180 VSAT) connected via USB. The 180 modem was Windows OS-only because it required specialized Windows drivers for the USB interface.

In 2002, StarBand switched to Gilat&#x27;s Model 360 VSAT, which enabled higher speed and allowed USB or Ethernet connections, but still required driver software to communicate.

In 2003, StarBand introduced the Model 480 modem (based on the Gilat Skystar 360E VSAT), which connected via Ethernet, supported multiple computers/OSes and required no additional software. The 48x series service supported Microsoft Windows PC, Macintosh, Unix and Linux computers. In late 2005, StarBand began selling only Model 480-based services.

In October 2006, StarBand introduced its next-generation service, the StarBand Nova (based on the Gilat SkyEdge series). The StarBand Nova modems were capable of higher speeds, optimized for VoIP, VPN, and worked on a more efficient hub. The SkyEdge modems had one Ethernet port and did not require hosting software for any OS platform.

Initially, StarBand supplied a .76M convergence antenna, which picked up two Dish Network signals and the satellite internet signal. StarBand later supplied a third generation .78M antenna, which required a separate antenna to receive satellite television signals. The third generation antenna provided a longer focal length, which helped to create a better signal-to-noise ratio.

All satellite internet providers such as StarBand measure the amount of data you transfer. Starband had six plans ranging from 500 kbit/s down to 1500 kbit/s down with weekly download limits of 750 Mbytes to 4,000 Mbytes.

<doc id="848597" wikidata="Q7302099" url="?curid=848597" title="Rebellion Losses Bill">
<text>The Rebellion Losses Bill (full name: &quot;An Act to provide for the Indemnification of Parties in Lower Canada whose Property was destroyed during the Rebellion in the years 1837 and 1838&quot;) was a controversial law enacted by the legislature of the Province of Canada in 1849. Its passage and subsequent royal assent, this being a affirmation of responsible government in the colony, by the Governor General, James Bruce, 8th Earl of Elgin makes the bill a landmark piece of legislation in Canadian political history.

The bill was enacted to compensate Lower Canadians who lost property during the Rebellions of 1837 with measures similar to those providing compensation in Upper Canada. Two factors made this measure controversial. Even though participants in the Rebellion could not be compensated with taxpayer&#x27;s money, sympathy for the Rebellion was more widespread in Lower Canada so that compensation in Lower Canada was seen as &quot;giving money to the rebels&quot;. Secondly, the damage done by the army far exceeded the damage done by the rebels, so that enacting provisions to compensate for damages done by the army was considered an act of disloyalty to the Crown.

The enactment of the bill angered some of Montreal&#x27;s Tory citizens and provoked weeks of violent disturbances known as the Montreal Riots. These culminated in the burning of the Parliament building on April 25, 1849, which at the time was in Montreal.

== Draper–Viger government ==
On February 28, 1845, the representatives sitting in the Legislative Assembly unanimously adopted the text of an address asking Governor Metcalfe to take measures to compensate the inhabitants of Lower Canada whose properties were damaged or destroyed during the armed conflict of 1837–8. Prior to that, in the course of the last session of the Parliament of Upper Canada on October 23, 1840, the representatives had passed an act (3 Vict. c. 76) to indemnify certain parties for losses incurred during the uprising in that province in 1837. A credit of £40,000 had been appropriated to address claims made by inhabitants, but no amount had been spent because the treasury of the province was empty. Amending an act passed in 1838, the act of 1840 provided for the indemnification of civilians whose property had been damaged without enquiring into the presumed loyalty of persons during the armed conflict. On its part, the Special Council of Lower Canada had also issued an ordinance, in 1838, to indemnify certain parties, but on the basis of their presumed loyalty to the crown.
On March 29, 1845, the governor assented to a bill allocating the revenue from the tavern licences in Canada West to the payment of claims by habitants settled in the former Upper Canada who had still not received any compensation. A sum of £38,658 was raised between April 5, 1845 and January 24, 1849 by the means of this law. Later, in 1846, the revenues from wedding licences were also allocated for the same purpose. 
Following the adoption of the address to the governor in 1845, the Draper–Viger government set up, on November 24, a commission to enquire into the claims the inhabitants of Lower Canada had sent since 1838, to determine those that were justified and provide an estimate of the amount to be paid. The five commissioners, Joseph Dionne, P. H. Moore, Jacques Viger, John Simpson and Joseph-Ubalde Beaudry, submitted their first report in April 1846. They received instructions from the government to distinguish between claims made by persons participating in the rebellion and those who had given no support to the insurrectionist party. The total of the considered claims receivable amounted to £241,965, 10s. and 5d., but the commissioners were of the opinion that following a more thorough enquiry into the claims they were unable to make, the amount to be paid by the government would likely not go beyond £100,000. The Assembly passed a motion on June 9, 1846, authorizing compensation of £9,986 for claims studied prior to the presentation of the report. Nothing further was accomplished on this question until the dissolution of parliament on December 6, 1847.

== Baldwin–Lafontaine government ==
The general election of January 1848 changed the composition of the House of Assembly in favour of the opposition party, the moderate reformists led by Robert Baldwin and Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine. The new governor, Lord Elgin, who arrived in the colony on January 30, first formed a government that did not have the support of the majority of the members in the House. These withdrew their support of the Executive by a vote of no-confidence on March 3. On March 7, governor Elgin called in Baldwin and Lafontaine, respectively leaders of the majority parties in both sections of the united province, to the Executive Council. On March 11, 11 new ministers entered the Council.

On January 29, 1849, Lafontaine moved to form a committee of the whole House on February 9 to &quot;take into consideration the necessity of establishing the amount of Losses incurred by certain inhabitants in Lower Canada during the political troubles of 1837 and 1838, and of providing for the payment thereof&quot;. The consideration of this motion was pushed ahead on several occasions. The opposition party, which denounced the desire of the government to &quot;pay the rebels&quot;, showed itself reluctant to begin the study of the question which was on hold since 1838. Its members proposed various amendments to Lafontaine&#x27;s motion: a first, on February 13, to report the vote within ten days &quot;to give time for the expression of the feelings of the country&quot;; a second one, on February 20, declaring that the House had &quot;no authority to entertain any such proposition&quot; since the Governor-General had not recommended that the House &quot;make provision for liquidating the claims for Losses incurred by the Rebellions in Lower Canada, during the present session&quot;. The amendments were rejected and the committee was eventually formed on Tuesday, February 20, but the House was adjourned.

The debates that took place between February 13 and 20 were particularly intense and, in the House, the verbal violence of the representatives soon yielded to physical violence. Tory MPPs Henry Sherwood, Allan MacNab and Prince attacked the legitimacy of the proposed measure because according to them it rewarded the &quot;rebels&quot; of yesterday and constituted an insult to the &quot;loyal&quot; subjects who had fought against them in 1837 and 1838. On February 15, executive councillors Francis Hincks and William Hume Blake retorted in the same tone and Blake even went as far as claiming the Tories to be the true rebels, because, he said, it was they who had violated the principles of the British constitution and caused the civil war of 1837–38. Blake refused to apologize after his speech, and a mêlée burst out among the spectators standing on the galleries. The speaker of the House had them expelled and a confrontation between MacNab and Blake was avoided by the intervention of the Sergeant at Arms.

On February 16, John A. Macdonald, opposition MPP for the riding of Kingston, provoked William Hume Blake to a duel. While Blake was reading excerpts from a document, Macdonald interrupted him to request that he read the phrases and paragraphs in full. Blake replied that he would read whatever he wanted to read. Macdonald did not appreciate the reply and passed a written note to Blake which provoked him to a duel. The two men left the room to go outside. Soon after, the Speaker suspended the sitting and sent the sergeant at arms to bring them back to their duty. Macdonald came back while Blake could not be found. He was asked to appear before the bar of the House on Monday, February 19 to give explanations for his departure. The House accepted his explanation. The two men assured the members of the House that the duel had been cancelled.

The English-language press of the capital (&quot;The Gazette&quot;, &quot;Courier&quot;, &quot;Herald&quot;, &quot;Transcript&quot;, &quot;Witness&quot;, &quot;Punch&quot;) participated in the movement of opposition to the indemnification measure. A single daily, the &quot;Pilot&quot;, owned by cabinet member Francis Hinks, supported the government. In the French-language press (&quot;La Minerve&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Avenir&quot;), the measure was unanimously supported.

On February 17, the leading Tory MPPs held a public meeting to protest against the measure. George Moffatt was elected chairman and various public men such as Allan MacNab, Prince, Gugy, Macdonald, Rose and others gave speeches. The meeting prepared a petition to the governor asking him to dissolve the parliament and call new elections, or to reserve the assent of the bill for the Queen&#x27;s pleasure, that is to say, to defer the question to the UK Parliament. The press reported that Lafontaine was burned in effigy that night.

On February 22, Henry John Boulton, MPP for Norfolk, introduced an amendment that all persons having pleaded guilty or having been found to be guilty of high treason should not receive compensation from the government. The government party supported the amendment, but the gesture had no effect on the opposition, which persisted in denouncing the measure as amounting to &quot;paying the rebels&quot;. Certain liberal MPPs, including Louis-Joseph Papineau and Pierre-Joseph-Olivier Chauveau, opposed the amendment because, according to them, it resulted in the recognition, by the government, of the legality of the military court created by former acting governor John Colborne in order to speedily execute the prisoners of 1839.
On February 23, Lafontaine presented a series of seven resolutions which included the introduction of a bill to indemnify inhabitants for their losses during the armed conflict of 1837-1838. The bill, entitled &quot;Bill to provide for the Indemnification of Parties in Lower Canada whose Property was destroyed during the Rebellion in the years 1837 and 1838&quot;, authorized total payments of £90,000.

The seven resolutions were adopted individually on February 27, and the bill was introduced the same day, then read a second time on March 2.

On March 9, the Legislative Assembly passed the bill by a vote of 47 to 18. MPPs from the former district of Upper Canada voted in favour, 17 to 14, while those of the former Lower Canada voted 30 to 4 in favour. Six days later, the Legislative Council approved the bill 20 to 14.

== Burning of the Parliament Building ==
Once the bill was passed by both houses of the Parliament, the Lafontaine–Baldwin ministry submitted it to Lord Elgin for assent. Some outraged English-Canadians demanded the governor refuse assent. Lord Elgin had his own misgivings about the bill, making many Tory supporters confident that the governor would reject the bill. Elgin nonetheless gave royal assent to the bill on April 25, 1849.

Montreal&#x27;s English population was incensed. Elgin&#x27;s carriage was pelted with stones and rotten eggs, and by the evening a riot had developed which lasted for two days and involved thousands of people. By the time the rioting had ended, mobs had caused thousands of dollars in damage and razed the Montreal Parliament building. Despite the violent opposition, Lord Elgin&#x27;s grant of assent established the principle of responsible government in the Province of Canada.

Houston was born in Monroe, North Carolina, on February 17, 1866. He was the son of William Henry Houston, a horse dealer and grocer, and his wife, the former Pamela Ann Stevens. He graduated from the University of South Carolina in 1887, with honors, and completed his graduate work at Harvard University, where he received a M.A. in political science in 1892. Houston married Helen Beall on December 11, 1895. They had five children: David Franklin, Jr., Duval, Elizabeth, Helen and Lawrence R. Houston.

==Higher education==
Houston taught political science at the University of Texas in Austin. He became an adjunct member of the faculty in 1894 and was named dean of the faculty in 1899. He then became the president of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now Texas A&amp;M University) from 1902 until 1905. In 1905 he returned to the University of Texas to become the president of the institution, serving until 1908. During his tenure at UT, the school opened a doctoral program and a law school.

Houston left Texas to serve as chancellor of Washington University in St. Louis, after being recommended by Charles W. Eliot, the president of Harvard University. He held the position from 1908 to 1913. During his tenure he established the School of Architecture and strengthened the medical school through partnerships with Children&#x27;s and Barnes hospitals. He left the university to become the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture.

Under President William McKinley he was on the board of visitors of the United States Military Academy at West Point. Later in life, he was an overseer of Harvard University and on the Columbia University Board of Trustees.

==Politics and ready for Wilson&#x27;s administration==
Houston served as President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s Secretary of Agriculture from 1913 to 1920. During his time as Agriculture Secretary many important agricultural laws were passed by the U.S. Congress, including the Smith-Lever Act, the Farm Loan Act, the Warehouse Act, and the Federal Aid Road Act. However following the Food and Fuel Control Act responsibility for food was handed over to Herbert Hoover at the United States Food Administration. Hoover only accepted the position on the basis he would be free from interference from Houston.
He became the Secretary of the Treasury from 1920 to 1921 shortly following the First World War. His brief tenure was marked by stormy controversies over federal monetary policies. As &quot;ex officio&quot; Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, he issued severe warnings and, increased rediscount rates in order to prevent the inflation that the European allies were experiencing. Houston predicted a fall in U.S. prices, particularly of farm products, after the optimism of the Armistice wore off. He pushed for easier credit for farmers and urged them to produce less.

But when prices fell more dramatically than expected in 1920, farm spokesmen unfairly accused Houston of deliberately wrecking agrarian prosperity. Abroad, England and France were pushing to cancel their war debts. Houston, the U.S. Congress and the President, against cancellation, converted the short-term debts to long-term loans. Houston resigned at the end of President Wilson&#x27;s term, after only a year in office.

During his time in government Houston advocated other progressive measures such as the provision of a proper system of personal credit unions, aiding land settlement, the encouragement of farm ownership, and improvements in rural health and sanitation. In regards to the latter, Houston stated that “To what extent the further projection of effort is a matter for state or local action remains to be determined, but it seems clear that there should be no cessation of activity until there has been completed, in every community of the Union, an effective sanitary survey and, through the provision of adequate machinery, steps taken to control and eliminate the sources of disease and to provide the necessary modern medical and dental facilities easily accessible to the mass of the people.” Houston also argued that &quot;The farmer, as well as the industrial worker, is entitled to a living wage and to a reasonable profit on his investment.&quot; He also argued that &quot;We are all in sympathy with rational proposals for the improvement of the masses of the less fortunate people of the Nation and of the world, but this improvement must come by orderly processes. And we must recognize that, after all, the real progress of humanity is slow.&quot;

==Business==
After leaving the U.S. federal government, Houston became as the president of the Bell Telephone Securities and a vice president at AT&amp;T. Houston also served as a director of AT&amp;T, the Guaranty Trust Company and the United States Steel Corporation. He was president of the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York for ten years.

==Death==
Houston died of a heart attack on September 2, 1940, at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City. He was buried next to his wife at Saint John&#x27;s Church Cemetery in Laurel Hollow, New York.
==Writings==
Houston published &quot;A Critical Study of Nullification in South Carolina&quot; (1896) to establish his place in academia. He later published a two-volume memoir of his experiences as a cabinet member, &quot;Eight Years with Wilson&#x27;s Cabinet&quot;.

<text>Baron Marie-Charles-Théodore de Damoiseau de Montfort (6 April 1768 in Besançon – 6 August 1846) was a French astronomer.

Damoiseau was originally an artillery officer but he left France in 1792 during the French Revolution. He worked as assistant director of the Lisbon Observatory before he returned to France in 1807.

In 1825, he was elected a member of the French Academy of Sciences. He was a member of the Bureau des Longitudes.

He is best known for publishing lunar tables (positions of the Moon) between 1824–1828.

==Scientific work==

===Theory of the Moon===

In 1818 Laplace proposed that the Académie des Sciences in Paris set up a prize to be awarded to whoever succeeded in constructing lunar tables based solely on the law of universal gravity. In 1820 the prize was awarded to Carlini and Plana and to Damoiseau by a committee of which Laplace was a member.

<text>Charles Julius Mickle (July 22, 1849 in Stratford, Canada West, now Ontario – November 10, 1919 in Minnedosa, Manitoba) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He was a provincial cabinet minister for three years and on two occasions served as the leader of the Liberal Party in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba.

Mickle trained as a lawyer and was admitted to the Ontario bar in 1872. He practiced law in Ontario for ten years before moving to Manitoba. He was first elected to the Manitoba legislature for the constituency of Birtle in the 1888 provincial election, as a supporter of Liberal Premier Thomas Greenway. He was re-elected in the 1892 campaign and won by acclamation in 1896.

In 1889, he married Mary A. Ross.

In November 1896, Mickle entered Greenway&#x27;s cabinet as Provincial Secretary. He held this position until the resignation of the Greenway ministry in January 1900. The Liberals had narrowly lost the election of 1899, although Mickle was re-elected in Birtle.

Mickle was also one of only nine Liberals to be re-elected in the party&#x27;s electoral debacle of 1903. The party won only nine seats, but Mickle scored a surprisingly easy victory (584 votes to 293) over Conservative John Leich. When Greenway re-entered federal politics in 1904, Mickle was chosen to replace him as parliamentary leader.

Mickle served as the de facto party leader until March 28, 1906, when a provincial Liberal convention acclaimed Edward Brown for the position. Brown was unable to win a seat in the election which followed, and Mickle was again chosen as parliamentary leader in January 1908.

He left politics in 1909, having been appointed a County Court Judge.

<text>Ultra Bra (&quot;ultra good&quot; in Swedish) was a Finnish band, formed in 1994 by Olli Virtaperko and Kerkko Koskinen and disbanded in 2001. The band will make a comeback in 2025 with two concerts at the Helsinki Olympic Stadium.

==Band history==
In 1994, Olli Virtaperko heard about a political song contest held by the Finnish Democratic Youth League, the youth organisation of the Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League. He entered the contest with his friend Kerkko Koskinen, who composed several songs based on lyrics from his friends and assembled a group of singers and musicians. The new band won the contest with their song &quot;Ampukaa komissaarit, nuo hullut koirat&quot; (&quot;Shoot the comissaries, those mad dogs&quot;).

Ultra Bra&#x27;s first EP, &quot;Houkutusten kiihottava maku&quot; (&quot;The Exhilarating Taste of Temptation&quot;) was published in the summer of 1995. The band&#x27;s name was invented during the recording sessions, and a steady lineup was settled on towards the end of 1995. By the end of the year Anni Sinnemäki, Koskinen&#x27;s wife, later the most celebrated of UB&#x27;s lyricists and a Green Party politician, began writing lyrics, starting with &quot;Sankaritar&quot; (&quot;Heroine&quot;) and &quot;Ken Saro-Wiwa on kuollut&quot; (&quot;Ken Saro-Wiwa is dead&quot;).

The band toured throughout 1996 and published their first full-length album, &quot;Vapaaherran elämää&quot; (&quot;Lordly Life&quot;), in the autumn of 1996. The band gained national fame with publication of the second album: &quot;Kroketti&quot; (&quot;Croquet&quot;, 1997) remains the band&#x27;s best selling album and contains some of their biggest hits, namely &quot;Sinä lähdit pois&quot; (&quot;You Went Away&quot;) and &quot;Minä suojelen sinua kaikelta&quot; (&quot;I Shall Protect You From Everything&quot;).

In 1998, the band partook in a contest to represent Finland in the Eurovision Song Contest. While Ultra Bra did not win, their entry, &quot;Tyttöjen välisestä ystävyydestä&quot; (&quot;About Friendship Between Girls&quot;), became a hit. The third album, &quot;Kalifornia&quot;, was released in the spring of 1999. In early 2000, Ultra Bra again participated in the Finnish Eurovision song selection process, with &quot;Kaikki on hetken tässä&quot; (&quot;In This Moment, Everything&#x27;s here&quot;), not reaching the final round. In the spring, the band released several new singles, of which the song &quot;Heikko valo&quot; (&quot;The Weak Light&quot;) also featured in the Finnish movie &quot;Restless&quot;.

By summer 2000, Ultra Bra had decided to disband in the near future. The band&#x27;s fourth and final album, &quot;Vesireittejä&quot; (&quot;Waterways&quot;), was published on 13 October 2000. It went number one – and sold gold – on its first week in the Finnish charts. In October 2001, a compilation album, &quot;Sinä päivänä kun synnyin&quot; (&quot;The Day I Was Born&quot;) was published. It consisted of one CD of previous hits and another of new songs and many rarities, along with a music video tape and a book. The band held a small tour of seven gigs, quitting on 20 October 2001, with maximum media coverage, surrounded by thousands of fans.

==Comebacks==
Ultra Bra made a comeback on 30 January 2012 at &quot;Kokoaan suurempi Suomi 2012&quot;, a fundraiser concert for Pekka Haavisto&#x27;s presidential campaign. Tickets to the concert sold out in two hours on 25 January and the rush crashed the online ticket service Tiketti.

The band toured again in the summer of 2017 and performed another set of three concerts at the Hartwall Arena in Helsinki from 15 to 17 December 2017. The 2017 comeback also included a new compilation album, &quot;Sinä päivänä kun synnyimme&quot; (&quot;The Day We Were Born&quot;), and limited-edition releases of their studio albums on coloured vinyl.

<doc id="848618" wikidata="Q1165472" url="?curid=848618" title="Rylands Library Papyrus P52">
<text>The Rylands Library Papyrus P52, also known as the St John&#x27;s fragment and with an accession reference of Papyrus Rylands Greek 457, is a fragment from a papyrus codex, measuring only at its widest (about the size of a credit card), and conserved with the Rylands Papyri at the John Rylands University Library Manchester, UK. The front (recto) contains parts of seven lines from the Gospel of John 18:31–33, in Greek, and the back (verso) contains parts of seven lines from verses 37–38. Since 2007, the papyrus has been on permanent display in the library&#x27;s Deansgate building.

Although Rylands 𝔓 is generally accepted as the earliest extant record of a canonical New Testament text, the dating of the papyrus is by no means the subject of consensus among scholars. The original editor proposed a date range of 100–150 CE, while a recent exercise by Pasquale Orsini and Willy Clarysse, aiming to generate consistent revised date estimates for all New Testament papyri written before the mid-4th century, has proposed a date for 𝔓 of 125–175 CE. A few scholars say that considering the difficulty of fixing the date of a fragment based solely on paleographic evidence allows the possibility of dates outside these range estimates, such that &quot;any serious consideration of the window of possible dates for P52 must include dates in the later second and early third centuries.&quot;

The fragment of papyrus was among a group acquired on the Egyptian market in 1920 by Bernard Grenfell, who chose several fragments for the Rylands Library and began work on preparing them for publication before becoming too ill to complete the task. Colin H. Roberts later continued this work and published the first transcription and translation of the fragment in 1935. Roberts found comparator hands in dated papyrus documents between the late 1st and mid 2nd centuries, with the largest concentration of Hadrianic date (117 CE to 138 CE). Since this gospel text would be unlikely to have reached Egypt before , he proposed a date in the first half of the 2nd century. Roberts proposed the closest match to 𝔓 as being an undated papyrus of the &quot;Iliad&quot; conserved in Berlin; and in the 70 years since Roberts&#x27;s essay the estimated date of this primary comparator hand has been confirmed as being around 100 CE, but other dated comparator hands have also since been suggested, with dates ranging into the second half of the 2nd century, and even into the 3rd century.

==Greek text==
The papyrus is written on both sides and hence must be from a codex, a sewn and folded book, not a scroll, roll or isolated sheet; and the surviving portion also includes part of the top and inner margins of the page. The recto consequently preserves the top left corner of a right-hand page; while the verso preserves the top right corner of a left-hand page. The characters in bold style are the ones that can be seen in Papyrus 𝔓. The recto text comes from the Gospel of John 18:31–33:

Eleven lines of the text are lost, containing 18:34–36. The text translates as:

The verso text comes from the Gospel of John, 18:37–38:

The text translates as:

There appears insufficient room for the repeated phrase () in the second line of the verso, and it is suggested that these words were inadvertently dropped through haplography.

The writing is generously scaled – letter forms vary between in height, lines are spaced approximately apart, and there is a margin of at the top. It can be determined that there were 18 lines to a page. C. H. Roberts commented: &quot;... to judge from the spacing and the size of the text, it is unlikely that the format was affected by considerations of economy&quot;. There are no apparent punctuation marks or breathings shown in the fragment; but the diaeresis is applied to an initial iota at both the second line of the recto and the second line of the verso; and possibly too on the first line of the recto. Taken together with the over-scaled writing, this suggests that the manuscript may have been intended for congregational reading. If the original codex did indeed contain the entire text of the canonical Gospel of John, it would have constituted a single quire book of around 130 pages (i.e. 33 large folded papyrus sheets written on both sides); measuring approximately when closed. Roberts noted a glued vertical join in the papyrus slightly inside the inner margin and visible on the verso, indicating that the large sheets used for the codex were likely to have been specially prepared for the purpose, each having been constructed from two standard sized sheets measuring approximately , with a central narrower sheet approximately constituting the spine. Roberts describes the handwriting as &quot;heavy, rounded and rather elaborate&quot;, but nevertheless not the work of &quot;a practised scribe&quot; (i.e. not a professional bookhand). Roberts notes comments that had recently been made by the editors of the Egerton Gospel (P.Egerton 2); and says similarly it could be said of 𝔓 that it &quot;has a somewhat informal air about it and with no claims to fine writing is yet a careful piece of work&quot;.

In total, 114 legible letters are visible on the two sides of the fragment, representing 18 out of the 24 letters of the Greek alphabet; beta, zeta, xi, phi, chi, and psi being missing. Roberts noted that the writing is painstaking and rather laboured, with instances of individual letters formed using several strokes &quot;with a rather clumsy effect&quot; (e.g. the lunate sigma () at line three of the recto, and the eta () immediately following it). Several letters are inclined to stray away from the notional upper and lower writing lines. Another peculiarity is that there are two distinct forms of the letter alpha (); most are formed from a separate loop and diagonal stroke, where the top of the stroke has a distinctive decorative arch while the bottom is hooked; but on the fourth line of the verso there is a smaller alpha formed by a single spiralling loop with no arch or hooks. Also present in two forms is the letter upsilon (); the more common form is constructed from two strokes, each stroke terminating in a decorative hook or finial (see the second line of the recto); but on the fourth line of the verso is an upsilon formed from a single looped stroke with no decoration. These observations support Roberts&#x27;s supposition that the scribe was an educated person writing carefully in imitation of a calligraphic hand, rather than a professional scribe writing to order; such that, on occasion, the writer inadvertently reverted to the undecorated (and often smaller) letter forms of his everyday hand.

Roberts noted that in addition to alpha and upsilon, other letters also tend to be given decorative hooks, especially iota () and omega () (both seen in the seventh line of the recto). He also drew attention to the forms of epsilon () (with an extended cross-stroke a little above the centre-line, as in the fourth line of the verso), delta () (with a decorative arch, as in the first and second lines of the recto) and mu () (with a central stroke dipping down to the baseline, as in the third line of the recto). Nongbri confirms Roberts observations, and also notes distinctive forms of rho () (with a small head and an undecorated downstroke extending well below the lower line, as in the second line of the verso), pi () (with an extended horizontal stroke, as in the third line of the recto) and kappa () (formed like the looped upsilon with an additional downwards stroke, as in the fourth line of the recto). Aside from their sometimes clumsy construction, the sigma and eta are also distinctive in form; the sigma facing fully to the right, and the eta having a distinctive high cross stroke.

In 1977, Roberts surveyed 14 papyri believed to be of Christian origin – 12 codices and two scrolls – comprising all the Christian manuscripts then commonly assessed as likely having a 2nd century date, including 𝔓. He considered that only three of these texts had a calligraphic bookhand, such as was then standard in formal manuscripts of Greek literature, or in most Graeco-Jewish biblical scrolls. Of the other eleven, including 𝔓, he states that their scribes were:

It may be added that the codex of 𝔓, with its good quality papyrus, wide margins, large clear even upright letters, short lines in continuous script, decorative hooks and finials, and bilinear writing, would have presented an overall appearance not far from that of professionally written Christian codices such as 𝔓 or 𝔓, even though its actual letter forms are not as fine, and are closer to documentary exemplars.

== Date ==
The significance of 𝔓 rests both upon its proposed early dating and upon its geographic dispersal from the presumed site of authorship, traditionally thought to have been Ephesus. As the fragment is removed from the autograph by at least one step of transmission, the date of authorship for the Gospel of John must be at least a few years prior to the writing of 𝔓, whenever that may have been. The location of the fragment in Egypt extends that time even further, allowing for the dispersal of the documents from the point of authorship and transmission to the point of discovery. The Gospel of John is perhaps quoted by Justin Martyr, and hence is highly likely to have been written before c. 160 CE; but 20th century New Testament scholars, most influentially Kurt Aland and Bruce Metzger, have argued from the proposed dating of 𝔓 prior to this, that the latest possible date for the composition of the Gospel should be pushed back into the early decades of the second century; some scholars indeed arguing that the discovery of 𝔓 implies a date of composition for the Gospel no later than the traditionally accepted date of c. 90 CE, or even earlier.

Scepticism about the use of 𝔓 to date the Gospel of John (not about the fragment&#x27;s authenticity) is based on two issues. First, the papyrus has been dated based on the handwriting alone, without the support of dated textual references or associated archeology. Secondly, like all other surviving early Gospel manuscripts, this fragment is from a codex, not a scroll. If it dates from the first half of the second century, this fragment would be amongst the earlier surviving examples of a literary codex. (Around 90 CE, Martial circulated his poems in parchment codex form, presenting this as a novelty.) The year before Roberts published 𝔓, the British Museum library had acquired papyrus fragments of the Egerton Gospel (P.Egerton 2) which are also from a codex, and these were published in 1935 by H. Idris Bell and T.C. Skeat. Since the text of 𝔓 is that of a canonical gospel, the Gospel of John, whereas that of the Egerton Gospel is not, there was considerable interest amongst biblical scholars as to whether 𝔓 could be dated as the earlier of the two papyri.

=== Colin Roberts ===

𝔓 is a literary text and, in common with almost all such papyri, has no explicit indicator of date. Proposing a date for it ultimately required comparison with dated texts, which tend to be in documentary hands (contracts, petitions, letters). Nevertheless, Roberts suggested two undated literary papyri as the closest comparators to 𝔓: P. Berol. 6845 (a fragment of an Iliad scroll conserved in Berlin and dated paleographically to around the end of the first century) which he suggested (other than in the form of the letter alpha) is &quot;the closest parallel to our text that I have been able to find, a view that I was glad to find shared by so great an authority as Sir Frederic Kenyon&quot;; and P.Egerton 2 itself, which was then estimated to date around 150 CE. Roberts stated that in the Egerton Gospel, &quot;most of the characteristics of our hand are to be found, though in a less accentuated form&quot;; and he particularly noted similar forms of upsilon, mu and delta.

Establishing the Berlin Iliad P. Berol 6845 as a comparator was key to Roberts proposing an early 2nd century date as plausible for 𝔓; as the Berlin papyrus had been dated to the end of the first century by Wilhelm Schubart, in a landmark papyrological study which demonstrated the close similarity of its hand to that of P. Fayum 110, a personal letter, but written by a professional scribe in a &quot;literary type&quot; hand and with an explicit date of 94 CE. In proposing a date of around the middle of the second century for P. Egerton 2, Skeat and Bell had also relied on comparison with P.Fayum 110; together with Abb 34 (now known as B.G.U. 1.22 and dated ca. 110–117 CE), a letter in a documentary hand of the time of Trajan; and P.Lond. 1.130, a horoscope of late first or early second century date. The Berlin Iliad has since been re-edited in the light of more recent discoveries, but confirming Schubart&#x27;s conclusions as to its dating around 100 CE, and its close relationship to the dated literary type hand of P.Fayum 110; and it remains a primary exemplar of a particularly distinctive form of first/early second century CE calligraphic book hand. Roberts in turn was also to advance P. Fayum 110 and Abb 34 (though not P.Lond. 1.130) as dated comparators to 𝔓, identifying P. Fayum 110 as the &quot;most important parallel&quot; he could find among dated documents, and noting in particular that both of these showed the same two forms of alpha in simultaneous use. Nongbri notes other instances where the letter forms in P. Fayum 110 are a closer match to those in 𝔓 than are the counterpart forms in P. Berol 6845; specifically delta, pi, rho and epsilon. In his later career, Roberts reasserted the close resemblance of P. Fayum 110 to both 𝔓 and P. Egerton 2.

Roberts also proposed two further dated papyri in documentary hands as comparators for 𝔓: P. London 2078, a private letter written in the reign of Domitian (81–96 CE), and P. Oslo 22, a petition dated 127 CE; noting that P. Oslo 22 was most similar in some of the more distinctive letter forms, e.g. eta, mu and iota. Roberts circulated his assessment to Frederic G. Kenyon, Wilhelm Schubart and H. I. Bell; all concurred with his dating of 𝔓 in the first half of the 2nd century. Kenyon suggested another comparator in P. Flor 1. 1, a loan contract dated 153 CE; but Roberts did not consider the similarity to be very close, other than for particular letters, as the overall style of that hand was cursive. In the same year 1935, Roberts&#x27;s assessment of date was supported by the independent studies of A. Deissmann, who, while producing no actual evidence, suggested a date in the reigns of Hadrian (117–138) or even Trajan (98–117). In 1936 the dating was supported by Ulrich Wilcken on the basis of a comparison between the hand of 𝔓 and those of papyri in the extensive Apollonius archive which are dated 113–120.

=== Philip Comfort ===

Subsequently, other comparator literary papyri have been suggested, notably P. Oxy. XXXI 2533, where a literary text of the second century in a hand proposed as very close to 𝔓 is found written on the back of a re-used document in a late first century business hand; and also three biblical papyrus codices; P. Oxy. LX 4009 (an apocryphal gospel fragment, dated paleographically to the early/mid second century); and P. Oxy. L 3523 (𝔓) and P. Oxy. LXIV 4404 (𝔓) both dated paleographically to the later second century. In addition, the discovery of other papyrus codices with second century hands, such as the Yale Genesis Fragment (P. Yale 1), suggested that this form of book was more common for literary texts at this date than had previously been assumed. Consequently, until the 1990s, the tendency amongst New Testament commentators, supported by several paleographers such as Philip W. Comfort, had been to suggest a date for 𝔓 towards the earlier half of the range suggested by Roberts and his correspondents. However, a cautionary note was raised by the discovery that a papyrus fragment in Cologne constitutes part of the Egerton Gospel. In this fragment the letters gamma and kappa are separated by an hooked apostrophe, a feature infrequent in dated second century papyri; which accordingly has been taken as implying a date for the Egerton Gospel closer to 200 CE – and indicating the perils of ascribing a date for a papyrus text of which only a small part of two pages survives.

=== Brent Nongbri ===

The early date for 𝔓 favoured by many New Testament scholars has been challenged by Andreas Schmidt, who favours a date around 170 CE, plus or minus twenty-five years; on the basis of a comparison with Chester Beatty Papyri X and III, and with the redated Egerton Gospel. Brent Nongbri has criticized both Comfort&#x27;s early dating of 𝔓 and Schmidt&#x27;s late dating, dismissing as unsound all attempts to establish a date for such undated papyri within narrow ranges on purely paleographic grounds, along with any inference from the paleographic dating of 𝔓 to a precise &quot;terminus ad quem&quot; for the composition of the Fourth Gospel. In particular Nongbri noted that both Comfort and Schmidt propose their respective revisions of Roberts&#x27;s dating solely on the basis of paleographic comparisons with papyri that had themselves been paleographically dated. As a corrective to both tendencies, Nongbri collected and published images of all explicitly dated comparator manuscripts to 𝔓; demonstrating that, although Roberts&#x27;s assessment of similarities with a succession of dated late first to mid second century papyri could be confirmed, two later dated papyri, both petitions, also showed strong similarities (P. Mich. inv. 5336, dated around 152 CE; and P.Amh. 2.78, an example first suggested by Eric Turner, that dates to 184 CE). Nongbri states &quot;The affinities in letter forms between (P. Mich. inv. 5336) and 𝔓 are as close as any of Roberts&#x27;s documentary parallels&quot;, and that P.Amh. 2.78 &quot;is as good a parallel to 𝔓 as any of these adduced by Roberts&quot;. Nongbri also produces dated documents of the later second and early third centuries, each of which display similarities to 𝔓 in some of their letter forms. Nongbri suggests that this implied that older styles of handwriting might persist much longer than some scholars had assumed, and that a prudent margin of error must allow a still wider range of possible dates for the papyrus:

Nongbri resists offering his own opinion on the date of 𝔓, but apparently approves the relatively cautious terminology both of Roberts&#x27;s dating, &quot;On the whole, we may accept with some confidence the first half of the second century as the period in which (𝔓) was most probably written&quot;; and also of Roberts&#x27;s speculations on possible implications for the date of John&#x27;s gospel, &quot;But all we can safely say is that this fragment tends to support those critics who favour an early date (late first to early second century) for the composition of the Gospel rather than those who would still regard it as a work of the middle decades of the second century&quot;. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding Nongbri&#x27;s statement to the contrary, some commentators have interpreted his accumulation of later dated comparators as undermining Roberts&#x27;s proposed dating; but such interpretations fail to take into account the essential similarity of Roberts&#x27;s and Nongbri&#x27;s main findings. Roberts identified the closest parallels to 𝔓 as being P. Berol 6845 and P. Egerton 2, then dated paleographically to 100 CE and 150 CE respectively; and proposed that the most probable date for 𝔓 would lie in between these two. Nongbri rejects paleographically dated comparators on principle, and consequently proposes the closest dated parallels to 𝔓 as being P. Fayum 110 of 94 CE, P.Mich. inv. 5336 of ca. 152 CE and P.Amh. 2.78 of 184 CE; each, he suggests, as close to 𝔓 as the others, and all three closer than any other dated comparator. The consequence is to extend the range of dated primary reference comparators both earlier and later than in Roberts work; and Nongbri stresses that, simply from paleographic evidence, the actual date of 𝔓 could conceivably be later (or earlier) still. Although Nongbri is concerned to demonstrate that the possibility of a late second (or early third) century date for 𝔓 cannot be discounted, his chief criticism is directed at those subsequent commentators and scholars who have tended to take the midpoint of Roberts&#x27;s proposed range of dates, treat it as the latest limit for a possible date for this papyrus, and then infer from this that the Gospel of John cannot have been written later than around 100 CE.

=== Stanley Porter ===

The relationship of 𝔓 to P.Egerton 2 has been further re-examined in detail by Stanley E. Porter. Porter offers two further comparator early biblical papyri for both texts, P. Oxy IV 656 (a fragment of Genesis) and P.Vindob. G. 2325 (another apocryphal gospel, the Fayum Fragment); and provides a wide-ranging survey of the history and range of opinion amongst papyrologists for the dating of 𝔓 and P.Egerton 2, presenting arguments to support Robert&#x27;s judgement that the two are close parallels, that they are unlikely to be of widely separate dates, and that 𝔓 is more likely the earlier. Specifically he notes that P.Egerton 2 is in &quot;a less heavy hand with more formal rounded characteristics, but with what the original editors called &quot;cursive affinities&quot;.&quot; Porter adds that &quot;Both manuscripts were apparently written before the development of a more formal Biblical majuscule style, which began to develop in the late second and early third centuries.&quot; In this respect, Porter also notes that although the hooked apostrophe form found in the Cologne fragment of P.Egerton 2 is unusual in the second century, there is at least one known dated example in a papyrus of 101 CE and three others of mid or late second century date. &quot;The result is to bring the two manuscripts together, somewhere in the middle of the second century, perhaps tending towards the early part of it.&quot;

Stanley Porter has also questioned Nongbri&#x27;s assertion that valid comparisons can be made between 𝔓 and documentary papyri of the later second and early third centuries; noting the warning from Eric Turner that, &quot;Comparison of book hands with dated documentary hands will be less reliable, the intention of the scribe is different in the two cases.&quot; and in respect of this Porter cautions against what he terms Nongbri&#x27;s &#x27;overly skeptical&#x27; insistence on disregarding comparators without an explicit date, forcing comparators for literary texts inappropriately to be confined to purely documentary hands. Porter suggests that Nongbri&#x27;s proposed late second and third century comparators are in several cases quite different from 𝔓 so that they force comparison to focus on detailed letter forms without consideration of the overall formation, trajectory and style of the script. If, rather than undertaking comparisons document by document, typological letter comparisons are instead applied using published series of dated representative script alphabets, then, Porter asserts, both 𝔓 and P.Egerton 2 &quot;fit comfortably within the second century. There are of course some letters that are similar to those in the third century (as there are some in the first century) but the letters that tend to be given the most individualization, such as alpha, mu and even sigma, appear to be second century.&quot; Both Porter and Nongbri note that Eric Turner, notwithstanding his proposal of P.Amh. 2.78 as a parallel for 𝔓, nevertheless continued to maintain that &quot;The Rylands papyrus may therefore be accepted as of the first half of the second century&quot;. Nongbri has subsequently pointed out the limited usefulness of Porter&#x27;s study due to the fact that it makes no reference to manuscripts with secure dates and thus is entirely circular (several undated manuscripts are used to provide a date for another undated manuscript).

=== Don Barker ===

An altogether different approach to dating New Testament papyri has been proposed by a number of paleographers in recent years, drawing on the notion of &quot;graphic stream&quot; developed by Guglielmo Cavallo. Rather than comparing letter forms of undated papyri directly with dated comparators, it is proposed that the hand in question should first be identified to a graphic stream representing the overall development of a particular handwriting style. &quot;The way that individual letters are formed within these graphic streams is secondary to the overall style of the script&quot;. Don Barker, reviewing the proposed comparators and range of datings that have been advanced over the years for 𝔓, maintains that this papyrus can be placed in a &quot;round block script&quot; graphic stream that is attested from the first century onwards; and notes eleven dated examples ranging from P.Oxy. 3466 (81–96 CE) to P.Oxy.3183 (292 CE) and including all the later parallels proposed by Nongbri and Turner as well as P.Fayum 110 (94 CE) from Roberts&#x27;s original study. Otherwise, however, Barker rejects from this graphic stream all the other comparators proposed by Roberts and his correspondents, including P. Flor 1. 1 (153 CE). Barker maintains that the letter formation within this the graphic stream &quot;appears to have great holding power&quot;, and proposes that it is consequently difficult to place 𝔓 into a narrower time frame within it. &quot; When the general style and individual letter features are kept in close connection and keeping in mind how a scribe writing a documentary text may write a literary text differently, it would seem from the above dated manuscripts, that a date of the second or third century could be assigned to P.Ryl. 457&quot;.&quot;

=== Pasquale Orsini and Willy Clarysse ===

Pasquale Orsini and Willy Clarysse also adopt the &quot;graphic stream&quot; approach; and have applied it to reviewing the dating for all New Testament manuscripts proposed as having been written before the mid-fourth century, including 𝔓. Since none of these papyri and parchments carry explicit dates, all must be dated paleographically; so Orsini and Clarysse propose that manuscript comparisons for such paleographic dating should be made only between hands that are similar to one another. However, and in contrast to Don Barker, their classification of hands conforms rigorously to the typology of Hellenistic Greek handwriting styles developed by Guglielmo Cavallo; applying his categorisation of hands into &#x27;styles&#x27;, &#x27;stylistic classes&#x27; or &#x27;graphic types&#x27; as appropriate. Orsini and Clarysse propose dates for New Testament papyri that are often rather later than the consensus dates in the Nestle-Aland lists, and considerably later than the counterpart dates proposed by Comfort and Barrett. They criticise Don Barker for assigning dates they regard as extending too early; the dating ranges they themselves propose for New Testament papyri are never wider than 100 years, more frequently 50 years, and for several early papyri (𝔓, 𝔓, 𝔓) they propose purely paleographic dates within a 25-year range. In their paper Orsini and Clarysse state that the early parallels proposed for 𝔓 by Comfort and Barrett are &quot;inappropriate&quot;; and, although they cite with approval Nongbri&#x27;s assessment of the respective papyrological dating approaches adopted by Grenfell, Hunt and Roberts, they do not cite his specific study of 𝔓, and none of his proposed later parallels feature in their list of stylistically similar comparators; nor do any of other papyri advanced by Barker as representatives of his proposed graphic stream. Of the papyri discussed by Roberts and his correspondents, and in contradiction to Barker, Orsini and Clarysse maintain Kenyon&#x27;s proposed dated parallel, P. Flor 1. 1 (153 CE) as corresponding to the same &quot;Round Chancery Script&quot; graphic type as 𝔓. Two further comparators they propose are PSI V 446, the official proclamation of an edict of the prefect Petronius dated 132–137 CE; and P. Fayum 87, a municipal receipt dated 156 CE; while they also note, as other commentators have done, the close similarity of 𝔓 to 𝔓 for which they propose a date of 100–200 CE. Consequently, Orsini and Clarysse propose 125 to 175 CE as the range of dates for 𝔓; which corresponds with the &quot;mid second century&quot; date proposed Stanley Porter, is much narrower than the ranges envisaged by Barker or Nongbri, and implies within their dating schema that 𝔓 and 𝔓 stand as the earliest New Testament papyri so far identified (although, strangely, at the conclusion of their article, Orsini and Clarysse state that 𝔓, 𝔓, and 𝔓 &quot;probably all [date to] the second half of the second century).&quot;

=== John Rylands Library ===

The John Rylands Library states &quot;The first editor dated the Fragment to the first half of the second century (between 100–150 AD). The date was estimated palaeographically, by comparing the handwriting with other manuscripts. However, palaeography is not an exact science – none of the comparable Biblical manuscripts are dated and most papyri bearing a secure date are administrative documents. Recent research points to a date nearer to 200 AD, but there is as yet no convincing evidence that any earlier fragments from the New Testament survive. Carbon-dating is a destructive method and has not been used on the Fragment.&quot;

== Text-critical and historical significance ==

Finds of early Christian papyri from Egypt represent the earliest surviving indisputable physical evidence for Christianity and the Gospels. There is a considerable degree of overlap in the proposed ranges of dates for these papyri, and consequently it cannot be stated categorically that 𝔓 is earlier than other New Testament fragments of apparent 2nd century date, such as 𝔓, 𝔓 and 𝔓; it also cannot be stated categorically that it is earlier than some early apocryphal texts, such as P. Egerton. 2, P.Oxy. LX 4009. There are, in addition, a number of papyrus fragments of Old Testament books in Greek (chiefly Psalms) which have also been dated to the 2nd century, and whose characteristics have been advanced as indicating a Christian, rather than Jewish or pagan, origin. Nevertheless, since all of these papyri have been dated paleographically, and mostly with reference to the same dated documentary comparators, they may be considered as a manuscript cluster whose estimated dates will vary as a group, amongst which 𝔓 is commonly recognised as having earlier features. Moreover, despite the small quantity of text, the text that survives in 𝔓 is sufficient to provide early witness to a number of key historical claims about the Historical Jesus; though not mentioned by name, the verses in 𝔓 show a man tried before the Roman authorities at a specific date (the governorship of Pontius Pilate), at a specific place (the Praetorium in Jerusalem), sentenced to a specific death (crucifixion), and all at the instigation of the Jewish Temple authorities.

If the early 2nd century dating of the 𝔓 is in fact correct, then the fact that the fragment is from a codex rather than a scroll would testify to the very early adoption of this mode of writing amongst Christians, in stark contrast to the apparent practice of contemporary Judaism. Furthermore, an assessment of the length of &#x27;missing&#x27; text between the recto and verso readings corresponds with that in the counterpart canonical Gospel of John; and hence confirms that there are unlikely to have been substantial additions or deletions in this whole portion. Other than two iotacisms (), and in the probable omission of the second from line 2 of the verso, 𝔓 agrees with the Alexandrian text base. In lines 4 and 5 of the recto, the reconstructed text reads , in agreement with 𝔓 and with the , whereas the , and the Majority Text all have the alternative word order of ; however, this is not considered a significant variant. Since this fragment is small – about – it cannot be proven that it comes from a full copy of the Gospel of John, but it may be presumed that the original text was at least of near full gospel length, to be worth the extra care and time required in writing in codex form. On the other hand, the generous scale and format of the codex pages of 𝔓 are such that it is highly unlikely that it could originally have comprised the four canonical gospels; Roberts calculated that such a codex might have required 576 pages.

𝔓 is small, and although a plausible reconstruction can be attempted for most of the 14 lines represented, the proportion of the text of the Gospel of John for which it provides a direct witness is necessarily limited, so it is rarely cited in textual debate. There has, however, been some contention as to whether the name (Jesus) in the &#x27;missing&#x27; portions of recto lines 2 and 5 was originally written as ; in other words, was it contracted to or in accordance with otherwise universal Christian practice in surviving early Gospel manuscripts. On the assumption that the nomina sacra were absent from 𝔓, Roberts originally considered that the divine name was more likely to have been written in full, but later changed his mind. This latter view is also the view of Larry W. Hurtado, with Christopher M. Tuckett maintaining Roberts&#x27; original opinion. The verses included in 𝔓 are also witnessed in Bodmer Papyrus 𝔓 – usually dated to the beginning of the 3rd century CE – and there is also some overlap with 𝔓 and 𝔓 of the 7th and 2nd centuries respectively. No two of the four contain the same exact text as reconstructed for John 18:31–38, but 𝔓 seems to represent an example of the same proto-Alexandrian text-type. Kurt Aland described it as a &quot;Normal text&quot;, and placed it in Category I, due to its age.

<text>John Frederick Norman Lewis (28 June 1908 – 22 July 2003) was a British writer. While he is best known for his travel writing, he also wrote twelve novels and several volumes of autobiography.

Subjects he explored in his travel writing include life in Naples during the Allied liberation of Italy (&quot;Naples &#x27;44&quot;); Vietnam and French colonial Indochina (&quot;A Dragon Apparent&quot;); Indonesia (&quot;An Empire of the East&quot;); Burma (&quot;Golden Earth&quot;); tribal peoples of India (&quot;A Goddess in the Stones&quot;); Sicily and the Mafia (&quot;The Honoured Society&quot; and &quot;In Sicily&quot;); and the destruction caused by Christian missionaries in Latin America and elsewhere (&quot;The Missionaries&quot;).

His newspaper article entitled &quot;Genocide in Brazil&quot; (1969) prompted the creation of Survival International—an organisation dedicated to the protection of indigenous peoples around the world.

Graham Greene described Lewis as &quot;one of the best writers, not of any particular decade, but of our century&quot;.

==Early life==
Lewis came from a Welsh family and in later life identified – at least partially – as Welsh, but he was born at &quot;Clifton&quot; (which Lewis called a &quot;quiet, rather dismal little house&quot;), 343, Carterhatch Lane, Enfield, Middlesex, a suburb of London, to pharmacist Richard George Lewis (d. 1936) and his wife Louise Charlotte (née Evans; d. 1950). His parents became spiritualists after the deaths of Lewis&#x27;s elder brothers, and hoped young Lewis would grow up to become a medium. A clever child, Lewis was bullied by other children, and sent by his parents to live for a couple of years with three deeply religious &quot;half-mad aunts&quot; in Wales. Having been educated at Enfield Grammar School, as a young man, Lewis tried a variety of ways to make a living in the Great Depression of the 1930s, including self-employed wedding photographer, auctioneer, umbrella wholesaler and briefly a motorcycle racer at Harringay Stadium and White City. At this time of his life, he was a &quot;young rake and dandy&quot; with a &quot;love of fast cars and adventure&quot;. For some years during this period, he set up home in Woodberry Down near Manor House in London.

Lewis&#x27;s different books give varying accounts of his British Army service in World War II. In his autobiography, &quot;Jackdaw Cake&quot;, he says he served in the Intelligence Corps in Algiers, Tunisia and Naples in 1942-44; elsewhere says he was eventually commissioned as a second lieutenant and served with the 1st King&#x27;s Dragoon Guards, an armoured regiment in the Italian Campaign. His account of experiences during the Allied occupation of Italy, &quot;Naples &#x27;44&quot; (1978) was called by &quot;The Telegraph&quot; &quot;one of the great first-hand accounts of the Second World War.&quot; Shortly after the war he wrote books about Burma, &quot;Golden Earth&quot; (1952), and French Indochina, &quot;A Dragon Apparent&quot; (1951), which &quot;The Telegraph&quot; similarly praised as &quot; the finest record of Indo-China before the devastation wrought by the Vietnam War&quot;.

==Tribal societies==
Another major concern of Lewis&#x27;s was the impact of missionary activity on tribal societies in Latin America and elsewhere. He was hostile to the activities of missionaries, especially American evangelicals. This is covered in his book &quot;The Missionaries&quot;, and several shorter pieces. He frequently said that he regarded his life&#x27;s major achievement as the worldwide reaction to writing on tribal societies in South America. In 1968, his article &quot;Genocide in Brazil&quot;, published in the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; after a journey to Brazil with the war photographer Don McCullin, created such an outcry that it led to the creation of the organisation Survival International, dedicated to the protection of first peoples around the world. Lewis later said of this article that it was &quot;the most worthwhile of all my endeavours&quot;.

==Writing==

Lewis was fascinated by cultures which were little touched by the modern world. This was reflected in his books on travels in Indonesia, &quot;An Empire of the East&quot;, and among the tribal peoples of India, &quot;A Goddess in the Stones&quot;.

Lewis wrote several volumes of autobiography, again concerned primarily with his observations of the many places in which he lived at various times, including St Catherine&#x27;s Island in South Wales near Tenby, the Bloomsbury district of London during World War II, Nicaragua, a Spanish fishing village (&quot;Voices of the Old Sea&quot;), and a village near Rome.

Lewis also wrote twelve novels. Some of these enjoyed significant success at the time of publication, but his literary reputation rests mainly on his travel writing. 

===Testimony of war crimes in Lazio===

While Lewis was a British officer on the Monte Cassino front, he witnessed war crimes (Marocchinate) committed by French colonial troops during the Italian campaign:
==Family==

Lewis&#x27;s first wife, Ernestina Corvaja, was a Swiss-Sicilian. Sicilian life, including the role of the Mafia, was a major theme, which he explored in &quot;The Honoured Society&quot; (1964) and &quot;In Sicily&quot; (2000). While never losing sight of the horrors inflicted by the Mafia, his accounts were not sensationalist. They were based on a detailed understanding of Sicilian society, and a deep sympathy with the sufferings of the Sicilian people. The Latin connection encouraged him to travel, resulting in his first book, &quot;Spanish Adventure&quot; (1935). The marriage had however failed by the start of the Second World War in 1939. He was briefly married a second time, after the war.

He died in Saffron Walden, Essex, survived by his third wife, Lesley, and their son, Gawaine, and two daughters, Kiki and Samara; and by a son, Gareth, and daughter, Karen, from his second marriage with Hester; and by a son, Ito, from his first marriage. His son Gareth is also a published writer.

Lewis said that he believed in &quot;absolutely nothing&quot; and indeed &quot;I do not believe in belief.&quot; He did not believe that humanity was making progress. He talked about &quot;the intense joy I derive from being alive&quot;, and said he was &quot;exceedingly happy&quot;.

<doc id="848629" wikidata="Q356895" url="?curid=848629" title="Adiabatic theorem">
<text>The adiabatic theorem is a concept in quantum mechanics. Its original form, due to Max Born and Vladimir Fock (1928), was stated as follows:
:&quot;A physical system remains in its instantaneous eigenstate if a given perturbation is acting on it slowly enough and if there is a gap between the eigenvalue and the rest of the Hamiltonian&#x27;s spectrum.&quot;
In simpler terms, a quantum mechanical system subjected to gradually changing external conditions adapts its functional form, but when subjected to rapidly varying conditions there is insufficient time for the functional form to adapt, so the spatial probability density remains unchanged.

== Adiabatic pendulum ==

At the 1911 Solvay conference, Einstein gave a lecture on the quantum hypothesis, which states that formula_1 for atomic oscillators. After Einstein&#x27;s lecture, Hendrik Lorentz commented that, classically, if a simple pendulum is shortened by holding the wire between two fingers and sliding down, it seems that its energy will change smoothly as the pendulum is shortened. This seems to show that the quantum hypothesis is invalid for macroscopic systems, and if macroscopic systems do not follow the quantum hypothesis, then as the macroscopic system becomes microscopic, it seems the quantum hypothesis would be invalidated. Einstein replied that although both the energy formula_2 and the frequency formula_3 would change, their ratio formula_4 would still be conserved, thus saving the quantum hypothesis.

Before the conference, Einstein had just read a paper by Paul Ehrenfest on the adiabatic hypothesis. We know that he had read it because he mentioned it in a letter to Michele Besso written before the conference.

== Diabatic vs. adiabatic processes ==
At some initial time formula_5 a quantum-mechanical system has an energy given by the Hamiltonian formula_6; the system is in an eigenstate of formula_6 labelled formula_8. Changing conditions modify the Hamiltonian in a continuous manner, resulting in a final Hamiltonian formula_9 at some later time formula_10. The system will evolve according to the time-dependent Schrödinger equation, to reach a final state formula_11. The adiabatic theorem states that the modification to the system depends critically on the time formula_12 during which the modification takes place.

For a truly adiabatic process we require formula_13; in this case the final state formula_11 will be an eigenstate of the final Hamiltonian formula_15, with a modified configuration:

:formula_16

The degree to which a given change approximates an adiabatic process depends on both the energy separation between formula_8 and adjacent states, and the ratio of the interval formula_18 to the characteristic timescale of the evolution of formula_8 for a time-independent Hamiltonian, formula_20, where formula_21 is the energy of formula_8.

Conversely, in the limit formula_23 we have infinitely rapid, or diabatic passage; the configuration of the state remains unchanged:

:formula_24

The so-called &quot;gap condition&quot; included in Born and Fock&#x27;s original definition given above refers to a requirement that the spectrum of formula_25 is discrete and nondegenerate, such that there is no ambiguity in the ordering of the states (one can easily establish which eigenstate of formula_9 &quot;corresponds&quot; to formula_27). In 1999 J. E. Avron and A. Elgart reformulated the adiabatic theorem to adapt it to situations without a gap.

=== Comparison with the adiabatic concept in thermodynamics ===
The term &quot;adiabatic&quot; is traditionally used in thermodynamics to describe processes without the exchange of heat between system and environment (see adiabatic process), more precisely these processes are usually faster than the timescale of heat exchange. (For example, a pressure wave is adiabatic with respect to a heat wave, which is not adiabatic.) Adiabatic in the context of thermodynamics is often used as a synonym for fast process.

The classical and quantum mechanics definition is instead closer to the thermodynamical concept of a quasistatic process, which are processes that are almost always at equilibrium (i.e. that are slower than the internal energy exchange interactions time scales, namely a &quot;normal&quot; atmospheric heat wave is quasi-static, and a pressure wave is not). Adiabatic in the context of mechanics is often used as a synonym for slow process.

In the quantum world adiabatic means for example that the time scale of electrons and photon interactions is much faster or almost instantaneous with respect to the average time scale of electrons and photon propagation. Therefore, we can model the interactions as a piece of continuous propagation of electrons and photons (i.e. states at equilibrium) plus a quantum jump between states (i.e. instantaneous).

The adiabatic theorem in this heuristic context tells essentially that quantum jumps are preferably avoided, and the system tries to conserve the state and the quantum numbers.

The quantum mechanical concept of adiabatic is related to adiabatic invariant, it is often used in the old quantum theory and has no direct relation with heat exchange.

== Example systems ==

=== Simple pendulum ===
As an example, consider a pendulum oscillating in a vertical plane. If the support is moved, the mode of oscillation of the pendulum will change. If the support is moved &quot;sufficiently slowly&quot;, the motion of the pendulum relative to the support will remain unchanged. A gradual change in external conditions allows the system to adapt, such that it retains its initial character. The detailed classical example is available in the Adiabatic invariant page and here.

=== Quantum harmonic oscillator ===

The classical nature of a pendulum precludes a full description of the effects of the adiabatic theorem. As a further example consider a quantum harmonic oscillator as the spring constant formula_28 is increased. Classically this is equivalent to increasing the stiffness of a spring; quantum-mechanically the effect is a narrowing of the potential energy curve in the system Hamiltonian.

If formula_28 is increased adiabatically formula_30 then the system at time formula_31 will be in an instantaneous eigenstate formula_32 of the &quot;current&quot; Hamiltonian formula_33, corresponding to the initial eigenstate of formula_34. For the special case of a system like the quantum harmonic oscillator described by a single quantum number, this means the quantum number will remain unchanged. Figure 1 shows how a harmonic oscillator, initially in its ground state, formula_35, remains in the ground state as the potential energy curve is compressed; the functional form of the state adapting to the slowly varying conditions.

For a rapidly increased spring constant, the system undergoes a diabatic process formula_36 in which the system has no time to adapt its functional form to the changing conditions. While the final state must look identical to the initial state formula_37 for a process occurring over a vanishing time period, there is no eigenstate of the new Hamiltonian, formula_33, that resembles the initial state. The final state is composed of a linear superposition of many different eigenstates of formula_33 which sum to reproduce the form of the initial state.

=== Avoided curve crossing ===

For a more widely applicable example, consider a 2-level atom subjected to an external magnetic field. The states, labelled formula_40 and formula_41 using bra–ket notation, can be thought of as atomic angular-momentum states, each with a particular geometry. For reasons that will become clear these states will henceforth be referred to as the diabatic states. The system wavefunction can be represented as a linear combination of the diabatic states:

:formula_42

With the field absent, the energetic separation of the diabatic states is equal to formula_43; the energy of state formula_40 increases with increasing magnetic field (a low-field-seeking state), while the energy of state formula_41 decreases with increasing magnetic field (a high-field-seeking state). Assuming the magnetic-field dependence is linear, the Hamiltonian matrix for the system with the field applied can be written

:formula_46

where formula_47 is the magnetic moment of the atom, assumed to be the same for the two diabatic states, and formula_48 is some time-independent coupling between the two states. The diagonal elements are the energies of the diabatic states (formula_49 and formula_50), however, as formula_51 is not a diagonal matrix, it is clear that these states are not eigenstates of formula_51 due to the off-diagonal coupling constant.

The eigenvectors of the matrix formula_51 are the eigenstates of the system, which we will label formula_54 and formula_55, with corresponding eigenvalues
formula_56

It is important to realise that the eigenvalues formula_57 and formula_58 are the only allowed outputs for any individual measurement of the system energy, whereas the diabatic energies formula_49 and formula_50 correspond to the expectation values for the energy of the system in the diabatic states formula_40 and formula_41.

Figure 2 shows the dependence of the diabatic and adiabatic energies on the value of the magnetic field; note that for non-zero coupling the eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian cannot be degenerate, and thus we have an avoided crossing. If an atom is initially in state formula_63 in zero magnetic field (on the red curve, at the extreme left), an adiabatic increase in magnetic field formula_64 will ensure the system remains in an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian formula_55 throughout the process (follows the red curve). A diabatic increase in magnetic field formula_66 will ensure the system follows the diabatic path (the dotted blue line), such that the system undergoes a transition to state formula_67. For finite magnetic field slew rates formula_68 there will be a finite probability of finding the system in either of the two eigenstates. See below for approaches to calculating these probabilities.

These results are extremely important in atomic and molecular physics for control of the energy-state distribution in a population of atoms or molecules.

== Mathematical statement ==
Under a slowly changing Hamiltonian formula_69 with instantaneous eigenstates formula_70 and corresponding energies formula_71, a quantum system evolves from the initial state
formula_72
to the final state
formula_73
where the coefficients undergo the change of phase
formula_74

with the dynamical phase
formula_75

and geometric phase
formula_76

In particular, formula_77, so if the system begins in an eigenstate of formula_78, it remains in an eigenstate of formula_69 during the evolution with a change of phase only.

=== Proofs ===



== Example applications ==
Often a solid crystal is modeled as a set of independent valence electrons moving in a mean perfectly periodic potential generated by a rigid lattice of ions. With the Adiabatic theorem we can also include instead the motion of the valence electrons across the crystal and the thermal motion of the ions as in the Born–Oppenheimer approximation.

This does explain many phenomena in the scope of:
* thermodynamics: Temperature dependence of specific heat, thermal expansion, melting
* transport phenomena: the temperature dependence of electric resistivity of conductors, the temperature dependence of electric conductivity in insulators, Some properties of low temperature superconductivity
* optics: optic absorption in the infrared for ionic crystals, Brillouin scattering, Raman scattering

== Deriving conditions for diabatic vs adiabatic passage ==

We will now pursue a more rigorous analysis. Making use of bra–ket notation, the state vector of the system at time formula_31 can be written

:formula_81

where the spatial wavefunction alluded to earlier is the projection of the state vector onto the eigenstates of the position operator

:formula_82

It is instructive to examine the limiting cases, in which formula_18 is very large (adiabatic, or gradual change) and very small (diabatic, or sudden change).

Consider a system Hamiltonian undergoing continuous change from an initial value formula_84, at time formula_5, to a final value formula_86, at time formula_10, where formula_12. The evolution of the system can be described in the Schrödinger picture by the time-evolution operator, defined by the integral equation

:formula_89

which is equivalent to the Schrödinger equation.

:formula_90

along with the initial condition formula_91. Given knowledge of the system wave function at formula_5, the evolution of the system up to a later time formula_31 can be obtained using

:formula_94

The problem of determining the &quot;adiabaticity&quot; of a given process is equivalent to establishing the dependence of formula_95 on formula_18.

To determine the validity of the adiabatic approximation for a given process, one can calculate the probability of finding the system in a state other than that in which it started. Using bra–ket notation and using the definition formula_97, we have:

:formula_98

We can expand formula_95

:formula_100

In the perturbative limit we can take just the first two terms and substitute them into our equation for formula_101, recognizing that

:formula_102

is the system Hamiltonian, averaged over the interval formula_103, we have:

:formula_104

After expanding the products and making the appropriate cancellations, we are left with:

:formula_105

giving

:formula_106

where formula_107 is the root mean square deviation of the system Hamiltonian averaged over the interval of interest.

The sudden approximation is valid when formula_108 (the probability of finding the system in a state other than that in which is started approaches zero), thus the validity condition is given by

:formula_109

which is a statement of the time-energy form of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle.

=== Diabatic passage ===

In the limit formula_23 we have infinitely rapid, or diabatic passage:

:formula_111

The functional form of the system remains unchanged:

:formula_112

This is sometimes referred to as the sudden approximation. The validity of the approximation for a given process can be characterized by the probability that the state of the system remains unchanged:

:formula_113

=== Adiabatic passage ===

In the limit formula_13 we have infinitely slow, or adiabatic passage. The system evolves, adapting its form to the changing conditions,

:formula_115

If the system is initially in an eigenstate of formula_6, after a period formula_18 it will have passed into the &quot;corresponding&quot; eigenstate of formula_9.

This is referred to as the adiabatic approximation. The validity of the approximation for a given process can be determined from the probability that the final state of the system is different from the initial state:

== Calculating adiabatic passage probabilities ==

=== The Landau–Zener formula ===
In 1932 an analytic solution to the problem of calculating adiabatic transition probabilities was published separately by Lev Landau and Clarence Zener, for the special case of a linearly changing perturbation in which the time-varying component does not couple the relevant states (hence the coupling in the diabatic Hamiltonian matrix is independent of time).

The key figure of merit in this approach is the Landau–Zener velocity:
formula_120
where formula_121 is the perturbation variable (electric or magnetic field, molecular bond-length, or any other perturbation to the system), and formula_122 and formula_123 are the energies of the two diabatic (crossing) states. A large formula_124 results in a large diabatic transition probability and vice versa.

Using the Landau–Zener formula the probability, formula_125, of a diabatic transition is given by

formula_126
=== The numerical approach ===
For a transition involving a nonlinear change in perturbation variable or time-dependent coupling between the diabatic states, the equations of motion for the system dynamics cannot be solved analytically. The diabatic transition probability can still be obtained using one of the wide varieties of numerical solution algorithms for ordinary differential equations.

The equations to be solved can be obtained from the time-dependent Schrödinger equation:

formula_127

where formula_128 is a vector containing the adiabatic state amplitudes, formula_129 is the time-dependent adiabatic Hamiltonian, and the overdot represents a time derivative.

Comparison of the initial conditions used with the values of the state amplitudes following the transition can yield the diabatic transition probability. In particular, for a two-state system:
formula_130
for a system that began with formula_131.

<text>In abstract algebra, a discrete valuation ring (DVR) is a principal ideal domain (PID) with exactly one non-zero maximal ideal.

This means a DVR is an integral domain &quot;R&quot; that satisfies any and all of the following equivalent conditions:

# &quot;R&quot; is a local ring, a principal ideal domain, and not a field.
# &quot;R&quot; is a valuation ring with a value group isomorphic to the integers under addition.
# &quot;R&quot; is a local ring, a Dedekind domain, and not a field.
# &quot;R&quot; is Noetherian and a local domain whose unique maximal ideal is principal, and not a field.
# &quot;R&quot; is integrally closed, Noetherian, and a local ring with Krull dimension one.
# &quot;R&quot; is a principal ideal domain with a unique non-zero prime ideal.
# &quot;R&quot; is a principal ideal domain with a unique irreducible element (up to multiplication by units).
# &quot;R&quot; is a unique factorization domain with a unique irreducible element (up to multiplication by units).
# &quot;R&quot; is Noetherian, not a field, and every nonzero fractional ideal of &quot;R&quot; is irreducible in the sense that it cannot be written as a finite intersection of fractional ideals properly containing it.
# There is some discrete valuation ν on the field of fractions &quot;K&quot; of &quot;R&quot; such that &quot;R&quot; = {0} formula_1 {&quot;x&quot; formula_2 &quot;K&quot; : ν(&quot;x&quot;) ≥ 0}.

==Examples==

=== Algebraic ===

==== Localization of Dedekind rings ====
Let formula_3. Then, the field of fractions of formula_4 is formula_5. For any nonzero element formula_6 of formula_5, we can apply unique factorization to the numerator and denominator of &quot;r&quot; to write &quot;r&quot; as where &quot;z&quot;, &quot;n&quot;, and &quot;k&quot; are integers with &quot;z&quot; and &quot;n&quot; odd. In this case, we define ν(&quot;r&quot;)=&quot;k&quot;.
Then formula_4 is the discrete valuation ring corresponding to ν. The maximal ideal of formula_4 is the principal ideal generated by 2, i.e. formula_10, and the &quot;unique&quot; irreducible element (up to units) is 2 (this is also known as a uniformizing parameter). Note that formula_4 is the localization of the Dedekind domain formula_12 at the prime ideal generated by 2.

More generally, any localization of a Dedekind domain at a non-zero prime ideal is a discrete valuation ring; in practice, this is frequently how discrete valuation rings arise. In particular, we can define rings
:formula_13
for any prime &quot;p&quot; in complete analogy.

==== &quot;p&quot;-adic integers ====
The ring formula_14 of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers is a DVR, for any prime formula_15. Here formula_15 is an irreducible element; the valuation assigns to each formula_15-adic integer formula_18 the largest integer formula_19 such that formula_20 divides formula_18.

==== Formal power series ====
Another important example of a DVR is the ring of formal power series formula_22 in one variable formula_23 over some field formula_19. The &quot;unique&quot; irreducible element is formula_23, the maximal ideal of formula_26 is the principal ideal generated by formula_23, and the valuation formula_28 assigns to each power series the index (i.e. degree) of the first non-zero coefficient.

If we restrict ourselves to real or complex coefficients, we can consider the ring of power series in one variable that &quot;converge&quot; in a neighborhood of 0 (with the neighborhood depending on the power series). This is a discrete valuation ring. This is useful for building intuition with the Valuative criterion of properness.

==== Ring in function field ====
For an example more geometrical in nature, take the ring &quot;R&quot; = {&quot;f&quot;/&quot;g&quot; : &quot;f&quot;, &quot;g&quot; polynomials in R[&quot;X&quot;] and &quot;g&quot;(0) ≠ 0}, considered as a subring of the field of rational functions R(&quot;X&quot;) in the variable &quot;X&quot;. &quot;R&quot; can be identified with the ring of all real-valued rational functions defined (i.e. finite) in a neighborhood of 0 on the real axis (with the neighborhood depending on the function). It is a discrete valuation ring; the &quot;unique&quot; irreducible element is &quot;X&quot; and the valuation assigns to each function &quot;f&quot; the order (possibly 0) of the zero of &quot;f&quot; at 0. This example provides the template for studying general algebraic curves near non-singular points, the algebraic curve in this case being the real line.

=== Scheme-theoretic ===

==== Henselian trait ====
For a DVR formula_26 it is common to write the fraction field as formula_30 and formula_31 the residue field. These correspond to the generic and closed points of formula_32 For example, the closed point of formula_33 is formula_34 and the generic point is formula_35. Sometimes this is denoted as

:formula_36

where formula_37 is the generic point and formula_38 is the closed point .

==== Localization of a point on a curve ====
Given an algebraic curve formula_39, the local ring formula_40 at a smooth point formula_41 is a discrete valuation ring, because it is a principal valuation ring. Note because the point formula_41 is smooth, the completion of the local ring is isomorphic to the completion of the localization of formula_43 at some point formula_44.

==Uniformizing parameter==
Given a DVR &quot;R&quot;, any irreducible element of &quot;R&quot; is a generator for the unique maximal ideal of &quot;R&quot; and vice versa. Such an element is also called a uniformizing parameter of &quot;R&quot; (or a uniformizing element, a uniformizer, or a prime element).

If we fix a uniformizing parameter &quot;t&quot;, then &quot;M&quot;=(&quot;t&quot;) is the unique maximal ideal of &quot;R&quot;, and every other non-zero ideal is a power of &quot;M&quot;, i.e. has the form (&quot;t&quot; &quot;k&quot;) for some &quot;k&quot;≥0. All the powers of &quot;t&quot; are distinct, and so are the powers of &quot;M&quot;. Every non-zero element &quot;x&quot; of &quot;R&quot; can be written in the form α&quot;t&quot; &quot;k&quot; with α a unit in &quot;R&quot; and &quot;k&quot;≥0, both uniquely determined by &quot;x&quot;. The valuation is given by &quot;ν&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;kv&quot;(&quot;t&quot;). So to understand the ring completely, one needs to know the group of units of &quot;R&quot; and how the units interact additively with the powers of &quot;t&quot;.

The function &quot;v&quot; also makes any discrete valuation ring into a Euclidean domain.

== Topology ==
Every discrete valuation ring, being a local ring, carries a natural topology and is a topological ring. It also admits a metric space structure where the distance between two elements &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot; can be measured as follows:
:formula_45
(or with any other fixed real number &gt; 1 in place of 2). Intuitively: an element &quot;z&quot; is &quot;small&quot; and &quot;close to 0&quot; iff its valuation ν(&quot;z&quot;) is large. The function |x-y|, supplemented by |0|=0, is the restriction of an absolute value defined on the field of fractions of the discrete valuation ring.

A DVR is compact if and only if it is complete and its residue field &quot;R&quot;/&quot;M&quot; is a finite field.

Examples of complete DVRs include
* the ring of &quot;p&quot;-adic integers and 
* the ring of formal power series over any field
For a given DVR, one often passes to its completion, a complete DVR containing the given ring that is often easier to study. This completion procedure can be thought of in a geometrical way as passing from rational functions to power series, or from rational numbers to the reals.

The ring of all formal power series in one variable with real coefficients is the completion of the ring of rational functions defined (i.e. finite) in a neighborhood of 0 on the real line; it is also the completion of the ring of all real power series that converge near 0. The completion of formula_46 (which can be seen as the set of all rational numbers that are &quot;p&quot;-adic integers) is the ring of all &quot;p&quot;-adic integers Z&quot;p&quot;.

<text>Leslie Mortier Shaw (November 2, 1848March 28, 1932) was an American businessman, lawyer, and politician. He served as the 17th Governor of Iowa and was a Republican candidate in the 1908 United States presidential election. He was Secretary of the Treasury from 1902 to 1907.

==Biography==
Shaw was born on November 2, 1848 in Morristown, Vermont, the son of Boardman O. Shaw and Louise Spaulding &quot;Lovisa&quot; Shaw. He attended Cornell College in 1874. Shaw married the former Alice Crenshaw on December 6, 1877, with whom he had three children.

Shaw was a part-time lawyer and part-time apple salesman in Denison, Iowa. He later became a banker.

He became active in politics during the 1896 presidential election where he held speeches in favor of William McKinley, arguing in favor of his monetary policy.

In 1898, he became the 17th Governor of Iowa, serving until 1902. He then became the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury under President Theodore Roosevelt from 1902 to 1907.

Like his predecessor Secretary Lyman Gage, Shaw firmly believed that the Treasury should serve the money market in times of difficulty through the introduction of Treasury funds. To this end, Shaw bought back the government bonds from commercial banks that owned them, increased the number of government depository banks, and in 1902, he told the banks that they no longer needed to keep cash reserves against their holdings of public funds. The intended effect of these actions was to provide a more elastic currency which would then respond to the needs of the market. The government intervention in the money market reached its height with Shaw. He supported tariff theory according to the New York Times. He resigned on March 3, 1907, to become a banker in New York City. Later that year, the Panic of 1907 took place.

He was a candidate for the Republican Party nomination during the U.S. presidential election in 1908.

After leaving the Presidential Cabinet, he returned to banking, working in New York City. Shaw was a critic of Woodrow Wilson and the League of Nations. He campaigned for Calvin Coolidge and Herbert Hoover. He was a strong supporter of the Smoot-Hawley tariff.

Shaw died in Washington, D.C., and was buried in Oakland Cemetery in Denison, Iowa.

<text>Tobias Augustus Matthay (19 February 185815 December 1945) was an English pianist, teacher, and composer.

==Biography==
Matthay was born in Clapham, Surrey, in 1858 to parents who had come from northern Germany and eventually became naturalised British subjects. He entered London&#x27;s Royal Academy of Music in 1871 and eight months later he received the first scholarship given to honour the knighthood of its principal, Sir William Sterndale Bennett. At the academy, Matthay studied composition under Sir William Sterndale Bennett and Arthur Sullivan, and piano with William Dorrell and Walter Macfarren. He served as a sub-professor there from 1876 to 1880, and became an assistant professor of pianoforte in 1880, before being promoted to professor in 1884. With Frederick Corder and John Blackwood McEwen, he co-founded the Society of British Composers in 1905. Matthay remained at the RAM until 1925, when he was forced to resign because McEwen—his former student who was then the academy&#x27;s Principal—publicly attacked his teaching.

In 1903, after over a decade of observation, analysis, and experimentation, he published &quot;The Act of Touch&quot;, an encyclopedic volume that influenced piano pedagogy throughout the English-speaking world. So many students were soon in quest of his insights that two years later he opened the Tobias Matthay Pianoforte School, first in Oxford Street, then in 1909 relocating to Wimpole Street, where it remained for the next 30 years. The teachers there included his sister Dora. He soon became known for his teaching principles that stressed proper piano touch and analysis of arm movements. He wrote several additional books on piano technique that brought him international recognition, and in 1912 he published &quot;Musical Interpretation&quot;, a widely read book that analyzed the principles of effective musicianship. However, whilst acknowledging its importance, a later interpreter of Matthay&#x27;s writing criticized its lack of clarity:The interminable repetitions, recapitulations, summaries, footnotes, all with a change of emphasis and as often as not with new names for the same thing, led enquirers into a maze from which only the clearest brain equipped with a dogged perseverance, could extricate itself.

Many of his pupils went on to define a school of 20th century English pianism, including Arthur Alexander, York Bowen, Hilda Dederich, Norman Fraser, Myra Hess, Denise Lasimonne, Clifford Curzon, Harold Craxton, Moura Lympany, Gertrude Peppercorn, Irene Scharrer, Lilias Mackinnon, Guy Jonson, Vivian Langrish, Hope Squire, Eileen Joyce, jazz &quot;syncopated&quot; pianist Raie Da Costa, Harriet Cohen, Dorothy Howell, and the duo Bartlett and Robertson. He taught many Americans, including Ray Lev, Eunice Norton, and Lytle Powell, and he was also the teacher of Canadian pianist Harry Dean, English composer Arnold Bax and English conductor Ernest Read. In 1920, Hilda Hester Collens, who had studied under Matthay from 1910 to 1914, founded a music college in Manchester named the Matthay School of Music in his honour. It was later renamed the Northern School of Music, a predecessor institution of the Royal Northern College of Music.

His wife Jessie née Kennedy, whom he married in 1893, wrote a biography of her husband, published posthumously in 1945. She was a sister of Marjory Kennedy-Fraser. She was born in 1869 and died in 1937. Tobias Matthay died at his country home, High Marley, near Haslemere in 1945, aged 87.

==Compositions==
Matthay&#x27;s larger scale compositions and virtuoso piano works were all written between the 1870s and 1890s before he focused instead on piano technique and teaching. They include two symphonies, some concert overtures and several piano concertante works. They were all forgotten for many years, resurfacing at a Sotheby&#x27;s manuscript auction on 30 November 2006, won by the Royal Academy of Music.

Only the symphonic overture &quot;In May&quot; (1883) and the one movement Concert Piece in A minor for piano and orchestra (begun about 1883 and revised till about 1908) gained much contemporary attention. The Concert Piece became his most popular large scale work, although its London premiere at the Proms had to wait 25 years before its first performance, on 28 August 1909. The soloist was York Bowen. It was then performed at the Proms by Vivian Langrish in 1914, in 1919, and 1920 and again in 1925 by Matthay&#x27;s student Betty Humby (who later became Betty Humby Beecham after she married Thomas Beecham). Myra Hess also performed it under Matthay&#x27;s baton at Queen&#x27;s Hall on 18 July 1922 in the presence of the King and Queen for the Royal Academy of Music Centennial Celebration.

Matthay also wrote chamber music (most notably the Piano Quartet, op.20 of 1882), a small number of songs, and a great deal of piano music. His &quot;31 Variations and Derivations on an Original Theme&quot; for piano, written in 1891 and revised till 1918, was one of his last important early period works. Showing the influence of both Liszt and Wagner, it was considered harmonically daring when first composed. The work is in two parts, the second growing increasingly complex.

During and after the First World War Matthay returned to piano composition, but abandoned his previously complex style in favour of short character pieces closer in spirit to Schumann&#x27;s pieces for children. In 1933 he recorded some of these, including &quot;Twilight Hills&quot; and &quot;Wind Sprites&quot; from the 1919 suite &quot;On Surrey Hills&quot;, op.30, as well as the older Prelude and the highly demanding &quot;Bravura&quot; from &quot;Studies in the Form of a Suite (1887).&quot;

A nearly complete collection of the published piano works is held at the International Piano Archives at the University of Maryland. It was donated by the late James Matthew Holloway from papers originally in the possession of the pianist and favourite Mathay student Denise Lassimonne (1903–1994), whom Matthay took in after the death of her father, later naming her his ward and heir Many of the scores contain corrections, editorial markings and comments by Matthay himself.

<text>Edward Brown (May 23, 1865 – February 8, 1947) was a Manitoba politician. He served briefly as leader of the Manitoba Liberal Party (1906–07), and was later a cabinet minister in Tobias Norris&#x27; government (1915–1922).

== Life and career ==
Born in Gresham, Bruce County, Canada West, the son of Edward J. Brown, was educated in St. Catharines. In 1882, he began business as a merchant in Paisley. In 1888, Brown came to Portage la Prairie; he served as mayor there for six years. He married Esther Huston in 1893. In 1909, Brown moved to Winnipeg where he established a financial brokerage firm that he operated until 1942. He was also president of the Canada West Securities Corporation and of the British Northwestern Fire Insurance Company. In 1910, he was listed as one of Winnipeg&#x27;s 19 millionaires.

Brown made his electoral debut in the provincial campaign of 1903, narrowly losing to Conservative Hugh Armstrong in Portage la Prairie. He subsequently became a leading organizer for the Liberals, and was acclaimed as party leader on March 28, 1906 (replacing Charles Mickle). He was again defeated by Armstrong in the election of 1907, however, and resigned as party leader shortly thereafter. Brown lost a third electoral contest in 1910, falling to Lendrum McMeans in Winnipeg South, 2545 votes to 2496.

Brown finally entered parliament in 1915, running in a deferred election in the northern riding of The Pas. The Liberal party led by Premier Tobias Norris had already won a landslide victory in the rest of the province, and Brown had joined the cabinet as Provincial Treasurer; perhaps not surprisingly, he was unopposed for his riding. Brown held his cabinet position until the Norris government was defeated in 1922. In the election of 1920, he fended off a weak challenge from Labour candidate A. Norgrove.

In 1922, Brown supported efforts to reunite the &quot;Unionist&quot; and &quot;Laurier Liberal&quot; factions of the Liberal Party in Canada and Manitoba (see Wilfrid Laurier). While these efforts were successful, they led to a popular perception that the previously-independent Norris government would henceforth be subservient to the federal Liberals. Opposition parties used this to their advantage in the election of 1922, which the United Farmers of Manitoba won in a landslide.

Brown was not a candidate in 1922, and did not return to political life thereafter.

He died in Winnipeg at the age of 81.
