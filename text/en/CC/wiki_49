<text>The Hawker Fury is a British biplane fighter aircraft used by the Royal Air Force in the 1930s. It was a fast, agile aircraft, and the first interceptor in RAF service faster than in level flight. It was the fighter counterpart to the Hawker Hart light bomber.

==Design and development==
The Hawker Fury was a development of the earlier Hawker F.20/27 prototype fighter, replacing the radial engine of the F.20/27 with the new Rolls-Royce F.XI V-12 engine (later known as the Rolls-Royce Kestrel), which was also used by Hawker&#x27;s new light bomber, the Hawker Hart. The new fighter prototype, known as the &quot;Hawker Hornet&quot;, first flew at Brooklands, Surrey, in March 1929. The Hornet was a single-engined biplane, with single bay wings, initially powered by a Rolls-Royce F.XIC engine enclosed by a smooth, streamlined cowling but was quickly re-engined with a Kestrel IS. The prototype was evaluated against the similarly powered Fairey Firefly II, being preferred because of its better handling and its all metal structure, compared with the mainly wooden construction of the Firefly.

The Hornet was purchased by the Air Ministry at the start of 1930 and was subject to more tests, with a small initial production order for 21 aircraft (to be called &quot;Hawker Fury&quot; – as the Air Ministry wanted fighter names that &quot;reflected ferocity&quot;) placed during 1930. The &quot;Fury I&quot; made its maiden flight at Brooklands, with chief test pilot George Bulman at the controls, on 25 March 1931. The Fury was the first operational RAF fighter aircraft to be able to exceed in level flight. It had highly sensitive controls which gave it superb aerobatic performance. It was designed partly for the fast interception of bombers and to that end it could climb to in 4 minutes 25 seconds, powered by a Kestrel engine.

An experimental prototype, the &quot;High Speed Fury&quot;, was built to test design features for Hawker&#x27;s planned competitor for the F.7/30 fighter competition (the Hawker P.V.3) as well as for more general development. While the P.V.3 was unsuccessful owing to the use of the unreliable evaporatively cooled Rolls-Royce Goshawk engine, many of the improvements tested on the High Speed Fury were incorporated in an improved &quot;Fury II&quot;, with a cleaned up airframe and reduced drag, powered by a Mk4 Kestrel engine, which gave improved speed and rate of climb. Sydney Camm designed a monoplane version of the Fury in 1933. It was not developed until Rolls-Royce produced what became their famous Merlin engine. The design was then revised according to Air Ministry specification F5/34 to become the prototype Hawker Hurricane.

==Operational history==
The Fury I entered squadron service with the RAF in May 1931, re-equipping 43 Squadron. Owing to finance cuts in the Great Depression, only relatively small numbers of Fury Is were ordered, the type equipping 1 and 25 squadrons; the slower Bristol Bulldog equipped ten fighter squadrons. The Fury II entered service in 1936–1937, increasing total number of squadrons to six. Furies remained with RAF Fighter Command until January 1939, replaced primarily with Gloster Gladiators and other types, such as Hurricane. After their front line service ended, they continued in use as trainers.

The Fury was exported to several customers, being supplied with a variety of engines, including Kestrels, Hispano Suiza and Lorraine Petrel vee-type engines, Armstrong Siddeley Panther, Pratt &amp; Whitney Hornet and Bristol Mercury radials. Three Furies were ordered by Spain in 1935, it being intended to produce another 50 under licence. The Spanish variant had a cantilever undercarriage design with Dowty internally sprung wheels, similar to that used on the Gladiator and was powered by a Hispano Suiza 12Xbr engine, reaching a speed of . The three Furies were delivered without armament on 11 July 1936, just before the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. They were taken into service by the Spanish Republican Air Force, being fitted with machine guns salvaged from crashed aircraft. One Fury made a forced landing behind enemy lines due to a lack of fuel and was repaired by the Nationalists, although it was not used operationally, while the Republicans used one of the Furies in the defence of Madrid until wrecked in a crash in November 1936.

Although withdrawn from RAF squadrons, the Fury was still used by some foreign air forces in the early 1940s; Yugoslav Furies saw action against Axis forces in the German invasion of 1941. On 6 April 1941, a squadron of Furies took off against the invading German Messerschmitt Bf 109Es and Messerschmitt Bf 110s. In the resulting air battle 10 Furies were destroyed, almost the entire squadron. The commanding officer of the 36 LG was Major Franjo Džal, who watched from the ground as his men were slaughtered in their obsolete biplanes. In an unequal battle against superior adversaries, five aircraft were destroyed while taking off and eight pilots killed. Two more Furies and Bücker Bü 131 were destroyed on the ground. Of the attacking German aircraft, five Bf 109s and two Bf 110s failed to return, though most were non-combat losses, at least one was lost when rammed by a Fury. The other squadron of Yugoslav Furies active at the time of the invasion strafed enemy tanks and ground forces, some being lost to ground fire and one being destroyed in a dogfight with a Fiat CR.42. The rest of the Yugoslav Furies were destroyed when they became unserviceable or at the time of Armistice on 15 April. Ex-RAF Furies were also used by the South African Air Force against the Italian forces in East Africa in 1940 and despite their obsolescence, destroyed two Caproni bombers as well as strafing many airfields, destroying fighters and bombers on the ground. A total of 262 Furies were produced, of which 22 served in Persia, three in Portugal, at least 30 in South Africa, three in Spain, at least 30 in Yugoslavia and the remainder in the United Kingdom.

==Variants==
;Hawker Hornet
:Single-seat fighter prototype. Powered by a Rolls-Royce F.XIA and later by a F.XIS. Only one was built. This aircraft was slightly smaller and lighter than the Fury and considered by Hawker as a separate type.

==Surviving aircraft==
===Airworthy===

A Hawker Fury Mk.I, serial number &quot;K5674&quot;, is owned by the Historical Aircraft Collection and based at the Imperial War Museum Duxford in the United Kingdom. This aircraft was delivered to the RAF in 1935 and allocated to 43 Squadron, where it was flown until 1939 by Flying Officer Frederick Rosier, later to be Air Chief Marshal Sir Frederick Rosier. In 1940, it was sent to South Africa where it was flown by 13 Squadron (later 43 Squadron) of the South African Air Force. It was written off after making a forced landing, due to running out of fuel. It was returned to the United Kingdom in 2003 and restored to flying condition, with the civil registration &quot;G-CBZP&quot;. It made its first post-restoration flight in July 2012.

===On display===
A Hawker Fury Mk.I, serial number &quot;K1928&quot;, is being restored at Little Gransden Airfield to static display by the Cambridge Bomber and Fighter Society. The aircraft was part of the first production batch of 21 aircraft built in the 1930s and was flown by No. 43 Squadron. A replica Hawker Fury, serial number &quot;K1930&quot;, with an original Kestrel engine, is on display at the Military Aviation Museum of Virginia Beach, along with its successor, a Hawker Hurricane.

<text>The Welsh Centre for International Affairs (WCIA) is a Welsh international affairs and strategy think tank, established in 1973 to promote the exchange of ideas on international issues, build international partnerships connecting Welsh people and organisations with the world, and encourage global action in communities and organisations across Wales. It is based in the Temple of Peace in Cardiff.

It has been a charity trust since inception in 1973 and became a registered charity with the Charity Commission in 2014. It had an endowment of £1.2m in 2017–18.

== History ==
The organisation&#x27;s headquarters, the Temple of Peace in Cathays Park, was built in November 1938 by Minnie James of Dowlais, a bereaved mother of World War I victims, David Davies MP (later known as Lord Davies of Llandinam), and the King Edward VII Welsh National Memorial Association. The land was also gifted by the Montgomeryshire MP.

In its early years it housed the King Edward VII Association, the United Nations Association (UNA) Wales, and in 1970 a successor organisation was proposed, which became the WCIA.

The initiative for the foundation of the WCIA came in 1968 through a Western Mail editorial, which called for &quot;Welshmen to look beyond the confines of Wales and Britain to extend their knowledge and understanding of the rest of the world.&quot; Secretary of State for Wales, George Thomas MP was integral to bringing together the Association&#x27;s Standing Conference. Among the early supporters were the Welsh Office, nearby local authorities, the University of Wales and education colleges, MPs, trade unionists, industrialists, churches, political parties, members of the media, and voluntary organisations. The opening ceremony was held on 11 October 1973 by Lady Tweedsmuir, Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.

In 2014, the WCIA merged with CEWC Cymru (Council for Education in World Citizenship Wales) and UNA Wales (United Nations Association Wales).

The organisation&#x27;s headquarters, the Temple of Peace, was previously owned by Public Health Wales, but was sold to nearby Cardiff University in 2017.

<text>Murray David Perahia ( ; born April 19, 1947) is an American pianist and conductor. He has been considered one of the greatest living pianists. He was the first North American pianist to win the Leeds International Piano Competition, in 1972. Known as a leading interpreter of Bach, Handel, Scarlatti, Mozart, Beethoven, and Schumann, among other composers, Perahia has won numerous awards, including three Grammy Awards from a total of 18 nominations, and 9 Gramophone Awards in addition to its first and only &quot;Piano Award&quot;.

==Early life==
Murray (Moshe) was born in the Bronx borough of New York City to a family of Sephardi Jewish origin. According to the biography on his Mozart piano sonatas CD, his first language was Judaeo-Spanish, or Ladino. The family came from Thessaloniki, Greece. His father moved to the United States in 1935.
Perahia began studying the piano at age four, with a teacher, he said, who was &quot;very limiting&quot; because she made him play a single piece until it was perfect. He said his musical interests blossomed at age 15 for reasons he can&#x27;t explain, and he began to practice seriously. At age 17, Perahia attended Mannes College, where he studied keyboard, conducting, and composition with his teacher and mentor Mieczysław Horszowski. During the summer, he also attended the Marlboro Music School and Festival, where he studied with musicians Rudolf Serkin, Alexander Schneider, and Pablo Casals, among others. He played duets for piano four hands with Serkin, who later made Perahia his assistant at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, a position he held for over a year. 
In 1965, Perahia won the Young Concert Artists International Auditions. In 1971, he won a grant from the Ford Foundation to commission a new work from a composer of his choice. In 1972, he was the first North American to win first prize at the Leeds Piano Competition, helping to cement its reputation for advancing the careers of young pianists. 

==Career==
In 1973, Perahia worked with Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears at the Aldeburgh Festival, and with fellow pianist Radu Lupu. He was co-artistic director of the Festival from 1981 to 1989.

In the 1980s, Perahia was invited to work with Vladimir Horowitz, an admirer of his art. Perahia says this had a defining influence on his pianism. He became close to Horowitz, whom he visited during the elder pianist&#x27;s last four years to play for him.

From 1973 to 2010, Perahia recorded exclusively for Columbia Masterworks, now Sony Classical. His first major recording project was Mozart&#x27;s 27 piano concertos, conducted from the keyboard with the English Chamber Orchestra. In the 1980s, he also recorded Beethoven&#x27;s five piano concertos, with Bernard Haitink and the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra. 

===Hand injuries===
In 1990, Perahia suffered a cut to his right thumb, which became septic. He took antibiotics for this condition, but they affected his health. In 1992, his career was threatened by a bone abnormality in his hand causing inflammation, requiring several years away from the keyboard and a series of operations. During that time, he says, he found solace through studying the music of J.S. Bach. After recovering, he produced a series of award-winning recordings of Bach&#x27;s keyboard works in the late 1990s, including a notable rendition of the &quot;Goldberg Variations&quot;.

In early 2005, Perahia&#x27;s hand problem recurred, prompting him to withdraw from the concert stage on the advice of his doctors. He cancelled several appearances at the Barbican Centre, as well as a ten-city national tour of the United States but returned with recitals in German cities in 2006 and at the Barbican in April 2007.

In the autumn of 2007, he completed a ten-city tour of the United States. Owing to his hand problem, and on the advice of his doctor, Perahia cancelled a February 2008 solo recital at the Barbican Centre and a tour in the United States with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields (March and April 2008). He returned to the platform in August 2008, touring with the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra under the direction of Bernard Haitink, and had an Asian recital tour in October and November.

=== Recent activities ===
Perahia has recorded Chopin&#x27;s études, and Schubert&#x27;s late piano sonatas. He is currently editing a new Urtext edition of Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonatas. Besides his solo career, Perahia is active in chamber music and appears regularly with the Guarneri and Budapest String Quartets. He is also Principal Guest Conductor of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields, with which he records and performs.

In January 2009, Murray Perahia was appointed president of the Jerusalem Music Center established by violinist Isaac Stern. In an interview with Haaretz newspaper, he said: &quot;Music represents an ideal world where all dissonances resolve, where all modulations — that are journeys — return home, and where surprise and stability coexist.&quot;

Perahia appeared at Sir Neville Marriner&#x27;s 90th birthday concert on April 1, 2014, playing Mozart&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 20 with the Academy of St Martin in the Fields conducted by Marriner.

In 2016, Perahia signed with Deutsche Grammophon. His first release for the label, Bach&#x27;s &quot;French Suites&quot;, came out in October 2016.

On April 16, 2024, at Wigmore Hall, after a six-year health hiatus, Perahia returned to performing.

== Teaching ==
Upon graduation from Mannes, Perahia was appointed to the faculty and taught there from 1969 to 1979. Perahia was invited to teach at the International Piano Foundation Theo Lieven (known today as the International Piano Academy Lake Como) to selected students. He has given masterclasses at such institutions as Juilliard School, Stanford University, and Peabody Institute, among many others. Each year, he holds a summer course at the Jerusalem Music Centre to young Israeli pianists, aged 12 to 18. He continues to give frequent masterclasses as president of the JMC. Perahia plans to hold a series of masterclasses in Munich on Beethoven&#x27;s piano sonatas, hosted by the publisher G. Henle Verlag, with ten young professional pianists.

== Personal life ==
Perahia lives in London with his wife, Ninette Shohet, who is of Iraqi-Jewish heritage. He has two adult sons, Benjamin and Raphael.

<text>The Buffalo River is the longest unimpounded river in Middle Tennessee in the United States. It flows through the southern and western portions of that region. The Buffalo is the largest tributary of the Duck River. Canoeing is popular, especially in its middle section. The river is named for the Buffalo fish which was abundant when the first European settlers arrived.

==Sources==
The Buffalo rises in northern Lawrence County. U.S. Highway 43 crosses both the North and South Forks. The highway crosses the North Fork several times as it parallels the river for about . The confluence of the North and South forks about a mile west of Highway 43 is the head of the Buffalo.

==Course==

Below the confluence, the Buffalo trends northwest for several miles. After entering Lewis County, it intersects the Natchez Trace Parkway. The confluence with the Little Buffalo River occurs in Lewis County followed by smaller tributaries. State Route 99 parallels the river for a distance and then crosses it in the broad Texas Bottoms. In Lewis County, the river continues to meander westward. Entering northern Wayne County, the stream has several more tributaries, notably the Green River.

A few miles below the mouth of the Green River is the community of Flatwoods. Here State Route 13 bridges the Buffalo and then abruptly turns northerly for the balance of its flow. It crosses into Perry County near here. For most of its course through Perry County, the Buffalo roughly parallels State Route 13. Shortly after crossing into Humphreys County, it is bridged by Interstate 40 and then by Bakerville Road. About 8 miles north of this is the mouth of the Buffalo, its confluence with the Duck.

==Watershed==
The upper Buffalo River, in Lawrence County, is designated a &quot;State Scenic River&quot; under the Tennessee Wild and Scenic Rivers Act.

The only incorporated towns along the Buffalo, Linden and Lobelville, are in Perry County. Two unincorporated communities, Flatwoods and Beardstown are adjacent to the river in Perry County.

===Hydrology===
The Buffalo River watershed is the total land area that drains into the Buffalo River. It is designated as Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC) 06040004 by the USGS. It empties into watershed 06040003, the Lower Duck River watershed.
The Buffalo River watershed is composed of three sub-watersheds; two sections of the Buffalo River and the Cane Creek sub-watershed. The southeastern part of the Buffalo River watershed is HUC 0604000401. It includes the headwaters of the Buffalo plus the Little Buffalo River and both Chief Creek and Fortyeight Creek. The western side and northern one-third of the watershed is HUC 0604000402. It reaches from the Green River in Wayne County at the southern end to the mouth of the Buffalo in Humphreys County. Cane Creek, the third part of the watershed is HUC 0604000403. Upper Cane Creek begins at the headwaters of the creek near Hohenwald in Lewis County. Lower Cane Creek includes the mouth at Beardstown in Perry County.

The Buffalo River watershed contains 1,200 miles of tributary streams. Impoundments include 349 lake acres in ponds and water stored behind 10 dams. These dams are primarily in the southeastern portion of the watershed. The majority of the impounded water is in Laurel Hill Lake with plus an additional in the VFW Lake. TDEC has also identified some wetlands sites in the southeastern portion of the watershed.

===Land use===
Watershed land is primarily forested: 69% being deciduous, 3% evergreen, and 4% mixed forest. The second significant land use is agricultural crops. Pasture and hay fields account for 10% of the area while row crops occupy another 8%. Residential and commercial areas occupy less than 0.5% of the land.

The soil in the watershed is primarily loam with some silty loam. The soil pH varies from about 4.85 to 5.45. Portions of the area have characteristic karst topography.

==Natural history==
The Buffalo is rich in aquatic life. Fishing it through passive methods such as limb and trot lines is traditional. There are many catfish and other non-game fish such as drum. The largest aquatic animal usually found in the Buffalo is the alligator snapping turtle. It is often caught (usually unintentionally) on trot and limb lines. These turtles can weigh or more.

TDEC lists 48 rare plant and animal species in the watershed. Rarity typically results from either a small population or a very restricted range. The non-aquatic species include 18 plants, one mammal, three birds, two reptiles, one amphibian, three insects and spiders, and one other invertebrate. There are 20 aquatic species associated with the river or its tributaries; 12 fish, one crustacean, three mussels, and four snails.

===Fish===
Identified rare fish in the Buffalo include eight varieties of darters, one madtom catfish (saddled madtom), and one cavefish (southern cavefish). Most of the identified darters are listed as either threatened or endangered by the state and/or federal government (the latter by authority of the Endangered Species Act of 1973).
*&quot;Ammocrypta vivax&quot;, scaly sand darter
*&quot;Cyprinella monacha&quot;, turquoise shiner or spotfin chub – Federal threatened status
*&quot;Etheostoma aquali&quot;, coppercheek darter – State-level threatened status
*&quot;Etheostoma boschungi&quot;, slackwater darter – Federal threatened status
*&quot;Etheostoma cinereum&quot;, ashy darter – State-level threatened status
*&quot;Etheostoma denoncourti&quot;, golden darter
*&quot;Etheostoma pseudovulatum&quot;, egg-mimic darter – State-level endangered status
*&quot;Percina burtoni&quot;, blotchside darter
*&quot;Percina macrocephala&quot;, longhead darter – State-level threatened status

===Crustacean===
The Alabama crayfish, &quot;Orconectes alabamensis&quot; is a rare crayfish species found near the Buffalo.

===Mussels===
Three species of mussels are among the rare species listed by TDEC. Both the Cracking Pearly Mussel and the Pale Lilliput are listed by both State and Federal authorities as Endangered.
*&quot;Hemistena lata&quot;, Cracking Pearly Mussel
*&quot;Quadrilla cylindrical cylindrical&quot;, Rabbitsfoot
*&quot;Toxolasma cylindrellus&quot;, Pale Lilliput

===Snails===
Four species of rare snails are found near the Buffalo; none of them are included by TDEC on species concerns lists.
*&quot;Leptoxis praerosa&quot;, Onyx Rocksnail
*&quot;Lithasia duttoniana&quot;, Helmet Rocksnail
*&quot;Lithasia geniculata fuliginosa&quot;, Geniculate Rocksnail
*&quot;Lithasia geniculata fulginosa&quot;, Geniculate Riversnail

==Geology==

Except for a very small section on the southern end, the watershed is part of the Western Highland Rim, one of 25 Level IV subecoregions in the state. The dissected, rolling terrain is characterized by long ridges with steep sides and hollows deeply eroded into those ridges. The river flows in a wide flood plain of &quot;bottom land&quot;. The elevation varies from .

The predominant geology of the area is that of Paleozoic limestones. The Mississippian limestone base along with chert and shale is overlaid by fairly thin soils of moderate fertility. These tend to be acidic. Much of the differential erosion leading to the terrain features results from differences in deposition and mineralization of the various types of limestone in the area and the presence of large portions of chert. Some chert bears small quantities of the iron-containing mineral hematite or other oxides of iron. During the mid-to-late 19th century there was considerable iron-ore related mining and smelting of Limonite ore.

The sizable tributary streams flow out of narrow hollows into the Buffalo; only the largest ones have true stream valleys of their own. Streams are typically clear with a moderate gradient. 
==Economy==
Canoeing float trips significantly contribute to the area&#x27;s economy. The area&#x27;s remoteness depresses the local economy compared to that of the state as a whole. The Middle Tennessee Council of the Boy Scouts of America operates Grimes Canoe Base along the Buffalo in southern Perry County. Several businesses provide commercial canoe and float access to the river for tourists. The river is primarily a Class I stream with significant stretches of flat water. Free float tubing is feasible in selected portions of the river. Between 1837 and 1837, the section of the river below Beardstown was briefly legally considered a navigable waterway.

There are three trails associated with the river.
* Buffalo River – Perry County – A scenic water trail through nature – 
* Ladies Bluff Trail – Perry County – A scenic, hiking, wilderness trail – – Partially ADA compliant
* Linden City Park Walking Trail – Perry County – Health and fitness trail – ADA compliant

===River access===
* Metal Ford is accessible from the Natchez Trace Parkway about south of Tennessee State Route 20.

<text>Sigmund Schining ein Ringeck (Sigmund ain Ringeck, Sigmund Amring, Sigmund Einring, Sigmund Schining) was a German fencing master. While the meaning of the surname &quot;Schining&quot; is uncertain, the suffix &quot;ain Ringeck&quot; may indicate that he came from the Rhineland region of south-western Germany. He is named in the text of his treatise as &quot;Schirmaister&quot; to one Duke Albrecht, Count Palatine of Rhine and Duke of Bavaria. Other than this, the only thing that can be determined about his life is that his renown as a master was sufficient for Paulus Kal to include him on his memorial to the deceased masters of the Society of Liechtenauer in 1470. Ringeck seems to have authored one of the few complete glosses of the epitome of the grand master Johannes Liechtenauer, making him one of the most important German fencing masters of the 15th century.

The identity of Ringeck&#x27;s patron remains unclear, as four men named Albrecht held the title during the fifteenth century. If it is Albrecht I, who reigned from 1353 to 1404, this would signify that Ringeck was likely a direct associate or student of Liechtenauer. However, it may just as easily have been Albrecht III, who carried the title from 1438 to 1460, making Ringeck a second- or third-generation master carrying on the tradition. Albrecht IV claimed the title in 1460 and thus also could have been Ringeck&#x27;s patron; this seems less likely in light of Ringeck&#x27;s apparent death within that same decade, meaning the master would have had to have penned his treatise in the final few years of his life. In its favor, however, is the fact that Albrecht IV reigned until 1508 and both the Dresden and Glasgow versions of the text were likely created during his time.

== Writings ==

Ringeck is often erroneously credited as the author of the MS Dresden C487. While Ringeck seems to be the author of three of the core texts, glosses of Liechtenauer&#x27;s verses on unarmored longsword fencing, armored fencing, and mounted fencing, the manuscript is an anthology of several treatises by different masters and is currently thought to have been composed between 1504 and 1519 (well after the master&#x27;s lifetime). Likewise, the MS E.1939.65.341, though often described as merely an illustrated version of the Dresden manuscript, is a separate anthology with its own collection of works by various authors and is internally dated to 1508.

While it was not copied nearly as often as the more famous Anonymous gloss (often misattributed to Peter von Danzig), Ringeck&#x27;s gloss nevertheless seems to have had a lasting influence. Not only was it reproduced by Joachim Meyer in 1570 as part of his final manuscript, but in 1539 Hans Medel von Salzburg took it upon himself to create a revised version of Ringeck&#x27;s Bloßfechten gloss, integrating his own commentary in many places.

<text>Paulus Kal was a 15th-century German fencing master. 
According to his own testimony, he was the student of one Hans Stettner, who was in turn an initiate of the tradition of Johannes Liechtenauer. He served as fencing master at three different courts in his career, serving in various military capacities including commanding men in at least three campaigns. Perhaps his most significant legacy is an honor role of deceased masters included in the Bologna (Ms. 1825) and Munich (Cgm 1507) versions of his treatise, which he styled the Society of Liechtenauer (&quot;Geselschaft Liechtenauers&quot;). 
While several of these masters remain unknown, the majority wrote treatises of their own and Kal&#x27;s list stands as an independent confirmation of their connection to the grand master. Kal&#x27;s treatise is also interesting in that it represents the first attempt to give pictorial illustrations for parts of Liechtenauer&#x27;s tradition of fencing.

== Life ==
Little is known of Kal&#x27;s early life, but from 1440 to c. 1449 he served Louis IV of the House of Wittelsbach, Count Palatine of the Rhine. In 1448, while in the count&#x27;s service he participated in the defense Nuremberg, commanding a unit of wheel cannons below the gates. The Nuremberg Council notes from 17 March 1449 mention that he had broken the peace of the city at that time by drawing his weapons.

Kal entered the service of Ludwig IX &quot;the Rich&quot; of the House of Wittelsbach, Duke of Bavaria-Landshut, on 29 September 1450. In 1461, he is mentioned commanding a unit of 12 marksmen. From 1465 to 1475, he seems to have also maintained a secondary occupation as a toll collector in Dingolfing. In November 1468, he participated in military actions on the Castle Saldenburg, which was successfully taken on 4 December. Shortley thereafter, in c. 1470, Paulus Kal created a second, expanded version of his fencing manual for Ludwig IX, the current Cgm 1507 (as well, possibly, as the MS 1825). Kal is listed as a guest at the wedding of Ludwig&#x27;s son George, and continued in the duke&#x27;s service until his death on 18 January 1479.

On 12 February 1480, Paulus Kal entered the service of Sigismund, Archduke of Austria. Kal acted as one of the archduke&#x27;s witnesses at a number of interrogations held on 17 October 1485 in Innsbruck, related to the witch trials being conducted by Heinrich Kramer at that time. This is the final time that Kal&#x27;s name appears in the histories. Several copies of Kal&#x27;s treatise were created during the 1480s and 90s, including the extensive MS KK5126, but it is unknown if he directly commissioned any of them.

In total, Paulus Kal&#x27;s teachings are preserved in at least six manuscripts written between 1440 and 1514. The probable archetype, Cgm 1507, includes brief explanations in German for most devices (many extracted from Liechtenauer&#x27;s record). There are four other text-less versions, and these were probably copied from the 1470 version. A sixth version was sold at auction in Italy during the 20th century as individual leaves; this copy contains single-word captions in Latin or Italian and was likely based on one of the four without text. In addition, Paulus Hector Mair based content in several sections of the Munich version (Cod.icon. 393) of his &quot;Opus Amplissimum de Arte Athletica&quot; on Kal&#x27;s treatise. It appears that the copy he used for this was textless, and so he added his own extensive commentary on the images. The precise set of images Mair drew upon do not appear in any of the six extant manuscripts, which may signify that there was once a seventh copy of Kal&#x27;s work which has since been lost.

<doc id="858559" wikidata="Q5247968" url="?curid=858559" title="Debbie McGee">
<text>Debra Ann McGee (born 31 October 1958) is an English television, radio and stage performer who is best known as the assistant and widow of magician Paul Daniels. McGee is a former ballet dancer and for three years was artistic director of her own ballet company. She presents a Sunday morning show for BBC Radio Berkshire. McGee was a finalist in BBC&#x27;s 2017 &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and a winner of the 2019 Christmas Special, and has been a recurring member of the &quot;Loose Women&quot; panel.

== Early life and magic career ==
McGee was born in 1958 in Kingston upon Thames, to Patrick McGee and Lillian Howes. She has two younger siblings, a sister called Donna and a brother named Robert. When McGee was young her parents ran a corner shop. Later, her father worked for a large manufacturing firm making gold rings and other jewellery.

McGee attended Our Lady Immaculate RC Primary School in Tolworth, followed by Tolworth Girls&#x27; School, a secondary school also in Tolworth. At the age of 16 McGee auditioned for and won a place at the Royal Ballet School. After graduating, she joined the Iranian National Ballet Company in Tehran. Aged 19, she became part of the Corps de Ballet and later a soloist, but her ballet career was brought to an abrupt halt by the Iranian Revolution. She was forced to flee the country and returned to the UK with little in the way of money and possessions. Seeking new work she auditioned for the Bernard Delfont Organisation, which was responsible for a number of big summer resort shows and touring productions.

Delfont found her a job performing on stage with magician Paul Daniels in his 1979 summer show at the Britannia Pier Theatre in Great Yarmouth. She met Daniels on 23 May 1979 at rehearsals for the show, which were held at a church hall in London.

She later joined Dougie Squires&#x27;s &quot;Second Generation&quot; troupe as a dancer, which involved touring Europe with acts including Chris de Burgh and James Last. After winter work in pantomime, McGee joined Daniels again for his 1980 summer season in Bournemouth. She then performed in his London stage show &quot;It&#x27;s Magic&quot;, which opened on 10 December 1980 and which, by the time it closed 14 months later, had become the longest running magic show ever to play in the West End.

McGee achieved national and international fame through television appearances with Daniels. After seeing her on stage in the West End, BBC producer John Fisher asked Debbie to appear in the BBC1 series &quot;The Paul Daniels Magic Show&quot;, which had begun in 1979. That series continued until 1994 and regularly attracted audiences of 15 million in the UK and was sold to 43 countries. Daniels regularly referred to McGee on his TV shows as &quot;The lovely Debbie McGee&quot;, a phrase that entered popular culture as a stereotype for magicians&#x27; assistants. Daniels and McGee were married in Buckinghamshire in April 1988.

In October 1991, McGee was one of the first female magicians to become a member of The Magic Circle, a society for British professional magicians. She celebrated by appearing on TV to perform a trick accompanied by Daniels as her assistant &quot;The Lovely Paul&quot;, who was not allowed to speak during the performance.

McGee was the 2017 winner of the Magic Circle&#x27;s Maskelyne award &quot;for services to British Magic&quot;, the same award that her husband received in 1988.

She has been a recurring member of the &quot;Loose Women&quot; panel.

== Personal life ==
McGee&#x27;s pastimes include golf and she has played in celebrity charity events.

In January 2019, McGee announced that she had overcome the early stages of breast cancer in 2018; after a small surgical procedure she had been given the all-clear.

== Other work ==
=== Dance company ===
In 2000, McGee and Daniels set up &quot;Ballet Imaginaire&quot; to produce ballet shows and tour them around the country. The enterprise was never intended to be financially successful (as acknowledged in &quot;When Louis Met...&quot;) but in the three years it was active it did achieve its stated objective of allowing Debbie to fulfil a lifelong dream of producing ballet and achieving recognition as a dancer&quot;.

=== Radio ===
In 2004 McGee presented &quot;Box Jumpers&quot;, a two-part radio documentary about magician&#x27;s assistants for BBC Radio 4. She works as a presenter for BBC Radio Berkshire, where, since 8 June 2008, she has hosted a regular Sunday morning show from 9 am to noon.

On 12 June 2018, McGee was a guest on the BBC Radio 4 programme &quot;My Teenage Diaries&quot;.

===Television and film===

In 2001, McGee and Daniels were the subjects of an episode of &quot;When Louis Met...&quot;, a documentary filmed by Louis Theroux. The episode, titled &quot;When Louis Met... Paul and Debbie&quot;, was broadcast on BBC Two and subsequently Netflix.

In 2001, McGee appeared in the documentary &quot;Paul Daniels in a Black Hole&quot;, which challenged Daniels to be recognised as a famed magician in the United States within one week.

McGee appeared on comedian Caroline Aherne&#x27;s talk show &quot;The Mrs Merton Show&quot; in 1995; Aherne&#x27;s character Mrs Merton asked McGee &quot;what first attracted you to the millionaire Paul Daniels?&quot;, a joke which a poll later ranked as Britain&#x27;s second-best one-liner. The couple later joked about the quip, with Daniels saying &quot;when Debbie and I got married, I certainly wasn&#x27;t a millionaire and the other funny thing was Caroline had just married a millionaire so we thought that was hysterical&quot;. Calling the continuing popularity of the joke &quot;lovely&quot;, McGee credits the appearance on &quot;Mrs Merton&quot; for kickstarting her own fame, saying &quot;after Mrs Merton people started to really recognise me. It gave us great publicity.&quot;

In October 2004, McGee and her husband appeared on &quot;The Farm&quot;, Five&#x27;s version of the RTÉ show &quot;Celebrity Farm&quot;.

<text>Philippe Douste-Blazy (; born 1 January 1953) is a French United Nations official and former centre-right politician. Over the course of his career, he served as Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations, Special Adviser on Innovative Financing for Development in the UN and chairman of UNITAID.

He previously served as French Minister for Health (1993–1995 and 2004–2005), Minister of Culture (1995–1997) and as Foreign Minister in the cabinet of Dominique de Villepin (2005–2007). He was mayor of Lourdes 1989–2000 and mayor of Toulouse 2001–2004.

Originally a member of the Centre of Social Democrats (CDS), the Christian Democrat component of the Union for French Democracy (UDF) party, he later joined the Union for a Popular Movement.

A cardiologist by profession, he became professor at Toulouse Sciences University in 1988.

==Early years==
Born in Lourdes in the Hautes-Pyrénées, Douste-Blazy studied medicine in Toulouse, where he had his first job in 1976. He then worked as a cardiologist in Lourdes and Toulouse, namely in Purpan&#x27;s hospital from 1986. He then joined the French Society of Cardiology. He became Professor of Medicine at Toulouse Sciences University in 1988. Since 2016, he has also been a visiting professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

==Political career==
===Early beginnings===
A member of the Centre of Social Democrats (CDS), the Christian Democrat component of the Union for French Democracy (UDF), Douste-Blazy entered politics in March 1989, being elected mayor of Lourdes. He was also elected national director of the association of research against elevations of cholesterol.

===Member of the European Parliament, 1989–1993===
In the 1989 European elections, Douste-Blazy was elected Member of the European Parliament in June of the same year. He was then a member of the European People&#x27;s Party.

During his time in parliament, Douste-Blazy served on the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection. In addition to his committee assignments, he was a member of the parliament&#x27;s delegation to the Joint Assembly of the Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific States (ACP countries) and the European Economic Community.

===Minister of Health, 1993–1995===
Elected deputy for Hautes-Pyrénées &quot;département&quot; in March 1993, Douste-Blazy was appointed to the cabinet of Edouard Balladur as Minister-Delegate (a junior minister) at the Ministry for Health.

In May 1994, in his capacity as minister, Douste-Blazy visited Rwanda and refugee camps in neighboring Tanzania to witness the consequences of the genocidal mass slaughter of Tutsi by members of Rwanda&#x27;s Hutu majority government. During his time in office, France approved a bill which prohibited postmenopausal pregnancy, which Douste-Blazy said was &quot;...immoral as well as dangerous to the health of mother and child.&quot;

Douste-Blazy stayed at the ministry until the 1995 presidential election. In March 1994, he was elected at Hautes-Pyrénées&#x27;s General Council. He became general secretary of the CDS in December and Government&#x27;s spokesman one month later.

===Minister of Culture, 1995–1997===
In May 1995, after the election of Jacques Chirac as President of France, a candidacy he was backing, Douste-Blazy was nominated Minister of Culture. In June, he was also re-elected Mayor of Lourdes then, five months later, elected general secretary of Democratic Force, the party which replaced the CDS .

In June 1997, the overwhelming defeat of the Presidential Majority during legislative election made him lose his position as Minister of Culture, but he remained deputy of Hautes-Pyrénées and became president of the UDF parliamentary group at the French National Assembly. During the election campaign he was badly hurt when a mentally unstable man stabbed him in the back as he was campaigning in Lourdes. It turned out that the Minister&#x27;s assailant was an Albanian refugee who had already tried to attack Mr Douste-Blazy in 1992.

At the head of the centrist parliamentary group, he was often opposed to the UDF party leader François Bayrou. Indeed, while the latter advocated the emancipation of the UDF towards its Gaullist allies, Douste-Blazy proposed the union of the right-wing parties behind President Chirac.

===Mayor of Toulouse, 2001–2004===
Seeking one of the country&#x27;s most important municipal seats, Douste-Blazy narrowly won the election for Mayor of Toulouse in 2001, which saw the left making its best showing in decades. Once in office, he had to deal with a reinvigorated political opposition, as well as with the dramatic explosion of the AZF plant in late 2001.

Douste-Blazy supported Jacques Chirac in the two rounds of the 2002 presidential election, in spite of the candidacy of François Bayrou. Consequently, he participated to the unification of some right-wing groups in the Union for a Popular Movement (UMP) and appeared as a possible prime minister. However, once re-elected, President Chirac choose Jean-Pierre Raffarin and Philippe Douste-Blazy refused to resign from its mayoralty to be minister. The same year, he changed of constituency and was elected deputy for Haute-Garonne &quot;département&quot;.

===Minister of Health, 2004–2005===
After the electoral crash of the UMP in the 2004 regional election, Douste-Blazy left its function in Toulouse and returned at the Ministry of Health. His predecessor Jean-François Mattéi was discredited due to his response to the 2003 European heat wave. He was the instigator of a new reform of medical insurances.

===Minister of Foreign Affairs, 2005–2007===
In a government reshuffle following the rejection of the European constitution in 29 May 2005&#x27;s referendum, Douste-Blazy replaced Michel Barnier and became Minister of Foreign Affairs in the government of Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin.

In his capacity as minister, Douste-Blazy summoned Iran&#x27;s ambassador to France in October 2005, demanding an explanation for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad &#x27;s public call for Israel to be &quot;wiped off the map.&quot; He announced France&#x27;s support for the Israeli separation barrier on 25 October 2006. In November 2006, he summoned Israel&#x27;s ambassador to Paris, Daniel Shek to express &quot;serious concern&quot; about violations of a ceasefire that ended the 33-day war between Israel and Hezbollah guerrillas.

During his time in office, France played a central role in international attempts to end the bloodshed in the 2006 Lebanon War. In October 2006, the French National Assembly, despite Douste-Blazy&#x27;s opposition, passed a bill which if approved by the Senate and would make Armenian genocide denial a crime.

Douste-Blazy left the position with the departure of Jacques Chirac from the Presidency in May 2007. He did not run for a new parliamentary term in the 2007 elections.

On 6 November 2007, Douste-Blazy was among the guests invited to the state dinner hosted by President George W. Bush in honor of President Nicolas Sarkozy at the White House.

==United Nations==
While serving as foreign minister of France, Douste-Blazy became chairman of the executive board of UNITAID, the International Drug Purchase Facility hosted by the World Health Organization which France co-founded in 2006.

On 19 February 2008, Douste-Blazy was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon as Special Adviser on Innovative Financing for Development, with the rank of UN Under-Secretary-General. From 2008 until 2009, he was a member of the High Level Taskforce on Innovative International Financing for Health Systems, co-chaired by Gordon Brown and Robert Zoellick. He is also the chairman of the board of the Millennium Foundation for Innovate Finance for Health.

His main responsibilities as the Special Adviser included promoting UNITAID and other sources of innovative financing for the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), advising the United Nations Secretary-General on innovative financing solutions to the implementation of the Monterrey consensus, coordinating with the High-Level Group on the MDGs, and liaising with various UN and non-UN related institutions, such as the main Bretton Woods institutions, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development-Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC), the United Nations Development Group and the Millennium Communication Campaign.

Douste-Blazy was also in charge of organizing the first World Conference of Non-Governmental Donors, with a special focus on the financing for development provided by citizens, local and regional authorities, foundations, non-governmental organizations, economic and social representatives, faith groups and the private sector. It is hoped that these innovative sources of funding could compensate the insufficient official development assistance in achieving the Millennium Development Goals.

Ahead of the 2012 presidential elections, Douste-Blazy announced in January 2012 that he no longer supported Nicolas Sarkozy and instead was lending his support to centrist candidate François Bayrou.

<text>Vesselina Kasarova (; born 18 July 1965) is a Bulgarian operatic mezzo-soprano.

==Early life and education==
Kasarova was born in the central Bulgarian town of Stara Zagora. Under the communist regime she studied Russian as a second language and had an early start in music education. She started taking piano lessons at the Pionerski Dom at age 4 (in 1970) and enrolled at Hristina Morfova School of Music and Performing Arts (normal studies in the morning, and music in the afternoon) in her native town in 1979. As she studied piano and worked as accompanist at recitals, Kasarova became so drawn to the voice as a musical instrument that upon earning her concert pianist diploma in 1987, she switched to study singing under Ressa Koleva at Bulgarian State Music Academy in Sofia, focusing on the works of Mozart and Rossini. Kasarova gave her first singing performance in her native town singing &quot;Habanera&quot; from Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot;. She performed at Sofia National Opera while still a student. She performed the part of Rosina in &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; for her graduation exam.

==Singing career==
In 1989, her final year at the Sofia Conservatory, she and 5 other students were sent to a month-long concert tour of France. The artist agent Luisa Lasser-Petrov made a recording of one of her performances which she sent to Herbert von Karajan, who immediately requested to see her in Salzburg and then in Vienna. They met in Salzburg where she was asked to sing &quot;Agnus Dei&quot; from Bach&#x27;s &quot;Mass in B minor&quot;. Karajan wanted to engage her to sing Bach&#x27;s mass with him at the Salzburg Festival the following year, but died shortly after. The Impresario of the Vienna State Opera, Ioan Holender (then jointly directing with Eberhard Wächter) was persuaded by Lasser-Petrov to hear her auditions and immediately offered her a 2 yrs contract at that house to start in 1991-92 season. When she returned to Bulgaria, she took part in another audition at Stara Zagora Opera where she was heard by Christoph Groszer, the impresario of the Zürich Opera. He also immediately engaged her for his company.

After graduation, Kasarova joined the ensemble at Zurich Opera in 1989 and made her professional stage debut in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Götterdämmerung&quot; as the 2nd Norn and Wellgunde. She soon became a local favorite there with the audience appreciative of her unique vocal timbres, expressive intensity, and virtuoso ability. She also entered and won that year&#x27;s Neue Stimmen competition. The competition was sponsored by Bertelsmann, which owns BMG Classics label, leading to her exclusive recording contract.

In 1991, she made her debut at the Salzburg Festival singing 2 concerts in commemoration of Mozart&#x27;s 200th death anniversary and as Annio in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot; under Sir Colin Davis. In that same year she left Zurich to fulfill her contract at the Vienna State Opera debuting in the role of Rosina in Rossini&#x27;s &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot;, and remained with the company for 2 years.

Her international career took flight in Salzburg in 1992 when at short notice, she stood in for Marilyn Horne as &quot;Tancredi&quot; in two concert performances of the Rossini opera. Since then she has been a regular guest at that summer festival, performing in Mozart&#x27;s &quot;La clemenza di Tito&quot;, &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, &quot;Così fan tutte&quot;, &quot;Mitridate&quot;, the Mozart pastiche &quot;Ombra felice&quot;, and Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;La damnation de Faust&quot;. She has also performed at other notable opera festivals such as Bregenz, St. Moritz, Glyndebourne, Munich and Pesaro.

Kasarova initially specialized in Mozart&#x27;s operas and works by bel canto composers such as Rossini, Bellini, and Donizetti. By the mid 2000s she became much sought after in Baroque trouser roles such as Orphée in Gluck&#x27;s &quot;Orphée et Eurydice&quot;, Ruggiero in Händel&#x27;s &quot;Alcina&quot;, and the title role in &quot;Ariodante&quot;. After her first assumption of Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; in 2008, however, her voice has gained more warmth and size as she adds more dramatic roles to her repertoire. When asked about her repertory change in interviews the singer consistently states her intention to keep singing bel canto roles for as long as possible in order to maintain vocal health as she moves toward the heavier roles of French, Verdi &amp; Wagnerian operas.

In 2003 Kasarova collaborated with the Bulgarian composer Krassimir Kyurkchiyski to produce the CD &#x27;Bulgarian Soul&#x27;. She sings with the Cosmic Voices from Bulgaria and the Sofia Soloists Orchestra in this compilation of Bulgarian folk songs. &quot;Many people don&#x27;t know my native land. I would like them to discover the Bulgarian soul,&quot; the singer commented. She hosted Deutsche Welle&#x27;s Euromaxx television series &quot;Vesselina Kasarova: Bulgarian Encounters&quot;, introducing European audiences to her native Bulgaria.

The versatile singer spends her time between performances giving master classes, and, in March 2012, published her first book, &quot;Ich singe mit Leib und Seele&quot; (I Sing With Heart And Soul), with music critic Dr. Mariane Zelger-Vogt.

<text>The Loosahatchie River is a stream in southwestern Tennessee. Except for a few miles near its head, its mouth, and near the middle of its length, it has been entirely channelized, as have its major tributaries, for agriculture purposes. Its drainage basin was once the site of extensive cotton plantings, which have been greatly diminished in recent decades by extensive urbanization of the area.

The Loosahatchie rises in the westernmost part of Hardeman County, Tennessee, and flows largely east to west throughout its length. It enters Fayette County, Tennessee, flowing through Somerville, and is crossed west of there by Interstate 40 in the only unchannelized portion of its midcourse. It then flows into Shelby County. Its mouth is slightly north of the Memphis suburb of Frayser. It meets the Mississippi north of the mouth of the Wolf River near Mud Island. Slightly downstream from its mouth in the main Mississippi channel is the Loosahatchie Bar, which is named for it.

The name &quot;Loosahatchie River&quot; is partially redundant—the word &quot;hatchie&quot; is one of many words for &quot;river&quot; in several Muskogean languages native to the Southeast.

<text>The US Open men&#x27;s singles championship is an annual tennis tournament that is part of the US Open and was established in 1881. It is played on outdoor hard courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows – Corona Park, New York City, United States. The US Open is played during a two-week period in late August and early September, and has been chronologically the last of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the tennis season since 1987. Newport (1881–1914), Forest Hills (1915–1920, 1924–1977), and Philadelphia (1921–1923) held the event before it settled in 1978 at the USTA National Tennis Center, now the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center, in New York City. The inaugural tournament, in 1881, was reserved for United States National Lawn Tennis Association (USNLTA) club members, before the championships opened to international competitors in 1882. The USTA is the national body that organizes this event.

==History==
The men&#x27;s singles&#x27; rules have undergone several changes since the first edition. From 1884 to 1911, the event started with a knockout phase, the All-Comers singles, whose winner faced the defending champion in a challenge round. The All-Comers winner was awarded the title six times (1888, 1893, 1898, 1901, 1904, 1907) in the absence of the previous year&#x27;s champion. The challenge round system was abolished with the 1912 edition. From 1908 to 1914, when the championships were held at Newport, men&#x27;s singles draws had exceeded 128 players, but when the event moved to Forest Hills in 1915 entries would be &quot;submitted by clubs, thereby making the clubs weed out mediocre players. Furthermore, the entry fee would be set high enough to prevent cheapskates from entering just to get a seat at the tournament at a lower price and then defaulting&quot;. Since 1881, all matches but the All-Comers final and the challenge round were played as the best-of-three sets, before the event switched to best-of-five for all rounds in 1886. Best-two-out-of-three-sets matches were reintroduced for early rounds in 1917, from 1943 to 1945, and from 1975 to 1978. Before 1884, the winner of the next game at five-games–all took the set in every match except the All-Comers final and the challenge round, which were won by the player who had at least six games and at least two games more than his opponent. This advantage format was introduced for the final sets of early rounds in 1884, and used for all sets in all rounds from 1887 to 1969. The tie-break system was introduced in 1970 for all sets, in its best-of-nine points sudden death version until 1974, and in its best-of-13 points lingering death version since 1975. In addition, the US Open was the first slam to have a fifth set tie-break.

The court surface changed twice, from grass (1881–1974), to Har-Tru clay (1975–1977), to DecoTurf hard courts, since 1978. The only man to win on all three surfaces, which are grass, Har-Tru clay, and DecoTurf hard was Jimmy Connors.

The champion receives a full-size replica of the event&#x27;s trophy engraved with his name. In 2010, the winner received prize money of US$1,700,000. A bonus pool of $1,000,000 is also to US Open champions who have clinched the first place of the US Open Series.

In the U.S. National Championships, Richard Sears (1881–1887), William Larned (1901–1902, 1907–1911) and Bill Tilden (1920–1925, 1929) hold the record for most titles in the men&#x27;s singles, with seven victories each. Four of Sears&#x27; wins and all of Larned&#x27;s, came in a time when the tournament used a challenge round format, and they won respectively only three times and twice after going through a complete draw. Sears also holds the all-time record for most consecutive titles, with seven from (1881 to 1887); the first win came when the event was closed to foreign participants. Without the challenge round, the record stands at six, and is held by Tilden (1920–1925).

During the US Open, since the inclusion of the professional tennis players, Jimmy Connors (1974, 1976, 1978, 1982–1983), Pete Sampras (1990, 1993, 1995–1996, 2002), and Roger Federer (2004–2008) have won the most championships, with five titles. Federer has had the most consecutive wins, with five (2004–2008).

<text>The Taiwan Esperanto Association was a Taiwanese society founded to promote Esperanto. It was active in Taiwan under Japanese rule, notably Taipei, during the 1920s and 1930s. Its predecessor was the Japan Esperanto Association, Taiwan Branch, founded in 1913 by Kodama Shirō (児玉四郎). (The new Tajvana Esperantista Asocio, founded 1990, is historically unrelated.) The society exchanged its official monthly publication, &quot;La Verda Ombro&quot; (&quot;The Green Shade&quot;; 1919-1924), with many similar-minded societies overseas. The well-known political activist Ren Onkyō (連 温卿) was the main editor.

In the early 1930s, the society was active in internationalist politics unrelated to Esperanto promotion. In 1932, for example, it attempted to publish an article in a leading paper condemning Japan&#x27;s invasion of Manchuria; the article was censored by the Japanese authorities. In the following year it took part in an alliance to protest Adolf Hitler.

<doc id="858575" wikidata="Q161687" url="?curid=858575" title="Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)">
<text>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince is a 2009 fantasy film directed by David Yates from a screenplay by Steve Kloves. It is based on the 2005 novel &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; by J. K. Rowling. It is the sequel to &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; (2007) and the sixth instalment in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series. It stars Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry&#x27;s best friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger respectively. The story follows Harry&#x27;s sixth year at Hogwarts as he receives a mysterious textbook, falls in love, and attempts to retrieve a memory that holds the key to Lord Voldemort&#x27;s downfall.

Filming began on 24 September 2007, leading to the film&#x27;s worldwide cinematic release on 15 July 2009. With an estimated budget of $250 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made and the most expensive film in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series.

&quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; was released in 2D cinemas and IMAX formats in the United Kingdom and the United States on 15 July, by Warner Bros. Pictures. The film received critical acclaim. It was a major commercial success, breaking the record for the biggest single-day worldwide gross with $104 million. In five days, the film made $394 million, breaking the record for highest worldwide five-day opening. With a total gross of $941 million, it is the second-highest-grossing film of 2009. The film was nominated for many awards, including the Academy Award for Best Cinematography and the BAFTA Award for Best Production Design and Best Special Visual Effects.

It was followed by &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot; in 2010.

==Plot==

Lord Voldemort tightens his grip on the wizarding and Muggle worlds: his Death Eaters kidnap Mr Ollivander, a Wand maker and destroy London&#x27;s Millennium Bridge. With Lucius Malfoy incarcerated in Azkaban, Voldemort chooses his son, Draco Malfoy, to carry out a secret mission at Hogwarts. Draco&#x27;s mother, Narcissa, and aunt Bellatrix Lestrange seek out Severus Snape, who gains their confidence by claiming he is a mole within the Order of the Phoenix. Snape makes an Unbreakable Vow with Narcissa to protect Draco and fulfil his task should he fail.

Harry Potter accompanies Albus Dumbledore to persuade former Potions professor Horace Slughorn to return to Hogwarts. Then, at the Burrow, Harry reunites with his best friends Ron and Hermione. In Diagon Alley, they see Draco and Narcissa Malfoy, and follow them into Knockturn Alley. The pair meet with Death Eaters, including the werewolf Fenrir Greyback, at Borgin &amp; Burke&#x27;s. When Harry believes Draco is now a Death Eater, Ron and Hermione are sceptical. On the Hogwarts Express, Harry sneaks into the Slytherin carriage wearing his Invisibility Cloak to spy on Malfoy. Malfoy notices and petrifies Harry, leaving him on the train. Luna Lovegood finds him and counters Draco&#x27;s spell.

At Hogwarts, Harry discovers that his used Potions textbook is filled with helpful notes and spells added by the &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;. Using it, Harry excels in class, impressing Slughorn, who awards him a Liquid Luck potion. Ron makes the Gryffindor Quidditch team as Keeper and begins dating Lavender Brown, upsetting Hermione, who harbours feelings for him. Harry consoles Hermione while acknowledging his own feelings for Ginny Weasley. Harry spends Christmas with the Weasleys. His suspicions about Draco are dismissed by the Order, but Arthur Weasley reveals that the Malfoys may be interested in a Vanishing Cabinet at Borgin &amp; Burke&#x27;s. Bellatrix and Greyback attack and destroy the Burrow.

At Hogwarts, Dumbledore asks Harry to retrieve Slughorn&#x27;s memory of a young Voldemort. Slughorn has resisted giving an accurate memory. After Ron accidentally ingests a love potion intended for Harry, Harry takes him to Slughorn for a cure. After curing Ron, Slughorn offers both boys some mead, a gift to Dumbledore. Ron is poisoned upon sipping it, and Harry&#x27;s quick thinking saves him. While recovering in the infirmary, Ron murmurs Hermione&#x27;s name, causing Lavender to end their relationship. Harry confronts Draco about the poisoned mead and also a cursed necklace that nearly killed Katie Bell. A duel erupts, and Harry uses one of the Half-Blood Prince&#x27;s curses that severely injures Malfoy, and he is only saved by Snape. Fearing the book contains Dark Magic, Ginny persuades Harry to hide it in the Room of Requirement, where they share their first kiss.

Harry uses his Liquid Luck potion in Hagrid&#x27;s hut to convince the reluctant Slughorn to surrender the memory Dumbledore needs. Viewing it in the Pensieve, Dumbledore and Harry learn Voldemort sought information about Horcruxes, magical objects containing pieces of a wizard&#x27;s soul for immortality. Dumbledore surmises Voldemort divided his soul into six Horcruxes, two of which have been destroyed: Tom Riddle&#x27;s diary and Marvolo Gaunt&#x27;s ring. They travel to a cave where Harry aids Dumbledore in drinking a potion that hides another Horcrux, Slytherin&#x27;s locket.

A weakened Dumbledore defends them from Inferi by creating a ring of fire, and apparates them back to Hogwarts, where Bellatrix, Greyback, and other Death Eaters have entered through the Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement that Draco has secretly connected to one in Knockturn Alley. As Harry hides, Draco appears and disarms the headmaster, revealing Voldemort chose him to kill Dumbledore. Draco hesitates; Snape, however, arrives and kills Dumbledore, blasting him off the Astronomy Tower. As the Death Eaters escape, Harry attacks Snape, but fails, and he reveals to Harry that he is the Half-Blood Prince.

As Hogwarts students and staff mourn Dumbledore&#x27;s death, Harry tells Ron and Hermione that the locket is fake and contains a message from &quot;R.A.B.&quot;, who stole the real Horcrux intending to destroy it. Harry, Ron and Hermione agree to forgo their final Hogwarts year to hunt for the remaining Horcruxes.

==Production==

===Development and casting===
Before David Yates was officially chosen to direct the film, many directors had expressed an interest in taking the helm. Alfonso Cuarón, the director of the third film, stated he &quot;would love to have the opportunity&quot; to return. &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; director Mike Newell declined a spot to direct the fifth film, and was not approached for this film. Guillermo del Toro turned down the chance to direct the film in order to direct &quot;Hellboy II: The Golden Army&quot;. Terry Gilliam was Rowling&#x27;s personal choice to direct &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;. When asked whether he would consider directing a later film, Gilliam said, &quot;Warner Bros. had their chance the first time around, and they blew it.&quot; Yates was still working on &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; when he was approached to direct &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;. The producers were happy with his direction, and was asked to start pre-production during the former&#x27;s marketing.

Radcliffe and Grint were initially hesitant to continue, but agreed to reprise their roles. Emma Watson considered not returning for the film, citing fear of being typecast, but eventually decided that &quot;the pluses outweighed the minuses&quot; and could not bear to see anyone else play Hermione. Nicholas Hooper returned to compose the score; he included a reworking of John Williams&#x27;s &quot;Hedwig&#x27;s Theme&quot;, which has recurred in all films. Other members like costume designer Jany Temime, visual effects supervisor Tim Burke, creature and make-up effects designer Nick Dudman, and special effects supervisor John Richardson continued for this film. Yates and Heyman have noted that some of the events of &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows&quot; influenced the script of &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;.

Christian Coulson, who played the young Tom Riddle in &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot;, expressed interest in returning for the role in flashback sequences; but Yates responded that Coulson was too old (nearing 30), to be playing the role. Thomas James Longley was the original choice to take on the role, but Riddle was ultimately played by Hero Fiennes-Tiffin as a child and Frank Dillane as a teenager. Jamie Campbell Bower was in talks to portray Tom Riddle teenager before Dillan was cast, he would later portray a young Grindelwald in the Deathly Hallows - Part 1. Helen McCrory appears as Narcissa Malfoy, Draco&#x27;s mother and younger sister of Bellatrix. McCrory was originally cast as Bellatrix in &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;, but had to drop out due to pregnancy. Naomi Watts was previously reported as having accepted the role, only for it to be denied by her agency.

Both Clémence Poésy and Chris Rankin, who had played Fleur Delacour and Percy Weasley, respectively, were interested in returning, but did not appear in the film. After Bill Nighy expressed an interest in appearing, Yates confirmed that Nighy would be his first choice for the role of Minister for Magic Rufus Scrimgeour. Scrimgeour&#x27;s character was ultimately cut from the film, but Nighy appeared in his role in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. Bob Hoskins auditioned for the role of Horace Slughorn, but Jim Broadbent ultimately secured the part. Warner Bros and MSN also ran an online &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot; quiz, with the prize being a walk-on part in the &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;.

===Sets===

Stuart Craig, the production designer of the first five films, stayed on to design all the sets in &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;. Several new sets were introduced, including Tom Riddle&#x27;s orphanage, the Astronomy Tower, and the cave. Craig noted that the film used several CGI sets, noticeably the interior of the cave where Harry and Dumbledore both go to hunt Horcruxes. The exterior of the scene was filmed at the Cliffs of Moher in the west of Ireland, the only location to be filmed outside of the United Kingdom throughout the film series. The interior of the cave is made up of geometric crystal formations. Radcliffe said that the scene took three-to-four months to prepare. Some of the Hogwarts sets were taken down after the filming, as they would not be used for the following film.

===Filming===

Before filming began, there was belief that filming might move from the UK, where all previous films were shot. The crew also scouted around Cape Wrath in Scotland, for use in the cave scene. Filming returned to Glen Coe and Glenfinnan, both of which have appeared in the previous films, to preserve the continuity of the landscape.

Following a week of rehearsals, principal photography began on 24 September 2007 and ended on 17 May 2008. Radcliffe, Gambon and Broadbent started shooting in late September 2007. Other cast members started much later: Grint did not begin until November 2007; Watson started in December 2007, Rickman and Leung in January 2008, and Bonham Carter in February 2008.

On the weekend of 6 October 2007, the crew shot scenes involving the Hogwarts Express in the misty and dewy environment of Fort William, Scotland. A series of night scenes were filmed in the village of Lacock and the cloisters at Lacock Abbey for three nights starting 25 October 2007. Filming took place from 5 pm to 5 am daily, and residents of the street were asked to black out their windows with dark blinds. On set reports indicated that the main scene filmed was Harry and Dumbledore&#x27;s visit to Slughorn&#x27;s house. Further filming took place in Surbiton railway station in October 2007, at Gloucester Cathedral, where the first and second films were shot, in February 2008, and at the Millennium Bridge in London in March 2008.

In the previous films, the scenes showing Hogwarts Express on its way to the wizarding school were typically shot in Scotland. However, since the screenplay required a snowy atmosphere for the train to go through and it did not snow during planned production dates, the crew decided to film these scenes in Rauma Line, Norway. This included the scene where Harry and Ron are talking about the Unbreakable Vow Snape had to swear to as the train goes through a snowy plot. The filming location in Norway is located in Northern Norway, close to the village of Bjorli.

===Cinematography===
Due to cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel&#x27;s use of de-focussing and soft wipes in the digital grade, Warner Bros. asked director David Yates to add more colours to the film. Yates did not want to lose the &quot;very European look&quot; of the film, but after retouching the picture, he said, &quot;It&#x27;s not what you wanted, but we&#x27;re happy with it.&quot; After five minutes of watching the film, the studio were pleased with the changes. In an interview with &quot;Total Film&quot;, Yates said that the choice of angles, the extreme close-ups, and the pacing of the scenes made the film &quot;incredibly rich&quot;.

One of the major challenges for Delbonnel was the lighting of the film. In an interview with the Academy, Delbonnel said that he did not want to change the lighting effects used in the previous films, and finally decided to give it a darker, moody variation of grey. Yates and the other producers supported this new effect, and he went ahead with it. In reference to the cave scene, Delbonnel said, &quot;I wanted to have some kind of &#x27;dynamism&#x27; with the light. I thought it could be interesting and more dramatic if the light was floating, circling above the characters faces: sometimes lighting them, sometimes hiding them in a very random and unpredictable way.&quot;

===Visual effects===
The opening scenes of the Death Eaters&#x27; attack on Diagon Alley and London was created by Double Negative, led by VFX supervisor Paul Franklin. Double Negative spent six months surveying and documenting the environment around the River Thames and Trafalgar Square to create the swooping views of the city. Double Negative also contributed to the Pensieve sequences, developing complex directed fluid simulations to realise the swirling world of memory and the past.

Tim Burke and Tim Alexander were the visual effects supervisors for the rest of the film. Tim Alexander said that completing the Inferi-attack scene took several months. He said that the scene was much bolder and scarier compared to previous films, and director Yates wanted to avoid making them look like zombies. On differentiating them, he commented, &quot;A lot of it came down to their movement – they don&#x27;t move fast, but they don&#x27;t move really slow or groan and moan. We ended up going with a very realistic style.&quot; He also noted that Inferi are skinnier than zombies, waterlogged and grey.

On Dumbledore&#x27;s ring of fire to combat the Inferi, he added that research was done on molten volcanoes, among other references. He said, &quot;The visual effects team emulated these six fire parameters: heat ripples, smoke, buoyancy, viscosity, opacity, and brightness.&quot; Since the scene was very time-consuming, computer-graphics artist Chris Horvath spent eight months finding a faster way to conjure the flames. Eventually, the final effect would look as though someone sprayed propane and then lit it.

===Music===

The film&#x27;s score was composed by Nicholas Hooper, who also composed the music for &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot;. The soundtrack was released on an Audio CD format on 14 July 2009, a day before the film was released in cinemas.

The album debuted at number twenty-nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, thus making it the highest-charting soundtrack among all the six movie soundtracks released. It was nominated for the 2010 Grammy Award for &quot;Best Score Soundtrack Album For Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media&quot;.

==Differences from the book==

&quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; added or changed several events in the literary canon. The book begins with a scene involving the Muggle Prime Minister. Yates and his crew debated over this scene, as well as the inclusion of Rufus Scrimgeour. They eventually revised the start of the film to instead include events described, but not seen in the book. Yates thought it would give the audience a feel for what the Death Eaters were doing if they showed the collapse of the Millennium Bridge rather than simply describe it (as was done with the Brockdale Bridge in the book). As with &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot;, the Dursleys were cut, which Steve Kloves did to &quot;break the pattern&quot;. Further background of Tom Riddle was removed, such as the Gaunts, because they felt it more important to concentrate on Riddle as a young boy, and an additional action scene at the Burrow was added to keep with the tone of the franchise. Yates felt that they needed &quot;an injection of jeopardy and danger&quot;, and that without it, there was too much comedy and lightness. A small battle scene at Hogwarts which happened during the end of the book was also cut; Heyman commented that it was removed to &quot;[avoid] repetition&quot; with the forthcoming adaptation of the Battle of Hogwarts in &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;. Dumbledore&#x27;s funeral was removed as it was believed that it did not fit with the rest of the film.

==Distribution==

===Marketing===
Warner Bros. spent an estimated $155 million to market and distribute the film. The special-edition two-disc DVD for &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; contained two sneak peeks of the film, while the US edition included an additional clip. The first teaser for the film, with a length of 15-seconds, was shown alongside the IMAX release of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. The first full-length US teaser trailer was released on 29 July on AOL&#x27;s Moviefone website. this trailer was shown alongside &quot;Star Wars: The Clone Wars&quot; in August 2008. An international teaser was released on 26 October and another teaser trailer was released later. Another trailer was screened on the Japanese TV station Fuji TV during a screening of &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; on 18 January 2009. Scenes from the film were aired during ABC Family&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot; marathon, which took place between 5 and 7 December 2008. On 5 February 2009, the first three promotional teaser posters were released, featuring Dumbledore and Harry. On 5 March and 16 April 2009, new trailers were released by Warner Bros.

As with the previous films, EA Games produced a video game based on the film. On 10 March 2009, it was announced that there would be a video game soundtrack, which was released on 17 March 2009. On 27 March, six character posters were released: Harry, Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, Draco and Snape. A Japanese version of the international trailer was released, alongside the original one on 10 April. On 8 May, The CW aired a 30-second TV spot, which focused on the romantic side of the film. On 20 May, first clip from the film was released through &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;″s official website, showing a love-struck Ron. Another clip of the film, showing Dumbledore visiting Tom Riddle&#x27;s orphanage, was released on 31 May 2009, at the MTV Awards.

===Theatrical release===

The film was released in many countries on 15 July 2009. It was originally set to be released on 21 November 2008, but was pushed back by eight months to 17 July, despite being completed. Warner Bros. executive Alan F. Horn noted that the move was meant &quot;to guarantee the studio a major summer blockbuster in 2009,&quot; with other films being delayed due to the 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike. The box-office success of summer WB films &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; and &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; also motivated the decision. An unnamed rival studio executive told &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; that the move was to &quot;stop next year&#x27;s profits from looking seriously underwhelming after the phenomenal success of &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;,&quot; as &quot;they don&#x27;t need the money this year anymore.&quot; Dan Fellman, WB head of distribution, said that the studio had considered the date change for three to four weeks prior to the announcement, but gave it serious consideration a week before they came to their final decision. Three months before its release in July, the date was again changed by 2 days from 17 to 15 July, so it could open on a Wednesday like most tentpole summer movies.

The date change was met with a heavily negative reaction by &quot;Harry Potter&quot; fans, as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; noted: &quot;Petitions were circulating, rumors were flying and angry screeds were being posted on Internet sites within minutes of the Thursday announcement.&quot; The move was mocked by &quot;Entertainment Weekly,&quot; which had &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; on the cover on its &quot;Fall Preview Issue&quot;. Despite each being owned by Time Warner Inc., &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; was unaware of the change until it was publicly announced by WB and noted that readers would now be in possession of a &quot;Dewey Defeats Truman collectible&quot;. Several days after the announcement, Horn released a statement in response to the &quot;large amount of disappointment&quot; expressed by fans of the series. Following the date change, &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot;″s release slot was taken by Summit Entertainment&#x27;s &quot;Twilight&quot; and Walt Disney Pictures&#x27; &quot;Bolt&quot;.

The sixth film was simultaneously released in regular cinemas and IMAX 3D everywhere but the United States, due to a conflicting agreement in which &quot;&quot; was given a four-week window by itself in IMAX in that country. Therefore, the IMAX 3D version of the film was released on 29 July 2009 there. The film had been chosen to be screened at the 2008 Royal Film Performance on 17 November but was not shown. Cinema and Television Benevolent Fund chief executive Peter Hore noted he was &quot;very disappointed&quot; with Warner Bros&#x27; decision.

With a runtime of 153 minutes, &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; is the third-longest film in the series, behind &quot;Chamber of Secrets&quot; (161 minutes) and &quot;Goblet of Fire&quot; (157 minutes).

===Home media===
Like the previous films, a 1-disc and 2-disc special edition for the film was released on Blu-ray as a digital copy and DVD on 7 December 2009 in the United Kingdom, and 8 December 2009 in the United States.
The Blu-ray and DVD include an 11-minute, 38-second feature on the new Wizarding World of Harry Potter mini theme park, which opened on 18 June 2010 at Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida.

==Reception==

===Box office===
With an estimated budget of $250 million, it is one of the most expensive films ever made and the most expensive film in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series. Advance ticket sales on Fandango.com for &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; surpassed advance ticket sales for &quot;Transformers 2&quot; at the same point in sale cycles. It is also in MovieTickets.com&#x27;s top 25 advance sellers of all time.

&quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; broke the then-record for biggest midnight showings, making $22.8 million in 3,000 cinemas; &quot;The Twilight Saga: New Moon&quot; bested this with $26.3 million in November. &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; opened in the same Wednesday slot that &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; did in 2007. The film&#x27;s box office run finished on 17 December 2009.

The film opened in 4,325 cinemas (rising to 4,455 three weeks later, becoming the largest number of cinemas until &quot;The Twilight Saga: Eclipse&quot; surpassed it with the 4,468 cinemas in 2010); and grossed $58.2 million on its opening day at the top of the United States and Canadian box office, the third-highest Wednesday opening of all time behind &quot;&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Saga: Eclipse&quot;. It is also the nineteenth-highest single-day gross of all time and the third-highest for a film in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise behind &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot;″s $91.1 million and &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1&quot;, which made $61.1 million. It earned an additional $46 million overseas for a worldwide total of $104 million, breaking the record for highest single-day worldwide gross, previously held by &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;.
By 20 July, the film had taken in $158.7 million in the US and $236 million from 85 other markets, for a worldwide tally of $394.7 million. This broke the record for biggest-ever worldwide five-day opening, surpassing &quot;Spider-Man 3&quot;″s $381 million. In the US, it surpassed all of its predecessors by a wide margin, achieving the sixth-largest-ever five-day opening in that country. The film held this worldwide record for two years until it was topped by &quot;Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; ($483.2 million). In the UK, the film grossed £19.75 million (equivalent to about $38.13 million), the highest opening for both the series and releases of 2009. At the end of the film&#x27;s US and Canadian box office run, the total ticket sales of the film were $302.3 million; making it the third-most successful film in the franchise, after &quot;Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, as well as the third-highest-grossing film of 2009 in these regions behind &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen&quot;. As with all of the previous films in the franchise, &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; proved to be extremely successful globally with an estimated non-US total gross of $632.1 million, totalling approximately $941.5 million worldwide. This made it the second-highest-grossing film of 2009, behind &quot;Avatar&quot;. It is the fifth-highest-grossing film in the franchise, behind &quot;Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, both parts of &quot;Deathly Hallows&quot;, and &quot;Order of the Phoenix&quot;. It was once the eighth-highest-grossing film of all time.

In South Africa, the film opened with the number-one position, grossing $789,176; it maintained the number-one position during the second week, with a total of $242,336.
In Australia, the film broke records with a debut of $11.5 million. Opening at number one, it maintained a second week at number one with a total of $5.3 million (down 54%), and grossed a total of $24.2 million.
In France, the film debuted at $20.5 million from 949 cinemas. In Japan, the film held the top spot in the box office rankings until the release of &quot;Kamen Rider Decade: All Riders vs. Dai-Shocker&quot;, which took the top spot in its first weekend.

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of based on reviews, with an average rating of . The website&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Dark, thrilling, and occasionally quite funny, &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; is also visually stunning and emotionally satisfying.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 78 out of 100 based on 36 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. The film scored an 87 from professional critics at the Broadcast Film Critics Association; it is the first &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film to receive a Critic&#x27;s Choice certificate. Audiences surveyed by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The first review of the film came three weeks before the official release: Paul Dergarabedian of Hollywood.com ranked the film with &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; film trilogy and called the film a possible Oscar contender. He highly praised the performance of Sir Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman and Daniel Radcliffe. He commented, &quot;&quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; is a tour-de-force that combines style and substance, special effects and heart and most importantly great performances from all of the actors young and not-so-young&quot;. Another early review came from Devin Faraci of the UK tabloid Chud.com, who called the film the best in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; series, and also in the year.

Andrew Pulver of &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave a positive review, scoring it 3.5 out of 5 stars. Todd McCarthy of the trade magazine &quot;Variety&quot; said that the film is &quot;dazzlingly well made&quot; and &quot;less fanciful than the previous entries&quot;. He praised Alan Rickman&#x27;s performance, described Helena Bonham Carter as &quot;mesmerising&quot;, and Jim Broadbent as a &quot;grand eccentric old professor&quot;. BBC News&#x27;s Tim Masters praised the film&#x27;s cinematography, visual effects, production design, acting and darker plotline. &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; Kirk Honeycutt felt that the film&#x27;s first half is &quot;jerky and explosive&quot;, but in the second half, the film finds better footing. He also praised Nicholas Hooper&#x27;s composition, Bruno Delbonnel&#x27;s cinematography, and Stuart Craig&#x27;s set design. Chris Tilly of &quot;IGN UK&quot; commented on the length of the film, saying &quot;while on occasion it drags, the 153-minute run-time never feels too long, thanks in no small part to the astonishing visuals and (largely) marvellous performances,&quot; and felt that it was the best film in the series.

However, Dave Golder of &quot;SFX Magazine&quot; found some aspects of the film to be a disappointment, mainly due to the large number of opportunities the director and screenwriter had sacrificed to devote &quot;huge swathes of the film to subplots of Harry and his chums&#x27; teenage romances,&quot; but nevertheless found the film to be a large enjoyment, praising the performances of Broadbent and Rickman. &quot;Screen Daily&quot; commented, &quot;David Yates and his team struggle to whip J.K. Rowling’s 608-page tome into a consistently thrilling cinematic experience&quot;, but praised the shooting of some scenes and Bonham Carter&#x27;s acting. David Stratton, of &quot;Margaret and David at the Movies&quot;, gave the film a 2.5 out of a possible 5 stars, remarking, &quot;For non-readers [of the Harry Potter series] the films are now borderline incomprehensible&quot;, and that the film was &quot;a little tedious&quot; and &quot;generally less interesting visually than its predecessors.&quot; He, however, praised the acting of Gambon and Broadbent.

===Accolades===
The film was nominated for BAFTA Awards in Production Design and Visual Effects, and was in the longlists for five other categories, including Best Supporting Actor for Alan Rickman. Bruno Delbonnel was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Cinematography at the 82nd Academy Awards. The film was also one of the final seven contenders for Best Visual Effects. &quot;Half-Blood Prince&quot; is the only film in the series to be nominated for the Best Cinematography accolade at the Academy Awards.

<text>Borodino (, ) is a village in Mozhaysky District of Moscow Oblast, Russia, located west of Mozhaysk.

The village is famous as the location of the Battle of Borodino that took place on 7 September 1812 as part of the Napoleonic Wars during the French invasion of Russia. The Borodino Battlefield () is now part of the State Borodino War and History Museum and Reserve. The reserved area is ; the area of the protected zone is .

==History==
Archaeological evidence suggests that the area around Borodino was settled around 500 BC by the Finnish, and then Slavic tribes. The well-preserved earthworks of a fort dating from about 200 BC, located near the village of , represent the earliest known military-historical construction in the Borodino area. However, the earliest written mention of the village of Borodino that has been found was in the 17th century.

Borodino&#x27;s lands were attached to the Moscow principality at the beginning of the 14th century and were at the boundary with Lithuanian territory along the old Smolensk road. The peasants farming the land cultivated winter rye, spring barley, oats, summer wheat, flax, hemp, and buckwheat. The farms were assessed as &quot;fair&quot; to &quot;average&quot;. Women, except for fieldwork, were engaged in spinning flax and wool, weaving and knitting, for home use. During the Time of Troubles the area suffered from bandits and raiders, and even until the end of the 18th century much of the area was still abandoned.

According to some reports the hamlet of Borodino was first mentioned in the Mozhayskie scribe books in 1601. During the Time of Troubles the village was described as having a &quot;churchyard on the Tsar&#x27;s sovereign land on the Voinka River (&quot;река Воинка&quot;) with the Church of the Exaltation of the Cross of the Lord and the chapel of St. Nicholas&quot;, and further &quot;in the church, images and candles and books and every church structure had secular parishioners&quot;.

Prior to the construction of its own church at Borodino, people from the area were parishioners of the church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, which was on the other side of the Kolocha River at the confluence of the Stonets and Prudki creeks. This church with a chapel (the lower church) in honour of St. Nicholas, Archbishop of Myra was destroyed in the Time of Troubles, probably in 1609. After that, the locals were parishioners in the church of the Assumption in the village Semenov also having a lower chapel of St. Nicholas. There is no further history of this church following the middle of the 17th century.

During the 1941 Battle of Moscow, the field was the place of a severe clash between the Soviet and German forces.

<text>Raffles Institution (RI) is an independent educational institution in Singapore. Founded in 1823, it is the oldest school in the country. It provides secondary education for boys only from Year 1 to Year 4, and pre-university education for both boys and girls in Year 5 and Year 6. Since 2007, RI and its affiliated school Raffles Girls&#x27; School have been offering the six-year Raffles Programme, which allows students to skip the Singapore-Cambridge GCE O-Level examinations and proceed to take the Singapore-Cambridge GCE A-Level examinations at the end of Year 6.

RI is notable for having produced 96 President&#x27;s Scholars, three presidents, two prime ministers, four speakers of Parliament, several Cabinet ministers and Members of Parliament, as well as many chief executive officers of statutory boards, agencies and state-owned companies. Its alumni body, the Old Rafflesians Association (ORA), includes former Prime Ministers Lee Kuan Yew and Goh Chok Tong, as well as former Presidents Yusof Ishak, Benjamin Sheares and Wee Kim Wee.

RI has one of the highest admission rates to the elite universities of the world such as the Ivy League and Oxbridge. It had the highest number of admissions to the University of Cambridge, with 48 students receiving offers in the 2022 admissions cycle, while 52 were accepted for Oxford and Cambridge combined in 2021, and 77 in 2022 (2nd highest of all schools).

== History ==
===Foundation===
RI was founded by Stamford Raffles, who proposed the establishment of &quot;the Institution&quot; or &quot;Singapore Institution&quot; at a meeting he convened on 1 April 1823. Raffles wanted to establish a college for the people of Singapore since the founding of the colony, and wrote on 12 January 1823 that a site for a planned college had been selected. His intention was to provide education for the children of local leaders in the new British colony of Singapore as well as the company&#x27;s employees and others who wished to learn the local languages. Another objective was to &quot;collect the scattered literature and traditions of the country&quot; so that the most important may be published and circulated. Raffles referred to the plan as his &quot;last public act&quot;; by setting up the Institution, he hoped it that it could, through its generations of alumni, serve as &quot;the means of civilising and bettering the conditions of millions&quot; beyond Singapore. Those involved in the plan for the Institution included Reverend Robert Morrison, Sophia Raffles, William Farquhar, and William Marsden. It was initially suggested that the Institution should merge with the Anglo-Chinese College founded by Morrison in Malacca, but this plan did not materialise. Raffles contributed S$2,000, secured a grant of S$4,000 from the British East India Company and, together with subscriptions from other individuals, raised funds totalling S$17,495 for the project. He drafted the curriculum, and set up the structure for the board of trustees that included William Wilberforce.

The original building of RI was sited on Bras Basah Road and it was designed by engineer Philip Jackson. Raffles laid the foundation stone of the building on 5 June 1823, a few days before he left Singapore for the last time on 9 June. No classes were held while the building was under construction, but the project stalled and the building was left unfinished for some time. Raffles&#x27; vision was also not shared by John Crawfurd, the British Resident of Singapore, who felt the scale of the project excessive, and that the government should focus its efforts on elementary education instead. In 1835, a group of European merchants raised money for the Raffles Monument Fund to commemorate Raffles&#x27; contribution to Singapore, and proposed that it should be used to complete the Institution. George Drumgoole Coleman was then hired to finish and extend the original building by Jackson.

====Early years====
On 1 August 1834, Reverend F. J. Darrah opened the Singapore Free School with 46 boys, which quickly grew to nearly 80. When the building for the Institution was completed in 1837, the school applied to occupy the building, a proposal the trustees of the Institution accepted. The Singapore Free School moved into the building in December 1837, and became the Institution Free School. It was, however, established as an elementary school rather than the college that Raffles had initially intended. Originally the school offered classes in Malay, Chinese and English, but the Malay classes soon closed in 1842 due to low enrolment, and it would eventually become an English-medium school. In May 1839, the first wing extension was completed, and the second at the end of 1841. In 1856, the Singapore Institution Free School was renamed Singapore Institution.

In the 1860s, the school gradually turned into a high school. In 1868, the school was renamed Raffles Institution in honour of its founder. The most significant headmasters of the period were J. B. Bayley and R. W. Hullett, who oversaw the transition and ran the school for a cumulative period of 50 years.

The school is Singapore&#x27;s first institution to enrol girls, with 11 pupils accepted in 1844. In 1879, the girls&#x27; wing of the school was established as a separate but affiliated school, Raffles Girls&#x27; School.

===Relocation===
In March 1972, the school moved to Grange Road. The old building was demolished and replaced by Raffles City Shopping Centre. The Bras Basah campus&#x27;s library building is featured on the S$2 paper and polymer note in Singapore currency.

In 1984, RI became one of two schools selected by the Ministry of Education to pilot the Gifted Education Programme to cater to intellectually gifted students.

In 1990, the school moved again, this time from Grange Road to a new campus at Bishan, then a recently created new town.

===Raffles Junior College===
In 1982, Raffles Junior College (RJC) was established at Paterson Road to take over the school&#x27;s burgeoning pre-university enrolment. It subsequently moved to Mount Sinai Road in 1984.

In 2004, the six-year Raffles Programme was offered to Secondary 1 to 3 students. It allows RI students to skip the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examinations, which students would previously sit for at the end of Year 4. Instead, they move on directly to RJC for Years 5 and 6 and sit for the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations at the end of Year 6. This frees up time which students would otherwise spend on preparing for the O Level examinations, allowing them to spend more time engaging in enrichment and co-curricular or passion-driven activities. The curriculum serves to &quot;seek to nurture the best and brightest into men and women of scholarship who will be leaders of distinction, committed to excellence and service in the interest of the community and nation.&quot; This subsequently led to the merging of RI&#x27;s GEP and Special/Express streams to form a single Raffles Programme stream, and the establishment of its in-house academic talent development programme, Raffles Academy, catering to exceptionally gifted students via subject-specific pullout classes from Year 3 onwards, in 2007.

In 2005, RJC, along with Hwa Chong Junior College, became one of the first junior colleges in Singapore to attain independent status. RJC moved to its new Bishan campus adjacent to RI at the start of the 2005 school year, after attaining independent status and becoming the first pre-university institution in Singapore to be awarded the School Excellence Award.

In 2009, RI and RJC re-integrated to form a single institution under the name &quot;Raffles Institution&quot; to facilitate the running of the Raffles Programme and better align processes and curriculum.

== School identity and culture ==
RI is a member of various academic partnerships and alliances, such as the G30 Schools and Winchester Network. It also co-founded the Global Alliance of Leading-Edge Schools.

=== Motto ===
The school motto - &quot;Auspicium Melioris Aevi&quot; - comes from the coat of arms of its founder, Stamford Raffles. The official translation by the school is &quot;Hope of a Better Age&quot;.

=== Houses ===
The five houses, three of them named after former headmasters, are Bayley, Buckley, Hullett, Moor and Morrison, represented by the colours yellow, green, black, red and blue respectively.
: C. B. Buckley was the Secretary to the Board of Trustees of Raffles Institution.
 J. B. Bayley was a Headmaster who &quot;raised Raffles Institution to a large and flourishing establishment&quot;, as recorded by the board of trustees.
: J. H. Moor was the first Headmaster of the school, whose 4th great-grandson is Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada.
: Reverend Robert Morrison was the co-founder of Raffles Institution.
: R.W. Hullett was Raffles Institution&#x27;s longest-serving Headmaster (31 years).
Year 1 students are sorted into houses by class. In the early years of RI&#x27;s history, there were ten houses, including a sixth Philips house (purple), later disbanded. House allocations used to be student-based, instead of class-based. Each House is led by a House Captain, a Year 4 student, who carries out his role along with the respective House Committee. The Houses participate in inter-house tournaments and activities, notably including the annual Inter-House Sports Carnival, Dramafeste and the Inter-House Debate tournament, with points earned from each activity contributing to the House Championship which is awarded at the end of the school year.

Students of the college section were divided into five Houses, the name of which is an amalgamation of its counterparts in RI and RGS:
: Buckle-Buckley
: Bayley-Waddle
: Hadley-Hullett
: Moor-Tarbet 
: Morrison-Richardson

=== Uniform ===
The school uniform from Years 1 to 4 is all-white, including a white short-sleeved shirt with the school badge at the top-right corner of the shirt pocket. Lower secondary students (Years 1 and 2) wear white short trousers and white socks. From Year 3 onwards, students may continue in short pants or opt for white long trousers. Shoes are white-based for all students. Year 3 and 4 prefects wear formal black shoes, except for Physical Education lessons, where they wear appropriate shoes. School ties are worn on formal occasions. Teachers wear a formal gown for special occasions. The uniform for male students in Years 5 and 6 is identical to that worn by students in Years 3 and 4. The uniform for female students in Years 5 and 6 consists of a white blouse and a dark green pleated skirt.

=== Discipline ===
In his memoir &quot;The Singapore Story&quot;, Lee Kuan Yew mentioned that he was caned by the headmaster D. W. McLeod for chronic tardiness when he attended RI in the 1930s. In 1956, a former RI prefect also wrote that during his time there, &quot;boys were caned on their bottoms for even winking at the girls. We did have very good discipline in our time and the boys became good citizens, lawyers, doctors, etc.&quot;

== Curriculum and student activities ==

Since 2007, the school has offered the six-year Integrated Programme, which allows students to bypass the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Ordinary Level examinations and take the Singapore-Cambridge GCE Advanced Level examinations at the end of Year 6. Known within the Raffles schools as the Raffles Programme, it is offered jointly with Raffles Girls&#x27; School.

=== Orientation programmes ===
==== Year 1 Orientation Camp ====
The new intake of Year 1 students go through a 3-day orientation camp, involving understanding the school&#x27;s culture and knowing the campus grounds, and various activities to facilitate class bonding, leadership development, etc. Year 4 Peer Support Leaders and the Head and Deputy head prefects guide them through this camp and the rest of the orientation period. At the end of the camp, the first-year students receive their school badges in the Junior Rafflesian Investiture Ceremony (JRIC), which occurs on the Friday of the Orientation Week.

=== Raffles Leadership Programme ===
The Raffles Leadership Programme is an initiative of the Leadership Development Department, aimed at preparing students to take on positions of leadership in school and in life. All Year 3 pupils go through the programme which includes going through the Leadership Challenge Workshop and taking the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator Instrument. It also features a one-term residential component at RI Boarding. The boarding programme started as a trial in 2008 and has now become a full-cohort programme.

Under the Raffles Leadership Programme, Our Year 3 pupils also get to take part in a ten-week residential programme in RI Boarding to learn about independent living skills. The boarding programme was shortened to a seven-week programme in 2019. It can be held in terms 1, 2 or 3.

=== Students&#x27; Council (Year 5-6) ===
The Students&#x27; Council of the Years 5-6 section is divided into a total of eight departments, namely the Welfare Department, the Communications Department, the CCA Department and five House Directorates, which form the EXCO for each of the five houses. Each councillor also takes up one or two of the six functions, which are college events organised by the council: National Day, Teachers&#x27; Day, Grad Night, Open House, Orientation and Council Camp.
Members of the Students&#x27; Council are selected through a college-wide election process. Each batch undergoes a rigorous selection process, which culminates in the Council Investiture. The Students&#x27; Council is headed by a President, who is assisted by his/her executive committee consisting of two vice-presidents, two Secretaries, the three Heads of Departments and the five House Captains. As of October 2024, the school is served by the 44th batch of Student Councillors.

=== Co-curricular activities ===
==== Year 1-4 (Secondary School section) ====
RI offers about 40 co-curricular activities (CCAs), including sports, uniformed groups, performing arts, and clubs and societies.

CCAs are categorised as either core or merit CCAs. Core CCAs comprise all sports, uniformed groups and performing arts, as well as Raffles Debaters while merit CCAs consist of all other clubs and societies. Every student of the school takes up at least one core CCA. Merit CCAs are optional, but students are encouraged to take up at least one merit CCA to supplement their core CCA. Certain merit CCAs, such as the Infocomm Club, however, may substitute for a core CCA instead.

The school&#x27;s sports teams and uniformed groups have earned top places in many national inter-school competitions, doing well in Red Cross Youth, rugby, National Cadet Corps, sailing, floorball, Boys&#x27; Brigade, and cross-country running, among others.

The performing arts groups have also done well in the Singapore Youth Festival, held once every two years, while the clubs and societies have also won awards.

====Year 5-6 (Junior College Section) ====
The Year 5-6 section offers over 70 CCAs, including sports, performing arts, and clubs and societies. Unlike in the first four years of the Raffles Programme, no distinction is made between core and merit CCAs. Students may offer up to two CCAs, no more than one of which may be a sports or performing arts group.

Teams from RI performed well nationally in 2011, with the performing arts groups clinching 15 Golds (including nine with honours) and five Silvers at the biennial Singapore Youth Festival Central Judging and the sports teams winning 32 championship titles as well as 24 Silvers and 11 Bronzes at the National Interschools Sports Championships. The school&#x27;s clubs and societies have also performed excellently in their various national competitions, with Raffles Debaters clinching championship titles and the History and Strategic Affairs Society clinching best school delegation awards at international Model United Nations conferences.

=== Publications ===
The college community is served by the Raffles Press, the school&#x27;s journalism society, which publishes its flagship online student newspaper &quot;Word of Mouth&quot;. The newspaper includes features, op-ed columns, sports reports and concert reviews. In addition, all staff and most students also receive a copy of the &quot;Rafflesian Times&quot;, the school&#x27;s official magazine, from the Communications Department.

The journalism society regularly publishes articles dealing with daily school life, recent assemblies and events as well as wider national issues including Singapore&#x27;s golden jubilee (SG50) and the 2015 Southeast Asian haze.

In 2015, students from the school also started an unofficial satirical publication, &quot;The Waffle Press&quot;, which pokes fun at school events and examinations.

== Boarding ==
Raffles Institution Boarding is housed in a boarding complex consisting of five blocks. These are named after the five Houses; Bayley, Buckley, Hullett, Moor and Morrison. Each block, apart from the new Hullett block, can accommodate 90 pupils. All blocks have their own staff, and the boarding complex is overseen by several Boarding Mentors.

=== History ===
The foundation stone of the Boarding Complex was laid by Lee Kuan Yew on 25 March 1994. The first batch of boarders moved into the Complex in 1996. During the upgrading works in 2006, the former Moor block was demolished to make way for a 13-storey twin tower hostel, the Hullett block, completed in July 2007, and the former Hullett block in turn renamed Moor. The three blocks of Buckley, Moor and Bayley houses boys enrolling in Raffles Leadership Programme, whereas Morrison block catered to girls previously.

== Campus ==
The Raffles Institution Year 1 - 4 campus consists of six main blocks on 18.65 hectares of land.

===Yusof Ishak Block (Former Admin Block)===
The main building is the Yusof Ishak Block, comprising offices, staff rooms, lecture theatres, study areas and computer labs, as well the Main Atrium. It houses the Year 1-4 General Office and the Raffles Archives &amp; Museum. Major upgrading works were completed in early 2007.

=== Science Hub ===
The Science Hub, opened in 2008, includes facilities for specialised research such as Xploratory-Labs; as well as Chemistry, Physics and Biology labs. It also houses the Discovery Labs, a Laser Animation/Technology Studio, the Materials Science Lab and the Raffles Academy Home Room. It is connected to the Yusof Ishak Block.

===Hullett Memorial Library / Shaw Foundation Dining Hall===
The Hullett Memorial Library (HML) stands below the Shaw Foundation Dining Hall, with a staircase leading down to the library. Co-founded by Lim Boon Keng and Song Ong Siang, it was named after RI&#x27;s longest-serving Headmaster, Richmond William Hullett, in 1923. The library&#x27;s official founding (even though a library and museum, from which the National Museum originated, had existed for decades prior to 1923) also marked the centenary of the founding of the institution. The library traces its roots to the founding of RI, making it the oldest library in Singapore. The origins of Singapore&#x27;s National Library lie in the HML.

=== Sports facilities ===
The school&#x27;s gymnasium underwent renovation in 2010, and was used as a training venue for gymnasts during the 2010 Summer Youth Olympics, together with that in the Year 5-6 campus. The school also has two tennis courts, two basketball courts, two squash courts, and two cricket nets.

Following the re-integration with Raffles Junior College from 2009, more sports facilities are available. Floorball, table tennis, judo and gymnastics are RI sports now able to use the Year 5-6 Campus facilities.

<text>The Communist Party of United States of India () is an underground communist political party in India, based in the state of Andhra Pradesh. The CPUSI was formed on 17 May 1997 as a result of fractional infighting in the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Janashakti. The founder of CPUSI was M. Veeranna and it is sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Janashakti Veeranna&#x27; faction. Veeranna was later killed by police forces. CPUSI belonged to the section who wanted to put stronger emphasis on caste issues rather than class issues. CPUSI conducts armed struggle, through &#x27;dalam&#x27; squads.

Sadhu Malyadri Jambhav is the Andhra Pradesh state secretary of CPUSI.

In June 2001 a high-ranking leader of CPUSI, Yerra Narasa Reddy, surrendered to the police.

The last incident involving the group was in 2005, when two militants of the group were shot dead by police in Andhra Pradesh.

<text>Michael Wolfgang Laurence Morris, Baron Naseby, (born 25 November 1936) is a British Conservative Party politician.

==Early life==
Born in London and educated at Bedford School and St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, Morris was taught to fly in Pakistan and Canada and served in the Royal Air Force.

==Parliamentary career==

Morris contested Islington North at the 1966 general election, being beaten by Labour&#x27;s Gerry Reynolds.

He was first elected to the House of Commons at the February 1974 general election for the then-marginal seat of Northampton South. His majority was just 179 in February 1974, and 141 in October 1974. In 1983 boundary changes turned it into a safe Conservative seat. 

Morris oversaw the passing of the Maastricht Treaty in the Commons in his role as Deputy Speaker. He was defeated by 744 votes at the 1997 general election, when the Labour Party under Tony Blair won a landslide victory.

From 1992, Morris held the non-voting position of &quot;Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker&quot;, and after the election he accepted a life peerage as Baron Naseby, of Sandy in the County of Bedfordshire on 28 October 1997.

==Controversies==

In 2014, the Daily Telegraph&#x27;s chief political commentator Peter Oborne described Lord Naseby as an apologist for the Sri Lankan government, who had given misleading and inaccurate statements about war crimes in Sri Lanka. He was described as giving &quot;comfort to the perpetrators of state sponsored terror&quot; and receiving hospitality from the Sri Lankan government.
Human rights groups accuse Lord Naseby of purposely downplaying the death toll figures gathered by the United Nations panel in 2011 which found that as many as 40,000 Tamil civilians may have been killed in the final months of the civil war in 2009.

<text>The Barren Fork is a tributary of the Collins River in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Via the Collins River, the Caney Fork, and the Cumberland and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed.

The Barren Fork rises in western Warren County, Tennessee. It is formed from the confluence of its north and south prongs, which join near the tiny community of Trousdale. Its component streams and their tributaries drain much of the eastern portions of Cannon County and Coffee County. The stream flows generally from west to east until it reaches the town of McMinnville, county seat of Warren County. From there it turns in a more northeasterly direction. From this point it is less than 5 linear miles (8 km) to the mouth of the Barren Fork into the Collins River, but considerably longer by the meandering course taken by the stream in its lower reaches. Near downtown McMinnville is a dam formerly utilized by the city as an electric power source; it was supplanted by the Tennessee Valley Authority system, as the small amount (by modern standards) of electricity it was capable of producing makes it impracticable to man and maintain by modern standards.

The Barren Fork is named for the &quot;Barrens&quot; area of Middle Tennessee. This area comprises much of Coffee County, western Warren County, and southeastern Cannon County. The area was first named this by the early settlers, who were surprised to find a largely unforested area in the midst of what was generally a dense hardwood forest surrounding it. Several theories have been suggested as to its origin. The area is somewhat swampy, however; it is too moist for many types of hardwood trees that cannot survive long periods of &quot;wet feet&quot;. It is suggested that it was cleared by Native Americans, in part using fire, so that the resulting open area would improve grazing conditions for elk, deer, and buffalo and thus improve hunting, and that they, like their white successors, also used the area for agriculture. Since only a limited number of native hardwood trees could grow in the area, it was relatively easy for the area to remain cleared once it had initially had much of its woody vegetation removed.

The Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency (TWRA) maintains three boat access sites in McMinnville.

<doc id="858597" wikidata="Q2255971" url="?curid=858597" title="The Secret of Roan Inish">
<text>The Secret of Roan Inish is a 1994 independent fantasy-adventure film written and directed by John Sayles. It is based on the 1957 novel &quot;Secret of the Ron Mor Skerry&quot;, by Rosalie K. Fry.

It is centered on the Irish and Orcadian folklores of selkies—seals that can shed their skins to become human. The story, set on the west coast of Ulster in the north-west of Ireland, is about Fiona, a young girl who is sent to live with her grandparents and her cousin Eamon near the island of Roan Inish, where the selkies are rumored to reside. It is a family legend that her younger brother was swept away in his infancy and raised by a selkie. Part of the film takes place in Donegal Town.

==Plot==
Set in 1946, the story is told from the point of view of Fiona (Jeni Courtney), a young girl who is sent to live with her grandparents in an Irish fishing village, after the death of her mother, illness of her father, and her own failing health.

In the evenings, her grandfather tells tales about the family&#x27;s history, including the evacuation from their generational home on the tiny island of Roan Inish during the Second World War. Known in Irish as &quot;Rón Inis&quot;, meaning &quot;Island of Seals&quot;, Roan Inish is a real location near Narin, a village on the west coast of County Donegal in the west of Ulster.

They live in the Ireland of tiny fishing villages, places where everyone knows one another. People live close to nature, and animals are respected and live alongside the villagers. Seals are especially respected for their special human-like spirit. It is said to be terribly wrong to harm a seal.

As she meets other villagers, Fiona hears from a distant cousin, Tadhg, about an ancestor who married a beautiful selkie (seal-woman). The story goes that although theirs was a marriage full of happiness, success and many children, there was always the mysterious seal-bond to the ocean. Tadhg tells her that the selkie&#x27;s blood remains in their family tree, and once in a generation, there is a &quot;dark one&quot; in the family, like himself, and Fiona&#x27;s baby brother Jamie.

Fiona hears details about how the sea seemed to steal her infant brother, Jamie, during the departure from Roan Inish, bobbing out of sight in his little cradle boat, some years earlier, never to be seen again.

Her cousin, Eamon, who also lives near the grandparents for his health, often accompanies the Grandfather in his curragh - fishing boat - on daily errands to the islands including Roan Inish. Quickly the bright and older Eamon becomes a partner in Fiona&#x27;s plans, as the day&#x27;s adventures on the sea and shore become more interesting.

Soon, on one of the visits to Roan Inish, Fiona believes that she has found Jamie romping on the strand and again, in the grass. She confides in Eamon, who warns her to not tell the grandparents for now. She observes that the seals seem to care for him, helping to feed him and play with him.

They get the idea that her grandparents should move back to Roan Inish and, when they do, the seals will return Jamie to them. The grandparents&#x27; current landlord is selling their home and they will need to move soon, but won&#x27;t move to Roan Inish due to the sadness they feel at losing Jamie. Without telling them, Fiona and Eamon reason: if they must move again, why not back to the cottages they loved best?

Saying nothing to anyone about their plan, Fiona and Eamon set to the hard work of reclaiming the long-abandoned cottages on Roan Inish. They clean and restore the cottages, give them new thatch, paint, gardens, and furnishings.

After returning to her grandparents, a terrible storm rises and Fiona fears for Jamie&#x27;s safety in the strong winds. She wonders aloud: &quot;I hope he thinks to go inside the cottage.&quot; Her grandparents hear her and are in utter disbelief at her explanation.

Her grandmother is wise and unhesitant - rising to her feet and to the moment, her body and actions say: if there is any chance the child lives, when thought dead these years, rescue must be immediate.

She gathers her husband, Eamon and Fiona, they pack what they need, and climb into the curragh and make their way to Roan Inish. Racing inside, they see that Jamie is not there and the wind is rising in power and the rain has begun. The grandparents are, however, astonished and grateful to Fiona and Eamon for their secret restoration of the cottages these past few weeks.

Jamie&#x27;s tiny cradle bobs to shore and he jumps out, heading for the cottages to escape the storm, shepherded to safety lovingly by the seals, as they&#x27;d probably been doing all along. But then he stops and runs back - he sees his grandparents and Eamon and Fiona, his big sister, and has no memory of them. In front of the group, grandmother calls to him to not be afraid and to come to them for love and safety - come to his family at last. Jamie remains motionless and afraid, still, then runs for his cradle, but at this point several of the seals herd him towards his family, and prevent him from returning to the cradle boat and the sea. He reluctantly makes his way into his grandmother&#x27;s open arms and they make their way inside. Seeing that Jamie is safe, the seals depart.

Indoors, the victorious family are elated at the return of the child they thought dead. They wrap Jamie in a blanket and sit in front of a warm dry fire. Fiona rocks him to sleep in her arms.

==Production==
In creating the film, John Sayles drew on original research of Celtic island lore and language, including the Blasket memoirs, a series of vernacular memoirs collected in the 1920s and &#x27;30s from residents of the Great Blasket, an island off the County Kerry coast evacuated by the Irish government in 1953 and made a national park in 1989.

&quot;Veteran cinematographer Haskell Wexler gives &quot;The Secret of Roan Inish&quot; an effortlessly elemental look. Without ostentation or self-consciousness, the film immerses you in the spume, fog and glare of the seaside life, with its temporal mysteries and its organic metamorphoses. Mason Daring&#x27;s spare, traditional Irish score adds one more layer of melancholy atmosphere,&quot; noted Scott Rosenberg of SFGate. Although in the original novel the story takes place in Scotland, the filmmakers decided to have the film take place in Ireland for practical reasons. According to John Sayles in the director&#x27;s commentary, most of the film was shot in County Donegal in Ulster in the north of Ireland, with some scenes being filmed on the Isle of Mull in Argyll, Scotland.

Over 1,000 girls were tested for the role of Fiona, which required the actress to be &quot;Thin, underweight, pale complexion, but perky and not afraid of water.&quot;

===Restoration===
In 2020, the UCLA Film and Television Archive made a digitally restored print of the film.

==Reception==
===Critical response===
It holds a 96% average rating of 7.8/10 on review site Rotten Tomatoes, based on 45 reviews. Scott Rosenberg of SFGate describes it as being &quot;a lot like the island it&#x27;s named after: It seems to occupy a time of its own, cut off from the speed and overload of contemporary life and drifting to its own ancient rhythms.&quot; Critic Stephen Holden, film critic for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, liked the film&#x27;s direction. He wrote, &quot;&quot;The Secret of Roan Inish&quot; is the first film directed by Mr. Sayles that could be described as visually rhapsodic. Photographed by Haskell Wexler on Ireland&#x27;s rugged northwestern seacoast, it is a cinematic tone poem in which man and nature, myth and reality flow together in a way that makes them ultimately indivisible.&quot;

<doc id="858598" wikidata="Q5062673" url="?curid=858598" title="Centre points of the United Kingdom">
<text>There has long been debate over the exact location of the geographical centre of the United Kingdom, and its constituent countries, due to the complexity and method of the calculation, such as whether to include offshore islands, and the fact that erosion will cause the position to change over time. There are two main methods of calculating this &quot;centre&quot;: either as the centroid of the two-dimensional shape made by the country (projected to the Airy ellipsoid then flattened using the Transverse Mercator projection), or as the point farthest from the boundary of the country (either the sea, or, in the case of constituent countries, a land border). These two methods give quite different answers.

==Traditional locations==
The town of Haltwhistle in Northumberland has banners stating that it is the &quot;Centre of Britain&quot;. By another calculation the centre can also be said to be Dunsop Bridge, Lancashire, 71 miles (114 km) to the south.

However, in 2002 the Ordnance Survey conducted studies that pinpointed the respective centres more precisely, and it is their results that are quoted below.

==Centroid locations==
The centroid is a mathematically derived point that is in every sense the centre of a two dimensional area like a piece of land. If a straight line is drawn through a centroid in any direction there will be equal length of the line on either side of the centroid as measured from it to the boundary if the line is unbroken on either side. If a line crosses an inlet of the sea then it can be considered as a stick of uniform weight with a material of negligible weight crossing the water, the line would then balance precisely at the centroid point if suspended.
Put simply, the centroid is the point at which a cardboard cut-out of the area could be perfectly balanced on the tip of a pencil. Islands are assumed fixed to the mainland in their precise position by invisible rigid weightless wires. A mathematical method is used to do the balancing to a much greater accuracy than the practical method could achieve.

Unless stated, positions are the centroids of the two-dimensional shapes made by the countries. Calculations include offshore islands unless stated.

===United Kingdom===
* A position &quot;in the middle of Morecambe Bay&quot;, approximately off the coast at Morecambe (#2), Lancashire, at Ordnance Survey .

===Great Britain===
* Whitendale Hanging Stones (#1 on the map), near Brennand Farm, outside Dunsop Bridge, Lancashire in the Forest of Bowland.(; ) 

=== Great Britain (mainland only) ===
* A field south of Calderstones Partnership NHS Foundation Trust (#3), near Whalley, Lancashire ()
===England===
* Lindley Hall Farm (#4), Leicestershire (near Fenny Drayton and Higham on the Hill) (; ) A plaque denoting this point, and disputing the &quot;traditional&quot; centre of England as being at Meriden in the West Midlands, was erected by Ordnance Survey on 14 June 2013 

===Northern Ireland===
* Annaghone (#5), near Cookstown, County Tyrone ( ) Irish grid ref H 84494 74047.

===Scotland===
* Between Blair Atholl (#6) and Dalwhinnie, Perthshire (; ) 

===Wales===
* Banc Mawr (#7), near Cwmystwyth, Ceredigion (; )

==Locations found by other methods ==
Point farthest from the sea

* Church Flatts Farm (#8), Coton in the Elms, Derbyshire ()

Point farthest from high tide mark (including tidal rivers)

* Between Hammerwich and Wall, south-west of Lichfield, Staffordshire (;)

 &quot;Mid point of the longest north–south axis&quot; 
* Haltwhistle, Northumberland. The midpoint of the longest north–south meridian; also approximately the midpoint of each of the lines through it across Great Britain along the 16 main compass directions.

Centre of population
* This calculation depends on the method used (mean, median or geometric median; see Centre of population for details).
::A calculation by Danny Dorling using the mean (least squares) method based on local authority district data from the 1990s gave the population centre of Great Britain at Appleby Parva, Leicestershire, 20 miles south of Derby. Since then, the population centre will have moved slightly south and east.

Centre of England
For centuries the parish of Meriden to the west of Coventry has claimed to be the geographical centre of England, and there has been a stone cross there commemorating the claim for at least 500 years. The justification is that the point farthest from the sea is in the parish. Morton, Derbyshire also claims to be the centre of England as it is not only midway along England&#x27;s longest north-south axis, but also midway between the east coast and the Welsh border. Claims are also made for a tree, the Midland Oak, in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, although the basis for these claims is not clear.

<text>Tamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (Tamil People&#x27;s Progressive Federation) is a political party in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It was founded in 2000.

==History==
The party was founded by B. John Pandian in 2000. It is a caste-based political party in Tamilnadu.

==Electoral history==
===2001 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election===
In the 2001 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, the party joined the AIADMK-led Alliance and was allotted Egmore constituency to be contested on &quot;Twin-leaves&quot; symbol. The party fielded its founder John Pandian in the seat. But he lost the seat to Parithi Ilamvazhuthi by a slender margin of 86 votes in its maiden election.

===2011 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election===
In the 2011 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, the party opted to join the Third front led by Indhiya Jananayaga Katchi led by T. R. Paarivendhar comprising Tamizhaga Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam, Samooka Samathuva Padai, Tamil Nadu Vanigar Peravai and VOC Peravai. The front fielded candidates in more than 150 constituencies.

===2016 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election===
In the 2016 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election, the party contested 52 seats in &quot;Pot&quot; symbol with John Pandian contesting in the Tiruvadanai Assembly constituency. But the party faced defeat in all constituencies which it contested. It also formed alliance with Marudham Makkal Katchi headed by former MLA Soundarapandian and Bharatiya Vikasha Shakti party for the elections allotting five and two seats to them respectively.

===2019 Lok Sabha election===
The demand for merging the subsects of Scheduled Caste in the state of Tamilnadu such as Pallar, Devendrakulathar, Pannadi, Kaladi, Vathiriyar and Kudumbar into a single entity as Devendrakula Velalar gained pace along with the delisting of those subsects to Other Backward Class. The party joined the National Democratic Alliance in 2017. The party supported the alliance in 2019 Indian general election.

===2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election===
The party was allotted one seat in the alliance for the 2021 Tamil Nadu Legislative Assembly election. After 20 years, B. John Pandian once again contested the Egmore constituency and lost it. Post the election, the party left AIADMK-led Alliance citing differences over seat sharing in the election. However it continued its partnership in the National Democratic Alliance.

===2024 Lok Sabha election===
As a part of NDA alliance, the party was allocated to contest the Tenkasi Lok Sabha constituency seat under the symbol of the Bharatiya Janata Party. However, the candidate, B. John Pandian failed to win the seat but polled 208,825 votes.

<text>K-type asteroids are relatively uncommon asteroids with a moderately reddish spectrum shortwards of 0.75 μm, and a slight bluish trend longwards of this. They have a low albedo. Their spectrum resembles that of CV and CO meteorites. A larger K type is 9 Metis. 

These asteroids were described as &quot;featureless&quot; S-types in the Tholen classification. The K-type was proposed by J. F. Bell and colleagues in 1988 for bodies having a particularly shallow 1 μm absorption feature, and lacking the 2 μm absorption. These were found during studies of the Eos family of asteroids.

<text>Rousas John Rushdoony (April 25, 1916 – February 8, 2001) was an Armenian-American Calvinist philosopher, historian, and theologian. He is credited as being the father of Christian Reconstructionism and an inspiration for the modern Christian homeschool movement. His followers and critics have argued that his thought exerts considerable influence on the evangelical Christian right.

==Biography==
Rousas John Rushdoony () was born in New York City, the son of recently arrived Ottoman Armenian immigrants Vartanoush (née Gazarian) and Yegheazar Khachig Rushdoony. Before his parents fled the Armenian genocide of 1915, his ancestors had lived in a remote area near Mount Ararat in what is now Turkey. It is said that since the year 320 AD, every generation of the Rushdoony family has produced a Christian priest or minister. Rushdoony himself claimed that his ancestors &quot;would perpetually give a member of their family to be a priest to perform a kind of Aaronic priesthood as in the Old Testament, an hereditary priesthood. Whoever in the family felt called would become the priest. And our family did so. So from the early 300&#x27;s until now there has always been someone in the ministry in the family.&quot;

Within weeks of arriving in America, his parents moved to the small farming community of Kingsburg, California, in Fresno County, where a number of other Armenian families had relocated. They then converted from the Armenian Apostolic Church to Presbyterianism. In Kingsburg, his father Yegheazar founded a church, Armenian Martyrs Presbyterian. Rousas learned to read English by poring over the family&#x27;s King James Bible: &quot;By the time I reached my teens I had read the Bible through from cover to cover, over and over and over again.”

The family moved in 1925 for a short time to Detroit, Michigan, where his father pastored another Armenian church. They returned to Kingsburg in 1931, and Rousas completed school in California. His father was the pastor of Bethel Armenian Presbyterian Church in San Francisco in 1942. Rousas had a younger sister, Rose (named after their mother), and a brother, Haig. His father died in Fresno in 1961.

===Education===
Rushdoony attended public schools, where he learned English, but Armenian was the language spoken at home. He continued his education at the University of California, Berkeley, where he earned a B.A. in English in 1938, a teaching credential in 1939, and an M.A. in Education in 1940. Rushdoony and Arda Gent married in San Francisco the week before Christmas 1943.

Rushdoony attended the Pacific School of Religion, a Congregationalist and Methodist seminary in Berkeley, California, from which he graduated in 1944. Through letters over the years, he kept up his friendship with his Pacific School of Religion mentor, theology professor George Huntston Williams, who saw in him the &quot;heir of a great national Christian heritage&quot; who would &quot;enunciate anew the Gospel which seems to have been forgotten for a season.&quot; In 1944, he was ordained by the Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.

He was later awarded an honorary Ph.D. from Valley Christian University for his book, &quot;The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum&quot;. Gary North stated that Rushdoony read at least one book a day, six days a week, for fifty years of his life, underlining sentences and making an index of its main ideas in the rear.

===Ministry===
Rushdoony and his wife Arda served for eight and a half years as missionaries to the Shoshone and Paiute Indians on the remote Duck Valley Indian Reservation in northern Nevada. They lived in the reservation&#x27;s primary town, Owyhee. It was during their mission to the Native Americans that Rushdoony began writing.

Arda taught at the reservation school and Sunday school, led a Girl Scout troop, coached the girls&#x27; basketball team, and visited with families. In 1945, they adopted Ronald, an orphaned baby from the reservation. Between 1947 and 1952 in Owyhee, four daughters were born to them. In late 1952, Rushdoony took an American Presbyterian Church pastorate at Trinity Presbyterian Church in Santa Cruz, California, and the family left Duck Valley in January 1953. Their son Mark was born the next month in Santa Cruz.
In Santa Cruz, Rushdoony became a reader of the Christian libertarian magazine &quot;Faith and Freedom&quot;, which advocated an &quot;anti-tax, non-interventionist, anti-statist economic model&quot; in opposition to Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. &quot;Faith and Freedom&quot;″s views on government aligned with Rushdoony&#x27;s fears of centralized government power, given the Rushdoony family&#x27;s memories of the Armenian Genocide. Rushdoony contributed articles to &quot;Faith and Freedom&quot;, including one describing his observations of the Duck Valley Indian Reservation, arguing that government support had reduced residents to &quot;social and personal irresponsibility&quot;.

The Rushdoonys separated in 1957 and later divorced. About this time, Rushdoony transferred his church membership from the American Presbyterian Church to the Orthodox Presbyterian denomination. The Orthodox Presbyterian Church&#x27;s newsletter, &quot;The Presbyterian Guardian&quot;, reported in July 1958 that &quot;the Rev. Rousas J. Rushdoony… was received and a new Orthodox Presbyterian Church organized, consisting of [sixty-six charter members] who had separated from the Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. in Santa Cruz.&quot; In their petition, the group asked that Rushdoony be ordained as their pastor and stated, &quot;[W]e cannot abide in any church which seeks to define righteousness or sin, salvation or sanctification, except in terms of the Word of God. We have witnessed, here in Santa Cruz, against modernism, man-made perfectionism, and church bureaucracy&quot;. The newsletter article goes on to report, &quot;The Presbytery in receiving the church also examined Mr. Thomas Kirkwood and Mr. Kenneth Webb as prospective elders, and they with Mr. Rushdoony were constituted the session of the church,&quot; and announced the publication of Rushdoony&#x27;s &quot;By What Standard?&quot; later that year.

===Later life===
The May 1962 edition of &quot;The Presbyterian Guardian&quot; reported Rushdoony&#x27;s resignation, noted as &quot;reportedly to devote his time for his writing and lecturing.&quot; Rushdoony married his second wife, Dorothy Barbara Ross Kirkwood, in 1962. She died in 2003.

Rushdoony moved to Los Angeles in 1965 and founded the Chalcedon Foundation; the monthly &quot;Chalcedon Report&quot;, which Rushdoony edited, began appearing that October. His daughter Sharon later married Gary North, a Christian Reconstructionist writer and economic historian. North and Rushdoony became collaborators, and their partnership lasted until 1981 when it ended due to a dispute over the content of one of North&#x27;s articles. Following the dispute, North and Chalcedon continued to promote each other&#x27;s views independently, but they did not reach a &quot;truce&quot; until 1995.

Under Rushdoony, the Chalcedon Foundation grew to twelve staff members with 25,000–40,000 people on their mailing lists during the 1980s. Chalcedon and Reconstructionism obtained the support of major Christian book publishers and endorsements from influential evangelical leaders, including Pat Robertson, Jerry Falwell, and Frank Schaeffer (who later repudiated the movement).

Rushdoony died in 2001 with his children at his side. Rushdoony&#x27;s son, Mark R. Rushdoony, became and remains the president of the Chalcedon Foundation and editor of the &quot;Chalcedon Report&quot;.

==Philosophical and theological contributions==
Michael J. McVicar summarized Rushdoony&#x27;s theology and philosophy as follows:

Rushdoony developed his philosophy as an extension of the work of Calvinist philosopher Cornelius Van Til. Van Til critiqued human knowledge in light of the Calvinist doctrine of total depravity. He argued that sin affected a person&#x27;s ability to reason. In order to be rational, Van Til claimed, one must presuppose the existence of God and the inerrant, divine inspiration of the (Protestant) Bible. Rushdoony attended to the implications – where Van Til held true knowledge came from God, Rushdoony asserted that &quot;all non-Christian knowledge is sinful, invalid nonsense. The only valid knowledge that non-Christians possess is &#x27;stolen&#x27; from &#x27;Christian-theistic&#x27; sources.&quot; In effect, Rushdoony extended Van Til&#x27;s thinking from philosophy to &quot;all of life and thought.&quot;

===Early writings===
Rushdoony began to promote the works of Calvinist philosophers Cornelius Van Til and Herman Dooyeweerd into a short survey of contemporary humanism called &quot;By What Standard?&quot;. Arguing for a Calvinist system of thought, Rushdoony dealt with subjects as broad as epistemology and cognitive metaphysics and as narrow as the psychology of religion and predestination. He wrote a book, &quot;The One And The Many: Studies in the Philosophy of Order and Ultimacy&quot;, using Van Tillian presuppositional philosophy to critique various aspects of secular humanism. He also wrote many essays and book reviews, published in such venues as the &quot;Westminster Theological Journal&quot;.

===Homeschooling===
Rushdoony&#x27;s next focus was on education, especially on behalf of homeschooling, which he saw as a way to combat the intentionally secular nature of the U.S. public school system. By the early 1980s, he was active in the homeschooling movement, appearing as an expert witness in order to defend the rights of homeschoolers. He vigorously attacked progressive school reformers such as Horace Mann and John Dewey and argued for the dismantling of the state&#x27;s influence on education in three works: &quot;Intellectual Schizophrenia&quot; (a general and concise study of education), &quot;The Messianic Character of American Education&quot; (a history and castigation of public education in the U.S.), and &quot;The Philosophy of the Christian Curriculum&quot; (a parent-oriented pedagogical statement).

===History===
Rushdoony then pursued history – of the world, of the United States, and of the church. He maintained that Calvinistic Christianity provided the intellectual roots for the American Revolution and thus had always had an influential impact in American history. The American Revolution, according to Rushdoony, was a &quot;conservative counterrevolution&quot; to preserve American liberties from British usurpation and it owed nothing to the Enlightenment. He further argued that the United States Constitution was a secular document in appearance only and did not need to establish Christianity as an official religion since the states were already Christian establishments. Drawing on the work of theologian Robert Lewis Dabney, Rushdoony argued that the American Civil War &quot;destroyed the early American Republic, which he envisioned as a decentralized Protestant feudal system and an orthodox Christian nation.&quot; Rushdoony
saw the North&#x27;s victory as a &quot;defeat for Christian orthodoxy.&quot;
Some historians have argued that this aspect of Rushdoony&#x27;s thought influenced some activists in the
Neo-Confederate movement and Southern conservatives such as J. Steven Wilkins. He would further this study in his works on American ideology and historiography, &quot;This Independent Republic: Studies in the Nature and Meaning of American History&quot; and &quot;The Nature of the American System&quot;.

On the matter of Israel&#x27;s place in history, he believed that the prophet Daniel &quot;makes clear that God by-passed His chosen people in favor of four great monarchies...and then called forth a Fifth Monarchy which is by no means identified with Israel&quot;.

===Christian Reconstruction===

Rushdoony&#x27;s most important area of writing, however, was law and politics, as expressed in his small book of popular essays &quot;Law &amp; Liberty&quot; and discussed in much greater detail in his three-volume, 1,894-page magnum opus, &quot;The Institutes of Biblical Law&quot;. With a title modeled after Calvin&#x27;s &quot;Institutes of the Christian Religion&quot;, Rushdoony&#x27;s &quot;Institutes&quot; was arguably his most influential work. In the book, he proposed that Old Testament law should be applied to modern society and that there should be a Christian theonomy, a concept developed in his colleague Greg Bahnsen&#x27;s controversial book &quot;Theonomy in Christian Ethics,&quot; which Rushdoony heartily endorsed. In the &quot;Institutes&quot;, Rushdoony supported the reinstatement of the Mosaic law&#x27;s penal sanctions. Under such a system, the list of civil crimes which carried a death sentence would include homosexuality, adultery, incest, lying about one&#x27;s virginity, bestiality, witchcraft, idolatry or apostasy, public blasphemy, false prophesying, kidnapping, rape, and bearing false witness in a capital case. Although he supported the separation of church and state at the national level, Rushdoony also believed that both institutions were under the rule of God, and thus he conceived secularism as posing endless false dichotomies, which his massive work addresses in considerable detail. In short, he sought to cast a vision for the reconstruction of society based on Christian principles. The book was critical of democracy. He wrote that &quot;the heresy of democracy has since then worked havoc in church and state ... Christianity and democracy are inevitably enemies&quot; because democracy asserts the will of man over the will of God. According to Frank Schaeffer, who knew Rushdoony, Rushdoony supported the re-institution of the slave trade, corporal punishment for children, burning people at the stake and public executions.

Rushdoony believed that a republic is a better form of civil government than a democracy. According to Rushdoony, a republic avoided mob rule and the rule of the &quot;51%&quot; of society; in other words &quot;might does not make right&quot; in a republic. Rushdoony wrote that America&#x27;s separation of powers between three branches of government is a far more neutral and better method of civil government than a direct democracy, stating &quot;[t]he [American] Constitution was designed to perpetuate a Christian order&quot;. Rushdoony argues that the Constitution&#x27;s purpose was to protect religion from the federal government and to preserve &quot;states&#x27; rights.&quot;

Rushdoony&#x27;s work has been used by Dominion Theology advocates who attempt to implement a Christian government subject to Biblical law in the United States. Authority, behavioral boundaries, economics, penology and the like would all be governed by biblical principles in Rushdoony&#x27;s vision, but he also proposed a wide system of freedom, especially in the economic sphere, and claimed Ludwig von Mises as an intellectual mentor; he called himself a Christian libertarian.

Rushdoony was the founder in 1965 of the Chalcedon Foundation and the editor of its monthly magazine, the &quot;Chalcedon Report&quot;. He also published the &quot;Journal of Christian Reconstruction&quot; and was an early board member of the Rutherford Institute, founded in 1982 by John W. Whitehead.

In 1972, Cornelius Van Til &quot;disclaimed affiliation&quot; with Rushdoony and the Christian Reconstructionist movement, writing &quot;...I am frankly a little concerned about the political views of Mr. Rushdoony and Mr. North and particularly if I am correctly informed about some of the views Gary North has with respect to the application of Old Testament principles to our day. My only point is that I would hope and expect they would not claim such views are inherent in the principles I hold&quot;.

==Criticism==
Rushdoony was, and remains, a controversial figure, as is the Christian Reconstructionist movement in which he was involved. Pointing to Rushdoony&#x27;s support for the death penalty, the British Centre for Science Education decried his perceived dislike of democracy and tolerance. Furthermore, Rushdoony has been accused of Holocaust denial and racism.

According to Frank Schaeffer, Rushdoony believed that interracial marriage, which he referred to as &quot;unequal yoking&quot;, should be made illegal; however, his son Mark R. Rushdoony stated that his father R. J. Rushdoony officiated at weddings between European American and African American couples, teaching that &quot;I cannot forbid what God has not!&quot; What R. J. Rushdoony actually thought was imprudent, according to his son Mark R. Rushdoony, were marriages in which there were significant cultural differences such as those between non-Christian war brides from Japan and American soldiers who, in Rushdoony&#x27;s view, little understood one another; in his own life, the father of the first woman whom R. J. Rushdoony courted rejected Rushdoony&#x27;s proposal citing cultural differences between their Swedish background and Rushdoony&#x27;s Armenian background. Mark R. Rushdoony stated that R. J. Rushdoony&#x27;s views &quot;did not reflect on any race but on what could potentially create an unequal yoke&quot; and asserted his own father&#x27;s view that &quot;Man ... cannot treat his fellow-men or any part of creation with contempt.&quot;

He also opposed &quot;enforced integration&quot;, referred to Southern slavery as &quot;benevolent&quot;, and said that &quot;some people are by nature slaves&quot;. Kerwin Lee Klein, however, argues that Rushdoony was not a &quot;biological racialist&quot; and that for him &quot;racism founded on modern biology simply represented another pagan revival.&quot;

In &quot;The Institutes of Biblical Law&quot;, he uses the 1967 work &quot;Judaism and the Vatican&quot; by Léon de Poncins as a source for Paul Rassinier&#x27;s figure of 1.2 million Jewish deaths during the Holocaust, and the claim that Raul Hilberg calculated the number at 896,292, and further asserts that very many of these died of epidemics. He called the charge of 6 million Jewish deaths &quot;false witness&quot; against Germany. In 2000, Rushdoony stated concerning this passage in his &quot;Institutes&quot;: &quot;It was not my purpose to enter a debate over numbers, whether millions were killed, or tens of millions, an area which must be left to others with expertise in such matters. My point then and now is that in all such matters what the Ninth Commandment requires is the truth, not exaggeration, irrespective of the cause one seeks to serve.&quot; Carl R. Trueman, Professor of Historical Theology and Church History at Westminster Theological Seminary wrote in 2009 regarding the passage and Rushdoony&#x27;s Holocaust denial:

Joe Boot, in a misguided attempt to rebut Trueman&#x27;s claim, argues that Rushdoony&#x27;s &quot;sole point was to say that our society has become so desensitized to violence, brutality, and cruelty that citing murders in small numbers doesn&#x27;t have the same psychological impact upon people anymore.&quot;

Murray Rothbard, a prominent figure in the American libertarian movement, disputed Rushdoony&#x27;s claim of being a libertarian in a scathing book review of Rushdoony&#x27;s &quot;Intellectual Schizophrenia&quot;.

<doc id="858612" wikidata="Q1987626" url="?curid=858612" title="Power Rangers S.P.D.">
<text>Power Rangers S.P.D. is the thirteenth season of the television series &quot;Power Rangers&quot; and is based on the 28th Super Sentai series &quot;Tokusou Sentai Dekaranger&quot;. The initials in the title stand for &quot;Space Patrol Delta&quot;; in &quot;Dekaranger&quot;, it stood for &quot;Special Police Dekaranger&quot;. The season debuted on February 5, 2005, as part of Jetix, originally airing on ABC Family; beginning with &quot;Messenger, Part 2&quot;, the series moved to Toon Disney.

A Japanese dub of &quot;S.P.D.&quot; started airing on Toei&#x27;s digital television channel in Japan starting in August 2011, with two DVD volumes released on August 5. It features the original &quot;Dekaranger&quot; cast members dubbing over the voices of their American counterparts (with the exception of Mako Ishino, who is the series&#x27; narrator rather than voicing her character&#x27;s counterpart).

== Plot ==

While the majority live in peace, some become criminals, with the Space Patrol Delta (S.P.D.) law enforcement agency being formed to police them.

==Episodes==

&lt;onlyinclude&gt;










&lt;/onlyinclude&gt;

==Video game==

There was one game produced for the &quot;Space Patrol Delta&quot; series, a side-scroller on the Game Boy Advance by THQ. The 6 rangers fight minor enemies until they encounter the main boss. There are racing levels which involve piloting the Red, Yellow, or Pink Delta Runners, a Space Invaders style targeting game with the Green Delta Runner, a racing level involving R.I.C. (the Rangers&#x27; robotic dog), and Megazord battle levels.

==Comics==
A new monthly comic strip based on the series appeared in every issue of Jetix Magazine in the UK in 2005. Jetix Magazine is the official magazine of Jetix, the channel that showed &quot;S.P.D.&quot; in the UK in 2006. The strip was the first Power Rangers strip to be written by Transformers writer Simon Furman, collaborating for the first time on the PR strip with equally popular TF artist Andrew Wildman, who had previously done artwork for other Power Rangers strips under Jetix Magazines&#x27; previous banner of Fox Kids&#x27; Wicked.

During the strip, a running subplot involving a rogue Krybot who had become self-aware and rebelled against Grumm gradually unfolded, he would resurface to warn SPD of Grumm&#x27;s invasion attempt in the final story and supply Jack with a device that once inserted on the Terror, would incapacitate the Krybot fleet.

The strip ended with its own conclusion to the SPD series, the first time any comic strip version of Power Rangers has done a different take on a PR finale. In the strip, A-Squad is brainwashed instead of corrupted and turn against their superiors. The B-Squad regulars deal with them and help Cruger defeat and overcome both Grumm and Omni, before being promoted to A-Squad status.

In 2018, the SPD Rangers appeared in Boom! Studios&#x27;s &quot;Shattered Grid&quot;, a crossover event between teams from all eras commemorating the 25th anniversary of the original television series. It was published in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; #25–30 and various tie-ins. A &quot;Power Rangers SPD&quot; story by Caleb Goellner and Patrick Mulholland was published in &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers 2018 Annual&quot; as part of the crossover.

<text>USS &quot;Revenge&quot; (AM-110) was a World War II-era in the service of the United States Navy. It was the sixth United States vessel named &quot;Revenge&quot;.

&quot;Revenge&quot; was laid down as &quot;Right&quot; on 19 June 1942 by Winslow Marine Railway and Shipbuilding Company, Seattle, Washington; launched on 7 November 1942; renamed &quot;Revenge&quot; 15 May 1943; and commissioned on 21 July 1943.

==Service history==

===Marshall and Gilbert Islands campaign===
After outfitting at Puget Sound Navy Yard, &quot;Revenge&quot; underwent shakedown out of San Pedro and San Diego, California. She departed on 13 October 1943 for further training in the Hawaiian Islands, and on 10 November she set course for Makin Island, the Gilberts, arriving two days later. After two days of minesweeping, she commenced anti-submarine patrol off Makin and Tarawa.

Following Christmas and training at Pearl Harbor, &quot;Revenge&quot; sailed for Kwajalein Atoll and commenced minesweeping operations on 13 January 1944. For a brief period following the invasion, she alternated between antisubmarine patrol and harbor entrance control. From the end of February through mid-May, she was utilized as an escort vessel, travelling between the Marshalls, the Gilberts and the Hawaiian Islands. She then returned to the west coast.

===Philippines campaign===
Upon completion of a short availability at Mare Island Navy Yard, &quot;Revenge&quot; again commenced escort duty out of Pearl Harbor. September brought the resumption of training exercises, this time at Hilo, after which she sailed for Manus, the Admiralties. On 11 October she headed for the Philippines and the invasion of Leyte.

The weather was exceedingly rough and, the night before the initial sweep, 20 foot seas were running. In spite of the weather, Mine Division 13 (of which &quot;Revenge&quot; was a unit) entered Leyte Gulf at daybreak with gear streamed. No navigational plots could be kept, nor could the ships remain on stations as the weather had reached typhoon intensity. No enemy action was observed, but activities were made hazardous by the abundance of floating mines and the difficulties involved in maneuvering the craft. Weather abated somewhat the next day and sweeping operations were earned out in a more normal fashion. After six days &quot;Revenge&quot; was credited with the destruction of nearly 70 mines.

Once the beachhead was secured and the anchorage made safe, the division continued clearance sweeps around Homonhon and Samar. On 27 November, and &quot;Revenge&quot; made an exploratory sweep on the western side of Leyte.

&quot;Revenge&quot; was scheduled to participate in the invasion of Luzon early in January 1945, but, because of a damaged propeller shaft, she was ordered to Pearl Harbor for repairs. In February she was again assigned convoy duty, this time out of Ulithi, Western Carolines. Then, on 19 March she got underway with some 70 other minecraft for the invasion of Okinawa.

===Okinawa invasion===
No early difficulties were encountered off Okinawa by &quot;Revenge&quot;. She operated just off the invasion beaches, where strong tides caused some anxiety and these very tides caused to drift into unswept waters 28 March, where she struck a mine and sank. In the attendant rescue operations, &quot;Revenge&quot; cleared a path to one side of &quot;Skylark&quot; while cleared a path to the other. Rescue work was so efficient that only five men died in the stricken minesweeper, and they were killed in the initial explosion.

For 76 days &quot;Revenge&quot; remained on patrol off Okinawa. In March her gunners detected and sank a Japanese suicide boat as it attempted to run in under cover of darkness. Late in June relief was assigned and &quot;Revenge&quot; called at Guam for two weeks of availability.

===Post-war operations===
In July &quot;Revenge&quot; returned to Okinawa, but soon departed with a small minesweeping group for the East China Sea. Then, on 27 August, &quot;Revenge&quot; went alongside to take aboard a Japanese pilot for the sweep of Tokyo Bay. The next morning &quot;Revenge&quot; led the group into Tokyo Bay. (The helmsman was Charles Quick ).There was a fairly wide channel, and safe anchorages were quickly charted for the rest of the fleet. The minesweepers then shifted operations to the coastline. After a month of such operations and some additional time in Tokyo Bay, the minesweepers were ordered to Sasebo.

Operations out of Sasebo took &quot;Revenge&quot; and her sisters into the East China Sea and the Straits of Formosa. She spent Christmas of 1945 in Shanghai, and in January 1946 returned Sasebo. In mid-January she sailed for San Pedro, California, and from there through the Panama Canal for Charleston, South Carolina, for inactivation . Following inactivation on 18 March 1947 she was assigned to the Texas Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Orange, Texas.

===Second commission, 1951–1955===
Recommissioned on 14 February 1951 &quot;Revenge&quot; provided training services along the east coast as well as in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico.

<text>Karl Peter Wilhelm Maurenbrecher (21 December 18386 November 1892, Leipzig) was a German historian.

He was born in Bonn and studied in Berlin and Munich under Leopold von Ranke and Heinrich von Sybel, being especially influenced by the latter historian. After conducting research work at Simancas in Spain, he successively became an associate and full professor of history at the University of Dorpat (1867).

Afterwards, he attained professorships in history at Königsberg (1869), Bonn (1877) and Leipzig (1884), where he was successor to his late friend Carl von Noorden.

As a Protestant historian, Maurenbrecher felt an obligation to treat Catholic history objectively. He shared Ranke&#x27;s views in regards to the common origin of the Protestant and Catholic Reformations. He chose the term &quot;Catholic Reformation&quot; as an indication of it being a positive tendency of reform rather than a defensive reaction to the Protestant Reformation. Maurenbrecher depicted the Dutch scholar Erasmus as a pioneer and proponent of Catholic reform.

== Literary works ==
Many of Maurenbrecher&#x27;s works are concerned with the Reformation, among them being:
* &quot;England im Reformationszeitalter&quot; (Düsseldorf, 1866) - England and the Age of Reformation.
* &quot;Karl V. und die deutschen Protestanten&quot; (Düsseldorf, 1865) - Charles V and the German Protestants. 
* &quot;Studien und Skizzen zur Geschichte der Reformationszeit&quot; (Leipzig, 1874) - Studies and sketches on the history of the Reformation.
* &quot;Geschichte der Katholischen Reformation&quot; (Nördlingen, 1880, incomplete) - History of the Catholic Reformation.
Other writings by Maurenbrecher include:
* &quot;Gründung des deutschen Reiches 1859-1871&quot; (Leipzig, 1892; 1902) - Founding of the German Empire 1859–1871.
* &quot;Geschichte der deutschen Königswahlen&quot; (Leipzig, 1889) - History of the German royal elections.

<text>Mando Diao is an alternative rock band from Borlänge, Sweden. The band got their breakthrough with the release of the album &quot;Hurricane Bar&quot;. Their main fan base is in Sweden, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and Japan. Band members are Björn Dixgård (vocals, guitar), Carl-Johan Fogelklou (bass), Daniel Haglund (keyboard) and Patrik Heinkipieti (drums).

==History==
===Early years (1999–2002)===
The roots of Mando Diao date back to 1999 when Björn Dixgård (vocals, guitar) and Daniel Haglund (keyboard) played in a band called Butler, which they had founded in the middle of the 1990s. In 1996, Gustaf Norén (vocals, guitar), joined the band. In 1999, Carl-Johan Fogelklou (bass, backing vocals) and Samuel Giers (drums) became members and completed the original band. The current line-up decided to take the project more seriously. Björn Dixgård and Gustaf Norén locked themselves up in a summer house and spent 14 months writing songs. They claim the Beatles as their original source of inspiration. Allegedly, Gustaf joined the band after he and Björn had talked all night about this band. The two renamed their band &quot;Mando Diao&quot;, a name that appeared to Björn Dixgård in a dream in which a man came up to him and shouted &quot;Mando Diao!&quot;.

Mando Diao made their first public performances in the clubs of their hometown Borlänge in 1999. A local writer described them in an article as the best unsigned band he had ever seen. This was soon followed by a record deal with EMI Sweden.

===First breakthrough (2002–05)===
The release of their debut album &quot;Bring &#x27;Em In&quot; in 2002, and of their first single &quot;Sheepdog&quot; made the band popular in Sweden; the 1960s and 1970s music style and sound as well as the singers´ voices were soon seen as the &quot;typical&quot; Mando Diao sound by their fans. Gustaf Norén once compared &quot;Bring &#x27;Em In&quot; to music by The Kooks, the Small Faces and The Kinks, declaring his band&#x27;s music best and even better than many albums by The Beatles or The Rolling Stones.&lt;br&gt;
The band began touring Sweden and other Scandinavian countries together with local bands as The Hellacopters or Kent.

Daniel Haglund left the band in 2003, due to some minor disputes, and was replaced by Mats Björke.

===International success (2005–11)===
With every album release, the band&#x27;s international success increased; in 2007 Mando Diao appeared for the first time as headliner on a music festival, the Live Earth concert in Hamburg.

After the recording of &quot;Above And Beyond - MTV unplugged&quot;, Samuel Giers left the band at the beginning of 2011. Since September 2011, Mando Diao is supported by Patrik Heikinpieti (drums) and Daniel Haglund (guitar, keyboard).

===Swedish album &quot;Infruset&quot; (2012)===
In 2011, Gustaf Norén and Björn Dixgård began working on poems written by the Swedish poet Gustaf Fröding, and setting them to music. The result, their first album in Swedish, &quot;Infruset&quot;, was highly rated and appreciated all over Europe even before the official release . On 28 October 2012, the world premiere was broadcast as a live cinema event - &quot;Mando Diao live på bio&quot; in theaters and cinemas in Sweden, Germany and Switzerland.

&quot;Infruset&quot; has turned out to be the band&#x27;s most successful album in Sweden: it has won a Swedish Grammis award, sold four times platinum in Sweden. Due to their success, the band was awarded with the Swedish Rockbjörnen, a fan award, as best livegroup in 2013.
The album has been charting on the Swedish Albums Chart for 101 weeks from November 2012 until June 2015 and is Sweden&#x27;s 9th all-time best-charting album. The single &quot;Strövtåg i hembygden&quot; remained in the Swedish radio top ten charts for 127 weeks in May 2015.

===New influences and reorientation (since 2012)===
On 23 April 2014 Mando Diao&#x27;s seventh studio album &quot;Ælita&quot; was released in Sweden; the international release was on 2 May 2014. The first single, &quot;Black Saturday&quot;, was released in Sweden on 11 January 2014. The new synth rock sound has led to many disputes amongst fans of the band and critics. The Russian synthesizer &quot;Aelita&quot; has been the source and inspiration for this album, leading away from the former music style.

On 18 November 2014, keyboard player Mats Björke officially left the band. His main focus is on working as producer in his own studio.

===Projects (2015)===
On 16 October 2014, &quot;Love Last Forever&quot;, the official song for the ski world championship 2015 in Falun, featuring Maxida Märak, a young Swedish-Sámi artist and, who by her singing and wearing Sámi clothes while performing this song is raising awareness for the minority problems in Sweden, has been presented to the public. On 15 February 2015 &quot;Love Last Forever&quot; was performed during the opening ceremony in Falun.

With their new song &quot;Leave No Trace&quot; (March 2015) Mando Diao are supporting &quot;Låt Östersjön Leva&quot; - a project under the patronage of World Wildlife Fund for Nature (WWF); the issue is the protection of the wildlife and the heavily polluted Baltic Sea.

Björn Dixgård and Gustaf Norén, who emphasized the importance of all kinds of art, have supported the annual street art and music festival &quot;164 festivalen&quot; by KFUM in Stockholm on 30 April 2015.

===New era (2015)===
On 3 June 2015, Gustaf Norén and Mando Diao separated. Norén was replaced by Jens Siverstedt on guitar and vocals.

===Albums (2017–2023)===
On 12 May 2017, Mando Diao released their eighth studio album, &quot;Good Times&quot;. The first single was released on 7 April 2017.

On 18 October 2019, &quot;BANG&quot; was released as Mando Diao&#x27;s ninth studio album, continuing the band´s rock history.

On 12 June 2020, Mando Diao returned to the Swedish language with &quot;I Solnedgången&quot; - once again revisiting the poems by Gustaf Fröding, as well as adding lyrics written by Björn Dixgård&#x27;s parents.

2022 saw the band back on the road promoting &quot;I solnedgången&quot; in the Nordics as well as releasing a string of EPs leading up the band&#x27;s 11th studio album &quot;Boblikov&#x27;s Magical World&quot;, released on 29 April 2023. Håkan Sörle was introduced as the band&#x27;s new guitarist on the show&#x27;s following the album release.

By the end of 2006, the band released a DVD called &quot;Down in the Past&quot;, a documentary of the band&#x27;s history, accompanied by rare interviews, concert snippets, backstage videos and unreleased songs. &quot;Ode to Ochrasy&quot; was released in the UK through the Nettwerk label on 2 April 2007, in a previously unreleased format including 4 bonus tracks. On 26 October 2007 the band released their fourth album &quot;Never Seen The Light Of Day&quot;.

==Touring==

Mando Diao has been touring all over the world, though their biggest following is in Germany, Japan, and their homeland Sweden. In 2004/2005, they started a tour with appearances at big music festivals in Germany, Austria and Hungary. The band supported The Bravery on their tour in 2005, along with the Los Angeles band The Colour. On their 2006 European tour, they were supported by Razorlight and Johnossi, and for the British leg of the tour they were a joint support act for the Dirty Pretty Things along with Larrikin Love.

At the end of January 2007, Mando Diao were widely covered in the Swedish media because of an incident at their live concert on 27 January 2007. They were performing at the Amplified festival at Norrlands Opera House in Umeå when a part of the floor the audience was standing on collapsed, leaving at least 25 fans hurt. Five people were taken to the hospital with injuries such as broken arms and legs. According to the management of Norrlandsoperan, the hall had been checked, but they had never thought the floor, consisting of several moveable parts on concrete girders over a hole, wouldn&#x27;t hold the 170 people in the room, since the fire department had given them approval for 800 people. After this unfortunate event, Mando Diao stayed in Umeå in case they could do anything to help the injured fans. They also visited the hospitalized fans personally.

Mando Diao appeared on 29 April 2007 at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and on 7 July 2007 they performed at the German leg of Live Earth in Hamburg. Since the summer of 2007, Mando Diao has had support from a horn section consisting of renowned Swedish jazz musicians Nils Janson and Nils Berg.

Björn Dixgård toured Europe solo during the end of 2007.

On 3 November 2008 the band played one US date for the &quot;Give Me Fire&quot; tour with the Capshuns and We Barbarians at the Troubadour in Los Angeles.

On 2 September 2010 they recorded an &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; concert at Union Film-Studios in Berlin, featuring guest appearances by Daniel Haglund, Ray Davies, Klaus Voormann, Juliette Lewis and Lana Del Rey. The concert was released on CD and DVD in late 2010.

Following the unplugged album, an acoustic tour was started in October 2011, with concerts taking place in Germany, Switzerland and Luxembourg.

In the summer of 2012, Mando Diao had appearances at four open air festivals in Croatia, Italy, Czech Republic and Hungary.

Mando Diao toured Sweden in the winter of 2013 and a Swedish summer tour (Folkparksturné) followed in the summer of 2013.

In 2014, there were appearances at open air festivals in Spain, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Netherlands and Sweden. In November 2014, an autumn tour including Sweden, Germany, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Switzerland and Austria, took place.

<text>The Australian Open is an annual tennis tournament created in 1905 and played on outdoor hard courts at Melbourne Park in Melbourne, Australia.

The women&#x27;s singles was first contested in 1922 along with the women&#x27;s and mixed doubles competition as the last three events to be added. The Australian Open is played during two weeks mid-January, and has been chronologically the first of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the tennis season since 1987. The event was not held from 1940 to 1945 because of World War II, and 1986 because Tennis Australia wanted to move the tournament start from mid-December 1986 to mid-January 1987. Margaret Court holds the all-time record for singles titles at this tournament with 11; 7 in the Amateur Era and 4 in the Open Era. Serena Williams holds the Open Era record with 7 singles titles.

==History==
Perth, Brisbane, Adelaide, Sydney, and Melbourne, Australia have all held the event. The competition switched locations every year before it settled in 1972 at the Kooyong Stadium, moving to Flinders Park, now Melbourne Park, in 1988. Several calendar changes took place for the Australian Open, from January to December in 1972 to bypass the January-to-June International Lawn Tennis Federation (ITLF) ban of World Championship Tennis (WCT) players; from late to early December in 1977 to avoid the Christmas holidays, which resulted in having two Opens in the season; and back to January, when the planned December 1986 edition was moved to early 1987, leaving no Open for the 1986 season.

An all British and an all American final were contested in 1935 and 1979 respectively, but otherwise every other final contested until 1980 featured an Australian player.

The women&#x27;s singles&#x27; rules have undergone several changes, since the first edition. This event has been contested in a knockout format, and all matches played at the best-of-three sets. Since 1922, all sets have been decided in the advantage format, with six games and two games difference. The lingering death best-of-twelve points tie-break was introduced in 1971, and used for the first two sets since then, except from 1980 to 1982, when the tie-break was also played in final sets.

The court surface changed once, from grass (1922–1987) to hard courts, since the move to Flinders Park in 1988. No tennis player has won this event on both grass and Rebound Ace; Serena Williams is the only player to win the tournament on two different surfaces, winning her first three titles on Rebound Ace and her last four on Plexicushion.

The champion receives a miniature replica of the Daphne Akhurst Memorial Cup, named after the five-time champion, which was first awarded to the champion in 1934. In 2010, the winner received prize money of A$2,100,000.

In the Australasian Championship, Margaret Molesworth (1922–1923) and Daphne Akhurst (1925–1926) co-hold the records for most wins and most consecutive wins.

In the Australian Championships, Margaret Court (1960–1966) holds the records for most titles with seven wins, and most consecutive titles with seven from (1960–1966).

In the Australian Open, Serena Williams (2003, 2005, 2007, 2009–2010, 2015, 2017) has the most victories, with seven. The record for most consecutive titles is three held by the following players: Margaret Court (1969–1971), Evonne Goolagong (1974–1976), Steffi Graf (1988–1990), Monica Seles (1991–1993), Martina Hingis (1997–1999).

Overall in the Championship&#x27;s history, Margaret Court (1960–1973) holds the records for most titles with eleven wins, and most consecutive titles with seven from (1960–1966).

This event has been won in straight sets during the Open Era of tennis by the following players: Margaret Court in 1969, 1970 and 1973, Virginia Wade in 1972, Kerry Melville Reid in 1977 January, Evonne Goolagong in 1975, 1976 and 1977 December, Chris O&#x27;Neil in 1978, Barbara Jordan in 1979, Hana Mandlíková in 1980 and 1987, Martina Navratilova in 1983, Steffi Graf in 1988, 1989 and 1994, Monica Seles in 1992 and 1996, Mary Pierce in 1995, Martina Hingis in 1997, 1998 and 1999, Lindsay Davenport in 2000, Jennifer Capriati in 2001, Amélie Mauresmo in 2006, Maria Sharapova in 2008, Victoria Azarenka in 2012, Li Na in 2014 and Serena Williams in 2007, 2009, 2015 and 2017.

<doc id="858637" wikidata="Q1968832" url="?curid=858637" title="SS Oceanic (1870)">
<text>SS &quot;Oceanic&quot; was the White Star Line&#x27;s first liner and first member of the Oceanic-class; she was an important turning point in passenger liner design. Entering service in 1871 for Atlantic crossings, she was later chartered to Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company (O&amp;O) in 1875. The ship provided passenger service for O&amp;O in the Pacific until 1895 when she was sold for scrap. 

==Design and construction==

&quot;Oceanic&quot; was built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast, and was launched on 27 August 1870, arriving in Liverpool for her maiden voyage on 26 February 1871. Powered by a combination of steam and sail, she had twelve boilers generating steam at 65 pounds-force per square inch (450 kPa) powering a single four cylinder compound steam engine, 2 x and 2 x , with a stroke of . A single funnel exhausted smoke. Four masts carried sail; square sails on the first three masts, and fore-and-aft sails on the mizzenmast, for a four-masted barque rig. The hull was constructed of iron and divided into eleven watertight compartments. A crew of 143 operated the vessel.

The &quot;Oceanic&quot; had a capacity of approximately 1,000 third-class and 166 first-class passengers, known at the time as &#x27;steerage&#x27; and &#x27;saloon&#x27; class. The White Star Line was among only a handful of trans-Atlantic passenger lines to segregate their third-class accommodations; single men were berthed in the bow while berthing for single women and families was in the stern. First-class cabins were positioned amidship, away from ocean movements and the vibration of the engines.

The contemporary press described her &quot;more an imperial yacht than a passenger liner&quot;.. Innovative features included running water and electric bells to summon stewards in the first-class cabins. Portholes in the ship were much larger than on contemporary liners, providing more light. The saloon dining room was large enough to seat all first-class passengers at once.

&quot;Oceanic&quot; was built at a cost of £120,000 () She was the first White Star ship to use a name ending with &quot;ic&quot;, beginning a naming tradition which would last for the rest of the company&#x27;s existence. She was to be the first ship of the &quot;Oceanic&quot;-class; a series of six sister ships constructed in rapid succession: , , , and . All were of the same approximate dimensions with differences in tonnage, with the exception of the &quot;Adriatic&quot; and the &quot;Celtic,&quot; the designs for which were later modified to slightly increase their sizes.

==Service history==
&quot;Oceanic&quot; left for her maiden voyage from Liverpool on 2 March 1871. This was the White Star Line&#x27;s inaugural service on the North Atlantic run against established competitors, and it initially failed to generate much custom, as &quot;Oceanic&quot; carried only 64 passengers, whilst 300 sailed on the parallel departure of the Cunard Line&#x27;s &quot;Calabria&quot;. Not long after departing, she had to return because of overheated bearings. Her voyage restarted on 16 March. When she reached New York, she was visited by 50,000 people. From that point onward, business picked up and &quot;Oceanic&quot; was a success for the White Star Line.

In January 1872, &quot;Oceanic&quot; underwent a refit, during which a large forecastle was added to help prevent the bow being inundated during high seas. Two new boilers were added to increase steam pressure and thus engine power, and the four masts were shortened.
&quot;Oceanic&quot; continued sailing with the White Star Line on the Liverpool to New York City route until 11 March 1875, when she became surplus to the company&#x27;s needs on the North Atlantic when the larger &quot;Britannic&quot; entered service. Instead, &quot;Oceanic&quot; was chartered to the Occidental and Oriental Steamship Company (O&amp;O) for service on the Pacific Ocean between San Francisco, Yokohama and Hong Kong. The White Star Line provided the officers, while the crew was Chinese. The ship itself remained in White Star Line colours, but flew the O&amp;O flag. During the repositioning voyage from Liverpool to Hong Kong, &quot;Oceanic&quot; set a speed record for that route. Later, she also set a speed record for Yokohama to San Francisco in December 1876, of 14 days, 15 hours, and then broke her own record over that route in November 1889, with a time of 13 days, 14 hours and 5 minutes.

During 1879-80 she returned to Liverpool for another major refit, which included new boilers.

On 22 August 1888, &quot;Oceanic&quot; collided with the coastal liner just outside the Golden Gate; the latter ship sank, killing 16 on board.

On 7 January 1890, Nellie Bly boarded &quot;Oceanic&quot; in Yokohama to cross the Pacific as part of her voyage &quot;Around the World in Seventy-Two Days&quot;. She arrived in San Francisco on 21 January 1890, which was a day behind schedule as a result of rough weather.

In 1895, &quot;Oceanic&quot; was returned to the White Star Line, which planned to modernise the ship, and put her back into service. She was sent back to Harland and Wolff for new engines to be installed, but when the ship was inspected closely, it was found not to be cost-effective to carry out the work. Instead, she was sold for scrap for £8,000, and left Belfast for the last time on 10 February 1896, under tow, for a scrapyard on the River Thames.

<text>The US Open women&#x27;s singles championship is an annual tennis event that has been held since 1887 as part of the US Open tournament. The tournament is played on outdoor hard courts at the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in Flushing Meadows – Corona Park, New York City.

The US Open is played during a two-week period in late August and early September and has been chronologically the last of the four Grand Slam tournaments of the tennis year since 1987. The Philadelphia Cricket Club (1887–1920) and Forest Hills (1921–1977) hosted the event before it settled in 1978 at its current site. The United States Tennis Association is the national body that organizes this event.

The champion receives a full-size replica of the event&#x27;s trophy engraved with her name. In 2022, the winner received prize money of US$2,600,000.

==History==
The format of the women&#x27;s singles event has undergone several changes since the first edition. From 1888 through 1918, the event started with a knockout phase, the All-Comers singles, whose winner faced the defending champion in a challenge round. The All-Comers winner was awarded the title by default six times (1893, 1899, 1900, 1905, 1906 and 1907) in the absence of the previous year&#x27;s champion. The challenge round system was abolished with the 1919 edition. Since 1887, all matches have been played as the best-of-three sets, except in the eleven-year period from 1891 until 1901, when the challenge round was scored the best-of-five-sets. From 1894 until 1901 the women were required to play best-of-five sets in both the all-comers final and the challenge round.

===Format===
Since 1887, the winner of the next game at five-games–all took the set in every match except the All-Comers final and the challenge round, which was won by the player who had won at least six games and at least two games more than his opponent. This advantage format was introduced for the final sets of early rounds, for women starting in 1887, and used for all sets in final rounds from 1887 through 1969. The tie-break system was introduced in 1970 for all sets, in its best-of-nine points sudden death version until 1974, and in its best-of-12 points lingering death version since 1975. The US Open is the only Grand Slam tournament to have a third set tie-break, which has occurred twice in women&#x27;s singles finals in 1981 and in 1985.

===Surface===
The court surface changed twice, from grass (1887–1974), to Har-Tru clay (1975–1977), to hard courts since 1978. No women&#x27;s tennis player won the event on all three surfaces, and no women&#x27;s tennis player won it on both grass and clay. Chris Evert was the only one to win the event on clay and on hard court, thereby making her the only woman to win on two different surfaces at the event.

==Statistics==

In the U.S. National Championships, under the challenge round format, Elisabeth Moore (1896, 1901, 1903, 1905) holds the record for most singles titles with four and Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman (1909–1911) holds the record for most consecutive women&#x27;s singles titles at three. With four consecutive singles titles each, Molla Bjurstedt Mallory (1915–1918) and Helen Jacobs (1932–1935) hold the record for most consecutive women&#x27;s singles titles won after the challenge round format was abolished. Bjurstedt Mallory&#x27;s eight singles titles (1915–1918, 1920–1922, 1926) is the all-time record.

During the US Open, since the inclusion of the professional tennis players, Chris Evert (1975–1978) holds the record for most consecutive women&#x27;s singles titles at four and the record for most overall titles at six (1975–1978, 1980, 1982) with Serena Williams (1999, 2002, 2008, 2012–2014).

This event has been won without losing a set during the open era by Margaret Court in 1969, Billie Jean King in 1971 and 1972, Evert in 1976, 1977 and 1978, Martina Navratilova in 1983 and 1987, Monica Seles in 1992, Steffi Graf in 1996, Martina Hingis in 1997, Lindsay Davenport in 1998, Venus Williams in 2001, Serena Williams in 2002, 2008 and 2014, Justine Henin in 2007 and Emma Raducanu in 2021.

<doc id="858642" wikidata="Q313550" url="?curid=858642" title="Vidal Sassoon">
<text>Vidal Sassoon (17 January 1928 – 9 May 2012) was a British hairstylist and businessman. He was noted for repopularising a simple, close-cut geometric hairstyle called the five-point cut, worn by famous fashion designers including Mary Quant and film stars such as Mia Farrow, Goldie Hawn, Cameron Diaz, Nastassja Kinski and Helen Mirren.

His early life was one of extreme poverty, with seven years of his childhood spent in an orphanage. He quit school at age 14, soon holding various jobs in London during World War II. Although he hoped to become a professional football player, he became an apprentice hairdresser at the suggestion of his mother.

After developing a reputation for his innovative cuts, he moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, where he opened the first worldwide chain of hairstyling salons, complemented by a line of hair-treatment products.

He sold his business interests in the early 1980s and began funding Israeli think tanks with his profits. In 2009, Sassoon was appointed CBE by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace. &quot;Vidal Sassoon: The Movie&quot;, a documentary film about his life, was released in 2010. In 2012, he was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork, the album cover for the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, to celebrate the British cultural figures of the prior six decades.

==Early life==
Sassoon was born to Jewish parents in Hammersmith, West London, and lived nearby in Shepherd&#x27;s Bush. His mother, Betty (Bellin) (1900–1997), an Ashkenazi Jew, was born in Aldgate, in the East End of London, in 1900. Although she was surrounded by grinding poverty, Sassoon writes that she nonetheless resolved to make the best of her life. Her family had emigrated to England from Russian Empire in the 1880s to escape the antisemitism and pogroms then prevalent. His father, Jack Sassoon, a Sephardi Jew, was born in Thessaloniki, in the northern part of Greece. They met in 1925 and married in 1927. They then moved to Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, which contained a community of Greek Jews. Sassoon had a younger brother, Ivor.

His father abandoned the family for another woman when Vidal was three years old. With his mother now unable to support the family, they fell into poverty and were evicted, becoming suddenly homeless. They were forced to move in with his mother&#x27;s older sister. There, they shared a two-room tenement with his aunt and her three children. The tiny flat where the seven of them lived had no bathroom or inside toilet, forcing them to share the one outside landing toilet with three other families. He remembered often standing in line to use it in freezing weather. Their roof was also falling apart, which let rain pour through. &quot;All we could see from our windows was the greyness of the tenement across the street&quot;, writes Sassoon. &quot;There was ugliness all around.&quot;

Due to poverty as a single parent, his mother eventually placed Sassoon and his younger brother in a Jewish orphanage, where they stayed for seven years, until he was 11, when his mother remarried. His mother was only allowed to visit them once a month and was never allowed to take them out.

===Education===
He attended Essendine Road Primary School, a Christian school of about a thousand children. He was frequently taunted by classmates as a &quot;Yid&quot; or with chants of &quot;All Jews have long noses.&quot; One of his proudest days at the school was winning the 100-yard dash in an all-school contest. &quot;The urge to win has never left me&quot;, he writes.
However, he says that he was &quot;a very bad student&quot; with abysmal grades in most classes, except for mental arithmetic. After one session of mental arithmetic, his master said teasingly, &quot;Sassoon, it is a pleasure to see that you have gaps of intelligence between bouts of ignorance.&quot; He took a volunteer job as a choir boy for the local synagogue, which gave him one of the few chances to see his mother, who would come on Saturdays.

Sassoon and the other children at the school were evacuated after WWII began on 3 September 1939. He was 11 years old. &quot;It&#x27;s a date I&#x27;ll never forget&quot;, he said. &quot;Suddenly my brother and I and all our fellow orphans were on trains with hundreds of thousands of other kids, moving out of London.&quot; He and his brother were taken to Holt, Wiltshire, a small village of a thousand people.

=== First jobs ===

After his return to London he left school at the age of 14 and worked as a messenger. The war was in full force with London still being bombed, which forced him to sleep in underground shelters. During work hours, he said &quot;I got used to seeing bodies and blood, and hearing cries of agony&quot; as he carried messages from central London to the docks.

Upon the insistence of his mother, they tried to get him into a hairdressing apprenticeship; his mother told him that her ambition was for him to become a professional hairdresser. However, he saw himself becoming a football player, a sport he excelled at. &quot;I could not imagine myself backcombing hair and winding up rollers for a living.&quot;

When she took him to the hairdressing school of a well-known stylist, Adolph Cohen, they were disappointed immediately when they were told it was a two-year programme and would cost much more than they could afford. &quot;My mother looked so terribly dejected&quot;, he said, that as they left the salon, &quot;I thought she might faint.&quot; A few minutes later, Cohen called them back to the salon, then told him, &quot;You seem to have very good manners, young man. Start Monday and forget the cost.&quot; His mother began to cry out of joy.

===Wartime activities===
At the age of 17, although he had been too young to serve in World War II, he became the youngest member of the 43 Group, a Jewish veterans&#x27; underground organisation founded by Morris Beckman which broke up fascist meetings in East London to prevent Sir Oswald Mosley&#x27;s movement from spreading &quot;messages of hatred&quot; in the period following World War II.

In 1948, at the age of 20, he joined the Palmach (which shortly afterwards was integrated into the Israel Defense Forces) and fought in the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, which began after Israel declared statehood. Sassoon arrived in Mandatory Palestine in April 1948, a month before Israeli independence. He fought in the Negev against the Egyptian Army. During an interview, he described the year he spent training with the Israelis as &quot;the best year of my life&quot;, and recalled how he felt:

==Career==
Sassoon resumed his hairdressing training under Raymond Bessone in his salon in Mayfair. Sassoon opened his first salon in 1954 in London; singer-actress Georgia Brown, his friend and neighbour, claimed to be his first customer.

Sassoon stated his intentions in designing new, more efficient, hair styles: &quot;If I was going to be in hairdressing, I wanted to change things. I wanted to eliminate the superfluous and get down to the basic angles of cut and shape.&quot; Sassoon&#x27;s works include the geometric perm and the &quot;Nancy Kwan&quot; hairstyles. They were all modern and low-maintenance. The hairstyles created by Sassoon relied on dark, straight, and shiny hair cut into geometric yet organic shapes. Peggy Moffitt’s hairstyle, an asymmetrical bowl cut created by Sassoon, became known as the &quot;five point&quot;.

In 1964, Sassoon created a short, angular hairstyle cut on a horizontal plane that was the recreation of the classic &quot;bob cut.&quot; His geometric haircuts seemed to be severely cut, but were entirely lacquer-free, relying on the natural shine of the hair for effect. Advertising and cosmetics executive Natalie Donay is credited with discovering Sassoon in London and bringing him to the United States, where in 1965, he opened his first New York City salon on Madison Avenue.

In 1966, inspired by 1920s film star Clara Bow&#x27;s close cropped hair, he created designs for Emanuel Ungaro. Director Roman Polanski brought him to Hollywood from London in 1968, at a cost of $5,000 (), to create a unique pixie cut for Mia Farrow, who was to star in &quot;Rosemary&#x27;s Baby.&quot;

In the early 1970s, Sassoon made Los Angeles his home. In 1971, he promoted his 30-year-old second-in-command, artistic director Roger Thompson, to director of the Sassoon salon, explaining jocularly that, &quot;Twenty-five years of schlepping behind a barber chair are enough!&quot; John Paul DeJoria, a friend of Sassoon, co-founded Paul Mitchell Systems with Paul Mitchell, one of Sassoon&#x27;s former students. Mitchell said that Sassoon was &quot;the most famous hairstylist in the history of the world.&quot;
Sassoon began his &quot;Vidal Sassoon&quot; line of hair-care products in 1973. The actor Michael Caine, who when young and struggling &quot;was roommates with Terence Stamp and Vidal Sassoon – he used to cut my hair, and he always had a lot of models around&quot;, claimed to have inspired this, saying, &quot;I told him that he must have something that is working for him while he slept. I told him he had to make shampoos and other hair-care products.&quot; Whatever the inspiration, Sassoon&#x27;s brand was applied to shampoos and conditioners sold worldwide, with a commercial campaign featuring the slogan &quot;If &quot;you&quot; don&#x27;t look good, &quot;we&quot; don&#x27;t look good.&quot; Former salon colleagues also bought Sassoon&#x27;s salons and acquired the right to use his name, extending the brand in salons into the United Kingdom and the United States.

The El Paso, Texas-based Helen of Troy Corporation began manufacturing and marketing Sassoon hair-care products in 1980. In 1983, Richardson-Vicks purchased the Los Angeles-based Vidal Sassoon Inc. as well as Sassoon&#x27;s Santa Monica, California, hairdressing school; the company had already bought his European businesses. Sassoon&#x27;s 1982 sales of hair products had topped $110 million, with 80 percent of revenues derived in the US.

Two years later the company was bought by Procter &amp; Gamble. Sassoon, who remained a consultant through at least the mid-1990s, sued P&amp;G in 2003 for breach of contract and fraud in federal court for allegedly neglecting the marketing of his brand name in favour of the company&#x27;s other hair product lines, such as Pantene.

He sold his business interests in the early 1980s to devote himself to philanthropy. By 2004, it was reported that Sassoon was no longer associated with the brand that bears his name. He also had a short-lived television series called &quot;Your New Day with Vidal Sassoon&quot;, which aired in 1980.

Sassoon was twice a guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, on 27 June 1970 and 9 October 2011, when he was also Resident Thinker on the Nowhereisland art project. He was a mystery guest on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; in March 1967.

== Honours ==
Sassoon was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) by Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace in the 2009 Birthday Honours.

==Personal life==
Sassoon was married four times, first to Elaine Wood, his salon receptionist, in 1956; the marriage ended in 1958. In 1967, he married actress Beverly Adams, whom he met while filming &quot;Torture Garden&quot; (1967). They had three biological children and one adopted son, including daughter Catya Sassoon and Adams divorced after 13 years of marriage. His third wife was Jeanette Hartford-Davis, a dressage champion and former fashion model; they married in 1983 and divorced soon after. In 1992, he married designer Rhonda &quot;Ronnie&quot; Sassoon.

===Philanthropy===
Sassoon had a lifelong commitment to eradicating anti-Semitism. He started the Vidal Sassoon International Center for the Study of Antisemitism, or SICSA, in 1982. Located at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, it is devoted to gathering information about antisemitism worldwide.

After selling his company, he worked towards philanthropic causes such as the Boys Clubs of America and the Performing Arts Council of the Music Center of Los Angeles via his Vidal Sassoon Foundation. He was also active in supporting relief efforts after Hurricane Katrina. His eponymous foundation also funded educational pursuits on a need-basis in Israel and elsewhere. At the time of his death, he had academies in England, Canada and the United States, while planning to open locations in Germany and China.

==Illness and death==
In June 2011, it was reported that Sassoon had been diagnosed with leukemia two years earlier. He died from the disease on 9 May 2012 at his home in Bel Air, Los Angeles, in the presence of his family. A memorial service was planned for a later date.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Vidal was like Christopher Columbus&quot;, said Angus Mitchell, who studied under Sassoon. &quot;He discovered that the world was round with his cutting system. It was the first language that people could follow.&quot; Neil Cornelius, the incumbent owner of Sassoon&#x27;s first solo venture, called him a &quot;hairdressing legend&quot;.

Grace Coddington, Sassoon&#x27;s former model and creative director of American &quot;Vogue&quot;, said that he changed the way the public looked at hair:

John Barrett of the John Barrett Salon at Bergdorf Goodman said that Sassoon &quot;was the creator of sensual hair. This was somebody who changed our industry entirely, not just from the point of view of cutting hair but actually turning it into a business. He was one of the first who had a product line bought out by a major corporation&quot;.

<doc id="858653" wikidata="Q18816667" url="?curid=858653" title="Myopsida">
<text>Myopsida is one of the four orders of squid. It consists of two families: the monotypic &quot;Australiteuthis&quot; and the diverse and commercially important Loliginidae (~50 species). Some taxonomists classify this taxon as a suborder of the order Teuthida, in which case it is known as Myopsina. This reclassification is due to Myopsina and Oegopsina not being demonstrated to form a clade.

A number of morphological features distinguish members of Myopsida from those of its sister group, Oegopsida. Some of the most obvious differences are found in the structure of the eyes: those of myopsid squids lack a secondary eyelid and are instead covered by a transparent corneal membrane, the opening of which is reduced to a microscopic anterior pore in most species. The arms and tentacles are ornamented with simple suckers (hooks are never present), with additional suckers usually borne on the buccal lappets. The carpal (&quot;wrist&quot;) portion of the tentacular club lacks a locking apparatus, and a tentacle pocket is present on the head. The funnel has no lateral adductor muscles. An internalised shell is present in the form of a well-developed gladius, which is located dorsally within the mantle and extends for almost its entire length. In contrast to oegopsids, females possess accessory nidamental glands in addition to the main nidamental glands. They however lack a right oviduct.

Myopsids are found in coastal waters worldwide. They are demersal, generally feeding on or near the bottom. In turn, they are considered prey items by virtually all marine predators, including birds.

Adult sizes range from the dwarf &quot;Australiteuthis&quot; and &quot;Pickfordiateuthis&quot;, whose males mature at less than in mantle length (ML), to the largest species &quot;Loligo forbesii&quot;, which has been measured to ML. The earliest fossils of this group are &quot;Loligo&quot; statoliths from the early Eocene of North America. In addition, a pyritized &quot;Loligo&quot; fossil is known from the Oligocene of Russia, marking the earliest true squid known from a complete body fossil.

<text>In economics, a luxury good (or upmarket good) is a good for which demand increases more than what is proportional as income rises, so that expenditures on the good become a more significant proportion of overall spending. Luxury goods are in contrast to necessity goods, where demand increases proportionally less than income. &quot;Luxury goods&quot; is often used synonymously with superior goods.

==Definition and etymology==
The word &quot;luxury&quot; derives from the Latin verb &quot;luxor&quot; meaning to overextend or strain. From this, the noun &quot;luxuria&quot; and verb &quot;luxurio&quot; developed, &quot;indicating immoderate growth, swelling, ... in persons and animals, willful or unruly behavior, disregard for moral restraints, and licensciousness&quot;, and the term has had negative connotations for most of its long history. One definition in the OED is a &quot;thing desirable but not necessary&quot;. A luxury good can be identified by comparing the demand for the good at one point in time against the demand for the good at a different time, at a different income level. When personal income increases, demand for luxury goods increases even more than income does.

Conversely, when personal income decreases, demand for luxury goods drops even more than income does. For example, if income rises 1%, and the demand for a product rises 2%, then the product is a luxury good. This contrasts with &quot;necessity goods&quot;, or &quot;basic goods&quot;, for which demand stays the same or decreases only slightly as income decreases.

===Scope of the term===
With increasing accessibility to luxury goods, new product categories have been created within the luxury market, called &quot;accessible luxury&quot; or &quot;mass luxury&quot;. These are meant specifically for the middle class, sometimes called the &quot;aspiring class&quot; in this context. Because luxury has diffused into the masses, defining the word has become more difficult.

Whereas luxury often refers to certain types of products, luxury is not restricted to physical goods; services can also be luxury. Likewise, from the consumer perspective, luxury is an experience defined as &quot;hedonic escapism&quot;.

===Confusion with normal goods===
&quot;Superior goods&quot; is the gradable antonym of &quot;inferior good&quot;. If the quantity of an item demanded increases with income, but not by enough to increase the share of the budget spent on it, then it is only a normal good and is not a superior good. Consumption of all normal goods increases as income increases. For example, if income increases by 50%, then consumption will increase (maybe by only 1%, maybe by 40%, maybe by 70%). A superior good is a normal good for which the proportional consumption increase exceeds the proportional income increase. So, if income increases by 50%, then consumption of a superior good will increase by more than 50% (maybe 51%, maybe 70%).

In economics terminology, all goods with an income elasticity of demand greater than zero are &quot;normal&quot;, but only the subset having income elasticity of demand &gt; 1 are &quot;superior&quot;.

Some articles in the microeconomics discipline use the term &quot;superior good&quot; as an alternative to an &quot;inferior good&quot;, thus making &quot;superior goods&quot; and &quot;normal goods&quot; synonymous. Where this is done, a product making up an increasing share of spending under income increases is often called an &quot;ultra-superior good&quot;.

===Art history===
Though often verging on the meaningless in modern marketing, &quot;luxury&quot; remains a legitimate and current technical term in art history for objects that are especially highly decorated to very high standards and use expensive materials. The term is especially used for medieval manuscripts to distinguish between practical working books for normal use, and fully illuminated manuscripts, that were often bound in treasure bindings with metalwork and jewels. These are often much larger, with less text on each page and many illustrations, and if liturgical texts were originally usually kept on the altar or sacristy rather any library that the church or monastery who owned them may have had. Secular luxury manuscripts were commissioned by the very wealthy and differed in the same ways from cheaper books.

&quot;Luxury&quot; and &quot;luxury arts&quot; may be used for other applied arts where both utilitarian and luxury versions of the same types of objects were made. This might cover metalwork, ceramics, glass, arms and armor, and various objects. It is much less used for objects from the fine arts, with no function beyond being an artwork: paintings, drawings, and sculpture, even though the disparity in cost between an expensive and cheap work may have been as large.

== History==

An awareness of a concept of luxury dates back at least as far as Plato.

==Market==

===Characteristics===
Luxury goods have high income elasticity of demand: as people become wealthier, they will buy proportionately more luxury goods. This also means that should there be a decline in income, its demand will drop more than proportionately. The income elasticity of demand is not constant with respect to income and may change signs at different income levels. That is to say, a luxury good may become a necessity good or even an inferior good at different income levels.

Some luxury products have been claimed to be examples of Veblen goods, with a positive price elasticity of demand: for example, making a perfume more expensive can increase its perceived value as a luxury good to such an extent that sales can go up, rather than down. However, Veblen goods are not synonymous with luxury goods.

Although the technical term luxury good is independent of the goods&#x27; quality, they are generally considered to be goods at the highest end of the market in terms of quality and price. Many markets have a luxury segment including, for example, luxury versions of automobiles, yachts, wine, bottled water, coffee, tea, foods, watches, clothes, jewelry, cosmetics and high fidelity sound equipment. Luxuries may be services. Hiring full-time or live-in domestic servants is a luxury reflecting income disparities. Some financial services, especially in some brokerage houses, can be considered luxury services by default because persons in lower-income brackets generally do not use them.

Luxury goods often have special luxury packaging to differentiate the products from mainstream competitors.

===Trends===
Originally, luxury goods were available only to the very wealthy and &quot;aristocratic world of old money&quot; that offered them a history of tradition, superior quality, and a pampered buying experience. Luxury goods have been transformed by a shift from custom-made (bespoke) works with exclusive distribution practices by specialized, quality-minded family-run and small businesses to a mass production of specialty branded goods by profit-focused large corporations and marketers. The trend in modern luxury is simply a product or service that is marketed, packaged, and sold by global corporations that are focused &quot;on growth, visibility, brand awareness, advertising, and, above all, profits.&quot; Increasingly, luxury logos are now available to all consumers at a premium price across the world, including online.

Global consumer companies, such as Procter &amp; Gamble, are also attracted to the industry due to the difficulty of making a profit in the mass consumer goods market. The customer base for various luxury goods continue to be more culturally diversified, and this presents more unseen challenges and new opportunities to companies in this industry.

There are several trends in luxury:
* &quot;Democratization of luxury.&quot; Also known as masstige (from mass-prestige), is a marketing strategy that aims to make brands prestigious while retaining their affordability.
* &quot;Globalization:&quot; Consumers in some countries are becoming wealthier; thus, new markets are opening for luxury marketers. Reports by consulting agencies like McKinsey predicted that East Asia would become the world&#x27;s largest personal luxury goods market. China will consume half the global market value of luxury goods.
* &quot;Consolidation:&quot; Consolidation involves the growth of big companies and ownership of brands across many segments of luxury products. Examples include Kering, LVMH, and Richemont, which dominate the market in areas ranging from luxury drinks to fashion and cosmetics.
* &quot;Luxury brand collaborations.&quot; This marketing strategy demonstrates the potential of unexpected partnerships and co-branding opportunities between luxury brands and an unconventional partner seemingly at the opposite end of the design spectrum. Collaborations include pairings of luxury brands like &quot;Fendi x Versace&quot; but also pairings with streetwear brands including skateboarding brand &quot;Supreme x LVMH&quot;, with celebrities such as &quot;Bad Bunny x Adidas&quot;, anime characters like &quot;Doraemon x Gucci&quot;, and now video game franchises like &quot;Fortnite x Balenciaga&quot;. The collaborations are often limited edition collections.

===Size===
The luxury goods market has been on an upward climb for many years. Apart from the setback caused by the 1997 Asian Financial Crisis, the industry has performed well, particularly in 2000. That year, the world luxury goods market was worth nearly $170 billion and grew 7.9 percent. The United States has been the largest regional market for luxury goods. The largest sector in this category was luxury drinks, including premium whisky, champagne, and cognac. The watches and jewelry section showed the strongest performance, growing in value by 23.3 percent, while the clothing and accessories section grew 11.6 percent between 1996 and 2000, to $32.8 billion. The largest ten markets for luxury goods account for 83 percent of overall sales and include Brazil, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, Spain, Switzerland and United Kingdom, and United States.

In 2012, China surpassed Japan as the world&#x27;s largest luxury market. China&#x27;s luxury consumption accounts for over 25% of the global market. According to the Global Wealth and Lifestyle Report 2020, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo and Singapore were four of the five most expensive cities for luxury goods in Asia. In 2014, the luxury sector was expected to grow over the following ten years because of 440 million consumers spending a total of 880 billion euros, or $1.2 trillion.

===Advertising===
The advertising expenditure for the average luxury brand is 5-15% of sales revenue, or about 25% with the inclusion of other communications such as public relations, events, and sponsorships.

A rather small group in comparison, the wealthy tend to be extremely influential. Once a brand gets an &quot;endorsement&quot; from members of this group, then the brand can be defined as a true &quot;luxury&quot; brand. An example of different product lines in the same brand is found in the automotive industry, with &quot;entry-level&quot; cars marketed to younger, less wealthy consumers, and higher-cost models for older and more wealthy consumers.

==Economics==

In economics, superior goods or luxury goods make up a larger &quot;proportion&quot; of consumption as income rises, and therefore are a type of normal goods in consumer theory. Such a good must possess two economic characteristics: it must be scarce, and, along with that, it must have a high price. The scarcity of the good can be natural or artificial; however, the general population (i.e., consumers) must recognize the good as distinguishably &quot;better&quot;. Possession of such a good usually signifies &quot;superiority&quot; in resources and is usually accompanied by prestige.

A Veblen good is a superior good with a prestige value so high that a price decline might &quot;lower&quot; demand. Veblen&#x27;s contribution is demonstrated by the significance of the Veblen effect, which refers to the phenomenon of people purchasing costly items even when more affordable options that provide similar levels of satisfaction are available.

The income elasticity of a superior good is above one by definition because it raises the expenditure share as income rises. A superior good may also be a luxury good that is not purchased below a certain income level. Examples would include smoked salmon, caviar, and most other delicacies. On the other hand, superior goods may have a wide quality distribution, such as wine and holidays. However, though the &quot;number&quot; of such goods consumed may stay constant even with rising wealth, the level of spending will go up to secure a better experience.

A higher income inequality leads to higher consumption of luxury goods because of status anxiety.

==Socioeconomic significance==
Several manufactured products attain the status of &quot;luxury goods&quot; due to their design, quality, durability, or performance, which are superior to comparable substitutes.

Some goods are perceived as luxurious by the public simply because they play the role of status symbols, as such goods tend to signify the purchasing power of those who acquire them. These items, while not necessarily being better (in quality, performance, or appearance) than their less expensive substitutes, are purchased with the main purpose of displaying wealth or income of their owners. These kinds of goods are the objects of a socio-economic phenomenon called &quot;conspicuous consumption&quot; and commonly include luxury cars, watches, jewelry, designer clothing, yachts, private jets, corporate helicopters as well as large residences, urban mansions, and country houses.

==Luxury brands==
The idea of a luxury brand is not necessarily a product or a price point, but a mindset where core values that are expressed by a brand are directly connected to the producer&#x27;s dedication and alignment to perceptions of quality with its customers&#x27; values and aspirations. Thus, it is these target customers, not the product, that make a luxury brand. Brands considered luxury connect with their customers by communicating that they are at the top of their class or considered the best in their field. Furthermore, these brands must deliver – in some meaningful way – measurably better performance.

What consumers perceive as luxurious brands and products change over the years, but there appear to be three main drivers: (1) a high price, especially when compared to other brands within its segment; (2) limited supply, in that a brand may not need to be expensive, but it arguably should not be easily obtainable and contributing to the customers&#x27; feeling that they have something special; and (3) endorsement by celebrities, which can make a brand or particular products more appealing for consumers and thus more &quot;luxurious&quot; in their minds. Two additional elements of luxury brands include special packaging and personalization. These differentiating elements distance the brands from the mass market and thus provide them with a unique feeling and user experience as well as a special and memorable &quot;luxury feel&quot; for customers.

Examples include LVMH, the largest luxury goods producer in the world with over fifty brands (including Louis Vuitton) and sales of €42.6 billion in 2017, Kering, which made €15.9 billion in revenue for a net income of €2.3 billion in 2019, and Richemont.

The luxury brand concept is now so popular that it is used in almost every retail, manufacturing, and service sector. New marketing concepts such as &quot;mass-luxury&quot; or &quot;hyper luxury&quot; further blur the definition of what is a luxury product, a luxury brand, or a luxury company. Lately, luxury brands have extended their reach to young consumers through &quot;unconventional luxury brand collaborations&quot; in which luxury brands partner with non-luxury brands seemingly at the opposite spectrum of design, image, and value. For example, luxury fashion houses partner with streetwear brands and video games.

== Luxury boutiques ==
The sale of luxury goods requires a high level of client service, human touch, and brand consistency. Since the early 2010s, many luxury brands have invested in their own boutiques rather than wholesalers like department stores. Three of the world’s biggest luxury conglomerates— LVMH, Kering, and Richemont — significantly increased the share of annual sales captured from their directly operated stores and e-commerce over the past decade.

Luxury brands use distinct boutique types to tailor the experiences of different client groups.

=== Flagship boutiques ===
Flagship boutiques are grand, multi-story boutiques in major cities that are merchandised with a wide range of collections and staffed by a large team of sales associates. They also offer supplemental services, like jewelry cleaning, hot stamping, on-site service.

Many luxury brands use flagship boutiques to illustrate their unique vision or heritage, often through distinctive architecture that transforms them from storefronts to tourist attractions. 

=== Secondary boutiques ===
Large cities often have secondary boutiques in addition to their flagship boutique. Multiple boutiques allow luxury brands to cater to different types of clients, which can differ even within small geographic areas. Secondary boutiques often offer different merchandise than flagship boutiques, and establish different types of relationships with clients. 

Luxury boutiques in smaller cities are often secondary boutiques as well. The rising popularity of secondary and tertiary cities around the world has pushed luxury brands to open secondary boutiques in smaller cities than those that can support a flagship boutique.

=== Seasonal boutiques ===
Luxury brands use seasonal boutiques to follow their well-heeled clientele as they leave major cities for smaller resort towns in the summer and winter. Common throughout Europe, seasonal boutiques have short-term leases, like a pop-up shop, which are open only during the resort&#x27;s high season. These boutiques offer merchandise relevant to the resort where they are located, like a cruise collection in a beach resort or skiwear in a mountain resort.

==Luxury department stores==

Since the development of mass-market &quot;luxury&quot; brands in the 1800s. Extraordinary places will be the factor of development that can be achieved by enabling the conversion of items from the mass-market to the luxury market.

Many innovative technologies are being added to mass-market products and then transformed into luxury items to be placed in department stores.

Department stores that sell major luxury brands have opened up in most major cities worldwide. Le Bon Marché in Paris, France is credited as one of the first of its kind.

In the United States, the development of luxury-oriented department stores not only changed the retail industry, but also ushered the idea of freedom through consumerism, and a new opportunity for middle- and upper-class women.

== Celebrity influence on luxury goods ==
Celebrities have played a transformative role in elevating the appeal and desirability of luxury goods, acting as key drivers of consumer trends in the global market. With the advent of social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, their influence has grown exponentially, creating an immediate impact on consumer behavior. Posts and appearances featuring luxury items often lead to global trends, with high-end brands gaining significant visibility and desirability.

=== Jewelry and accessories ===
Luxury jewelry, particularly diamond rings, has benefited immensely from celebrity influence. High-profile figures, including Beyoncé, Jennifer Lopez, and Victoria Beckham, have popularized extravagant diamond rings, especially for engagements and anniversaries. Public appearances showcasing such pieces often inspire consumer interest in similar designs, driving demand for both custom and branded luxury jewelry.

=== Designer apparel and accessories ===
Red carpet events, such as the Academy Awards, Cannes Film Festival, and Met Gala, serve as platforms for celebrities to present the latest offerings from high-end fashion houses. For instance, Zendaya’s collaborations with Valentino and Bulgari have reinforced these brands’ status as symbols of opulence. Such visibility enhances brand recognition and boosts sales among consumers eager to emulate celebrity styles.

=== Luxury perfumes and watches ===
Luxury perfumes and watches have long leveraged celebrity endorsements to solidify their market presence. For example, George Clooney&#x27;s association with Omega watches and Charlize Theron’s campaign for Dior’s J&#x27;adore perfume exemplify how celebrity partnerships create a strong emotional connection with products. These endorsements often result in increased sales and further embed these items as essentials in the luxury sector.

<text>Jim Sheridan (born 6 February 1949) is an Irish playwright and filmmaker. Between 1989 and 1993, Sheridan directed three critically acclaimed films set in Ireland, &quot;My Left Foot&quot; (1989), &quot;The Field&quot; (1990), and &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; (1993), and later directed the films &quot;The Boxer&quot; (1997), &quot;In America&quot; (2003), and &quot;Brothers&quot; (2009). Sheridan has received six Academy Award nominations for his work.

==Life and career==
Jim Sheridan was born in Dublin on 6 February 1949. He is the brother of playwright Peter Sheridan. The family ran a lodging house, while Anna Sheridan worked at a hotel and Peter Sheridan Snr was a railway clerk with CIÉ. Sheridan&#x27;s early education was at a Christian Brothers school. In 1969 he attended University College Dublin to study English and History. In 1972, he graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English. He became involved in student theatre there, where he met Neil Jordan, who also was later to become an important Irish film director. After graduating from UCD in 1972, Sheridan and his brother began writing and staging plays, and in the late 1970s began working with the Project Theatre Company.

In 1981, Sheridan emigrated to Canada, but eventually settled in the Hell&#x27;s Kitchen section of New York City in the United States. He enrolled in the New York University Tisch School of the Arts and became the artistic director of the Irish Arts Center.

Sheridan returned to Ireland in the late 1980s. In 1989, he directed &quot;My Left Foot&quot; (with Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker), which became a critical and commercial success and won Day-Lewis and Fricker Academy Awards. He followed that with &quot;The Field&quot; (with Richard Harris) in 1990; then with &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot; in 1993, a fictionalised re-telling of the case of the Guildford Four. The film won the Golden Bear at the 44th Berlin International Film Festival.

In 1996 he co-wrote &quot;Some Mother&#x27;s Son&quot; with Terry George. &quot;The Boxer&quot; was nominated for a Golden Globe for best film drama in 1997. The film was Sheridan&#x27;s third collaboration with Day-Lewis after &quot;My Left Foot&quot; and &quot;In the Name of the Father&quot;, making him the only director to work with Day-Lewis on three films. In 2003, he released the semi-autobiographical &quot;In America&quot;, which tells the story of a family of Irish immigrants trying to succeed in New York. The film received positive reviews and earned Samantha Morton and Djimon Hounsou Academy Award nominations. In 2005 he released &quot;Get Rich or Die Tryin&#x27;&quot;, a film starring rap star 50 Cent.

Sheridan directed the 2009 film &quot;Brothers&quot;, starring Tobey Maguire, Jake Gyllenhaal, and Natalie Portman, which was shot in New Mexico. He also directed the thriller &quot;Dream House&quot;, which starred Daniel Craig, Naomi Watts, and Rachel Weisz.

<doc id="858684" wikidata="Q469090" url="?curid=858684" title="Lynne Truss">
<text>Lynne Truss (born 31 May 1955) is an English author, journalist, novelist, and radio broadcaster and dramatist. She champions correctness and aesthetics in the English language, which is the subject of her 2003 book, &quot;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation&quot;. The book was inspired by a BBC Radio 4 show about punctuation, &quot;Cutting a Dash&quot;, which she presented.

Besides her promotion of linguistic prescription and commentary on English grammar, Truss has written many radio plays, both comedic and dramatic. She has also written grammar guides for children and novels, including crime fiction. She was inducted into the Detection Club in 2021.

==Early life==
Truss was born on 31 May 1955 in Kingston upon Thames. She was educated at the Tiffin Girls&#x27; School and University College London, where she was awarded a first-class degree in English Language and Literature.

==Career==
Truss began her media career as a literary editor. She then spent six years as a television critic for &quot;The Times&quot;, before moving into sports journalism for the same newspaper. She spent four years in the latter field and in 2009 wrote a book about her experiences with it, &quot;Get Her Off the Pitch: How Sport Took Over My Life&quot;.

==Politics==
In August 2014, Truss was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

<text>The IBM 407 Accounting Machine, introduced in 1949, was one of a long line of IBM tabulating machines dating back to the days of Herman Hollerith. It had a card reader and printer; a summary punch could be attached. Processing was directed by a control panel.

The 407 was the central component of many unit record equipment shops which were the mainstay of IBM&#x27;s business at the time. It could print digits, letters and several special characters in any of 120 print positions, spaced .

IBM stopped marketing the 407 Accounting Machine in 1976.

==Description==

The 407 read punched cards, totaled fields on the cards, made simple decisions, printed results, and, with the aid of a summary punch, output results on punched cards that could be input to other processing steps.

The operation of the 407 was directed by the use of a removable control panel and a carriage tape. Exit hubs (impulse emitting) on the control panel are wired to entry hubs (impulse accepting) for the task to be done (see Wiring of unit record equipment). There are hubs for each card column (at both reading stations), print position, counter digit, and so on. Logic tests were also available.

Each input card was read at two successive reading stations. Thus, for example, fields in a card could be compared with the following card and, should a change be detected, say in invoice number, totals could be printed. Unlike earlier IBM tabulating machines, which had 80 read brushes at each read station, one for each column, the 407 had 960 brushes at each station, one for each possible hole in a punched card. Cards were held in position during each read cycle and the per digit pulses needed were generated using commutators, one for each column. This allowed the card to be read more than once at each station, for greater flexibility.

For printing, the 407 used type wheels, an improvement over earlier tabulators that used print bars. The 48-character wheels were stationary until a character impulse was to be printed; the wheel then rotated in two steps. the first step rotated each wheel to one of 12 groups of characters based on the digit impulse associated with that print position. Digit impulses included the digits 1 through 9 (in reverse order), the 8-3 and 8-4 combination punches and a group (N) for no digit impulse. One of four characters in each group was then selected based on the zone impulse (0, 11, 12 or none) for that character position. This selection happened at the same time the type wheel was driven against the ribbon. The timing of the zone impulse selection was controlled by a complex set of linkages and electromagnets called the Analyzer, one for each of the 120 print positions. Each type wheel also emitted an impulse (called &quot;echo&quot;) for the character actually printed. The control panel could be wired so the echo impulses were accumulated for totals; report totals then reliably reflected what had actually been printed.

Mechanical systems including the card reader, printer, counters and storage units were all driven by a single motor, which also drove an oil pump and a generator that provided 46-volt power for the electrical logic. This included about 900 relays which were mounted on three swing-out gates. The control panel had a matrix of 43 by 52 holes, most of which were assigned.

The 407 was available in a model that could read 100 cards per minute, and one reading 150 cards per minute. The former had a relay which would inhibit every third card feed cycle (giving the machine a characteristic &quot;shrink-shrink-thunk&quot; sound). It was possible to insert a folded card between that relay&#x27;s contacts to &quot;overclock&quot; the slower model to the faster speed.

==Market impact==
The 407 rented from $800 to $920 per month ($ to $ per month in dollars), depending on the model. 

Its print mechanism was used in the IBM 716 introduced in 1952 with the IBM 701 computer, and the 716 was used with many machines in the IBM 700/7000 series. The 407 itself was adapted as an input/output unit on the IBM 650. Later, the 407 print mechanism was used in the IBM 1132 line printer, part of the low cost IBM 1130 computer system, introduced in 1965.

The IBM World Trade Corporation marketed &quot;Computing Accounting Machines&quot; (CAM), variations of either the IBM 402 or 407 with an attached computer. CAM variations of the 407 included the IBM 421, 444, and 447.

<text>Ulrich von Hutten (21 April 1488 – 29 August 1523) was a German knight, scholar, poet and satirist, who later became a follower of Martin Luther and a Protestant reformer.

By 1519, he was an outspoken critic of the Roman Catholic Church. Hutten was a bridge between the Renaissance humanists and the Lutheran Reformation. He was a leader of the knights of the Holy Roman Empire along with Franz von Sickingen. Both were the leaders in the Knights&#x27; War.

==Biography==
His life may be divided into four parts: his youth and cloister life (1488–1504); his wanderings in pursuit of knowledge (1504–1515); his strife with Ulrich of Württemberg (1515–1519); and his connection with the Reformation (1510–1523).

===Youth and cloister life===
Hutten was born in Steckelberg Castle, now in Schlüchtern, Hesse. He was the eldest son of a poor but not undistinguished knightly family. As he was small of stature and sickly his father destined him for the monastic life, and, when he was ten years old, his father placed him at the nearby Princely Abbey of Fulda as an oblate to the Benedictine monks. Fulda Abbey was home to the St Rabanus Maurus School, a highly regarded institution throughout Germany, and Hutten received an excellent education. However, he disliked the restrictive nature of the monastic life, and in 1505 fled to Cologne. He thus obtained his freedom, but incurred the undying anger of his father.

===Pursuit of knowledge===
In Cologne, Hutten met Hoogstraten, Johannes Rhagius (also known as Johannes Aesticampianus), and other scholars and poets. In 1506, he went to Erfurt, but soon after rejoined Rhagius at Frankfurt an der Oder where a new university was opening. There he took his master&#x27;s degree and published his first poem. In 1507, he followed Rhagius to Leipzig. The &quot;1911 Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; reported that in 1508 he was a shipwrecked beggar on the Pomeranian coast, while the New International Encyclopedia described him as stricken down with the pestilence and recovering.

In 1509, he was studying theology at the University of Greifswald, where he was at first received kindly. In 1510 he spent time further studying theology at University of Wittenberg.

However his burgher patrons could not tolerate the poet&#x27;s airs and vanity and ill-timed assertions of his higher rank. Wherefore Hutten left Greifswald, and as he went was robbed of clothes and books, his only baggage, by the servants of his late friends. In the dead of winter, half starved, frozen, penniless, he reached Rostock.

In Rostock, again the humanists received him gladly, and under their protection he wrote against his Greifswald patrons, thus beginning the long list of his satires and fierce attacks on personal or public foes. Rostock could not hold him long, and he wandered on to Wittenberg, where in 1511 he published his &quot;Ars Versificatoria&quot;, a work on . 
His next stop was Leipzig, and thence to Vienna, where he hoped to win the emperor Maximilian&#x27;s favour by an elaborate national poem on the war with Venice. But neither Maximilian nor the University of Vienna would lift a hand for him.

So Hutten went on to Italy, and settled at Pavia to study law. In 1512, his studies were interrupted by war: in the siege of Pavia by papal troops and Swiss, he was plundered by both sides, and escaped, sick and penniless, to Bologna. On his recovery, he served for a short time as a private soldier in the emperor&#x27;s army, but by 1514 was back in Germany.
Thanks to his poetic gifts and the friendship of Eitelwolf von Stein (d. 1515), he won the favour of the elector of Mainz, Archbishop Albert of Brandenburg. Here high dreams of a learned career rose on him: Mainz should be made the metropolis of a grand humanist movement, the centre of good style and literary form.

===Strife with Ulrich of Württemberg===

But the murder in 1515 of his relative Hans von Hutten by Ulrich, duke of Württemberg changed the whole course of Hutten&#x27;s life; satire, chief refuge of the weak, became his weapon. With one hand he took his part in the famous &quot;Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum&quot; (The Letters of Obscure Men), and with the other launched scathing letters, eloquent Ciceronian orations, or biting satires against the duke. These works made him known throughout Germany.

&quot;Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum&quot; was written in support of Hutten&#x27;s mentor, the prominent theologian Johannes Reuchlin, who was engaged in a struggle to prevent the confiscation of Hebrew texts. &quot;Epistolæ&quot; contained a series of fictitious letters, addressed to Hardwin von Grätz, that sarcastically attacked the scholastic theologians who were acting against Reuchlin.

Hutten went again to Italy to take the degree of doctor of laws, and returned to Germany in 1517. There the emperor took him under his protection and bestowed on him the honors of a poet&#x27;s laureate crown and knighthood. However, he also spared Ulrich, duke of Württemberg. While in Italy, Hutten conceived a fierce hatred for the papacy, which he bitterly attacked in his preface to an edition of Laurentius Valla&#x27;s &quot;De Donatione Constantini&quot;, published in 1517. He thus helped prepare the way for Martin Luther.

In 1518, Hutten accompanied his patron, Archbishop Albert, on several official journeys to Paris and to the Diet of Augsburg, where Luther had his famous conference with Thomas Cajetan. Subsequently, Hutten established a small printing press, and published pamphlets written in the German language attacking the Pope and the Roman clergy.

===Participation in the Reformation===

Archbishop Albert denounced him at Rome, whereupon in 1519 Hutten became a supporter of Luther and his calls for religious reform. Unlike Luther, Hutten tried to enforce reformation by military means when he, along with Franz von Sickingen attempted to begin a popular crusade within the Holy Roman Empire against the power of the Roman Catholic Church in favour of Luther&#x27;s reformed religion.

In what is known as the Knights&#x27; Revolt, they attacked the lands of the Archbishop of Trier in 1522. The archbishop held out, however, and the knights were eventually defeated in 1523, destroying them as a significant political force within the empire.
Following his defeat, Hutten tried to convince Erasmus of Rotterdam to side with the Reformation. Erasmus refused to take sides. Their estrangement culminated in a literary quarrel between the two humanists. Hutten&#x27;s &quot;Ulrichi ab Hutten cum Erasmo Rotirodamo, Presbytero, Theologo, Expostulatio&quot; is a collection of his arguments against Erasmus; it was printed by Johannes Schott from Strasbourg in 1523. It contains a woodcut of Hutten and Erasmus; it was thought (in 1850) to be the earliest known woodcut of the latter. Erasmus refused to see Hutten when the latter came to Basel in 1523, ill and impoverished, to see him.

Hutten died in seclusion on the island of Ufenau on Lake Zurich.

==Health issues==
For the final 15 years of his life, Hutten suffered from the &quot;French disease&quot; (or syphilis), of which he died. He wrote a text in 1519, &quot;De morbo Gallico&quot; (On the French disease), about the symptoms of what is thought to be syphilis and its treatment with Guaiacum. His text is regarded as one of the first patient narratives in the history of medicine; Holbein the Younger&#x27;s portrait of him from 1523 is the first known realistic portrait of a person with the disease.

In the last hundred years, two skeletons have been dug up: a male without signs of syphilis and a female with signs of syphilis. This has led to recent speculation in the American Journal of Medicine that von Hutten may have been a cross-dressing woman.

==Works==
Hutten was more open in the expression of his opinions than any other man, probably, of his age. He did much to prepare the way for the Reformation and to promote it. He was a master of the Latin language, and excelled in satirical and passionate invective. His literary life is generally divided into three periods: (1) Period of Latin poems (1509–16); (2) period of letters and orations (1515–17); (3) period of dialogues and letters in Latin and German (1517–23). In all he published some 45 different works.

One of Hutten&#x27;s major works was his &quot;Arminius&quot; (1520), a Latin dialogue featuring the Germanic chieftain Arminius which inspired later works on the Arminius theme (such as Heinrich von Kleist&#x27;s 1808 play &quot;Die Hermannsschlacht&quot;) and encouraged German nationalists to view Arminius as a symbol of German national identity. Other chief works include: &quot;Ars versificandi&quot; (The Art of Prosody, 1511); the &quot;Nemo&quot; (1518); the cited work on the &quot;Morbus Gallicus&quot; (1519); the volume of Steckelberg complaints against Duke Ulrich (including his four &quot;Ciceronian Orations&quot;, his Letters and the &quot;Phalarismus&quot;) also in 1519; the &quot;Vadismus&quot; (1520); and the controversy with Erasmus at the end of his life. Besides these were many poems in Latin and German.

===Letters of Obscure Men===

His most noteworthy contribution to literature was his portion of the &quot;Epistolæ Obscurorum Virorum&quot; (Letters of Obscure Men). At first the cloister world, not discerning its irony, welcomed the work as a defence of their position against Johann Reuchlin; though their eyes were soon opened by the favor with which the learned world received it. The &quot;Epistolæ&quot; were eagerly bought up; the first part (41 letters) appeared at the end of 1515; early in 1516 there was a second edition; later in 1516 a third, with an appendix of seven letters; in 1517 appeared the second part (62 letters), to which a fresh appendix of eight letters was subjoined soon after.

How far Hutten was the parent of this celebrated work was long a matter of dispute. Hutten, in a letter addressed to Richard Croke, denied that he was the author of the book, but there is no doubt as to his connexion with it. Erasmus was of opinion that there were three authors, of whom Crotus Rubianus was the originator of the idea, and Hutten a chief contributor. D. F. Strauss concluded that Hutten had no share in the first part, but that his hand is clearly visible in the second part, which Strauss attributed—along with the more serious and severe tone of that bitter portion of the satire—in the main to Hutten. Holborn, however, citing the later scholarship of Bömer, regards the matter of authorship &quot;as closed in all essential points&quot;. According to them, the first part was the work of Rubianus (save for the first epistle, written by Hutten), while the appendix and the second part were mostly by Hutten, with additional contributions from Hermann von dem Busche and others.

=== Life as a vassal knight ===
Hutten writes a graphic description of the harshness of life as a vassal knight (a &quot;Lehnsmann&quot;) in medieval Europe in a letter to Willibald Pirckheimer(1470–1530) that dispels the glamour with which the life of the nobility is sometimes viewed.

==Family==
In addition to Hans von Hutten, Ulrich von Hutten was also related to the German adventurer Philipp von Hutten.

==Legacy==

* As a student at the University of Bonn, Carl Schurz began work on a tragedy based on Hutten&#x27;s life. He abandoned it, never to return to finish the work, when the 1848 revolution broke out in Germany.
* During World War II, the German Wehrmacht named some of its final infantry divisions after noteworthy individuals of German history. One such infantry division, fielded in March 1945, was the Infantry Division Ulrich von Hutten.

<doc id="858702" wikidata="Q1131393" url="?curid=858702" title="London to Brighton events">
<text>London to Brighton refers to a variety of races, tours, charity bicycle rides and rallies that take place between London and Brighton in the United Kingdom.

The route often follows the A23 (and, often, nearby minor roads). The route is full of contrasts, (depending on the starting point and exact route) passing through the London suburbs of Westminster, Brixton, Sutton, Croydon and Purley, past Gatwick Airport, Crawley and then into the countryside of The Weald, crossing the North and South Downs. Ditchling Beacon on the South Downs (near but not part of the A23) is a steep climb followed by a gentle descent for five miles into Brighton, where the route finishes on the promenade by the Kings Road arches. The current London to Brighton Veteran Car Run does not use the route past the Ditchling Beacon but follows the A273 road up Clayton Hill and rejoins the A23 at Pyecombe.

==London to Brighton Veteran Car Run==

The route was originally popularised by the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run begun in 1927 for cars built before 1904 and re-enacting the original 1896 Emancipation Run, which was held on 14 November 1896 to celebrate the passing into law of the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 which raised the speed limit to and did away with the need for a person to walk in front of a mechanised vehicle waving a red flag to warn other road users. In 2007 531 cars participated and over ninety percent of them finished the course; in 2008 there were 550, with 126 international entries from as far away as Australia, Canada, USA, Argentina and South Africa.

==London to Brighton Bike Ride==

Several fundraising bike rides take place between London and Brighton each year. The most famous is the British Heart Foundation event which has taken place each summer since 1976, and in 2014 involved an estimated 30,000 riders. The event starts on Clapham Common and the 54 mile route finishes on Madeira Drive in Brighton. Despite most roads being closed to cars, the number of bikes is such that traffic jams occur, especially at hills. The toughest part of the route is the climb over Ditchling Beacon which once featured in the Tour de France; having already cycled some , cyclists must then tackle a climb with an average grade exceeding 1 in 10. Several sections are somewhat steeper, and whilst the fittest will try to cycle up, the vast majority will walk.

To date, over 650,000 riders have taken part and have raised over £40 million for the British Heart Foundation. In recent years, the BHF have introduced a night ride and an off-road ride. These are on separate dates, and some competitors will ride all three routes in the same year.

==Running events==
An ultramarathon running race used to take this route each October, starting on Westminster Bridge in the centre of London, and finishing at The Level in Brighton. This is a distance of 54 miles, 198 yards (87.085 km). The race was organised by the Road Runners Club from 1951 to 2005. However, the course had been raced over at least since the early 19th century, and regularly since 1899. In its later years the race was low-key with just over one hundred runners taking part. The fastest would finish in well under 6 hours, whilst there was a time limit of 10 hours after which the course was not marshalled. The race was discontinued after 2005 because of increasing road traffic and difficulties in finding sufficient marshals.

In 2010 the ultra-running organisation Extreme Running staged an off-road London to Brighton Trail Race from Blackheath in London to Brighton sea front (56 miles). The winning time was 8 hours 32 minutes. The race was next planned to be held in 2011.

Since 2011, the company UltraChallenge has organised annually a mixed road/trail 100K race from Richmond in West London to Brighton&#x27;s racecourse. The course can be run or walked.

From Piccadilly to Brighton there is a marathon route.

==London to Brighton Mini Run==

The London to Brighton Mini Run takes place on the 3rd Sunday in May. It celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2010. In 2009 the event broke the world record for the longest convoy of Minis with a Guinness-verified total of 1450 cars. The London to Brighton Mini Run features a large number of Minis both classic and modern. It is organised by the London &amp; Surrey Mini Owners Club.
The event was the brainchild of Mark Steward, who took ideas from the Vintage runs (from London to Brighton). It originally started at Battersea Park but as it grew it moved to Crystal Palace until 2022 when it moved to Cheam. The Route has always followed the A23.
The 2023 run is the last one before London ULEZ comes into effect which may impact future runs (as it will cause a £12.50/day charge for those non-compliant vehicles).

==Other Motoring events==
In 2005 this tradition was copied in the United States. The SotaMINIs car club organized the New London to New Brighton Run in the state of Minnesota (Mini-sota). Minnesota is the only state in the US that has both a New London and a New Brighton. The distance between the two is exactly twice the distance from London to Brighton. The first year it was attended by 20 MINIs/Minis. It has since doubled in size. The club, SotaMINIs (new MINIs) has since merged with the Classic Mini club called MMPE&amp;PSHE (the Mini-sota Minis Pizza Eating &amp; Psychiatric Self-Help Association). The new club is called Minnesota United Minis Minnesota United Minis (M.U.M.) and the tradition of the New London to New Brighton run is still going strong in 2016.

The London to Brighton Land Rover Run is an annual gathering of Land Rover enthusiasts organised by the South London and Surrey Land Rover Club. The event started at Crystal Palace Park until an extension of the London Emissions Zone forced it to move. Since 2012 it has been held at Hook Road Arena in Epsom and the Land Rovers drive down to Madeira Drive in Brighton. The event takes place on or around the first Sunday in October.

==Other events==

Other London to Brighton events include those for MGs, air-cooled Volkswagens, 2CVs, vintage motorcycles, Smart Cars, vintage commercial vehicles, and electric vehicles. Most events, especially motoring events, finish at Madeira Drive on the seafront.

<text>Alan Rawsthorne (2 May 1905 – 24 July 1971) was a British composer. He was born in Haslingden, Lancashire, and is buried in Thaxted churchyard in Essex.

==Early years==
Alan Rawsthorne was born in Deardengate House, Haslingden, Lancashire, to Hubert Rawsthorne (1868–1943), a well-off medical doctor, and his wife, Janet Bridge (1877/8–1927). Despite what appears to have been a happy and affectionate family life with his parents and elder sister, Barbara (the only sibling), in beautiful Lancashire countryside, as a boy Rawsthorne suffered from fragile health. Although he did at various times attend schools in Southport, much of Rawsthorne&#x27;s early education came through private tutoring at home. Despite his childhood aptitude for music and literature, Rawsthorne&#x27;s parents tried to steer him away from his dreams of becoming a professional musician. As a result, he unsuccessfully tried to take on degree courses at Liverpool University, first in dentistry and then architecture. Concerning dentistry, Rawsthorne is on record as having said &quot;I gave that up, thank God, before getting near anyone&#x27;s mouth&quot;, while his friend Constant Lambert quipped &quot;Mr Rawsthorne assures me that he has given up the practice of dentistry, even as a hobby.&quot;

==Career==
In 1925, Rawsthorne was finally able to enrol at the Royal Manchester College of Music, where his teachers included Frank Merrick for the piano and Carl Fuchs for the cello. In 1927, Rawsthorne&#x27;s mother died aged just forty-nine. After graduating from the Royal Manchester College of Music around 1930, Rawsthorne spent the next couple of years pursuing his piano training with Egon Petri at Zakopane in Poland, and then briefly also in Berlin.

On his return to England in 1932, Rawsthorne took up a post as pianist and teacher at Dartington Hall in Devon, where he became composer-in-residence for the School of Dance and Mime. In 1934, Rawsthorne left for London to try his fortune as a freelance composer. His first real public success arrived four years later with a performance of his &quot;Theme and Variations for Two Violins&quot; at the 1938 International Society for Contemporary Music (ISCM) Festival in London. The next year, his large-scale &quot;Symphonic Studies&quot; for orchestra was performed in Warsaw, again at the ISCM Festival. The first in a line of completely assured orchestral scores, the &quot;Symphonic Studies&quot;, which can be heard as a concerto for orchestra in all but name, rapidly helped Rawsthorne establish himself as a composer possessing a highly distinctive musical voice.()

Other acclaimed works by Rawsthorne include a viola sonata (1937), two piano concertos (1939, 1951), an oboe concerto (1947), two violin concertos (1948, 1956), a concerto for string orchestra (1949), and the &quot;Elegy&quot; for guitar (1971), a piece written for and completed by Julian Bream after the composer&#x27;s death. Other works include a cello concerto, three acknowledged string quartets among other chamber works, and three symphonies.

Rawsthorne wrote a number of film scores. His best–known work in this field was the music for the 1953 British war film &quot;The Cruel Sea&quot;, and his other scores included many popular British films, such as &quot;The Captive Heart&quot; (1946), &quot;School for Secrets&quot; (1946), &quot;Uncle Silas&quot; (1947), &quot;Saraband for Dead Lovers&quot; (1948), &quot;Pandora and the Flying Dutchman&quot; (1951), &quot;Where No Vultures Fly&quot; (1951), &quot;West of Zanzibar&quot; (1954), &quot;The Man Who Never Was&quot; (1956) and &quot;Floods of Fear&quot; (1958).

Rawsthorne died from pneumonia at Addenbrooke&#x27;s Hospital in Cambridge on 24 July 1971.

==Family==
In 1934, Rawsthorne married his first wife Jessie Hinchcliffe, a violinist in the Philharmonia Orchestra. They separated in 1947 and divorced in 1954. Hinchcliffe went on to marry René Leibowitz in Paris. In 1955, he married Isabel Rawsthorne (née Isabel Nicholas), an artist and model well known in the Paris and Soho art scenes. Her contemporaries included André Derain, Alberto Giacometti, Pablo Picasso and Francis Bacon. Isabel Rawsthorne was the widow of composer Constant Lambert and stepmother to Kit Lambert, manager of the rock group the Who, who died in 1981. Alan Rawsthorne was her third husband; Sefton Delmer (the journalist and member of the Special Operations Executive during the Second World War) was her first husband. Isabel died in 1992.

<doc id="858707" wikidata="Q2923233" url="?curid=858707" title="Brachioteuthidae">
<text>Brachioteuthidae is a family of squid containing two genera and around seven species. They are muscular, but rather thin squids with a ML up to ~20 cm. The tentacle club is unique in this family in that the dactylus is normal (usually 3-4 sucker series), while the manus is greatly expanded with numerous small suckers on stalks. Many species show very little differentiation between the carpus, manus, and the dactylus.

==Taxonomy==
The family Brachioteuthidae was fully described by Pfeffer in 1908, with its first species, &quot;Brachioteuthis&quot; &quot;beanii&quot;, originally identified by A.E. Verrill in 1881 from two specimens collected off the coast of Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. However, the species was described based on a heavily damaged individual, which made its classification more challenging. Initially, B. beanii was considered a potential member of the family Chiroteuthidae due to the neck-like feature observed in its paralarvae, but further examination revealed several key differences that warranted its placement in Brachioteuthidae instead.

In 1882, Steenstrup described a new genus, &quot;Tracheloteuthis&quot; (later synonymized with &quot;Brachioteuthis&quot;), along with two new species: &quot;T&quot;. &quot;riisei&quot; (=&quot;B&quot;. &quot;riisei&quot;) and &quot;T&quot;. &quot;behnii&quot; (=&quot;B&quot;. &quot;behnii&quot;). These species were primarily based on paralarval forms, with very little morphological detail provided, and additional research was needed, particularly to confirm the validity of &quot;B&quot;. &quot;behnii&quot;.

In 1908, another species, &quot;B&quot;. &quot;bowmani&quot;, was discovered by E.S. Russel. This species, known only from a single female specimen measuring about 61 mm in mantle length from the northeast Atlantic, remains poorly understood due to the loss of the type specimen, limiting further study of its validity.

In 1910, Carl Chun described &quot;B&quot;. &quot;picta&quot;, based on a nearly perfect mature specimen collected in the Benguela Current off the coast of Africa. Chun&#x27;s description highlighted several distinguishing features, including a long, bluntly pointed mantle, fins about half the length of the mantle, a head slightly larger than the mantle, and a wide club with a curved apex, which set &quot;B&quot;. &quot;picta&quot; apart from other species in the genus.

The 21st century saw further advancements in &quot;Brachioteuthis&quot; taxonomy, with Marek Lipinski&#x27;s 2001 description of &quot;B&quot;. &quot;linkovskyi&quot; and the new genus &quot;Slosarczykovia&quot; with the species (&quot;S&quot;. &quot;circumantarctica&quot;). &quot;B&quot;. &quot;linkovskyi&quot; was described from a single male specimen, notable for its reticulate, wart-covered mantle (with no warts on the head, fins, or arms), fins extending into the tail, and relatively short arms. The species also featured suckers with 9-12 teeth on each arm, and a lack of sexual `modification in arms IV, including no hectocotylus. The largest suckers on the manus had up to 14 long, sharp teeth, and those on the proximal dactylus were 2.5–4 times larger than those on the manus.

&quot;Slosarczykovia&quot;, a new genus described in the same work, was distinguished by the presence of a fibrous net in both males and females, a weakly differentiated suckered club, and the absence of a carpal fixing apparatus. The largest suckers on the proximal manus were about 33% larger than those on the proximal dactylus.

Despite a lack of significant morphological similarities, Discoteuthidae is considered the sister group to Brachioteuthidae, a relationship that remains somewhat enigmatic, given the few shared traits between the two families.

==Species==
*Genus &quot;Brachioteuthis&quot;
**&quot;Brachioteuthis beanii&quot;
**&quot;Brachioteuthis behnii&quot; *
**&quot;Brachioteuthis bowmani&quot; *
**&quot;Brachioteuthis picta&quot;, *
**&quot;Brachioteuthis riisei&quot;, *
**&quot;Brachioteuthis linkovskyi&quot;, *
*Genus &quot;Slosarczykovia&quot;
**&quot;Slosarczykovia circumantarctica&quot;

The species listed above with an asterisk (*) is questionable and needs further study to determine if it is a valid species or a synonym.

==Trophic ecology==
Little is known about the exact diets of many brachioteuthid species due to the unstable taxonomy of the family. Many species are often misidentified, and published in scientific literature as the wrong species. Brachioteuthids in general are primarily predated on by large sea mammals, sea birds, large fish, and other invertebrates (including shrimp and other squid). Less knowledge is available regarding individual species diets. Slosarczykovia is known to eat krill, copepods, and amphipods; while B. beanii was found to eat sternoptychid and myctophid fishes)

==Reproduction==
Similar to other information, reproduction in individual species is not well understood. However, in 1996, Clyde Roper and Mike Vecchione discussed paired behaviour in B. beanii detected in the north Atlantic through live sightings. The videos showed one squid grasping the other by the posterior mantle with its arm crown. There were brief periods where the grasped squid would bend its head, and vigorously moved its arms and body around the head and mantle of the grasping squid.

<text>LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE (), commonly known as LVMH, is a French multinational holding company and conglomerate that specializes in luxury goods and has its headquarters in Paris, France. The company was formed in 1987 through the merger of fashion house Louis Vuitton (founded in 1854) with Moët Hennessy, which had been established by the 1971 merger between the champagne producer Moët &amp; Chandon (founded in 1743) and the cognac producer Hennessy (founded in 1765). In April 2023, LVMH became the first European company to surpass a valuation of $500 billion. In 2023, the company was ranked 47th in the Forbes Global 2000.

LVMH controls around 60 subsidiaries that manage 75 luxury brands. In addition to Louis Vuitton and Moët Hennessy, LVMH&#x27;s portfolio includes Christian Dior Couture, Givenchy, Fendi, Celine, Kenzo, Tiffany, Bulgari, Loewe, TAG Heuer, Marc Jacobs, Stella McCartney, Sephora and Loro Piana. The subsidiaries are often managed independently, under the umbrellas of six branches: Fashion Group, Wines and Spirits, Perfumes and Cosmetics, Watches and Jewelry, Selective Distribution, and Other Activities. LVMH owns Les Echos-Le Parisien Group, its media subsidiary. The wine estate of Château d&#x27;Yquem, whose origins date back to 1593, is under LVMH ownership. Bernard Arnault is the chairman, CEO and largest shareholder of LVMH, making him one of the richest people in the world as of 2024.

==History==
In 1987, Moët Hennessy and Louis Vuitton merged to create LVMH. As a result of different visions for the future of the merged entity, Alain Chevalier and Henry Racamier, the respective leaders of the predecessor firms, started to fight. Racamier invited Bernard Arnault to invest in LVMH. Rapidly, Arnault succeeded in taking control of LVMH at the expense of the initial family owners. Contrary to what is often indicated, Arnault did not establish LVMH.

The successful integration of various famous aspirational brands into a single group inspired other luxury companies to do the same. Thus, the French conglomerate Kering and the Swiss-based Richemont have also created extended portfolios of luxury brands. LVMH is a component of the Euro Stoxx 50 stock market index.

Make Up For Ever was established in 1984, and it was acquired by LVMH in 1999.

On 7 March 2011, LVMH announced the acquisition of the 50.4% family-owned shares of the Italian jeweller Bulgari and the intention to make a tender offer for the rest, which was publicly owned. The transaction was about $5.2 billion.

By 2012, LVMH established LCapitalAsia, a continuation of its private-equity arm, focused on Asia. In early 2013, LVMH announced its co-investment of its private equity arm LCapitalAsia and the Chinese apparel company Xin Hee Co., Ltd. 

In February 2014, LVMH entered into a joint venture with the Italian fashion brand Marco De Vincenzo, taking a minority 45% stake in the firm.

In 2016, L Catterton Asia and Crescent Point, two private equity firms backed by LVMH, bought a majority stake in GXG.

In April 2017, LVMH announced it would gain ownership of Christian Dior haute couture, leather, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s ready-to-wear, and footwear lines to integrate the entire Dior brand within its luxury group.

In January 2018, LVMH announced record sales of 42.6 billion euros in 2017, up 13% over the previous year, as all divisions turned in strong performances. In the same year, the net profit increased by 29%. On 1 November 2018, co-founder Alain Chevalier died at age 87.
On 12 May 2019, the fashion house Fenty, styled as FEИTY, created by singer Rihanna, was launched by LVMH in Paris. It is the first new fashion house by LVMH in 32 years, and she is the first woman of colour to head a brand under LVMH. On 15 July 2019, LVMH announced a new partnership to further develop the Stella McCartney House. On 29 November 2019, LVMH announced its 55% stake in Château d&#x27;Esclans, the producer best known for the brand Whispering Angel. The acquisition was part of LVMH&#x27;s move to offer a beloved high-end rosé portfolio, in addition to reaching customers worldwide. In November 2019, LVMH expressed plans to acquire Tiffany &amp; Co. for approximately US $16.2 billion. The deal was expected to close by June 2020. LVMH issued a statement in September 2020 indicating that the takeover would not proceed and that the deal was &quot;invalid,&quot; citing Tiffany&#x27;s mismanagement during the COVID-19 pandemic. Subsequently, Tiffany filed suit against LVMH, asking the court to compel the purchase or to assess damages against the defendant; LVMH planned to countersuit, alleging that mismanagement had invalidated the purchase agreement.

In mid-September 2020, a reliable source told &quot;Forbes&quot; that the reason for Arnault&#x27;s decision to cancel the Tiffany purchase was purely financial: because Tiffany was paying millions in dividends to shareholders despite a financial loss of US$32 million during the pandemic. Some US$70 million had already been paid out by Tiffany, with an additional US$70 million scheduled to be paid in November 2020. LVMH filed a counterclaim against the court action commenced by Tiffany; a statement issued by LVMH blamed Tiffany&#x27;s mismanagement during the pandemic and claimed that it was &#x27;burning cash and reporting losses&#x27;&quot;. In late October 2020, Tiffany and LVMH agreed to go back to the original takeover plan, though at a slightly reduced price of nearly $16 billion, a minor reduction of 2.6% from the aforementioned deal. The new deal reduced the amount paid per share by LVMH from the original price of $135 to $131.50. As of late 2020, LVMH has the largest market capitalization of any company in France, and also in the Eurozone with a record of 261 billion euros ($317.6 billion). As of December 2020, Arnault&#x27;s own fortune was nearly half that, with a personal net worth of $151.7 billion.

LVMH completed the purchase of Tiffany in January 2021. In 2021, with a valuation of $329 billion, LVMH became the most valuable company in Europe.

In January 2022, LVMH acquired a minority stake in the New York-based label Aimé Leon Dore for an undisclosed sum. The investment was made through the conglomerate&#x27;s LVMH Luxury Ventures arm. In March 2022, LVMH announced the closure of its 120+ stores in Russia, pointing to &quot;the current circumstances in the region&quot;, subsequent to the Russian invasion of Ukraine. An LVMH spokesperson stated the company would continue to pay salary and benefits to its 3,500 employees in Russia. In November 2022, it was announced LVMH had acquired the Piedmont-based jewelry maker Pedemonte Group.

On 24 April 2023, LVMH became the first European company to reach a $500 billion valuation.

In November 2023, LVMH agreed to acquire the Los Angeles-based eyewear brand Barton Perreira for $80 million.

In June 2024, LVMH acquired Swiza, the owner of L’Epée 1839, a Swiss manufacturer known for high-end clocks and horological creations. L’Epée 1839, based in Delémont, Switzerland, has been recognized for its watchmaking expertise since 1839. This acquisition highlights LVMH&#x27;s focus on integrating unique craftsmanship and design within its luxury portfolio. L’Epée 1839 produces intricate clocks, including those with perpetual calendars and tourbillons, favored by various dignitaries and royal families.

==Corporate structure==

The group&#x27;s control amounted to 46.84% of LVMH&#x27;s stock and 63.13% of its voting rights. This significant share held by the Arnault Family Group not only underscores their influential role in the strategic direction of LVMH but also highlights the consolidation of control within family-held enterprises in the luxury sector.

In 2015, LVMH bought the newspapers &quot;Le Parisien&quot; and &quot;Aujourd’hui en France&quot; from the Amaury Group. Marie-Odile Amaury, the group&#x27;s owner, initially hoped for 200 million euros ($218 million) which were later revised to 150 million ($163 million) during a previous sale attempt, but a bid of 50 million euros ($54.5 million) was made. The financial transaction was completed at the end of October 2015.

In 2018, the Lagardère Group sold the stock market information website Boursier.com to Les Echos-Le Parisien Group. In March 2018, Pierre Louette, former CEO of Agence France-Presse from 2005 to 2010, was named CEO of Les Echos-Le Parisien Group, succeeding Francis Morel, who had held this position for seven years.

== Philanthropy, sponsorships and events ==
===Visual arts===
LVMH is a major patron of art in France. The group supported about ten exhibitions as &quot;&quot;Le grand monde d’Andy Warhol&quot; and &quot;Picasso et les maîtres&quot; at le Grand Palais in Paris. LVMH also endorsed the patronage of &quot;l&#x27;atelier d&#x27;Alberto Giacometti&quot;&quot; and &quot;Yves Klein&quot; at Centre Georges Pompidou.

Since 2005, when the LVMH flagship store opened in Paris at 3, avenue George V, 75008, the company presented close collaborations with contemporary artists. Features included a light sculpture by American James Turrell, a 20-metre (65 feet) long &quot;travelling staircase&quot; showcasing the work of American video artist Tim White-Sobieski and an elevator linking the store to the top floor by Iceland&#x27;s Olafur Eliasson.

In 2006, a gallery space was inaugurated on the second floor of the same building and named &quot;Espace Culturel&quot;. &quot;Icônes&quot; was one of the first exhibitions. Shigeru Ban, Sylvie Fleury, Zaha Hadid, Bruno Peinado, Andrée Putman, Ugo Rondinone, James Turrell, Tim White-Sobieski and Robert Wilson were the nine artists invited by Louis Vuitton to participate in it.

In addition, LVMH foundation created the &quot;young creators LVMH award&quot;, an international competition opened to French and international beaux-arts students. Each year, six grants are allocated to the winners.

In 2014, LVMH opened the Fondation Louis Vuitton pour la Creation in a new building designed by Frank Gehry in the Bois de Boulogne in Paris. The Fondation is designed as the Group&#x27;s own museum to present its collections and organize major world-class art exhibitions.

===Fashion===
In November 2013, LVMH created the &quot;LVMH Young Fashion Designer Prize&quot;, which comes with a €300,000 grant with a year of mentoring; it was the brainchild of Delphine Arnault. In February 2014 20 finalists for the inaugural prize were shown in London, including Simone Rocha, Thomas Tait, Meadham Kirchhoff, Marques&#x27;Almeida, J JS Lee, and others, and Thomas Tait was the winner. Marques&#x27;Almeida won the 2015 prize. In 2019, South African designer Thebe Magugu became the first African to win the prize, and was commended by the President of South Africa, Cyril Ramaphosa.

LVMH underwrites other fashion competitions, including the Andam prize in France, the International Festival of Fashion and Photography in Hyères, France, an investment fund for young designers created by the French Ministry of Culture and Communication, and a scholarship program and sponsored lecture theater at Central Saint Martins in London.

===Music===
The group also lends Stradivarius violins to young talented musicians. Maxim Vengerov and Laurent Korcia have used the instruments.

===Humanitarian aid===
On 26 August 2019, Bernard Arnault declared that LVMH would donate $11 million to help fight the 2019 Brazil wildfires.

During the COVID-19 crisis, the group shifted its production of perfume and spirits towards hand sanitizer. This production of 12 tons has been offered to hospitals in Paris, France.

In 2022, Louis Vuitton announced a €1 million donation to UNICEF to help the Ukrainian victims of the Russian invasion. On 2 March 2022, LVMH Group pledged €5 million to the Red Cross to those affected by the war. In addition, the company closed 124 of its stores in Russia.

=== Sports ===

LVMH sponsored the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games as a premium partner. The company spent €150 million to seal the partnership. Chaumet jewelry company was responsible for the design of the medals; one of LVMH&#x27;s fashion houses, Berluti, dressed the French delegation; and Moët Hennessy provided its products for the events. Also as part of the partnership, LVMH participated in the activities of French Popular Relief, a charity organization that facilitates access to sport for 1,000 children and young people aged 4 to 25 living in vulnerable situations. The group sponsored athletes, which includes French swimmer Leon Marchand, and its beauty retailer Sephora sponsored the Olympic torch relay.

After Formula One&#x27;s existing deal with Rolex expired in 2024, LVMH is set to re-enter the sport in 2025, investing $150 million annually in a multi-year deal. Through this partnership, TAG Heuer, having already sponsored the Monaco Grand Prix and Red Bull Racing Formula One teams, is set to return as Formula One timekeeper, with Louis Vuitton set to sponsor the Australian Grand Prix from 2025 onward.

=== &quot;Journées Particulières&quot; ===
Launched in 2011, &quot;Journées Particulières&quot; (Particular Days) is a biennial event which allows visitors to enter the various ateliers, studios, caves, and mansions owned by LVMH, for free.

It is staged every two years and has opened doors in France, Italy, Switzerland, the UK, the Netherlands, Spain and Germany, with 56 brands welcoming guests into over 70 sites on four continents. The 2017 issue attracted 145,000 visitors.

== Controversies ==
=== John Galliano&#x27;s anti-semitism ===
On 25 February 2011, Christian Dior announced they had suspended designer John Galliano following his arrest over an alleged anti-semitic tirade in a Paris bar. In France, it is against the law to make anti-semitic remarks of this nature, and it can be punished by up to six months in prison. On 1 March 2011, Christian Dior officially announced that it had fired Galliano amidst the controversy.

=== Sebastian Suhl ===
In 2012 former Prada COO Sebastian Suhl was hired by Givenchy as the company&#x27;s new CEO. The Asian Transnational Corporation Monitoring Network (ATNC), a network made of 15 organizations from 12 Asian countries wrote a letter of concern to LVMH Group&#x27;s Bernard Arnault as Suhl was at the same time a key person in the Prada Female Discrimination Case where he was described as complicit in sexual harassment and discrimination practices.

===Corruption===
During December 2021, LVMH paid €10 million to settle claims in Paris to end several criminal investigations that a former French intelligence chief, Bernard Squarcini, spied for the company, on competitors and others, including on journalist François Ruffin making a film about its billionaire owner, Bernard Arnault. Prosecutors allege that the intelligence chief used tactics like influence peddling, invasion of privacy, and leveraging his network in intelligence and police on behalf of the company.

===Fendi store openings 2023===
Fendi has been very active in building new flagship stores in several places like Doha and Amsterdam. It has been claimed that in 2023 Fendi had not paid, or had only partially paid, invoices from their suppliers, with some amounts remaining outstanding for over a year.

===2024 Olympic medals===
LVMH faced controversy in 2025 when it was revealed that the Olympic medals created by subsidiary Chaumet for the 2024 Summer Olympics had begun to deteriorate and fall apart. By January 2025 over 100 Olympic medalists had requested replacement medals.

<text>Masterplan is a German power metal band founded by guitarist Roland Grapow and drummer Uli Kusch upon leaving Helloween in 2001.

== History ==
During Helloween&#x27;s tour of their album &quot;The Dark Ride&quot; in 2001, members Roland Grapow and Uli Kusch (who had been in the band since 1989 and 1994, respectively) decided to form a side project. As the other Helloween members felt the two were more focused on their side project than Helloween at the time, both were later fired from the band. The name &quot;Masterplan&quot; was born out of the idea that they would be master musicians with the future in their hands, starting the newest power metal band of the new millennium. To fill out their line-up, Roland subsequently invited Children of Bodom keyboardist Janne Wirman. For vocals, Russell Allen was invited but he had to decline, being busy with his main band Symphony X. A second invitation was made for former Helloween singer Michael Kiske, who also rejected the proposal, claiming that he wanted to keep away from the metal scene. After being impressed with the vocals on the Norwegian band Ark&#x27;s album &quot;Burn The Sun&quot; and a solo album titled &quot;Worldchanger&quot;, singer Jørn Lande was invited. Jørn accepted the invitation, completing the band roughly six months after the beginning of the project.

Their first full-length self-titled album &quot;Masterplan&quot; was released in 2003, produced by Andy Sneap. The band then consisted of Grapow and Kusch with Jørn Lande. The main part of the keyboard lines on the album were arranged and programmed by Roland and Uli. Keyboardist Janne &quot;Warman&quot; Wirman recorded some sessions for the album, but could not stay on as a full-time member due to his commitments to Children of Bodom. Axel Mackenrott replaced him on tour and soon after as a permanent member. Studio bassist Jürgen Attig (Casanova) helped with some bass lines on the recordings, but Grapow was the main bassist for the album. For tour and subsequent recordings, Jan-Sören Eckert was hired as a permanent member.

The band received the &quot;European Border Breakers Award&quot; from the European Commission in 2004, for the debut album success around Europe.

In January 2005, Masterplan released their second album, &quot;Aeronautics&quot; once again produced by Andy Sneap and the band. After two successful albums and their respective tours, during the writing of the third album the band parted ways with vocalist Jørn Lande, citing &quot;musical differences&quot; as the reason for the split. The split was amicable enough that Jørn agreed to perform four previously arranged live appearances before departing although two of these were eventually cancelled by the promoters.

On 4 October 2006, Uli Kusch announced his departure from the band in an interview with Darkside.ru. Although not discussing the details of what had happened, he mentioned the democratic principles of making decisions in the band as one of the reasons of his leaving – according to him, it often made getting a consensus nearly impossible.
Three days later, Masterplan announced their new line-up through their official web site: Grapow, Mackenrott, Eckert, with new members Mike DiMeo (Riot, The Lizards) and Mike Terrana (ex-Artension, ex-Rage, Metalium, ex-Axel Rudi Pell). The band toured with Saxon as an opening act for Saxon&#x27;s Inner Sanctum tour.

The band&#x27;s third album, suitably titled &quot;MK II&quot;, was released on 26 February 2007. It was produced this time by the band&#x27;s actual leader, Roland Grapow himself, at his own studio in Slovakia. It was recorded in September and October 2006.

On 11 January 2009, Mike DiMeo confirmed on his MySpace page that he had parted ways with Masterplan. On 25 July 2009, the band finally revealed that Jørn Lande has made his return to Masterplan.

On 16 April 2010, a single titled &quot;Far From the End of the World&quot; was released to precede the band&#x27;s new fourth album, &quot;Time To Be King&quot;, once again produced by Roland Grapow.

On 13 July 2011, the band announced on their official website that they were writing songs for a new album. The album was set to be released in March 2013.

In July 2012, it was announced that Martin Marthus Skaroupka (Cradle of Filth drummer) will play on the new Masterplan album. In early November, it was announced that Rick Altzi and Jari Kainulainen would replace Jorn Lande and Jan Eckert on the upcoming album. In November 2012, during an interview with Metal Shock Finland&#x27;s Chief Editor, Mohsen Fayyazi, when talking about Jorn&#x27;s departure from the band, Roland stated the following:
&quot;Everybody always expects something special from Jorn, but it&#x27;s a very unstable situation. To keep happy it&#x27;s not easy and to be honest I&#x27;ve not heard from him for 2 years. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, we&#x27;re still friends but we just don&#x27;t have much contact.&quot;

On 21 February 2013, the new album was announced. The title of the album is &quot;Novum Initium&quot; and it was released on 14 June 2013 through German record label AFM Records.

In an interview made in Italy, on 16 September 2016, Roland Grapow confirmed the addition of At Vance member Kevin Kott as the drummer of the band replacing Martin Marthus Škaroupka whose commitments with his other band Cradle of Filth prevented him for playing shows with Masterplan.

They also announced the release of a new album consisting of re-recordings of Helloween songs written by Roland Grapow from the time he was in the band. The album, &quot;PumpKings&quot;, was released on 28 July 2017. Grapow stated that the album was not any kind of revenge for being fired from Helloween, or not being invited to their Pumpkins United World Tour in 2017: &quot;[fans] all thought it was kind of a revenge or something... now I remember. To me, it&#x27;s just a relaxing situation [...] I never had this in my mind. It&#x27;s just a bit coincidental because I delayed this album for two years and it came out at the same time when the reunion tour came.&quot; The band was on hiatus for the following years. The band announced a new song and a tour to follow to start 2024. The band hinted at a new album.

<text>Histioteuthidae is a family of Oegopsid squid. The family was previously considered to be monotypic but the World Register of Marine Species assigns two genera to this family.

The species classified under Histioteuthidae are mostly weakly muscled, moderately sized squid with a maximum mantle length of . They generally have very long, robust arms and a short mantle with small, rounded fins. Their main distinguishing feature is that the eyes are different sizes and orient in different vertical directions. The larger left eye is semitubular, mobile, generally is directed back and up as indicated by the pattern of iridophores on the eye&#x27;s outer surface. This means that when the squid is positioned obliquely the eye is pointed upwards towards the surface. It is thought that this is used to detect animals above the squid silhouetted against the sun during the day. The right eye has a normal shape and is oriented laterally and slightly downward. This arrangement gives the family the common name of [[Histioteuthis|cock-eyed squid]].

==Genera and species==
There are two genera which are included in the Histioteuthidae and a total of circa 19 species:

*&quot;Histioteuthis&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis atlantica&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis berryi&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis bonnellii&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis celetaria&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis cerasina&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis corona&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis eltaninae&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis heteropsis&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis inermis&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis macrohista&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis meleagroteuthis&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis miranda&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis oceani&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis pacifica&quot; 
**&quot;Histioteuthis reversa&quot;

<doc id="858728" wikidata="Q7415223" url="?curid=858728" title="San Rafael Swell">
<text>The San Rafael Swell is a large geologic feature located in south-central Utah, United States about west of Green River. The San Rafael Swell, measuring approximately , consists of a giant dome-shaped anticline of sandstone, shale, and limestone that was pushed up during the Paleocene Laramide Orogeny 40–60 million years ago. Since that time, infrequent but powerful flash floods have eroded the sedimentary rocks into numerous valleys, canyons, gorges, mesas, buttes, and badlands.

The swell is part of the Colorado Plateau physiographic region.

==Geography==
Interstate 70 divides the Swell into northern and southern sections, and provides the only interstate access to the region. The swell lies entirely within Emery County. The northern Swell is drained mainly by the San Rafael River, while the southern Swell is drained mainly by Muddy Creek, which eventually joins the Fremont River to become Dirty Devil River northeast of Hanksville, Utah. The Dirty Devil River flows southward into the Colorado River, while the San Rafael River joins the Green River before it also flows into the Colorado. Muddy Creek cuts into the western edge of the Swell, exits at Muddy Creek Gorge, and then flows across the Blue Hills Badlands near Caineville to its confluence with the Fremont River.

==Geology==

The San Rafael Swell was formed when deeply buried Precambrian rocks faulted, or broke, during the Laramide orogeny, about 60 million years ago. These &quot;basement&quot; rocks below the present-day Swell moved upwards relative to the surrounding areas and caused the overlying sedimentary rocks to fold into a dome-like shape called an anticline. The resulting structure is analogous to a series of blankets draped over a box.

Since that time, the relentless force of running water has eroded the geologic layers, resulting in older rocks becoming exposed in the middle of the Swell, and younger rocks exposed around the edges. Many of the most impressive landforms are composed of more resistant rocks, including the Jurassic Navajo Sandstone, Jurassic Wingate Sandstone, and Permian Coconino Sandstone. The folding is much steeper on the eastern edge of the Swell than in the west, and this eastern edge is referred to as the San Rafael Reef.

Both the San Rafael River and Muddy Creek drain out of the high Wasatch Plateau and the cut directly across the uplift of the Reef, which marks them as superimposed streams, pre-dating the time of the uplift. Part of the Swell has geographic features that resemble Mars. The Mars Society decided to set up the Mars Desert Research Station in the area as a Mars analog for such reasons.

==Ecology==
The San Rafael Swell is an area of high plant endemism, with many native plants occurring nowhere else in the world. An example is the endangered San Rafael cactus (&quot;Pediocactus despainii&quot;).

==History==
Evidence of Native American cultures, including the Fremont, Paiute, and Ute, is common throughout the San Rafael Swell in the form of pictograph and petroglyph panels. Examples are the Millsite Rock Art and the Buckhorn Draw Pictograph Panel, with rock art left by the Barrier Canyon Culture and the Fremont Culture. From about 1776 to the mid-1850s the Old Spanish Trail trade route passed through (or just north of) the Swell. In the past 150 years, areas of the Swell have been used for the grazing of sheep and cattle, as well as for uranium mining. Many of the gravel roads in the interior of the swell were originally used to service the uranium mining activities. Although surrounded by the communities of Price, Green River, Hanksville, Ferron, Castle Dale, and Huntington, the Swell itself does not support permanent residents.

The Swell has been used by Hollywood filmmakers as a location setting for alien planets, including the Vulcan in the 2009 film &quot;Star Trek&quot; and the alien world in &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot;.

In 2002, Governor Mike Leavitt of Utah proposed the creation of a San Rafael Swell National Monument. President George W. Bush, who had authority to create such a monument under the Antiquities Act, never acted on Leavitt&#x27;s proposal.

The idea of federal designation of the San Rafael Swell as a national monument resurfaced in 2010 in a US Department of the Interior document.

In May 2018, US Representative John Curtis put forward a bill to make the area a national monument, to be called &quot;Jurassic National Monument.&quot;

==San Rafael Recreation Area==
The area is managed by the US Bureau of Land Management. On March 12, 2019, the Emery County Public Land Management Act was signed into law as the Dingell Natural Resources Act. As part of this designation, approximately 217,000 acres were protected as the San Rafael Swell Recreation Area.
The following wilderness areas were congressionally designated around the San Rafael Swell Recreation Area as part of the John D. Dingell. Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act: Big Wild Horse Mesa (18,192 acres), Cold Wash (11,001 acres), Devil&#x27;s Canyon (8,675 acres), Eagle Canyon (13,832 acres), Horse Valley (12,201 acres), Little Ocean Draw (20,660 acres), Little Wild Horse Canyon (5,479 acres), Lower Last Chance (19,339 acres), Mexican Mountain (76,413 acres), Middle Wild Horse Mesa (16,343 acres), Muddy Creek (98,023 acres), Red&#x27;s Canyon (17,325 acres), San Rafael Reef (60,442 acres), and Sid&#x27;s Mountain (49,130 acres).

Cattle grazing is only allowed in parts of the Swell that are not designated as such. The San Rafael Swell is also dotted with sections of land managed by the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, as is much of the state of Utah. Goblin Valley State Park is on the southeastern edge of the San Rafael Swell.

==Recreation==

The San Rafael Swell attracts hikers, backpackers, horseback riders, trail runners and all-terrain vehicle (ATV) enthusiasts. Many steep, narrow slot canyons popular with technical canyoneers are found in the San Rafael Reef.

The Eastern Reef is a possible destination for rock climbers. It is home to some of the longest and sandiest climbing routes in Southeastern Utah, and was, at least by one person, nicknamed the Sandstone Alps.

<text>Bang Bo (, ) is a district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) of Samut Prakan province in Thailand.

==Geography==
Neighbouring districts are Mueang Samut Prakan, Bang Phli, and Bang Sao Thong to the west, Lat Krabang (Bangkok and Mueang Chachoengsao to the north, and Ban Pho and Bang Pakong (both in Chachoengsao province) to the east. To the south is the Bay of Bangkok.

==History==
The district was renamed from Bang Hia (บางเหี้ย, &#x27;hamlet of water monitors&#x27;), to Bang Bo (&#x27;hamlet of ponds&#x27;) in 1930.

==Economy==
Hino Motors Manufacturing (Thailand) Ltd (HMMT) is constructing a manufacturing and development centre at the Asia Industrial Estate Suvarnabhumi in the district. To be operational in 2021, the 400,000-square metre centre will supply trucks and buses to the ASEAN region. Hino is investing 3.65 billion baht in the facility which will employ 1,300 workers in its initial stages of operation.

Bang Bo is known as a snakeskin gourami (&quot;Trichopodus pectoralis&quot;) aquacultural area. The freshwater fish is processed into salted fish.

==Administration==
The district is divided into eight sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 74 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;). There are three townships (&quot;thesaban tambons&quot;). Bang Bo and Khlong Dan each cover parts of the same-named &quot;tambon&quot;, and Khlong Suan covers &quot;tambon&quot; Khlong Suan. There are a further seven tambon administrative organizations (TAO), for each &quot;tambon&quot; except Khlong Suan.
==Khlong Prawet Buri Rom==
Khlong Suan 100-year-old market (ตลาดคลองสวน 100 ปี) is on Khlong Prawet Buri Rom, a canal bordering two provinces: Khlong Suan in Bang Bo, Samut Prakan and Theppharat with Ko Rai of Ban Pho, Chachoengsao. The market dates back to the King Chulalongkorn (Rama V)&#x27;s reign. It retains some of the charm of Thailand&#x27;s old days, similar to SamChuk&#x27;s 100-year-old market of Sam Chuk district, Suphan Buri province.

==Samut Prakan (Klong Dan) Wastewater Management Project==
Tambon Klong Dan is the site of a never-completed wastewater treatment plant, approved in 1995, financed in part by the Asian Development Bank (ADB). The 24 billion baht project was not completed due to opposition from local residents and charges of malfeasance levelled against those responsible for the project. In 2014, the Pollution Control Department (PCD) was ordered by the Supreme Administrative Court to pay nine billion baht in compensation to a consortium of contractors building the Klong Dan wastewater treatment plant due to the state&#x27;s termination of that project in 2003. In July 2016, the Department of Special Investigation (DSI) initiated an investigation of a private consortium, NVPSKG, for corrupt practices related to the 90 percent completed project. In 2015, three senior Pollution Control Department (PCD) employees linked to the consortium were jailed for 20 years for malfeasance. In July 2018 the supreme court sentenced 11 persons, including the former deputy interior minister, to between three and six years in prison. The court found the defendants guilty of fraud in the purchase of 1,900 rai of land at the inflated price of 1.9 billion baht, and irregularities in the construction contract. Public land was fraudulently acquired with title deeds issued to private owners, who then inflated the price before the land was sold to the Thai Pollution Control Department.

<text>Bang Phli (, ) is a district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) of Samut Prakan province in Thailand. It is home to Suvarnabhumi Airport (also called (New) Bangkok International Airport), which opened on 28 September 2006 as Thailand&#x27;s primary airport. The district was part of the once-proposed Nakhon Suvarnabhumi province.

==History==
Bang Phli appeared as evidence that it has been a habitat since the Khmer era (around 435–1158), because many areas around it are names that are derived from Khmer such as Thap Nang, Nam Daeng, Bang Chalong etc. The Khlong Samrong canal, which is long, flows through the area and is considered a main watercourse.

Rattanakosin&#x27;s renowned poet Sunthorn Phu wrote about Khlong Samrong in his work &quot;Nirat Mueang Klaeng&quot; during a visit to his father in Rayong Province. When he arrived here and impressed with the young people that take a boat pass through.

The name &quot;Bang Phli&quot; came from the assumption that when King Naresuan the Great fought with the enemies that came to invade Ayutthaya. He stopped the army here and have performed a ritual called &quot;Bat Phli&quot; to terrorize the enemies and to be an auspicious for the army.

In the reign of King Rama III, Bang Phli became a community where more people came to live, consisting of a variety of people, such as Laotians, Mons with Teochews and Hainanese. Most Chinese have a career in trading and building houses along the waterfront. Therefore, causing Bang Phli to prosper respectively and raised the status to a district in 1895.

==Geography==
Bang Phli district is on the eastern outskirts of Bangkok bisected by the Bang Na-Chonburi Expressway.

Neighbouring districts are Bang Na, Prawet, and Lat Krabang (all in Bangkok) in the north, Bang Sao Thong and Bang Bo to the east, and Mueang Samut Prakan to the south and west.

==Administration==
The district is divided into six sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 83 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;). Bang Phli itself is also a sub-district municipality (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;) which includes parts of &quot;tambons&quot; Bang Phli Yai, Bang Pla, and Bang Chao Long. There are another six tambon administrative organizations (TAO) in the district.

==Economy==
Bang Phli is home to a number of manufacturing companies including Plan Toys; lingerie company, Triumph International; auto parts maker, Yarnphan; Surf Technicians Inc.; windsurfing equipment design company, Natural Corporation; chemical manufacturer, Hanwha Chemical alkali soluble resin (ASR) and emulsion plant; furniture manufacturer, Rockworth;, Hino Motors, and a Nivea cosmetics production plant. The first IKEA store in Thailand opened at Mega Bangna on the Bang Na-Bang Pakong Highway in Bang Kaeo in late-2011.

==Festivals==
Bang Phli is known for its annual Lotus Flower (Rap Bua) Festival, which takes place on the last day of vassa on the fourteenth day of the waxing moon in the eleventh lunar month, usually the full moon in October. A boat carrying a replica of the &quot;Luang Poh To&quot; Buddha statue from the temple Wat Bang Pli Yai Nai is moved along the Khlong Samrong canal. The people on the banks of the canal throw lotus flowers onto the boat, as donating lotus flowers to Buddha is merit-making.

==Attractions==

It was one of the flourishing communities in the past. It is assumed that Chinese opened this market in 1857 to transport goods and people from the east coast to Bangkok.

<text>Phra Pradaeng (, ) is a district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) of Samut Prakan province in Thailand.

==History==
Phra Pradeang was the original center of the area south of Bangkok near the mouth of the Chao Phraya River. Originally named &quot;Nakhon Khuean Khan&quot; (นครเขื่อนขันธ์), it was settled by Mon people. In 1815, King Rama II built the Pom Phlaeng Faifa Fort at the river&#x27;s bend. The fort is now a small park and is accessible to visitors.

In 1819, the new town Mueang Samut Prakan (or Paknam) was established. Due to economic problems in the early-1930s, several administrative entities were abolished, including Phra Phradaeng Province, which had its districts assigned to Samut Prakan and Thonburi effective 1 April 1932.

A two kilometre tramway across the neck of the Phra Pradaeng river bend opened in 1908 and closed c. 1940. Operated by a private company, the motorised trams connected with motorboat services to Bangkok and to Paknam at each end of the line. The tram cut a considerable time off the up and downriver journey by avoiding the long river bend.

==Administration==
The district is divided into 15 sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 67 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;). The town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) Phra Pradaeng covers the &quot;tambon&quot; Talat, the town Lat Luang, the &quot;tambon&quot; Bang Phueng, Bang Chak, and Bang Kharu. The town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) Pu Chao Saming Phrai administers &quot;tambons&quot; Samrong Tai, Samrong, Samron Klang, Bang Hua Suea, and Bang Ya Phraek. There are six tambon administrative organizations (TAO) for the &quot;tambon&quot; not covered by the municipalities.
==Attractions==

<text>Most (; ) is a city in the Ústí nad Labem Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 64,000 inhabitants.

Most is an industrial city with a long tradition of lignite mining. Due to mining, the historic city was demolished and replaced by a planned city. In locations where mining has ended, Most is an example of successful landscape revitalization.

==Administrative division==
Most consists of eight municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Most (58,591)
*Čepirohy (462)
*Komořany (4)
*Rudolice (234)
*Souš (543)
*Starý Most (45)
*Velebudice (227)
*Vtelno (840)
==Etymology==
The name Most means &#x27;bridge&#x27; in Czech. It first appeared as translation of the German name &quot;Brüx&quot; (derived from the German word for &#x27;bridge&#x27;, &quot;Brücke&quot;). The city was named after the system of bridges that crossed the swamps in this area in the 10th century.

==Geography==
Most is located about southwest of Ústí nad Labem and northwest of Prague. It lies on the border between the Most Basin and Central Bohemian Uplands. The highest point is the hill Ressl at above sea level. The Bílina River flows through the city.

There are several artificial lakes created during land rehabilitation after coal mining. The largest of them is Most Lake, created in 2008–2012. With an area of , it is the second largest artificial lake in the country. It is mainly used for sports and recreation. The second notable lake in the centre of Most is Matylda Lake, also used for sports and recreation. It was infused in 1992 and has an area of .

==History==

===11th–15th centuries===

The first written mention of Most is from 1040, when it was mentioned in Latin &quot;Chronica Boemorum&quot; as &quot;Gnevin Pons&quot; (&quot;Hněvín Bridge&quot;). From the end of the 12th century, the Hrabišic dynasty began to colonize the territory and established here a stronghold. Most was originally a market village at the crossroads of old trade routes. After 1210, the villages was moved to the other bank of the river Bílina.

In 1227 Kojata, the last Hrabišic, passed his property to the Zderaz Monastery, but King Wenceslaus I used the right of escheat and took Most from the monastery. Hněvín Castle was built on the site of the old stronghold in 1238–1248. After 1240, Most acquired the character of a town. It was first referred to as a town in 1247. In the mid-13th century, it was promoted to a royal city. King Ottokar II granted the city further privileges in 1273. The city developed rapidly and benefited from its advantageous location near the kingdom&#x27;s borders and on an important road.

During the reign of next kings, the city continued to prosper. In 1321, 1334, 1395 and 1455, the city was damaged by fires. In 1374, Charles IV granted Most the vineyard right, wine has probably been produced here since the 12th century. In the mid-14th century, the city walls were finished. The prosperity ended with the Hussite Wars but in both 1421 and 1424 the city withstood the Hussite siege. Most recovered thanks to the trade route of international importance and thanks to the start of iron ore mining in the nearby Ore Mountains.

===16th–17th centuries===
In 1515, the worst fire in its history hit the city, damaging the church from 1253–1257 and the town hall. Construction of the new church began in 1517, and the new Renaissance city hall was built before 1553. In the second half of the 16th century, the crisis was deepened by crop failures, loans to the king, plague, famine, further fires and Turkish wars. Most went into debt and paid off the debts for the next hundred years. In 1595, the city bought the Hněvín Castle from Emperor Rudolf II and other estates.

In 1639–1648, during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the city was occupied by Swedish troops because of the Hněvín Castle. After the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the city lost much of its economic and political significance. So that the castle would no longer be a reason to besiege the city, the inhabitants of Most asked Emperor Ferdinand III to demolish the castle. The demolition took place in 1651–1653.

===18th–19th centuries===
Huge reserves of coal were discovered in the 18th century. Most was affected by the Silesian Wars when the city had to pay war contributions. After the city&#x27;s economic conditions were consolidated in the second half of the 18th century, Most was affected by the passage of Napoleon&#x27;s army at the beginning of the 19th century. In the first half of the 19th century, the medieval wall were demolished. In 1820, Most was hit by another big fire.

At the beginning of the 19th century, mining of lignite was started. Industrialization began and the turning point was the construction of the railway in 1870, which brought connection with coal outlets. The last quarter of the 19th century saw a rapid increase in the number of inhabitants and newly built apartments, and there was an influx of the Czech population. A sugar factory, a porcelain factory, a steel factory, a brewery and a city museum were built.

===20th century===
In 1938, Most was annexed by Nazi Germany. Under German occupation from 1938 until 1945, the city was administered as a part of the &quot;Regierungsbezirk Aussig&quot; of the Reichsgau Sudetenland. In 1944, there was a subcamp of the Flossenbürg concentration camp providing forced labor in coal mines outside Most. The prisoners were mostly Poles. Most was repeatedly bombed during the Oil Campaign of World War II. The Germans also operated a Gestapo prison in the city.

After the war, Most was restored to Czechoslovakia. German population was expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement and the city was resettled by Czechs.

In 1964, the Czechoslovak Communist government decided to demolish the historic Most due to the expansion of coal mining, including the Gothic city centre, the brewery founded in 1470, the 1910 theatre, and the cemetery established in 1853. Only the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary was saved. The destruction of the historic city began in 1965 and was finished in 1985. Simultaneously with the start of mining, a new city began to emerge, with the first building finished in 1971. Newly built, standardized blocks of flats (&quot;paneláks&quot;) followed brutalist architecture common for that era. The destruction of Most brought monetary profit to the state as coal was mined in the locality for an estimated 3 billion CSK.

Construction of the new City Hall began in 1972 and was completed in 1977 after construction delays.

The Ležáky coal mine in the place of the historic Most was closed in 1999. Most Lake was created in that location, by filling the former coal mine by water from the Ohře River. It was opened to the public in 2020.

==Demographics==
Most has a significant Romani people community, concentrated especially in the Chanov housing estate.

==Economy==

Most lies on the edge of the Most Basin and is an important lignite-mining region. Since the discovery of huge reserves of coal, the city has been shaped by mining. It caused an influx of residents and the development of other industries, but it also caused the destruction of historic parts of the city. The mining industry still employs hundreds of people; the largest employer in the city is Czech Coal Group.

The Komořany power plant is linked to coal mining. It is a large lignite power plant with a total installed electrical output of 239 MWe, built in 1955–1958.

In addition to mining, heavy industry and chemistry were developed in Most, but in the 21st century they are replaced by services in the composition of the city&#x27;s economy. The mining segment operates not only in the form of coal mining, but also in the framework of extensive land rehabilitation. The cultivation of wine and fruit was also restored. The recultivation of the landscape in the vicinity of Most is unique and appreciated as an effective and sensitive revitalization of the landscape, which is a model for further recultivations. The ouskirts of Most have become attractive for tourism.

==Transport==
Most is located on the railway lines Prague–Cheb, Kadaň–Děčín and Rakovník–Osek. In addition to the main railway station, the Most-Kopisty and Třebušice stops are also located in the municipal territory.

The city operates a transport company together with the neighbouring town of Litvínov. In addition to buses, there is also the Most–Litvínov tramway network.

==Culture==

The construction of the Repre House of Culture (originally called &quot;Regional House of Culture of Miners and Energy Workers&quot;) started in 1972, but was not completed until 2 June 1984. The building includes a planetarium located on the roof sphere, a cinema and numerous rooms and halls. The city sold the building to the private sector in 2010 and has been subject to numerous replacement and refurbishment proposals.

The new theatre was planned for the new city centre from the late 1960s, but construction did not commence until 1979 and was opened on 7 November 1985. Designed by Ivo Klimeš following his completion winning design in 1969, it features a 500 seat auditorium and was called Divadlo Pracujících (&quot;Theatre of the Working People&quot;) until 1990.

==Education==
Three universities have detached workplaces in Most: Czech University of Life Sciences Prague, VSB – Technical University of Ostrava, and University of Finance and Administration.

==Sport==

The local football club FK Baník Most 1909 existed for more than 100 years and used to play in the top tier of Czech football, but it was disestablished in 2016. The city is now represented by FK Baník Most-Souš, playing in the 3rd tier of Czech football.

Most Hippodrome is located in the Velebudice part of Most. The city hosts eight horse racing days per year, and is thus one of the leading horse racing locations in the region. The area with the race track was created during the reclamation of the landscape and is also used for other sports and cultural events.

Most is known for Autodrom Most, a race track for motorsport opened in 1983.

Aquadrom Most is a water park located in the centre of Most.

==Sights==
Hněvín Castle belongs to the main landmarks of the city. After the original castle was demolished in 1651–1653, the current romantic castle was built as a copy of it. Its main part is a stone lookout tower, built in 1900.

The most important monument is the Gothic Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary. It was built in 1517–1602, after the old city church was destroyed by a huge fire in 1515. The church became famous when it was moved away to the newly constructed town in 1975, due to the demolition of the historic centre of the old town. The move took 28 days to complete with an average speed of per minute. The Czechoslovak government took pride in the relocation of this religious structure, and the building was mentioned in the Golden Guinness Book Of World Records as the heaviest building ever moved on wheels.

The oldest preserved building in Most is the Church of the Holy Spirit. It was probably built in the 1320s and first documented in 1351. The church is small, but it is very valuable due to its preservation and pure Gothic style. After the move of the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary, the churches found themselves next to each other. Today the Church of the Holy Spirit has been desecrated and exhibitions and classical music concerts take place in its premises.

In Vtelno is the Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross. It was built in the Baroque style in 1736–1738.

Among the other monuments are the building of the Regional Museum in Most, Neorenaissance fountain, plague column with the sculptural group of St. Anne, set of Stations of the Cross, and Jewish cemetery in Souš.

==In popular culture==
Most was nationwide popularized by successful TV series &quot;Most!&quot; (2018). It used to be a popular location for filming foreign war films, particularly as period buildings could be realistically exploded for the cameras. Several films were shot here, including &quot;The Bridge at Remagen&quot; (1969), &quot;Slaughterhouse-Five&quot; (1972), &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1979) and &quot;Battle of Moscow&quot; (1985), and Czech films &quot;The Joke&quot; (1969), &quot;Something Like Happiness&quot; (2005), &quot;Dolls&quot; (2007) and &quot;ROMing&quot; (2007).

<text>Phra Samut Chedi (, ) is the westernmost district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) of Samut Prakan province in central Thailand.

==Geography==
Neighboring districts are (from the west, clockwise) Bang Khun Thian and Thung Khru of Bangkok, Phra Pradaeng and (across the Chao Phraya River) Mueang Samut Prakan of Samut Prakan Province.

==History==
The district was created as a minor district (&quot;king amphoe&quot;) on 15 December 1984 by splitting off five &quot;tambons&quot; from Mueang district. It was upgraded to a full district on 15 July 1991.

==Administration==
The district is divided into five sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 42 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;). There are two townships (&quot;thesaban tambons&quot;): Phra Samut Chedi covers &quot;tambon&quot; Pak Klong Bang Pla Kot, and Lae Fa Pha covers parts of &quot;tambons&quot; Laem Fa Pha and Nai Khlong Bang Pla Kot. There are a further four tambon administrative organizations (TAO), for each &quot;tambon&quot; except Pak Klong Bang Pla Kot, which has no non-municipal area.
==Environment==
The district&#x27;s coastline has seen severe erosion since the 1990s. Coastal mangrove forests were destroyed then and replaced with shrimp farms. Three to five metres of shoreline has been submerged every year since then, resulting in the loss of 4,000 rai of land to the sea. 

Thailand lost almost one third of its coastal mangrove forests between 1961 and 2000. According to Thailand&#x27;s Department of Marine and Coastal Resources, a quarter of the country&#x27;s shores—about 700 kilometres (500 miles)—are eroding, some &quot;severely&quot;.

==Places==

The district is named after the temple Phra Samut Chedi, which was built 1827–1828 by King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai (Rama II) on an island in the Chao Phraya River—hence its popular name Phra Chedi Klang Nam (&#x27;chedi in the middle of the water&#x27;). The island is now connected with the left river bank.

At the mouth of the Chao Phraya is Chulachomklao Fort, built in 1819 and came into use only once during the Paknam crisis in the same year. The fort is now accessible to visitors. The HTMS &quot;Maeklong&quot;, a former training ship of the Royal Thai Navy, is another attraction in the park.

<doc id="858743" wikidata="Q276709" url="?curid=858743" title="Southern Gothic">
<text>Southern Gothic is an artistic subgenre of fiction, music, film, theatre, and television that are heavily influenced by Gothic elements and the American South. Common themes of Southern Gothic include storytelling of deeply flawed, disturbing, or eccentric characters sometimes suffering from physical deformities or insanity; decayed or derelict settings and grotesque situations; and sinister events bred from poverty, alienation, crime, violence, forbidden sexuality, or hoodoo magic.

== Origins ==
Elements of a Gothic treatment of the South first appeared during the ante- and post-bellum 19th century in the grotesques of Henry Clay Lewis and in the sardonic representations of Mark Twain. The genre was consolidated, however, in the 20th century, when dark romanticism, Southern humor, and the new literary naturalism merged in a new and powerful form of social critique. The themes largely reflected the cultural atmosphere of the South following the collapse of the Confederacy in the Civil War, which left a vacuum of cultural and religious values as well as economic devastation. The poverty and bitterness during the post-war Reconstruction era exacerbated the racism, everyday violence, and religious extremism endemic to the region.

Like the original artistic term &quot;Gothic&quot;, the term &quot;Southern Gothic&quot; was at first pejorative and dismissive. In 1935, Ellen Glasgow critiqued the writings of Erskine Caldwell, William Faulkner, and the &quot;Southern Gothic School&quot;, stating that their work was filled with &quot;aimless violence&quot; and &quot;fantastic nightmares&quot;. The connotation was at first so negative that Eudora Welty said: &quot;They better not call me that!&quot;

== Characteristics ==
The setting of these works is distinctly Southern. Some of these characteristics include exploring madness, decay and despair, continuing pressures of the past upon the present, particularly with the lost ideals of a dispossessed Southern aristocracy and continued racial hostilities.

Southern Gothic particularly focuses on the South&#x27;s history of slavery, racism, fear of the outside world, violence, a &quot;fixation with the grotesque, and a tension between realistic and supernatural elements&quot;.

Similar to the elements of the Gothic castle, Southern Gothic depicts the decay of the plantation in the post-Civil War South.

Villains who disguise themselves as innocents or victims are often found in Southern Gothic literature, especially stories by Flannery O&#x27;Connor, such as &quot;Good Country People&quot; and &quot;The Life You Save May Be Your Own&quot;, giving the reader a blurred line between victim and villain.

Southern Gothic literature set out to expose the myth of the old Antebellum South with its narrative of an idyllic past that covered over social, familial, and racial denials and suppressions.

==Authors==
A resurgence of Southern Gothic themes in contemporary fiction has been identified in the work of figures like Barry Hannah (1942–2010), Joe R. Lansdale (b. 1951), Helen Ellis (b. 1970) and Cherie Priest (b. 1975).

=== Music ===

Southern Gothic (also known as Gothic Americana, or Dark Country) is a genre of American music rooted in early jazz, gospel, Americana, gothic rock and post-punk. Its lyrics often focus on dark subject matter. The genre shares thematic connections with the Southern Gothic genre of literature, and indeed the parameters of what makes something Gothic Americana appears to have more in common with literary genres than traditional musical ones. Songs often examine poverty, criminal behavior, religious imagery, death, ghosts, family, lost love, alcohol, murder, the devil, and betrayal.

Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Nebraska&quot; (1982) was influenced by the writings of Flannery O&#x27;Connor. Athens, Georgia–based alternative rock band R.E.M. displayed a Southern Gothic influence with their third album, &quot;Fables of the Reconstruction&quot; (1985). J.D. Wilkes, frontman of the band Legendary Shack Shakers, described Southern Gothic music as &quot;[taking] an angle that there’s something grotesque and beautiful in the traditions of the South, the backdrop of Southern living.&quot; Ethel Cain&#x27;s music has been described as &quot;Southern Gothic Pop,&quot; often focusing on themes such as intergenerational trauma, Christianity, grotesque violence, poverty, and abuse, and she often credits inspiration to the works of Southern Gothic writers such as Flannery O’Connor.

=== Theatre ===
The Southern Gothic genre comes to the stage in many different ways.

Southern Gothic fiction writers like Carson McCullers and Zora Neale Hurston adapted their own work for the stage in language-heavy productions of &quot;The Member of the Wedding&quot; and &quot;Spunk.&quot;

Playwrights like Tennessee Williams, Beth Henley, and Jacqueline Goldfinger translated elements of Southern Gothic aesthetic to the stage and added theatrical elements such as stylized movement, dialogue, and design. Examples of Southern Gothic plays include the Pulitzer Prize winner &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot; (1948), the popular &quot;The Jacksonian&quot; (2014), and the Yale Prize winner &quot;Bottle Fly&quot; (2018)&quot;.&quot;

In addition, many Southern Gothic novels and short stories have been adapted for the stage by artists who are not the original authors. The Tony Award winning musical &quot;The Color Purple&quot; by Alice Walker is a prime example of this approach to theatricalization of the Southern Gothic genre. &quot;The Color Purple&quot; is an adaptation of the novel with music by Brenda Russell, Allee Willis, Stephen Bray, and Marsha Norman which has been performed around the country constantly since its world premiere at the Alliance Theatre in Atlanta in 2004.

== Photographic representation ==
The images of Great Depression photographer Walker Evans are seen to evoke the visual depiction of the Southern Gothic; Evans claimed: &quot;I can understand why Southerners are haunted by their own landscape&quot;.

Another noted Southern Gothic photographer was surrealist Clarence John Laughlin, who photographed cemeteries, plantations, and other abandoned places throughout the American South (primarily Louisiana) for nearly 40 years.

<text>Bang Sao Thong (; ) is a district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) of Samut Prakan province in central Thailand.

==Geography==
Neighboring districts are Lat Krabang to the north, Bang Bo to the east and Bang Phli to the west.

==History==
Bang Phli New Town (Thai &quot;Mueang Mai Bang Phli&quot;) was established between 1992 and 1993 as a residential area for high-income families. The area around the new town, comprising three &quot;tambons&quot;, was then split off from Bang Phli district and formed the new minor district (&quot;king amphoe&quot;), becoming effective on 1 April 1995.

The Thai government, on 15 May 2007, upgraded all 81 minor districts to full districts. On 24 August 2007 the upgrade became official.

==Economy==
Nissan has an automobile factory in the district. Nissan produces hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) there based on its e-Power technology as well as batteries for electric vehicles. It has a production capacity of 370,000 vehicles a year. 

==Administration==
The district is divided into three sub-districts (&quot;tambon&quot;), which are further subdivided into 39 villages (&quot;muban&quot;). Bang Sao Thong is a township (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;) which covers parts of &quot;tambon&quot; Bang Sao Thong and Sisa Chorakhe Yai. Each of the tambons has a tambon administrative organization (TAO) responsible for non-municipal areas.

<text>Bogan ( ) is Australian and New Zealand slang for a person whose speech, clothing, attitude and behaviour are considered unrefined or unsophisticated. Depending on the context, the term can be pejorative or self-deprecating. The prevalence of the term bogan has also been associated with changing social attitudes towards social class in Australia.

Since the 1980s, the bogan has become a very well-recognised subculture, often as an example of bad taste. It has antecedents in the Australian larrikin and ocker, and various localised names exist that describe the same or very similar people to the bogan.

==History==
The origin of the term &quot;bogan&quot; is unclear; both the &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Australian Oxford Dictionary&quot; cite the origin as unknown. Some Sydney residents&#x27; recollection is that the term is based on the concept that residents of the western suburbs (stereotyped as &quot;Westies&quot;) displayed what are now termed &quot;bogan&quot; characteristics and that an individual who displayed these characteristics to a strong extent was as &quot;west&quot; as the Bogan River in western New South Wales. According to another anecdote, the term emerged in Melbourne&#x27;s outer-western and outer-eastern suburbs in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

Another possible origin may be the 1973 Burt Reynolds film White Lightning (1973 film), which was set in ficticious &quot;Bogan County&quot; in the state of Arkansas. The film, which is partly set at the &quot;Bogan Raceway&quot; dirt track where a modified sedan/demolition derby type race is taking place, is principally a vehicle for Reynolds and other Redneck type characters to indulge in lots of tyre smoking car chases, stunts and &quot;hoon&quot; type driving.

The term &quot;bog&quot; has been used in Perth, Western Australia since at least the late 1960s, and means the same as bogan. The term &quot;bog laps&quot; is still used in Perth to mean the same as &quot;hoon laps&quot; and &quot;blockies&quot; are used to mean in other parts of Australia - driving around in a muscle car doing burnouts or wheelies here and there.

The term became widely known in the late 1980s when the teenage character Kylie Mole (played by Mary-Anne Fahey), in the Australian sketch comedy television series &quot;The Comedy Company&quot;, frequently used the term to disparage anyone she disliked. The same program included a sketch about a magazine called &quot;Bogue&quot; (a parody of &quot;Vogue&quot;), which featured traditional bogans.

The Australian National Dictionary Centre (ANDC) included the word in its Australian dictionary project in 1991 and said the earliest use they found was in the September 1985 issue of surfing magazine &quot;Tracks&quot;: &quot;So what if I have a Mohawk and wear Dr. Martens (boots for all you uninformed bogans)?&quot;

In 2019, Bruce Moore of the Australian National University published a piece in &quot;The Conversation&quot;, in which he suggested an earlier usage or origin of the word, discovered by historian Helen Doyle: an article in a student magazine published at Melbourne&#x27;s Xavier College in 1984, which describes a fictional toy—the &quot;bogan doll&quot;—which possesses many characteristics of the bogan stereotype.

There are places in western New South Wales that contain &quot;bogan&quot; in their name—for example Bogan Shire, the Bogan River and the rural village of Bogan Gate. Bogan Gate, for example, is derived from the local Aboriginal word meaning &quot;the birthplace of a notable headman of the local tribe&quot;. Residents of streets such as Bogan Place and Bogan Road have been moved to action by the negative connotations of their street names and lobbied to rename them, prompting Ku-ring-gai mayor Nick Ebbeck to joke that he was a bit of a bogan himself. The 1902 poem &quot;City of Dreadful Thirst&quot; by Australian poet Banjo Paterson makes reference to a &quot;Bogan shower&quot; as a term meaning &quot;three raindrops and some dust&quot;, although this is likely a reference to the dry area around the Bogan River. Makeshift gates in a rural fence in northwest NSW were known as &quot;bogan gates&quot; at least as early as the 1960s.

== Concept ==

Some features regularly associated with the bogan stereotype include Anglo-Celtic Australians residing in the outer working class suburbs of larger cities, having teeth that have not had dental care due to cost, having an anti-authoritarian or jingoistic stance, as well as being interested in classic rock music, hoon-driving and excessive alcohol consumption.

Certain types of clothing are stereotypically associated with bogans, including flannelette shirts, blue singlets, Stubbie shorts, fluoro (abbreviated from &quot;fluorescent&quot;) workwear, ugg boots, jeans and black leggings.

Vehicles, such as earlier Holdens from FJ to HQ, Toranas, some Commodores, (more so sports variants, especially Peter Brock Commodores), SS models, HSV, and Ford Falcon right up to AU models, particularly modified or poorly-maintained examples, also have similar associations.

A person described as a bogan may refuse to conform to middle-class standards of taste, dietary habits, leisure activities, styles of dress and ways of speaking, and might be looked down upon by some groups due to preconceived perceptions and biases which can often exacerbate the hardships faced by disadvantaged people.

Mel Campbell argued in a 2006 article in &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; that bogan (including &quot;cashed-up bogan&quot;) is a nebulous, personal concept that is frequently used in a process by which &quot;we use the idea of the bogan to quarantine ideas of Australianness that alarm or discomfort us. It&#x27;s a way of erecting imaginary cultural barriers between &#x27;us&#x27; and &#x27;them&#x27;.&quot; Campbell argues that though many people believe they know exactly what a bogan is and what their characteristics might be, there is no defined set of characteristics of a bogan: the speaker imagines the denoted person to be different from, and less cultured than, themselves. Campbell considered &quot;cashed-up bogan&quot; to be a &quot;stupid term&quot;. A similar argument is made by David Nichols, author of &quot;The Bogan Delusion&quot; (2011), who says that people have &quot;created this creature that is a lesser human being to express their interclass hatred&quot;.

== Non-pejorative usage ==
The term bogan has sometimes been used favourably to indicate pride in being rough around the edges. 

In 2002, Michelle Griffin discussed the fact that &quot;bogan&quot; is no longer just being used as an insult, but is in fact a way to identify with the &quot;Aussie&quot; culture that many Anglo-Australian citizens are proud of. In the past, bogan was a term of disdain, but nowadays it has become &quot;cool&quot; to be a bogan. 

Radio station Triple J held a &quot;National Bogan Day&quot; on 28 June 2002, which they commemorated by playing music by rock bands such as Cold Chisel, Midnight Oil, Rose Tattoo and AC/DC. 

In a 2011 study, linguistics students at the University of Auckland found that the term was likely to be thought of as positive by people under the age of 30, compared with over-30s who generally felt it was more of a negative term.

==Representation==

===Television===
The typical bogan has been portrayed on television in shows such as &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot;, &quot;Bogan Hunters&quot;, &quot;Fat Pizza&quot;, &quot;Housos&quot;, &quot;Bogan Pride&quot;, &quot;Kath &amp; Kim&quot;, &quot;Upper Middle Bogan&quot; and &quot;Regular Old Bogan&quot;.

Peter (pronounced &#x27;Poi-da&#x27;) was a recurring bogan character played by Eric Bana on 1990s sketch comedy show &quot;Full Frontal&quot;.

===Film===
In the 2016 film &quot;Suicide Squad&quot;, DC Comics villain Captain Boomerang—a classically Australian character—is depicted as having a bogan-esque personality.

===Internet===
The popular website (and 2010 bestselling book) &quot;Things Bogans Like&quot; contains 250 articles on various things that bogans are claimed to like, and suggests that a &quot;bogan today defies income, class, race, creed, gender and logic&quot;.

In 2007 Microsoft deemed &quot;bogan&quot; to be one of twenty colloquialisms most relevant to Australian users when the word was added to the dictionary of Microsoft Office 2007. The word entered the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in June 2012.

The word &quot;bogan&quot; attracts negative attention online towards Anglo-Australians, and consequently boganbroadcast is actively campaigning to reclaim the term in a positive way.

===Apps===
An app known as &quot;The Bogan Test&quot; has been created to examine a person&#x27;s likelihood to fall within the boundaries of the bogan category.

===Music===
Melbourne band This Is Serious Mum (TISM) sing about discrimination from coming from &quot;the Western Suburbs&quot; in &quot;The History of Western Civilization&quot; on the &#x27;Hot Dogma&#x27; album released in 1990. 

Australian ska-punk band Area-7 achieved one of their biggest hits with the song &quot;Nobody Likes A Bogan&quot;, released in 2002.

Ben Folds included the lyric &quot;Now I see the Bogans at the motor race&quot; in his song &quot;Adelaide&quot; from his &#x27;Super D&#x27; EP, released in 2004.

==Use in marketing==
&quot;CUB&quot; or &quot;cashed up bogan&quot; was used by social analyst David Chalke in 2006 to describe people of a blue collar background now earning a high salary and spending their earnings on expensive consumer items as a matter of conspicuous consumption. The media have cited tennis player Lleyton Hewitt and his actress wife, Bec Cartwright, as examples. Subsequently, the Kaesler Winery, in the Barossa Valley, released a Shiraz wine under the name Bogan.

==Regional equivalent terms==
&quot;The Courier-Mail&quot; described &quot;bogan&quot; as peerless, and that it warrants acceptance as an Australian keyword. It also wrote &quot;There are plenty of other words purporting to describe the same social and cultural subset or behaviour, but &#x27;bogan&#x27; really does stand alone&quot;.

Although the term &quot;bogan&quot; is understood across Australia and New Zealand, certain regions have their own slang terms for the same group of people. These terms include:

* &quot;Bevan&quot; or &quot;Bev&quot; in Queensland.
* &quot;Booner&quot; in Canberra.
* &quot;Chigger&quot; (also &quot;chigga&quot; or &quot;chig&quot;) in Tasmania. This appears to be a reference to the Hobart suburb of Chigwell.
* &quot;Scozza&quot; in Geelong, Victoria, Australia.

&quot;Westie&quot; or &quot;westy&quot; is not synonymous with bogan, although westies are often stereotyped as being bogans. &quot;Westie&quot; predates bogan, originating in Sydney in the 1970s to refer to people from that city&#x27;s western suburbs. As Sydney&#x27;s western suburbs are predominantly working class blue collar areas, the term connotes a predominantly working class blue collar person – someone with little education, little taste, and very limited horizons. &quot;Westie&quot; is now in wide use in many cities and towns across both Australia and New Zealand, where it especially refers to the denizens of West Auckland.

<text>The Local Government Act 1985 (c. 51) is an Act of Parliament in the United Kingdom. Its main effect was to abolish the six county councils of the metropolitan counties that had been set up by the Local Government Act 1972, along with the Greater London Council that had been established in 1965. In their place many single purpose authorities known collectively as &#x27;joint authorities&#x27; were established for fire service, police and passenger transport. An ad hoc education authority was established for Inner London and a planning authority for Greater London. The legislation permitted councils to form &#x27;joint arrangements&#x27; for waste disposal and other services that they wished to provide together. Time-limited residuary bodies were created to dispose of the assets of the former authorities.

==Background==
Following the victory of the Conservative Party at the 1979 general election, Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government were involved in a series of high-profile disputes with the GLC and Metropolitan County Councils. All of the authorities were controlled by, or came under the control of the opposition Labour Party during Thatcher&#x27;s first term. The Conservative manifesto for the 1983 general election pledged their abolition, describing the councils as &quot;a wasteful and unnecessary tier of government&quot;. Having won a landslide victory in the 1983 General Election, the government published a white paper in October of that year, &quot;Streamlining the cities&quot;. Its proposals formed the basis of the Local Government Bill.

==Provisions==
The core provision, section 1, stated that &quot;the Greater London Council; and the metropolitan county councils&quot; shall cease to exist. It came into effect on 1 April 1986, with some powers being devolved to the metropolitan boroughs themselves and London boroughs and others to joint authorities (such as for fire or police purposes) consisting of members of each of the metropolitan district councils within each county. At the time of the Act, one third of the population of England were living in Greater London and the metropolitan counties.

Time-limited residuary bodies were created to handle the disposal of the councils&#x27; assets. Part III of the Act also set up the Inner London Education Authority, which had previously been a committee of the GLC responsible for education in Inner London, as a directly elected body. This was to remain in existence for only three years.

The Local Government Act 1972 allowed councils to voluntarily form joint committees to provide services together and the Local Government Act 1985 extended this principle by directing local authorities to form some shared arrangements whilst permitting them to form others as they wished.

<text>Thomas Fasti Dinesen (9 August 1892 – 10 March 1979) was a Danish recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. He was the younger brother of the author Karen Blixen (who used the pen name Isak Dinesen).

==Details==
He was born in an affluent and landed (but bourgeois rather than aristocratic) family in Rungsted, Denmark. Following the outbreak of the First World War, Dinesen attempted to enlist in the British, French, and United States armies, before finally being accepted by the Canadian Corps in 1917. He enlisted in the 236th Battalion (New Brunswick Kilties), CEF before transferring to the 42nd Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force: the Royal Highlander Regiment, known as the Black Watch of Canada. The MacLean Kilties were the 236th Canadian Battalion, recruited in Nova Scotia. It reached England in 1917 and was broken up for reinforcements.

During the Battle of Amiens he was 26 years old, and a private in the 42nd Quebec Regiment (Royal Highlanders of Canada) Battalion, Canadian Expeditionary Force when, on 12 August 1918 at Parvillers, France, he displayed conspicuous bravery when, five times in succession, he rushed forward alone against entrenched enemy troops and put hostile guns out of action. He was credited with killing 12 of the enemy using both bayonet and grenade, and with inspiring his comrades at a very critical stage of the action.

For this action, Dinesen was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC). He also received the French Croix de guerre. His name appears on the List of Canadian Victoria Cross recipients.

He was commissioned and later achieved the rank of lieutenant.

On 7 August 1918, whilst waiting to go into action, Dinesen wrote of his night in Gentelles Wood: &#x27;All day long we rested in this pleasant spot – we even had permission to make a little fire here and there under a thickly branched tree and do a bit of cooking. The regular meals are good and plentiful, of course, but we never miss a chance of eating unlimited quantities of extra food. The last tin of baked beans was opened – there&#x27;s no reason to go into battle with a haversack heavier than was absolutely necessary! We washed and shaved carefully in order to look our best before Fritz ... Our equipment was inspected for the last time: Gas-masks, rifles, ammunition, shaving kit, iron rations – everything was OK. Some of us were presented with an extra gift – mine was a big and heavy bag containing a dozen or so Mills bombs! Just before sunset we had to fall in for a final parade. Then supper – and at 10pm we were again fighting our way through the throng on the Amiens–Roye road.&#x27; 

Thomas&#x27;s sister, the famous Danish author Karen (whom he, and most of their Danish friends, called &quot;Tanne&quot;), later wrote that her brother&#x27;s bravery, and the recognition from the British Crown, in some measure saved her own reputation in the community of British colonials among whom she lived in British East Africa. According to Blixen, she had inadvertently alienated many of her neighbors by helping to buy horses for a German officer she met on board ship while sailing to Kenya for the first time. Only months later this officer, General Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck, was named commander of the German forces in East Africa, and waged an effective campaign against Blixen&#x27;s English neighbors. Blixen commented that the suspicion and resentment this aroused in her fellow colonists only subsided after her brother won the VC.

==Life after the war==
In 1918, Thomas Dinesen moved to British East Africa to help his sister manage her coffee farm in the Ngong hills southwest of Nairobi. He was his mercurial sister&#x27;s most reliable confidant. He designed and largely built the farm&#x27;s coffee-roasting plant (which later burned down). Early in 1923, Thomas left the colonial life and returned to Denmark.

In his later years he took up writing, and wrote a number of books in Danish. The best known is &quot;Tanne&quot;, about his famous sister. In 1929 he published the book &quot;No man&#x27;s land: En dansker med canadierne ved vestfronten.&quot; It was translated into English in 1930 under the title &quot;Merry Hell!: A Dane with the Canadians.&quot; The book describes his troublesome way to the Western Front as well as the events that won him the VC.

He died in 1979. He is buried in Hørsholm Churchyard, Hørsholm, Denmark. His VC and other medals are held in the Lord Ashcroft VC collection in the Imperial War Museum.

<text>Little Canada (French: &quot;le petit Canada&quot;) is a name for any of the various communities where French Canadians congregated upon emigrating to the United States, in particular New England, in the 19th and early 20th centuries. A variant of Canadian French known as New England French is still spoken in parts of New England.

==History==
Some early emigrants relocated to the United States because they had chosen to side with the Americans during the American Revolution. Parish archives of Old St. Joseph&#x27;s Church in Philadelphia record trips made by Jesuit Father Ferdinand Steinmeyer (Father Farmer) to the Revolutionary War depot near Fishkill, New York, where he baptized over a dozen children of French-Canadian and Acadian parents. Most of the men were members of the 1st Canadian Regiment of the Continental Army, recruited in 1775 by James Livingston in anticipation of an invasion of northeastern Quebec. As the expedition failed, they, their families, and the American militias were driven out of Canada.

Approximately 900,000 French-Canadians emigrated to the United States in the period of 1840-1930 as part of the Quebec diaspora. The vast majority of these francophones settled in the six New England states: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island and Vermont, as well as northern New York state.

Emigrants moved to states close to Quebec, particularly those bordering the province, because of their generally impoverished condition and lack of jobs as a result of a poor economy over-reliant on agriculture. In the 19th century, the United States was one of the most industrialised and prosperous nations on earth. The emigrants left behind a traditional rural society to enter an industrial world. Centers of the New England textile and other manufacturing industries such as Lowell, Massachusetts; Gardner, Massachusetts; Holyoke, Massachusetts; Manchester, New Hampshire; Lewiston, Maine; and Woonsocket, Rhode Island were major destinations for Quebec laborers.

French Canadians from other provinces often moved elsewhere: those from Ontario typically emigrated to Illinois and Michigan, while those from Manitoba and other Western provinces usually emigrated to Minnesota and Wisconsin. Minneapolis and Saint Paul, Minnesota, boasted a large French Canadian community in 1900.

One of the more famous &quot;Little Canadas&quot; was the West Side of Manchester, New Hampshire, a city with a large French-speaking population due to the recruitment of laborers in Quebec to work in the textile mills in the 19th and 20th centuries. &quot;La Caisse Populaire Ste. Marie&quot;, or St. Mary&#x27;s Bank, located in Manchester&#x27;s Little Canada, was the first credit union chartered in the United States, specifically founded to serve the French Canadian population. The credit union, or &quot;people&#x27;s bank&quot; (&quot;la caisse populaire&quot;) was a financial institution pioneered in Quebec by Quebecers who had difficulty obtaining credit from banks controlled by anglophone Canadians.

The most noted resident of Manchester&#x27;s &quot;petit Canada&quot; was Grace Metalious, author of the best-selling novel &quot;Peyton Place&quot;. Metalious denied her French Canadian heritage and mostly lived in non-French Canadian neighborhoods in Manchester, due to her mother&#x27;s desire to avoid prejudice. During World War II, Metalious eventually had to live in Little Canada after her husband went off to war due to a housing shortage.

In contrast, novelist Robert Cormier of Leominster, Massachusetts, highlighted the culture of fictitious but representative Little Canadas in New England in many of his works, notably &quot;Frenchtown Summer.&quot;

Revlon founder Charles Revson, of Russian-Jewish extraction, grew up in a cold-water tenement in Manchester&#x27;s Little Canada.

Other prominent Little Canadas were found in Lowell, Massachusetts, the home of novelist Jack Kerouac, and Lewiston, Maine. Another notable Franco-American community sprang up in Fall River in southeastern Massachusetts. As a result, a number of cultural and charitable organizations, such as the Franco-American Civic League, the Club Richelieu, La Fédération Catholique Franco-Américaine de Fall River, and L&#x27;Association Culturelle Française de Fall River, were founded to foster French language and culture within the Franco-American community.

Today, New England French (essentially a variety of Canadian French) is spoken in parts of New England, in particular Maine.

<text>The Black Arts Movement (BAM) was an African-American-led art movement that was active during the 1960s and 1970s. Through activism and art, BAM created new cultural institutions and conveyed a message of black pride. The movement expanded from the accomplishments of artists of the Harlem Renaissance.

Famously referred to by Larry Neal as the &quot;aesthetic and spiritual sister of Black Power&quot;, BAM applied these same political ideas to art and literature. and artists found new inspiration in their African heritage as a way to present the black experience in America. Artists such as Aaron Douglas, Hale Woodruff, and Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller pioneered the movement with a distinctly modernist aesthetic. This style influenced the proliferation of African American art during the twentieth century. 

The poet and playwright Amiri Baraka is widely recognized as the founder of BAM. In 1965, he established the Black Arts Repertory Theatre School (BART/S) in Harlem. Baraka&#x27;s example inspired many others to create organizations across the United States. While many of these organizations were short-lived, their work has had a lasting influence. Some still exist, including the National Black Theatre, founded by Barabara Ann Teer in Harlem, New York.

== Background ==

African Americans had always made valuable artistic contributions to American culture. However, due to brutalities of slavery and the systemic racism of Jim Crow, these contributions often went unrecognized. Despite continued oppression, African-American artists continued to create literature and art that would reflect their experiences. A high-point for these artists was the Harlem Renaissance—a literary era that spotlighted black people.

=== Harlem Renaissance ===
There are many parallels that can be made between the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Arts Movement. The link is so strong, in fact, that some scholars refer to the Black Arts Movement era as the Second Renaissance. One sees this connection clearly when reading Langston Hughes&#x27;s &quot;The Negro Artist and the Racial Mountain&quot; (1926). Hughes&#x27;s seminal essay advocates that black writers resist external attempts to control their art, arguing instead that the &quot;truly great&quot; black artist will be the one who can fully embrace and freely express his blackness.

Yet, the Harlem Renaissance lacked many of the radical political stances that defined BAM. Inevitably, the Renaissance, and many of its ideas, failed to survive the Great Depression.

=== Civil Rights Movement ===
During the Civil Rights era, activists paid more and more attention to the political uses of art. The contemporary work of those like James Baldwin and Chester Himes would show the possibility of creating a new &#x27;black aesthetic&#x27;. A number of art groups were established during this period, such as the Umbra Poets and the Spiral Arts Alliance, which can be seen as precursors to BAM.

Art was seen as a way to decompress from the upheaval of the civil rights era by, for example, the ceramicist Marva Lee Pitchford-Jolly, the maker of &#x27;Story Pots&#x27;. 

Civil Rights activists were also interested in creating black-owned media outlets, establishing journals (such as &quot;Freedomways&quot;, &quot;Black Dialogue&quot;, &quot;The Liberator&quot;, &quot;The Black Scholar and Soul Book&quot;) and publishing houses (such as Dudley Randall&#x27;s Broadside Press and Third World Press.) It was through these channels that BAM would eventually spread its art, literature, and political messages.

==Developments==
The beginnings of the Black Arts Movement may be traced to 1965, when Amiri Baraka, at that time still known as Leroi Jones, moved uptown to establish the Black Arts Repertory Theatre/School (BARTS) following the assassination of Malcolm X. Rooted in the Nation of Islam, the Black Power movement and the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Arts Movement grew out of a changing political and cultural climate in which Black artists attempted to create politically engaged work that explored the African American cultural and historical experience. Black artists and intellectuals such as Baraka made it their project to reject older political, cultural, and artistic traditions.

Although the success of sit-ins and public demonstrations of the Black student movement in the 1960s may have &quot;inspired black intellectuals, artists, and political activists to form politicized cultural groups&quot;, many Black Arts activists rejected the non-militant integrational ideologies of the Civil Rights Movement and instead favored those of the Black Liberation Struggle, which emphasized &quot;self-determination through self-reliance and Black control of significant businesses, organization, agencies, and institutions.&quot; According to the Academy of American Poets, &quot;African American artists within the movement sought to create politically engaged work that explored the African American cultural and historical experience.&quot; The importance that the movement placed on Black autonomy is apparent through the creation of institutions such as the Black Arts Repertoire Theatre School (BARTS), created in the spring of 1964 by Baraka and other Black artists. The opening of BARTS in New York City often overshadow the growth of other radical Black Arts groups and institutions all over the United States. In fact, transgressional and international networks, those of various Left and nationalist (and Left nationalist) groups and their supports, existed far before the movement gained popularity. Although the creation of BARTS did indeed catalyze the spread of other Black Arts institutions and the Black Arts movement across the nation, it was not solely responsible for the growth of the movement.

Although the Black Arts Movement was a time filled with black success and artistic progress, the movement also faced social and racial ridicule. The leaders and artists involved called for Black Art to define itself and speak for itself from the security of its own institutions. For many of the contemporaries the idea that somehow black people could express themselves through institutions of their own creation and with ideas whose validity was confirmed by their own interests and measures was absurd.

While it is easy to assume that the movement began solely in the Northeast, it actually started out as &quot;separate and distinct local initiatives across a wide geographic area&quot;, eventually coming together to form the broader national movement. New York City is often referred to as the &quot;birthplace&quot; of the Black Arts Movement, because it was home to many revolutionary Black artists and activists. However, the geographical diversity of the movement opposes the misconception that New York (and Harlem, especially) was the primary site of the movement.

In its beginning states, the movement came together largely through printed media. Journals such as &quot;Liberator&quot;, &quot;The Crusader&quot;, and &quot;Freedomways&quot; created &quot;a national community in which ideology and aesthetics were debated and a wide range of approaches to African-American artistic style and subject displayed.&quot; These publications tied communities outside of large Black Arts centers to the movement and gave the general black public access to these sometimes exclusive circles.

As a literary movement, Black Arts had its roots in groups such as the Umbra Workshop. Umbra (1962) was a collective of young Black writers based in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side; major members were writers Steve Cannon, Tom Dent, Al Haynes, David Henderson, Calvin C. Hernton, Joe Johnson, Norman Pritchard, Lennox Raphael, Ishmael Reed, Lorenzo Thomas, James Thompson, Askia M. Touré (Roland Snellings; also a visual artist), Brenda Walcott, and musician-writer Archie Shepp. Touré, a major shaper of &quot;cultural nationalism&quot;, directly influenced Jones. Along with Umbra writer Charles Patterson and Charles&#x27;s brother, William Patterson, Touré joined Jones, Steve Young, and others at BARTS.

Umbra, which produced &quot;Umbra Magazine&quot;, was the first post-civil rights Black literary group to make an impact as radical in the sense of establishing their own voice distinct from, and sometimes at odds with, the prevailing white literary establishment. The attempt to merge a black-oriented activist thrust with a primarily artistic orientation produced a classic split in Umbra between those who wanted to be activists and those who thought of themselves as primarily writers, though to some extent all members shared both views. Black writers have always had to face the issue of whether their work was primarily political or aesthetic. Moreover, Umbra itself had evolved out of similar circumstances: in 1960 a Black nationalist literary organization, On Guard for Freedom, had been founded on the Lower East Side by Calvin Hicks. Its members included Nannie and Walter Bowe, Harold Cruse (who was then working on &quot;The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual&quot;, 1967), Tom Dent, Rosa Guy, Joe Johnson, LeRoi Jones, and Sarah E. Wright, and others. On Guard was active in a famous protest at the United Nations of the American-sponsored Bay of Pigs Cuban invasion and was active in support of the Congolese liberation leader Patrice Lumumba. From On Guard, Dent, Johnson, and Walcott along with Hernton, Henderson, and Touré established Umbra.

In 1967, the Visual Arts Workshop of the Organization of Black American Culture, composed of several artists such as Jeff Donaldson, William Walker, and more, painted the &quot;Wall of Respect&quot; which was a mural that represented the Black Arts Movement; what it stood for and who it was celebrating. The mural commemorated several important black figures such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, along with artists such as Aretha Franklin and Gwendolyn Brooks, etc. It was a renowned symbol of the movement, placed in Chicago, that represented black culture and creativity, and was met with a lot of attention, support, and respect from the black community. It was a symbolic and important representation of the Black Arts Movement, as it directly celebrated and acknowledged the iconic figures of the Black community through art, emphasizing the importance of art for the community. Furthermore, it left a legacy and served as a beacon for the Black community, promoting Black consciousness and helping many Black people to learn and recognize their worth. In the eight years following the installation of the mural, over 1,500 murals were painted in black neighborhoods across the country, and by 1975, over 200 were painted in Chicago. It brought the community together symbolically, and literally, as rival gangs even declared the location of the mural to be neutral ground, supporting the artists and the movement.

In 1968, renowned Black theorist Barbara Ann Teer founded the National Black Theatre, located in Harlem, New York. Teer was an American writer, producer, teacher, actress and social visionary. Teer was an important black female intellectual, artist, and activist who contributed to the Black Arts Movement. Her theater was one of the first revenue generating Black theaters in the US. Teer&#x27;s art was politically and socially conscious and like many other contributors to the BAM, embraced African aesthetics, and rejected traditional theatrical notions of time and space. Teer&#x27;s revolutionary and ritualistic dramas and plays blurred the lines between performers and audience, &quot;encouraging all to use the performance event itself as an opportunity to bring about social change.&quot; 

===Authors===
Another formation of black writers at that time was the Harlem Writers Guild, led by John O. Killens, which included Maya Angelou, Jean Carey Bond, Rosa Guy, and Sarah Wright among others. But the Harlem Writers Guild focused on prose, primarily fiction, which did not have the mass appeal of poetry performed in the dynamic vernacular of the time. Poems could be built around anthems, chants, and political slogans, and thereby used in organizing work, which was not generally the case with novels and short stories. Moreover, the poets could and did publish themselves, whereas greater resources were needed to publish fiction. That Umbra was primarily poetry- and performance-oriented established a significant and classic characteristic of the movement&#x27;s aesthetics.
When Umbra split up, some members, led by Askia Touré and Al Haynes, moved to Harlem in late 1964 and formed the nationalist-oriented Uptown Writers Movement, which included poets Yusef Rahman, Keorapetse &quot;Willie&quot; Kgositsile from South Africa, and Larry Neal. Accompanied by young &quot;New Music&quot; musicians, they performed poetry all over Harlem. Members of this group joined LeRoi Jones in founding BARTS.

Jones&#x27;s move to Harlem was short-lived. In December 1965 he returned to his home, Newark (N.J.), and left BARTS in serious disarray. BARTS failed but the Black Arts center concept was irrepressible, mainly because the Black Arts movement was so closely aligned with the then-burgeoning Black Power movement.
The mid-to-late 1960s was a period of intense revolutionary ferment. Beginning in 1964, rebellions in Harlem and Rochester, New York, initiated four years of long hot summers. Watts, Detroit, Newark, Cleveland, and many other cities went up in flames, culminating in nationwide explosions of resentment and anger following the April 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.

Nathan Hare, author of &quot;The Black Anglo-Saxons&quot; (1965), was the founder of 1960s Black Studies. Expelled from Howard University, Hare moved to San Francisco State University, where the battle to establish a Black Studies department was waged during a five-month strike during the 1968–69 school year. As with the establishment of Black Arts, which included a range of forces, there was broad activity in the Bay Area around Black Studies, including efforts led by poet and professor Sarah Webster Fabio at Merrit College.

The initial thrust of Black Arts ideological development came from the Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM), a national organization with a strong presence in New York City. Both Touré and Neal were members of RAM. After RAM, the major ideological force shaping the Black Arts movement was the US (as opposed to &quot;them&quot;) organization led by Maulana Karenga. Also ideologically important was Elijah Muhammad&#x27;s Chicago-based Nation of Islam. These three formations provided both style and conceptual direction for Black Arts artists, including those who were not members of these or any other political organization. Although the Black Arts Movement is often considered a New York-based movement, two of its three major forces were located outside New York City.

===Locations===

As the movement matured, the two major locations of Black Arts&#x27; ideological leadership, particularly for literary work, were California&#x27;s Bay Area because of the &quot;Journal of Black Poetry&quot; and &quot;The Black Scholar&quot;, and the Chicago–Detroit axis because of &quot;Negro Digest/Black World&quot; and Third World Press in Chicago, and Broadside Press and Naomi Long Madgett&#x27;s Lotus Press in Detroit. The only major Black Arts literary publications to come out of New York were the short-lived (six issues between 1969 and 1972) &quot;Black Theatre&quot; magazine, published by the New Lafayette Theatre, and &quot;Black Dialogue&quot;, which had actually started in San Francisco (1964–1968) and relocated to New York (1969–1972).

Although the journals and writing of the movement greatly characterized its success, the movement placed a great deal of importance on collective oral and performance art. Public collective performances drew a lot of attention to the movement, and it was often easier to get an immediate response from a collective poetry reading, short play, or street performance than it was from individual performances.

The people involved in the Black Arts Movement used the arts as a way to liberate themselves. The movement served as a catalyst for many different ideas and cultures to come alive. This was a chance for African Americans to express themselves in a way that most would not have expected.

In 1967, LeRoi Jones visited Karenga in Los Angeles and became an advocate of Karenga&#x27;s philosophy of Kawaida. Kawaida, which produced the &quot;Nguzo Saba&quot; (seven principles), Kwanzaa, and an emphasis on African names, was a multifaceted, categorized activist philosophy. Jones also met Bobby Seale and Eldridge Cleaver and worked with a number of the founding members of the Black Panthers. Additionally, Askia Touré was a visiting professor at San Francisco State and was to become a leading (and long-lasting) poet as well as, arguably, the most influential poet-professor in the Black Arts movement. Playwright Ed Bullins and poet Marvin X had established Black Arts West, and Dingane Joe Goncalves had founded the &quot;Journal of Black Poetry&quot; (1966). This grouping of Ed Bullins, Dingane Joe Goncalves, LeRoi Jones, Sonia Sanchez, Askia M. Touré, and Marvin X became a major nucleus of Black Arts leadership.

As the movement grew, ideological conflicts arose and eventually became too great for the movement to continue to exist as a large, coherent collective.

===The Black Aesthetic===
Although The Black Aesthetic was first coined by Larry Neal in 1968, across all the discourse, The Black Aesthetic has no overall real definition agreed by all Black Aesthetic theorists. It is loosely defined, without any real consensus besides that the theorists of The Black Aesthetic agree that &quot;art should be used to galvanize the black masses to revolt against their white capitalist oppressors&quot;. Pollard also argues in her critique of the Black Arts Movement that The Black Aesthetic &quot;celebrated the African origins of the Black community, championed black urban culture, critiqued Western aesthetics, and encouraged the production and reception of black arts by black people&quot;. In &quot;The Black Arts Movement&quot; by Larry Neal, where the Black Arts Movement is discussed as &quot;aesthetic and spiritual sister of the Black Power concept&quot;, The Black Aesthetic is described by Neal as being the merge of the ideologies of Black Power with the artistic values of African expression. Larry Neal attests:&quot;When we speak of a &#x27;Black aesthetic&#x27; several things are meant. First, we assume that there is already in existence the basis for such an aesthetic. Essentially, it consists of an African-American cultural tradition. But this aesthetic is finally, by implication, broader than that tradition. It encompasses most of the usable elements of the Third World culture. The motive behind the Black aesthetic is the destruction of the white thing, the destruction of white ideas, and white ways of looking at the world.&quot;The Black Aesthetic also refers to ideologies and perspectives of art that center on Black culture and life. This Black Aesthetic encouraged the idea of Black separatism, and in trying to facilitate this, hoped to further strengthen black ideals, solidarity, and creativity.

In &quot;The Black Aesthetic&quot; (1971), Addison Gayle argues that Black artists should work exclusively on uplifting their identity while refusing to appease white folks. The Black Aesthetic work as a &quot;corrective&quot;, where black people are not supposed to desire the &quot;ranks of Norman Mailer or a William Styron&quot;. Black people are encouraged by Black artists that take their own Black identity, reshaping and redefining themselves for themselves by themselves via art as a medium. Hoyt Fuller defines The Black Aesthetic &quot;in terms of the cultural experiences and tendencies expressed in artist&#x27; work&quot; while another meaning of The Black Aesthetic comes from Ron Karenga, who argues for three main characteristics to The Black Aesthetic and Black art itself: functional, collective, and committing. Karenga says, &quot;Black Art must expose the enemy, praise the people, and support the revolution&quot;. The notion &quot;art for art&#x27;s sake&quot; is killed in the process, binding the Black Aesthetic to the revolutionary struggle, a struggle that is the reasoning behind reclaiming Black art in order to return to African culture and tradition for Black people. Under Karenga&#x27;s definition of The Black Aesthetic, art that does not fight for the Black Revolution is not considered as art at all, needed the vital context of social issues as well as an artistic value.

Among these definitions, the central theme that is the underlying connection of the Black Arts, Black Aesthetic, and Black Power movements is then this: the idea of group identity, which is defined by Black artists of organizations as well as their objectives.

The narrowed view of The Black Aesthetic, often described as Marxist by critics, brought upon conflicts of the Black Aesthetic and Black Arts Movement as a whole in areas that drove the focus of African culture; In &quot;The Black Arts Movement and Its Critics&quot;, David Lionel Smith argues in saying &quot;The Black Aesthetic&quot;, one suggests a single principle, closed and prescriptive in which just really sustains the oppressiveness of defining race in one single identity. The search of finding the true &quot;blackness&quot; of Black people through art by the term creates obstacles in achieving a refocus and return to African culture. Smith compares the statement &quot;The Black Aesthetic&quot; to &quot;Black Aesthetics&quot;, the latter leaving multiple, open, descriptive possibilities. The Black Aesthetic, particularly Karenga&#x27;s definition, has also received additional critiques; Ishmael Reed, author of Neo-HooDoo Manifesto, argues for artistic freedom, ultimately against Karenga&#x27;s idea of the Black Aesthetic, which Reed finds limiting and something he cannot ever sympathize to. The example Reed brings up is if a Black artist wants to paint black guerrillas, that is okay, but if the Black artist &quot;does so only deference to Ron Karenga, something&#x27;s wrong&quot;. The focus of blackness in context of maleness was another critique raised with the Black Aesthetic. Pollard argues that the art made with the artistic and social values of the Black Aesthetic emphasizes on the male talent of blackness, and it is uncertain whether the movement only includes women as an afterthought.

As there begins a change in the Black population, Trey Ellis points out other flaws in his essay &quot;The New Black Aesthetic&quot;. Blackness in terms of cultural background can no longer be denied in order to appease or please white &quot;or&quot; black people. From mulattos to a &quot;post-bourgeois movement driven by a second generation of middle class&quot;, blackness is not a singular identity as the phrase &quot;The Black Aesthetic&quot; forces it to be but rather multifaceted and vast.

BAM also turned to the religious tradition of voodoo in defining black aesthetics. James Baldwin was critical of both the black church and Nation of Islam. He argued that Christianity had only been forced on black people to rationalize and justify slavery and colonization. Nation of Islam failed in its strong mission to separate itself and black people from white people, said Baldwin, especially looking at their culture of expensive suits and cars all the while demonizing white people. Voodoo then became an alternative to Christianity and Islam for BAM. The historical tradition of voodoo among enslaved Africans had been forgotten in favor of assimilation to the white, Christian identity. The turn to voodoo is therefore regardes as a pan-African reclaiming of the roots. The approximation to voodoo is maybe most clear in the poetry collection &quot;Hoodoo Hollerin Bebop Ghosts&quot; by Larry Neal and the novels &quot;Neo-Hoo-Doo Manifesto&quot; and &quot;Mumbo Jumbo&quot; by Ishmael Reed.

=== Major works ===

==== Black Art ====
Amiri Baraka&#x27;s poem &quot;Black Art&quot; serves as one of his more controversial, poetically profound supplements to the Black Arts Movement. In this piece, Baraka merges politics with art, criticizing poems that are not useful to or adequately representative of the Black struggle. First published in 1966, a period particularly known for the Civil Rights Movement, the political aspect of this piece underscores the need for a concrete and artistic approach to the realistic nature involving racism and injustice. Serving as the recognized artistic component to and having roots in the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Arts Movement aims to grant a political voice to black artists (including poets, dramatists, writers, musicians, etc.). Playing a vital role in this movement, Baraka calls out what he considers to be unproductive and assimilatory actions shown by political leaders during the Civil Rights Movement. He describes prominent Black leaders as being &quot;on the steps of the white house...kneeling between the sheriff&#x27;s thighs negotiating coolly for his people.&quot; Baraka also presents issues of euro-centric mentality, by referring to Elizabeth Taylor as a prototypical model in a society that influences perceptions of beauty, emphasizing its influence on individuals of white and black ancestry. Baraka aims his message toward the Black community, with the purpose of coalescing African Americans into a unified movement, devoid of white influences. &quot;Black Art&quot; serves as a medium for expression meant to strengthen that solidarity and creativity, in terms of the Black Aesthetic. Baraka believes poems should &quot;shoot...come at you, love what you are&quot; and not succumb to mainstream desires.

He ties this approach into the emergence of hip-hop, which he paints as a movement that presents &quot;live words...and live flesh and coursing blood.&quot; Baraka&#x27;s cathartic structure and aggressive tone are comparable to the beginnings of hip-hop music, which created controversy in the realm of mainstream acceptance, because of its &quot;authentic, un-distilled, unmediated forms of contemporary black urban music.&quot; Baraka believes that integration inherently takes away from the legitimacy of having a Black identity and Aesthetic in an anti-Black world. Through pure and unapologetic blackness, and with the absence of white influences, Baraka believes a black world can be achieved. Though hip-hop has been serving as a recognized salient musical form of the Black Aesthetic, a history of unproductive integration is seen across the spectrum of music, beginning with the emergence of a newly formed narrative in mainstream appeal in the 1950s. Much of Baraka&#x27;s cynical disillusionment with unproductive integration can be drawn from the 1950s, a period of rock and roll, in which &quot;record labels actively sought to have white artists &quot;cover&quot; songs that were popular on the rhythm-and-blues charts&quot; originally performed by African-American artists. The problematic nature of unproductive integration is also exemplified by Run-DMC, an American hip-hop group founded in 1981, who became widely accepted after a calculated collaboration with the rock group Aerosmith on a remake of the latter&#x27;s &quot;Walk This Way&quot; took place in 1986, evidently appealing to young white audiences. Hip-hop emerged as an evolving genre of music that continuously challenged mainstream acceptance, most notably with the development of rap in the 1990s. A significant and modern example of this is Ice Cube, a well-known American rapper, songwriter, and actor, who introduced subgenre of hip-hop known as &quot;gangsta rap&quot;, merged social consciousness and political expression with music. With the 1960s serving as a more blatantly racist period of time, Baraka notes the revolutionary nature of hip-hop, grounded in the unmodified expression through art. This method of expression in music parallels significantly with Baraka&#x27;s ideals presented in &quot;Black Art&quot;, focusing on poetry that is also productively and politically driven.

==== The Revolutionary Theatre ====
&quot;The Revolutionary Theatre&quot; is a 1965 essay by Baraka that was an important contribution to the Black Arts Movement, discussing the need for change through literature and theater arts. He says: &quot;We will scream and cry, murder, run through the streets in agony, if it means some soul will be moved, moved to actual life understanding of what the world is, and what it ought to be.&quot; Baraka wrote his poetry, drama, fiction and essays in a way that would shock and awaken audiences to the political concerns of black Americans, which says much about what he was doing with this essay. It also did not seem coincidental to him that Malcolm X and John F. Kennedy had been assassinated within a few years because Baraka believed that every voice of change in America had been murdered, which led to the writing that would come out of the Black Arts Movement.

In his essay, Baraka says: &quot;The Revolutionary Theatre is shaped by the world, and moves to reshape the world, using as its force the natural force and perpetual vibrations of the mind in the world. We are history and desire, what we are, and what any experience can make us.&quot;

With his thought-provoking ideals and references to a euro-centric society, he imposes the notion that black Americans should stray from a white aesthetic in order to find a black identity. In his essay, he says: &quot;The popular white man&#x27;s theatre like the popular white man&#x27;s novel shows tired white lives, and the problems of eating white sugar, or else it herds bigcaboosed blondes onto huge stages in rhinestones and makes believe they are dancing or singing.&quot; This, having much to do with a white aesthetic, further proves what was popular in society and even what society had as an example of what everyone should aspire to be, like the &quot;bigcaboosed blondes&quot; that went &quot;onto huge stages in rhinestones&quot;. Furthermore, these blondes made believe they were &quot;dancing and singing&quot; which Baraka seems to be implying that white people dancing is not what dancing is supposed to be at all. These allusions bring forth the question of where black Americans fit in the public eye. Baraka says: &quot;We are preaching virtue and feeling, and a natural sense of the self in the world. All men live in the world, and the world ought to be a place for them to live.&quot; Baraka&#x27;s essay challenges the idea that there is no space in politics or in society for black Americans to make a difference through different art forms that consist of, but are not limited to, poetry, song, dance, and art. 

== Effects on society ==

According to the Academy of American Poets, &quot;many writers—Native Americans, Latinos/as, gays and lesbians, and younger generations of African Americans have acknowledged their debt to the Black Arts Movement.&quot; The movement lasted for about a decade, through the mid-1960s and into the 1970s. This was a period of controversy and change in the world of literature. One major change came through in the portrayal of new ethnic voices in the United States. English-language literature, prior to the Black Arts Movement, was dominated by white authors.

African Americans became a greater presence not only in the field of literature but in all areas of the arts. Theater groups, poetry performances, music and dance were central to the movement. Through different forms of media, African Americans were able to educate others about the expression of cultural differences and viewpoints. In particular, black poetry readings allowed African Americans to use vernacular dialogues. This was shown in the Harlem Writers Guild, which included black writers such as Maya Angelou and Rosa Guy. These performances were used to express political slogans and as a tool for organization. Theater performances also were used to convey community issues and organizations. The theaters, as well as cultural centers, were based throughout America and were used for community meetings, study groups and film screenings. Newspapers were a major tool in spreading the Black Arts Movement. In 1964, &quot;Black Dialogue&quot; was published, making it the first major Arts movement publication.

The Black Arts Movement, although short, is essential to the history of the United States. It spurred political activism and use of speech throughout every African-American community. It allowed African Americans the chance to express their voices in the mass media as well as become involved in communities.

It can be argued that &quot;the Black Arts movement produced some of the most exciting poetry, drama, dance, music, visual art, and fiction of the post-World War II United States&quot; and that many important &quot;post-Black artists&quot; such as Toni Morrison, Ntozake Shange, Alice Walker, and August Wilson were shaped by the movement.

The Black Arts Movement also provided incentives for public funding of the arts and increased public support of various arts initiatives.

===Legacy===
The movement has been seen as one of the most important times in African-American literature. It inspired black people to establish their own publishing houses, magazines, journals and art institutions. It led to the creation of African-American Studies programs within universities. Some claim that the movement was triggered by the assassination of Malcolm X, but its roots predate that event. Among the well-known writers who were involved with the movement are Nikki Giovanni, Sonia Sanchez, Maya Angelou, Hoyt W. Fuller, and Rosa Guy. Although not strictly part of the Movement, other notable African American writers such as Toni Morrison, Jay Wright, and Ishmael Reed share some of its artistic and thematic concerns. Although Reed is neither a movement apologist nor advocate, he said:

I think what Black Arts did was inspire a whole lot of Black people to write. Moreover, there would be no multiculturalism movement without Black Arts. Latinos, Asian Americans, and others all say they began writing as a result of the example of the 1960s. Blacks gave the example that you don&#x27;t have to assimilate. You could do your own thing, get into your own background, your own history, your own tradition and your own culture. I think the challenge is for cultural sovereignty and Black Arts struck a blow for that.

BAM influenced the world of literature with the portrayal of different ethnic voices. Before the movement, the literary canon lacked diversity, and the ability to express ideas from the point of view of racial and ethnic minorities, which was not valued by the mainstream at the time. BAM also spurred experimentalism in Black letters.

=== Influence ===
Theater groups, poetry performances, music and dance were centered on this movement, and therefore African Americans gained social and historical recognition in the area of literature and arts. Due to the agency and credibility given, African Americans were also able to educate others through different types of expressions and media outlets about cultural differences. The most common form of teaching was through poetry reading. African-American performances were used for their own political advertisement, organization, and community issues. The Black Arts Movement was spread by the use of newspaper advertisements. The first major arts movement publication was in 1964.&quot;No one was more competent in [the] combination of the experimental and the vernacular than Amiri Baraka, whose volume &quot;Black Magic Poetry 1961–1967&quot; (1969) is one of the finest products of the African-American creative energies of the 1960s.&quot;

<text>Jørgen Christian Jensen (15 January 1891 – 31 May 1922) was a Danish-born Australian recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces. Jensen emigrated to Australia in 1909, becoming a British subject at Adelaide, South Australia, in 1914. A sailor and labourer before World War I, he enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) in March 1915, serving with the 10th Battalion during the latter stages of the Gallipoli campaign. After the Australian force withdrew to Egypt, Jensen was transferred to the newly formed 50th Battalion, and sailed for France with the unit in June 1916. On the Western Front, he was wounded during the battalion&#x27;s first serious action, the Battle of Mouquet Farm in August, and only returned to his unit in late January 1917. On 2 April, his battalion attacked the Hindenburg Outpost Line at Noreuil, where his actions leading to the capture of over fifty German soldiers resulted in the award of the Victoria Cross.

In June 1917, the 50th Battalion was involved in the Battle of Messines; the following month, Jensen, now a corporal, was posted to a training unit in the United Kingdom. He returned to his battalion in October, and was promoted to temporary sergeant in November. In March 1918, the German spring offensive was launched, and Jensen fought with his battalion at Dernancourt and Villers-Bretonneux. Shortly after the fighting at Villers-Bretonneux, Jensen was on patrol when he received a severe head wound, and was evacuated to the United Kingdom, then repatriated to Australia, where he was discharged in Adelaide at the end of the war. He worked as a marine store dealer and married in 1921, but died the following year, having never fully recovered from his war wounds.

==Early life==
Jørgen Christian Jensen was born on 15 January 1891 in Løgstør, Denmark, the son of Jørgen Christian Jensen and Christiane Sørensen, who was apparently also known as Jensen. Sørensen was a single mother who worked in agriculture. The younger Jensen&#x27;s early life was difficult, but he was a good student, and entered the fishing industry. In 1908, aged 17, he travelled to the United Kingdom before emigrating to Australia. He sailed to Melbourne in March 1909, then moved to Morgan, South Australia, and later Port Pirie, working respectively as a sailor on river steamers on the Murray River, and as a labourer. He was naturalised as a British subject in Adelaide on 7 September 1914.

==World War I==
On 23 March 1915, Jensen enlisted as a private in the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) for service in World War I; he was allotted to the 6th reinforcements to the 10th Battalion. His reinforcement draft embarked on HMAT &quot;Borda&quot; at Outer Harbor on 23 June, and joined the battalion at Gallipoli, Turkey, on 4 August. By the time Jensen arrived, nearly half of the battalion had been evacuated sick with dysentery. For the remainder of the Gallipoli campaign, the 10th Battalion rotated through various positions in the line defending the beachhead until withdrawn to Lemnos in November. Jensen remained with his unit throughout, except for a week in September–October that he spent in hospital. The battalion embarked for Egypt in late November and spent the next four months training and assisting in the defence of the Suez Canal. While in Egypt, the battalion was split into two, one half forming the nucleus of the new 50th Battalion, which was part of the 13th Brigade, 4th Division. In April 1916, Jensen and several other 10th Battalion men were transferred to the 50th Battalion; later that month Jensen was charged for not being in his tent at tattoo. On 5 June the battalion embarked for France, arriving in Marseilles six days later. The unit then entrained for the Western Front, entering the trenches for the first time on 28 June near Fleurbaix.

The 50th Battalion saw its first serious action during the Battle of Mouquet Farm in mid-August 1916. During the battle, the 50th Battalion suffered 414 casualties, largely from the heavy German artillery bombardment. On 14 August, Jensen was hit in the left shoulder by a piece of shrapnel. He was evacuated to the UK and admitted to Graylingwell War Hospital in Chichester, West Sussex. While in the UK, he was charged with more disciplinary infractions in September, December and January, on one occasion being sentenced to 28 days field punishment for missing the troop train to return to France, and on another serving 12 days detention for being absent without leave. He did not rejoin his unit until 28 January 1917.

The 50th Battalion continued to rotate through front line, support and reserve positions, and underwent training in rear areas. The battalion was also involved in pursuing the Germans as they withdrew to the Hindenburg Line of fortifications. On 2 April, the 13th Brigade attacked the Hindenburg Outpost Line at Noreuil. The attack consisted of the 51st Battalion attacking the village from the north, and the 50th Battalion from the south. During this assault, which was preceded by a weak artillery barrage, the 50th Battalion suffered extraordinary difficulties, and the centre company, to which Jensen belonged, was forced to detach a party of men equipped with a large number of hand grenades (then known as bombs) to deal with a strongly barricaded German post that was holding out between their company and the one on their right. Jensen was a member of this party. His actions during the reduction of this post resulted in a recommendation for the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in battle that could be awarded to a member of the Australian armed forces at that time. He was assisted in his actions by Private William Quinlan O&#x27;Connor and four others. The recommendation read: 

During the assault on Noreuil, Jensen also freed Australian prisoners, and assisted in the &quot;mopping-up&quot; of German resistance in the village itself when he captured a German officer or non-commissioned officer, who pointed out which building the fire was coming from. The 50th Battalion suffered 360 casualties, including 95 dead, and captured 70 Germans, nearly all of whom were taken by Jensen and his party. O&#x27;Connor was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal for his part in capturing the German post. On 4 April, Jensen was promoted to lance corporal. His award of the Victoria Cross appeared in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 8 June, by which time the 50th Battalion was involved in the Battle of Messines, suffering 149 casualties. After being relieved, the battalion continued its rotation through front line, support and reserve positions.

In July 1917, Jensen was temporarily promoted to corporal and transferred to the 13th Training Battalion at Codford in the UK as an instructor. While there, he was entertained by Danish residents of Kingston upon Hull. He was invested with his VC by King George V at Buckingham Palace on 21 July. After another disciplinary infringement, he returned to France, rejoining his battalion on 6 October. He was temporarily promoted to sergeant in early November, and the battalion spent the winter of 1917–18 rotating through the front line. In late March 1918, the battalion left its rest area and, along with many other Australian units, was quickly deployed to meet the German spring offensive south of the River Ancre. On 5 April, the battalion took up positions at Dernancourt and there contributed to the defeat of the &quot;largest German attack mounted against Australian troops during the war&quot; during the Second Battle of Dernancourt.

The fighting at Dernancourt was followed by a move to the Villers-Bretonneux sector, where, on 25 April, the battalion took part in the Second Battle of Villers-Bretonneux that drove the Germans from that village, at a cost to the battalion of 254 casualties. On 5 May, Jensen was on patrol near Villers-Bretonneux when he was shot in the head. Severely wounded, he was admitted to hospital in France, and on 18 May was evacuated to the UK, where he was admitted to the Richmond Military Hospital in Surrey.

Jensen reverted to the rank of corporal on being evacuated. Following two weeks&#x27; leave, he was repatriated to Australia, along with nine other Victoria Cross recipients, in August 1918 to take part in a recruiting campaign on the invitation of Prime Minister Billy Hughes. He disembarked in Adelaide on 11 October, and was discharged from the AIF on 2 December. He was assessed to be partially disabled, and received a small pension. For his service during the war, as well as his Victoria Cross he was issued the 1914–15 Star, British War Medal and Victory Medal.

==Post-war==

After his discharge, Jensen worked for a short time as a barman in Truro, then as a marine store dealer in Adelaide. He married Katy Herman ( Arthur), a divorcée, at the Adelaide Registry Office on 13 July 1921. Their marriage was heavily affected by his wartime experiences. In April 1922, a photograph of Jensen and his horse-drawn cart, with &quot;J. C. Jensen V.C.&quot; painted on the side, was published on the front page of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper in Sydney; the caption noted that he employed several men in his business. On 28 May, Jensen was admitted to the Adelaide Hospital, and died of congestion of the lungs three days later, aged 31. He had never fully recovered from the wounds he had received during the war.

On 2 June, Jensen&#x27;s casket was carried on a horse-drawn gun carriage to the West Terrace Cemetery, followed by hundreds of former members of the 50th Battalion, and he was buried with full military honours in the AIF section of the cemetery. It was reported as &quot;one of the most impressive funerals which have passed through the gates of the West Terrace Cemetery&quot;, and &quot;probably one of the largest military funerals ever held in Adelaide&quot;. The pastor at the service said that Jensen was, &quot;modest always... ever ready to enlarge on the bravery of others, without touching on his own accomplishments&quot;.

Jensen&#x27;s medal set, including his Victoria Cross, was donated by a family member to the Australian War Memorial in 1987 at a ceremony attended by Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, and is displayed in the Hall of Valour of the memorial. In 2006, a memorial to Jensen was unveiled in Løgstør by the Australian ambassador to Denmark, and a book about him was published in Denmark in the same year. Each year, wreaths are placed at the memorial in memory of Jensen, and in 2014 a wreath was placed by the Australian ambassador, Damien Miller.

<text>Dame Elizabeth Violet Maconchy LeFanu (; 19 March 1907 – 11 November 1994) was an Irish-English composer. She is considered to be one of the finest composers Great Britain and Ireland have produced.

==Biography==
Elizabeth Violet Maconchy was born in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, of Irish parents, and grew up in England and Ireland. Her family moved to Ireland in 1917, where they lived in Howth, on the east coast. The adolescent Maconchy began her musical studies in Dublin, studying piano with Edith Boxhill, and harmony and counterpoint with John Francis Larchet. Those formative years in Ireland were important for Maconchy who considered herself Irish. Throughout her career she was identified as an Irish composer, or as an English composer with Irish influences, by reviewers and commentators.

In 1923, at the age of sixteen, she moved to London to enrol at the Royal College of Music. At the RCM Maconchy studied under Charles Wood and Ralph Vaughan Williams. Her contemporaries at the college included Grace Williams, Dorothy Gow, and Ina Boyle. Early compositions such as the violin sonata and Piano Concertino of 1927 already show the influence of European composers, especially Béla Bartók. As a student, Maconchy was awarded the Blumenthal Scholarship in 1927, and the Octavia Scholarship of 1930, which allowed her to continue her studies in Prague. Her first public recognition came in 19 March 1930 with a performance of her Piano Concerto, conducted by her teacher there, Karel Jirak. This was followed on 30 August by a BBC Proms performance of her cantata &quot;The Land&quot;, conducted by Henry Wood, which was inspired by the long poem of the same name by Vita Sackville-West.

In response to the scarce opportunities for young avant garde composers and for female composers, a group of women got together to organise regular concerts at the small Ballet Club theatre in Notting Hill, London, showcasing new work. It has been claimed that this venture &quot;changed the face of music in London&quot;, and that it &quot;prove[d] a lifeline for Elizabeth Maconchy through the 1930s&quot;.

In 1930 Maconchy married William LeFanu, with whom she had two daughters: Elizabeth Anna LeFanu (born 1939) and Nicola LeFanu (born 1947).
In 1932, Maconchy developed tuberculosis and she moved with her family from London to Kent.
She returned to Ireland in 1939, living in Dublin for a brief period, during which she composed her Fifth String Quartet, which some critics consider her greatest achievement, and gave birth to a daughter.

Maconchy did much to improve the conditions of composers, being elected Chair of the Composers Guild of Great Britain in 1959, a position she held for a number of years. She was also President of the Society for the Promotion of New Music. Maconchy was a socialist, and her activism extended to supporting the Democratic/Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, and other causes.

Maconchy&#x27;s friends included the English composer Elisabeth Lutyens, the Welsh composer Grace Williams, the Irish composer Ina Boyle, and the Czech music critic .

She died in Norwich, England.

==Compositions==
Maconchy is considered to be &quot;one of the finest composers the British Isles have produced&quot;. Her work has been compared to that of Bartók, who was an acknowledged influence, and also to Beethoven and Mozart, as well as (favourably) to contemporaries such as Benjamin Britten. She produced over 200 works. According to Ailie Blunnie, Maconchy was &quot;a gestural composer, concerning herself with short musical fragments, as opposed to large-scale concepts or templates&quot;, at least in part because of her &quot;ideology&quot; as a composer, so that &quot;she never planned anything out, musically speaking, in any great detail in advance of composition, [and by using shorter formats] she could afford to explore the possibilities implicit in the ideas themselves as they arose&quot;. 

In terms of style, Maconchy had &quot;a predilection for intervallic composition&quot;, and, &quot;profoundly influenced by the resonances produced by certain intervals, [she] tended to build works around one or a small number of intervals, which varied according to the work in question&quot;. A favoured &quot;harmonic device&quot; was the &quot;simultaneous use of major and minor sonorities&quot;, which &quot;came to denote episodes of heightened emotion&quot;. It has been argued that her work is often &quot;driven by rhythm&quot;, which gives it its characteristic confluence of &quot;energy, dynamism and imagination&quot;.

Maconchy&#x27;s cycle of thirteen string quartets, composed between 1932 and 1983, is regarded as the peak of her musical achievements. Historian of music Anna Beer has contended that &quot;Maconchy loved the quartet form because it represented a debate, a dialectic between four balanced, individual, impassioned voices.&quot; She once declared that: &quot;for me, the best music is an impassioned argument&quot;. 

She also wrote for voice. Maconchy wrote three one-act operas, including the erotic comic opera &quot;The Sofa&quot;, based on an eighteenth century novel, and stylistically in &quot;dialogue with Mozart&quot;, which shocked the audience for its explicitness when it premiered in 1959. In 1943 she responded to war with &quot;The Voice of the City&quot;, for women&#x27;s chorus, about the Battle of Stalingrad. There were many songs written throughout her career, but most of them were unpublished and remained little known. In 1981 she set to music prose versions of some Petrarchan sonnets, by the Irish writer J.M. Synge, grouped together as a song cycle, &quot;My Dark Heart&quot;.

In 1948, she was awarded the Edwin Evans Prize for her String Quartet No. 5. In 1953, her &quot;Proud Thames&quot; overture won the London County Council Competition as Coronation Overture for the new Queen of the United Kingdom.

In 1959, Maconchy was invited to chair the Composers&#x27; Guild of Great Britain, the first woman to do so. In 1960, she was awarded the Cobbett Medal for chamber music. In 1976, following the death of Benjamin Britten, she became President of the Society for the Promotion of New Music. She was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1977, and elevated to Dame Commander (DBE) in 1987.

<doc id="858795" wikidata="Q747201" url="?curid=858795" title="Ugg boots">
<text>Ugg boots are a unisex style of sheepskin boot or slipper originating in Australia. The boots are typically made of twin-faced sheepskin with fleece on the inside, a tanned outer surface and a synthetic sole. The term &quot;ugg boots&quot; originated in Australia, initially for utilitarian footwear worn for warmth, and which were often worn by surfers during the 1960s. In the 1970s, the boots were introduced to the surf culture of the United Kingdom and the United States. Sheepskin boots became a fashion trend in the U.S. in the late 1990s and a worldwide trend in the mid-2000s. In Australia, they are worn predominantly as slippers and often associated with daggy fashion sense and bogan culture.

Prior legal disputes between some manufacturers of sheepskin boots arose as to distinguish whether &quot;ugg&quot; is a protected trademark, or a generic term and thus ineligible for trademark protection. There are more than 70 registered trademarks that include the term &quot;ugg&quot; in various logos and designs in Australia and New Zealand, as the term is considered a generic reference to a type of shoe. Outside Australia and New Zealand, UGG is a brand manufactured by the California-based Deckers Outdoor Corporation, with most of its manufacturing based in China and with registered trademarks in over 130 countries worldwide including the US, UK, Canada, all European Union members, and China. Despite the difference in capitalisation and pronunciation (e.g., in China), Deckers Corporation actively asserts its &quot;UGG&quot; trade mark against Australian traders who sell their &quot;ugg boots&quot; overseas.

Noteworthy manufacturers in Australia and New Zealand are EMU Australia, Uggs-N-Rugs and Ugg Australia. While Deckers is often referred to as the leading manufacturer of the footwear style outside Australia, Deckers refers to its boots as the &quot;UGG-brand&quot; boot, and associates it with a &quot;California lifestyle&quot;. Following an investigation by the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission into allegedly misleading and deceptive use of &quot;Australia&quot; in its branding, Deckers has rebranded from &quot;UGG Australia&quot; to &quot;UGG&quot;.

== History ==
There are different claims to the origins of the ugg boot style. Artisanal sheepskin boots were known in rural Australia during the 1920s, and were reportedly worn by shearers as they found them resistant to wool yolk (lanolin), which would rot their ordinary boots. However, when commercial manufacturing began remains unclear. The boots were reportedly being manufactured in 1933 by Blue Mountains Ugg Boots of New South Wales. Frank Mortel of Mortels Sheepskin Factory has stated that he began manufacturing the boots in the late 1950s. Surfer Shane Stedman of Australia has stated in interviews that he invented the ugg boot. Perth sheepskin boot manufacturers Bruce and Bronwyn McDougall of Uggs-N-Rugs have manufactured the boots since the late 1970s.

The origin of the term &quot;ugg&quot; is also unclear. Stedman registered the trademark &quot;UGH-BOOTS&quot; in Australia in 1971, and in 1982 registered the &quot;UGH&quot; trademark. Frank Mortel claims that he named his company&#x27;s sheepskin boots &quot;ugg boots&quot; in 1958 after his wife commented that the first pair he made were &quot;ugly.&quot; Some accounts have suggested that the term grew out of earlier variations, such as the &quot;fug boots&quot; worn by Royal Air Force pilots during World War I.

The 1970s saw the emergence of advertising using the UGG and UGH terms both in trade names and as a generic term in Australia. The &quot;Macquarie Dictionary&quot; of the Australian language first included a definition for &quot;ugg boot&quot; as a generic term for sheepskin boots in its 1981 edition. (After Stedman complained to the editors of Macquarie, subsequent editions indicated that &quot;UGH&quot; was a trade mark.)

In the 1970s, ugg boots became popular among competitive surfers. Sheepskin footwear accounts for around 10 percent of footwear production in Australia.

=== International sales ===
Surfing helped popularise the boots outside Australia and New Zealand. Advertisements for Australian sheepskin boots first appeared in Californian surf magazines in 1970. By the mid-1970s, several surf shops in Santa Cruz, California and the San Fernando Valley were selling a limited number of boots purchased by the shops&#x27; owners while visiting surfing events in Australia. In 1978, a Western Australian manufacturer of sheepskin boots, Country Leather, advertised outside Australia for distributors to sell its sheepskin boots, which were made from sheepskin sourced from Jackson&#x27;s Tannery in Geelong, Victoria. Seeing the popularity of the boots among American surfers, Australian surfer Brian Smith, then living in Santa Monica, California, and colleague Doug Jensen bought boots from Country Leather but were unhappy with the brand and decided to register UGG as their own trademark. Family friends invested $20,000 into the new venture and the group set up Ugg Imports. Due to other business commitments, in 1979 Jensen handed over his share of the company to Smith. In 1987 Smith registered Ugg Holdings Inc. and in 1985 registered a U.S. trademark on a ram&#x27;s head logo with the words &quot;Original UGG Boot UGG Australia.&quot; In 1995, Ugg Holdings purchased Stedman&#x27;s various trademarks. As for the ugg name, Smith stated: &quot;We always called them uggs, long before it was trademarked.&quot;

Shoe manufacturer Hide &amp; Feet in Newquay, England began manufacturing sheepskin boots in 1973, and in 1990 Nick Whitworth and his wife Kath bought the business and registered &quot;UGG&quot; as a trade mark in the UK. Due to increasing popularity and sales, in 1991 the company changed its name to &quot;The Original Ugg Co.&quot; In 1999, Whitworth sold the company name and the British UGG trade mark to Deckers Outdoor Corporation, renaming his company the Celtic Sheepskin Company.

By 1994, UGG boots had grown in status among surfers in California with 80% of sales in southern Orange County where Ugg Holdings saw an increase in sales of 60 percent on the previous season. Smith&#x27;s UGG boots gained international exposure when they were worn by the United States Olympic team in Lillehammer for the 1994 Winter Olympics. Australian manufacturers also saw an increase in exports of sheepskin boots to the United States, although Ugg Holdings retained an estimated 80% market share. By the end of the year, Country Leather had opened its own shop in Redondo Beach to promote an expansion of the brand from its established surf market into mainstream footwear sales and Ugg Holdings began sourcing UGG boots directly from Jackson&#x27;s Tannery, which had changed its name to EMU Australia. In early 1995, Smith promoted the UGG AUSTRALIA brand on the Rush Limbaugh show, which spurred sales while the brand gained further exposure when the San Diego Chargers started wearing them. According to retailers, it was not just the footwear that attracted consumers, but the &quot;made in Australia&quot; tie-in as the boots were a unique product only available from Australia and Australian products were at that time very popular. In August 1995, Smith sold Ugg Holdings to Deckers Outdoor Corporation for $14.6 million. In 1996 Deckers registered the various trademarks for &quot;UGG&quot; in the U.S.

Australian ugg boots are not considered fashionable in their countries of origin and are worn for warmth and comfort. Ugg boots in Australia are worn predominantly as slippers and associated with daggy fashion sense, bogan behaviour and the outer suburbs when worn in public. According to Australian fashion stylist Justin Craig: &quot;The only people who get away with wearing them are models, who give out the message: &#x27;I&#x27;m so beautiful, I can look good in any crap. The Deckers UGG brand emerged as a fashion trend in the US through Deckers&#x27; actions to promote it as a high fashion brand. Deckers solicited endorsements from celebrities such as Kate Hudson, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cameron Diaz, Leonardo DiCaprio and Jennifer Lopez, and product placements in television series such as &quot;Sex and the City,&quot; and films such as &quot;Raising Helen&quot;. This marketing campaign &quot;led to an exponential growth in the brand&#x27;s popularity and recognizability.&quot; The company reported US$689 million in UGG sales in 2008, almost a 50-fold increase from 1995. Deckers aggressively pursues sales of ugg boots by Australian traders overseas. In 2010, worldwide sales of ugg boots by Australian manufacturers combined equalled only 5.9% of Deckers &quot;UGG&quot;-branded sheepskin boots sales, with UGG dominating the world market.

== Design ==

Traditional Australian ugg boots are made from sheepskins with fleece attached. The fleece is tanned into the leather and the boot is assembled with the fleece on the inside. Some ugg boots have a synthetic sole, commonly made from Ethylene-vinyl acetate (EVA). The stitching is often prominent on the outside of the boot. The natural insulative properties of sheepskin gives isothermal properties to the boots: the thick fleecy fibres on the inner part of the boots wick moisture and allow air to circulate, keeping the feet at body temperature and allowing the boots to keep feet warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather. Produced by a number of manufacturers, they come in a variety of colours, including black, pink, blue, chestnut, and fuchsia. They are available in both pull-on and lace-up varieties and their height can range from just above the ankle to above the knee.

Some variations of ugg style boots have also been made from kangaroo fur and leather. There are also synthetic boots. Although derided as &quot;fake&quot; by some in the industry, their lower price made them appealing to large retail chains such as Myer.

=== Animal rights ===
Sheep-skin is a by-product of processing sheep for human consumption. That is, sheep are not specifically killed for their skins. Because it is a by-product, the supply of sheep-skin is limited by the number of sheep processed for the meat industry. The rise in the popularity of &quot;UGG&quot;-branded ugg boots has been the &quot;driving force&quot; in recent shortages, which have seen sheep-skin prices from 2010 to 2012 increase by up to 80%.

As one of many clothing products made from animal skin, sheepskin boots have been the subject of criticism by the animal rights movement, and producers have responded by improving animal welfare. Animal rights groups call for the boycott of sheepskin boots and their replacement with synthetic alternatives. In 2007, Pamela Anderson, realizing that the boots were made of skin, called for a boycott on her website. In February 2008, the Princeton Animal Welfare Society staged a campus protest against the fur industry, particularly attacking the sheepskin boot industry.

In 2024, UGG announced their first vegan boots in a collaboration with designer Collina Strada. The footwear materials are made using sugarcane, Tencel and recycled polyester microfibre.

== Trademark disputes ==

The trademarking of the UGG name has been the subject of dispute in several countries. Deckers Outdoor Corporation has won disputes in the United States, the Netherlands, and Turkey. In Australia and New Zealand, ugg is a generic term. The trademark for &quot;Ugh-Boots&quot; has been removed from the trademark registry for non-use. Outside Australia and New Zealand, UGG (&quot;written in capital letters&quot;) is a registered trademark of Deckers Outdoor Corporation.

The first trademark application for UGG in the United States was filed by Brian Smith&#x27;s company in 1984. In the 1990s, Smith and then Deckers secured additional registrations in the U.S. and other countries. In 1999, Deckers began asserting its new trademark and sent out cease and desist letters to Australian manufacturers that were selling sheepskin boots outside of Australia via the internet. By the early 2000s, demand for UGG boots was soaring with Australian and U.S.-based manufacturers selling sheepskin boots over the Internet. There was confusion among consumers between generic ugg boots made in Australia and Deckers&#x27; UGG brand boots. Deckers&#x27; law firm Middletons of Melbourne began a serious effort to halt the Australian companies&#x27; sales by sending cease and desist letters to a number of Australian and U.S.-based manufacturers, preventing them from selling sheepskin boots using the UGG trademark on eBay or from using the word in their registered business names or domain names. Deckers initiated numerous domain name actions under the UDRP.

In response to these actions by Deckers, some Australian manufacturers formed the Australian Sheepskin Association to fight the corporation&#x27;s claim, arguing that &quot;ugg&quot; is a generic term referring to flat-heeled, pull-on sheepskin boots. One of these manufacturers, Perth&#x27;s Uggs-N-Rugs, who had been manufacturing ugg boots since 1978 and selling them online since 1996, appealed to Australian trademark regulators. The officer who heard the case stated that the &quot;evidence overwhelmingly supports the proposition that the terms (ugg, ugh and ug boots) are interchangeably used to describe a specific style of sheepskin boot and are the first and most natural way in which to describe these goods.&quot; In 2006 Uggs-N-Rugs won the right to use the term UGG BOOT/S and variations such as UGH BOOT/S within Australia. Deckers retained the trademark rights to their UGG logo in Australia as trademark protection only applies to the way the mark appears in its entirety and not the words it contains. IP Australia also ruled that the trademark &quot;UGH-boots&quot; (with hyphen) should be removed from the trademark register for non-use as Deckers had only been using the UGG logo, not the UGH marks. This 2006 ruling applies only in Australia and Deckers still owns the trademarks in other jurisdictions such as the US, China, Japan and the European Union.

<doc id="858805" wikidata="Q476050" url="?curid=858805" title="Mueang Nonthaburi district">
<text>Mueang Nonthaburi (, , ) is the capital district (&quot;amphoe mueang&quot;) of Nonthaburi province in Thailand. The city of Nonthaburi has 267,001 inhabitants, while the whole district has 348,553.

==History==
The district was originally named &quot;Talat Khwan&quot;. Simon de la Loubère, who was a French envoy extraordinary to the King of Ayutthaya, wrote in his book that Talat Khwan (Talacoan) was an important place on the Chao Phraya River. It is unknown what year it was established. In 1917, the provincial administration of Nonthaburi was moved into the district, and thus the district was renamed Mueang Nonthaburi. From 1 January 1943 to 9 May 1946 Nonthaburi was abolished and split between Thonburi and Phra Nakhon Provinces. Thus the district, which was then in Phra Nakhon Province, was renamed &quot;Nonthaburi&quot;. After the recreation of the province, it changed back to &quot;Mueang Nonthaburi&quot;.

==Administration==
The district is divided into 10 sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 32 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;). The city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) of Nonthaburi covers &quot;tambons&quot; Suan Yai, Talat Khwan, Bang Khen, Bang Kraso, and Tha Sai. There are three town municipalities (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;): Bang Si Mueang, which covers &quot;tambon&quot; Bang Si Mueang and parts of &quot;tambon&quot; Bang Krang; Sai Ma, which covers the &quot;tambon&quot; of the same name; and Bang Krang, which covers most parts of the &quot;tambon&quot; of the same name.
==Economy==
The Thai Department of Corrections has its headquarters in Suan Yai in this district.

==Environment==
Mueang Nonthaburi as well as neighbouring Bang Kruai and Bang Yai is the last natural habitat of the Alexandrine parakeet and red-breasted parakeet, a medium-sized parrot in Bangkok Metropolitan Region. They live in groups on large trees in some local temples, such as Wat Suan Yai, Wat Utthayan, Wat Ampawan, Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat Worawihan.

<doc id="858810" wikidata="Q68490" url="?curid=858810" title="Hermann of Reichenau">
<text>Blessed Hermann of Reichenau or Herman the Cripple (18 July 1013– 24 September 1054), also known by other names, was an 11th-century Benedictine monk and scholar. He composed works on history, music theory, mathematics, and astronomy, as well as many hymns. He has traditionally been credited with the composition of &quot;Salve Regina&quot;, &quot;Veni Sancte Spiritus&quot;, and &quot;Alma Redemptoris Mater&quot;, although these attributions are sometimes questioned. His cultus and beatification were confirmed by the Roman Catholic Church in 1863.

==Names==
Hermann&#x27;s name is sometimes anglicized as Herman or Latinized as Hermannus; it sometimes also appears in the older form Heriman. He is sometimes distinguished as Hermann of Vöhringen (; ) from his birthplace. He is better known as Hermann of Reichenau (; ) from the location of his monastery on Reichenau Island () in Lake Constance. He was traditionally distinguished in Latin as &quot;&quot; (), which appears in English as &quot;Hermann the Lame&quot; () or &quot;Hermann the Cripple&quot; ().

==Life==
Hermann was a son of the Count of Altshausen. He was disabled due to a paralytic disease from early childhood. He was born on 18 July 1013 with a cleft palate and cerebral palsy and is said to have had spina bifida. Based on the evidence, however, more recent scholarship indicates Hermann possibly had either amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or spinal muscular atrophy. As a result, he had great difficulty moving and could hardly speak. At seven, he was placed in a Benedictine monastery by his parents who could no longer look after him.

He grew up in the Abbey of Reichenau, an island on Lake Constance in Germany. He learned from the monks and developed a keen interest in both theology and the world around him. At twenty, Hermann entered their order as a Benedictine monk, becoming literate in several languages (including Arabic, Greek and Latin) and contributing to all four arts of the quadrivium.

He wrote about history, mathematics, astronomy, and Christianity. He wrote a treatise on the science of music, several works on geometry and arithmetics, and astronomical treatises including instructions for the construction of an astrolabe which caused him to sometimes be credited as its inventor. As an historian, he wrote a detailed chronicle from the birth of Christ to his own present day, ordering them after the reckoning of the Christian era. It was later extended by his pupil Berthold of Reichenau.

He was a renowned religious poet and musical composer. Among his surviving works are officia for St. Afra and St. Wolfgang. When he went blind in later life, he began writing hymns. He was famous enough that he appears to have been credited with compositions by later writers; among the works traditionally attributed to him are the &quot;Salve Regina&quot; (&quot;Hail Queen&quot;), &quot;Veni Sancte Spiritus&quot; (&quot;Come Holy Spirit&quot;), and &quot;Alma Redemptoris Mater&quot; (&quot;Nourishing Mother of the Redeemer&quot;).

Herman died on Reichenau on 24 September 1054, aged 41. The Roman Catholic Church beatified him in 1863.

==Legacy and influence==
Three of five symphonies that were written by Russian composer Galina Ustvolskaya are based on his texts.

<doc id="858811" wikidata="Q3503840" url="?curid=858811" title="Anders Lassen">
<text>Major Anders Frederik Emil Victor Schau Lassen, (22 September 1920 – 9 April 1945) was a Danish military officer who was the only non-Commonwealth recipient of the Victoria Cross during the Second World War. Serving in the British Army, he was posthumously awarded the award for his actions during Operation Roast on 8 April 1945 at Lake Comacchio in Italy in the final weeks of the Italian campaign.

Lassen was ordered to lead a raid that would give the impression that a major landing was being undertaken. Lassen fulfilled his mission by destroying three enemy positions before being mortally wounded. As his men&#x27;s lives would be endangered in the withdrawal, he refused to be evacuated from the area.

==Early life and background==
Anders Lassen was born on the Høvdingsgård estate near Mern, Vordingborg Municipality, the son of estate owners Emil Victor Schau Lassen and Suzanne Maria Signe Lassen. Lassen&#x27;s paternal grandfather A. F. J. C. Lassen, made his fortune as the owner of a tobacco plantation on Sumatra. In 1917, Lassen&#x27;s father took over the Høvdingsgård estate. Lassen was a first cousin of Axel von dem Bussche, a German Resistance member who unsuccessfully tried to kill Adolf Hitler in 1943.

==Military career==

While serving in Denmark&#x27;s merchant navy, Lassen came to the United Kingdom shortly after the start of the Second World War where he joined the British Commandos in 1940, serving with No. 62 Commando (also known as the Small Scale Raiding Force). The unit was formed around a small group of commandos under the command of the Special Operations Executive (SOE). He was commissioned in the field on the General List and awarded an immediate Military Cross for his part in Operation Postmaster, the capture of three Italian and German ships from the neutral Spanish colonial island of Fernando Po, now known as Bioko, in the Gulf of Guinea.

In early 1943, No. 62 Commando was disbanded, and its members were dispersed among other formations. Lassen was among a number who went to the Middle East to serve in the Special Boat Section, then attached to the Special Air Service. Others joined the 2nd SAS under the command of Bill Stirling (1911-1983), elder brother of David Stirling. During his time in the SBS, Lassen rose in rank to become a major by October 1944. During his service he fought in North-West Europe, North Africa, Crete, the Aegean islands, mainland Greece, Yugoslavia and Italy. He was awarded two further bars to his Military Cross on 27 September 1943 and 15 February 1944.

On 24 April 1944, he led a successful SBS raid on Santorini, taking out the garrison on the island and blowing up the building housing the radio installation with time bombs. Lassen and the force, with only two casualties, successfully withdrew on two schooners.

==Victoria Cross==
Lassen, who was 24 years old, was serving as a temporary major in the British Special Boat Section when he was awarded the Victoria Cross. The citation published in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; on 4 September 1945 gave the following details:

==Commemoration==
Lassen is buried at the Argenta Gap War Cemetery grave II, E, 11. His Victoria Cross medal is on display at the &quot;Frihedsmuseet&quot; (Museum of Danish Resistance) in Copenhagen, Denmark. A bust of him was installed in Churchillparken (Churchill Park) outside the museum in 1987. Near the site of the action where Lassen earned his Victoria Cross, the Italians have erected a monument to Lassen and his men. This monument is situated alongside the SP1b highway, southeast of the township, and just to the north of its intersection with the Via del Camposanto.

<text>An endowment mortgage is a mortgage loan arranged on an interest-only basis where the capital is intended to be repaid by one or more (usually Low-Cost) endowment policies. The phrase &quot;endowment mortgage&quot; is used mainly in the United Kingdom by lenders and consumers to refer to this arrangement and is not a legal term. 

The borrower has two separate agreements: one with the &quot;lender&quot; for the &quot;mortgage&quot;, and one with the &quot;insurer&quot; for the &quot;endowment policy&quot;. The arrangements are distinct and the borrower can change either arrangement if they wish. In the past the endowment policy was often taken as an additional security by the lender. That is, the lender applied a legal device to ensure the proceeds of the endowment were made payable to them rather than the borrower; typically the policy is assigned to the lender. This practice is uncommon now. 

== Reasons for an endowment mortgage == 
The customer pays only the interest on the capital borrowed, thus reducing the monthly payments in comparison with an ordinary repayment loan; the borrower also pays premiums into an endowment life-assurance policy. The intention is that the payout from the endowment policy when it matures will be sufficient to repay the mortgage at the end of the term, and possibly create a cash surplus. 

Up to 1984 qualifying insurance contracts (including endowment policies) received tax relief on the premiums known as life assurance premium relief (LAPR). This gave a tax advantage for endowment mortgages over repayment mortgages, until the tax relief was ended in the March 1984 budget. The previous year, the tax relief on the mortgage interest had also been reduced by the introduction of MIRAS (mortgage interest relief at source), which restricted to the basic rate of tax the previously unlimited interest tax relief. Before these changes, a larger endowment mortgage could be advantageous as, if the interest rate stayed constant, the tax relief on interest paid on a repayment mortgage was reduced over time, whereas interest on the full amount of the endowment mortgage and hence the tax relief it attracted remained constant to the end of the term. 

An additional reason in favour of an endowment was that many lenders charge interest on an annual basis. This meant that any capital repaid on a monthly basis is not removed from the outstanding loan until the end of the year thus increasing the real rate of interest charged. In such a situation, payments into an endowment might benefit from any growth from the moment it is invested. However, this was balanced against the higher interest rates that lenders generally charged for endowment mortgages compared with repayment mortgages.

== Traded endowment policies == 
Traded endowment policies (TEPs) or second hand endowment policies (SHEPs) are traditional with-profits endowments that have been sold to a new owner part way through their term. The TEP market enables buyers (investors) to buy unwanted endowment policies for more than the surrender value offered by the insurance company. Investors will pay more than the surrender value because the policy has greater value if it is kept in force than if it is terminated early. 
When a policy is sold, all beneficial rights on the policy are transferred to the new owner. The new owner takes on responsibility for future premium payments and collects the maturity value when the policy matures or the death benefit when the original life assured dies. Policyholders who sell their policies, no longer benefit from the life cover and should consider whether to take out alternative cover.
The TEP market deals exclusively with Traditional With Profits policies. The easiest way of determining whether an endowment policy is in this category is to check to see whether it mentions units, indicating it is a Unitised With Profits or Unit Linked policy, if bonuses are in sterling and there is no mention of units then it is probably a traditional With Profits. The other types of policies - “Unit Linked” and “Unitised With Profits” have a performance factor which is dependent directly on current investment market conditions. These are not tradable as the guarantees on the policy are much lower and there is no gap between the surrender value and the market value.

== Problems with endowment mortgages ==
The underlying premise with endowment policies being used to repay a mortgage, is that the premiums plus growth of the investment will be adequate to repay the loan when it falls due. Toward the end of the 1980s when endowment mortgage selling was at its peak, the anticipated growth rate for endowments policies was high (7-12% per annum). By the middle of the 1990s the change in the economy toward lower inflation made the assumptions of a few years ago look optimistic.

Significantly, endowment mortgages continued to grow in the 1980s even after life assurance premium relief had been abolished in 1984. Moreover, their share of the mortgage market held up in the 1990s despite the fact that the Treasury began to steadily reduce MIRAS (mortgage interest relief at source), which also worked in favour of interest-only mortgages, and despite a prolonged period of relatively low inflation (something which worked against interest only mortgages). The fact that endowment mortgages were later found to have been systematically mis-sold probably explains this disjunction.

Regulation of investment advice and a growing awareness of the potential for regulatory action against the insurers lead to a reduction in anticipated growth rates down to 7.5% and eventually as low as 4% per annum. By 2001 the sale of endowments to repay a mortgage was virtually seen as taboo. 

===Shortfalls===
Financial regulations introduced compulsory &quot;re-projection letters&quot; to show existing endowment holders what the likely maturity value of their endowment would be assuming standard growth rates. 

This, in turn, led to a dramatic rise in complaints of mis-selling and spawned a secondary industry that &#x27;handles&#x27; complaints on behalf of consumers for a fee, even though they can pursue it themselves for free. 

In many cases, because risk warnings were not made as clearly as they are in today&#x27;s investment market, courts have found against the insurer or broker responsible for the original advice and have required them to restore their customers to the financial position they would have been in had they taken out a repayment mortgage instead. As of July 2006, UK banks and insurance providers have paid out approximately £2.2 billion in compensation.
