<text>Bang Kruai (, ) is a district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) in the southern part of Nonthaburi province, central Thailand.

==History==
The district was created in 1904 and named Bang Yai. Due to its size it was difficult to administer, and thus in 1917 the northern part was split off as minor district (&quot;king amphoe&quot;), Bang Mae Nang. In 1921 Bang Mae Nang became a full district.

On 19 October 1930 the district was renamed &quot;Bang Kruai&quot;, after the geographic shape of district. &quot;Kruai&quot; is the Thai word for &#x27;cone&#x27;. On the same date, Bang Mae Nang received the old name of the district, &quot;Bang Yai&quot;.

==Geography==
Neighbouring districts are (from north clockwise) Bang Yai, Mueang Nonthaburi, the districts Bang Sue, Bang Phlat, Taling Chan, Thawi Watthana of Bangkok, and finally Phutthamonthon (Nakhon Pathom province).

==Administration==
The district is divided into nine sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 60 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;). Since 2002 Bang Kruai itself has had town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Plai Bang has had township (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;) status since 1999. Sala Klang has had township status since 2008. Bang Si Thong has had township status since 2013. There another three tambon administrative organizations (TAO).

==Environment==
Bang Kruai as well as neighbouring Bang Yai and Mueang Nonthaburi is the last natural habitat of the Alexandrine parakeet and red-breasted parakeet, a medium-sized parrot in Bangkok Metropolitan Region. They live in groups on large trees in some local temples, such as Wat Suan Yai, Wat Utthayan, Wat Ampawan, Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat Worawihan.

<text>Duck and Cover is a 1952 American civil defense animated and live action social guidance film that is often characterized as propaganda. It has similar themes to the more adult-oriented civil defense training films. It was widely distributed to United States schoolchildren in the 1950s, and teaches students what to do in the event of a nuclear explosion.

The film was funded by the US Federal Civil Defense Administration and released in January 1952. At the time, the Soviet Union was engaged in nuclear testing and the US was in the midst of the Korean War. It was written by Raymond J. Mauer, directed by Anthony Rizzo of Archer Productions, narrated by actor Robert Middleton, and made with help from schoolchildren from New York City and Astoria, New York.

The film is in the public domain and widely available through Internet sources such as YouTube, as well as on DVD. It was screened on Turner Classic Movies&#x27; Saturday night–Sunday morning film showcase series, TCM Underground.

In 2004, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant.&quot;

==Plot==
The film starts with an animated sequence, showing Bert, an anthropomorphic turtle walking down a road while picking up a flower and smelling it. A chorus sings the &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; theme:

Bert is shown being attacked by a monkey holding a lit firecracker or stick of dynamite on the end of a string. Bert ducks into his shell as the charge goes off; it destroys both the monkey and the tree in which he is sitting, but Bert is left unharmed.

The film then switches to live footage, as narrator Middleton explains what children should do &quot;when you see the flash&quot; of an atomic bomb. It is suggested that by ducking down low in the event of a nuclear explosion, such as crawling under desks, children would be safer than they would be standing. It also explains some basic survival tactics, such as facing a wall that might lend protection.

The last scene of the film returns to animation, in which Bert the Turtle (voiced by Carl Ritchie) summarily asks what everybody should do in the event of an atomic bomb flash, before being given the correct answer by a group of unseen children.

==Purpose==
After nuclear weapons were developed, with Trinity having been the first nuclear weapon to be developed through the Manhattan Project during World War II, the danger they posed soon became clear. The United States held a nuclear monopoly from the end of World War II until 1949, when the Soviets detonated their first nuclear device.

Soon after, the nuclear stage of the Cold War began; as a result, strategies for survival were thought out. Fallout shelters, both private and public, were built, but the government deemed it necessary to teach citizens about the danger of atomic and hydrogen bombs and give them training to prepare them to act in the event of a nuclear strike.

The solution was the duck and cover campaign, which &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; was an integral part of. Shelters were built, drills were held in towns and schools, and the film was shown to schoolchildren. According to the United States Library of Congress, which declared the film &quot;historically significant&quot; and inducted it for preservation into the National Film Registry in 2004, it &quot;was seen by millions of schoolchildren in the 1950s.&quot;

==Accuracy and usefulness==

Detailed scientific research programs lay behind the UK government civil defense pamphlets of the 1950s and 1960s, including the advice to duck and cover, which has made a resurgence in recent years with new scientific evidence to support it. While these kinds of tactics would be useless for those at ground zero during a surface burst nuclear explosion, it would be beneficial to most people, who are positioned away from the blast hypocenter.
Recent scientific analysis has largely supported the general idea of sheltering indoors in response to a nuclear explosion. Staying indoors can leave roads clear for emergency vehicles to access the area. This is known as the shelter in place protocol, and along with emergency evacuation, are recommended as the two countermeasures to take when the direct effects of nuclear explosions are no longer life-threatening and protection is needed from coming in contact with nuclear weapon fallout.

==Historical context==

The United States&#x27; monopoly on nuclear weapons was broken by the Soviet Union in 1949 when it tested its first nuclear explosive (Joe-1), causing many in the US government and public to realize that the nation was more vulnerable than before. Duck-and-cover exercises quickly became a part of Civil Defense drills that every American citizen, from children to the elderly, practiced to be ready in the event of nuclear war. In 1950, during the first big Civil Defense push of the Cold War and coinciding with the &quot;Alert America!&quot; initiative to educate Americans on nuclear preparedness, the adult-oriented &quot;Survival Under Atomic Attack&quot; was published, containing &quot;duck and cover&quot; advice in its &quot;Six Survival Secrets For Atomic Attacks&quot; section. &quot;1. Try To Get Shielded 2. Drop Flat On Ground Or Floor 3. Bury Your Face In Your Arms (&quot;crook of your elbow&quot;)&quot;. The child-oriented film &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; was produced a year later, in 1951, by the Federal Civil Defense Administration.
Education efforts on the effects of nuclear weapons proceeded with stops-and-starts in the US due to competing alternatives. In a once classified war game that examined varying levels of war escalation, warning, and pre-emptive attacks in the late 1950s to early 1960s, it was estimated that approximately 27 million US citizens would have been saved with civil defense education. However, at the time the cost of a full-scale civil defense program was regarded as less effective and less cost-efficient than a ballistic missile defense (Nike Zeus) system. As the Soviets were believed to be rapidly increasing their nuclear stockpile, the efficacy of both would begin to enter a diminishing returns trend. When more became known about the cost and limitations of the Nike Zeus system, in the early 1960s the head of the Department of Defense determined once more that fallout shelters would save more Americans for less money.

The production of &quot;Duck and Cover&quot; in 1951 by the Federal Civil Defense Administration occurred during the height of the Korean War (1950–1953) and coincided with the first Desert Rock exercises in the Nevada desert, which were designed to familiarize the US military with fighting alongside battlefield nuclear weapons. It was feared that a resolution to the Korean War might require the theater of operations to first expand across the border into the People&#x27;s Republic of China and nuclear weapons to end it.

==Legacy==
===Appearance in other media===

The video for Peter Gabriel&#x27;s 1980 song &quot;Games Without Frontiers&quot; features footage from the film at the end of the song.

The 1982 satirical collage documentary film &quot;The Atomic Cafe&quot; uses footage from &quot;Duck and Cover&quot;. Both films were eventually inducted into the National Film Registry.

The video for &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic&#x27;s 1986 song &quot;Christmas at Ground Zero&quot; features footage from the film, mostly during an instrumental break. Bert the Turtle is shown in time with the lyric &#x27;I&#x27;ll duck and cover/ with my Yuletide lover&#x27;.

The song &quot;Bert the Turtle (Duck and Cover)&quot;, performed by Dick Baker, was released as a commercial recording by Coral Records and accompanied by a color campaign pamphlet. It sold three million copies.

The 1999 film &quot;The Iron Giant,&quot; which is set in 1957, features a social guidance film titled &quot;Atomic Holocaust,&quot; the style and tone of which parodies the film.

RiffTrax also spoofed this film in 2015.

<text>Bang Yai (, ) is a district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) in the western part of Nonthaburi province, central Thailand.

==History==
The district was created in 1917 as a minor district (&quot;king amphoe&quot;) by splitting it from the districts Bang Kruai and Bang Bua Thong. In 1921 it was elevated to full district status. Originally named Bang Mae Nang, on 19 October 1930 it was renamed &quot;Bang Yai&quot;, the original name of Bang Kruai District.

==Geography==
Neighbouring districts are (from the north clockwise) Sai Noi, Bang Bua Thong, Mueang Nonthaburi, Bang Kruai, and Phutthamonthon of Nakhon Pathom province.

==Administration==
The district is divided into six sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 66 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;). Since 2020 Bang Mae Nang has had town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status, covering most parts of &quot;tambon&quot; Bang Mae Nang. There are five townships (&quot;thesaban tambons&quot;). Bang Muang covers parts of &quot;tambons&quot; Bang Muang, Bang Len, and Sao Thong Hin; Bang Yai covers parts of &quot;tambons&quot; Bang Mae Nang, Bang Yai, and Ban Mai; Sao Thong Hin covers most parts of &quot;tambon&quot; Sao Thong Hin; Bang Len covers most parts of &quot;tambon&quot; Bang Len; and Ban Bang Muang covers most parts of &quot;tambon&quot; Bang Muang. There are a further two tambon administrative organizations (TAO) responsible for the non-municipal areas of &quot;tambons&quot; Bang Yai and Ban Mai.
==Environment==
Bang Yai as well as neighbouring Bang Kruai and Mueang Nonthaburi is the last natural habitat of the Alexandrine parakeet and red-breasted parakeet, a medium-sized parrot in Bangkok Metropolitan Region. They live in groups on large trees in some local temples, such as Wat Suan Yai, Wat Utthayan, Wat Ampawan, Wat Chaloem Phra Kiat Worawihan.

<doc id="858831" wikidata="Q324628" url="?curid=858831" title="Acrylic acid">
<text>Acrylic acid (IUPAC: prop-2-enoic acid) is an organic compound with the formula CH2=CHCOOH. It is the simplest unsaturated carboxylic acid, consisting of a vinyl group connected directly to a carboxylic acid terminus. This colorless liquid has a characteristic acrid or tart smell. It is miscible with water, alcohols, ethers, and chloroform. More than a million tons are produced annually.

==History==
The word &quot;acrylic&quot; was coined in 1843, for a chemical derivative of acrolein, an acrid-smelling oil derived from glycerol. 

==Production==
Acrylic acid is produced by oxidation of propylene, which is a byproduct of the production of ethylene and gasoline:
: 2 CH2=CHCH3 + 3 O2 → 2 CH2=CHCO2H + 2 H2O

=== Historical methods ===
Because acrylic acid and its esters have long been valued commercially, many other methods have been developed. Most have been abandoned for economic or environmental reasons. An early method was the hydrocarboxylation of acetylene (&quot;Reppe chemistry&quot;):

This method requires nickel carbonyl, high pressures of carbon monoxide, and acetylene, which is relatively expensive compared to propylene.

Acrylic acid was once manufactured by the hydrolysis of acrylonitrile, a material derived from propene by ammoxidation, but this route was abandoned because it cogenerates ammonium side products, which must be disposed of. Other now abandoned precursors to acrylic acid include ethenone and ethylene cyanohydrin.

=== Research ===

Carboxylating ethylene to acrylic acid under supercritical carbon dioxide is thermodynamically possible, but efficient catalysts have not been developed. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3HP), an acrylic-acid precursor by dehydration, can be produced from sugars, but the process is not competitive.

==Reactions and uses==
Acrylic acid undergoes the typical reactions of a carboxylic acid. When reacted with an alcohol, it forms the corresponding ester. The esters and salts of acrylic acid are collectively known as acrylates (or propenoates). The most common alkyl esters of acrylic acid are methyl, butyl, ethyl, and 2-ethylhexyl acrylate.

Acrylic acid and its esters readily combine with themselves (to form polyacrylic acid) or other monomers (e.g. acrylamides, acrylonitrile, vinyl compounds, styrene, and butadiene) by reacting at their double bond, forming homopolymers or copolymers, which are used in the manufacture of various plastics, coatings, adhesives, elastomers, as well as floor polishes and paints.

Acrylic acid is used in many industries, including the diaper industry, the water treatment industry, and the textile industry. The annual worldwide consumption of acrylic acid is projected to reach more than an estimated 8,000 kilotons by 2020. This increase is expected due to its use in new applications, including personal care products, detergents, and products for adult incontinence.

==Substituents==
As a substituent acrylic acid can be found as an acyl group or a carboxyalkyl group, depending on the removal of the group from the molecule.

More specifically, these are:
# The acryloyl group, with the removal of the −OH from carbon-1.
# The 2-carboxyethenyl group, with the removal of a −H from carbon-3. This substituent group is found in chlorophyll.

==Safety==
Acrylic acid is severely irritating and corrosive to the skin and the respiratory tract. Eye contact can result in severe and irreversible injury. Low exposure will cause minimal or no health effects, while high exposure could result in pulmonary edema. The is 340 mg/kg (rat, oral) with the lowest recorded being 293 mg/kg (oral, rat) comparable to ethylene glycol which is indicative of being a potent poison. Ethyl acrylate was once used as synthetic food flavoring and was withdrawn by FDA possibly due to cancerogenic effects observed in lab animals.

Animal studies showed that high-doses of acrylic acid decreased weight gain. Acrylic acid can be converted to non-toxic lactic acid.

Acrylic acid is a constituent of tobacco smoke.

<text>Sir Lennox Randal Francis Berkeley CBE (12 May 190326 December 1989) was an English composer.

== Biography ==

Berkeley was born on 12 May 1903 in Oxford, England, the younger child and only son of Aline Carla (1863–1935), daughter of Sir James Charles Harris, former British consul in Monaco, and Royal Navy Captain Hastings George FitzHardinge Berkeley (1855–1934), the illegitimate and eldest son of George Lennox Rawdon Berkeley, the 7th Earl of Berkeley (1827–1888). He attended the Dragon School in Oxford, going on to Gresham&#x27;s School, in Holt, Norfolk and St George&#x27;s School in Harpenden, Hertfordshire. He studied French at Merton College, Oxford, graduating with a fourth class degree in 1926. While at university he coxed the college rowing eight. He became an honorary fellow of Merton College in 1974.

In 1927, he went to Paris to study music with Nadia Boulanger, and there became acquainted with Francis Poulenc, Igor Stravinsky, Darius Milhaud, Arthur Honegger and Albert Roussel. Berkeley also studied with Maurice Ravel, often cited as a key influence in Berkeley&#x27;s technical development as a composer.

In 1936, he met Benjamin Britten, also a former pupil of Gresham&#x27;s School, at the ISCM Festival in Barcelona. Berkeley fell in love with Britten, who appears to have been wary of entering a relationship, writing in his diary, &quot;we have come to an agreement on that subject.&quot; Nevertheless, the two composers shared a house for a year, living in the Old Mill at Snape, Suffolk, which Britten had acquired in July 1937. They subsequently enjoyed a long friendship and artistic association, collaborating on a number of works; these included the suite of Catalan dances titled &quot;Mont Juic&quot;, and &quot;Variations on an Elizabethan Theme&quot; (the latter also with four other composers).

He worked for the BBC during the Second World War, where he met his future wife, Elizabeth Freda Bernstein (1923–2016) whom he married on 14 December 1946. Together they had three sons: their eldest son Michael Berkeley, Baron Berkeley of Knighton, is also a composer, and their youngest son is the photographer Nick Berkeley.

He wrote several piano works for the pianist Colin Horsley, who commissioned the Horn Trio and some piano pieces, and gave the first performances and/or made the premier recordings of a number of his works, including his third Piano Concerto (1958).

He was Professor of Composition in the Royal Academy of Music from 1946 to 1968. His students included Richard Rodney Bennett, David Bedford, Adam Pounds, Richard Stoker, Clive Strutt, John Tavener and Brian Ferneyhough. Ferneyhough felt that he learned nothing from Berkeley because of the gap between their musical conceptions, remembering him as &quot;a notably urbane and well-meaning presence&quot; whose &quot;Nadia Boulenger influenced gallic aesthetics were completely unable to deal with my compositional needs.&quot;

1954 saw the premiere of his first opera, &quot;Nelson&quot;, at Sadler&#x27;s Wells. He was knighted in 1974 and from 1977 to 1983 was President of the Cheltenham Festival.

He resided at 8 Warwick Avenue, London, from 1947 until his death in 1989. On 20 March 1990 a memorial service was held for him at Westminster Cathedral, London.

== Honours ==
* 1983 : Member of the Royal Academy of Science, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium.

==Musical style==

Berkeley&#x27;s earlier music is broadly tonal, influenced by the neoclassical music of Stravinsky. Berkeley&#x27;s contact and friendship with composers such as Ravel and Poulenc and his studies in Paris with Boulanger lend his music a &#x27;French&#x27; quality, demonstrated by its &quot;emphasis on melody, the lucid textures and a conciseness of expression&quot;. He maintained a negative view of atonal music at least up until 1948, when he wrote:

However, from the mid-1950s, Berkeley apparently felt a need to revise his style of composition, later telling the Canadian composer, R. Murray Schafer that &quot;it&#x27;s natural for a composer to feel a need to enlarge his idiom.&quot; He started including tone rows and aspects of serial technique in his compositions around the time of the Concertino, Op. 49 (1955) and the opera &quot;Ruth&quot; (1955–56). His shift in opinion was demonstrated in an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; in 1959:

<text>Sai Noi (, ) is the northwesternmost district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) of Nonthaburi province, central Thailand.

==Geography==
Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise): Lat Bua Luang (Phra Nakhon Si Ayutthaya province); Lat Lum Kaeo (Pathum Thani province); Bang Bua Thong, Bang Yai, and the districts Phutthamonthon and Bang Len of Nakhon Pathom province.

==History==
At first the area was administered from Bang Bua Thong District. On 1 January 1948 four sub-districts were split off to form the new minor district (&quot;king amphoe&quot;) Sai Noi. On 6 June 1956 it was elevated to full district status.

In 1959 Tambon Khun Si was transferred from Bang Len District (Nakhon Pathom) to become part of Sai Noi.

In 1979 the southern part of Tambon Rat Niyom formed the new tambon, Khlong Khwang. The following year the southern part of Tambon Sai Noi was split off to create Tambon Thawi Watthana.

==Economy==
One of the world&#x27;s leading tropical seed companies, East-West Seed (EWS), has its global headquarters in the district. EWS was named the world&#x27;s top-ranked number seed provider to smallholder farmers by the Amsterdam-based Access to Seeds Foundation.

Most areas of Sai Noi are still rural. Most residents have a rice farming career.

==Administration==
The district is divided into seven sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;), which are further subdivided into 68 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;). Sai Noi itself has sub-district municipality status (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;) which covers parts of &quot;tambons&quot; Sai Noi and Khlong Khwang. There are a further seven tambon administrative organizations (TAO).

<doc id="858843" wikidata="Q796604" url="?curid=858843" title="Acetylation">
<text>In chemistry, acetylation is an organic esterification reaction with acetic acid. It introduces an acetyl group into a chemical compound. Such compounds are termed &quot;acetate esters&quot; or simply &quot;acetates&quot;. Deacetylation is the opposite reaction, the removal of an acetyl group from a chemical compound.

== Acetylation/deacetylation in biology ==
Histone deacetylases &quot;play crucial roles in gene transcription and most likely in all eukaryotic biological processes that involve chromatin&quot;.

Acetylation is one type of post-translational modification of proteins. The acetylation of the ε-amino group of lysine, which is common, converts a charged side chain to a neutral one. Acetylation/deacetylation of histones also plays a role in gene expression and cancer. These modifications are effected by enzymes called histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). 

Two general mechanisms are known for deacetylation. One mechanism involves zinc binding to the acetyl oxygen. Another family of deacetylases require NAD+, which transfers an ribosyl group to the acetyl oxygen.

== Organic synthesis ==
Acetate esters and acetamides are generally prepared by acetylations. Acetylations are often used in making C-acetyl bonds in Friedel-Crafts reactions. Carbanions and their equivalents are susceptible to acetylations.

=== Acetylation reagents ===
Many acetylations are achieved using these three reagents:
*Acetic anhydride. This reagent is common in the laboratory; its use cogenerates acetic acid.
*Acetyl chloride. This reagent is also common in the laboratory, but its use cogenerates hydrogen chloride, which can be undesirable.
*Ketene. At one time acetic anhydride was prepared by the reaction of ketene with acetic acid:
: formula_1

=== Acetylation of cellulose ===

Cellulose is a polyol and thus susceptible to acetylation, which is achieved using acetic anhydride. Acetylation disrupts hydrogen bonding, which otherwise dominates the properties of cellulose. Consequently, the cellulose esters are soluble in organic solvents and can be cast into fibers and films.

=== Acetylation of wood ===

Acetylation of wood is a chemical modification process that enhances the properties of wood by making it highly resistant to fungi and insects, as well as very durable against moisture and environmental parameters. 

The process involves the chemical reaction of acetic anhydride with the free hydroxyl groups in wood polymers, mostly of lignin and hemicelluloses, without requiring a catalyst. The modification results in bonds between the structural polymeric components, significantly reducing the ability of the -OH groups to form hydrogen bonds with water molecules. This effectively &quot;locks&quot; the cellular walls, minimizing the capacity of wood to absorb water and enhancing its dimensional stability. Approximately 80-90% of the hydroxyl groups of wood are modified during the process. The whole process is an environmentally friendly treatment, and has emerged, in the 21st century, as a significant innovation in the scientific area of wood science.

=== Transacetylation===
Transacetylation uses vinyl acetate as an acetyl donor and lipase as a catalyst. This methodology allows the preparation of enantio-enriched alcohols and acetates.

<text>Pak Kret (, ) is a district (&quot;amphoe&quot;) in the northeastern part of Nonthaburi province, central Thailand.

==Geography==
The district is in the northeast of the province. It borders (from north clockwise) the districts Lat Lum Kaeo and Mueang Pathum Thani of Pathum Thani province, Don Mueang and Lak Si of Bangkok, and Mueang Nonthaburi and Bang Bua Thong of Nonthaburi.

The district is crossed by the Chao Phraya River. A large oxbow of the river has been shortened by a canal, Khlong Lat Kret, dug in 1722 in the Ayuthaya Era, to form the island of Ko Kret.

==Administration==
The district is divided into 12 sub-districts (&quot;tambons&quot;). These are further subdivided into 85 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
Five of the &quot;tambons&quot; covering 34 villages belong to the city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) of Pak Kret. Bang Phlap itself has had township (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;) status since 2013. The other six &quot;tambons&quot; are each administered by a Tambon Administrative Organization (TAO).

<text>Colonel James Power Carne (11 April 1906 – 19 April 1986) was a British Army officer who served in both the Second World War and the Korean War. He was also a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces, for actions during the Battle of the Imjin River during which Carne led &quot;The Glorious Glosters&quot; in a famous stand against an overwhelming Chinese attack on Gloster Hill.

==Early life==
Carne was born in Falmouth, Cornwall on 11 April 1906 the son of George Newby Carne and Annie Emily Le Poar Carne (née Power). His father was a brewer and wine merchant. A career officer, he attended the Imperial Service College in Windsor and later passed out from the Royal Military College, Sandhurst and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Gloucestershire Regiment on 3 September 1925. He was promoted to lieutenant on 3 September 1927 and to captain on 1 October 1935. Seeing service in the Second World War, he was promoted to major on 3 September 1942. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 7 February 1949.

==Korean War==
Carne was 45 years old and a lieutenant colonel commanding the 1st Battalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment in November 1950 when the regiment was attached to the 29th Independent Infantry Brigade and deployed to Korea following the outbreak of the Korean War. Carne led his battalion as they provided the rearguard to retreating United Nations forces following their defeat at the Battle of the Ch&#x27;ongch&#x27;on River. He also led the Glosters in a successful counter-offensive launched by UN forces on 16 February south of the River Han.

===Battle of the Imjin River and Victoria Cross===
In early April, Carne and his battalion were spread over a 9-mile (14 km) front along the Imjin River guarding a ford which was part of the main route to the city of Seoul. During the night of 22 April, Chinese forces launched their Spring Offensive which was intended to annihilate the British 29th Brigade as well as the US 3rd Infantry Division, thus enabling the capture of Seoul and delivering a crushing blow to UN forces in Korea.

In what became known as the Battle of the Imjin River, Carne&#x27;s Glosters and the rest of the British brigade were met by an onslaught of over 27,000 Chinese troops attacking in massed waves. Carne&#x27;s leadership was instrumental in allowing the Glosters to hold their ground during the attack during which the following deed took place for which he was awarded the VC:

By the morning of 24 April, Carne and the surviving Glosters gathered on Hill 235 where he received orders from 3rd Division commander General Soule that the Glosters were to hold their ground and await reinforcements. These reinforcements, however, were forced to retreat just 2,000 yards (1,800 m) short of the Glosters&#x27; position, leaving the Glosters alone in trying to hold Hill 235 against an entire Chinese division. Both sides fought fiercely throughout the night for control over the hill and by the morning of 25 April, the Glosters still held the hill but had very little ammunition, no hope of relief and no artillery support. Carne requested permission to attempt a breakout and ordered his men to split into small groups and make as best they could back to the British lines. Only 63 of his men would succeed in doing this with the rest of the battalion, including Carne, being either killed, captured or wounded. Despite the battalion&#x27;s effective annihilation, the Glosters&#x27; stand earned them worldwide fame as &quot;The Glorious Glosters&quot; and enabled the rest of the British and American forces to retreat before they too were overwhelmed.

===Prisoner of war===
Carne fell into Chinese captivity after his 700-man battalion&#x27;s astonishing resistance against an estimated 11,000 attackers was finally overcome. As the senior British officer among hundreds of prisoners kept in appalling conditions in camps in communist-held Korea, he was singled out for special treatment. While the other ranks were &quot;re-educated&quot; by the communist commissars at their camps, Carne was kept in solitary confinement.

According to documents held at the National Archives in Kew and not made public until 2006, when Carne was released in September 1953 he told Sir Esler Dening, the British ambassador in Tokyo, &quot;an extraordinary story&quot; of brainwashing. &quot;He says that between January 1952 and August this year he was kept in solitary confinement by Chinese communists and subjected to a softening-up process including the use of drugs, [the] result of which was, as he put it, to make his brain like a sponge, capable of receiving any kind of information put into it&quot;, Sir Esler told the Foreign Office in a &quot;top secret&quot; category telegram.

The note, which was sent straight to Sir Winston Churchill, in his second term as prime minister, went on: &quot;In March of this year, (i.e. about the time when the communists displayed a new interest in concluding an armistice) various thoughts were put into his mind, and he remains convinced that he was meant to retain these and pass them on to Her Majesty&#x27;s Government.&quot; The thoughts comprised a peace deal not just to end the war in Korea, but to reach a settlement covering the whole Pacific region. Sir Esler opined: &quot;The whole thing might be pure fantasy except for the fact that Colonel Carne could hardly have invented it and does not strike one as that sort of person.&quot; The Foreign Office was sceptical about the plot, but suggested that perhaps its aim was to split Britain from its American ally.

==Popular culture==
In 1954 it was announced that Warwick Productions wanted to make a film &quot;The Glorious Glosters&quot; starring Alan Ladd as Carne based on a script by Max Trell. However the film was never made. Carne was honoured by South Korea in 2015 when his image was featured on a South Korean stamp issued to commemorate the 65th anniversary of the start of the Korean War.

==Later life==
Carne settled in Gloucestershire in retirement and died in 1986. He was cremated at the Bouncer&#x27;s Lane Cemetery, Cheltenham, and buried at Cranham.

<text>Badwater Basin is an endorheic basin in Death Valley National Park, Death Valley, Inyo County, California, noted as the lowest point in North America and the United States, with a depth of below sea level. Mount Whitney, the highest point in the contiguous United States, is only to the northwest.

The site itself consists of a small spring-fed pool of &quot;bad water&quot; next to the road in a sink; the accumulated salts of the surrounding basin make it undrinkable, thus giving it the name. The pool does have animal and plant life, including pickleweed, aquatic insects, and the Badwater snail.

Badwater Crater, the lowest place on the planet Mars, is named after the basin due to their similarities. Adjacent to the pool, where water is not always present at the surface, repeated freeze–thaw and evaporation cycles gradually push the thin salt crust into hexagonal shapes.

The pool is not the lowest point of the basin: the lowest point (which is only slightly lower) is several miles to the west and varies in position, depending on rainfall and evaporation patterns. The salt flats are hazardous to traverse (in many cases being only a thin white crust over mud), and so the sign marking the low point is at the pool instead. The basin was considered the lowest elevation in the Western Hemisphere until the discovery of Laguna del Carbón in Argentina at .

==Geography==
At Badwater Basin, significant rainstorms flood the valley bottom periodically, covering the salt pan with a thin sheet of standing water, forming a temporary lake known as Lake Manly. Newly formed lakes do not last long though, because the of average rainfall is overwhelmed by a annual evaporation rate and usually lakes are only a couple inches deep. This is the greatest evaporation potential in the United States, meaning that a lake could dry up in a single year. When the basin is flooded, some of the salt is dissolved; it is redeposited as clean crystals when the water evaporates.

A popular site for tourists is the sign marking &quot;sea level&quot; on the cliff above the Badwater Basin. Similar to Owens Lake, it is characterized by a deep bed of unconsolidated valley fill from which the salt crust emerges.

==History==
The current best understanding of the area&#x27;s geological history is that the entire region between the Colorado River in the east and Baja California in the southwest (and bordered by various uplifts and mountains around the west-northwest-northern perimeters) has seen numerous cycles since at least the start of the Pleistocene (and perhaps up to 3 Ma). In these cycles, pluvial lakes of varying size have come and gone in a complex cycle, mainly tied to changing climate patterns (particularly, glaciation during the numerous recent Ice Age cycles), but also influenced by the progressive depositing of alluvial plains and deltas by the Colorado River, as can also be seen in the case of the Salton Sea. These alternate with periodic water body breakthroughs and rearrangements due to erosion and the proximity of the San Andreas Fault. This process has resulted in a high number of evaporating and reforming endorheic lakes throughout the Quaternary Period in the area, with an intertwined history of various larger bodies of water subsuming smaller ones during water table maxima and the subsequent splitting and disappearance thereof during the evaporative part of the cycles. Although these local cycles are now somewhat modified by human presence, their legacy persists; despite appearances much to the contrary, Death Valley actually sits atop one of the largest aquifers in the world.

Throughout the Quaternary&#x27;s wetter spans, streams running from nearby mountains filled Death Valley, creating Lake Manly, which during its greatest extents was approximately 80 mi (130 km) long and up to 600 ft (180 m) deep. Numerous evaporation cycles and a lack of outflow caused an increasing hypersalinity, typical for endorheic bodies of water. Over time, this hypersalinization, combined with sporadic rainfall and occasional aquifer intrusion, has resulted in periods of &quot;briny soup&quot;, or salty pools, on the lowest parts of Death Valley&#x27;s floor. Salts (95% table salt – NaCl) began to crystallize, coating the surface with the thick crust, ranging from , now observable at the basin floor.

<doc id="858873" wikidata="Q45359" url="?curid=858873" title="James Chance and the Contortions">
<text>James Chance and the Contortions (initially known simply as Contortions, a spin-off group is called James White and the Blacks) was a musical group led by saxophonist and vocalist James Chance, formed in 1977. They were a central act of New York City&#x27;s downtown no wave music scene in the late 1970s, and were featured on the influential compilation &quot;No New York&quot; (1978).

==Recording history==
Their first recording, credited solely as Contortions, was on the 1978 compilation, &quot;No New York&quot;, produced by Brian Eno. The following year, two albums were issued almost simultaneously on ZE Records; &quot;Buy&quot; and &quot;Off White&quot; under the moniker James White and the Blacks. The same musicians recorded both records, though none are credited on the album covers. The Contortions appeared in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s film &quot;Das Todesmagazin&quot; in 1979.

In 2016, Chance released his first single with his original Contortions band in nearly 30 years, entitled &quot;Melt Yourself Down&quot;. A music video for the single was directed, filmed and animated by 19 year old Dylan Greenberg and is considered the first Contortions music video to make significant use of dramatic digital effects, such as Chance&#x27;s face being manipulated to appear as if it were melting.

==Band members==
Original Contortions guitarist Pat Place went on to found the group Bush Tetras. Bass player George Scott played with Lydia Lunch and Michael Paumgarten in 8-Eyed Spy. Shortly thereafter, guitarist Jody Harris formed Raybeats with Don Christensen, George Scott III and Pat Irwin. Keyboardist Adele Bertei formed the Bloods, after which she released a solo record, &quot;Little Lives&quot;, in 1988. In 1979 George Scott toured with John Cale, as documented on the album &quot;Sabotage Live&quot;. Scott died of a heroin overdose on August 5, 1980. Steven Kramer played organ and percussion in the second incarnation of the Contortions in 1979–80, and later led the Twin Cities MN funk/polka band The Wallets. Some of the members of James White and the Blacks, notably Joseph Bowie, separated from Chance and formed the band Defunkt.

On November 30, 2010, James Chance, Pat Place, Don Christensen, Jody Harris, Adele Bertei, and Robert Aaron reunited as James Chance and the Contortions at Le Poisson Rouge for a single performance. Robert Aaron was not an original member but frequently collaborated with Chance.

James Chance died on June 18, 2024 at the age of 71.

==Legacy==
The Contortions were featured in 2023 at the Centre Pompidou in a Nicolas Ballet curated No Wave exhibition entitled &quot;Who You Staring At: Culture visuelle de la scène no wave des années 1970 et 1980&quot; (&quot;Visual culture of the no wave scene in the 1970s and 1980s&quot;).

<text>The Duryea Motor Wagon Company, established in 1895 in Springfield, Massachusetts, was the first American firm to build gasoline automobiles.

==History==
Founded by Charles Duryea and his brother Frank, the company built the Duryea Motor Wagon, a one-cylinder four-horsepower car, first demonstrated on September 21, 1893, in Springfield, Massachusetts, on Taylor Street in Metro Center. It is considered the first successful gas-engine vehicle built in the U.S.

In 1895, a second Duryea (built in 1894), driven by Frank, won the &quot;Chicago Times Herald&quot; race in Chicago on a snowy Thanksgiving day. He traveled 54 miles (87 km) at an average speed of 7.5 mph (12 km/h), marking the first U.S. auto race in which any entrants finished. That same year, the brothers began commercial production, with thirteen cars sold by the end of 1896. Their first ten production vehicles were the first automobiles sold in the United States. Banking on the idea that future racing successes would propel their market share, the brothers entered two vehicles in Britain&#x27;s London to Brighton Veteran Car Run. Frank placed first and beat out the nearest competition by 75 minutes.

The brothers went their separate ways by the end of the century, over a dispute for financing that would have required moving the company to Detroit. Frank helped produce the Stevens-Duryea (at gun maker Stevens) until 1927, while Charles produced Duryea vehicles as late as 1917. Based in Reading, Pennsylvania, it was not uncommon for residents to see him motoring a brand new automobile from City Park out to Mount Penn, using the switchback road as a final test of durability and refinement.

Charles Duryea moved to Reading in February 1900. By 1901, Duryea and Sternbergh incorporated the Duryea Power Company &quot;for the manufacture of iron, steel, bath, any metal or wood or both, including automobiles, motors, propellers, and part of either.&quot; By March 1902, after overcoming difficulties procuring factory space, and a devastating flood of the Schuylkill River, Duryea was manufacturing one three-wheel, three-cylinder, gasoline-powered automobile each week. Most buyers were doctors, who enjoyed the power, reliability, and heady 20 mile-an-hour top speed of his vehicles.
By 1905, Duryea&#x27;s fifty workers were manufacturing sixty cars a year, including the four-wheel Phaeton, which soon sold for $1,600. Duryea&#x27;s automobiles were a success, but a dispute among the company&#x27;s partners led to collapse of the business in 1907. Undaunted, Charles Duryea designed a new automobile with significant design innovations, including a two-cylinder, air-cooled engine, which he named the &quot;Buggyaut.&quot; Manufactured in a garage at 32 Carpenter St., the Buggyaut was an inexpensive auto with large wheels designed for rural markets and unpaved roads. To make the car affordable, Duryea introduced a simple body design, mounted on the side bars of the chassis, in usual buggy fashion, that made the Buggyaut light and easy riding. The two-passenger model, complete with a top, sold for only $700, but the Buggyaut never achieved the success that he had envisioned. In 1914, Duryea closed the garage and left Reading.

In 1916, eight years after Henry Ford introduced his Model T, Duryea made another attempt to produce his own &quot;car for the people.&quot; With financing from Keyser Fry of Reading, he created the Duryea GEM, a cross between an automobile and a motorcycle, with a newly designed engine and suspension. Advertised as the &quot;Biggest Idea in the History of the Motor Car and the Last Word in Automobile Construction,&quot; the Duryea GEM combined the comfort and stability of an automobile with the simplicity, handling, and economy of a motorcycle. It was also extremely affordable, costing only $250 and boasting an impressive 65 miles of driving per gallon of gasoline. Once again, however, lack of funding forced Duryea to drop the project, with only six being thought to have been built. The GEM was the last automobile built by Charles Duryea.

Although Charles did discuss with Frank Duryea the building of the first commercially successful American automobile, Frank was the actual builder during their collaboration. He did correspond with his brother Charles regarding what did and did not work in the design. Charles left Springfield in 1892 before construction began. This was documented in transcripts during the Selden Patent trial.

Boyertown Museum of Historic Vehicles in Boyertown, Pennsylvania hosts an annual Duryea Day Antique and Classic Car Show, which features an extensive collection of automobiles manufactured in southeastern Pennsylvania in the early 20th century. Since 1951, the SCCA has sponsored a biannual &quot;Duryea Hillclimb&quot; race in Reading which traces Charles&#x27; original test route.

<text>Lieutenant Philip Kenneth Edward Curtis VC (7 July 1926 – 23 April 1951) was a British Army officer and a recipient of the Victoria Cross (VC), the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Curtis was posthumously awarded the VC for his actions during the Battle of Imjin in the Korean War.

==Military career==
Curtis was born in Devonport in Devon, the only child of John Curtis, a labourer, and his wife, Florence . As a teenager he served as a volunteer ARP warden. In 1944 he joined the British Army, but did not go overseas. On 3 May 1946 he was commissioned into the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry as a second lieutenant, before being demobilised in 1948 and placed on the reserve of officers. 

After the outbreak of the Korean War in 1950, Curtis was recalled to active service and joined A company, 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment in Korea in March 1951. In late April 1951, A company was given the task of defending Castle Hill, a feature south of Imjin River, over which the Chinese were expected to attack, but isolated from the rest of the battalion. This was when the following deed took place for which Curtis, a 24-year-old lieutenant, was awarded the Victoria Cross during the Battle of Imjin.

On 22/23 April 1951 near the Imjin River, Korea, during a heavy enemy attack, No. 1 platoon under the command of Lieutenant Curtis, was ordered to carry out a counter-attack which was initially successful, but was eventually held up by heavy fire and grenades. The lieutenant then ordered some of his men to give covering fire while he himself rushed the main position of resistance. In this charge he was severely wounded but he insisted on making a second attempt. While making another desperate charge he was killed when within a few yards of his objective after throwing a grenade which destroyed the enemy position immediately after.

Anthony Farrar-Hockley, adjutant of the Glosters at Imjin River, witnessed Lieutenant Curtis&#x27; gallant deed, a desperate counterattack to regain a key position lost to the Chinese advance. At sunrise a Chinese attack was repulsed, but the British position was untenable. Below is part of Farrar-Hockley&#x27;s account.

Curtis is buried in the United Nations Memorial Cemetery, Busan, Korea.

==The medal==
The VC investiture took place on 6 July 1954. Since Curtis&#x27;s wife Joan had died before the Korean War, the investiture was attended by his mother, his seven-year-old daughter Susan and his mother-in-law, Beatrice Hayes.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry Museum in Bodmin, Cornwall.

==Citation==
The War Office, 1st December 1953:

The Queen has been graciously pleased to approve the posthumous award of the Victoria Cross to Lieutenant Philip Kenneth Edward Curtis (365680), The Duke of Cornwall&#x27;s Light Infantry, attached The Gloucestershire Regiment, in recognition of gallant and distinguished services in Korea.

During the first phase of the Battle of the Imjin River on the night of 22nd/23rd April 1951, &quot;A&quot; Company, 1 Glosters, was heavily attacked by a large enemy force. By dawn on 23rd April, the enemy had secured a footing on the &#x27;Castle Hill&#x27; site in very close proximity to No. 2 Platoon&#x27;s position. The Company Commander ordered No. 1 Platoon, under the command of Lieutenant CURTIS, to carry out a counter-attack with a view to dislodging the enemy from the position. Under the covering of medium machine guns, the counterattack, gallantly led by Lieutenant CURTIS, gained initial success but was eventually held up by heavy fire and grenades. Enemy from just below the crest of the hill were rushed to reinforce the position and a fierce fire-fight developed, grenades also being freely used by both sides in this close quarter engagement. Lieutenant CURTIS ordered some of his men to give him covering fire while he himself rushed the main position of resistance; in this charge Lieutenant CURTIS was severely wounded by a grenade. Several of his men crawled out and pulled him back under cover but, recovering himself, Lieutenant CURTIS insisted on making a second attempt. Breaking free from the men who wished to restrain him, he made another desperate charge, hurling grenades as he went, but was killed by a burst of fire when within a few yards of his objective.

Although the immediate objective of this counter-attack was not achieved, it had yet a great effect on the subsequent course of the battle; for although the enemy had gained a footing on a position vital to the defence of the whole Company area, this success had resulted in such furious reaction that they made no further effort to exploit their success in this immediate area; had they done so, the eventual withdrawal of the Company might well have proved impossible.

Lieutenant CURTIS&#x27;s conduct was magnificent throughout this bitter battle.

<text>The gasoline-powered Oldsmobile Model R, also known as the Curved Dash Oldsmobile, is credited as being the first mass-produced automobile, meaning that it was built on an assembly line using interchangeable parts. It was introduced by the Oldsmobile company in 1901 and produced through 1903; 425 were produced the first year, 2,500 in 1902, and over 19,000 were built in all. When General Motors assumed operations from Ransom E. Olds on November 12, 1908, GM introduced the Oldsmobile Model 20, which was the 1908 Buick Model 10 with a stretched wheelbase and minor exterior changes.

==Features and price==
It was a runabout model, could seat two passengers, and sold for US$650. While competitive, due to high volume, and priced below the US$850 two-seat Ford Model C &quot;Doctor&#x27;s Car&quot;, it was more expensive than the Western 1905 Gale Model A roadster at US$500. The Black sold for $375, and the Success for US$250. It was built as a city car for short distance driving, while the larger Model S could carry four passengers and could travel longer distances.

The flat-mounted, water-cooled, single-cylinder engine, situated at the center of the car, produced , relying on a brass gravity feed carburetor. The transmission was a semiautomatic design with two forward speeds and one reverse. The low-speed forward and reverse gear system is a planetary type (epicyclic). The car weighed and used Concord springs. It had a top speed of .

The car&#x27;s success was partially by accident; in 1901, a fire destroyed a number of other prototypes before they could be approved for production, leaving the Curved Dash as the only one intact. As workers were attempting to move the prototypes out of the burning building, they were only successful at rescuing one prototype, the Model R Curved Dash.

==Models==
In 1904, the Model R was replaced by the Model 6C, which had a larger 1,931 cc engine; in addition, drum brakes replaced the band brake. After 2,234 copies, the 6C model was discontinued in December 1904.

In 1905, the Model B was introduced with more improvements. The engine received improved cooling and a new flywheel, and the handbrake now worked on the differential instead of the gearbox. The leaf spring suspension was modified so that the reinforced axles were connected to all spring elements. In 1906, the car received celluloid side window curtains. The dashboard was also offered with an upright position, called the Straight Dash, and approximately 6,500 Model B were manufactured, and the Model F was introduced in 1907, again with mechanical improvements.

The Model B also saw a limited production Touring Sedan with a novel entry approach called the Side Entrance Touring Sedan where passengers would enter from the middle of the car. The engine was a two cylinder horizontally opposed engine installed underneath the passenger compartment that powered the rear wheels, and the transmission was a two-speed planetary gearbox. Sales were not successful and it was cancelled by 1906.

===Oldsmobile Pirate Beach Racer===

In 1902, Mr. Olds modified a Model R and essentially stripped it down to an engine, a single seat, and a radiator, and connected the solid front and rear axles on semi-elliptic leaf springs, which then supported the engine, transmission and passenger. He raced it at Florida&#x27;s Ormond Beach in 1902 and 1903, where his driver Horace Thomas drove the Pirate to a record speed of 54.38 mph.

<text>The Duryea Motor Wagon was among the first standardized automobiles and among the first powered by gasoline. Fifteen examples were built by the Duryea Motor Wagon Company of Chicopee, Massachusetts, between 1893 and 1896. Their enterprise followed the first commercially available automobile which was patented by Karl Benz on January 29, 1886, and put into production in 1888.

To construct the first Duryea Motor Wagon, the brothers had purchased a used horse-drawn buggy for $70 and then installed a , single cylinder gasoline engine. The car had a friction transmission, spray carburetor, and low tension ignition. It was road-tested again on 10 November, when the newspaper &quot;The Springfield Republican&quot; made the announcement. The car was put into storage in 1894 and stayed there until 1920 when it was rescued by Inglis M. Uppercu and presented to the United States National Museum. The Duryea Motor Wagon remained in production until 1917.

The Duryea brothers entered their horseless carriage in many shows and races. The Duryea Motor Wagon carriage won first place in the first-ever American automobile race, the Times-Herald race, in 1896. The Duryeas also won first and second place in the Cosmopolitan Race on Decoration Day, 1896 in New York City. On November 14, 1896, they joined the Procession/Race from London to Brighton England.

Davidson-Duryea Gun Carriage

The Duryea was used as the basis of the Davidson-Duryea car of 1898, which has the distinction of being the first American armored car. The car, which was photographed by the Chicago Tribune, was adapted from the commercial passenger model by installing a forward-firing M1895 Colt-Browning machine gun operated by the front passenger. It featured an armored shield between the front wheel and steering tiller. The conversion was devised by inventor Major (later Colonel) R.P. Davidson, of the Illinois National Guard, then commandant of the Northwestern Military and Naval Academy, Highland Park, Illinois.

<doc id="858900" wikidata="Q349673" url="?curid=858900" title="Norwich Airport">
<text>Norwich Airport is an international airport in Norfolk, England, north of the city of Norwich. In 2023, Norwich Airport was the 25th busiest airport in the UK and busiest in East Anglia.

Norwich Airport has a Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) Public Use Aerodrome Licence that allows flights for the public transport of passengers or for flying instruction. Along with a long history of flights to Amsterdam Airport Schiphol via KLM Cityhopper, it offers flights to various destinations in the United Kingdom and Europe. Besides the commercial flights, charter operators also operate from Norwich. Bristow Helicopters, DanCopter, and Babcock Mission Critical Services Offshore fly crews to North Sea gas and oil rigs, and SaxonAir operates executive, private aircraft and helicopter charter flights.

The airport was established on the aerodrome site of RAF Horsham St Faith, a former Royal Air Force station in the early 1970s, under the ownership of the local authorities. It was later sold into private ownership.

==History==
The first Norwich Airport was created as a former First World War aerodrome on Mousehold Heath, on what is now the Heartsease housing estate. It opened in , and was used by Boulton &amp; Paul for aircraft test flying and other recreational activities. This aerodrome fell into disuse in the early part of the Second World War.

===RAF Horsham St Faith===

The current site, formerly known as Royal Air Force Station Horsham St Faith, or more commonly RAF Horsham St Faith, was first developed in , and officially opened on , as a Royal Air Force (RAF) bomber station. In September 1942, Horsham St. Faith was made available to the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) for use by the Eighth Air Force. The USAAF designated the airfield as Station 123 (HF).

The airfield was subsequently transferred to RAF Fighter Command on 10 July 1945, when it was occupied by four Gloster Meteor Squadrons. RAF Horsham St. Faith was a front-line RAF station for many years, and its squadrons participated in many post-war exercises. The station was deactivated on .

===Civil airport===
The Royal Air Force left Horsham on 24 March 1967. Over the following two years, the major part of the airfield and buildings were sold to Norwich City Council and Norfolk County Council, a small part being retained by the Ministry of Defence (MoD). Norwich Airport Limited, under joint ownership of the county and city councils, developed the modern day Norwich International Airport, with the main terminal opening in 1988. In 1971, the airport began operations with charter flights, with airline Air Anglia creating a base at the airfield, offering flights all over north-western Europe. Their route to Amsterdam is still operated today with KLM Cityhopper.

Most of the World War II buildings used by the USAAF and RAF remain, although converted for a variety of purposes. Two of the five large pre-war hangars are still being used for aircraft maintenance. One of the other three has been converted into an aviation academy, the remaining two have been converted for commercial use by Air Livery and KLM UK Engineering. The original military control tower still exists, although the top has been restored and a new tower has been built adjacent to the present main runway. Other wartime buildings now form part of the Norwich Airport Industrial Estate (owned by the county and city councils) and are intermingled with many newer structures. Adjacent to the airport terminal building opened by the Queen Mother, there is a memorial display relating to the USAAF, consisting of photographs, paintings, and a plaque commemorating the American use of the airfield.

The northern environs of airport also features the private City of Norwich Aviation Museum, by the control tower, commemorating the airfield&#x27;s history as a military airfield and development as a civil airport through the years, with many civil and military aircraft on display - many of which served from the aerodrome at some point in their lifetime.

The former RAF single persons accommodation blocks situated towards Old Catton were until 1993 used by the University of East Anglia as accommodation for students; known to students as &#x27;Fifers Lane&#x27; halls, these have since been demolished and the site redeveloped as housing. The remaining MoD property; airmen&#x27;s married quarters, continued to be used for nearby RAF stations (RAF Coltishall and RAF Neatishead), but due to the closure and / or reduction in size of these stations, the housing has been sold to private buyers.

Whilst most runways and taxiways from the military airfield remain, only one runway is primarily used; to avoid takeoffs and landings over built-up areas: Runway 09/27, which was extended eastwards by the RAF in 1956 to long. The 04/22 runway is no longer used for takeoffs or landings, but is used for parking and taxiing of aircraft.

In 1999, the new corporate identity was launched as Norwich International Airport, kept until April 2017.

In March 2004, the city and county councils sold 80.1% of Norwich Airport Limited to Omniport, whilst retaining the remaining 19.9%. Omniport has also acquired 100% of Norwich Airport Travel Limited (the separate travel agency located within the airport passenger terminal). Following the sale to Omniport, the airport became one of the UK hubs for budget airline Flybe, and the number of flights and destinations served increased. In 2005, a £3.5 million terminal expansion programme began.

In 2009, during filming of the BBC show &quot;Top Gear&quot;, operations from the airport appeared to be disrupted when a caravan, adapted into an airship and flown by James May, drifted overhead the airport, infringing its controlled airspace. In reality, the event occurred after much pre-planning between the airport authorities and the BBC; and scenes showing the airship in the airfield boundary were actually filmed after it had lifted off from the airfield to satisfy the requirements of the film crew.

In 2007, the airport introduced its Airport Development Fee (ADF). All passengers over 16 years old departing from the airport pay a fee of £10.

In 2014, the airport was sold by the majority stakeholders of Omniport to the Rigby Group, who integrated the airport as part of Regional &amp; City Airports in April 2017.

Norwich International Airport announced in 2015 that four new routes were being considered for Department for Transport (DfT) funding. The routes being considered included: Dublin Airport (Flybe, double daily return weekdays, single return weekends), Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport (Flybe, daily return), Newcastle Airport (Links Air, double daily weekday return), and Exeter Airport (Flybe, daily return). Links Air proposed a start date of 1 September 2016, but the airline was put into liquidation. In November 2015, it was announced that bids for routes to Newcastle and Exeter had been successful, with the inaugural flight to the latter on 24 March 2016, operated by Flybe. Flybe also confirmed plans to operate summer sun and winter ski routes from Norwich Airport as part of a five-year deal with the Regional &amp; City Airports (RCA) group. From May 2016, one of Flybe&#x27;s Embraer ERJ-195 aircraft began operating multi-weekly flights from Norwich to Alicante and Málaga.

In 2016, an engine test facility opened on site. The KLM UK Engineering Academy opened on 18 April 2017.

On 6 July 2017, Managing Director Richard Pace announced a 30 year vision to treble passenger numbers at the airport. The plans include raising annual passenger numbers to 930,000 by 2030, and 1.4 million by 2045, forging new routes to Paris Charles de Gaulle and Dublin to boost the choice of worldwide destinations and constructing a 100 acre business park for both aviation and non-aviation companies; it was originally frozen by investors in 2015 waiting for the new Northern Distributor Road to be completed. Further plans include extending Runway 27/09 by , and building new taxiways to boost capacity and allow larger aircraft to operate to the airport. Another 10 year ambition was seeking permission to allow flights to fly until up to 01:30 (currently, the curfew is put in place at 23:00, with the airport placing charges for any arrivals after 21:30) for four nights a week. Pace says the new Broadland Northway (NDR) is &quot;unlocking the potential for the site to generate growth for the region and the airport&quot;, and &quot;the masterplan sets out the vision for the future development of Norwich Airport and its continued vital role in supporting our region’s economy&quot;.

On 10 November 2017, a discussion between the airport, Norwich City Council, Broadland District Council, and Norfolk County Council took place on the possible relocation of the Mile Cross Recycling Centre in Norwich, whose contract was to end in 2021. County Hall put aside £2.75m in funding for the new centre, which was approved in February. The move was floated due to Norfolk County Council wanting to integrate its highway maintenance, fleet vehicle storage, park and ride and a strategic salt store into one location, called the Norwich Depot Hub. This would have been located north of the airport, near the new Northern Distributor Road, which the Council claimed would offer easier access than to the current site in the city; however, this was scrapped when councillors were told it would not make enough savings to justify the outlay. A new site has been identified north of the Broadland Northway (near its junction with the A140), which is jointly owned by the City Council and County Hall, whilst negotiations are underway with the private owner of the land required for an access road.

A refurbishment of the passenger terminal commenced in April 2018, to be completed in Spring 2019, increasing the number of retail shops and dining options for passengers. The airport also invested in upgrade and refurbishment works to the executive lounge at the airport, completed in May 2018.

Flybe announced in April 2019 that they would be ending jet flights from Norwich Airport as of winter 2019/20 due to them returning their Embraer 195 aircraft back to the lessors.

In July 2019, Norfolk County Council and Norwich City Council sold their remaining 19.9% stake in the airport to Regional and City Airports.

===Developments since 2020===
In December 2023, Ryanair announced they would start operating from the airport for the very first time. 3 new routes were announced to Alicante, Faro and Malta for the summer 2024 season with flights starting on 1 April 2024. The airport hopes to further develop its partnership with Ryanair in the future. In May 2024, just 6 weeks after launch of operations at Norwich, Ryanair confirmed that Alicante would continue a twice weekly for the Winter 24/25 season making it a year round destination at Norwich once again.

==Facilities==
===Runway and apron===
The airport has one operational runway (designated 09/27), in length. A smaller runway (designated 04/22) was closed in 2006, and is now used as a taxiway (south of Runway 09/27) and parking area for decommissioned aircraft (north of Runway 09/27). The airport apron has nine parking stands for commercial aircraft.

===Tenants===
Operators based at Norwich are CHC Scotia, Bristow Helicopters, NHV Helicopters, SaxonAir Charter &amp; SaxonAir Flight Support, and the East Anglian Air Ambulance.

==Airlines and destinations==

The following airlines operate regular scheduled services to and from Norwich:

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 12 December 1973, a Dassault Falcon 20 of Fred. Olsen Airtransport suffered a bird strike on takeoff from Runway 27. Both engines failed, and the aircraft made an emergency landing in a field. All three crew members were injured, but the passengers sustained no injuries. The aircraft was written off.
*On 25 October 1974, a Cessna 310 dived into the ground while on final approach, killing the pilot. The Cessna&#x27;s nose pitched down and the wings rolled over; the loss of control was caused by the uncommanded retraction of the starboard flap, caused by the failure of the drive mechanism.

==Statistics==
2022 CAA statistical data for Norwich Airport revealed a total aircraft movement count of 15,291, giving an average rate of 42 movements per day. Total passenger numbers for 2022 were recorded as 319,040.

==Public transport==
===Bus===
Konectbus operates the 501 Norwich Park and Ride service, connecting the airport terminal with Norwich city centre, six days a week (excluding Sundays), up to every 15 minutes.

Konectbus also operates route 35, &quot;Canary Konect&quot; which travels between The Nest and Carrow Park (for Carrow Road) via the Airport Terminal, Aylsham Road, Anglia Square, Tombland (For Norwich Cathedral and the City Centre), Prince of Wales Road and the railway station. This service runs up to every 60 mins, seven days a week.

Konectbus routes 512 and 515, Sanders Coaches Routes 43, X40, 44A, and X44, and First Eastern Counties route 37 all operate from within a ten-minute walk of the terminal.

===Road===
Norwich Airport is situated adjacent to the A140 Cromer Road which runs from Ipswich, through Norwich and on to the seaside town of Cromer; this also provides easy road access to Norwich city centre. The entrance to the airport is around from the city centre. The A1270 Broadland Northway (also known as the Norwich Northern Distributor Road or NDR) links the airport to the A47 to Lowestoft in the east and Fakenham in the west, as well as Norwich itself.

===Rail===
The nearest station is Norwich railway station, approximately away.

<text>The Benz Velo was one of the first cars, introduced by Carl Benz in 1894 as the followup to the Patent-Motorwagen. 67 Benz Velos were built in 1894 and 134 in 1895. The early Velo had a 1L engine, and later a engine giving a top speed of . The Velo was officially introduced by Karl Benz as the Velocipede, and became the world&#x27;s first standardized serial production car. The Velocipede remained in production between 1894 and 1902, with a final count of over 1,200 produced.

==Preceding events and history==
Carl Benz patented the world&#x27;s first stationary, static Internal combustion engine. His patent created a great demand for his vehicles, forcing Benz to move his operations in 1886 to a new factory on Waldhofstrasse in Mannheim (operating until 1908). Benz had appointed a Board of Management to help aid his growing company. The appointees suggested to Benz that he should create a less-expensive automobile suitable for mass production. In response, Benz engineered a two-passenger automobile with a engine, which he called the Victoria. That model could reach a top speed of , and utilized a pivotal front-axle operated by a roller-chained tiller for steering. 85 units of the Victoria were produced. Improving on those designs, Benz created his Benz Velo. In 1898, a development of the Velo was produced, called the Ideal.

==Influences==

===Following automobiles===
The Velo also inspired numerous copies, including Marshall (later Belsize) in Manchester, Star (Wolverhampton), and Arnold (Paddock Wood, of which only twelve were built).
Benz&#x27;s Velo was particularly popular in France, where a Parisian bicycle manufacturer by the name of Émile Roger had been building Benz engines under license from Karl Benz. Roger began building Benz automobiles as well, and as a result, a majority of Benz automobiles were sold in France initially.
Many British Inventors also used Benz&#x27;s patents and automobiles as starting points for their own innovations. Frederick W. Lanchester, of Birmingham, built a four-wheeled petrol-driven automobile, similar to units previously designed by Benz, which had utilized an electric starter (an adaption first seen in the Benz Velo).

A Velo was the first car introduced to South Africa, where it was demonstrated to then President Paul Kruger on 4 January 1897.

===The first automobile race===
Karl Benz&#x27;s Velo participated in the world&#x27;s first automobile race. A Parisian daily newspaper, by the name of &quot;Le Petit Journal&quot;, organized the race. The editors of &quot;Le Petit&quot; intended to display horseless carriages as a viable means of transportation. Rather than fastest time, the automobiles would be judged on whether they were safe and cost effective to operate. It took place in 1894, starting in Paris and ending in Rouen. The winners of the Paris-Rouen race were Panhard &amp; Levassor (Panhard) and Peugeot, both French manufacturers using Benz internal combustion engines. The Velo placed fifth overall in Le Petit&#x27;s race. Benz had proven with this race that his engines and his automobiles were not only attainable but also safe and reliable to operate. Eventually, manufacturers began optimizing automobile design for racing. In addition to promoting Benz and his automobiles, the Paris-Rouen race gave birth to modern Motorsport, which now includes the likes of Formula One.

<text>U.S. Highway 151 (US 151) is a United States Numbered Highway that runs through the states of Iowa and Wisconsin. The southern terminus for US 151 is at a junction with Interstate 80 (I-80) in Iowa County, Iowa, and its northern terminus is at Manitowoc, Wisconsin. The route, from south to north follows a northeasterly path through the two states.

US 151 is an important corridor which connects Cedar Rapids, Iowa to Fond du Lac, Wisconsin with an expressway (except for a segment about ten miles where it uses arterial roads instead in Madison, Wisconsin).

Approximately south of Dubuque, Iowa, US 151 joins with US 61. The two highways share a route from there to Dickeyville, Wisconsin. south of Dubuque, US 61/US 151 joins with US 52 and shares a route with US 52 until it veers south in Key West.

In Wisconsin, US 61/US 151 joins with Wisconsin Highway 35 (WIS 35) about north of the Iowa–Wisconsin border. At Dickeyville, US 151 splits off and heads northeast to Platteville. US 61/WIS 35 continues north. US 151 later joins with US 18 near Dodgeville. The two highways share a route all the way to Madison.

==Route description==
===Iowa===

US 151 begins at exit 225 along I-80 in rural Iowa County north of Williamsburg. The highway heads to the north and intersects US 6 outside of Homestead, Iowa. US 151 turns east onto US 6 and the two routes run concurrently for about until US 6 splits to the east at Homestead. US 151 continues to the north and crosses the Iowa River on its way to Amana, the main village of the Amana Colonies and the eastern end of Iowa Highway 220 (Iowa 220). The road clips the southeastern corner of Benton County, Iowa at Walford and it turns to the northeast toward Fairfax. When it reaches the US 30 / US 218 freeway in Cedar Rapids, US 151 turns east onto the highway while US 151 Business continues northeast on Williams Boulevard SW. The freeway is dotted with interchanges providing access to southern Cedar Rapids, most importantly Edgewood Road SW, I-380, and C Street SW. Just east of the Cedar River, US 151 exits from US 30, which continues east toward Clinton.
The route splits from the other roads and continues toward Dubuque as an expressway. This stretch crosses many major rivers including both the Wapsipinicon and the Maquoketa. The road eventually goes into the Driftless Area where it meets up with US 61 around the Dubuque Regional Airport. US 52 briefly joins the two routes, concurrently, for two miles south of Dubuque. The combined road then heads into the state of Wisconsin.

===Dubuque to Madison===
US 61/US 151 crosses the Mississippi River into Wisconsin via the Dubuque-Wisconsin Bridge from Dubuque, Iowa and passes through a cut in the river ridge before turning northward to the western terminus of WIS 11 after of due east travel. WIS 35 and the Great River Road join the route at that interchange, heading north. The highway at this point is limited access highway with two lanes in each direction. The northward trek of the route passes through mixed residential and farmland as it crosses Badger Road and merges with Eagle Point Road. Eagle Point road merges with US 151 from the left side of the road. The limited access portion ends at this interchange. Another pair of half diamond interchanges connect the highway with County Trunk Highway HHH (CTH-HHH) and CTH-H as it bypasses Kieler to the northwest. At Dickeyville, US 61, WIS 35 and the Great River Road route exit north off of US 151 into town. US 151 passes Dickeyville to the east and descends into a valley cut northeast of the village, paralleling the Little Platte River and Blockhouse Creek within the valley for a stretch before climbing back onto the ridge top on the other side of the valley. US 151 then approaches Platteville and enters a section of limited access at CTH-D (US 151 Business). The limited access stretch ends after three interchanges to the east. The last of the interchanges is WIS 126/CTH-G with access to Belmont. The route turns northeastward from this point, crosses the Cottage Inn Branch and begins the first of several descents into valleys, two of which are prior to passing Mineral Point and another two while passing the city.

The highway is limited access between the two interchanges that provide access to Mineral Point: CTH-O and WIS 23. WIS 23 joins US 151 heading northbound at that point until the first interchange at Dodgeville. This interchange begins another short stretch of freeway to the point where US 18 joins the route. US 18/US 151 heads eastbound past that interchange.

The section of expressway past Dodgeville passes Ridgeway and Barneveld. Access to Ridgeway is by an interchange and a surface intersection with a short business route on CTH-HHH. The interchange was previously an intersection; however, it was announced in 2011 that the first intersection would be closed, and an exit would be constructed, due to the numerous fatal accidents that happen at the intersection each year. Access to Barneveld is at an interchange with CTH-ID and an at-grade intersection with CTH-K. CTH-ID parallels US 18/US 151 for the entire stretch between Barneveld and Mount Horeb. A section of freeway begins at WIS 78 and ends at the other end of CTH-ID as the highway bypasses Mount Horeb just to the south of the city&#x27;s passing residential subdivisions. A mix of grade separation and level intersections cross the winding highway as it continues eastward until the interchange with CTH-MV (Verona Avenue) begins a section of freeway that bypasses Verona to the south. This section provides access to four interchanges including the two endpoints of CTH-MV. The freeway continues into Fitchburg and provides access to two interchanges at CTH-PD (McKee Road) and Williamsburg Way. The freeway then ends. The road continues as an urban multilane highway known as Verona Road as it enters Madison. Verona Road passes through a residential and commercial area on the Southwest Side of Madison. US 18 and US 151 merge east on the West Beltline Highway—joining US 12 and US 14.

===Madison metropolitan area===
The four US Highways run concurrently for about to Park Street. At this interchange, US 14 turns south off the beltline towards Oregon, and US 151 turns north and into central Madison on South Park Street. It crosses the same railroad corridor and passes Monona Bay to the west along South Park Street. US 151 turns northeast onto West Washington Avenue for about then follows Proudfit Street and North Shore Drive—paralleling the Monona Bay shore—and turns north onto John Nolen Drive. The street passes under the Monona Terrace Convention Center as it passes to the south and east of downtown Madison. US 151 turns northwest onto South Blair Street for three city blocks to East Washington Avenue—where it turns northeast and follows East Washington Avenue, bisecting the Madison Isthmus, and leading out of the city to the east. The western terminus of WIS 30 meets US 151 about northeast of the South Blair Street turn, and US 51 crosses US 151 further northeast.

===Madison to Fond du Lac===

At a cloverleaf interchange with I-39/I-90/I-94, a section of freeway begins and continues along US 151 northeast through commercial zones into residential areas. A highway bypass was constructed north and west of Sun Prairie, but so much commercial and residential development subsequently happened to the north and west of the bypass that the route essentially divides Sun Prairie in half. The route now has four interchanges with highways and streets in Sun Prairie. After Sun Prairie, US 151 passes through farmland, heading toward Columbus. The highway bypasses the city via a partial beltline to the north and east, completely clearing the city. WIS 16 and WIS 60 crosses under US 151 about midway along the Columbus bypass. US 151 becomes an expressway with level intersections after the interchange with WIS 73 at the end of the bypass portion. The route becomes a freeway at Beaver Dam, bypassing the city to the southeast. The route follows the edge of residential zones of the city before passing an industrial area at the northeastern end of the bypass. US 151 crosses at-grade intersections after the interchange with CTH-A northeast of Beaver Dam and encounters one more freeway section at Waupun, bypassing the city to the east. The four-lane expressway of US 151 continues east, bypassing Fond du Lac to the south and east. This expressway provides a mixture of at-grade intersections and grade-separated interchanges at I-41/US&amp; 41 and WIS 23. WisDOT currently is studying changes to two sections of US 151. The first study would preserve the Fond du Lac Bypass from I-41 to WIS 23, with the ultimate goal being freeway conversion. The second study is examining freeway conversions to the route from WIS 73 in Columbus to WIS 49 in Waupun.

===Fond du Lac to Manitowoc===

The multi-lane section of US 151 ends after turning north away from Fond du Lac and the route follows the east shore of Lake Winnebago for about half the length of the shoreline. US 151 then turns east at the intersection with WIS 55 and follows two-lane surface roads and briefly running concurrently with WIS 32 and WIS 57 in Chilton. The roadway passes through farmland throughout this section until it picks up WIS 42 just outside of Manitowoc and ends at I-43 while WIS 42 continues east into Manitowoc.

==History==
US 151 was one of the original U.S. Highways from 1926. At the time, it only ran from Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, to Madison. In 1934, the highway was extended southwest to Cedar Rapids, Iowa, incorporating the full length of former U.S. Highway 118 (Dodgeville to Dickeyville) and part of former U.S. Highway 161 (Dubuque to Cedar Rapids; US 161 from Cedar Rapids south to Keokuk became US 218). At the time, the southern end of the route was at Williams Blvd SW and 16th Ave SW, what was then US 30 and US 218. In the 1940s, the highway was extended northeast to Manitowoc.

===Illinois===

In 1969, the Eagle Point Bridge, which connected US 151 and US 61 with Wisconsin, was closed, and those highways were rerouted over the Julien Dubuque Bridge with US 20 from Dubuque to East Dubuque, Illinois. The route then followed Illinois Route 35 and WIS 35 north to what is now the current highway. In 1982, the Dubuque-Wisconsin Bridge opened, the old Eagle Point Bridge was demolished, and US 151 and US 61 were rerouted onto the new bridge. This is the only instance of US 61 and US 151 entering Illinois.

===Routings===
In 1981, the southern terminus of the highway was extended once again when the US 30 bypass was built. The southern terminus was at the US 151 and 30 interchange. By 1986, the main US 151 was rerouted onto state highway 13 and US 30 to bypass Cedar Rapids. The previous route through Cedar Rapids was renamed US 151 Business (though the official state designation for it is Iowa 922). Finally, in 1989, US 151 was extended to its current southern end at exit 225 along I-80. This extension followed the old route of Iowa 149. As a result, US 151 became the main route through the Amana Colonies.

US 151&#x27;s northern terminus was changed in 2022 to end at I-43 instead of in downtown Manitowoc where WIS 42 traveled through before being rerouted onto I-43 in 1980.

<text>Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn Jābir ibn Sinān al-Raqqī al-Ḥarrānī aṣ-Ṣābiʾ al-Battānī (), usually called al-Battānī, a name that was in the past Latinized as Albategnius, (before 858929) was an astronomer, astrologer, geographer and mathematician, who lived and worked for most of his life at Raqqa, now in Syria. He is considered to be the greatest and most famous of the astronomers of the medieval Islamic world.

Al-Battānī&#x27;s writings became instrumental in the development of science and astronomy in the west. His (), is the earliest extant (astronomical table) made in the Ptolemaic tradition that is hardly influenced by Hindu or Sasanian astronomy. Al-Battānī refined and corrected Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;, but also included new ideas and astronomical tables of his own. A handwritten Latin version by the Italian astronomer Plato Tiburtinus was produced between 1134 and 1138, through which medieval astronomers became familiar with al-Battānī. In 1537, a Latin translation of the was printed in Nuremberg. An annotated version, also in Latin, published in three separate volumes between 1899 and 1907 by the Italian Orientalist Carlo Alfonso Nallino, provided the foundation of the modern study of medieval Islamic astronomy.

Al-Battānī&#x27;s observations of the Sun led him to understand the nature of annular solar eclipses. He accurately calculated the Earth&#x27;s obliquity (the angle between the planes of the equator and the ecliptic), the solar year, and the equinoxes (obtaining a value for the precession of the equinoxes of one degree in 66 years). The accuracy of his data encouraged Nicolaus Copernicus to pursue ideas about the heliocentric nature of the cosmos. Al-Battānī&#x27;s tables were used by the German mathematician Christopher Clavius in reforming the Julian calendar, and the astronomers Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, Galileo Galilei and Edmund Halley all used Al-Battānī&#x27;s observations.

Al-Battānī introduced the use of sines and tangents in geometrical calculations, replacing the geometrical methods of the Greeks. Using trigonometry, he created an equation for finding the (the direction which Muslims need to face during their prayers). His equation was widely used until superseded by more accurate methods, introduced a century later by the polymath al-Biruni.

==Life==
Al-Battānī, whose full name was , and whose Latinized name was , was born before 858 in Harran in Bilād ash-Shām (Islamic Syria), southeast of the modern Turkish city of Urfa. He was the son of Jabir ibn Sinan al-Harrani, a maker of astronomical instruments. The epithet suggests that his family belonged to the pagan Sabian sect of Harran, whose religion featured star worship, and who had inherited the Mesopotamian legacy of an interest in mathematics and astronomy. His contemporary, the polymath Thābit ibn Qurra, was also an adherent of Sabianism, which died out during the 11th century.
Although his ancestors were likely Sabians, al-Battānī was a Muslim, as shown by his first name. Between 877 and 918/19 he lived in Raqqa, now in north central Syria, which was an ancient Roman settlement beside the Euphrates, near Harran. During this period he also lived in Antioch, where he observed a solar and a lunar eclipse in 901. According to the Arab biographer Ibn al-Nadīm, the financial problems encountered by al-Battānī in old age forced him to move from Raqqa to Baghdad.

Al-Battānī died in 929 at Qasr al-Jiss, near Samarra, after returning from Baghdad where he had resolved an unfair taxation grievance on behalf of a clan from Raqqa.

==Astronomy==
Al-Battānī is considered to be the greatest and most famous of the known astronomers of the medieval Islamic world. He made more accurate observations of the night sky than any of his contemporaries, and was the first of a generation of new Islamic astronomers that followed the founding of the House of Wisdom in the 8th century. His meticulously described methods allowed others to assess his results, but some of his explanations about the movements of the planets were poorly written, and have mistakes.

Sometimes referred to as the &quot;Ptolemy of the Arabs&quot;, al-Battānī&#x27;s works reveal him to have been a devout believer in Ptolemy&#x27;s geocentric model of the cosmos. He refined the observations found in Ptolemy&#x27;s , and compiled new tables of the Sun and the Moon, previously long accepted as authoritative. Al-Battānī established his own observatory at Raqqa. He recommended that the astronomical instruments there were greater than in size. Such instruments, being larger—and so having scales capable of measuring smaller values—were capable of greater precision than had previously been achieved. Some of his measurements were more accurate than those taken by the Polish astronomer and mathematician Nicolaus Copernicus during the Renaissance. One reason for this is thought to be that al-Battānī&#x27;s location for his observations at Raqqa was closer to the Earth&#x27;s equator, so that the ecliptic and the Sun, being higher in the sky, were less susceptible to atmospheric refraction. The careful construction and alignment of his astronomical instruments enabled him to achieve an accuracy of observations of equinoxes and solstices that had previously been unknown.
Al-Battānī was one of the first astronomers to observe that the distance between the Earth and the Sun varies during the year, which led him to understand the reason why annular solar eclipses occur. He saw that the position in the sky at which the angular diameter of the Sun appeared smallest was no longer located where Ptolemy had stated it should be, and that since Ptolemy&#x27;s time, the longitudinal position of the apogee had increased by 16°47&#x27;.

Al-Battānī was an excellent observer. He improved Ptolemy&#x27;s measurement of the obliquity of the ecliptic (the angle between the planes of the equator and the ecliptic), producing a value of 23° 35&#x27;; the accepted value is around 23°.44. Al-Battānī obtained the criterion for observation of the lunar crescent—i.e., if the longitude difference between the Moon and the Sun is greater than 13° 66˝ and the Moon&#x27;s delay after sunset is more than 43.2 minutes, the crescent will be visible. His value for the solar year of 365 days, 5 hours, 46 minutes and 24 seconds, is 2 minutes and 22 seconds from the accepted value.

Al-Battānī observed changes in the direction of the Sun&#x27;s apogee, as recorded by Ptolemy, and that as a result, the equation of time was subject to a slow cyclical variation. His careful measurements of when the March and September equinoxes took place allowed him to obtain a value for the precession of the equinoxes of 54.5&quot; per year, or 1 degree in 66 years, a phenomenon that he realised was altering the Sun&#x27;s annual apparent motion through the zodiac constellations.
It was impossible for al-Battānī, who adhered to the ideas of a stationary Earth and geocentricism, to understand the underlying scientific reasons for his observations or the importance of his discoveries.

==Mathematics==
One of al-Battani&#x27;s greatest contributions was his introduction of the use of sines and tangents in geometrical calculations, especially spherical trigonometric functions, to replace Ptolemy&#x27;s geometrical methods. Al-Battānī&#x27;s methods involved some of the most complex mathematics developed up to that time. He was aware of the superiority of trigonometry over geometrical chords, and demonstrated awareness of a relation between the sides and angles of a spherical triangle, now given by the expression:

::formula_1

Al-Battānī produced a number of trigonometrical relationships:

::formula_2

::formula_3, where formula_4.

He also solved the equation 
::formula_5,

discovering the formula 
::formula_6

Al-Battānī used the Iranian astronomer Habash al-Hasib al-Marwazi&#x27;s idea of tangents to develop equations for calculating and compiling tables of both tangents and cotangents. He discovered their reciprocal functions, the secant and cosecant, and produced the first table of cosecants for each degree from 1° to 90°, which he referred to as a &quot;table of shadows&quot;, in reference to the shadow produced on a sundial.
Using these trigonometrical relationships, al-Battānī created an equation for finding the , which Muslims face in each of the five prayers they practice every day. The equation he created did not give accurate directions, as it did not take into account the fact that Earth is a sphere. The relationship he used was precise enough only for a person located in (or close to) Mecca, but was still a widely used method at the time. Al-Battānī&#x27;s equation for formula_7, the angle of the direction of a place towards Mecca is given by:

formula_8

where formula_9 is the difference between the longitude of the place and Mecca, and formula_10 is the difference between the latitude of the place and Mecca.

Al-Battānī&#x27;s equation was superseded a century after it was first used, when the polymath al-Biruni summarized several other methods to produce results that were more accurate than those that could be obtained using al-Battānī&#x27;s equation.

A small work on trigonometry, (&quot;Summary of the principles for establishing sines&quot;) is known. Once attributed to the Iranian astronomer Kushyar Gilani by the German orientalist Carl Brockelmann, it is a fragment of al-Battānī&#x27;s . The manuscript is extant in Istanbul as MS Carullah 1499/3. The authenticity of this work has been questioned, as scholars believe al-Battānī would have not have included for &quot;sines&quot; in the title.

== Works ==
Al-Battānī&#x27;s ( or , &quot;Book of Astronomical Tables&quot;), written in around 900, and also known as the  (), is the earliest extant  made in the Ptolemaic tradition that is hardly influenced by Hindu or Sasanian–Iranian astronomy. It corrected mistakes made by Ptolemy and described instruments such as horizontal and vertical sundials, the triquetrum, the mural instrument, and a quadrant instrument. Ibn al-Nadim wrote that al-Battānī&#x27;s existed in two different editions, &quot;the second being better than the first&quot;. In the west, the work was sometimes called the &quot;Sabean Tables&quot;.

The work, consisting of 57 chapters and additional tables, is extant (in the manuscript árabe 908, held in El Escorial), copied in Al-Andalus during the 12th or 13th century. Incomplete copies exist in other western European libraries. Much of the book consists of instructions for using the attached tables. Al-Battānī used an Arabic translation of the &quot;Almagest&quot; made from Syriac, and used few foreign terms. He copied some data directly from Ptolemy&#x27;s Handy Tables, but also produced his own. His star table of 880 used around half the stars found in the then 743-year-old &quot;Almagest&quot;. It was made by increasing Ptolemy&#x27;s stellar longitudes, to allow for the different positions of the stars, now known to be caused by precession.

Other based on  include those written by Kushyar Gilani, Alī ibn Ahmad al-Nasawī, Abū Rashīd Dāneshī, and Ibn al-Kammad.

The first version in Latin from the Arabic was made by the English astronomer Robert of Ketton; this version is now lost. A Latin edition was also produced by the Italian astronomer Plato Tiburtinus between 1134 and 1138. Medieval astronomers became quite familiar with al-Battānī through this translation, renamed (&quot;On stellar motion&quot;). It was also translated from Arabic into Spanish during the 13th century, under the orders of Alphonso X of Castile; a part of the manuscript is extant.

The  appears to have been widely used until the early 12th century. One 11th-century , now lost, was compiled by al-Nasawī. That it was based on al-Battānī can be inferred from the matching values for the longitudes of the solar and planetary apogees. Al-Nasawī had as a young man written astronomical tables using data obtained from al-Battānī&#x27;s , but then discovered the data he used had been superseded by more accurately made calculations.
The invention of movable type in 1436 made it possible for astronomical works to be circulated more widely, and a Latin translation of the was printed in Nuremberg in 1537 by the astronomer Regiomontanus, which enabled Al-Battānī&#x27;s observations to become accessible at the start of the scientific revolution in astronomy. The was reprinted in Bologna in 1645; the original document is preserved at the Vatican Library in Rome.

The Latin translations, including the printed edition of 1537, made the influential in the development of European astronomy. A chapter of the also appeared as a separate work, (&quot;On the accurate determination of the quantities of conjunctions [according to the latitudes of the planets]&quot;).

Al-Battānī&#x27;s work was published in three volumes, in 1899, 1903, and 1907, by the Italian Orientalist Carlo Alfonso Nallino, who gave it the title . Nallino&#x27;s edition, although in Latin, is the foundation of the modern study of medieval Islamic astronomy.
 (, “The book of the science of the ascensions of the signs of the zodiac in the spaces between the quadrants of the celestial sphere”) may have been about calculations relating to the zodiac. The work is mentioned in a work by Ibn al-Nadim, and is probably identical with chapter 55 of al-Battānī&#x27;s . It provided methods of calculation needed in the astrological problem of finding (directio).

===Other works===
*  (&quot;On the astrological indications of conjunctions and eclipses&quot;) is a treatise on horoscopes and astrology in connection with conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter that occurred during the earliest period of Islam. The extant manuscript is held in the İsmail Saib Library at Ankara University.
* (, &quot;Commentary on Ptolemy&#x27;s Tetrabiblos&quot;) is a commentary on the  in the version of Abu as-Salt. Al-Battānī mentions two earlier treatises that are likely identical to two chapters of the . It is extant in the manuscripts Berlin Spr. 1840 (Ahlwardt #5875) and Escorial árabe 969/2.
* (, &quot;Four discourses&quot;) was a commentary on Ptolemy&#x27;s , known as the . The 10th-century encyclopedist Ibn Nadim in his , lists al-Battānī among a number of authors of commentaries on this work. 
* (, &quot;Knowledge of the rising-places of the zodiacal signs&quot;).

== Legacy ==
===Medieval period===
The  was renowned by medieval Islamic astronomers; the Arab polymath al-Bīrūnī wrote  (&quot;Elucidation of genius in al-Battānī&#x27;s Zīj&quot;), now lost.

Al-Battānī&#x27;s work was instrumental in the development of science and astronomy in the west. Once it became known, it was used by medieval European astronomers and during the Renaissance. He influenced Jewish rabbis and philosophers such as Abraham ibn Ezra and Gersonides. The 12th-century scholar Moses Maimonides, the intellectual leader of medieval Judaism, closely followed al-Battānī. Hebrew editions of the  were produced by the 12th-century Catalan astronomer Abraham bar Hiyya and the 14th-century French mathematician Immanuel Bonfils.

Copernicus referred to &quot;al-Battani the Harranite&quot; when discussing the orbits of Mercury and Venus. He compared to his own value for the sidereal year with those obtained by al-Battānī, Ptolemy and a value he attributed to the 9th-century scholar Thabit ibn Qurra. The accuracy of al-Battānī&#x27;s observations encouraged Copernicus to pursue his ideas about the heliocentric nature of the cosmos, and in the book that initiated the Copernican Revolution, the , al-Battānī is mentioned 23 times.

===16th and 17th centuries===
Al-Battānī&#x27;s tables were used by the German mathematician Christopher Clavius in reforming the Julian calendar, leading to it being replaced by the Gregorian calendar in 1582. The astronomers Tycho Brahe, Giovanni Battista Riccioli, Johannes Kepler and Galileo Galilei cited Al-Battānī or his observations. His almost exactly correct value obtained for the Sun&#x27;s eccentricity is better than the values determined by both Copernicus and Brahe.

The lunar crater Albategnius was named in his honour during the 17th century. Like many of the craters on the Moon&#x27;s near side, it was given its name by Riccioli, whose 1651 nomenclature system has become standardized.

In the 1690s, the English physicist and astronomer Edmund Halley, using Plato Tiburtius&#x27;s translation of al-Battānī&#x27;s , discovered that the Moon&#x27;s speed was possibly increasing. Halley researched the location of Raqqa, where al-Battānī&#x27;s observatory had been built, using the astronomer&#x27;s calculations for the solar obliquity, the interval between successive autumnal equinoxes and several solar and lunar eclipses seen from Raqqa and Antioch. From this information, Halley derived the mean motion and position of the Moon for the years 881, 882, 883, 891, and 901. To interpret his results, Halley was dependent upon on knowing the location of Raqqa, which he was able to do once he had corrected the accepted value for the latitude of Aleppo.

===18th century – present===
Al-Battānī&#x27;s observations of eclipses were used by the English astronomer Richard Dunthorne to determine a value for the increasing speed of the Moon in its orbit, he calculated that the lunar longitude was changing at a rate of 10 arcseconds per century.

Al-Battānī&#x27;s data is still used by geophysicists.

<text>Schindleria is a genus of marine fish. It was the only genus of family Schindleriidae, among the Gobioidei of order Perciformes but is now classified under the Gobiidae in the Gobiiformes. The type species is &quot;S. praematura&quot;, Schindler&#x27;s fish. The &quot;Schindleria&quot; species are known generically as Schindler&#x27;s fishes after German zoologist Otto Schindler (1906–1959), or infantfishes. They are native to the southern Pacific Ocean, from the South China Sea to the Great Barrier Reef off eastern Australia, and Rapa Nui.

== Description ==
The infant fishes are so called because they retain many of their larval characteristics (an example of neoteny). Their elongated bodies are transparent, and many of the bones never develop. &quot;S. praematura&quot; reaches a length of . All of the &quot;Schindleria&quot; species are reef fishes. They may be among the most common fish of the reefs, based on the results of plankton tows, but because of their transparency and small size, they are infrequently seen in life.

A recently described species, the stout infantfish, &quot;S. brevipinguis&quot;, was briefly the world&#x27;s smallest known vertebrate at 8 mm (about one-third inch), smaller even than the dwarf gobies, until the new record was set by the 7.9-mm &quot;Paedocypris progenetica&quot; in early 2006 and supplanted by the 7.7-mm frog &quot;Paedophryne amauensis&quot; in 2012.

Apparently several (at least eight) further &quot;Schindleria&quot; species, native to the Ryukyu Islands, are yet to be described formally.

== Species ==
&quot;Schindleria&quot; contains the following species:
* &quot;Schindleria brevipinguis&quot; (Stout infantfish) 
* &quot;Schindleria edentata&quot; 
* &quot;Schindleria elongata&quot; (Elongate paedomorphic goby) 
* &quot;Schindleria macrodentata&quot; (Schindler&#x27;s largetooth goby)
* &quot;Schindleria multidentata&quot; 
* &quot;Schindleria nigropunctata&quot; (Blackspotted paedomorphic goby)
* &quot;Schindleria parva&quot; 
* &quot;Schindleria pietschmanni&quot; (Pietschmann&#x27;s floater)
* &quot;Schindleria praematura&quot; (Schindler&#x27;s fish) 
* &quot;Schindleria qizma&quot; 
* &quot;Schindleria squirei&quot;

<text>The Coast Guard Bicentennial Unit Commendation was a unit award of the United States Coast Guard which was awarded to all active, reserve, auxiliary, and civilian personnel of the Coast Guard for service from March 1989 to October 1989.

The award was issued only to those whose service up to the issuance date was honorable and it could be issued to members of other services who were assigned to the Coast Guard and served in that period.

Wearing of the ribbon was stipulated to be placed after the Air and Space Organizational Excellence Award and before the Prisoner of War Medal.

==One-time award==
Established by Commandant of the Coast Guard Admiral Paul A. Yost, Jr. on 2 January 2 1990. The award was issued as a one-time award only that commemorated the founding of the U.S. Coast Guard in 1790, then known as the Revenue Cutter Service. The Coast Guard Bicentennial Unit Commendation was discontinued for issuance in September 1991, but Coast Guard regulations permit the continued wearing of the decoration on the uniforms of Coast Guard members who have earned it.

<text>Otto Yulyevich Shmidt (born Otto Friedrich Julius Schmidt; – 7 September 1956), better known as Otto Schmidt, was a Soviet scientist, mathematician, astronomer, geophysicist, statesman, and academician.

==Biography==
He was born in the town of Mogilev in the Russian Empire, in what is now Belarus. His father was a descendant of German settlers in Courland, while his mother was a Latvian. In 1912–13 while in university he published a number of mathematical works on group theory which laid foundation for Krull–Schmidt theorem.
In 1913, Schmidt married Vera Yanitskaia and graduated from the Saint Vladimir Imperial University of Kiev, where he worked as a privat-docent starting from 1916. In 1918 he became a member of the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party (internationallists) which was later dissolved in to the Russian Communist Party. After the October Revolution of 1917, he was a board member at several People&#x27;s Commissariats (narkomats)such as Narkomprod from 1918 to 1920 (&quot;Narodnyi Komissariat Prodovolstviya&quot;, or People&#x27;s Commissariat for Supplies), People&#x27;s Commissariat for Finance from 1921 to 1922 (&quot;Narodnyi Komissariat Finansov&quot;, or People&#x27;s Commissariat for Finances). Schmidt was one of the chief proponents of developing the higher education system, publishing, and science in Soviet Russia.

He worked at &quot;Narkompros&quot; (People&#x27;s Commissariat for Education), the State Scientific Board at the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the USSR, and the Communist Academy. He was Chair of the Foreign Literature Committee from October 1921. Following the Litkens Commission Schmidt was also employed as the director of the State Publishing House (Gosizdat) from 1921 to 1924, and chief editor of the &quot;Great Soviet Encyclopedia&quot; from 1924 to 1941. From 1923 he was a professor at the Second Moscow State University and later at the Moscow State University, and from 1930 to 1932, Schmidt was the head of the Arctic Institute. During this time he coined the term for the double bond rule.

From 1932 to 1939, he was appointed head of Glavsevmorput&#x27; (&quot;Glavnoe upravlenie Severnogo Morskogo Puti&quot;) – an establishment that oversaw all commercial operations on the Northern Sea Route. From 1939 to 1942, Schmidt became a vice-president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, where he organized the Institute of Theoretical Geophysics (he was its director until 1949). Otto Schmidt was a founder of the Moscow Algebra School, which he directed for many years.

In the mid-1940s, Schmidt suggested a new cosmogonical hypothesis on the formation of the Earth and other planets of the Solar System, which he continued to develop together with a group of Soviet scientists until his death.

===Arctic===
Schmidt was an explorer of the Arctic. In 1929 and 1930, he led expeditions on the steam icebreaker &quot;Georgy Sedov&quot;, establishing the first scientific research station on the Franz Josef Land, exploring the northwestern parts of the Kara Sea and western coasts of Severnaya Zemlya, and discovering a few islands.

In 1932, Schmidt&#x27;s expedition on the steam icebreaker &quot;Sibiryakov&quot; with Captain Vladimir Voronin made a non-stop voyage from Arkhangelsk to the Pacific Ocean without wintering for the first time in history.

From 1933 to 1934, Schmidt led the voyage of the steamship &quot;Cheliuskin&quot;, also with Captain Vladimir Voronin, along the Northern Sea Route. In 1937, he supervised an expedition that established a drift-ice station &quot;North Pole-1&quot;. In 1938, he was in charge of evacuating its personnel from the ice.

Otto Schmidt was a member of the Central Executive Committee of the USSR and a deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR of the first convocation (1938–1946).

==Legacy==

The authorities awarded Otto Schmidt three Orders of Lenin, three other orders and many medals. Schmidt Island in the Kara Sea, Cape Schmidt on the coastline of the Chukchi Sea in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug, as well as the Institute of Earth Physics at the Soviet Academy of Sciences, among other places, bear Schmidt&#x27;s name.

A minor planet, 2108 Otto Schmidtdiscovered in 1948 by Soviet astronomer Pelageya Shajncommemorates him.

The Soviet research vessel &quot;Otto Schmidt&quot; was named after him in 1979.

<text>In cognitive psychology and neuroscience, spatial memory is a form of memory responsible for the recording and recovery of information needed to plan a course to a location and to recall the location of an object or the occurrence of an event. Spatial memory is necessary for orientation in space. Spatial memory can also be divided into egocentric and allocentric spatial memory. A person&#x27;s spatial memory is required to navigate in a familiar city. A rat&#x27;s spatial memory is needed to learn the location of food at the end of a maze. In both humans and animals, spatial memories are summarized as a cognitive map.

Spatial memory has representations within working, short-term memory and long-term memory. Research indicates that there are specific areas of the brain associated with spatial memory. Many methods are used for measuring spatial memory in children, adults, and animals.

== Short-term spatial memory ==
Short-term memory (STM) can be described as a system allowing one to temporarily store and manage information that is necessary to complete complex cognitive tasks. Tasks which employ short-term memory include learning, reasoning, and comprehension. Spatial memory is a cognitive process that enables a person to remember different locations as well as spatial relations between objects. This allows one to remember where an object is in relation to another object; for instance, allowing someone to navigate in a familiar city. Spatial memories are said to form after a person has already gathered and processed sensory information about her or his environment.

== Spatial working memory ==
Working memory (WM) can be described as a limited capacity system that allows one to temporarily store and process information. This temporary store enables one to complete or work on complex tasks while being able to keep information in mind. For instance, the ability to work on a complicated mathematical problem utilizes one&#x27;s working memory.

One influential theory of WM is the Baddeley and Hitch multi-component model of working memory. The most recent version of this model suggests that there are four subcomponents to WM: phonological loop, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, the central executive, and the episodic buffer. One component of this model, the visuo-spatial sketchpad, is likely responsible for the temporary storage, maintenance, and manipulation of both visual and spatial information.
In contrast to the multi-component model, some researchers believe that STM should be viewed as a unitary construct. In this respect, visual, spatial, and verbal information are thought to be organized by levels of representation rather than the type of store to which they belong. Within the literature, it is suggested that further research into the fractionation of STM and WM be explored. However, much of the research into the visuo-spatial memory construct have been conducted in accordance to the paradigm advanced by Baddeley and Hitch.

===The role of the central executive===
Research into the exact function of the visuo-spatial sketchpad has indicated that both spatial short-term memory and working memory are dependent on executive resources and are not entirely distinct. For instance, performance on a working memory but not on a short-term memory task was affected by articulatory suppression suggesting that impairment on the spatial task was caused by the concurrent performance on a task that had extensive use of executive resources. Results have also found that performances were impaired on STM and WM tasks with executive suppression. This illustrates how, within the visuo-spatial domain, both STM and WM require similar utility of the central executive.
Additionally, during a spatial visualisation task (which is related to executive functioning and not STM or WM) concurrent executive suppression impaired performance indicating that the effects were due to common demands on the central executive and not short-term storage. The researchers concluded with the explanation that the central executive employs cognitive strategies enabling participants to both encode and maintain mental representations during short-term memory tasks.

Although studies suggest that the central executive is intimately involved in a number of spatial tasks, the exact way in which they are connected remains to be seen.

==Long-term spatial memory==
Spatial memory recall is built upon a hierarchical structure. People remember the general layout of a particular space and then &quot;cue target locations&quot; within that spatial set. This paradigm includes an ordinal scale of features that an individual must attend to in order to inform his or her cognitive map. Recollection of spatial details is a top-down procedure that requires an individual to recall the superordinate features of a cognitive map, followed by the ordinate and subordinate features. Two spatial features are prominent in navigating a path: general layout and landmark orienting (Kahana et al., 2006). People are not only capable of learning about the spatial layout of their surroundings, but they can also piece together novel routes and new spatial relations through inference.

A cognitive map is &quot;a mental model of objects&#x27; spatial configuration that permits navigation along optimal path between arbitrary pairs of points.&quot; This mental map is built upon two fundamental bedrocks: layout, also known as route knowledge, and landmark orientation. Layout is potentially the first method of navigation that people learn to utilize; its workings reflect our most basic understandings of the world.

Hermer and Spelke (1994) determined that when toddlers begin to walk, around eighteen months, they navigate by their sense of the world&#x27;s layout. McNamara, Hardy and Hirtle identified region membership as a major building block of anyone&#x27;s cognitive map (1989). Specifically, region membership is defined by any kind of boundary, whether physical, perceptual or subjective (McNamara et al., 1989). Boundaries are among the most basic and endemic qualities in the world around us. These boundaries are nothing more than axial lines which are a feature that people are biased towards when relating to space; for example, one axial line determinant is gravity (McNamara &amp; Shelton, 2001; Kim &amp; Penn, 2004). Axial lines aid everyone in apportioning our perceptions into regions. This parceled world idea is further supported by the finding that items that get recalled together are more likely than not to also be clustered within the same region of one&#x27;s larger cognitive map. Clustering shows that people tend to chunk information together according to smaller layouts within a larger cognitive map.

Boundaries are not the only determinants of layout. Clustering also demonstrates another important property of relation to spatial conceptions, which is that spatial recall is a hierarchical process. When someone recalls an environment or navigates terrain, that person implicitly recalls the overall layout at first. Then, due to the concept&#x27;s &quot;rich correlational structure&quot;, a series of associations become activated. Eventually, the resulting cascade of activations will awaken the particular details that correspond with the region being recalled. This is how people encode many entities from varying ontological levels, such as the location of a stapler; in a desk; which is in the office.

One can recall from only one region at a time (a bottleneck). A bottleneck in a person&#x27;s cognitive navigational system could be an issue. For instance, if there were a need for a sudden detour on a long road trip. Lack of experience in a locale, or simply sheer size, can disorient one&#x27;s mental layout, especially in a large and unfamiliar place with many overwhelming stimuli. In these environments, people are still able to orient themselves, and find their way around using landmarks. This ability to &quot;prioritize objects and regions in complex scenes for selection (and) recognition&quot; was labeled by Chun and Jiang in 1998. Landmarks give people guidance by activating &quot;learned associations between the global context and target locations.&quot; Mallot and Gillner (2000) showed that subjects learned an association between a specific landmark and the direction of a turn, thereby furthering the relationship between associations and landmarks. Shelton and McNamara (2001) succinctly summed up why landmarks, as markers, are so helpful: &quot;location...cannot be described without making reference to the orientation of the observer.&quot;

People use both the layout of a particular space and the presence of orienting landmarks in order to navigate. Psychologists have yet to explain whether layout affects landmarks or if landmarks determine the boundaries of a layout. Because of this, the concept suffers from a chicken and the egg paradox. McNamara has found that subjects use &quot;clusters of landmarks as intrinsic frames of reference,&quot; which only confuses the issue further.

People perceive objects in their environment relative to other objects in that same environment. Landmarks and layout are complementary systems for spatial recall, but it is unknown how these two systems interact when both types of information are available. As a result, people have to make certain assumptions about the interaction between the two systems. For example, cognitive maps are not &quot;absolute&quot; but rather, as anyone can attest, are &quot;used to provide a default...(which) modulated according to...task demands.&quot; Psychologists also think that cognitive maps are instance based, which accounts for &quot;discriminative matching to past experience.&quot;

This field has traditionally been hampered by confounding variables, such as cost and the potential for previous exposure to an experimental environment. Technological advancements, including those in virtual reality technology, have made findings more accessible. Virtual reality affords experimenters the luxury of extreme control over their test environment. Any variable can be manipulated, including things that would not be possible in reality.

==Virtual reality==
During a 2006 study, researchers designed three different virtual towns, each of which had its own &quot;unique road layout and a unique set of five stores.&quot; However, the overall footprint of the different maps was exactly the same size, 80 sq. units. In this experiment, participants had to partake in two different sets of trials.

A study conducted at the University of Maryland compared the effect of different levels of immersion on spatial memory recall. In the study, 40 participants used both a traditional desktop and a head-mounted display to view two environments, a medieval town, and an ornate palace, where they memorized two sets of 21 faces presented as 3D portraits. After viewing these 21 faces for 5 minutes, followed by a brief rest period, the faces in the virtual environments were replaced with numbers, and participants recalled which face was at each location. The study found on average, those who used the head-mounted display recalled the faces 8.8% more accurately, and with a greater confidence. The participants state that leveraging their innate vestibular and proprioceptive senses with the head-mounted display and mapping aspects of the environment relative to their body, elements that are absent with the desktop, was key to their success.

===Spatial expertise===
Within the literature, there is evidence that experts in a particular field are able to perform memory tasks in accordance with their skills at an exceptional level. The level of skill displayed by experts may exceed the limits of the normal capacity of both STM and WM. Because experts have an enormous amount of prelearned and task-specific knowledge, they may be able to encode information in a more efficient way.

An interesting study investigating taxi drivers&#x27; memory for streets in Helsinki, Finland, examined the role of prelearned spatial knowledge. This study compared experts to a control group to determine how this prelearned knowledge in their skill domain allows them to overcome the capacity limitations of STM and WM. The study used four levels of spatial randomness:

* Route Order – spatially continuous route
* Route Random – spatially continuous list presented randomly
* Map Order – street names forming a straight line on the map, but omitting intermediate streets
* Map Random – streets on map presented in random order

The results of this study indicate that the taxi drivers&#x27; (experts&#x27;) recall of streets was higher in both the route order condition and the map order condition than in the two random conditions. This indicates that the experts were able to use their prelearned spatial knowledge to organize the information in such a way that they surpassed STM and WM capacity limitations. The organization strategy that the drivers employed is known as chunking. Additionally, the comments made by the experts during the procedure point towards their use of route knowledge in completing the task. To ensure that it was in fact spatial information that they were encoding, the researchers also presented lists in alphabetical order and semantic categories. However, the researchers found that it was in fact spatial information that the experts were chunking, allowing them to surpass the limitations of both visuo-spatial STM and WM.

===Animal research===
Certain species of paridae and corvidae (such as the black-capped chickadee and the scrub jay) are able to use spatial memory to remember where, when and what type of food they have cached. Studies on rats and squirrels have also suggested that they are able to use spatial memory to locate previously hidden food. Experiments using the radial maze have allowed researchers to control for a number of variables, such as the type of food hidden, the locations where the food is hidden, the retention interval, as well as any odor cues that could skew results of memory research. Studies have indicated that rats have memory for where they have hidden food and what type of food they have hidden. This is shown in retrieval behavior, such that the rats are selective in going more often to the arms of the maze where they have previously hidden preferred food than to arms with less preferred food or where no food was hidden.
The evidence for the spatial memory of some species of animals, such as rats, indicates that they do use spatial memory to locate and retrieve hidden food stores.

A study using GPS tracking to see where domestic cats go when their owners let them outside reported that cats have substantial spatial memory. Some of the cats in the study demonstrated exceptional long term spatial memory. One of them, usually traveling no further than to from its home, unexpectedly traveled some from its home. Researchers initially thought this to be a GPS malfunction, but soon discovered that the cat&#x27;s owners went out of town that weekend, and that the house the cat went to was the owner&#x27;s old house. The owners and the cat had not lived in that house for well over a year.

==Visual–spatial distinction==
Logie (1995) proposed that the visuo-spatial sketchpad is broken down into two subcomponents, one visual and one spatial. These are the visual cache and the inner scribe, respectively. The visual cache is a temporary visual store including such dimensions as color and shape. Conversely, the inner scribe is a rehearsal mechanism for visual information and is responsible for information concerning movement sequences. Although a general lack of consensus regarding this distinction has been noted in the literature, there is a growing amount of evidence that the two components are separate and serve different functions.

Visual memory is responsible for retaining visual shapes and colors (i.e., what), whereas spatial memory is responsible for information about locations and movement (i.e., where). This distinction is not always straightforward since part of visual memory involves spatial information and vice versa. For example, memory for object shapes usually involves maintaining information about the spatial arrangement of the features which define the object in question.

In practice, the two systems work together in some capacity but different tasks have been developed to highlight the unique abilities involved in either visual or spatial memory. For example, the visual patterns test (VPT) measures visual span whereas the Corsi Blocks Task measures spatial span. Correlational studies of the two measures suggest a separation between visual and spatial abilities, due to a lack of correlation found between them in both healthy and brain damaged patients.

Support for the division of visual and spatial memory components is found through experiments using the dual-task paradigm. A number of studies have shown that the retention of visual shapes or colors (i.e., visual information) is disrupted by the presentation of irrelevant pictures or dynamic visual noise. Conversely, the retention of location (i.e., spatial information) is disrupted only by spatial tracking tasks, spatial tapping tasks, and eye movements. For example, participants completed both the VPT and the Corsi Blocks Task in a selective interference experiment. During the retention interval of the VPT, the subject viewed irrelevant pictures (e.g., avant-garde paintings). The spatial interference task required participants to follow, by touching the stimuli, an arrangement of small wooden pegs which were concealed behind a screen. Both the visual and spatial spans were shortened by their respective interference tasks, confirming that the Corsi Blocks Task relates primarily to spatial working memory.

==Measurement==
There are a variety of tasks psychologists use to measure spatial memory on adults, children and animal models. These tasks allow professionals to identify cognitive irregularities in adults and children and allows researchers to administer varying types of drugs and/or lesions in participants and measure the consequential effects on spatial memory.

===The Corsi block tapping task===

The Corsi block-tapping test, also known as the Corsi span rest, is a psychological test commonly used to determine the visual-spatial memory span and the implicit visual-spatial learning abilities of an individual. Participants sit with nine wooden 3x3-cm blocks fastened before them on a 25- x 30-cm baseboard in a standard random order. The experiment taps onto the blocks a sequence pattern which participants must then replicate. The blocks are numbered on the experimenters&#x27; side to allow for efficient pattern demonstration. The sequence length increases each trial until the participant is no longer able to replicate the pattern correctly. The test can be used to measure both short-term and long-term spatial memory, depending on the length of time between test and recall.

The test was created by Canadian neuropsychologist Phillip Corsi, who modeled it after Hebb&#x27;s digit span task by replacing the numerical test items with spatial ones. On average, most participants achieve a span of five items on the Corsi span test and seven on the digit span task.

===Visual pattern span===
The visual pattern span is similar to the Corsi block tapping test but regarded as a more pure test of visual short-term recall. Participants are presented with a series of matrix patterns that have half their cells colored and the other half blank. The matrix patterns are arranged in a way that is difficult to code verbally, forcing the participant to rely on visual spatial memory. Beginning with a small 2 x 2 matrix, participants copy the matrix pattern from memory into an empty matrix. The matrix patterns are increased in size and complexity at a rate of two cells until the participant&#x27;s ability to replicate them breaks down. On average, participants&#x27; performance tends to break down at sixteen cells.

===Pathway span task===
This task is designed to measure spatial memory abilities in children. The experimenter asks the participant to visualize a blank matrix with a little man. Through a series of directional instructions such as forwards, backwards, left or right, the experimenter guides the participant&#x27;s little man on a pathway throughout the matrix. At the end, the participant is asked to indicate on a real matrix where the little man that he or she visualized finished. The length of the pathway varies depending on the level of difficulty (1–10) and the matrices themselves may vary in length from 2 x 2 cells to 6 x 6.

===Dynamic mazes===
Dynamic mazes are intended for measuring spatial ability in children. With this test, an experimenter presents the participant with a drawing of a maze with a picture of a man in the center. While the participant watches, the experimenter uses his or her finger to trace a pathway from the opening of the maze to the drawing of the man. The participant is then expected to replicate the demonstrated pathway through the maze to the drawing of the man. Mazes vary in complexity as difficulty increases.

===Radial arm maze===
First pioneered by Olton and Samuelson in 1976, the radial arm maze is designed to test the spatial memory capabilities of rats. Mazes are typically designed with a center platform and a varying number of arms branching off with food placed at the ends. The arms are usually shielded from each other in some way but not to the extent that external cues cannot be used as reference points.

In most cases, the rat is placed in the center of the maze and needs to explore each arm individually to retrieve food while simultaneously remembering which arms it has already pursued. The maze is set up so the rat is forced to return to the center of the maze before pursuing another arm. Measures are usually taken to prevent the rat from using its olfactory senses to navigate such as placing extra food throughout the bottom of the maze.

===Morris water navigation task===
The Morris water navigation task is a classic test for studying spatial learning and memory in rats and was first developed in 1981 by Richard G. Morris for whom the test is named. The subject is placed in a round tank of translucent water with walls that are too high for it to climb out and water that is too deep for it to stand in. The walls of the tank are decorated with visual cues to serve as reference points. The rat must swim around the pool until by chance it discovers just below the surface the hidden platform onto which it can climb.

Typically, rats swim around the edge of the pool first before venturing out into the center in a meandering pattern before stumbling upon the hidden platform. However, as time spent in the pool increases experience, the amount of time needed to locate the platform decreases, with veteran rats swimming directly to the platform almost immediately after being placed in the water. Due to the nature of task involving rats to swim, most researchers believe that habituation is required to decrease the stress levels of the animal. The stress of the animal may impair cognitive testing results.

==Physiology==

===Hippocampus===
The hippocampus provides animals with a spatial map of their environment. It stores information regarding non-egocentric space (egocentric means in reference to one&#x27;s body position in space) and therefore supports viewpoint independence in spatial memory. This means that it allows for viewpoint manipulation from memory. It is important for long-term spatial memory of allocentric space (reference to external cues in space). Maintenance and retrieval of memories are thus relational or context dependent. The hippocampus makes use of reference and working memory and has the important role of processing information about spatial locations.

Blocking plasticity in this region results in problems in goal-directed navigation and impairs the ability to remember precise locations. Amnesic patients with damage to the hippocampus cannot learn or remember spatial layouts, and patients having undergone hippocampal removal are severely impaired in spatial navigation.

Monkeys with lesions to this area cannot learn object-place associations and rats also display spatial deficits by not reacting to spatial change. In addition, rats with hippocampal lesions were shown to have temporally ungraded (time-independent) retrograde amnesia that is resistant to recognition of a learned platform task only when the entire hippocampus is lesioned, but not when it is partially lesioned. Deficits in spatial memory are also found in spatial discrimination tasks.
Large differences in spatial impairment are found among the dorsal and ventral hippocampus. Lesions to the ventral hippocampus have no effect on spatial memory, while the dorsal hippocampus is required for retrieval, processing short-term memory and transferring memory from the short term to longer delay periods. Infusion of amphetamine into the dorsal hippocampus has also been shown to enhance memory for spatial locations learned previously. These findings indicate that there is a functional dissociation between the dorsal and ventral hippocampus.

Hemispheric differences within the hippocampus are also observed. A study on London taxi drivers, asked drivers to recall complex routes around the city as well as famous landmarks for which the drivers had no knowledge of their spatial location. This resulted in an activation of the right hippocampus solely during recall of the complex routes which indicates that the right hippocampus is used for navigation in large scale spatial environments.

The hippocampus is known to contain two separate memory circuits. One circuit is used for recollection-based place recognition memory and includes the entorhinal-CA1 system, while the other system, consisting of the hippocampus trisynaptic loop (entohinal-dentate-CA3-CA1) is used for place recall memory and facilitation of plasticity at the entorhinal-dentate synapse in mice is sufficient to enhance place recall.

Place cells are also found in the hippocampus.

===Posterior parietal cortex===
The parietal cortex encodes spatial information using an egocentric frame of reference. It is therefore involved in the transformation of sensory information coordinates into action or effector coordinates by updating the spatial representation of the body within the environment. As a result, lesions to the parietal cortex produce deficits in the acquisition and retention of egocentric tasks, whereas minor impairment is seen among allocentric tasks.

Rats with lesions to the anterior region of the posterior parietal cortex reexplore displaced objects, while rats with lesions to the posterior region of the posterior parietal cortex displayed no reaction to spatial change.

Parietal cortex lesions are also known to produce temporally ungraded retrograde amnesia.

===Entorhinal cortex===
The dorsalcaudal medial entorhinal cortex (dMEC) contains a topographically organized map of the spatial environment made up of grid cells. This brain region thus transforms sensory input from the environment and stores it as a durable allocentric representation in the brain to be used for path integration.

The entorhinal cortex contributes to the processing and integration of geometric properties and information in the environment. Lesions to this region impair the use of distal but not proximal landmarks during navigation and produces a delay-dependent deficit in spatial memory that is proportional to the length of the delay. Lesions to this region are also known to create retention deficits for tasks learned up to 4 weeks but not 6 weeks prior to the lesions.

Memory consolidation in the entorhinal cortex is achieved through extracellular signal-regulated kinase activity.

===Prefrontal cortex===
The medial prefrontal cortex processes egocentric spatial information. It participates in the processing of short-term spatial memory used to guide planned search behavior and is believed to join spatial information with its motivational significance. The identification of neurons that anticipate expected rewards in a spatial task support this hypothesis. The medial prefrontal cortex is also implicated in the temporal organization of information.

Hemisphere specialization is found in this brain region. The left prefrontal cortex preferentially processes categorical spatial memory including source memory (reference to spatial relationships between a place or event), while the right prefrontal cortex preferentially processes coordinate spatial memory including item memory (reference to spatial relationships between features of an item).

Lesions to the medial prefrontal cortex impair the performance of rats on a previously trained radial arm maze, but rats can gradually improve to the level of the controls as a function of experience. Lesions to this area also cause deficits on delayed nonmatching-to-positions tasks and impairments in the acquisition of spatial memory tasks during training trials.

===Retrosplenial cortex===
The retrosplenial cortex is involved in the processing of allocentric memory and geometric properties in the environment. Inactivation of this region accounts for impaired navigation in the dark and it may be involved in the process of path integration.

Lesions to the retrosplenial cortex consistently impair tests of allocentric memory, while sparing egocentric memory. Animals with lesions to the caudal retrosplenial cortex show impaired performance on a radial arm maze only when the maze is rotated to remove their reliance on intramaze cues. 
In humans, damage to the retrosplenial cortex results in topographical disorientation. Most cases involve damage to the right retrosplenial cortex and include Brodmann area 30. Patients are often impaired at learning new routes and at navigating through familiar environments. However, most patients usually recover within 8 weeks.

The retrosplenial cortex preferentially processes spatial information in the right hemisphere.

===Perirhinal cortex===
The perirhinal cortex is associated with both spatial reference and spatial working memory. It processes relational information of environmental cues and locations.

Lesions in the perirhinal cortex account for deficits in reference memory and working memory, and increase the rate of forgetting of information during training trials of the Morris water maze. This accounts for the impairment in the initial acquisition of the task. Lesions also cause impairment on an object location task and reduce habituation to a novel environment.

==Neuroplasticity==
Spatial memories are formed after an animal gathers and processes sensory information about its surroundings (especially vision and proprioception). In general, mammals require a functioning hippocampus (particularly area CA1) in order to form and process memories about space. There is some evidence that human spatial memory is strongly tied to the right hemisphere of the brain.

Spatial learning requires both NMDA and AMPA receptors, consolidation requires NMDA receptors, and the retrieval of spatial memories requires AMPA receptors. In rodents, spatial memory has been shown to covary with the size of a part of the hippocampal mossy fiber projection.

The function of NMDA receptors varies according to the subregion of the hippocampus. NMDA receptors are required in the CA3 of the hippocampus when spatial information needs to be reorganized, while NMDA receptors in the CA1 are required in the acquisition and retrieval of memory after a delay, as well as in the formation of CA1 place fields. Blockade of the NMDA receptors prevents induction of long-term potentiation and impairs spatial learning.

The CA3 of the hippocampus plays an especially important role in the encoding and retrieval of spatial memories. The CA3 is innervated by two afferent paths known as the perforant path (PPCA3) and the dentate gyrus (DG)-mediated mossy fibers (MFs). The first path is regarded as the retrieval index path while the second is concerned with encoding.

==Disorders/deficits==

===Topographical disorientation===
Topographical disorientation (TD) is a cognitive disorder that results in the individual being unable to orient his or herself in the real or virtual environment. Patients also struggle with spatial-information dependent tasks. These problems could possibly be the result of a disruption in the ability to access one&#x27;s cognitive map, a mental representation of the surrounding environment or the inability to judge objects&#x27; location in relation to one&#x27;s self.

Developmental topographical disorientation (DTD) is diagnosed when patients have shown an inability to navigate even familiar surroundings since birth and show no apparent neurological causes for this deficiency such as lesioning or brain damage. DTD is a relatively new disorder and can occur in varying degrees of severity.

A study was done to see if topographical disorientation had an effect on individuals who had mild cognitive impairment (MCI). The study was done by recruiting forty-one patients diagnosed with MCI and 24 healthy control individuals. The standards that were set for this experiment were:
# Subjective cognitive complaint by the patient or his/her caregiver.
# Normal general cognitive function above the 16th percentile on the Korean version of the Mini-Mental State Examination (K-MMSE).
# Normal activities of daily living (ADL) assessed both clinically and on a standardized scale (as described below).
# Objective cognitive decline below the 16th percentile on neuropsychological tests.
# Exclusion of dementia.
TD was assessed clinically in all participants. Neurological and neuropsychological evaluations were determined by a magnetic imaging scan which was performed on each participant. Voxel-based morphometry was used to compare patterns of gray-matter atrophy between patients with and without TD, and a group of normal controls. The outcome of the experiment was that they found TD in 17 out of the 41 MCI patients (41.4%). The functional abilities were significantly impaired in MCI patients with TD compared to in MCI patients without TD and that the presence of TD in MCI patients is associated with loss of gray matter in the medial temporal regions, including the hippocampus.

===Hippocampal damage and schizophrenia===
Research with rats indicates that spatial memory may be adversely affected by neonatal damage to the hippocampus in a way that closely resembles schizophrenia. Schizophrenia is thought to stem from neurodevelopmental problems shortly after birth.

Rats are commonly used as models of schizophrenia patients. Experimenters create lesions in the ventral hippocampal area shortly after birth, a procedure known as neonatal ventral hippocampal lesioning (NVHL). Adult rats with NVHL show typical indicators of schizophrenia, such as hypersensitivity to psychostimulants, reduced social interactions and impaired prepulse inhibition, working memory and set-shifting. Similar to schizophrenia, impaired rats fail to use environmental context in spatial learning tasks such as showing difficulty completing the radial arm maze and the Moris water maze.

===NEIL1===

Endonuclease VIII-like 1 (NEIL1) is a DNA repair enzyme that is widely expressed throughout the brain. NEIL1 is a DNA glycosylase that initiates the first step in base excision repair by cleaving bases damaged by reactive oxygen species and then introducing a DNA strand break via an associated lyase reaction. This enzyme recognizes and removes oxidized DNA bases including formamidopyrimidine, thymine glycol, 5-hydroxyuracil and 5-hydroxycytosine. NEIL1 promotes short-term spatial memory retention. Mice lacking NEIL1 have impaired short-term spatial memory retention in a water maze test.

== GPS use and Spatial Cognition ==
Global Positioning System (GPS) technology has revolutionized the way we navigate and explore our environment. GPS has become an essential tool in our daily lives, providing real-time information about our location and the directions we need to take to reach our destination. However, some researchers have raised concerns about the impact of GPS use on our spatial learning and memory.
Spatial learning refers to our ability to perceive, remember, and use spatial information acquired in the environment. Memory, on the other hand, involves our ability to store and retrieve information about the world around us. Both spatial learning and memory are crucial for our ability to navigate and explore our environment effectively.
The use of GPS has been shown to have both positive and negative effects on spatial learning and memory. Research has shown that people who rely on GPS for navigation are less likely to develop and use mental maps and have a harder time remembering details about the environment, as GPS use can lead to a decline in those skills over time. Furthermore, GPS users tend to rely more on the technology than on their own cognitive abilities, leading to a loss of confidence in their navigational skills.

However, this loss in confidence in one&#x27;s own skills is counteracted by the knowledge that getting lost is no longer a problem, thanks to the GPS on our phones, which in turn restores our confidence in our wayfinding ability. Some beneficial outcomes attributed to GPS assistance are more efficient and accurate navigation, coupled with a significant reduction in the cognitive load required for navigation. When people use GPS devices, they do not have to worry about remembering the route, paying attention to landmarks, or constantly checking maps. This can free up cognitive resources for other tasks, leading to better performance on such tasks and higher levels of concentration and focus. This allows to free up cognitive resources to facilitate information processing and learning.

To compensate for the issues that arise from GPS use, there has been substantial research that proposes alternative forms of GPS navigation or additions to the existing ones that have been shown to enhance spatial learning. A study from 2021 implemented a 3D spatial audio system similar to an auditory compass, where users are directed towards their destination without explicit directions. Rather than being led passively through verbal directions, users are encouraged to take an active role in their own spatial navigation. This led to more accurate cognitive maps of space, an improvement which was demonstrated when the participants of the study drew precise maps after performing a scavenger hunt task. Another study suggested highlighting local features like landmarks, along the route and at decision points; or highlighting structural features that provide global orientation (not the details concerning the route taken by the study&#x27;s participants, but landmarks of the larger area surrounding it). The study showed that accentuating local features in wayfinding maps (GPS) supports the acquisition of route knowledge, which was measured with a pointing and a global feature recall task.

Also, in blind and visually impaired people the use of GPS provide advantages in spatial learning and memory. Blind and visually impaired people often need to obtain information about locations ahead of time and practice along a specific route with the help of a relative, friend or specialized instructor before traveling the route to said destination independently. GPS comes in by offering helpful information therefore allowing them to become more independent and confident with their travel to a specific destination.

Another research paper claims that a GPS can be used for patients suffering from dementia. 
In a study done in 2014, drivers with mild to very mild Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD) were administered 3 driving trials with different GPS settings (normal, visual-only and audio-only). The participants were required to perform a variety of driving tasks on a driving simulator following the GPS instructions. This study has found that using single, simple auditory instructions with the absence of the visual output of the GPS could potentially help people with mild AD to improve their driving ability and reach their destination, therefore confirming that GPS use does reduce cognitive loads.

Since GPS use would help the patients with wayfinding, it would allow them to stay safe in public, reclaim their sense of self-sufficiency, and discourage &quot;wandering&quot;. Overall, evidence is strongest about the use of GPS technologies for averting harm and promoting wellbeing.

The impact of GPS use on spatial learning and memory is not yet fully understood, and further research is needed to explore the long-term effects of GPS use on these cognitive processes. However, it is clear that GPS technology has both benefits and drawbacks, and users should be aware of the potential impact of their reliance on GPS.
In conclusion, GPS technology has revolutionized the way we navigate and explore our environment, but its impact on our spatial learning and memory is still a subject of debate. While GPS use can help people navigate more efficiently, confidently, and aid populations who would otherwise be significantly hindered; its use may lead to a decline in spatial cognitive skills over time. Therefore, it is essential for users to balance the benefits and drawbacks of GPS use and to be aware of its potential impact on their cognitive abilities.

==Learning difficulties==
Nonverbal learning disability (NVLD) is characterized by normal verbal abilities but impaired visuospatial abilities. Problem areas for children with nonverbal learning disability include arithmetic, geometry, and science. Impairments in spatial memory are linked to nonverbal learning disorder and other learning difficulties.

Arithmetic word problems involve written text containing a set of data followed by one or more questions and require the use of the four basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). Researchers suggest that successful completion of arithmetic word problems involves spatial working memory (involved in building schematic representations) which facilitates the creation of spatial relationships between objects. Creating spatial relationships between objects is an important part of solving word problems because mental operations and transformations are required.

Researchers investigated the role of spatial memory and visual memory in the ability to complete arithmetic word problems. Children in the study completed the Corsi block task (forward and backward series) and a spatial matrix task, as well as a visual memory task called the house recognition test. Poor problem-solvers were impaired on the Corsi block tasks and the spatial matrix task, but performed normally on the house recognition test when compared to normally achieving children. The experiment demonstrated that poor problem solving is related specifically to deficient processing of spatial information.

==Sleep==
Sleep has been found to benefit spatial memory, by enhancing hippocampal-dependent memory consolidation, elevating different pathways which are responsible for synaptic strength, control plasticity-related gene transcription and protein translation (Dominique Piber, 2021). Hippocampal areas activated in route-learning are reactivated during subsequent sleep (NREM sleep in particular). One study demonstrated that the actual extent of reactivation during sleep correlated with the improvement in route retrieval and therefore memory performance the following day. The study established the idea that sleep enhances the systems-level process of consolidation that consequently enhances/improves behavioral performance. A period of wakefulness has no effect on stabilizing memory traces, in comparison to a period of sleep. Sleep after the first post-training night, i.e., on the second night, does not benefit spatial memory consolidation further. Therefore, sleeping in the first post-training night e.g. after learning a route, is most important.

Further, it has been illustrated that early and late nocturnal sleep have different effects on spatial memory. N3 of the NREM sleep, also referred to as slow wave sleep (SWS), is supposed to have a salient role for the sleep-dependent creation of spatial memory in humans. Particularly in the study conducted by Plihal and Born (1999), the performance on mental rotation tasks was higher among participants who had early sleep intervals (23.00–02.00 am) after learning the task compared to the ones who had late sleep intervals (03.00–06.00 am). These results suggest that early sleep, which is rich in SWS, has certain benefits for the formation of spatial memory. When researchers examined whether early sleep would have such an impact on word stem priming task (verbal task), the results were the opposite. This was not surprising for researchers as priming tasks mostly rely on procedural memory, and thus, it benefits more late retention sleep (dominated by REM sleep) rather than early.

Sleep deprivation and sleep has also been a researched association. Sleep deprivation hinders memory performance improvement due to an active disruption of spatial memory consolidation. As a result, spatial memory is enhanced by a period of sleep. Similar results were confirmed by another study examining the impact of total sleep deprivation (TSD) on rats&#x27; spatial memory (Guan et al., 2004). In the first experiment conducted, the rats were trained in Morris water maze for 12 trials in 6 hours to find a hidden platform (transparent and not visible in the water) by using spatial cues in the environment. In each trial, they started from a different point and were allowed to swim for a maximum of 120 s to reach the platform. After the learning phase, they gave a probe trial to test spatial memory (after 24 h). In this trial, the hidden platform was removed from the maze and the time animals spent in the target area (which was occupied by hidden platform before) was a measure of spatial memory persistence. The control rats, who had spontaneous sleep, spent significantly more time in the target quadrant compared to ones who had total sleep deprivation. In terms of spatial learning, which is indicated by the latency to find the hidden platform, there were no differences. For both control and sleep deprived rats, the time required to find a platform was decreasing with every new trial.

In the second experiment, the rats were trained to swim to a visible platform whose location was changed in each trial. For every new trial, the rats started from the opposite side of the platform. After the training in a single trial, their memory was tested after 24 h. Platform was still in the maze. The distance and the time they needed to swim to the visible platform were considered as non-spatial memory measures. No significant difference has been found between sleep deprived rats and control rats. Similarly, in terms of spatial learning, which is indicated by latency to reach the visible platform, there were no significant differences. TSD does not affect non-spatial learning and non-spatial memory.

In reference to the effects of sleep deprivation on humans, Dominique Piber (2021) featured in his literature review the clinical observations which shows that people with severe sleep disorders frequently have abnormalities in spatial memory. As visible in the studies of both, insomnia patients who suffer from a sleep disorder which features interrupted, non-restorative sleep and deficits in cognitive performance during the day, are documented to have a negative performance in a spatial task, in comparison with the healthy participants (Li et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2016; Khassawneh et al., 2018; He et al., 2021).

Likewise, dreaming has an important role in spatial memory. A study conducted by Wamsley and Stickgold (2019) proved that participants, who incorporate a recent learning experience into their overnight dream content, show an increased overnight performance improvement. Thus, supporting the hypothesis that dreaming reflects memory processing in the sleeping brain. Moreover, according to the authors, one of the explanations is that maze‐related dreams are indicators that performance‐relevant components of task memory are being reactivated in the sleeping brain. Additionally, the study supports the idea that dream reports can include an experimental learning task during all stages of sleep, including REM and NREM.

Virtual reality (VR) has also been used to study the connection between dreams and spatial memory. Ribeiro, Gounden, and Quaglino (2021) proposed spatialized elements in a VR context and found that after a full night of sleep in a home setting, when the material studied was incorporated into the dream content, the recall performance of these elements was better than the performance obtained after a comparable wake period.

<doc id="858943" wikidata="Q7846859" url="?curid=858943" title="Troy Hurtubise">
<text>Troy James Hurtubise (November 23, 1963 – June 17, 2018) was a Canadian inventor, entrepreneur and conservationist, noted for creating the Ursus series of bear suits which showed the Ursus Mark VI in the 1996 film Project Grizzly directed by Peter Lynch for the National Film Board of Canada.

Hurtubise starred in the 1996 film &quot;Project Grizzly&quot; documenting his development of a series of protective suits that would allow for close-quarters bear research as well as testing of deterrent bear sprays. For his suit invention, he was awarded an Ig Nobel Prize for Safety Engineering in 1998.

He also developed the Trojan Ballistics Suit of Armor, an exoskeleton suit intended for soldiers. He died in 2018 as the result of a vehicle collision.

==Personal life==
Born in Hamilton, Ontario, he moved to North Bay and later died in a vehicle collision west of there on June 17, 2018.

==Inventions==

===Ursus suit===
Hurtubise built a metal suit for protection from grizzly bears; recorded as a National Film Board of Canada documentary and called &quot;Project Grizzly&quot;, in which Hurtubise tested the capabilities of the suit using himself as the test subject. Hurtubise discovered that bears wouldn&#x27;t attack the suit. This resulted in his Ig Nobel Prize for Safety Engineering in 1998. The documentary focuses on version six of the suit (&quot;Ursa Mark VI&quot;), and also includes clips of the previous versions being tested.

=== Firepaste ===
Firepaste (&quot;see also Starlite&quot;) is an intumescent white paste that, when dry, is flame and heat resistant. It has a consistency and texture similar to clay when wet and dries into a gray ceramic material which resembles concrete. The impetus for firepaste came from a failed fire test with the Ursus Mark VII where the metal exoskeleton heated up, popped the air bags and left Hurtubise with numerous burns. Like Project Grizzly, Hurtubise has tested the material on himself. For a demonstration for the media and military in summer 2004, he made a thin mask of the material, put it over his face, and aimed a specialized blowtorch at thousands of degrees directly at the mask. The temperature was intentionally much hotter than the temperatures reached by the Space Shuttle on reentry. A thermometer located between his face and the mask measured no appreciable temperature change below the mask after nearly ten minutes, and the integrity of the material was not compromised.

=== Angel Light ===
According to Hurtubise, this device made walls, hands, stealth shielding, and other objects transparent. He claimed that beams from the device had the side-effects of damaging electronic devices and killing goldfish. After testing the device on his own hand, he claimed he could see his own blood vessels and muscle tissue as clearly as if the skin had been pulled back, but the beam caused numbness and he began to feel ill. He also claimed to be able to read the licence plate on a car in his garage from his workshop and see the road salt on it. Many experts have discounted Hurtubise&#x27;s invention and accused him of quackery.

=== Trojan armor ===
In early 2007, Hurtubise made public his new protective suit which was designed to be worn by soldiers. Calling it the &quot;Trojan Ballistics Suit of Armor&quot;, Hurtubise described it as the &quot;first ballistic, full exoskeleton body suit of armour&quot;. He claimed that the suit could withstand bullets fired from high powered weapons (including an elephant gun). Hurtubise published a demonstration video in which 9mm, .357 handgun rounds, and a 12 gauge shotgun round were fired at the suit&#x27;s vest from short range; the apparently uncut video shows no marks at all on the ballistic clay underneath. The suit also features a knife holster and a helmet with two fans, one for intake and one for exhaust, to help cool the wearer.

The suit has many features including a solar powered air system, recording device, compartments for emergency morphine and salt, and a knife and gun holster. He estimates that the cost of each suit to be roughly $2,000 if mass-produced. It has been called the &quot;Halo suit&quot;, after the fictional MJOLNIR battle armor worn by the Master Chief character in the Xbox and PC video game series &quot;Halo&quot;.

In early February 2010, after failing to receive any offers to buy the Trojan, Hurtubise, now bankrupt from the expense of creating the suit, was forced to put the prototype up for auction on eBay in the hopes that it would bring in enough money to sustain his family. The auction&#x27;s reserve bid was not met. There was a raffle for the suit on the Mission Trojan website, whose goal is to raise money for further prototypes and testing of the Trojan Suit to demonstrate its abilities for military applications. The suit was won by Sara Markis of Florida who donated it back to Hurtubise for work on his next prototype.

== Death ==
On June 17, 2018, Hurtubise was travelling on Highway 17, west of North Bay, when his car collided with a transport truck carrying gasoline, sparking an explosion. The transport truck driver suffered minor injuries, but Hurtubise&#x27;s body was discovered inside the burned passenger vehicle. Hurtubise left behind a wife and son.

<doc id="858955" wikidata="Q173016" url="?curid=858955" title="Coventry Climax">
<text>Coventry Climax was a British manufacturer of forklift trucks, fire pumps, racing engines, and other speciality engines.

==History==

===Pre WWI===
The company was started in 1903 as Lee Stroyer, a joint venture by Jens Stroyer and Pelham Lee. In 1905, following the departure of Stroyer, it was relocated to Paynes Lane, Coventry, and renamed as Coventry Simplex by Horace Pelham Lee, a former Daimler employee, who saw an opportunity in the nascent internal combustion engine market.

An early user was GWK, who produced over 1,000 light cars with Coventry-Simplex two-cylinder engines between 1911 and 1915. Just before the First World War, a Coventry-Simplex engine was used by Lionel Martin to power the first Aston Martin car. Ernest Shackleton selected Coventry-Simplex to power the tractors that were to be used in his Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition of 1914.

Hundreds of Coventry-Simplex engines were manufactured during the First World War to be used in generator sets for searchlights.

===Post WWI===
In 1919, Pelham Lee acquired an existing company, Johnson &amp; Smith Ltd, and changed its name to Coventry Climax Engines Ltd with premises at East Street, Coventry. [Board of Trade Certificate, Herbert Collection, Coventry] (Coventry Simplex continued under separate management).

Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the company supplied engines to many companies manufacturing light cars such as Abbey, AJS, Albatross, Ashton-Evans, Bayliss-Thomas, Clyno, Crossley, Crouch, GWK, Marendaz, Morgan, Triumph, Swift, Standard, and Waverley Cars of London. In the early 1930s, the company also supplied engines for buses, and in 1935 supplied the &#x27;L&#x27; engine to David Brown tractors for the 550 Model A, being a collaborative venture with Ferguson. In the 1920s, the company moved to Friars Road, Coventry, and in the late 1930s, they also acquired the former Riley premises on Widdrington Road, Coventry.

With the closure of Swift in 1931, the company was left with a stock of engines that were converted to drive electric generators, a field in which they had experience from building WW1 searchlight generators. They also started to make engine driven pumps, and mounted on a trailer as a mobile fire fighting appliance this was to be a great success. The economic problems of the 1930s hit the business hard, and Leonard Pelham Lee, who had taken over from his father, created a separate division of the company for the fire pumps. While the motor car engine business suffered during the recession, the mobile fire pump division of Coventry Climax became a great success, particularly during the late 1930s and this continued during the war. 

Another diversification was into commercial vehicle engines. This started in 1929 with the launch of a large (5.8 litre) six-cylinder side-valve petrol engine intended for buses and trucks, and was followed in 1931 by a six-cylindered 6.8 litre petrol engine of inlet over exhaust (IOE) design, and a 4-cylinder engine in 1932. In 1934 Commercial Motor referred to the &#x27;popular Coventry Climax engines&#x27; as the six-cylindered L6 and the four-cylindered B4 – the latter being of &#x27;especially modern design with wet liners&#x27;. Examples of vehicles using the engines include the 1932 Karrier Bantam refuse truck, and the 1935 Gilford Motors CF176 coach.

Going into the war, Coventry Climax used their marine diesel experience to further develop and build the Armstrong Whitworth supercharged H30 multifuel engine for military use. This has been fitted as an auxiliary engine in the British Chieftain and Challenger battle tanks and Rapier anti-aircraft missile systems.

===Post WWII===

In the late 1940s, the company shifted away from automobile engines and into other markets, including marine diesels, and forklift trucks – plus continuing to make their very successful fire pumps. In 1946, the ET199 forklift was announced, which the company claimed was the first British-produced forklift truck. The ET199 was designed to carry a load with a load centre, and with a lift height.

In 1950, Harry Mundy joined Coventry Climax, and a new lightweight all-aluminium overhead camshaft engine was developed in response to the government&#x27;s ambitious requisition outline asking for a portable fire pump that was capable of pumping double the amount of water specified in the previous outline, with half the weight.

This was designated the FW for &quot;Feather Weight&quot;. The engine was displayed at the Motor Show in London and attracted attention from the motor racing fraternity for its very high &quot;horsepower per pound of weight&quot;. With strong persuasions at the show, including those by Cyril Kieft (who had Stirling Moss as an F3 driver) and a young Colin Chapman, Lee concluded that success in competition could lead to more customers for the company, and so the team designed the FWA, a &quot;F&quot;eather &quot;W&quot;eight engine for &quot;A&quot;utomobiles.
The first Coventry Climax racing engine appeared at the 1954 24 Hours of Le Mans in the front of one of two Kieft 1100 sports racers, but both cars (one with an MG engine) failed to finish the race due to problems unrelated to the engines. The FWA became popular in sportscar racing and was followed by the Mark II and then by the FWB, which had a capacity of nearly 1.5-litres. The new Formula Two regulations suited the 1.5-litre engine, and it quickly became the engine to have in F2 racing. By 1957, the first Climax engines began to appear in Formula One in the back of Cooper chassis.

Initially, these were FWBs, but the FPF engine followed. Stirling Moss scored the company&#x27;s first Formula One victory in Argentina in 1958, using a 2-litre version of the engine. In general terms, however, the engines were not powerful enough to compete with the 2.5-litre machinery, and it was not until the 2.5-litre version of the FPF arrived in 1959 that Jack Brabham was able to win the world championship in a Cooper-Climax. At the same time, the company produced the FWE engine for the Lotus Elite, and this enjoyed considerable success in sports car racing, with a series of class wins at the Le Mans events in the early 1960s.

In 1961, there was a new 1.5-litre formula, and the FPF engine was given a new lease on life, although the company began work on a V8 engine, designated the FWMV, and this became competitive in 1962 predominantly in Lotus, Cooper, Brabham, and Lola chassis, with Jim Clark&#x27;s Lotus outstandingly the most successful. There were a total of 22 Grand Prix victories before 1966 with crossplane, flat-plane, two- and four-valve versions of the FWMV. When the new, 3-litre, formula was introduced, Coventry Climax decided not to build engines for the new formula and withdrew from racing after the unsuccessful FWMW project, with the exception of the new 2-Litre version of the FWMV.

Also, in the early 1960s, Coventry Climax was approached by Rootes to mass-produce FWMAs for use in a compact family car project called Apex with an all-aluminium alloy overhead cam engine combined with a full-synchromesh aluminium transaxle. This combination was considered very radical at the time, especially the synchromesh on all forward gears, which had been declared &#x27;impossible&#x27; by Alec Issigonis of BMC Mini fame. The adoption to mass-production was successful, and the project came out to the market as the 875cc Hillman Imp totaling over 400,000 units made by 1976, including the later 998cc version.

===Final years===
At Earls Court in 1962, Coventry Climax chairman, Leonard Pelham Lee announced the withdrawal from building Formula 1 engines, stating that the company was losing money and not gaining enough publicity from their involvement. Nonetheless, Coventry Climax remained in Formula One until they were unable to come up with a new engine for the three-litre formula. The company was purchased by Jaguar Cars in 1963, which itself merged with the British Motor Corporation (BMC) in 1966 to form British Motor Holdings (BMH).

In May 1964, the Royal Automobile Club presented the Dewar Trophy, which is given at the recommendation of RAC&#x27;s Technical and Engineering Committee for the most outstanding British achievement in the automotive field, to Leonard Pelham Lee. The citation reads: &quot;Awarded to Coventry Climax Engines Ltd. for the design, development, and production of engines which have brought British cars to the forefront in the field of Grand Prix racing.&quot; The history of this trophy dates back to 1906. The last time the Dewar Trophy was awarded before 1964, the recipient was Alec Issigonis for British Motor Corporation (BMC) in 1959 on the design and production of the ADO15 Mini.

BMH merged with the Leyland Motor Corporation in 1968 to form the British Leyland Motor Corporation, which was then nationalised in 1975 as British Leyland (BL). Coventry Climax became part of the British Leyland Special Products Division, alongside Alvis, Aveling-Barford, and others. At the end of 1978, BL brought together Coventry Climax Limited, Leyland Vehicles Limited (trucks, buses, and tractors), Alvis Limited (military vehicles), and Self-Changing Gears Limited (heavy-duty transmissions) into a new group called BL Commercial Vehicles (BLCV) under managing director David Abell.

In the early 1970s, the fire pump business was sold back into private ownership, and the Godiva Fire Pumps company was formed in Warwick. In 1977 Coventry Climax acquired the Warrington forklift truck business of Rubery Owen Conveyancer, renaming it &quot;Climax Conveyancer&quot;.

In 1982 BL sold off the Coventry Climax forklift truck business back into private ownership to Coventry Climax Holdings Limited. Sir Emmanuel Kaye, also chairman and a major shareholder of Lansing Bagnall at the time, formed the company, independent of his other interests for the purpose of acquiring Coventry Climax.

In 1986 Coventry Climax went into receivership and was acquired by Cronin Tubular. In 1990, a further change of ownership came with the engine business being sold to Horstman Defence Systems of Bath, Somerset, thus breaking the link with Coventry.
Kalmar Industries acquired the forklift truck interests of Coventry Climax in 1985. The company traded as &quot;Kalmar Climax&quot; for a few years but is now trading as Kalmar Industries Ltd. The &#x27;Coventry Climax logo trademark is the property of Canadian Peter Schömer, based in Chichester.

===Design===
Within the complicated corporate lineage, the reputation of Coventry Climax as a top-rate engine designer-builder is largely credited to Walter Hassan and Harry Mundy, who designed and developed the FW together. The following design aspects are credited to these two people, except the last two items, in which Peter Windsor Smith played a considerable role in place of Mundy, who left the firm in 1955 and returned in 1963.

*Designed as a fire engine component, one unique requirement the Feather Weight fulfilled was the ability to be run at nearly full-throttle without a proper warm-up. This required careful attention to lubrication and thermal expansion rates on its parts, which translated into legendary durability in rough racing environments at the price of high oil consumption.
*Another technical significance of the FW series, which was carried over to the FWM, is an interpretation of Harry Ricardo&#x27;s intake turbulence theory, whereby intake and exhaust valves are tilted to the same side of the engine where the intake and exhaust ports are located. In the SOHC reverse-flow cylinder head design, where valves are actuated directly under the camshaft, and where the intake and exhaust ports are located fore and aft of the cylinder bore centre, this arrangement allows intake and exhaust flows to encourage a swirl in the same rotational direction in the combustion chamber going into and coming out of the cylinder.
*Later crossflow DOHC FPF designs incorporated the same concept in a completely different arrangement, where the tracts in the intake manifold are connected to the intake ports in a staggered manner, in a somewhat corkscrew fashion, to create the turbulence by the intake flow.
*The FWMV had an unusually small exhaust valve size to intake valve size ratio for an increased intake flow speed for the same reason. At one time, the FWMV&#x27;s exhaust valve size (1.37&quot;) exceeded the inlet valve size (1.35&quot;) on the most successful Mk.4 version.
*Separately, the FWMV Mk.III and Mk.4 became famous for proving that flatplane crankshaft design is more advantageous for a racing V8 than a crossplane, in spite of the engineering theories at the time suggesting otherwise. Flatplane crankshafts became the norm in V8 racing engine designs from the 1970s on.

===F Type===
At the Olympia Motor Show in 1923, Coventry Climax listed four F-type 4-cylinder water cooled engines. All had 100 mm stroke, and the bores were 59 (1,094 cc displacement), 63 (1,247 cc), 66 (1,368 cc) and 69 mm (1,496 cc). The GWK car had featured in Coventry Climax adverts from late 1920 with a Coventry Climax 10.8 hp 4-cylinder engine, the same horsepower rating as the 66 mm bore F type. The engines were available either separate or in unit construction with a three speed gearbox.

===ET 2===
Also displayed at the 1923 Olympia Motor Show was a 1,005 cc twin cylinder 2-stroke engine. The bore was 80 mm and the stroke 85 mm.

===CX===
The main engine of interest at the 1923 show was the new 6-cylinder 1,753 cc CX engine. This had 61 mm bore and 100 mm stroke, and was rated at 13.8 hp. The same six-cylinder engine appeared in the Waverley car at the 1925 Olympia motor show. The engine size had increased to 1,991 cc (65 mm bore, 16 hp rating), with overhead valves and Lanchester style vibration damper, it was coupled to a 4-speed Meadows gearbox.

===OC===

At first, the OC was made with a capacity of 1,122 cc as a straight-four using a bore of 63 mm and stroke of 90 mm with overhead inlet and side exhaust valves, producing . It was introduced in the early 1930s and also built under licence by Triumph.

===MC===
The OC engine had morphed into the MC engine by 1933. It looked virtually identical, but there were internal differences. It was still 1,122 cc, I.O.E., and four cylinders inline, but the camshaft was different, as were the cam followers. The timing marks on the flywheel are now observed from the top of the engine rather than the underside as on the OC. Carburation varied, from the side draught Solex, the down draught SU, to the progressive choke down draught and then a larger side draught SU system on Triumph engines. The engine was water-cooled by thermosyphon with no water pump or fan.

===JM===
A six-cylinder version of the MC engine, the JM, was made with a capacity of 1,476 cc with a 59 mm bore, developing . The JMC version had its capacity increased to 1,683 cc by increasing the bore to 63 mm and produced . It was different from the 4 cylinder engine in that it had both a water pump and an oil filter, whereas the 4 cylinder engine relied on thermosyphon alone and no oil filter.

===FW===

The FW 38 hp 1,020 cc straight-four SOHC was designed by Hassan and Mundy as the motive unit for a portable service fire pump which was supplied to the government under three contracts totaling over 150,000 units. This engine was revolutionary in its lightness, with a bare weight of 180 pounds, combined with the maintenance-free valve adjustment using shims under an overhead camshaft.

In 1953 it was adapted for automotive racing as the 1,098 cc FWA retaining the cast crank three main bearing construction of the FW but with a distributor ignition in place of a magneto, a different camshaft, and a higher, 9.8:1 compression ratio. With a bore of 2.85 inches and a stroke of 2.625 inches, it produced at 6,000 rpm and was first used at Le Mans in 1954 by Kieft Cars. After the FWA was introduced, the FW was renamed to FWP (Pump).

The larger bore (3 inches) and longer stroke (3.15 inches) 1,460 cc FWB engine followed; it retained the FWA head but had a forged steel crank and produced a nominal . In 1966–67, Fisher-Pierce of America imported an 85 hp version of the FWB with twin-carburetors to be mounted vertically in their outboard marine unit. This outboard boat engine came out to the market as Bearcat 85.
The most significant of the series was the FWE which used the FWB bore size and the FWA stroke for a displacement of 1,216 cc. In exchange for a 1,000 unit purchase agreement signed by Chapman, it was specifically designed for the Lotus Elite with forged steel crank but became a favourite with a number of sports car racing firms for its racing durability and high power-to-weight ratio.

* FWE Stage I – 10:1 compression ratio, single 1-1/2&quot; SU H4 carburetor on cast iron intake and exhaust manifold, 75 bhp at 6100rpm
* FWE Stage II – Dual 1-1/2&quot; SU H4 carburetors on alloy manifold, standard on Series 2 Elite, 80 bhp at 6100rpm
* FWE Stage III (Super 95) – 10.5:1 compression ratio, dual twin-choke Weber 40DCOE, 95 bhp at 7000rpm
* FWE Super 100 – Five-bearing high lift camshaft, steel timing gear, ported head, 100 bhp
* FWE Super 105 – 11:1 compression ratio, racing (tuned steel tubular, rather than cast) exhaust manifold, 105 bhp

The FWE powered Lotus Elites won their class six times and the Index of Thermal Efficiency once during the 24 Hours of Le Mans. The FW series engines in modified forms also powered Lotus Eleven cars which took three class wins at Le Mans and one Index of Performance win.

Other FW variants included a short-stroke (1.78 inches) steel crank version of the FWA named the 744 cc FWC, as used by Dan Gurney early in his career in US club racing. The objective of this engine was for Lotus to campaign for the 750 cc Le Mans Index of Performance prize in 1957, three engines were made for this purpose, and it won the prize in a Lotus Eleven driven by Cliff Allison and Keith Hall. Lotus also campaigned the FWC at Le Mans in 1958. Another variant was the 998 cc FWG, which was designed to the 1,000 cc FIA Formula Two rules, also with a steel crankshaft to produce just shy of 100 bhp at 9,000 rpm.

===FPE (the &#x27;Godiva&#x27;)===
Commission Sportive Internationale announced in 1952 that 2.5L naturally aspirated engines would be a part of Formula One regulation starting 1954. Walter Hassan and especially Harry Mundy having their roots deeply in the racing field, started discussions and preliminary designs of a 2.5L 8 Cylinder GP engine in 1952 without a formal directive from the father and son Pelham Lees. Because this project was a pure racing engine from the beginning, which was in stark contrast to the corporate product history up to FWA, the engine was named FPE for Fire Pump Engine (Eight according to another lore) by the playful minds of Hassan and Mundy.

After the corporate blessing was given to the project with the name &#x27;Godiva&#x27;, this DOHC, 90-degree, steel crossplane crank V8 engine was built in 1954 for an F1 Kieft with the intention to use the fuel injection system made by Skinners Union (SU).
However, this fuel injection system, designed for aeroplane engines, was found not to have the means to enrich the mixture for acceleration, which is not suitable for automobile use. FPE initially showed 240 bhp using Weber carburettors, but the press at the time reported the rumoured fuel-injected Mercedes 2.5L GP engine is quoted as producing more than 300 bhp, and a corporate decision was made not to release FPE to Kieft in light of the lack of proper fuel injection, leaving the Kieft F1 project, as well as other prospective users, HWM and Connaught, high and dry.

There were reports to the effect that the engine was not run because of fears about the rumoured power of other 2.5L GP engines, but shortly after, John Cooper brought a race-winning, works Maserati F1 engine he had on loan into Coventry Climax, where it produced 225 bhp running on the same dynamometer upon which the FPE had made 264 bhp after some development.

Ultimately, development on the engine was abandoned in favour of focusing on the FPF engine, which was already proven competitive in 1.5L form with side-draft Weber carburetors in the F2 races, and the entire stock of parts was sold to Andrew Getley in the mid-1960s. When the Formula One regulation changed to 3 Litres for 1966, Mr. Getley permitted Paul Emery to rebuild one FPE to 3 Litre format and fit it into a one-off Shannon steel monocoque chassis to make the Shannon F1 car named SH1 driven by Trevor Taylor at 1966 British Grand Prix. Bored out to 3 Litres and Tecalemit Jackson fuel injection installed, this Emery-built FPE produced 312 bhp on the dynamometer at Chrysler&#x27;s Kew facility.

Remnants of other FPE parts were much later found by the then-owner of 1954 Kieft F1 chassis, Gordon and Martyn Chapman, in an air-raid cellar in the abandoned building which used to belong to Bill Lacey (of Power Engines Ltd., a Coventry Climax specialist) near the main entrance of Silverstone Circuit, including 3 blocks, 2 cranks, 16 cylinder heads, 20-some cam covers (carriers?), two card boxes full of timing gears and camshafts, which all belonged to &quot;Doc Murfield&quot; who had purchased the parts from Andrew Getley in 1968-69 and had entrusted them to Bill Lacey.

These parts were assembled into two engines under the ownership of Gordon Chapman and then under Bill Morris, who bought the engine parts and the Kieft chassis after Gordon Chapman&#x27;s death. One engine was sold by Chapman to the then-owner of Shannon SH1, and this FPE is said to be in Austria together with Shannon SH1. Another using two of the later type twin spark plug heads in the stock, was run in the original 1954 Kieft-Climax V8 Grand Prix chassis with downdraft Weber 40IDF carburetors when they were finally mated, and the construction finished on 21 September 2002 at VSCC Silverstone Meeting, and this car was campaigned in VSCC events for the next 10 years.

Four sets of period-correct Weber 40DCNL carburetors were installed on the FPE during the 10 years, and the car, one spare chassis, and the FPE parts were sold in a lot at Bonhams Chichester auction on 15 September 2012 for £185,000.

===FPF===
The FPF was a double overhead cam all-aluminium four-cylinder that was essentially half of the above FPE V8 engine, which was designed as a pure racing engine from the outset. Designed in 1955 and becoming available in 1956, it had gear-driven camshafts, steel alloy cylinder sleeves, and individual oil scavenge as well as pressure feed pumps for a dry sump system. Carburetion was by two twin-choke Weber DCO side-draft carburettors.

It started life as a 1,475 cc Formula Two engine by enlarging the 2.95 in bore of the FPE to 3.2 in with the slightly increased stroke, and was gradually enlarged for use in Formula One.

A 1,964 cc (3.4&quot; x 3.3&quot;) version took Stirling Moss and Maurice Trintignant to Cooper&#x27;s first two Grand Prix victories against 2.5 L opposition in 1958. After the interim 2,207 cc (3.5&quot; x 3.5&quot;) version, a larger block was cast to result in 2,467 cc (3.7&quot; x 3.5&quot;) in 1958, and then to a full-sized 2,497 cc (3.7&quot; x 90 mm) in 1960. Jack Brabham won the World Championship of Drivers in both 1959 and 1960 driving FPF powered Coopers.

The FPF with the smaller block was then adopted to the new 1.5-litre Formula One of 1961 as 1,499.8 cc (82 mm x 71 mm) FPF Mk.II and won three World Championship Grand Prix races in that year. In addition, capacity was increased on the larger block to 2,751 cc (96 mm x 95 mm) for the Indianapolis 500 and this variant was also utilised for sports car racing, the Intercontinental Formula and Formula Libre racing. It also served as a stopgap in the new 3.0 L Formula One regulation, which went into effect in 1966. The 2,497 cc FPF gained a new lease of life in 1964 with the introduction of the Tasman Formula and the Australian National Formula, both of which had a maximum engine capacity of 2.5 litres.
  Notes: 
===FWM===
The FW was designed in response to the British Government&#x27;s Ministry of Defence (MoD) requisition outline issued in 1950, specifying a water pump and petrol engine combination to deliver 350 gallons of water per minute at 100 psi, with 35 to 40 bhp at the weight of 350 pounds or less. The successful bid by a portable pump driven by the 38 bhp FW mounted in a steel pipe frame resulted in a 5000 unit supply contract in 1952.

By 1956, 1,460 cc FWB was adapted back to a higher output fire pump engine as FWBP with good results, and led to the realisation that the newer 35 hp general purpose engine specification by the government (including for Search Lights and Generator Sets) could be met with a smaller displacement engine than the FW(P). This resulted in the development of SOHC 654 cc (2.35&quot; bore x 2.25&quot; stroke) FWM in 1957, which basically was a smaller and lighter version of FWP with many detailed differences that reflect the improvements and cost-cutting as well as weight-saving measures found in the development of FWA, FWB, and FWE. The differences include:

* Deletion of the intermediary shaft (Jackshaft) making the cam drive a single stage chain as opposed to FW series&#x27; two stage gear/chain set up. This made the camshaft turn in the same direction as the crank.
* Conrod big end part line was made horizontal, as opposed to the previous diagonal.
* The number of cylinder head studs was reduced from 18 to 10.

==== Evolution====
FWM was then developed into an automotive engine as FWMA of 742 cc with larger 2.45&quot; bore and 2.4&quot; stroke in 1959. Several versions of FWMD diesel utility engines, including a marine version, followed, and then a chain-driven DOHC 2 valves per cylinder crossflow cylinder head was developed and became the FWMC, succeeding FWC as the all-out racing engine for the 750cc class. FWMC became known for the unusually loud and high-pitched exhaust note when installed in a specially made super-light version of Lotus Elite run by UDT Laystall at 1961 Le Mans 24 Hours. It was this 4 cylinder DOHC FWMC that was used as the basis to develop the successful FWMV V8.

However, coinciding with the promotion of Peter Windsor Smith as the Chief Engineer (reporting to Walter Hassan) in 1960, Coventry Climax reverted (as in OC and JM engines) to using the metric system for specifying piston and crankshaft sizes, so FWMV cylinder dimensions were bore and stroke, ending up having almost no parts interchangeability to FWMC despite having an extremely similar piston and cylinder-head design.
To streamline production, the 63 mm × 60 mm sizes were later applied back to the 4 cylinder engine to form the 748 cc FWMB with the same cylinder head as the FWMA.
===FWMV===
The 1.5-litre FWMV V8, developed from FWMC using a crossplane crankshaft, was designed in 1960 and ran for the first time in May 1961. It produced from 11.5:1 compression ratio and made its debut on Cooper T58 at 1961 German GP in August. Initial developments resulted in at 8500rpm soon after, but Jack Brabham at Cooper and Stirling Moss at Rob Walker Racing Team suffered over-heating problems while enjoying a great amount of power for the rest of the season.

The problem was diagnosed to originate in the steel cylinder sleeve&#x27;s thermal expansion rate being different from the Aluminium alloy cylinder-head, causing the Cooper Ring in between the sleeve and the head to leak. With this problem solved in the Mk.II 186 bhp version, having a larger 1.35&quot; intake valves (1.30&quot; previously), FWMV started to score GP victories, ending the 1962 season with 3 wins for Lotus, 1 win for Cooper, 5 second places and 4 third places, in addition to 7 pole positions and 6 fastest laps.

For 1963, Coventry Climax was able to convince Lucas to supply the cogged belt-driven fuel injection system originally developed for BRM with then-unique sliding throttle plates with four round intake bores cut-out. With the larger bore (from 63 mm to 68 mm) and shorter stroke (60 mm to 51.5 mm) compared to Mk.II, notable changes include the increase in conrod length (from 4.2&quot; to 5.1&quot; centre to centre, with a shorter piston crown height) and the switch from crossplane to flat-plane crankshaft, which surprisingly did not increase vibration in the higher RPM range because the longer conrod length (and, to a less extent, lighter pistons) counteracted the increase in secondary vibration inherent in flatplane design.

The flat-plane crank was adopted partly due to Rob Walker&#x27;s proposed successor to the 4WD Ferguson P99 Formula 1 having a front engine layout, which could not accommodate exhaust pipes that merge with pipes from exhaust ports on the opposing bank on crossplane arrangement, but this project did not materialise. Later, such an elaborate crossplane exhaust system became well-known as &quot;bundle of snakes&quot; on the Ford GT40, but was a feature of FWMV Mk.I and Mk.II.

This Mk.III developed at 9,500 rpm, propelling Jim Clark, Lotus 25 and Team Lotus to 7 wins, 7 pole positions, 6 fastest laps, and the 1963 World Championship title.

Mk.4 was developed for 1964 with yet larger bore (72.4 mm) and shorter stroke (45.5 mm) with a larger exhaust valve (from 1.237&quot; to 1.37&quot;) and 12:1 compression ratio to result in at 9750rpm.
One-off Mk.5 was made with a larger inlet valve (from 1.35&quot; to 1.40&quot;) for , which was delivered to Lotus and used by Clark in the 1964 season. Mk.4 and Mk.5 scored five wins (three by Clark for Lotus, two by Gurney for Brabham), seven pole positions, and seven fastest laps.

A one-off 4 valve Mk.6 had 1.04&quot; intake and 0.935&quot; exhaust valves, new pistons, cylinder sleeves and crankshaft, and had gear driven camshafts as opposed to the previous chain drive. This engine made at 10,300 rpm and went to Lotus during 1965. Another 4 valve one-off, Mk.7, was built with 1.107&quot; intake and 1.043&quot; exhaust and all the new Mk.6 parts for at 10,500 rpm, and was delivered to Brabham. However, these engines started showing reliability problems.

Except for these two one-off 4 valve engines with characteristic ribbed cam covers, all the FWMVs used in 1965 season were 2 valve Mk.5 or earlier versions with various levels of upgrade. This was because Coventry Climax had started the FWMW flat-16 project, which was finally announced at the beginning of 1965, and had more than a handful in things needed to be developed or solved, so the 4 valve configuration on FWMV did not get completely developed nor did reach a series production. However, Jim Clark was able to win 6 championship races (3 with Mk.6), 6 pole positions and 6 fastest laps to become the 1965 World Champion.

At the end of the 1965 season, the failure of FWMW project left Coventry Climax with no 3 litre successor to FWMV for the next season, so a 2 Litre version of FWMV was assembled using Mk.4 bore (72.40 mm) and Mk.II stroke (60.00 mm) and was used by Lotus in 1966 as a stopgap until 3 litre BRM H-16 engines became available but with little success. However, Jim Clark won the 1967 Tasman Series with this engine in his Lotus 33.

Overall, FWMV powered Cooper, Lotus and Brabham Formula One cars won 22 World Championship Grand Prix races.
===FWMW===
By the middle of the 1962 season, Peter Windsor Smith and Walter Hassan were convinced that the only viable route to more power was through higher revs, and the decision was made, partly in light of Harry Mundy&#x27;s experiences on the 1.5-Litre supercharged BRM V16, to develop a 1.5-Litre flat-16 designated the FWMW. Design work started in 1963, and a prototype was running on the bench in late 1964 with two flatplane flat-8 cranks end-to-end, shrunk-fit to a central spur gear at 90 degrees phase shift to each other.

Work on this project continued through the later years of the 1.5 Litre formula with Lotus and Brabham the likely recipients. The engine was fairly compact at 30.9&quot; long (only 1&quot; longer than FWMV Mk.4) and 22.6&quot; wide, but there were a number of design issues still to solve before the formula ran out. Not only had the engine shown no power advantage over the V8 despite its much higher rev limit, but it had mechanical problems that would have required either a major rework to solve properly or, at the least, the need for complete engine rebuilds after 3 hours of running.

From the outset, the largest problem was torsional vibration of the crankshaft, which at one time necessitated a ban on using less than 4000 rpm on the bench. The vibration often caused one or other of the cranks to shear itself off the central spur gear, resulting in the engine becoming two aphasic flat-8s, or the parallel quill shaft (driven at 0.8 times the crank speed, located below crank, and in turn driving the flywheel and ancillaries) overheated and disintegrated.

The central power-take-off system using the parallel shaft was intended to reduce torsional vibration of the long crankshaft, but destructive vibration appeared no matter what was changed in firing order, crank counter-weight configuration or crankshaft weight distribution.

As a result, Coventry Climax could not derive revenues from the project, and was further forced to develop a 2-Litre version of FWMV so that Lotus, who built one Lotus 33 chassis specifically for FWMW, and were counting on using FWMW&#x27;s anticipated 3-litre successor, could avoid missing the first races of the 1966 season. Neither the old four-cylinder FPF nor the eight-cylinder FWMV could be enlarged to 3 litres, and the 11 years old 2.5-Litre FPE parts had been sold off in their entirety and were in the hands of Paul Emery, who was in the process of enlarging FPE to 3-Litres.

Partly because of this project&#x27;s grand scale failure, and partly because of Jaguar&#x27;s take over in 1963, Coventry Climax could not develop a 3-litre successor to the FWMW, and announced its withdrawal from the F1 engine business. Its reputation and the long-standing relationship with Team Lotus were seriously tarnished.

  Notes: 

===Jaguar V12===


Having designed and developed the successful Jaguar XK engine under the guidance of William Heynes at SS Cars Ltd, Walter Hassan and the team were tasked to develop a Jaguar 5.0 L DOHC V12 engine when Coventry Climax was purchased by Jaguar in 1963. 
It was about this time when Walter Hassan convinced Harry Mundy, who had left to become the Technical Editor of &quot;The Autocar&quot; magazine in 1955 (while there he also designed the Lotus-Ford Twin Cam for Colin Chapman), to rejoin the team, which now included the Jaguar engineer, Claude Bailey, who always worked under William Heynes from the days of XK engine development. William Heynes was the executive in charge of the team, who retired in July 1969.

This engine was initially conceived in 1954 for the Le Mans 24 Hour Race by combining two Jaguar XK cylinder heads on a common 60 degree block.
The first prototype was assembled in 1964 with LM8 aluminium alloy sand cast block and flanged cast iron liners, EN4A forged and nitrided 7 main bearing crankshaft for 4994 cc (87 mm × 70 mm). This racing engine, with its intake ports in between the intake and the exhaust camshafts, came out to be the fuel-injected 5L DOHC Jaguar XJ13 engine in 1966, but more importantly, it was further developed by the same team into the series-production 5.3 L SOHC V12 engine. This engine, with characteristically long intake tracts connecting the four carburetors on the outside of cam covers to the intake ports inside the V angle, came out to the market on Jaguar E-Type in 1971, on Jaguar XJ12 in 1972, and, together with the later 6.0 L version, remained in production until 1997.

===CFA and CFF===
After the designing was finished on the 5.3 L V12 and the Jaguar XJ, Jaguar wanted a modern engine for a smaller version of XJ. Although Jaguar had gained access to the 2.5 Litre iron block Daimler V8 with the take over of Daimler in 1960, it was a pushrod engine designed in the 1950s, and was not particularly small or light as it was based on, and had many common components with, the 4.5 Litre version.

In response, Coventry Climax designed an aluminium crossflow chain-driven SOHC cylinder head somewhat similar to the 5.3L V12 head, on FWMV Mk.4 block with a stroked crank and wet sump. Tecalemit-Jackson fuel injection was used for the development of this 2,496 cc CFA V8 that weighed 300 lb, with a bore and stroke of 80.77 mm and 60.96 mm and the engine was installed on Leonard Pelham Lee&#x27;s personal Triumph 2000 Estate.

The testing was promising, producing more than 200 bhp at 7,000 rpm in flexible sports-car tune and a 1,812 cc CFF version was prototyped; however, this 1.8 – 2.5 Litre baby XJ project was killed along with the V8 engines when British Motor Holdings merged with Leyland Motor Corporation in 1968 for the strategy to eliminate internal competition against what came out to be the Rover SD1.

==Formula One legacy==
In the period 1958–1965, Climax-powered cars won 40 (out of 75) World Championship Grands Prix, were runners-up on another 8 occasions, and won 59 non-championship races. The last win for a Climax-powered car in an international event was Mike Spence&#x27;s win in the non-championship 1966 South African Grand Prix, driving a Lotus 33. The last entries for Climax-powered cars in a World Championship Grand Prix were at the 1969 Canadian Grand Prix, where John Cordts&#x27; Brabham retired with an oil leak and Al Pease in an Eagle was disqualified for driving too slowly.

<doc id="858957" wikidata="Q11722368" url="?curid=858957" title="List of Native American politicians">
<text>This is a list of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] politicians in the United States. These are Native Americans who served in the federal, state, or municipal governments.

Native American identity is a complex and contested issue. The Bureau of Indian Affairs defines Native American as having American Indian or Alaska Native ancestry. Legally, being Native American is defined as being enrolled in a federally recognized tribe or Alaskan village. These entities establish their own membership rules, and they vary. Each must be understood independently. Ethnologically, factors such as culture, history, language, religion, and familial kinships can influence Native American identity.

All individuals on this list should have Native American ancestry. Historical figures might predate tribal enrollment practices and may be included based on reliable sources that document ethnological tribal membership. Any contemporary individuals should either be enrolled members of federally recognized tribes, or have cited Native American ancestry and be recognized as Native American by their respective tribes(s). Contemporary individuals who are not enrolled in a tribe but are documented as having tribal descent are listed as being &quot;of descent&quot; from a tribe.

For tribal leaders, please go to that tribe&#x27;s article.

<doc id="858965" wikidata="Q283368" url="?curid=858965" title="Raqqa">
<text>Raqqa (, also ) is a city in Syria on the North bank of the Euphrates River, about east of Aleppo. It is located east of the Tabqa Dam, Syria&#x27;s largest dam. The Hellenistic, Roman, and Byzantine city and bishopric Callinicum (formerly a Latin and now a Maronite Catholic titular see) was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate between 796 and 809, under the reign of Harun al-Rashid. It was also the capital of the Islamic State from 2014 to 2017. With a population of 531,952 based on the 2021 official census, Raqqa is the sixth largest city in Syria.

During the Syrian Civil War, the city was captured in 2013 by the Syrian opposition and then by the Islamic State. ISIS made the city its capital in 2014. As a result, the city was hit by airstrikes from the Syrian government, Russia, the United States, and several other countries. Most non-Sunni religious structures in the city were destroyed by ISIS, most notably the Shia Uwais al-Qarni Mosque, while others were converted into Sunni mosques. On , following a lengthy battle that saw massive destruction to the city, the Syrian Democratic Forces (YPG/PKK) declared the liberation of Raqqa from the Islamic State to be complete.
== History ==
===Hellenistic Nikephorion and Kallinikos===
The area of Raqqa has been inhabited since remote antiquity, as attested by the mounds (tells) of Tall Zaydan and Tall al-Bi&#x27;a, the latter being identified with the Babylonian city Tuttul.

The modern city traces its history to the Hellenistic period, with the foundation of the city of Nikephorion (, Latinized as &quot;Nicephorium&quot;). There are two versions regarding the establishment of the city. Pliny, in his Natural History, attributes its founding to Alexander the Great, citing the advantageous location as the rationale behind its establishment. Similarly, Isidore of Charax, in the Parthian Stations, also credits its foundation to Alexander. Conversely, Appian includes Nikephorion in a list of settlements he attributes to Seleucid King Seleucus I Nicator (reigned 301–281 BC). According to Tacitus, Nikephorion, alongside other cities like Anthemousias, was established by Macedonians and bore a Greek name.

Seleucus I&#x27; successor, Seleucus II Callinicus (r. 246–225 BC), enlarged the city and renamed it after himself as Kallinikos (, Latinized as &quot;Callinicum&quot;).

According to Cassius Dio, during Crassus&#x27;s preparations for his campaign against the Parthians in the mid-first century BCE, Nikephorion was among the Greek poleis that backed him.

=== Roman and Byzantine times ===
In Roman times, it was part of the Roman province of Osrhoene but had declined by the fourth century. Rebuilt by Byzantine Emperor Leo I (r. 457–474 AD) in 466, it was named Leontopolis (in Greek Λεοντόπολις or &quot;city of Leo&quot;) after him, but the name &quot;Kallinikos&quot; prevailed. The city played an important role in the Byzantine Empire&#x27;s relations with Sassanid Persia and the wars fought between the two empires. By treaty, the city was recognized as one of the few official cross-border trading posts between the two empires, along with Nisibis and Artaxata.

The town was near the site of a battle in 531 between Romans and Sasanians, when the latter tried to invade the Roman territories, surprisingly via arid regions in Syria, to turn the tide of the Iberian War. The Persians won the battle, but the casualties on both sides were high. In 542, the city was destroyed by the Persian Emperor Khusrau I (r. 531–579), who razed its fortifications and deported its population to Persia, but it was subsequently rebuilt by Byzantine Emperor Justinian I (r. 527–565). In 580, during another war with Persia, the future Emperor Maurice scored a victory over the Persians near the city during his retreat from an abortive expedition to capture Ctesiphon.

In the last years before it came under Muslim rule, Kallinikos was as important as any other urban center in the region, and based on the physical area that it covered it was only slightly smaller than Damascus.

=== Early Islamic period ===

In the year 639 or 640, the city fell to the Muslim conqueror Iyad ibn Ghanm. Since then, it has been known by the Arabic name al-Raqqah, or &quot;the morass&quot;, after its marshy surroundings at the time. At the surrender of the city, the Christian inhabitants concluded a treaty with Ibn Ghanm that is quoted by al-Baladhuri. The treaty allowed them freedom of worship in their existing churches but forbade the construction of new ones. The city retained an active Christian community well into the Middle Ages (Michael the Syrian records 20 Syriac Orthodox (Jacobite) bishops from the 8th to the 12th centuries), and it had at least four monasteries, of which the Saint Zaccheus Monastery remained the most prominent one. The city&#x27;s Jewish community also survived until at least the 12th century, when the traveller Benjamin of Tudela visited it and attended its synagogue. At least during the Umayyad period, the city was also home to a small Sabian community.

Ibn Ghanm&#x27;s successor as governor of Raqqa and the Jazira, Sa&#x27;id ibn Amir ibn Hidhyam, built the city&#x27;s first mosque. The building was later enlarged to monumental proportions, measuring some , with a square brick minaret added later, possibly in the mid-10th century. The mosque survived until the early 20th century, being described by the German archaeologist Ernst Herzfeld in 1907, but has since vanished. Many companions of Muhammad lived in Raqqa.

In 656, during the First Fitna, the Battle of Siffin, the decisive clash between Ali and the Umayyad Mu&#x27;awiya took place about west of Raqqa. The tombs of several of Ali&#x27;s followers (such as Ammar ibn Yasir and Uwais al-Qarani) are in Raqqa and have become sites of pilgrimage. The city also contained a column with Ali&#x27;s autograph, but it was removed in the 12th century and taken to Aleppo&#x27;s Ghawth Mosque.

The Islamic conquest of the region did not disrupt the existing trade routes too much, and new Byzantine coins continued to make their way into Raqqa until about 655–8. The Byzantine government may have seen the area as just temporarily in rebellion. Byzantine coinage probably continued to circulate until at least the 690s, if not even longer.

Raqqa appears to have remained an important regional center under Umayyad rule. The Umayyads invested in agriculture in the region, expanding the amount of irrigated farmland and setting the stage for an &quot;economic blossoming&quot; during and after their rule.

The strategic importance of Raqqa grew during the wars at the end of the Umayyad Caliphate and the beginning of the Abbasid Caliphate. Raqqa lay on the crossroads between Syria and Iraq and the road between Damascus, Palmyra and the temporary seat of the caliphate Resafa, al-Ruha&#x27;.

=== Abbasid period ===

In 770-1 (155 AH), the Abbasid caliph al-Mansur made the decision to build a new garrison city, called al-Rāfiqah (&quot;the companion&quot;), about west of Raqqa as part of a general investment in strengthening the empire&#x27;s fortifications. The most critical part of this project was to secure the northwestern frontier with the Byzantine Empire, and al-Rafiqah was its largest and most important construction. It also happens to be the only one that survives to the present day. Although most of the interior layout of al-Rafiqah has since been built over, and much of its fortifications have also been demolished, about of its massive city walls are still standing, as well as its congregational mosque – the first in the world to be built from scratch on &quot;a coherent, integrated plan&quot; and a major influence on later mosque architecture.

Although al-Mansur had conceived the vision for al-Rafiqah in 770–1, it wasn&#x27;t until the next year that construction actually started. The caliph sent his son and eventual successor al-Mahdi to personally supervise the construction of the new city that year. The chronicle of Pseudo-Dionysius indicates that workmen were brought from all over Mesopotamia to work on the construction, hinting at the monumental scale of this project. According to al-Tabari, the plan of al-Rafiqah was basically the same as that of Baghdad: it was built with &quot;the same gates, &quot;intervallum&quot; (&quot;fuṣūl&quot;), squares, and streets&quot; as the recently-built Abbasid capital. In practice, there were some significant differences between the two: al-Rafiqah was somewhat smaller but more heavily fortified than Baghdad, and its shape was more elongated along a north–south axis instead of the famously round city of Baghdad. Construction continued at al-Rafiqah at least until 774–5, when al-Mahdi was again sent to check on its progress.

At least at the beginning of the construction work on al-Rafiqah, the indigenous residents of Raqqa were hostile to the military settlement – they expected a rise in their own cost of living. The newcomers were soldiers from Khorasan, in contrast to the Christians and Arabs who lived in the old city.

By 785, the old market of Raqqa had probably become physically too small to serve the needs of both it and al-Rafiqah. That year, Ali ibn Sulayman, the city&#x27;s governor, moved the market from the old city of Raqqa to the agricultural land between the two cities. This probably marks the start of al-Muhtariqa, the industrial and commercial suburb located between the two (see below). (The old market, associated with the Umayyad caliph Hisham, had been just north of the old city, outside the Bāb al-Ruhā&#x27; – near the later industrial site of Tall Aswad.)

Raqqa and al-Rāfiqah merged into one urban complex, together larger than the former Umayyad capital, Damascus. In 796, the caliph Harun al-Rashid chose Raqqa/al-Rafiqah as his imperial residence. For about 13 years, Raqqa was the capital of the Abbasid Caliphate, which stretched from Northern Africa to Central Asia, but the main administrative body remained in Baghdad. The palace area of Raqqa covered an area of about north of the twin cities. One of the founding fathers of the Hanafi school of law, Muḥammad ash-Shaibānī, was chief qadi (judge) in Raqqa. The splendour of the court in Raqqa is documented in several poems, collected by Abu al-Faraj al-Isfahāni in his &quot;Book of Songs&quot; (&quot;Kitāb al-Aghāni&quot;). Only the small, restored so-called Eastern Palace at the fringes of the palace district gives an impression of Abbasid architecture. Some of the palace complexes dating to the period have been excavated by a German team on behalf of the director general of antiquities. There was also a thriving industrial complex located between the twin cities. Both German and English teams have excavated parts of the industrial complex, revealing comprehensive evidence for pottery and glass production. Apart from large dumps of debris, the evidence consisted of pottery and glass workshops, containing the remains of pottery kilns and glass furnaces.
Approximately west of Raqqa lay the unfinished victory monument Heraqla from the time of Harun al-Rashid. It is said to commemorate the conquest of the Byzantine city of Herakleia in Asia Minor in 806. Other theories connect it with cosmological events. The monument is preserved in a substructure of a square building in the centre of a circular walled enclosure, in diameter. However, the upper part was never finished because of the sudden death of Harun al-Rashid in Greater Khorasan.

Harun al-Rashid also invested in the water supply in Raqqa. Under his rule, canals were dug along the Euphrates and Balikh rivers; they brought water from the area around Saruj to be used for domestic and agricultural purposes, as well as to supply the palace gardens with water. Meanwhile, the influx of residents generated plenty of demand for food, goods, and services, stimulating the economy and resulting in intensified activity in Raqqa&#x27;s rural hinterland. Rural towns such as Hisn Maslama, Tall Mahra, and al-Jarud flourished and reached their peak size. The surrounding countryside at this time was &quot;one of the richest agricultural areas of the empire, with an extensive system of irrigation canals&quot;.

After the return of the court to Baghdad in 809, Raqqa remained the capital of the western part of the Abbasid Caliphate.

==== Geography of Abbasid Raqqa ====
The name &quot;Raqqa&quot; was used both for the entire urban sprawl, or more specifically for the old city of Raqqa aka Kallinikos. The old city was also known by the name al-Raqqah al-Bayḍā&#x27;. It had &quot;almost rectangular&quot; walls, although their entire extent is not known. Where the gates were located is also unknown. This area had a predominantly indigenous population.

===== Al-Rafiqah =====
Somewhat to the west of Raqqa proper was al-Rāfiqah, which had horseshoe-shaped walls. Al-Rafiqah represents the location of present-day Raqqa; at some point the main center shifted here. The earliest evidence for this shift is a Fatimid dinar minted at Raqqa in 1010–1011, which uses the name Raqqa rather than the official Abbasid name of al-Rafiqah. The writer Ibn al-Sam&#x27;ani also recorded this shift over a century later. During Raqqa&#x27;s rapid growth in the late 20th century, al-Rafiqah was almost completely built over with new construction, and today almost nothing remains of the Abbasid city.

Still, about of the original city walls remain today, indicating the massive scale of al-Rafiqah&#x27;s fortifications. The 6.20-metre-thick walls themselves consisted of mud brick on a stone foundation, and their exterior was further reinforced by a stabilized burnt-brick cladding. The walls had 132 towers. Like the Abbasid capital of Baghdad, al-Rafiqah was protected by a series of outer defenses, which together made up a triple line of defense that any attackers would have to get through. A second, outer wall, itself 4.5 m thick, was built beyond the first wall (at a distance of 20.8 m). Beyond that, there was a 15.9-metre--wide moat. Both the outer wall and the moat were bulldozed in the 1970s or 80s to make room for new construction.

Although al-Rafiqah covered a much smaller area than the round city of Baghdad (less than half), it was much more heavily fortified because of its location close to the Byzantine frontier. The walls of al-Rafiqah were built a meter thicker than Baghdad&#x27;s, and it had more (and larger) defensive towers.

The north gate of al-Rafiqah, excavated and partly rebuilt in the 1990s, is the earliest surviving city gate from the Abbasid period. Its name was probably the Bāb Ḥarrān, or the Harran Gate. Its basic layout is &quot;a tower gate with a rectangular room and a deep entrance niche&quot;. The structure is tall, with a ramp on the west side leading up to the top. The gateway was built from stone up to a height of about 2m (above that it was built from brick), while the door opening itself measures 4m. Archaeologists found two door posts made out of solid iron still standing in place here. These probably represent the last traces of a pair of massive iron doors, like the ones that historical texts often mention as part of the entryways to early Islamic cities and palaces. For Raqqa in particular, although not necessarily the Bab Harran itself, different traditions mention an iron gate that originally was part of the Byzantine city of Amorion before being carried off to Samarra in 838 after the Abbasids captured and destroyed the city. This door was then installed at the Bāb al-&#x27;Āmma, the main entrance to the caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim&#x27;s newly built palace. This door then supposedly found its way to Raqqa sometime later during the 9th century, before then being removed in 964 by Sayf al-Dawla, the Hamdanid ruler of Aleppo, to renovate the Bāb Qinnasrīn in his capital. It was then destroyed when the Mongols captured Aleppo in 1260, and its fragments were then taken by the Mamluk sultan Baibars to the citadels of Damascus and Cairo.

Al-Rafiqah itself was laid out on a north–south axis, roughly aligned with the qibla. A major north–south street connected the Bab Harran in the north with al-Rafiqah&#x27;s Great Mosque, right at the center of the walled city. The mosque measures 108×93 m, about the same size as the Abbasid mosque built at Baghdad a decade earlier. However, its materials are more sophisticated: whereas the Baghdad mosque was originally made from mud bricks with wooden columns and ceiling, the al-Rafiqah mosque is entirely made out of kiln-fired bricks. The roof of al-Rafiqah&#x27;s mosque was also gabled, in contrast with the flat-roofed Baghdad mosque, showing an influence from earlier Umayyad mosque architecture in Syria, such as the Great Mosque of Damascus. The al-Rafiqah mosque was renovated in 1165–6 by Nur ad-Din Mahmud Zengi, but an archaeological sounding revealed that this renovation did not change the basic structure, so its origins can be firmly dated to the Abbasid period.

The al-Rafiqah mosque represents an important step in the history of mosque architecture. Earlier mosques had mostly been repurposed from earlier pre-Muslim structures, like the Great Mosque of Damascus, or featured a very rudimentary design, such as the original mosque at Baghdad. The al-Rafiqah mosque was the first to be built entirely from scratch on a coherent plan. It had an important influence on later mosque architecture, beginning in 808 when Harun al-Rashid – who was living in Raqqa at the time and would have been familiar with the al-Rafiqah mosque – had the original mosque at Baghdad rebuilt, adopting features of the design at al-Rafiqah. Later mosques such as the Great Mosque of Samarra and the Mosque of Ibn Tulun in Cairo also contain traces of its influence.

===== Al-Muhtariqa =====
Between Raqqa and al-Rafiqah was a large commercial and industrial area, which was called &quot;al-Raqqa al-Muḥtariqa&quot;, or &quot;the burning Raqqa&quot;, probably because of all the thick smoke coming from pottery kilns and glass furnaces. This smoke may have affected Raqqa/Kallinikos and influenced its decline. It appears that al-Muqaddasi viewed this district as its own distinct city (i.e. &quot;madina&quot; or &quot;misr&quot;), which according to legal norms at the time meant that it had to have a separate congregational mosque, and it had to be separated from other urban precincts by some sort of clearly-defined boundary. The congregational mosque may have been the &quot;mosque suspended on columns&quot;, or perhaps the Samarran complex near the Bab al-Sibal.

Eventually a wall was built on the north side of al-Muhtariqa, probably to protect the central commercial district from Bedouin raids. This is probably the wall that Tahir ibn al-Husayn built while he was governor, in the year following 1 October 815 according to the accounts of Michael the Syrian and Bar Hebraeus. The wall, as visible in old aerial photographs, did not cover the industrial sites north of Raqqa/Kallinikos, leaving them unprotected. Stefan Heidemann suggested that this may have been because those areas were exclusively used for industry, with no houses and no valuables to loot.

Five main streets have been identified in al-Muhtariqa. The northernmost runs eastward from the east gate of al-Rafiqah, called the Bāb al-Sibāl, past the still-unlocated northwestern corner of Raqqa/Kallinikos, and then along the north side of Raqqa/Kallinikos before finally ending around Tall Aswad in the northeast. It passes by several mounds of medieval industrial debris in this area exist. These include Tall Fukhkhār, a ceramic producing site; as well as Tall Ballūr, Tall Abī &#x27;Alī, and Tall Zujāj, which were all glass workshops. Henderson and McLoughlin suggested Tall Ballur may have later been a production site again during the late 11th century after 150 years of abandonment, and Tonghini and Henderson suggested the same for Tall Fukhkhar, although Heidemann considered the latter improbable.

At the eastern end of this northern street, and to the northeast of Raqqa/Kallinikos, was Tall Aswad. This was the largest and easternmost center of pottery production, and probably the oldest among the industrial mounds excavated. It is a large mound consisting of ruins of kilns, potsherds, wasters, and industrial debris. The site had many kilns producing pottery of various types including unglazed, moulded, and high-quality glazed. It lay at the eastern end of the northernmost main road. Its location was probably chosen because it was downwind from the rest of the city, so that the wind wouldn&#x27;t blow smoke from its kilns over residents&#x27; houses. However, this site was also vulnerable and exposed to nomadic attacks, which may have ultimately been the reason for its abandonment. The latest coin find from here is from 825/6, and Tall Aswad probably declined in the first half of the 9th century.

At the western end of the street, right outside the Bab al-Sibal, there was a 200x200m square compound which was probably built during the Samarran period. It featured two rows of small rooms on different levels that were probably rows of shops. There was also some construction to the north of this complex.
The 2nd street runs southeast from the Bab al-Sibal towards the also-still-unlocated western gate of Raqqa/Kallinikos. Like the 1st street, it appears to cut deep into the flat-topped tell formed by centuries of debris. Further south was the southwestern gate of Raqqa/Kallinikos, which was called the Bāb al-Hajarayn. This gate led to a cemetery where people who died in the Battle of Siffin were interred. The most important of the tombs here was that of Uways al-Qarani, considered the &quot;patron saint&quot; of Raqqa; his tomb survived until the late 20th century when it was torn down and replaced with the new Uways al-Qarani mosque. His name also became applied to the entire cemetery.

West of the Bab al-Hajarayn was the mosque called the Masjid al-Janā&#x27;iz, also called the Mashhad al-Janā&#x27;iz. This building is still unlocated. Its existence is known from the 10th until the 13th centuries. According to al-Qushayri, the Masjid al-Jana&#x27;iz was founded by a descendant of Muhammad named Abu Abdallah, a Khorasani who lived by the Bab al-Hajarayn near the city&#x27;s moat.

The 3rd street starts further south, from the unnamed Gate #2 on the east side of al-Rafiqah. It crosses the 2nd street and probably converged with the 1st street at the northwestern corner of Raqqa/Kallinikos, where there was likely a gate.

The 4th and 5th streets both have their west end at the Bab Baghdad. Together, they mark the southern end of the al-Muhtariqa area. Since the Bab Baghdad is a comparatively newer structure, probably from the late 11th or 12th century, these two streets might have also been built later. The 4th street runs northeast toward the northwest corner of Raqqa/Kallinikos, where it probably converged with the 1st and 3rd streets. As for the 5th street, it goes southeast, cutting through the Siffin cemetery and passing by the southwest corner of Raqqa/Kallinikos.

The settlement of al-Muhtariqa probably began in 785, when the city&#x27;s governor Ali ibn Sulayman transferred Raqqa&#x27;s market from Raqqa/Kallinikos to somewhere between it and al-Rafiqah. Before then, this area had been used for agriculture. Later, al-Muhtariqa was expanded when Harun al-Rashid made Raqqa his capital, in order to serve the newly increased demand for luxury and everyday goods.

When al-Muhtariqa finally declined and became abandoned is not clear. Physical evidence includes coins, as late as 825–6 at Tall Aswad and 840–1 at Tall Zujaj, and pottery remains, which at both sites include fragments of the so-called &quot;Samarra ware&quot; in the upper layers, so activity at those sites must have continued at least until that period. Based on the account of Ahmad ibn al-Tayyib al-Sarakhsi in the 880s (see below), al-Muhtariqa was probably still active at least until that point.

===== The palace city =====
When Harun al-Rashid made Raqqa his capital, he built a whole &quot;palace city&quot; to the north of the main city. During the 12 years he resided here, it was built up to an area of 15 square kilometers. Like al-Rafiqah, this area has been almost completely obliterated by new housing construction since the late 20th century. Besides palaces and other buildings, this area included irrigation canals and underground watercourses in order to ensure a constant water supply. Many of the palaces were set in large garden enclosures, with wide avenues and racecourses. Toward the end of Harun al-Rashid&#x27;s reign, this area was also expanded further to the north.

The central palace of Harun al-Rashid is located about 1 km northeast of al-Rafiqah. Here, a large 340x270m building set in a double garden enclosure probably represents the remains of the &quot;Qaṣr as-Salām&quot;, or &quot;palace of peace&quot;, mentioned in historical sources. This building&#x27;s original floorplan has been obscured by later construction, but some of its ornate decoration survived to indicate its importance.

East of the Qasr as-Salam is a series of three smaller palaces, each one featuring courtyards, triple audience halls, and small private mosques. These were probably the residences of Harun al-Rashid&#x27;s family members or close associates. A fresco inscription found in the westernmost of these three palaces names the caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim, who was one of Harun al-Rashid&#x27;s sons; this may date from a later renovation.

Just south of the palace with al-Mu&#x27;tasim&#x27;s name inscribed is a 150x150m square building that was probably the barracks for the palace guard. It had several identical rooms to serve as living quarters, while the commander of the guards had a central room flanked by three connected courtyards. Excavation at the barracks unearthed &quot;a group of particularly luxurious glass vessels&quot;, indicating the high living standards enjoyed even by the lower-ranking members of the caliphal court.

Farther south, at the southeastern corner of the palace complex, was a public square surrounded by several buildings. Some of these buildings were reception halls used for social gatherings. Other buildings were private residences, probably belonging to people who were not part of the caliph&#x27;s inner circle. On the west side of the square was a building that included a small mosque facing the barracks.

Separate from this palace city and just outside the north gate of al-Rafiqah, there was a 160x130m rectangular building that also had a double enclosure. This may have actually been built earlier than the more monumental complexes further northeast.

Stylistically, like the mosque of al-Rafiqah, the palace complex contains decorative features typical of pre-Islamic Syria. These include stucco friezes depicting vine &quot;scrolls&quot;, as well as the &quot;use of decoration to emphasize key architectural features&quot;. This indicates that the builders were taking inspiration from previous local styles. The resulting style of Abbasid Raqqa is a transition between pre-Islamic styles and later Abbasid ones, such as the architecture of Samarra after it became the new Abbasid capital in 836.

===== Monasteries =====
Further north of Tall Aswad was the Dayr al-Zakkā monastery, which was built on top of the ancient settlement mound now called Tall al-Bī&#x27;a. This was the most important monastery in the city and the symbol of Christian Raqqa.

A second important monastery was the so-called Monastery of the Columns (&quot;dērā d-esṭūnā&quot;), also called the Bizūnā monastery. It was somewhere between Raqqa and al-Rafiqah, in the area of al-Muhtariqa. It was burned by the rebels Umar, a former prisoner in Raqqa, and Nasr ibn Shabath, a prominent Bedouin leader, during a violent conflict in 811/2 when Arab auxiliaries were mobilized at Raqqa. However, just a few years later in 818 it was the site of the installation of Patriarch Dionysios I, which indicates that either the monastery was only partly burned down, or that it had already been rebuilt. This monastery was probably replaced later on by the &quot;mosque suspended on columns&quot;, as al-Muqaddasi called it. This may have been the congregational mosque of al-Muhtariqa.

===== Port =====
Abbasid Raqqa had an important river port, which played a vital role in trade and communications. Raqqa&#x27;s location was ideal for a river port on the upper Euphrates – it was ice-free throughout the year, whereas the early 14th century author al-Dimashqi wrote that the Euphrates sometimes froze further north. Archaeologists have not found evidence of this port, but it may have been south of al-Muhtariqa on the bank of the Euphrates because this would have been a convenient location close to the city&#x27;s main commercial center. Based on Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s account of the famous hadith scholar al-Waqidi&#x27;s visit to Raqqa under Harun al-Rashid, it seems that the port of Raqqa was separated from the city proper by a checkpoint and a &quot;poor, simple guesthouse&quot; (&quot;khān nuzūl&quot;). Most of the boats used on this part of the Euphrates were probably light carriers called &quot;harraq&quot;s.

==== Economy of Abbasid Raqqa ====
Abbasid Raqqa was an important center of glass and ceramics production. Al-Muqaddasi also mentioned a soapmaking industry at Raqqa, which is connected to the glass industry because both make use of alkali. Minerals used as colorants in glassmaking or glazing pottery may have come from Jabal Bishr to the south, since Yaqut al-Hamawi recorded glassmakers in Aleppo using minerals from Jabal Bishr as a colorant in the early 1200s.

According to Julian Henderson, Raqqa is one of the earliest places where an important shift in glassmaking technology occurred at the turn of the 9th century (i.e. around 800). Before, glassmakers had been using mineral alkali as a flux or purifying agent in the glassmaking process. Around 800, though, Raqqawi glassmakers switched to using plant ashes, which were readily available and much cheaper to obtain. On top of that, the plant ashes contained potassium, which lowered the melting temperature for the glass furnaces, reducing production costs even further. Henderson connects this technological change with the famous alchemist Jabir ibn Hayyan, who is known to have had an interest in glassmaking at around the same time, indicating that he may have been a resident of Raqqa during this period.

The port of Raqqa was probably the main entrepôt (shipment point) where food and goods from northern Syria and Mesopotamia were shipped to before then being exported to Baghdad and the rest of Iraq. For example, Ibn al-Adim noted that olive oil from northern Syria was traded in Raqqa and then shipped downstream to Iraq and the Gulf. One passage written by al-Tanukhi recorded a merchant from Baghdad named al-Marwazi (d. 909 or 910) who speculated in olive oil prices at Raqqa.

Raqqa also had a mint for coins and was the only important mint city in the region from the time of Harun al-Rashid onward. The last dated copper coin from Abbasid Raqqa was struck in 892 (copper coins in general had fallen out of widespread use in the region during the late 9th century), but it continued minting gold and silver coins uninterrupted until at least 934–5. No coins from anywhere in the region have been found for the rest of the 10th century, but some sporadic, debased coins from 11th-century Raqqa have been found.

===Decline and period of Bedouin domination===

Raqqa&#x27;s fortunes declined in the late 9th century because of continuous warfare between the Abbasids and the Tulunids, and then with the Shia movement of the Qarmatians. Under the Hamdānids in the 940s, the city declined rapidly. From the late 10th century to the early 12th century, Raqqa was controlled by Bedouin dynasties. The Banu Numayr had their pasture in the Diyār Muḍar, and the Banu Uqayl had their centre in Qal&#x27;at Ja&#x27;bar.

One of the earliest sources to comment on Raqqa&#x27;s decline is Ahmad ibn al-Tayyib al-Sarakhsi (d. 899), as quoted by Yaqut; he visited Raqqa in 884-5 and wrote that parts of its walls were in ruins at the time. However, the markets and presumably the industrial areas of al-Muhtariqa were still in use then.

Raqqa was conquered by the Hamdanids in 942. As a result, it lost its status as an Abbasid garrison city. This had a severe economic impact on Raqqa and the surrounding region: without the soldiers and their disposable income, the demand for food and goods decreased, and local artisans were deprived of potential customers. In the second half of the 10th century, Raqqa appears to have been eclipsed by Harran as the main city in the region based on mint activity and literary references.

With one notable exception, the Numayrid rulers were essentially Bedouin nomads by lifestyle. They had no interest in cities except as sources of income to be exploited. They resided at nomadic camps (called a &quot;ḥillah&quot;, like the city in Iraq) in the pasture outside the cities and delegated administration of the cities to &quot;ghulam&quot; (military slave) governors. During this period of Bedouin rule, the area of settled agriculture shrank while the area allocated to Bedouin pastures grew, and trade routes linking various cities, towns, and villages were threatened by Bedouin raids.

After the death of the Numayrid amir Shabib ibn Waththab in 1039–40, Raqqa and its surrounding fertile pastures became the center of a conflict between the Numayrids and the Mirdasids of Aleppo. Shabib&#x27;s sister as-Sayyidah al-&#x27;Alawiyyah was given Raqqa as an inheritance; through her marriage to the Mirdasid amir Thimal ibn Salih, the city and its territory came under Mirdasid control She ousted the &quot;ghulam&quot; governor of Raqqa appointed by her brothers al-Muta&#x27;in and al-Qawam, who now shared power as Numayrid amirs. However, Shabib&#x27;s young son Mani&#x27; viewed himself as the legitimate heir to his father&#x27;s lands, including Raqqa. By 1056, he had become an adult and gained power as sole Numayrid amir. He sent a demand to Thimal requesting that Raqqa be handed over to him; Thimal refused, and in April 1056 war broke out between the two sides.

Ultimately, though, it was diplomacy that ended up bringing Raqqa back under Mani&#x27;s control. While this was all happening, conflict was brewing between the Fatimid Caliphate (which Thimal was aligned with) and the Seljuk Empire (which Mani&#x27; was aligned with). The Turkic general Arslan al-Basasiri, who supported the Fatimids, had been driven out of Baghdad in December 1055 by the Seljuks and was now continuing anti-Seljuk operations from his new base at al-Rahba nearby. In October 1057, al-Basasiri went north up the Euphrates towards Balis and on the way captured Raqqa from Thimal&#x27;s forces. At the same time, the Fatimid envoy al-Mu&#x27;ayyad fi&#x27;l-Din al-Shirazi met with Mani&#x27; to secure his support for the Fatimids. In return, al-Basasiri handed over control of Raqqa to Mani&#x27;.

Now under Fatimid protection, the Numayrids reached the height of their power. Substantial amounts of Fatimid money were probably transferred into Mani&#x27;s coffers at this point, which allowed him to undertake major construction projects in his cities and thus present himself as the only urban ruler from the Numayrid dynasty (although the Numayrids in general remained nomadic pastoralists). The biggest projects were in his capital of Harran, but he probably also started some in Raqqa as well. He certainly had a mint active in Raqqa at this point — archaeologists found coins struck in his name in Raqqa, dated to 1058, buried under a collapsed wall in the city&#x27;s congregational mosque. Remains of a workshop under the same wall may also indicate that restoration work was started on the mosque around the same time. However, it appears that this work was stopped soon after it started. A possible reason is Mani&#x27;s sudden death in 1062, which left the Numayrids without an effective ruler and dealt a huge blow to their overall political power.

===Second blossoming===
Raqqa experienced a second blossoming, based on agriculture and industrial production, during the Zangid and Ayyubid dynasties during the 12th and the first half of the 13th century. The blue-glazed Raqqa ware dates from this time. The still-visible &quot;Bāb Baghdād&quot; (Baghdad Gate) and the Qasr al-Banāt (Castle of the Ladies) are notable buildings of the period. The famous ruler &#x27;Imād ad-Dīn Zangī, who was killed in 1146, was initially buried in Raqqa, which was destroyed during the 1260s Mongol invasions of the Levant. There is a report on the killing of the last inhabitants of the ruins of the city in 1288.

===Ottoman period===
In the 16th century, Raqqa again entered the historical record as an Ottoman customs post on the Euphrates. The eyalet (province) of Raqqa was created in 1586. However, the capital of the &quot;eyalet&quot; and seat of the Wāli was not Raqqa but Al-Ruha&#x27;, which is about north of Raqqa. In the 17th century the famous Ottoman traveler and author Evliya Çelebi only noticed Arab and Turkoman nomad tents in the vicinity of the ruins. The citadel was partially restored in 1683 and again housed a Janissary detachment; over the next decades the province of al-Raqqah became the centre of the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s tribal settlement (&quot;iskân&quot;) policy. Between 1800 and 1803, the province was governed by the famous Milli Timur Paşa of the Kurdish Milli tribe.

From the 1820s, Raqqa was a place of wintering for the semi-nomadic Arab &#x27;Afadla tribal confederation and was little more than its extensive archeological remains. It was the establishment in 1864 by the Ottomans of the Karakul Janissary garrison, in the south-east corner of the Abbasid enclosure, that led to the revival of the modern city of Raqqa.

The first families that settled in Raqqa were nicknamed &quot;The Ghul&quot; by the surrounding Arab semi-nomadic tribes from whom they bought the right to settle within the Abbasid enclosure, near the Janissary garrison. They used the ancient bricks of the enclosure to build the first buildings of modern Raqqa. They came under the protection of the surrounding Arab semi-nomadic tribes because they feared attacks from other neighboring tribes on their herds. As a result, these families formed two alliances. One joined Kurds of the Mîlan tribe, Arabs of the Dulaim tribe, and possibly Turkomans as well. Most of the Kurdish families came from an area called &quot;Nahid Al-Jilab&quot;, which is northeast of Şanliurfa. Prior to the Syrian Civil War, there were many families in Raqqa that still belonged to the Mîlan tribe such as Khalaf Al-Qasim, Al-Jado, Al-Hani and Al-Shawakh. They claimed the area west of the Ottoman garrison.

The Mîlan tribe had been in Raqqa since 1711. The Ottomans issued an order to deport them from the Nahid Al-Jilab region to the Raqqa area. However most of the tribe was returned to their original home as a result of diseases among their cattle and frequent deaths due to the Raqqa climate. In the mid-18th century, the Ottomans recognised the Kurdish tribal chiefs and appointed Mahmud Kalash Abdi as head of the iskân policy in the region. The tribal chiefs had the power to impose taxes and control over other tribes in the region.

Some of the Kurdish families were displaced to the northern countryside of Raqqa by the Arab &#x27;Annazah tribe, after they began working with the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon.

The other alliance, Asharin, came from the town of Al-Asharah downstream. It included several Arab tribes of the Al-Bu Badran and Mawali tribes. They claimed the area east of the Ottoman garrison.

The Raqqa Museum is housed in a building that was built in 1861 and served as an Ottoman governmental building.

===20th century===
In the early 20th century, two waves of Cherkess refugees from the Caucasian War were granted lands west of the Abbasid enclosure by the Ottomans.

In 1915, Armenians fleeing the Armenian genocide were given safe haven in Raqqa by the Arab Ujayli family. Many moved to Aleppo in the 1920s. Armenians have since then formed the majority of Raqqa&#x27;s Christian community.

In the 1950s, the worldwide cotton boom stimulated unprecedented growth in the city and the recultivation of this part of the middle Euphrates area. Cotton is still the main agricultural product of the region.

The growth of the city led to the destruction or removal of much of the archaeological remains of the city&#x27;s past. The palace area is now almost covered with settlements, as is the former area of the ancient al-Raqqa (today Mishlab) and the former Abbasid industrial district (today al-Mukhtalţa). Only parts were archaeologically explored. The 12th-century citadel was removed in the 1950s (today Dawwār as-Sā&#x27;a, the clock-tower circle). In the 1980s, rescue excavations in the palace area began, as well as the conservation of the Abbasid city walls with the Bāb Baghdād and the two main monuments intra muros, the Abbasid mosque and the Qasr al-Banāt.

=== Syrian civil war ===
In March 2013, during the Syrian civil war, rebels from the Free Syrian Army, Ahrar al-Sham, Al-Nusra Front, and other groups overran the government loyalists in the city during the Battle of Raqqa (2013) and declared it under their control, after they had taken the central square and pulled down the statue of the former president of Syria, Hafez al-Assad. Raqqa was the first provincial capital to fall to the Syrian rebels.

The Al Qaeda-affiliated Al-Nusra Front set up a sharia court at the sports centre and in early June 2013, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant said that it was open to receive complaints at its Raqqa headquarters.

====Migrations====
Migration from Aleppo, Homs, Idlib and other inhabited places to the city occurred as a result of the ongoing civil war in the country, and Raqqa was known as the &quot;hotel of the revolution&quot; by some because of the number of people who moved there.

===&quot;De facto&quot; capital of the Islamic State (January 2014–October 2017)===
ISIL took complete control of Raqqa by 13 January 2014. ISIL proceeded to execute Alawites and suspected supporters of Bashar al-Assad in the city and destroyed the city&#x27;s Shia mosques and Christian churches such as the Armenian Catholic Church of the Martyrs, which was then converted into an ISIL police headquarters and an Islamic centre, tasked to recruit new fighters. The Christian population of Raqqa, which had been estimated to be as much as 10% of the total population before the civil war began, largely fled the city.
On 15 November 2015, France, in response to attacks in Paris two days earlier, dropped about 20 bombs on multiple Islamic State targets in Raqqa.

Pro-government sources said that an anti-IS uprising took place between 5 and 7 March 2016.

On 26 October 2016, US Defense Secretary Ash Carter said that an offensive to take Raqqa from IS would begin within weeks.

The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), supported by the US, launched the Second Battle of Raqqa on 6 June 2017 and declared victory in the city on 17 October 2017. Bombardment by the US-led coalition led to the destruction of most of the city, including civilian infrastructure. Some 270,000 people were said to have fled Raqqa.

====Aftermath====
At the end of October 2017, the government of Syria issued a statement that said: &quot;Syria considers the claims of the United States and its so-called alliance about the liberation of Raqqa city from ISIS to be lies aiming to divert international public opinion from the crimes committed by this alliance in Raqqa province... more than 90% of Raqqa city has been leveled due to the deliberate and barbaric bombardment of the city and the towns near it by the alliance, which also destroyed all services and infrastructures and forced tens of thousands of locals to leave the city and become refugees. Syria still considers Raqqa to be an occupied city, and it can only be considered liberated when the Syrian Arab Army enters it&quot;.

====Control by Syrian Democratic Forces (October 2017–present)====

By June 2019, 300,000 residents had returned to the city, including 90,000 IDPs, and many shops in the city had reopened. Through the efforts of the Global Coalition and the Raqqa Civil Council, several public hospitals and schools have been reopened, public buildings like the stadium, the Raqqa Museum, mosques and parks have been restored, anti-extremism educational centers for youth have been established and the rebuilding and restoration of roads, roundabouts and bridges, installation of solar-powered street lighting, water restoration, demining, re-institution of public transportation and rubble removal has taken place.

However, the Global Coalition&#x27;s funding of the stabilization of the region has been limited, and the Coalition has stated that any large scale aid will be halted until a peace agreement for the future of Syria through the Geneva process has been reached. Rebuilding of residential houses and commercial buildings has been placed solely in the hands of civilians, there is a continued presence of rubble, unreliable electricity and water access in some areas, schools still lacking basic services and the presence of ISIL sleeper cells and IEDs. Some sporadic protests against the SDF have taken place in the city in the summer of 2018.

On 7 February 2019, the SDF media center announced the capture of 63 ISIL operatives in the city. According to the SDF, the operatives were a part of a sleeper cell and were all arrested within a 24-hour time span, ending the day-long curfew that was imposed on the city the day before.

In mid-February 2019, a mass grave holding an estimated 3,500 bodies was discovered below a plot of farmland in the Al-Fukheikha agricultural suburb. It was the largest mass grave discovered post-ISIL rule thus far. The bodies were reported to be the victims of executions when ISIL ruled the city.

In 2019 a project called the &quot;Shelter Project&quot; was launched by international organisations in coordination with the Raqqa Civil Council, providing funding to residents of partially destroyed buildings in order to aid with their reconstruction. In April 2019 the rehabilitation of the Old Raqqa Bridge over the Euphrates was finished. The bridge was originally built by British forces during World War II in 1942. The National Hospital in Raqqa was reopened after rehabilitation work in May 2019.

As a consequence of the 2019 Turkish offensive into north-eastern Syria, the SDF called on the Syrian Arab Army to enter the areas under its rule, including in the area of Raqqa as part of a deal to prevent Turkish troops from capturing any more territory in northern Syria.

==== Scanning for Syria project (2017–2018) ====
The Raqqa Museum had numerous clay tablets with cuneiform writing and many other objects vanishing in the fog of war. A particular set of those tablets were excavated by archaeologists from Leiden at the Tell Sabi Abyad. The excavation team cast silicone rubber moulds of the tablets before the war to create cast copies for subsequent studies in the Netherlands. As the original tablets were looted, those moulds became the only evidence of parts of the 12th century BC in Northern Syria. Having a lifespan of roughly thirty years, the moulds proved not be a durable solution, hence the need for digitization to counter the loss of the originals. Therefore, the &quot;Scanning for Syria&quot; (SfS) project was initiated by the Leiden University and Delft University of Technology under the auspices of the &quot;Leiden-Delft-Erasmus Centre for Global Heritage and Development&quot;. The project received a NWO–KIEM Creatieve Industrie grant to use of 3D acquisition and 3D printing technology to make high quality reproductions of the clay tablets. In collaboration with the Catholic University of Louvain and the Heidelberg University several imaging technologies were explored to find the best solution to capture the precious texts hidden within the concavities of the moulds. In the end, the X-ray micro-CT scanner housed at the TU Delft laboratory of &quot;Geoscience and Engineering&quot; turned out to be a good compromise between time-efficiency, accuracy and text recovery. Accurate digital 3D reconstructions of the original clay tablets were created using the CT data of the silicon moulds. Furthermore, the &quot;Forensic Computational Geometry Laboratory&quot; in Heidelberg dramatically decreased the time for decipherment of a tablet by automatically computing high quality images using the GigaMesh Software Framework. These images clearly show the cuneiform characters in publication quality, which otherwise would have taken many hours to manually craft a matching drawing. The 3D-models and high-quality images have become accessible to both scholar and non-scholar communities worldwide. Physical replicas were produced using 3D-printing. The 3D-prints serve as teaching material in Assyriology classes as well as for visitors of the Rijksmuseum van Oudheden to experience the ingenuity of Assyrian cuneiform writing. In 2020, the SfS received the European Union Prize for Cultural Heritage of the Europa Nostra in the category research.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
In the 6th century, Kallinikos became a center of Assyrian monasticism. &quot;Dayra d&#x27;Mār Zakkā&quot;, or the Saint Zacchaeus monastery, situated on Tall al-Bi&#x27;a, became renowned. A mosaic inscription there is dated to the year 509, presumably from the period of the foundation of the monastery. Daira d&#x27;Mār Zakkā is mentioned by various sources up to the 10th century. The second important monastery in the area was the Bīzūnā monastery or &quot;Dairā d-Esţunā&quot;, the &#x27;monastery of the column&#x27;. The city became one of the main cities of the historical Diyār Muḍar, the western part of the Jazīra.
Michael the Syrian records twenty Syriac Orthodox (Jacobite) bishops from the 8th to the 12th centuries—and had at least four monasteries, of which the Saint Zaccheus Monastery remained the most prominent. In 818, a Syriac synod convened to discuss the controversy around the use of the phrase &quot;the heavenly phrase&quot; as well as to elect a new patriarch; in the end, Dionysius Tel-Maḥroyō was chosen.

In the 9th century, when Raqqa served as capital of the western half of the Abbasid Caliphate, Dayra d&#x27;Mār Zakkā, or the Saint Zacchaeus Monastery, became the seat of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch, one of several rivals for the apostolic succession of the Ancient patriarchal see, which has several more rivals of Catholic and Orthodox churches.

=== Bishopric ===
Callinicum early became the seat of a Christian diocese. In 388, Byzantine Emperor Theodosius the Great was informed that a crowd of Christians, led by their bishop, had destroyed the synagogue. He ordered the synagogue rebuilt at the expense of the bishop. Ambrose wrote to Theodosius, pointing out he was thereby &quot;exposing the bishop to the danger of either acting against the truth or of death&quot;, and Theodosius rescinded his decree.

Bishop Damianus of Callinicum took part in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 and in 458 was a signatory of the letter that the bishops of the province wrote to Emperor Leo I the Thracian after the death of Proterius of Alexandria. In 518 Paulus was deposed for having joined the anti-Chalcedonian Severus of Antioch. Callinicum had a Bishop Ioannes in the mid-6th century. In the same century, a &quot;Notitia Episcopatuum&quot; lists the diocese as a suffragan of Edessa, the capital and metropolitan see of Osrhoene.

=== Titular sees ===
No longer a residential bishopric, Callinicum has been listed by the Catholic Church twice as a titular see, as suffragan of the Metropolitan of the Late Roman province of Osroene : first as Latin - (meanwhile suppressed) and currently as Maronite titular bishopric.

==== Callinicum of the Romans ====
 No later than the 18th century, the diocese was nominally restored as Latin Titular bishopric of Callinicum (Latin), adjective &quot;Callinicen(sis)&quot; (Latin) / Callinico (Curiate Italian).

In 1962 it was suppressed, to establish immediately the Episcopal Titular bishopric of Callinicum of the Maronites (&quot;see below&quot;)

It has had the following incumbents, all of the fitting episcopal (lowest) rank :

* Matthaeus de Robertis (1729.07.06 – death 1733) (born Italy) no prelature
* Meinwerk Kaup, Benedictine Order (O.S.B.) (1733.09.02 – death 1745.07.24) as Auxiliary Bishop of Paderborn (Germany) (1733.09.02 – 1745.07.24)
* Anton Johann Wenzel Wokaun (1748.09.16 – 1757.02.07) as Auxiliary Bishop of Praha (Prague, Bohemia) (1748.09.16 – 1757.02.07)
* Nicolas de La Pinte de Livry, Norbertines (O. Praem.) (born France) (1757.12.19 – death 1795) no prelature

== Religion and culture ==
Raqqa has never been home to a sizeable Shi&#x27;i community. However, since the Iran–Iraq War made the important Shi&#x27;i holy cities of Najaf and Karbala inaccessible to Iranian visitors, Raqqa has gained importance as a Shi&#x27;i pilgrimage destination (accessible via Turkey). The main attractions are the tombs of Ammar ibn Yasir and Uways al-Qarani, two companions of Muhammad who died during the Battle of Siffin. Beginning in 1988 and completed in 2005, an Iranian project oversaw the construction of two new mosques to replace the tombs, making them the largest Shi&#x27;i mausoleums in Syria. The Uways mosque was blown up by the Islamic State in May 2014 for being a &quot;pagan Iranian shrine&quot;.

Uways al-Qarani is an important religious figure in Raqqa, and could be called the city&#x27;s &quot;patron saint&quot;. East of the main city, between the Bab Baghdad and the Siffin cemetery, a large mulberry tree has been dedicated to him for a long time. It is considered a holy site placed under Uways&#x27;s protection. At least until the 1940s, semi-nomadic families would leave their personal belongings at the foot of the tree before beginning their annual summer migration to keep livestock in the Balikh valley. They would return four months later to recollect them. According to elderly Raqqawis, nobody dared take other people&#x27;s belongings lest they anger the saint.

Uways has also been considered a mediator for Raqqawis, especially during unsolved cases of theft or valuable objects disappearing. In such cases, there would be ritual procession involving a large copper cup, called the &quot;Uways Cup&quot;, covered by a green sheet and carried by a public crier (or &quot;dallal&quot;) chosen by the wronged family. The procession would then go through all the streets of Raqqa, with the &quot;dallal&quot; calling out for anyone who knew anything about the theft or missing object was &quot;called upon, by the Uways Cup, to inform me of it or to return it&quot;. During these processions, the entire city would be regarded as a sacred space.

== Media ==
The Islamic State banned all media reporting outside its own efforts, kidnapping and killing journalists. However, a group calling itself Raqqa Is Being Slaughtered Silently operated within the city and elsewhere during this period. In response, ISIL has killed members of the group. A film about the city made by RBSS was released internationally in 2017, premiering and winning an award at that year&#x27;s Sundance Film Festival.

In January 2016, a pseudonymous French author named Sophie Kasiki published a book about her move from Paris to the besieged city in 2015, where she was lured to perform hospital work, and her subsequent escape from ISIL.

== Transportation ==
Prior to the Syrian Civil War the city was served by Chemins de Fer Syriens.

== Climate ==
Raqqa is featuring an arid, hot desert climate.

== Notable locals ==
* Al-Battani, astronomer, astrologer and mathematician (–929)
* Abdul-Salam Ojeili, novelist and politician (1918–2006)
* Harun al-Rashid, fifth Abbasid Caliph (786–809)
* Khalaf Ali Alkhalaf, poet and writer (born 1969)
* Yassin al-Haj Saleh, writer and dissident (born 1961)

<text>Menntaskólinn við Hamrahlíð (, and usually referred to as MH) is a public gymnasium located in Hlíðahverfi, Reykjavík, Iceland. The school was founded in 1966 by the Icelandic Ministry of Education; with the first graduation occurring in 1970. The school&#x27;s first rector was Guðmundur Arnlaugsson.

The school&#x27;s objective is to prepare students for rigorous tertiary studies both locally and in an international environment. It offers four Icelandic-taught programmes leading to the Stúdentspróf qualification: languages, natural sciences, social sciences and performance dance; and one English-taught programme leading to the IB Diploma. The newest addition is an &quot;independent programme&quot; which allows slightly more room for mixing the other ones together. The school also offers evening classes for older students and coordinates annual language tests for foreign students who wish to apply to local schools.

Since foundation, the school was meant to be a pioneer project, and has therefore received relative freedom in advancing its education policy. It was the first in the country to adopt a university-style credit system, which was soon replicated by several other schools and eventually became the basis for all government-regulated upper secondary curricula.

MH is one of the most selective upper secondary schools in the country. It prides itself for its services to students with disabilities and students whose mother tongue is not Icelandic, who also enjoy priority in the selection process.

Some famous Icelanders that once attended MH include Björk, Paul Oscar and Jón Gnarr, the former mayor of Reykjavík.

==Building==

The building that houses MH was built during the Cold War and was therefore also designed to be an emergency shelter and a civic emergency center during a crisis situation. When the volcano Eldfell erupted on 23 January 1973, the school was used to house more than a thousand displaced residents from the Westman Islands, yet the school continued to carry on educational operation through the entire crisis.

Functionally the school is divided into six different areas, each with its own name. The areas are:

===Matgarður===
Matgarður is the school&#x27;s central dining and leisure area, serving more than 600 students a day. A large amount of lunch tables occupy Matgarður, enough for around 350 to 400 students to be seated. The cafeteria is known as Sómalía, and often, during lunch breaks, the members of NFMH announce upcoming school activities. Many famous bands and artists have played in MH, including Booka Shade, Damien Rice, Rage Against the Machine, Swans, Mínus, Ampop, Raein, Kid Carpet and many more. Once a year Matgarður is blessed with holy water that priest Pálmi Matthíasson blessed.

===Miðgarður===

Miðgarður (named after the realm of men in Norse mythology) is on the second floor and has seats and tables for around 200–300 students. It also houses a large percentage of the school&#x27;s computers. The biggest landmark in Miðgarður is undoubtedly Miðgarðsormurinn, a large knitted serpent named for the one who circles Miðgarður in Norse mythology. It has been in creation for many years and is now about 200 metres long.

===Mikligarður===

Mikligarður is the school&#x27;s grand hall, used for graduation, debating competitions (Morfís), choir practices and acting classes.

===Norðurkjallari===

Norðurkjallari (Northern Cellar) is one of the student lounges which also serves as the main social venue for various events. Norðurkjallari houses the meeting room of the students body council, archives office, and the photographers&#x27; dark room. It is also the only place in the school that does not have a wireless network connection, the theory being that students do not study there, the connection would not be used for academic purposes, and therefore it is not justifiable.

Norðurkjallari is divided into different areas, all given historical names. The main entrance hall is called Sómalía, where students are able to buy soft drinks and coffee. This area leads into Texas and Undirheimar, a corridor which leads to Himnaríki (Heaven), Mararþaraborg, Nemó and Atlantis. Further inside, Bessastaðir&#x27;s entrance hides behind a sofa along with the mysterious always-locked door to MH&#x27;s Undirheimar.

===Undirheimar===

Undirheimar (&quot;the Underworld&quot;) is a place hidden beneath Miðgarður and has been shrouded in mystery for many years. Formerly used as a concert space and student lounge, with a full-size Viking ship on the south wall, because of the low ceiling and lack of proper fire exits. Undirheimar are now used for the acting committee, they have acting practises and shows there. The locked doors to Undirheimar can be found in Norðurkjallari, next to Bessastaðir, and next to the yellow lockers beneath Miðgarður&#x27;s north staircase.

===Útgarður===

Finally, Útgarður is a natural haven located in the central section of the school building. This garden often serves as a venue for courses doing outdoor experiments. It also creates a soothing backdrop for the classrooms surrounding the area; indeed, one entire wall of Miðgarður is a window into the world of Útgarður.

===Gym===
The students&#x27; gym was finally finished in 2006 and is located in the new building. It has three separate areas: a gym hall, a fitness center and a multi-purpose room (used for various things like ballet, yoga, etc.)

===Library===
The library was also finished in 2006, and is located on the 2nd floor of the new building. It is currently the largest school library in Iceland, containing around 12.000 books.

==Education==
The school was based on the traditional class system from 1966 to 1972, when a credit based system was adopted, which allowed students to choose their own courses and earn credits towards graduation. Each course awards credits relative to its difficulty, with students averaging 30–35 credits per semester. Graduation requires 205 credits, so it typically takes three years to complete the entire program of study. The credit system has advantages: it gives students more control over their schedule and the order in which they take their courses. MH was the first school to offer evening classes catering to older students, and is the only school in Iceland to offer students the International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma program, which is a two- to three-year intensive program taught in English.

MH is known for its amount of different and versatile subjects. It is thought to be the most diverse gymnasium in Iceland in terms of education. 
Languages available to learn include Icelandic, English, Sign language, Japanese, Danish, Norwegian, Swedish, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Russian, Polish, Latin and recently Chinese

==Student union==
MH&#x27;s social life is mostly the responsibility of the &quot;Nemendafélag Menntaskólans við Hamrahlíð&quot; (&quot;MH Student Association&quot;, usually abbreviated NFMH). The NFMH is one of the largest and most active student associations in Iceland, including various smaller internal clubs and leagues with specific roles and agendas, commonly known as Stórfélagið (&quot;the great alliance&quot;). NFMH is also the publisher of the newspaper &quot;Fréttapési&quot;, which is known for its crude humor and lack of morality. In 2006 Fréttapési was a subject in the news magazine &quot;Kastljós&quot; because of their article &quot;10 songs to rape to&quot;, which caused a public outrage in Iceland.

==Choir==
The school choir, Kór Menntaskólans við Hamrahlíð, was founded by Þorgerður Ingólfsdóttir, in cooperation with the rector, Guðmundur Arnlaugsson, in 1967, a year after the school&#x27;s opening. Students who are members of the choir normally leave the choir upon graduation, but many alumni join Hamrahlíðarkórinn, also conducted by Þorgerður Ingólfsdóttir. Hamrahlíðarkórinn was established in 1982 by members of the school choir who wanted to continue to work and perform with Þorgerður after graduating from MH.

===Mararþaraborg===
Mararþaraborg is a small store run by members of the choir. The store&#x27;s revenues are used to fund various choir activities. The store is named after the Icelandic title of a children&#x27;s book by Ingebrigt Davik called&quot; Æfintýri í Mararþaraborg&quot;, or &quot;Det hende i Taremareby&quot; in the original Norwegian.

==Newspapers==
The student association (NFMH) publishes two student papers, &quot;Beneventum&quot; and the gossip oriented &quot;Fréttapési&quot;. The later has received heavy criticism through the years for harassing students and promoting sexualised freshmen competitions.

<text>Villupuram Chinnaiya Manrayar Ganesamoorthy, better known by his stage name Sivaji Ganesan, (1 October 1928 – 21 July 2001) was an Indian actor and film producer. He was mainly active in Tamil cinema during the latter half of the 20th century. Sivaji Ganesan is acknowledged as one of the greatest Tamil actors of all time and among the most imitated one by other actors. He was known for his versatility and the variety of roles he depicted on screen, which also gave him the Tamil nickname Nadigar Thilagam (). In a career that spanned close to five decades, he had acted in 288 films in Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam and Hindi. Sivaji Ganesan is the only actor in Tamil cinema to have played the lead role in over 250 films.

Ganesan was the first Indian actor to win a &quot;Best Actor&quot; award in an International film festival, the Afro-Asian Film Festival held in Cairo, Egypt in 1960. Many leading South Indian actors have stated that their acting was influenced by Ganesan. In 1997, Ganesan was conferred the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the highest honour for films in India. He was also the first Indian actor to be made a &quot;Chevalier&quot; of the . In addition, he received National Film Award (Special Jury), four Filmfare Awards South and three Tamil Nadu State Film Awards.

Ganesan is remembered as an iconic figure of Tamil cinema. Upon his death, The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; described him as &quot;the Marlon Brando of India&#x27;s film industry&quot;.

== Early life ==
Ganesan was born on 1 October 1928, as the fourth son of Chinnaiya Manrayar and Rajamani Ammal in Villupuram, India in a Kallar family. Early in his career, Ganesan acted under the name V. C. Ganesan. Media outlets said that the initial &#x27;V&#x27; stood for Villupuram, though one of Ganesan&#x27;s sons stated that it stands for Vettaithidal, a village from which their family originates. Without his father&#x27;s consent, Ganesan decided to join a touring stage drama company at the age of seven. At the age of 10, he moved to Tiruchirappalli and joined a drama troupe in Sangiliyandapuram and began to perform in stage plays. From the drama troupe trainers, he was fortunate enough to learn acting and dancing. He was trained in Bharatanatyam, Kathak and Manipuri dance forms.

Ganesan exhibited the ability to remember lengthy lines easily. The group favoured Ganesan to play the lead and he would continue to do so. His portrayal of Shivaji in the stage play &quot;Shivaji Kanda Hindu Rajyam&quot; written by C. N. Annadurai earned him the monicker &quot;Sivaji&quot;, which was conferred on him at a public function presided over by social reformer Periyar. Since then, he was referred to by the name of &quot;Sivaji&quot;.

== Film career ==

=== Early career: 1952–1959 ===
Ganesan made his acting debut in the 1952 Tamil film &quot;Parasakthi&quot;, which was directed by the Krishnan–Panju duo and co-starred actress Pandari Bai. The film became an instant commercial success, running for over 175 days in several theatres, and ran for over 50 days in all the 62 centres it was released, and at the Sri Lanka–based Mailan Theatre, it ran for nearly 40 weeks. Film distributor P. A. Perumal Mudaliar of National Pictures, with the patronage of A. V. Meiyappan of AVM Productions, bought the film rights of &quot;Parasakthi&quot;. P.A. Perumal cast Ganesan after being impressed with his performance as Nur Jahan in the Sakthi Nadaga Sabha play of the same name. It was he who, in 1950, gave Ganesan a flight ticket to Madras for the screen test for &quot;Parasakthi&quot;. Ganesan had simultaneously shot for the Telugu-Tamil bilingual film &quot;Paradesi / Poongothai&quot;, which was supposed to be his actual film to release first, but released much later after Perumal requested its co-producer Anjali Devi to let &quot;Parasakthi&quot; release first, and she agreed. 

&quot;Parasakthi&quot; did not begin well for Ganesan. When shooting began and 2000 feet of the film was shot, Meiyappan was dissatisfied with Ganesan&#x27;s &quot;thin&quot; physique, and wanted him replaced with K. R. Ramasamy. Perumal refused, and Ganesan was retained. Meiyappan was also satisfied with the final results of the film. The initial scenes of Ganesan which he earlier disliked were reshot. Ganesan was paid a monthly salary of 250 (valued at about US$52.5 in 1952) for acting in the film.The script was written by later Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, M. Karunanidhi. Since actors who are well-trained in classical dance can effectively showcase expressions called Nava Rasa on their faces, Ganesan went on to become one of the popular actors in Tamil cinema in the 1950s. His unique voice had a greater appeal. His style of dialogue delivery with a long spell of dialogues—like a poetry recitation with much clarity—earned him critical recognition.

Two factors can be attributed the entry of Ganesan into films: The principal artists in Tamil films during the 1940s and 1950s were Telugus, whose acting was not matched by their dialogue delivery in Tamil. (In fact, Sivaji Ganesan lent his voice to Mukkamala Krishna Murthy, a Telugu actor, for a Tamil film &quot;Niraparathi&quot;. The film was well received by the Tamil audience.) Secondly, the 1950s saw the growth of the Dravidian movement in Tamil Nadu, under the leadership of C. N. Annadurai, and M. Karunanidhi. Their transformation of language skills to films through script writing ensured their instant acceptance. Ganesan&#x27;s entry into films at this stage of popularity was easy and inevitable, and he could establish himself in a better position.

&quot;Andha Naal&quot; (1954) was a trendsetter in Tamil cinema because it had no songs and Ganesan played an anti-hero. The film won the president&#x27;s silver medal the following year. The same year, he co-starred with his competitor M. G. Ramachandran in &quot;Koondukkili&quot;, where he played the antagonist.

=== Donning versatile roles: 1954–1968 ===
His role in the film &quot;Veerapandiya Kattabomman&quot; won him the Best Actor Award at the Afro-Asian Film Festival held in March 1960 at Cairo. Incidentally, Ganesan was also the first Indian actor to get an award for Best Actor abroad. Often considered to be a landmark film in Tamil cinema, &quot;Pasamalar&quot; is arguably one of the best films of Sivaji Ganesan and Savitri together. Once again directed by A Bhimsingh, the film has a cult following and rightly so. When it released in 1961, it became a trendsetter of sorts and was a money spinner at the box-office. Post its release, several films based on a similar theme were made, for example, &quot;Mullum Malarum&quot;. It also won the National Award that year and was remade in several languages.

Uthama Puthiran is the first film to feature Ganesan in dual roles and the first Indian film to have the shots with zoom technique.
Sivaji Ganesan has acted in many Tamil movies co-starring with many popular and talented Tamil actresses of his time. He gave many commercial success films such as 
&quot;Palum Pazhamum&quot;, &quot;Irumbu Thirai&quot;, &quot;Padikkadha Medhai&quot;, &quot;Paava Mannippu&quot;, &quot;Padithal Mattum Podhuma&quot;, &quot;Aalayamani&quot;, &quot;Iruvar Ullam&quot;, &quot;Annai Illam&quot;, 
&quot;Aandavan Kattalai&quot;, &quot;Kappalottiya Thamizhan&quot;, &quot;Mahabharata&quot; (1965), &quot;Kai Koduttha Dheivam&quot;, &quot;Puthiya Paravai&quot; and his 100th film, &quot;Navarathri&quot; whereby ganesan acted nine distinct roles in the film. It is arguably one of Sivaji Ganesan&#x27;s best films in its tribute to the actor.

He had comedic roles in several movies, such as &quot;Kalyanam Panniyum Brahmachari&quot; (1954), &quot;Sabaash Meena&quot; (1958), &quot;Ooty Varai Uravu&quot; (1967), and &quot;Galatta Kalyanam&quot; (1968).

=== Puranic and historical roles: 1965–1969 ===
His portrayal of Lord Shiva in the movie &quot;Thiruvilayadal&quot; (1965) won him many accolades. Ganesan could strike a balance between commercial cinema, Mythological cinema and experimental cinema. His epical portrayals in films such as &quot;Thiruvilayaadal&quot;, &quot;Thiruvarutselvar&quot;, &quot;Saraswati Sabatham&quot;, &quot;Thirumal Perumai&quot; and &quot;Thillana Mohanambal&quot; won him critical acclaim. He played a variety of roles such as freedom fighters, like Tiruppur Kumaran, Bhagat Singh and epic characters like Karna, Bharatha, Narada, Appar, Nayanmars and Alwars. Spanning genres like epics to Crime thrillers; from romantic escapades to comic flicks and action flicks, Ganesan has covered it all.

=== Superstardom – varied roles: 1970–1979 ===

Ganesan played supporting role to Rajendra Kumar in the Hindi film &quot;Dharti&quot; in 1970, which was a remake of his 1969 Tamil film &quot;Sivandha Mann&quot;, in which he played the lead role. In the Hindi version, Ganesan played the role which Muthuraman had played in the original. Several directors such as Krishnan–Panju, T. R. Sundaram, T. R. Ramanna, A. P. Nagarajan, L. V. Prasad, B. R. Panthulu, T. Prakash Rao, D. Yoganand, A. Bhim Singh, K. Shankar, C. V. Sridhar, A. C. Tirulokchandar, P. Madhavan, K. S. Gopalakrishnan, Muktha V.Srinivasan, C. V. Rajendran, and K. Vijayan directed Ganesan in different roles. Jaggayya offered his voice to Sivaji when his movies were dubbed into Telugu.

In the 1960s and 1970s his films have been well received and he was able to deliver constant hits. Some of his famous hits during this period are &quot;Vasantha Maligai&quot;, &quot;Gauravam&quot;, &quot;Thanga Pathakkam&quot; and &quot;Sathyam&quot;. Many of his films inspired remakes in Sinhalese. Films such as &quot;Pilot Premnath&quot; and &quot;Mohana Punnagai&quot; were shot in Sri Lanka, with Sri Lankan actors such as Malini Fonseka and Geetha Kumarasinghe playing the female lead. In 1979, he appeared in the biggest blockbuster of his career, &quot;Thirisoolam&quot; his 200th film, an adaptation of the Kannada film &quot;Shankar Guru&quot; in which Rajkumar had played the lead role.

=== Later and final career: 1980–1999 ===
&quot;Muthal Mariyathai&quot; (1985) won him a Filmfare Award under Best Actor – Tamil category. The 1990s was a period in which Ganesan started enacting matured roles. In 1992, he acted with Kamal Haasan in the critically acclaimed &quot;Thevar Magan&quot;, which won him a Special Mention Award at the 40th National Film Awards. His other films released during this period are &quot;Pasumpon&quot;, &quot;Once More&quot;, &quot;En Aasai Rasave&quot; and &quot;Mannavaru Chinnavaru&quot;, where he was cast in prominent roles. He acted with Mohanlal in the movie &quot;Oru Yathramozhi&quot; (1997). He worked in &quot;Pooparika Varugirom&quot;, which released as his last film before his death, however the penultimate film he worked in before his death was &quot;Padayappa&quot; (1999).

== Mentor ==
Chinna Ponnusamy Padayatchi is the teacher of theatrical arts who trained Ganesan in his troupe. During an interview with V.S. Srinivasan, Ganesan said: &quot;Theatre has taught me everything. My teacher (&quot;Chinna Ponnuswamy Padayachi of Chidambaram&quot;) taught me Bharatnatyam, acting, body movements &amp; practically everything. Padayachi, was himself an outstanding stage actor and I learnt in an atmosphere that was reminiscent of an ashram school.&quot;

==Philanthropic work==
Sivaji Ganesan has made many financial contributions during natural disasters and for the educational development. In 1960, K. Kamaraj introduced the Midday Meal Scheme for which Sivaji Ganesan donated one lakh rupees. Sivaji Ganesan presented a 80 gram gold chain to P. Kakkan, who was living in poverty, and also he donated the entire proceeds from the play &#x27;Thanga Padhakkam&#x27; which is held at the Salem Nehru Auditorium. He also donated a large amount of money during the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965. Sivaji ganesan bought the place where Veerapandiya Kattabomman was hanged in Kayatharu and placed a statue of Veerapandiya Kattabomman at his expense which is still remain a monument. He has donated elephants to many temples like Venkateswara Temple, Brihadisvara Temple, Thanjavur.

== Political career ==

Ganesan started his political career as an activist of the Dravidar Kazhagam. Ganesan joined the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam after it was founded by C. N. Annadurai in 1949. Until 1956, Ganesan was a staunch supporter of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). In the 1950s, however, Sivaji Ganesan was criticized for going &quot;against the stated values of rationalism&quot; during a visit to Tirupathi. In 1956 he left the DMK.

Due to his popularity, he was requested to be part of the Indian National Congress Tamil Nadu. His respect for Kamaraj made him support Congress.
From 1964, Ganesan became a strong supporter of the Indian National Congress. He embraced Congress leader Kamarajar&#x27;s leadership. He was made the Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament by then Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. Indira Gandhi&#x27;s death in 1984 also brought Ganesan&#x27;s political career to an end.

After the death of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) founder and Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu M. G. Ramachandran in 1987, AIADMK broke into two, one headed by his wife V. N. Janaki Ramachandran and other by another Tamil movie star J. Jayalalithaa. Election Commission of India refused to accept either of them as the original AIADMK. Tamil Nadu Congress decided to ally with only United AIADMK. This move was opposed by Sivaji Ganesan and hence he left the party along with his supporters to form the new party Thamizhaga Munnetra Munnani on 10 February 1988. To popularise the party Ganesan produce a movie titled &quot;En Thamizh En Makkal&quot; (My Tamil language and my people). At the time the party was created it was considered to be pro-Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The party opposed the presence of Indian Peace Keeping Force in Sri Lanka stating that the force was trying to wipe out the LTTE and its leader V. Prabhakaran. The party also urged the Government of India to hold talks with the LTTE without any pre- condition. In the 1989 elections, his party lost all of its seats in favor of V. N. Janaki Ramachandran. Sivaji himself was defeated by DMK candidate Durai Chandrasekaran in the Tiruvayaru seat by a difference of 10,643 votes.

He later joined the Janata Dal under VP Singh and rose through the ranks to become the party&#x27;s state president, but his political career came to an end in 1993.

===Political parties===
== Family ==
Ganesan was the fourth son of his family. He had three brothers and one sister. Ganesan married Kamala on 1 May 1952 and had four children. His younger son Prabhu is a notable Tamil actor. Ganesan established a film production company in the late 1950s, now called Sivaji Productions, which is now being looked after by his elder son Ramkumar. He has two daughters Shanthi and Thenmozhi. Two of his grandsons namely Vikram Prabhu and Dushyant Ramkumar have also appeared in films, with Ramkumar&#x27;s son Dushyanth Ramkumar having the stage name of Junior Sivaji. Moreover, Prabhu&#x27;s son Vikram Prabhu debuted in the critically acclaimed film &quot;Kumki&quot; in 2012.

== Death ==
Suffering from respiratory problems, Ganesan was admitted to the Apollo Hospital in Chennai on 1 July 2001. He also had been suffering from a prolonged heart ailment for about 10 years. He died at 7:45 pm (IST) on 21 July 2001 at the age of 72 just three months prior to his 73rd birthday for which he had special plans. A documentary &quot;Parasakthi Muthal Padayappa Varai&quot; was made to commemorate Sivaji Ganesan&#x27;s legacy. He was given a State funeral. His funeral the next day was telecast live on Sun TV and was attended by thousands of viewers, politicians and personalities from the South Indian film fraternity. His eldest son Ramkumar Ganesan, performed his last rites at the Besant Nagar Crematorium, Chennai.

== International recognition ==
When President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt visited India, Sivaji Ganesan was the only individual granted permission by the then-Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, to host a party for Nasser. Nasser was given a number of valuable mementos depicting the civilisation and culture of South India. Sivaji Ganesan was the first artist from India to visit the United States in a cultural exchange programme by the US government. In 1962, Ganesan was invited by the then-US President John F. Kennedy, where he took the role of India&#x27;s cultural ambassador. During his visit there, he was honoured by being made the honorary mayor of Niagara Falls, New York, for one day and was presented the golden key to the city. The only other Indian who has had this honour before Ganesan was Jawaharlal Nehru. Upon returning to India from both Egypt and the US, massive crowds of fans were present at Madras Airport to celebrate his arrival. On 22 March 1976, he travelled to Mauritius on an invitation from Prime Minister Ramagoolam and took part in their independence day celebrations and stayed as their government guest for four days.

During his visit to the United States in June 1995, he visited Columbus, Ohio. Participating in the dinner hosted to honour Ganesan, the mayor of the city, Greg Lashutka honoured him by announcing him as an honorary citizen of Columbus. On the same occasion, the mayor of Mount Vernon read out and gave him a special welcome citation. The Columbus Tamil Sangam was formulated on that day and Ganesan was made the honorary president of that association.

Although Sivaji appeared less in leading roles after the 1980s, his supporting roles were received positively, as in &quot;Thevar Magan&quot;, which won him the National Awards Jury&#x27;s Special Jury award in 1993. Sivaji, incidentally, declined the award.

== Acclaim ==
Sivaji Ganesan is considered one of the best Indian actors of all time. He was also acknowledged as a consummate actor and one of the most imitated ones. He was praised for his body language and his resounding voice and dialogue delivery. Ganesan is known for his versatility and has acted as a blind man in &quot;Palum Pazhamum&quot;, a physically handicapped person in &quot;Bhaaga Pirivinai&quot;, enacting Nine numbers of totally different personas from various social strata and the corresponding body language (gait, voice, facial expression, etc.) in &quot; Navarathiri&quot;, thereby becoming probably the first-time in Indian cinema history as an actor reprising Nine roles in a single film and in extension, inspiring subsequent films (at least) in Tamil like &quot;Navarathinam&quot; (the great MGR – starred), &quot;Dasavatharam&quot; (featuring Kamal Haasan), a man with a scared face as in &quot;Deiva Magan&quot;, a murderer in &quot;Pudhiya Paravai&quot;, or a traitor as in &quot;Andha Naal&quot;, the first movie that had no songs at all.

On 1 October 2021, Google commemorated Ganesan&#x27;s 93rd birth anniversary with a Google Doodle on their Indian homepage.

<text>The NHL entry draft () is an annual meeting in which every franchise of the National Hockey League (NHL) systematically select the rights to available ice hockey players who meet draft eligibility requirements (North American players 18–20 years old and European/international players 18–21 years old; all others enter the league as unrestricted free agents). The NHL entry draft is held once every year, generally within two to three months after the conclusion of the previous regular season. During the draft, teams take turns selecting amateur players from junior or collegiate leagues and professional players from European leagues.

The first draft was held in 1963, and has been held every year since. The NHL entry draft was known as the NHL amateur draft until 1979. The entry draft has only been a public event since 1980, and a televised event since 1984.

Up to 1994, the order was solely determined by the standings at the end of the regular season. In 1995, the NHL draft lottery was introduced where only teams who had missed the playoffs could participate. The lottery winner moved up the draft order a maximum of four places, meaning only the five worst teams, based on regular season points in a given season, could pick first in the draft, and no team in the non-playoff group could move down more than one place. The chances of winning the lottery were weighted towards the teams at the bottom of the regular season standings. From 2013 to 2015, there was no limit of moving up in the draft order, so the lottery winner would automatically receive the first overall pick, and any teams above it in the draft order would still move down one spot. From 2015 to 2020, there were three lottery winners that received the top three picks, and any teams above it in the draft order would move down no more than three spots. In 2021, the lottery system was changed to include two lottery winners, and they received the top two overall picks, and any teams above it in the draft order would move down no more than two spots.

Beginning in 2022, the two lottery winners are limited to move up no more than ten places in the draft order, meaning that only the bottom eleven teams based on regular season points, could win first pick in the draft. If a team outside the bottom eleven teams wins the first draft lottery they move up ten spots (e.g. fourteenth team wins the lottery and moves up to fourth overall) and lowest finishing team from the previous season is then awarded the first overall selection.

== History ==
The first NHL entry draft (at that time known as the &quot;NHL amateur draft&quot;) was held on June 5, 1963, at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal, Quebec. In 1967, NHL president Clarence Campbell and Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) president Fred Page announced a new tentative five-year agreement on August 19, 1966, with several proposed changes to the existing system, effective July 1, 1967. The direct sponsorship of junior teams by the NHL was to be phased out in the upcoming year, and no new sponsored players could be registered or be required to sign a contract restricting movement between teams. The agreement eliminated the A, B and C forms, which had angered the parents of amateur players and were the source of legal action threats when the professional team refused to release a player. Junior-aged players became eligible for the draft once they graduate from junior hockey, or to be signed as a free agent in the year the player reaches his 20th birthday. The NHL agreed to pay development fees to the CAHA for the drafted players. The new agreement came at a time that also leveled the playing field for new NHL clubs in the 1967 NHL expansion.

The NHL briefly changed the drafting age from 20 years old to 18-year-olds in 1974, to compete with the new WHA which was allowing teams to sign underage junior players. The 20-year old rule returned for the 1975 draft.

In 1979, the rules were changed allowing players who had previously played professionally to be drafted. This rule change was made to facilitate the absorption of players from the defunct World Hockey Association. Consequently, the name of the draft was changed from &quot;NHL amateur draft&quot; to &quot;NHL entry draft&quot;. The draft age was also dropped to include 19-year old &quot;underage&quot; players. In 1980, the age was dropped further to 18, so that any player who is between the ages of 18 and 20 is eligible to be drafted. In addition, any non-North American player over the age of 20 can be selected. From 1987 through 1991, 18 and 19-year-old players could only be drafted in the first three rounds unless they met another criterion of experience which required them to have played in major junior, U.S. college and high school, or European hockey.

In 1980, the entry draft became a public event, and was held at the Montreal Forum. Prior to that year the entry draft was conducted in Montreal hotels or league offices and was closed to the general public. The first draft outside of Montreal was held at the Metro Toronto Convention Centre in Toronto, Ontario, in 1985. Live television coverage of the draft began in 1984 when the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation covered the event in both English and French for Canadian audiences. The 1987 entry draft, held at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit, Michigan, was the first NHL draft to be held in the United States. SportsChannel America began covering the event in the United States in 1989.

Prior to the development of the draft, NHL teams sponsored junior teams, and signed prospects in their teens to the junior teams. Players were signed to one of three forms: the &quot;A&quot; form, which committed a player to a tryout; a &quot;B&quot; form, which gave the team an option to sign a player in return for a bonus; and the &quot;C&quot; form, which committed a player&#x27;s professional rights. The &quot;C&quot; form could only be signed by the player at age eighteen or by the player&#x27;s parents, often in exchange for some signing bonus. The first drafts (up until the 1968 amateur draft) were held to assign players who had not signed with an NHL organization before the sponsorship of junior teams was discontinued after 1968.

In October 2023, owners approved a proposal to switch the NHL Draft to a &quot;decentralized&quot; model in line with that of the NBA and NFL drafts, in which only prospects and team representatives will be present in-person at the Draft venue, and business would be conducted remotely from the teams&#x27; front offices. These changes are scheduled to take effect in 2025.

== Selection order and draft lottery ==
The selection order in the NHL entry draft is determined by a combination of lottery, regular season standing, and playoff results. While teams are permitted to trade draft picks both during the draft and prior to it (sometimes several years prior), in all cases, the selection order of the draft picks is based on the original holder of the pick, not a team which may have acquired the pick via a trade or other means. The order of picks discussed in this section always references the original team.

The basic order of the NHL entry draft is determined based on the standings of the teams in the previous season. As with the other major sports leagues, the basic draft order is intended to favour the teams with the weakest performance who presumably need the most improvement in their roster to compete with the other teams. Subject to the results of the NHL draft lottery (discussed below), the teams pick in the same order each round, with each team getting one pick per round.
The basic order of the picks is determined as follows:

# The teams that did not qualify for the playoffs the previous season (picks 1–16)
# The teams that made the playoffs in the previous season but did not win either their division in the regular season or play in the Conference Finals (picks 17–24 up to 28)
# The teams that won their divisions in the previous season but did not play in the Conference Finals (potentially picks 25–28)
# The teams that lose in Conference Finals (picks 29 and 30)
# The team that was the runner-up in the Stanley Cup Finals (pick 31)
# The team that won the Stanley Cup in the previous season (pick 32)

The number of teams in the second and third group depends on whether the Conference finalists also won their division. The teams in each group (other than the Stanley Cup winner and runner up) are ordered within that group based on their point totals in the preceding regular season (with the lowest point total picking first). Tie-breakers are governed by the same rules used to determine ties in the regular season standings. The order of picks 1–16 may change during the first round of the draft based on the results of the NHL draft lottery. In the subsequent rounds, the basic order based on point totals is used.

When teams lose their rights to a first-round draft choice, because that player was not signed to a contract and consequently re-entered the entry draft or became an unrestricted free agent, they are awarded a compensatory draft pick. This selection will be the same numerical choice as the first round draft pick who was not signed, but in the second round. For example, if a team cannot sign the seventh overall first round draft choice, it will receive the seventh pick in the second round of the next draft as compensation.

===Draft lottery===
At the conclusion of the regular season, the 16 teams that did not qualify for the playoffs are entered in a weighted lottery to determine the initial draft picks in the first round. The teams are seeded in the basic draft order based on their regular season point totals. The odds of winning the lottery are weighted on a descending scale that gives the greatest chance of winning to the team with the lowest point total (18.5%), and the worst chance to the team with the highest point total (1.0%).

The prize for winning the draft lottery is to be upgraded to the highest eligible pick in the first round of the draft, with each team that preceded the winner in the basic draft order bumped one pick lower. For example, if the team with the 5th worst point total wins the lottery, it would pick first, and the teams with the worst through 4th-worst records would pick second through fifth. The remaining teams would be unaffected. The teams would return to the basic order for the second and all subsequent rounds.

From its inception through 2015, there was one winner of the lottery; from 1995 to 2012, the team that won the draft lottery moved up no more than four positions in the draft order. If the winner of the lottery was among the five worst teams in a given season, that team won the first pick in the draft. Otherwise, the team will move up no more than four spots, and that team will not receive the first pick in the draft; from 2013 to 2015 the lottery winner received the first pick overall regardless of regular season point totals amongst the non-playoff teams. Beginning with the 2016 draft and lasting until the 2020 draft, the first three selections were determined by the lottery. Any team that did not make the playoffs had a weighted chance to be selected in the first, second, or third slot. Beginning in 2021, only two draws will be held for the first two selections. Starting with the 2022 lottery; the teams winning one of the two lotteries will only be allowed to move up a maximum of ten spots in the draft order, and teams will only be allowed to advance in the draft order because of winning a lottery twice in five years. The two-in-five-years rule only applies to teams jumping up in the draft order. This means the team with the worst record can win any lottery selection an unlimited number of times while the second-worst can do the same for the second overall pick only. The remaining teams maintains their order of selection based on the points accrued the previous season. As the lottery determines the top two slots, no team can drop more than two places from the position established based on previous season point totals.

The NHL draft lottery takes place just before or during the Stanley Cup playoffs and is hosted at the NHL Network&#x27;s studios in Secaucus, New Jersey, from 2020 onwards. The draft lottery previously took place at Sportsnet&#x27;s studios in Toronto from 2015 to 2019, and at TSN&#x27;s studios in Toronto from 2006 to 2014.

The odds for the first overall pick are determined as follows:





== Eligible players ==
All players who will be 18 years old on or before September 15 and not older than 20 years old before December 31 of the draft year are eligible for selection for that year&#x27;s NHL Entry Draft. In addition, non-North American players aged 21 are eligible.

<text>Peter Malcolm de Brissac Dickinson OBE FRSL (16 December 1927 – 16 December 2015) was an English author and poet, best known for children&#x27;s books and detective stories.

Dickinson won the annual Carnegie Medal from the Library Association for both &quot;Tulku&quot; (1979) and &quot;City of Gold&quot; (1980), each being recognised as the year&#x27;s outstanding children&#x27;s book by a British subject. Through 2020 he is one of eight writers to win two Carnegies; no one has won three.
He was also a highly commended runner-up
for &quot;Eva&quot; (1988) and four times a commended runner-up.

For his contributions as a children&#x27;s writer Dickinson was a finalist for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal in 2000.

==Life==

Dickinson was born in Livingstone, Northern Rhodesia (now Zambia), the second of the four sons of a man in the colonial service and a farmer&#x27;s daughter. As a child he loved stories about knights in armour and explorers, such as &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; and &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot;, and read &quot;anything by Kipling&quot;, who influenced his writing greatly.

His parents moved to England so that he and his brothers could attend English schools. His father died suddenly but Dickinson entered Saint Ronan&#x27;s prep school in 1936 with support from the family. His novel &quot;Hindsight&quot; is based on the period in Devon after the school was evacuated from Kent during the war. He entered Eton College in 1941.

Dickinson remained at Eton until 1946. After completing his national service (1946–48), he studied at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1951. For seventeen years he worked as assistant editor, resident poet and reviewer for &quot;Punch&quot; magazine. His first two books were published in 1968 and were very well received, one mystery for adults and one science fiction for children. He completed sequels to both debut novels and left &quot;Punch&quot; to be a full-time author next year. He continued to write poetry for entertainment and occasionally on commission.

Dickinson married Mary Rose Barnard in 1953; the couple had two daughters and two sons including the children&#x27;s editor and publisher Philippa Dickinson and the writer John Dickinson. Mary Rose died in 1988.

In 1983, Dickinson had met Robin McKinley, an American author of fantasy, some written for children. After a long friendship, they married in 1991. She said in 2009 that she cannot judge the literary work of people she likes personally, but: &quot;Fortunately I had been passionately devoted to his books years before I met him so I can merely go on thinking they&#x27;re wonderful and he&#x27;s brilliant now.&quot;

Dickinson was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature in 1999 and appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2009 Birthday Honours. He was also chairman of the Society of Authors.

For years he listed manual labour as one pastime; at 85 he listed only bridge and gardening. He died after an illness on 16 December 2015, his 88th birthday.

==Writer==

Dickinson published almost fifty books, which fall into three general categories: crime fiction for adults (including the James Pibble series), speculative and supernatural fiction for older children, and simpler children&#x27;s books. One of his few other books was the collection &quot;Chance, Luck and Destiny&quot; (1975), which he calls &quot;prose and verse, fact and fiction, on the themes of the title&quot;. It won the second annual Boston Globe–Horn Book Award for children&#x27;s nonfiction in 1977.

The &quot;Changes&quot; trilogy comprises three early books for children, &quot;The Weathermonger&quot;, &quot;Heartsease&quot; and &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Children&quot; (1968 to 1970). It was heavily adapted in 1975 as a BBC TV series, &quot;The Changes&quot;. The trilogy was written in reverse order: &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Children&quot; is actually the first book in terms of the trilogy&#x27;s chronology, &quot;Heartsease&quot; the second, and &quot;The Weathermonger&quot; the third.

Dickinson&#x27;s first two mysteries both won the Crime Writers&#x27; Association&#x27;s Gold Dagger, &quot;Skin Deep&quot; in 1968 and &quot;A Pride of Heroes&quot; in 1969. He was at least as successful with his children&#x27;s books. He won the 1977 Guardian Children&#x27;s Fiction Prize for &quot;The Blue Hawk&quot;, an award judged by British children&#x27;s writers, which no author may win twice. For &quot;Tulku&quot; (1979) he won both the Whitbread Children&#x27;s Book Award and finally the Carnegie Medal after being a commended runner-up three times. He won the Carnegie again next year for &quot;City of Gold&quot;. In 1982 he was named to the International Board of Books for Young People Honor List for &quot;Tulku&quot;, and &quot;The Iron Lion&quot; was selected one of New York Times Notable Books. &quot;Eva&quot; (1988) was a runner-up for both the Carnegie (highly commended) and the Horn Book Award. In 2008 it won the Phoenix Award from the Children&#x27;s Literature Association as the best English-language children&#x27;s book that did not a major award when it was originally published twenty years earlier. Dickinson and &quot;The Seventh Raven&quot; (1981) had won the same award in 2001.
&quot;The Kin&quot; (1998) made the Whitbread Award shortlist.

&quot;City of Gold and other stories from the Old Testament&quot; (Gollancz, 1980), illustrated by Michael Foreman, was a &quot;radical&quot; retelling of 33 stories, according to the retrospective online Carnegie Medal citation. &quot;It is set in a time before the Bible was written down, when its stories where handed from generation to generation by the spoken word.&quot; Illustrator Foreman was highly commended runner-up for the Library Association&#x27;s companion Kate Greenaway Medal.

A pair of alternative history novels, &quot;King and Joker&quot; (1976) and &quot;Skeleton-in-Waiting&quot; (1989), are based on the premise that Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence (1864–1892) survives and ultimately reigns as Victor I of England.

The biennial Hans Christian Andersen Award conferred by the International Board on Books for Young People is the highest recognition available to a writer or illustrator of children&#x27;s books. Dickinson was one of five finalists for the writing award in 2000 (and the British nominee in 1988 as well).

A collection of his own previously published and new poetry, &quot;The Weir: Poems by Peter Dickinson&quot;, was published on the occasion of his 80th birthday in 2007, as a gift from his four children.

His last works were &quot;Earth and Air&quot; (Small Beer Press, 2012), and &quot;In the Palace of the Khans&quot; (Peter Dickinson Books, 2012). The former continues the &quot;Tales of Elemental Spirits&quot; whose first two volumes &quot;Water&quot; and &quot;Fire&quot; comprise stories by both Dickinson and Robin McKinley.

Dickinson&#x27;s literary archive is one of those in the Seven Stories National Centre for Children&#x27;s Books.

==Motion pictures==

In 1982, Rankin/Bass Productions released &quot;The Flight of Dragons&quot;, a made-for-TV animated film, aspects of which were based on Dickinson&#x27;s book. The character design in the film bears a resemblance to the illustrations in the book. However, the novel &quot;The Dragon and the George&quot; by Gordon R. Dickson was the inspiration for the film&#x27;s plot. One of the main characters is Peter Dickinson, the book&#x27;s author himself struggling to complete his text.

<text>Jas Hennessy &amp; Cie., commonly known simply as Hennessy (), is a French producer of cognac, which has its headquarters in Cognac, France.

It is one of the best-known cognac houses, along with Martell, Courvoisier, and Rémy Martin, who together make around 45% of the world&#x27;s cognac. Hennessy sells approximately 102 million bottles of its cognacs per year, making it the world&#x27;s largest cognac producer, and in 2017 its sales represented around 60% of the US cognac market. As well as distilling cognac &quot;eaux-de-vie&quot; itself, the company also acts as a &quot;négociant&quot;.

The brand is owned by Moët Hennessy since a champagne &amp; cognac merger in the early seventies, which is in turn owned by LVMH (66%) and Diageo (34%), Diageo acting as a controlling shareholder. Hennessy pioneered several industry-standard practices in the world of cognac, and its association with luxury has made it a regular point of reference in popular culture, especially in hip hop.

==History==

The Hennessy cognac distillery was founded by Irish Jacobite military officer Richard Hennessy in 1765, who had served in the army of Louis XV. The Hennessy family&#x27;s seat was Killavullen near Mallow, and was closely related in County Cork to the Nagle, Burke and Roche families. He retired to the Cognac region, and began distilling and exporting brandies, first to Britain and his native Ireland, closely followed by the United States. In 1813 Richard Hennessy&#x27;s son James Hennessy gave the company its trading name, Jas Hennessy &amp; Co. He was also responsible for choosing Jean Fillioux as the house&#x27;s Master Blender. A member of the Fillioux family has occupied the role ever since, a business relationship that has lasted eight generations and more than 250 years.

Hennessy became the world&#x27;s leading exporter of brandy in the 1840s, a status it has never lost. By 1860, it represented one out of every four bottles of cognac sold internationally. Hennessy also instituted several of the conventions now used across the cognac industry. It was one of the first marques to sell bottles rather than casks of cognac, a process that helped it survive the Great French Wine Blight in the mid-nineteenth century. It was also the first cognac house to use star ratings, and the gradings V.S.O.P. and XO, which are today used by most other cognac producers.

The V.S.O.P. designation was first applied in 1817, when the Prince Regent (later King George IV) of Britain asked Hennessy to create a &quot;very superior old pale&quot; cognac, a description that had previously been applied to sherries. Maurice Hennessy, the grandson of Richard Hennessy, then introduced a star-based classification of cognac qualities in 1865 (a system simultaneously adopted by Hennessy&#x27;s competitor Martell), which remained the industry standard of cognac age designation until the 1960s. Maurice Hennessy also created the XO (&quot;extra old&quot;) designation in 1870, for cognacs which had undergone prolonged cask maturation.

A branch of the Hennessy family moved from France to England in the early 1900s. It established itself in the Army and in English politics, eventually earning the title of Baron Windlesham. Although family ties are alive, the English branch is no longer involved in the cognac business.

In 1944 Kilian Hennessy, a fifth-generation direct descendant of Richard Hennessy, began assisting his cousin Maurice Hennessy in running the business. Kilian Hennessy had intended to be a banker, but instead went on to position Hennessy as an international brand, travelling to Ireland, the United States and Asia to promote the brand. He first visited China in 1946, and the nation has since become the world&#x27;s second-largest cognac market. In 1947, Hennessy&#x27;s business relationship with Martell also came to a close, after the death of Maurice Firino-Martell.

Hennessy has also become a key part of major luxury conglomerates. In 1971 Kilian Hennessy spearheaded the company&#x27;s merger with Moët et Chandon, to create Moët Hennessy which eventually went public and thrived financially. Moët Hennessy then announced a merger with Louis Vuitton, which already owned champagne brands, in 1987, creating the world&#x27;s largest luxury brand conglomerate, Louis Vuitton • Moët-Hennessy or LVMH.

In 1988, a management crisis led to the group&#x27;s takeover by Bernard Arnault, owner of the haute couture house Christian Dior, with the support of the Guinness brewery group. The so-called &quot;LVMH affair&quot; was so controversial in France that French President François Mitterrand referenced it in a televised address.

Kilian Hennessy remained on the company&#x27;s advisory board until his death in 2010 at the age of 103. An eighth generation representative of the Hennessy dynasty, Maurice-Richard Hennessy, acts as one of the brand&#x27;s global ambassadors. He had originally trained as a farmer before entering the family business.

From 2018 onward, Hennessy experienced production shortages caused in part by increased demand, bottle shortages, and frosts.

==Marketing==

Hennessy holds the largest collection of cognac &quot;eaux-de-vie&quot; in the world, with more than 470,000 casks in its cellars. Through a process of blending and maturation of varying lengths, it makes several distinct gradings of cognac. As well as its V.S and V.S.O.P. gradings, which make up the majority of its sales, Hennessy is known for expensive specialist cognacs, some of which are still blended by the Fillioux family.

Limited editions of Hennessy can contain more than one hundred different &quot;eaux-de-vie,&quot; some of which can be centuries old; they are traditionally accompanied with luxurious trimmings such as custom-made boxes and hand-blown carafes. A bottle of Richard Hennessy, for example, is priced at around USD$7,000, and comes in a Baccarat crystal decanter with matching glasses, a fusil, and a tray, all designed by the architect Daniel Libeskind.

Since 2009, Hennessy has released a number of collectible editions to mark anniversaries, special occasions, or collaborations with artists, designers and organisations, such as the NBA. It has collaborated with Zhang Enli, Les Twins, Refik Anadol, Kaws and Marc Newson among others.

Hennessy is also used as an ingredient in cocktails and mixed drinks, and is commonly served in nightclubs and bars. The company has launched a number of new products aimed at this on-premises market, including Pure White, Hennessy Black and Fine de Cognac, and promoted them accordingly. The rapper Nas has acted as a brand ambassador for the brand.

Hennessy has a substantial consumer base among African Americans, who drink the majority of the cognac consumed in the United States. Accordingly, the brand has also marketed itself with initiatives around black entrepreneurship and Black History Month.

==In popular culture==
Hennessy has a long-standing relationship with African American culture, especially hip hop. It has been described as &quot;synonymous with rap music and African Americans, who are the brand&#x27;s major consumers and advocates&quot;. While music, especially the 2004 2Pac song &quot;Hennessy&quot; has been credited with popularising the drink, some historians have pointed to a much older relationship, which began when African American servicemen encountered cognac in France during World War I and World War II.

Hennessy has actively pursued this consumer group for decades. It targeted minority audiences as early as the 1950s, when it placed advertisements in African American magazines like &quot;Ebony&quot; and &quot;Jet&quot;, used African American models, and hired African American employees. By some estimates more than two thirds of Hennessy sold in the United States is consumed by African Americans. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;Henny&quot;.

Hennessy appears frequently in the lyrics of popular music, and by one estimate the words &quot;Hennessy&quot; or &quot;cognac&quot; are referenced in more than 1,000 songs.

Some notable examples include &quot;KC Tea&quot; (2010) by Tech N9ne, &quot;Hennessey&quot; (2004) by 2Pac, &quot;Hennesey n Buddah&quot; (2000) by Snoop Dogg, &quot;Hennessy&quot; (2021) by Kodoku, &quot;Love Scars&quot; (2017) by Trippie Redd, &quot;We Be Burnin&#x27;&quot; (2005) by Sean Paul, &quot;Boombayah&quot; by K-pop group Blackpink, &quot;Hennessy and Sailor Moon&quot; (2016) by Yung Lean, &quot;The Humpty Dance&quot; (1990) by Digital Underground, &quot;Pass Me Da Green&quot; by Master P (1997), &quot;Moodz&quot; by Blackbear, &quot;Red Bull &amp; Hennessy&quot; by Jenny Lewis, &quot;6 Inch&quot; by Beyoncé, &quot;Blame It&quot; by Jamie Foxx, &quot;Henny &amp; Gingerale&quot; by Mayer Hawthorne, &quot;N.Y. State of Mind&quot; by Nas, &quot;Heaven &amp; Hennessey&quot; by Nana, &quot;Whistle&quot; by D-Block Europe, &quot;Better Now&quot;, &quot;Pain&quot; by 2Pac and &quot;Rockstar (ft. 21 Savage)&quot; by Post Malone. The cognac is referenced in the chorus of the Drake single &quot;One Dance&quot; (2016), which reached #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. The Rap duo Mobb Deep also wear Hennessy jerseys in the music video for their 1995 hit single &quot;Shook Ones (Part II)&quot;.

In a 2019 interview with the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, Maurice-Richard Hennessy said that “the word ‘Hennessy’ goes well in a song&quot;, and disclosed that he had met several rap artists, who he thought were &quot;nice people&quot;. He told the paper that &quot;they often come from poor backgrounds and ask me about recommendations, how to drink it, how it&#x27;s made.”

Hennessy is the drink of choice for Blues musician Del Paxton in the movie &quot;That Thing You Do!&quot; In the James Bond film &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;, Bond, rescued by a St. Bernard in Switzerland, curtly dismisses the dog and tells him to bring five star Hennessy.

At the 2009 VMAs interruption, Kanye West was reportedly intoxicated after drinking Hennessy and other various alcoholic drinks before his infamous interruption of Taylor Swift.

==Hennessy Literary Awards==
Hennessy sponsors the New Irish Writing competition in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, and the associated annual Hennessy Literary Award, that has launched such Irish writers as Joseph O&#x27;Connor, Dermot Bolger, Colm Ó Clúbhán, Patrick McCabe, Colum McCann, Frank McGuinness, Anne Enright, Hugo Hamilton, Dermot Healy and Neil Jordan.

==Notable consumers==
Hennessy was the favourite drink of Kim Jong-il, former Supreme Leader of North Korea. Hennessy once reported that Kim spent over $700,000 a year on Paradis cognac.

<doc id="858993" wikidata="Q3234113" url="?curid=858993" title="Dependency hell">
<text>Dependency hell is a colloquial term for the frustration of some software users who have installed software packages which have dependencies on specific versions of other software packages.

The dependency issue arises when several packages have dependencies on the same &quot;shared&quot; packages or libraries, but they depend on different and incompatible versions of the shared packages. If the shared package or library can only be installed in a single version, the user may need to address the problem by obtaining newer or older versions of the dependent packages. This, in turn, may break other dependencies and push the problem to another set of packages.

== Problems ==
Dependency hell takes several forms:

; Many dependencies
: An application depends on many libraries, requiring lengthy downloads, large amounts of disk space, and being very portable (all libraries are already ported enabling the application itself to be ported easily). It can also be difficult to locate all the dependencies, which can be fixed by having a repository (see below). This is partly inevitable; an application built on a given computing platform (such as Java) requires that platform to be installed, but further applications do not require it. This is a particular problem if an application uses a small part of a big library (which can be solved by code refactoring), or a simple application relies on many libraries.
; Long chains of dependencies
: If depends on , which depends on , ..., which depends on . This is distinct from &quot;many dependencies&quot; if the dependencies must be resolved manually, e.g., on attempting to install , the user is prompted to install first and on attempting to install , the user is then prompted to install , and so on. Sometimes, however, during this long chain of dependencies, conflicts arise where two different versions of the same package are required (see conflicting dependencies below). These long chains of dependencies can be solved by having a package manager that resolves all dependencies automatically. Other than being a hassle (to resolve all the dependencies manually), manual resolution can mask dependency cycles or conflicts.
; Conflicting dependencies
: Solving the dependencies for one software may break the compatibility of another in a similar fashion to whack-a-mole. If depends on , and depends on , and different versions of cannot be simultaneously installed, then and cannot simultaneously be used (or installed, if the installer checks dependencies). When possible, this is solved by allowing simultaneous installations of the different dependencies. Alternatively, the existing dependency, along with all software that depends on it, must be uninstalled in order to install the new dependency. A problem on Linux systems with installing packages from a different distributor is that the resulting long chain of dependencies may lead to a conflicting version of the C standard library (e.g. the GNU C Library), on which thousands of packages depend. If this happens, the user will be prompted to uninstall all of those packages.
; Circular dependencies
: If depends upon and can&#x27;t run without a specific version of , but , in turn, depends upon and can&#x27;t run without a specific version of , then upgrading any application will break another. This scheme can be deeper in branching. Its impact can be quite heavy if it affects core systems or update software itself: a package manager (A), which requires specific run-time library (B) to function, may break itself (A) in the middle of the process when upgrading this library (B) to next version. Due to incorrect library (B) version, the package manager (A) is now broken, thus no rollback or downgrade of library (B) is possible. The usual solution is to download and deploy both applications, sometimes from within a temporary environment.
; Package manager dependencies
: It is possible for dependency hell to result from installing a prepared package via a package manager (e.g. APT), but this is unlikely since major package managers have matured and official repositories are well maintained. This is the case with current releases of Debian and major derivatives such as Ubuntu. Dependency hell, however, can result from installing a package directly via a package installer (e.g. RPM or dpkg).
;Diamond dependency
:When a library A depends on libraries B and C, both B and C depend on library D, but B requires version D.1 and C requires version D.2. The build fails because only one version of D can exist in the final executable. 
: Package managers like yum are prone to have conflicts between packages of their repositories, causing dependency hell in Linux distributions such as CentOS and Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

== Solutions ==

; Removing dependencies
: Many software libraries are written in a generous way, in an attempt to fulfill most users&#x27; needs, but sometimes only a small portion of functions are required in the host code. By examining the source, the functionality can be rewritten in a much more compact way (with respect to the license). In general, this can significantly reduce the application code, reduce later maintenance costs, and improve the software writing skills of programmers.

; Version numbering
: A very common solution to this problem is to have a standardized numbering system, wherein software uses a specific number for each version (aka &quot;major version&quot;), and also a subnumber for each revision (aka &quot;minor version&quot;), e.g.: 10.1, or 5.7. The major version only changes when programs that used that version will no longer be compatible. The minor version might change with even a simple revision that does not prevent other software from working with it. In cases like this, software packages can then simply request a component that has a particular major version, and &quot;any&quot; minor version (greater than or equal to a particular minor version). As such, they will continue to work, and dependencies will be resolved successfully, even if the minor version changes. Semantic Versioning (aka &quot;SemVer&quot;) is one example of an effort to generate a technical specification that employs specifically formatted numbers to create a software versioning scheme.
;Private per application versions
: Windows File Protection introduced in Windows 2000 prevented applications from overwriting system DLLs. Developers were instead encouraged to use &quot;Private DLLs&quot;, copies of libraries per application in the directory of the application. This uses the Windows search path characteristic that the local path is always prioritized before the system directory with the system wide libraries. This allows easy and effective shadowing of library versions by specific application ones, therefore preventing dependency hell.
: PC-BSD, up to and including version 8.2, a predecessor of TrueOS (an operating system based on FreeBSD) places packages and dependencies into self-contained directories in &quot;/Programs&quot;, which avoids breakage if system libraries are upgraded or changed. It uses its own &quot;PBI&quot; (Push Button Installer) for package management.
; Side-by-side installation of multiple versions
: The version numbering solution can be improved upon by elevating the version numbering to an operating system supported feature. This allows an application to request a module/library by a unique name &quot;and&quot; version number constraints, effectively transferring the responsibility for brokering library/module versions from the applications to the operating system. A shared module can then be placed in a central repository without the risk of breaking applications which are dependent on previous or later versions of the module. Each version gets its own entry, side by side with other versions of the same module.
: This solution is used in Microsoft Windows operating systems since Windows Vista, where the Global Assembly Cache is an implementation of such a central registry with associated services and integrated with the installation system/package manager. Gentoo Linux solves this problem with a concept called slotting, which allows multiple versions of shared libraries to be installed.
; Smart package management
: Some package managers can perform smart upgrades, in which interdependent software components are upgraded at the same time, thereby resolving the major number incompatibility issue too.
: Many current Linux distributions have also implemented repository-based package management systems to try to solve the dependency problem. These systems are a layer on top of the RPM, dpkg, or other packaging systems that are designed to automatically resolve dependencies by searching in predefined software repositories. Examples of these systems include Apt, Yum, Urpmi, ZYpp, Portage, Pacman and others. Typically, the software repositories are FTP sites or websites, directories on the local computer or shared across a network or, much less commonly, directories on removable media such as CDs or DVDs. This eliminates dependency hell for software packaged in those repositories, which are typically maintained by the Linux distribution provider and mirrored worldwide. Although these repositories are often huge, it is not possible to have every piece of software in them, so dependency hell can still occur. In all cases, dependency hell is still faced by the repository maintainers.
; Installer options
: Because different pieces of software have different dependencies, it is possible to get into a vicious circle of dependency requirements, or an ever-expanding tree of requirements, as each new package demands several more be installed. Systems such as Debian&#x27;s Advanced Packaging Tool can resolve this by presenting the user with a range of solutions, and allowing the user to accept or reject the solutions, as desired.
; Easy adaptability in programming
: If application software is designed in such a way that its programmers are able to easily adapt the interface layer that deals with the OS, window manager or desktop environment to new or changing standards, then the programmers would only have to monitor notifications from the environment creators or component library designers and quickly adjust their software with updates for their users, all with minimal effort and a lack of costly and time-consuming redesign. This method would encourage programmers to pressure those upon whom they depend to maintain a reasonable notification process that is not onerous to anyone involved.
; Strict compatibility requirement in code development and maintenance
: If the applications and libraries are developed and maintained with guaranteed downward compatibility in mind, any application or library can be replaced with a newer version at any time without breaking anything. While this does not alleviate the multitude of dependency, it does make the jobs of package managers or installers much easier.
; Software appliances
: Another approach to avoiding dependency issues is to deploy applications as a software appliance. A software appliance encapsulates dependencies in a pre-integrated self-contained unit such that users no longer have to worry about resolving software dependencies. Instead the burden is shifted to developers of the software appliance. Containers and their images (such as those provided by Docker and Docker Hub) can be seen as an implementation of software appliances.
; Portable applications
: An application (or version of an existing conventional application) that is completely self-contained and requires nothing to be already installed. It is coded to have all necessary components included, or is designed to keep all necessary files within its own directory, and will not create a dependency problem. These are often able to run independently of the system to which they are connected. Applications in RISC OS and the ROX Desktop for Linux use application directories, which work in much the same way: programs and their dependencies are self-contained in their own directories (folders).
: This method of distribution has also proven useful when porting applications designed for Unix-like platforms to Windows, the most noticeable drawback being multiple installations of the same shared libraries. For example, Windows installers for gedit, GIMP, and HexChat all include identical copies of the GTK toolkit, which these programs use to render widgets. On the other hand, if different versions of GTK are required by each application, then this is the correct behavior and successfully avoids dependency hell.

==Platform-specific==
On specific computing platforms, &quot;dependency hell&quot; often goes by a local specific name, generally the name of components.

* DLL Hell a form of dependency hell occurring on 16-bit Microsoft Windows.
* Extension conflict a form of dependency hell occurring on the classic Mac OS.
* JAR hell a form of dependency hell occurring in the Java Runtime Environment before build tools like Apache Maven solved this problem in 2004.
* RPM hell a form of dependency hell occurring in the Red Hat distribution of Linux and other distributions that use RPM as a package manager.

<doc id="859006" wikidata="Q415062" url="?curid=859006" title="Isobutyric acid">
<text>Isobutyric acid, also known as 2-methylpropanoic acid or isobutanoic acid, is a carboxylic acid with structural formula (CH3)2CHCOOH. It is an isomer of butyric acid. It is classified as a short-chain fatty acid. Deprotonation or esterification gives derivatives called isobutyrates.

Isobutyric acid is a colorless liquid with a somewhat unpleasant odor. It is soluble in water and organic solvents. It is found naturally in carobs (&quot;Ceratonia siliqua&quot;), in vanilla, and in the root of &quot;Arnica dulcis&quot;, and as an ethyl ester in croton oil.

==Production==
Isobutyric acid is manufactured by the oxidation of isobutyraldehyde, which is a byproduct of the hydroformylation of propylene.

It can also be prepared by the high pressure hydrocarboxylation (Koch reaction) from propylene:
:CH3CH=CH2 + CO + H2O → (CH3)2CHCO2H

Isobutyric acid can also be manufactured commercially using engineered bacteria with a sugar feedstock.

===Laboratory methods===
Many routes are known including the hydrolysis of isobutyronitrile with alkalis and the oxidation of isobutanol with potassium dichromate in the presence of sulfuric acid. In the presence of proton donors, the action of sodium amalgam on methacrylic acid also gives isobutyric acid.

==Reactions==
The acid reacts as a typical carboxylic acid: it can form amide, ester, anhydride, and chloride derivatives. Its acid chloride is commonly used as the intermediate to obtain the others. When heated with a chromic acid solution it is oxidized to acetone. Alkaline potassium permanganate oxidizes it to &quot;α&quot;-hydroxyisobutyric acid, (CH3)2C(OH)-CO2H.

==Uses==
Isobutyric acid and its volatile esters are present naturally in a wide variety of foods and, at varying concentrations, can impart a range of flavors. The compound&#x27;s safety as a food additive was reviewed by an FAO and WHO panel, who concluded that there were no concerns at the likely levels of intake.

==Biology==
In humans, isobutyric acid is a minor product of the gut microbiome and can also be produced by metabolism of its esters found in food. It has a characteristic odor like rancid butter (4-carbon organic compounds take the root, butyl, which is in turn from butyric which is in turn from the Latin word for butter and the Greek, βούτυρον) but anosmia for it has been reported in about 2.5% of people.

The metabolism of isobutyric acid in plants has been studied.

Isobutyric acid, along with several other short-chain fatty acids collectively known as &quot;copulins,&quot; is found abundantly in human vaginal secretions. Levels of isobutyric acid fluctuate throughout the menstrual cycle, and it is hypothesized to act as an indicator of ovulatory status. Similar cycles are observed in chimpanzees.

<doc id="859009" wikidata="Q1188138" url="?curid=859009" title="Turbinia">
<text>Turbinia is the first steam turbine-powered steamship. Built as an experimental vessel in 1894, and easily the fastest ship in the world at that time, &quot;Turbinia&quot; was demonstrated dramatically at the Spithead Navy Review in 1897 and set the standard for the next generation of steamships, the majority of which would be turbine powered. The vessel is currently located at the Discovery Museum in Newcastle upon Tyne, North East England, while her original powerplant is located at the Science Museum in London.

==Development==
Charles Algernon Parsons invented the modern steam turbine in 1884, and having foreseen its potential to power ships, he set up the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company in 1897. To develop this, he had the experimental vessel &quot;Turbinia&quot; built in a light design of steel by the firm of Brown and Hood, based at Wallsend on Tyne in the North East of England.

The Admiralty was kept informed of developments, and &quot;Turbinia&quot; was launched on 2 August 1894. Despite the success of the turbine engine, initial trials with one propeller were disappointing. After discovering the problem of cavitation and constructing the first cavitation tunnel, Parsons&#x27; research led to his fitting three axial-flow turbines to three shafts, each shaft in turn driving three propellers, giving a total of nine propellers. In trials, this achieved a top speed of more than , so that &quot;the passengers aboard would be convinced beyond all doubt &quot;Turbinia&quot; was Charles Parsons&#x27; winning North Sea greyhound&quot;.

The turbines were directly driven, as geared turbines were not introduced until 1910. Even after the introduction of geared turbines, efficiency of even the largest axial steam turbines was still below 12% and &quot;Turbinia&quot; was even less efficient. Despite this, it was a dramatic improvement over predecessors.

==Demonstration==

Parsons&#x27; ship turned up unannounced at the Navy Review for the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria at Spithead, on 26 June 1897, in front of the Prince of Wales, foreign dignitaries, and Lords of the Admiralty. As an audacious publicity stunt, &quot;Turbinia&quot;, which was much faster than any other ship at the time, raced between the two lines of navy ships and steamed up and down in front of the crowd and princes, while easily evading a navy picket boat that tried to pursue her, almost swamping it with her wake.

Photographer and cinematographer Alfred J. West took several photographs of &quot;Turbinia&quot; travelling at full speed at the review. He was subsequently invited by Sir Charles Parsons to film and photograph the vessel within the River Tyne and the adjacent North Sea; the pictures captured remain the defining image of &quot;Turbinia&quot; at speed.
From this clear demonstration of her speed and power and after further high speed trials attended by the Admiralty, Parsons set up the Turbinia Works at Wallsend, which then constructed the engines for two prototype turbine-powered destroyers for the Navy, and , that were launched in 1899. Both vessels were lost to accidents in 1901, but although their losses slowed the introduction of turbines, the Admiralty had been convinced. In 1900, &quot;Turbinia&quot; steamed to Paris and was shown to French officials, and then displayed at the Paris Exhibition.

The first turbine-powered merchant vessel, the Clyde steamer , followed in 1901. The Admiralty confirmed in 1905 that all future Royal Navy vessels were to be turbine-powered, and in 1906, the first turbine-powered battleship, the revolutionary , was launched.

==&quot;Crosby&quot; incident==

On 11 January 1907, &quot;Turbinia&quot; was struck and nearly cut in two by &quot;Crosby&quot; – a ship being launched across-river from the south bank of the Tyne. She was repaired and steamed alongside (also a turbine-powered vessel) after the launch of the great ocean liner. However, mechanical problems prevented &quot;Turbinia&quot; from accompanying &quot;Mauretania&quot; down the River Tyne to the sea.

==As a museum ship==

The company decided to slow down the deterioration of &quot;Turbinia&quot; by lifting her out of the water in 1908, and in 1926, the directors of the Parsons Marine Steam Turbine Company offered the ship to the Science Museum, London. &quot;Turbinia&quot; was sectioned in to two halves, the rear complete with engines and propellers, was put on display in the South Kensington museum in London, which did not have the space to accommodate the full ship. The fore section was presented in 1944 to Newcastle Corporation, and placed on display in the city&#x27;s Exhibition Park. In 1959, the Science Museum removed the aft section of &quot;Turbinia&quot; from display, and by 1961, using a reconstructed centre section, &quot;Turbinia&quot; was reassembled and displayed in the Newcastle Municipal Museum of Science and Industry. In 1983, a complete reconstruction was undertaken.

On 30 October 1994, 100 years after her launch, &quot;Turbinia&quot; was moved to Newcastle&#x27;s Museum of Science and Engineering (later renamed the Discovery Museum) and put on display to the public in March 1996. Listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, in 2000, the vessel was the focal point of a year-long, £10.7 million redevelopment programme at the Discovery Museum. The gallery around &quot;Turbinia&quot; was the first area to be refurbished, with the main part of the work involving raising the roof by one storey to create viewing galleries on three levels.

<text>The Ford Boss 302 (formally the &quot;302 H.O.&quot;) is a high-performance &quot;small block&quot; V8 engine manufactured by Ford Motor Company. The original version of this engine was used in the 1969 and 1970 Boss 302 Mustangs and Cougar Eliminators and was constructed by attaching heads designed for the planned 351 Cleveland (which debuted the following year) to a Ford small block. The construction was aided by the two engines sharing a cylinder head bolt pattern, though the Boss heads had to have their coolant passages slightly modified.

An entirely new Boss 302 engine was introduced for the 2012 Ford Mustang using a variant of the Ford Modular engine.

==Design==
The Ford small-block V8-based 1969–70 302 H.O. &quot;Boss 302&quot; engine was developed in 1968 for the SCCA&#x27;s 1969 Trans-Am road racing series. Available only in the Boss 302 Mustang, it derived from a line that traced to the Ford 289 HiPo engine, not a stock &quot;Windsor&quot; 302. It had its own block, based on a unique thin-wall, high nickel content nodular iron casting, with performance upgrades that included solid lifters, much stronger 4-bolt rather than 2-bolt main crankshaft bearings, threaded rather than compression freeze plugs, and custom-fitted canted valve heads that gave it larger valves than on most engines more than a third greater in displacement. These &quot;better breathing&quot; heads were being developed for the planned 351 Cleveland (which debuted in late 1969 Mustangs) and shared a common cylinder head bolt pattern, but required slight modification of their coolant passages and special head gaskets to work on the Boss 302. Adjustable rocker studs, new long slot rockers, and closed 62cc combustion chamber heads were all used.

The block had a thicker deck and a taller intake manifold to accommodate the heads. The engine also had a distinct harmonic balancer, crankcase windage tray, bigger diameter alternator pulley (from the 289 HiPo), and bigger diameter power steering pulley, all to accommodate a higher-revving engine than the standard 302. Valve covers gained two bolts (up to eight), and were chromed in 1969 and cast aluminum in 1970. The high-performance connecting rods are the same as used in the 289 HiPo, 5.155&quot; vs 5.09&quot; for the stock Windsor 302. They are capable of handling up to ~8k RPM, aided by a spot face for bolts with a unique football-shaped head (vs 5/16 for standard small blocks), and beefier cap. The crankshaft was a cross-drilled high-strength steel forging with hollow crankshaft throws; the cross-drilling was eliminated in 1970 for better reliability. The cam and lifters are high lift, with the cam featuring 290 degrees duration and of lift.

The wide and large port heads with staggered valve placement give the 302 H.O. high power capabilities. Because of the pent-roof design of the heads, the Boss also had forged pop-up pistons to achieve the desired 10.5:1 compression ratio. Early units were typically characterized by very large intake and exhaust valves sitting in a small quench style combustion chamber. Exhaust valves were sodium-filled to aid cooling. Valve springs were dual units with an inner and outer spring to minimize harmonic resonance at high RPM. The heads feature steel spring seats, screw-in rocker studs, pushrod guide plates to aid in pushrod stability at high RPMs, and adjustable rocker arms. Fuel was provided by a Holley manual choke carburetor. The taller intake required a thinner spacer, which incorporated an aluminum tube for the PCV hose and was made of phenolic resin to help isolate the carburetor from the heat of the intake. Ignition was handled by a dual point distributor firing unique small-diameter AF 32 Autolite spark plugs necessary to fit within the tight confines of the combustion chamber alongside the very large valves.

At idle, a properly tuned engine&#x27;s solid lifters produce a significant amount of &#x27;chatter&#x27;, giving the engine a unique sound.

Redline was 6,150 rpms, and power output conservatively rated at gross at 5,200 RPM with maximum torque of at 4300 RPM. The Boss 302 engine competes well with other high performance &#x27;small blocks&#x27;, such as the Chevy 302, the Chrysler 340, and the AMC 360.

The name &quot;Boss&quot;, popular 1960s slang for &quot;excellent&quot; or &quot;very cool&quot;, got attached to the Boss 302 Mustang by stylist Larry Shinoda in recognition of the enthusiasm of his boss, new Ford president Semon &quot;Bunkie&quot; Knudson (who had brought Shinoda over from GM&#x27;s Chevrolet Division) for the car. Knudson told his designers, &quot;I want to design a car that&#x27;s the coolest Mustang out there. I don&#x27;t want somebody else&#x27;s name on it, like a Shelby.&quot; The model&#x27;s widespread popularity resulted in the term &quot;Boss 302&quot; displacing &quot;302 H.O.&quot;, the engine&#x27;s formal name, in popular use.

This engine was also optional in the Mercury Cougar Eliminator, with a total of 169 produced in 1969 and 469 assembled in 1970.

==New Boss 302 (2007-)==

The new Boss 302 engine was unveiled in the 2006 SEMA show.

In 2007, Ford Racing began marketing new crate engines using the &quot;Boss 302&quot; moniker with displacements between that are rated from .

The double overhead cam, variable valve timing Ford Modular &quot;Coyote-Boss&quot; engine is also marketed as a crate engine by Ford Racing.

<text>Palaeoloxodon is an extinct genus of elephant. The genus originated in Africa during the Early Pleistocene, and expanded into Eurasia at the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene. The genus contains the largest known species of elephants, over tall at the shoulders and over in weight, representing among the largest land mammals ever, including the African &quot;Palaeoloxodon recki&quot;, the European straight-tusked elephant (&quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot;) and the South Asian &quot;Palaeoloxodon namadicus. P. namadicus&quot; has been suggested to be the largest known land mammal by some authors based on extrapolation from fragmentary remains, though these estimates are highly speculative. In contrast, the genus also contains many species of dwarf elephants that evolved via insular dwarfism on islands in the Mediterranean, some like &quot;Palaeoloxodon falconeri&quot; less than in shoulder height as fully grown adults, making them the smallest elephants known. The genus has a long and complex taxonomic history, and at various times, it has been considered to belong to &quot;Loxodonta&quot; or &quot;Elephas&quot;, but today is usually considered a valid and separate genus in its own right.

==History of research and taxonomy==
Remains of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; species have probably been noted since ancient times where their remains like those of other fossil proboscideans were interpreted as those of giants or other mythical beings. In 1695, remains of a straight-tusked elephant were collected from travertine deposits near Burgtonna in what is now Thuringia, Germany. While these remains were originally declared by the &quot;Collegium Medicum&quot; in the nearby city of Gotha to be purely mineral in nature, Wilhelm Ernst Tentzel, a polymath in the employ of the ducal court of Saxe-Gotha-Altenburg, correctly recognised that they represented the remains of an elephant. Prior to 1845, the remains of Eurasian species of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; were considered to be those of woolly mammoths. The earliest species of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; to be described, the European straight-tusked elephant (&quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot;) and the South Asian &quot;Palaeoloxodon namadicus&quot;, were named by British paleontologists Hugh Falconer and Proby Cautley in 1846-47. Prior to the description of the genus, &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; species were initially placed in the genus &quot;Elephas&quot; (which includes the Asian elephant). In 1924, Matsumoto Hikoshichirō coined &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot;, and circumscribed it as a subgenus of &quot;Loxodonta&quot; (which include the living species of African elephants). It included the &quot;&quot;E. antiquus—namadicus&quot; group&quot;, and he designated the Japanese &quot;&quot;E. namadicus naumanni&quot; Mak.&quot; as its type species. Also in 1924, American paleontologist Henry Fairfield Osborn named the genera &quot;Sivalika&quot; and &quot;Pilgrimia&quot;, with the former covering the Asian species and the latter covering the African and Mediterranean island dwarf species of &quot;Paleoloxodon&quot;. In 1931 Osborn named the genus &quot;Hesperoloxodon&quot; to include &quot;Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot;. In a 1942 posthumous publication, Osborn recognised &quot;Sivalika&quot; and &quot;Pilgrimia&quot; as junior synonyms of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot;, while still recognising &quot;Hesperoloxodon&quot; as valid. This publication was the first to consider &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; a valid genus in its own right, an opinion followed by later authors such as Emiliano Aguirre in 1969. Later authors have considered &quot;Hesperoloxodon&quot; another synonym of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot;. Vincent J. Maglio in a 1973 publication controversially synonymised &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; with &quot;Elephas&quot; based on morphological similarities between the two genera. Later authors either considered &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; a valid genus or a subgenus of &quot;Elephas.&quot; Cladistic analyses finding &quot;Elephas&quot; and &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; to not be each other&#x27;s closest relatives led to the placement of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; species within &quot;Elephas&quot; to be questioned by other authors. By the 2010s &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; was widely regarded as a valid genus separate from &quot;Elephas&quot;.
During the 19th and 20th centuries, species of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; were subject to numerous phylogenetic hypotheses regarding their relationship to other elephantids. Some scholars like Hans Pohlig in 1891 and Osborn in 1935 considered the species of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; to be closely related to African elephants, while others like Wolfgang Soergel in 1915 considered them to be closely related to mammoths. From the late 20th century to the first decade of the 21st century, &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; was usually considered to be closely related the Asian elephant and other members of the genus &quot;Elephas&quot;. In 2016, a study of the straight-tusked elephant (&quot;P. antiquus&quot;) mitochondrial genome and part of the nuclear genome found that the mitochondrial sequences were nested within the diversity of those of the African forest elephant, &quot;Loxodonta cyclotis,&quot; with the partial nuclear genome supporting &quot;P. antiquus&quot; as more closely related to &quot;L. cyclotis&quot; than the African bush elephant, &quot;L. africana&quot;. A later study published in 2018 by the same authors based on the complete nuclear genome revised these results, and suggested &quot;P. antiquus&quot; resulted from reticulate evolution and had a complex hybridization history, with the majority (~60%) of its nuclear genome coming from a lineage more closely related to modern African elephants than to Asian elephants and mammoths, but which diverged before the split between the two living species, with significant introgressed ancestry from African forest elephants (~36%) and to a lesser extent mammoths (~6%). The ancestry from &quot;L. cyclotis&quot; was more closely related to modern West African populations of the forest elephant than to other forest elephant populations, while the mammoth ancestry was basal to the split between woolly and Columbian mammoths, probably from shortly after the split between the ancestors of mammoths and Asian elephants. The hybridisation probably took place in Africa, where &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; was dominant for most of the Early Pleistocene, with the mammoth hybridisation suggested to have taken place earlier than the hybridisation with forest elephants.

Analysis of mitochondrial genomes, including &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; individuals from Northern China indicates &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; individuals harboured multiple separate mitochondrial genome lineages derived from African forest elephants, some being more closely related to some West African forest elephant groups than to others. It is unclear as to whether this is the result of multiple hybridisation events, or whether multiple mitochondrial lineages were introgressed in a single event. It has been found that mitochondrial genome of Chinese &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; specimens clustered with a &quot;P. antiquus&quot; individual from western Europe, which belonged to a separate clade than other sampled European &quot;P. antiquus&quot; specimens. The relatively low divergence between the mitochondrial genomes of the European &quot;P. antiquus&quot; individual and the Chinese &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; specimens may indicate that the populations of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; across Eurasia maintained gene flow with each other, but this is uncertain.

== Description ==

Many species of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; are noted for the distinctive parieto-occipital crest, a bone growth at the top of the skull above the nasal opening which projects forwards and overhangs the rest of the skull. The crest probably functioned to anchor muscle tissue, including the splenius as well as an additional muscle layer called the &quot;extra splenius&quot; (which was likely similar to the &quot;splenius superficialis&quot; found in Asian elephants, and which may have been an extension of the rhomboideus cervicis muscle) which wrapped around the top of the head to support it. The development of the crest is variable depending on the species, growth stage and gender, with females and juveniles having less developed or absent crests. The crest likely developed as a response to the large size of the head, which in proportional and absolute terms are the largest in size of any proboscideans. The skull is proportionally short and tall, with the premaxillary bones containing the tusks being flared outwards. The tusks have relatively little curvature, and are proportionally large, and somewhat twisted, with the tusk alveoli (sockets) being divergent from each other at least in Pleistocene species. These tusks could reach in length, and probably over in weight in the largest species, larger than any recorded in modern elephants.

The molar teeth of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; species typically show a &quot;dot-dash-dot&quot; wear pattern, with the enamel folds concentrated into a major central structure at the midline of the tooth, which are flanked by smaller folds on either side, and the crowns of the tooth are generally proportionally narrow. The teeth are typically very hypsodont (high crowned) with a substantial number of lamellae (up to 19 to 21 on the third molar), though the lamellae frequency is distinctly lower than that reached by advanced mammoth species. The morphology of the teeth varies little between non-dwarf Eurasian &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; species, meaning that they generally cannot be distinguished based on tooth morphology alone.

Species of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; varied widely in size. Fully grown bulls of &quot;Palaeoloxodon recki, Palaeoloxodon antiquus&quot;, &quot;Palaeoloxodon namadicus&quot; and Chinese &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; grew substantially larger than living elephants, with mature bulls reaching or exceeding tall at the shoulder and in body mass, making them some of the largest known terrestrial mammals to have ever lived. In a 2015 study, one fragmentary unlocated femur of &quot;P. namadicus&quot; described in the 19th century was estimated to have belonged to an individual tall and in weight, exceeding the estimates for the otherwise largest known land mammals, the paraceratheres. However, this estimate is highly speculative and the author suggested that it should be &quot;taken with a grain of salt&quot;. In contrast, some of the island dwarf species are the smallest elephants known. The smallest species, &quot;P. cypriotes&quot; and &quot;P. falconeri&quot;, only reached tall as fully grown adults, with fully grown adult bulls of &quot;P. falconeri&quot; having an estimated body mass of only .

== Ecology ==

Species of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; are thought to have had similar social behaviour to modern elephants, with herds of adult females and juveniles, as well as solitary adult males. The African species of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot;, as well as &quot;P. namadicus&quot; are suggested to have been grazers, while &quot;P. antiquus&quot; is suggested to have been a variable mixed feeder that consumed a considerable amount of browse.

== Evolution ==

&quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; first unambiguously appears in the fossil record in Africa during the Early Pleistocene, around 1.8 million years ago as the species &quot;Palaeoloxodon recki ileretensis&quot; (it is contested whether earlier &quot;E. recki&quot; subspecies are related to &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot;).&quot;&quot; &quot;P. recki&quot; was the dominant elephant in East Africa for most of the Pleistocene. A population of &quot;P. recki&quot; migrated out of Africa at the beginning of the Middle Pleistocene around 800,000 years ago, diversifying into the radiation of Eurasian &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; species, including &quot;P. antiquus,&quot; and &quot;P. namadicus.&quot; The precise relationships of the Eurasian taxa to each other are obscure. The arrival of &quot;P. antiquus&quot; in Europe co-incides with the extinction of the temperate adapted mammoth species &quot;Mammuthus meridionalis&quot; (sometimes called the southern mammoth) and its replacement by &quot;Mammuthus trogontherii&quot; (the steppe mammoth) in Europe, with the extinction of &quot;M. meridionalis&quot; possibly in part a result of competition with &quot;P. antiquus&quot;. &quot;P. antiquus&quot; was able to disperse onto many islands in the Mediterranean, undergoing insular dwarfism and speciating into numerous distinct varieties of dwarf elephants. &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; fossils are abundant in China and are assigned to three species, &quot;P. namadicus, P. naumanni&quot; and &quot;P. huaihoensis.&quot; However, the relationships of Chinese &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; are currently unresolved and it is unclear how many species were present in the region.

==Extinction==

The timing of the extinction of the last &quot;Paleoloxodon&quot; species in Africa, &quot;P. jolensis&quot;, is uncertain. While often suggested to have gone extinct during the Late Pleistocene, most specimens of the species are poorly dated and dating of specimens from Kenya suggests that it went extinct there around 130,000 years ago, at the end of the Middle Pleistocene. Most Eurasian species of &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; became extinct towards the end of the Last Glacial Period. The youngest records of &quot;P. antiquus&quot; are from the Iberian Peninsula, dating to around 44-43,000 years ago, with footprints from the southern part of the peninsula possibly extending the record to 28,000 years ago. The youngest Japanese records of &quot;P. naumanni&quot; date to around 24,000 years ago. The timing of extinction of Chinese &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; and Indian &quot;P. namadicus&quot; is uncertain, but claims of a Holocene survival are not substantiated for either region. The youngest dates for the Sicilian dwarf elephant &quot;P.&quot; cf&quot;. mnaidriensis&quot; are around 32-20,000 years ago, while those of Cyprus dwarf elephant &quot;P. cypriotes&quot; are around 12,000 years ago. The dwarf elephant &quot;P. tiliensis&quot; from the Greek island of Tilos is suggested by some authors to have survived as recently as 3,500 years Before Present (around 1500 BC) based on preliminary radiocarbon dating done in the 1970s, which would make it the youngest surviving elephant in Europe, but this has not been thoroughly investigated.

== Relationship with humans ==

Evidence of interaction with &quot;Palaeoloxodon&quot; by archaic humans extends back over 1 million years ago in Africa, with a number sites with &quot;Palaeoloxodon recki&quot; in Africa showing evidence of butchery. There is extensive evidence for butchery and to a lesser extent hunting of the European straight-tusked elephant by archaic humans like &quot;Homo heidelbergensis&quot; and Neanderthals. Evidence has been found for butchery of &quot;Palaeoloxodon turkmenicus&quot; by archaic humans in the Indian subcontinent. Based on the association of their remains with stone artefacts, it has been suggested modern humans encountered and butchered the Japanese &quot;P. naumanni&quot; and the Cyprus dwarf elephant &quot;P. cypriotes&quot; during the Last Glacial Period.

<text>The Morris water navigation task, also known as the Morris water maze (not to be confused with &quot;water maze&quot;), is a behavioral procedure mostly used with rodents. It is widely used in behavioral neuroscience to study spatial learning and memory. It enables learning, memory, and spatial working to be studied with great accuracy, and can also be used to assess damage to particular cortical regions of the brain. It is used by neuroscientists to measure the effect of neurocognitive disorders on spatial learning and possible neural treatments, to test the effect of lesions to the brain in areas concerned with memory, and to study how age influences cognitive function and spatial learning. The task is also used as a tool to study drug-abuse, neural systems, neurotransmitters, and brain development.

== Overview ==

The basic procedure for the Morris water navigation task is that the rat is placed in a large circular pool and is required to find an invisible or visible platform that allows it to escape the water by using various cues. Many factors can influence the rats&#x27; performance, including their sex, the environment in which they were raised, exposure to drugs, etc. There are three basic tactics for the rats to escape the maze: a praxic strategy (remembering the movements needed to get to the platform), a taxic strategy (the rat uses visual cues to reach their destinations), or spatial strategy (using distal cues as points of reference to locate themselves). There are a variety of paradigms for the water maze that can be used to examine different cognitive functions. In particular, cognitive flexibility can be assessed using a water maze paradigm in which the hidden platform is continually re-located.

== History ==
The Morris water navigation task was conceived by Richard G. Morris (then at the University of St Andrews) in 1981 as an alternative to the radial maze. The test was developed to study spatial learning and how it differed from other forms of associative learning. Originally rats, now more commonly mice, were placed in an open pool and the latency to escape was measured for up to six trials a day for 2–14 days. Several variables are used to evaluate an animal&#x27;s performance. For example, a &quot;probe trial&quot; measures how long the test subject spends in the &quot;target quadrant&quot; (the quadrant with the hidden platform). More elaborate trials alter the location of the hidden platform, or measure distance spent swimming in the pool before reaching the platform. Over the years, many different versions of this test have been performed with a large amount of variables. For example, neuroscientists examine the effect of differences of sex, weight, strength, stress levels, age, and strain of species. The results vary dramatically, so researchers cannot draw conclusions unless these variables are kept constant. Many different size pools have been used throughout the history of this task, but it has been shown that this does not have a significant impact on the results of the test. In early versions of the task, researchers only timed latency to escape, however video tracking devices are now routinely used to measure the path to escape, time spent in each quadrant, and distance traveled in the pool.

=== Original experiment ===
In Morris&#x27; first experiment, the apparatus was a large circular pool, 1.30 m across and 0.60 m high. The purpose of the original experiment was to show that spatial learning does not require the presence of local cues, meaning that rats can learn to locate an object without any auditory, visual, or olfactory cues.

== Analysis ==
The earliest measure of learning is &quot;escape latency&quot;, which is the time it takes to find the platform. However, this measure is confounded by swimming speed, not necessarily a cognitive factor, and path length between point of origin and platform is a parameter more closely related to spatial learning. Further parameters are the Gallagher measure, the average distance to the platform, and the Whishaw corridor test, which measures time and path in a strip directly leading from swim-start to platform. Other parameters are measured during probe trials: the escape platform is removed and the mice or rats are allowed to search for it for a fixed time (often 60 seconds). Variables measured are time and path length in quadrants, time near platform, and platform crossings.

== Comparison to maze tasks ==

Like other spatial tasks, such as the T-maze and radial arm maze, the Morris water navigation task is supposed to measure spatial memory, movement control, and cognitive mapping. The T-maze and radial arm maze are much more structured in comparison. The T-maze, for instance, only requires the rat or mouse to make a binary decision, choose left or right (or East or West). In the Morris water navigation task, on the other hand, the animal needs to decide continually where to go. Another reason this task became popular is that rats (but not mice) are natural swimmers, but dislike colder water (mice simply dislike water of any temperature), so in order to perform the task they do not need to be motivated by food deprivation or electrical shock. The mobility of the platform allows for experiments on learning and relearning. Also, the apparatus set-up and costs are relatively low.

== Weaknesses ==
When the searching times for the platform in the target quadrant are reduced in the probe trial, this is seen as direct evidence that the spatial memory of the rat must be impaired. However, many times the reason for a lengthier amount of time spent looking for the platform, or the lack of searching in the target quadrant, has nothing to do with an effect on the rat&#x27;s spatial memory, but is actually due to other factors. A large study of performance in mice concluded that almost half of all variance in performance scores was due to differences in thigmotaxis, the tendency of animals to stay close to the walls of the pool. About 20% of the variability was explained by differing tendencies of mice to float passively in the water until &quot;rescued&quot; by the experimenter. Differences in spatial memory were only the third factor, explaining just 13% of the variation between animals&#x27; performance.

<doc id="859026" wikidata="Q4883895" url="?curid=859026" title="Bellevue, Tennessee">
<text>Bellevue is a neighborhood of Nashville, situated about 13 miles southwest of the downtown area via Interstate 40. It is served by the Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County. The 2016 population estimate for Bellevue&#x27;s two main zip codes was 77,862.

Home to the massive Warner Parks, Bellevue offers more than 50 acres of park and open space per 1000 residents. It is a popular destination for outdoors and nature lovers, with miles of paved and unpaved trails for hikers and cyclists along the Harpeth River Greenway. Bellevue is also the beginning access point for a multi-state recreational highway known as the Natchez Trace Parkway.

Commercial/retail hotspots in the Bellevue area are near the Highway 70S/I-40 interchange, at the intersection of Highway 70S and Old Hickory Boulevard; and near the intersection of Old Harding Pike and Highway 100. One Bellevue Place is a retail lifestyle center on the property formerly known as Bellevue Center Mall on Highway 70S. This shopping area includes a coffee shop, hotels, and numerous restaurants and retail establishments, anchored by a Sprouts Farmer&#x27;s Market grocery store, AMC Bellevue 12 theatre, and the Bellevue Community Center and Ford Ice Center.

In the 1950s, Bellevue was a small community which existed primarily to serve the needs of nearby farms. It was mostly along the railroad tracks near the Harpeth River, and had only a few buildings such as a hardware store, post office, and a Masonic lodge hall. I-40 was built through Bellevue in the early 1960s and suburbanization of the community was made official when the United States Postal Service changed the office&#x27;s designation from &quot;Bellview, Tennessee&quot; to a branch of the Nashville office in the late 1970s.

On May 2, 2010, the Bellevue area was hard-hit by a devastating flood, but in the following decade it rebounded and experienced transformative residential and commercial development.

On February 3, 2014, Bellevue experienced its first plane crash. Four lives were lost in this accident after the plane experienced heavy airspeeds and total engine failure. This plane crash almost destroyed the Bellevue YMCA, with the plane coming down nearly 30 yards from its&#x27; west side. Instead, pilot Glenn Mull was able to save many lives.

==Demographics==
According to the census of 2000, there were 37,062 people and 14,807 households in Bellevue. There were an average of 2.5 persons per household.

In 1990, 76% of people aged 25 or older had a high school education or better. The median income was $40,328.

As of 2016 the population had risen to 77,862.

Notable residents include Ruby Amanfu (recording artist, producer and Grammy, Soul Train and BET Award nominated songwriter), Sam Ashworth (songwriter) (songwriter, producer and recording artist), George Boebecker, Jr. (founder of Crocs), Cecil Branstetter (architect of Metro Nashville Charter and founder of Branstetter, Stranch &amp; Jennings law firm), T. Graham Brown (American country music singer), Luke Combs (American country music artist), Abraham Louis Demoss (Civil War Captain and founder of Bell Vue), Gabe Dixon (keyboard with the Tedeschi Trucks Band, solo artist and former leader of the Gabe Dixon Band), Sylvia Ganier (food policy advocate and founder of Green Door Gourmet farm in Nashville), Bill Evans (saxophonist) (jazz musician who played with Miles Davis and others), Rasa Hows (builder of Hows-Madden House), Noah Liff (businessman and namesake benefactor of Noah Liff Opera Center, home of the Nashville Opera), Col. Littleton (founder of Col. Littleton Leather), Bo Mitchell (Tennessee Representative), Charlie Peacock (producer and recording artist), Henry Rollins (storyteller, writer, singer and former member of Black Flag (band)), Brenda Stein (wood working artist), Jane Branstetter Stranch (U.S. Court of Appeals Judge), Sylvain Sylvain (rock guitarist and member of the New York Dolls), Bill Wade (former NFL Player), Lainey Wilson (songwriter and recording artist), and Jeff Zentner (fiction author).

==Bellevue Public Library==
Bellevue&#x27;s first library service was via bookmobile during World War II. The Bellevue Public Library opened in 1984 in the old woodshop/agriculture classroom building of the original Bellevue High School, built in 1931 and torn down in 1981 when the new Bellevue High School was built on the other side of Colice Jeanne Road. The former gymnasium at the back of the school became part of the Bellevue Community Center. Both the woodshop/agriculture building and the gymnasium were added in the 1950s.

The new Bellevue Branch Library opened in January, 2015. The new Bellevue Branch features a children&#x27;s area, teen area, computer space, café style coffee and vending area as well as meeting room space.
==Bellevue Park==

Bellevue Park is located on Colice Jeanne Road in Bellevue across from Bellevue Middle School and next to the Bellevue Branch Library. It is part of the Metro Nashville Parks System. The park is more commonly referred to as Red Caboose Park by locals due to the red caboose that sits on site. The park also has a log cabin (which was built by the town&#x27;s founder, Abraham Louis Demoss, prior to 1800, and moved to the park from its original location a couple of miles away in about 2005) onsite. The park features an exercise path for walkers and joggers, as well as a playground built by community volunteers in 1996 as part of the Bellevue Bicentennial Celebration.

Red Caboose Park is the site of the annual Bellevue Community Picnic, which attracts around 20,000 people each year.

==Schools==

===Gower Elementary School===
Gower Elementary was built in 1989 and teaches grades preK-4 and is part of the &quot;Hillwood Cluster&quot;. It is located off of I-40 at 650 Old Hickory Boulevard in Bellevue, Nashville, Tennessee. The immediate area was formerly known as the &quot;Gower&quot; or &quot;Gower School&quot; community. The school&#x27;s enrollment is currently [2014] approximately 650 students.

===Harpeth Valley Elementary School===
Harpeth Valley Elementary School was founded in 1939 and teaches grades PreK-4. It is located on the outskirts of Bellevue along State Route 100. The current school was built in 1996 and has enrollment of more than 700 students. Harpeth Valley Elementary School was the inspiration for the title of the hit country song &quot;Harper Valley PTA&quot;.

===Bellevue Middle School===
Bellevue Middle School is located in the heart of the town on Colice Jeanne Road with the students coming primarily from Bellevue and the immediate surrounding areas. It was founded in 1970 and teaches grades 5 through 8. At the site of the former Bellevue High School, the school was renovated in 2002 and has an enrollment of 680 students.

===James Lawson High School===
In Fall 2023, James Lawson High School, a new $150 million facility a 273-acre campus off Highway 70S in Bellevue, replaced Hillwood High School. Located in nearby West Meade, Hillwood High School served ninth through twelfth grade students living in Bellevue and surrounding areas until the end of the 2022-23 academic year.

===Private Schools===
* Nashville Christian School
* Ensworth High School

==Athletics==
Bellevue is the home of The Bellevue Steelers of the Tennessee Youth Football Alliance, who have been a part of the Bellevue community since 1977. Bellevue is also home of BSAA, Inc. at the Reese Smith Jr. Baseball &amp; Softball Park, which includes Babe Ruth League and Cal Ripken Jr. League Baseball. Thousands of Bellevue&#x27;s youth have played baseball here from tee ball through high school. The BBA Youth Basketball program also makes its home in Bellevue. The Bellevue Basketball Association has offered a Youth Sports Basketball program to tens of thousands of Nashville&#x27;s youth since the 1970s. The Harpeth Youth Soccer Association (HYSA) was founded in 1989 in Bellevue. More than 2,000 youth participate in the soccer league each year. The HYSA complex, located on Coley Davis Drive was decimated by the May 2010 Tennessee floods, but reopened in 2011.

<text>Moët &amp; Chandon (), also known simply as Moët, is a French fine winery and part of the luxury goods company LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE. Moët et Chandon is one of the world&#x27;s largest champagne producers and a prominent champagne house. Moët et Chandon was established in 1743 by Claude Moët, and today owns of vineyards, and annually produces approximately 28,000,000 bottles of champagne.

==History==
Moët et Chandon began as Moët et Cie (meaning &quot;Moët &amp; Co.&quot;), established by Épernay wine trader Claude Moët in 1743, and began shipping his wine from Champagne to Paris. The reign of King Louis XV coincided with increased demand for sparkling wine. Soon after its foundation, and after son Claude-Louis joined Moët et Cie, the winery&#x27;s clientele included nobles and aristocrats.

In 1833, the company was renamed Moët et Chandon after Pierre-Gabriel Chandon de Briailles, Remy Moët&#x27;s son-in-law, joined the company as a partner of Jean-Remy Moët, Claude Moët&#x27;s grandson.

Following the introduction of the concept of a vintage champagne in 1840, Moët marketed its first vintage in 1842. Their best-selling brand, Brut Imperial, was introduced in the 1860s. Their best known label, Dom Perignon, is named after the Benedictine monk remembered in legend as the &quot;Father of Champagne&quot;. The brand was owned by Champagne Mercier but was given to Moët in 1927.

Moët &amp; Chandon merged with Hennessy Cognac in 1971 and with Louis Vuitton in 1987 to become LVMH (Louis-Vuitton-Moët-Hennessy), the largest luxury group in the world, netting over 16 billion euros in fiscal 2004. Moët &amp; Chandon was holding a royal warrant as supplier of champagne to Queen Elizabeth II.

In 2006, Moët et Chandon Brut Impérial issued an extremely limited bottling of its champagne named &quot;Be Fabulous&quot;, a special release of its original bottle with decorative Swarovski crystals.

==Dom Pérignon==

Dom Pérignon (; ) is a brand of champagne produced by Moët &amp; Chandon. It is named after Dom Pierre Pérignon, a Benedictine monk who was an important quality pioneer for Champagne wine but who, contrary to popular myths, did not discover the champagne method for making sparkling wines. Dom Pérignon was the first prestige cuvée, an idea proposed by Englishman Laurence Venn. The first vintage of Dom Pérignon was 1921 and was only released for sale in 1936. It is a vintage champagne, meaning that it is only made in the best years, and all grapes used to make the wine are harvested in the same year. Many champagnes, by contrast, are non-vintage, meaning that the champagne is made from grapes harvested in various years.

===Current production===

Around 5 million bottles are produced in each vintage. The wine is 60% Chardonnay and 40% Pinot noir, with 6 g/L dosage. According to Tom Stevenson, &quot;All vintages need at least 12 years ageing to nurture Dom Pérignon&#x27;s signature silky mousse&quot;. As of 2020, the current release of Dom Pérignon is from the 2010 vintage and the current release of Dom Pérignon Rosé is from the 2006 vintage. the senior winemaker was Richard Geoffroy, who has been &quot;chef de cave&quot; for Dom Pérignon since 1990.

==Domaine Chandon==

In 1973, the then Moët-Hennessy company founded Domaine Chandon, an outpost winery in the Napa Valley. It was the first French-owned sparkling wine venture in the United States. The fine dining restaurant &quot;étoile&quot; was located at the winery, until it closed in December 2014.

Chandon had already founded an outpost in Argentina in 1959, and was doing the same in the southern city of Garibaldi in Brasil in 1973.
Domaine Chandon was later established in 1986 in Australia in Coldstream, Victoria, in the Ningxia region in China in 2013 and India&#x27;s Nashik region in 2014.

==Sponsorships==

Moët was the official Formula One champagne provider between 1966 and 1999 and again from 2016 until 2017 when they signed a deal with champagne maker Carbon.

On 30 November 2012, Swiss tennis player Roger Federer became Moët et Chandon&#x27;s brand ambassador. On 30 September 2015, Chandon announced it would be a sponsor of the McLaren F1 team starting 2016.

==Pronunciation==
&quot;Moët&quot; is pronounced with a &quot;t&quot; at the end () (&#x27;mo-et&#x27;) as the French-born founder&#x27;s surname is assumed to be of non-French (alleged Dutch-German) origin.

<text>Abd al-Aziz (, DMG: &quot;ʽAbd al-ʽAzīz&quot;), frequently also transliterated Abdul-Aziz, is a male Arabic Muslim given name and, in modern usage, surname. It is built from the words &quot;ʽAbd&quot;, the Arabic definite article and &quot;ʽAzīz&quot; &quot;Almighty&quot;. The name is commonly abbreviated as &quot;ʽAzīz&quot;. The name means &quot;servant of the Almighty&quot;, &quot;al-ʽAzīz&quot; being one of the names of God in Islam, which give rise to the Muslim theophoric names.

The letter &quot;a&quot; of the &quot;al-&quot; is unstressed, and can be transliterated by almost any vowel, often by &quot;u&quot;. So the first part can appear as Abdel, without spacing and hyphenation. Abdelaziz (with an &quot;e&quot;) is the most common transliteration of the name in the Maghreb.

<text>Jay and the Americans are an American rock group who formed in the late 1950s. Their initial line-up consisted of John &quot;Jay&quot; Traynor, Howie Kane (born Howard Kirschenbaum), Kenny Vance (born Kenneth Rosenberg) and Sandy Deanne (born Louis Sandy Yaguda), though their greatest success on the charts came after Traynor had been replaced as lead singer by Jay Black (born David Blatt) and Marty Sanders (born Martin Joe Kupersmith) were added to the line-up. They were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Originally called The Harborlites, they were discovered while performing in student venues at New York University in the late 1950s. They auditioned for Leiber and Stoller, who gave the group its name.

===Career pinnacle===
Soon they signed with United Artists Records. With Jay Traynor singing lead, they first hit the Billboard charts in 1962 with the tune &quot;She Cried&quot;, which reached #5 (later covered by The Shangri-Las, Aerosmith, and others). The next two singles did not fare as well, and Traynor left the group. Empires&#x27; guitarist Marty Sanders (né Kupersmith) joined the group. He brought David Black (né Blatt) of &quot;The Empires&quot; in to take Traynor&#x27;s place (after David first agreed to adopt the name Jay Black), and Black sang lead for the rest of the group&#x27;s major hits.

They recorded &quot;Only in America&quot;, a song originally meant for The Drifters. Other notable hits for Jay and the Americans were &quot;Come a Little Bit Closer&quot; in 1964, which hit #3, and &quot;Cara Mia&quot; in 1965, which hit #4. They also recorded a commercial for H.I.S. Slacks and a public service announcement for the Ad Council, featuring a backing track by Brian Wilson and Phil Spector. Two tracks from this era later found favor with the Northern Soul crowd: &quot;Got Hung Up Along The Way&quot; and &quot;Living Above Your Head&quot;.

In 1966, the group was featured in the Universal comedy film, &quot;Wild Wild Winter,&quot; singing &quot;Two of a Kind&quot; at the film&#x27;s finale, with surf band The Astronauts depicted as providing backup instrumentals. As of February 2017, the song has been released only on the 1966 soundtrack LP.

In 1969, they recorded an album of their favorite oldies called &quot;Sands of Time&quot;, which included &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, which was originally done by the Drifters. The single went to #6 in early 1969. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in May 1969. &quot;This Magic Moment&quot; was the last top ten record for Jay and the Americans, although a follow-up album, &quot;Wax Museum&quot;, in January 1970, did yield the #19 hit single &quot;Walkin&#x27; In The Rain&quot;, first recorded by The Ronettes. Their next singles failed to chart, and the band grew apart, but the demand for appearances remained. (Around the same time the band recorded &quot;This Magic Moment&quot;, Jay and the Americans member Sandy Yaguda produced a Long Island teen sextet called The Tuneful Trolley. Their late-1968 Capitol LP, &quot;Island In The Sky&quot; — a hybrid of Beach Boys and Beatlesque psych-pop—was reissued in 2008 in the UK on Now Sounds.) From 1970 to 1971 Jay and the Americans&#x27; touring band included Walter Becker and Donald Fagen (of later Steely Dan fame) on backup bass guitar and electric organ. Becker and Fagen also contributed string and horn arrangements to the 1970 Jay and the Americans album &quot;Capture the Moment&quot;.

===Split===
The group split in 1973. All of the members moved on to solo musical careers, with the exception of Jay Black, who continued to perform as &quot;Jay and the Americans&quot;, using a variety of musicians. The original version of &quot;Cara Mia&quot; went to #1 in the Netherlands when it was re-released in 1980. In 1991 EMI released the material on CD for the first time with the collection &quot;Come A Little Bit Closer&quot;.

In 2001, he was featured in the PBS special &quot;Rock, Rhythm, and Doo Wop&quot; as &quot;Jay Black &amp; The Americans&quot;.

===Sale of the band name and &quot;reunion&quot;===

In 2006, Jay Black filed for bankruptcy due to gambling debts, and his ownership of the name &quot;Jay &amp; The Americans&quot; was sold by the bankruptcy trustee to Sandy Deanne (Yaguda), Black&#x27;s former bandmate and original member of Jay &amp; The Americans, for $100,000. With the name purchase, former members Deanne, Howard Kane, and Marty Sanders reunited, and recruited a sound-alike singer from Chicago, coincidentally nicknamed &quot;Jay.&quot; Thus, John &quot;Jay&quot; Reincke became the third &quot;Jay&quot; and the band returned to playing both national and international music venues. 

Until 2017, David Blatt continued to tour under his stage name, &quot;Jay Black&quot;. In a 2014 interview, he announced that he had Alzheimer&#x27;s; he continued to perform until 2017. Kenny Vance is currently the lead singer of Kenny Vance and the Planotones, a neo-doo wop band that he formed in the 1970s. After leaving the group, John Traynor recorded a handful of songs on the Coral label, including &quot;I Rise, I Fall&quot; in 1964. None were hits, but &quot;I Rise, I Fall&quot; became a minor hit for Johnny Tillotson. The label billed Traynor as &quot;JAY formerly of Jay and the Americans.&quot; Traynor toured with Jay Siegel&#x27;s Tokens until shortly before his death on January 2, 2014.

Black died on October 22, 2021, from complications of pneumonia and dementia. In a statement, Jay and the Americans acknowledged that Black and the rest of the group had experienced &quot;both wonderful and very contentious times&quot; but that they respected the success that they achieved with Black as their lead singer.

<text>Michael Cranford (born June 5, 1963) is a video game designer and programmer. As a designer and programmer his works include &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale, The Bard&#x27;s Tale II, and Dark Seed.&quot; Cranford left the video game industry in 1992 to pursue an academic career as an ethicist.

== Game designer ==
Cranford was the designer and programmer of 1985&#x27;s &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot; and 1986&#x27;s &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale II: The Destiny Knight&quot; role-playing video games published by Interplay Productions. He also programmed the Apple II version of &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;, the Commodore 64 version of &quot;Super Zaxxon&quot;, as well as &quot;Maze Master&quot; (a spiritual predecessor of &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;). His last video game was &quot;Dark Seed&quot; for Cyberdreams in 1992. He left the video game industry to pursue graduate studies, and thus was not involved in the creation of 1988&#x27;s &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale III&quot;. Almost thirty years later, however, he was approached by inXile Entertainment to assist with the development of &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale IV: Barrows Deep&quot; and had agreed to provide feedback and advice for the new game.

===Games===
== Academic career ==
He was a professor for eight years at Biola University in La Mirada, California, gaining his Master of Divinity degree from Biola and a master&#x27;s degree in Social Ethics from the University of Southern California. He is currently an adjunct professor of philosophy at Concordia University in Irvine, California. He studied architecture at the University of California, Berkeley and he holds a degree in philosophy from the University of California, and has completed a Ph.D. in Religion and Social Ethics from the University of Southern California, with a focus on ethics and technology.

<doc id="859051" wikidata="Q3429736" url="?curid=859051" title="Ford small block engine">
<text>The Ford small-block is a series of 90° overhead valve small-block V8 automobile engines manufactured by the Ford Motor Company from July 1961 to December 2000.

Designed as a successor to the Ford Y-block engine, it was first installed in the 1962 model year Ford Fairlane and Mercury Meteor. Originally produced with a displacement of , it eventually increased to with a taller deck height, but was most commonly sold (from 1968–2000) with a displacement of 302 cu in (later marketed as 5.0 L).

Famed variants powered 289 Shelby Cobras to Trans-Am racing championships and the Ford GT-40 to wins at LeMans and 1-2-3 sweeps in its iconic 5L form. The Boss 302 also was a Trans-Am design.

The small-block was installed in several of the company&#x27;s most famous products, notably the Mustang, as well as the Mercury Cougar, Ford Torino, Ford Granada, Mercury Monarch, Ford LTD, Mercury Marquis, Ford Maverick, and Ford F-150 pickup.

For the 1991 model year, Ford began phasing in their new Modular V8 engine to replace the small-block, beginning with the Lincoln Town Car and continuing through the 1990s. The 2001 Explorer SUV was the last North American installation of the engine, and Ford Australia used it through 2002 in the Falcon and Fairlane.

Although sometimes called the &quot;Windsor&quot; by enthusiasts, Ford never used that designation for the engine line as a whole; it was only adopted well into its run to distinguish the version from the &quot;Cleveland&quot; version of the 335-family engine that had the same displacement but a significantly different configuration, and only ever used to refer to that specific engine in service materials. The designations for each were derived from the original locations of manufacture: Windsor, Ontario and Cleveland, Ohio.

From 1962 through the 1990s, Ford small blocks engines were marinized by various companies (except for the ).

The small-block remains available for purchase from Ford Performance Parts as a crate engine.

==Overview==
The small-block V8 engine was introduced in the 1962 Ford Fairlane and Mercury Meteor cars. Displacing , it was designed to save weight, using thin-wall casting for a short-skirt block that does not extend below the centerline of the crankshaft. The engine uses a separate aluminum timing chain cover, which differentiates it from the later Ford 335-series engines (informally referred to as &quot;Cleveland&quot;) that use an integrated timing cover. All Ford small-block engines use two-valve-per-cylinder heads, with &quot;2V&quot; and &quot;4V&quot; designations indicating the number of barrels (or venturi) in the carburetor. The valves are in-line and use straight six-bolt valve covers. Coolant is routed out of the block through the intake manifold.

The design was soon bored to and again to , then stroked to , settling on the most common displacement offered until the engine&#x27;s retirement in 2001, nearly 40 years after the basic block design debuted. Two additional displacements were produced during the engine&#x27;s history. A model was offered beginning in 1969 and continuing until 1996. The 351W (so identified to distinguish from the 335-series Cleveland-produced 351C) uses a taller block than the other engines in the series to avoid excessively short connecting rods. And for a brief time in the early 1980s, a version with a smaller bore diameter that displaced was produced as Ford struggled with emissions and fuel economy.

In response to the Chevrolet Camaro&#x27;s success in the SCCA Trans-Am Series, Ford engineers developed a new racing engine from the small block. The first attempt mated a tunnel-port head to a 289 cu in block, but the displacement proved to be too small to deliver the desired power. The next iteration of the engine mated an improved head design to the 302 cu in block, producing the famous &quot;Boss 302&quot;. The heads from the Boss 302 became the production heads on the 335-series &quot;Cleveland&quot; engines, which used the same bore spacing and head bolt configuration as the small block engines.

As the 1980s drew to a close, Ford began the design of a new OHC V8 to replace the venerable small block design. The Modular 4.6 L OHC V8 debuted in the 1991 Lincoln Town Car, signaling the eventual demise of the OHV Ford small-block. Through the rest of the decade, Ford gradually shifted V8 applications to the Modular engine, with the Mustang transitioning in 1996. Even as the small-block neared the end of its life, development continued, with new cylinder heads introduced for the Ford Explorer in 1997. American sales in new vehicles ended with the 2001 Ford Explorer, but the engine continues to be offered for sale as a crate engine from Ford Racing and Performance Parts.

===Design changes===
All 221, 260, and 289 engines built from July 1961 through August 1964 used a five-bolt bell housing, with all 221s and 260s being of this configuration, but the 289 changed to the six-bolt arrangement at this time – the change was made to resolve transmission utilization issues, such as the need for larger-diameter clutches.

The block mount pads and the cylinder wall contour of the 221 and 260 engines changed in January–February 1963 with the introduction of the 289 variant – all 221 and 260 engine blocks up to this time featured &quot;corrugated wall&quot; construction with two core plugs on the side of each bank and engine mount hole pitch distances of 6 inch.

All three block variants from this point on featured the straight wall method of construction, three core plugs, and an engine mount hole pitch distance of seven inches. The corrugated wall method of block construction had caused cleaning difficulties in the foundry from day one and a change was phased in.

==221==
The first engine of modern Ford small block family was called the Fairlane V8,and introduced for the 1962 model year as an option on the Fairlane and Meteor. It had a displacement of , from a bore and stroke, with wedge combustion chambers for superior breathing, and a two-barrel (2V) carburetor. An advanced, compact, thinwall-casting design, it was 24&quot; wide, 29&quot; long, and 27.5&quot; tall (610 mm × 737 mm × 699 mm). It weighed only dry despite its cast iron construction, making it the lightest and most compact V8 engine of its type of the era.

In stock form, it used a two-barrel carburetor and a compression ratio of 8.7:1, allowing the use of regular rather than premium gasoline. Valve diameters were (intake) and (exhaust). Rated power and torque (SAE gross) were at 4,400 rpm and at 2,200 rpm.

The 221 was phased out end of May 1963 as a result of lackluster demand (following the mid-&#x27;62 introduction of the &quot;Challenger&quot; V8 based on it). About 371,000 had been produced.

==255==
In the late 1970s, an urgent need to meet EPA CAFE standards led to the creation of the version for the 1980 model year, essentially a 302 with the cylinder bores reduced to . The 302 was to be phased out and the 255 was to be an interim engine which would remain until the new V6 was in production. Rated power (SAE net) was , depending on year and application. Cylinder heads, which were specific to this engine, used smaller combustion chambers and valves, and the intake ports were oval whereas the others were all rectangular. The only externally visible clue was the use of an open-runner intake manifold with a stamped-steel lifter valley cover attached to its underside, reminiscent of previous-generation V8 engines, such as the Y-block and the MEL.

It was optional in Fox-chassis cars including the Mustang (and corporate cousin Mercury Capri), Thunderbird, and Fairmont, and standard equipment in the Ford LTD. Some variants (such as the one used in the Mercury Grand Marquis) were fitted with a variable-venturi carburetor which were capable of highway fuel economy in excess of . Due to its dismal overall performance, the 255 was dropped at the end the 1982 model year with 253,000 units manufactured; however, 302 production continued and the plans to phase it out were dropped.

Applications:
*1980–1981 Ford Fairmont
*1981–1982 Ford F-100
*1981–1982 Ford Granada
*1981–1982 Ford LTD
*1980–1982 Ford Mustang
*1980–1982 Ford Thunderbird
*1980–1982 Mercury Capri
*1980–1982 Mercury Cougar
*1981–1982 Mercury Marquis
*1980–1981 Mercury Zephyr

==260==
The 260 was the second version of the Fairlane V8, introduced during the middle of the 1962 model year (March 1962) and given the name Challenger. It used the same block as the 221, and the same two-barrel (2V) carburetor, with displacement increased to by expanding its bore to 3.80 in (96.5 mm). Compression ratio was raised fractionally to 8.8:1. The engine was slightly heavier than the 221, at 482 lb (219 kg). Rated power (still SAE gross at that time) rose to at 4400 rpm, with a peak torque of at 2200 rpm.

For the 1962 and 1963 model years, the valve head diameters remained the same as the 221, but for the 1964 model year, they were enlarged to 1.67 in (42.4 mm) (intake) and 1.45 in (36.8 mm) (exhaust) – a manufacturing economy measure so that both 260 and 289 engines could use the same valves. Although the engine breathed better, and was capable of producing marginally more power, rated power was not changed.

In 1963, the 260 became the base engine on full-sized Ford sedans. Later in the model year, its availability was expanded to the Ford Falcon and Mercury Comet. The early &quot;1964½&quot; Ford Mustang also offered the 260.

Ford ceased production of the 260 at the end of the 1964 model year with approximately 604,000 units having been made.

===XHP-260===
The special rally version of the Falcon and Comet and early AC Cobra sports cars of 1962 used a high-performance version of the 260 with higher compression, hotter camshaft timing, upgraded connecting rods, valves with larger diameter valve stems, stronger valve springs and a four-barrel carburetor. This engine was rated (SAE gross) at 5800 rpm and at 4800 rpm. This engine was termed the HP-260 by Ford and was specifically made for Carroll Shelby – about 100 were made.

=== Sunbeam Tiger ===
The 1964–1966 Sunbeam Tiger Mk I used the 260.

Early 1967 Sunbeam Tiger Mk IIs were also fitted the 260 until its inventory ran out, replaced by the 289 ci in V8.

==289==
The V8 was introduced in April 1963, carrying the Challenger name over from the 260 and replacing it as the base V8 for full-sized Fords. 

Bore was expanded to , becoming the standard for most small block Ford engines. Stroke remained at 2.87 inches. Weight was 506 lb (230 kg). It retained the 260&#x27;s two-barrel carburetor (2V), had a slightly lower 8.7:1 compression ratio, and was rated at (SAE gross) at 4,400 rpm and at 2,200 rpm.

===D-code===
In 1964, an intermediate performance version of the engine was introduced with a four-barrel carburetor and 9.0:1 compression, rated at at 4,400 rpm and at 2,800 rpm.

The engine was an option on the 1965 Ford Mustang and was known as the &quot;D-code&quot; from the letter code used to identify the engine in the VIN.

The D-code engine is relatively rare, as it was only offered as an optional engine in the latter half of the 1964 model year.

===Cyclone===
was marketed in the 1964 Mercury Comet Cyclone as the &quot;Cyclone&quot; and carried a K-code in its Mercury VIN. This engine is not the same engine as the HiPo K-code engine offered in Ford vehicles.

===C-code===
For 1965, the compression ratio of the base two-barrel 289 was raised to 9.3:1, increasing power to at 4,400 rpm and torque to at 2,400 rpm.

In 1968, the output was reduced to .

===A-code===
In 1965, the four-barrel (4V) version was increased to 10.0:1 compression, and was rated at at 4,800 rpm and at 3,200 rpm.

The 289-4V was also the engine for the Australian Ford XR Falcon GT, its first Falcon GT.

===Production numbers===
Around 3,500,000 289-2V and 289-4V engines were made at Cleveland Engine Plant 1 (CEP1) and 800,000 289-2V at Windsor Engine Plant 1 (WEP1) in 1963-1967.

===289 HiPo (K-code)===
A high-performance version of the Challenger 289 engine was introduced late in the 1963 model year as a special order for Ford Fairlanes. The engine is informally known as the HiPo or the &quot;K-code&quot; (after the engine letter used in the VIN code of cars so equipped). It was the only 289 engine available in the intermediate Fairlanes, with lesser-powered cars receiving the 260 V8. Starting in June 1964, it became an option for the Mustang.

The HiPo engine was engineered to increase performance and high-rpm reliability over the standard 289. It had solid valve lifters with more aggressive cam timing; 10.5:1 compression; a dual point centrifugal advance distributor; smaller combustion chamber heads with cast spring cups and screw-in studs; low-restriction exhaust manifolds; and a bigger, manual-choke 595 CFM carburetor (105 CFM more than the standard 289-4V). The water pump had fewer vanes (to minimize high rpm foaming and cavitation), the fuel pump received an extra spring to keep up with high rpm demand, alternator/generator pulleys were larger diameter (to slow their relative speeds at high engine revs), and a special fan was fitted.

Bottom-end high-rpm improvements included a flaw-free selected standard block, thicker main bearing caps and crankshaft damper/balancer, larger-diameter rod bolts, a crankshaft made from 80% nodular iron as opposed to the regular item&#x27;s 40% (with each one checked for correct &#x27;nodularity&#x27; by polishing an area of the rear counterweight and comparing a magnification of that surface against a standard), and increased crankshaft counterweighting to compensate for the heavier connecting rod big ends. (The external counter weighting at the front was split between the crankshaft damper and a supplementary counterweight placed adjacent to the front main bearing journal, all designed to reduce the &#x27;bending moment&#x27; in the crankshaft at high-rpm.)

The HiPo equipped with a single 4-barrel Autolite 4100 carburetor carried SAE gross ratings of at 6,000 rpm and at 3,400 rpm.

The K-code HiPo engine was an expensive option and its popularity was greatly diminished after the 390 and 428 big-block engines became available in the Mustang and Fairlane lines, which offered similar power (at the expense of greater weight, and worsened front/rear weight distribution) with cheaper parts at far less cost.

====GT-350====
The HiPo engine was used in modified form by Carroll Shelby for the 1965–1967 Shelby GT350, receiving special exhaust headers, an aluminum intake manifold, and a larger 4-barrel Holley 715 CFM carburetor, which raised rated power to at 6,000 rpm and at 4,200 rpm of torque. Shelby also replaced the internal front press-in oil gallery plugs with threaded plugs to reduce chances of high rpm failure, and installed a larger oil pan with baffles to reduce oil starvation in hard cornering.

From 1966 to 1968, Shelby offered an optional Paxton supercharger on Shelby GT350 289s, raising power to around .

====Production numbers====
About 25,000 K-code 289s were manufactured at Cleveland Engine Plant 1 (CEP1) between March 1963 and June 1967.

==302==
By 1967, the Ford GT40 MKII and GT40 MKIV had dominated the Le Mans 24-Hour Race for two consecutive years, using various versions of the Ford medium block FE engine. In an attempt to reduce the high speeds, the organizers of this race capped the engine capacity at an even 5.0 L in 1968. Ford consequently returned to the MKI GT40 (originally using the 289), but had now increased its capacity to meet the new rules. the 302 was adopted in domestic manufacturing. Both two-bolt and four-bolt main bearing versions were made.

===2-Bolt main bearing caps===
In 1968, the small-block Ford stroke was increased from to , giving a total displacement of . The connecting rods were shortened to allow the use of the same pistons as the 289. The new 302 replaced the 289 early in the 1968 model year.

The most common form of this engine used a two-barrel carburetor, initially with 9.5:1 compression. It had hydraulic lifters and valves of (intake) and (exhaust), and was rated (SAE gross) at at 4,600 rpm and at 2,600 rpm. Optional was a four-barrel version rated at at 4,800 rpm.

The 302/5.0 was primarily manufactured at Ford&#x27;s Cleveland engine plant in Brook Park, Ohio, just as its predecessors were, though Windsor Engine No. 2 manufactured truck-spec 5.0s from 1982 to 1996. The 302 received several changes over the course of its production run. These were longer valve stems with rotating lash caps, bottle neck type rocker studs for a positive stop nut arrangement and a longer pushrod to correct valve train geometry. The water pump borrowed from the 351 Cleveland, with a few minor alterations to the casting, allowed the use of a left hand water inlet. (this improved water circulation in the radiator to a more cross-flow direction). This change also necessitated the need for a harmonic damper change to move the timing marks to the other side of the front timing cover and a change to four bolts holding the crank pulley rather than just three.

Emission regulations caused a progressive reduction in compression ratio for the 302 two-barrel, to 9.0:1 in 1972, reducing SAE gross horsepower to . In that year, U.S. automakers began to quote horsepower in SAE net ratings; the 302 two-barrel carried a net rating of . By 1975, its power had dropped as low as in some models. Until fuel injection began to appear in the 1980s, net power ratings did not rise above .

From the 1978 model year, the 302 became more commonly known as the 5.0 Liter, although its metric displacement is . Despite Ford&#x27;s usage, &quot;Car and Driver&quot; referred to the 302 as a 4.9-liter engine. Other terms for it included &quot;5-Oh&quot;, &quot;5-Point-Oh&quot;, and &quot;5 Liter&quot;.

Throttle-body fuel injection became available on the 1980 Lincoln Continental, and became standard on all non-H.O. 5.0 engines for 1983. For the 1986 model year, Ford replaced the throttle-body system with sequential multi-port fuel injection, identifiable by the large intake with an &quot;EFI 5.0&quot; badge on top.

Variants of the engine remained in use in Ford passenger cars and light trucks through the mid-1990s, and in SUVs until 2001.

====GT-350====
For 1968 only, there was three versions.
The standard powerplant was a standard 302-4V with a high-rise manifold (basic intake at first), a Holley four-barrel carburetor 600 CFM and a dual exhaust producing at 4,800 rpm and at 2,800 rpm. An optional, factory installed, Paxton supercharger was available which increased the GT350&#x27;s output to at 5,200 rpm and at 3,200 rpm.. As a replacement during the model-year, a special high-performance Shelby-modified version of the 302 was offered by Ford in the Shelby GT350. The main features included: an angled, high-rise aluminum or iron intake manifold, a larger Holley four-barrel carburetor (715 CFM), and bigger valves of intake and exhaust. It had a longer-duration camshaft, still with hydraulic lifters. The heads had special close-tolerance pushrod holes to guide the pushrods without rail rocker arms or stamped steel guide plates. The combustion chambers also featured a smaller quench design for a higher compression ratio and enhanced flow characteristics. Additionally, high-flow cast exhaust manifolds similar to those on the 289 Hi-Po K-code engine further improved output. Heavy-duty connecting rods with high-strength bolts and a nodular iron crankshaft were also included in this package. Rated power (SAE gross) was estimated at at 5,000 rpm and at 3,200 rpm.. The package, which cost $692 including some other equipment, was not popular and did not return for 1969. This engine is well documented in the Ford factory engine repair manual for 1968 Mustangs and Fairlanes.

==== 5.0 H.O.====

The 1982 model year brought a new 5.0 High Output variation of the 302. Manual-transmission equipped Mustangs and Mercury Capris were first equipped with two-barrel carburetors (1982), then a four-barrel Holley carburetor (1983–85). The block was fitted with revised, taller lifter bosses to accept roller lifters, and a steel camshaft in 1985, and electronic sequential fuel injection was introduced in 1986. While sequential injection was used on the Mustang beginning in 1986, many other vehicles, including trucks, continued to use a batch-fire fuel injection system. The speed-density based ECU-controlled electronic fuel-injection (EFI) systems used a large, two-piece, cast-aluminum manifold. It was fitted on all 302 engines through 1988, after which year it was phased out for a mass airflow sensor (MAF) system in most applications (non–California compliant Panther platform cars retained the speed-density system until the Lincoln Town Car received the 4.6 L OHC Modular V8 for model year 1991, and the Crown Victoria and Grand Marquis for 1992).

The same manifold was used in MAF applications, with the addition of the MAF sensor in the air intake tube. The MAF system continued, with minor revisions, until the retirement of the engine in 2001. Ford offered a performance head that was a stock part on 1993–1995 Mustang Cobra models and pre-1997 ½ Ford Explorers and Mercury Mountaineers equipped with the 5.0 L engine called the GT-40 head (casting ID F3ZE-AA). In mid-1997, the Explorer and Mountaineer 5.0 L heads were revised and renamed GT40P. The GT40P heads, unlike the GT40 heads, had a very well-developed port shape/design which yielded about 200 cfm on the intake side and 140 cfm on the exhaust side without increasing the size of the ports at all from standard E7TE castings, and without increasing the exhaust valve size. These highly-efficient heads also had smaller 59–61 cc combustion chambers for added compression, and the combustion chamber shape was revised to put the spark plug tip near the center of the chamber for a more even burn.

The 302 is still available as a complete crate motor from Ford Racing Performance Parts.

=====Marine 302=====
The 302 was marinized and offered in both standard and reverse-rotation setups.

====5.6====
In 2001, Ford Australia also built some stroked, 5.6 L (5,605 cc, 342 cu in) small blocks with reworked GT40P heads (featuring larger valves), a unique eight-trumpet inlet manifold fitted with a unique throttle body, long-throw crank, H-beam rods, and roller rockers. Used in vehicles known as “T” series Ford Falcons and XR8 Pursuit 250 in their last collaboration (and possibly the last production use of the small block) in 2001–2002. Vehicles fitted with these stroker engines were sold under the banner of, and only available from dealers under the FTE banner (Ford Tickford Experience). They were produced in conjunction with long standing performance partner Tickford. They produced at 5,250 rpm and at 4,250 rpm. The 5.6 litres of displacement were reached by lengthening the stroke from to .

===4-Bolt main bearing caps===
====GT-40====
In response to a new LeMans regulation which limited engine displacement to , Ford added an extra 1/8-inch of piston travel to the 289 Hi-Performance V8, yielding the block. It featured heavy-duty four-bolt main bearing caps and pressed in core plugs, and was topped with Gurney-Weslake aluminum heads. 

====Tunnel-Port 302====
Ford&#x27;s new 302 &quot;Tunnel-Port&quot; engine was originally envisioned as the secret weapon for the 1968 Trans-Am racing season, which would bring them a third Championship win.

Starting with a 1967 GT-40 block, Ford topped the engine with a new head design. The new heads were based on the design of Ford&#x27;s NASCAR 427 heads. The intake ports were straight, instead of snaking around the push rods. The push rods actually went through the center of the ports (thus the name &quot;Tunnel-Port&quot;). This configuration also enabled larger valves to be used.

The 302 tunnel-port motor was topped off with an aluminum dual quad intake.

Shelby dyno sheets showed this engine was capable of producing horsepower in the 440 to 450 range, and operated through a very high rpm band (8000+).

====Boss 302====

Originally the &quot;302 H.O.&quot;, the Boss 302 was a performance variant of the small block designed to allow Ford to wrest back the Trans-Am racing championship from the Camaro Z/28. Inspired by chief engineer Bill Gay and realized by Bill Barr, it put large-port, large-valve, quench-chambered, free-flowing &quot;Cleveland&quot;-type cylinder heads (adapted from the design destined for the 351 Cleveland to debut later in 1969) on a special racing block to improve rated power to . According to some reports, the canted-valve, deep-breathing, high-revving engine could produce more than , although it was equipped with an electrical revolution limiter that restricted maximum engine speed to 6,150 rpm. The 302 H.O. borrowed some components (and approach) from the 289 HiPo. A strong 4-bolt main bottom end, thicker cylinder walls, steel screw-in core plugs, aggressive forged-steel crank, special HD connecting rods, and Cleveland-style forged pistons were geared to racing. The Boss 302 Mustang was offered only for the 1969 and 1970 model years. In the January 2010 issue of &quot;Hot Rod&quot; magazine, a Boss 302 engine built to the exact specifications, settings, and conditions of the original engine was tested. It produced 372 hp at 6,800 rpm (650 rpm over the original engine’s redline) and 325 lb-ft of torque at 4,200 rpm.

==351W==
The 351W (Windsor) made its debut in 1969; it is often confused with the Ford 351 Cleveland, a different engine of near identical displacement that also began production in 1969. The Windsor featured a taller deck height than the 289/302, allowing a stroke of . It was initially rated (SAE gross) at with a two-barrel carburetor (referred to as &quot;2V&quot; in engine designations) or with a four-barrel (designated &quot;4V&quot;). Emissions compliance led to a compression drop in 1971, and when Ford switched to net power ratings in 1972 power ratings had fallen to .

The 289, 302, and 351W share the same bellhousing, motor mounts, and other small parts. The 351W had larger main bearing caps, thicker and longer connecting rods, and a distinct firing order (1-3-7-2-6-5-4-8 versus the usual 1-5-4-2-6-3-7-8, a means to move the unacceptable &quot;noise&quot; of the consecutively-firing adjacent front cylinders to the sturdier rear part of the engine block all while reducing excessive main bearing load), adding some to the engine&#x27;s dry weight. The distributor is slightly different, to accommodate a larger oil pump shaft and larger oil pump. Some years had threaded dipstick tubes.

The head castings and valve head sizes from 1969 to 1976 were different, notably in passages for air injection and spark plug diameters (1969–1974 18 mm, 1975 and up 14 mm). From 1977 onward, the 351W shared the same head casting as the 302, differing only in bolt hole diameters (7/16 inch for the 302, 1/2 inch for the 351W). Early blocks (casting ID C9OE-6015-B) had enough metal on bearing saddles 2, 3, and 4 for four-bolt mains, and as with all small-block Fords (SBFs), were superior in strength to most late-model, lightweight castings. Generally, the 1969 to 1974 blocks are considered to be far superior in strength than the later blocks, making these early units some of the strongest and most desirable in the entire SBF engine family including the 335-series. During the 1980s, a four-barrel version (intake manifold casting ID E6TE-9425-B) was reintroduced for use in light trucks and vans. In 1988, fuel injection replaced the four-barrel carburetor. Roller camshaft/lifters were introduced in this engine in 1994.

The original connecting rod beam (forging ID C9OE-A) featured drilled oil squirt bosses to lubricate the piston pin and cylinder bore and rectangular-head rod bolts mounted on broached shoulders. A number of fatigue failures were attributed to the machining of the part, so the bolt head area was spot-faced to retain metal in the critical area, requiring the use of &#x27;football head&#x27; bolts. In 1975, the beam forging (D6OE-AA) was updated with more metal in the bolt-head area. The oil squirt bosses were drilled for use in export engines, where the quality of accessible lubricants was questionable. The rod cap forging remained the same on both units (part ID C9OE-A). In 1982, the design of the Essex V6 engine used a new version of the 351W connecting rod (E2AE-A), the difference between the two parts was that the V6 and V8 units were machined in metric and SAE units, respectively. The cap featured a longer boss for balancing than the original design.

In 1971 block deck height was extended from (casting D1AE-6015-DA) to lower the compression ratio to reduce emissions without the need to change piston or cylinder-head design. In 1974, a boss was added on the front of the right cylinder bank to mount the air injection pump (casting D4AE-A). In 1974, the oil dipstick tube moved from the timing case to the skirt under the left cylinder bank near the rear of the casting. In 1984, the rear main seal was changed from a two-piece to a single-piece design.

Around 8.6 million 351W engines were manufactured between 1969 and 1996 at the Windsor Engine Plant Number One.

===Marine 351===
From the late 1960s through the early to mid-1990s, the 351 Windsor had a long history of being marinized by Holman Moody Marine, Redline of Lewiston, ID (now defunct), Pleasure Craft Marine (PCM), and Indmar for use in about every make of recreational boat, including; Correct Craft, Ski Supreme, Hydrodyne, MasterCraft, and Supra inboard competition ski boats. The early marinized engines were rated at . Most PCM and Indmar marinized 351s were rated at . In the early 1990s, a version and a high-output version that used GT-40 heads and the Holley 4160 marine carburetor was rated at . A few 351 GT-40/HO engines were marinized equipped with throttle-body fuel injection (TBI) and were rated at . The marine industry&#x27;s relationship with the 351W platform ended when Ford was unable or unwilling to compete with GM&#x27;s production of TBI- and MPI-equipped engines in mass quantity. During that time, the recreational marine community&#x27;s small-block V8 platform of choice shifted to the 350 cu in (5.7 L) Chevrolet L31 (Vortec 5700) engine series.

==Crate engines==
In the 2000s, Ford Racing Performance Parts sold two &quot;Boss&quot; crate engines and at least one 351 block. Most Ford racing versions of the 302 and 351 feature a siamesed bore and many of them feature drilled coolant crossover holes.

===FR Boss 302===
The new Boss 302 engine was unveiled in the 2006 SEMA show.

===FR Boss 351W===
The &quot;Racing Boss 351&quot; (not to be confused with the Ford 335 engine Cleveland-based Boss 351) is a crate engine based on the Ford Windsor engine, but uses Cleveland sized main bearing journals. Deck height choices include and . Maximum displacements are stroke and bore. The resulting maximum displacement is .

The uncross-drilled block with increased bore capacity became available from the third quarter of 2009. A Boss 351-based crate engine producing was available from the first quarter of 2010.

In 2010, the MSRP for the Boss 351 block was US$1,999.

<text>The Shawnee Hills are a region within the larger Interior Low Plateaus physiographic province located in southern Illinois, southern Indiana, and western Kentucky. In Illinois it rests mainly in an east–west arc roughly following the outline of the southern end of the Illinois Basin. Whereas Mississippian and Pennsylvanian Age rock layers are deep beneath the soil surface in central Illinois, these strata pierce the surface in southern Illinois. The Shawnee Hills are surface expressions of the more weather-resistant limestone and sandstone layers. This formation is due in part to the last glaciation of the Ice Age (which tended to grind down hills and bury them under soil) not reaching this far south.

Shawnee is the name used for a native American people, who historically resided in the Ohio Valley. The Shawnee Hills are often called the &quot;Illinois Ozarks&quot;, especially in promotional literature for tourism. But they are technically not a part of The Ozarks, a geologically similar area that for the most part begins just to the west across the Mississippi River floodplain in southeastern Missouri.

Within the Shawnee Hills, limestone is extensively quarried from outcrops, while both north and south of the Shawnee Hills, coal is mined by surface techniques on shallow coal seams near the edges of the Illinois Basin and by deep mining techniques in the deeper parts of the Basin. Additionally, extensive faulting in and around the Shawnee Hills occurred due to deep tectonic activities and formed sites for deposition of fluorite, a mineral used for production of the element fluorine. At one time, about 80% of the world&#x27;s fluorspar ore was mined near the towns of Rosiclare and Cave in Rock.

A large portion of the Shawnee Hills lies within the Shawnee National Forest. The beauty of the Shawnee Hills, the Shawnee National Forest, and the Ohio River Valley make the area a prime tourist destination.

The Shawnee Hills can be seen faintly from as far north as Vergennes. The westernmost portion of the hills rise south of Murphysboro and continue southward to Olive Branch. Large plains used for farmland separate the hills from the Mississippi River along Illinois Route 3, especially near the towns of Wolf Lake, Grand Tower and Ware. The Big Muddy River cuts through the hills south of Kinkaid Lake, making rocky cliffs that can be viewed by boat-ride down the river.

<text>Norzoanthamine is an alkaloid found in soft corals of the genus &quot;Zoanthus&quot; 

Norzoanthamine has been shown to suppress the loss of bone weight and strength in mice. Some derivatives of norzoanthamine also suppress development of some kind of leukemia cell lines and human platelet aggregation.

A laboratory synthesis of this compound was developed in 2004.

<text>Hawaii&#x27;s 1st congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Hawaii. The district is entirely on the island of Oahu, encompassing the urban areas of the City and County of Honolulu, a consolidated city-county that includes Oahu&#x27;s central plains and southern shores, including the towns of Aiea, Mililani, Pearl City, Waipahu, and Waimalu. The district is smaller and more densely populated than the 2nd congressional district (which comprises the rest of the state). It is represented by Democrat Ed Case.

==History==
When Hawaii and Alaska were admitted to the Union in 1959, both new states were granted one at-large representative to Congress, pending the next United States census. In the reapportionment following the 1960 U.S. census, Hawaii gained a second U.S. representative. Instead of creating two congressional districts, the state continued to elect its representatives at large. Two representatives were first elected in 1962, and Hawaii was first represented by two U.S. representatives on January 2, 1963, upon the convening of the 88th Congress.

The 1st congressional district was created in 1971, when Hawaii began electing its representatives from districts instead of electing at-large representatives statewide.

== Recent election results from statewide races ==
== Composition ==
For the 118th and successive Congresses (based on redistricting following the 2020 census), the district contains all or portions of the following counties and communities:

Honolulu County (20)

: East Honolulu, East Kapolei, &#x27;Ewa Beach, &#x27;Ewa Gentry, &#x27;Ewa Villages, Hālawa, Hickam Housing, Honolulu, Iroquois Point, Kalaeloa (part; also 2nd), Mililani Mauka, Ocean Pointe, Pearl City, Waikāne, Waikele, Waimalu, Waipahu, Waipi&#x27;o, Waipi&#x27;o Acres, West Loch Estate

<text>Locro or lojro (from the Quechua ) is a hearty thick squash or potato stew, associated with Native Andean civilizations, and popular along the Andes mountain range. It is one of the national dishes of Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile, Paraguay, Northwest Argentina and Southwestern Colombia.

== Composition ==
The dish is a classic squash, hominy, beans, and potato or pumpkin soup well known along the South American Andes. In some regions, locro is made using a specific kind of potato called , which has a unique taste and is difficult to find outside of its home region.

The defining ingredients are squash, corn, some form of meat (usually beef, but sometimes beef jerky or chorizo), and vegetables. Other ingredients vary widely and typically include onions, beans, squash, or pumpkin. It is mainly eaten in winter.

In Ecuador, a variant known as yahuarlocro is popular. It incorporates lamb entrails and lamb blood into the recipe.

In Peru, locro is a rather thick stew with macre pumpkin as the main ingredient. It includes potatoes, corn, chili, onions, cheese and green peas. It is usually served with white rice and occasionally with some kind of meat, but is traditionally a vegetarian dish.

In Argentina its consumption has spread from the Northwest and Cuyo to the rest of the country. In the Argentine province of Neuquén, in addition to locro made with corn, a kind of locro is prepared with peas, and in the Northeast of Argentina locro is also prepared on the basis of cassava.

Although the Argentine locro has Indo-American origins, its preparation in Argentina for at least three centuries synthesizes the European gastronomic contributions: for example, pork, chorizos, tripe and numerous seasonings have been contributed by the Europeans (especially by the Spanish).

There are several classic types of locro: corn, beans, cassava and wheat, although an expert cook can make an excellent synthesis of two or more of these types of locro to include all the ingredients.

Thus, the Argentine locro is prepared according to a multitude of recipes, the only invariable thing being its vegetable base and the cooking procedure, over low heat for several hours. According to the region, it is prepared with fresh or dried beef jerky (), offal (such as intestines, tripe, ribs, trotters, tail, ears and hide), sausages, pork ribs and bacon; the meats are cooked separately and then added to the preparation of vegetables, among which pumpkin usually stands out (especially the round, gray kind known as ), which usually gives its yellow color to the locro, and white corn grains, beans and even wheat grains. In Argentina locro with white corn is preferred. Locro based on crushed corn grains is called , vegetables which due to starch make the preparation reach the density of a cream. It is a hearty and nutritious dish typical of winter. It is seasoned accordingly, with a spicy sauce prepared with oil (or fat), ground chili, paprika, green onion and salt, called &quot;.&quot;

The succulent locro (dense and with varied and abundant ingredients) usually receives the name of ; on the other hand, it is called , &#x27;poor locro&#x27; without meat or (from Quechua ), to the &quot;light&quot; locro prepared with the minimum of ingredients and with a thick sticky consistency. A gastronomic variety close to is .

It is also called in Argentina to the locro that besides being substantial and full of calories is very spicy, like the locro with bell pepper as it happens in certain zones of the Argentine Northwest and especially in certain zones of the Argentine province of La Rioja.

Locro casserole is food with many calories and nutrients and is very suitable for consumption during winters or in cold areas. It is traditionally consumed on a massive scale on May 1 and May 25, the day that commemorates the May Revolution and the formation of the first Argentine patriotic government, which was established on May 25, 1810. For this reason, it has gone from being a regional and traditional dish to being one of Argentina&#x27;s national dishes to celebrate patriotic dates: on the two Argentine patriotic dates – May 25, date of the de facto or concrete independence of Argentina since 1810, and July 9, the date on which, in 1816 in San Miguel de Tucumán, Argentina&#x27;s independence was explicitly proclaimed. The breakfast of chocolate infusions with milk and pastries given in schools on May 25 and July 9 is usually traditional, as opposed to the also traditional mate cocido, which is usually given during most of each year in public schools, military barracks and regiments, etc., accompanied by . Eventually, there is the custom of inviting guests with small casseroles of locro at wedding celebrations.

On cold days, adults have as an excellent companion to a hot locro a good red wine such as Argentine malbec, and if the locro is consumed on warm days, a fresh and fruity honeyed Argentine torrontés white wine is preferable.

According to authors such as Victor Ego Ducrot, the Argentine locro became one of the Argentine national dishes during the Argentine War of Independence, and especially in the Gaucho War, when the gauchos who had fought in the ranks of the Army of the North then spread the typical stew of the Argentine Northwest in Argentina pampeana, litoral, cuyana, etcetera; on the anniversary of the Revolution of May, that is to say on May 25, 1910, practically (although no legislation is known in this respect) locro was made official as national food in the two main patriotic dates.

<doc id="859072" wikidata="Q3709057" url="?curid=859072" title="Vesting">
<text>In law, vesting is the point in time when the rights and interests arising from legal ownership of a property are acquired by some person. Vesting creates an immediately secured right of present or future deployment. One has a vested right to an asset that cannot be taken away by any third party, even though one may not yet possess the asset. When the right, interest, or title to the present or future possession of a legal estate can be transferred to any other party, it is termed a vested interest.

The concept can arise in any number of contexts, but the most common are inheritance law and retirement plan law. In real estate, to vest is to create an entitlement to a privilege or a right. For example, one may cross someone else&#x27;s property regularly and unrestrictedly for several years, and one&#x27;s right to an easement becomes vested. The original owner still retains the possession, but can no longer prevent the other party from crossing.

==Inheritance==
Some bequests do not vest immediately upon death of the testator. For example, many wills specify that an heir who dies within a set period (such as 60 days) is not to inherit, and further specify how the corresponding share is to be distributed. This is generally done to obviate disputes over the precise time of death, and to avoid paying taxes twice in rapid succession should multiple members of a family die in the wake of a disaster. Such a bequest does not vest until the expiration of the specified period, because the actual heir cannot be determined with certainty.

It is also possible to give a person, A, a life interest in a property, with the remainder to go to another person or persons, B. If the beneficiary of the remainder cannot yet be known, then the remainder is said not to have vested, and the remainder is said to be contingent. This may happen with entailed estates, or when property is left in trust to care for a child or relative without heirs. (See trust law for details).

==Employment==

===Retirement plans===
Vesting is an issue in conjunction with employer contributions to an employee stock option plan, deferred compensation plan, or to a retirement plan such as a 401(k), annuity or pension plan.

Once a retirement plan is fully vested, the employee has an absolute right to the entire amount of money in the account. It is a &quot;basic right that has been granted, or has accrued, and cannot be taken away&quot;; for example. one has a right to a vested pension.

Generally, the portion &quot;vested&quot; cannot be reclaimed by the employer, nor can it be used to satisfy the employer&#x27;s debts. Any portion not vested may be forfeited under certain conditions, such as termination of employment. The portion invested is often determined pro-rata.

Generally, for retirement plans in the United States, employees are fully vested in their own salary deferral contributions upon inception. For employer contributions, however, such as those from an employer matching program, the employer has limited options under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) to delay the vesting of their contributions to the employee. For example, the employer can say that the employee must work with the company for three years or they lose any employer contributed money, which is known as &quot;cliff vesting&quot;. Or it can choose to have the 20% of the contributions vest each year over five years, known as &quot;graduated vesting&quot; or &quot;graded vesting&quot;.

Choosing a vesting schedule allows an employer to selectively reward employees who remain employed for a period of time. In theory, this allows the employer to make greater contributions than would otherwise be prudent, because the money they contribute on behalf of employees goes to the ones they most want to reward.

===Ownership in startup companies===
Small entrepreneurial companies (&quot;startups&quot;) usually offer grants of common stock or positions in an employee stock option plan to employees and other key participants such as contractors, board members, advisors and major vendors. To make the reward commensurate with the extent of contribution, encourage loyalty, and avoid spreading ownership widely among former participants, these grants are usually subject to vesting arrangements.

Vesting of options is straightforward. The grantee receives an option to purchase a block of common stock, typically on commencement of employment, which vests over time. The option may be exercised at any time but only with respect to the vested portion. The entire option is lost if not exercised within a short period after the end of the employer relationship. The vesting operates simply by changing the status of the option over time from fully unexercisable to fully exercisable according to the vesting schedule.

Common stock grants are similar in function but the mechanism is different. An employee, typically a company founder, purchases stock in the company at nominal price shortly after the company is formed. The company retains a repurchase right to buy the stock back at the same price should the employee leave. The repurchase right diminishes over time so that the company eventually has no right to repurchase the stock (in other words, the stock becomes fully vested).

Beginning in the 1990s, vesting periods in the United States are usually 3–5 years for employees, but shorter for board members and others whose expected tenure at a company is shorter. The vesting schedule is most often a pro-rata monthly vesting over the period with a six or twelve month cliff. Alternative vesting models are becoming more popular including milestone-based vesting and dynamic equity vesting.

In the case of both stock and options, large initial grants that vest over time are more common than periodic smaller grants because they are easier to account for and administer, they establish the arrangement up-front and are thus more predictable, and (subject to some complexities and limitations) the value of the grants and holding period requirements for tax purposes are set upon the initial grant date, giving a considerable tax advantage to the employee.

=== Profit sharing plans ===

Profit-sharing plans are usually vested in ten years, although in some cases a plan may serve essentially as a pension by allowing a limited amount of vesting should the employee retire or leave on good terms after an extended period of employment.

== Vested rights doctrine in zoning law ==
The vested rights doctrine is the rule of zoning law by which an owner or developer is entitled to proceed in accordance with the prior zoning provision where there has been a substantial change of position, expenditures, or incurrence of obligations made in good faith by an innocent party under a building permit or in reliance upon the probability of its issuance.

== Vesting arrangements and terminology==

A &quot;vesting period&quot; is a period of time an investor or other person holding a right to something must wait until they are capable of fully exercising their rights and until those rights may not be taken away.

In many cases vesting does not occur all at once. Specific portions of the rights grant vest on different dates over the duration of the period of the vesting. When part of a right is vested and part remains unvested, it is considered &quot;partly vested&quot;.

In cases of partial vesting, a &quot;vesting schedule&quot; is a table or chart showing the portion of a right that is vested over time; typically the schedule provides for equal portions to vest on periodic vesting dates, usually once per day, month, quarter, or year, in stairstep fashion over the course of the vesting period. Often there is a cliff by which the first few steps in the graph are missing, so that there is no vesting at all for a period (usually six or twelve months in the case of employee equity), after which there is a cliff date upon which a large amount of vesting occurs all at once.

Some arrangements provide for &quot;accelerated vesting&quot;, by which all or a major portion of the unvested right vests all at once upon the occurrence of a specified event such as a termination of employment by the company or acquisition of the company by another. Less commonly, the vesting schedule may call for variable grants or subject to conditions such as reaching milestones or employee performance. &quot;Graded vesting&quot; or called retable vesting (vesting after each year until the employee is fully vested) may be &quot;uniform&quot; (e.g., 20% of the compensation vested each year for five years) or &quot;non-uniform&quot; (e.g., 20%, 30%, and 50% of the compensation vested each year for the next three years).

<text>Most [[lake]]s in [[Finland]] are small, but there are 309 lakes or reservoirs with a surface area larger than 10 km². There are about 5,600 lakes in Finland that are larger than 0.1 km² (10 hectares or 100&#x27;000 square metres), and 187,888 lakes larger than five ares (500 square metres / 5,382 sq.ft.). There is no standard unambiguous definition of the size requirements for a water body to be classified as a lake.  Saimaa is the largest lake in Finland, and the fourth-largest natural freshwater lake in Europe.
