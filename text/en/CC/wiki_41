<text>Antler (born Brad Burdick; 1946 in Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, U.S.) is an American poet who lives in Wisconsin.

Among other honors, Antler received the Whitman Prize from the Walt Whitman Association, given to the poet &quot;whose contribution best reveals the continuing presence of Walt Whitman in American poetry,&quot; in 1985. Antler also was awarded the Witter Bynner prize in 1987. Antler was the poet laureate of the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, for 2002 and 2003. He is also an advocate for wilderness protection.

== Education and career ==
Antler received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in anthropology from the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee in 1970. Later he completed a master&#x27;s degree in English from the same university after spending some time at the noted Iowa Writers&#x27; Workshop at the University of Iowa. During the 1970s he also worked at various factory and other jobs just long enough to get money to support his poetry writing and time spent in wilderness areas across the United States.

Antler&#x27;s first major work, the long poem &quot;Factory&quot;, was published by Lawrence Ferlinghetti&#x27;s City Lights Bookstore in 1980. Allen Ginsberg declared him as &quot;one of Whitman&#x27;s `poets and orators to come&#x27;&quot;. The collection &quot;Last Words&quot; appeared in 1986 from Ballantine Books, and &quot;Antler: The Selected Poems&quot; was published in 2000 by Soft Skull Press. He has also published several chapbooks and has contributed to numerous local, national, and international journals and anthologies.

== Writing style ==
His work reflects the influences of Walt Whitman, Allen Ginsberg, and the American traditions of transcendentalism and environmentalism. He celebrates the wilderness, often comparing urban, industrial life unfavorably with natural phenomena. His frank, sometimes earthy poems frequently exhibit sexual and spiritual energy entwined with the wonder of the natural world.

<text>Mark Brian Wise (born November 9, 1953, in Montreal, Quebec) is a Canadian-American theoretical physicist. He has conducted research in elementary particle physics and cosmology. He is best known for his role in the development of heavy quark effective theory (HQET), a mathematical formalism that has allowed physicists to make predictions about otherwise intractable problems in the theory of the strong nuclear interactions. He has also published work on mathematical models for finance and risk assessment.

==Biography==
Wise was born in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He was educated at the University of Toronto (B.S., 1976; M.S., 1977) and Stanford University (Ph.D., 1980). While still a student, he co-authored a book on mathematical methods in physics with Toronto professor Lynn Trainor. With Fred Gilman, his graduate advisor at Stanford, Wise wrote several highly influential papers on experimental predictions of the quark model. Wise was a junior fellow at the Harvard Society of Fellows from 1980 to 1983. He has been at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) since then.

Wise is currently the John A. McCone Professor of High Energy Physics at Caltech, a fellow of the American Physical Society (2003), and a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and of the National Academy of Sciences. From 1984 to 1987 he was a fellow of the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. He shared the 2001 Sakurai Prize for Theoretical Particle Physics with Nathan Isgur and Mikhail Voloshin, &quot;for the construction of the heavy quark mass expansion and the discovery of the heavy quark symmetry in quantum chromodynamics, which led to a quantitative theory of the decays of &quot;c&quot; and &quot;b&quot; flavored hadrons.&quot;

He has supervised over three dozen graduate students.

Wise was the science consultant for &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;.

<text>Glenn Vernice Cunningham (August 4, 1909 – March 10, 1988) was an American middle-distance runner, and was considered the greatest American miler of all time. He received the James E. Sullivan Award as the top amateur athlete in the United States in 1933.

==Early life==
Cunningham was born in Atlanta, Kansas and grew up in Elkhart, Kansas. When he was eight years old, his legs were very badly burned in an explosion caused by his brother accidentally putting gasoline instead of kerosene in the can at his school. His brother Floyd, 13, died in the fire. When the doctors recommended amputating Glenn&#x27;s legs, he was so distressed his parents would not allow it. The doctors predicted he might never walk normally again. He had lost all the flesh on his knees and shins and all the toes on his left foot. Also, his transverse arch was practically destroyed. However, his great determination, coupled with hours upon hours of a new type of therapy, enabled him to gradually regain the ability to walk and to proceed to run. It was in the early summer of 1919 when he first tried to walk again, roughly two years after the accident. He had a positive attitude as well as a strong religious faith. His favorite Bible verse was Isaiah 40:31: &quot;But those who wait on the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles, they shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not be faint.&quot;

==Accomplishments==

Cunningham competed in the 1500 m event at the 1932 and 1936 Summer Olympics and finished fourth and second, respectively. While on the ship, traveling from the U.S. to Germany in 1936, he was voted &quot;Most Popular Athlete&quot; by his fellow Olympians.

Cunningham won the Sullivan medal in 1933 for his achievements in middle-distance running. In 1934, he set the world record for the mile run at 4:06.8, which stood for three years. He also set world records in the 800 m in 1936 and in the indoor mile in 1938. Also in 1938, Cunningham set a personal best time in the mile run at 4:04.4 testing Dartmouth College&#x27;s Alumni Gymnasium indoor track, engineered to allow faster times than most indoor facilities. This time was not accepted as a world record, however, because Dartmouth had provided Cunningham pacing runners, which was against the rules at the time.

Cunningham&#x27;s unachieved goal was a four-minute mile, a goal attempted and unmet by many other runners. Several theorists proclaimed it was impossible physiologically for humans. Some athletes tried running steady and fast-paced the whole time. Others tried to go steady for the first half then give it all they had. Glenn worried about the strength of his legs burned in his youth, so he started slow – running in the pack. He would be fresher in the second half – and would almost be sprinting the last 100 yards to the finish.

Cunningham has a park named after him in his hometown of Elkhart, Kansas. The mile run at the Kansas Relays is named in his honor. In 1974 he was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame. In 2012, Cunningham was posthumously inducted in
to the National Distance Running Hall of Fame.

==Retirement==
Cunningham earned a master&#x27;s degree from the University of Iowa and a PhD from New York University. After retiring from competitions in 1940 he served as director of physical education at Cornell College in Iowa for four years. Later he opened the Glenn Cunningham Youth Ranch in Kansas, where he and his wife helped 10,000 needy and abused children.

<doc id="855850" wikidata="Q139143" url="?curid=855850" title="Extrusion">
<text>Extrusion is a process used to create objects of a fixed cross-sectional profile by pushing material through a die of the desired cross-section. Its two main advantages over other manufacturing processes are its ability to create very complex cross-sections; and to work materials that are brittle, because the material encounters only compressive and shear stresses. It also creates excellent surface finish and gives considerable freedom of form in the design process.
Drawing is a similar process, using the tensile strength of the material to pull it through the die. It limits the amount of change that can be performed in one step, so it is limited to simpler shapes, and multiple stages are usually needed. Drawing is the main way to produce wire. Metal bars and tubes are also often drawn.

Extrusion may be continuous (theoretically producing indefinitely long material) or semi-continuous (producing many pieces). It can be done with hot or cold material. Commonly extruded materials include metals, polymers, ceramics, concrete, modelling clay, and foodstuffs. Products of extrusion are generally called &quot;extrudates&quot;.

Also referred to as &quot;hole flanging&quot;, hollow cavities within extruded material cannot be produced using a simple flat extrusion die, because there would be no way to support the centre barrier of the die. Instead, the die assumes the shape of a block with depth, beginning first with a shape profile that supports the center section. The die shape then internally changes along its length into the final shape, with the suspended center pieces supported from the back of the die. The material flows around the supports and fuses to create the desired closed shape.

The extrusion of metals can also increase their strength.

==History==

In 1797, Joseph Bramah patented the first extrusion process for making pipe out of soft metals. It involved preheating the metal and then forcing it through a die via a hand-driven plunger. In 1820 Thomas Burr implemented that process for lead pipe, with a hydraulic press (also invented by Joseph Bramah). At that time the process was called &quot;squirting&quot;. In 1894, Alexander Dick expanded the extrusion process to copper and brass alloys.

==Types of extrusions==

The process begins by heating the stock material (for hot or warm extrusion). It is then loaded into the container in the press. A dummy block is placed behind it where the ram then presses on the material to push it out of the die. Afterward the extrusion is stretched in order to straighten it. If better properties are required then it may be heat treated or cold worked.

The extrusion ratio is defined as the starting cross-sectional area divided by the cross-sectional area of the final extrusion. One of the main advantages of the extrusion process is that this ratio can be very large while still producing quality parts.

===Hot extrusion===
Hot extrusion is a hot working process, which means it is done above the material&#x27;s recrystallization temperature to keep the material from work hardening and to make it easier to push the material through the die. Most hot extrusions are done on horizontal hydraulic presses that range from . Pressures range from , therefore lubrication is required, which can be oil or graphite for lower temperature extrusions, or glass powder for higher temperature extrusions. The biggest disadvantage of this process is its cost for machinery and its upkeep.

The extrusion process is generally economical when producing between several kilograms (pounds) and many tons, depending on the material being extruded. There is a crossover point where roll forming becomes more economical. For instance, some steels become more economical to roll if producing more than 20,000 kg (50,000 lb).

===Cold extrusion===
Cold extrusion is done at room temperature or near room temperature. The advantages of this over hot extrusion are the lack of oxidation, higher strength due to cold working, closer tolerances, better surface finish, and fast extrusion speeds if the material is subject to hot shortness.

Materials that are commonly cold extruded include: lead, tin, aluminium, copper, zirconium, titanium, molybdenum, beryllium, vanadium, niobium, and steel.

Examples of products produced by this process are: collapsible tubes, fire extinguisher cases, shock absorber cylinders and gear blanks.

===Warm extrusion===
In March 1956, a US patent was filed for &quot;process for warm extrusion of metal&quot;. Patent US3156043 A outlines that a number of important advantages can be achieved with warm extrusion of both ferrous and non-ferrous metals and alloys if a billet to be extruded is changed in its physical properties in response to physical forces by being heated to a temperature below the critical melting point. Warm extrusion is done above room temperature, but below the recrystallization temperature of the material the temperatures ranges from 800 to 1,800 °F (424 to 975 °C). It is usually used to achieve the proper balance of required forces, ductility and final extrusion properties.

===Friction extrusion===

Friction extrusion was invented at the Welding Institute in the UK and patented in 1991. It was originally intended primarily as a method for production of homogeneous microstructures and particle distributions in metal matrix composite materials. Friction extrusion differs from conventional extrusion in that the charge (billet or other precursor) rotates relative to the extrusion die. An extrusion force is applied so as to push the charge against the die. In practice either the die or the charge may rotate or they may be counter-rotating. The relative rotary motion between the charge and the die has several significant effects on the process. First, the relative motion in the plane of rotation leads to large shear stresses, hence, plastic deformation in the layer of charge in contact with and near the die. This plastic deformation is dissipated by recovery and recrystallization processes leading to substantial heating of the deforming charge. Because of the deformation heating, friction extrusion does not generally require preheating of the charge by auxiliary means potentially resulting in a more energy efficient process. Second, the substantial level of plastic deformation in the region of relative rotary motion can promote solid state welding of powders or other finely divided precursors, such as flakes and chips, effectively consolidating the charge (friction consolidation) prior to extrusion.

===Micro-extrusion===

Microextrusion is a microforming extrusion process performed at the submillimetre range. Like extrusion, metal is pushed through a die orifice, but the resulting product&#x27;s cross section can fit through a 1 mm square. Several microextrusion processes have been developed since microforming was envisioned in 1990. Forward (ram and billet move in the same direction) and backward (ram and billet move in the opposite direction) microextrusion were first introduced, with forward rod-backward cup and double cup extrusion methods developing later. Regardless of method, one of the greatest challenges of creating a successful microextrusion machine is the manufacture of the die and ram. &quot;The small size of the die and ram, along with the stringent accuracy requirement, needs suitable manufacturing processes.&quot; Additionally, as Fu and Chan pointed out in a 2013 state-of-the-art technology review, several issues must still be resolved before microextrusion and other microforming technologies can be implemented more widely, including deformation load and defects, forming system stability, mechanical properties, and other size-related effects on the crystallite (grain) structure and boundaries.

==Equipment==

There are many different variations of extrusion equipment. They vary by four major characteristics:

* Movement of the extrusion with relation to the ram. If the die is held stationary and the ram moves towards it then it is called &quot;direct extrusion&quot;. If the ram is held stationary and the die moves towards the ram it is called &quot;indirect extrusion&quot;.
* The position of the press, either vertical or horizontal
* The type of drive, either hydraulic or mechanical
* The type of load applied, either conventional (variable) or hydrostatic

A single or twin screw auger, powered by an electric motor, or a ram, driven by hydraulic pressure (often used for steel and titanium alloys), oil pressure (for aluminium), or in other specialized processes such as rollers inside a perforated drum for the production of many simultaneous streams of material.

===Forming internal cavities===
There are several methods for forming internal cavities in extrusions. One way is to use a hollow billet and then use a fixed or floating mandrel. A fixed mandrel, also known as a German type, means it is integrated into the dummy block and stem. A floating mandrel, also known as a French type, floats in slots in the dummy block and aligns itself in the die when extruding. If a solid billet is used as the feed material then it must first be pierced by the mandrel before extruding through the die. A special press is used in order to control the mandrel independently from the ram. The solid billet could also be used with a spider die, porthole die or bridge die. All of these types of dies incorporate the mandrel in the die and have &quot;legs&quot; that hold the mandrel in place. During extrusion the metal divides, flows around the legs, then merges, leaving weld lines in the final product.

===Direct extrusion===
Direct extrusion, also known as forward extrusion, is the most common extrusion process. It works by placing the billet in a heavy walled container. The billet is pushed through the die by a ram or screw. There is a reusable dummy block between the ram and the billet to keep them separated. The major disadvantage of this process is that the force required to extrude the billet is greater than that needed in the indirect extrusion process because of the frictional forces introduced by the need for the billet to travel the entire length of the container. Because of this the greatest force required is at the beginning of process and slowly decreases as the billet is used up. At the end of the billet the force greatly increases because the billet is thin and the material must flow radially to exit the die. The end of the billet (called the butt end) is not used for this reason.

===Indirect extrusion===
In indirect extrusion, also known as backwards extrusion, the billet and container move together while the die is stationary. The die is held in place by a &quot;stem&quot; which has to be longer than the container length. The maximum length of the extrusion is ultimately dictated by the column strength of the stem. Because the billet moves with the container the frictional forces are eliminated. This leads to the following advantages:
*A 25 to 30% reduction of friction, which allows for extruding larger billets, increasing speed, and an increased ability to extrude smaller cross-sections
*There is less of a tendency for extrusions to crack because there is no heat formed from friction
*The container liner will last longer due to less wear
*The billet is used more uniformly so extrusion defects and coarse grained peripherals zones are less likely.

The disadvantages are:
*Impurities and defects on the surface of the billet affect the surface of the extrusion. These defects ruin the piece if it needs to be anodized or the aesthetics are important. In order to get around this the billets may be wire brushed, machined or chemically cleaned before being used.
*This process is not as versatile as direct extrusions because the cross-sectional area is limited by the maximum size of the stem.

===Hydrostatic extrusion===
In the hydrostatic extrusion process the billet is completely surrounded by a pressurized liquid, except where the billet contacts the die. This process can be done hot, warm, or cold, however the temperature is limited by the stability of the fluid used. The process must be carried out in a sealed cylinder to contain the hydrostatic medium. The fluid can be pressurized two ways:

*&quot;Constant-rate extrusion&quot;: A ram or plunger is used to pressurize the fluid inside the container.
*&quot;Constant-pressure extrusion&quot;: A pump is used, possibly with a pressure intensifier, to pressurize the fluid, which is then pumped to the container.

The advantages of this process include:

*No friction between the container and the billet reduces force requirements. This ultimately allows for faster speeds, higher reduction ratios, and lower billet temperatures.
*Usually the ductility of the material increases when high pressures are applied
*An even flow of material
*Large billets and large cross-sections can be extruded
*No billet residue is left on the container walls

The disadvantages are:

*The billets must be prepared by tapering one end to match the die entry angle. This is needed to form a seal at the beginning of the cycle. Usually the entire billet needs to be machined to remove any surface defects.
*Containing the fluid under high pressures can be difficult.
*A billet remnant or a plug of a tougher material must be left at the end of the extrusion to prevent a sudden release of the extrusion fluid.

===Drives===
Most modern direct or indirect extrusion presses are hydraulically driven, but there are some small mechanical presses still used. Of the hydraulic presses there are two types: direct-drive oil presses and accumulator water drives.

Direct-drive oil presses are the most common because they are reliable and robust. They can deliver over 35 MPa (5,000 psi). They supply a constant pressure throughout the whole billet. The disadvantage is that they are slow, between 50 and 200 mm/s (2–8 ips).

Accumulator water drives are more expensive and larger than direct-drive oil presses, and they lose about 10% of their pressure over the stroke, but they are much faster, up to 380 mm/s (15 ips). Because of this they are used when extruding steel. They are also used on materials that must be heated to very hot temperatures for safety reasons.

Hydrostatic extrusion presses usually use castor oil at pressure up to 1,400 MPa (200 ksi). Castor oil is used because it has good lubricity and high pressure properties.

===Die design===
The design of an extrusion profile has a large impact on how readily it can be extruded. The maximum size for an extrusion is determined by finding the smallest circle that will fit around the cross-section, this is called the &quot;circumscribing circle&quot;. This diameter, in turn, controls the size of the die required, which ultimately determines if the part will fit in a given press. For example, a larger press can handle diameter circumscribing circles for aluminium and 55 cm (22 in) diameter circles for steel and titanium.

The complexity of an extruded profile can be roughly quantified by calculating the &quot;shape factor&quot;, which is the amount of surface area generated per unit mass of extrusion. This affects the cost of tooling as well as the rate of production.

Thicker sections generally need an increased section size. In order for the material to flow properly legs should not be more than ten times longer than their thickness. If the cross-section is asymmetrical, adjacent sections should be as close to the same size as possible. Sharp corners should be avoided; for aluminium and magnesium the minimum radius should be 0.4 mm (1/64 in) and for steel corners should be and fillets should be . The following table lists the minimum cross-section and thickness for various materials.

==Materials==

===Metal===
Metals that are commonly extruded include:
* Aluminium is the most commonly extruded material. Aluminium can be hot or cold extruded. If it is hot extruded it is heated to 575 to 1100 °F (300 to 600 °C). Examples of products include profiles for tracks, frames, rails, mullions, and heat sinks.
* Brass is used to extrude corrosion free rods, automobile parts, pipe fittings, engineering parts.
* Copper (1100 to 1825 °F (600 to 1000 °C)) pipe, wire, rods, bars, tubes, and welding electrodes. Often more than 100 ksi (690 MPa) is required to extrude copper.
* Lead and tin (maximum 575 °F (300 °C)) pipes, wire, tubes, and cable sheathing. Molten lead may also be used in place of billets on vertical extrusion presses.
* Magnesium (575 to 1100 °F (300 to 600 °C)) aircraft parts and nuclear industry parts. Magnesium is about as extrudable as aluminum.
* Zinc (400 to 650 °F (200 to 350 °C)) rods, bar, tubes, hardware components, fitting, and handrails.
* Steel (1825 to 2375 °F (1000 to 1300 °C)) rods and tracks. Usually plain carbon steel is extruded, but alloy steel and stainless steel can also be extruded.
* Titanium (1100 to 1825 °F (600 to 1000 °C)) aircraft components including seat tracks, engine rings, and other structural parts.

Magnesium and aluminium alloys usually have a RMS or better surface finish. Titanium and steel can achieve a RMS.

In 1950, Ugine Séjournet, of France, invented a process which uses glass as a lubricant for extruding steel. The Ugine-Sejournet, or Sejournet, process is now used for other materials that have melting temperatures higher than steel or that require a narrow range of temperatures to extrude, such as the platinum-iridium alloy used to make kilogram mass standards. The process starts by heating the materials to the extruding temperature and then rolling it in glass powder. The glass melts and forms a thin film, 20 to 30 mils (0.5 to 0.75 mm), in order to separate it from chamber walls and allow it to act as a lubricant. A thick solid glass ring that is 0.25 to 0.75 in (6 to 18 mm) thick is placed in the chamber on the die to lubricate the extrusion as it is forced through the die. A second advantage of this glass ring is its ability to insulate the heat of the billet from the die. The extrusion will have a 1 mil thick layer of glass, which can be easily removed once it cools.

Another breakthrough in lubrication is the use of phosphate coatings. With this process, in conjunction with glass lubrication, steel can be cold extruded. The phosphate coat absorbs the liquid glass to offer even better lubricating properties.

===Plastic===


Plastics extrusion commonly uses plastic chips or pellets, which are usually dried, to drive out moisture, in a hopper before going to the feed screw. The polymer resin is heated to molten state by a combination of heating elements and shear heating from the extrusion screw. The screw, or screws as the case with twin screw extrusion, forces the resin through a die, forming the resin into the desired shape. The extrudate is cooled and solidified as it is pulled through the die or water tank. A &quot;caterpillar haul-off&quot; (called a &quot;puller&quot; in the US) is used to provide tension on the extrusion line which is essential for overall quality of the extrudate. Pelletizers can also create this tension while pulling extruded strands in to be cut. The caterpillar haul-off must provide a consistent pull; otherwise, variation in cut lengths or distorted product will result. In some cases (such as fibre-reinforced tubes) the extrudate is pulled through a very long die, in a process called &quot;pultrusion&quot;. The configuration of the interior screws are a driving force dependent on the application. Mixing elements or convey elements are used in various formations. Extrusion is common in the application of adding colorant to molten plastic thus creating specific custom color.

Extrusion is also a process used in fused filament deposition 3D printers, whereby the extruder is often composed of a geared motor pushing plastic filament through a nozzle.

===Rubber ===
Rubber extrusion is a method used to make rubber items. In this process, either synthetic or natural rubber that hasn&#x27;t been hardened yet is put through a machine called an extruder. This machine has a desired shaped mold and a pressurized conveyor system. The rubber gets heated and softened in the extruder, making it bendable. It then gets pushed through the mold, which gives it its final shape.

The extruder consists of two main parts: a screw that moves the rubber along the conveyor while adding other materials, and a mold where the soft rubber is squeezed into. After the rubber gets its shape from the mold, it is then vulcanized to harden it into a usable product.

This method is effective for large rubber pieces that are long and have a consistent shape, and the dies used in this process are inexpensive. It is often used to make things like rubber seals or hoses. Polymers are used in the production of plastic tubing, pipes, rods, rails, seals, and sheets or films.

===Ceramic===
Ceramic can also be formed into shapes via extrusion. Terracotta extrusion is used to produce pipes. Many modern bricks are also manufactured using a brick extrusion process.

==Applications==

===Food===


With the advent of industrial manufacturing, extrusion found application in food processing of instant foods and snacks, along with its already known uses in plastics and metal fabrication. The main role of extrusion was originally developed for conveying and shaping fluid forms of processed raw materials. Present day, extrusion cooking technologies and capabilities have developed into sophisticated processing functions including: mixing, conveying, shearing, separation, heating, cooling, shaping, co-extrusion, venting volatiles and moisture, encapsulation, flavor generation and sterilization. Products such as certain pastas, many breakfast cereals, premade cookie dough, some french fries, certain baby foods, dry or semi-moist pet food and ready-to-eat snacks are mostly manufactured by extrusion. It is also used to produce modified starch, and to pelletize animal feed.

Generally, high-temperature extrusion is used for the manufacture of ready-to-eat snacks, while cold extrusion is used for the manufacture of pasta and related products intended for later cooking and consumption. The processed products have low moisture and hence considerably higher shelf life, and provide variety and convenience to consumers.
In the extrusion process, raw materials are first ground to the correct particle size. The dry mix is passed through a pre-conditioner, in which other ingredients may be added, and steam is injected to start the cooking process. The preconditioned mix is then passed through an extruder, where it is forced through a die and cut to the desired length. The cooking process takes place within the extruder where the product produces its own friction and heat due to the pressure generated (10–20 bar). The main independent parameters during extrusion cooking are feed rate, particle size of the raw material, barrel temperature, screw speed and moisture content. The extruding process can induce both protein denaturation and starch gelatinization, depending on inputs and parameters. Sometimes, a catalyst is used, for example, when producing texturised vegetable proteins (TVP).

===Drug carriers===

For use in pharmaceutical products, extrusion through nano-porous, polymeric filters is being used to produce suspensions of lipid vesicles liposomes or transfersomes with a particular size of a narrow size distribution. The anti-cancer drug Doxorubicin in liposome delivery system is formulated by extrusion, for example. Hot melt extrusion is also utilized in pharmaceutical solid oral dose processing to enable delivery of drugs with poor solubility and bioavailability. Hot melt extrusion has been shown to molecularly disperse poorly soluble drugs in a polymer carrier increasing dissolution rates and bioavailability. The process involves the application of heat, pressure and agitation to mix materials together and ‘extrude’ them through a die. Twin-screw high shear extruders blend materials and simultaneously break up particles. The resulting particle can be blended with compression aids and compressed into tablets or filled into unit dose capsules.

===Biomass briquettes===
The extrusion production technology of fuel briquettes is the process of extrusion screw wastes (straw, sunflower husks, buckwheat, etc.) or finely shredded wood waste (sawdust) under high pressure when heated from 160 to 350 °C. The resulting fuel briquettes do not include any of the binders, but one natural – the lignin contained in the cells of plant wastes. The temperature during compression causes melting of the surface of bricks, making it more solid, which is important for the transportation of briquettes.

===Textiles===
The majority of synthetic materials in textiles are manufactured with extrusion only. Fiber forming substances are used in extrusion to form various synthetic filaments. The molten materials are passed through a spinneret that helps in forming fibers.

<text>Nuclear quadrupole resonance spectroscopy or NQR is a chemical analysis technique related to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). Unlike NMR, NQR transitions of nuclei can be detected in the absence of a magnetic field, and for this reason NQR spectroscopy is referred to as &quot;zero Field NMR&quot;. The NQR resonance is mediated by the interaction of the electric field gradient (EFG) with the quadrupole moment of the nuclear charge distribution. Unlike NMR, NQR is applicable only to solids and not liquids, because in liquids the electric field gradient at the nucleus averages to zero (the EFG tensor has trace zero). Because the EFG at the location of a nucleus in a given substance is determined primarily by the valence electrons involved in the particular bond with other nearby nuclei, the NQR frequency at which transitions occur is unique for a given substance. A particular NQR frequency in a compound or crystal is proportional to the product of the nuclear quadrupole moment, a property of the nucleus, and the EFG in the neighborhood of the nucleus. It is this product which is termed the nuclear quadrupole coupling constant for a given isotope in a material and can be found in tables of known NQR transitions. In NMR, an analogous but not identical phenomenon is the coupling constant, which is also the result of an internuclear interaction between nuclei in the analyte.

==Principle==
Any nucleus with more than one unpaired nuclear particle (protons or neutrons) will have a charge distribution which results in an electric quadrupole moment. Allowed nuclear energy levels are shifted unequally due to the interaction of the nuclear charge with an electric field gradient supplied by the non-uniform distribution of electron density (e.g. from bonding electrons) and/or surrounding ions. As in the case of NMR, irradiation of the nucleus with a burst of RF electromagnetic radiation may result in absorption of some energy by the nucleus which can be viewed as a perturbation of the quadrupole energy level. Unlike the NMR case, NQR absorption takes place in the absence of an external magnetic field. Application of an external static field to a quadrupolar nucleus splits the quadrupole levels by the energy predicted from the Zeeman interaction. The technique is very sensitive to the nature and symmetry of the bonding around the nucleus. It can characterize phase transitions in solids when performed at varying temperature. Due to symmetry, the shifts become averaged to zero in the liquid phase, so NQR spectra can only be measured for solids.

===Analogy with NMR===
In the case of NMR, nuclei with spin ≥ 1/2 have a magnetic dipole moment so that their energies are split by a magnetic field, allowing resonance absorption of energy related to the Larmor frequency:

where formula_1 is the gyromagnetic ratio and formula_2 is the (normally applied) magnetic field external to the nucleus.

In the case of NQR, nuclei with spin ≥ 1, such as 14N, 17O, 35Cl and 63Cu, also have an electric quadrupole moment. The nuclear quadrupole moment is associated with non-spherical nuclear charge distributions. As such it is a measure of the degree to which the nuclear charge distribution deviates from that of a sphere; that is, the prolate or oblate shape of the nucleus. NQR is a direct observation of the interaction of the quadrupole moment with the local electric field gradient (EFG) created by the electronic structure of its environment. The NQR transition frequencies are proportional to the product of the electric quadrupole moment of the nucleus and a measure of the strength of the local EFG: 

where q is related to the largest principal component of the EFG tensor at the nucleus. formula_3 is referred to as the quadrupole coupling constant.

In principle, the NQR experimenter could apply a specified EFG in order to influence formula_4 just as the NMR experimenter is free to choose the Larmor frequency by adjusting the magnetic field. However, in solids, the strength of the EFG is many kV/m^2, making the application of EFG&#x27;s for NQR in the manner that external magnetic fields are chosen for NMR impractical. Consequently, the NQR spectrum of a substance is specific to the substance - and NQR spectrum is a so called &quot;chemical fingerprint.&quot; Because NQR frequencies are not chosen by the experimenter, they can be difficult to find making NQR a technically difficult technique to carry out. Since NQR is done in an environment without a static (or DC) magnetic field, it is sometimes called &quot;zero field NMR&quot;. Many NQR transition frequencies depend strongly upon temperature.

=== Derivation of resonance frequency ===
Consider a nucleus with a non-zero quadrupole moment formula_5 and charge density formula_6, which is surrounded by a potential formula_7. This potential may be produced by the electrons as stated above, whose probability distribution might be non-isotropic in general. The potential energy in this system equals to the integral over the charge distribution formula_6 and the potential formula_7 within a domain formula_10:

formula_11One can write the potential as a Taylor-expansion at the center of the considered nucleus. This method corresponds to the multipole expansion in cartesian coordinates (note that the equations below use the Einstein sum-convention):

formula_12

The first term involving formula_13 will not be relevant and can therefore be omitted. Since nuclei do not have an electric dipole moment formula_14, which would interact with the electric field formula_15, the first derivatives can also be neglected. One is therefore left with all nine combinations of second derivatives. However if one deals with a homogeneous oblate or prolate nucleus the matrix formula_16 will be diagonal and elements with formula_17 vanish. This leads to a simplification because the equation for the potential energy now contains only the second derivatives in respect to the same variable:

formula_18The remaining terms in the integral are related to the charge distribution and hence the quadrupole moment. The formula can be simplified even further by introducing the electric field gradient formula_19 , choosing the z-axis as the one with the maximal principal component formula_20 and using the Laplace equation to obtain the proportionality written above. For an formula_21 nucleus one obtains with the frequency-energy relation formula_22:

formula_23

==Applications==
NQR probes the interaction between the nuclear quadrupole moment and the electric field gradient at the nucleus. Since the EFG tensor arises from the electron cloud density around a particular region, NQR is highly sensitive to changes in electron charge distribution surrounding the NQR-active nucleus. Such sensitivity makes NQR spectroscopy a useful method for the study of bonding, structural features, phase transitions, and molecular dynamics in solid-state compounds. 

For example, NQR spectroscopy has proven to be a useful tool in the realm of pharmaceuticals. More specifically, the application of 14N-NQR has allowed for the differentiation of enantiomeric compounds from racemic mixtures; namely in, D-serine and L-serine. These two compounds, despite their similar composition, possess distinct properties. On one hand, D-serine is a potential biomarker for Alzheimer’s disease as well as a treatment for schizophrenia. L-serine, on the other hand, is a drug undergoing FDA-approved human clinical trials due to its potential in treating amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Through NQR the mixture of L/D-serine can be differentiated from pure L/D-serine. Note that L-serine and D-serine cannot be differentiated due to being related by a reflection. 

Similarly, NQR possesses the ability to differentiate between crystalline polymorphs. Sulfonamide-containing drugs, for example, have shown to be susceptible to polymorphism. Differences in NQR frequencies, along with the quadrupole coupling constants and asymmetry parameters, allow differentiation between polymorphs as can be done with enantiomeric compounds. Distinguishing between polymorphs in such a manner makes NQR a powerful tool for authenticating drugs against counterfeits.

There are several research groups around the world currently working on ways to use NQR to detect explosives. Units designed to detect landmines and explosives concealed in luggage have been tested. A detection system consists of a radio frequency (RF) power source, a coil to produce the magnetic excitation field and a detector circuit which monitors for a RF NQR response coming from the explosive component of the object.

A fake device known as the ADE 651 claimed to exploit NQR to detect explosives but in fact could do no such thing. Nonetheless, the device was successfully sold for millions to dozens of countries, including the government of Iraq.

Another practical use for NQR is measuring the water/gas/oil coming out of an oil well in realtime.
This particular technique allows local or remote monitoring of the extraction process, calculation of the well&#x27;s remaining capacity and the water/detergents ratio the input pump must send to efficiently extract oil.

Due to the strong temperature dependence of the NQR frequency, it can be used as a precise temperature sensor with resolution on the order of 10−4 °C.

The main limitation for this technique arises from isotopic abundance. NQR requires the presence of a non-zero quadrupole moment, which is only observed in nuclei with a nuclear spin greater than or equal to one (&quot;I ≥ 1&quot;) and whose local charge distribution deviates from spherical symmetry. NQR requires fairly large sample sizes due to the signals being of very low intensity. This poses experimental obstacles due to a large majority of NQR-active nuclei having low isotopic abundances. Nevertheless, NQR spectroscopy has still proven useful in various contexts – as discussed above.

<text>The Great North Walk is a walking track which runs from Sydney to Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia. The main track, in length, runs between the Obelisk in Macquarie Place in Sydney to Queens Wharf in Bicentennial Park in Newcastle and is well sign-posted. There are many &quot;side tracks&quot; which link the track to populated areas along the length of the walk. The walk includes a huge variety of wildlife and scenery.

A section at the northern, Newcastle end, is also known as the Yuelarbah Track. This section runs from Teralba railway station to the Queens Wharf on Newcastle Harbour. At Kahibah Station, the Great North Walk uses a short section of The Fernleigh Track and passes along the northern side of Glenrock Lagoon to get to the coast.

== History ==

The Great North Walk was initiated by Gary McDougall and Leigh Shearer-Heriot. They both planned and marked the original route from Sydney to Newcastle, with access to many linking tracks. Today&#x27;s Great North Walk is quite true to the original trail. There have been books written about the walk.

The original name for the Great North Walk was the &#x27;Sydney to Hunter Project&#x27;. The name &#x27;the Great North Walk&#x27; was derived from the first road from the Hunter Valley to Sydney, called the Great North Road. Construction began in 1987 and was completed less than a year later in early 1988, in time for the Australian Bicentennial celebrations. Workers from several countries including China, Thailand and Vietnam were hired by the NSW State Government to complete the track by 1988. A small amount of local controversy followed as the labourers won the contract to construct the track over a local landscaping and environmental business. Claim was made that the contract was only won because it cost as much as three times less than the local bid.

The company, Ning-Pow Australia, who were responsible for providing the labourers for the project, were heavily scrutinised for slow construction and poor treatment of their workers. The track was eventually finished but was of poor quality. Following the bicentennial year, the NSW State Government handed over maintenance responsibility to each sections respective land owners, mainly NSW NSW National Parks &amp; Wildlife Service and State Forests. Under new responsibility, the track was upgraded to a higher quality. In several places the track had to be re-constructed taking completely different routes, because the original had been so terribly built. Eventually, the track was completed to a good standard and remains well maintained in most places.

==Description==

After its official start in Macquarie Place, the walk continues through the suburb of Hunters Hill, where there are many heritage homes, then arrives at the Lane Cove River. It follows the river through the Lane Cove National Park to Thornleigh, then follows Berowra Creek. Further north, the track crosses over to the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park before proceeding to Brooklyn, on the Hawkesbury River. The river can be crossed either by train or boat, after which the track proceeds north through Brisbane Water National Park and the Ourimbah Valley before reaching the Watagan State Forest. Further north, the track veers east in the vicinity of Brunkerville and follows the Myall Range for some distance before reaching Teralba, on the southern fringes of Newcastle. It then proceeds to its official finishing point in Newcastle.

In addition to the main track between Sydney and Newcastle, there is an extension that goes north to the Hunter Valley. The extension departs from the main track in the vicinity of Brunkerville, and proceeds along a country road to the village of Paxton, passing abandoned coal mines along the way. From Paxton it proceeds north and follows the Mount View Range, where there are extensive views in the direction of Cessnock. The track then descends the northern end of the range before terminating in the wine-making area of Pokolbin.

The total walk from Sydney to Newcastle takes between 8 and 14 days to complete, with popular camp sites at designated spots along the way. Many of these sites are on ridge tops with no available water supply. Where natural standing water is available, it is not necessarily safe to drink and should be treated before use.

It is not necessary to do the walk in one go; individual sections can be completed easily as day walks. The track is often close to the Main North railway line, providing convenient rail access at a number of points. Some early sections in Sydney are through local suburbs on sealed roads. There are more than a dozen ancient Aboriginal rock art sites along the route. The best time to take this walk is late autumn, winter and spring. Summer is extremely hot and should be avoided, particularly if bushfire risk is high.

There are different versions of the Overseas Service Ribbons for the U.S. Army, U.S. Navy, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Space Force, and the U.S. Coast Guard. Both the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Marines receive the Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon.

==Army==
The Army Overseas Service Ribbon was first issued in August 1981. It is presented to any member of the United States Army who completes a standard overseas tour of duty.

The length of a standard tour is dependent upon the duty location and whether the Soldier is accompanied or unaccompanied with a spouse/family member(s). The tour in question may be cut one month short due to manning requirements (not due to Soldier misconduct) and still receive full credit for the tour length. There are two types of tour designations, long tours (24+ months) and short tours (6–23 months). Anything shorter than 6 months is considered TDY (Temporary Duty Assignment). The standard unaccompanied Korean tour is 12 months, and accompanied is 24 months. The German tour is 36 months for unaccompanied and accompanied. Combat tours are typically 6–12 months and can extend beyond during critical periods. The Iraqi Surge campaign tour was 15 months.

In the 11 December 2006 revision of AR 600-8-22 (Military Awards), the Army eliminated the policy which had restricted the awarding of the Overseas Service Ribbon when another campaign or service medal is awarded.

Additional awards of the Army Overseas Service Ribbon are denoted by award numerals. For those Army service members performing overseas duty prior to 1981, the Army Overseas Service Ribbon may be awarded retroactively, provided that a service member was on active duty subsequent to 1981.

For time served in designated combat zones, the Army also issues an Overseas Service Bar.

==Navy and Marine Corps==
The Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon was first proposed in 1968, but not authorized until 17 September 1986. The ribbon is awarded to any member of the Navy or Marine Corps who completes one year of consecutive or cumulative duty at a permanent overseas duty station.

For inactive members of the reserve components, the first award is authorized upon completion of either 30 consecutive or 45 cumulative days of overseas duty, regardless of the type of orders. For subsequent awards, the criteria of award for reservists are the same as the active duty members criteria.

In 1999, a directive of the Chief of Naval Operations permitted those personnel stationed on overseas homeported naval vessels to receive the Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon. Prior to this time, such personnel were only eligible to receive the Sea Service Deployment Ribbon. Current regulations now permit the receipt of both ribbons for the same tour of duty.

Additional awards of the Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon are denoted by service stars.

The Sea Service Deployment Ribbon (SSDR) and Navy and Marine Corps Overseas Service Ribbon (OSR) will be awarded to IAs deploying to Afghanistan (OEF) and Iraq (OIF) in accordance with SECNAVINST 1650.1H. However, the OEF and OIF AOEs may be qualifying areas for either ribbon, depending upon the circumstances of the individual. The following amplifying guidance is provided.

* The 12-month accumulated sea duty requirement for the SSDR is waived for OEF (11 Sep 1 – TBD) and OIF (19 Mar 2003 – TBD) to qualify for the initial award of the ribbon only. The 12-month requirement still applies for second and subsequent awards.
* Individuals with subsequent deployments to the OEF or OIF AOEs may elect to use that deployment time towards qualifying for EITHER a subsequent SSDR or the OSR. The member must elect in writing which ribbon the subsequent deployment time will be credited towards, and may NOT divide the deployment time between the two ribbons. The entire deployment time will be credited towards ONE of the ribbons. 

==Air Force and Space Force==
The Air and Space Overseas Service Ribbon (ASOR) was approved in 1980 by order of General Lew Allen, Air Force Chief of Staff. The award is issued in two grades, being that of &quot;short tour&quot; and &quot;long tour.&quot; On 16 November 2020, the Air Force Overseas Service Ribbon was renamed to the Air and Space Overseas Service Ribbon by the Secretary of the Air Force.

The Air and Space Overseas Short Tour Service Ribbon is awarded for less than two years of duty or as directed by Department of the Air Force policies. Normally, the Short Tour Service Ribbon is awarded for a permanent duty assignment of at least 300 days within an 18-month time span; such assignments are generally served unaccompanied by family members, though a short tour assignment need not be unaccompanied. Historically, most Short Tour Service Ribbons were awarded for service in South Korea, by far the most common short tour assignment in the USAF. From June 2003 until April 2011, Airmen serving in hostile environments for 181 days or more qualified for the Short Tour Service Ribbon under a temporary exception to rules outlined in AFI 36–2110. However, this exemption was rescinded by General Norton A. Schwartz in April 2011 and Airmen will no longer qualify for the award if they arrive in a hostile environment on or after 1 July 2011.

The Air and Space Overseas Long Tour Service Ribbon is issued for completion of a standard overseas service assignment of two years or more in length with additional awards denoted by oak leaf clusters. Long tour credit is awarded for completion of an overseas long tour (2 years) prescribed by Department of the Air Force Instructions, or to any member assigned to a United States or overseas location who is subsequently sent under temporary duty orders (to include combat tours) for 365 or more days within a 3-year time frame.

Additional awards of the Air and Space Overseas Service Ribbon are denoted by oak leaf clusters and Department of the Air Force regulations permit the receipt and wear of both the short and long tour ribbons simultaneously, wherein the short tour ribbon takes a higher precedence by being worn to the wearer&#x27;s right of the long tour ribbon. The &quot;A&quot; device is authorized only on the short tour ribbon to any service member who performs a tour of duty at an arctic based Air Force or Space Force facility; most commonly Pituffik Space Base in Greenland.

==Coast Guard==
The Coast Guard Overseas Service Ribbon was approved on 28 October 2009 with details announced on 29 April 2010. It is awarded to active duty members on a permanent assignment and who successfully complete a tour of duty of at least 12 months at an overseas shore-based duty station or on board a cutter permanently assigned to an overseas area. It is also awarded to reservists who are permanently assigned and have satisfactorily completed a minimum of 36 cumulative days of service at an overseas duty station during each 12-month period of the total tour of duty.

Duty on board U.S.-based deploying ships or units does not qualify. Personnel who are eligible to receive the Coast Guard&#x27;s Restricted Duty Ribbon are not eligible to receive the Overseas Service Ribbon for the same period. The ribbon may be awarded retroactively to qualifying individuals for initial award only. Subsequent awards are authorized, and are indicated by small bronze or silver service stars.

==Army Reserve Components Overseas Training Ribbon==
The Army Reserve Components Overseas Training Ribbon (ARCOTR) was established by the United States Secretary of the Army (SECARMY) on 11 July 1984 as announced in DAGO 1990–15. It is awarded to members of the Reserve Component (RC) of the Army (ARNG and USAR), for successful completion of annual training or ADT for a period not less than 10 consecutive duty days on foreign soil. All ARNG and USAR Soldiers who accompany the RC unit (including unit cells) to which they are assigned or attached as active duty for operational support during overseas training are also eligible for the award. Effective 11 July 1984, all members of the ARNG and USAR are eligible for this award if they were active Reserve status members of the ARNG, USAR (not on active duty in the Active Army), or AGR Soldiers at the time their unit underwent annual training or ADT on foreign soil. Additional awards are denoted by numerals.

The Army Reserve and Army National Guard are the only reserve components which issue an overseas ribbon for training outside of the United States.

<doc id="855902" wikidata="Q6133281" url="?curid=855902" title="Open-air preaching">
<text>Open-air preaching, street preaching, or public preaching is the act of evangelizing a religious faith in public places. It is an ancient method of proselytizing a religious or social message and has been used by many cultures and religious traditions, but today it is usually associated with evangelical Protestant Christianity. Supporters of this approach note that both Jesus and many of the Old Testament prophets often preached about God in public places. It is one of the oldest approaches to evangelism.

==In the Bible==

One of the earliest open-air preachers of Christianity, according to the gospels, was Jesus Christ, whose first specifically recorded sermon was the Sermon on the Mount, which took place on a mountainside in the open air. In the Gospel of Luke (), it was recorded that Jesus also gave an open-air sermon known as the Sermon on the Plain. In Mark 16:15, street preaching is seen as a commandment from Jesus as a way to warn people about sins and their consequences. This is supported by Isaiah 58:1 and Jeremiah 2:2.

After Jesus&#x27; death and resurrection, many of his apostles and followers started street preaching the gospel in the Temple of Jerusalem and in other open spaces. 

The Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry lists the &quot;many examples of street preaching in the Bible&quot; as including Noah, Solomon, Ezra, Jeremiah, Jonah, John the Baptist, Jesus Christ, Peter, Paul, Phillip and Apollos.

==Middle Ages and Reformation==
Open-air preaching was used by mendicant orders in the High Middle Ages to initiate a renewal of religious fervor among Catholics, and to fight heretical movements such as Catharism in southern France. Later, during the Protestant Reformation, it was often employed by Protestants throughout Europe who could not always preach inside churches, which were mostly Catholic. Open-air preaching in Europe continued during the rise of Puritanism and other Protestant movements. It was often used in Pastoral environments as well as in cities, the former sometimes due to a desire to avoid the authorities, and the latter because, for one reason, it could reach eccentric people living in cities who would not otherwise hear the gospel.

==Evangelical Revivals==
Early Methodist preachers John Wesley and George Whitefield preached in the open air, which allowed them to attract crowds larger than most buildings could accommodate. On one occasion when Wesley was forbidden to preach inside the church in his hometown, Epworth, he used his father&#x27;s tombstone in the churchyard as a pulpit. Whitefield stated: &quot;I believe I never was more acceptable to my Master than when I was standing to teach those hearers in the open fields ... I now preach to ten times more people than I should, if had been confined to the churches.&quot;

Open-air preachers throughout history have often noted that preaching to large crowds often causes preachers to be abused in certain ways, even having objects thrown at them such as rotting vegetables or unsanitary liquids of many varieties. It was said that one of the regular practices of American evangelist Dwight L. Moody in the late 1860s &quot;was to exhort the passersby in the evenings from the steps of the court house. Often these impromptu gatherings drew as many hecklers as supporters.&quot;

In the late 19th century and early-to-mid 20th century many famous open-air preachers in the United States began to preach, such as Billy Graham and Billy Sunday. Graham in particular used a combination of open-air preaching and the recent advent of televangelism to broadcast his sermons, which often took place in large venues such as stadiums, to large portions of the world and millions of Americans.

Charles Spurgeon, the famous open-air Baptist preacher of England, believed that open-air preaching was instrumental in getting people to hear the gospel who might otherwise never hear it, and today, open-air preachers such as Ray Comfort believe that it reaches many more people at once than other approaches to evangelism do.

<doc id="855906" wikidata="Q4835333" url="?curid=855906" title="BC Tel">
<text>British Columbia Telephone Company, later known as BC Tel, was the telephone company operating throughout the province of British Columbia, Canada. For most of its history, BC Tel was one of several regional monopolies in Canada. In 1985, the Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) restored competition in long-distance telephone service. In 1998, BC Tel merged with Telus to become the second largest telecommunications company in Canada.

==Early decades==
In 1904, the Victoria &amp; Esquimalt Telephone Company and the New Westminster &amp; Burrard Inlet Telephone Company were taken over by The Vernon &amp; Nelson Telephone Company. That year, the name of the company was changed to the British Columbia Telephone Company Limited. In 1916, the company obtained a federal charter and dropped the word Limited from its name.

Theodore Gary &amp; Company bought a substantial interest in BC Telephone in December 1926 (held in Canada under the Anglo-Canadian Telephone Company). Other Gary companies at the time included International Automatic Telephone Company and British Insulated Cables. Mr G H Halse remained as president and general manager of BC Telephone. In July 1927, the company participated in Canada&#x27;s first coast to coast radio broadcast for Canada&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee.

==Two regional operations==
On the 1 April 1929, a charter was obtained for a new subsidiary called &quot;North-West Telephone Company&quot; (NWT). This company adopted radio-telephony for areas of the province unreachable by wire. The first experiment was providing a connection to Powell River from Campbell River, about across the water.

A new record for storm damage in the BC Telephone system was set little over a year after the previous record. The rain and sleet began early in the morning of 21 January 1935. There were 1,500 poles and 700 miles of wire down in the Fraser Valley. Victoria had 1,800 telephones out of service. The Trans-Canada toll line was not restored until 10 February 1935. The first photographs ever to be transmitted from Vancouver via wire photo service took place during the royal visit of 29 May 1939.

In April 1954, the federal government telephone system west of the Rockies was purchased and the operations split with the NWT. GTE of Stamford, Connecticut, became a 50.2% owner of BC Telephone when the Theodore Gary Company merged with GTE in 1955.

In January 1961, the NWT was officially merged with its parent. In 1979, the BC Telephone Company acquired Automatic Electric Canada and formed &quot;AEL Microtel&quot;. Soon afterward, the name was shortened to &quot;Microtel&quot;. In 1982, &quot;BTE - Business Terminal Equipment&quot; was formed to compete in the newly deregulated equipment field. BC Telephone formed &quot;BC Cellular&quot; in 1985 to compete in the new cellular telephone business. On 1 May 1993, BC Telephone reorganised under holding company &quot;BC Telecom Inc&quot; and changed its legal name to &quot;BC Tel&quot;.

==Telus merger==
The deregulation of the phone industry in the 1990s, combined with the competition between line and cell transmission technology, totally changed the business environment. In a 1999 &quot;merger of equals&quot;, BC Tel bought the smaller Telus, the telephone operating company in Alberta. The merger created the second largest telephone company in Canada after Bell. Initially registered as BCT.Telus, the merged company with headquarters in Burnaby, British Columbia, soon rebranded as Telus.

<doc id="855908" wikidata="Q7411990" url="?curid=855908" title="Samuel Leech">
<text>Samuel Leech (c. 1798–1848) was a young sailor in the Royal Navy and the United States Navy during the War of 1812. He became notable as one of very few who wrote an account of his experiences, titled, in the manner of the time, &quot;Thirty Years from Home, or a Voice from the Main Deck; Being the Experience of Samuel Leech, Who Was Six Years in the British and American Navies: Was Captured in the British Frigate &quot;Macedonian&quot;: Afterwards Entered the American Navy, and Was Taken in the United States Brig &quot;Syren&quot;, by the British Ship &quot;Medway.

Leech&#x27;s nautical career began in 1810, at the age of twelve, when Lord William FitzRoy agreed to take Samuel into his frigate , as a favour to FitzRoy&#x27;s sister Frances, the wife of Francis Spencer, 1st Baron Churchill, Leech being the son of one of her servants.

He was a during &quot;Macedonian&#x27;s&quot; duel with the in 1812, and would later vividly describe the carnage on board the British ship before she struck her colours. As a prisoner of war, he was due to be exchanged at some point, but when the captured &quot;Macedonian&quot; was brought into Newport, Rhode Island, Leech jumped ship.

After failing to gain steady work on land, he returned to the sea, this time signing on to the US Navy, where he compared his treatment favourably to that in the Royal Navy. Leech was serving on the when she was captured by in 1814. His imprisonment seems not to have been too uncomfortable, and did not last long in any case, since the war ended the following year. He was in subsequently.

Around 1816 he went ashore, where he worked at various jobs and joined the Methodist Church. He eventually accumulated enough money to go into business for himself, and became a merchant living in Wilbraham, Massachusetts with a wife and three children.

Many years later he revisited , now a US ship, when it was in port in New York (probably 1840), and reminisced with the sailors there. Perhaps this encounter inspired his book, which was published by Tappen &amp; Dennet in 1843.

<text>The Matsumoto sarin attack was an attempted assassination perpetrated by members of the Aum Shinrikyo doomsday cult in Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture, Japan on the night of June 27, 1994. Eight people were killed and more than 500 were harmed by sarin aerosol that was released from a converted refrigerator truck in the Kaichi Heights area. The attack was perpetrated nine months before the better-known Tokyo subway sarin attack.

== Sarin attack ==
The sarin attack occurred in a quiet residential area in the city of Matsumoto, Nagano Prefecture. In carrying out the attack, Aum Shinrikyo had two goals; to attack three judges who were expected to rule against the cult in a lawsuit concerning a real estate dispute, and to test the efficacy of its sarin—which the cult was manufacturing at one of its facilities—as a weapon of mass murder. Residents of Matsumoto had also angered Aum founder Shoko Asahara by vigorously opposing his plan to set up an office and factory in the city&#x27;s southern area. Opponents of the plan gathered 140,000 signatures on an anti-Aum petition, equivalent to 70 percent of Matsumoto&#x27;s population at the time.

Aum&#x27;s original plan to release the aerosol into the Matsumoto courthouse was altered when the cult members arrived in the city after the courthouse had closed. They decided to instead target a three-story apartment building where the city&#x27;s judges resided. At 10:40 pm, members of Aum used a converted refrigerator truck to release a cloud of sarin which floated near the home of the judges. The truck&#x27;s cargo space held &quot;a heating contraption that had been specifically designed to turn&quot; twelve litres of liquid sarin into an aerosol, and fans to diffuse the aerosol into the neighbourhood.

At 11:30 pm, Matsumoto police received an urgent report from paramedics that casualties were being transported to hospital. The patients were suffering from darkened vision, eye pain, headaches, nausea, diarrhea, miosis (constricted pupils), and numbness in their hands. Some victims described having seen a fog with a pungent and irritating smell floating by. A total of 274 people were treated. Five dead residents were discovered in their apartments, and two died in hospital immediately after admission. An eighth victim, Sumiko Kono, remained in a coma for fourteen years and died in 2008.

The day after the attack, dead fish were found in a pond near the scene. The bodies of dogs, birds, and a large number of caterpillars were found in the area. Grass and trees had withered and the trees&#x27; leaves had discoloured. Nearly all of the casualties had been discovered within a radius of 150 metres from the centre, near the pond. People near open windows or in air-conditioned rooms had been exposed to the aerosol. Forensic investigation using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry revealed that the poison was the nerve agent sarin.

The fatalities included Yutaka Kobayashi, a 23-year-old salaryman, and Mii Yasumoto, a 29-year-old medical school student.

== Investigation ==
Police received an anonymous tip implicating Aum after the attacks, but the sect was not officially implicated in the incident until after the later Tokyo subway sarin attack in 1995. One section of the tip read, &quot;Matsumoto was definitely an experiment of sorts. The result of this experiment in an open space: seven dead, over 200 injured. If sarin is released in an enclosed space, say, a crowded subway it is easy to imagine a massive catastrophe.&quot;

After the incident, police focused their investigation on Yoshiyuki Kōno, whose wife was a victim put in a coma by the aerosol. It was discovered that Kōno had stored a large amount of pesticide in his residence. Although it was later proven that sarin cannot be manufactured from pesticides, Keiichi Tsuneishi, a Japanese historian, claimed the nerve agent is synthesizable from organophosphorus pesticides, and Kōno was dubbed by some in the media &quot;the Poison Gas Man&quot;. He subsequently received hate mail, death threats, and intense legal pressure. After the truth became known, every major Japanese newspaper apologized to Kōno, including those that had not named him as a suspect.

After the Tokyo attack, the blame was shifted to the cult Aum. Matsumoto&#x27;s police chief, on behalf of the police department and media, publicly apologized to Kōno. Kōno&#x27;s wife later awoke from her coma, but recovered neither speech nor body movement; she died in 2008.

Several Aum members were found guilty of masterminding both incidents. Thirteen Aum members, including cult leader Shoko Asahara, were sentenced to death, and were executed in 2018. Combined, the attacks resulted in 21 deaths and thousands of hospitalizations and outpatient treatments.

<text>Atlantica (; &quot;Atlantika&quot;) is an ancient continent that formed during the Proterozoic about (two billion years ago, Ga) from various 2 Ga cratons located in what are now West Africa and eastern South America.
The name, introduced by John Rogers in 1996, was chosen because the parts of the ancient continent are now located on opposite sides of the South Atlantic Ocean.

== Formation ==
Atlantica formed simultaneously with Nena at about 1.9 Ga from Archaean cratons, including Amazonia in present-day South America, and the Congo, West Africa and North Africa Cratons in Africa.

== Breakup ==

Atlantica separated from Nena between 1.6–1.4 Ga when Columbia — a supercontinent composed of Ur, Nena, and Atlantica — fragmented.
Atlantica and continents Nena and Ur and some minor plates formed the supercontinent Rodinia about 1 Ga ago. Between 1–0.5 Ga Rodinia split into three new continents: Laurasia and East and West Gondwana; Atlantica became the nucleus of West Gondwana.
During this later stage, the Neoproterozoic era, a Brasiliano-Pan African orogenic system developed. The central part of this system, the Araçuaí-West Congo orogen, has left a distinct pattern of deformations, still present on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean.

<doc id="855945" wikidata="Q1038976" url="?curid=855945" title="Carl Hovland">
<text>Carl Iver Hovland (June 12, 1912 – April 16, 1961) was a psychologist working primarily at Yale University and for the US Army during World War II who studied attitude change and persuasion. He first reported the sleeper effect after studying the effects of the Frank Capra propaganda film &quot;Why We Fight&quot; on soldiers in the Army. In later studies on this subject, Hovland collaborated with Irving Janis who would later become famous for his theory of groupthink. Hovland also developed social judgment theory of attitude change. Carl Hovland thought that the ability of someone to resist persuasion by a certain group depended on your degree of belonging to the group.

==Biography==
Hovland was born in Chicago on June 12, 1912. He originally intended to pursue a career in music until college, when he discovered psychology. Before this discovery, during his high school years at Luther Institute in Chicago, he would meet a fellow piano student, Gertrude Raddatz. He would later come to marry her in 1938.

During Hovland’s initial purist of music, he would come to neglect his other classes that did not interest him as much, such as sports. Instead, an interest was toward music and science bloomed as Hovland became an excellent pianist. His love for the two merged with his promotion of his interests through a small shop he developed. 

Carl Hovland was recruited by Samuel Stouffer, a sociologist on leave from the University of Chicago, to contribute to their collaborative research efforts. Hovland had the responsibility of leading a team of fifteen researchers.

Hovland was involved in a study of the conditions under which people are most likely to change their attitudes in response to persuasive messages. The Yale Group&#x27;s work was first described in Hovland&#x27;s book &quot;Communication and Persuasion&quot;, published in 1953.

With his life’s end approaching due to his cancer, his major interests in his last few years of life shifted from his verbal concept research to concept-formation. He would approach this idea with computer simulations [SG3] of human thought process

In his lifetime, Hovland was a member of the American Philosophical Society, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the National Academy of Sciences.

==Contributions==
Psychological research was Hovland&#x27;s intellectual joy. Especially in his early career, his investigations covered many topics. His papers in psychological journals included a study of test reliability, a major review of the literature on apparent movement, as well as his four classical papers on conditioned generalization from his doctoral dissertation.

Hovland began to emphasize micro-level analysis of propaganda and its effects. Hovland&#x27;s army experiments were the beginnings of that micro-level analysis of an individual. Hovland&#x27;s &quot;core conceptual variable was attitude&quot;.

Hovland believed that if he was able to recognize the attitude an individual has towards a trigger, he would be able to predict the behavior and actions of an individual over time. However, there were many studies that argued the contrary and showed that &quot;an attitude toward a person or object does not predict or explain an individual&#x27;s overt behavior regarding that person or object&quot;. This revelation of low correlation did not necessarily render findings useless but instead led to further research on how under certain circumstances it was possible to change a person&#x27;s behavior via their attitudes.

While Hovland focused on an individual rather than a group level, he began to take into consideration interpersonal communication in the form of persuasion. Specifically, Hovland was responsible for carrying out a series of studies that contributed to the &quot;cumulative understanding of persuasion behavior that has never since been matched or even rivaled&quot;.

To test and apply his theorization Hovland worked proposed the SMCR model. The SMCR model consists of four components—source variables, message variables, channel variables, and receiver variables. By manipulating each of these variables, Hovland was able to advance his &quot;message-learning approach to attitude change&quot;. There were problems with his particular approach, however, in that by focusing on a single dimension of the SMCR model, Hovland was unable to do more than isolate a factor rather than study the synergy between the different variables.

==Death==
Hovland died on April 16, 1961. When Hovland learned that he had cancer, he continued to work with his Yale doctoral students and conduct persuasion experiments. Finally, when he could work no more, he left his office in the Psychology Department, went to his home in New Haven, drew a bathtub full of water, and drowned himself.

<doc id="855950" wikidata="Q849921" url="?curid=855950" title="Sleeper effect">
<text>The sleeper effect is a psychological phenomenon that relates to persuasion. It is a delayed increase in the effect of a message that is accompanied by a discounting cue, typically being some negative connotation or lack of credibility in the message, while a positive message may evoke an immediate positive response which decays over time. The sleeper effect also refers to a delayed positive response that is maintained over time. The effect was first noticed among US Army soldiers exposed to army propaganda. It was hypothesized that over time the soldiers forgot that the message was propaganda. The effect has been widely studied but notoriously difficult to reproduce, leading to some doubt over its existence. 

==The sleeper effect==
When people are exposed normally to a persuasive message (such as an engaging or persuasive television advertisement), their attitudes toward the advocacy of the message display a significant increase.

Over time, however, their newly formed attitudes seem to gravitate back toward the opinion held prior to receiving the message, almost as if they were never exposed to the communication. This pattern of normal decay in attitudes has been documented as the most frequently observed longitudinal pattern of persuasion research (Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993).

In contrast, some messages are often accompanied with a discounting cue (e.g., a message disclaimer, a low-credibility source) that would arouse a recipient’s suspicion of the validity of the message and suppress any attitude change that might occur by exposure to the message alone. Furthermore, when people are exposed to a persuasive message followed by a discounting cue, people tend to be more persuaded over time; this is referred to as the sleeper effect (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951; Cook &amp; Flay, 1978).

For example, in political campaigns during important elections, undecided voters often see negative advertisements about a party or candidate for office. At the end of the advertisement, they also might notice that the opposing candidate paid for the advertisement. Presumably, this would make voters question the truthfulness of the advertisement, and consequently, they may not be persuaded initially. However, even though the source of the advertisement lacked credibility, voters will be more likely to be persuaded later (and ultimately, vote against the candidate disfavored by the advertisement).

This pattern of attitude change has puzzled social psychologists for nearly half a century, primarily due to its counter-intuitive nature and for its potential to aid in understanding attitude processes (Eagly &amp; Chaiken, 1993). It has been a very widely studied phenomenon of persuasion research (Kumkale &amp; Albarracín, 2004; see also Cook &amp; Flay, 1978).
Despite a long history, the sleeper effect has been notoriously difficult to obtain 
or to replicate, with the exception of a pair of studies by Gruder et al. (1978).

== Controversy about the existence of a &quot;sleeper effect&quot; ==
One of the more challenging aspects that the sleeper effect posed to some researchers in early studies was the sheer difficulty of obtaining the effect.

The sleeper effect is controversial because the influence of persuasive communication is greater when one measures the effect closer to the presentation instead of farther from the time of the reception.

After attempting to replicate the effect and failing, some researchers suggested that it might be better to accept the null hypothesis and conclude that the sleeper effect does not exist.

The sleeper effect is involved with initial message impression so the phenomenon has implications for models of persuasion, including teaching methods, as well as more recent conceptualizations, such as the heuristic-systematic model and the elaboration likelihood model.

However, Cook and his associates responded by suggesting that previous studies failed to obtain the sleeper effect because the requirements for a strong test were not met. Specifically, they argued that the sleeper effect will occur only if:
:(a) the message is persuasive;
:(b) the discounting cue has a strong enough effect to suppress initial attitude change;
:(c) enough time has elapsed between immediate and delayed post-tests; and
:(d) the message itself still has an effect on attitudes during the delayed post-test.

Experimental studies conducted did, in fact, provide evidence for the sleeper effect occurring under such theoretically relevant conditions. Furthermore, the sleeper effect did not occur when any of the four requirements were not met.

According to the dissociation interpretation, a sleeper effect appears to happen when a convincing message is conferred with a discounting cue (such as a low-credible source or counterargument). A sleeper effect occurs because of an impulsive dissociation of a message and a discounting cue over time (contrasting to a simple forgetting of a source).

==First identified==
The sleeper effect was first identified in US Army soldiers during World War II, after attempts to change their opinions and morals. Carl Hovland et al. measured the soldier’s opinions five days or nine weeks after they were shown a movie presentation of army propaganda. It was found that the difference in opinions of those who had observed the army propaganda movie and those who did not watch the movie were greater nine weeks after viewing it than five days. The difference in delayed persuasion is (which Hovland et al. termed) the sleeper effect, where there was a significant increase of persuasion in the experimental group.

The first efforts to justify the effect were consistent with the understanding of persuasion processes at that time. Hovland and his colleagues introduced a program of research to study how recall of the message and the source persuaded the sleeper effect. They first hypothesized that message receivers forget the noncredible communicator as time goes by, and therefore the initial message rejection diminishes. Nevertheless, they later propositioned that message receivers may not entirely forget the cue, yet the association between the representations of the discounting cue and the message content may fade over time and produce a sleeper effect. These two formulations vary in that (a) forgetting suggests that the traces of the cue disappear or become unavailable in memory over time, while (b) dissociation suggests that cue remains available in memory but is simply less easily retrieved (less accessible) in relation to the topic of communication.

==Hypotheses on how the sleeper effect occurs==
Because the sleeper effect has been considered to be counter-intuitive, researchers since the early 1950s have attempted to explain how and why it occurs.
===Forgetting and dissociation===
According to the forgetting hypothesis, a discounting cue associated with a message initially decreases acceptance of the message. As time goes by, one may observe a delayed increase of persuasion if the recipient forgets the cue but recalls the merits of the message (Hovland et al., 1949). To test this hypothesis, Hovland and his colleagues (Hovland &amp; Weiss, 1951; Kelman &amp; Hovland, 1953; Weiss, 1953) initiated a series of experiments in which participants received messages attributed to either trustworthy or untrustworthy sources and then completed measures of opinions as well as of recall of the message content and the source. Overall, messages with credible sources produced greater initial persuasion than messages delivered by non credible sources.

Hovland, Lumsdaine, and Sheffield (1949) first discovered the effect by a well-known study that demonstrated the delayed impact of a World War II propaganda movie on American soldiers.

With a subset of conditions that caused participants to question the credibility of the source in the movie, participants later reported a slight increase of persuasion (much to the researchers’ surprise). After examining the results, they initially hypothesized that forgetting of the discounting cue (in this case, the non-credible source) was causing the effect. Over time, however, the effect of the messages presented by credible sources decayed, whereas the effect of the messages presented by non-credible sources either remained the same or increased slightly. Despite evidence for the sleeper effect from this series of studies, the recall measures indicated that recipients could still remember the non-credible sources of the messages at the time of the delayed follow-up.

This is when the forgetting hypothesis was replaced by the dissociation hypothesis. Now according to the dissociation hypothesis the sleeper effect does not need to imply that the discounting cue becomes permanently unavailable in memory. A weakened association between the cue and the message may be sufficient for the sleeper effect to occur. As the association weakens over time, rendering the cue less accessible in relation to the communication topic, there may be a delayed increase in persuasion as long as the message arguments are still memorable. To this extent, factors that facilitate retention of the message content should create settings conducive to the sleeper effect.

According to this reasoning, the sleeper effect occurs because the association between the discounting cue and the message in one’s memory becomes weakened over time; hence, when the message is recalled for purposes of producing an attitude, the source is not readily associated.

===Differential decay===

Something that Hovland and his team ignored that is important is why over time, the discounting cue becomes less accessible than the message even when both pieces are similarly effective at the onset. To answer this question Greenwald, Pratkanis, and their team (Greenwald et al., 1986; Pratkanis et al., 1988) implemented a study to identify the conditions by which the sleeper effect does and does not occur.
Pratkanis directed a series of seventeen experiments in which he presented the discounting cue either before or after the message and found that the sleeper effect occurred mostly when the cue followed the message but not when the cue was first. 
In order to explain his findings, Pratkanis and his team proposed a modified forgetting hypothesis, which suggested that the sleeper effect occurs because the effect of the message and the cues decay at different rates. Based on this suggestion the message and the cue act like two communications operating in opposite directions. The sleeper effect emerges when the effect of these communications is about equal, promptly following message exposure, but the effect of the cue later decays more rapidly than that of the message. However, the timing of the discounting cue is essential to produce the effect because information presented first lasts longer, whereas more recent information dissipates more rapidly (Miller &amp; Campbell, 1959). Thus, the sleeper effect should occur when the discounting cue occurs at the end of a persuasive communication and stimulates a primacy effect of the message content.
Years later, Pratkanis, Greenwald, Leippe, and Baumgardner (1988) offered an alternative hypothesis that differed from Hovland and his colleagues.

They argued that the conditions under which the sleeper effect is more likely to occur were not emphasized by the dissociation hypothesis. Additionally, the requirements for a sleeper effect specified by Gruder et al. (1978) did not detail the empirical conditions necessary to observe the sleeper effect.

<doc id="855958" wikidata="Q1135110" url="?curid=855958" title="Doki Doki School Hours">
<text>is a Japanese four-panel manga series by Tamami Momose. The manga was serialized in &quot;Manga Life&quot; and published by Takeshobo from 1997 to 2013.

An anime television series adaptation was animated by J.C.Staff and aired on TV Tokyo from April 4, 2004 to June 27, 2004. An OVA series, titled &quot;Sensei no Ojikan Gold&quot; (せんせいのお時間 ご～るど), was also animated by J.C.Staff and continued from where the TV series left off. These episodes were released onto the DVDs of the TV series, one episode for each DVD. Both the TV series and OVA were dubbed into English by Ocean Productions using their Blue Water Studios and have been licensed for release in North America by Geneon Entertainment. However, the OVA was folded onto the TV series and released together as simply Doki Doki School Hours. Thus, for the release in that region, the 14th episode is actually the first episode of the OVA and so on.

The series is centered on 27-year-old homeroom teacher Mika Suzuki (who only looks about half her age) and the eccentric and colorful students of her class. The anime, coming two years after J.C.Staff had success with &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;, inherits a lot stylistically from that series, however the original manga predates &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot; by two years. Additionally, before the recent anime incarnation, the manga spawned a series of drama CDs.

==Plot==
A very short 27-year-old teacher has an interesting time trying to teach her class. She has to deal with the eccentricities of her students as they present themselves over the school year. When you have an insane class (which includes a cross-dressing narcissist, an otaku, a dumb jock, a boy-band obsessed girl, a lesbian in love with the teacher, a homosexual in love with the jock, a guy who looks like a middle-aged man, a girl obsessed with material items and the vain rich girl), what&#x27;s a person to do but hope?

==Characters==
;, also known as Mika-sensei
:The 27-year old homeroom teacher of Class 2A who is unusually short. She is usually addressed, as given the nickname &quot;Mika-sensei&quot;. Her short stature and generally &quot;cute&quot; appearance causes people to think her more childish than she is. Even so, she is not especially mature, still lives with her parents and dreads &quot;measuring day&quot;. Mika also has a tendency to cry when things do not go her way.
:
:A brutally honest student who belongs to the cooking club. She is often shown moaning about being surrounded by idiots in her class, or telling people off. She loves slasher films.
:
:A girl who likes to sleep in class but outside of school she holds a part-time job as she loves to make money. She has also shown great concern about her appearance and weight, causing her to put herself on crash diets. She&#x27;s very ditzy sometimes, like when she walked into the classroom and Anthony (an American exchange student) said &quot;Hello!&quot; in English: she came to the instant conclusion she had woken up in America.

;, also known as &quot;Chairman (Iincho)&quot; 
:The Class President of Class 2A. She wanted to be class president due to her favorite pop star stating that he liked class presidents: she decided to be class president for the rest of her life. She is highly intelligent and friendly, but is seem at times being brutal to people, especially when they somehow insult her idol.
:
:A tall and very pretty girl who constantly teases Mika-sensei, as she finds her various moods cute. She is a lesbian and has stated on several occasion that she loves small girls, thus making it no surprise that she has a huge (and slightly sadistic) crush on Mika-sensei. She is constantly flirting with her, which often borders on molestation. She has an excellent body, which Kobayashi is jealous of, though she is fairly modest about it. She also does well academically, though she isn&#x27;t above failing a test on purpose if it means she&#x27;ll get to spend time with Mika-sensei.
:
:The athlete. Suetake knows nothing other than sports-related information. He is rather dumb and fails most things that don&#x27;t involve sports, but he is also kind and good-natured. Kudo, who likes him, will often tutor him.
:
:A male honor student who is gay and in love with Suetake. He has poor self-control and is known as &quot;the nosebleed king&quot;. Though Suetake is completely oblivious to Kudo&#x27;s affections, everyone else is aware of them, and they are constantly rolling their eyes over his actions (which is very similar to how they react to Kitagawa&#x27;s love for Mika, the only difference being that Mika is aware of Kitagawa&#x27;s feelings, but can do little to stop her advances). He is seen having fantasies about Suetake, and not much else. A running gag is he will constantally have nose bleeds (in Japan, it is a sign of sexual arousal, especially in young men) brought on by Suetake&#x27;s innocent comments and actions to the point of passing out and requiring medical attention.
:
:A student who used to love beautiful girls and turned into a narcissist, to the point that he usually goes to school in makeup. He goes on and on about how lovely a girl can be, if she uses the right products. Outside school, he has been seen in skirts and even a full ladies&#x27; kimono. Despite the two of them often stating that they dislike each other, he seems to have a good relationship with Kobayashi.
:
:The head (and, originally, sole member) of the school&#x27;s manga club. He has great artistic ability, but he&#x27;s only ever seen drawing stereotypical bishōjo-type characters, and his obsession tends to get a little on the creepy side. He dislikes drawing men, and it&#x27;s somewhat implied that he&#x27;s not very good at doing so. Mika-sensei has occasionally shown interest in his work. Mika has often been the subject of his work, which has seems to have earned him a somewhat friendship with Kitakawa for his art of her.

;, also known as &quot;Old Man (Oyaji)&quot;
:The 17-year-old student carries himself in a stereotypically &quot;40-year-old&quot; manner, and therefore is nicknamed &quot;Old Man&quot;. Later in the series, it is hinted he has a crush on Iincho, and is occasionally mistaken for a pervert.

;, also known as Matsumoto-sensei
:Okitsu High School&#x27;s Doctor and Mika&#x27;s best friend on the faculty.
:
:A member of Takumi Watanabe&#x27;s manga club who, ironically, is terrible at drawing manga. She idolises and has a large crush on Takumi. He seems to know, but manages to throw her off.
:
:A transfer student who is studying abroad from America. He is fluent in Japanese because he is an otaku.

==Reception==
Tim Jones of THEM Anime Reviews said the series is &quot;quite an interesting series upon first glance&quot;, with three of the main characters coming out of nowhere,doing a bad job of introducing characters unlike a series like &quot;Azumanga Daioh&quot;, meaning that they embody stereotypes. He also criticizes Mika being the &quot;target of sexual advances of one of her students&quot;, a student named Kitakawa who is &quot;a lesbian lolicon lover&quot;, a character he called one of the most shallow, and annoying character he had ever &quot;seen in the history of animation&quot;. He also noted that there is a gay man who only thinks of his male crush, &quot;sometimes to the point of getting nosebleeds&quot; and said his love interest had one of the most annoying voices, and added that the series has problems when &quot;a guy who draws half-naked anime girls is one of the best characters&quot;. He further called the animation &quot;horrible&quot; and doesn&#x27;t understand how it ran for 20 episodes.

Carlos Santos of Anime News Network said that the anime is &quot;a cute diversion that will leave you mildly happy rather than annoyed or offended&quot; and said the series has &quot;shadows of hilarity&quot;. He also said that the series is &quot;lighthearted&quot;, and called the series &quot;far from perfect&quot;. He concluded that there are &quot;some genuinely cute and funny moments but said that it has the &quot;same jokes, same structure&quot; which gets boring.

<text>Colonel Colin Mackenzie (1754–8 May 1821) was a Scottish army officer in the British East India Company who later became the first Surveyor General of India. He was a collector of antiquities and an orientalist and an indologist. He surveyed southern India, making use of local interpreters and scholars to study religion, oral histories, inscriptions and other evidence, initially out of personal interest, and later as a surveyor. He was ordered to survey the Mysore region shortly after the British victory over Tipu Sultan in 1799 and produced the first maps of the region along with illustrations of the landscape and notes on archaeological landmarks. His collections consisting of thousands of manuscripts, inscriptions, translations, coins and paintings, which were acquired after his death by the India Office Library and are an important source for the study of Indian history. He was awarded a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 4 June 1815.

==Early life==
Colonel Colin Mackenzie was born in Stornoway on Lewis, Outer Hebrides, Scotland, the second son of merchant Murdoch Mackenzie (who was the first postmaster of the town) and Barbara around 1753 or 1754. Little is known of his early life but he is thought to have started his work as a Comptroller of the Customs at Stornoway from 1778 to 1783, possibly through the influence of his father&#x27;s association with the Mackenzie Earls of Seaforth. In his youth he had an interest in mathematics possibly fostered by his schoolmaster, a freemason, Alexander Anderson. Lord Kenneth Mackenzie (last Earl of Seaforth) and Francis (fifth Lord Napier) sought his help in preparing a biography of John Napier and his work on logarithms. When Lord Napier died in 1773, Kenneth Mackenzie helped Colin to obtain commission with the British East India Company to join the Madras Army. When he arrived in Madras on 2 September 1783 he was thirty and was never to return home again. He joined as a Cadet in the Infantry division but was transferred in 1786 as a Cadet of Engineers.

==India==
Arriving in India he first met the daughter of Lord Francis Napier, Hester (d. 1819). Hester was married to Samuel Johnston who worked as a civil servant at Madurai (their son Alexander Johnston later became a judge in Sri Lanka, founded the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland and wrote a memoir on the life of Colin Mackenzie). Hester introduced Mackenzie to some Brahmins to obtain information on Hindu mathematical traditions as part of the biographical memoir on John Napier and the history of logarithms. The biography project appears to have been subsequently dropped but Colin continued to take an interest in antiquities.

For the first thirteen years in India, he was busy with military duties. He began in Coimbatore and Dindigul around 1783 followed by engineering duties in Madras, Nellore and Guntur and during the campaign against Mysore from 1790 to 1792. In 1793 he saw action in the Siege of Pondicherry. He was posted as a commanding engineer to Ceylon and returned in 1796. He rose in rank starting from a second lieutenant on 16 May 1783, first lieutenant on 6 March 1789; and captain 16 August 1793. Major by 1 Jan 1806 rising on to become a colonel on 12 August 1819. It was after his return from Ceylon that he was able to follow his interest in antiquities.

===Mysore survey===

In 1799, Mackenzie was part of the British force in the Battle of Seringapatam, where Tipu Sultan, Maharaja of Mysore was defeated. After the defeat of Tipu, he led the Mysore survey between 1799 and 1810 and one of the aims was to establish the boundaries of the state as well as the territories ceded by the Nizam. The survey consisted of interpreters, a team of draftsmen and illustrators who collected material on the natural history, geography, architecture, history, customs, and folk tales of the region.

When he began the survey, he was concerned that he had no linguistic skills and was more appalled by the lack of British competence in south Indian languages. Around the same time, the trigonometric survey was proposed by William Lambton but there was little collaboration between the two during the Mysore survey. Mackenzie was told that his survey was not to be &quot;mere military or geographical information, but that your enquiries are to be extended to a statistical account of the whole country.&quot; However he was not provided enough resources for this grand plan. He wrote to Barry Close that he would not &quot;descend to the minutiae&quot; of measuring cultivated and uncultivated land but would instead focus on that which was of political and military importance. He pointed out that enquiries into revenues created uneasiness. One of his chief interpreters was a man named Kavelli Venkata Boria (IAST kāvelī veṃkeṭā boraiyāḥ, there are variations in spelling) who Mackenzie first met in 1796, shortly after his return from Ceylon. He found Boria capable of dealing with all sects and considered him as &quot;the first step of my introduction into the portal of Indian knowledge.&quot; Boria knew Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Sankskrit. In 1797, Mackenzie visited Mudgeri and found the ruins of a Jain temple. He wrote an extensive note on the Jains based on interviews through his translator &quot;Cavelly Boria&quot;. Boria died in 1803 and Mackenzie took in his brother Venkata Lechmiah (IAST lakṣmaiyyā, also spelt Lakshmaiah or Lakshmayya). Another of Mackenzie&#x27;s assistant was Dhurmiah (IAST dharmayāḥ), a Jain pandit (scholar) from Maleyur, then in Mysore State. Dhurmiah, with his ability to read &quot;Hale Kannada&quot; (old Kannada) inscriptions contributed greatly to the study of the inscriptions in the region. Dhurmiah provided Mackenzie with Jain insights into the history of India but some ideas were considered too unreliable such as the idea that the Jains had fled from Mecca. Dhurmiah&#x27;s son may also have been on Mackenzie&#x27;s staff. Another orientalist, Mark Wilks interviewed Dhurmiah and wrote on the Jains in his 1817 &quot;Historical Sketches of the South of India&quot;.

Stating the aims of his survey, he wrote from the perspective of a historian in a letter to Major Merwick Shawe in 1805:
===Amaravati===

Among Mackenzie&#x27;s vast collection of illustrations is a set of 85 sketches made at Amaravati. He appears to have first visited the site in 1798 and conducted more systematic studies between 1816 and 1820 after he became a Surveyor General and three copies of these documents were made. One was deposited at the Library of the Asiatic Society, Calcutta, another at Madras and one in the British Library at London. Only the London copy survives. Sketches of the site were made by John Newman, draftsman for Mackenzie from 1810 to 1818. About 132 stones were found by Mackenzie but these are no longer traceable. Mackenzie believed that the site was related to the Jain religion and had no idea of Buddhism in India. The stones from Amaravati were brought to Masulipatam but many were not taken to ship but deposited into a mound that came to be known as &quot;Robertson&#x27;s Mound&quot; after Francis W. Robertson who was Assistant Collector at Masulipatnam from 1814 to 1817. Most of these were subsequently moved to the Madras Museum along with Sir Walter Elliot&#x27;s collections from Amaravati. About 79 stones depicted in the Mackenzie drawings are unaccounted for and are not traceable to collections in museums.

==Java==

Mackenzie spent two years (1811-1812/13) in Java, during the period of British occupation during the Napoleonic Wars. On 18 November 1812, while in Java, he married Petronella Jacomina Bartels at a local Lutheran Church. Petronella was born in Ceylon and was of Dutch ancestry. In 1814, Stamford Raffles having heard of Mackenzie&#x27;s work in India, wanted him to survey Java and report on its monuments. Since Mackenzie had then moved back to India, the team was led by H. C. Cornelius (who had accompanied Mackenzie earlier) who was also responsible for the work involved in removing the debris from the buried ruins of Borobodur. His report on the survey of Java included many watercolours illustrating life during that period. These were published in three volumes. The first was titled &quot;Antiquities &amp; Costume(s) of Java, 1812-13&quot; and includes drawings and sketches some of which were made use of by Raffles in his &quot;History of Java&quot;. The second volume bore the title &quot;A Collection of Monuments, Images, Sculptures &amp;c. illustrative of The Ancient History, Religion &amp; Institutions of the Island of Java and of the Adjacent Isles: Taken under the immediate Inspection &amp; Direction of Lieutenant Colonel Colin Mackenzie in the course of a Tour &amp; of different Excursions through the Island of Java in the years 1811-1812 &amp; 1813&quot; and included numerous sketches and a few watercolours. The third volume &quot;Views, Plans and Maps on the Island of Java&quot; carried some pencil drawn maps.

==Surveyor General of India==

In 1767, the East India Company under Lord Clive had appointed James Rennell as Surveyor General for Bengal. Colin Mackenzie was appointed Surveyor General of Madras Presidency in 1810 but these posts were abolished in 1815. After his returning to India, in June 1815, he was invested as a Companion of the Bath. He returned to continue surveys of eastern India from the Krishna to Cape Comorin. On 26 May 1815 he was appointed Surveyor General of India with his headquarters at Fort William in Calcutta but he was allowed to stay on in Madras to help reorganize the surveys. He stayed there till May 1817 during which period he worked on planning surveys and examining earlier surveys. He appointed Benjamin Swain Ward (1786–1835) to survey Travancore, Lieutenant Peter Eyre Conner (born 5 August 1789, died 29-April-1821 at Hyderabad) (Sometimes given only as Lt. Connor) for Coorg (then written as Codugu or Koorg), Francis Mountford (1790–1824) to Guntur and James Garling (1784–1820) to the Nizam&#x27;s territories. By 1816 Garling had used a triangulation system similar to that of Lambton to work out the position of the ruins of Bijapur and was moving northwards. While Garling&#x27;s work was appreciated by the surveyors of Bombay, he was rebuked by Mackenzie whose orders restricted him to the Nizam&#x27;s territory. The government in an attempt to hasten his move to Calcutta sent the yacht, &quot;HC Phoenix&quot; to transport him and his family from Madras on 24 June 1816. The captain, Criddle, was ordered to take him to survey the Pulicat and Armegon Shoals before taking him to Calcutta. Mackenzie however set about to his work and did not board the yacht. The government then wrote that he should use the survey ship &quot;Sophia&quot; which was to bring Sir John Malcolm to Madras in May 1817. He finally set sail to Calcutta on 17 July 1817 aboard &quot;Sophia&quot;. When Mackenzie moved from Madras to Calcutta, Lechmiah was retained.

==Death and after==

He died on 8 May 1821 at his home in Calcutta, India, and was buried in South Park Street Cemetery. His widow, Petronella, offered the collections to the Bengal Government at a tentative price of Rs 20,000. The law firm Palmer and co. did an assessment of the collections and arrived at a figure of Rs 100,000 as a &#x27;reasonable reimbursement&#x27; and the Bengal Government acquired the collections. In 1823 Petronella married Lt. Robert Page Fulcher at the Cape of Good Hope. Fulcher was a fellow traveller on the ship to England and her original plan was to move to Stornoway to live with Colin&#x27;s sister. Mackenzie&#x27;s Will left 5% to Lechmiah. Much of his collection of documents, manuscripts, artifacts, and artworks is now in the British Museum and the Oriental and India Office Collections of the British Library, though part of it remains in the Government Museum in Madras. Samuel and Hester Johnston&#x27;s son, Sir Alexander Johnston, wrote a memoir on the life of Colin Mackenzie.

After Mackenzie&#x27;s death, Lechmiah continued to help Horace Hayman Wilson in cataloguing the collections. He applied to the Madras division of the Asiatic Society to continue work on the collections made by his master. This was rejected on the grounds that no oriental could handle the managerial and critical work. James Prinsep declared that &quot;&quot;..The qualifications of Cavelly Venkata for such an office, judging of them by his &#x27;abstract,&#x27; or indeed of any native, could hardly be pronounced equal to such a task...&quot;.&quot; Lechmiah was the only Indian admitted to the Madras Literary Society which was founded in 1817 and in 1833, Lechmiah founded a parallel &quot;Madras Hindu Literary Society&quot; as a means of continuing his work. Sir Alexander Johnston supported this venture which also got the support of Captain Henry Harkness (author of a book on Indian scripts) and George Norton (a radical Advocate-General who was against government support for Christian missionaries support for but this organization did not survive long. A missionary in Madras, William Taylor was chosen for the job. Taylor has been described as a poor scholar (with a defective knowledge of the Devanagari script) if not a deranged antiquarian by Dirks (1993). Lechmiah received a monthly pension of 300 rupees and was given a grant of a &quot;Shotrium&quot; (or &quot;Shrotrium&quot;), land given as a reward for Civil officers. Three other brothers Ramaswamy (Ramasawmy), Narasimhalu (Naraseemoloo) and Sitayya (Seetiah) also worked for Mackenzie but the latter two were mainly as minor assistants. Ramaswamy later published extensively in English. His works included a book on the cities of the Deccan (&quot;Descriptive and Historical Sketches of Cities and Places in the Dekkan...&quot;), a biography of Deccan poets (1829), a cookbook translated in 1836 from a Telugu book written by Saraswati Bai (&quot;Pakasastra, otherwise Called Soopasastra, or the Modern Culinary Receipts of the Hindoos&quot;), a book on caste in 1837.

Studies of the maps made by Mackenzie&#x27;s survey are considered to have the potential to highlight interesting archaeological sites as well as provide information on the organization and structure of &quot;poligar&quot; chiefdoms which were dismantled after British takeover.

<text>Code Lyoko (; stylized as CODE: LYOKO in season 1 and in all caps in seasons 2–4) is a French anime-influenced animated series created by Thomas Romain and Tania Palumbo and produced by Antefilms Production (season 1) and MoonScoop (seasons 2–4) for Cartoon Network, France 3 and Canal J, with the participation of Conseil Général de la Charente, Pôle Image Magelis, Région Poitou-Charentes and Wallimage. The series centers around a group of teenagers who travel to the virtual world of Lyoko to battle against a malignant artificial intelligence known as X.A.N.A., who threatens Earth with powers to access the real world and cause trouble. The scenes in the real world employ traditional animation with hand-painted backgrounds, while the scenes in Lyoko are presented in 3D CGI animation. The series began its first 97-episode run on September 3, 2003, on France&#x27;s France 3, and ended on November 10, 2007 and on Cartoon Network in the United States on April 19, 2004 and ended in 2008 after it’s final seven episodes aired online at Cartoon Network video.

A follow-up series, &quot;Code Lyoko: Evolution&quot;, began airing at the end of 2012. This &quot;sequel&quot; to the series featured live-action sequences for scenes taking place in the real world instead of its traditional 2D animation from the original series but retained the iconic CGI for scenes taking place in Lyoko, now with an updated artstyle. The show only consisted one season of 26 episodes with the final episode airing in late 2013, leaving off on a cliffhanger with no second season or other sequel series planned due to MoonScoop’s filing for bankruptcy shortly after in 2014.
== Plot ==
Jeremy Belpois, an 8th grade prodigy attending boarding school at Kadic Academy, discovers a quantum supercomputer in an abandoned factory near his school. Upon activating it, he discovers a virtual world called Lyoko with an artificially intelligent girl named Aelita trapped inside it. He also finds out about X.A.N.A., a fully autonomous, malevolent, and highly intelligent multi-agent system, that also dwells within the Supercomputer. Using Towers on Lyoko to gain access to the real world, X.A.N.A. can possess electronics and other targets like a virus to wreak havoc. X.A.N.A. is determined to eliminate anyone aware of the Supercomputer&#x27;s existence so it can be free to conquer Earth and destroy all humanity.

Jeremy works tirelessly to materialize Aelita into the real world and stop attacks caused by X.A.N.A. and aided by his three friends, Odd Della Robbia, Ulrich Stern, and Yumi Ishiyama, who are virtualized into Lyoko to save both worlds from the evil virus. They achieve this by escorting Aelita to various Towers on Lyoko, which serve as interface terminals between Lyoko and Earth. Once the Tower is deactivated, Jeremy can launch the &quot;Return to the Past&quot; program, which sends the world back in time to undo any damage caused by X.A.N.A., while anyone scanned into the Supercomputer retains their memory of the events. In &quot;Code: Earth,&quot; Aelita is finally materialized, but the group discovers that X.A.N.A. had planted a virus inside of her that will kill her if the Supercomputer is turned off. They realize that they cannot destroy X.A.N.A., or Aelita will be destroyed along with it.

In Season 2, Aelita adjusts to life in the real world, while Jeremy attempts to develop an antivirus program to liberate her from X.A.N.A.&#x27;s power. On Lyoko, a fifth sector is discovered and the group explores more of Lyoko&#x27;s secrets and mysteries. The gang begins to uncover information about a mysterious man named Franz Hopper, who went missing ten years ago. He supposedly created the Supercomputer, Lyoko, and X.A.N.A., and is eventually discovered to be Aelita&#x27;s father. They finally find out that Franz Hopper is indeed alive somewhere, hiding in the uncharted parts of Lyoko to avoid X.A.N.A. All the while, X.A.N.A. attempts to steal Aelita&#x27;s memory to gain the Keys to Lyoko and escape to the internet. At the end of the season, the group discovers that Aelita is actually human and does not have a virus, and instead is missing a fragment of herself. In &quot;The Key,&quot; X.A.N.A. tricks them with a fake and succeeds in stealing Aelita&#x27;s memory and escaping the Supercomputer. Aelita appears to perish as a result but is revived when Franz Hopper restores her completely, along with her missing fragment: the memories of her life on Earth before she was virtualized on Lyoko.

Season 3 shows that since succeeding in escaping the confines of the Supercomputer, X.A.N.A. targets the virtual world itself by destroying each of Lyoko&#x27;s surface sectors, until only Sector Five is left. Initially reluctant, the Lyoko Warriors decide to invite William Dunbar as the sixth member. However, shortly after being virtualized, he is possessed by X.A.N.A. Shortly after, he destroys the Core of Lyoko, destroying the entire virtual world and rendering the group unable to fight X.A.N.A., putting the entire real world in danger. After what they thought was their defeat, Jeremy receives a coded message from Franz Hopper that allows him to recreate Lyoko and continue the fight against X.A.N.A.

In Season 4, Jeremy and Aelita construct a digital submarine, the Skidbladnir, to travel across the Digital Sea to destroy X.A.N.A.&#x27;s &quot;Replikas,&quot; which are copies of Lyoko&#x27;s sectors that are linked to X.A.N.A.-controlled supercomputers on Earth, all created for its goal of world domination. X.A.N.A. uses William as its general throughout the season to defend the Replikas and target the Lyoko Warriors in any way he can. To prevent suspicion regarding William&#x27;s disappearance, Jeremy manages to program a specter to take William&#x27;s place at Kadic, although the clone has low-level intelligence and acts very stupidly. Near the end of the season, X.A.N.A. decides to draw energy from all of its Replikas to create the Kolossus, a gigantic monster that later destroys the Skidbladnir. Before Kolossus destroys the submarine, Jeremy frees William from X.A.N.A.&#x27;s control. After his return, he has a difficult time gaining the trust of the group. While Ulrich defeats the Kolossus, Franz Hopper sacrifices himself to power Jeremy&#x27;s &quot;anti-X.A.N.A. program,&quot; which destroys X.A.N.A. forever upon activation. Shortly after, the group, albeit reluctant due to their nostalgia, decides to shut down the Supercomputer.

==Characters==
===Lyoko Warriors===

* Jeremy Belpois
:Voiced by: Raphaëlle Bruneau (French); Sharon Mann (English)
:A 12-year-old (later 13-year-old) top-of-the-class student who finds and starts the factory&#x27;s Supercomputer while looking for parts to build a robot. By turning on the Supercomputer, he reawakened Aelita, the virtual world of Lyoko, and the malevolent multi-agent system X.A.N.A. His goals are mainly driven by his desire to protect Aelita, whom he has a crush on, and to save her from the Supercomputer and X.A.N.A. by materializing her on Earth. As part of the group, he specializes in programming new ways to defeat X.A.N.A. and monitors the group while they are on Lyoko. Because he is not very athletic and is more computer savvy, Jeremy almost never goes to Lyoko, only going there twice and vowing to never go there afterwards. His workaholic attitude occasionally puts a strain on his relationships with the other four members of the group.

* Aelita Schaeffer
:Voiced by: Sophie Landresse (French); Sharon Mann (English)
:Mainly known by her alias Aelita Stones, she is the smartest of the group alongside Jeremy. At the beginning of the series, she was trapped within Lyoko, inside the Supercomputer. She was originally thought to be an AI until it was revealed that she&#x27;s the daughter of Franz Hopper, the creator of the world of Lyoko. As a little girl, she lost her mother. When a group of suited men came to her home, she and her father fled and virtualized themselves on Lyoko. Between the virtualization and Jeremy&#x27;s discovery of the Supercomputer, X.A.N.A. stole an important memory fragment that inhibited her from becoming fully human again. After this fragment is retrieved, she is no longer linked to the Supercomputer. After becoming human, she often has nightmares of her past life. She later enrolls as a boarder at Kadic under the alias Aelita Stones, claiming to be Odd&#x27;s cousin. She reciprocates Jeremy&#x27;s feelings for her, but he often strains their relationship by overlooking Aelita and her passions in favor of working on the Supercomputer.

:Aelita is the only one capable of deactivating towers on Lyoko to completely neutralize X.A.N.A.&#x27;s attacks. On Lyoko, she has an elf-like appearance, similar to that of &quot;Mr. Pück,&quot; a toy elf from her forgotten childhood. She has the ability to create or remove objects, such as rocks or bridges, from the virtual environment, called &quot;creativity&quot; by Jeremie. She had no weapons or offensive abilities until season 3 of the show when she developed the ability to create &quot;energy fields,&quot; pink balls of plasma that can be thrown or used to block enemy fire from a distance. In the fourth season, Jeremy programmed light pink-white angel wings as part of her new virtual attire, allowing her to fly and carry one other person; the star-shaped bracelet enabling her to activate them by waving her hand over it. 

* Odd Della Robbia
:Voiced by: Raphaëlle Bruneau (French); Christophe Caballero and Matthew Géczy (English)
:The comic relief of the group. Odd is credited as having great potential when it comes to school, but rarely uses it, and as a result of this, he gets bad grades due to his lack of studying. He shares a dorm with Ulrich and has a dog named Kiwi, who he hides in a dresser because pets are not allowed at Kadic Academy. He&#x27;s considered a ladies&#x27; man and has dated many of the girls at his school, but his romances tend to last only a few days. Before he attended Kadic, he lived with his parents and his five sisters. Odd&#x27;s blond hair has a purple spot in the middle and is worn up in a spike since being virtualized on Lyoko for the very first time. 

:On Lyoko, he is clothed like a cat, with a tail and clawed gloves that shoot &quot;laser arrows.&quot; In the first season, he had a precognitive ability he called &quot;&quot;, but it was deleted before the second season and has been replaced by his defensive ability to create a purple force-field by crossing his arms in front of his body, covering half of his body. Another one of Odd&#x27;s abilities is being able to use his claws to climb on walls just like a cat and even control monsters upon contact.

* Ulrich Stern
:Voiced by: Marie-Line Landerwijn (French); Barbara Weber-Scaff (English)
:A more reserved member of the group, Ulrich has a hard time sharing his feelings. His parents pressure him to achieve well in school, but he has difficulty learning and living up to their expectations. In his off-time, he practices Pencak silat with Yumi, whom he has a crush on. He suffers from vertigo, which makes it hard to participate in activities such as rock climbing. Due to his many activities, Ulrich has a rather muscular build, thus many girls (particularly Sissi) consider him to be extremely handsome.

:On Lyoko, he wears a yellow and brown outfit inspired by Japanese samurai. His main weapon is a katana, and can dual wield them. His &quot;Supersprint&quot; ability allows him to dash at high speed, and his &quot;Triplicate&quot; power lets him create two clones of himself. He can combine these abilities in a technique called &quot;Triangulate,&quot; using his clones to form a triangle around an enemy and ambush it from behind when it is distracted.

* Yumi Ishiyama
:Voiced by: Géraldine Frippiat (French); Mirabelle Kirkland (English)
:A fairly reserved student who lives near and attends Kadic. She is the oldest of the group. She is of Japanese descent and has one younger brother, Hiroki. Because of her parents and culture, she must maintain good grades and observe family values. At home, she generally has to deal with marital issues between her parents. She is a friend of William Dunbar, who transferred to Kadic during season 2. She practices pencak silat with Ulrich, whom she has a crush on, though it&#x27;s not as obvious as Ulrich&#x27;s crush on her. She always wear blackoutfits that bare her midriff All of her everyday clothes include this feature; it seems to be very much in fashion at Kadic and has enough basic knowledge of the Supercomputer to operate it in Jeremy and Aelita&#x27;s absence.

:On Lyoko, Yumi is dressed in a geisha-inspired outfit with an obi sash. Her main weapon is a Tessen fan, being given an additional one since the second season, and her one-and-only power is telekinesis, allowing her to move objects and levitate her three best friends with her mind alone; it is rarely used as it tires her out pretty quickly. During the fourth season, we see this ability being used five more times, now with more ease and control.

* William Dunbar
:Voiced by: Mathieu Moreau (French); David Gasman (English)
:An overconfident student who starts attending Kadic Academy after he was expelled from his previous school for vandalism. Yumi befriends him and he soon develops feelings for her. He often fights with Ulrich for Yumi&#x27;s attention and is sometimes disrespectful of Yumi&#x27;s boundaries, causing her to become frustrated with his unwanted advances. After proving helpful to the group during several X.A.N.A. attacks, they vote on whether he should be allowed to join the group, but Yumi votes no and his memory is erased. Eventually, however, the vote becomes unanimous when William&#x27;s membership is deemed necessary.
:On his first mission on Lyoko, William is captured and possessed by X.A.N.A., who ensnares William as its puppet. From that point on, a clone of William, created by Jeremy, is used to pose as the real William until Jeremy is able to free him. Jeremy&#x27;s program is imperfect, causing the William clone to act either unintelligent or unpredictable. Near the end of the series, the clone starts developing several human-like traits, which he eventually uses to help the warriors. Towards the end of the series, William is finally released from X.A.N.A.&#x27;s control.
:On Lyoko, William wears a white outfit and carries a giant sword, which can release shock waves. Under X.A.N.A.&#x27;s control, his outfit turns black and he gains a spiked gauntlet on his wrist, which can be used for defense. He has an array of powers including enhanced strength, &quot;Supersmoke,&quot; which allows him to transform into a cloud of black smoke and move around at great speed, eventually gaining the ability to fly as well, a second sight allowing him to see across great distances, and levitation. X.A.N.A. sends William to stop the Lyoko Warriors on the virtual world, and thanks to his natural abilities strengthened even further by the artificial intelligence, he proved to be a formidable opponent. He is finally released in &quot;Down to Earth.&quot;

===Villains===
* X.A.N.A.
:X.A.N.A. is an evil and powerful computer virus based on a multi-agent system. It is ruthless, bent on world domination, and serves as the central antagonist of the series. It was originally created by Franz Hopper to destroy Project Carthage: a military communications system that Hopper had previously been involved with. He mentions that his motives were to prevent the French government from obtaining access to Project Carthage. Due to Hopper&#x27;s repeated returns to the past, X.A.N.A. evolved until it achieved self-awareness, choosing to betray Hopper and trap him and his daughter Aelita inside Lyoko. Hopper had no choice but to shut down the Supercomputer to stop its rampage. After it was reawakened in the present day, X.A.N.A. continues to wreak havoc on Earth and displays no mercy towards those who stand in its way. It grows smarter and more powerful with every return in time and can think of greater plans and goals beyond random destruction.

:X.A.N.A. has no actual physical form as a program, instead, X.A.N.A. activates Lyoko structures called &quot;Towers&quot; to send extensions of its multi-agent system to the real world, while remaining inside the Supercomputer, which can only be stopped by deactivating the Towers. On Earth, X.A.N.A. can manipulate and channel electromagnetic phenomena and hack networks or manifest ghostly spectres from outlets at will to possess objects or living things like a virus to bend to its will (usually marked with its eye symbol as a sign of its control) to threaten humanity or target its enemies. After evolving further, X.A.N.A. learns to possess humans or manifest polymorphic spectres to follow its orders as pixelized vessels with its spectral or electrical abilities. On Lyoko, it virtualizes deadly monsters to fight enemies and attack targets, and can alter environments, plant bugs or viruses, manipulate vulnerable warriors, create prisons, program equipment and vehicles, etc.

:The only known physical incarnation of X.A.N.A. appeared in season 1, in the episode titled &quot;Ghost Channel,&quot; where after having its disguise as Jeremy being exposed, he transformed into a demonic caricature figure of Jeremy and tried to kill all of the Warriors. X.A.N.A.&#x27;s voice was provided by David Gasman in this episode.

:As X.A.N.A. continues to increase its power capabilities with the towers are practically unlimited such as Reality Warping, Sinkhole creation, Virus Possesion,Mind Control &amp; Virtual illusion. its ambition also develops throughout the series. It steals the Keys to Lyoko from Aelita to escape the Supercomputer and access the world network. Upon its escape, X.A.N.A. becomes more ruthless and aggressive, now trying to destroy Lyoko to make the team powerless against it (succeeded at the end of the third season but was recreated after) and possessing William to become its weapon. After that, X.A.N.A. also targets Franz Hopper, its biggest threat and the reason why the group keeps surviving. At the same time, the heroes discover X.A.N.A. has infected hundreds of other supercomputers in the network to build weapons and technology to conquer the world. Near the end of the series, the group manage to free William and although it succeeded in killing Franz Hopper in the final battle, the team &quot;successfully&quot; destroyed X.A.N.A. in his entirety in the network with Jeremy&#x27;s multi-agent program.

*Monsters
:X.A.N.A. virtualizes many types of monsters on Lyoko to fight enemies, guard Towers, and attack targets. The monsters generally appear to be organic/mechanical creatures based on various animals and insects. X.A.N.A.&#x27;s monster types include Kankrelats, Hornets, Bloks, Krabs, Megatanks, Tarantulas, Creepers, and Mantas. These monsters can be destroyed by hitting the Eye of X.A.N.A. on their bodies. In the Digital Sea, it uses monsters such as Kongers, Sharks, and the Kalamar. It also created the Scyphozoa, which it uses to steal memory or possess warriors. There is also its ultimate monster which appeared in the last three episodes, the Kolossus, a fiery giant with immense strength that is fueled by the combined power of its network Replikas of Lyoko sectors.
:In the video games, some monsters are exclusive to fight such as Cyberhoppers, Skarabs and Skorpion from &quot;Get Ready to Virtualize!&quot;, Insekts, Volkanoids, Mountain Bug, Insekt Lord, Ice Spider, Desert Driller and Magma Worm in &quot;Quest for Infinity&quot; and &quot;Fall of X.A.N.A.&quot;, other variants are called &quot;Dark Monsters&quot; which are equipped with different abilities when in combat.

===Recurring characters===
* Elisabeth &quot;Sissi&quot; Delmas
:Voiced by: Carole Baillien (French); Christine Flowers and Jodi Forrest (English)
:The principal&#x27;s daughter and a Kadic student. She is a mean, spoiled, conceited, but also beautiful and somewhat popular girl who has had a huge crush on Ulrich since before attending Kadic. Sissi and Odd quite often make fun of each other, with Odd making clever comebacks whenever Sissi says something rude or whenever they need her to go away. After Aelita is first materialized, she often does the same. Sissi tends to make fun of and openly insult Yumi in particular, mostly due to Ulrich liking Yumi more than her. Sissi is often followed by Herb and Nicolas, whom she often shows resentment towards, but uses them to her advantage anyway. She was initially part of the gang and knew about Lyoko, but was kicked out after breaking her oath to keep the Supercomputer a secret. Her memories of Lyoko were subsequently erased. She becomes friends with the Lyoko Warriors at the end of the series. Sissi also shows a dislike for her full name, Elisabeth, often making sounds of disgust when it&#x27;s mentioned and also She was wear any outfits bare her midriff in the series.

* Herb Pichon
:Voiced by: Bruno Mullenaerts (French); David Gasman (English)
:An eighth-grader at Kadic and a classmate of the Lyoko Warriors. He is the second-in-command of Sissi&#x27;s gang, and sometimes even the boss in times of emergency when Sissi proves to be incompetent, as he is the most intelligent member of their group. Herb is also shown to be in love with Sissi, although he doesn&#x27;t tell her because of her crushes on various boys, most notably Ulrich. He is the second-best student in his class after Jeremy and the two often compete with each other, but Herb is almost always the loser. Herb is also shown to be easily scared off, quick to run away when something troubling happens.

* Nicolas Poliakoff
:Voiced by: Carole Baillien (French); Matthew Géczy (English)
:An eighth-grader at Kadic. He is the third member of Sissi&#x27;s gang. He usually does not show much intelligence, which is commonly conveyed through his frequent use of pauses and uhs in speech. He usually only does things when Sissi orders him to, and will otherwise not do much on his own. Nicolas also has also been shown to have a crush on Aelita, although he never acts on it. He can play the drums, and was in the Pop Rock Progressives, a band started by Odd. He is generally more tolerant of and less rude toward the Lyoko Warriors than Herb and Sissi are. In some episodes, it is shown that he has at least some degree of intelligence, as he wrote a script for a performance of Romeo and Juliet. Nicolas is also shown to be as easily frightened as Herb is.

* Jean-Pierre Delmas
:Voiced by: Bruno Mullenaerts (French); Allan Wenger (English)
:The principal of Kadic Academy, who is easily controlled by his daughter Sissi. He can be stubborn and incredibly ignorant at times, especially when members of the Lyoko Warriors are trying to convince him of any dangerous activity caused by X.A.N.A. His appearance is based on Hayao Miyazaki.

* Jim Morales
:Voiced by: Frédéric Meaux (French); David Gasman (English)
:The physical education teacher of Kadic Academy and the chief disciplinarian. He is frequently mentioned to have had an extensive job history, although whenever it comes up, he almost always ends up dismissing it by saying, &quot;I&#x27;d rather not talk about it.&quot; Jim is often shown to digress from his lectures as he starts to reminisce on stories of his past, usually before being interrupted by someone or cutting himself off. On several occasions, Jim has discovered the existence of Lyoko or X.A.N.A. and displayed his helpfulness and willingness to keep it a secret, however, his memories are always erased through the use of &quot;Return to the Past.&quot; One of his more notable secrets is that he once starred in a film called &quot;Paco, the King of Disco&quot;.

* Suzanne Hertz
:Voiced by: Nathalie Stas (French); Jodi Forrest (English)
:Usually referred to as Mrs. Hertz, she&#x27;s a science teacher at Kadic. She is the most shown primary academics teacher in the series and appears to teach most branches of science at Kadic. She is also the only faculty member shown to organize field trips, which happens on several occasions. She has been shown to dislike or be disappointed in Odd and Ulrich, but takes a liking to Jeremy, and later Aelita.

* Milly Solovieff and Tamiya Diop
:Milly voiced by: Mirabelle Kirkland (English)
:Tamiya voiced by: Julie Basecqz (French); Barbara Weber-Scaff (English)
:The sole members of the Kadic News crew, who are both are in sixth grade and share a dorm room. Tamiya is of Franco-African descent and seems to be less driven by her emotions, which allows her to think more clearly than Milly when bad things happen to them.

* Hiroki Ishiyama
:Voiced by: Guylaine Gibert (French); Barbara Weber-Scaff (English) 
:Yumi&#x27;s younger brother. He is often shown pestering her about things and purposely being annoying, such as asking her to do his homework or mentioning her feelings for Ulrich. He is frequently shown playing on a handheld gaming device, and is often shown with his friend, Johnny Cleary. Hiroki has, on occasion, assisted Yumi when she needed it, although he usually requires some form of bribe.

* Takeho and Akiko Ishiyama
:Takeho voiced by: David Gasman (English) 
:Akiko voiced by: Barbara Weber-Scaff (English) 
:The parents of Yumi and Hiroki. Takeho is shown to be a fairly typical semi-strict busy father and works for a local branch of a Japanese company. Akiko is depicted as a typical non-working housewife and is generally the first one to ask Yumi if something is wrong. When her parents appear in an episode, it usually focuses on Yumi&#x27;s family issues.

:It is implied that Takeho and Akiho have a low-key fractious relationship, with semi-frequent arguments that their children sometimes overhear. This seems to contribute to Yumi&#x27;s reserve, and possibly, her reticence in pursuing a more serious emotional relationship with Ulrich.

===Supporting characters===
* Waldo Franz Schaeffer
:Voiced by: Mathieu Moreau (French); Paul Bandey (season 2), Alan Wenger (season 4) (English)
:More commonly known as Franz Hopper (a combination of his middle name and the maiden name of his wife) he is/was the creator of both Lyoko and X.A.N.A., and was involved in the creation of Project Carthage. His wife Anthea, was kidnapped by men in black suits and he was forced to flee with his young daughter, Aelita. The two went to live in a house called the Hermitage, located in a park near Kadic Academy and the abandoned factory. While working as a science teacher at the school, he constructed the Supercomputer in the factory, and programmed X.A.N.A. and the virtual world of Lyoko within it. When the men in black suits tracked him down again, he took Aelita to the factory and virtualized her into Lyoko with him, where he believed they would be safe. However, X.A.N.A. refused to obey its creator&#x27;s orders or live in peace alongside Franz and his daughter. Franz was forced to shut the Supercomputer down until it was eventually discovered by Jeremy nearly ten years later. In one of the final episodes of the show, he sacrifices himself to allow Jeremy to finally destroy X.A.N.A.

== Development ==
=== Origins ===
&quot;Code Lyoko&quot; originates from the film short &quot;Les enfants font leur cinéma&quot; (&quot;The children make their movies&quot;), directed by Thomas Romain and produced by a group of students from Parisian visual arts school Gobelins School of the Image. Romain worked with Tania Palumbo, Stanislas Brunet, and Jerome Cottray to create the film, which was screened at the 2000 Annecy International Animated Film Festival. French animation company Antefilms took interest in the film due to its atmosphere and offered Romain and Palumbo a contract to turn it into a series. This led to the development of the pilot, &quot;Garage Kids&quot;.

&quot;Garage Kids&quot; was produced in 2001 by Antefilms. The project was created by Palumbo, Romain, and Carlo de Boutiny and developed by Anne de Galard. Its producers were Eric Garnet, Nicolas Atlan, Benoît di Sabatino, and Christophe di Sabatino.

Similar to its succeeding show &quot;Code Lyoko&quot;, &quot;Garage Kids&quot; was originally envisioned as a 26-episode miniseries detailing the lives of four French boarding school students who discover the secret of the virtual world of Xanadu; created by a research group headed by a character known as the &quot;Professor&quot;. The pilot featured both traditional animation and CGI. &quot;The Matrix&quot; had &quot;enormous influence&quot; on the pilot according to Romain, citing the concept of a machine allowing the characters to dive in a virtual world, an operator who supervises the trip and the correlation between the action in the real world and the virtual world. Anime also served as inspiration, specifically &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot; for its &quot;worrying digital dimension&quot; and &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot; for its dangerous entities to fight. While similarities to &quot;Tron&quot; have been noted, Romain admitted to not having seen the film yet when the series was being developed.

When the concept on the virtual world was added, Antefilms suggested animating it with CGI to help make the series unique, promote a video game theme and make the separation between the virtual and real worlds clearer. While incorporating it, Palumbo and Romain wanted to avoid making the series &quot;too playful and superficial&quot; and sought to &quot;get around the censoring done by TV channels that tend to soften youth programs&quot; by writing episodes &quot;with tension, suspense, even tragic scenes. Things that are hard to imagine seeing in a cartoon series for kids.&quot;

A team of artists were recruited in order to give the backgrounds of the real world a realistic appearance. The factory and boarding schools specifically were modelled after locations in France. The factory was based on a Renault production plant in Boulogne-Billancourt (Île Seguin), which has since been demolished. The school, Kadic Academy, is based on Lycée Lakanal in Sceaux, which Romain had attended. Palumbo and Romain were adamant on keeping the locales based on &quot;the France we knew&quot;, as they wanted to avoid what they perceived as &quot;fantastical&quot; or &quot;Americanized&quot; locations other French cartoons used at the time.

Scripting for the series officially began in January 2002, with Frédéric Lenoir, Françoise Charpiat, and Laurent Turner being brought on as writers. It was around then when Aelita was added, who at this point was an AI who lived on the virtual world. When choosing a director, the team wanted &quot;a new generation&quot; to be in charge of the series. Jérôme Mouscadet was hired in June 2002 after having dinner with a friend who worked at Antefilms. While Mouscadet had experience with animation from directing short films at a small company, he never directed a series before. One of his first major contributions was to drop the idea of the characters retaining their powers in the real world, which he decided after wanting to further separate the virtual world from the real world. Progress was slow over the summer of 2002, which Mouscadet attributed to the series&#x27; head writer &quot;[taking] a lot of vacation&quot;. Antefilms reached out to Sophie Decroisette as a replacement, who had recently been a writer for &quot;Malo Korrigan&quot; and was on a break after giving birth to her first child. Decroisette described this stage of writing as expanding the concept and finding strong motivations for the characters. On &quot;Garage Kids&quot;&#x27; pilot, she said: &quot;I really just saw a teaser that was focusing on images[. T]here were great ideas in the images, notably the transition from one universe to the other, but plot-wise, it was just &quot;they travel from one universe to the other&quot;, with no explanation on &quot;how&quot; and &quot;why&quot;. They had no real motivation, they were fighting X.A.N.A., which was represented as black spheres, something like this, but none of this was clearly defined. Our job, with the other writers, was to try to introduce &quot;scientific accuracy&quot;&quot;. The writers struggled the most with finding a motivation for Jeremy. Charpiat suggested during a meeting that he want to bring Aelita onto Earth, which became the basis for the first season. Another concept emerged from Lenoir in the form of a time travel mechanism to explain how X.A.N.A. could cause massive damage to Earth, with other people witnessing the destruction, and have the heroes fix it without people becoming suspicious. This eventually turned into the Supercomputer&#x27;s &quot;Return to the Past&quot; function.

Networks were hesitant to &quot;Garage Kids&quot; due to its serial nature, as they feared it would alienate potential viewers who missed the first episodes and they wanted to rerun the series without worrying about episode order. This lead the writing team to shift to a more episodic format. Romain ultimately chose to leave the series after this change in 2003 to work on the French-Japanese anime series &quot;Ōban Star-Racers&quot;. Tania Palumbo remained on the series through its conclusion as creative director. She designed and named the main characters, with Jeremy being named after one of her and Romain&#x27;s classmates at Gobelins. The series&#x27; human character designs were primarily influenced by Japanese animator Kōji Morimoto&#x27;s style.

After the series was sold to France 3 and Canal J, producers felt &quot;Garage Kids&quot; was too unclear for a title and requested it be renamed. Palumbo and production manager Anne de Galard ultimately settled on &quot;Code Lyoko&quot;, with Lyoko originating from the Japanese word &quot;旅行&quot; (Ryokō) meaning &quot;travel&quot; to further emphasis the dive into the virtual world. The virtual world was subsequently renamed &quot;Lyoko&quot; as well.

=== Writing ===
The writing process for &quot;Code Lyoko&quot; usually began with the head writer asking the other writers for story pitches. If they liked an idea, it next had to receive approval from the show&#x27;s director, producers and broadcasters before it could be turned into a 4-page synopsis. After going through the approval process again, it was then expanded into a script and approved one last time to be sent off for production. Writing an episode typically lasted 2–3 weeks, though some took longer if higher-ups were unhappy with the story or it ran into issues. Sophie Decroisette, head writer of Code Lyoko&#x27;s first three seasons, described &quot;Image Problem&quot; as &quot;very difficult to write&quot; after its original writer left the show following the synopsis phase, requiring another writer to step in and finish it. The writing team was also mandated by production to approve 4 scripts per month.

Following the success of the first season, the show was able to have more continuous storylines. Decroisette and show director Jérôme Mouscadet wrote the series&#x27; backstory during the break between season 1 and 2. Before Romain left the project, the idea of Lyoko being created by a team of researchers had changed to just one: Franz Hopper. However his motivations and identity were never established. Decroisette revealed during production of season 4 that the full backstory would not be told in the show, as she considered it &quot;very complicated... dense and [not] really important to the story.&quot;

The show&#x27;s international success in the United States also affected production. Romance elements were ultimately reduced after season 2 to appease American audiences. Aside from this, Decroisette otherwise noted that she &quot;never felt censored&quot; while working on the series, apart from a self-imposed restriction to write stories appropriate for children. Bruno Regeste became head writer for &quot;Code Lyoko&quot;&#x27;s final season after Decroisette stepped down while she was pregnant with her second child, though she continued writing scripts and closely monitored episodes involving Replikas.

=== Animation ===
The series&#x27; traditional animation was handled overseas by Animation Services Hong Kong Limited, Fantasia Animation and Welkin Animation also worked on the show&#x27;s first two seasons. Starting around the third season, a team dedicated to &quot;Code Lyoko&quot; was formed at Hong Kong Limited&#x27;s studio, who were managed on-site by two members from Antefilms&#x27; Paris office. This change stemmed from Mouscadet&#x27;s desire for a more consistent animation quality, which he described trying to manage it prior to that point as &quot;a little bit like steering an ocean liner with binoculars&quot;. The 3D segments were animated in-house by Antefilm&#x27;s CGI team at their Angoulême office.

== Episodes ==

== Telecast and home media ==
The show first premiered on France 3 on 3 September 2003 and ended on 10 November 2007 in France and on Cartoon Network in the U.S. on 19 April 2004. The second season started on 19 September 2005. The two-part &quot;X.A.N.A. Awakens&quot; prequel aired on 2–3 October 2006, and the third season started a day later on 4 October 2006. The fourth and final season began on 18 May 2007. The final episode aired on Cartoon Network was &quot;Cousins Once Removed&quot;, and the remaining seven episodes were released online on Cartoon Network Video. During its run, it was simultaneously both part of its afterschool weekday action animation light-toned programming block, Miguzi from 2004 until 2007 when it was carried over into its rebranded Master Control block. It was also a standalone show on its primetime slot and continued until 2008. The show also aired on Kabillion from 2007 to 2015.

The show also aired in Latin America and Japan on Jetix. In Italy, the show aired on Disney Channel, Rai 2, RaiSat Smash, Rai Gulp and was published on DVD by Delta Pictures under the label 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment.

In January 2011, all four seasons of &quot;Code Lyoko&quot; were released on iTunes in the U.S. and France by MoonScoop Holdings, although as of May 2019, only seasons 1 and 2 are available and other seasons have been removed. In October 2011, all four seasons were released on Amazon Instant Streaming and on DVD in the U.S., however, these DVDs are now out of print.

All four seasons were made available on Netflix on 6 August 2012, but were removed for unknown reasons. The show was eventually returned to Netflix on 1 October 2020 after being taken down following MoonScoop&#x27;s bankruptcy. Since 2015, all of the English-dubbed episodes (including the prequel &quot;X.A.N.A. Awakens&quot;) are viewable on YouTube. Since 2019, an upscaled HD version of the series is also available on Amazon Prime Video in the U.S. and the United Kingdom.

== Reception ==
Emily Ashby of Common Sense Media gave the show 4/5 stars, writing: &quot;Kids will like the battles in Lyoko -- each plays out much like a video game&quot;, and added: &quot;Strategy and teamwork are themes throughout the series.&quot; In a 2020 retrospective of the show for Comic Book Resources, Noah Dominguez wrote: &quot;Whether you&#x27;re a returning traveler or are only visiting Lyoko for the first time, &quot;Code Lyoko&quot; still holds up as a unique, easily-accessible gem of the 2000s&quot;.

&quot;Code Lyoko&quot; was voted as the best show by Canal J viewers in France. The series has achieved international fame as well, becoming the #2 show on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Miguzi block upon its premiere in the United States. It was the block&#x27;s most popular series in 2005 and Cartoon Network&#x27;s #3 best performing show overall in 2006. Kabillion had it as #4 in monthly average views in 2010. The show has reached success in Spain as one of Clan TVE&#x27;s highest-rated shows, on Italy&#x27;s Rai2 network, and in Finland and the United Kingdom as well. The show also won France&#x27;s Prix de l&#x27;Export 2006 Award for Animation in December 2006.

== Merchandise ==
Several &quot;Code Lyoko&quot; products have been released, including DVDs, a series of cine-manga by Tokyopop, a series of four novels by Italian publisher Atlantyca Entertainment, apparel, and other accessories. In 2006, Marvel Toys released a line of &quot;Code Lyoko&quot; toys and action figures.

When the show was about to come to an end in 2007, The Game Factory released three video games based on the show: &quot;Code Lyoko&quot; and &quot;Code Lyoko: Fall of X.A.N.A.&quot; for the Nintendo DS, and &quot;Code Lyoko: Quest for Infinity&quot; for the Wii, PSP, and PlayStation 2. The games were met with mixed to positive reviews from critics despite some criticisms of gameplay. There have been other games released through various mediums, one being Facebook.

A series of Clan TVE festivals in Spain included live stage shows based on Code Lyoko among other things. A game show known as Code Lyoko Challenge was planned to be released in late 2012, but fell through.

===Novels===
A series of four chapter books was released by Atlantyca Entertainment and distributed in Italy and other countries. The novels delve deeper into the unanswered questions of the series. Taking place after the end of the series, X.A.N.A. has miraculously survived and returns though weakened and initially missing its memories. X.A.N.A. possesses Eva Skinner, an American girl, and travels to France in order to infiltrate the gang and kill them off. Unaware of their enemy&#x27;s presence, the group works to find clues about Aelita&#x27;s past, left by her father Franz Hopper, and confirm whether or not her mother is still alive somewhere, but at the same time, a terrorist group, the Green Phoenix, has become interested in the Supercomputer and intend to use both it and the virtual world of Lyoko for evil purposes.

It was confirmed that the series will never be released officially in English, nor the final two books released in French. However, sometime later, a fan community came together and sought to not only finish the series but translate it into more languages, including English. They have since completed their work and made it available for free download in September 2014.

<doc id="855983" wikidata="Q1339612" url="?curid=855983" title="Scott Cunningham">
<text>Scott Douglas Cunningham (June 27, 1956 – March 28, 1993) was an American writer. Cunningham is the author of several books on Wicca and various other alternative religious subjects.

His work &quot;Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner&quot;, is one of the most successful books on Wicca ever published; he was a friend of notable occultists and Wiccans such as Raymond Buckland, and was a member of the Serpent Stone Family, and received his Third Degree Initiation as a member of that coven.

==Early life==
Scott Cunningham was born at the William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, USA, the second son of prolific author Chester Grant &quot;Chet&quot; Cunningham and Rose Marie Wilhoit Cunningham. The family moved to San Diego, California in the fall of 1959 due to Rose Marie&#x27;s health problems. The doctors in Royal Oak declared the mild climate in San Diego ideal for her. Outside of many trips to Hawaii, Cunningham lived in San Diego all his life.

Cunningham had one older brother, Greg, and a younger sister, Christine. Scott was openly gay for much of his life.

He studied creative writing at San Diego State University, where he enrolled in 1978. After two years in the program, however, he had more published works than several of his professors and dropped out of the university to write full-time. In the early 1980s Cunningham wrote &quot;more than a dozen novels in various genres from adventure to horror&quot;, using pseudonyms, such as &quot;Cathy Cunningham&quot; or &quot;Dirk Fletcher&quot;, for his novels. During this period he had as a roommate, magical writer Donald Michael Kraig and often socialized with Neopagan witchcraft writer Raymond Buckland, who was also living in San Diego at the time.

==Wicca==
In 1980, Cunningham began initiate training under Raven Grimassi and remained as a first-degree initiate until 1982 when he left the tradition to pursue a solo practice of witchcraft.

==Death==
In 1983, Scott Cunningham was diagnosed with lymphoma, which he successfully overcame. In 1990, while on a speaking tour in Massachusetts, he suddenly fell ill and was diagnosed with AIDS-related cryptococcal meningitis. He suffered from several infections and died in March 1993. He was 36.

<text>The Parliament of Pakistan (, , &quot;Pakistan Advisory Council&quot; or &quot;Pakistan Consultative Assembly&quot;) is the supreme legislative body of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. It is a bicameral federal legislature, composed of the President of Pakistan and two houses: the Senate and the National Assembly. The president, as head of the legislature, has the power to summon or prorogue either house of the Parliament. The president can dissolve the National Assembly, only on the Prime Minister&#x27;s advice.

The Parliament meets at the Parliament House building in red zone Islamabad, where debating chambers for both houses are present. Until 1960, the Parliament House was located in Karachi. The parliament building in Islamabad was inaugurated on 28 May 1986.

==History==
===Founding===
The Muslim League of India had, since the middle of twentieth century, demanded for a separate homeland on the basis of the Two-nation theory. The British rulers realized that the Hindus and Muslims of India remained two separate and distinct nations and socio-cultural entities. The British rulers were left with no option but to eventually accept the demand of the Muslims of India. On 3rd June 1947, Lord Mountbatten, the last Viceroy of India, called the conference of all the leaders of the Sub-continent and communicated to them his Government&#x27;s Plan for the transfer of power. At that time, a notification was issued in the &quot;Gazette of India&quot;, published on 26 July 1947 in which the first Constituent Assembly of Pakistan was given shape with 69 Members (later on the membership was increased to 79), including one female Member. The State of Pakistan was created under the Independence Act of 1947. The Act made the existing Constituent Assemblies, the dominion legislatures. These Assemblies were allowed to exercise all the powers which were formerly exercised by the Central Legislature, in addition to the powers regarding the framing of a new Constitution, prior to which all territories were to be governed in accordance with the Government of India Act 1935. The first session of the first Constituent Assembly of Pakistan was held on 10 August 1947 at Sindh Assembly Building in Karachi. On 11 August 1947 Muhammad Ali Jinnah was elected unanimously as the president of the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan and the National Flag was formally approved by the Assembly. On 12 August 1947, a resolution was approved regarding officially addressing Jinnah as &quot;Quaid-i-Azam&quot;. On the same day, a special committee called the &quot;Committee on Fundamental Rights of Citizens and Minorities of Pakistan&quot; was appointed to look into and advise the Assembly on matters relating to fundamental rights of the citizens, particularly the minorities, with the aim to legislate on these issues appropriately. On 14 August 1947, the Transfer of Power took place. Lord Mountbatten, Governor General of India, addressed the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan. The Quaid gave a reply to the address in the house, on which the principles of the State of Pakistan were laid. On 15 August 1947, the Quaid-i-Azam was sworn in as the first Governor General of Pakistan. Mian Sir Abdur Rashid, Chief Justice of Pakistan, administered the oath of office from him. The Quaid remained in this position till his death on 11 September 1948.

===1949 Objectives Resolution===

The foremost task before the first Constituent Assembly was the framing the Constitution for the nation. On 7 March 1949, the Objectives Resolution, which now serves as the basic law of Pakistan, was introduced by the first Prime Minister Nawabzada Liaquat Ali Khan, and later adopted by the Constituent Assembly on 12 March 1949. On the same day, a 24-member Basic Principles Committee was formed to prepare a draft Constitution on the basis of the Objectives Resolution. On 16 October 1951, Khan, the mover of the Objective Resolution, was assassinated and Khawaja Nazimuddin took over as the Prime Minister on 17 October 1951. The final draft of the Constitution was prepared in 1954. By that time, Muhammad Ali Bogra had taken over as the Prime Minister. However, just before the draft could be placed in the house for approval, the Assembly was dissolved by the then Governor General Ghulam Muhammad on 24 October 1954. The Prime Minister was, however, not dismissed and was asked to run the administration, with a reconstituted Cabinet, until such time as the elections were held. Maulvi Tamizuddin, President of the Assembly, challenged the dissolution in the Sindh Chief Court, and won the case. The Government in return, went to the Federal Court, where the famous judgment was given by the then Chief Justice Muhammad Munir, according to which Maulvi Tamizuddin lost the case.

Furthermore, according to the book: Nigel Kelly, the objective resolution was filed on 12 March 1949, filed by Khwaja Nazimudin, Liaquat ali khan along with 25 members of the basic principle committee. It declared the some objectives including that the legal system should be independent of government. It also contained references to Islam.

=== 1955 Second Constituent Assembly ===
The second Constituent Assembly of Pakistan was created on 28 May 1955 under Governor General&#x27;s Order No.12 of 1955. The Electoral College for this Assembly was the Provincial Assemblies of respective Provinces. The strength of this Assembly was 80 Members, half each from East Pakistan and West Pakistan. One of the major decisions taken by this Assembly was the establishment of West Pakistan (One Unit), with the aim to create parity between the two wings (East and West Pakistan). This Assembly also achieved its target by giving the first Constitution to the nation i.e. the Constitution of Pakistan 1956. Chaudhry Muhammad Ali was the Prime Minister at that time. The draft of this Constitution was introduced in the Assembly on 9 January 1956 and was passed by the Assembly on 29 February 1956. The assent was given on it by the Governor General on 2 March 1956. This Constitution was enforced with effect from 23 March 1956. Under this Constitution, Pakistan became an Islamic Republic, hence 23 March became the country&#x27;s Republic day. It was the same day in 1940 that the historic Pakistan Resolution was adopted at Minto Park, Lahore. On 5 March 1956, Major General Iskandar Mirza became the first President of Pakistan. The 1956 constitution provided for Parliamentary form of government with all the executive powers in the hands of Prime Minister. The President was the Head of State, and was to be elected by all Members of the National and Provincial Assemblies. He was to hold office for 5 years. The President was to act on the advice of Prime Minister, except where he was empowered to act in his discretion. Under 1956 Constitution, Parliament was unicameral. Legislative powers vested in the Parliament, which consisted of the president and the National Assembly with 300 Members divided equally between East and West Pakistan. In addition to these 300 seats, five seats were reserved for women for each of the two wings, for a period of ten years: thus bringing the total membership of the house to 310. However, in the absence of any law to control the Political Parties and the problem of floor crossing, political instability perpetually ensued. Although the first general election were scheduled for early 1959, President Iskandar Mirza abrogated the Constitution, dissolved the National and Provincial Assemblies, and declared Martial Law, on 7 October 1958. He appointed General Muhammad Ayub Khan, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, as the Chief Martial Law Administrator. The new administration did not satisfy CMLA Ayub Khan who had more control in the administration than President Mirza. Ayub dispatched the military unit to enter in presidential palace on the midnight of 26–27 October 1958 and placed him in an airplane to exile in England.

===1960 Constitution Commission===
On 27 October 1958 General Muhammad Ayub Khan took over as second President of Pakistan. One of the first major steps taken by General Ayub Khan was the appointment of a Constitution Commission on 17 February 1960. The objective of this commission was to submit proposals, as to how best democracy can be strengthened and molded according to the country&#x27;s socio-political environment and Islamic principles of justice. The Commission submitted its report to the government on 29 April 1961. On the basis of this report a new Constitution was framed and given to the nation on 1 March 1962. General elections under the new Constitution were held on 28 March 1962 and elections to the special seats reserved for women were held on 29 May 1962. The first session of the third National Assembly was held on 8 June 1962 at Ayub Hall, Rawalpindi. The Constitution of 1962 envisaged a Federal State with Presidential form of government, with the National Assembly at the centre and the Provincial Assemblies in the Provinces. The Legislatures, both at center and in provinces were unicameral. The Federal system had been curtailed by allowing the Provincial Governors to be appointed directly by the president. All executive authority of the Republic of Pakistan, under the Constitution, vested in the office of the president. The President appointed his Cabinet members who were directly responsible to him. The electoral system was made indirect, and the &#x27;Basic Democrats&#x27;, for both wings were declared Electoral College for the purpose of electing the assemblies and the president. Basic democrats were 80,000 in number (40,000 from each East and West Pakistan). The total membership of the National Assembly was 156, one half of whom were to be elected from East Pakistan and other half from West Pakistan, also three seats were reserved for women from each province. The term of this Assembly was three years. The norm was established that if the president was from West Pakistan, the Speaker was to be from East Pakistan and &quot;vice versa&quot;. One of the major achievements of this Assembly was the passage of Political Parities Act, 1962. On 25 March 1969 the second Martial law was imposed and General Agha Muhammad Yahya Khan took over as the president of Pakistan and Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA). He later issued a Legal Framework Order (LFO), under which the first ever general elections were held on 7 December 1970. This was the first Assembly elected on the adult franchise and population basis. It consist of 313 members, 169 from East Pakistan and 144 from West Pakistan including 13 reserved seats for women (6 were from West Pakistan and 7 from East Pakistan). Soon after the elections, due to grave political differences, the Province of East Pakistan seceded from West Pakistan and became Bangladesh. On 20 December 1971 Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took over as the President of Pakistan as well as the first civil Chief Martial Law Administrator.

=== 1973 Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan ===
The first session of the National Assembly, due to the delay caused by the separation of East Pakistan, was held on 14 April 1972 at the State Bank Building, Islamabad, in which all 144 Members from West Pakistan and two from former East Pakistan (Mr. Noor-ul-Amin and Raja Tridev Roy who had chosen to join Pakistan) participated. On 17 April 1972 an Interim Constitution was adopted by the National Assembly, which provided for a Presidential form of Government. Under this Constitution, the National Assembly was not to be dissolved earlier than 14 August 1973. The Interim Constitution dealt in detail with the distribution of powers between the Centre and the Provinces. The Assembly also formed a Constitution Committee on 17 April 1972 to prepare the first draft for framing a Constitution. The report of the committee was presented with a draft Constitution on 31 December 1972. It was unanimously passed by the Assembly in its session on 10 April 1973 and was authenticated by the president on 12 April 1973. This Constitution, called the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan 1973, was promulgated on 14 August 1973. On the same day, Mr. Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto took oath as the Prime Minister, while Mr. Fazal Illahi Choudhary took oath as the president of Pakistan. The 1973 Constitution provides for a parliamentary form of government where the executive authority of the state vests with the Prime Minister. The President, according to the Constitution, is at the apex, representing the unity of the Republic. From 1947 to 1973, the country had had a unicameral system, but under the 1973 Constitution, Pakistan adopted a bicameral federal legislature, called Parliament, composed of the President, the Senate and the National Assembly. Originally, the general seats of the National Assembly were 200 with additional 10 seats reserved for women, bringing the total strength to 210. The newly created Upper house i.e. the Senate had 63 members. Later in 1985 through a Presidential Order (P.O. No. 14 of 1985), seven seats were added to the general seats and ten to the reserved seats for women in the National Assembly. Ten seats were exclusively reserved for minorities to be filled through separate electorate system. Thus the total strength of the lower house reached to 237 members. Similarly the size of the Senate was also increased from 63 to 87 members.

Under the 1973 Constitution the National Assembly is elected for five years term, unless sooner dissolved. The seats in National Assembly, unlike the Senate, are allocated to each province and other units of the federation, on the basis of population. The Constitutional provision of 20 special seats for women lapsed in 1990, thus decreased the Assembly strength from 237 to 217. Under the Constitution, elections to the 10 seats reserved for minority were held on separate electorate basis. Despite the tenure of the Assembly being five years, as prescribed in the Constitution, Mr. Z.A. Bhutto, on 7 January 1977 announced the holding of elections before time. Consequently, on 10 January 1977, he advised the president to dissolve the National Assembly. Elections were held on 7 March 1977. The opposition charged the government with rigging the elections to the National Assembly and thereafter boycotted the Provincial Assemblies elections. Since the opposition had not accepted the National Assembly elections result, they did not take oath. This resulted in severe political crisis and Martial Law was imposed by the then Army Chief, General Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, on 5 July 1977.

===1981 Majlis-e-Shoora===
On 25 December 1981, under Presidential Order (P.O.15 of 1981) a Federal Council (Majlis-e-Shoora) was constituted by the president. Its members were nominated by the president. The first session of this council was held on 11 January 1982. In this way, limited and controlled political activities were resumed. General elections were later held for the National and Provincial Assemblies on 25 February 1985, on non-party basis.

;1985 Amendments
On 2 March 1985, the revival of Constitution Order (P.O.14 of 1985) was issued in which a large number of amendments were made in the Constitution. Article 1 substituted the name &quot;Parliament&quot; for the more Islamic term &quot;Majlis-e-Shoora&quot;. The first session of the National Assembly was held 20 March 1985. Mr. Muhammad Khan Junejo, was nominated as the Prime Minister of Pakistan by the president (General Zia-ul-Haq). He received vote of confidence on 24 March 1985. In November 1985, the 8th Constitutional Amendment was adopted by the Parliament. Besides changes in other Articles in the Constitution the significant Article 58(2)(b) was added, according to which the president acquired discretionary powers to dissolves the National Assembly. On 29 May 1988 the Assembly was dissolved by the president by using the power acquired under Article 58(2)(b).

===1988 elections===

The General elections for the eighth National Assembly was held on 16 November 1988. The first session was convened by the President on 30 November 1988. Mr. Miraj Khalid was elected as the Speaker of the National Assembly on 3 December 1988. Benazir Bhutto was nominated as Prime Minister of Pakistan and took the oath of the Office on 2 December 1988. The Assembly was later dissolved by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan under Article 58(2)(b) of the Constitution of Pakistan, on 6 August 1990. The General elections for the ninth National Assembly was held on 24 October 1990. The first session was held on 3 November 1990. Mr. Gohar Ayub Khan was elected as the Speaker of the National Assembly and he took oath on 4 November 1990. Muhammad Nawaz Sharif was elected as Prime Minister of Pakistan and took oath on 11 November 1990. The Assembly was again dissolved by the then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, under Article 58(2)(b) on 18 April 1993. The dissolution of the National Assembly was challenged in the Supreme Court of Pakistan and after hearing the case the Assembly was restored by the Supreme Court on 26 May 1993. The Assembly was later dissolved on the advice of the Prime Minister on 18 July 1993.

===1993 Tenth National Assembly===
The elections for tenth National Assembly was held on 6 October 1993. The first session was held on 15 October 1993. Syed Yousaf Raza Gillani took oath of the office of the Speaker National Assembly on 17 October 1993. Mohtarma Benizar Bhutto administered the oath as Prime Minister of Pakistan on 19 October 1993. The Assembly was dissolved by President Farooq Ahmad Khan Laghari on 5 November 1996. The elections for eleventh National Assembly was held on 3 February 1997. The first session was held on 15 February 1997. Mr. Illahi Bukhsh Soomro took oath of the office of the Speaker National Assembly on 16 February 1997. Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif took oath as prime minister of Pakistan and leader of the house on 17 February 1997. The new Assembly came into power with an overwhelming majority. The Article 58(2)(b) was later on omitted from the Constitution vide 13th Amendment in the Constitution in April 1997. It may be pertinent to note at this point that while, ostensibly, sixteen amendments have been made in the Constitution so far, the ninth and the eleventh Constitutional Amendments were, however, passed by the Senate alone and fifteenth by the National Assembly alone, hence these amendments lapsed. The fourteenth Amendment in the Constitution empowered a check on floor crossing of legislators.

===1999 Musharraf Emergency===
Chief of Army Staff General Pervez Musharraf, who was also Chairman Joint Staff Committee, took over the government from Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and declared himself as Chief Executive through a Proclamation of Emergency, on 12 October 1999. Through Provisional Constitutional Order (PCO) issued on 14 October 1999, he held the Constitution in abeyance, suspended the Senate, National and Provincial Assemblies, chairman and Deputy Chairman Senate, Speaker, Deputy Speaker National and Provincial Assemblies and dismissed the Federal and Provincial governments. President Mr. Muhammad Rafiq Tarar was, however, allowed to continue in his office. Under PCO (order No. 6) 29 October 1999, (as amended by C.E. Order No.5, 4 July 2001), the National Security Council was established for the purpose to tender advice to the Chief Executive (later on President), on matters relating to Islamic ideology, national security, sovereignty, integrity and solidarity of Pakistan so as to achieve the aims and objective as enshrined in the Objectives Resolution 1949.

Syed Zafar Ali Shah, MNA and Illahi Bukhsh Soomro, Speaker National Assembly, challenged the suspension orders in the Supreme Court. The Court in its judgment on 12 May 2000 validated the military takeover by giving three years time frame to the government, starting from 12 October 1999. The Court in its judgement asked the government to complete its agenda and then hand over powers to the elected government. The court also allowed the military government to bring necessary Constitutional Amendments, provided that those should not change the basic feature of Federal Parliamentary democracy, independence of judiciary and Islamic provisions in the Constitution. The court reserved the right of Judicial Review and power of validity of any act or any action of the government, if challenged, in the light of State necessity. On 20 June 2001, through a notification (C.E. Order No.1) the Chief Executive assumed the office of the president of Pakistan under President&#x27;s Succession Order, 2001. On the same day, through another Order (C.E. Order No. 2, 2001), the president converted the orders of suspension of legislative bodies and their presiding officers, into dissolution. The elections for twelfth National Assembly was held on 10 October 2002. The inaugural session of the National Assembly was held on 16 November 2002 and Ch Amir Hussain and Sardar Muhammad Yaqoob were elected Speaker and Deputy Speaker respectively on 19 November 2002.

On this issue, Opposition Parties submitted a resolution for vote of no confidence against Speaker National Assembly on 20 June 2003 which was rejected on 28 June 2003.

National Assembly of Pakistan expressed confidence in the leadership of President General Pervez Musharraf through the resolution on 1 January 2004. President General Pervez Musharraf addressed the Joint Session of the Parliament on 17 January 2004. Prime Minister Mir Zafarullah Khan Jamali resigned from his office on 26 June 2004.

National Assembly of Pakistan completed its Constitutional tenure on 15 November 2007. After the resignation from the post of Chief of Army Staff, Mr. Pervez Musharraf administered the oath of President of Islamic Republic of Pakistan on 29 November 2007.

===2008 Election===
The date of next General Election was fixed for 28 January 2008. After the assassination of Muhtarma Benazir Bhutto on 27 December 2007, date of election was rescheduled for 18 February 2008.

After consultation with the leadership of all political parties in the Parliament, Speaker National Assembly announced the Constitutional Reforms Committee (CRC) on 29 April 2009.

== National Assembly (Aiwan-e-Zeerin or Lower House) ==
Qaumi Assembly (English: National Assembly of Pakistan) is the lower house of the parliament. The National Assembly has 336 seats, 266 of which are directly elected, 60 are reserved for women and a further 10 for religious minorities5. The National Assembly of Pakistan is the country&#x27;s sovereign legislative body. It embodies the will of the people to let themselves be governed under the democratic, multi-party Federal Parliamentary System. The National Assembly makes laws for the Federation in respect of the powers enumerated in the Federal Legislative list. Through its debates, adjournment motion, question hour and Standing Committees, the National Assembly keeps as check over the Executive and ensures that the government functions within the parameters set out in the Constitution and does not violate the fundamental rights of citizens. Only the National Assembly, through its Public Accounts Committee, scrutinizes public spending and exercises control of expenditure incurred by the government. The Members of the National Assembly are to be elected by direct and free vote in accordance with law.

Article 50 of the Constitution provides that the Parliament of Pakistan shall consist of president and the two houses known as the National Assembly and the Senate. The National Assembly has an edge over the Senate by legislating exclusively on money matters. With exception to money bills, however, both the houses work together to carry out the basic work of the Parliament, i.e. law making. The bill relating to the Federal Legislative List can be originated in either house. If the house passed the bill through majority vote, it shall be transmitted to the other house. If the other house passes it without amendment, it shall be presented to the president for assent. If the bill, transmitted to the other house, is not passed within ninety days or rejected, it shall be considered in a joint sitting to be summoned by the president on the request of the house in which the bill was originated. If the bill is passed in the joint sitting, with or without amendments, by the votes of majority of the members of the two houses, it shall be presented to the president for assent.

If the bill is presented to the president for assent, he shall assent to the bill in not later than ten days. If it is not a money bill, the president may return the bill to the Majlis-e-Shoora with a message requesting that the bill be reconsidered and that an amendment specified in the message be considered. The Majlis-e-Shoora shall reconsider the bill in a joint sitting. If the bill is passed again, with or without amendment, by vote of the majority of the members present and voting, it shall be presented to the president and the president shall give his assent within ten days; failing which such assent shall be deemed to have been given. Under the Constitution, the Parliament may also legislate for two or more Provinces by consent and request made by those Provinces. If the Federal Government proclaims State of Emergency in any province, the power to legislate about that province is vested in the Parliament. But the bills passed by the Parliament during the State of Emergency, shall cease to be in force after the expiration of six months from the date Emergency is lifted. Nevertheless, the steps already taken under these Acts shall remain valid. In exercises of its constitutional role, the Parliament also has other very important duties to perform. The president, who is at the apex, is elected by members of both houses of the Parliament and the Provincial Assemblies. The Prime Minister, who heads the Cabinet and is meant to aid and advise the president in his functions, belongs to the National Assembly. He enjoys the confidence of the majority of the members of the National Assembly. Members of the Cabinet are appointed by the president on the advice of the prime minister.

In the formation of the Cabinet the major portion (75%), goes to National Assembly while the rest (25%) are taken from the Senate. There is a democratic procedure, under article 95 of the constitution, to remove the Prime Minister from his office if he or she loses confidence of the majority of the members of the National Assembly. In this respect a resolution for a vote of no-confidence is moved by not less than 20% of the total membership of the National Assembly. If the resolution is passed by majority of the total membership of the National Assembly, the Prime Minister immediately ceases to hold the office. Similarly, for the removal or impeachment of the president, not less than one-half of the total membership of either house may give in writing its intention to do so, to the Speaker National Assembly, or, as the case may be, to the Chairman Senate, for moving a resolution for the purpose. In a joint sitting of the two houses, convened for the purpose, and after the deliberations, if the resolution is passed by the votes of not less than two thirds of the total membership of the Parliament, the president shall cease to hold office immediately on the passing of the resolution. In case emergency is proclaimed, the Parliament holds the authority to extend the term of the National Assembly. Under the Constitution, the Parliament may also, on the request of the Federal Government, by law, confer functions upon officers or authorities subordinate to the Federal Government.
==Senate (Aiwan-e Bala or Upper House)==

The main purpose for the creation of the Aiwan-e Bala (English: Senate of Pakistan) was to give equal representation to all the federating units since the membership of the National Assembly was based on the population of each province. Equal provincial membership in the Senate, thus, balances the provincial inequality in the National Assembly and dispels doubts and apprehension, if any, regarding deprivation and exploitation. The role of the Senate is to promote national cohesion and harmony and to alleviate fears of the smaller provinces regarding domination by any one province because of its majority, in the National Assembly. The Senate, is a body which represents the provinces/territories of the country and promotes a feeling of equality, peace and harmony, which is essential for the growth and prosperity of a nation. Thus, the Senate in Pakistan, over the years, has emerged as an essential organ and a stabilizing factor of the federation. The Senate consists of 100 members. Each of the four provincial assemblies shall elect in the next Senate election twenty three members from their respective provinces that include fourteen on general seats, four on seats reserved for technocrats including Ulema, four on seats reserved for women and one on seat reserved for non-Muslims, 4 members are elected from Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) by the members of National Assembly from these areas, 2 members, 1 woman and 1 technocrat is elected from the Federal Capital by the members of National Assembly, It is the responsibility of the Chief Election Commissioner to hold and make arrangements for the Senate elections in accordance with the system of proportional representation by means of a single transferable vote through electoral colleges. The term of the members of the Senate is 6 years. However, the term of the first group of the Senators, who shall retire after completion of first 3 years of the Senate, is determined by drawing of lots by the Chief Election Commissioner.

==Electoral procedure==

At the national level, Pakistan elects a bicameral legislature, the Parliament of Pakistan, which consists of a directly elected National Assembly of Pakistan and a Senate, whose members are chosen by elected provincial legislators. The Prime Minister of Pakistan is elected by the National Assembly. The president is elected by the Electoral college, which consists of both houses of Parliament together with the provincial assemblies. In addition to the national parliament and the provincial assemblies, Pakistan also has more than five thousand elected local governments. Elections in Pakistan are conducted under the supervision of Election Commission of Pakistan. The country offers a multi-party system, with numerous parties. Frequently, no single party holds a majority, and therefore parties must form alliances during or after elections, with coalition governments forming out of negotiations between parties. The Parliament of Pakistan consists of the president and two houses to be known respectively as National Assembly and the Senate. The National Assembly consists of 342 Seats including 60 seats reserved for Women and 10 Seats reserved for Non-Muslims. The Senate consists of 104 Members including 17 Seats reserved for Women and 17 Seats reserved for Technocrats and Ulema. The Members of the National Assembly are elected for a term of 5 years whereas the Members of the Senate are elected for a term of 6 years with staggered elections every 3 years

The Parliament of Pakistan – viz the Constituent Assembly of Pakistan – met on 10 August 1947 in the old Sindh Assembly Building at Karachi. It was in this venue that the Objectives Resolution, which now serves as the Grundnorm of Pakistan, was passed. In 1956, the first Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was adopted in Karachi at the same Sindh Assembly building which also passed as the Parliament of Pakistan. After the adoption of the Second Constitution of 1962, Parliament sessions were arranged both at Dhaka and a newly constructed building (Ayub Hall) at Rawalpindi. The Parliament was unicameral. At the first session of the Parliament at the Ayub Hall, the martial law, imposed in 1958, was revoked. Later, in October, 1966, the Parliament was shifted to Dhaka. From 1972 onward, the State Bank auditorium in Islamabad functioned as the National Assembly of Pakistan. The Interim Constitution of Pakistan was adopted here in April, 1972. It was here that the first bicameral legislature of Pakistan was also born after the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan was adopted in 1973. It was again here that the Martial Law, imposed in July, 1977, was revoked on 30 December 1985. The Parliament – the Senate and the National Assembly – have acquired a permanent abode in the present Parliament House, which was inaugurated on 28 May 1986. The Hall was renovated on the orders of the Speaker and inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan on 3 November 1996.

<text>In linear algebra, a rotation matrix is a transformation matrix that is used to perform a rotation in Euclidean space. For example, using the convention below, the matrix
:formula_1
rotates points in the plane counterclockwise through an angle about the origin of a two-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. To perform the rotation on a plane point with standard coordinates , it should be written as a column vector, and multiplied by the matrix :

:formula_2

If and are the coordinates of the endpoint of a vector with the length &quot;r&quot; and the angle formula_3 with respect to the -axis, so that formula_4 and formula_5, then the above equations become the trigonometric summation angle formulae:formula_6Indeed, this is the trigonometric summation angle formulae in matrix form. One way to understand this is to say we have a vector at an angle 30° from the -axis, and we wish to rotate that angle by a further 45°. We simply need to compute the vector endpoint coordinates at 75°.

The examples in this article apply to &quot;active rotations&quot; of vectors &quot;counterclockwise&quot; in a &quot;right-handed coordinate system&quot; ( counterclockwise from ) by &quot;pre-multiplication&quot; (the rotation matrix applied on the left of the column vector to be rotated). If any one of these is changed (such as rotating axes instead of vectors, a &quot;passive transformation&quot;), then the inverse of the example matrix should be used, which coincides with its transpose.

Since matrix multiplication has no effect on the zero vector (the coordinates of the origin), rotation matrices describe rotations about the origin. Rotation matrices provide an algebraic description of such rotations, and are used extensively for computations in geometry, physics, and computer graphics. In some literature, the term &quot;rotation&quot; is generalized to include improper rotations, characterized by orthogonal matrices with a determinant of −1 (instead of +1). An improper rotation combines a &quot;proper&quot; rotation with &quot;reflections&quot; (which invert orientation). In other cases, where reflections are not being considered, the label &quot;proper&quot; may be dropped. The latter convention is followed in this article.

Rotation matrices are square matrices, with real entries. More specifically, they can be characterized as orthogonal matrices with determinant 1; that is, a square matrix is a rotation matrix if and only if and . The set of all orthogonal matrices of size with determinant +1 is a representation of a group known as the special orthogonal group , one example of which is the rotation group SO(3). The set of all orthogonal matrices of size with determinant +1 or −1 is a representation of the (general) orthogonal group .

==In two dimensions==
In two dimensions, the standard rotation matrix has the following form:
:formula_7

This rotates column vectors by means of the following matrix multiplication,
:formula_8

Thus, the new coordinates of a point after rotation are
:formula_9

=== Examples ===
For example, when the vector
:formula_10
is rotated by an angle , its new coordinates are
:formula_11

and when the vector
:formula_12
is rotated by an angle , its new coordinates are
:formula_13

=== Direction ===
The direction of vector rotation is counterclockwise if is positive (e.g. 90°), and clockwise if is negative (e.g. −90°) for formula_14. Thus the clockwise rotation matrix is found as
:formula_15

The two-dimensional case is the only non-trivial (i.e. not one-dimensional) case where the rotation matrices group is commutative, so that it does not matter in which order multiple rotations are performed. An alternative convention uses rotating axes, and the above matrices also represent a rotation of the &quot;axes clockwise&quot; through an angle .

===Non-standard orientation of the coordinate system===
If a standard right-handed Cartesian coordinate system is used, with the to the right and the up, the rotation is counterclockwise. If a left-handed Cartesian coordinate system is used, with directed to the right but directed down, is clockwise. Such non-standard orientations are rarely used in mathematics but are common in 2D computer graphics, which often have the origin in the top left corner and the down the screen or page.

See below for other alternative conventions which may change the sense of the rotation produced by a rotation matrix.

===Common 2D rotations===
Particularly useful are the matrices
:formula_16
for 90°, 180°, and 270° counter-clockwise rotations.


===Relationship with complex plane===
Since
:formula_17
the matrices of the shape
:formula_18
form a ring isomorphic to the field of the complex numbers . Under this isomorphism, the rotation matrices correspond to circle of the unit complex numbers, the complex numbers of modulus .

If one identifies formula_19 with formula_20 through the linear isomorphism formula_21 the action of a matrix of the above form on vectors of formula_19 corresponds to the multiplication by the complex number , and rotations correspond to multiplication by complex numbers of modulus .

As every rotation matrix can be written
:formula_23
the above correspondence associates such a matrix with the complex number
:formula_24
(this last equality is Euler&#x27;s formula).

==In three dimensions==


===Basic 3D rotations===

A basic 3D rotation (also called elemental rotation) is a rotation about one of the axes of a coordinate system. The following three basic rotation matrices rotate vectors by an angle about the -, -, or -axis, in three dimensions, using the right-hand rule—which codifies their alternating signs. Notice that the right-hand rule only works when multiplying formula_25. (The same matrices can also represent a clockwise rotation of the axes.)

:formula_26

For column vectors, each of these basic vector rotations appears counterclockwise when the axis about which they occur points toward the observer, the coordinate system is right-handed, and the angle is positive. , for instance, would rotate toward the a vector aligned with the , as can easily be checked by operating with on the vector :
:formula_27

This is similar to the rotation produced by the above-mentioned two-dimensional rotation matrix. See below for alternative conventions which may apparently or actually invert the sense of the rotation produced by these matrices.

===General 3D rotations===

Other 3D rotation matrices can be obtained from these three using matrix multiplication. For example, the product
:formula_28

represents a rotation whose yaw, pitch, and roll angles are , and , respectively. More formally, it is an intrinsic rotation whose Tait–Bryan angles are , , , about axes , , , respectively.
Similarly, the product
:formula_29
represents an extrinsic rotation whose (improper) Euler angles are , , , about axes , , .

These matrices produce the desired effect only if they are used to premultiply column vectors, and (since in general matrix multiplication is not commutative) only if they are applied in the specified order (see Ambiguities for more details). The order of rotation operations is from right to left; the matrix adjacent to the column vector is the first to be applied, and then the one to the left.

===Conversion from rotation matrix to axis–angle=== 
Every rotation in three dimensions is defined by its axis (a vector along this axis is unchanged by the rotation), and its angle — the amount of rotation about that axis (Euler rotation theorem).

There are several methods to compute the axis and angle from a rotation matrix (see also axis–angle representation). Here, we only describe the method based on the computation of the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the rotation matrix. It is also possible to use the trace of the rotation matrix.

====Determining the axis====
Given a rotation matrix , a vector parallel to the rotation axis must satisfy
:formula_30
since the rotation of around the rotation axis must result in . The equation above may be solved for which is unique up to a scalar factor unless .

Further, the equation may be rewritten
:formula_31
which shows that lies in the null space of .

Viewed in another way, is an eigenvector of corresponding to the eigenvalue . Every rotation matrix must have this eigenvalue, the other two eigenvalues being complex conjugates of each other. It follows that a general rotation matrix in three dimensions has, up to a multiplicative constant, only one real eigenvector.

One way to determine the rotation axis is by showing that:

:formula_32

Since is a skew-symmetric matrix, we can choose such that
:formula_33
The matrix–vector product becomes a cross product of a vector with itself, ensuring that the result is zero:

:formula_34

Therefore, if
:formula_35
then
:formula_36
The magnitude of computed this way is , where is the angle of rotation.

This does not work if is symmetric. Above, if is zero, then all subsequent steps are invalid. In this case, it is necessary to diagonalize and find the eigenvector corresponding to an eigenvalue of 1.

====Determining the angle====
To find the angle of a rotation, once the axis of the rotation is known, select a vector perpendicular to the axis. Then the angle of the rotation is the angle between and .

A more direct method, however, is to simply calculate the trace: the sum of the diagonal elements of the rotation matrix. Care should be taken to select the right sign for the angle to match the chosen axis:
:formula_37

from which follows that the angle&#x27;s absolute value is
:formula_38

For the rotation axis formula_39, you can get the correct angle from

formula_40

where

formula_41

====Rotation matrix from axis and angle====
The matrix of a proper rotation by angle around the axis , a unit vector with , is given by:

:formula_42

A derivation of this matrix from first principles can be found in section 9.2 here. The basic idea to derive this matrix is dividing the problem into few known simple steps.

# First rotate the given axis and the point such that the axis lies in one of the coordinate planes (, or )
# Then rotate the given axis and the point such that the axis is aligned with one of the two coordinate axes for that particular coordinate plane (, or )
# Use one of the fundamental rotation matrices to rotate the point depending on the coordinate axis with which the rotation axis is aligned.
# Reverse rotate the axis-point pair such that it attains the final configuration as that was in step 2 (Undoing step 2)
# Reverse rotate the axis-point pair which was done in step 1 (undoing step 1)

This can be written more concisely as 

:formula_43
where is the cross product matrix of ; the expression is the outer product, and is the identity matrix. Alternatively, the matrix entries are:
:formula_44

where is the Levi-Civita symbol with . This is a matrix form of Rodrigues&#x27; rotation formula, (or the equivalent, differently parametrized Euler–Rodrigues formula) with

:formula_45

In formula_46 the rotation of a vector around the axis by an angle can be written as:
:formula_47

or equivalently:
:formula_48

This can also be written in tensor notation as:
:formula_49

If the 3D space is right-handed and , this rotation will be counterclockwise when points towards the observer (Right-hand rule). Explicitly, with formula_50 a right-handed orthonormal basis,
:formula_51

Note the striking &quot;merely apparent differences&quot; to the &quot;equivalent&quot; Lie-algebraic formulation below.

== Properties ==
For any -dimensional rotation matrix acting on formula_52
: formula_53 (The rotation is an orthogonal matrix)
It follows that:
: formula_54

A rotation is termed proper if , and improper (or a roto-reflection) if . For even dimensions , the eigenvalues of a proper rotation occur as pairs of complex conjugates which are roots of unity: for , which is real only for . Therefore, there may be no vectors fixed by the rotation (), and thus no axis of rotation. Any fixed eigenvectors occur in pairs, and the axis of rotation is an even-dimensional subspace.

For odd dimensions , a proper rotation will have an odd number of eigenvalues, with at least one and the axis of rotation will be an odd dimensional subspace. Proof:
:formula_55

Here is the identity matrix, and we use , as well as since is odd. Therefore, , meaning there is a nonzero vector with , that is , a fixed eigenvector. There may also be pairs of fixed eigenvectors in the even-dimensional subspace orthogonal to , so the total dimension of fixed eigenvectors is odd.

For example, in 2-space , a rotation by angle has eigenvalues and , so there is no axis of rotation except when , the case of the null rotation. In 3-space , the axis of a non-null proper rotation is always a unique line, and a rotation around this axis by angle has eigenvalues . In 4-space , the four eigenvalues are of the form . The null rotation has . The case of is called a &quot;simple rotation&quot;, with two unit eigenvalues forming an &quot;axis plane&quot;, and a two-dimensional rotation orthogonal to the axis plane. Otherwise, there is no axis plane. The case of is called an &quot;isoclinic rotation&quot;, having eigenvalues repeated twice, so every vector is rotated through an angle .

The trace of a rotation matrix is equal to the sum of its eigenvalues. For , a rotation by angle has trace . For , a rotation around any axis by angle has trace . For , and the trace is , which becomes for an isoclinic rotation.

== Geometry ==
In Euclidean geometry, a rotation is an example of an isometry, a transformation that moves points without changing the distances between them. Rotations are distinguished from other isometries by two additional properties: they leave (at least) one point fixed, and they leave &quot;handedness&quot; unchanged. In contrast, a translation moves every point, a reflection exchanges left- and right-handed ordering, a glide reflection does both, and an improper rotation combines a change in handedness with a normal rotation.

If a fixed point is taken as the origin of a Cartesian coordinate system, then every point can be given coordinates as a displacement from the origin. Thus one may work with the vector space of displacements instead of the points themselves. Now suppose are the coordinates of the vector from the origin to point . Choose an orthonormal basis for our coordinates; then the squared distance to , by Pythagoras, is
:formula_65
which can be computed using the matrix multiplication
:formula_66

A geometric rotation transforms lines to lines, and preserves ratios of distances between points. From these properties it can be shown that a rotation is a linear transformation of the vectors, and thus can be written in matrix form, . The fact that a rotation preserves, not just ratios, but distances themselves, is stated as
:formula_67
or
:formula_68
Because this equation holds for all vectors, , one concludes that every rotation matrix, , satisfies the orthogonality condition,
:formula_69
Rotations preserve handedness because they cannot change the ordering of the axes, which implies the special matrix condition,
:formula_70
Equally important, it can be shown that any matrix satisfying these two conditions acts as a rotation.

== Multiplication ==
The inverse of a rotation matrix is its transpose, which is also a rotation matrix:
:formula_71
The product of two rotation matrices is a rotation matrix:
:formula_72
For , multiplication of rotation matrices is generally not commutative.
:formula_73
Noting that any identity matrix is a rotation matrix, and that matrix multiplication is associative, we may summarize all these properties by saying that the rotation matrices form a group, which for is non-abelian, called a special orthogonal group, and denoted by , , , or , the group of rotation matrices is isomorphic to the group of rotations in an space. This means that multiplication of rotation matrices corresponds to composition of rotations, applied in left-to-right order of their corresponding matrices.

== Ambiguities ==

The interpretation of a rotation matrix can be subject to many ambiguities.

In most cases the effect of the ambiguity is equivalent to the effect of a rotation matrix inversion (for these orthogonal matrices equivalently matrix transpose).

; Alias or alibi (passive or active) transformation
: The coordinates of a point may change due to either a rotation of the coordinate system (alias), or a rotation of the point (alibi). In the latter case, the rotation of also produces a rotation of the vector representing . In other words, either and are fixed while rotates (alias), or is fixed while and rotate (alibi). Any given rotation can be legitimately described both ways, as vectors and coordinate systems actually rotate with respect to each other, about the same axis but in opposite directions. Throughout this article, we chose the alibi approach to describe rotations. For instance, 
::formula_74
: represents a counterclockwise rotation of a vector by an angle , or a rotation of by the same angle but in the opposite direction (i.e. clockwise). Alibi and alias transformations are also known as active and passive transformations, respectively.
; Pre-multiplication or post-multiplication
: The same point can be represented either by a column vector or a row vector . Rotation matrices can either pre-multiply column vectors (), or post-multiply row vectors (). However, produces a rotation in the opposite direction with respect to . Throughout this article, rotations produced on column vectors are described by means of a pre-multiplication. To obtain exactly the same rotation (i.e. the same final coordinates of point ), the equivalent row vector must be post-multiplied by the transpose of (i.e. ).
; Right- or left-handed coordinates
: The matrix and the vector can be represented with respect to a right-handed or left-handed coordinate system. Throughout the article, we assumed a right-handed orientation, unless otherwise specified.
; Vectors or forms
: The vector space has a dual space of linear forms, and the matrix can act on either vectors or forms.

== Decompositions ==

=== Independent planes ===
Consider the rotation matrix
:formula_75
If acts in a certain direction, , purely as a scaling by a factor , then we have
:formula_76
so that
:formula_77
Thus is a root of the characteristic polynomial for ,
:formula_78
Two features are noteworthy. First, one of the roots (or eigenvalues) is 1, which tells us that some direction is unaffected by the matrix. For rotations in three dimensions, this is the &quot;axis&quot; of the rotation (a concept that has no meaning in any other dimension). Second, the other two roots are a pair of complex conjugates, whose product is 1 (the constant term of the quadratic), and whose sum is (the negated linear term). This factorization is of interest for rotation matrices because the same thing occurs for all of them. (As special cases, for a null rotation the &quot;complex conjugates&quot; are both 1, and for a 180° rotation they are both −1.) Furthermore, a similar factorization holds for any rotation matrix. If the dimension, , is odd, there will be a &quot;dangling&quot; eigenvalue of 1; and for any dimension the rest of the polynomial factors into quadratic terms like the one here (with the two special cases noted). We are guaranteed that the characteristic polynomial will have degree and thus eigenvalues. And since a rotation matrix commutes with its transpose, it is a normal matrix, so can be diagonalized. We conclude that every rotation matrix, when expressed in a suitable coordinate system, partitions into independent rotations of two-dimensional subspaces, at most of them.

The sum of the entries on the main diagonal of a matrix is called the trace; it does not change if we reorient the coordinate system, and always equals the sum of the eigenvalues. This has the convenient implication for and rotation matrices that the trace reveals the angle of rotation, , in the two-dimensional space (or subspace). For a matrix the trace is , and for a matrix it is . In the three-dimensional case, the subspace consists of all vectors perpendicular to the rotation axis (the invariant direction, with eigenvalue 1). Thus we can extract from any rotation matrix a rotation axis and an angle, and these completely determine the rotation.

=== Sequential angles ===
The constraints on a rotation matrix imply that it must have the form
:formula_79
with . Therefore, we may set and , for some angle . To solve for it is not enough to look at alone or alone; we must consider both together to place the angle in the correct quadrant, using a two-argument arctangent function.

Now consider the first column of a rotation matrix,
:formula_80
Although will probably not equal 1, but some value , we can use a slight variation of the previous computation to find a so-called Givens rotation that transforms the column to
:formula_81
zeroing . This acts on the subspace spanned by the - and -axes. We can then repeat the process for the -subspace to zero . Acting on the full matrix, these two rotations produce the schematic form
:formula_82
Shifting attention to the second column, a Givens rotation of the -subspace can now zero the value. This brings the full matrix to the form
:formula_83
which is an identity matrix. Thus we have decomposed as
:formula_84

An rotation matrix will have , or
:formula_85
entries below the diagonal to zero. We can zero them by extending the same idea of stepping through the columns with a series of rotations in a fixed sequence of planes. We conclude that the set of rotation matrices, each of which has entries, can be parameterized by angles.
In three dimensions this restates in matrix form an observation made by Euler, so mathematicians call the ordered sequence of three angles Euler angles. However, the situation is somewhat more complicated than we have so far indicated. Despite the small dimension, we actually have considerable freedom in the sequence of axis pairs we use; and we also have some freedom in the choice of angles. Thus we find many different conventions employed when three-dimensional rotations are parameterized for physics, or medicine, or chemistry, or other disciplines. When we include the option of world axes or body axes, 24 different sequences are possible. And while some disciplines call any sequence Euler angles, others give different names (Cardano, Tait–Bryan, roll-pitch-yaw) to different sequences.

One reason for the large number of options is that, as noted previously, rotations in three dimensions (and higher) do not commute. If we reverse a given sequence of rotations, we get a different outcome. This also implies that we cannot compose two rotations by adding their corresponding angles. Thus Euler angles are not vectors, despite a similarity in appearance as a triplet of numbers.

=== Nested dimensions ===
A rotation matrix such as
:formula_86

suggests a rotation matrix,
:formula_87

is embedded in the upper left corner:
:formula_88

This is no illusion; not just one, but many, copies of -dimensional rotations are found within -dimensional rotations, as subgroups. Each embedding leaves one direction fixed, which in the case of matrices is the rotation axis. For example, we have
:formula_89

fixing the -axis, the -axis, and the -axis, respectively. The rotation axis need not be a coordinate axis; if is a unit vector in the desired direction, then
:formula_90

where , , is a rotation by angle leaving axis fixed.

A direction in -dimensional space will be a unit magnitude vector, which we may consider a point on a generalized sphere, . Thus it is natural to describe the rotation group as combining and . A suitable formalism is the fiber bundle,
:formula_91

where for every direction in the base space, , the fiber over it in the total space, , is a copy of the fiber space, , namely the rotations that keep that direction fixed.

Thus we can build an rotation matrix by starting with a matrix, aiming its fixed axis on (the ordinary sphere in three-dimensional space), aiming the resulting rotation on , and so on up through . A point on can be selected using numbers, so we again have numbers to describe any rotation matrix.

In fact, we can view the sequential angle decomposition, discussed previously, as reversing this process. The composition of Givens rotations brings the first column (and row) to , so that the remainder of the matrix is a rotation matrix of dimension one less, embedded so as to leave fixed.

=== Skew parameters via Cayley&#x27;s formula ===

When an rotation matrix , does not include a −1 eigenvalue, thus none of the planar rotations which it comprises are 180° rotations, then is an invertible matrix. Most rotation matrices fit this description, and for them it can be shown that is a skew-symmetric matrix, . Thus ; and since the diagonal is necessarily zero, and since the upper triangle determines the lower one, contains independent numbers.

Conveniently, is invertible whenever is skew-symmetric; thus we can recover the original matrix using the &quot;Cayley transform&quot;,
:formula_92
which maps any skew-symmetric matrix to a rotation matrix. In fact, aside from the noted exceptions, we can produce any rotation matrix in this way. Although in practical applications we can hardly afford to ignore 180° rotations, the Cayley transform is still a potentially useful tool, giving a parameterization of most rotation matrices without trigonometric functions.

In three dimensions, for example, we have 
:formula_93

If we condense the skew entries into a vector, , then we produce a 90° rotation around the -axis for (1, 0, 0), around the -axis for (0, 1, 0), and around the -axis for (0, 0, 1). The 180° rotations are just out of reach; for, in the limit as , does approach a 180° rotation around the axis, and similarly for other directions.

=== Decomposition into shears ===

For the 2D case, a rotation matrix can be decomposed into three shear matrices ():

:formula_94

This is useful, for instance, in computer graphics, since shears can be implemented with fewer multiplication instructions than rotating a bitmap directly. On modern computers, this may not matter, but it can be relevant for very old or low-end microprocessors.

A rotation can also be written as two shears and scaling ():

:formula_95

== Group theory ==
Below follow some basic facts about the role of the collection of &quot;all&quot; rotation matrices of a fixed dimension (here mostly 3) in mathematics and particularly in physics where rotational symmetry is a &quot;requirement&quot; of every truly fundamental law (due to the assumption of isotropy of space), and where the same symmetry, when present, is a &quot;simplifying property&quot; of many problems of less fundamental nature. Examples abound in classical mechanics and quantum mechanics. Knowledge of the part of the solutions pertaining to this symmetry applies (with qualifications) to &quot;all&quot; such problems and it can be factored out of a specific problem at hand, thus reducing its complexity. A prime example – in mathematics and physics – would be the theory of spherical harmonics. Their role in the group theory of the rotation groups is that of being a representation space for the entire set of finite-dimensional irreducible representations of the rotation group SO(3). For this topic, see Rotation group SO(3) § Spherical harmonics.

The main articles listed in each subsection are referred to for more detail.

=== Lie group ===

The rotation matrices for each form a group, the special orthogonal group, . This algebraic structure is coupled with a topological structure inherited from formula_96 in such a way that the operations of multiplication and taking the inverse are analytic functions of the matrix entries. Thus is for each a Lie group. It is compact and connected, but not simply connected. It is also a semi-simple group, in fact a simple group with the exception SO(4). The relevance of this is that all theorems and all machinery from the theory of analytic manifolds (analytic manifolds are in particular smooth manifolds) apply and the well-developed representation theory of compact semi-simple groups is ready for use.

=== Lie algebra ===

The Lie algebra of is given by
:formula_97
and is the space of skew-symmetric matrices of dimension , see classical group, where is the Lie algebra of , the orthogonal group. For reference, the most common basis for is
:formula_98

=== Exponential map ===

Connecting the Lie algebra to the Lie group is the exponential map, which is defined using the standard matrix exponential series for For any skew-symmetric matrix , is always a rotation matrix.

An important practical example is the case. In rotation group SO(3), it is shown that one can identify every with an Euler vector , where is a unit magnitude vector.

By the properties of the identification formula_99, is in the null space of . Thus, is left invariant by and is hence a rotation axis.

According to Rodrigues&#x27; rotation formula on matrix form, one obtains,

:formula_100

where
: formula_101

This is the matrix for a rotation around axis by the angle . For full detail, see exponential map SO(3).

=== Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula ===

The BCH formula provides an explicit expression for in terms of a series expansion of nested commutators of and . This general expansion unfolds as
:formula_102

In the case, the general infinite expansion has a compact form,
:formula_103
for suitable trigonometric function coefficients, detailed in the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula for SO(3).

As a group identity, the above holds for &quot;all faithful representations&quot;, including the doublet (spinor representation), which is simpler. The same explicit formula thus follows straightforwardly through Pauli matrices; see the derivation for SU(2). For the general case, one might use Ref.

=== Spin group ===

The Lie group of rotation matrices, , is not simply connected, so Lie theory tells us it is a homomorphic image of a universal covering group. Often the covering group, which in this case is called the spin group denoted by , is simpler and more natural to work with.

In the case of planar rotations, SO(2) is topologically a circle, . Its universal covering group, Spin(2), is isomorphic to the real line, , under addition. Whenever angles of arbitrary magnitude are used one is taking advantage of the convenience of the universal cover. Every rotation matrix is produced by a countable infinity of angles, separated by integer multiples of 2. Correspondingly, the fundamental group of is isomorphic to the integers, .

In the case of spatial rotations, SO(3) is topologically equivalent to three-dimensional real projective space, . Its universal covering group, Spin(3), is isomorphic to the , . Every rotation matrix is produced by two opposite points on the sphere. Correspondingly, the fundamental group of SO(3) is isomorphic to the two-element group, .

We can also describe Spin(3) as isomorphic to quaternions of unit norm under multiplication, or to certain real matrices, or to complex special unitary matrices, namely SU(2). The covering maps for the first and the last case are given by
:formula_104
and
:formula_105

For a detailed account of the and the quaternionic covering, see spin group SO(3).

Many features of these cases are the same for higher dimensions. The coverings are all two-to-one, with , , having fundamental group . The natural setting for these groups is within a Clifford algebra. One type of action of the rotations is produced by a kind of &quot;sandwich&quot;, denoted by . More importantly in applications to physics, the corresponding spin representation of the Lie algebra sits inside the Clifford algebra. It can be exponentiated in the usual way to give rise to a representation, also known as projective representation of the rotation group. This is the case with SO(3) and SU(2), where the representation can be viewed as an &quot;inverse&quot; of the covering map. By properties of covering maps, the inverse can be chosen ono-to-one as a local section, but not globally.

=== Infinitesimal rotations ===

The matrices in the Lie algebra are not themselves rotations; the skew-symmetric matrices are derivatives, proportional differences of rotations. An actual &quot;differential rotation&quot;, or &quot;infinitesimal rotation matrix&quot; has the form
:formula_106
where is vanishingly small and , for instance with ,
:formula_107

The computation rules are as usual except that infinitesimals of second order are routinely dropped. With these rules, these matrices do not satisfy all the same properties as ordinary finite rotation matrices under the usual treatment of infinitesimals. It turns out that &quot;the order in which infinitesimal rotations are applied is irrelevant&quot;. To see this exemplified, consult infinitesimal rotations SO(3).

== Conversions ==

We have seen the existence of several decompositions that apply in any dimension, namely independent planes, sequential angles, and nested dimensions. In all these cases we can either decompose a matrix or construct one. We have also given special attention to rotation matrices, and these warrant further attention, in both directions .

=== Quaternion ===
Given the unit quaternion , the equivalent pre-multiplied (to be used with column vectors) rotation matrix is 
:formula_108

Now every quaternion component appears multiplied by two in a term of degree two, and if all such terms are zero what is left is an identity matrix. This leads to an efficient, robust conversion from any quaternion – whether unit or non-unit – to a rotation matrix. Given:
:formula_109
we can calculate
:formula_110
Freed from the demand for a unit quaternion, we find that nonzero quaternions act as homogeneous coordinates for rotation matrices. The Cayley transform, discussed earlier, is obtained by scaling the quaternion so that its component is 1. For a 180° rotation around any axis, will be zero, which explains the Cayley limitation.

The sum of the entries along the main diagonal (the trace), plus one, equals , which is . Thus we can write the trace itself as ; and from the previous version of the matrix we see that the diagonal entries themselves have the same form: , , and . So we can easily compare the magnitudes of all four quaternion components using the matrix diagonal. We can, in fact, obtain all four magnitudes using sums and square roots, and choose consistent signs using the skew-symmetric part of the off-diagonal entries:
:formula_111

Alternatively, use a single square root and division
:formula_112

This is numerically stable so long as the trace, , is not negative; otherwise, we risk dividing by (nearly) zero. In that case, suppose is the largest diagonal entry, so will have the largest magnitude (the other cases are derived by cyclic permutation); then the following is safe.
:formula_113

If the matrix contains significant error, such as accumulated numerical error, we may construct a symmetric matrix,
:formula_114
and find the eigenvector, , of its largest magnitude eigenvalue. (If is truly a rotation matrix, that value will be 1.) The quaternion so obtained will correspond to the rotation matrix closest to the given matrix (Note: formulation of the cited article is post-multiplied, works with row vectors).

=== Polar decomposition ===
If the matrix is nonsingular, its columns are linearly independent vectors; thus the Gram–Schmidt process can adjust them to be an orthonormal basis. Stated in terms of numerical linear algebra, we convert to an orthogonal matrix, , using QR decomposition. However, we often prefer a closest to , which this method does not accomplish. For that, the tool we want is the polar decomposition (; ).

To measure closeness, we may use any matrix norm invariant under orthogonal transformations. A convenient choice is the Frobenius norm, , squared, which is the sum of the squares of the element differences. Writing this in terms of the trace, , our goal is,
: Find minimizing , subject to .

Though written in matrix terms, the objective function is just a quadratic polynomial. We can minimize it in the usual way, by finding where its derivative is zero. For a matrix, the orthogonality constraint implies six scalar equalities that the entries of must satisfy. To incorporate the constraint(s), we may employ a standard technique, Lagrange multipliers, assembled as a symmetric matrix, . Thus our method is:
: Differentiate with respect to (the entries of) , and equate to zero.
Consider a example. Including constraints, we seek to minimize
:formula_115

Taking the derivative with respect to , , , in turn, we assemble a matrix.
:formula_116

In general, we obtain the equation
:formula_117
so that
:formula_118
where is orthogonal and is symmetric. To ensure a minimum, the matrix (and hence ) must be positive definite. Linear algebra calls the polar decomposition of , with the positive square root of .
:formula_119

When is non-singular, the and factors of the polar decomposition are uniquely determined. However, the determinant of is positive because is positive definite, so inherits the sign of the determinant of . That is, is only guaranteed to be orthogonal, not a rotation matrix. This is unavoidable; an with negative determinant has no uniquely defined closest rotation matrix.

=== Axis and angle ===

To efficiently construct a rotation matrix from an angle and a unit axis , we can take advantage of symmetry and skew-symmetry within the entries. If , , and are the components of the unit vector representing the axis, and

:formula_120

then

:formula_121

Determining an axis and angle, like determining a quaternion, is only possible up to the sign; that is, and correspond to the same rotation matrix, just like and . Additionally, axis–angle extraction presents additional difficulties. The angle can be restricted to be from 0° to 180°, but angles are formally ambiguous by multiples of 360°. When the angle is zero, the axis is undefined. When the angle is 180°, the matrix becomes symmetric, which has implications in extracting the axis. Near multiples of 180°, care is needed to avoid numerical problems: in extracting the angle, a two-argument arctangent with equal to avoids the insensitivity of arccos; and in computing the axis magnitude in order to force unit magnitude, a brute-force approach can lose accuracy through underflow .

A partial approach is as follows:

:formula_122

The -, -, and -components of the axis would then be divided by . A fully robust approach will use a different algorithm when , the trace of the matrix , is negative, as with quaternion extraction. When is zero because the angle is zero, an axis must be provided from some source other than the matrix.

=== Euler angles ===
Complexity of conversion escalates with Euler angles (used here in the broad sense). The first difficulty is to establish which of the twenty-four variations of Cartesian axis order we will use. Suppose the three angles are , , ; physics and chemistry may interpret these as

:formula_123

while aircraft dynamics may use
:formula_124
One systematic approach begins with choosing the rightmost axis. Among all permutations of , only two place that axis first; one is an even permutation and the other odd. Choosing parity thus establishes the middle axis. That leaves two choices for the left-most axis, either duplicating the first or not. These three choices gives us variations; we double that to 24 by choosing static or rotating axes.

This is enough to construct a matrix from angles, but triples differing in many ways can give the same rotation matrix. For example, suppose we use the convention above; then we have the following equivalent pairs:
Angles for any order can be found using a concise common routine (; ).

The problem of singular alignment, the mathematical analog of physical gimbal lock, occurs when the middle rotation aligns the axes of the first and last rotations. It afflicts every axis order at either even or odd multiples of 90°. These singularities are not characteristic of the rotation matrix as such, and only occur with the usage of Euler angles.

The singularities are avoided when considering and manipulating the rotation matrix as orthonormal row vectors (in 3D applications often named the right-vector, up-vector and out-vector) instead of as angles. The singularities are also avoided when working with quaternions.

=== Vector to vector formulation ===
In some instances it is interesting to describe a rotation by specifying how a vector is mapped into another through the shortest path (smallest angle). In formula_46 this completely describes the associated rotation matrix. In general, given , the matrix
:formula_126
belongs to and maps to .

== Uniform random rotation matrices ==
We sometimes need to generate a uniformly distributed random rotation matrix. It seems intuitively clear in two dimensions that this means the rotation angle is uniformly distributed between 0 and 2. That intuition is correct, but does not carry over to higher dimensions. For example, if we decompose rotation matrices in axis–angle form, the angle should &quot;not&quot; be uniformly distributed; the probability that (the magnitude of) the angle is at most should be , for .

Since is a connected and locally compact Lie group, we have a simple standard criterion for uniformity, namely that the distribution be unchanged when composed with any arbitrary rotation (a Lie group &quot;translation&quot;). This definition corresponds to what is called &quot;Haar measure&quot;. show how to use the Cayley transform to generate and test matrices according to this criterion.

We can also generate a uniform distribution in any dimension using the &quot;subgroup algorithm&quot; of . This recursively exploits the nested dimensions group structure of , as follows. Generate a uniform angle and construct a rotation matrix. To step from to , generate a vector uniformly distributed on the -sphere , embed the matrix in the next larger size with last column , and rotate the larger matrix so the last column becomes .

As usual, we have special alternatives for the case. Each of these methods begins with three independent random scalars uniformly distributed on the unit interval. takes advantage of the odd dimension to change a Householder reflection to a rotation by negation, and uses that to aim the axis of a uniform planar rotation.

Another method uses unit quaternions. Multiplication of rotation matrices is homomorphic to multiplication of quaternions, and multiplication by a unit quaternion rotates the unit sphere. Since the homomorphism is a local isometry, we immediately conclude that to produce a uniform distribution on SO(3) we may use a uniform distribution on . In practice: create a four-element vector where each element is a sampling of a normal distribution. Normalize its length and you have a uniformly sampled random unit quaternion which represents a uniformly sampled random rotation. Note that the aforementioned only applies to rotations in dimension 3. For a generalised idea of quaternions, one should look into Rotors.

Euler angles can also be used, though not with each angle uniformly distributed (; ).

For the axis–angle form, the axis is uniformly distributed over the unit sphere of directions, , while the angle has the nonuniform distribution over noted previously .

<text>Kincsem (; Hungarian for &quot;My Precious&quot; or &quot;My Treasure&quot;; March 17, 1874 – March 16, 1887) was a Hungarian Thoroughbred racehorse who has the longest undefeated record of any racehorse after winning all of her 54 races. The next closest in this regard is Black Caviar, who won all her 25 races. Foaled in Kisbér, Hungary in 1874, Kincsem is a national icon and widely considered one of the top racehorses of the 19th century.

Over four seasons, Kincsem won against both female and male company at various race tracks across Europe, including multiple Classic race victories in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. She also raced frequently in Germany, winning the Grosser Preis von Baden three times. In her four-year-old campaign, she traveled to England to win the Goodwood Cup, then won the Grand Prix de Deauville in France.

As a broodmare, Kincsem produced just five foals, one of which died young. Nevertheless, two of her foals became Classic winners and her daughters also proved to be outstanding producers. Her family has proved a lasting influence on the breed, with modern descendants including English Classic winners Polygamy and Camelot.

==Background==
Kincsem was bred at the stud of Ernő Blaskovich at Tápiószentmárton, in The Hungarian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Her sire, Cambuscan, was bred by Queen Victoria and in 1864 went on to win the July Stakes and place in the St. Leger Stakes. He was sold to Hungarian interests and was brought to stand at the Hungarian National Stud in the Kisbér District in 1873. Cambuscan was by Newminster, while his dam, The Arrow, was by Slane. Kincsem was out of the Hungarian mare Waternymph, a daughter of the English horse Cotswold. Kincsem&#x27;s third dam, Seaweed was also by Slane, making Kincsem inbred to him in the third and fourth generations (3x4).

At that time, there were thieves in Hungary called betyars who stole cattle and horses. One night they tried to steal horses from an open summer stable of Blaskovich that had only a crossbar through the door. They made a noise, so stable staff chased them away and the horses, including Waternymph, were saved. This legend was later distorted and attributed to Kincsem, who in the new version was allegedly stolen by wandering Gypsies and later returned to her owner.

Kincsem was once offered for sale as part of a package deal with six other yearlings for £700. However, she and one other filly were rejected by the buyer, Baron Alex Orczy, who felt they were of inferior quality. Kincsem thus raced for Blaskovich as a homebred. She was trained by Englishman Robert Hesp and ridden in most of her starts by Englishman Elijah Madden. Kincsem was devoted to her groom, who traveled with her everywhere and was subsequently known as Frankie Kincsem.
Kincsem was a liver chestnut without any white markings who stood high at maturity. Despite Kincsem&#x27;s talent, she was faulted throughout her racing career for her plain looks and lengthy frame. B.K. Beckwith, author of &quot;Step and Go Together&quot;, wrote, &quot;She was as long as a boat and as lean as a hungry leopard ... she had a U-neck and mule ears ... she was lazy, gangly, shiftless ... she was a daisy-eating, scenery-loving, sleepy-eyed and slightly pot-bellied hussy.&quot; However, this contradicts her description in horseracing newspaper Sportblatt from 8 April 1876: &quot;The chestnut mare by Cambuscan from the Waternymph looks most like a racehorse. She is over and over full of quality, long and deep, stands on dry, strong, flawless legs and shows herself to great advantage in a fast gallop. We think we are not mistaken in expressing the view that [she] is destined to play an excellent role on the racetrack.&quot;

Kincsem was noted for her quirky personality, though some details may have become exaggerated over time. For example, a legend claims that she always traveled with a cat and might not move if separated from it. A painting shows her with a cat that some sources name Csalogány (nightingale). Contemporary sources make no mention of the cat but many articles of Sportblatt refer to her traveling with a &quot;horse&quot; named Csalogany. During Kincsem&#x27;s extensive travels, all her hay and grain came from Blaskovich&#x27;s stud farm (then an unusual arrangement), and she refused to eat anything else. She was also particular about the quality of the water she drank. On one occasion at Baden-Baden, the water ran out and she refused to drink for two days until a suitable substitute was found at what was subsequently known as Kincsem&#x27;s Well.

==Racing career==
===1876: Two-year-old season===

Another legend, used in the Hungarian movie Kincsem, speculates that Kincsem started her career in Germany because Blaskovich was ashamed of her, but the real reason was a summer break on Austrian and Hungarian racetracks. During the three-month break, Austrian and Hungarian stables traveled to German racetracks with their best horses, particularly the two-year-olds who did not have races in Austria-Hungary until September. Trainer Robert Hesp traveled to the Berlin with some of his horses and the first to start was Csalogany, who won easily at odds of 3–2. Kincsem made her debut three days later on 21 June and beat three German horses by 4 lengths as the 1/3 odds-on favourite.

The next stop was Hannover, where on 1 July Csalogany won the Zukunfts-Rennen by 1 length in front of the Austro-Hungarian colt Hamburg. On the next day, Kincsem won the Vergleichspreis also by 1 length with Hamburg in second. Third was a three-year-old, Double Zero, who would later win the Deutsches Derby. On 3 July, Csalogany added another victory and the expedition continued to Hamburg. On 9 July, Kincsem won the Hamburger Criterium by lengths ahead of the German filly Adelaide and colt Hamburg. Csalogany ran two races in three days in Hamburg, winning the Vergleichs-Rennen ahead of the filly Little Luder. She was subsequently beaten by the great four-year-old colt Basnas in Pokal and got a break.

Kincsem added three more victories in Germany, beating the Austro-Hungarian colt Blücher by lengths at the Royal Meeting in Bad Doberan and German filly Regimentstochter by 10 lengths in a match race in the Louisa Rennen in Frankfurt. Her sixth victory came on 31 August in the Zukunfts-Rennen (Zukunftspreis that time) in Baden Baden, where she beat her stablemate Criterium by 2 lengths.

The stable then returned to Hungary for the fall campaign. On 2 October, Kincsem showed her best two-year-old form when beating Little Luder in the Polgárok dija in Sopron by a huge margin. The Hungarian horseracing newspaper &quot;Vadász- és Versenylap&quot; reported that she won by 15 to 20 lengths. A description of Kincsem was published after the race in &quot;Sportblatt&quot;: &quot;Despite the fact that this two-year-old filly measures , all her limbs are built perfectly proportionally and impress with their regularity and colossal strength, in which the durability peculiar to the filly &quot;ad oculos&quot; is demonstrated.&quot;

In her next start on 15 October, she met stablemate Csalogany in the Kétévesek versenye in Budapest. Elijah Madden, who had ridden both fillies before, chose to ride Kincsem. The field of ten was the biggest ever faced by Kincsem. &quot;Vadász- és Versenylap&quot; reported that Kincsem and Csalogany left the rest the field behind and fought from halfway head to head, with Kincsem holding off Csalogany by half a length. Little Luder was third. This race is associated with the legend that Kincsem had bad starts. The source of the legend was jockey Robert Smart, who told a story 34 years later that the horses were standing at the starting line but Kincsem stood behind them and grazing. According to Smart, the starter ignored her, let down the flag and she lost 40 meters. Smart probably mistook either the horse or the race involved, because the original race reports never described the bad starts of Kincsem, and the report from this particular race says: &quot;An excellent start, after which the field goes in a bunch...&quot;.

On 22 October, Kincsem stepped up in distance from sprints and won the Kladruber Preis at 1600m in Vienna, beating colts Der Landgraf and Hamburg by 5 lengths. She finished her two-year-old campaign on 29 October by winning the Kladruber Criterium at 1400m in Prague, cantering home lengths in front of Criterium.

Kincsem finished the year with ten victories from ten starts. She and Csalogany were the best two-year-old fillies of Austria-Hungary by earnings. The form of Csalogany subsequently fell and she subsequently won only one race, while traveling with Kincsem as a stable friend and lead horse for training. She was with Kincsem in Newmarket and in Goodwood when she prepared for the Goodwood Cup in 1878, and her Newmarket workouts with Kincsem were reported in &quot;Vadász- és Versenylap&quot;.

===1877: three-year-old season===

Over the winter, Kincsem was made the even-money favourite for the Nemzeti Dij (Hungarian 2000 Guineas) ahead of Csalogany, and was the 2/1 favourite for the Austrian Derby. She was not entered in the Deutsches Derby, in which the 6/1 favourite was Blücher, who had finished second behind her in the Erinnerungsrennen in Doberan.

Both the &quot;world wonder fillies&quot; of trainer Hesp opened the season on 27 April in Bratislava. In the Trial Stakes (Austro-Hungarian 2000 Guineas), Kincsem set the pace and beat Blücher &quot;hands down&quot; by one length in field of eight horses. However, Csalogany shockingly disappointed that day when she finished third behind Pfeil in the Staatspreis (State Prize) at odds of 2/10. Csalogany lost again two days later and both fillies went to Budapest.

A week later, Kincsem won two races in three days. The Nemzeti Dij and Hazafi Dij were recognized as the Hungarian equivalent of 2000 Guineas and 1000 Guineas respectively, but were restricted races at that time to Hungarian-bred horses. In the Nemzeti dij on 6 May, Camillo set the pace, followed by Kincsem and Csalogany. At the halfway point, Kincsem moved to the front, and continued to draw away. She won as she willed ahead of Camillo and Csalogany. The final margin was not disclosed in any available sources from 1877 but the final time has been published - 1:47 for 1600 metres. In the Hazafi dij on 8 May, Kincsem had a fair start but waited behind opponents in a bunched field of six. Halfway through the race, she moved to the front with Bimbo, and then pulled ahead to win easily by lengths in a time of 1:45 with Csalogany unplaced.

After the meeting in Pest, Kincsem along with 11 of Hesp&#x27;s other horses went to the Derby meeting in Vienna. In the Preis des Jockey-Club (Austrian Derby) on 21 May, her main rival would be Tallós, a colt that had finished second in the Criterion Stakes at Newmarket. He was owned by Alexander Baltazzi, who had won the previous year&#x27;s Epsom Derby with Kisber. At the start, Tallós lost several lengths but soon moved close to Kincsem, who waited in third place behind Premier Coup and Pfeil. Before the last turn, Blücher moved to the lead but Kincsem responded. In the 700-meter long straight, Kincsem set a strong pace to the last 200 meters, then cantered home. Her jockey Madden reportedly had the reins in one hand and was patting her with the other. Tallós was second by two lengths, three lengths ahead of Pfeil and Blücher in a field of eight runners, according to the Viennese newspaper &quot;Sportblatt&quot;. The Budapest racing bulletin &quot;Vadász és Versenylap&quot; reported that she won by 10 lengths and that was the biggest discrepancy in her race reports.

Three days later on 24 May, Kincsem dropped back in distance to a mile in the Trial Stakes. She was not herself and Madden had to use the spurs to beat stablemate Vsecko-jedno by 2 lengths. (Note: there were multiple races called Trial Stakes at the time. This particular race was for horses aged three and up, not a classic race. The Austrian equivalent of the 2000 Guineas was the May Trial Stakes in Pressburg, moved to Vienna in 1879. Others Trial Stakes disappear or were renamed.) Just three days later, Kincsem returned to form in the Kaiserpreis over two miles. While carrying 50 kg, she set the pace and won by 10 lengths ahead of her older stablemate Hirnok (69 kg). She ended the spring season with 6 victories in 30 days.

From Vienna, the Austro-Hungarian stables traveled on their usual summer journey through German racecourses. In Berlin, Blaskovich&#x27;s two-year-old Bolygo won the Erstes Criterium, the same race as Kincsem won the previous year. The stable then moved to Hannover, where horses trained by Hesp won four races. Kincsem was entered in the featured race, the Grosser Preis von Hannover, run on 24 June over a distance of 3000 meters. She beat the great Austro-Hungarian mare Konotoppa by 6 lengths with Derby winner Double Zero third in a field of five runners.

Next stop was Hamburg. Kincsem was not entered in the Deutsches Derby (supplementary entries were not allowed at that time), but in the Renard Rennen on 9 July, she beat the Derby winner Pirat by four lengths with Konotoppa far behind. To the credit of Pirat, he ran against the fresh Kincsem the day after a hard battle with Tallos in Derby.

Kincsem was given a rest then returned on 3 September for her first start in the Grosser Preis von Baden over a distance of 3200 metres (roughly 2 miles). The field of three contained no German horses that year, but instead featured another duel between Kincsem and Konotoppa. After a few changes in the lead, Kincsem won unchallenged by three lengths ahead of Konotoppa. Third and last was French horse Mambrin in the colours of Hungarian owner Tassilo Festetics. Five days later, Kincsem demonstrated her class again in the Wäldchens-Preis in Frankfurt. Although heavily eased, she beat Pfeil by 10 lengths, with the sole German runner Schnellläufer 25 lengths behind. Pfeil won 10 races that year and was beaten only twice, finishing third to Kincsem and Tallos in the Austrian Derby and second to Kincsem in Wäldchens-Preis.

Back in Austria-Hungary, Kincsem ran seven races on four racetracks in 25 days. In 19th century racing, prize money was for the two places only with big difference between the winner and runner-up. Walkovers were common because there was no reason to run for second place against big stars. Kincsem earned six victories by walkover and also won a couple of races cantering against her stablemates, who did not challenge her, just running to take the second-place money. She picked up easy money in the Alamidij (City Prize) in Oedenburg (Sopron) on 29 September where she beat her sole opponent, stablemate Prince Gregoire, by three lengths. The next day, she entered a race of the same name and the result was stated as a &quot;compromise&quot;, meaning Kincsem cantering for the agreed victory over her stablemate Blankenese.

In Pest, Kincsem entered the St Leger on 7 October over a distance of 2800 meters. In a field of seven, the early pacemaker opened up a lead of 30 lengths, while Kincsem rated at the head of the trailing pack. In the last turn, she went to the lead and won by 10 lengths ahead of Prince Giles The First. Two days later, Kincsem entered the Kanczadij, now known as the Hungarian Oaks but at that time a race for fillies and mares age three and up. Kincsem was assigned a weight of . She again followed a long-margin leader in second place and won easily, beating her old rival Konotoppa by three lengths.

On 14 October, Kincsem returned to Vienna, where she won the Freudenauer Preis by walkover. She then travelled to Prague for the Kaiserpreis on 21 October at a distance of 2400 metres. She met Prince Giles The First for the second time and beat him by a length, leading all the way. Two day later, she won another Kaiserpreis by walkover. She ended the season with 17 victories, having won at distances from 1600 metres to 3200 metres.

After the 1877 season, British racing journalist Mr. Langley from the &quot;Morning Post&quot; delivered a challenge in the name of Mr. John Fiennes, who owned the Epsom Oaks winner Placida. As Placida was better at distances from to a mile, Fiennes suggested a match over miles in the spring of 1878 at either Ascot or Goodwood. Blaskovich accepted the challenge but altered the conditions, suggesting a match for a purse of 50,000 - 500,000 florins (roughly equivalent to €600,000 to €6 million in 2020), at a distance from 2400m to 2800m, held halfway between the two home bases, in either Frankfurt or Baden-Baden. The match was widely discussed in the newspapers in the winter but Fiennes refused the conditions, explaining that he did not want to travel outside England with Placida.

===1878: four-year-old season===
In 1878, Kincsem turned four years old, meaning that while in the previous year she had a weight for age advantage against older horses, she would now have to concede weight to three-year-olds. In the spring, the form of previously undistinguished three-year-old horses can improve dramatically, which posed problems for Kincsem in her first two starts of the season, in the two cheapest races she ran that year. In the Eröffnungsrennen on Easter Monday 22 April, Kincsem looked to have little competition in a field of five runners on paper form. However, the three-year-old Wild Rover stayed on strongly under 53.5 kg and Madden had to ride hard until Kincsem, under 65.5 kg, broke his resistance 50 meters before the finish and won by two lengths. Wild Rover had been unplaced at two but developed into one of the best three-year-old horses of 1878 with five victories and four second-place finishes.

Another up-and-coming three-year-old colt met Kincsem three days later in the Praterpreis over 2000 meters, where she set the early pace under 67.5 kg. Count Henckel&#x27;s Oroszvar under 54.5 kg challenged her in the straight and come close, but Madden pushed Kincsem home three lengths ahead of the colt, who later won the Trial Stakes (A-H 2000 Guineas), Union Rennen, Deutsches Derby and Renard Rennen.

On the way back from Vienna, Kincsem made a stop in Bratislava, where she met Count Henckel&#x27;s Prince Giles The First for the third time. In a match race in the Államdij over 2400 meters, Kincsem set a moderate pace, easily repulsed a short attack of Prince Giles The First, and won by 5 lengths while giving him a 5 kg advantage.

On 14 May, Kincsem met Prince Giles The First again in Budapest, in the Allamdij over two miles. The three-year-old filly Gondolat set the pace under 46 kg and led by 30-40 lengths ahead of Kincsem (67 kg), followed by Prince Giles (62.5 kg). At the halfway point, Kincsem made her move and easily went by Gondolat. Turning into the stretch, she led by five lengths and cantered home 5 to 6 lengths ahead of Prince Giles The First. Two days later, Kincsem beat Prince Giles The First for the fifth time. In a match race in the Kisbéri dij over 2000 metres, Kincsem set a slow pace under 69.5 kg, then increased the pace after half a mile. Prince Giles the First under 65 kg could barely hold her and Kincsem won &quot;as she willed&quot; by two lengths.

In the Allamdij over 2400 metres on 19 May, Count Henckel sent former champion mare Konotoppa against Kincsem in a field that also included the best three-year-old filly Altona, who like Kincsem was trained by Hesp. Kincsem (69.4 kg) took the early lead setting a slow pace, then Altona (51 kg) took over as the pace picked up. In the last turn, Kincsem struck and beat her stablemate by a couple of lengths. A further 4 to 5 lengths behind was Konotoppa (66.5 kg), who was reported in foal and went to Henckel&#x27;s stud Hugo Telep in Oroszvar (Rusovce) after the race.

In the Austrian Derby on 26 May, Kincsem&#x27;s half-brother Outrigger (Ostreger x Waternymph) was defeated by a head. That same day, Kincsem won the Staatspreis over 2800 meters, beating the nearest of three rivals easily by a length. On 28 May, she repeated last year&#x27;s victory in the Trial Stakes over a mile, beating Prince Giles The First for the sixth time, in this case by 10 lengths while giving him a 6.5 kg advantage. On 30 May, she repeated her victory in the two mile Staatspreis, cantering home five lengths ahead of two rivals.

That concluded the spring part of her campaign, in which Kincsem won nine races in a span of 39 days at distances from 1600 to 3200 meters at the three main Austro-Hungarian racetracks. Directly from Vienna, the Austro-Hungarian stables went to Berlin. Count Henckel won four races there, including the Union Rennen, in which Oroszvar beat the best German three-year-old Vitus, and Hesp&#x27;s Altona won the Stutenrennen (Preis der Diana). Kincsem did not race in Germany as she was now targeting the Goodwood Cup in England. While in Berlin though, she was measured by the famous painter Emil Adam, who then created a rare drawing signed 8 June 1878 in Hoppegarten. Her basic measurements were described as body length 170 cm, total height 165 cm (of which the chest measured 76 cm), width of chest 40 cm and width of hips 50 cm.

Ten days later in Hannover, Altona was beaten by a head in the Grosser Preis von Hannover and Hesp&#x27;s stable continued to the Derby meeting in Hamburg. At this point, Kincsem with her stable friend Csalogány sailed to England. The Hungarian racing bulletin &quot;Vadász- és Versenylap&quot; cited turfwriter &quot;Vigilant&quot; from the newspaper Sportsmann, who wrote: &quot;Kincsem last Sunday (June 30) sailed across the channel to England, in very nice quiet weather and in the evening she was with Mr. Daley in Newmarket; and on Monday morning she took a morning walk with her stablemate.&quot;

After Altona won the Hansa-Rennen in Hamburg, jockey Elijah Madden went to Newmarket, where he rode Kincsem in workouts. One of the reports said that Kincsem and Csalogany were in good health and could be seen walking every day on the Newmarket lawn, and galloping every other day from two to miles. However, the English papers were no longer as sympathetic towards Kincsem and there was some unfavourable talk. One report speculated that the air, food and water in England were having an adverse effect on Kincsem&#x27;s form, and noted that Csalogany was no longer a good lead horse because she could not force Kincsem to the required speeds during their gallops. The subsequent explanation was that they didn&#x27;t have good drinking water in Newmarket. Hesp solved the problem by boiling the water, then cooled it and gave it to Kincsem. This story is probably the basis of the legend that Kincsem drank only water from their home and traveled with her own water supply, which is rather unrealistic due to the enormous amount of the water that they would have to carry by train on several months&#x27; journeys.

In mid-July, the racing stables and studs around Newmarket were affected by an epidemic so Hesp was forced to leave the area. The Duke of Richmond, owner of the Goodwood House next to Goodwood racetrack, accommodated the Hungarian expedition for the last 14 days before the Goodwood Cup.

There were originally 17 horses entered in the Goodwood Cup, held on 1 August over miles (4000 m). This had reduced to five by raceday, and then Ascot Gold Cup winner Verneuil and Lord Clive were withdrawn at noon. Kincsem went off at odds at 3/1, the sole race in her career where she was not an odds-on favorite. She won by two lengths over 5/4 favourite Pageant, winner of the Brighton and Chester Cups, and subsequently the Doncaster Cup. Lady Goligthly, winner of the Yorkshire Oaks, Nassau Stakes and Park Hill Stakes in the previous year, was far behind under Fred Archer at odds of 2/1. The Austrian and Hungarian newspapers enthusiastically reported about another easy victory of the &quot;Wonder Mare&quot;, but English turfwriters were shocked by the ride of Madden, well known as hard whip rider in Austria-Hungary and Germany. The newspaper &quot;Press&quot; wrote: &quot;The race was run at a slow pace, which was not increased much till three-quarters of a mile from home, when Lord Falmouth&#x27;s mare was beaten, and it looked a thousand to one on Pageant, the Hungarian mare being beaten and being ridden hard – shamefully so, in fact, and Madden must surely have been apprenticed to a butcher. He has, I believe, ridden the mare in nearly all her races, and the only wonder to me is that there is anything of her left, as she was spur marked from shoulder to tail; however he kept at it, and, catching Pageant a hundred yards from home, won in a canter.&quot;
The &quot;Illustrated Sporting &amp; Dramatic News&quot; published a picture of the fight between Kincsem and Pageant alongside a picture of spectators viewing Kincsem&#x27;s injuries after the race. Turfwriter &quot;Skylark&quot; wrote: &quot;How she won is now a matter of history, but how she might have won with Cannon or Archer up it is most difficult to conjecture, Madden riding her in rather butcher-like fashion after she had the race well in hand.&quot; English reports later came to Austria-Hungary and the satirical magazine &quot;Kikeriki&quot; published a cartoon showing a donkey watching the torture of Kincsem with the caption, &#x27;Oh how happy I am that I am not a talent!&#x27;

Francis Cavaliero reported that he was asked from several quarters whether the mare was for sale and with the consent of her owner asked for the sum of £20,000, whispering &quot;she is not for sale&quot;.

The Goodwood meeting was a great one for Hungarian thoroughbred breeding. A day before the Goodwood Cup, a two-year-old own brother to Tallos named Galantha was a close third behind Rayon d&#x27;Or in the Levante Stakes, and on the day of the Goodwood Cup, a two-year-old colt (subsequently named Molecomb) by Cambuscan out of Honey Bee won the Molecomb Stakes under Fred Archer at odds 100/15. The winning prizes in the Goodwood Cup and Molecomb Stakes were £480 and £1,125, converted to 4,800 and 11,250 florins, but Austro-Hungarian and German owners and spectators won much more on bets. &quot;Vadász- és Versenylap&quot; reported that Tassilo Festetics, Béla Zichy and the Grand Duke of Hesse won 150,000 florins each, while Blaskovich won 30,000, Cavaliero 20,000 and Elijah Madden 10,000. Together they netted 510,000 florins which was equivalent to about €6.5 million in 2020.

The team of Kincsem had avoided the French railways on their way to England through Germany and did so as well on their way to Deauville. Kincsem almost certainly sailed from Portsmouth, which is about 15 miles (24 km) from her Goodwood stable, to Le Havre, about 10 miles (16 km) as the crow flies to Deauville. &quot;Vadász- és Versenylap&quot; published a short message that on 4 August Kincsem made her way to France and ended up in Havre to await her duty in Deauville. The same report said that a match against Epsom Derby and St. Leger winner Silvio, offered by Lord Falmouth in Goodwood, would not take place.

In the Grand Prix de Deauville over 2400 meters on 18 August, Kincsem&#x27;s main rival was Fontainebleau, winner of the Poule d&#x27;Essai des Poulains. The pace was set by Ellevion, a stablemate of Fontainebleau, but Kincsem used him as her own pacemaker, following him at the front of the pack. On the backstretch, she went to the lead and only Fontainebleau could keep her pace. Kincsem held off his drive and won a half length having the advantage of 3 kg. Four lengths behind followed Gift (subsequent winner of the Grand Prix de Vichy), Mondaine (winner of the Prix de Diane and Grand Prix de Vichy) and Vinaigrette (previous winner of the Grand Prix de Deauville) in a strong field of 8 runners.

On the way from Deauville to Baden-Baden, Kincsem and Csalogany had to use the French railways, which at the time were badly designed with lines focused to Paris. Hesp later reported that Kincsem&#x27;s form in Deauville was about 10 pounds (in terms of ratings) below her top form from Goodwood and fell even more during the protracted railway journey when Kincsem could not do her daily working routine.

There was persistent rain before the Baden-Baden meeting in 1878 and on 3 September, the day of the Grosser Preis von Baden over 3200 meters, the area was hit by heavy rain. &quot;Vadász- és Versenylap&quot; said that the racetrack looked like a country road in spring. Five runners went to the start, with Kincsem going off as the 1/8 favourite against her old rival Prince Giles The First at 8/1. He was at his top form, having just smashed heavy favourite Vitus in Doberan. Other starters were Altona at 25/1, the sole German runner Purple at 40/1, and Vsecko-Jedno with no bets because his owner declared he was only running to try a muddy track before starting in the next race. Vsecko-Jedno was pulled up shortly after the start and Purple set the pace, followed by Altona, Prince Giles and Kincsem. In front of the stands, Prince Giles and Kincsem moved to second and third place. On the opposite side of the track, the pace increased and Altona was beaten. Purple led into the straight where Prince Giles struck, followed by Kincsem three-quarters of a lengths behind. Jockeys Tom Busby and Elijah Madden were working hard, with Kincsem closing inch by inch on a muddy track while carrying an extra 7 kg. Both horses reached the finish together. Purple was 25 lengths behind and Altona was pulled up.

At the time, there were several options to determine the winner in case of dead heat – a deciding heat, the agreement of the owners, or a draw. Blaskovich and Henckel decided to run a second heat, in which many backers turned to Prince Giles The First, a powerfully built colt with a significant weight advantage. Nonetheless, bets were 7/4 in favour of Kincsem. They ran head to head through the first half of the race, and Kincsem looked to have gained the upper hand on the far side. However, a dog then jumped out of the bushes and tried to catch Kincsem. Both horses were scared and only started to calm on the turn, where Busby on Prince Giles The First took advantage of the situation and went to the lead on the inside. Kincsem, ridden hard by whip and spurs, fought back, closing more and more. She caught up with him with 200 meters to go and won &quot;deadly tired&quot; by five lengths.

Nineteenth century Thoroughbreds were tough but Kincsem was exhausted. Hesp canceled her program in Frankfurt and send her to the Vienesse racetrack Freudenau to rest before races in nearby Sopron. Kincsem&#x27;s rivals went to Frankfurt. Altona was a close third in the Wäldchens-Preis, Purple was fourth in Frankfurter Handicap under top weight and Prince Giles The First won the Ehrenpreis. Then Altona was quickly shipped to Hungary, where she won five races in a short time span: on 13 September she won over 2400 meters in Debrecen, on 15 September over 3200 meters, on 20 September over 3212 meters in Cluj, on 22 September over 4824 meters, and on 28 September over 2400 meters in Sopron.

Kincsem returned to racing on 29 September in the Allamdij in Sopron, where she won by &quot;compromise&quot; with Lőrincz and on 20 October in Budapest, she won the Ritterdij by walkover. However, on 22 October in the Kanczadij over 2400 meters, she met her stablemate Altona. This time it was not a predetermined result and for the first time since her two-year-old campaign against Csalogany, her invincibility was threatened by a stablemate. The owner of Altona, János Sztáray, engaged top jockey Tom Busby, who had been beaten by Kincsem many times on Henckel&#x27;s horses Prince Giles The First, Konotoppa, Blücher and Oroszvar. Kincsem with Madden (67.5 kg) set a strong pace challenged by the three-year-old Altona (58.5 kg). In the straight, they fought head to head until the 200 meter pole where Kincsem finally broke the resistance of Altona. She won by half a length and went for a well deserved winter break with 15 victories that year.

===1879: five-year-old season===
After the 1878 season, Kincsem&#x27;s stable friend Csalogany went to the stud and become a successful broodmare, producing 10 winners from 10 foals, including Hungarian and Austrian Oaks winner Csalfa. Madden, who had ridden Kincsem in all 42 of her victories to date and who had been champion jockey in Austria-Hungary from 1876 to 1878, left Hesp&#x27;s stable. After 17 years in Austria-Hungary, Madden went to Germany, to the stable of Prince Hohenlohe-Oehringen.

Kincsem&#x27;s new jockey arrived in Vienna from England in the spring of 1879, a 23-year-old jockey Archie Wainwright. On 28 April, he rode Kincsem for the first time in a much anticipated race against Tallos, who not met her since finishing second in the 1877 Derby. With three victories in 1878, Tallos was regarded as the clear second-best horse in Austrian-Hungary, despite an unsuccessful trip to England where he faded to fifth in the Cambridgeshire Handicap and was unplaced in the Lincolnshire Handicap, when Isonomy lands the famous gamble. He came into the race against Kincsem with two straight victories in 1879. &quot;Vadász- és Versenylap&quot; reported that Kincsem was much calmer than her two restless opponents and looked good but not &quot;fit&quot;, having had only three or four true workouts before the race. A strong pace was set by three-year-old lightweight Myrtle from Hesp&#x27;s stable, followed by Kincsem four lengths behind, then Tallos. On halfway, Kincsem moved forward. Tallos made an effort to match the move but Kincsem under 72 kg quickly built up a 10 length lead before turning into the short straight. She cantered home 8 to 10 lengths ahead of Tallos (73.5 kg) &quot;in the midst of the cracking joy of the audience&quot;.

Next week in Budapest, Kincsem did not find an opponent in the Gróf Károlyi dij over 3600 meters and won by walkover. On 6 May over 3200 meters, she won by two lengths, beating Austrian Derby and Hungarian St Leger winner Nil Desperandum with her former jockey Madden up. On 8 May, she won by two lengths over 2400 metres, beating the up-and-coming three-year-old Harry Hall, later winner of Hungarian St Leger, giving him the advantage of 24 kg (53 pounds). Unplaced in the field of five runners was Prince Giles The First, who then met Kincsem again on 18 May in Vienna, where he was beaten by 10 lengths over 2800 meters. and 20 May in tenth and final race against Kincsem he was last, being beaten by Kincsem and her pacemaker over 3200 m

The stables then moved to Germany, where the Austro-Hungarian horses won all the major races at the Berlin meeting. Count Henckel&#x27;s Picklock and Ilona won the Union-Rennen and Stutenrennen (Preis der Diana), and Kincsem won the Silberner Schild Sr. Majestät des Kaisers over 2400 meters. She was not disturbed by a great storm and led all the way, easy beating her stablemate Altona by two lengths with the sole German runner Vitus 20 lengths behind. A great fan of Kincsem, German Emperor Wilhelm I, regardless of the rain and lightning came down from the stand to take a close look at the &quot;Wonder Mare&quot;.

The foray in Germany was interrupted in Hannover on the way to the Hamburger Derby meeting. Henckel&#x27;s horses fell sick, while both Kincsem and Altona refused to drink. Kincsem was shipped home to Göd along with Blaskovich&#x27;s Purdé, who had been the favourite for the Deutsches Derby but was injured in a workout fall.

After a long break, Kincsem returned to the track on 25 August in Frankfurt, where she rounded the number of victories to 50 in the race supported by her great fan, the Grand Duke of Hesse. Under jockey Wainwright, she led all the way over 2800 meters and won in a canter by four lengths ahead of leading German three-year-old colt Blue Gown, hard ridden by Madden.

A week later, she defended her previous two victories in the Grosser Preis von Baden over 3200 meters, but before that there was an affair with her jockey. Wainwright has been seen shaking hands and talking to a man from a rival stable shortly before the race and Hesp became suspicious that the jockey was bribed. Despite the protests of Wainwright, Hesp replaced him and gave an opportunity to Henckel&#x27;s skilled jockey Tom Busby, who had been beaten by Kincsem in 32 races before, 17 times as the runner-up. Kincsem under 64.5 kg was the sole Austro-Hungarian raider against Derby winning three-year-old filly Künstlerin from the stable of Prince Hohenlohe-Oehringen, carrying only 51 kg and ridden by Madden. Other runners were Hessenpreis (55.5 kg), the full sister to Tallos, and Rococo (59.5 kg), both sold to German owners from Austro-Hungarian stables. Rococo set a very slow pace on soft ground and the race was turned into a sprint in the stretch, which was against a staying Kincsem. Nonetheless, she held up with the pace and went to the lead after Busby went to the whip. She won by three quarters of a length ahead of Künstlerin, with Hessenpreis a half a length behind in third and Rococo three lengths further back. The finish looked dramatic but Busby reported that he had the result under control and did not need to ask Kincsem for more.

Returning to Hungary, Kincsem won the Államdij in Sopron under Wainwright by walkover after withdrawn of Harry Hall and Prince Giles The First, then won the Ritterdij in Budapest by walkover under Busby. Her final start was in the Kanczadij, where she with Busby up smashed German Oaks winner Ilona by 10 lengths, despite giving her advantage of 14.5 kg (32 pounds).

===1880: six-year-old season===

In January 1880, &quot;Vadász- és Versenylap&quot; published a short message stating that Kincsem would stay in training as a six-year-old. A later message said that her new jockey would be Tom Osborne. The April issue reported that the Kincsem was as good as ever, having become a bit wider. She had been seen galloping with such ease as before and her legs were as clean as ever. According to the article, she was to run in Budapest and Vienna in May and then travel to Germany and France. That year Kincsem&#x27;s own brother Szent Marton arrived at Hesp&#x27;s stable but he proved a disappointment. He was unraced at two, was injured at three in a spring workout, and from two starts on the flat, he gained only one second-place finish and 415 florins in earnings. He was renamed as Marczi and won five small races over hurdles.

Kincsem was supposed to start the season on 2 May in Bratislava but was withdrawn. Two weeks later, a report was published that she had been kicked by a stablemate. Although the bruise healed, Blaskovich decided to retire her. Kincsem went to the National Stud in Kisber and on 26 May, she was covered by Verneuil.

==Breeding record==

Kincsem produced five live foals:
* Budagyöngye (1882), filly by Buccaneer, 14: 4-5-2, classic winner, 23,897.50 fl
* Olyan Nincs (1883), filly by Buccaneer, 34: 8-8-3, classic winner, 32,061 fl
* Talpra Magyar (1885), colt by Buccaneer, 23-2-6-4, 6,531 fl
* Kincsőr (1886), colt by Doncaster, 10: 3-2-1, 17,190 fl
* Kincs (1887), filly by Doncaster, unraced

&quot;Vadász- és Versenylap&quot; once wrote that Kincsem alone was never sick and never hurt. Her offspring were not always so fortunate.

Kincsem was barren when covered by Verneuil in 1880. In 1881, she was again covered by Verneuil but was reported barren, so was subsequently covered by Buccaneer, which was successful. Kincsem produced her first foal on 1 January 1882 at five in the afternoon at the train station in Buda – Kincsem had been travelling to Kisber in anticipation of her next breeding session during her &quot;foal heat&quot;. The filly was named Budagyöngye – Pearl of Buda. She was a promising two-year-old with three victories and three seconds, but was injured in the spring of her three-year-old campaign before the classic season. After three bad runs, she finished third in Austrian Derby at odds of 40–1, then was 2nd in the Union Rennen. The highlight of her career came with a victory in the Deutsches Derby. Before the Grosser Preis von Baden, she was injured again and went to stud. She produced two classic winning fillies, Viglány and Dicso, and become a highly influential broodmare. From her branch of Kincsem&#x27;s female family among others become 28 classic winners in 11 European countries, including Calandria (French St Leger), Oberon (Derby Italiano), Polygamy (Epsom Oaks) and Camelot (2000 Guineas, Epsom Derby, Irish Derby).

Olyan Nincs raced from age two to four. In the spring of her three-year-old campaign, she developed a cough, but recovered by the fall to win five races, including the Hungarian St Leger. She also become a highly influential broodmare. From her branch of Kincsem&#x27;s female family came 33 classic winners in 8 European countries, including Falada (German Oaks), Wolke (German Oaks and Derby), Wauthi (German 2000 Guineas and St Leger), Wahnfried and Wicht (both German St Leger), Walesiana and Well Proved (both German 1000 Guineas), Widschi (German 2000 Guineas) and most recently German Derby winners Windstoss and Weltstar.

After the birth of Olyan Nincs, a false report that Kincsem had died was published in the newspaper &quot;Neues Wiener Tagblatt&quot; on March 7, 1883. That year (1883) Kincsem was not covered. She struggled with a chronic nasal discharge and was shipped to the Imperial Stud Fogaras (Făgăraș, now Romania) where she underwent surgery in February 1884 on the forehead and nasal bones. Soon after the surgery, she went to Kisber to be covered by Buccaneer, and in 1885 produced her first colt. Talpra Magyar was named after the Hungarian national poem Nemzeti dal, also known as &quot;Talpra Magyar&quot;. He was considered quite promising after two second-place finishes at two. At three he won his first start, beating the Austro-Hungarian Triple Crown winner and Ascot Gold Cup third Buzgo. After that race though, he developed a heavy cough. He became a roarer and fell sharply in class. He later won one selling race and was bought by Johannes Frohner, who sent him to his stud Karolina-udvar (Carolinenhof). In his first crop, Talpra Magyar sired 2 winners from 2 foals, including probably the most popular horse in Austria-Hungary since Kincsem, the very small but exceptional fighter Tokio, winner of 23 races including the Austro-Hungarian Triple Crown, Grosser Preis von Berlin and Grosser Preis von Baden. After the death of Frohner in 1894, when Tokio was two years old, Talpra Magyar was sold to Germany and sired Hut Ab (Preis der Diana), Xamete (Grosser Preis von Berlin and Grosser Preis von Baden) and Faith (Austrian Oaks).

Her next colt was Kincsőr (Treasurer), winner of one race from five starts at age two. At three he improved rapidly. After two places to start the year, he won the Cambuscan Rennen, then was second in the Austrian Derby and won the Buccaneer Rennen. He was heavily wagered on before the Deutsches Derby – he fell from 7–2 to Evens, and his last price was 2-10. However, he developed colic shortly after arrival in Hamburg. He struggled for a few days and on the day before the Derby, he was withdrawn. He died shortly before the race, won by his stablemate Uram bátyám.

The last foal of Kincsem was Kincs (Treasure), born on 6 February 1887. She was injured in a training accident and was unraced. She was a useful broodmare, producing classic winning fillies Napfeny and Csokos-Asszony, and another two in the next generations, but her branch of Kincsem&#x27;s female family no longer exists.

On 12 March 1887, Kincsem developed colic and despite all available care she died on 16 March 1887, a day before her thirteenth birthday. &quot;Vadász- és Versenylap&quot; published a more detailed tribute on the front page of their next edition, but the main newspapers reported her death in a few brief articles. Shortly after Kincsem&#x27;s death, on 25 April 1887, her former trainer Robert Hesp died of pulmonary edema at a Vienna hospital at the age of 64.

Kincsem&#x27;s corpse was sent to the Veterinary institute in Budapest and the autopsy revealed she died of a worm aneurysm, specifically &quot;Thrombosis and embolism caused by colonization of Sclerostomum armatum in the aneurysmal mesenteric artery, which had led to blockage of the artery, edematous, inflammatory and hemorrhagic processes in the intestinal membranes, paralysis of the same and congestion in the mesenteric veins and in the portal vein.&quot;

Kincsem&#x27;s skeleton was preserved and is on display in the Museum of Hungarian Agriculture.

==Legacy==

Kincsem Park, Hungary&#x27;s premier racecourse and located in Budapest, is named in her honour. There is a life sized statue of her by the entrance to the old grandstand. Blaskovich&#x27;s stud farm now houses the Kincsem Equestrian Park and Kincsem Museum, which contains a room devoted to the mare&#x27;s career. Streets named for Kincsem are in Tápiószentmárton, where she was born, in Kisbér where she died, in Göd, where she was trained, and in Dunakeszi, the biggest training centre in Hungary. There is also a Kincsem Street in Iffezheim (Baden Baden). Kincsem&#x27;s training stable in Göd was abandoned for many years but in 2016-17 was reconstructed and a statue Kincsem was placed there. Many small businesses around the stable are named after her. A photo of the skeleton of Kincsem was used in an advertisement for her descendant Westorkan in 1967.

When including Kincsem in his book of the 100 Greatest Racehorses, racing commentator Julian Wilson noted that although the competition she faced in Hungary was difficult to evaluate, she was &quot;probably one of the best mares to ever race in Europe.&quot; Taking into account her ability to handle heavy weights and the range of distances over which she was successful, turf historian Richard Sowers wrote that there was &quot;little question that [she] compares favorably with any Thoroughbred in history.&quot;

===Film===
A Hungarian film, &quot;&quot;, directed by Gábor Herendi, was released in 2017. The feature film presented Kincsem&#x27;s history with fictitious details. The movie set a record as the most expensive domestic movie ever produced with a total cost of 3 billion forint. The Hungarian National Film Fund contributed 2,078 billion forint toward the total production cost. The movie was released in Hungarian cinemas on 16 March 2017 and was later shown at the Cannes Film Festival.

===Automotive tribute===
In 2021, Tibor Bak (a Swiss-based Hungarian who named his company after the racehorse) showed proposals for an electric hypercar called the Kincsem Hyper-GT, with 54 production models due to be built as a tribute to the 54 races that the horse won.

==Pedigree==
Although Kincsem is Hungarian bred, her pedigree is mainly British. She was also the result of a mistake: Blaskovich had planned to breed his mare Waternymph to Buccaneer, but instead the mare was mated with Cambuscan. Both stallions had been imported from England to stand at the Hungarian National Stud. Cambuscan had earned nine victories including the July Stakes during four seasons of racing. Originally retired to stud in England, Cambuscan was not considered a great success though he did sire 2000 Guineas winner Camballo. In his new country, Cambuscan sired multiple champions including Altona (won Preis der Diana, Kanczadij - Hungarian Oaks), Illona (Preis der Diana, Kanczadij - Hungarian Oaks, Nemzeti dij - Hungarian 2000 Guineas), Gamiani (German Derby), Mereny (Preis der Diana, Kanczadij - Hungarian Oaks, Union-Rennen), Isolani (Nemzeti dij - Hungarian 2000 Guineas, Hungarian St Leger), La Gondola (Grosser Preis von Baden), Gyongyvirág (Zukunfts Rennen, Kanczadij - Hungarian Oaks), Cambrian (Kanczadij - Hungarian Oaks), Frangepan (Hungarian St Leger), Czimer (Union-Rennen) and Pasztor (Hungarian St Leger).

Kincsem&#x27;s dam Waternymph (or Water Nymph in some sources) won the Hungarian equivalent of the Oaks and 2000 Guineas. In addition to Kincsem, Waternymph also produced Hungarian Oaks winner Harmat. Waternymph was a daughter of British sire Cotswold, who had been imported to Germany in 1858. The Hungarian studbook lists The Mermaid as Waternymph&#x27;s dam, a British mare who had won the King John Stakes as a two-year-old. Kincsem&#x27;s full pedigree can be found on the Jockey Club&#x27;s official online database, Equineline.

<doc id="856024" wikidata="Q26690120" url="?curid=856024" title="Islamic clothing">
<text>Islamic clothing is clothing that is interpreted as being in accordance with the teachings of Islam. Muslims wear a wide variety of clothing, which is influenced not only by religious considerations, but also by practical, cultural, social, and political factors. In modern times, some Muslims have adopted clothing based on Western traditions, while others wear modern forms of traditional Muslim dress, which over the centuries has typically included long, flowing garments. Besides its practical advantages in the climate of the Middle East, loose-fitting clothing is also generally regarded as conforming to Islamic teachings, which stipulate that body areas which are sexual in nature must be hidden from public view. Traditional dress for Muslim men has typically covered at least the head and the area between the waist and the knees, while women&#x27;s islamic dress is to conceal the hair and the body from the ankles to the neck. Some Muslim women also cover their face. However, other Muslims believe that the Quran strictly mandate that women need to wear a hijab or a burqa.

Traditional dress is influenced by two sources, the Quran and hadith. The Quran provides guiding principles believed to have come from God, while the body of hadith describes a human role model attributed to the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The branch of fashion industry influenced by Islamic principles is known as Islamic fashion.
==Common practice==

Islamic precepts related to modesty (&quot;haya&quot;) are at the base of Islamic clothing. Adherents of Islam believe that it is the religious duty of adult Muslim men and women to dress modestly, as an obligatory ruling agreed upon by community consensus.

According to the traditional view in Sunni Islam, men must cover from their belly buttons to their knees, though they differ on whether this includes covering the navel and knees or only what is between them. Women have traditionally been encouraged to cover most of their body except for their hands and faces.

An Arabic word strongly associated with Islamic clothing and &quot;haya&quot; is &quot;khimar&quot; (), which translates into English as &quot;veil&quot;. The veil re-emerged as a topic of conversation in the 1990s when there was concern regarding potential western infiltration of Muslim practices in Islamic countries.

==Islamic dress in Europe==

Islamic dress in Europe, notably the variety of headdresses worn by Muslim women, has become a prominent symbol of the presence of Islam in western Europe. In several countries the adherence to &quot;hijab&quot; (an Arabic noun meaning &quot;to cover&quot;) has led to political controversies and proposals for a legal ban. The Netherlands government has decided to introduce a ban on face-covering clothing, popularly described as the &quot;burqa ban&quot;, although it does not only apply to the Afghan-model &quot;burqa&quot;. Other countries, such as France and Australia are debating similar legislation, or have more limited prohibitions. Some of them apply only to face-covering clothing such as the &quot;burqa&quot;, &quot;chador&quot;, &quot;boushiya&quot;, or &quot;niqab&quot;; some apply to any clothing with an Islamic religious symbolism such as the &quot;khimar&quot;, a type of headscarf (some countries already have laws banning the wearing of masks in public, which can be applied to veils that conceal the face). The issue has different names in different countries, and &quot;the veil&quot; or &quot;hijab&quot; may be used as general terms for the debate, representing more than just the veil itself, or the concept of modesty embodied in &quot;hijab&quot;.

Although the Balkans and Eastern Europe have indigenous Muslim populations, most Muslims in western Europe are members of immigrant communities. The issue of Islamic dress is linked with issues of migration and the position of Islam in western society. European Commissioner Franco Frattini said in November 2006, that he did not favour a ban on the burqa. This is apparently the first official statement on the issue of prohibition of Islamic dress from the European Commission, the executive of the European Union. The reasons given for prohibition vary. Legal bans on face-covering clothing are often justified on security grounds, as an anti-terrorism measure.

Ayaan Hirsi Ali sees Islam as incompatible with Western values, at least in its present form. She advocates the values of &#x27;Enlightenment liberalism&#x27;, including secularism and equality of women. For her, the burqa or chador is both a symbol of religious obscurantism and the oppression of women. Western Enlightenment values, in her view, require prohibition, regardless of whether a woman has freely chosen Islamic dress. Islamic dress is also seen as a symbol of the existence of parallel societies, and the failure of integration: in 2006 British Prime Minister Tony Blair described it as a &quot;mark of separation&quot;. Visible symbols of a non-Christian culture conflict with the national identity in European states, which assumes a shared (non-religious) culture. Proposals for a ban may be linked to other related cultural prohibitions: the Dutch politician Geert Wilders proposed a ban on hijabs, Islamic schools, new mosques, and non-western immigration.

In France and Turkey, the emphasis is on the secular nature of the state, and the symbolic nature of the Islamic dress. In Turkey, bans apply at state institutions (courts, civil service) and in state-funded education. In 2004, France passed a law banning &quot;symbols or clothes through which students conspicuously display their religious affiliation&quot; (including hijab) in public primary schools, middle schools, and secondary schools, but this law does not concern universities (in French universities, applicable legislation grants students freedom of expression as long as public order is preserved). These bans also cover Islamic headscarves, which in some other countries are seen as less controversial, although law court staff in the Netherlands are also forbidden to wear Islamic headscarves on grounds of &#x27;state neutrality&#x27;. An apparently less politicized argument is that in specific professions (teaching), a ban on &quot;veils&quot; (niqab) is justified since face-to-face communication and eye contact are required. This argument has featured prominently in judgements in Britain and the Netherlands after students or teachers were banned from wearing face-covering clothing. The public and political response to such prohibition proposals is complex, since by definition they mean that the government decides on individual clothing. Some non-Muslims, who would not be affected by a ban, see it as an issue of civil liberties, as a slippery slope leading to further restrictions on private life. A public opinion poll in London showed that 75 percent of Londoners support &quot;the right of all persons to dress in accordance with their religious beliefs&quot;. In another poll in the United Kingdom by Ipsos MORI, 61 percent agreed that &quot;Muslim women are segregating themselves&quot; by wearing a veil, yet 77 percent thought they should have the right to wear it.

== Muslim women&#x27;s views on hijab ==
===Pro-hijab===
Muslim women do not necessarily view the hijab as an oppressive garment that is forced upon them.

===Anti-hijab===

There are some Muslim women who believe that the hijab indeed hinders their personal freedom as a woman. Another belief of some women that wear the hijab is that it could potentially &quot;strip them of their individuality&quot; and turn them into a figurehead for their religion. Some women do not want to have to deal with this on a daily basis, and it is another reason that some Muslim women have decided to un-veil themselves.

Iran is another country with strict rules on the hijab, and many women feel pressured from the government to dress in a certain style.

==Hijab by country==


The legal and cultural status of the hijab is different in different countries. Some have banned the wearing of all overt religious symbols, including the hijab (a Muslim headscarf, from the Arabic &quot;to cover&quot;), in public schools or universities or government buildings.

=== Austria ===
In 2017, a legal ban on covering one&#x27;s face in public (primarily targeting Islamic clothing such as burqa and niqab) was adopted by the Austrian parliament. Additionally, on 16 May 2019, the Austrian parliament placed a ban on &quot;ideologically or religiously influenced clothing which is associated with the covering of the head&quot; in primary schools. This ban directly bans traditional headscarves worn by Muslim women worldwide.

=== Belgium ===
On 31 March 2010 the Belgian Chamber Committee on the Interior unanimously approved legislation instating a nationwide ban on wearing the burqa in public. The proposal was accepted by the Chamber of Representatives on 27 April 2010 with only two abstentions from Flemish Socialist MPs.

=== Bulgaria ===
In 2016, a legal ban on face-covering Islamic clothing was adopted by the Bulgarian parliament.

=== France ===

In April 2011, France became the first European nation to ban face covering in public space. Balaclavas, face-covering niqabs, full-body burqas and carnival masks (outside carnival season) are prohibited, though hijab is permitted in public space, because it does not hide the face. The law was passed unanimously asserting that face-covering, including Muslim veils are contrary to the principles of security on which France is founded.
Sharp criticism had accompanied France&#x27;s nearly year-long debate on banning burqa-style veils, with those opposed saying, among other things, that the entire process has stigmatized the nation&#x27;s estimated 5 million Muslims – the largest Muslim population in western Europe. They also claim it is a political ploy because only an estimated 1,900 women wear veils that hide the face.

=== Germany ===
An administrative court in Munich has prohibited a Muslim student from wearing a facial veil in class.&quot; Although Germany does not have an official ban on the hijab, according to the nation&#x27;s highest courts federal states have permission to ban Muslim state employees wearing clothing they deem inappropriate. This rule leaves flexibility for German legislators to essentially make their own rules concerning clothing/dress in the country.

=== Latvia ===
In 2015 Latvia started debates to forbid face-covering clothing with proposed fines up to 150 euro for covering face in public and up to 350 euro for forcing someone to cover face in public. Government of Latvia agreed on the law only in 2017, and forwarded it to Saeima for final confirmation. Since 2018 process has not moved forward and law is not confirmed and operational yet. There are almost no women in Latvia who cover their face and many have pointed out that such law would be redundant.

=== Netherlands ===
The Dutch government parliament in January 2012 enacted a ban on face-covering clothing, popularly described as the &quot;burqa ban&quot;. Offenders can be fined up to 390 euro. The prohibition does not apply to face covering that is necessary for the health, safety or the exercise of a profession or practicing a sport. Excluded from the ban are also events such as Sinterklaas, Carnival, Halloween or when a mayor granted an exemption for a particular event. Also excluded from prohibition are places and buildings intended for religious purposes. The prohibition does not apply to passengers in airplanes and airports who are traveling through the Netherlands to their final destination.

=== Palestine ===

In Gaza, Palestinian jihadists belonging to the Unified Leadership (UNLU) have rejected a hijab policy for women.

=== Turkey ===

Turkish women who want to wear the hijab – the traditional Islamic headscarf covering the head and hair, but not the face – to civil service jobs and government offices will be able to do so now that the Turkish government has relaxed its decades-long restriction on wearing the headscarf in state institutions. The new rules, which do not apply to workers in the military or judiciary, came into effect in 2013, and were put into place to address concerns that the restrictions on hijab were discouraging women from conservative backgrounds from seeking government jobs or higher education. &quot;A dark time eventually comes to an end,&quot; Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech to the parliament. &quot;Headscarf-wearing women are full members of the republic, as well as those who do not wear it.&quot;

=== Syria ===
In 2011, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad reversed a decision that bans teachers from wearing the niqab. The move was seen as an attempt to appease Salafis as he faced down the uprising challenging his secular rule. As a symbol of political Islam, the government had banned the niqab in July 2010. Syria was the latest in a string of nations from Europe to the Middle East to weigh in on the niqab, perhaps the most visible symbol of fundamentalist Sunni Islam.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, the topic of the hijab is extraordinarily controversial. The veil is constantly a topic of debate and has been for decades now. The Pew Research Center gathered information on several countries, including Pakistan, and came back with results on how people&#x27;s perceptions of the veil differ across the world. Participants were given pictures of six women wearing different styles of veil along with the question: &quot;What Style of Dress is Appropriate for Women in Public?&quot;. The results found that: &quot;In Pakistan, there is an even split (31% vs. 32%) between woman #3 and woman #2, who is wearing a niqab that exposes only her eyes, while nearly a quarter (24%) choose woman #4.&quot; The results show that there is still a lot of debate about what type of dress women perceive to be most appropriate, and it seems that the debate will continue to go on for many years to come.

=== Egypt ===

On 8 January 2014, the Pew Research Center conducted a survey of Muslim women in various countries. An overwhelming eighty-nine percent of Egyptian women who responded to the survey believed that women should show their face in public. Ten percent of the survey participants believed that women should be fully veiled when in public. Compared to other countries, Egypt is not as conservative as others, but only fourteen percent of the women surveyed believed that Egyptian women should be able to choose their own clothing. Compared to six other countries, Egypt was last in this category; the statistic (eighty-four percent) suggests that Egyptian women (according to that single survey), do not believe that women should have freedom to choose their clothing. Meanwhile, in Egyptian media, women have always spoken about their freedom and right to wear whatever they want and that no one should be judged based on their outfits.

=== Saudi Arabia ===

Niqab is most often used in Saudi Arabia, along with Hijab. While some perceive Niqab to be mandatory, Hijab is seen as a more modern style of clothing. Niqab is also revered as a conservative and modest clothing due to the deeply religious and cultural values.
While opinion surveys in Saudi Arabia suggests a strong belief that women should be covered, paradoxically there is also a strong belief that women should have the right to choose what they wear.

A survey done in 2011 by the Pew Research Center asked women of different Muslim countries to choose which of several dresses they think are most appropriate for their country. Among Saudi women, 11% of women said a fully headed burqa is most appropriate, 63% of women said the niqab that only exposes the eyes is appropriate, only 8% said a black hijab covering the hair and ears is appropriate, 10% said a less conservative white hijab covering the hair and ears is appropriate, a small 5% said an even less conservative hijab that is brown and shows some hair is appropriate and a mere 3% said not wearing any covering was appropriate. The niqab is the dress that the highest percent of Saudi women felt was appropriate dress for women in Saudi Arabia. In accordance with these statistics, the Saudi woman that is used in the video, cited above, to show the popular view of Saudi women was wearing this niqab that only exposed her eyes.

=== Somalia ===
During regular, day-to-day activities, Somali women usually wear the &quot;guntiino&quot;, a long stretch of cloth tied over the shoulder and draped around the waist. In more formal settings such as weddings or religious celebrations like Eid, women wear the &quot;dirac&quot;, which is a long, light, diaphanous voile dress made of cotton or polyester that is worn over a full-length half-slip and a brassiere. Married women tend to sport head-scarves referred to as &quot;shash&quot;, and also often cover their upper body with a shawl known as &quot;garbasaar&quot;. Unmarried or young women, however, do not always cover their heads. Traditional Arabian garb such as the hijab and the jilbab is also commonly worn.

=== Hijab in the Americas ===
==== United States ====

Most Muslim women in the United States wear hijab at least some of the time. Contrary to popular theories about assimilation, this number is in fact higher among native-born Muslim women compared to first-generation Muslim immigrants.

There are no legal restrictions on Islamic modesty garb in the United States, due to universal religious freedom protections in American law. For example, the Supreme Court of the United States ruled against Abercrombie and Fitch when they refused to hire a woman named Samantha Elauf on account of her wearing hijab, stating that the dress code policy violated Elauf&#x27;s religious freedom. 

As most gyms, fitness clubs, and other workout facilities in the United States are mixed-sex, observant Muslim women must either avoid these facilities or exercise in hijab, which is often impractical. Individuals such as Maria Omar, director of media relations for the Islamic Food and Nutrition Council of America (IFANCA), have thus advised Muslim women to avoid these complexes entirely as being in conflict with Islamic norms.

==== Canada ====

In 2011, the Canadian government made it illegal for women to wear face-covering garments at citizenship ceremonies, because the judge must be able to see each person&#x27;s face reciting their oath. In 2012, the Supreme Court issued a rare split decision on whether women could cover their faces in the witness box. Four judges said it depended on the circumstances, two said witnesses should never cover their face, and one said a Muslim witness should never be ordered to remove her veil. Canada is considering a wider ban on veils in government offices, schools, and hospitals. On 16 June 2019, the provincial government of French-speaking Quebec enacted the Act respecting the laicity of the State. The Act prohibits certain public servants from wearing religious regalia – including Muslim scarves and veils, turbans, Jewish skullcaps and Christian crucifixes. 

==== South America ====
==== Argentina ====
In 2011 Argentinian President Cristina Fernández pushed for legislation which allowed for Muslim women to wear hijab in public places. According to the new law Argentine Muslim women can wear a hijab while being photographed for their national id cards. The law was created in order to help promote freedom of religion and expression in the country, and help the Muslim population, which is estimated to be between 450,000 and one million, feel more integrated into society.

==== Chile ====
Chile has a minority Muslim population. Fuad Mussa, the President of the Islamic Cultural Centre, is quoted as saying that &quot;there is a general ignorance among Chileans about Islam.&quot; This was after a Chilean citizen was refused service at a bank because of her hijab in 2010, and would not be served until she removed her hijab.

<text>The Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Military School, in Guston, Kent, commonly known as the Duke of York&#x27;s, is a co-educational academy with military tradition for students aged 11 to 18. 

In 2010, the school became an academy under the Ministry of Defence and accepts applications from any student wishing to enroll in a break from the schools tradition of only accepting the children of veterans and/or serving members of the armed forces.

This break with tradition had the effect of transforming the school into a state boarding school and offered it a membership in the State Boarding Forum and Boarding Schools Association. The latter development yet once again changed the school&#x27;s oversight and transferred it from the Ministry of Defence to the Department for Education.

The curriculum employed by The Duke of York’s includes some military traditions, such as the use of uniforms and ceremonial parades, however the School does employ a monitorial style of education modelled on the English public school system.

Founded in 1803 by royal warrant in 1801, the school was called the Royal Military Asylum until 1892. The school&#x27;s primary purpose was to educate the orphans of British servicemen killed in the Napoleonic Wars of 1793–1815. Between 1803-1909 the Royal Military Asylum was located at what is now known as the Duke of York&#x27;s Headquarters in Chelsea, London. The school was co-educational; which makes the Duke of York&#x27;s the second co-educational boarding school in the United Kingdom. The first co-educational institution was the Royal Hibernian Military School in Dublin which was relocated and merged with Duke of York&#x27;s after Ireland declared independence. Today, the Chelsea site is home to the Saatchi Gallery.

The school adopted the &quot;Madras system of education&quot; developed by Dr. Andrew Bell, to which Joseph Lancaster made certain improvements. In 1812, three African youths attended the school as teachers at the invitation of the Duke of Gloucester. They were then sent by the African Institution to Sierra Leone where they were employed as teachers by the Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, the Earl of Liverpool.
Between 1816-1840, the Asylum had a branch in Southampton which provided schooling for up to 400 military orphans and children serving soldiers of both sexes until 1823, after which the boys were transferred to Chelsea with the girls going to Southampton. A decline in the school numbers resulted in its closure in 1840. Starting in 1841, the building were taken over by the Ordnance Survey.

Peter Brown, a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars, and Major General served as Commandant of the Royal Military Asylum. Brown&#x27;s promotion from colonel to major general occurred while an incumbent Commandant, a development that possibly could be seen as a break given that it was non-active command and it lacked precedence.

Many of the school&#x27;s pupils performed acts of gallantry in the wars in which the British Army was involved. One such individual was John Shaul, who in the Boer War individuated himself for his bravery and was awarded the Victoria Cross.

It was in 1892 that the Royal Military Asylum was renamed as &quot;The Duke of York&#x27;s Royal Military School&quot; and ultimately became an all-boys school. In 1909, the school relocated to a new siting on the cliffs above Dover in Kent. For the duration of World War I (1914–1918), the school was evacuated to Hutton, near Brentwood, Essex. This provided the military authorities with a transit point in Dover for troops moved to and from the Western Front. In 1940, the school was evacuated to the Saunton Sands Hotel, Braunton, North Devon. It finally returned to Dover by 1946.

In 1994, the school re-admitted girls and returned to co-education.

The school&#x27;s first civilian students were accepted in 2010 after the school was granted academy status.

== Academic ratings ==
Between 2007-2009, more than 90% of the pupils gained 5 or more GCSEs at grades A*-C (including English and Mathematics). More than 13% of grades were A*/A during the same period.

During this period (2007–2009), 19% of grades gained were A/B at AS level and 12% of grades were A/B at A2 level. A total of 32% of grades gained were passed at A2 level.

== Exchanges with NATO member military schools ==
The Duke of York&#x27;s runs student exchange programmes with military schools within the umbrella of NATO.The exchange programme with the Lycée Militaire, in Aix-en-Provence, its French equivalent is a case in point. The Duke of York&#x27;s has also connections with some USA military academies, e.g. the Missouri Military Academy, or the Valley Forge Military Academy and College in Wayne, Pennsylvania, but also with further afar as the Faujdarhat Cadet College, in Chittagong, Bangladesh. Placements for recent school leavers from respective military schools to assume assistant teaching posts at corresponding schools are also within the academy&#x27;s purview.

He was Parliamentary Private Secretary to Barbara Castle at the Ministry of Transport and after 1970 spoke for the Labour opposition on industrial relations. He was also a member of the All Party Parliamentary Humanist Group. In mid-1978, Rose called for an inquiry into &quot;lesbian attacks&quot; at a prison in Cheshire.

He stepped down in 1979, and later joined the Social Democratic Party in the 1980s.

Rose noted discrimination against Catholics in Northern Ireland and in the early 1960s was one of the first to predict The Troubles. He became Chairman of the Campaign for Democracy in Ulster, Chairman of the North West Sports Council, and Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party Home Office Group. He served on the Council of Europe and was Vice-Chairman of Labour Campaign for Europe. He was also founder and chairman of the anti-cult organisation Family, Action, Information, and Rescue. He became a coroner in the south of London. He was a Deputy Circuit Judge and a Part Time Immigration and Political Asylum Adjudicator. An atheist and humanist, Rose was a member of the British Humanist Association, which later invited him to be one of its patrons.

Rose was the editor of six books on law, politics and history, including &quot;Backbencher&#x27;s Dilemma&quot; and &quot;A&quot; &quot;History of the Fenians In England&quot; after publishing &quot;The Manchester Martyrs&quot;. He prepared a manuscript for publication on the Unification Church called &quot;The Moonies Unmasked&quot;; however, it was not published. He also contributed many articles to newspapers and magazines on history, law and politics.

He died on 3 November 2015 at the age of 79. He was buried with a humanist service.

<doc id="856045" wikidata="Q523005" url="?curid=856045" title="Will Kymlicka">
<text>William Kymlicka (; born 1962) is a Canadian political philosopher best known for his work on multiculturalism and animal ethics. He is currently Professor of Philosophy and Canada Research Chair in Political Philosophy at Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston, and Recurrent Visiting professor in the Nationalism Studies program at the Central European University in Budapest, Hungary. For over 20 years, he has lived a vegan lifestyle, and he is married to the Canadian author and animal rights activist Sue Donaldson.

==Education and career==
Kymlicka received his B.A. (Honours) in philosophy and political studies from Queen&#x27;s University in 1984, and his D.Phil. in philosophy from Oxford University in 1987, under the direction of G. A. Cohen. He has written extensively on multiculturalism and political philosophy, and several of his books have been translated into other languages. Kymlicka has held professorships at a variety of different universities in Canada and abroad, and has also worked as an advisor to the Government of Canada.

==Thought==

One of his main concerns throughout his work is providing a liberal framework for the just treatment of minority groups, which he divides into two basic categories: polyethnic or immigrant groups, and national minorities (such as the Canadian Québécois, or the Māori of New Zealand). He lists criteria for national minorities or &quot;minority nations&quot;:
# present at founding;
# prior history of self-government;
# common culture;
# common language;
# governing selves through institutions.
By these criteria, the two &quot;minority nations&quot; in Canada are the Indigenous peoples in Canada and the Québécois. Kymlicka argues that such minority groups deserve unique rights from the state by the nature of their unique role and history within the national population.

Polyethnic groups are less deserving of such rights since they come to the state voluntarily and thus have some degree of responsibility to integrate to the norms of their new nation. This does not mean that they are not entitled to any rights as Kymlicka argues that all cultural minorities have a right to choose their own lives, but it does mean that they are not entitled to the same level of group rights which minority nations would be entitled to. Kymlicka makes various exceptions such as the problems faced by refugees, whether from conflict or poverty, and by such minority groups such as African-Americans (whose heritage in America clearly did not begin voluntarily) and argues that their needs with regards to cultural group-specific rights should be considered on a special basis.

In &quot;Multicultural Citizenship&quot; (1995), Kymlicka argues that group-specific rights are consistent with liberalism, and are particularly appropriate, if not outright demanded, in certain situations. He defines three such group-specific rights: special group representation rights (such as affirmative action policies in politics); self-government rights; and polyethnic rights (such as the policy exempting Sikhs from having to wear motorcycle helmets).

A distinction that Kymlicka draws, which is crucial to his liberal defence of group-specific rights for minorities, is between external protection and internal restrictions. Kymlicka argues that external protections between groups may be justified in order to promote equality (but they must not allow for oppression or exploitation, as in apartheid in South Africa). Internal restrictions, however, cannot be justified from a liberal perspective, insofar as they restrict a person&#x27;s autonomy, though they may be granted in certain cases to national minorities.

Brian Barry argues that Kymlicka&#x27;s views are not liberal at all, in the sense that they are not universalist in nature and that they allow for cultural relativism. Barry further accuses Kymlicka of posing a false choice between liberalism as autonomy and liberalism as tolerance, further asserting that claims for cultural rights and for equality of treatment are incompatible. Young Kim provides an interesting comparison of their two views on multiculturalism and the limits of liberalism.

===Human rights===
For Kymlicka, the standard liberal criticism, which states that group rights are problematic because they often treat individuals as mere carriers of group identities, rather than autonomous social agents, is overstated or oversimplified. The actual problem of minorities and how they should be viewed in liberal democracies is much more complex. There is a distinction between good group rights, bad group rights, and intolerable group rights.
# Bad group rights (internal restrictions) are rules imposed by the group upon intragroup relations. They most often take the form of the group restricting the liberty of individual members in the name of group solidarity. Indigenous groups try to protect themselves from women&#x27;s movements on the basis that they threaten the social and traditional role of indigenous populations. He contends that may raise the danger of individual oppression. Internal restrictions can be used to uphold violent, dominant, absolutist systems. Legally-imposed internal restrictions are thus bad and almost always unjust, not to mention that they go against liberal ideals.
# Good group rights (external protections) involve intergroup relations. Indigenous groups need protection in terms of their nationals identities by limiting the vulnerability of that group to the decisions of external groups or society. Therefore, they should have the right to their own taxation, health care, education, and governance.

===Animal rights===
The book &quot;Zoopolis&quot;, by Sue Donaldson and co-authored with Kymlicka, explores the state of animal rights for different categories of animals.

Donaldson and Kymlicka believe that abolitionism is an inadequate response to both the ethical and practical challenges of living fairly and constructively with other animals.

Donaldson and Kymlicka suggest that animals should be characterized through three categories, serving to determine the nature of the laws and politics that should protect those animals. Domesticated animals should be given a kind of adjusted co-citizenship in which their best interest and preferences would be taken into account. Donaldson and Kymlicka defend the end of their use, advocating for a vegan position, but they reject extinctionism with regards to those animals that are currently bred by humans. Wild animals should be granted sovereignty on their land enough so that they can sustain their way of living and prosper. Donaldson and Kymlicka support some moderate forms of intervention to reduce wild animal suffering, and they claim that more significant courses of action should be aiming at keeping wild animals able to lead their lives. &quot;Liminal&quot; animals, those that are not domesticated but live in urban, suburban, or industrial areas (such as mice, pigeons and insects), should be treated as denizens of human communities.

<doc id="856052" wikidata="Q6463711" url="?curid=856052" title="Patience Agbabi">
<text>Patience Agbabi FRSL (born 1965) is a British poet and performer who emphasizes the spoken word. Although her poetry hits hard in addressing contemporary themes, it often makes use of formal constraints, including traditional poetic forms. She has described herself as &quot;bicultural&quot; and bisexual. Issues of racial and gender identity feature in her poetry. She is celebrated &quot;for paying equal homage to literature and performance&quot; and for work that &quot;moves fluidly and nimbly between cultures, dialects, voices; between page and stage.&quot; In 2017, she was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

==Early life and education==
Patience Agbabi was born in London to Nigerian parents. From a young age, she was privately fostered by a white English family and moved at the age of 12 from Sussex to North Wales, where she was then raised in Colwyn Bay. She studied English language and literature at Pembroke College, Oxford.

She earned an MA in Creative Writing, the Arts and Education from the University of Sussex in 2002, and in September that year was appointed Associate Creative Writing Lecturer at the University of Wales, Cardiff.

==Poetry and performances==
Agbabi began performing on the London club circuit in 1995 as a member of the performance group Atomic Lip, which was once described as &quot;poetry&#x27;s first pop group.&quot; Their final tour occurred in 1998, titled &quot;Quadrophonix,&quot; which mixed live and video performance in each show. In 1996, she worked on a performance piece called &quot;FO(U)R WOMEN&quot;, with Adeola Agbebiyi and Dorothea Smartt, first performed at the Institute of Contemporary Arts and touring from 1995 to 1998. She has cited among her influences Janis Joplin, Carol Ann Duffy, Chaucer, and various aspects of contemporary music and culture. Agbabi&#x27;s childhood love of cake is apparent in her poem &quot;Eat Me&quot;.

The poems in her first book &quot;R.A.W.&quot;, published in 1995, focus on her experiences regarding Thatcherism, urban life, and racial and sexual politics. The style of these poems &quot;owe much to the rhythms, verbal and associational genius of rap&quot;. Her next collection was &quot;Transformatrix&quot; (2000), a commentary on contemporary Britain that draws inspiration from popular music forms. &quot;Transformatix&quot; also contains Agbabi&#x27;s first published adaptation of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;, reimagining the Wife of Bath as the Nigerian &quot;Mrs. Alice Ebi Bafa&quot;. In 2008, Agbabi published &quot;Bloodshot Monochrome&quot;, a collection that, as described by one reviewer, highlights social and political issues, captures and considers moments in time through long-dead authors, and offers readers a diverse sampling of the author&#x27;s views of life in a variety of places.&quot; Carol Rumens has said: &quot;Agbabi characteristically makes poetry an opportunity for conversation with the past, not swamping it but setting new lexical terms.&quot;

As Canterbury Laureate from July 2009 to December 2010, Agbabi received an Arts Council grant to write a full-length poetry collection based on Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. The final product was published in 2014 as &quot;Telling Tales&quot;, which retold each tale in the Middle-English work to offer a 21st-century take on the characters, its poetry and its performance elements. The reinterpretation used her critically acclaimed, lyrical poetic style to newly define British literary traditions. The book met with praise from poets including Simon Armitage, who described it as &quot;the liveliest versions of Chaucer you&#x27;re likely to read.&quot; Agbabi continues to tour &quot;Telling Tales&quot; as a performance-poetry production shown at literature festivals, arts spaces and libraries across the UK. She performed tales such as &quot;The Wife of Bafa&quot; or &quot;Tit for Tat (Reeves&#x27;s tale)&quot;.

As well as performing in Britain, Agbabi undertook British Council reading tours of Namibia, the Czech Republic, Zimbabwe, Germany and Switzerland. She took part in &quot;Modern Love&quot;, a spoken-word tour produced by Renaissance One, which explored love and modern relationships, touring the UK and Switzerland.

Her poetry has featured on television and radio, including the Channel 4 series &quot;Litpop&quot; in 1998 and on the children&#x27;s programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in 1999. She has also been a contributor to several anthologies, among them &quot;Jubilee Lines&quot; (2012), edited by Carol Ann Duffy, which marked Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s 60th anniversary on the throne, and &quot;Refugee Tales&quot; (2016), a collection of stories based on accounts by Gatwick airport detainees.

She has taught and run workshops and also been poet-in-residence at various places, ranging from Oxford Brookes University and Eton College to a London tattoo and piercing studio.

In 2018, she was writer in residence at the Brontë Parsonage Museum.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1997, Agbabi&#x27;s first poetry collection, &quot;R.A.W &quot;(1995), received the Excelle Literary Award.

In 2000, she was one of 10 poets commissioned by BBC Radio 4 to write a poem for National Poetry Day.

In 2004, she featured on the Poetry Book Society list of Next Generation poets.

In 2010, Agbabi was appointed as the Canterbury Festival&#x27;s Canterbury Poet Laureate.

In March 2015, The Poetry Society announced Agbabi as one of five poets shortlisted for the 2014 Ted Hughes Award for New Work in Poetry, for her book &quot;Telling Tales&quot;.

In 2017, Agbabi was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

<text>Ken Keyes Jr. (January 19, 1921 – December 20, 1995) was an American personal growth author and lecturer, and the creator of the Living Love method, a self-help system. Keyes wrote fifteen books on personal growth and social consciousness issues, representing about four million copies distributed overall.

==Early life==

===Childhood and adolescence===
Keyes was born an only child to an affluent family in Atlanta. Throughout their lives, he was close to his father and especially to his mother, despite her eventual abuse of alcohol. He suffered from chronic bronchitis and croup in his infant years, and in 1925 his family moved to Miami Beach, Florida, in hopes of his benefiting from its sunny climate. His father, Kenneth Keyes Sr., became successful in real estate development there and active in the conservative evangelical wing of the Presbyterian Church. Keyes was not very athletic as a child, but excelled in academics and developed hobbies, such as photography. When he was in high school, his father bought him a small boat, which began his lifelong interest in sailing.

Keyes attributed the seeds of the personal growth system he would later develop to an experience he had with a stern English teacher in ninth grade. Despite her reputation as a strict teacher and hard grader, he made an effort to be personally caring toward her, which led to her giving him a slight break in grading. He took the lesson from this experience to be &quot;that when I express caring and friendliness, they are reflected back to me in life.&quot;

===College, military service, and a new family===
Keyes entered Duke University in 1938 and spent two years there. He then studied voice and music at the University of Miami, and helped to found the Miami Opera Guild. In 1941, during the World War II era, Keyes enlisted in a naval intelligence unit set up to censor cablegrams entering and leaving the United States.

At age of 20, Keyes met his first wife, Roberta Rymer, at the University of Miami. They were married in December 1941, a few days after the attack on Pearl Harbor. Their first child, Ken III, was born in December 1942, and their second child, Clara Lu, was born in April 1944. Keyes was discharged from the service in October 1945, and entered the real estate business with his father.

When he was around 23, he photographed and filmed Alfred Korzybski at the Institute of General Semantics, helping to document Korzybski&#x27;s life. Apparently he was already greatly involved in the logical aspects of self-help.
===Polio and quadriplegia===
In February 1946, at age 25, Keyes contracted polio and became paralyzed in his legs and hands. His paralysis developed into quadriplegia and was sufficiently severe that, for example, he was unable to turn himself over in bed. He was admitted to the Warm Springs Foundation, a convalescent hospital in Georgia. After a year in the hospital, he moved with his wife to a nearby house for three more years of rehabilitation, during which time he adjusted to life as a wheelchair user. He invented a switch-activated powered bed that would turn his body over. He said he &quot;began to develop the feeling that I did not have to be so totally dependent on other people&quot; and &quot;still wanted to feel that I was a capable and lovable person.&quot; To that end, he obtained a lever-controlled electric wheelchair, a new invention at the time.

Keyes required aides for bodily care for several decades.

===First book===
According to Keyes, he became involved in many activities to overcome the feeling of dependence and uselessness brought on by his disability. He wrote a book on mental techniques for increasing effectiveness in daily life. This book, entitled &quot;How to Develop Your Thinking Ability&quot;, was published by McGraw-Hill in 1950, and contained illustrations by cartoonist Ted Key. Keyes later reacquired the publishing rights to the book and re-released it as &quot;Taming Your Mind&quot;.

In a subsequent book, &quot;Discovering The Secrets of Happiness&quot;, Keyes commented, about this period of his life, that his disability may have been a disguised blessing:&quot;Perhaps I would have been so caught up in the business and social rat race that I wouldn&#x27;t have sat still long enough to study my security, sensation and power illusions — and then discover how to deal with them so I could open up my heart to loving more. My reality is that I am far too busy and involved in my life activities to have time to concern myself with self-consciousness in the wheelchair department. Today I view my so-called &#x27;handicap&#x27; as another gift my life has offered me.&quot;

===Life after polio therapy===
Upon completion of therapy in 1949, Keyes returned to South Miami, Florida, where he resumed work in real estate and bought a specially equipped speedboat for racing.

By 1950, Keyes was the general manager of a radio station owned by his father, and started his own commercial real estate business. Completing his schooling, he received a B.A. in psychology from the University of Miami. He planned and built a series of personal residences, and in 1956 bought a 71-foot yacht, the &quot;Caprice&quot;, capable of serving as a floating residence.

===Divorce and remarriage===
Over these years, Keyes indicates that he and his wife were drifting apart, and he had affairs with other women. He and Rymer separated and then divorced in 1959, after eighteen years of marriage. He received the yacht in the property settlement and moved his residence and office there. His second book, on the topic of nutrition and entitled, &quot;How to Live Longer–Stronger–Slimmer&quot; (later to be retitled, &quot;Loving Your Body&quot;), was published by Fredrick Fell during this period.

Around 1964, Keyes resumed working for his father in a real estate company targeted at foreign investors. At age 44, he met and married his second wife, Bonita, who was sixteen years his junior. During this period he wrote his third book with Jacque Fresco, a book on futurism entitled &quot;Looking Forward&quot;.

According to Keyes, his wife Bonita&#x27;s jealousy and depression became major stumbling blocks in their relationship, and Keyes would later fault himself for what he describes as his unskilled responses to these issues. Keyes and Bonita divorced after a year of marriage, and Keyes grieved the loss of the relationship.

In 1968, Keyes established a national commercial real estate sales operation, with revenues of $25 million during its first year of operation. He maintained romantic relationships with various women, and would later comment that his sexual appetite had been an impediment to his personal growth.

==Spirituality and personal growth==
In 1970, just before his 50th birthday, Keyes traveled to the Esalen Institute in California and enrolled in two workshops there. He then returned to Florida, became involved with the Humanistic Psychology Association and was exposed to teachings such as those of Chogyam Trungpa and Alan Watts. He also experimented briefly with mescaline, which, he reported, induced in him a continuously orgasmic experience he found distasteful. He credited this experience with allowing him to begin overcoming his obsession with sex, although he would remain sexually active throughout his life.

Keyes lived for a few months with two students who had been influenced by Trungpa and Ram Dass. He traveled with them to a commune and a Trappist monastery in Virginia and a spiritual center in Connecticut. A turning point came for Keyes when he visited Trungpa at his center in Barnet, Vermont at Christmas 1970 and discussed with Trungpa the Buddhist notion that the mind&#x27;s reaction rather than external circumstances creates personal unhappiness. Keyes has said that he felt this to be the solution to the life problems he had experienced.

Over the next year, Keyes lived with a small group of people on his yacht, and prepared to turn his business over to an employee and found a nonprofit organization with his other assets. At this time he had a brief experience he described as transcendent, &quot;like the pure energy of God—radiant, indescribable—and I felt a part of it all.&quot;

According to Keyes, during this period he used his new learning to cope more successfully with issues of jealousy and deception in his romantic relationship with a woman named Jane. During an episode in which Jane brought another lover onto his yacht, he used a form of mental reprogramming process that, he says, alleviated his jealously without repressing it, a method he would later teach. During this time he formulated the &quot;Twelve Pathways&quot;, which would constitute the core of his &quot;Living Love&quot; method of personal growth. Within a month he had drafted the core of a new book, &quot;Handbook to Higher Consciousness&quot;. This self-published book sold more than one million copies.

==Living Love years==

===Going west, and the Living Love Center in Berkeley===
In mid-1972, Keyes outfitted a bus for living, sold his yacht, disposed of most of his possessions, and began traveling west with a group of other people, visiting places such as Taos, New Mexico, and the Rainbow Gathering at Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado. He traveled for about a year, and while traveling began holding sessions using the Living Love methods.

Keyes gave his first formal workshop on the Living Love methods at the Esalen Institute. He settled in Berkeley, California, in 1973 and began giving regular workshops, establishing the Living Love Center there in June 1973 in a former fraternity house. The workshops were attended by as many as fifty people at a time. Keyes recruited a staff from the streets of Berkeley at essentially volunteer wages to support the workshops, which he also began giving in Los Angeles. At this time, the &quot;Handbook to Higher Consciousness&quot; was selling about fifty thousand copies a year, and his workshops attracted students from all over the country. In 1974, Keyes banned drug use from the Center. He wrote more books and they began to sell rapidly. His staff, which included Shakti Gawain, Tolly Burkan, and Summer Raven, worked on the workshops and activities such as writing songs to go along with them.

===Cornucopia in Kentucky===
Having outgrown the Berkeley center, in mid-1977 the organization bought a 150-acre (607,000 m2) property in St. Mary, Kentucky, that had been a Catholic seminary. The organization moved to the new property, which it renamed &quot;Cornucopia.&quot;

Soon after the move, conflict developed between Keyes and the organization&#x27;s head administrator and training director, Carole Thompson. Keyes had hired her in Berkeley, but, he said, he later thought she was influencing the staff in unhelpful directions. According to Keyes, she refused to allocate staff to him for the workshops he led, and he felt she was trying to edge him out of teaching and into the financial side of the operation. Similar &quot;power moves&quot; occurred during the Berkeley years, inevitable byproducts of a growing organization. Ken dealt openly with these issues using methods that he taught to keep the organization and vision on track.

The three week-long retreats during this time without Ken included such things as eating vegetarian meals, doing &quot;karma yoga&quot; work (chores) around the grounds, daily workshops based on &quot;The Handbook to Higher Consciousness&quot; principles, and watching the Franco Zeffirelli film, &quot;Brother Sun, Sister Moon&quot;, about the life of St. Francis of Assisi. These practices had been a part of daily life at the Berkeley house, and all residents participated. The goals were to expose participants to teamwork and health consciousness while supporting day-to-day organizational functions.

One of the more interesting exercises, also practiced in Berkeley, occurred when participants randomly selected a partner (done by forming two circles, one inside the other, with the outer circle moving clockwise, and until the leader said &quot;stop&quot; forcing people to choose diametrically opposite partners). A four-foot piece of cord was given to each &quot;couple,&quot; and each was told to tie one end to his or her wrist. Thus, partners were literally tied together for the next 24 to 48 hours. It was a complication to use the bathroom, especially if one&#x27;s partner was of the opposite sex (usually, one person would enter a stall while the other person slid the string between the crack in the door and waited outside). The purpose of the exercise was that partners had to work together and communicate in order to go anywhere or do anything. Adding to the &quot;we are all brothers and sisters&quot; theme was the fact that all the bathrooms and showers at Cornucopia were co-ed, though the expectation was for there to be no sexual contact, unless one was in a pre-existing relationship.

Another exercise was called &quot;The Marathon&quot; where the group participants would stay-up and be in groups for 24 to 36 hours with occasional breaks along with normal meals. During these Marathons there was usually a &quot;Talent Show&quot; with each group member do a bit or with another group member or two.The idea of these various processes---&quot;The String Game&quot; or &quot;The Marathon&quot; was to bring up and trigger security, sensation or power needs/addictions that participants had about the way a particular thing &quot;should/ought&quot; to be, or how it &quot;shouldn&#x27;t&quot; be for them to work on for their growth of being liberated from past &quot;conditioning&quot; about the way things should or shouldn&#x27;t be in the world, or in ones&#x27; life.

Additionally, near the end of the workshop, all people participated in an exercise requiring them to take off all their clothes, stand before the group naked, and share honestly what they did not like about their body. Some had no problem with the exercise and for others it proved quite challenging to be able to let go of all the negative opinions many held regarding their own body images.

===&quot;On retreat&quot; in Santa Cruz===
In March 1978, with six other people, Keyes left Cornucopia in the administrator&#x27;s charge and moved back to Santa Cruz, California, a move he later characterized as an unskillful withdrawal from the problem. He considered the level of teaching quality at Cornucopia after his departure to have lowered and become uneven. Debts at Cornucopia began to increase.

When Keyes left on a live-in bus with some staff that volunteered in March 1978, he had them go through a &#x27;growth process&#x27; where they all had to shave their heads, and if male, their facial hair too. In addition they all were to use just one toothbrush and wear the same clothes with just one change for the time on the bus. It was reported that this process ended prematurely when the participants refused to continue.

On a visit back to Cornucopia in November 1978, Keyes became involved with Penny Hannig, an acquaintance of several years and a main workshop leader at the center, and she joined him in Santa Cruz in 1979. She became his third wife in September 1984.

Keyes remained in Santa Cruz for three years. He describes this period of his life as being &quot;on retreat.&quot; During these years, the couple &quot;lived in a pattern of voluntary simplicity.&quot; He received Social Security disability benefits and received room, board, medical care, and a vacation from the organization, but he took no salary and received no royalties from his books. He received an inheritance from his mother&#x27;s estate, most of which he donated to the organization. He continued to write books, some of which Penny co-wrote.

Penny cared for his physical needs, and they were quite close, remaining in each other&#x27;s company almost continually. Bouts of depression and hostility Penny experienced over a period of about two years during this time were initially mysterious, but the couple eventually diagnosed these symptoms as being the result of food allergies. After a change in her diet, the symptoms were brought under control.

===Coos Bay, Oregon, and the Ken Keyes College===
In 1982, the leader with whom Keyes had clashed left Cornucopia, taking much of the staff with her. The organization sold the Cornucopia property and relocated along with Keyes to [Coos Bay, Oregon], in an old four-story hospital building. They chose Coos Bay because it was said to be a place least likely to be attacked in a nuclear war. There they continued to give workshops and write books for about four years, before deciding to open a formal training school for the Living Love method, which they called the Ken Keyes College. The first enrolled group numbered almost a hundred.

In 1982, Keyes published &quot;The Hundredth Monkey&quot;, a book about how to prevent nuclear war.

Late in 1986, during the college&#x27;s first nine-month training course, Keyes developed pneumonia. He was admitted to the hospital and eventually put on a ventilator. He credited his use of the Living Love methods with enabling him to summon the strength and serenity to remain calm and upbeat about his situation and to visualize healing for his lungs. Although there had initially been some doubt about his physical viability, he was able to come off the respirator and breathe again on his own. He left the hospital and resumed training the inaugural group of students at the college, who graduated in May 1987.

With international lawyer Benjamin Ferencz, Keyes wrote another book on world politics, &quot;PlanetHood&quot;.

==Final years==
Keyes and Penny eventually were divorced and the Ken Keyes College closed. In 1990, Keyes began studying inner-child healing and the rapid-eye-movement therapy developed by Francine Shapiro. He established the Caring Rapid Healing Center in Coos Bay to do private multi-day counseling workshops in this area, and wrote his final book, &quot;Your Road Map to Lifelong Happiness&quot;, on these topics.

Keyes married a fourth wife, Lydia, who survived him. He died of kidney failure in 1995. He was also survived by his children, Ken Keyes III and Clara Hardin.

==Influence and legacy==

In his life Keyes sold or distributed millions of books, lectured to many people, spoke to dignitaries at political gatherings, and knew and moved among the self-help elite, including Wayne Dyer, who said that Keyes &quot;literally got me started on this glorious transformational journey.&quot; His books are still available thirteen years after his death, and a small group of his students maintain ties and carry on his methods. However, Keyes&#x27; organization essentially died with him.

Keyes employed no explicit strategies to ensure his organization would continue or grow without him, and he did nothing that would promote any established organization or personal legacy. He focused, instead, on teaching his methods. He never sought out a major publisher for his books, but self-published them all, and even brought back in-house one book that had been placed with a major publisher. Of the three teaching centers he founded, only the last was eponymous.

<text>The Olympic Museum () in Lausanne, Switzerland houses permanent and temporary exhibits relating to sport and the Olympic movement. With more than 10,000 artifacts, the museum is the largest archive of Olympic Games memorabilia in the world and one of Lausanne&#x27;s prime tourist site draws attracting more than 250,000 visitors each year.

The Olympic Museum and the Olympic Park (sculpture garden between the museum and Lake Léman) are located at Ouchy, south of Lausanne. The headquarters of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) are located at Vidy, to the west of Ouchy.

== History ==
The museum was founded on 23 June 1993, on the initiative of then-president of the IOC Juan Antonio Samaranch. Mexican architect Pedro Ramírez Vázquez, an International Olympic Committee member, and Jean-Pierre Cahen, were in charge of the project. The museum was named the European Museum of the Year in 1995.

After 23 months of renovation between 2012 and 2013, the Olympic Museum re-opened on 21 December 2013. During the transformations of the building, a temporary exhibition was set up in a boat (&quot;Helvétie&quot;) of the CGN, in front of the Olympic Park.

With the renovation, the surface of the museum increased from (in 2011) to (in 2013).

==Exhibits==
The permanent exhibition is organized into three major themes on three separate floors: Olympic World, Olympic Games, and Olympic Spirit. A visit begins on the third floor, where the Olympic World part of the exhibition informs visitors of the history of the ancient Olympic Games and the rebirth of the modern Games in the 19th century. Highlights include a display of Olympic torches, as well as a video documenting major moments in the history of opening ceremonies history.

The second floor focuses on Olympic Games. Sporting equipment for a variety of sports are on display, and visitors are introduced to the Youth Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games. More than 1,000 video clips of Olympic Games events and athletes can be searched and viewed at individual viewing stations.

The final part of the permanent exhibit covers the Olympic Spirit, where visitors are made to feel part of an Olympic Village and can test their balance, agility, and mental skills with interactive exercises. Olympic medals are also on display.

The renovated museum also includes a temporary exhibit space, where the museum regularly hosts traveling exhibits.

== Olympic Park ==
The Olympic Museum is surrounded by a park containing numerous works of art on the theme of sports. Among the most notable works of art in the museum&#x27;s permanent collection are the French sculptors Auguste Rodin&#x27;s &quot;The American Athlete&quot; and Niki de Saint Phalle&#x27;s &quot;Les Footballeurs&quot;, the Luxembourgish sculptor Lucien Wercollier&#x27;s tribute to the pole vault titled &quot;Altius&quot;, the Colombian sculptor Fernando Botero&#x27;s &quot;Jeune Fille a la Balle&quot;, and a kinetic art sculpture by the Swiss sculptor Jean Tinguely which combines a hockey stick, a boar&#x27;s head, and a motorbike wheel.

<doc id="856080" wikidata="Q896206" url="?curid=856080" title="Malmedy massacre trial">
<text>The Malmedy massacre trial (&quot;U.S. vs. Valentin Bersin, et al.&quot;) was held in May–July 1946 in the former Dachau concentration camp to try the German Waffen-SS soldiers accused of the Malmedy massacre of 17 December 1944. The highest-ranking defendant was the former Waffen-SS general Sepp Dietrich.

==Malmedy massacre==

The Malmedy massacre (17 December 1944) was a series of war crimes committed by the Waffen-SS &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; against American prisoners of war and Belgian civilians during the Battle of the Bulge (16 December 1944 – 25 January 1945). The Waffen-SS massacre of 84 U.S. Army POWs near Baugnez was the primary subject of the war-crime trial, which was one of a series of war crimes that the Waffen-SS &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; committed between mid-December 1944 and mid-January 1945. In the course of their massacres, the Waffen-SS murdered POWs with close-range gunshots to the head; the actual number of dead was 362 American POWs and 111 Belgian civilians.
The U.S. soldiers who survived the Malmedy massacre said that on 17 December 1944, in the vicinity of Baugnez, the armored advance of the Waffen-SS &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; surprised approximately 120 U.S. Army soldiers from the 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion (FAOB) who surrendered after a brief battle. The Waffen-SS then assembled their U.S. POWs in a field near the Baugnez crossroads, and then used machine guns to kill them.

The SS machine gun fire alerted and panicked the U.S. Army POWs; some soldiers fled the killing field, other soldiers were killed where they stood; and other soldiers ran to and hid in a café at the Baugnez crossroads, which the Waffen-SS soldiers set afire, and then shot dead every U.S. soldier who tried to escape the burning building. Meanwhile, at the killing field, the Waffen-SS soldiers walked among the American corpses to find and kill any G.I. pretending to be dead. Among the 84 murdered soldiers, many corpses had head-shot wounds consistent with a massacre rather than with wounds suffered in self-defense or with wounds suffered while escaping summary execution by machine gun.

On 13 January 1945, the U.S. Army secured the crossroads at Baugnez where the Waffen-SS &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot; had massacred their U.S. Army POWs. The corpses of the soldiers of the 285th Field Artillery Observation Battalion were recovered on 14–15 January 1945; the winter weather preserved the flesh and the wounds. The autopsies revealed that approximately twenty of the murdered American soldiers had close-range gunshot wounds to the head — the &quot;coup de grâce&quot; that ends the life of a fatally-wounded soldier. The head-shot wounds were additional to the gunshot wounds made by the machine guns of the initial gunfire of the massacre. Twenty other soldier corpses showed small-calibre gunshot wounds to the head, without powder-burn residue; 10 corpses had blunt-trauma injuries, likely from having been butt-stroked to death; some corpses showed a single gunshot wound, either to the temple or behind the ear.

U.S. Army investigators established that most of the G.I. corpses were in a very small area, which location suggested that the Waffen-SS had assembled and summarily executed their U.S. POWs as quickly as possible after capture. Later, under custody of the U.S. Army, Waffen-SS POWs testified that some American POWs had tried to escape the shootings; other Waffen-SS POWs said that some of the American POWs had recovered their own weapons, and then fired upon Waffen-SS soldiers en route to Ligneuville.

==Trial proceedings==
The trial of &quot;US vs. Valentin Bersin et al.&quot;, Case Number 6-24 (May–July 1946), was one of the Dachau Trials that were held from 1945 to 1947. The tribunal of U.S. Army officers tried 74 &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; officers and soldiers, most of whom had been members of the 1st SS Division Adolf Hitler Bodyguard. The defendants included &quot;SS-Oberst-Gruppenführer&quot; Sepp Dietrich, commander of the 6th Panzer Army, &quot;SS-Brigadeführer&quot; Fritz Krämer, &quot;SS-Gruppenführer&quot; Hermann Priess, commander of the I SS Panzer Corps, and &quot;SS-Standartenführer&quot; Joachim Peiper, commander of the 1st SS Panzer Regiment – the principal unit of &quot;Kampfgruppe Peiper&quot;, who committed the massacre at Malmedy, Belgium.

There were originally 75 suspects. However, one of them, 18-year-old Arvid Freimuth, killed himself before the trial started. Another, Marcel Boltz, had his case withdrawn upon the request of the French government since he was a French national. They were going to prosecute Boltz themselves, but dropped the case since they didn&#x27;t think the evidence was strong enough.

Col. Willis M. Everett Jr. (USA) led the defence team, and Col. Burton Ellis (USA) led the prosecution team in the trial of the &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; war criminals indicted for the massacres of more than 300 US Army POWs &quot;in the vicinity of Malmedy, Honsfeld, Büllingen, Ligneuville, Stoumont, La Gleize, Cheneux, Petit Thier, Trois Ponts, Stavelot, Wanne and Lutrebois&quot; and the massacre of 100 Belgian civilians at Stavelot, during the 16 December 1944—13 January 1945 period at the time of the Battle of the Bulge.

In the course of the Malmedy Massacre Trial, six &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; defendants, including Peiper, complained to the tribunal that they had been victims of physical violence and threats of violence meant to compel them to confessions of their war crimes. The military tribunal asked the defendants to confirm their sworn statements; of the nine &quot;Waffen-SS&quot; officers who testified, three claimed to have been mistreated by U.S. Army jailers.

For the majority of the Nazis on trial, the defense argued they either had not participated in the massacres, or that superior orders had compelled them to participate in the massacres.

==Verdicts==
On 16 July 1946 the verdict was delivered on 73 members of the Kampfgruppe Peiper. 43 were sentenced to death by hanging, including Peiper. Peiper&#x27;s sentence was commuted to 35 years in 1954, and he was released in December 1956.

Approximately sixteen months after the end of the trial, almost all the defendants presented affidavits repudiating their former confessions and alleging aggravated duress of all types.

===Review procedure===
Pursuant to procedure, an in-house review was undertaken by the American Occupation Army in Germany; the trial was carefully examined by a deputy judge. Colonel Everett was convinced that a fair trial had not been granted to the defendants: in addition to alleged mock trials, he claimed that &quot;to extort confessions, U.S. prosecution teams &#x27;had kept the German defendants in dark, solitary confinement at near starvation rations up to six months; had applied various forms of torture, including the driving of burning matches under the prisoners&#x27; fingernails; had administered beatings which resulted in broken jaws and arms and permanently injured testicles&#x27;.&quot;

===The Simpson Commission===
The turmoil raised by this case caused the Secretary of the Army, Kenneth Royall, to create a commission, chaired by Justice Gordon Simpson of the Texas Supreme Court, to investigate. The commission supported Everett&#x27;s accusations regarding mock trials and neither disputed nor denied his charges of torture of the defendants. The Commission expressed the opinion that the pre-trial investigation had not been properly conducted and that the members felt no death sentence should be executed in any instance where such doubts existed.

One member of the commission, Judge Edward L. Van Roden of Pennsylvania, allegedly made several public statements claiming that physical violence had been inflicted on the accused and questioned the validity of the hearings. James Finucane, an official of the National Council for the Prevention of War, said that he heard Van Roden &quot;had made some shocking statements&quot; at a meeting of the Federal Bar Association, and that when Finucane approached Van Roden to verify the report, Van Roden invited him to hear him speak on the same subject at the Rotary Club. The National Council for the Prevention of War made a press release on December 18, 1948, publicizing this speech, which the editor of &quot;The Progressive&quot; asked to run as a partly-ghostwritten article under Van Roden&#x27;s byline. After Finucane spoke with Van Roden by telephone to get his permission and discuss revisions to the article, it ran in the February 1949 issue of the magazine.

The press release and article greatly inflamed the public scandal, especially with the statement that &quot;all but two of the Germans in the 139 cases we investigated had been kicked in the testicles beyond repair. This was standard operating procedure with our American investigators.&quot; Finucane later testified that this was what he understood Van Roden to have said, albeit he had used &quot;the Army language, which a person like he would use,&quot; and that he had read the statement back to Van Roden over the telephone and Van Roden had not corrected it. However, Van Roden denied under oath ever making statements found in the article, including the specific claim about 137 cases of damaged testicles.

Van Roden refused to commute the six remaining death sentences, including that of Peiper, but the executions were postponed. By 1951, most of the men were released and the only remaining death sentences, those of Peiper and five others, were commuted. Sepp Dietrich was paroled in 1955. Joachim Peiper was paroled in 1956. In 1956, Dietrich was re-arrested for his role in the Night of the Long Knives. In 1957, he was convicted of being an accessory to manslaughter and sentenced to 18 months in prison. After his appeals failed, Dietrich reported to prison in August 1958. He was released on health grounds in February 1959.

===The Senate Subcommittee and Sen. Joseph McCarthy===
Eventually, the United States Senate decided to investigate. Ultimately, the case was entrusted to the Committee on Armed Services over the Judiciary Committee and the Committee on Expenditures in the Executive Departments. The investigation was entrusted to a subcommittee of three senators chaired by Raymond E. Baldwin (R-CT). The subcommittee was set up on 29 March 1949. Its members went to Germany and during its hearings, the commission heard from no fewer than 108 witnesses.

Joseph McCarthy (R-WI) had obtained from the subcommittee&#x27;s chairman authorization to attend the hearings. McCarthy&#x27;s state, Wisconsin, had a large population of German heritage, spurring allegations that McCarthy was politically motivated in his work on behalf of the Malmedy defendants. He used an extremely aggressive questioning style during the proceedings.

McCarthy&#x27;s actions further inflamed a split between the American Legion, which took a hardline position after Malmedy and generally supported upholding the death sentences, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, who supported more lenient penalties for the Waffen-SS members under Peiper. The last clash took place in May 1949 when he asked that Lieutenant William R. Perl be given a polygraph test. As this had been rejected by Baldwin, McCarthy left the session claiming Baldwin was trying to whitewash the American military.

In May and June 1949, Van Roden indicated that he had been misquoted in the statements that 137 Germans had been &quot;kicked in the testicles beyond repair&quot; and that this was &quot;standard operating procedure.&quot; He testified to the subcommittee that the statement that all but two of the men had been injured for life was &quot;exaggerated&quot; and &quot;absolutely wrong,&quot; that the Commission &quot;did not find that,&quot; that some of the men had been injured in their testicles but the commission could not find out how many, that he never said a specific number of men were kicked, that he did not know how many were kicked, that what he had said was that the commission had recommended commutation of the death sentences to life imprisonment in all but two cases (with commutation to finite prison sentences recommended in the last two), that he categorically denied that all but two were kicked in the testicles, that these two sentences should have been deleted from the article before publication, and that his failure to object to them earlier was an &quot;oversight.&quot;

Chairman Senators Raymond Baldwin and Lester C. Hunt (D-WY) were later accused by historian David Oshinsky of being &quot;determined to exonerate the Army at all costs&quot;. Oshinsky alleged the third member of the three man committee, Senator Estes Kefauver (D-TN), displayed a lack of interest in the case, attending only two of the first fifteen hearings. McCarthy sought to denounce Baldwin in front of the whole Senate, but his efforts were repudiated by the Commission on Armed Forces, which clearly showed its support for Baldwin and eventually adopted the subcommittee&#x27;s official report.

It was later found that McCarthy had received &quot;evidence&quot; of the false torture claims from , a prominent Neo-Nazi agitator who often served as a defense attorney for Nazi war criminals, such as Einsatzgruppen commander Otto Ohlendorf.

===The subcommittee report===
In its report, the subcommittee rejected the most serious charges, including beatings, torture, mock executions, and starvation of the defendants. In addition, the subcommittee determined that commutations of sentences pronounced by General Clay had occurred because of the U.S. Army&#x27;s recognition that procedural irregularities could have occurred during the trial. The commission did not exonerate the defendants or absolve them of guilt and it endorsed the conclusions General Clay issued in the particular case of Lieutenant Christ. In summary, Clay had written that &quot;he was personally convinced of the culpability of Lieutenant Christ and, that for this reason his death sentence was fully justified. But, to apply this sentence would be equivalent accepting a bad administration of justice, which led [him], not without reserve, to commute the death penalty to life imprisonment&quot;.

<text>Belavia, formally Belavia Belarusian Airlines (; ), is the flag carrier of Belarus, headquartered in Minsk. The state-owned company had, as of 2007, 1,017 employees. Belavia serves a network of routes between Commonwealth of Independent States, as well as some Middle East destinations, from its base at Minsk National Airport.

Following the Ryanair Flight 4978 incident on 23 May 2021, the airline has been banned from the European Union, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and Ukraine.

==History==
===Early years===

On 7 November 1933, the first Belarusian air terminal opened in Minsk. In the next spring, 3 Po-2 aircraft landed in Minsk. They became the first aircraft of the Belarusian air fleet. In 1936 the first regular air route between Minsk and Moscow was established. In the summer of 1940, the Belarusian civil aviation group was officially founded.

===Development during the 2000s===
Between 2003 and 2009, the airline saw its passenger numbers double and in 2009 handled just under 700,000 customers.

Three leased Bombardier CRJ 100 aircraft were introduced on regional services from Minsk. The first one was delivered in February 2007, with the other two later in 2007. They directly replaced the aging Antonov An-24 and Tupolev Tu-134 aircraft. It was looking to lease two Bombardier CRJ-700s in 2010. Belavia had also planned to retire its remaining Tupolev Tu-154Ms by 2011 following the retirement of its last Tupolev Tu-134 in summer 2009 which was replaced by an ex-FlyLAL Boeing 737-500. On 27 June 2014, an order was announced for three Boeing 737-800 aircraft to be acquired directly by Belavia. The first of these was delivered in August 2016.

In August 2016, Belavia received their first aircraft with their new livery. This is the first re-branding since the company&#x27;s founding in 1996 on its 20 years anniversary. The new livery was applied a brand new Boeing 737-800. The much newer 737s replaced the aging Tupolev Tu-154s. On 1 October 2016, Belavia retired their two remaining Tupolev Tu-154s from scheduled services as one of the last airlines worldwide to do so.

In 2019, the company employed nearly 1,900 people, and generated a turnover of 374 million euros with an operating result of 49 million euros. During this year it carried almost 4 million passengers, an increase of more than 15% compared to the 2018 figure.

Several employees who participated in 2020 Belarusian protests were forced to leave their jobs.

===Sanctions from 2021===
On 24 May 2021, the British government suspended Belavia&#x27;s operating permit in response to the Ryanair Flight 4978 incident. The European Union and Ukraine subsequently banned Belarusian airliners from entering their airspace or using their airports, effectively banning Belavia which led to the suspension of vast parts of their route network.

Also in 2021, Belavia was accused of orchestrating the influx of illegal migrants during the Belarus–European Union border crisis. In September 2021 it has been reported that Belavia might face to lose the majority of its current fleet as its lessors might be no longer allowed to lease them out to Belarusian airlines as part of new embargoes. At this point Belavia owned 18 smaller, older aircraft, but had rented several modern jets from Western companies, with the Irish AerCap with six and the Danish Nordic Aviation Capital with seven aircraft being the most important suppliers. On 16 November, the European Union confirmed the termination of all aircraft leases to Belarus by European lessors, which forces the airline to return half of their current fleet on short notice.

On 2 December 2021, Belavia was added to the sanctions list of the European Union. Switzerland joined the EU sanctions on 20 December. On 8 April 2022, the US Department of Commerce restricted flights on Belarusian owned or operated aircraft manufactured in the US along with Aeroflot, Aviastar, Azur Air, Rossiya and Utair from flying into Belarus or Russia. On 16 June 2022 the US broadened its restrictions on Belavia after violations of the sanctions&#x27; regime were detected. The effect of the restrictions is to ground the US-manufactured part of its fleet.

In August 2023, the United States added Belavia to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List.

In February 2024, Grodno Aviakompania, the only other passenger operator of the country, was merged and incorporated into Belavia by decree from the Ministry of Transport and Communications.

== Destinations ==

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Belavia operated flights to Asia, Europe, and Africa from its base at Minsk National Airport. In addition to scheduled destinations listed here, Belavia operates charter flights to leisure destinations and VIP charters. On the eve of the Ryanair Flight 4978 forced takedown incident, it served one domestic destination and 54 international destinations in 32 countries. As a result of the subsequent ban on Belarusian airliners entering the EU, UK and Ukrainian airspace, the airline is effectively stripped off all but twenty of these destinations: owing to the geographical constraints, access to Chișinău (Moldova), Kaliningrad (Russia), and Belgrade (Serbia) has become &quot;de facto&quot; impossible, despite these three non-EU member states not having issued any independent travel bans on Belavia. On 28 May 2021, the airline confirmed the cancellation of flights that would otherwise be forced to pass through restricted airspace as well as their ongoing efforts to reroute the Istanbul, Turkey, connection, up to this point handled using a straight route over Ukraine, Moldova, Romania as well as Bulgaria&#x27;s territorial waters.

As of November 2023, the airline serves 11 countries on 22 routes.

===Historic fleet===
==Incidents and accidents==
*On 6 January 2003, a Yakovlev Yak-40 suffered a shattered windshield during a flight, en route to Prague. Two Czech Air Force fighters accompanied the plane to a safe landing in Ruzyně International Airport.
*On 14 February 2008, Belavia Flight 1834, a Bombardier CRJ100ER en route from Yerevan, Armenia, to Minsk, hit its left wing on the runway during takeoff from Zvartnots International Airport, subsequently crashing on the ground, flipping over and coming to a stop inverted near the runway. All 18 passengers and 3 crew members managed to escape the aircraft before it erupted into flames, partly due to the timely response of the fire and rescue crew at the airport. The main cause of the crash was icing contamination leading to a stall of the left wing.

<text>A block error is a common type of error in certain types of digital television transmission, particularly those that use image compression. Its presence in a television image is a telltale sign that 1) the signal is broadcast digitally, as this type of error can not occur in analog transmission, and 2) that there is a significant amount of noise, as digital television is designed to tolerate a certain amount of interference. Block errors are usually detected, but not corrected, by the receiving device and are commonly displayed as empty black boxes in the television image.

Because of how television images are usually compressed, a block error in a single frame often results in black boxes in several subsequent frames. In the worst case, a few block errors per frame could render the video from a television broadcast unviewable.

Block errors are most common in digital satellite television, where bad weather or motion of the satellite dish can cause interference outside the broadcaster&#x27;s control.

Block errors can occur at levels of interference where an analog transmission would be fuzzy but still viewable. Thus, block errors are a fine example of the consequences of trade offs in engineering. Although in ideal conditions, digital transmission far exceeds analog transmission in performance, below a certain threshold of signal-to-noise ratio, digital transmission becomes untenable.</text><links>

<doc id="856097" wikidata="Q828553" url="?curid=856097" title="Brooklyn Heights">
<text>Brooklyn Heights is a residential neighborhood within the New York City borough of Brooklyn. The neighborhood is bounded by Old Fulton Street near the Brooklyn Bridge on the north, Cadman Plaza West on the east, Atlantic Avenue on the south, and the Brooklyn–Queens Expressway or the East River on the west. Adjacent neighborhoods are Dumbo to the north, Downtown Brooklyn to the east, and Cobble Hill and Boerum Hill to the south.

Originally referred to as Brooklyn Village, it has been a prominent area of Brooklyn since 1834. The neighborhood is noted for its low-rise architecture and its many brownstone rowhouses, most of them built prior to the Civil War. It also has an abundance of notable churches and other religious institutions. Brooklyn&#x27;s first art gallery, the Brooklyn Arts Gallery, was opened in Brooklyn Heights in 1958. In 1965, a large part of Brooklyn Heights was protected from unchecked development by the creation of the Brooklyn Heights Historic District, the first such district in New York City. The district was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966.

Directly across the East River from Manhattan and connected to it by subways and regular ferry service, Brooklyn Heights is also easily accessible from Downtown Brooklyn. Columbia Heights, an upscale six-block-long street next to the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, is sometimes considered to be its own neighborhood.

Brooklyn Heights is part of Brooklyn Community District 2, and its primary ZIP Code is 11201. It is patrolled by the 84th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. The New York City Fire Department operates two fire stations near Brooklyn Heights: Engine Company 205/Ladder Company 118 at 74 Middagh Street, and Engine Company 224 at 274 Hicks Street.

==History==

===Early settlement===
Brooklyn Heights occupies a plateau on a high bluff that rises sharply from the river&#x27;s edge and gradually recedes on the landward side. Before the Dutch settled on Long Island in the middle of the seventeenth century, this promontory was called Ihpetonga (&quot;the high sandy bank&quot;) by the native Lenape American Indians.

Ferries across the East River were running as early as 1642, serving the farms in the area. The most significant of the ferries went between the current Fulton Street and Peck Slip in Manhattan, and was run by Cornelius Dirksen. The ferry service helped the lowland area to thrive, with both farms and some factories along the water, but the higher ground was sparsely used.

The area was heavily fortified prior to the Battle of Long Island in the American Revolutionary War. After British troops landed on Long Island and advanced towards Continental Army lines, General George Washington withdrew his troops here after heavy losses, but was able to make a skillful retreat across the East River to Manhattan without the loss of any troops or his remaining supplies.

After the war, the 160-acre tract of land belonging to John Rapeljie, who was a Loyalist, was confiscated and sold to the Sands brothers, who tried to develop the part of the land on the palisade as a community they called &quot;Olympia&quot;, but failed to make it come about, partly because of the difficulty of building there. They later sold part of their land to John Jackson, who created the Vinegar Hill community, much of which later became the Brooklyn Navy Yard.

===Development===
Brooklyn Heights began to develop once Robert Fulton&#x27;s New York and Brooklyn Steam Ferry Boat Company began regularly scheduled steam ferry service in 1814, with the financial backing of Hezekiah Beers Pierrepont, one of the area&#x27;s major landowners. Pierrepont had accumulated 60 acres of land, including 800 feet which directly overlooked the harbor, all of which he planned to sub-divide. Since his intention was to sell to merchants and bankers who lived in Manhattan, he needed easy access between Brooklyn Heights and New York City, which Fulton&#x27;s company provided. Pierrepont bought – part of the Livingston estate, plus the Benson, De Bevoise and Reemsen farms – on what was then called &quot;Clover Hill&quot;, now Brooklyn Heights, and built a mansion there. Pierrepont purchased and expanded Philip Livingston&#x27;s gin distillery on the East River at what is now Joralemon Street, where he produced Anchor Gin.
Wishing to sub-divide and develop his property, Pierrepont realized the need for regularly scheduled ferry service across the East River, and to this end he became a prominent investor in Robert Fulton&#x27;s New York and Brooklyn Steam Ferry Boat Company, using his influence on Fulton&#x27;s behalf; he eventually became a part owner and a director of the company. Fulton&#x27;s ferry began running in 1814, and Brooklyn received a charter as a village from the state of New York in 1816, thanks to the influence of Pierrepont and other prominent landowners. The city then prepared for the establishment of a street grid, although there were competing plans for the size of the lots. John and Jacob Hicks, who also owned property on Brooklyn Heights, north of Pierrepont&#x27;s, favored smaller lots, as they were pitching their land to tradesman and artisans already living in Brooklyn, not attempting to lure merchants and bankers from Manhattan as Pierrepont was. To counter the Hickses&#x27; proposal, Pierrepont hired the surveyors Jeremiah Lott and Thomas Poppleton and submitted an alternative. In the end, the Hickses&#x27; plan was adopted north of Clark Street, and Pierrepont&#x27;s plan south of it.

Thanks to the influence of Pierrepont and other landowners, Brooklyn received a charter from the state as a village in 1816, which led to streets being laid out in a regular grid pattern, sidewalks being laid, water pumps being installed and the institution of a watch. After 1823, farms begin to be sub-divided into lots, which were advertised as suitable for a &quot;country retreat&quot; for Manhattanites, leading to a building boom that resulted in Brooklyn Heights becoming the &quot;first commuter suburb&quot;, since it was easier and faster to get to Manhattan by ferry than it was to commute from upper Manhattan by ground transportation. A resident of the Heights could leave the office at three o&#x27;clock, have dinner at home at four o&#x27;clock, and still have time for a &quot;leisurely drive to the outskirts of town&quot;, a &quot;middle class paradise&quot;. The community&#x27;s development was helped by the yellow fever epidemic of 1822, when many of the rich from the city abandoned it for an area that was advertised as &quot;elevated and perfectly healthy at all seasons ... a select neighborhood and circle of society.&quot;

Where there had been only seven houses in the Heights in 1807, by 1860 there were over six hundred of them, and by 1890 the area was almost completely developed. The buildings were designed in a wide variety of styles; development started in the northern part, and moved southward, so the architecture general changes in that direction as the preferred style of the time changed over the decades. Throughout the 19th century, Brooklyn Heights remained an elegant neighborhood, and became Brooklyn&#x27;s cultural and financial center. Its development gave rise to offshoots such as Cobble Hill and, later, Carroll Gardens.

Prior to the Civil War, Brooklyn Heights was a locus of the Abolitionist movement, due to the speeches and activities of Henry Ward Beecher, the pastor of Plymouth Church, now the Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims. Beecher was a nationally known figure famous on the lecture circuit for his novel oratorical style, in which he employed humor, dialect, and slang. Under Beecher, so many slaves passed through Plymouth Church on their way to freedom in Canada that later generations have referred to the church as the &quot;Grand Central Station of the Underground Railroad&quot;. To dramatize the plight of those held in captivity, Beecher once brought a female slave to the church and held an auction, with the highest bidder purchasing not the slave, but her freedom. Beecher also raised money to buy other slaves out of captivity, and shipped rifles to abolitionists in Kansas and Nebraska in crates labelled &quot;Bibles&quot;, which gave the rifles the nickname &quot;Beecher&#x27;s Bibles&quot;.

===20th century===

The completion of the now historic Brooklyn Bridge in 1883, the Brooklyn end of which was near Brooklyn Heights&#x27; eastern boundary, began the process of making the neighborhood more accessible from places such as Manhattan. The Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT)&#x27;s Lexington Avenue subway line, which reached Brooklyn Heights in 1908, was an even more powerful catalyst in the neighborhood&#x27;s development. The resulting ease of transportation into the neighborhood and the perceived loss of the specialness and &quot;quality&quot; began to drive out the merchants and patricians who lived there; in time their mansions were divided to become apartment houses and boarding houses. Artists began to move into the neighborhood, as well as writers, and a number of large hotels – the St. George (1885), the Margaret (1889), the Bossert (1909), Leverich Towers (1928), and the Pierrepont (1928), among others – were constructed. By the beginning of the Great Depression, most of the middle class had left the area. Boarding houses had become rooming houses, and the neighborhood began to have the appearance of a slum.

During the 1940s and 1950s, the building of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway (BQE) badly affected the neighborhood, as it took away the neighborhood&#x27;s northwest corner, destroying whole rows of brownstones. At about the same time, plans began to be developed by New York&#x27;s &quot;master builder&quot;, Robert Moses, wielding the Housing Act of 1949, to replace brownstone rowhouses – which were the typical building form in the neighborhood – with large luxury apartment buildings. A prominent example of the intended outcome is the Cadman Plaza development of housing cooperatives in the northern part of the neighborhood, located on the site where the Brooklyn Bridge trolley terminal once stood. In 1959, the North Heights Community Group was formed to oppose destroying cheap low-rise housing in order to build the high-rise Cadman Plaza towers. Architect Percival Goodman presented an alternate plan to maintain all sound structures, which garnered 25,000 supporters. In early 1961, a compromise proposal came from City Hall calling for two 22-story towers with over 1,200 luxury and middle income units. The Brooklyn Heights Association fully supported the compromise plan despite strong opposition from the preservation community, including the North Heights Community Group. As a result, 1,200 residents were removed from their houses and apartments in late 1961 and early 1962 as construction began on the modified plan.

One positive development came about when community groups – prominently the Brooklyn Heights Association, founded in 1910 – joined with Moses in the creation of the Brooklyn Heights Promenade, also called the Esplanade, which was cantilevered over the BQE. It became a favorite spot among locals, offering magnificent vistas of the Statue of Liberty, the Manhattan skyline across the East River, the Brooklyn Bridge, the Manhattan Bridge, and spectacular fireworks displays over the East River. Moses originally proposed to build the BQE through the heart of Brooklyn Heights. Opposition to this plan led to the re-routing of the expressway to the side of the bluff, allowing creation of the Promenade.

By the mid-1950s, a new generation of property owners had begun moving into the Heights, pioneering the &quot;Brownstone Revival&quot; by buying and renovating pre-Civil War period houses, which became part of the preservationist movement which culminated in the passage in 1965 of the Landmarks Preservation Law. In 1965, community groups which later became the Brooklyn Heights Association, succeeded in having the neighborhood designated the Brooklyn Heights Historic District by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, the first such district in the city. This was followed in the following decades by the further gentrification of the neighborhood into a firmly middle-class area, which became &quot;one of New York City&#x27;s most pleasant and attractive neighborhoods.&quot;

===21st century===
Starting in 2008, Brooklyn Bridge Park was built along the shoreline of the East River. the park was 90% complete, and it is now completely renovated. The Squibb Park Bridge was constructed in 2013 to provide access between the park and the rest of Brooklyn Heights, but had to be demolished in 2019 due to various structural issues. A replacement bridge opened in 2020. By the early 2020s, increasing numbers of celebrities were moving to the neighborhood.

==Architecture and places of interest==
Brooklyn Heights was the first neighborhood protected by the 1965 Landmarks Preservation Law of New York City. The neighborhood is largely composed of blocks of picturesque rowhouses and a few mansions. A great range of architectural styles is represented, including Greek Revival, Italianate, Second Empire, Victorian Gothic, Romanesque, Neo-Grec, and Classical Revival, as well as a few 2/1/2-story late Federal houses from the early 19th century in the northern part of the neighborhood. Some houses were constructed of brick, but the dominant building material was brownstone or &quot;Jersey freestone&quot;, a reddish-brown stone from Passaic County, New Jersey.

A typical brownstone rowhouse was three or four stories tall, with the main floor above the street level and reached by stairs, referred to as a &quot;stoop&quot;, a word derived from Dutch. The basement is typically a half-flight down from the street, and was used as the work area for servants, including the kitchen. The first floor would be the location of the public rooms, bedrooms were on the second floor, and servants&#x27; quarters were on the top floor. The rear of the lot would feature a private garden. Aside from rowhouses, a number of houses, particularly along Pierrepont Street and Pierrepont Place, are authentic mansions.

The concentration of over 600 pre-Civil War houses, one of the largest ensembles of such housing in the nation, and the human scale of the three, four- and five-story buildings creates a neighborly atmosphere.

Brooklyn Heights has very few high-rise buildings. Among these buildings are 75 Livingston Street, Hotel St. George, and the Concord Village co-op development on Adams Street. Additionally, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses had its world headquarters in the northern part of Brooklyn Heights at 25 Columbia Heights. The organization restored a number of historic buildings to house their staff, including the former Hotel Bossert, once the seasonal home of many Dodgers players, on Montague Street. In 2010, the organization announced plans to begin selling off its numerous properties in the Heights and nearby downtown Brooklyn, given that it plans to relocate itself in upstate New York.

The executive offices of the Brooklyn Dodgers were, for many years, located in the Heights, near the intersection of Montague and Court Streets. A plaque on the office building that replaced the Dodgers&#x27; old headquarters at 215 Montague Street identifies it as the site where Jackie Robinson signed his major league contract.

Plymouth Church of the Pilgrims and Our Lady of Lebanon Maronite Catholic Cathedral are located in Brooklyn Heights, as are the First Unitarian Congregational Society, the Long Island Historical Society, Packer Collegiate Institute, and St. Ann&#x27;s and the Holy Trinity Church, among other historically notable buildings. A number of bank buildings are concentrated on Montague Street, including the Brooklyn Trust Company Building, the People&#x27;s Trust Building, and the National Title Guaranty Building.

Concerning the &quot;fruit streets&quot; in Brooklyn Heights – Cranberry, Orange and Pineapple Streets – the &quot;WPA Guide to New York City&quot; reports that before the Civil War, these streets, along with Poplar and Willow Streets, were named after prominent families, but that a member of the Middagh family expressed her dislike of these families by replacing the street signs with botanical names. The city would restore the proper names, and Middagh would put back her own signs. Several iterations of this game ended when Middagh&#x27;s new names were given official status by a resolution of the alderman. In &quot;Historically Speaking&quot;, Brooklyn borough historian John B. Manbeck says only that these street names &quot;have questionable origins&quot;, as does Love Lane, which reputedly gets its name from the meetings that took place there between a pretty girl who lived nearby and her suitors.

<doc id="856102" wikidata="Q349488" url="?curid=856102" title="Adam Garcia">
<text>Adam Garcia is an Australian stage, television, and film actor who is best known for lead roles in musicals such as &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; and &quot;Kiss Me, Kate&quot;. He is also a trained tap dancer and singer. Garcia has been nominated twice at the Laurence Olivier Awards in 1999 and 2013.

==Early life==
Garcia is the son of Jean Balharry and Fabio Garcia. His mother is Australian, and his father is from Colombia. Garcia&#x27;s mother is a retired physiotherapist. Garcia attended Knox Grammar School where he completed his high school education. He also received formal tap dance training at Capital Dance Studio in Sydney, Australia. Garcia attended Sydney University, but did not complete his education as he left the university to take the role of Slide in the production of the musical &quot;Hot Shoe Shuffle&quot;, which toured Australia for two years before transferring to London, England.

== Career ==
Garcia began his film career in 1997, playing the role of Jones in Brian Gilbert&#x27;s &quot;Wilde&quot;. Garcia played Tony Manero in the stage version of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;, which premiered on 5 May 1998 at the London Palladium, and closed on 26 February 2000. He was nominated for his work in the play at the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical category in 1999, but lost to the cast of &quot;Kat and the Kings&quot;. Garcia also reached number 15 in the UK Singles Chart in 1998, with his cover version of the Bee Gees song &quot;Night Fever&quot;, taken from the film version of &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; (1977). In 2000, he played a major role in his second feature-film, &quot;Coyote Ugly&quot;. Later that year, Garcia also appeared in Dein Perry&#x27;s &quot;Bootmen&quot;, playing the lead role.

<text>The Battle of Aong took place on July 15, 1857, during the Indian rebellion of 1857, between the East India Company forces and Nana Sahib&#x27;s forces.

The East India Company forces under the command of General Sir Henry Havelock were advancing to Kanpur (Cawnpore), which had been besieged by Nana Sahib, supported by the rebel Company sepoys. Nana Sahib had earlier sent an army to check the advance of General Havelock to Kanpur, but it was defeated by Havelock&#x27;s forces at Fatehpur on July 12. Nana Sahib then sent another force under the command of his brother, Bala Rao.

On July 15, the British forces under General Havelock defeated Bala Rao&#x27;s army in the Battle of Aong, just outside the Aong village. During the battle, Havelock was able to capture some of the rebel soldiers, who informed him that there was an army of 5,000 rebel soldiers with eight artillery pieces further up the road. This enabled Havelock to decide his further strategy.

<text>The Allah Valley (at times also spelled Alah) is a large valley of the Allah River in the provinces of South Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat on the island of Mindanao, Philippines. It is formed by the Roxas-Matulas Range in the north and the Daguma Mountain Range in the south.

It is accessible via the Allah Valley Airport in Surallah, South Cotabato.

The valley is known for its natural environment, such as Lake Sebu, Lake Holon, Baras Bird Sanctuary, and Esperanza Hot and Cold Springs. On the other hand, it is adversely affected by flooding, siltation, riverbank migration, unstable agriculture production, and upland degradation, as well as illegal logging.

The entire valley was declared a watershed forest reserve in 1985 through the signing of Proclamation No. 2455. The protected area also includes Lake Sebu, the Tasaday-Manobo Special Forest Reserve, the Datu Ma Falen Civil Reservation, and the National Cultural Minorities Settlement Reservation located within the valley.

The bestselling Lonely Planet described Lake Sebu as a place located in a “bowl of forests and mountains.” The 42,450-hectare landscape consisting the domains of the Allah Valley is recognized by United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a cultural landscape in Mindanao.

==Geography==
It is a well populated valley with fertile soil, bisected by the Allah and Banga Rivers (tributaries of the Pulangi River). The placid lake of Lake Sebu can be found in the upper part of the Allah Valley. Its elevation ranges from .

The valley covers over the half of South Cotabato spanning 6 of the 10 municipalities of South Cotabato.

===Municipalities in the valley===
*Surallah
*T&#x27;boli
*Banga
*Norala
*Santo Niño
*Lake Sebu

==People==
As of 2007, Allah Valley is home to some 628,832 people, composed of Indigenous T&#x27;bolis, B&#x27;laan, Tirurays, Manobos and Maguindanaons and settlers from Luzon and Visayas.

==Economy==
The economy is based on agriculture producing mostly rice, maize, banana, pineapple, oil palm, and asparagus. Another source of income is aquaculture of tilapia in Lake Sebu.

Companies are starting to invest to build factories in the area especially in the municipalities of Surallah and Tboli. Especially eco-tourism is being promoted as a means to boost the region&#x27;s economy.

<doc id="856116" wikidata="Q711356" url="?curid=856116" title="Liu Ying (prince)">
<text>Liu Ying () (died 3 June 71) was a Chinese prince. He was a son of Emperor Guangwu of Han, and half-brother of Emperor Ming of Han. After becoming Prince of Chu, he was a known supporter of many religions. In particular, his sponsorship of Buddhism in 65 CE is the first documented case of Buddhist practices in China.

Born to Lady Xu (), a junior consort of Emperor Guangwu with the rank of &quot;meiren&quot;, Liu Ying was given the rank of duke on 22 May 39 CE, and prince (&quot;wáng&quot;) in the second half of 41 CE. The next year, he received Chu as his hereditary fiefdom, with his capital at Pengcheng (modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu). The young Liu Ying seems to have been close to his half-brother Liu Zhuang, the future Emperor Ming. He is also said to have travelled widely and gained an interest in Huang-Lao Daoism () and Buddhism (, literally &quot;Buddha&quot;). After Liu Ying became a prince, he actively supported both religions in the hope of finding a drug of longevity or immortality.

Because of these activities, Liu Ying was suspected of treasonous intrigue and the subject of an imperial edict from Emperor Ming. The edict, which survives in the &quot;Book of the Later Han&quot; shows that at the time the Buddha was associated in the opinion of the Chinese imperial court with Daoism. He was treated like a god to whom sacrifices and fasting took place. Buddhism was described as &quot;humane&quot; and generally accepted by the elite. Citing Liu Ying&#x27;s support of Daoism and Buddhism, Henri Maspero noted, &quot;It is a very curious fact that, throughout the whole Han dynasty, Taoism and Buddhism were constantly confused and appeared as a single religion.&quot;

Five years later, in December 70, Liu Ying&#x27;s activities were again denounced by high officials and he was accused of plotting against the throne, a crime punishable by death. Among his supposed crimes was the most heinous of those in Han law: usurping the prerogatives of the emperor, and great impropriety and immorality in his conduct toward the throne (). Nevertheless, Emperor Ming refused to execute Liu Ying, instead demoting him to the rank of a commoner and exiling him to Danyang in the lower Yangtze. Liu Ying committed suicide upon reaching his destination the next year. He was buried with the honours of a full marquess ().

As part of the purges following Liu Ying&#x27;s downfall, thousands of his supposed adherents were arrested and implicated each other under torture. Nevertheless, the Buddhist community at Pengcheng survived. More than a century later, it was still thriving under the patronage of Ze Rong, a native of Danyang. A number of Liu Ying&#x27;s followers may also have followed him to the lower Yangtze and established Buddhist communities there also.

<text>Sarcheshmeh (سرچشمه) or Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex ( – &quot;Kārkhāneh-ye Mojtame‘-e Mes-e Sar Cheshmeh&quot;) is a large open cast copper mine in the Kerman Province of Iran, considered to be the second largest copper deposit worldwide. Also containing substantial amounts of molybdenum, gold and other rare metals. It is also a settlement, enumerated at Iranian census.

The Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex is located 65 km southwest of Kerman and 50 km south of Rafsanjan. The region&#x27;s altitude averages about 2600m, the highest spot of which approximates 3000m. Sarcheshmeh ore bodies, situated in the central part of Zagros ranges, consist of folded and faulted early tertiary volcano-sedimentary rocks.

Sar Cheshmeh mine was managed by the Anaconda Group until the 1979 revolution in Iran. Design and construction of the processing plant was done by Parsons-Jurden of the US.

Production units of Sarcheshmeh Copper Complex involve the mine itself, concentrator, smelter, refinery, foundries and leaching.

Administratively, the settlement is in the Sarcheshmeh Rural District, in the Central District of Rafsanjan County, Kerman Province, Iran. At the 2006 census, its population was 53, in 14 families.

<doc id="856127" wikidata="Q7981412" url="?curid=856127" title="Wellington High School, New Zealand">
<text>Wellington High School is a co-educational secondary school in the CBD of Wellington, New Zealand. It has a role of approximately 1500 students. It was founded in 1886 as the Wellington College of Design (later the Wellington Technical School), to provide a more practical education than that offered by the existing schools. In 1905 it became the first coeducational daytime Technical College in New Zealand. It is one of only two coeducational secondary schools in Wellington (along with Onslow College), and one of only a handful in the country, that does not have a school uniform.

Many of the current buildings date from the 1980s and are in the neo-brutalist style.

Wellington High School, and the institutions from which the current school evolved, have a significant place in the history of public education in New Zealand.

==History==

=== Wellington College of Design and Wellington Technical School ===
What is now Wellington High School was founded in 1886 by Arthur Dewhurst Riley as the Wellington College of Design. It was the first technical school in New Zealand, the students were teenagers who had entered the workforce after primary school and the classes were trade focused and in the evenings. Students paid a fee&#x27;s to attend.

In 1891 the school became Wellington Technical School and it moved to its present site on Taranaki Street from Mercer Street in 1922. Riley was a pioneer of technical and vocational education in New Zealand and his views influenced the Manual and Technical Instruction Act of 1900.

=== Wellington Polytechnic ===
In 1964 the secondary and tertiary education parts separated, the upper part becoming Wellington Polytechnical School. Wellington Poly has now become Massey University&#x27;s Wellington Campus. Other technical schools have also gone on to become tertiary institutions, including Auckland University of Technology and Nelson Marlborough Institute of Technology.

=== Wellington High School ===
The secondary school retains a large community education programme.

In 2014, an additional Māori name was chosen to sit alongside the established and venerable name of Wellington High School; &quot;Te Kura Tuarua o Taraika ki Pukeahu&quot;. Māori language students were deeply involved in the planning and implementation of the additional name. Taraika is the name of the school Marae. Pukeahu is the area of land on which the school stands. The students presented their idea to the school’s whānau group, Te Whānau a Taraika and the school’s Board of Trustees as well as consultation undertaken with Taranaki Whānui ki Te Upoko o te Ika te mana whenua. The additional name was formally adopted at the school&#x27;s annual Whakanuia celebration in October 2014.

==Current affairs==
The School was New Zealand Trade and Enterprise Export Awards Education Exporter of the Year 2004.

In 2004, the school made the national headlines when students campaigned for the eviction of the Wellington branch of the Destiny Church, which was using the school hall for its services, with over 50% of enrolled students signing their names to a petition.

In 2006, in response to research on Wellington High students, and an award-winning student video, Principal Prue Kelly introduced a scheme which allows senior students&#x27; first classes to begin at 10:20am (as opposed to 8:45am). This issue has received much media coverage, and generated very little controversy. Principal Prue Kelly was confident that this progressive trial in timetable restructuring would &quot;catch on&quot; and other schools would begin to adopt it as well. 
As well as the senior 10 o&#x27;clock start, all years receive a late start on Wednesdays.

In 2016, Wellington High became the first school in Wellington to provide gender-neutral toilets. WHS converted one floor&#x27;s separate single sex bathrooms to two sets of gender-neutral bathrooms. The urinals were removed from the boys&#x27; bathrooms, and bins added. Signage simply says &#x27;bathroom.&#x27; There was a lot of media surrounding the change, and WHS released a media release requesting that the media accept the privacy of students, writing that they are now &quot;getting on with the business of learning.&quot; Later in 2016, Onslow College converted a block of their toilets to gender-neutral.

==Radio station==
The school had a student-run radio station, LiveWire, which transmitted at 107.1. It had a range of approximately 4 km. The radio station ceased broadcasting at the end of 2007. In February 2011, the radio station was revived as High-Fi FM. It is operated by students from the school. The radio station still has the same specifications of a 4 km broadcast range and runs 24/7 on 107.3FM.

==Board of trustees==

The Wellington High School board consists of eleven appointed and elected members. It is currently chaired by David Cooling.

<doc id="856143" wikidata="Q333700" url="?curid=856143" title="Roy Mason">
<text>Roy Mason, Baron Mason of Barnsley, (18 April 1924 – 19 April 2015), was a British Labour Party politician and Cabinet minister who was Secretary of State for Defence and Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in the 1970s.

==Early life==
Mason was born in Royston, West Riding of Yorkshire, on 18 April 1924, and grew up in Carlton, Barnsley, also in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Mason became a miner at the age of 14. He became a branch official of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) in his early twenties. Aged 26, he studied at the London School of Economics as a mature student on a Trades Union Congress (TUC) scholarship. He remained in the coal industry until he was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for the Barnsley constituency at a by-election in 1953.

==Posts==
Mason was Labour Party spokesman on Home Affairs, Defence and the Post Office, 1960–1964. Minister of State at the Board of Trade, 1964–1967. Minister of Defence (Equipment), 1967–1968. Minister of Power, 1968–1969. President of the Board of Trade, 1969–1970. Secretary of State for Defence, 1974–1976. Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, 1976–1979

==Northern Ireland==
A high-profile politician, Mason&#x27;s appointment to Northern Ireland was unexpected and seemed to indicate a tougher response from the British Government than had been pursued by his predecessor, Merlyn Rees. In late 1976, he told the Labour Party conference that &quot;Ulster had had enough of initiatives, White Papers and legislation for the time being, and now needed to be governed firmly and fairly&quot;. He rejected both military and political solutions in favour of &quot;justice for all; with equality before the law; and, crucially, with republican terrorism treated as a security problem, and nothing else&quot;.

While Secretary of State for Defence, Mason had been responsible for the introduction of SAS units into the &#x27;bandit country&#x27; of South Armagh. At Stormont Mason was responsible for the tougher role taken by the security forces and authorised an increase in British Army covert tactics with the SAS allowed to operate throughout Northern Ireland. Mason&#x27;s time in Northern Ireland was characterised by a reduction in violence; &quot;in 1976 there were 297 deaths in Northern Ireland; in the next three years the figures were 111, 80, 120. In 1977, he stood up to militant loyalists attempting to repeat their successful Ulster Workers Council strike tactic of 1974. The same year, he twice attempted to get some movement towards a political settlement from the local political parties. In March 1979, the Irish National Liberation Army planned to assassinate Mason, but the plan was aborted.

Mason&#x27;s policies in Northern Ireland earned the ire of Irish nationalist MPs. That played a part in the March 1979 vote of no confidence, which the Labour government lost by one vote, precipitating the 1979 general election. The Nationalist MP Gerry Fitt abstained in the vote of no confidence and stated that he could not support a government with Mason as its Northern Ireland secretary.

After Labour&#x27;s election defeat in 1979, Mason came under increasing pressure from some on the left in his constituency party and from Arthur Scargill but did not countenance joining the Social Democratic Party. Mason received full police protection over 30 years after leaving office. In 1982, Energy Secretary Nigel Lawson suggested to Margaret Thatcher that she should make Mason the next Coal Board chairman, but she refused by saying that Mason was &quot;Not one of us&quot;. Instead, Ian MacGregor was appointed.

==Later life==
After his retirement from the House of Commons at the 1987 general election, Mason was created a life peer on 20 October 1987 taking the title Baron Mason of Barnsley, of Barnsley in South Yorkshire. He lived in the same semi-detached house with his wife Marjorie from their marriage until he was aged 84.

Mason died at Highgrove Nursing Home, Stanley Road, Barnsley one day after his 91st birthday, on 19 April 2015. He had suffered from cerebrovascular disease. He was survived by his wife and his two daughters.

<doc id="856149" wikidata="Q1193870" url="?curid=856149" title="Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome">
<text>Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is altered organ function in an acutely ill patient requiring immediate medical intervention.

There are different stages of organ dysfunction for certain different organs, both in acute and in chronic onset, whether or not there are one or more organs affected. Each stage of dysfunction (whether it be the heart, lung, liver, or kidney) has defined parameters, in terms of laboratory values based on blood and other tests, as to what it is (each of these organs&#x27; levels of failure is divided into stage I, II, III, IV, and V). The word &quot;failure&quot; is commonly used to refer to the later stages, especially IV and V, when artificial support usually becomes necessary to sustain life; the damage may or may not be fully or partially reversible.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome can trigger a variety of symptoms throughout the body. Because MODS can impact any organ system, the specific symptoms experienced will depend on which organs are affected. Initially, these signs may be mild as the underlying illness progresses towards MODS. However, as the condition worsens, the symptoms can become more severe.

These symptoms include low urine output, nausea, vomiting, and loss of appetite. Some patients experience mental symptoms like confusion and may feel fatigued. Symptoms like fever, chills, irregular heartbeat, and quick/shallow breathing are also common. Multiple cases of MODS also suffer chest and abdominal pain, and patients may even lose consciousness.

== Cause ==
The condition results from infection, injury (accident, surgery), hypoperfusion and hypermetabolism. The primary cause triggers an uncontrolled inflammatory response.

Sepsis is the most common cause of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and may result in septic shock. In the absence of infection, a sepsis-like disorder is termed systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Both SIRS and sepsis could ultimately progress to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. In one-third of the patients, however, no primary focus can be found. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome is well established as the final stage of a continuum: SIRS + infection → sepsis → severe sepsis → Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

Currently, investigators are looking into genetic targets for possible gene therapy to prevent the progression to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. Some authors have conjectured that the inactivation of the transcription factors NF-κB and AP-1 would be appropriate targets in preventing sepsis and SIRS. These two genes are pro-inflammatory. They are essential components of a normal healthy immune response, however, so there is risk of increasing vulnerability to infection, which can also cause clinical deterioration.

== Pathophysiology ==
A definite explanation has not been found. Local and systemic responses are initiated by tissue damage. Respiratory failure is common in the first 72 hours. Subsequently, one might see liver failure (5–7 days), gastrointestinal bleeding (10–15 days) and kidney failure (11–17 days).

=== Gut hypothesis ===
The most popular hypothesis by Deitch to explain MODS in critically ill patients is the gut hypothesis. Due to splanchnic hypoperfusion and the subsequent mucosal ischaemia there are structural changes and alterations in cellular function. This results in increased gut permeability, changed immune function of the gut and increased translocation of bacteria. Liver dysfunction leads to toxins escaping into the systemic circulation and activating an immune response. This results in tissue injury and organ dysfunction.

=== Endotoxin macrophage hypothesis ===
Gram-negative infections in MODS patients are relatively common, hence endotoxins have been advanced as principal mediator in this disorder. It is thought that following the initial event cytokines are produced and released. The pro-inflammatory mediators are: tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1, interleukin-6, thromboxane A2, prostacyclin, platelet activating factor, and nitric oxide.

=== Tissue hypoxia-microvascular hypothesis ===
As a result of macro- and microvascular changes insufficient supply of oxygen occurs. Hypoxemia causes cell death and organ dysfunction.

=== Mitochondrial DNA hypothesis ===
According to findings of Professor Zsolt Balogh and his team at the University of Newcastle (Australia), mitochondrial DNA is the leading cause of severe inflammation due to a massive amount of mitochondrial DNA that leaks into the bloodstream due to cell death of patients who survived major trauma.

Mitochondrial DNA resembles bacterial DNA. If bacteria triggers leukocytes, mitochondrial DNA may do the same. When confronted with bacteria, white blood cells, or neutrophil granulocytes, behave like predatory spiders. They spit out a web, or net, to trap the invaders, then hit them with a deadly oxidative blast, forming neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs).

This results in catastrophic immune response leading to multiple organ dysfunction syndrome.

=== Integrated hypothesis ===
Since in most cases no primary cause is found, the condition could be part of a compromised homeostasis involving the previous mechanisms.

== Diagnosis ==
The European Society of Intensive Care organized a consensus meeting in 1994 to create the &quot;Sepsis-Related Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA)&quot; score to describe and quantitate the degree of organ dysfunction in six organ systems. Using similar physiologic variables the Multiple Organ Dysfunction Score was developed.

Four clinical phases have been suggested:
* Stage 1: the patient has increased volume requirements and mild respiratory alkalosis, which is accompanied by oliguria, hyperglycemia and increased insulin requirements.
* Stage 2: the patient is tachypneic, hypocapnic and hypoxemic; develops moderate liver dysfunction and possible hematologic abnormalities.
* Stage 3: the patient develops shock with azotemia and acid–base disturbances; has significant coagulation abnormalities.
* Stage 4: the patient is vasopressor dependent and oliguric or anuric; subsequently develops ischemic colitis and lactic acidosis.

== Management ==
At present, there is no drug or device that can reverse organ failure that has been judged by the health care team to be medically and/or surgically irreversible (organ function can recover, at least to a degree, in patients whose organs are very dysfunctional, where the patient has not died; and some organs, like the liver or the skin, can regenerate better than others),- with the possible exception of single or multiple organ transplants or the use of artificial organs or organ parts, in certain candidates in specific situations. Therapy, therefore, is usually mostly limited to supportive care, i.e. safeguarding hemodynamics, and respiration. Maintaining adequate tissue oxygenation is a principal target. Starting enteral nutrition within 36 hours of admission to an intensive care unit has reduced infectious complications.

== Prognosis ==
Mortality, though it has lessened to a limited degree, at least in developed countries with timely access to initial and tertiary care, varies where the chance of survival is diminished as the number of organs involved increases. Mortality in MODS from septic shock (which itself has a high mortality of 25–50%), and from multiple traumas, especially if not rapidly treated, appear to be especially severe. If more than one organ system is affected, the mortality rate is still higher, and this is especially the case when five or more systems or organs are affected. Old age is a risk factor in and of itself, and immunocompromised patients, such as with cancer or AIDS or a transplant, are at risk. Prognosis must take into account any co-morbidities the patient may have, their past and current health status, any genetic or environmental vulnerabilities they have, the nature and type of the illness or injury (as an example, data from COVID-19 is still being analyzed, whereas other cases from long-existing illnesses are much better understood), and any resistance to drugs used to treat microbial infections or any hospital-acquired co-infection. Earlier and aggressive treatment, the use of experimental treatments, or at least modern tools such as ventilators, ECMO, dialysis, bypass, and transplantation, especially at a trauma center, may improve outcomes in certain cases, but this depends in part on speedy and affordable access to high-quality care, which many areas lack. Measurements of lactate, cytokines, albumin and other proteins, urea, blood oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, insulin, and blood sugar, adequate hydration, constant monitoring of vital signs, good communication within and between facilities and staff, and adequate staffing, training, and charting are important in MODS, as in any serious illness.

In patients with sepsis, septic shock, or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome that is due to major trauma, the rs1800625 polymorphism is a functional single nucleotide polymorphism, a part of the receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) transmembrane receptor gene (of the immunoglobulin superfamily) and confers host susceptibility to sepsis and MODS in these patients.

== History ==
For many years, some patients were loosely classified as having &quot;sepsis&quot; or the &quot;sepsis syndrome&quot;. In more recent years, these concepts have been refined – so that there are specific definitions of sepsis – and two new concepts have been developed: the SIRS and MODS.

Although Irwin and Rippe cautioned in 2005 that the use of &quot;multiple organ failure&quot; or &quot;multisystem organ failure&quot; should be avoided, both Harrison&#x27;s (2015) and Cecil&#x27;s (2012) medical textbooks still use the terms &quot;multi-organ failure&quot; and &quot;multiple organ failure&quot; in several chapters and do not use &quot;multiple organ dysfunction syndrome&quot; at all.

<text>The Road Traffic Safety Law of the People&#x27;s Republic of China () is a law which was passed by the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on October 28, 2003, promulgated by Decree No. 8 of the President of the PRC Hu Jintao, and took effect on May 1, 2004, on all parts of mainland China (but not in Hong Kong and Macau which have their own judicial systems.) It is the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s first-ever law on road traffic safety, and was intended to address an alarmingly high traffic fatality rate, which is four or five times greater than other nations.

==Background==
The new law has a number of focus points:

* Under the new law, when accidents occur between pedestrians or non-motorised vehicles and motor vehicles, except for the case where the pedestrian or the non-motorised vehicle deliberately causes the incident, the motorist must always bear responsibility. Responsibility for the motorist is reduced if the pedestrian or non-motorised side violated traffic laws.
* The new law enforces a vehicle insurance system. Insurance on motor vehicles is now compulsory instead of voluntary.
* It abolished a previous regulation which banned holders of driver&#x27;s licences of the PRC driving rights on expressways until one year after they had held the licence.
* Expressway speed limits were increased from 110 km/h to 120 km/h.
* Even harsher penalties were put in place for drunk driving and driving by people who did not hold a valid driver&#x27;s licence, or drove a vehicle without licence plates.
* Cases where drivers were speeding 50% in excess of the applicable speed limit will result in the revocation of the driver&#x27;s licence.
* The penalty for hit-and-run accidents is permanent revocation of one&#x27;s driver&#x27;s licence.
* The pre-existing point system for penalties was integrated into the new law.
* Penalties are now higher, from the former RMB 200 up to RMB 2000. Also, provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions can only enact specific penalties within the given range. Previously, the nationwide maximum penalty was RMB 200, but areas like Beijing and Kunming had enacted laws mandating penalties in the thousands of RMB.

Beijing&#x27;s own &quot;implementation procedures&quot; of the new traffic law was passed on October 22, 2004, after being the target of heavy controversy over the responsibilities of vehicle drivers and pedestrians, and a regulation limiting the lanes that can be used by novice drivers. These take effect on January 1, 2005.

According to Xinhua News Agency, &quot;police officers are also reluctant to pull over drivers of military vehicles even if the drivers are breaking the law&quot;. According to the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, Chinese army and police seized thousands of fake military license plates and IDs.

<doc id="856170" wikidata="Q1801903" url="?curid=856170" title="On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection">
<text>&quot;On the Tendency of Species to form Varieties; and on the Perpetuation of Varieties and Species by Natural Means of Selection&quot; is the title of a journal article, comprising and resulting from the joint presentation of two scientific papers to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858: &quot;On The Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type&quot; by Alfred Russel Wallace and an &quot;Extract from an unpublished Work on Species&quot; from Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Essay&quot; of 1844. The article also includes an &quot;Abstract of a Letter&quot; from Darwin to Asa Gray, and an introductory letter by Joseph Dalton Hooker and Charles Lyell. The article was the first announcement of the Darwin–Wallace theory of evolution by natural selection; and appeared in print on 20 August 1858. The presentation of the papers spurred Darwin to write a condensed &quot;abstract&quot; of his &quot;big book&quot;, &quot;Natural Selection&quot;. This was published in November 1859 as &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;.

== Events leading up to the publication ==
On the voyage of the &quot;Beagle&quot; the young Charles Darwin took a break between graduating and starting his career as a clergyman to study the natural history of South America, an interest he had developed at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Cambridge. Influenced by Charles Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;, he became an able geologist as well as collecting plant and animal specimens, and fossils of gigantic extinct mammals. By the return journey, he was connecting patterns of geographical and historical distribution, and starting to doubt the stability of Species. In September 1838 he conceived his theory of natural selection as the cause of evolution, then as well as developing his career as a geologist and writer worked privately on finding evidence and answering possible objections. He wrote out his ideas in an 1842 &quot;pencil sketch&quot;, then in an essay written in 1844. He discussed transmutation with his friend Joseph Dalton Hooker, who read the essay in 1847. After turning his attention to biology and completing eight years of work on barnacles, Darwin intensified work on his theory of species in 1854.

Alfred Russel Wallace, a naturalist working in Borneo, had a paper on the &quot;introduction&quot; of species published in &quot;Annals and Magazine of Natural History&quot;. This made guarded comments about evolution, and in the spring of 1856 it was noticed by Lyell who drew it to the attention of Darwin who was then working out a strategy for presenting his theory. Darwin apparently mistook Wallace&#x27;s meaning, writing &quot;nothing very new ... Uses my simile of tree, [but] it seems all creation with him&quot;. However, he spelt out the details of Natural Selection to Lyell, who found the idea hard to accept but urged Darwin to publish to establish priority. On 14 May 1856 Darwin began what became his draft for a book titled &quot;Natural Selection&quot;.

Wallace collected specimens and corresponded with Darwin from Borneo. In December 1857, he wrote to ask if Darwin&#x27;s book would delve into human origins, to which Darwin responded that &quot;I think I shall avoid the whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices, though I fully admit that it is the highest &amp; most interesting problem for the naturalist&quot;. He encouraged Wallace&#x27;s theorising, saying &quot;without speculation there is no good &amp; original observation&quot;, adding that &quot;I go much further than you&quot;.

Wallace wrote his paper &quot;On The Tendency of Varieties to Depart Indefinitely from the Original Type&quot; at Ternate in February 1858 and sent it to Darwin with a request to send it on to Lyell. Darwin received it on 18 June 1858, and wrote to Lyell that &quot;your words have come true with a vengeance... forestalled&quot; and &quot;If Wallace had my MS. sketch written out in 1842, he could not have made a better short abstract!&quot; While Wallace had not asked for publication, Darwin would, &quot;of course, at once write and offer to send [it] to any journal&quot; that Wallace chose. He sadly added that &quot;all my originality, whatever it may amount to, will be smashed&quot;. Lyell&#x27;s immediate response urged Darwin to publish his own ideas, and in his reply of 25 June Darwin agreed that he could point to his own &quot;Essay&quot; of 1844 which Hooker had read in 1847, and a letter to Asa Gray of 1857 showing that he was still developing the ideas, &quot;so that I could most truly say and prove that I take nothing from Wallace. I should be extremely glad now to publish a sketch of my general views in about a dozen pages or so. But I cannot persuade myself that I can do so honourably... I would far rather burn my whole book than that he or any man should think that I had behaved in a paltry spirit&quot;, also requesting that Hooker be invited to give a second opinion. Darwin was overwrought by a deepening crisis of illness of his baby son Charles Waring Darwin, who died of scarlet fever on 28 June. On the morning of the 29th he acknowledged Hooker&#x27;s letters, writing &quot;I cannot think now&quot;, then that night he read the letters, and though &quot;quite prostrated&quot;, got his servant to take to Hooker Wallace&#x27;s essay, the letter to Asa Gray and the &quot;Essay&quot; of 1844, leaving matters in the hands of Lyell and Hooker.

Lyell and Hooker had decided on a joint publication at the Linnean Society of London of Wallace&#x27;s paper together with an extract from Darwin&#x27;s essay and his letter to Asa Gray. The last meeting of the society before the summer recess had been postponed following the death of former president the botanist Robert Brown on 10 June 1858, and was to be held on 1 July.
On the afternoon of 30 June Mrs. Hooker copied out extracts from the handwritten documents they had just received from Darwin, then that evening Lyell and Hooker handed them in to the secretary with a covering letter.

== The reading ==
The papers were read to the Linnean Society of London on 1 July 1858, by the Secretary John Joseph Bennett. Neither author was present. Darwin was attending the funeral of his son, and Wallace was still in Borneo. The meeting was chaired by the president of the society, Thomas Bell, who had written up the description of Darwin&#x27;s reptile specimens from the &quot;Beagle&quot; expedition.

About thirty were present, including two unnamed guests from overseas, with many there to hear an obituary notice for the former president and botanist Robert Brown given by Lyell. Wallace&#x27;s natural history agent Samuel Stevens happened to be present, while Darwin&#x27;s friends there included William Benjamin Carpenter and the geologist William Henry Fitton. Amongst the others, Daniel Oliver and Arthur Henfry would later support evolution, while Cuthbert Collingwood became an opponent. George Bentham was persuaded by Hooker to step down so that the Darwin and Wallace papers were first on the agenda, followed by six other papers on botanical and zoological topics. Bell had introduced discussions at the end of meetings, but there was no discussion of natural selection, perhaps because of the amount of business that had been dealt with, or possibly due to polite reluctance to speak out against a theory which the eminent Lyell and Hooker were supporting. Bentham noted that the audience appeared fatigued. Hooker later said there was &quot;no semblance of a discussion&quot;, though &quot;it was talked over with bated breath&quot; at tea afterwards, and in his reminiscences many years later thought &quot;the subject [was] too ominous for the old school to enter the lists before armouring.&quot; Although Bell apparently disapproved, the vice-president promptly removed all references to immutability from his own paper which was awaiting publication.

Darwin wrote to Wallace to explain what had occurred, enclosing a letter which Hooker wrote at Darwin&#x27;s request. His next action was to get his family away from the danger of infection, both himself and Emma exhausted by sickening fear about the safety of their children. The day after the funeral they moved to his sister-in-law&#x27;s in Sussex, then on to Portsmouth and the Isle of Wight. At first they stayed in the King&#x27;s Hotel, Shanklin, and on 30 July Darwin began writing an &quot;abstract&quot; of his book on &quot;Natural Selection&quot;, planning a short paper in response to Hooker&#x27;s urging to publish a scientific paper in the &quot;Linnean&quot; journal. They next rented a villa in Sandown and Darwin pressed on, with the facts he felt necessary to support his &quot;abstract&quot; expanding far beyond the thirty pages Hooker had originally suggested.

== The paper ==
The paper, consisting of the letter and papers, was published in the &quot;Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society 3&quot; (20 August): 46–50.

The paper consisted of a communication letter by Joseph Dalton Hooker and Charles Lyell dated 30 June 1858, giving information on the three sections of the papers. The introduction is shown below, along with the section headings:

MY DEAR SIR,—The accompanying papers, which we have the honour of communicating to the Linnean Society, and which all related to the same subject, viz. the Laws which affect the Production of Varieties, Races, and Species, contain the results of the investigations of two indefatigable naturalists, Mr. Charles Darwin and Mr. Alfred Wallace.

The gentlemen having, independently and unknown to one another, conceived the same very ingenious theory to account for the appearance and perpetuation of varieties and of specific forms on our planet, and both fairly claim the merit of being original thinkers in this important line of inquiry; but neither of them having published his views, though Mr. Darwin has for many years past been repeatedly urged by us to do so, and both authors having now unreservedly placed their papers in our hands, we think it would best promote the interests of science that a selection from them should be laid before the Linnean Society. Taken in the order of their dates, they consist of:—
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
I. &quot;Extract from an unpublished Work on Species, by &quot;C. DARWIN, Esq.,&quot; consisting of a portion of a Chapter entitled, &quot;On the Variation of Organic Beings in a state of Nature; on the Natural Means of Selection; on the Comparison of Domestic Races and true Species.&quot;&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
II. &quot;Abstract of a Letter from&quot; C. DARWIN, Esq., &quot;to &quot;Prof. ASA GRAY,&quot; Boston, US, dated Down, September 5th, 1857.&quot;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
III. &quot;On the Tendency of Varieties to depart indefinitely from the Original Type.&quot; By ALFRED RUSSEL WALLACE.
The communication letter briefly describes the first two, and regarding Wallace&#x27;s paper states that he sent to Darwin &quot;with the expressed wish that it should be forwarded to Sir Charles Lyell, if Mr. Darwin thought it sufficiently novel and interesting. So highly did Mr. Darwin appreciate the value of the views therein set forth, that he proposed, in a letter to Sir Charles Lyell, to obtain Mr. Wallace&#x27;s consent to allow the Essay to be published as soon as possible. Of this step we highly approved, provided Mr. Darwin did not withhold from the public, as he was strongly inclined to do (in favour of Mr. Wallace), the memoir which he had himself written on the same subject, and which, as before stated, one of us had perused in 1844, and the contents of which we had both of us been privy to for many years. On representing this to Mr. Darwin, he gave us permission to make what use we thought proper of his memoir, &amp;c.; and in adopting our present course, of presenting it to the Linnean Society, we have explained to him that we are not solely considering the relative claims to priority of himself and his friend, but the interests of science generally&quot;.

==Impact of the publication==
The paper was reprinted and reviewed in several magazines including &quot;The Zoologist&quot;, whose judgement was &quot;on asking myself, &#x27;What does all this prove?&#x27; the only answer I could make was, &#x27;A possibility&#x27;.&quot; It was commented on in some reviews and letters. The Linnean Society President Thomas Bell in his presidential report of May 1859 wrote that &quot;The year which has passed has not, indeed, been marked by any of those striking discoveries which at once revolutionize, so to speak, the department of science on which they bear&quot;. Years later, Darwin could only recall one review; Professor Haughton of Dublin claimed that &quot;all that was new in them was false, and what was true was old.&quot;

Despite illness, Darwin pressed on with writing the &quot;abstract&quot; of his &quot;big book&quot; on &quot;Natural Selection&quot;; this condensed version was published in November 1859 as &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;.

== As an influence on cybernetics ==
In a largely overlooked passage from Wallace&#x27;s essay (p. 62), he says of the evolutionary principle:

The action of this principle is exactly like that of the centrifugal governor of the steam engine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they become evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the animal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it would make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence difficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow.

The cybernetician and anthropologist Gregory Bateson would observe in the 1970s that, although seeing it only as an illustration, Wallace had &quot;probably said the most powerful thing that’d been said in the 19th century&quot;.
Bateson revisited the topic in his 1979 book &quot;Mind and Nature: A Necessary Unity&quot;, and other scholars have continued to explore the connection between natural selection and systems theory.

<doc id="856173" wikidata="Q1496514" url="?curid=856173" title="Gavril Sarychev">
<text>Gavril (also Gavriil) Andreyevich Sarychev () (1763 — 11 August (O.S. 30 July) 1831), spelt &quot;Sarichef&quot; in the United States, was a Russian navigator, hydrographer, admiral (1829) and Honorable Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1809) in Saint Petersburg.

==Biography==
Sarychev started his career at the age of eight as a naval cadet and joined the Imperial Russian Navy in 1781. From 1785 to 1794, he took part in the expedition sponsored by Empress Catherine II and led by Royal Navy officer Joseph Billings. Sarychev, on ship &quot;Slava Rossii&quot; (Glory of Russia), described and mapped the coastline of the Sea of Okhotsk from Okhotsk to Aldoma, many of the Aleutian Islands (especially Unalaska). He also described the islands of Pribylov, St. Matthew Island, St. Lawrence Island, Gvozdev, and King Island.

In 1802–1806, Sarychev led the Baltic hydrographic expedition. He was also in charge of hydrographic research in Russia since 1808 and led the compilation of the Atlas of the Northern Part of the Pacific Ocean in 1826. It includes engraving based on the sketches of the artist Luka Voronin. He became a Vice Admiral in 1808 and a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences the next year. He became an Admiral in 1830 and served briefly as a minister of the navy. He died from cholera during a major outbreak in 1831.

==Legacy==
Cape Sarichef, Sarychev Peak, Sarychev Range, Sarichef Strait and Sarichef Island in Alaska were named by explorer Lt. Otto von Kotzebue after Gavril Sarychev, who was the Hydrographer General of the Russian Imperial Hydrographic Service between 1827 and 1831.

The Soviet ship &quot;Gavril Sarychev&quot; was named after the explorer. The &quot;Gavril Sarychev&quot; took part in the search for Korean Air Lines Flight 007 which was downed by a Soviet Su-15 interceptor just west of Sakhalin Island on 1 September 1983.

<text>North Hills, known previously as Sepulveda, is a neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, California.

North Hills was originally part of an agricultural community known as Mission Acres. After WWII, the newly developed suburban community was renamed Sepulveda, after the prominent Sepúlveda family of California. In 1991, it was renamed North Hills.

==Geography==

=== Location ===
The neighborhood of North Hills is located in the central San Fernando Valley, a region of the city of Los Angeles. It is intersected by the 405 Freeway and lies between Bull Creek and the Pacoima Wash. By road, it is 21 miles northwest of downtown; In relation to the cities surrounding Los Angeles, the neighborhood is about 17 miles north of Santa Monica, 16 miles east of Simi Valley, 14 miles northeast of Calabasas, 13 miles northwest of Burbank, 12 miles south of Santa Clarita, and 4 miles southwest of San Fernando. Surrounding neighborhoods are Northridge to the west, Panorama City to the east, Van Nuys to the south, and Granada Hills and Mission Hills to the north.

Overlapping Area codes 747 and 818 serve the area. The North Hills ZIP code is 91343.

==== Neighborhood boundaries and area ====
While neighborhood boundaries in the Los Angeles area are generally informal, the official boundaries used by the North Hills East and West neighborhood council districts would make the neighborhood a area between Bull Creek and the Pacoima Wash on the west and east respectively. The southern boundary is Roscoe Boulevard, starting on Bull Creek and ending at the Pacoima Wash; North Hills East includes a panhandle of land south of Roscoe Boulevard to the Coast Line railroad between the 405 Freeway and Sepulveda Boulevard. The northern boundary is Lassen Street, west from the Pacoima Wash to Woodley Avenue. Since 2012, North Hills is bounded by the community of Woodley Hill in Northridge which occupies a square area at the northwest area of the neighborhood bounded by Woodley Avenue in the west and Plummer Street in the south. The North Hills East and West neighborhood councils are separated by the 405 Freeway; the West district has an area of and the East has an area of .

Other sources, notably the Los Angeles Times&#x27; Mapping L.A. project, extend the neighborhood&#x27;s boundaries to Balboa Boulevard and Bull Creek (&quot;the wash&quot;) on the west, and Lassen and Devonshire Street on the north, mostly to include the North Hills Shopping Center which is also claimed by Granada Hills.

==History==

The San Fernando Valley had been inhabited by Tongva people, as well as Tataviam and Chumash people. Their settlements, later called &quot;rancherías&quot; by the Spanish, were mostly located in the southern valley which was better irrigated in the dry season and provided shelter from winter floods; in the north valley were the villages of Paséknga, in modern-day San Fernando, and Pakoinga, of Tataviam etymology and located in modern Pacoima. The area of North Hills is between the northern and southern settlements in a relatively flat area of the valley which was subject to winter floods from the Pacoima Wash.

=== Colonization and mission era ===

Europeans first arrived at the valley during the Spanish Portolá expedition in August 5, 1769, and named it &quot;Valle de Santa Catalina de Bononia de los Encinos&quot;. After having friendly encounters with the native people and camping in the southern valley, they crossed through the central valley, where North Hills is located, on the 7th and set up camp at the northern foothills before proceeding on their expedition. The colonization of the upper Californias began with the Portolá expedition and advanced in the following years. The San Gabriel Mission was founded in 1771, and the Pueblo de Los Ángeles was settled in 1781.

With the pueblo&#x27;s founding and by royal edict, all the waters of the Porciúncula River were reserved for use by the new pueblo, including valley lands, and royal concessions for grazing land were issued. Francisco Reyes, alcalde of Los Ángeles from 1793 to 1795, established a grazing operation of Rancho Los Encinos near Paséknga which included the agricultural settlement of Achooykomenga, worked by Chumash, Tongva, and Tataviam laborers. The rancho was acquired by Franciscan missionaries after being identified as a suitable site for a mission, and on September 8, 1797 the San Fernando Rey de España Mission was founded, placing most of the valley&#x27;s land, including the area of North Hills, and its indigenous inhabitants under the mission&#x27;s jurisdiction.

After the independence of Mexico from Spain, an 1833 government decree led to the secularization of the missions in Alta and Baja California and the San Fernando Mission was officially secularized in 1834. The mission became the head of a parish and the government commissioned a &quot;mayordomo&quot; to oversee the process of secularization and to administer the former mission land.

=== Rancho land ===

In 1845, governor Pío Pico signed a 9-year land lease, at $1,120 per year, to his brother Andrés Pico and his business partner Juan Manso who used it for cattle ranching. In the wake of the American intervention in Mexico, the governor put the land up for sale as the Rancho Ex-Misión de San Fernando to raise funds. The ranch lands were sold to Spanish merchant Eulogio de Celis for $14,000 in June 17, 1846. A portion of land lying just north of modern North Hills surrounding the mission complex was reserved for Andrés Pico and became known as the Pico Reserve.

The Mexican armed resistance to the American intervention ceased in the beginning of 1848 and the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ceded the California Territory to the United States. The Treaty provided that the Mexican land grants would be honored and American officials acquired Spanish and Mexican records to confirm titles.

Eulogio de Celis filed his claim to the rancho lands in October 1852, but the land grant was not formally upheld by the U.S. District Court until January 1873, after he had returned to Spain and four years after his death. In the mean time, Andrés Pico paid de Celis&#x27; lawyer, Edward Vischer, $15,000 for an undivided half-interest in the rancho in 1854, the same year Pico&#x27;s lease expired. The land was divided along a line which roughly follows Roscoe Boulevard, now considered North Hills&#x27; southern boundary, and the southern half was sold to Pico. Andrés eventually sold his half-interest in the rancho to his brother Pío in 1862, retaining the 2,000 acre Pico Reserve; in turn, Pío sold the interest to the San Fernando Farm Homestead Association for $115,000 in 1869; this association went through several name changes, eventually becoming the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Company.

In a 1871 plat of the rancho, the North Hills area is shown to be an undeveloped land crossed by a road which led to the Pico Reserve and the mission in the north from the Rancho Los Encinos in the south. A sheep camp is shown to have been located just north of the ranch partition line on the west bank of the Pacoima Wash, which corresponds to the southeast end of modern North Hills. De Celis died in Spain in 1869 and his son Eulogio F. de Celis returned as the administrator of his father&#x27;s estate which was later finally patented to his father by the government on January 8, 1873. After negotiations between the heirs of de Celis and the San Fernando Farm Homestead Association, the valley was formally divided into north and south. The heirs then sold the remaining northern half of the rancho, which includes present-day North Hills, to Charles Maclay and George K. Porter in 1875 for $125,000. With this, the Rancho era essentially ended in the San Fernando Valley; land divisions continued, what remained of the original mission agriculture fell into disuse, and the remaining indigenous population nearly disappeared from the region.

=== Porter land ===
The former rancho land was placed under Porter&#x27;s name and he owned a three-fourths interest in the property, with Maclay owning the remaining quarter. Porter saw the valley as a site with potential for agricultural development, whereas Maclay was more focused on its colonization. In order to pay off the de Celis mortgage, they counted on the success of the town of San Fernando, which had then been newly platted along the Southern Pacific Railroad. A local bank failure and the departure of railroad workers led to a collapse in the real estate boom which made Maclay turn to renting land for sheep pasture and farming; then, a drought in 1876 and 1877 led to the failure of grain fields and the death of tens of thousands of sheep.

Maclay was unable to meet the mortgage and de Celis filed for foreclosure in July 1876; the Los Angeles district court found Maclay personally liable for the mortgage payment in June 1877 and ordered the sale of his quarter interest, and that if the sale was insufficient to meet the mortgage, then Porter&#x27;s interest would also be sold. While they managed to delay the foreclosure for two years, the interest accumulated. In July 1879, the Maclay portion was sold to Benjamin F. Porter and, because the sale amount was insufficient, George Porter&#x27;s remaining share was sold to Josefa A. de Celis. George managed to reobtain his interest in April 1880 thanks to his agent, Francis M. Wright, a valley farmer. In February 1881, Maclay and the Porters reached an agreement to partition the land. Maclay kept a third of the land lying north of the railroad and east of the Pacoima Wash called the Maclay Rancho, the Porters kept the remaining two-thirds to the west. In 1881, the Porter cousins split their holdings and George received the portion between the Pacoima Wash in the east and Aliso Canyon, about current-day Zelzah Avenue, in the west. George Porter&#x27;s land included all of current North Hills.

In 1887, George K. Porter subdivided the land and established the Porter Land and Water Company to take advantage of a land sales boom. Nearly 17,000 acres were subdivided into ten and forty acre lots with an irrigation system sufficient for 4,000 acres. John B. Baskin, a partner and sales agent of the company began an extensive marketing and promotional campaign for the land subdivision; a frequent motif of the marketing is the remains of the mission which was surrounded by the tract. Baskin also hired California State Engineer William Hammond Hall to develop an irrigation plan for water derived from the local springs and arroyos like the Pacoima Wash. The boom began to fade by the end of 1888 and went bust the next year with internal company problems and declining national and local economies which preceded the Panic of 1893; the decline would also be exacerbated by severe droughts in the 1890s. In October 1903, Porter sold his firm and transferred remaining lands to a syndicate led by Leslie C. Brand which was incorporated as the San Fernando Mission Land Company.

=== Community development ===

The 20th century began with important developments for the San Fernando Valley which led to its rapid settlement. In 1905, the City of Los Angeles announced its plans to bring water to the city from the Owens Valley and began construction on the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1908; the future arrival of water to the valley spurred development. The southern half of the former rancho lands were bought from the Los Angeles Farming and Milling Co. by a syndicate incorporated as the Los Angeles Suburban Homes Company, and the towns of Van Nuys, Marion, and Owensmouth were planned out along with a system of highways. The Pacific Electric Railway also began an expansion into the valley which reached the burgeoning community of Van Nuys in December 1911, and was completed with its arrival in the city of San Fernando in March 1913, allowing better connections to Los Angeles from the valley. The San Fernando Mission Land Co. began to market its then over 16,000 acres of land to the public in April 1912, advertising five, ten, and fifteen acre tracts adapted to citriculture and other agricultural uses.

In October 1912, The Angeles Mesa Land Company purchased Henry E. Huntington&#x27;s one-tenth share in the Mission Land property holdings. The companies began to invest in the extension of the railway to San Fernando and the construction of a 4-mile boulevard, named Brand Boulevard, to connect San Fernando to Van Nuys on Sherman Way, hoping to open it for use when the Los Angeles Aqueduct is inaugurated. Work on Brand Boulevard advanced and workers began to spread asphalt on the first mile by mid-1913; one side of the road was designed for exclusive use by automobiles, while the other was multi-use for trucks, heavy wagons, and horse-drawn vehicles. The aqueduct water reached the valley in November, 1913.

Mission Acres was an agricultural community made by early developers who created 1 acre plots for agricultural activities, with irrigation supplied by the Los Angeles Aqueduct in 1913. The community was a stop for the Pacific Electric railway streetcars that transported passengers from downtown Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley.

Residents of Mission Acres renamed the area Sepulveda in 1927. The Californio Sepulveda family, going back to the founding of the Pueblo of Los Angeles, is the source of various Los Angeles place-names, including the post-war community of Sepulveda. Sepulveda Boulevard is the primary north–south street through North Hills, crossing Sepulveda Pass to the south. The community saw significant growth between the 1930s and the 1950s.

In 1937, councilman Jim Wilson offered a resolution that instructed the city&#x27;s real estate agent to make the right of way cost appraisal for diverting flood waters from Wilson and East Canyons into Pacoima Wash to protect the community of Sepulveda from floods that occurred during heavy storms. This same year, the Our Lady of Peace Catholic Church was built and the parish was established years later in 1944.

=== Post World War II ===
The area remained mostly rural through the 1940s, urbanization initiated during the 1950s during which the entire San Fernando Valley was experiencing a transition from semi-rural and agricultural uses into suburban development patterns. Multi-family residential units began to be developed in the 1960s.

Before the construction of the 405, Sepulveda Boulevard was a major highway and the neighborhood became a stopping point for travelers to and from Los Angeles. Motels began to be established along Sepulveda. Among these motels is the Good Knight Inn, which began construction in 1945 and featured a façade designed to resemble a castle; by 2023, the motel has continued to run and has retained much of its original form.

The Our Lady of Peace Catholic school was being built by 1951 and began to hold classes that year, the school building was officially completed in 1954, followed by various additions. Later that year of 1954, the new Our Lady of Peace church designed by Armet and Davis was completed; the former church structure was repurposed by the parish as Schneider&#x27;s Hall. By 1956, the school was the largest elementary school in the Archdiocese of Los Angeles and remained so for two more years.

Plummer Elementary School, designed in the International style by E. R. C. Billerbeck for LAUSD, was completed in 1952.

The Sepulveda Veterans Administration Hospital was completed in a 160-acre property in 1955.

After four years of construction, Francisco Sepulveda Junior High School, designed by architect Arthur Froelich in the International style, was completed in 1960.

In 1991, residents of the western half of Sepulveda, west of the San Diego Freeway, voted to secede from the eastern section to form a new community named North Hills. The City of Los Angeles soon changed the name of remaining Sepulveda to North Hills also. The city then formed a new sub-neighborhood of &quot;North Hills West&quot; which begins west of the 405 freeway and goes to Bull Creek Wash/Balboa Blvd. and from Roscoe Blvd. to Devonshire St. The eastern section became the sub-neighborhood of North Hills East.

North Hills East boundaries are east of the 405-San Diego Freeway, along the Pacoima Wash, South of Lassen, and North of Roscoe.

In June 1999, a damaged airplane landed safely on Hayvenhurst Avenue on its way to Van Nuys Airport.

By the year 2000, the neighborhood had a population of 52,333; Compared to 1990, North Hills had a population increase of 22% by the year 2000, among the highest total increase in the Valley, with a significant increase in Latino American (73.7%) and Asian/Pacific Islander (52.6%) residents.

Between January 2010 and January 2011, 300 residents of the community of Woodley Hill signed a petition, initiated by resident Estelle R. Goldman, to separate from North Hills, citing that their issues and property values relate more to Northridge. Woodley Hills is bounded by Lassen and Plummer on the north and south, and by Bull Creek and Woodley on the west and east. The petition was received and filed by the city in April, 2011. The Northridge East Neighborhood Council supported the petition; meanwhile, North Hills West opposed the renaming, stating that property values effects would be minimal and insignificant, that Woodley Hill is a desirable area along with western North Hills and that it would turn Woodley Hill into a less desirable part of Northridge, that stakeholders would potentially want to extend Northridge to the 405 Freeway, that their issues are substantially similar to those of North Hills, and that the change would cause confusion. In early 2012, Goldman stated that she then felt that her statement concerning property values and issues was naïve and she wished to correct it. She amended the reasoning, stating that residents&#x27; concerns were that they did not send their children to North Hills Schools, they did not shop in North Hills, and that the nature of the community is purely residential with no businesses or apartments compared to North Hills; she further stated that residents identify more with Northridge because of community interests and socio-economic background. The application eventually gained approval and was adopted on August 3, 2012. While it was initially claimed that neighborhood council boundaries would not be changed, the North Hills West Neighborhood Council approved the transfer of Woodley Hills to Northridge East on March 22, 2013, followed by approval by Northridge East on April 17, and the Board of Neighborhood Commissioners in July.

On December 6, 2014, a celebration was held for the opening of the over 13,000 square foot Nanak Sadan Sikh Temple and Community Center at Nordhoff Street, followed by the celebration of a regular evening &quot;diwan&quot;.

In late March 2016, a local man, Shehada Issa, murdered his wife, Rabihah, and later his son, Amir &quot;Rocky&quot; Issa, at their home on the 1500 block of Rayen Street in North Hills East. Prosecutors found that Amir&#x27;s sexual orientation was a motivating factor for his murder, later also classified as a hate crime. It was the second killing of an LGBTQ person in the San Fernando Valley in two years, occurring a year after the murder of a trans woman in neighboring Van Nuys. The murder quickly drew attention from the gay community, and local community group Somos Familia Valle organized a rally on April 4 at Sepulveda Boulevard and Nordhoff Street calling for family acceptance towards LGBTQ children and an end to discrimination and violence in the valley&#x27;s neighborhoods. In September 2017, Shehada Issa was convicted of two counts of first degree murder with Amir&#x27;s murder being enhanced as a hate crime, and was sentenced to life in prison; there was an attempt to appeal the conviction, but the state appellate court ruled that there was overwhelming evidence of Issa&#x27;s guilt and in May 2020 the state&#x27;s Supreme Court refused to review the case.

As of 2020, about 242 (1.3%) of the approximately 17,977 occupied structures in North Hills were built in 1939 or earlier, 34.9% were built from 1940 to 1959, 34% from 1960 to 1979, 5.2% from 2000 to 2009, 0.9% from 2010 to 2013, and 1% from 2014 or later.

There are magnet programs in some schools, such as the Sepulveda Middle School which has a Gifted / High Ability Magnet, and Kennedy High School which has an Architecture/Digital Arts Magnet. A school bus is provided if pupils are more than 5 miles away from the school. North Hills West is also served by charter schools of all grades.

==== Local school district administration ====
North Hills schools are locally administered by the Regional Superintendent for LAUSD Region North. The neighborhood schools are represented in the LAUSD Board of Education by the members for district 3, which covers most of North Hills West, and district 6, which covers North Hills East and a portion of West including Gledhill Street Elementary and Monroe High.


===Private schools===

Several North Hills residents serve as host families to international students studying in the US. As of early 2014, about 50 foreign exchange students are attending school in the North Hills area. Host families get to share their way of life and culture with the students, and at the same time learn more about the students and their home countries.

=== Public library ===
The Los Angeles Public Library Mid-Valley Regional Branch, one of the biggest in the San Fernando Valley, is located on Nordhoff Street at Woodley Avenue in North Hills.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Transport ===

California Interstate 405 has direct access to the neighborhood on two points: exit 68 on Roscoe Boulevard and exit 69 on Nordhoff Street. Main thoroughfares include Sepulveda and Roscoe boulevards; Hayvenhurst, Woodley, and Haskell avenues; Lassen, Plummer, and Nordhoff streets. These thoroughfares, as is the case in most of the San Fernando Valley, are arranged in a grid pattern with north–south ways labeled as avenues and east–west ways labeled as streets.

Bicycle infrastructure in the neighborhood includes marked street-side bike lanes on Devonshire Street, on Nordhoff Street starting eastward from Orion Avenue, Parthenia Street eastward from Burnet Avenue, and south–north lanes on Woodley Avenue. Plummer Street is designated as a bike route, allowing cyclists to share space with other vehicular traffic.

The Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority operates Metro Bus local lines 152, 166, 167, 234, and 237 through the neighborhood and the Los Angeles Department of Transportation&#x27;s Panorama City/Van Nuys DASH route also runs through part of the neighborhood.

=== Parks and recreation ===
There are few public parks and recreational facilities within the neighborhood. North Hills Community Park is a recreational space in the more densely populated area of North Hills East, with a children&#x27;s play areas and sports facilities which host several youth sports programs. The park was established in 2001 as Sepulveda Park West, and it continues to be the only proper recreational park within the neighborhood as of 2024. The Mid-Valley Library in North Hills West is in a site which had been previously dedicated as the Nordhoff Recreation Center in 1978 before funds were available to build the library. The library building and parking spaces covered more than half of the original site when the park became the library campus in 1996, but an open grassy area with paved footpaths and benches remains.

More parkland and recreational facilities are located outside the neighborhood. The large, , Sepulveda Recreation Center provides access to parkland and recreational facilities to residents, especially those in North Hills East. Despite sharing North Hills&#x27; former name, it is actually located in Panorama City, just outside the neighborhood&#x27;s east boundary on the Pacoima Wash. Other parks near North Hills East include the Albert Piantanida Intergenerational Center, and Marson Street Pocket Park, both in Panorama City, as well as Devonwood Park in Mission Hills. To the west, Dearborn Park in Northridge also provides recreation and parkland to residents.

In 2022, there was an unsuccessful movement by community members and residents to prevent the construction of a new charter school on Plummer Street in North Hills East and promoting the creation of a park. They cited a desire to preserve and create a public use for a historic house on the site which dates to the settlement of Mission Acres and was designated as a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument, and the lack of green space in the neighborhood. While the house is to be preserved, plans went forward for the construction of the Valor Academy Elementary School.

=== Healthcare ===
North Hills is home to the large Veterans Administration Sepulveda Ambulatory Care Center campus, which serves veterans in the San Fernando Valley, with residential and outpatient care.

== Landmarks ==
A ivy poodle living sculpture is located on a utility pole at Plummer Street and Hayvenhurst Avenue, next to Bull Creek. The poodle was originally sculpted by North Hills resident Brian Welch in the 1980s and it quickly became a local celebrity. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power ordered the sculpture removed in 1987, but Welch ignored the order. In the 2010s, the Welches began a tradition of turning the poodle to a reindeer each December.

=== Filming locations ===
Many locations in North Hills have been used for various films, including &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, &quot;Halloween&quot;, &quot;Halloween II&quot;, &quot;American Beauty&quot;, and &quot;Step Brothers&quot;. Several of these films shot in the Sepulveda VA Clinic, such as &quot;Step Brothers&quot;, where the area was used to film a fight between two men and a group of kids. Additionally, one of the most famous moments in &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, in which the T-1000 drives a semi-truck through an overpass wall and into a channelized river, was filmed at Bull Creek&#x27;s Plummer Street/Hayvenhurst Avenue overpass.

<text>The Battle of Laswari took place on 1 November 1803 near Laswari village, Alwar. It was part of the Second Anglo-Maratha War.
The British under Gerard Lake were anxious to finish the war by neutralizing the last substantial force that the Maratha confederacy possessed, consisting of twelve battalions of regular infantry trained by the adventurer Chevalier Dudrenec. Dudrenec deserted the Marathas and command fell onto Ambaji Ingle, a veteran Maratha officer.

Lake decided to dispense first with his artillery and later with his infantry in a series of forced marches to catch up with the Maratha force. Lake initially encountered the enemy force with just three brigades of cavalry, but the British troopers by repeated charges were able to contain the Maratha Army until the British infantry arrived.

The British units, commanded by Lake, were about 10,000 men strong, opposing Sindhia&#x27;s force of 9,000 veteran infantry and 5,000 cavalry under the command of Ambaji Ingle. The British units were also supported by additional allied troops from Alwar.

The Maratha infantry made a most gallant defence, standing their ground until the survivors laid down their arms. The cavalry also suffered heavily. The British captured 72 guns and a large quantity of ammunition and stores. Lake later wrote, &quot;I never was in so severe a business in my life or anything like it… these fellows fought like devils, or rather like heroes&quot;.

&quot;The casualties on both sides were very heavy. The Company lost many officers, including Maj. Gen. Weir, Col. Vandeleur and Maj. Griffith. Lake&#x27;s son was also killed.&quot;

On 17 December 1803, Raghuji Bhonsale (II) of Nagpur signed the Treaty of Deogaon with the British after the Battle of Laswari and gave up the province of Cuttack including Balasore.

In this battle, the people of the Meena tribe of Shahjahanpur village of Alwar district fought a lot and drove the British away.

<text>The National Security Council () (reporting name: NSC) is a federal institutional and consultative body chaired by the prime minister of Pakistan as its chairman. The NSC is a principal forum that is mandated for considering national security and foreign policy matters with the senior national security advisers and Cabinet ministers. The idea and inception of National Security Council was first conceived in 1969 under the President Yahya Khan, its functions were to advise and assist the president and prime minister on national security and foreign policies.

The National Security Council was re-created by then-President and former General Pervez Musharraf in April 2004 under the National Security Council Act. Although, the NSC remains to as a statutory body, the National Security Council is not active since 2008, and the Cabinet Committee on National Security is fulfilling the role and purpose of the NSC. The first National Security Adviser was Tariq Aziz who was appointed in 2004 and was preceded by Major-General (retired) Mahmud Durrani in 2008. Since Durrani&#x27;s deposing by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani in 2009, there has been no appointed new NSC adviser since then. The NSC was abandoned by the government of Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), with a unified confirmations from the Parliament, and its functions has been taken under control by the Defence Cabinet Committee as of 2009.

The council was revived under Nawaz Sharif, who presides over meetings of the council when there is an emergency, such as hostilities between India and Pakistan, or a chance to discuss events related to the insurgency.

==Structure==

===Former Constitution Basis===

The Constitution of Pakistan in the past provided for the National Security Council. However, the provision was repealed by the 18th Amendment.

===Permanent Officiates===
The membership position does not depend on the will of the chairman, who is the elected Prime Minister of Pakistan. Depending on the agenda of the meeting, other concerned persons are also invited in the meeting of the NSC.

The usual cabinet-level meetings at the NSC takes the following agenda and members of the following authorities are usually invited:

Current
*National Command Authority (NCA)
*Cabinet Committee on National Security (C2NS)
*Economic Coordination Committee (ECC)
Former
*Executive Committee of the Space Research Council (ECSRC) — deactivated since 1985.

==Functions==
The Council serves as a forum for consultation for the president and the federal government on matters of national security including the sovereignty, integrity, defence and security of the State and crisis management in general. It may also formulate recommendations to the president and the federal government in such matters.

===National Security Advisers===


==History==

===Inception: 1969–1971===
The Pakistan military has been sending many recommendations for the establishment of the National Security Council as akin and counterpart to the American National Security Council. A comprehensive report on NSC was written and submitted by the Chief of Naval Staff, Vice Admiral S.M. Ahsan in 1968. Admiral Ahsan submitted his handwritten report to President Yahya Khan&#x27;s staff in Islamabad in 1969 and emphasized support for the establishment of the military dominated national security council composed of senior civil and military officials who would advise the government on national security issues and propose strategies to overcome the challenges involving the foreign policy matters. The proposal was forwarded to President Office, and then to President Yahya Khan with strong recommendations for its approval.

In 1969, President Yahya Khan established the National Security Council, after signing and issuing the presidential decree to establish this consultative institution. Major-General Ghulam Omar was appointed NSC&#x27;s first secretary and was posted at the General Headquarters (GHQ) to perform operations of NSC under President Yahya Khan. The NSC secretariat was part of the President Office and the Chief Martial Law Administrator (CMLA) and was directly under the control of the military establishment which then-functioned under President Yahya Khan&#x27;s staff.

The NSC secretariat was highly unpopular in public and political circles of Pakistan, and it quickly gained notoriety in civil society due to its involvement in political and civilian affairs. The NSC secretariat did not figure in the decision-making of the military government because President Yahya Khan ran his government administration as personalized enterprise relaying heavily on his close and trusted military and bureaucratic advisers. The NSC Secretary, Major-General Ghulam Omar, was less focused on national issues whilst kept his interest in combat development. The NSC Secretariat under Yahya Khan was only a paper organization.

===The Genesis: 1985–1999===
The concept of National Security Council as a bridge of stabilizing the civil-military relations has always been favoured by the military spectrum of Pakistan since 1971. In 1973, Pakistan military has sent repeated recommendations of peculiar structure of the NSC in which senior military commanders of Pakistan Armed Forces are ensured a seat at the table. The proposal was met with heated criticism in the state parliament and Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto instead issued a white paper on Higher Defence Organisations (HDO) in May 1976, outlining
the institutional arrangements for dealing with defence and security affairs. This led the ultimate creation of the Defence Committee of the Cabinet (DCC) which has the mandate of responsibility of national defence rested with the prime minister. The DCC conveys matters to other important organisations involved in the national security decision-making on security affairs included the Ministry of Defence (MoD), the JS HQ of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee and its
Chairman, the Chiefs of Staff of the Pakistan Armed Forces.

After the enactment of the martial law by chief of army staff General Zia-ul-Haq in 1977, the DCC had remained active. After holding successful referendum, followed by non-partisan general elections in 1985, President General Zia-ul-Haq authored and inserted Article 152-A to the Constitution through the Revival of the Constitution Order (RCO), in March 1985. This led the establish a National Security Council for accommodating the high-ranking military leadership in policy making. The NSC was empowered to &quot;make recommendations relating to the issue of a Proclamation of Emergency under Article 232, security of Pakistan and any other matter of national importance that may be referred to it by the President in consultation with the Prime Minister.&quot;

The NSC was opposed by most political circles and it had to be dropped as a part of the deal with the Parliament to get the parliamentary approval for the revised version of the Revival of the Constitution Order (RCO) as Eighth Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan, in October 1985. The NSC was dissolved by Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto in 1993 and reactivated the DCC operationalize in its place.

From 1998–99, there were only two NSC meetings took place which were chaired by the Prime Minister Sharif; first occasion when Sharif ordered Pakistan&#x27;s nuclear tests in response to India&#x27;s tests, as part of his tit-for-tat policy. At the NSC cabinet meeting, the Pakistani government, military, scientific, and civilian officials were participating in a debate, broadening, and complicating the decision-making process. Although, General Karamat debated towards presenting the national security and military point of view, the final decision was left on Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s say. After the decision was made, General Karamat was notified of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif&#x27;s decision and asked the military to be stand-by orders. After providing the joint military logistics, the nuclear tests were eventually carried out on 28 May 1998, as Chagai-I, and on 30 May 1998 as codename: Chagai-II. As dawn broke over the Chagai mountains, Pakistan became the world&#x27;s seventh nuclear power.

Secondly, the NSC meeting took place during the heights of the Kargil War in 1999. Empowerment of the NSC at the bureaucratic level was the primary issue that led to the forced relieve of Chairman Joint Chiefs General Jehangir Karamat in 1998. In an absence of the forum, the upheavals in civil–military relations led to the dismissal of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999 when he tried to dismissed then-Chairman Joint Chiefs Pervez Musharraf.

===Reconstruction and developments: 2004–2008===
After staging a coup d&#x27;état against the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in 1999, Chairman joint chiefs Pervez Musharraf announced the establishment of six member national security council in his first television speech. Through a presidential act, the concept of NSC was formally established under an order of the chief executive on 30 October 1999. The presidential order also led the establishment of the National Reconstruction Bureau (NRB) as a think tank. Although NRB gained quick constitutional establishment in 2000 the NSC&#x27;s constitutional establishment did not really take off due to political consensus over the establishment of this institution. Finally in 2004, Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz presented the National Security Council through an Act of Parliament and succeeded in constitutionally establishing the NSC for the first time in April 2004. Originally the NSC bill proposed that the NSC would also deal with the &quot;matters relating to democracy, governance, and inter-provincial harmony.&quot; This sentence was later controversially replaced by President Musharraf with &quot;crisis management&quot; without explaining its operational. President and Chief of Army Staff General Pervez Musharraf created the office in &quot;Aiwan-e-Sadr&quot;, and appoint civil bureaucrat Tariq Aziz as the first National Security Advisor. According to PILDT, since its reestablishment, Musharraf conveyed very few national security meetings, and most meetings were conducted to discuss political situations only.
He resigned from the post of NSC secretariat when Musharraf resigned from presidency on 18 August 2008. He was succeeded by Mahmud Ali Durrani as the second National Security Advisor, directly reporting to the Prime minister Secretariat. Durrani was notably deposed by the prime minister Yousaf Raza Gillani in January 2009 for &quot;not consulting the Prime Minister while giving statements on foreign relation matters&quot;. The matter in question was the acceptance by the Government of Pakistan of the Pakistani nationality of the sole surviving terrorist Ajmal Kasab, who was involved in the 2008 Mumbai attacks and was in the custody of the Mumbai police.

===Abolition and suspension (2008–2009)===
After the incident, Prime Minister Gillani vowed to abolish the National Security Council in February 2009. The NSC remains to stay as statue on the constitution, however, the NSC secretariat is not active since 2008, but instead the Defence Committee of the Cabinet is re-activated in its place by the current government.

Since 2009, there has been no appointed new NSC adviser and no national security meetings have been conducted since then. Its operations and mandate has been integrated to the DCC meeting, and there has been ninth DCC meeting taken place since 2009.

===Restorative status (2013–present)===
Upon conclusion of the general elections in 2013, the PML(N)&#x27;s strategists indicated the restoration of the NSC to the news media. On immediate basis, Prime Minister Sharif appointed Sartaj Aziz as National Security Advisor (NSA). On 9 September 2013, Prime Minister Sharif proposed that dialogue with the Pakistani military would create a civil-military partnership, putting the military and an elected government on the same page for the first time in Pakistan&#x27;s history. After reconstituting the Cabinet Committee on National Security (C2NS), with military gaining representation in the country&#x27;s politics, the NSC came into effect as an influential policy institution.

Decision came from Prime Minister Sharif to reconstitute the NSC to improve coordination between the civil and military institutions in order to deal with a nagging far-right insurgency that has killed and maimed thousands of Pakistanis over the last few years.

According to the political scientist and civic-military relations expert, Aqil Shah, Sharif finally did what exactly former chairman joint chiefs General Karamat had called for in 1998. Since then, the NSC meetings with Prime Minister Sharif have been taking place frequently.

<text>The Battle of Argaon (also known as Battle of Argaum) took place on 29 November 1803, between the British under the command of Major-General Arthur Wellesley (later the Duke of Wellington) and the forces of the Bhonsles of Berar and the Scindias of Gwalior.

==Prelude==
After Raghoji II Bhonsle and Daulat Rao Scindia were defeated at the Battle of Laswari, they moved south on 28 November 1803. In 1803, Nizam Ali Khan fell gravely ill, prompting Daulat Rao Shinde and the Bhonsale to invade his territories.

==Battle==

British forces, under the command of Colonel Stevenson and Wellesley, defeated the Marathas at the Battle of Adgaon. This victory allowed the Nizam to regain control of all Maratha claims in Berar, thereby putting an end to the Bhonsales&#x27; rule over the region. Nizam Ali Khan died later that same year, and he was succeeded by his son Sikander Jah, also known as Asaf Jah III.

<text>Assaye is a small village in the Jalna district of the state of Maharashtra in western India. The village was the location of the Battle of Assaye in 1803, fought between the Maratha Empire and the British East India Company.

It became the first real victory for the young general Arthur Wellesley (later Duke of Wellington). Here he commanded a vastly outnumbered combined force of British and Sepoy regiments against a mixed modernised and tribal Maratha army. He always described this as his greatest military victory.

<text>Oskar Albinus &quot;Albin&quot; Stenroos (24 February 1889 – 30 April 1971) was a Finnish runner, who won the marathon at the 1924 Olympics.

Stenroos ran his first marathon in 1909, placing third at the national championships, but then moved to shorter distances, down to 1500 m. He would run his next marathon in 1924. In 1910, he won the 10,000 m race at the Finnish nationals. In the absence of Hannes Kolehmainen, Stenroos won the national titles over 5000 m and 10,000 m from 1912 to 1916 and the cross country title in 1915–1917.

At the 1912 Summer Olympics, Stenroos won the bronze medal over 10,000 m behind Kolehmainen. He also finished sixth in the cross country and aided his team to second place. In 1915, he ran his first world record over 30 km (1:48:06.2), which he improved in 1924 (1:46:11.6). He also held the 20 km world record in 1923 (1:07:11.2). He skipped the 1920 Summer Olympics, but decided to run the marathon in 1924. He won the race in hot conditions, beating second-placed Romeo Bertini by almost six minutes. He placed second at the 1926 Boston Marathon and retired after failing to finish in 1927.

<text>John Taylor Bell Foundry (Loughborough) Limited, trading as John Taylor &amp; Co and commonly known as Taylor&#x27;s Bell Foundry, Taylor&#x27;s of Loughborough, or simply Taylor&#x27;s, is the world&#x27;s largest working bell foundry. It is located in Loughborough, in the Charnwood borough of Leicestershire, England. The business originated in the 14th century, and the Taylor family took over in 1784.

The company manufactures bells for use in clock towers, rings of bells for change ringing, chimes, and carillons. In 2005, Taylor&#x27;s merged with Eayre &amp; Smith Limited (bellhangers) and from 2005 until 2009 was known as Taylors Eayre &amp; Smith Limited.

In September 2009, Taylor&#x27;s went into administration but was bought out of administration by a consortium named UK Bell Foundries Ltd, led by Andrew Wilby, which re-financed the business. Since then, the company has re-established its presence both in the UK and in export markets.

The foundry has a museum of bells and bellfounding, which is the only one of its kind in the UK. It is one of the few Victorian purpose-built manufacturing sites still being used for its original purpose. Its campanile contains the most-pealed bells in the world.

==History==

The present company is part of a line of bellfounders dating back to Johannes de Stafford in the 14th century, who was also a mayor of Leicester. The Taylor family became involved in 1784 with Robert Taylor (1759–1830), and a foundry was established in Loughborough in 1839 by his son John Taylor (1797–1858), moving to the current site in 1859. The Taylors also had foundries in Oxford and St Neots between 1786 and 1854.

During much of the later 19th century, the foundry was under the management of John William Taylor (1827–1906). Taylor&#x27;s was the first bellfounder to adopt &quot;true-harmonic&quot; tuning in the late 19th century. In 1963, Paul Taylor, last of the Taylor family in the business, appeared on the American TV panel show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, challenging the panel with his occupation as a bell maker.

The foundry is based in buildings on Freehold Street, which are Grade II* listed. The National Twelve Bell Contest is competed for annually by the leading teams in England for &quot;The Taylor Trophy&quot;.

On 18 September 2009, the company went into administration. Mazars, which had previously been acting as advisors to the company during attempts to secure extra funding, were appointed administrators. On 2 October 2009, it was reported that the administrators were &quot;optimistic about its future.&quot; On 15 October 2009, in a statement released by UK Bell Foundries Ltd, a consortium of ringers, members of the bell industry and other investors, it was stated that the foundry would reopen on 19 October, reverting to the previous name of John Taylor &amp; Co. Paul Taylor&#x27;s widow, Mrs Merle Taylor, was honorary president of the new company until her death.

The board from 2015 to 2020 comprised Andrew W R Wilby (chairman and CEO), Laith R Reynolds, David E Potter, Michael J Semken, Simon E Adams, D Paul Mason and Andrew B Mills. In 2016, the directors of UK Bell Foundries Ltd founded the Loughborough Bellfoundry Trust and transferred ownership of the buildings, equipment, intellectual property and the museum to that body in perpetuity to safeguard it for the future. The Trust received emergency grants to restore several parts of the building from Historic England, as it was listed as a Grade II* building at risk. Further restoration was planned.

In 2018, the company established a subsidiary called John Taylor International, based in Australia, to serve the southern hemisphere markets. At the end of 2020, Andrew Wilby resigned as director and CEO; David Potter also resigned as director. Andrew&#x27;s son Michael Wilby was managing director from October 2019 to August 2021.

==Notable bells and rings ==
In 1881 at Loughborough, Taylor&#x27;s cast &quot;Great Paul&quot; (the largest British cast bell in Britain) for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London, weighing or more than 17 metric tons. Rock band AC/DC used a 2000-pound cast bronze bell for the song &quot;Hells Bells&quot;, which was originally used on the Back in Black Tour in 1980.

Many churches around the world have used bells cast at Taylor&#x27;s bell foundry, including:

<text>Vytautas Magnus University (VMU) (, VDU) is a public university in Kaunas, Lithuania. The university was founded in 1922 during the interwar period as an alternate national university.

Initially it was known as the University of Lithuania, but in 1930 the university was renamed to &quot;Vytautas Magnus University&quot;, commemorating the 500th anniversary of the death of the Lithuanian ruler Vytautas the Great, who is known for the nation&#x27;s greatest historical expansion in the 15th century.

It is one of the leading universities of Lithuania, and has about 8,800 students, including Master&#x27;s students and Ph.D. candidates There are a little over 1000 employees, including approximately 90 professors.

== History ==

=== Establishment of University ===

In 1918 with the establishment of the independent Republic of Lithuania, the State Council decided to reestablish Vilnius University. Since Vilnius was later under Polish administration and the Lithuanian government had to be transferred to Kaunas, this decision was not put into effect.

At the beginning of 1920, Higher Courses of Study were established in Kaunas, laying the foundation for the establishment of a university. The Lithuanian Cabinet of Ministers decided to establish the University of Lithuania in Kaunas, 13 February 1922. The ceremonial opening of the university took place 16 February 1922, while on the 12th of April the President of Lithuania confirmed the university&#x27;s Statute along with six faculties: Theology-Philosophy, Humanities, Law, Mathematics and Sciences, Medicine and Technical Studies.

The affiliate Agricultural Academy was founded in 1924 on the basis of the Agronomy and Forestry sections of the Faculty of Mathematics and Sciences; in 1936 the Veterinary Academy was established in a similar fashion on the basis of the Veterinary section of the Faculty of Medicine.

On 7 June 1930, commemorating the 500th anniversary of the death of Vytautas the Great, the university was renamed in his honor (, ).

=== World War II ===

In 1940, Vytautas Magnus University contributed to the reestablishment of Vilnius University. In the winter, the faculties of Humanities and Law were transferred to Vilnius whilst the Faculty of Mathematics and Sciences was moved in the summer. The occupation of Lithuania by the Soviet Union forced the university to be named the University of Kaunas in the summer of 1940. At the beginning of 1941, university professors took an active role in establishing the Lithuanian Academy of Sciences.

The Lithuanian Provisional Government restored the name of Vytautas Magnus to the university after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in the summer of 1941. The German occupation government closed the university in March 1943, after Lithuanians refused to form an SS battalion.

The university was reopened by the Soviet authorities of Lithuania in autumn 1944. Four faculties of History-Philology, Medicine, Construction, and Technology were established. The transfer of the Faculty of Philosophy to Vilnius was the reason why the University of Kaunas was closed in the fall of 1949. The university was restructured into Kaunas Polytechnic Institute and the Kaunas Medical Institute on October 31, 1950.

=== Re-establishment of University ===
The government passed the law on re-establishing the Vytautas Magnus University on 4 July 1989 and the cabinet registered the temporary Statute later that month. The first academic year began in the university&#x27;s re-established Faculties of Economics, Humanities and Sciences on 1 September 1989.

The re-established university was the second in then Soviet-occupied Lithuania, and the first school of higher education that was independent of governmental institutions. The most important principle in the university&#x27;s activity became academic freedom, while its main purpose was to prepare graduates with a broad humanistic orientation for Lithuania&#x27;s needs in research, culture, education and economy.

A common program of study in humanities and general education for the first two years of study for all students appeared in 1990. Its aim was to develop well-rounded individuals who were free and creative.

In 1991 the university was the first in Lithuania to establish in a system of study based on several levels, the completion of which resulted in the granting of Bachelor&#x27;s or Master&#x27;s degrees, as well as Doctoral degrees. The feature of this university still remains exceptional in Lithuania today: this is a liberal policy for studies, according to which students are admitted not into specific specializations but into fields of study.

The students themselves put together their plan of study and make a final choice of their program after the first two years of study. Particular attention is given to foreign languages and computer skills, making this university different from other schools of higher education in the country.

During the university&#x27;s first decade the number of students and teachers grew more than twenty times. It has become the center for academic work in the Humanities and Social Sciences, Theology and Fine Arts, Political Sciences and Law in Kaunas. Modern programs have been expanding in Informatics, Environmental Sciences, Biology, Mathematics and Physics.

Master&#x27;s and Doctoral studies became a priority at the university and demanded a pedagogical staff with high qualifications. Therefore, the university invited to its classrooms and laboratories the most celebrated of scholars from Lithuania&#x27;s research institutes, creating in 1993 the first Research and Study Association in Lithuania. Ten Lithuanian research institutes formed this association together with the university: the Institutes for Lithuanian History, Lithuanian Language, Lithuanian Literature and Folklore, Lithuanian Philosophy and Sociology, biochemistry, Mathematics and Informatics, Semiconductor Physics, Psychophysiology and Rehabilitation, Architecture and Civil Engineering, and Lithuanian Forestry.

The university has the right to grant doctoral degrees in nineteen scholarly fields and their branches and the Doctor Habilitus in eight fields. The pedagogical titles of professor and associate professor may be granted in the fields of Humanities, Social Sciences, Physics and Biomedicine.

<text>Pierre de Bérulle (; 4 February 1575 – 2 October 1629) was a French Catholic priest, cardinal and statesman in 17th-century France. He was the founder of the French school of spirituality and counted among his disciples Vincent de Paul and Francis de Sales, although both developed significantly different spiritual theologies.

==Life==

Bérulle was born in the Château of Cérilly, near Troyes in Champagne, into two families of distinguished magistrates on 4 February 1575. The château de Cérilly is situated in the modern department of Yonne, while the village adjacent to it, Bérulle, is in Aube. He was educated by the Jesuits at Clermont and at the Sorbonne in Paris. He published his first work, his &quot;Bref Discours de l&#x27;abnegation interieure&quot;, in 1597. Soon after his ordination as a priest in 1599, he assisted Cardinal Duperron in his public controversy with the Protestant Philippe de Mornay, and made numerous converts.

With the co-operation of his cousin, Madame Acarie (Marie of the Incarnation), in 1604 he introduced the Discalced Carmelite nuns of the reform of Teresa of Ávila into France.

In 1608, Vincent de Paul moved to Paris, where he came under the influence of Abbé (later Cardinal) Pierre de Bérulle, whom he took as his spiritual director for a time. De Bérulle was responsible for De Paul taking up an appointment to the parish of Clichy.

A mainstay of the Counter-Reformation in France, in 1611 Bérulle founded in Paris the Congregation of the French Oratory, on the model of the one founded in 1556 by Philip Neri at Rome. The French congregation, however, varied in important respects from the Italian Oratory.

==Statesman==
Bérulle was a chaplain to King Henry IV of France, and several times declined his offers to be made a bishop. He obtained the necessary dispensations from Rome for Henrietta Maria&#x27;s marriage to Charles I, and acted as her chaplain during the first year of her stay in England. In 1626, as French ambassador to Spain, he concluded the favourable Treaty of Monzón, to which his enemy Cardinal Richelieu found objections. After the reconciliation of King Louis XIII with his mother, Marie de Medici, through his agency, he was appointed a councillor of state, but had to resign this office, owing to his pro-Habsburg policy, which was opposed by Richelieu. For religious reasons, Cardinal Bérulle favored the allegiance of France with Austria and Spain, the other Catholic powers, while Cardinal Richelieu wanted to undermine their influence in Europe. He was made cardinal by Pope Urban VIII on 30 August 1627, but never received the red hat.

Bérulle died October 2, 1629, in Paris, while celebrating Mass, and was buried in the chapel of the Oratorian College of Juilly.

==French School of Spirituality==
In the early part of his career, Bérulle was confident of the ability of the individual to both remake society and reform the church. Relying on human reason and diligent effort, he worked to convert the Huguenots through theological treatises and conferences. When his efforts seemed to have little effect, he came to the realization that everything depended on God, and that one should attempt to live in accordance with the will of God without concern for success or failure.

Bérulle is generally regarded as being an initiator of the French School of Spirituality, a powerful spiritual, missionary, and reform movement that animated the church in France in the early seventeenth century. The movement was characterized by a deep sense of God&#x27;s grandeur and of the Church as the Body of Christ, a pessimistic Augustinian view of man that nonetheless stressed positive potential through God, and a strong apostolic and missionary commitment. Cornelius Jansen and Jean du Vergier de Hauranne (the Abbé (Abbot) of Saint-Cyran), key collaborators of Bérulle, worked together to promote an Augustinian penitential theology, hoping that Bérulle’s Oratory would be the means by which the theology would displace that of &quot;laxist&quot; Jesuits. 

Bérulle&#x27;s depiction of the mystical journey through Mary to Christ, and through Christ to the Trinity is a hallmark of the French School of spirituality. 

It has been asserted that the term &quot;school&quot; is potentially problematic, though, because at least some other cited members of this &quot;school,&quot; such as Jean Eudes, Jean-Jacques Olier, Louis-Marie Grignion de Montfort, and Jean-Baptiste de La Salle, do not simply develop the thought of Bérulle, but all have their own significant insights. It has, therefore, been asserted that the &quot;school&quot; does not have simply one founder. However, the many common elements (such as an emphasis on living in the Spirit of Jesus, particular forms of meditative prayer, and, in some measure, a spiritual theology of priesthood taught in seminaries influenced by French School since the 1600s), means that it can be considered as a distinct tradition of spirituality, more recently known as Berullism.

==Berullian Spiritual Theology of Priesthood==
Substantial and polemicized Lutheran, Calvinist, and Counter-Reformation theological and philosophical notions have been noted in Berulle&#x27;s spiritual theology of priesthood. This spiritual theology created a sea change in the Roman Catholic theology of the priesthood, principally through an over-identification with Christ, according to Clare McGrath-Merkle. Berullian clerical spirituality has been characterized by a negative spiritual anthropology of self-annihilationism and neantism in which the priest must lose his identity to make room for that of Christ.

==Philosophy and works==
Bérulle encouraged Descartes&#x27; philosophical studies, and it was through him that the Samaritan Pentateuch, recently brought over from Constantinople, was inserted in Lejay&#x27;s &quot;Bible Polyglotte&quot; (1628–45).

Bérulle has been claimed to be an opponent of the abstract school of mysticism that bypassed the humanity of Christ, although his own method of prayer included a focus on adoring the being of Christ himself, considered in the abstract; Pope Urban VIII called him the &quot;apostle of the incarnate Word&quot;.

The Carmelite nuns who were brought to France by Bérulle objected to his attempts to influence their spirituality. Nevertheless, Berullian influences did remain within the spirituality of female Carmelite monastic communities and perdured into the 20th century, until Blessed Marie-Eugene OCD visited the communities to provide standard Carmelite spiritual formation.

In his &quot;Discours de l&#x27;état et des grandeurs de Jésus&quot; Bérulle emphasized Jesus as the Incarnate Word of God, and the abasement, self-surrender, servitude and humiliation— all Bérulle&#x27;s words— of his Incarnation. He even took the Incarnation as the defining characteristic of his spirituality and his Oratory, when he asked Christ &quot;that, in this piety, devotion, and special servitude to the mystery of Your Incarnation and of Your humanized divinity and deified humanity, be our life and our state, our spirit and our particular difference.&quot; 

The chief works of Cardinal de Bérulle are: 
* &quot;Bref discours de l&#x27;abnégation intérieure&quot; (&quot;Brief Discourse on Interior Abnegation&quot;), (1597). 
* &quot;Traité des énergumènes&quot; (&quot;Treatise on the Possessed&quot;), (Troyes, 1599). (This addresses the nature of diabolical possession, a topic of much controversy at the time. Diabolical possession, Bérulle argued, consists &quot;precisely in a right which the malign spirit has of residing in [the possessed person&#x27;s] body and of altering it in some manner.&quot; At its heart lay the profound diabolical hostility to the Incarnation, such that Satan, through possession, attempts to ape God, becoming &quot;incarnate&quot; himself.)
* &quot;Trois Discours de controverse&quot; (&quot;Three Discourses of Controversy&quot;), (Paris, 1609), on various subjects. 
* &quot;Discours de l&#x27;état et des grandeurs de Jésus&quot; (&quot;Discourse on the State and Grandeurs of Jesus&quot;), (Paris, 1623). This work was reprinted several times; the substance and often the actual expressions are to be found in the diffuse &quot;Méditations&quot; of Father Bourgoing and also in Bossuet&#x27;s &quot;Elévations sur les mystères&quot;. The work was also popular among Jansenists. Translated as &quot;Discourses on the State and Grandeurs of Jesus: The Ineffable Union of the Deity with Humanity&quot;, trans. Lisa Richmond (Washington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press, 2023).
* &quot;Vie de Jésus&quot; (&quot;Life of Jesus&quot;), (Paris, 1629). This was a sequel to the preceding work, which the author left unfinished at the time of his death, having only had the time to consider the mystery of the Annunciation and partially (in a draft) the Visitation.
* &quot;Elévation à Jésus-Christ sur Sainte Madeleine&quot; (&quot;Elevation to Jesus Christ Regarding St. [Mary] Magdalene&quot;), (Paris, 1627).

In addition, Bérulle wrote a number of short devotional works (&quot;Œuvres de pieté&quot;) and documents for the guidance of the Oratory.

Bérulle&#x27;s works, edited by P. Bourgoing (2 vols., 1644) were reprinted, by Migne in 1857.

A selected modern English translation is available as &quot;Bérulle and the French School: Selected Writings&quot;, trans. Lowell M Glendon, (New York: Paulist Press, 1989).

<text>Pierre Batcheff (Russian: Пьер Батчефф; 23 June 1901? – 13 April 1932) was a French actor of Russian origin. He became a popular film actor from the mid-1920s until the early 1930s, and among his best-known work was the surrealist short film (1929), made by Luis Buñuel in collaboration with Salvador Dalí. After appearing in about twenty-five films, he died at an early age from a drug overdose.

==Life==
Pierre Batcheff was born in Harbin in China and he grew up in Saint Petersburg. (One source says that his birth name was Benjamin Batcheff and that he adopted the name Pierre later from his father.) When war broke out in 1914, his family were on holiday in Switzerland and they decided to remain there, at first in Lausanne and then Geneva. Batcheff&#x27;s father went bankrupt around 1917, leaving the family in financial difficulty, and Pierre started taking small parts in Georges Pitoëff&#x27;s theatre company in Geneva. Between 1919 and 1921 he attended the Collège Calvin. In 1921, Batcheff moved with his family to Paris where he worked at first as a theatre actor.

Batcheff&#x27;s earliest leading role in the cinema was in 1923 in &quot;Claudine et le poussin&quot;, in the first of several performances as a young aristocratic lover. In the next few years he made films with Marcel L&#x27;Herbier, Jean Epstein, and Abel Gance. By 1927 he was established as a popular young leading man, with interviews and covers photos in film magazines. He was at the same time dissatisfied with the type of roles which he was offered and he cultivated links with avant-garde circles, especially the surrealists. In 1927 he met Luis Buñuel and their discussions led to their subsequent collaboration on in the following year.

In 1926 Batcheff met Denise Piazza, the daughter of a publisher, and they married in 1930. As Denise Batcheff, and later Denise Tual, she became a film editor and producer.

In the ten years of his film career, Batcheff made around 25 films. At the time of his death, he was engaged in a project with Jacques Prévert to write and direct a film which proved to be sufficiently radical to alarm some financial backers. Batcheff&#x27;s behaviour showed signs of stress and became increasingly erratic, and in April 1932 he died from an overdose of drugs, possibly by suicide.

One of the Parisian newspapers reporting on his death summarised his contemporary appeal as an actor: &quot;As an artist, he brought an extremely personal tone of refinement, of sensitivity and of melancholy, which was not devoid of strength, and this earned him a very wide popularity&quot;. It also noted that on the day after his death he had been due to sign a contract with a producer to direct his first film.

<text>Jacques Davy Duperron (; 15 November 1556 – 6 December 1618) was a French politician and Roman Catholic cardinal.

==Family and Education==
Jacques Davy du Perron was born in Saint-Lô in Normandy, into the Davy family, which belonged to the Norman minor nobility, in the branch &quot;Davy du Perron&quot; named after a property near St. Lô (in French his name is spelled Jacques Davy du Perron). He is never referred to as &quot;Davy&quot;, and he usually signs his documents &quot;Du Perron&quot;. The spelling &quot;Duperron&quot; is almost certainly wrong.

His father Julien was a physician, who, on embracing the doctrines of the Reformation, became a Protestant minister; his mother was Ursine Le Cointe, daughter of Guillaume Le Cointe, sieur de Tot et d&#x27; Héranville en Cotentin. During the siege of Rouen in 1562 by the troops of King Charles IX, Julien his father was arrested and imprisoned in Old Palais in Rouen. Ursine and her two children escaped through the royal lines and eventually was reunited with her husband in Bas Normandie. To escape persecution the family settled at Bern, in Switzerland. There Jacques received his education, being taught Latin and mathematics by his father, and learning Greek and Hebrew and the philosophy then in vogue, Aristotelianism, as well as that of Thomas Aquinas and that of the Calvinist favorite, St. Augustine of Hippo.

During the disorders following the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day Massacre (23–24 August 1572 in Paris; a month later in Normandy) the family fled to the Island of Jersey, which was under Protestant English control.

==Career under Henry III==

Returning to Normandy, du Perron&#x27;s existence and his talents were drawn to the attention of a courtier who was visiting General Jacques of Matignon, the Governor of Normandy. This courtier, named Lancosme, took du Perron along with him when he returned to Blois, where the new King, Henry III of France, was residing. He was presented to the King one evening during dinner, where he acquitted himself well both in speaking and in answering questions posed by the King&#x27;s attendants.

After he had abjured Protestantism, by 1578 probably, he was again presented by Philippe Desportes, abbot of Tiron, as a young man without equal for knowledge and talent. He was appointed Reader to the King by Henry III [&quot;Lecteur de la chambre du Roy&quot;]. In 1578 he is also mentioned as &quot;Professeur du Roy aux langues, aux mathematiques, et en la philosophie&quot;. He was commanded to preach before the king at the convent of Vincennes (1585), when the success of his sermon on the love of God, and of a funeral oration on the poet Ronsard (on 24 February 1586, after dinner), induced him to take orders. On the death of Mary, Queen of Scots (8 February 1587), he was chosen by the King to compose a poem in her honor and about her fate.

==Career under Henry IV==

On the death of Henry III (2 August 1589), after having supported for some time the cardinal de Bourbon, the head of the league against the king, Du Perron eventually became a faithful servant of Henry IV. On 13 February 1590, however, he found himself compelled to write directly to the King, begging him not to believe the many calumnies being spread about by his enemies. On 11 December 1591 du Perron was appointed by the King bishop of Évreux. The Pope finally approved of the appointment at a Consistory on Monday 11 December 1595. He was finally consecrated in Rome on 27 December 1595 by Cardinal François de Joyeuse; the co-consecrators were Archbishop Guillaume d&#x27;Avançon of Embrun and Anne d&#x27;Escars de Givry, bishop of Lisieux. On 4 November 1596 he was one of those who attended the Assemblée des Notables at Rouen. He and Marechal de Matignon represented Normandy in the Third Chamber.

He instructed Henry in the Catholic religion; and in 1594 was sent to Rome with secretary Denis-Simon de Marquemont, where with the help of Abbé Arnaud d&#x27;Ossat (1536–1604), later Cardinal d&#x27;Ossat (1599-1604), they obtained Henry&#x27;s absolution from the status of relapsed heretic. Du Perron and d&#x27;Ossat performed the act of abjuration of Henri&#x27;s heresy on the steps of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica on 17 September 1595, thereby ending six years of controversy over the status of France and its King in the eyes of the Papacy. He departed Rome on 28 March 1596. On his return to his diocese, Du Perron&#x27;s zeal and eloquence were largely instrumental in withstanding the progress of Calvinism, and among others he converted and the Swiss general Sancy and Henry Sponde, who became bishop of Pamiers. At the conference at Fontainebleau in 1600 he argued with much eloquence and ingenuity against Du Plessis Mornay (1549–1623).

==Cardinal du Perron==

On 9 June 1604 the Bishop of Évreux was created a cardinal by Pope Clement VIII, at the request of King Henri IV. In a letter of 17 June 1604, King Henry IV was able to inform the Bishop that the Pope had indeed named him a cardinal. His red hat was bestowed personally by the King in a public assembly at Fontainebleau. His speech of thanks to the King on that occasion survives. He then set out for Rome to partake in the ceremonies of his elevation; he was sent to Rome, departing Fontainebleau on 29 October 1604 as &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; de France. His instructions from Henri IV required him to hold conversations with the Duke of Savoy and the Duke of Tuscany along the way. He and the Grand Duke discussed, among other things, possible candidates for the Papacy in the next Conclave, most especially the Great-grand nephew of Leo X, Cardinal Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, Archbishop of Florence and Bishop of Palestrina. Cardinal de&#x27;Medici was well known in the French Court, since he had been &quot;Legatus a latere&quot; in France (1596-1598). Henry also sent along general instructions for the French Cardinals in Rome, anticipating a vacancy in the Papal throne. Cardinal du Perron made his solemn entry into Rome on 18 December. In the Consistory of 7 January 1605 he was named Cardinal Priest of S. Agnese in Agone, in Piazza Navona (where the current baroque church was not begun until 1652).

Immediately upon his appointment, Clement VIII found important work for du Perron in Rome. The Pope had formed a special commission, the Congregation &quot;de auxiliis&quot;, the chairmanship of which he retained for himself. But he appointed Cardinal du Perron to the Congregation. The purpose of this commission was to investigate and decide upon the work of the Jesuit theologian Luis de Molina, which had raised the acute question of God&#x27;s Providence and human free will. Du Perron attended his first session on 21 January.

When Clement VIII died on Thursday 3 March 1605, the Congregation was suspended, and du Perron found himself involved in his first Conclave. Although he was not the leader of the French faction, he contributed loyally, after the failure of the candidacies of Cardinals Baronius and Seraphin, to the election of the French King&#x27;s candidate, Cardinal de&#x27; Medici, Leo XI, to the papal throne. Du Perron sent off a long letter to Henry IV, reporting the day-to-day movements inside the Conclave in great detail. On the death of Leo XI only twenty-four days later, du Perron participated in the election of Cardinal Camillo Borghese as Paul V. At the conclusion of the Coronation festivities, Cardinal du Perron wrote a report of the Conclave for Henry IV.

After his election, Paul V decided to continue the Congregation &quot;de auxiliis&quot;, and therefore du Perron was one of the Judges who began meeting again on 14 September 1605. He complained in a letter to Henry IV that he was constrained to read everything that had been published on the question during the previous eight or nine years. Although he appeared to work well with the Jesuit Cardinal Robert Bellarmine, in presenting the positions of Molinism fairly, du Perron&#x27;s repeated counsel was not to take any decisions on the basic issues of the matter. Du Perron, after all, had strong Augustinian tendencies, which tended to make Molina&#x27;s positions uncongenial. Even when he had returned to France in 1607, the Jesuits kept attempting to draw him into their circle, but without success.

But, while du Perron was still in Rome, Pope Paul V decided to pick a quarrel with the Republic of Venice, over its conduct in exercising its sovereign rights. The Venetian government had passed a law against alienation of property in favor of the Church, and another requiring governmental approval for the building of new churches. In addition, there was the very old argument over the exemption of the clergy from civil court jurisdiction. On 17 April 1606 Pope Paul launched a bull against Venice, imposing an interdict on all the territories belonging to the Serenissima. This was certain to lead to war, and would very likely excite the greed of Spain for additional territory in Lombardy. Henry IV, wishing to prevent this, proposed mediation between the Pope and Venice, and offered Cardinal de Joyeuse and Cardinal du Perron as mediators. The status of the Jesuits, who supported the papal interdict, became the main sticking point; the Venetians wanted them gone. Finally, due to the forceful persuasion of Cardinal de Joyeuse (du Perron claimed to be ill), the Pope gave way, the edict was withdrawn, and the crisis averted. Nonetheless, for the work that he had done, the Republic offered du Perron its thanks.

In 1606, while still in Rome, du Perron was appointed archbishop of Sens by the King, an act approved by Pope Paul V in Consistory on 9 October 1606. Like his predecessor at Sens, he became Primate of the Gauls and Germany, and Grand Almoner of the King of France (which also made him President of the Bibliothèque du Roi, which at that time was located at Fontainebleau). He was also &quot;ex officio&quot; the director of the College Royal. The King also appointed him Commander of the Order of the Holy Spirit. Du Perron began his return to France in the Autumn of 1607. He was received by the Grand Duke of Tuscany in Florence, who wrote to King Henry in praise of du Perron on 21 September. He visited Cardinal Giustiniani in Bologna, and then went to Venice, from which he wrote to the King on 5 October. He then passed on toward France by way of Milan. After his return from Rome, he was present continually at the Royal Court for more than a year. He did not take possession of his throne in the Cathedral of Sens until 26 October 1608. After the death of Henry IV in 1610, he took an active part in the states-general of 1614, when he vigorously upheld the ultramontane doctrines against the Third Estate. His speech against an oath to the French crown, proposed at this Estates General, much like the English Oath of Allegiance, was printed in French and later translated into English. These publications occasioned a response from King James VI and I, to which the Cardinal replied (again, originally in French, with a later English translation).

He died on Wednesday 5 September 1618, at the age of 63. His viscera were entombed in the Jesuit church of Saint-Louis in Paris, while his body was buried in the Choir of his cathedral in Sens.

<text>Cramond Village (; ) is a village and suburb in the north-west of Edinburgh, Scotland, at the mouth of the River Almond where it enters the Firth of Forth.

The Cramond area has evidence of Mesolithic, Bronze Age and Roman activity. In modern times, it was the birthplace of the Scottish economist John Law (1671–1729). Cramond was incorporated into the City of Edinburgh by the Edinburgh Boundaries Extension and Tramways Act 1920 (10 &amp; 11 Geo. 5. c. lxxxvii).

==Etymology==

It was once believed that Cramond Roman Fort was known to the Romans as &quot;Alaterva&quot;. A stone altar was dug up in the grounds of Cramond House dedicated &quot;To the Alatervan Mothers and the Mothers of the Parade-ground.&quot; Early antiquarians interpreted the inscription as referring to the place where the stone was found, but this idea is no longer accepted among scholars, and &quot;Alatervae&quot; is presumably a native name for the deities the Matres and Matronae, perhaps originating with the Tungrian cohort who erected the altar.

In the centuries that followed the end of the Roman occupation, Cramond passed into the hands of the Votadini, who spoke Cumbric, a Brythonic Celtic language, and gave the settlement its name. Cramond is derived from the compound &quot;Caer Amon&quot;, meaning &#x27;fort on the river&#x27;, referring to the Roman fort that lay on the River Almond.

== History ==
===Early history===

==== Pre-Roman ====

Archaeological excavations at Cramond have uncovered evidence of habitation dating to around 8500 BC, making it, for a time, the earliest known site of human settlement in Scotland. The inhabitants of the Mesolithic camp-site were nomadic hunter-gatherers who moved around their territories according to the season of the year. Although no bones survived the acid soil, waste pits and stakeholes that would have supported shelters or windbreaks were excavated. Numerous discarded hazelnut shells, the waste product of the inhabitants&#x27; staple food, were found in the pits and used to carbon-date the site. It is thought the site was chosen for its location near the junction of the Firth of Forth and the River Almond, where the rich oyster and mussel beds proved a reliable natural resource. Many microlith stone tools manufactured at the site were found, and pre-date finds of similar style in England.

====Roman period====

Around 142, Roman forces arrived at Cramond by order of the Emperor Antoninus Pius, with the task of establishing a fort at the mouth of the River Almond. This fort would guard the eastern flank of the fortified frontier known as the Antonine Wall (named after the Emperor, as with Hadrian&#x27;s Wall) that the Romans had established across Scotland. Nearly five hundred men worked on the site, building a fort that covered nearly six acres, with a harbour for communication. However, the fort was only inhabited for a short time, perhaps fifteen years, before it was abandoned by the troops who were ordered to retreat south to Hadrian&#x27;s Wall. Pottery and coins of later date indicate that the fort and harbour were reinhabited and used as a base for the army and navy of the Emperor Septimius Severus, sometime between 208 and 211.

The medieval parish church of Cramond parish (which retains its late medieval western tower in altered form), was built within the Roman fort.

Though knowledge of the Roman presence at Cramond was recorded afterwards, the remains of the fort itself were only rediscovered in 1954. Substantial archaeological research was carried out upon its discovery to build up a reasonably accurate picture of the site in Roman times. The fort was rectangular in shape, with walls fifteen feet high on all sides. A gatehouse was set in every wall, allowing access in all four directions. Inside, there were barracks, workshops, granaries, headquarters and the commander&#x27;s house. Later excavations revealed other constructions outside the boundary of the fort, including a bath-house, further industrial workshops and a native settlement.

In 1997, the Cramond Lioness was uncovered in the harbour mud by a local boatman (who received a substantial monetary reward for finding this major antiquity), and was identified as a sandstone statue of a lioness devouring a hapless male figure, probably one of a pair at the tomb of a military commander. After conservation, the statue was put on display in the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. It is one of the most ambitious pieces of Roman sculpture to have survived in Scotland.

==== Medieval period ====
After the departure of the Romans, little is known about the state of Cramond for several centuries. The historiography of the period has been summed up by the historian J. Wood, who wrote &#x27;a dark cloud of obscurity again settled over the parish of Cramond, of which I cannot find the smallest memorial in any historian till the year 995.&#x27;

A tower house, Cramond Tower, probably built in the early 15th century, and part of a now-demolished larger establishment, was once a manor house of the Bishops of Dunkeld, of whose diocese Cramond was a part. It was made structurally sound and converted to a private dwelling in the 1980s.

===Modern history===


Cramond developed slowly over the centuries, with Cramond Kirk being founded in 1656. After a brief period spent as an industrial village in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, by the late 19th century it became a desirable suburb of Edinburgh, which it remains to this day.

Cramond was officially made part of Edinburgh on 1 November 1920.

On 21 February 2009, Philippa Langley began her successful Looking For Richard Project at the Cramond Inn.

==Geography==

Cramond is located in northwest Edinburgh, about from the city centre, at the mouth of the River Almond where it enters the Firth of Forth.

Historically, the parish of Cramond extended from the shore of the Firth of Forth in the north to the parish of Corstorphine in the south, and was bounded on the west by the parishes of Dalmeny and Kirkliston and on the east by the parish of St Cuthbert&#x27;s. It covered an area of fifteen square miles, and encompassed the villages of Granton, Pilton, Muirhouse, Davidson&#x27;s Mains, Blackhall, Ravelston, Craigcrook, Turnhouse and Craigiehall.

The area has a low, gently undulating topography that drops down from the top of Corstorphine hill to the shore in three gradual stages and is intersected by the River Almond which flows northward into the Forth. John Philip Wood writing in 1794 calls the river &quot;Amon&quot; and notes the stretch running from Craigiehall to the Firth of Forth has wooded, high and steep banks, &quot;frequently chequered with bold and overhanging rocks&quot;. During the last ice age the area was heavily glaciated, and the main direction of the ice flow was west to east. Consequently, there are rock deposits on the east side of landforms such as the Almond river valley, and until the Cramond promenade was built in the 1930s large glacial boulders were strewn along the shore.

The geology of Cramond consists of calciferous sandstone, which mixed with two later sills to give the area its characteristic chocolate-brown soil. The leaflet &quot;Geological history of cramond&quot; provides information about the geology of the cramond area such as that there is a coal seam visible near the beach on the south west side of the river almond estuary.

On the coast, west of the River Almond is Hunter&#x27;s Craig or Eagle Rock, with a carving traditionally maintained to be that of an eagle. The carving was described by William Maitland in 1753 to have become &quot;prey to time and the inclemency of the weather&quot;. Canmore states the age of the carving as uncertain and its present condition as extremely weathered.

==Landmarks and sculpture==
The 8 tonne work &quot;Fish&quot; has been permanently installed on the Waterfront at Cramond in 2009 after a successful campaign by the Cramond community, paying homage to the eight months of carving of the pink granite there by sculptor Ronald Rae in 2002.

Cramond Kirk Church Hall also displays the smaller &quot;Cramond Fish&quot;. In the car park, to the rear of the Kirk Hall, another sculpture (elephant) is taking shape.

==Architecture==

The older houses along the wharf are typical of traditional south-east Scottish vernacular architecture, constructed in stone with harling white lime render finish, with facing stone window and door surrounds and &quot;crow-step gables&quot;, roofed with orangey-red clay pantiles imported from the Netherlands. A ruined water mill lies further up the Almond along a quiet walk past a yacht club and sailing boats moored in the river. To the east a sand beach and waterfront esplanade provides a popular walk to Silverknowes and Granton. On the other side of the Almond, (once accessible by a rowing-boat ferry) the Dalmeny Estate has a pleasant walk through Dalmeny Woods along the shore of the Firth of Forth.

A rare example of a morthouse is located in the Church of Scotland churchyard.

Near the kirk stands the imposing Cramond House. Its central part is late 17th century, with classical front added in 1778 and back in 1820. Queen Victoria visited while residing at Holyrood. It has been claimed as a possible original of R. L. Stevenson’s &quot;House of Shaws&quot; in &quot;Kidnapped&quot;. It is now owned by Trustees of the Church of Scotland and until 2010 was used as the headquarters of the Scottish Wildlife Trust. The Trust relocated to Leith. The Manse dates originally from the mid-17th century and was rebuilt in the mid-18th century. The north wing was added about 1770 and a south wing in 1857. Reverend Walker, the skating minister in Raeburn&#x27;s famous portrait, lived here from 1776 to 1784.

Offshore, Cramond Island has WW II fortifications and is linked to land by a causeway with a line of concrete pylons on one side, constructed as an anti shipping barrier. At certain low tides, sand extends to the island, tempting visitors to visit the island, though occasionally some are stranded by the incoming tide.

== In fiction ==
Cramond is associated with &quot;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&quot;, where Mr. Lowther has his home and Miss Brodie spends much of her time. Cramond is also where the House of Shaws is located in Robert Louis Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Kidnapped&quot;. Cramond is also mentioned in Ian Rankin&#x27;s &quot;Fleshmarket Close&quot;.

Cramond features briefly in a series 2 episode of the &quot;Paul Temple (TV series)&quot; called &#x27;Double Vision&#x27; filmed in 1970. More recently Cramond featured in &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes: Fire Storm&quot;.
* Gary Mill&#x27;s historical fiction novel &#x27;Cramond&#x27; is set in Cramond during the Roman occupation circa AD 150

<text>Philippe Desportes or Desports (1546 – 5 October 1606) was a French poet.

==Biography==
Philippe Desportes was born in Chartres. While serving as secretary to the Bishop of Le Puy he visited Italy, where he learned Italian poetry. This experience became a good account. On his return to France he attached himself to the duke of Anjou, and followed him to Cracow on his election as king of Poland. Nine months in Poland satisfied the civilized Desportes, but in 1574 his patron became king of France as Henry III. He showered favours on the poet, who received, in reward for the skill with which he wrote occasional poems at the royal request, the abbey of Tiron and four other valuable benefices.

A good example of the light and dainty verse in which Desportes excelled is furnished by the well-known &quot;villanelle&quot; with the refrain &quot;Qui premier s&#x27;en repentira&quot;, which was on the lips of Henry, duke of Guise, just before his death. Desportes was above all an imitator. He imitated Petrarch, Ariosto, Sannazaro, and still more closely the minor Italian poets, and in 1604 a number of his plagiarisms were exposed in the &quot;Rencontres des Muses de France et d&#x27;Italie&quot;. As a sonneteer he showed much grace and sweetness, and English poets borrowed freely from him.

In his old age Desportes acknowledged his ecclesiastical preferment by a translation of the Psalms remembered chiefly for the brutal &quot;mot&quot; of Malherbe: &quot;Votre potage vaut mieux que vos psaumes.&quot; He published in 1573 an edition of his works including &quot;Diane&quot;, &quot;Les Amours d&#x27;Hippolyte&quot;, &quot;Elegies&quot;, &quot;Bergeries&quot;, &quot;Œuvres chrêtiennes&quot;, etc.

An edition of his &quot;Œuvres&quot;, by Alfred Michiels, appeared in 1858.

== Tributes ==

* His hometown, Chartres, pays homage to the poet by attributing to him the name of one of his ways, the rue Philippe-Desportes, which connects the street of Marshal Leclerc and that of Dr. Maunoury. Place des Halles, a stele is also erected in honor of the Chartrain poets Philipe Desportes and his nephew Mathurin Régnier.

<doc id="856246" wikidata="Q5016270" url="?curid=856246" title="Cadbury Dairy Milk">
<text>Cadbury Dairy Milk is a British brand of milk chocolate manufactured by Cadbury. It was introduced in the United Kingdom in June 1905 and now consists of a number of products. Every product in the Dairy Milk line is made exclusively with milk chocolate. In 1928, Cadbury introduced the &quot;glass and a half&quot; slogan to accompany the Dairy Milk chocolate bar, to advertise the bar&#x27;s higher milk content.

The bar was developed by George Cadbury Jr, and by 1914 it had become the company&#x27;s best-selling product. A century on it has retained its position as a market leader in the UK where it was ranked the best-selling chocolate bar 2014. It is manufactured and distributed by the Hershey Company in the United States under licence from Cadbury, with a recipe that differs from the UK version. The chocolate is now available in many countries, including China, India, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Bangladesh.

==History ==
In June 1905, in Birmingham, England, George Cadbury Jr made Cadbury&#x27;s first Dairy Milk bar, with a higher proportion of milk than previous chocolate bars; by 1914, it would become the company&#x27;s best-selling product. Through its development, the bar was variously called &#x27;Highland Milk&#x27;, &#x27;Jersey&#x27; and &#x27;Dairy Maid&#x27;. Accounts on the origin of the Dairy Milk name differ; it has been suggested that the name change came about on the advice of a shopkeeper in Plymouth, but Cadbury maintains that a customer&#x27;s daughter came up with the name.

Fruit and Nut was introduced as part of the Dairy Milk line in 1926, soon followed by Whole Nut in 1930. By that point, Cadbury&#x27;s was the brand leader in the United Kingdom. Almost a century on it has retained this position, with Dairy Milk ranking as the best-selling chocolate bar in the UK in 2014. In 2020, Dairy Milk was the second most popular snack overall in the UK behind McVitie&#x27;s Chocolate Digestive biscuits.

In 1928, Cadbury&#x27;s introduced the &quot;glass and a half&quot; slogan to accompany the Dairy Milk bar, to advertise the bar&#x27;s higher milk content. In the early 2010s, Cadbury made the decision to change the shape of the bar chunks to a more circular shape which also reduced the weight.

In 2003, Cadbury expanded the Dairy Milk brand range of new flavours and variants. Cadbury Dairy Milk was then the largest product range in Cadbury&#x27;s portfolio in the brand&#x27;s history. The new products launched were: Biscuit, Crunchie Bits, Bubbly, Mint Chips, Turkish, Crispies and the then recently introduced Wafer and Orange Chips, whilst Cadbury&#x27;s Caramel bar was also relaunched under the Dairy Milk brand.

In 2005, Cadbury celebrated the Centenary 100th Anniversary of Cadbury Dairy Milk.
special limited edition bars in reproduced original 1905 packaging was launched.

Also in 2005 Cadbury buried a time capsule at the Bournville factory in the Midlands. On the company&#x27;s website, Cadbury stated, &quot;We&#x27;re going to bury a Time Capsule that won&#x27;t be opened until Cadbury Dairy Milk is 200 years young. But, we need your help in deciding what we should leave for future generations.&quot;

In 2012, Cadbury won a trademark dispute in the United Kingdom for the distinctive purple colour (Pantone 2685C) of its chocolate bar wrappers, a colour originally introduced in 1914, as a tribute to Queen Victoria. In October 2013, however, an appeal by Nestlé successfully challenged Cadbury&#x27;s claim to the colour.

In July 2018, Cadbury announced it would launch a new Dairy Milk version with 30% less sugar. The chief nutritionist of Public Health England, Alison Tedstone, said she was &quot;pleased that Mondelez is the latest … name&quot; to offer &quot;healthier&quot; products.

On 8 January 2024, Mondelez International announced plans to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Cadbury. As part of the celebrations, seven retro limited edition packaging designs of Cadbury Dairy Milk bars were relaunched from 1915, 1940, 1961, 1980, 1993, 2003 and 2024.

==Variations==
The original Dairy Milk bar (&quot;with a glass and a half of fresh milk&quot;) was launched in 1905.

There are various bars, including: Caramel; Fruit &amp; Nut, a bar with raisins and almonds; Whole Nut, with hazelnuts; Dairy Milk Silk, launched in India, in 2010; Dairy Milk Ritz, a bar with salty Ritz crackers, launched in the United Kingdom in 2014; and Dairy Milk with LU biscuits. There is also Dairy Milk Oreo, a bar with an Oreo filling, also made as a mint flavoured bar .The 1970s television advertising campaign for the &quot;Whole Nut&quot; featured a series of commercials with the tag line &quot;Nuts, whole hazelnuts. Ooh! Cadbury&#x27;s taken them and they cover them in chocolate&quot;.

A Vegemite flavoured bar, which consists of milk chocolate, caramel, and Vegemite (5%), was launched in Australia in 2015.

==Ingredients and tastes for local markets==
According to a 2007 report in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, a British bar contained (in order) milk, sugar, cocoa mass, cocoa butter, vegetable fat and emulsifiers, whilst the American version manufactured by Hershey started its list of ingredients with sugar. It also listed lactose, emulsifier soy lecithin, and &quot;natural and artificial flavorings&quot;. Cadbury supplied its chocolate crumb to Hershey, which then added cocoa butter during processing. According to its spokesman, Cadbury tries to adapt the taste of the product to that which local consumers are accustomed, meaning it is more akin to a Hershey bar for the US market.

==Advertising==

===Pre–2007 advertising===
Cadbury&#x27;s Fruit &amp; Nut was advertised in a popular 1970s television advertisement that featured humourist Frank Muir singing &quot;Everyone&#x27;s a fruit and nutcase&quot; to the tune of &quot;Danse des mirlitons&quot; from Tchaikovsky&#x27;s ballet &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;.

In Ireland, Cadbury Dairy Milk used the jingle &quot;The Perfect Word For Chocolate&quot; from 1986 to 1988. Between 1989 and 1996, the popular jingle &quot;The Choice Is Yours The Taste Is Cadbury&quot; with the slogan &quot;Mysteries of Love&quot; was a well-known advertisement. The song &quot;Show Me Heaven&quot; was used in a 1996 advert, with the jingle &quot;Tastes Like Heaven&quot;.
Cadbury has always tried to keep a strong association with milk, with slogans such as &quot;a glass and a half of full cream milk in every half pound&quot; and advertisements that feature a glass of milk pouring out and forming the bar.

In 2004, Cadbury started a series of television advertisements in the United Kingdom and Ireland featuring a human and an animal (representing the human&#x27;s happiness) debating whether to eat one of a range of included bars.

===Glass and a Half Full Productions (2007–2011)===

In 2007, Cadbury launched a new advertising campaign entitled &quot;Gorilla&quot;, from a new in-house production company called &quot;Glass And A Half Full Productions&quot;. The advert was premièred during the season finale of &quot;Big Brother 2007&quot;, and consists of a gorilla at a drum kit, drumming along to the Phil Collins song &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;. The advert has over twenty million views on YouTube, and put the Phil Collins song back into the UK charts.

On 28 March 2008, the second Dairy Milk advert produced by Glass and a Half Full Productions aired. The ad, entitled &#x27;Trucks&#x27; features several trucks at night on an empty runway at an airport racing to the tune of Queen&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Me Now&quot;. The ad campaign ran at the same time as the problems at Heathrow Terminal 5 with baggage handling; in the advert baggage was scattered across the runway.

On 5 September 2008, the Gorilla advert was relaunched with a new soundtrack – Bonnie Tyler&#x27;s &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; – a reference to online mash-ups of the commercial. Similarly, a version of the truck advert appeared, using Bon Jovi&#x27;s song &quot;Livin&#x27; on a Prayer&quot;. Both remakes premiered once again during the finale of &quot;Big Brother 2008&quot;.

In January 2009, &#x27;Eyebrows&#x27;, the third advert in the series, was released, of two children moving their eyebrows up and down rapidly to the song &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Rock&quot; by Freestyle. The ad starred Bradley Ford and Leah McArdle.

In April 2010, a fourth advert aired, entitled &#x27;Chocolate Charmer&#x27;, containing a scientist mixing milk and chocolate to make a dairy milk bar to the tune of &quot;The Only One I Know&quot; by The Charlatans.

In April 2011, a fifth advert aired, known as &#x27;Charity Shop&#x27; or &#x27;Dancing Clothes&#x27;, featuring dancing clothes at a charity shop to the tune of &quot;We Don&#x27;t Have to Take Our Clothes Off&quot; by Jermaine Stewart.

===Glass and a Half Full Records===

A new &#x27;record label&#x27; was launched as part of the Glass and a Half Full Productions campaign. The first song released was &quot;Zingolo&quot; featuring Tinny, to promote Fairtrade Dairy Milk. A full music video was made incorporating the 60-second ads, as well as a Facebook page.

===Joyville (2012–2014)===
The 2012–2014 Joyville campaign focused on an &#x27;organisation made to bring joy to people&#x27;. Chocolate fountains were put in shopping centres such as Westfield London and the first ad focused on the relaunch of Dairy Milk Bubbly. During the campaign in 2012, Cadbury Dairy Milk was launched in new flavours such as Toffee Popcorn, Golden Biscuit Crunch (an exclusive to Sainsbury&#x27;s), Nutty Caramel and also Cadbury Dairy Milk with Oreo. Along with the new flavours, Cadbury also launched two new Bubbly bars including a mini version and a Mint Bubbly. Cadbury has also launched Crispello and, most recently, launched &quot;Marvellous Creations&quot; in the UK.

In addition, Cadbury also brought the Joyville concept into Asia, where Singapore bloggers were invited to join in the campaign in 2013.

===Free The Joy (2014)===
In 2014, Joyville was replaced with the &quot;Free The Joy&quot; campaign. The song in a television advert is &quot;Yes Sir, I Can Boogie&quot; by Baccara. A new design was launched for Dairy Milk (and its variants) inviting consumers to scan an on-pack QR code and visit a website featuring &quot;Free The Joy&quot; moments.

=== Marketing in India ===

Initially, the company had appointed Amitabh Bachchan as the brand ambassador in 2004. However, the brand soon faced a significant backlash, with worms being spotted in a few of the chocolate bars. With its new campaigns, the company recovered again, with increased sales. One campaign that promoted the product by using the country&#x27;s love for cricket was successful. The advert was noted to be the best advertisement made in India by &quot;The Times of India&quot;.

Another famous campaign hosted by the company in the past was the &#x27;Shubh Aarambh&#x27; Campaign. This campaign made use of the traditional practice of Indian households of having something sweet before every auspicious occasion. This campaign was successful and positioned Cadbury Dairy Milk chocolates as part of a family name. Cadbury today holds 70% of the market share of the chocolate industry in the country.

===Common Themes===

Different advertisements of the Cadbury Dairy Milk share common ideas and emotions. The Ads focus heavily on themes of generosity, love, family, and sweetness. A campaign started in January 2025 called &quot;Made To Share&quot; gave a creative touch to sharing a Cadbury Daily Milk Chocolate bar. The packing of the chocolate bar is divided into uneven pieces and the label on each piece decides who get the piece based upon their contributions. 

==Grey imports in U.S.==
In 2015, Hershey&#x27;s blocked imports of overseas-made Cadbury chocolate and other confectionery to the US that infringed on its trademark licensing in a settlement with a grey importer. British Dairy Milk has been blind taste-tested as providing a creamier taste and texture, with the Hershey&#x27;s-made chocolate reportedly leaving a less pleasing coating on the tongue and a somewhat stale aftertaste.

==Recalls==
Cadbury was fined in July 2007 due to its products having been found to have been at risk of infection with salmonella (at a factory in Marlbrook, Herefordshire, England). It spent a further £30 million decontaminating the factory.

On 14 September 2007, Cadbury Schweppes investigated a manufacturing error over allergy warnings, recalling for the second time in two years thousands of chocolate bars. A printing mistake at the Keynsham factory resulted in the omission of nut allergy labels from 250g Dairy Milk Double Chocolate bars.

The 2008 Chinese milk scandal affected Cadbury, when much of the Cadbury Dairy Milk manufactured in mainland China was tainted with melamine. Although it can be safely used in plastic manufacturing, melamine is toxic, particularly to infants.

In 2003, Worms were found in some of the chocolate bars in India.
