<text>Rates are a type of property tax system in the United Kingdom, and in places with systems deriving from the British one, the proceeds of which are used to fund local government. Some other countries have taxes with a more or less comparable role, like France&#x27;s .

==Rates by country==
===Australia===
Local government authorities levy annual taxes, which are called council rates or shire rates. The basis on which these charges can be calculated varies from state to state, but is usually based in some way on the value of property. Even within states, individual local government authorities can often choose the specific basis of rates – for example, it may be on the rental value of houses (as in Western Australia) or on the unimproved land value (as in New South Wales). These rateable valuations are usually determined by a statutory authority, and are subject to periodic revision.

===Canada===

Rates are referred to as property taxes in Canada. These taxes are collected primarily by municipal governments on residential, industrial and commercial properties and are their main source of funding.

===Hong Kong===

Levied on domestic property as well as non-domestic premises. Prior to 2000, it was used to fund municipal services, the responsibility of the now-abolished Urban Council and Regional Council, through the Urban Services Department and Regional Services Department. The revenue now goes to the Treasury. The bill is issued quarterly.

===Ireland===
Business rates and domestic rates existed in Ireland as part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and were retained after independence. Business or commercial rates are still collected. Fianna Fáil promised to abolish domestic rates in its 1977 general election manifesto, won a landslide, and implemented this with effect from 1979. Local authorities lost 33% of their budget and made cutbacks. From the mid 1980s until 1997, most levied &quot;water charges&quot; to make up part of the shortfall. In 2013 a Local Property Tax (LPT) was introduced, which has been compared to the reintroduction of domestic rates; one difference is that LPT is collected centrally by the Revenue Commissioners before being disbursed to the local authorities.

===Israel===
Israel has a similar tax known as &quot;arnona&quot; that goes back to the days of the British Mandate of Palestine. It is levied by the municipality (or, in smaller localities, by the Regional Council) based (currently) on the square meterage of dwelling or business. Specific rates vary widely among municipalities, with Jerusalem and Rehovot having the highest rates in the country. In rental dwellings, tenants (rather than owners) generally pay the arnona. Single parents and some forms of economic hardship qualify for discounts or even exemptions.

=== Pakistan ===
In Pakistan, taxes are applicable since it&#x27;s independence at August 14, 1947. Previously taken from the British Empire. However, Taxation in Pakistan was properly introduced by Income Tax Ordinance 1979, on June 28 by Central Board of Revenue. Tax rates in Pakistan varries depends upon the types of income, source of income and status of taxpayers. Generally inactive taxpayers are taxed double, while in property transactions the later or taxed four times more. In some cases like Tax on cash withdrawal active taxpayers are not taxed. Similary for Income tax in Pakistan there is a slab system for Individiduals and AOPs while corporate sector is taxed at fixed 29% for above 250m turnover annually. Small companies are however taxed at 20%. Individuals and AOPs are exempt from taxes if their annual income is less than PKR 600,000 per year. Tax rates increases for high earners. In Pakistan the tax slab starts from 5% for income above PKR 600,000 per year while stops at 45% for income above 5.6 million per year. Please note Government of Pakistan tax rates reaches for upto 50% for high-yield profits known as Windfall tax.

===New Zealand===

In New Zealand, rates have provided the major source of revenue for territorial authorities since the late-19th century. Rates are basically a tax on real property. , rates made up 56% of local-authority operating-revenue.

Almost all property owners in New Zealand pay rates; those who do so are referred to as &quot;ratepayers&quot;. People who rent property do not pay rates directly, but property owners will take account of the cost of rates when they set the rent. As a result, those who rent properties also have an interest in the level of rates, as well as in the services provided by councils using these rates.

Some types of property are exempt from rate levies - government land and rail land, for example. Other categories of property may possibly only be rated at 50% (land used for some types of sports purposes). Māori land - particularly where ownership and therefore liability for rates are hard to establish - can also get special treatment. Exceptions are listed in Schedule 1 Part 1 of the Local Government (Rating) Act 2002.

Territorial authorities may assess property values in three different ways – on the basis of land, annual or capital value – using valuations prepared in accordance with the Rating Valuations Act 1998. The valuation process is overseen by the Valuer-General. Each local authority, after consulting with their community, can decide which basis to use.

Councils can use a mix of these different methodologies when assessing rates based on the value of holdings, for example land value for its general rate and capital value for a targeted rate.

Councils can also levy flat charges per rating unit (i.e. each lot of land, with some exceptions where multiple adjacent lots may be considered one rating unit if in common ownership, or where multiple dwelling-units are on a single lot) - generally called a uniform annual general charge. Other methodologies also exist, such as a charge per toilet bowl or urinal, or a water charge per cubic metre of water supplied.

The Local Government (Rating) Act 2002
is the governing legislation and provides a number of options for setting rates, such that local authorities can use combinations of general rates, targeted rates and/or uniform annual general charges.

===United Kingdom===

Rates in the United Kingdom are a tax on property used to provide some of the funding of local government.

Domestic rates, split into regional and district rates, are currently collected in Northern Ireland. They were collected in England and Wales before 1990 and in Scotland before 1989. Outside Northern Ireland Council Tax is collected instead of domestic rates.

Business rates are collected throughout the United Kingdom, with different systems in England, in Wales, in Northern Ireland and in Scotland.

===United States===

In the US, real estate taxes which are based on a percentage of the property&#x27;s actual or nominal value are referred to as &quot;property taxes&quot;. The term &quot;rates&quot; is not used in this context. Property taxes are the prime funding method for local government (i.e., counties, cities, townships, etc.), and are normally paid by the property owner, regardless of whether the property owner lives on the property.

<doc id="856252" wikidata="Q217713" url="?curid=856252" title="Chargé d'affaires">
<text>A chargé d&#x27;affaires (), plural chargés d&#x27;affaires, often shortened to chargé (French) and sometimes in colloquial English to charge-D, is a diplomat who serves as an embassy&#x27;s chief of mission in the absence of the ambassador. The term is French for &quot;person charged with business&quot;, meaning they are responsible for the duties of an ambassador. &quot;Chargé&quot; is masculine in gender; the feminine form is chargée d&#x27;affaires (pronounced the same way).

A &quot;chargé&quot; enjoys the same privileges and immunities as an ambassador under international law, and normally these extend to their aides as well. However, &quot;chargés d&#x27;affaires&quot; are outranked by ambassadors and have lower precedence at formal diplomatic events. In most cases, a diplomat serves as a &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; on a temporary basis in the absence of the ambassador. In unusual situations, in cases where disputes between the two countries make it impossible or undesirable to send agents of a higher diplomatic rank, a &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; may be appointed for an indefinite period.

== Types of &quot;chargés&quot;==
&quot;Chargés d&#x27;affaires&quot; &quot;ad interim&quot; (&quot;a.i.&quot;) are those who temporarily head a diplomatic mission in the absence of the accredited head of that mission. It is usual to appoint a minister-counsellor, counsellor, or embassy secretary as &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; &quot;ad interim&quot;, and that person is presented to the foreign minister of the receiving state. By definition, &quot;chargés d&#x27;affaires&quot; &quot;ad interim&quot; do not possess diplomatic credentials.

&quot;Chargés d&#x27;affaires&quot; &quot;en pied&quot; (&quot;e.p.&quot;) are appointed to be permanent heads of mission, in cases where the two countries lack ambassadorial-level relations. They are appointed by letters of credence from the foreign minister of the sending state to the foreign minister of the receiving state. &quot;Chargés d&#x27;affaires&quot; &quot;en pied&quot; have precedence over &quot;chargés d&#x27;affaires&quot; &quot;ad interim&quot;, but are outranked by ambassadors. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;chargés d&#x27;affaires&quot; &quot;ad hoc&quot; or &quot;en titre&quot;.

==Long-term &quot;chargé&quot;-level relations==
In certain cases, a &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; may be appointed for long periods, such as when a mission is headed by a non-resident ambassador who is accredited to multiple countries. In addition, a mission may be downgraded from an ambassadorial to a &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; level to show displeasure, yet avoid taking the extremely serious step of breaking diplomatic relations. For example, Saudi Arabia and Thailand did not exchange ambassadors between 1989 and 2022, due to the Blue Diamond Affair. The Holy See recalled the ambassador to Taipei right after United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758 ceased to recognize the Republic of China as the sole legitimate representative of China, and thus &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; becomes the most top-ranked de facto envoy to Taipei since then (the ambassador did not leave his position until 1979).

Sometimes when diplomatic recognition is extended to a new government, a &quot;chargé&quot; may be sent to immediately establish diplomatic representation. However, if a timely exchange of ambassadors does not take place, this may result in a prolonged period of &quot;chargé&quot;-level relations. For example, the United Kingdom recognized the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1950 and posted a &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; in the new capital of Beijing. However, China was unwilling to exchange ambassadors until the United Kingdom withdrew its consulate from Taipei. Sino-British relations were not upgraded to the ambassadorial level until 1972.

Since a &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; presents his or her credentials to the foreign minister rather than the head of state, the appointment of a &quot;chargé&quot; may avoid a politically sensitive meeting that would imply approval or recognition of that head of state or government. Similarly, the receiving country may decline to receive an ambassador, but still maintain diplomatic relations by accepting a &quot;chargé&quot;. For example, the Republic of Cyprus appoints a number of &quot;chargés d&#x27;affaires&quot; &quot;en pied&quot; to its embassies abroad.

==History==
In modern use, &quot;chargés d&#x27;affaires&quot; essentially differ from ambassadors in that, like all diplomats, &quot;chargés&quot; represent their nation, but unlike an ambassador, they are not personal representatives of their head of state. Apart from rank and precedence, &quot;chargés&quot; enjoy the same privileges and immunities as other diplomatic agents.

However, there have been rare historical circumstances in which the title &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; was in fact employed in a more significant colonial role, as commonly held by a resident. Thus, in Annam-Tonkin (most of present Vietnam), the first French &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; at Huế, the local ruler&#x27;s capital, since 1875, one of them (three terms) was appointed the first resident-general on 11 June 1884, as they stopped being tributary to the Chinese Empire, less than a year after the 25 August 1883 French protectorates over Annam and Tonkin (central and northern regions).

In French, &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; may be used outside diplomacy to designate an individual with some more or less temporary responsibility for a specific area of business, understood broadly.

==Spelling and grammar==
&quot;Chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; generally follows French usage: &quot;chargé d&#x27;affaires&quot; is singular, &quot;chargés d&#x27;affaires&quot; for plural. The &quot;d&#x27;affaires&quot; is always in the plural form, and should be lowercase even if &quot;Chargé&quot; is capitalized. Following the French declension, &quot;chargée d&#x27;affaires&quot; (with the feminine ending) may be seen where the &quot;chargé&quot; is female.

For temporary &quot;chargés&quot;, &quot;ad interim&quot; may or may not be added depending on the context, but is always lower case; it may be italicized or shortened to simply a.i.

<text>Lake Sebu, officially the Municipality of Lake Sebu (Tboli: &quot;Benwu Sbù&quot;, ; Hiligaynon: &quot;Banwa sang Sëbu&quot; ; Tagalog: &quot;Bayan ng Sëbu&quot;), is a municipality in the province of South Cotabato, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 81,221 people.

Lake Sebu is a serene municipality nestled in a &quot;bowl of forests and mountains&quot; within the Allah Valley Protected Landscape in South Cotabato, Philippines. Spanning an area of 89,138 hectares, it serves as both an ecological sanctuary and a cultural treasure. The area is recognized by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) as a vital cultural landscape, embodying the rich heritage of the T&#x27;boli, Ubo, and other indigenous groups. Known for its three scenic lakes—Lake Sebu, Lake Seloton, and Lake Lahit—the municipality is a major ecotourism destination. It features lush forests, diverse flora and fauna, and breathtaking waterfalls, including the famed Seven Falls. Beyond its natural beauty, Lake Sebu is a center of indigenous artistry, from T&#x27;nalak weaving to vibrant cultural traditions, making it a unique convergence of biodiversity and heritage in Mindanao.

== Geography ==

The placid lake of Lake Sebu can be found in Allah Valley near the municipality of Surallah, South Cotabato. Surrounded by rolling hills and mountains covered with thick rain forest, the lake has an area of , with an elevation of approximately .
===Barangays===
Lake Sebu is politically subdivided into 19 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks while some have sitios.

==Demographics==
The lake&#x27;s shores and the surrounding rainforest are home to the Indigenous Tbolis, Tirurays, Ubos, and Manobos. One of the major tribes, the Tbolis are known for their weaving skills and brassware production as well as fishing skills. The rest of the population are made of Maguindanaons, Ilonggos, Cebuanos, Bicolanos, and Ilocanos.
==Economy==

The economy is based on aquaculture of Tilapia grown in large fish cages floating in the lake. More than one half of the land around the lake is cultivated for agriculture. The Philippine government is also trying to promote ecotourism in the area. The finishing of a concrete road cut the travel time from 4 hours to less than 30 minutes greatly improving trade and commerce.
== Wildlife ==
Wild boars and Philippine Deer which are considered endangered live around the lake. The lake and the surrounding rainforest are natural habitat to egrets, kingfishers, swallows, herons, Philippine cockatoos and kites.

== Environmental conservation ==
The Philippine government proclaimed a area as a protected landscape. On the south-eastern watershed of the lake, a bamboo plantation was established.

<text>The German sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920) distinguished three ideal types of legitimate political leadership/domination/authority ().
He wrote about these three types of domination both in his essay &quot;The Three Types of Legitimate Rule&quot;, which was published in his 1921 masterwork &quot;Economy and Society&quot; (see Weber 1922/1978:215-216), and in his classic 1919 speech &quot;Politics as a Vocation&quot; (see Weber 1919/2015:137-138):

# [[charismatic authority]] (&quot;character&quot;, &quot;heroism&quot;, &quot;leadership&quot;, &quot;religious&quot;),
# [[traditional authority]] (&quot;patriarchs, patrimonialism, feudalism&quot;) and
# [[rational-legal authority]] (&quot;modern law and state, bureaucracy&quot;).

These three types are ideal types and rarely appear in their pure form.

According to Weber, authority (as distinct from power ()) is power accepted as legitimate by those subjected to it. The three forms of authority are said to appear in a &quot;hierarchical development order&quot;. States progress from &quot;charismatic authority&quot;, to &quot;traditional authority&quot;, and finally reach the &quot;state of rational-legal authority&quot; which is characteristic of a modern liberal democracy.

==Charismatic authority==

Charismatic authority grows out of the personal charm or the strength of an individual personality. It was described by Weber in a lecture as &quot;the authority of the extraordinary and personal gift of grace (charisma)&quot;; he distinguished it from the other forms of authority by stating &quot;Men do not obey him [the charismatic ruler] by virtue of tradition or statute, but because they believe in him.&quot; Thus the actual power or capabilities of the leader are irrelevant, as long as the followers &quot;believe&quot; that such power exists. Thus, according to Weber, it is particularly difficult for charismatic leaders to maintain their authority because the followers must continue to legitimize the authority of the leader. Officials consist of those who have shown personal devotion to the ruler, and of those who possess their own charisma.

Charismatic authority is different from legal-rational and traditional power insofar as it does not develop from established tradition but rather from the belief the followers have in the leader.

According to Weber, once the leader loses his charisma or dies, systems based on charismatic authority tend to transform into traditional or legal-rational systems.

==Traditional authority==

In systems based around traditional authority, legitimacy comes from tradition or custom, even the nominal personal ruler(s) being subject to it; Weber described it as &quot;the authority of the eternal yesterday&quot; and identified it as the source of authority for monarchies. In this type of domination, the traditional rights of a powerful individual or group are accepted by the subordinate, or at least not challenged. The dominant individual could be a clan leader, eldest, the head of a family, a patriarchal figure or dominant elite. Officials consist either of personal retainers (in a patrimonial regime) or of personal loyal allies, such as vassals or tributary lords (in a feudal regime). Their prerogatives are usually similar to those of the ruler above them, just reduced in scale, and they too are often selected based on inheritance. Historically this has been the most common type of government.

According to Weber, inequalities are created and preserved by traditional authority. Should this authority not be challenged, the dominant leader or group will stay in power. For Weber, traditional power blocked the development of rational-legal authority.

==Rational-legal authority==

Legal authority, also known as rational-legal authority, is based on a system of rules that is applied administratively and judicially in accordance with known principles. The persons who administer those rules are appointed or elected by legal procedures. Superiors are also subject to rules that limit their powers, separate their private lives from official duties and require written documentation. It is the authority that demands obedience to the office rather than the officeholder; once a leader leaves office, their rational-legal authority is lost. Weber identified &quot;rationally-created rules&quot; as the central feature of this form of authority. Modern democracies contain many examples of legal-rational regimes. There are different ways in which legal authority can develop. Many societies have developed a system of laws and regulations and there exist many different principles of legality. With the development of a legal-rational system, the political system is likely to be rationalized similarly. Constitutions, written documents, established offices and regular elections are often associated with modern legal-rational political systems. These in the past have tended to develop in opposition to earlier traditional systems such as monarchies, where the set of rules are not well developed. As these systems develop in a rational manner, authority takes on a legal-rational form. Those who govern have the legitimate legal right to do so and those subordinated accept the legality of the rulers.

Albeit rational-legal authority may be challenged by those subordinated, it is unlikely to result in a quick change in the nature of the system. Such power struggles, according to Weber, are mostly political struggles and may be based on nationalism or ethnicity.

==The classification of authority in the context of history==
Weber also notes that legal domination is the most advanced, and that societies evolve from having mostly traditional and charismatic authorities to mostly rational and legal ones, because the instability of charismatic authority inevitably forces it to &quot;routinize&quot; into a more structured form of authority. Likewise he notes that in a pure type of traditional rule, sufficient resistance to a master can lead to a &quot;traditional revolution&quot;. Thus he alludes to an inevitable move towards a rational-legal structure of authority, utilizing a bureaucratic structure. This ties to his broader concept of rationalization by suggesting the inevitability of a move in this direction. Thus this theory can be sometimes viewed as part of the social evolutionism theory.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition, in charismatic authority from the personality and leadership qualities of the individual (charisma), and in legal (or rational-legal) authority from powers that are bureaucratically and legally attached to certain positions. A classic example of these three types may be found in religion: priests (traditional), Jesus (charismatic), and the Catholic Church (legal-rational). Weber also conceived of these three types within his three primary modes of conflict: traditional authority within status groups, charismatic authority within class, and legal-rational authority within party organizations.

In his view every historical relation between rulers and ruled contained elements that can be analyzed on the basis of the above distinction.

<text>The Dover Demon is a creature reportedly sighted on April 21–22, 1977, in Dover, Massachusetts, a town about southwest of downtown Boston. 

==Sightings==
17-year-old William &quot;Bill&quot; Bartlett claimed that while driving on April 21, 1977, he saw a creature &quot;about 4 feet tall with glowing orange eyes and no nose or mouth in a watermelon-shaped head&quot; on top of a broken stone wall on Farm Street in Dover, Massachusetts. 15-year-old John Baxter reported seeing a similar creature on Miller Hill Road the same evening. Another 15-year-old, Abby Brabham, claimed to have seen the creature the following night on Springdale Avenue.

The teenagers all drew sketches of the alleged creature. Bartlett wrote on his sketch, &quot;I, Bill Bartlett, swear on a stack of Bibles that I saw this creature.&quot; According to a local news report, &quot;the locations of the sightings, plotted on a map, lay in a straight line over &quot;. The sightings were not made public until the first half of May. At that time, a local &quot;investigator of unexplained phenomenon&quot; noted similarities to creatures in the Kelly–Hopkinsville encounter of 1955. Even though none of the witnesses reported seeing a UFO, the sightings were also investigated by the Mutual UFO Network and associated groups.

==Possible explanations==

It has been suggested that the creature may have been a foal or a moose calf.

Skeptic Joe Nickell believes the creature was likely a snowy owl, based on size and plumage, which would have reflected in the yellow headlights of older cars as the peach color described by Bartlett. In addition, the &quot;long spindly arms&quot; and fingers of the supposed creature could be the partially opened wings and the splayed feathers at the wingtips of a snowy owl.

Police told the Associated Press that creatures reported by the teenagers &quot;were probably nothing more than a school vacation hoax.&quot; Skeptic Ben Radford has suggested the sighting may have been influenced by the pop culture of the time, as 1977 was the year &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot; were released.

==In popular culture==
In 2009, the Dover Demon was featured in an episode of the American horror television series &quot;Lost Tapes&quot;, which aired on Animal Planet.

The Dover Demon appears as a character in the American comic book series &quot;Proof&quot;, which features various other creatures. In the comic, it is a creature able to see into the future. It appears in another similar comic book series called &quot;The Perhapanauts&quot;. The Dover Demon also made brief appearances in the comic books &quot;The Pound: Ghouls Night Out&quot; and &quot;Hack/Slash: Entry Wound&quot;. A Dover Demon also appears in the webcomic &quot;Gunnerkrigg Court&quot;.

Additionally, in the manga series &quot;Dandadan&quot;, there is an alien known as Dover Demon that takes the form of a bipedal crustacean-like alien; with the ability to transform into a stronger form resembling that of a mantis shrimp.

<text>He Jin () (died 22 September 189), courtesy name Suigao, was a Chinese military general and politician. He was the military Grand Marshal and regent of the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He was an elder half-brother of Empress He (the empress consort of Emperor Ling), and a maternal uncle of Emperor Shao. In 189, he and his sister shared power as regents when the young Emperor Shao was put on the throne following Emperor Ling&#x27;s death. During the time, the conflict between He Jin and the influential eunuch faction intensified. After they overheard a conversation between He Jin and the empress dowager, the eunuch faction lured him into a trap in the imperial palace and assassinated him. While He Jin&#x27;s subordinates, led by the warlord Yuan Shao, slaughtered the eunuch faction in revenge, the warlord Dong Zhuo took advantage of the power vacuum to enter the imperial capital Luoyang and seize control of the Han central government. Dong Zhuo&#x27;s seizure of control and the subsequent breakdown of central command that followed brought forth the beginning of massive civil wars that lasted for nearly a century, during which time the Han dynasty came to an end and the Three Kingdoms period began in its place.

==Life==
He Jin was born into a family of butchers in Nanyang, hometown of the dynastic founder Emperor Guangwu. During the reign of Emperor Ling, his younger half-sister entered the palace and soon became one of the emperor&#x27;s favourites. In January 181, she was made empress and He Jin henceforth began a speedy escalation up the bureaucratic ladder.

When the Yellow Turban Rebellion erupted in 184, He Jin was appointed General-in-Chief (). He commanded the imperial armory, secured strategic forts around the capital and moved quickly to crush the uprising at Luoyang led by Ma Yuanyi (), a follower of the rebel leader, Zhang Jue. The campaign was deemed a success and He Jin was enfeoffed as the Marquis of Shen (). After the rebellion was quelled, He Jin continued in the role of General-in-Chief, technically in control of all the imperial armies. During this time, other members of his family, such as his younger step-brother He Miao (), were also elevated to positions of importance.

In 188, perhaps as a counterweight to the power of the He family, Emperor Ling created the Army of the Western Garden. The emperor ostentatiously paraded in front of the army and had himself named &quot;Supreme General&quot; (). The emperor also had the army placed under the command of Jian Shuo, a trusted eunuch. By commanding the Army of the Western Garden, the emperor could put He Jin under his own command. The military prowess of this new army was never showcased, however, as it was disbanded less than a year later.

When Emperor Ling died in May 189, the stage was set for a showdown between He Jin and the eunuch faction. Jian Shuo plotted to lure He Jin into a trap at the imperial palace where he would be assassinated. However, when He Jin arrived, a minor official Pan Yin () subtly warned He Jin about Jian Shuo&#x27;s plot. Astonished, He Jin returned to his camp and evaded the assassination attempt. Afterward, He Jin had Jian Shuo arrested and executed, and then he seized command of the troops previously under Jian Shuo&#x27;s command.

With the support of the elite Yuan family, particularly Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu, the succession dispute was resolved in favour of Liu Bian, the son of Empress He, who ascended the throne in the fifth month of that year. He Jin and his sister, now the Empress Dowager, jointly took on the role of regent.

During the summer months, He Jin and his subordinates engaged the eunuch faction in court politics. The eunuchs, now without a military power base of their own, relied on the support of Empress Dowager He and He Miao. At the urging of Yuan Shao, He Jin summoned the general Dong Zhuo ()to the outskirts of Luoyang, in an attempt to force the Empress Dowager to back down. In the ninth month of that year, He Jin entered the palace to request the Empress Dowager agree to the execution of the eunuchs. Unbeknownst to He Jin, Zhang Rang, the leader of the eunuch faction, had planted a spy to overhear the conversation between him and the Empress Dowager. Once they received word of what He Jin was plotting, the eunuchs lured him to the Imperial Palace under the pretense of a fake summons from the Empress Dowager. He Jin made the mistake of arriving at the palace without his escort, and as a result, he was brutally murdered by the eunuchs.

After hearing of He Jin&#x27;s death, Yuan Shao and Yuan Shu, both with significant control of military forces within the capital, stormed the palace and massacred the eunuchs. The resulting power vacuum allowed Dong Zhuo to seize control of the imperial court. As soon as he held supremacy over the capital, Dong Zhuo deposed the emperor in favour of the Prince of Chenliu, who came to be known as Emperor Xian. The deposition as well as Dong Zhuo&#x27;s subsequent atrocities incurred the wrath of many. In 190, warlords from the eastern provinces formed a coalition to oust Dong Zhuo, which kicked off a series of civil wars that were to last for nearly a century.

==Family==
He Jin had at least two half-siblings and a step-brother:
* Empress He, the empress consort of Emperor Ling and mother of Emperor Shao
* Lady He, full sister of Empress He, who married the adopted son of the eunuch Zhang Rang
* Step-brother: He Miao (), courtesy name Shuda (), born &quot;Zhu Miao&quot; (), an elder half-brother of Empress He born of the same mother. Thus, He Miao is actually not blood-related to He Jin. He served as General of Chariots and Cavalry (), and was killed by He Jin&#x27;s subordinate Wu Kuang (; father of Wu Ban) and Dong Zhuo&#x27;s brother Dong Min in late September 189 (after He Jin&#x27;s death) for sympathizing with the eunuch faction who assassinated He Jin.

According to historical sources, it is widely believed that He Jin had at least one son, He Xian (), who survived the downfall of the He family in 189, and who had a son, He Yan ( 196–249). As He Xian died early, his wife Lady Yin () remarried and became a concubine of the warlord Cao Cao, who adopted He Yan. However, He Yan was buried at Lujiang when one&#x27;s place of burial was customarily the ancestral home, which contradicts the fact that He Jin was from Nanyang; so He Yan was probably a grandson of He Miao, as Weilue suggests, while it was recorded that there had actually been several families of the Zhu clan, which might be the clan that He Miao was from, at Lujiang during Eastern Han.

<doc id="856297" wikidata="Q435257" url="?curid=856297" title="Empress He (Han dynasty)">
<text>Empress He (died 30 September 189), personal name unknown, posthumously known as Empress Lingsi, was an empress of the Eastern Han dynasty. She was the second empress consort of Emperor Ling and the mother of Emperor Shao. After the death of Emperor Ling in 189, she became empress dowager when her young son, Liu Bian (Emperor Shao), became the new emperor. She was caught up in the conflict between her paternal half-brother, General-in-Chief He Jin, and the eunuch faction, who were both vying for power in the Han imperial court. After He Jin&#x27;s assassination and the elimination of the eunuch faction, the warlord Dong Zhuo took advantage of the power vacuum to lead his forces into the imperial capital and seize control of the Han central government. Dong Zhuo subsequently deposed Emperor Shao, replaced him with Liu Xie (Emperor Xian) and had Empress Dowager He poisoned to death.

==Family background and early years==
Lady He was from Wan County (), Nanyang Commandery (), which is in present-day Nanyang, Henan. Unlike most Han dynasty empresses, she was not of noble birth; her father, He Zhen (), was a butcher. Her mother&#x27;s maiden family name is unknown, but her given name was &quot;Xing&quot; (). She had two half-brothers, He Jin (same father) and He Miao (; same mother), and a younger sister who married the (adopted) son of the eunuch Zhang Rang.

According to legends, she joined Emperor Ling&#x27;s imperial harem after her family bribed the eunuchs tasked with selecting women to serve the emperor. She was seven &quot;chi&quot; and one &quot;cun&quot; tall. In 176, she bore Emperor Ling a son, Liu Bian, who turned out to be the emperor&#x27;s oldest surviving son because his other sons born before Liu Bian died in infancy or childhood. As Emperor Ling believed that he lost his previous sons due to bad luck, he ordered Shi Zimiao (), a Taoist, to raise his newborn son; Liu Bian was given the title &quot;Marquis Shi&quot; (). Lady He became highly favoured by Emperor Ling, who awarded her the rank of &quot;Honoured Lady&quot; (). Honoured Lady He was known for being jealous and cruel. The other women in Emperor Ling&#x27;s harem were afraid of her.

==As empress consort==
On 8 January 181, Emperor Ling instated Honoured Lady He as Empress to replace Empress Song, whom he deposed in 178. The following year, the emperor bestowed titles on Empress He&#x27;s parents to honour them: her deceased father, He Zhen, received the posthumous appointment &quot;General of Chariots of Cavalry&quot; () and the title &quot;Marquis Xuande of Wuyang&quot; (); her mother was given the title &quot;Lady of Wuyang&quot; ().

Around the time, one of Emperor Ling&#x27;s consorts, Beautiful Lady Wang (), became pregnant. As she feared that Empress He would harm her unborn child, she attempted to cause a miscarriage by consuming drugs, but her child remained safe, and she had dreams about the sun. In 181, after Beautiful Lady Wang gave birth to a son, Liu Xie, Empress He ordered her to be poisoned to death. Emperor Ling was furious when he found out and he wanted to depose Empress He, but the eunuchs managed to persuade him to spare the empress. The motherless Liu Xie was raised by his grandmother, Empress Dowager Dong, and given the title &quot;Marquis Dong&quot; ().

When his subjects asked him to name one of his sons as crown prince, Emperor Ling had a dilemma between Liu Bian and Liu Xie, his only two surviving sons. He felt that Liu Bian was unfit to be emperor because he was frivolous and unable to command respect, so he preferred Liu Xie. However, he was also worried that if he chose Liu Xie, Empress He would turn to her half-brother, He Jin, for help. He Jin held the position of General-in-Chief () and was a highly influential figure in the imperial court. He ultimately did not name either of his sons as crown prince.

==As empress dowager==
When Emperor Ling became critically ill in 189, he secretly entrusted his eight-year-old son Liu Xie to close aide and eunuch, Jian Shuo. Upon Emperor Ling&#x27;s death, Jian Shuo attempted to lure He Jin into a trap in the palace, assassinate him, and then install Liu Xie on the throne. However, Pan Yin (), a eunuch who was also an acquaintance of He Jin, warned the General-in-Chief of Jian Shuo&#x27;s plot. He Jin returned to his military camp and pretended to be sick, so he did not need to respond when summoned to enter the palace. Jian Shuo&#x27;s plan to make Liu Xie emperor failed, so a 13-year-old Liu Bian was enthroned and became historically known as Emperor Shao. Empress He, as the emperor&#x27;s mother, became empress dowager and attended imperial court sessions alongside her son. As Emperor Shao was still young, General-in-Chief He Jin and Grand Tutor Yuan Wei () served as his regents.

In the summer of 189, after Jian Shuo learnt that He Jin and his subordinates were plotting to eliminate him, he tried to persuade his fellow eunuchs to join him in his plan to assassinate He Jin. However, they were persuaded by Guo Sheng (), a eunuch close to Empress Dowager He, to reject Jian Shuo&#x27;s idea. He Jin subsequently had Jian Shuo arrested and executed, and then took control of the military units previously under Jian&#x27;s command. In the autumn of 189, Yuan Shao suggested to He Jin to eliminate the eunuch faction and consolidate power. Empress Dowager He immediately rejected the idea because it required her to interact with men on a regular basis, which she found offensive and immodest. Empress Dowager He&#x27;s mother (the Lady of Wuyang) and He Miao () had been bribed by the eunuchs to protect them, so they also strongly opposed He Jin&#x27;s plan, saying that they owed much to the eunuchs. (Empress Dowager He became Emperor Ling&#x27;s consort because the eunuchs helped her.)

He Jin then heeded an alternative suggestion from Yuan Shao: he secretly instructed a few provincial military officials or warlords (Dong Zhuo, Wang Kuang, Qiao Mao and Ding Yuan) to lead their troops to the vicinity of Luoyang, the imperial capital, and openly demand that the eunuchs be executed – in the hope of pressuring Empress Dowager He to take action against the eunuchs. Empress Dowager He initially refused to harm the eunuchs, but as Dong Zhuo&#x27;s forces approached Luoyang, she ordered the eunuchs to leave the palace and return to their marquisates. (Many of the eunuchs were made marquises by Emperor Ling.) Empress Dowager He&#x27;s younger sister married the adopted son of Zhang Rang, the eunuch leader. Zhang Rang pleaded with her to help him, so she informed her mother (the Lady of Wuyang), who in turn spoke to Empress Dowager He. The empress dowager relented and summoned the eunuchs back to the palace.

Around late August or September 189, the eunuchs hatched a plot to assassinate He Jin. They issued a fake imperial order in Empress Dowager He&#x27;s name, instructing He Jin to enter the palace to meet her. He Jin fell into an ambush and died at the hands of the eunuchs, who declared him guilty of treason. After He Jin&#x27;s death, his subordinates Wu Kuang () and Zhang Zhang (), along with Yuan Shao, Yuan Shu and others, led their troops to storm the palace and kill the eunuchs in revenge. They indiscriminately slaughtered anyone who looked like a eunuch; some young men who had no facial hair, in desperation, dropped their pants in front of the soldiers to prove that they were not eunuchs. During the attack, the eunuchs took Empress Dowager He, Emperor Shao and the Prince of Chenliu (Liu Xie) hostage and tried to flee from the palace. Lu Zhi intercepted the eunuch Duan Gui () and saved the empress dowager from him. He Miao, who was sympathetic towards the eunuchs, was killed by Wu Kuang and Dong Zhuo&#x27;s younger brother Dong Min (). Over 2,000 people died in the attack. Emperor Shao and the Prince of Chenliu, who were taken out of the palace by the eunuchs during the chaos, were eventually found near the riverbank and saved by Lu Zhi and Min Gong (), who brought them back safely.

==Death==
The warlord Dong Zhuo ultimately led his forces into Luoyang, the imperial capital, and took advantage of the power vacuum to seize control of the Han central government. In 28 September 189, he deposed Emperor Shao (who was demoted to &quot;Prince of Hongnong&quot;) and replaced him with Liu Xie (the Prince of Chenliu), who is historically known as Emperor Xian. A tearful Empress Dowager He watched as her son was forcefully pulled away from his throne, while the officials watched and did not dare to say anything for fear of antagonising Dong Zhuo. Dong Zhuo subsequently relocated Empress Dowager He to Yong&#x27;an Palace () after claiming her involvement in the death of her mother-in-law, and had her poisoned to death there on 30 September. He also killed the empress dowager&#x27;s mother, the Lady of Wuyang (). Dong Zhuo then forced Emperor Xian to attend the empress dowager&#x27;s funeral on 29 October 189 at Fengchang Village (), a district of Luoyang. The officials who attended the funeral were dressed in plain colours but not proper mourning attire; the entire ceremony did not befit her status as an empress dowager, as Dong claimed that she had already been deposed. She was buried in the Wenzhao Mausoleum () with Emperor Ling as an empress instead of empress dowager, and posthumously honoured as &quot;Empress Lingsi&quot; ().

<text>The Cloaca Maxima ( , ) or, less often, Maxima Cloaca, is one of the world&#x27;s earliest sewage systems. Its name is related to that of Cloacina, a Roman goddess. Built during either the Roman Kingdom or early Roman Republic, it was constructed in Ancient Rome in order to drain local marshes and remove waste from the city. It carried effluent to the River Tiber, which ran beside the city. The sewer started at the Forum Augustum and ended at the Ponte Rotto and Ponte Palatino. It began as an open air canal, but it developed into a much larger sewer over the course of time. Agrippa renovated and reconstructed much of the sewer. This would not be the only development in the sewers, by the first century AD all eleven Roman aqueducts were connected to the sewer. After the Roman Empire fell the sewer still was used. By the 19th century, it had become a tourist attraction. Some parts of the sewer are still used today. During its heyday, it was highly valued as a sacred symbol of Roman culture and Roman engineering.

==Construction and history==
According to tradition, it may have initially been constructed around 600 BC under the orders of the king of Rome, Tarquinius Priscus. He ordered Etruscan workers and the plebeians to construct the sewers. Before constructing the Cloaca Maxima, Priscus, and his son Tarquinius Superbus, worked to transform the land by the Roman forum from a swamp into a solid building ground, thus reclaiming the Velabrum. In order to achieve this, they filled it up with 10-20,000 cubic meters of soil, gravel, and debris.

At the beginning of the sewer&#x27;s life it consisted of open-air channels lined up with bricks centered around a main pipe. At this stage it might have had no roof. However, wooden holes spread throughout the sewer indicate that wooden bridges may have been built over it, which possibly functioned as a roof. Alternatively, the holes could have functioned as a support for the scaffolding needed to construct the sewer. The Cloaca Maxima may also have originally been an open drain, formed from streams originating from three of the neighboring hills, that were channeled through the main Forum and then on to the Tiber. As building space within the city became more valuable, the drain was gradually built over.

By the time of the late Roman Republic this sewer became the city&#x27;s main storm drain. It developed into a system 1,600 meters long. By the second century BC, it had a 101 meter long canal which was covered up and expanded into a sewer. Pliny the Elder, writing in the late 1st century, describes the early Cloaca Maxima as &quot;large enough to allow the passage of a wagon loaded with hay.&quot; Eventually, the sewer could not continue growing to keep up with the expanding city. Romans would discard waste through other openings rather than the sewers. From 31 BC to 192 AD manholes could be used to access the sewer, which could be traversed by canal at this point. Manholes were decorated with marble reliefs, and canals were made of Roman concrete and flint.

The eleven aqueducts which supplied water to Rome by the 1st century AD were finally channeled into the sewers after having supplied many of the public baths such as the Baths of Diocletian and the Baths of Trajan, as well as the public fountains, imperial palaces and private houses. The continuous supply of running water helped to remove wastes and keep the sewers clear of obstructions. The best waters were reserved for potable drinking supplies, and the second quality waters would be used by the baths, the outfalls of which connected to the sewer network under the streets of the city. The Cloaca Maxima was well maintained throughout the life of the Roman Empire and even today drains rainwater and debris from the center of town, below the ancient Forum, Velabrum, and the Forum Boarium. In more recent times, the remaining passages have been connected to the modern-day sewage system, mainly to cope with problems of backwash from the river.

After the fall of the Roman empire the Cloaca Maxima continued to be used. In the 1600s the Cardinal Chamberlain imposed a tax on residents of Rome in order to pay for the upkeep of the sewer. By the time of the 1800s the Cloaca Maxima became popular as a tourist attraction. From 1842 to 1852 sections of the sewer were drained. Pietro Narducci, an Italian engineer was hired by the city of Rome to survey and restore the parts of the sewer by the Forum and the Torre dei Conti in 1862. In 1890 Otto Ludwig Richter, a German archaeologist created a map of the sewers. These efforts renewed public interest in sanitation.

== Route ==
The Cloaca Maxima started at the Forum Augustum and followed the natural course of the suburbs of ancient Rome, which led between the Quirinal, Viminal, and Esquilline Hills. It also passed by the Forum of Nerva, the Arch of Janus, the Forum Boarium, the Basilica Aemilia, and the Forum Romanum, ending at the Velabrum. The sewer&#x27;s outfall was by the Ponte Rotto and Ponte Palatino. Some of this is still visible today. The branches of the main sewer all appear to be &#x27;official&#x27; drains that would have served public toilets, bathhouses and other public buildings. 

== Significance and effects ==

The Cloaca Maxima was large enough for &quot;wagons loaded with hay to pass&quot; according to Strabo. It could transport one million pounds of waste, water, and unwanted goods, which were dumped into the streets, swamps, and rivers near Rome. They were all carried out to the Tiber River by the sewer. It used gutters to collect rainwater, rubbish, and spillage, and conduits to dispense up to ten cubic meters of water per second. Vaults were closed with flat panels or rocks were used in the construction. This sewer used a trench wall to hold back sediments.

Some of its water was still polluted, contaminating water many depended on for irrigation, swimming, bathing, and drinking. The sewer reduced the number of mosquitos, thereby limiting the spread of malaria by draining marshy areas. Animals, including rats, could find their way into the sewer.

The Cloaca Maxima was a highly valued feat of engineering. It may have even been sacrosanct. Since the Romans viewed the movement of water to be sacred, the &quot;Cloaca Maxima&quot; may have had a religious significance. Aside from religious significance, the &quot;Cloaca Maxima&quot; may have been praised due to its age and its demonstration of engineering prowess. Livy describes the sewer as:Works for which the new splendor of these days has scarcely been able to produce a match.— Titus Livius, Titus Livius, The History of Rome, Book 1The writer Pliny the Elder describes the &quot;Cloaca Maxima&quot; as an engineering marvel due to its ability to withstand floods of filthy waters for centuries. Cassiodorus, a Roman senator and scholar, praised the sewage system in &quot;Variae&quot;. The Cloaca Maxima was a symbol of Roman civilization, and its superiority to others. Roman authors were not the only people to praise the Cloaca Maxima. British writer Henry James stated that it gave him: &quot;the deepest and grimmest impression of antiquity I have ever received.&quot;

The system of Roman sewers was much imitated throughout the Roman Empire, especially when combined with copious supplies of water from Roman aqueducts. The sewer system in Eboracum—the modern-day English city of York—was especially impressive and part of it still survives.

<text>Calcomp plotters (sometimes referred to as CalComp plotters) were the best known products of the California Computer Products company ([[Calcomp]] or CalComp).

==Overview==
The Calcomp 565 drum plotter, introduced in 1959, was one of the first computer graphics output devices sold. The computer could control in increments the rotation of an wide drum, and the horizontal movement of a pen holder over the drum. The pen was pressed by a spring against paper scrolling across the drum. A solenoid could lift the pen off the paper. This arrangement allowed line drawings to be made under computer control. Later, Calcomp manufactured its model 563, which was very similar but had a wide drum. 

The paper rolls were long. A metal bar above the take-up reel allowed a finished plot to be torn off and removed. The drum would then be advanced using the manual controls and the fresh paper end taped to the take-up reel. The standard pen was a ball-point, but liquid ink pens were available, and typically were used for higher quality plots intended for publication. Other paper stock could be taped to the drum if desired. A chart drive switch was provided to turn off the motorized paper supply and take-up reels for this purpose.

===IBM===
IBM marketed the Calcomp 565 as its IBM 1627 for use with its low-end scientific computers, first the IBM 1620, and, later, the IBM 1130. It was perhaps the first non-IBM peripheral that IBM allowed to be attached to one of its computers.

A Calcomp plotter attached to an IBM 1401 was used to develop Bresenham&#x27;s line algorithm in 1962.

<text>HCL Sametime Premium (formerly IBM Sametime and IBM Lotus Sametime) is a client–server application and middleware platform that provides real-time, unified communications and collaboration for enterprises. Those capabilities include presence information, enterprise instant messaging, web conferencing, community collaboration, and telephony capabilities and integration. Currently it is developed and sold by HCL Software, a division of Indian company HCL Technologies, until 2019 by the Lotus Software division of IBM.

Because HCL Sametime is middleware, it supports enterprise software and business process integration (Communication Enabled Business Process), either through an HCL Sametime plugin or by surfacing HCL Sametime capabilities through third-party applications. HCL Sametime integrates with a wide variety of software, including Lotus collaboration products, Microsoft Office productivity software, and portal and Web applications.

Features - Previous Versions through 11.0:

HCL Sametime is a client–server enterprise application that includes the HCL Sametime Connect client for end-users and the HCL Sametime Server for control and administration. HCL Sametime (pre v11.5) comes in four levels of functionality:

HCL Sametime Limited Use (Old name HCL Sametime Entry) provides basic presence and instant messaging.

HCL Sametime Standard provides additional functionality to HCL Sametime Entry, including:
* rich presence including location awareness
* rich-media chat, including point-to-point Voice-over-IP (VoIP) and video chat, timestamps, emoticons, and chat histories
* group and multi-way chat
* web conferencing
* contact business cards

HCL Sametime Gateway provides server-to-server interoperability between disparate communities with conversion services for different protocols, presence information awareness, and instant messaging. HCL Sametime Gateway connects HCL Sametime instant messaging cooperate communities with external communities, including external HCL Sametime, and public instant messaging communities, such as: AOL, AIM, ICQ, Yahoo, Google Talk, and XMPP. HCL Sametime Gateway replaces the Sametime Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) Gateway from earlier releases of HCL Sametime.

The HCL Sametime Gateway platform is based on IBM WebSphere Application Server, which provides failover, clustering, and scalability for the HCL Sametime Gateway deployment.
The product is shipped with the following connectors: Virtual Places, SIP, and XMPP. More protocol connectors may be added.

==Platform support, APIs and application integration==
Because HCL Sametime is middleware, it supports application and business process integration. When within the context of real-time communications, this is often referred to as Communications Enabled Business Processes. Sametime integrates in either of two ways:

# by surfacing the application into an HCL Sametime plug-in
# by surfacing HCL Sametime capabilities into the target application

Some examples of integration between HCL Sametime and applications include:
* HCL&#x27;s products including HCL Notes, HCL Domino applications, HCL Connections, HCL Quickr
* Microsoft office-productivity software including Microsoft Office, Microsoft Outlook, and Microsoft Sharepoint
* portal applications, including portals built with IBM WebSphere Portal
* web applications
* packaged enterprise applications
* embedded and client–server telephony applications

HCL Sametime Connect, the client component of HCL Sametime, is built on the Eclipse platform, allowing developers familiar with the framework to easily write plug-ins for HCL Sametime. It uses a proprietary protocol named Virtual Places, but also offers support for standard protocols, including Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), SIMPLE, T.120, XMPP, and H.323.

HCL Sametime Connect can run under Microsoft Windows, Linux, and macOS. Also available are a zero-download web client for Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Apple Safari; mobile clients are also supported for Apple iPhone, Android, Microsoft Windows Mobile, RIM Blackberry, and Symbian. The HCL Sametime server runs on Microsoft Windows, IBM AIX, IBM i (formerly i5/OS), Linux and Solaris. Sametime can also be accessed using the free software Adium, Gaim, Pidgin, and Kopete clients.

==History==
HCL Sametime became an IBM product in 1998 as the synthesis of technologies IBM acquired from two companies:

# an American company called Databeam provided the architecture to host T.120 dataconferencing (for web messaging) and H.323 Multi-Media Conferencing
# Ubique, an Israeli company whose Virtual Places Chat software technology (also known as VPBuddy) provided the &quot;presence awareness&quot; functionality that allows people to detect which of their contacts are online and available for messaging or conferencing

The Sametime v3.1 client was part of the standard platform loaded by the IBM Standard Software Installer (ISSI) for many years, enabling communications over the corporate intranet by hundreds of thousands of IBM employees. The next major release was the Sametime v7.5 client, built on the Eclipse (software) platform, enabling the use of the plug-in framework.

In 2008 Gartner positioned IBM for the first time as a &quot;leader&quot; in Gartner&#x27;s Unified Communications Magic Quadrant.

<text>The auricle or auricula is the visible part of the ear that is outside the head. It is also called the pinna (Latin for &#x27;wing&#x27; or &#x27;fin&#x27;, : pinnae), a term that is used more in zoology.

==Structure==
The diagram shows the shape and location of most of these components:

* &quot;antihelix&quot; forms a &#x27;Y&#x27; shape where the upper parts are:
** &quot;Superior crus&quot; (to the left of the &quot;fossa triangularis&quot; in the diagram)
** &quot;Inferior crus&quot; (to the right of the &quot;fossa triangularis&quot; in the diagram)
* &quot;Antitragus&quot; is below the &quot;tragus&quot;
* &quot;Aperture&quot; is the entrance to the ear canal
* &quot;Auricular sulcus&quot; is the depression behind the ear next to the head
* &quot;Concha&quot; is the hollow next to the ear canal
* Conchal angle is the angle that the back of the &quot;concha&quot; makes with the side of the head
* &quot;Crus&quot; of the helix is just above the &quot;tragus&quot;
* &quot;Cymba conchae&quot; is the narrowest end of the &quot;concha&quot;
* External auditory meatus is the ear canal
* &quot;Fossa triangularis&quot; is the depression in the fork of the &quot;antihelix&quot;
* Helix is the folded over outside edge of the ear
* &quot;Incisura anterior auris&quot;, or intertragic incisure, or intertragal notch, is the space between the &quot;tragus&quot; and &quot;antitragus&quot;
* Lobe (lobule)
* &quot;Scapha&quot;, the depression or groove between the helix and the anthelix
* Tragus

===Development===
The developing auricle is first noticeable around the sixth week of gestation in the human fetus, developing from the auricular hillocks, which are derived from the first and second pharyngeal arches. These hillocks develop into the folds of the auricle and gradually shift upwards and backwards to their final position on the head. En route accessory auricles (also known as preauricular tags) may be left behind. The first three hillocks are derived from the 1st branchial arch and form the tragus, crus of the helix, and helix, respectively. Cutaneous sensation to these areas is via the trigeminal nerve, the attendant nerve of the 1st branchial arch. The final three hillocks are derived from the second branchial arch and form the antihelix, antitragus, and lobule, respectively. These portions of the ear are supplied by the cervical plexus and a small portion by the facial nerve. This explains why vesicles are classically seen on the auricle in herpes infections of the facial nerve (Ramsay Hunt syndrome type II).

The auricle&#x27;s functions are to collect sound and transform it into directional and other information. The auricle collects sound and, like a funnel, amplifies the sound and directs it to the auditory canal. The filtering effect of the human pinnae preferentially selects sounds in the frequency range of human speech.

===Amplification and modulation===

Amplification of sound by the pinna, tympanic membrane and middle ear causes an increase in level of about 10 to 15 dB in a frequency range of 1.5 kHz to 7 kHz. This amplification is an important factor in inner ear trauma resulting from elevated sound levels.

Non-electrical hearing apparatuses which were designed to protect hearing (particularly that of musicians and others who work in loud environments) which fit snugly in the concha have been studied by the Institute of Sound and Vibration Research (ISVR) at the University of Southampton in the U.K. 

===Notch of pinna===
Due to its anatomy, the pinna largely eliminates a small segment of the frequency spectrum; this band is called the &quot;&quot;. The pinna works differently for low and high frequency sounds. For low frequencies, it behaves similarly to a reflector dish, directing sounds toward the ear canal. For high frequencies, however, its value is thought to be more sophisticated. While some of the sounds that enter the ear travel directly to the canal, others reflect off the contours of the pinna first: these enter the ear canal after a very slight delay. This delay causes phase cancellation, virtually eliminating the frequency component whose wave period is twice the delay period. Neighboring frequencies also drop significantly. In the affected frequency band – the pinna notch – the pinna creates a band-stop or notch filtering effect. This filter typically affects sounds around 10 kHz, though it can affect any frequencies from 6 – 16 kHz. It also is directionally dependent, affecting sounds coming from above more than those coming from straight ahead. This aids in vertical sound localization.

==Functions==

In animals, the function of the &quot;pinna&quot; is to collect sound, and perform spectral transformations to incoming sounds which enable the process of vertical localization to take place. It collects sound by acting as a funnel, amplifying the sound and directing it to the auditory canal. While reflecting from the pinna, sound also goes through a filtering process, as well as frequency dependent amplitude modulation which adds directional information to the sound (see sound localization, head-related transfer function, pinna notch). In various species, the pinna can also signal mood and radiate heat.

==Clinical significance==
There are various visible ear abnormalities:

* traumatic injury
* infection
* wart, mole, birthmark
* scars, including keloids
* cyst
* skin tag
* sunburn, frostbite
* pressure ulcer, often from a poorly fitting hearing aid
* anotia, absent pinna
* microtia, underdeveloped pinna
* cryptotia, a pinna covered beneath the skin of the scalp 
* Stahl&#x27;s deformity, pointed pinna due to an extra fold of cartilage
* cupped or constricted ear deformity, a hooded superior helix
* preauricular pit
* preauricular tag
* Darwin&#x27;s tubercle, protuberance on the anterior helix
* hypertrichosis, including hypertrichosis lanuginosa acquisita, a hairy pinna
* cauliflower ear, post-traumatic cartilage deformity
* tophus, nodule on the pinna related to gout
* chondrodermatitis nodularis chronica helicis (Winkler&#x27;s nodule), a nodule initiated by solar damage
* actinic keratosis and cutaneous horn, premalignant lesions caused by solar damage
* benign and malignant neoplasm, including tumors, keratoacanthoma, carcinoma

==In other species==
Visible pinnae are a common trait in therian mammals, placentals and marsupials, but are poorly developed or absent in monotremes. Marine mammals usually have either reduced pinnae or no pinnae due to sound travelling differently in water than in air, as well as the fact that auricles would potentially slow them down in the water. Skin impressions show large, mouse-like pinnae in Spinolestes.

External pinnae are absent in other tetrapod groups such as reptiles, amphibians, and birds.

<text>The Battle of the Imjin River (), also known as the Battle of Solma-ri () or Battle of Gloster Hill () in South Korea, or as Battle of Xuemali () in China, took place 22–25 April 1951 during the Korean War. Troops from the Chinese People&#x27;s Volunteer Army (PVA) attacked United Nations Command (UN) positions on the lower Imjin River in an attempt to achieve a breakthrough and recapture the South Korean capital Seoul. The attack was part of the Chinese Spring Offensive, the aim of which was to regain the initiative on the battlefield after a series of successful UN counter-offensives in January–March 1951 had allowed UN forces to establish themselves beyond the 38th Parallel at the &quot;Kansas Line&quot;.

The section of the UN line where the battle took place was defended primarily by British forces of the 29th Infantry Brigade, consisting of three British and one Belgian infantry battalions (Belgian United Nations Command) supported by tanks and artillery. Despite facing a greatly numerically superior enemy, the brigade held its general positions for three days. When the units of the 29th Infantry Brigade were ultimately forced to fall back, their actions in the Battle of the Imjin River together with those of other UN forces, for example in the Battle of Kapyong, had blunted the impetus of the PVA offensive and allowed UN forces to retreat to prepared defensive positions north of Seoul, where the PVA were halted. It is often known as the &quot;Battle that saved Seoul.&quot;

&quot;Though minor in scale, the battle&#x27;s ferocity caught the imagination of the world&quot;, especially the fate of the 1st Battalion, The Gloucestershire Regiment, which was outnumbered and eventually surrounded by Chinese forces on Hill 235, a feature that became known as Gloster Hill. The stand of the Gloucestershire battalion, together with other actions of the 29th Brigade in the Battle of the Imjin River, has become an important part of British military history and tradition.

==Background==
Following the Soviet-backed North Korean invasion of South Korea on 25 June 1950, a UN counter-offensive had reached the North Korean border with China. On the premise of fearing for its own security, China committed troops it had already moved to the border and began three offensives between 3 November 1950 and 24 January 1951 which pushed the UN forces south of the original border between North and South Korea along the 38th Parallel and captured Seoul. A fourth offensive in mid-February was blunted by UN forces in the Battle of Chipyong-ni and Third Battle of Wonju. At the end of February the UN launched a series of offensive operations, recapturing Seoul on 15 March and pushing the front line back northwards. In early April Operation Rugged established the front in a line that followed the lower Imjin river, then eastwards to the Hwacheon Reservoir and on to the Yangyang area on the east coast, known as the &quot;Kansas Line&quot;. The subsequent Operation Dauntless pushed out a salient between the Imjin river as it dog-legged north and the Hwacheon Reservoir, known as the &quot;Utah Line&quot;.

===UN Forces===

On 22 April the front line in the west along Lines &quot;Kansas&quot; and &quot;Utah&quot; was held by the United States Army (US) I Corps comprising, from west to east, the South Korean Republic of Korea Army (ROK) 1st Division, the US 3rd Division with the attached British 29th Brigade, the US 25th Division with the attached Turkish Brigade and the US 24th Division. The 29th Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Tom Brodie, consisted of the 1st Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment (Glosters), under Lieutenant-Colonel James P. Carne; the 1st Battalion Royal Northumberland Fusiliers (Fusiliers), under Lieutenant-Colonel Kingsley Foster; the 1st Battalion Royal Ulster Rifles (Rifles), under the temporary command of Major Gerald Rickord; and the Belgian Battalion, under Lieutenant-Colonel Albert Crahay (700 men), to which Luxembourg&#x27;s contribution to the UN forces was attached. The brigade was supported by the 25 pounders of 45 Field Regiment Royal Artillery (RA) commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel MT Young, the 4.2 inch mortars of 170 Independent Mortar Battery RA, the Centurion tanks of C Squadron 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars under the command of Major Henry Huth, and by 55 Squadron Royal Engineers.

The four battalions of 29th Brigade covered a front of . Gaps between units had to be accepted because there was no possibility of forming a continuous line with the forces available. &quot;Brigadier Brodie determined to deploy his men in separate unit positions, centred upon key hill features&quot; On the left flank, the Glosters were guarding a ford over the Imjin east of the ROK 1st Division; the Fusiliers were deployed near the centre, around northeast of the Glosters; the Belgians, occupying a feature called Hill 194 on the right, were the only element of the 29th Brigade north of the river. Their connection with the rest of the brigade depended on two pontoon bridges about apart. These bridges connected the Belgians with Route 11, the 29th Brigade&#x27;s main line of supply and communication. The Rifles served as the brigade&#x27;s reserve and were deployed along Route 11. Extensive defensive preparations were not completed because the British expected to hold the position for only a short time. Neither minefields, deeply dug shelters nor extensive wire obstacles had been constructed. The British position on the Imjin river &quot;was deemed safe&quot; but vulnerable in case of an attack.

===Chinese forces===

The commander-in-chief of the PVA and North Korean Korean People&#x27;s Army (KPA) forces in the Field, Marshal Peng Dehuai, planned to &quot;wipe out...the American 3rd Division...the British 29th Brigade and the 1st Division of the Republic of Korean Army...after this we can wipe out the American 24th Division and 25th Division&quot;, and promised the capture of Seoul as a May Day gift to Mao Zedong. To achieve the objective Peng planned to converge on Seoul with three PVA army groups and a KPA corps; a total strength of some 305,000 men. The III and IX Army Groups were to attack the right flank of the US 3rd Division and the 24th and 25th Divisions on the &quot;Utah Line&quot;, east of the Imjin where it turned north. The XIX Army Group on the PVA right flank, west of the Imjin river where it turned north, were to attack the remainder of the 3rd Division and the ROK 1st Division. On the XIX Army Group front, the KPA I Corps and PVA 64th Army would attack the ROK 1st Division, while the 63rd Army would attack on their left, pitting it against 29th Brigade. The 63rd Army comprised three divisions, the 187th, 188th and 189th, with each division comprising three regiments, each of which comprised three battalions. Some 27,000 men in 27 battalions would be attacking 29th Brigade&#x27;s four battalions, albeit in echelon, one division after the other.

==Battle==
===The first night===
The battle opened on the night of 22 April 1951. A PVA patrol on the north bank of the river moved around the Belgians on Hill 194 and continued to advance east towards the two bridges on which the Belgians depended. Elements of the 29th Brigade&#x27;s reserve, the 1st RUR, were deployed forward at about 22:00 to secure the crossing but were soon engaged by PVA forces trying to cross the river. The Royal Ulster Rifles were unable to secure the bridges. This development meant that the Belgian battalion on the north bank of the river was in danger of being isolated from the rest of the 29th Brigade.

PVA forces following the initial patrol either attacked the Belgian positions on Hill 194 or continued their advance towards the bridges. Those who were able to cross the Imjin attacked the Fusiliers&#x27; right rear company, Z Company, on Hill 257, a position close to the river and almost directly south of the crossings. Further downstream, PVA forces managed to ford the Imjin and attacked the Fusiliers&#x27; left forward company, X Company, on Hill 152. The retreat of X Company from Hill 152 had serious consequences for Y Company, which occupied the right forward position of what can be described as a squarish fusilier position marked out by four widely spaced company perimeters at the corners. Although Y Company was not attacked directly, PVA forces threatened its flanks by forcing Z and X Companies from their positions. After unsuccessful British attempts to regain those lost positions on Hill 257 and 194, Y Company&#x27;s position was abandoned, the retreat being covered by C Squadron, 8th Hussars.

On the left of the brigade&#x27;s line, a patrol of 17 men from the Glosters&#x27; C Company lying in wait on the river bank repulsed three attempts by a battalion of the 559th Regiment, 187th Division to cross the river, eventually retiring without loss when their ammunition ran low and assaulting troops finally gained the opposite bank. During the night the Glosters&#x27; A and D Companies were attacked, and by 07:30 A Company, outnumbered six to one, had been forced from its position on Castle Hill. An attempt to retake it failed, during which Lieutenant Philip Curtis single-handedly destroyed a PVA machine-gun position with a grenade but was himself killed by a burst of machine-gun fire in the process. He was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

===The Glosters&#x27; withdrawal to Hill 235===
On 23 April, attempts by the Fusiliers and forces from the US 3rd Infantry Division&#x27;s reserve to regain control of areas lost during the night failed. An attack by the US 1st Battalion, 7th Infantry, on enemy forces near Hill 257 was ordered to support the Belgian withdrawal from the north bank of the Imjin River. Despite losing seven vehicles, the Belgian Battalion successfully withdrew to the east and took up new positions south of the Glosters and the Fusiliers before moving to the vicinity of the 29th Brigade&#x27;s command post.

At around 20:30 on 23 April, the Glosters&#x27; A Company, now at less than half strength and with all officers killed or wounded, fell back to Hill 235. The withdrawal left D Company&#x27;s position exposed, and with one of its platoons badly mauled in the overnight fighting, it too withdrew to the hill. B Company had not been pressed during the night, but the withdrawal of D Company on their left and the Fusiliers on their right left them exposed, and they were withdrawn to Hill 316, east of C Company.

During the night of 23/24 April, the Glosters&#x27; B Company, outnumbered 18:1, endured six assaults, calling in artillery on their own position to break up the last of them. Low on ammunition and having taken many casualties, the seventh assault at 08:10 forced them to abandon their position, and just 20 survivors made it to Hill 235, to which battalion HQ, the Support Company and C Company had already withdrawn. As B Company fought for its life, the PVA 188th Division crossed the Imjin and attacked the Fusiliers and the Royal Ulster Rifles on the right of the brigade&#x27;s line. The 187th Division also engaged the brigade&#x27;s battalions on the right, while the 189th Division kept up the pressure on the left.

Most dangerous for the integrity of the 29th Brigade was the deep penetration of the line between the Glosters and the Fusiliers which had cut off the former. To counter the PVA attack and protect the Glosters from being completely surrounded, the Philippine 10th Battalion Combat Team (BCT) was temporarily attached to the 29th Brigade. A combined force of M24 tanks of the 10th BCT and Centurions of the 8th Hussars supported by infantry reached a point from Hill 235 on 24 April. However, the column failed to make contact as the lead tank was hit by PVA fire and knocked out, blocking the route and making any further advance against heavy resistance impossible. At this point, according to an official American narrative of operations, &quot;the brigade commander considered it unwise to continue the effort to relieve the Gloucester Battalion and withdrew the relief force&quot;.

The Glosters were not alone on Hill 235. Throughout the battle, they were supported by the men of C Troop 170th Mortar Battery, Royal Artillery.
As with The Glosters, C Troop lost men and fought to the end.
Those who survived were taken prisoner with the Glosters and marched North.

The Presidential Citation presented to all who fought on Hill 235 included the brave men of C Troop 170th Mortar Battery.
Whilst the Glorious Glosters are rightly named so, it must not be forgotten, that the men of C Troop 170th Mortar Battery RA fought side by side with them.
The Presidential Citation was awarded for Esprit de Corps: Glosters &amp; 170th Mortar Battery together 
All brave men together.

===Retreat of the 29th Brigade===

Continued PVA pressure on the UN forces along the Imjin prevented a planned attack by the US 1st and 3rd Battalions, 65th Infantry, to relieve the Glosters. When two further attempts by a tank troop to link up with the Glosters failed, Brodie left the decision to Carne whether to attempt a break-out or surrender. No further attempts to relieve the Glosters were undertaken because, at 08:00 on 25 April, US I Corps issued the order to execute Plan Golden A, which called for a withdrawal of all forces to a new defensive position further south.

In accordance with orders issued by I Corps, the Fusiliers, Rifles and Belgians, supported by the tanks of the 8th Hussars and the Royal Engineers of 55 Squadron, withdrew to the safety of the next UN position. The Belgians occupied blocking positions west and southwest of the 29th Brigade&#x27;s command post in order to allow the other units of the brigade to fall back through the battalion&#x27;s positions. The withdrawal under intense enemy pressure was made even more difficult by the fact that PVA forces dominated parts of the high ground along the line of retreat; they were able not only to observe any movements by the 29th Brigade, but also to inflict heavy casualties on the retreating units. Among those killed was the commanding officer of the Fusiliers, Lieutenant-Colonel Foster, who died when his jeep was hit by PVA mortar fire. In the words of Major Henry Huth of the 8th Hussars, the retreat was &quot;one long bloody ambush&quot;. When B Company of the Ulsters, which had acted as rearguard during the retreat, reached the safety of the next UN line, all elements of the 29th Brigade except for the Glosters had completed the withdrawal.

===The Glosters on Hill 235===
The Glosters&#x27; situation on Hill 235 made it impossible for them to join the rest of the 29th Brigade after it had received the order to retreat. Even before the failed attempts to relieve the battalion on 24 April, B and C Companies had already suffered such heavy casualties that they were merged to form one company. Attempts to supply the battalion by air drop were unsuccessful. Despite their difficult situation, the Glosters held their positions on Hill 235 throughout 24 April and the night of 24/25 April. In the morning of 25 April, 45 Field Regiment could no longer provide artillery support. Since Brodie had left the final decision to Carne, the Glosters&#x27; CO &quot;gave the order to his company commanders to make for the British lines as best as they could&quot; on the morning of 25 April. Only the remains of D Company, under the command of Major Mike Harvey, reached the UN lines after several days. The rest of the battalion surrendered and 459 of them were taken prisoner, including Carne.

==Aftermath==
===Importance of the battle===
Had the PVA achieved a breakthrough in the initial stages of their assault, they would have been able to outflank the ROK 1st Division to the west and the US 3rd Infantry Division to the east of the 29th Brigade. Such a development would have threatened the stability of the UN line and increased the likelihood of success for a PVA advance on Seoul. Although the PVA benefited from the brigade&#x27;s scattered deployment and lack of defensive preparations, they were nevertheless unable to take the positions before UN forces could check further advances. In three days of fighting, the determined resistance of the 29th Brigade severely disrupted the PVA offensive, causing it to lose momentum, and allowed UN forces in the area to withdraw to the &quot;No-Name Line&quot;, a defensive position north of Seoul, where the PVA/KPA were halted.

The scope and the outcome of the Imjin River engagement have been subjected to several interpretations according to different historiography traditions. According to official Chinese history, the elimination of the 1st Battalion, Gloucestershire Regiment by the Chinese 63rd Army is considered to be an important victory, although the failure of the 64th and the 65th Army to eliminate the entire British 29th Independent Infantry Brigade and capture Seoul due to the defense of ROK 1st Infantry Division was a serious setback. On the other hand, the South Korean contributions to the Imjin River battle are only recorded in sparse detail by the official South Korean history, but historian Allan R. Millet has argued that the ROK 1st Infantry Division&#x27;s performance in battle demonstrated the potential of South Korean armed forces, in the wake of serious failures during the period of 1950–51. In British Empire countries, the engagement has been interpreted as the 29th Brigade&#x27;s sacrifice, against impossible odds when facing the Chinese 63rd Army, which ultimately prevented the Chinese from capturing Seoul. Regardless of the interpretations, independent research from historians Zhang Shu Guang and Andrew Salmon concluded that the actions of the 29th Brigade had disrupted the Chinese advance sufficiently to affect the outcome of the First Chinese Spring Offensive.

===Casualties===
According to a memorandum presented to the British cabinet on 26 June 1951, 29th Brigade suffered 1,091 casualties, including 34 officers and 808 other ranks missing. These casualties represented 20 to 25 percent of the brigade&#x27;s strength on the eve of battle. Of the 1,091 soldiers killed, wounded or missing, 620 were from the Gloucestershire Regiment, which could muster only 217 men on 27 April. 522 soldiers of the Gloucestershire Regiment became prisoners of war. Of those taken prisoner, 180 were wounded and a further 34 died while in captivity. 59 soldiers of the Gloucestershire Regiment were killed in action. Based on estimates, PVA casualties in the Battle of the Imjin River were at least 10,000, with some sources stating upwards of 15,000. As a result of the casualties suffered during the battle, the PVA 63rd Army, which had begun the offensive with three divisions and approximately 27,000 men, had lost over a third of its strength and was pulled out of the front line.

===Memorial===
The Gloucester Valley Battle Monument was later built at Gloster Hill , beside the Seolmacheon stream.

The British Embassy in Seoul organises a service, officially called the Gloster Valley Memorial Service, for veterans on every anniversary of the battle. In 2008, it took place on 19 April as part of formal commemoration ceremonies that were held during 14–20 April. The outline of the commemorations in 2008 encompassed a service of commemoration, including the laying of wreaths and the presentations of Gloster Valley Scholarships – financial assistance to deserving children in the area where the battle took place – as well as a picnic lunch that offered visitors the opportunity to mingle with veterans. About 70 British veterans and the British ambassador to South Korea took part in the event.

====Unit citations====
Three units were awarded the US Presidential Unit Citation for their part in the Battle of the Imjin River:
* 1st Battalion Gloucestershire Regiment
* C Troop, 170 Independent Mortar Battery, Royal Artillery
* Belgian battalion

On 8 May 1951, by the command of U.S. President Harry S. Truman, General James Van Fleet presented the President&#x27;s Distinguished Unit Citation to the Glosters, together with C Troop, 170 Heavy Mortar Battery, which had given invaluable support throughout the battle. The citation says:


The Belgian United Nations Command, which was attached to the British 29th Brigade and replaced the 900 men of the Royal Ulster Rifles on 20 April 1951, initially held the brigade&#x27;s right flank on the north bank of the river. It also included a Luxembourg platoon. It fought the Chinese there and then conducted a fighting withdrawal, supported by U.S. forces, before taking position in the center of the brigade&#x27;s line, ahead of brigade headquarters, for the attempts to relieve the Glosters. The Belgian battalion was awarded the United States Distinguished Unit Citation and the Republic of Korea Presidential Unit Citation for their conduct during the battle.

<text>The post-mortem interval (PMI) is the time that has elapsed since an individual&#x27;s death. When the time of death is not known, the interval may be estimated, and so an approximate time of death established. Postmortem interval estimations can range from hours, to days or even years depending on the type of evidence present. There are standard medical and scientific techniques supporting such an estimation.

==Examination of body and scene of death==

Changes to a body occurring after death (post-mortem changes) include:

* Algor mortis: body cooling;
* Livor mortis: settling of blood in the lowest-placed parts of the body;
* Rigor mortis: stiffening of limbs.

Conditions at the scene of death affect the estimation of time of death. To &quot;algor mortis&quot;, &quot;livor mortis&quot; and &quot;rigor mortis&quot;, together with consideration of stomach contents, there needs to be some observation of environmental conditions at the death scene to accurately measure the PMI (Fig. 1). Factors that can affect the rate of human decomposition are concerned with the particular environment a body has been recovered from. Bodies can be found anywhere from terrestrial to aquatic environments, each possessing their own variables that can alter interval estimations. Along with common factors of temperature, humidity and element exposure, body habitus and clothing are an example of a component that can affect the rate of cooling of the body, and so its rate of decomposition. A very approximate rule of thumb for estimating the postmortem interval is as follows:
*Warm and flaccid: less than 3 hours
*Warm and stiff: 3 to 8 hours
*Cold and stiff: 8 to 36 hours
*Cold and flaccid: More than 36 hours.
Due to significant environmental variations between regions, universal formulas would be ill-suited for this topic in forensic science.

==Analytical techniques==
There are analytical techniques that can be used to determine the interval:

* Forensic entomology: insect (especially blowfly) activity on the corpse.
* Forensic botany: Plant and soil effects on the process of decomposition.
* Forensic pathology: Cause of death determination and subsequent postmortem changes
* Ocular changes: vitreous chemistry composition, eye structural changes. 
* State or stage of decomposition: autolysis (process of self-digestion) and putrefaction (process caused by bacteria found within the body).

More advanced methods include DNA quantification, infrared spectroscopy, and for buried individuals changes in soil composition such as the levels of methane, phosphates and nitrates, ninhydrin-reactive nitrogen, volatile organic compounds, and water conductivity, could also reveal the time of death.

<text>Geebung railway station is located on the North Coast line in Queensland, Australia. It serves the Brisbane suburb of Geebung.

==History==
On 28 August 2000, a third platform opened as part of the addition of a third track from Northgate to Bald Hills.

In June 2013, a construction crew of an overpass at the Geebung railway station in northern Brisbane uncovered the 50-million-year-old fossilized remains (vertebrae) of a 5-metre crocodile trapped in a layer of oil shale. Workers drilling holes as part of an overpass reach the crocodile remains, as well as frogs, fish and plant fossils, in the &quot;spoil,&quot; the oil shale rock and soil found in the excavation pit. The fossil remains were discovered by a work crew drilling a hole for a bridge support over an area called the Zillman Waterholes.

In 2014, the level crossing to the south of the station was replaced by a bridge.

==Services==
Geebung is served by all Citytrain network services from Kippa-Ring to Central, many continuing to Springfield Central

<doc id="856347" wikidata="Q988381" url="?curid=856347" title="Tor functor">
<text>In mathematics, the Tor functors are the derived functors of the tensor product of modules over a ring. Along with the Ext functor, Tor is one of the central concepts of homological algebra, in which ideas from algebraic topology are used to construct invariants of algebraic structures. The homology of groups, Lie algebras, and associative algebras can all be defined in terms of Tor. The name comes from a relation between the first Tor group Tor1 and the torsion subgroup of an abelian group.

In the special case of abelian groups, Tor was introduced by Eduard Čech (1935) and named by Samuel Eilenberg around 1950. It was first applied to the Künneth theorem and universal coefficient theorem in topology. For modules over any ring, Tor was defined by Henri Cartan and Eilenberg in their 1956 book &quot;Homological Algebra&quot;.

==Definition==
Let &quot;R&quot; be a ring. Write &quot;R&quot;-Mod for the category of left &quot;R&quot;-modules and Mod-&quot;R&quot; for the category of right &quot;R&quot;-modules. (If &quot;R&quot; is commutative, the two categories can be identified.) For a fixed left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;B&quot;, let formula_1 for &quot;A&quot; in Mod-&quot;R&quot;. This is a right exact functor from Mod-&quot;R&quot; to the category of abelian groups Ab, and so it has left derived functors formula_2. The Tor groups are the abelian groups defined by
formula_3
for an integer &quot;i&quot;. By definition, this means: take any projective resolution
formula_4
and remove &quot;A&quot;, and form the chain complex:
formula_5

For each integer &quot;i&quot;, the group formula_6 is the homology of this complex at position &quot;i&quot;. It is zero for &quot;i&quot; negative. Moreover, formula_7 is the cokernel of the map formula_8, which is isomorphic to formula_9.

Alternatively, one can define Tor by fixing &quot;A&quot; and taking the left derived functors of the right exact functor formula_10. That is, tensor &quot;A&quot; with a projective resolution of &quot;B&quot; and take homology. Cartan and Eilenberg showed that these constructions are independent of the choice of projective resolution, and that both constructions yield the same Tor groups. Moreover, for a fixed ring &quot;R&quot;, Tor is a functor in each variable (from &quot;R&quot;-modules to abelian groups).

For a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; and &quot;R&quot;-modules &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, formula_11 is an &quot;R&quot;-module (using that formula_12 is an &quot;R&quot;-module in this case). For a non-commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, formula_11 is only an abelian group, in general. If &quot;R&quot; is an algebra over a ring &quot;S&quot; (which means in particular that &quot;S&quot; is commutative), then formula_11 is at least an &quot;S&quot;-module.

==Properties==
Here are some of the basic properties and computations of Tor groups.

*Tor(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) ≅ &quot;A&quot; ⊗&quot;R&quot; &quot;B&quot; for any right &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;A&quot; and left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;B&quot;.
*Tor(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0 if either &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; is flat (for example, free) as an &quot;R&quot;-module. In fact, one can compute Tor using a flat resolution of either &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot;; this is more general than a projective (or free) resolution.
*There are converses to the previous statement:
**If Tor(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;A&quot; is flat (and hence Tor(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0).
**If Tor(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;A&quot;, then &quot;B&quot; is flat (and hence Tor(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) = 0 for all &quot;i&quot; &gt; 0).
*By the general properties of derived functors, every short exact sequence 0 → &quot;K&quot; → &quot;L&quot; → &quot;M&quot; → 0 of right &quot;R&quot;-modules induces a long exact sequence of the form formula_15 for any left &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;B&quot;. The analogous exact sequence also holds for Tor with respect to the second variable.
*Symmetry: for a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, there is a natural isomorphism Tor(&quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;) ≅ Tor(&quot;B&quot;, &quot;A&quot;). (For &quot;R&quot; commutative, there is no need to distinguish between left and right &quot;R&quot;-modules.)
*If &quot;R&quot; is a commutative ring and &quot;u&quot; in &quot;R&quot; is not a zero divisor, then for any &quot;R&quot;-module &quot;B&quot;, formula_16 where formula_17 is the &quot;u&quot;-torsion subgroup of &quot;B&quot;. This is the explanation for the name Tor. Taking &quot;R&quot; to be the ring formula_18 of integers, this calculation can be used to compute formula_19 for any finitely generated abelian group &quot;A&quot;.
*Generalizing the previous example, one can compute Tor groups that involve the quotient of a commutative ring by any regular sequence, using the Koszul complex. For example, if &quot;R&quot; is the polynomial ring &quot;k&quot;[&quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;] over a field &quot;k&quot;, then formula_20 is the exterior algebra over &quot;k&quot; on &quot;n&quot; generators in Tor1.
* formula_21 for all &quot;i&quot; ≥ 2. The reason: every abelian group &quot;A&quot; has a free resolution of length 1, since every subgroup of a free abelian group is free abelian. 
* Generalizing the previous example, formula_22 for all &quot;i&quot; ≥ 2 if formula_23 is a principal ideal domain (PID). The reason: every module &quot;A&quot; over a PID has a free resolution of length 1, since every submodule of a free module over a PID is free. 
*For any ring &quot;R&quot;, Tor preserves direct sums (possibly infinite) and filtered colimits in each variable. For example, in the first variable, this says that formula_24
*Flat base change: for a commutative flat &quot;R&quot;-algebra &quot;T&quot;, &quot;R&quot;-modules &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, and an integer &quot;i&quot;, formula_25 It follows that Tor commutes with localization. That is, for a multiplicatively closed set &quot;S&quot; in &quot;R&quot;, formula_26
*For a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; and commutative &quot;R&quot;-algebras &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, Tor(&quot;A&quot;,&quot;B&quot;) has the structure of a graded-commutative algebra over &quot;R&quot;. Moreover, elements of odd degree in the Tor algebra have square zero, and there are divided power operations on the elements of positive even degree.

==Important special cases==

*Group homology is defined by formula_27 where &quot;G&quot; is a group, &quot;M&quot; is a representation of &quot;G&quot; over the integers, and formula_28 is the group ring of &quot;G&quot;.
*For an algebra &quot;A&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot; and an &quot;A&quot;-bimodule &quot;M&quot;, Hochschild homology is defined by formula_29
*Lie algebra homology is defined by formula_30, where formula_31 is a Lie algebra over a commutative ring &quot;R&quot;, &quot;M&quot; is a formula_31-module, and formula_33 is the universal enveloping algebra.
*For a commutative ring &quot;R&quot; with a homomorphism onto a field &quot;k&quot;, formula_20 is a graded-commutative Hopf algebra over &quot;k&quot;. (If &quot;R&quot; is a Noetherian local ring with residue field &quot;k&quot;, then the dual Hopf algebra to formula_20 is Ext(&quot;k&quot;,&quot;k&quot;).) As an algebra, formula_20 is the free graded-commutative divided power algebra on a graded vector space π*(&quot;R&quot;). When &quot;k&quot; has characteristic zero, π*(&quot;R&quot;) can be identified with the André-Quillen homology &quot;D&quot;*(&quot;k&quot;/&quot;R&quot;,&quot;k&quot;).

<doc id="856350" wikidata="Q7876903" url="?curid=856350" title="Udall family">
<text>The Udall family is a U.S. political family rooted in the American West. Its role in politics spans over 100 years and four generations. Udall politicians have been elected from four different states: Arizona, Colorado, New Mexico, and Oregon. If viewed as a combined entity, the Udall-Hunt-Lee family has been elected from six states: Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, and Utah.

Three Udall family cousins were nominated by the two major American political parties for the United States Senate elections of 2008, of which the two Democrats were elected and seated in 2009.

==Pioneer generation==
David King Udall can be considered the family&#x27;s founder. He was born in St. Louis, Missouri, to David Udall and Eliza King, recent Mormon converts from England. They immigrated to the United States in 1851. The family traveled across the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains by ox cart and settled in Nephi, Utah. The elder David later became a Mormon bishop.

In this environment, the younger David grew up to be a fervent Mormon as well. He married Ella Stewart, and they settled in Kanab, Utah. Shortly after their marriage, David left to serve as a missionary in England for two years. In 1880, he was called by his church to move with his family to St. Johns, Apache County, Arizona, in order to become the local bishop and facilitate further Mormon migration into that community. This made David unpopular with established residents of St. Johns, who didn&#x27;t want the Mormons there, but it did make him instantly prominent in the community.
David married a second wife, Ida Hunt, in 1882. She was a granddaughter of Jefferson Hunt. David was prosecuted for, but not convicted of, bigamy in 1884. In 1885, he was indicted for perjury stemming from a sworn statement he made backing a land claim for Miles Romney (the grandfather of George W. Romney). His bail was posted by Baron Goldwater, the father of Barry Goldwater. The trial and its aftermath received heavy regional press coverage. David was convicted and sentenced to three years of imprisonment at a federal penitentiary in Detroit. Later, both the prosecutor and presiding judge at the trial wrote letters to President Grover Cleveland supporting a pardon, stating they believed that David had misunderstood the law and that he lacked any criminal intent. President Cleveland issued a pardon after David had served just three months of his sentence.

In 1887, David was made a stake president, a higher position in the Mormon hierarchy. In that position, he oversaw Mormon affairs over a broad portion of Arizona.

That same year, Tommy Stewart, David&#x27;s double brother-in-law, was elected to serve in the Utah Territorial Legislature. David&#x27;s wife Eliza was Tommy&#x27;s sister, and Tommy was married to David&#x27;s sister Mary, making Tommy a member of the Udall family by marriage. Tommy would later become mayor of Kanab.

In 1890, the LDS Church officially declared that it opposed its members entering into polygamous marriages. After this, hostility toward Mormons in many communities outside Utah decreased. Between improved relations with non-Mormons and an ever-growing Mormon population in eastern Arizona, David&#x27;s popularity improved, such that he was elected to a single term in the Arizona Territorial Legislature in 1899 as a Republican. He died as a widely respected member of his community in 1938, living long enough to see several of his sons elected to public office.

David&#x27;s younger brother, Joseph Udall, also settled in Arizona, becoming a Mormon Bishop in Eagar, Arizona, and was active in local politics. He served as chairman of the Apache County Board of Supervisors, 1906–1920.

== Sons of David King Udall ==
Twelve of David King Udall&#x27;s children lived to adulthood, six by each of his wives. Four of his sons became attorneys; of those, all were elected or appointed to political and judicial offices. All of the Udall politicians descended from David&#x27;s wife Eliza have been Democrats, while most of the politicians descended from his wife Ida have been Republicans.

The first of David&#x27;s children to seek office was Levi Stewart Udall, who ran for clerk to the Arizona Superior Court in 1922 as a Democrat. His older brother, John Hunt Udall, then filed to run for the same office as a Republican. John won.

John was later elected mayor of Phoenix, Arizona, and he served in that office from 1936 to 1938. He later served as a judge and was narrowly defeated as a candidate for the U.S. Congress in 1948. He was first married to Ruth Kimball, sister of Spencer W. Kimball and niece by marriage of Joseph F. Smith. Ruth died at a young age, and he remarried to Leah Smith, daughter of Jesse Nathaniel Smith.

Levi followed a career in the judiciary and was elected Justice of the Arizona Supreme Court in 1946. He served on that Court from 1947 until his death in 1960, and he was Chief Justice 1951–1953 and 1957–1959. Levi was married to Louisa Lee. His brother, Jesse, was married to Louisa&#x27;s sister, Lela Lee. For this reason, their respective descendants are double cousins. The Lee sisters were granddaughters of John D. Lee and Jacob Hamblin.

Jesse Addison Udall served in the Arizona House of Representatives from 1931 to 1938. Upon his brother Levi&#x27;s death, he was appointed by the governor to fill the same seat on the Arizona Supreme Court. He served 1960–1972, and he was Chief Justice in 1964 and 1969.

Don Taylor Udall served as Representative to the Arizona State Legislature from 1941–1942. He resigned to serve in World War II and would later become a judge.

== Grandchildren of David King Udall ==
Nick Udall, son of John H. Udall, followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps and served as mayor of Phoenix from 1948 to 1952. Unlike his father, he was a Democrat. He also served as a Superior Court Judge in Maricopa County, Arizona, from 1952 to 1956. Many kinships between the Udalls and other politicians and well-known people come through Nick. This is not so surprising when considering that Nick was a great-grandson of Utah Lieutenant Governor Heber C. Kimball, who had 43 wives, 63 children, 176 grandchildren, and 564 great-grandchildren. Among Nick&#x27;s cousins is U.S. Ambassador J. Reuben Clark.

Stewart Lee Udall, son of Levi S. Udall, served as a Democratic U.S. Representative from Arizona (1955–1961) and also as Secretary of the Interior (1961–1969). Point Udall, U.S. Virgin Islands, the easternmost point in the United States, is named in his honor.

Morris King &quot;Mo&quot; Udall, Stewart&#x27;s brother, also served as a Democratic U.S. Representative from Arizona (1961–1991) and ran for the Democratic nomination for President of the United States in 1976. Point Udall, Guam, the westernmost point in the United States, is named in his honor.

David K. Udall, son of Jesse A. Udall, served as a city councilman in Mesa, Arizona, for eight years.

L. Kenyon Udall, son of Jesse A. Udall, served as the mayor of Gilbert, Arizona, from January 17, 1956, to June 8, 1959. 

Joseph Leon Pace, son of Luella Udall Pace, was mayor of San Jose, California, during the 1960s.

== Fourth generation ==
Thomas Stewart &quot;Tom&quot; Udall, Stewart Udall&#x27;s son, was the first of David King Udall&#x27;s great-grandchildren to hold political office. He was a practicing attorney and ran unsuccessfully for Congress as a Democrat in New Mexico in 1984 and 1988. In 1990, he was elected Attorney General of New Mexico, a position he held from 1991–1999. He was finally elected to the U.S. House of Representatives from New Mexico&#x27;s 3rd District in 1998, and he served as Representative from 1999–2009. During this period, he served in Congress beside his cousins Mark Udall and Gordon Smith (see below), marking one of the very few times in history when three members of the same family have served in Congress simultaneously. In 2008, he was elected to the U.S. Senate from New Mexico in a landslide victory. He took office in January 2009. In 2019, he announced he would not seek a third term. 

Gordon Harold Smith, Jesse Udall&#x27;s grandson through his daughter Jessica Udall Smith, was the next to venture into politics. His father, Milan Dale Smith, Sr., was an Assistant Secretary of Agriculture, and he later built a successful frozen food empire. Gordon obtained a law degree and initially pursued a career as an attorney before later taking over the frozen food business. In 1992, he was elected to the Oregon State Senate as a Republican. He became president of that body in 1995. In 1996, he was narrowly defeated when running for the U.S. Senate in a special election to replace Bob Packwood. Later that year, he won election to Oregon&#x27;s other U.S. Senate seat, the only time anyone has ever run for the Senate twice in the same year. He served in the Senate from 1997–2009. In 2008, he was narrowly defeated for reelection, following a shift in Oregon politics over the preceding decade toward the Democratic Party. He was the last remaining Republican to hold statewide office at the time. Most Udall politicians have also been either Hunt or Lee descendants. Gordon Smith is unique in being descended from both additional lines.

Mark Emery Udall, Morris Udall&#x27;s son, pursued a 20-year career as an Outward Bound instructor and director before launching a political career in 1996 with a successful campaign for the Colorado State House of Representatives as a Democrat. He served a single term there before making a successful bid for the U.S. House from Colorado&#x27;s 2nd Congressional District in 1998. He held that office for ten years. In 2008, he was elected to the U.S. Senate from Colorado, and he was seated in January 2009. Raised Presbyterian, Mark is the first non-Mormon politician in the family. With Barack Obama&#x27;s nomination of Ken Salazar as Secretary of the Interior, Colorado&#x27;s other Senate seat was vacated on January 20, 2009, and Mark became Colorado&#x27;s senior senator after just three weeks in office. In 2014, he was defeated for re-election by Republican Cory Gardner.

Milan Dale Smith, Jr., Gordon Smith&#x27;s brother, was nominated to the federal judiciary by George W. Bush in 2006. He was unanimously confirmed by the Senate (including his brother), and he currently serves on the U.S. Ninth Circuit.

David King Udall, son of Mesa councilman David K. Udall, serves as a Superior Court Judge in Maricopa County, Arizona (since 2001). His brother Jesse is married [2] to Michelle Udall, who was elected to the Arizona House of Representatives in 2016.

Mike Lee and Thomas R. Lee, though not Udalls, are second cousins to Mark and Tom Udall and Gordon Smith; their father, Rex E. Lee, a well-known scholar of constitutional law and solicitor general from 1981 to 1985, was a first cousin of Stewart and Morris Udall; Mike Lee serves as a United States senator from Utah (since 2011); and Thomas R. Lee is an associate justice of the Utah Supreme Court.

<text>The IBM 1627 was a rebranded Calcomp plotter sold by IBM for use with the IBM 1620, and, later, the IBM 1130 computers. It became perhaps the first non-IBM peripheral that IBM allowed to be attached to one of its computers.

The plotter fed a roll of paper with perforated edges over a drum with matching sprockets at the sides. The drum could move the paper forward and backward (the X-axis). A pen holder slid horizontally over the paper (the Y-axis). Both the drum and the pen holder were controlled by stepper motors. Commands included lowering the pen down to write and raising it up, and moving the drum or the pen holder one step of in either direction. There were also commands to move the drum and pen together one step in the four diagonal directions.

The standard size 1627 Model 1 was a Calcomp model 565 plotter and used 12-inch-wide paper (305 mm) with a plotting area of . Model 1 could operate at 18,000 steps per minute. Model 2 was a Calcomp 563 and used 31-inch-wide paper (787 mm) with a plotting area of . Model 2 could operate at 12,000 steps per minute. 

The paper rolls were long. A metal bar above the take-up reel allowed a finished plot to be torn off and removed. The drum would then be advanced using the manual controls and the fresh paper end taped to the take-up reel. The standard pen was a ball-point, but liquid ink pens were available, and typically used for higher quality plots intended for publication. Other paper stock could be taped to the drum if desired. A chart drive switch was provided to turn off the motorized paper supply and take-up reels for this purpose.

<doc id="856356" wikidata="Q4681307" url="?curid=856356" title="Addition-chain exponentiation">
<text>In mathematics and computer science, optimal addition-chain exponentiation is a method of exponentiation by a positive integer power that requires a minimal number of multiplications. Using &quot;the form of&quot; the shortest addition chain, with multiplication instead of addition, computes the desired exponent (instead of multiple) of the base. (This corresponds to .) Each exponentiation in the chain can be evaluated by multiplying two of the earlier exponentiation results. More generally, &quot;addition-chain exponentiation&quot; may also refer to exponentiation by non-minimal addition chains constructed by a variety of algorithms (since a shortest addition chain is very difficult to find).

The shortest addition-chain algorithm requires no more multiplications than binary exponentiation and usually less. The first example of where it does better is for &quot;a&quot;15, where the binary method needs six multiplications but the shortest addition chain requires only five:

:formula_1 (binary, 6 multiplications)
:formula_2 (shortest addition chain, 5 multiplications).
:formula_3 (also shortest addition chain, 5 multiplications).

On the other hand, the determination of a shortest addition chain is hard: no efficient optimal methods are currently known for arbitrary exponents, and the related problem of finding a shortest addition chain for a given set of exponents has been proven NP-complete. Even given a shortest chain, addition-chain exponentiation requires more memory than the binary method, because it must potentially store many previous exponents from the chain. So in practice, shortest addition-chain exponentiation is primarily used for small fixed exponents for which a shortest chain can be pre-computed and is not too large.

There are also several methods to &quot;approximate&quot; a shortest addition chain, and which often require fewer multiplications than binary exponentiation; binary exponentiation itself is a suboptimal addition-chain algorithm. The optimal algorithm choice depends on the context (such as the relative cost of the multiplication and the number of times a given exponent is re-used).

The problem of finding the shortest addition chain cannot be solved by dynamic programming, because it does not satisfy the assumption of optimal substructure. That is, it is not sufficient to decompose the power into smaller powers, each of which is computed minimally, since the addition chains for the smaller powers may be related (to share computations). For example, in the shortest addition chain for &quot;a&quot;15 above, the subproblem for &quot;a&quot;6 must be computed as (&quot;a&quot;3)2 since &quot;a&quot;3 is re-used (as opposed to, say, &quot;a&quot;6 = &quot;a&quot;2(&quot;a&quot;2)2, which also requires three multiplies).

==Addition-subtraction–chain exponentiation==
If both multiplication and division are allowed, then an addition-subtraction chain may be used to obtain even fewer total multiplications+divisions (where subtraction corresponds to division). However, the slowness of division compared to multiplication makes this technique unattractive in general. For exponentiation to negative integer powers, on the other hand, since one division is required anyway, an addition-subtraction chain is often beneficial. One such example is &quot;a&quot;−31, where computing 1/&quot;a&quot;31 by a shortest addition chain for &quot;a&quot;31 requires 7 multiplications and one division, whereas the shortest addition-subtraction chain requires 5 multiplications and one division:
:formula_4 (addition-subtraction chain, 5 mults + 1 div).

For exponentiation on elliptic curves, the inverse of a point (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is available at no cost, since it is simply (&quot;x&quot;, −&quot;y&quot;), and therefore addition-subtraction chains are optimal in this context even for positive integer exponents.

<doc id="856360" wikidata="Q220834" url="?curid=856360" title="Joe Eszterhas">
<text>József Antal Eszterhás (; born November 23, 1944), credited as Joe Eszterhas, is a Hungarian-American writer. Born in Hungary, he grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, in the United States. After an early career as a journalist and editor, he entered the film industry. His first screenwriting credit was for the film &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot; (1978). He co-wrote the script for &quot;Flashdance&quot;, which became one of the highest-grossing films of 1983, and set off a lucrative and prolific run for his career. By the early 1990s, he was known as the highest-paid writer in Hollywood, and noted for his work in the erotic thriller genre. He was paid a then-record $3 million for his script &quot;Love Hurts&quot;, which was produced as &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; (1992), and following its success, news outlets reported he earned seven-figure payouts solely on the basis of two-to-four page outlines.

Eszterhas&#x27; screenwriting career experienced a decline over the rest of the decade, with films such as &quot;Showgirls&quot; (1995), &quot;Jade&quot; (1995), and &quot;An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn&quot; (1997) receiving negative reviews and performing poorly at the box office. He mostly withdrew from Hollywood afterward, though he has since authored several books. His publications include &quot;American Rhapsody&quot; (2000), and two volumes of memoirs: &quot;Hollywood Animal&quot; (2004), an autobiography, and &quot;Crossbearer&quot; (2008), which detailed his adulthood return to the Catholic faith he was raised in.

==Personal life==
Eszterhás was born in Csákánydoroszló, a village in Hungary,to Roman Catholic parents Mária (née Bíró) and István Eszterhás. He was born during World War II, and lived as a child in a refugee camp in Allied-occupied Austria. The family later moved to the United States, living first in Pittsburgh before settling in Cleveland in 1950, where Eszterhas was raised. He attended Ohio University. He decided to pursue writing as a career after winning a competition in 1966 sponsored by the William Randolph Hearst Foundation. The prize was awarded at the White House by then-Vice President Hubert Humphrey.

When Eszterhas was 45, he learned that his father had concealed his World War II collaboration in Hungary&#x27;s Arrow Cross Party government after the German occupation of Hungary and that he had &quot;organized book burnings and had produced anti-Semitic propaganda.&quot; Eszterhas later described his father&#x27;s anti-Semitic pamphlets as &quot;like the Hungarian version of &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.&quot; After this discovery, he cut his father out of his life entirely, never reconciling before his father&#x27;s death in 2001. He paid for his father&#x27;s care in later years but was not present at his death, saying in 2024 that &quot;There are moments these many years later that I deeply regret that, and other moments that I&#x27;m proud of myself for not going&quot;.

Eszterhas had a daughter in 1967 who was put up for adoption at birth. They reunited in 1996. Eszterhas had two children with his first wife, Gerri Javor. The couple divorced in 1994 after nearly 24 years of marriage. That year, he married Naomi Baka, a fellow Ohio native, and they had four sons. , Eszterhas lives in the Cleveland suburb of Bainbridge Township, Ohio. After previously living in Malibu, California, he and his wife moved to Bainbridge in 2001, as they felt it provided a better environment to raise their children in. During his first marriage, he was a resident of Tiburon, California.

===Political views===
Eszterhas has described himself as an &quot;independent centrist&quot;, whose votes for president have included Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, Independent Ross Perot, and Republicans George W. Bush and Donald Trump. He is a supporter of Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orbán. He has described himself as a staunch supporter of Israel.

==Journalism==
Eszterhas began his career with a stint at the &quot;Dayton Journal Herald&quot;, before moving to &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; in Cleveland, where he was one of the first reporters to cover the Kent State shootings in 1970. He and fellow &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; journalist Michael Roberts spent the next three months reporting on the story, and their work was published as the book &quot;Thirteen Seconds: Confrontation at Kent State&quot;. Eszterhas later joined the staff of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

One of Eszterhas&#x27; articles for &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; was the subject of a lawsuit. He had covered the aftermath of the collapse of a bridge across the Ohio River. It included a supposed interview of Margaret Cantrell, the widow of one of the fatal victims of the collapse. Months after the accident, he and a photographer visited her home. She was not there at the time, but he talked to the children as the photographer took photos. His Sunday magazine feature focused on the family&#x27;s poverty and contained several inaccuracies. Eszterhas had made it seem as though he had spoken to her, describing her mood and attitude in the story. Cantrell filed suit for invasion of privacy, and won a $60,000 judgment. The decision was overturned in the Court of Appeals on First Amendment grounds but the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the original award. &quot;Cantrell v. Forest City Publishing&quot; (1974) is one of only two false light cases heard by the U.S. Supreme Court.

Eszterhas became a National Book Award nominee for his nonfiction work &quot;Charlie Simpson&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot; in 1974. A studio executive who read the book contacted Eszterhas, telling him that it was &quot;very cinematic&quot; and suggested he could be a screenwriter. This motivated him to change careers and start writing scripts.

==Screenwriter==
Eszterhas&#x27; first produced screenplay was &quot;F.I.S.T.&quot;, directed by Norman Jewison. Eszterhas contributed to the script of 1983&#x27;s &quot;Flashdance&quot;, and wrote the screenplays for &quot;Jagged Edge&quot; and &quot;Betrayed.&quot;

In 1989, Eszterhas planned to leave Creative Artists Agency because an old friend Guy McElwaine was restarting his agency. Michael Ovitz, then the chairman of CAA, threatened to prevent CAA actors from acting in Eszterhas&#x27; future projects. Eszterhas penned a letter to Ovitz blasting him for his tactics. Copies of the letter were circulated around Hollywood and the missive was credited with loosening the stranglehold of power that CAA had on the entertainment industry.

A spec script Eszterhas wrote originally titled &quot;Love Hurts&quot; became the subject of a bidding war amongst various production companies in Hollywood, eventually selling for a then-record $3 million in 1990. The project eventually materialized into &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;, directed by Dutch filmmaker Paul Verhoeven. Released in 1992 to more than $400 million at the box office, &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; and its success led to Eszterhas becoming one of the most sought-after screenwriters at the time. By some reports, he earned a total of $26 million for the scripts he wrote in the 1990s.

The following year, Eszterhas re-teamed with &quot;Basic Instinct&quot; star Sharon Stone for the film &quot;Sliver&quot;. &quot;Sliver&quot; did not replicate the box-office success of the former and was critically derided. Eszterhas next wrote the screenplay for &quot;Showgirls&quot;, his second collaboration with director Verhoeven. &quot;Showgirls&quot;, which debuted in 1995, was seen as a critical and financial disaster, winning the year&#x27;s Golden Raspberry Award for &quot;Worst Screenplay&quot;. Despite the negative press, the film enjoyed cult success in the home video market, generating more than $100 million from video rentals and becoming one of MGM&#x27;s top twenty all-time bestsellers. &quot;Jade&quot;, whose script Eszterhas sold in the wake of &quot;Basic Instinct&quot;&#x27;s success, was released three weeks later to low grosses and negative reviews. The one-two punch of back-to-back box-office bombs in the same year saw Eszterhas&#x27; reputation as the highest-paid screenwriter take a hit.

In 1997, Eszterhas produced two films, both of which he wrote: &quot;Telling Lies in America&quot; and &quot;An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn&quot;. &quot;Burn Hollywood Burn&quot;, which is about a director named Alan Smithee who films a big-budget bomb and then tries to destroy it, flopped at the box office. It won several Golden Raspberry Awards, five of them awarded to Eszterhas himself: Worst Picture (Eszterhas was the film&#x27;s uncredited producer), Worst Screenplay, Worst Original Song, and both Worst New Star and Worst Supporting Actor for a brief on-screen cameo.

The failure of &quot;Burn Hollywood Burn&quot; further affected Eszterhas&#x27; career: none of the screenplays he wrote between 1997 and 2006 were produced. However, &quot;Children of Glory&quot;, a Hungarian language film based upon his screenplay, was released in 2006. The film focuses upon both the 1956 Hungarian Revolution and the Blood in the Water match at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics. &quot;Children of Glory&quot; was entered by invitation in the official section of the 2007 Berlin Film Festival.

===Feud with Mel Gibson===
In 2011, it was announced actor-director Mel Gibson had commissioned Eszterhas to write a screenplay: a historical biopic on Judah and the Maccabees, titled &quot;M.C.K.B.I.&quot; The film was to be distributed by Warner Bros. The announcement generated controversy. In a 2008 interview, Eszterhas wrote that &quot;Mel shared the mind-set of Adolf Hitler.&quot;

In a February 2012 interview with Andrew Goldman of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Goldman said to Eszterhas: &quot;[Gibson&#x27;s] film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot; was widely considered anti-Semitic. Then, during a 2006 arrest for drunken driving, he ranted that &#x27;the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.&#x27; Is he the right director [for the film about Judah Maccabee]?&quot; Eszterhas replied: &quot;Adam Fogelson, Universal Pictures&#x27; chairman, said to [Gibson], &#x27;Why do you want to do this story?&#x27; Mel said, &#x27;Because I think I should.&#x27; I liked that answer very much.&quot; When asked about their shared Catholic faith, Eszterhas said of Gibson, &quot;In my mind, his Catholicism is a figment of his imagination.&quot;

By April 2012, Warner Bros. had canceled the Maccabee project; the film&#x27;s last draft was dated February 20, 2012. Eszterhas claimed the break was caused by Gibson&#x27;s violent outbursts and anti-Semitism, while Gibson blamed a bad script. Eszterhas later wrote a book, &quot;Heaven and Mel&quot;, about his experiences working with Gibson.

==Other works==
Eszterhas has written several best-selling books, including &quot;Hollywood Animal&quot;, an autobiography about politics in Hollywood, which superimposes his life as a young immigrant in the United States on his life as a powerful Hollywood player. His book &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Guide to Hollywood&quot; was published in September 2006.

His book &quot;Crossbearer: A Memoir of Faith&quot; was published in 2008. It tells the story of his return to the Roman Catholic Church and his new-found devotion to God and family after surviving a throat cancer diagnosis in 2001. Eszterhas admitted smoking four packs of Salem Light cigarettes a day, as well as drinking heavily. He underwent surgery to remove 80% of his larynx, and had a trachea fitted. In 2002, he publicly apologized for glamorizing smoking in his films, making this apology in part due his own cancer diagnosis and feeling guilty afterwards.

Eszterhas wrote a book about his experiences with Mel Gibson and anti-Semitism, titled &quot;Heaven and Mel&quot;, wherein he portrays Gibson as a man fueled only by hatred, prone to violent outbursts. Among many damning statements is Eszterhas&#x27; claim that while staying at Gibson&#x27;s Costa Rican estate to work on a script, he became so afraid that he slept with a golf club in his hand.

<doc id="856364" wikidata="Q304371" url="?curid=856364" title="Abaco Islands">
<text>The Abaco Islands lie in the north of The Bahamas, about 193 miles (167.7 nautical miles or 310.6 km) east of Miami, Florida, US. The main islands are Great Abaco and Little Abaco, which is just west of Great Abaco&#x27;s northern tip. 

There are several smaller barrier cays, of which the northernmost are Walker&#x27;s Cay and its sister island Grand Cay. To the south, the next inhabited islands are Spanish Cay and Green Turtle Cay, with its settlement of New Plymouth, Great Guana Cay, private Scotland Cay, Man-O-War Cay and Elbow Cay, with its settlement of Hope Town. Southernmost are Tilloo Cay and Lubbers Quarters. Also off Abaco&#x27;s western shore is Gorda Cay, a Disney-owned island and cruise ship stop renamed Castaway Cay. Also in the vicinity is Moore&#x27;s Island. 

On the Big Island of Abaco is Marsh Harbour, the Abacos&#x27; commercial hub and The Bahamas&#x27; third-largest city, plus the resort area of Treasure Cay. Both have airports. Mainland settlements include Coopers Town and Fox Town in the north and Cherokee and Sandy Point in the south. 

Administratively, the Abaco Islands constitute seven of the 31 Local Government Districts of The Bahamas: Grand Cay, North Abaco, Green Turtle Cay, Central Abaco, South Abaco, Moore&#x27;s Island and Hope Town.

==Geography==
The Abaco Islands consist of limestone, with some elevation, and are protected on the Atlantic-facing sides by the third-largest barrier reef in the world. The cays are primarily made up of tidal mangrove swamps, as well as white-sand beaches. Most of the islands are uninhabited. The Abaco Islands and their associated cays are the Out Islands, Family Islands, and Friendly Islands.

==History==
The Abaco Islands were first inhabited by the Lucayans, who called the Abaco Islands &quot;Lucayoneque&quot;, meaning &quot;the people’s distant waters&quot;. The first European settlers of the islands were Loyalists fleeing the American War of Independence who arrived in 1783, as was also the Cat Island case. These original Loyalist settlers made a modest living by salvaging wrecks, by building small wooden boats, and basic farming.

=== Pre-Columbian and Spanish eras ===
The Lucayans were the first people to inhabit the Abaco Islands. They were a branch of the Taínos who inhabited most of the Caribbean islands at the time. The Lucayans were the first inhabitants of the Americas encountered by Christopher Columbus. The Spanish started seizing Lucayans as slaves within a few years of Columbus&#x27;s arrival, and they had all been removed from the Bahamas by 1520. After the extermination of the Lucayans, there were no known permanent settlements in the Bahamas for approximately 130 years.

Spain laid claim to the Bahamas after Columbus discovered the islands but showed little interest in them. The Italian explorer Amerigo Vespucci spent four months exploring the Bahamas in 1499–1500. Juan de la Cosa&#x27;s first map of the New World, printed in 1500, shows the Abaco Islands with the name Habacoa. The Peter Martyr map, in the first edition of &quot;De Orbe Novo&quot; in 1511, shows the Bahamas&#x27; islands but does not name them. The Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León landed on Abaco in 1513. The Turin map of 1523 clearly shows Abaco, then named Iucayonique. The Turin map remained the most accurate map of the area until the Bahamas&#x27; first English maps were produced. Both John White&#x27;s map of 1590 and Thomas Hood&#x27;s map of 1592 show the islands, as did a map produced in 1630 by the Dutchman de Laet. At this time, the Spanish empire in the Caribbean was focused on Havana. Spain regarded the depopulated Bahamas as unprofitable and treacherous to navigate;- in 1593, a Spanish fleet of 17 ships wrecked off the Abaco. Also, English and French pirates and freebooters had begun preying on Spanish vessels north of Cuba. A Spanish ordinance of 1561 forbade any merchant ship to enter the Bahamas without an escort. Ownership of the Bahamas passed back and forth between Spain and Great Britain for 150 years. A treaty was established in 1783 by Great Britain. Great Britain ceded East Florida to Spain, receiving the Bahamas in return.

=== British colonial era ===
In 1783, a call for those wishing to help settle Abaco was published in the Royal Gazette in New York City. About 1500 Loyalists left New York and moved to Abaco in August 1783. The Loyalists settled on a small sandy harbor about six leagues north of Marsh Harbour near modern-day Treasure Cay. They planned and built the town of Carleton, named after Sir Guy Carleton. Disputes over food distribution and misinformation about the resources available led some of these settlers to found a rival town near Marsh Harbour called Maxwell. The conflict between disgruntled settlers and the officials responsible became a constant life feature on the islands. Sea island cotton was sown by the settlers in 1785, and although both 1786 and 1787 produced good crops, the 1788 crop was blighted by caterpillars. Other settlements on the islands were Green Turtle Cay, Man-o-War Cay, and Sandy Point. In the 1790s, a group of Loyalists from the Carolinas arrived on the islands via Florida, founding the isolated settlement of Cherokee Sound.
===Abaco &amp; the &#x27;Nassau&#x27; Slave Revolt===
Two slave ships from the United States, The Encomium and the Comet, wrecked off the coast of Abaco in December 1830 and 1834 respectively. The customs officers of Nassau seized the 165 slaves from the Comet and the 48 slaves from the Encomium, freeing them despite the protests of the crew. A later indemnity passed hands between the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States in 1855.

The Hermosa, another slave ship, wrecked in Abaco in 1840. The slaves aboard were unilaterally emancipated by the Bahamians involved. These situations influenced the later revolt led by Madison Washington.

===Early 1970s===
In June 1971, the Prime Minister of The Bahamas, Lynden Pindling, announced his government&#x27;s independence from Britain. On Abaco, the Greater Abaco Council formed to lobby for continued British rule. In July 1971, the Greater Abaco Council submitted a petition to the Queen asking that Abaco become a &#x27;completely self-contained and fully self-supporting&#x27; territory under British jurisdiction. In August 1971, the British government refused to consider the petition. The September 1972 general election in The Bahamas showed a clear majority for independence across the country.

However, on Abaco, the results were less clear-cut; the pro-independence Progressive Liberal Party won one of Abaco&#x27;s two seats by a small majority and, by comparison, the Free National Movement (which opposed early independence) won the other chair by a large majority. Starting in December 1971, all-party talks took place in London, to draft a new constitution for The Bahamas. The Greater Abaco Council sent their representatives to London for a &#x27;collateral conference&#x27; to run alongside the official talks. The British refused to consider granting Abaco independence (secession) from the rest of The Bahamas. The GAC accepted this, and the group ceased activity at the end of 1972.

Shortly afterward, Errington Watkins, the Free National Movement representative for the Abaco-Marsh Harbour seat, formed a successor group called the Council for a Free Abaco. A second petition was organized and signed by half of the registered voters on the island. Errington Watkins took this petition to London in May 1973, hoping to influence The Bahamas Independence Order, then-debated in the British Parliament. A sympathetic MP, Ronald Bell, introduced an amendment that would have excluded Abaco from an independent Bahamas and have the islands remain a British colony. Defeated in the House of Commons and The Bahamas Independence Order, this amendment was approved on 22 May 1973. Three weeks later, a similar motion on Abaco was defeated in the House of Lords.

A last-ditch attempt by Errington Watkins to pass a resolution in The Bahamas House of Assembly calling for a United Nations-supervised referendum on Abaco was easily defeated in June 1973, and The Bahamas became independent on 10 July 1973.

===Abaco Independence Movement and onward===

In August 1973, shortly after The Bahamas became independent, the Abaco Independence Movement was formed as a political party whose stated aim was self-determination for Abaco within a federal Bahamas. Chuck Hall and Bert Williams created AIM. They sought support from the US Libertarian Party and an American financier named Michael Oliver, who through his libertarian Phoenix Foundation agreed to support AIM financially. Mitchell WerBell, an American arms dealer and mercenary, also supported AIM. His talk of an armed insurrection and attempts to recruit mercenaries to go to Abaco greatly discredited AIM. The Progressive Liberal Party victory in the 1977 general election effectively marked the end of the movement.

===Hurricane Dorian===

On 1 September 2019, Hurricane Dorian made landfall on Elbow Cay in the Abaco Islands at 16:40 UTC with winds of and wind gusts up to , tying Dorian with the 1935 Labor Day hurricane as the strongest landfalling Atlantic hurricane on record. There are reports of major damage throughout the islands which has been described as &quot;catastrophic damage&quot; and &quot;pure hell&quot;.

Hurricane Dorian caused 87 percent of the damage in the Abaco Islands. 75 percent of the island&#x27;s homes were damaged or destroyed. The total cost of Hurricane Dorian&#x27;s impacts and effects on The Bahamas was $3.4 billion. As of October 18, 2019, there were 67 confirmed deaths as a result of Hurricane Dorian, with 282 people still missing. The damage also impacted the homes and assets of another 29,472 people. Hurricane Dorian wreaked havoc on Grand Bahama and Abaco, with damaging winds and storm surges, as well as the island of New Providence. The $3.4 billion in damages, losses, and additional costs were split as follows: 72 percent damage, 21 percent losses, and 7% additional costs, with the private sector absorbing nearly 90 percent of total losses. Abaco was responsible for 87% of the losses and 76% of the damage.

==Demographics==
The combined population of the islands was about 17,224 , and the principal settlement and capital is Marsh Harbour.

In addition to Marsh Harbour there are several other settlements on Great Abaco including Cherokee Sound, Coopers Town, Crossing Rock, Green Turtle Cay, Hope Town, Little Harbour, Rocky Point, Sandy Point, Spring City, Treasure Cay, Wilson City, and Winding Bay.

Surrounding Great Abaco are several smaller islands known as cays, many of which are popular with tourists visiting the islands. A few notable cays include Castaway Cay (formerly Gorda Cay), Elbow Cay, the Grand Cays, Great Guana Cay, Green Turtle Cay, Man-O-War Cay, Moore&#x27;s Island, Tilloo Cay, and Walker&#x27;s Cay.

==Activities==
The Bahamas National Trust maintains six national parks in the Abacos Islands. These are:
* Pelican Cays Land and Sea Park
* Abaco National Park
* Black Sound Cay National Reserve
* Walker&#x27;s Cay National Park
* Tilloo Cay National Reserve
* Fowl Cays National Park

The Great Abaco Family Fitness Weekend takes place every March in Treasure Cay, attracting both domestic and international tourism. The events include an open water swim, sprint and Olympic triathlons, a children&#x27;s race, and a 5k/10k fun run/walk. The Abaco Club features an 18 hole championship golf course, designed by Donald Steel and Tom Mackenzie, which is home to Great Abaco Classic.

Fishing, diving, snorkeling, and boating are available in the Abacos. Green Turtle Cay has an interactive Bahamas Pig Tour and Hope Town has a historic lighthouse. Restaurants and bars serving Bahamian food can be found in the hotels on Abaco Island.

==Transportation==
Marsh Harbour Airport (MHH) and Treasure Cay Airport (TCB) serve the needs of the Abacos, and all Abaco travel connects or originates in Florida or Atlanta. On the main island cars and boat rentals are available. On some of the cays, rental golf carts and boats are the main mode of transportation, along with bikes or scooters. Marsh Harbour Airport was the site of a plane crash on 25 August 2001, that claimed the lives of nine passengers, among them R&amp;B singer Aaliyah.

The cays can be reached by ferries. The southern cays can be reached from Marsh Harbour and another ferry leaves from the Treasure Cay ferry dock about a half-hour from Marsh Harbour by road. Ferry service is also to be found between Nassau and Sandy Point on the southern end of Great Abaco on weekends.

===Sandy Point===
Sandy Point is a small settlement at the tip of southwest Abaco, Bahamas. It is the location of &quot;Sandy Point Airport&quot;, which has yet to serve any regular scheduled carrier, and a new police station. Sandy Point also has a few shops, some churches and a few bonefish lodges. The annual &quot;Homecoming and Conch Fest&quot; is held around Bahamian Labour Day, the first Friday in June.
In the 1990s, The Walt Disney Company bought Gorda Cay and renamed it &quot;Castaway Island&quot; and made it a stop on their &quot;Island in the Sun&quot; cruise ship offering. Many Disney employees live in Sandy Point. There is no public access for tourists from shore. Also off shore and a little more to the north, lies Moore&#x27;s Island. It has two settlements &quot;Hard Bargain&quot; and &quot;The Bight&quot;. Hole-in-the-Wall, which is the site of a lighthouse, may seem nearby but should be a trip unto itself and only in a 4-wheel-drive vehicle when coming from Marsh Harbour.

==Economy==
The Abaco Islands have been long famous for shipbuilding. Their chief exports are lumber, fruit, and pearl shells. Crawfish (Caribbean spiny lobster) are exported to the United States. Pulpwood is shipped to a Florida plant for processing. Tourism is a major portion of the economy.

Tourism has grown to the 300,000 visitors mark in 2019. This growth makes the Abacos the second most visited destination in The Bahamas. The reason for the recent increase in tourism is because of the waters. Boating, swimming, and fishing are popular activities in the islands and cays that make up the Abaco archipelago, which have hosted fishing tournaments and regattas. The real estate sector has grown due to the growing tourism; Elbow Caw saw the most activity in 2018.

==Environment==
The Abaco Islands boast important natural areas, especially important coral reef areas, barrier-island terrestrial habitats and large forests of Bahamian pine (&quot;Pinus caribaea&quot; var. &quot;bahamensis&quot;), some of which still contain old-growth trees. As development expands in the Abacos, local groups have begun to fight for the preservation of their natural resources, such as in the development case on Great Guana Cay.

Species of birds include the Bahamian subspecies of Cuban amazon (&quot;Amazona leucocephala bahamensis&quot;), which exists only in Cuba, the Cayman Islands, the southern Bahamas and Abaco. This population is unique in that it nests in limestone solution cavities rather than tree cavities. Abaco is also known for its intact elkhorn and staghorn coral structures, and for a breed of feral horse, the Abaco Barb, which became extinct in 2015.

==Notable people==
* Thomas Winer Malone, boat builder
* Steven Gardiner, sprint athlete and Olympic medalist
* Shavez Hart, sprint athlete and Olympian
* Elroy McBride, sprint athlete who competed at the World Championships

<text>The Gloucester Hill Battle Monument (, literally &quot;British Army&#x27;s Seolmari Battle Monument in Paju&quot;) or Gloucester Memorial is a memorial in South Korea that commemorates the actions of the Gloucestershire Regiment and C Troop, 170th Mortar Battery, Royal Artillery, of the British Army during the Battle of the Imjin River in 1951.

== Hill 235 ==
Hill 235, where the 1st Battalion, the Gloucestershire Regiment (the Glorious Glosters) was ordered to &quot;Hold on where you are&quot;, is remembered as &quot;Gloster Hill&quot;. The hill is south of the Imjin River and west of the Seolmacheon stream at in Jeokseong-myeon, Paju City, Gyeonggi-do Province, South Korea.

== Memorial ==
The memorial stands at the foot of Gloucester Hill beside the Seolmacheon stream, the initial location of the Gloucestershire Regiment&#x27;s headquarters during the battle at Imjin River. It was built by units of the British and South Korean armed forces as a memorial to the Gloucestershire Regiment and C Troop, 170th Mortar Battery, Royal Artillery.

The British Embassy in Seoul organises services for veterans on every anniversary of the battle, in April. Information on and artifacts from the battle are held by the Soldiers of Gloucestershire Museum in Gloucester, England.

The memorial was first unveiled on 29 June 1957. The memorial park was expanded and reopened in 2014. There is a memorial garden on the east side of the stream containing a large sculpture of the Gloucester&#x27;s beret, a set of life sized Gloucester soldiers patrolling away from the Imjin River and a memorial wall. The stream is crossed by Gloucester Bridge and a path leads round to a flight of steps that takes you to the memorial stones set into a wall built into the side of the hill.

Four plaques on the original memorial still show the crest of the United Nations, the badges of the Gloucestershire Regiment and of the Royal Artillery, plus inscriptions in English and Korean which read:

This is a popular park for local Koreans. According to Lee In-jae, the mayor of Paju who raised money among local citizens to expand the park, &quot;Freedom is not freeit is earned with blood&quot;.

1.7 kilometers away from the memorial and situated on Gamak mountain is a rope bridge known as The Gloucester Heroes Bridge. The insignia of the regiment is also on a marble effect wall towards the beginning/end of the bridge, depending on which side the walk is started.

<text>1221 Amor is an asteroid and near-Earth object on an eccentric orbit, approximately in diameter. It is the namesake of the Amor asteroids, the second-largest subgroup of near-Earth objects. It was discovered by Eugène Delporte at the Uccle Observatory in 1932, the first time that an asteroid was seen to approach Earth so closely. The assumed S-type asteroid is one of few low-numbered asteroids for which no rotation period has been determined. It was assigned the provisional designation &quot;&quot; and named for Cupid, also known as &quot;Amor&quot; in Latin, the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Eros.

== Discovery ==

On 12 March 1932, Belgian astronomer Eugène Delporte photographed &quot;Amor&quot; at the Royal Observatory of Belgium in Uccle, as it approached Earth to within 16 million kilometers (about 40 times the distance from Earth to the Moon). This was the first time that an asteroid was seen to approach Earth so closely. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins with its official discovery observation on 12 March 1932, when it was observed at the Uccle and Heidelberg observatories simultaneously.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Amor&quot; is the namesake of the Amor asteroid, a subgroup of near-Earth asteroids that approach the orbit of Earth from beyond, but do not cross it. Next to the Apollo group, the Amors are the second largest group of near-Earth objects with more than 7,000 known members. As with many members of this group, &quot;Amor&quot; is also a Mars-crosser, crossing the orbit of the Red Planet at 1.66 AU.

It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.08–2.76 AU once every 2 years and 8 months (971 days; semi-major axis of 1.92 AU). Its orbit has a high eccentricity of 0.44 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the ecliptic.

=== Close encounters ===

&quot;Amor&quot; has an Earth minimum orbital intersection distance of which corresponds to 41.6 lunar distances. In March 1940, it approached Earth to , its closest approach of all close encounters since 1900. Only in March 2129, it will approach Earth at a similar distance of .

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after the Roman god of love, Cupid, also known as Amor in Latin, and the Roman equivalent of the Greek god Eros. The near-Earth asteroids 433 Eros and 763 Cupido are also named after the god of love. The official naming citation was mentioned in &quot;The Names of the Minor Planets&quot; by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

== Physical characteristics ==

&quot;Amor&quot; is an assumed, stony S-type asteroid.

=== Rotation period ===

As of 2018, no rotational lightcurve of &quot;Amor&quot; has been obtained from photometric observations. The body&#x27;s rotation period, pole and shape remain unknown.

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to Tom Gehrels publication &quot;Hazards due to Comets and Asteroids&quot; from 1994 (pp. 540–543), &quot;Amor&quot; measures 1.0 kilometer in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.15. The &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 0.857 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 17.7.

<text>An Earth-crosser is a near-Earth asteroid whose orbit crosses that of Earth as observed from the ecliptic pole of Earth&#x27;s orbit. The known numbered Earth-crossers are listed here. Those Earth-crossers whose semi-major axes are smaller than Earth&#x27;s are Aten asteroids; the remaining ones are Apollo asteroids. &quot;(See also the Amor asteroids.)&quot;

An asteroid with an Earth-crossing orbit is not necessarily in danger of colliding with Earth. The orbit of an Earth-crossing asteroid may not even intersect with that of Earth. This apparent contradiction arises because many asteroids have highly inclined orbits, so although they may have a perihelion less than that of Earth, their paths can never cross. An asteroid for which there is some possibility of a collision with Earth at a future date and which is above a certain size is classified as a potentially hazardous asteroid (PHA). Specifically, an asteroid is a PHA if its Earth minimum orbital intersection distance (MOID) is &lt;0.05 AU and its absolute magnitude is 22 or brighter. The concept of PHA is intended to replace the now abandoned strict definition of ECA (Earth-crossing asteroid) which existed for a few years. Determining if an asteroid was an ECA required calculation of its orbits millennia into the future, including planetary gravitational perturbations, to assess whether a collision with Earth was possible and this has proved to be impractical.

Having a small MOID is not a guarantee of a collision. On the other hand, small gravitational perturbations of the asteroid around its orbit from planets that it passes can significantly alter its path. For instance, 99942 Apophis will approach Earth so closely in 2029 that it will get under the orbit of the Earth&#x27;s geostationary satellites.

Of the Earth-crossing asteroids, 3753 Cruithne is notable for having an orbit that has the same period as Earth&#x27;s.

<text>Jean-Christian Michel (born 1938) is a composer and clarinetist. His compositions are influenced by jazz and by baroque music, particularly that of Johann Sebastian Bach.
Before starting his musical career, Jean-Christian Michel was a doctor, as a surgeon.

His first record &quot;Requiem&quot; was released in 1966. He founded the ensemble &quot;Quatuor avec Orgue&quot;.
Michel has received 3 diamond discs, 7 platinum discs and 10 golden discs. With more than five million discs sold, (3 discs classified 1, 2 &amp; 3 in the charts of CIDD-France soir in the seventies); and thousands of concerts to his credit, he today pursues a global career. Michel is a &quot;Full Member&quot; of the SACEM (an association of composers and music publishers to protect copyright and royalties). He received the prize for &quot;Sciences and Culture&quot; at Sorbonne, Paris, France, which was awarded by a jury of six Nobel Prize winners. Jean-Christian Michel is currently the godfather of the campaign Neurodon, within the Federation for Brain Research FRC Drummer Kenny Clarke played and recorded with Michel for 10 years.
Michel is also a very experienced mountain climber. He was a member of the group that made the first-ever ascent of Tawesche, in the Himalayas, in 1974.

<text>USS &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; (LCC/JCC 20) is one of two amphibious command ships of the United States Navy and is the flagship and command ship of the United States Sixth Fleet. USS &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; also serves as the Afloat Command Platform (ACP) of Naval Striking and Support Forces NATO (STRIKFORNATO). The ship had previously served for years as the COMSTRIKFLTLANT(NATO Designation) / US Second Fleet&#x27;s command ship. She is one of only a few commissioned ships to be assigned to Military Sealift Command.

&quot;Mount Whitney&quot; was classified as LCC-20 on 1 January 1969, and her keel was laid down on 8 January by Newport News Shipbuilding &amp; Drydock Company, Newport News, Virginia.

At the time of her commissioning, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; joined her sister ship &quot;Blue Ridge&quot; as having the distinction of carrying the world&#x27;s most sophisticated electronics suites. It was said to be some thirty percent larger than that of the aircraft carrier , which had been the most complex. &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; was armed with a &quot;main battery&quot; of computers, communications gear, and other electronic facilities to fulfill her mission as a command ship. An extremely refined communications system was also an integral part of the ship&#x27;s radical new design. Through an automated patch panel and computer-controlled switching matrix, her crew could use any combination of communication equipment desired. The clean topside area is the result of careful design intended to minimize the ship&#x27;s interference with her own communications system. US Navy long-range communications were heavily reliant on high-frequency radio systems in the 1970s and have evolved to predominantly satellite communications in the 2000s. This is illustrated by the long wire antennas and the directional HF yagi or log-periodic antenna initially installed on &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; and later removed and replaced with a number of satellite communications antennas.

== Ship&#x27;s name ==
The ship is named for Mount Whitney, a peak in the Sierra Nevada mountain range of California. Mount Whitney is the highest summit in the contiguous United States, with an elevation of .

== Capability ==
&quot;Mount Whitney&quot; is the most sophisticated Command, Control, Communications, Computer, and Intelligence (C4I) ship ever commissioned, She incorporates various elements of the most advanced C4I equipment and gives the embarked Joint Task Force Commander the capability to effectively command all units under their command.

&quot;Mount Whitney&quot; can transmit and receive large amounts of secure data to and from any point on earth through HF, VHF, UHF, and SHF (satellite) communications channels. This electronic technology enables the Joint Intelligence Center and Joint Operations Center to provide the most timely intelligence and operational support available in the Navy.

== Ship history ==
===1970s and 1980s=== 
From 1971 to 2005, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; served as the flagship for Commander Second Fleet/Commander Striking Fleet Atlantic.

===1990s===
In 1994, during the FleetEx 2/94 &quot;George Washington&quot; war game exercise, the Argentine Navy, acting as the enemy and using the diesel submarine , went undetected, penetrated the destroyer defense and &quot;sank&quot; &quot;Mount Whitney&quot;, which was acting as the command ship during the exercise.

&quot;Mount Whitney&quot; deployed in 1994 to Haiti with Lieutenant General Hugh Shelton, the commander of the XVIII Airborne Corps, in command of the Joint Task Force that conducted Operation Uphold Democracy.

===2000s===

On 12 November 2002, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; deployed to the Central Command area of responsibility in support of Operation Enduring Freedom. She was acting as the initial command post for Combined Joint Task Force – Horn of Africa. During the deployment, the ship embarked elements of the 2nd Marine Division and II Marine Expeditionary Force (II MEF), based at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina, under the command of Major General John F. Sattler and Captain Morton W. Kenyon.

In 2004, Military Sealift Command civilian sailors were integrated into her crew. She remains a commissioned warship in the United States Navy, but the size of her crew was reduced from about 600 sailors to about 170 Navy officers and enlisted personnel and 155 civilians.

In February 2005, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; left Norfolk for Gaeta, Italy where she was redesignated (LCC/JCC 20) and assumed duties as the 6th Fleet flagship, officially relieving . She also assumed duties as the command ship for the Commander, Joint Command Lisbon and the Commander, Striking Force NATO.

In August 2008, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; was deployed to the Black Sea in support of Operation Assured Delivery to deliver humanitarian aid to those affected by the Russo-Georgian War and became the first NATO ship to deliver aid to port of Poti, Georgia.

On 6 November 2008, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; was unable to enter the port at Sevastopol. City authorities and representatives of the Ukrainian Navy refused to comment on the event. Individuals working for the city administration reported that the failure was due to issues with &quot;Mount Whitney&quot;″s border crossing documents, while others suggested anti-NATO protests were the cause.

===2010s===

From 19 March 2011, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; served in the Mediterranean as the main command vessel for the enforcement of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973 against Libya. She was the flagship for Admiral Samuel J. Locklear, who had tactical command of the Operation Odyssey Dawn joint task force. The vessel was serving as a command-and-control vessel for the United States&#x27; involvement in the coalition campaign aimed to enforce a Libya no-fly zone and prevent Muammar Gaddafi&#x27;s forces from attacking the rebel stronghold of Benghazi.
In February 2013, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; transferred to the San Giorgio del Porto Shipyard in Genoa, Italy for a major 60-day overhaul and repair project. The ship returned to active duty in April 2013 at the end of the maintenance window.

On 31 January 2014, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; left her homeport of Gaeta, Italy. &quot;Mount Whitney&quot;, along with , were the first two US Navy ships to operate in the Black Sea during the Sochi Olympics.

On 31 July 2015, a fire broke out aboard &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; while she was in Viktor Lenac Shipyard, Rijeka, Croatia. There were no reported injuries, and the fire was extinguished within 45 minutes by ship&#x27;s crew and shipyard fire brigade personnel. &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; had been in Viktor Lenac Shipyard since January 2015 undergoing a scheduled maintenance overhaul designed to extend the service life of the ship to 2039.

On 30 June 2016, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; visited Klaipėda, Lithuania, and in October 2016, she visited Souda Bay, Greece.

From early 2017 through to October 2017, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; was at the Viktor Lenac Shipyard; Rijeka, Croatia, for further upgrades to its information technology infrastructure, and various engineering refurbishments.

In September 2018, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; visited Thessaloniki, Greece, for the 83rd Thessaloniki International Fair, where the US was the country of honor. From 25 October to 7 November 2018, she served as the command vessel for the NATO exercise Trident Juncture.

===2020s===
In April 2022, the Combined Maritime Forces command, a 34-nation organization based in Bahrain, has added a new task force led by &quot;Mount Whitney&quot;. There are three task forces that handle piracy and security issues both inside and outside of the Persian Gulf. The new task force of two to eight ships at a time would target those smuggling coal, drugs, weapons, and people in the waterway. In late May 2022, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; was operating in the Baltic Sea, ahead of naval exercise BALTOPS 2022.
The ship is currently stationed in Gaeta, Italy.

On 18 October 2023, &quot;Mount Whitney&quot; deployed from Gaeta with the Commander 6th fleet, Vice Adm. Thomas Ishee, and his staff, onboard &quot;in support of U.S. operations&quot; in the eastern Mediterranean Sea in waters off the 2023 Israel–Hamas war. This added to new deployments by the aircraft carrier strike group and , and carrying the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit, joining the strike group.

<doc id="856411" wikidata="Q1324307" url="?curid=856411" title="Marshal General of France">
<text>Marshal General of France, originally &quot;Marshal General of the King&#x27;s camps and armies&quot; (), was a title given to signify that the recipient had authority over all of the French armies, in the days when a Marshal of France usually governed only one army. 

This title was bestowed only on Marshals of France, usually when the title of Constable of France was unavailable or, after 1626, suppressed. Unlike the title of marshal, marshal general was rarely granted to active military commanders. Rather, especially in the 18th and 19th centuries, it was an end-of-career reward for particularly deserving or loyal marshals.

== List of titleholders ==



Six in the pre-revolutionary kingdom of France:
* Charles de Gontaut, duc de Biron (1562–1602):
** Admiral of France, 1592
** Admiral and Marshal, 26 January 1594
** unclear when promoted to Marshal General
** executed in 1602
* François de Bonne, duc de Lesdiguières (1543–1626):
** Marshal, 27 September 1609
** Marshal General, 30 March 1621
** Constable of France, 6 July 1622
* Henri de La Tour d&#x27;Auvergne, vicomte de Turenne (1611–1675):
** Marshal, 16 November 1643
** Marshal General, 4 April 1660
* Claude-Louis-Hector de Villars (1653–1734):
** Marshal, 20 October 1702
** Marshal General, 18 October 1733
* Maurice, comte de Saxe (1696–1750):
** Marshal, 26 March 1744
** Marshal General, 12 January 1747

* Victor François de Broglie, 2nd Duke of Broglie (1718–1804):
** Marshal, 1759
** Marshal General, 1789
** Broglie emigrated the same day the king signed the title papers. He therefore never exercised the functions of marshal general and was removed from the list of marshals of France in 1792.

One during the July Monarchy under the House of Orléans&#x27; sole, constitutional king, Louis Philippe:
* Jean-de-Dieu Soult, &quot;duc de Dalmatie&quot; (1769–1851):
** Marshal of the Empire, 19 May 1804
** Marshal General, 15 September 1847

<text>Karl Theodore Francis Bitter (December 6, 1867 – April 9, 1915) was an Austrian-born American sculptor best known for his architectural sculpture, memorials and residential work.

==Life and career==
The son of Carl and Henrietta Bitter, he was born in the municipal district Rudolfsheim-Fünfhaus of Vienna. His early training took place at the Vienna &quot;Kunstgewerbeschule&quot; (the imperial school for the applied arts), and after that at the &quot;Kunstakademie&quot; (the Academy of Fine Arts). At the Academy, he studied with August Kühne and Edmund Heller. Upon his graduation, he was apprenticed to an architectural sculptor, . This was the period that the &quot;Ringstraße&quot; was being built in Vienna, and a large number of decorated buildings were being built.

He was drafted into the Austrian Army, and deserted while on leave. He was unable to return to Austria for many years because of his desertion. He later was pardoned by Emperor Franz Josef of Austria, who hoped to lure the famous sculptor back to Vienna.

Bitter immigrated to the United States in 1889, arriving in New York City. He applied for citizenship, and set to work as an assistant with a firm of Ellin, Kitson &amp; Co. (&quot;The Founder of American Architectural Decoration,&quot; &quot;Stone&quot; volume XXIV, no. 4. (Apr. 1902): pp. 343–345.) While employed with this firm, at age 21, he competed for the Astor memorial bronze gates of Trinity Church and won. The work gave him sufficient capital to build and establish a small studio on 13th Street.

Bitter modeled seated statues of Thomas Jefferson and Alexander Hamilton to flank the entrance to the Cuyahoga County Courthouse in Cleveland, Ohio (1909–11). He portrayed the men in early middle age, as in the 1780s when they clashed over what kind of nation the United States should become. Missouri commissioned a copy of Jefferson (1913), and Bitter made minor alterations to portray Jefferson as he looked as president when he signed the Louisiana Purchase Treaty in 1803. For the commission from the University of Virginia, Bitter aged Jefferson further, portraying him as he looked in retirement.

About this time, Bitter was discovered by Richard Morris Hunt, the architect of choice of many of New York&#x27;s rich and famous. From that time on Bitter was never without work. After working as a sculptor at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago in 1893 and as director at the Pan-American Exposition in Buffalo, New York in 1901, Bitter&#x27;s extraordinary organizational skills led him to be named head of the sculpture programs at both the 1904 St. Louis Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri, where Lee Lawrie trained with his guidance, and the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition held in San Francisco, California. In 1906/1907, he presided over the National Sculpture Society.

Among the awards won by Bitter were the silver medal of the Paris Exposition, 1900; the gold medal of the Pan-American Exposition, 1901; a gold medal at Philadelphia, 1902; and the gold medal at the St. Louis Exposition, 1904. He was a member of the National Institute of Arts and Sciences, vice-president (1906–08 and 1914–15); the National Academy of Design, to which he was elected in 1902; the American Academy of Arts and Letters, Players&#x27; Club, Century Club, and vice-president of the Architectural League from 1904 to 1906 and from 1909 to 1911, and member of the Art Commission, New York, from 1912 to 1915.

Although Bitter arose out of the Classical/Naturalist styles he was increasingly turning towards a more modern approach to sculpture. Much of the work in Buffalo and St. Louis was allegorical in nature. Where this would have taken him will never be known, because he was killed in a traffic collision in 1915 when, while leaving the Metropolitan Opera in New York, the driver of a car jumped the curb on Broadway and struck him down. His wife survived the crash as he had pushed her out of the way of the oncoming driver.

Like many of the sculptors and painters of the day, Bitter frequently employed the services of the muse and history&#x27;s first &quot;super model&quot;, Audrey Munson. On June 30, 1901, he married Marie A. Schevill, of Cincinnati, Ohio. They had three children: Francis T. R. Bitter, Marietta C. E. Bitter and John F. Bitter. Their son Francis Bitter, born in 1902, became a prominent American physicist.

For a time, Bitter&#x27;s studio was located in a building known as The Castle in Weehawken, New Jersey. The Castle was created as a part of the Eldorado Amusement Park.

<doc id="856432" wikidata="Q1877948" url="?curid=856432" title="Appliance classes">
<text>Appliance classes (also known as protection classes) specify measures to prevent dangerous contact voltages on unenergized parts, such as the metallic casing, of an electronic device. In the electrical appliance manufacturing industry, the following appliance classes are defined in IEC 61140 and used to differentiate between the protective-earth connection requirements of devices. 

==Class 0==
These appliances have no protective-earth connection and feature only a single level of insulation between live parts and exposed metalwork. If permitted at all, Class 0 items are intended for use in dry areas only. A single fault could cause an electric shock or other dangerous occurrence, without triggering the automatic operation of any fuse or circuit breaker. Sales of such items have been prohibited in much of the world for safety reasons, for example in the UK by Section 8 of The Low Voltage Electrical Equipment (Safety) Regulations 1989 and New Zealand by the Electricity Act. A typical example of a Class 0 appliance is the old style of Christmas fairy lights. However, equipment of this class is common in some 120V countries, and in much of the 230V developing world, whether permitted officially or not. These appliances do not have their chassis connected to electrical earth. In many countries the plug of a class 0 equipment is such that it cannot be inserted to grounded outlet like Schuko. The failure of such an equipment in a location where there are grounded equipment can cause fatal shock if one touches both. Any Class 1 equipment will act like a Class 0 equipment when connected to an ungrounded outlet.

==Class I==

Appliance class I is not only based on the basic insulation, but the casing and other conductive parts are also connected with a low-resistant earth conductor. Hence, these appliances must have their chassis connected to electrical earth (US: ground) by a separate earth conductor (coloured green/yellow in most countries, green in India, USA, Canada and Japan). The earth connection is achieved with a three-conductor mains cable, typically ending with three-prong AC connector which plugs into a corresponding AC outlet. 

Plugs are designed such that the connection to the protective earth conductor should be the first connection when plugged in. It should also be the last to be broken when the plug is removed.

A fault in the appliance which causes a live conductor to contact the casing will cause a current to flow in the earth conductor. If large enough, this current will trip an over-current device (fuse or circuit breaker [CB]) and disconnect the supply. The disconnection time has to be fast enough not to allow fibrillation to start if a person is in contact with the casing at the time. This time and the current rating in turn sets a maximum earth resistance permissible. To provide supplementary protection against high-impedance faults it is common to recommend a residual-current device (RCD) also known as a residual current circuit breaker (RCCB), ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), or residual current operated circuit-breaker with integral over-current protection (RCBO), which will cut off the supply of electricity to the appliance if the currents in the two poles of the supply are not equal and opposite.

==Class 0I==
Electrical installations where the chassis is connected to earth with a separate terminal, instead of via the mains cable. In effect this provides the same automatic disconnection as Class I, for equipment that otherwise would be Class 0.

==Class II==
A Class II or double insulated electrical appliance uses reinforced protective insulation in addition to basic insulation. Hence, it has been designed in such a way that it does not require a safety connection to electrical earth (ground). 

The basic requirement is that no single failure can result in dangerous voltage becoming exposed so that it might cause an electric shock and that this is achieved without relying on an earthed metal casing. This is usually achieved at least in part by having at least two layers of insulating material between live parts and the user, or by using reinforced insulation. 

In Europe, a double insulated appliance must be labelled &quot;Class II&quot; or &quot;double insulated&quot; or bear the double insulation symbol: ⧈ (a square inside another square). As such, the appliance should not be connected to an earth conductor because the high-impedance casing will cause only low-fault currents that are unable to trigger the fusible cut-out. 

Insulated AC/DC power supplies (such as cell-phone chargers) are typically designated as Class II, meaning that the DC output wires are isolated from the AC input. The designation &quot;Class II&quot; should not be confused with the designation &quot;Class 2&quot;, as the latter is unrelated to insulation (it originates from standard UL 1310, setting limits on maximum output voltage/current/power).

==Class IIFE==

These devices have a Functional Earth &quot;FE&quot;. This differs from a protective earth ground in that it does not offer shock protection from a hazardous voltage. However, it does help to mitigate electromagnetic noise or EMI. This is often important in Audio and Medical design. Note as they also include double insulation it means that users will not be able to come into contact with any live parts.

==Class III==
A Class III appliance is designed to be supplied from a separated extra-low voltage (SELV) power source. The voltage from a SELV supply is low enough such that under normal conditions a person can safely come into contact with an energized conductor without risk of electrical shock. The additional safety features required by Class I and Class II appliances are therefore not required. Specifically, Class III appliances are designed without an earth conductor and should not be connected to the earth grounding of the SELV power source. For medical devices, compliance with Class III is &quot;not&quot; considered sufficient protection, and furthermore, stringent regulations apply to such equipment.

The Class III label does not guarantee a device&#x27;s safety in any aspect other than electrical shock. Even at low voltages, abusive or unintended use (such as disassembly or incorrect installation) may still yield dangerous outcomes. Although there should be no risk of receiving an electrical shock from Class III appliances, other electrical hazards (such as overheating and fire) must still be considered. For instance, a laptop or mobile phone might qualify as a Class III appliance if it is charged via an external SELV adapter, even though the onboard battery could pose a fire risk.

<text>&#x27; (abbreviation for diskf&quot;&#x27;ree&quot;) is a standard Unix command used to display the amount of available disk space for file systems on which the invoking user has appropriate read access. is typically implemented using the statfs or statvfs system calls.

==History==
 for Unix-like systems is part of the X/Open Portability Guide since issue 2 of 1987. It was inherited into the first version of POSIX and the Single Unix Specification. It first appeared in Version 1 AT&amp;T Unix.

The version of bundled in GNU coreutils was written by Torbjorn Granlund, David MacKenzie, and Paul Eggert. The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.

==Usage==
The Single UNIX Specification specifications for are:
 df [-k] [-P|-t] [-del] [file...]
:Use 1024-byte units, instead of the default 512-byte units, when writing space figures.
:Use a standard, portable, output format
:Write the amount of free space of the file system containing the specified file

Most implementations of in Unix and Unix-like operating systems include extra options. The BSD and GNU coreutils versions include , which lists free space in human readable format displaying units with the appropriate SI prefix (e.g. 10 MB), , which lists inode usage, and , restricting display to only local filesystems. GNU includes as well, listing filesystem type information, but the GNU shows the sizes in 1K blocks by default.

==Specification==
The Single Unix Specification (SUS) specifies by original space is reported in blocks of 512 bytes, and that at a minimum, the file system names and the amount of free space.

The use of 512-byte units is historical practice and maintains compatibility with and other utilities. This does not mandate that the file system itself be based on 512-byte blocks. The option was added as a compromise measure. It was agreed by the standard developers that 512 bytes was the best default unit because of its complete historical consistency on System V (versus the mixed 512/1024-byte usage on BSD systems), and that a option to switch to 1024-byte units was a good compromise. Users who prefer the more logical 1024-byte quantity can easily to without breaking many historical scripts relying on the 512-byte units.

The output with consists of one line of information for each specified file system. These lines are formatted as follows:

In the following list, all quantities expressed in 512-byte units (1024-byte when -k is specified) will be rounded up to the next higher unit. The fields are:
:The name of the file system, in an implementation-defined format.
:The total size of the file system in 512-byte units. The exact meaning of this figure is implementation-defined, but should include , , plus any space reserved by the system not normally available to a user.
:The total amount of space allocated to existing files in the file system, in 512-byte units.
:The total amount of space available within the file system for the creation of new files by unprivileged users, in 512-byte units. When this figure is less than or equal to zero, it shall not be possible to create any new files on the file system without first deleting others, unless the process has appropriate privileges. The figure written may be less than zero.
:The percentage of the normally available space that is currently allocated to all files on the file system. This shall be calculated using the fraction:
:expressed as a percentage. This percentage may be greater than 100 if is less than zero. The percentage value shall be expressed as a positive integer, with any fractional result causing it to be rounded to the next highest integer.
:The directory below which the file system hierarchy appear

<text>The Nehru jacket is a hip-length tailored coat for men or women, with a mandarin collar, and with its front modelled on the Indian achkan or sherwani, a garment worn by Jawaharlal Nehru, the prime minister of India from 1947 to 1964.

== History ==

The Nehru jacket is a variation of the Jodhpuri where the material is often khadi (hand-woven cloth). The Jodhpuri itself is an evolution from the Angarkha. Popularized during the terms of Jawaharlal Nehru, these distinct Bandhgalas made from khadi remain popular to this day.

== Style ==

Unlike the achkan, which falls somewhere below the knees of the wearer, the Nehru jacket is shorter. Jawaharlal Nehru, notably, never wore this type of Nehru jacket.

== Popularity ==
The jacket was first marketed as the &quot;Nehru jacket&quot; in Europe and America in the mid-1960s. It was briefly popular there in the late 1960s and early 1970s, its popularity spurred by the aspirational class&#x27; growing awareness of foreign cultures, by the minimalism of the Mod lifestyle and, in particular, by Sammy Davis Jr. and the Beatles. Some were also worn by Roger Delgado&#x27;s version of the renegade Time Lord known as the Master on the British science fiction television show &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

Charles Barron and Mahathir Mohamad are among the politicians who frequently wear Nehru suits.

In 2012, the Nehru jacket was listed among the &quot;Top 10 Political Fashion Statements&quot; by &quot;Time magazine&quot;.

<text>In Greek mythology, Iynx () was an Arcadian nymph; a daughter of the god Pan and the nymph Echo. In popular myth, she used an enchantment to cast a spell on Zeus, which caused him to fall in love with Io. In consequence of this, Hera metamorphosed her into the bird called iynx (Eurasian wryneck, &quot;Jynx torquilla&quot;).

She was the symbol of restless, passionate love.

==Mythology==
Iynx was an Arcadian nymph and the daughter of Pan and Echo, or Peitho. She was the creator of a magical love-charm known as the &quot;iynx&quot;—a spinning wheel with a wryneck bird attached. Iynx used her enchantments to make Zeus fall in love with her or with the nymph Io. Hera was enraged and transformed her into a wryneck bird.

According to another story, she was a daughter of Pierus, and as she and her sisters had presumed to enter into a musical contest with the Muses, she was changed into the bird iynx. This bird, the symbol of passionate and restless love, was given by Aphrodite to Jason, who, by turning it round and pronouncing certain magic words, excited the love of Medea.

== Magic wheel ==

&quot;Iynx&quot; toys were small metal or wooden discs rotated by pulling attached strings, in a manner similar to more modern button whirligig toys.

<text>The Modern Parents is a comic strip from the British comic &quot;Viz&quot; created by John Fardell who both writes and illustrates it. One of the most enduring and frequent strips in &quot;Viz&quot;, having appeared regularly since the early 1990s, it is a parody of &#x27;ethically aware&#x27; middle-class parents and the New Age movement. Similarly to Fardell&#x27;s other creation, The Critics, it satirises liberal snobbery. On one occasion, the Modern Parents and the Critics appeared in the same strip, each pair mistakenly attending the event intended for the other, though the two strips are generally slightly different in tone and style. 

&quot;The Social Affairs Unit&#x27;s Reverend Peter Mullen has described their parenting style as:

&quot;These creepy, empty-headed trendies have a son who is not merely allowed to do exactly as he likes but in a perfect state of satanic permissiveness is compelled to do as he likes. This is child-abuse of the worst sort. No landmarks. No boundaries. Ultimately, therefore, no understanding of good and bad.&quot;

==Malcolm and Cressida==
Malcolm and Cressida Wright-Pratt (their surname is a pun on &#x27;right pratt&#x27;, a good description of their personalities) are parents whose obsession with ethical and environmental awareness often works against their basic role as parents to Tarquin and Guinevere. The Modern Parents do not believe in childhood activities such as fairgrounds, fast food restaurants, games, competitions and sports, toys, normal holidays or mainstream school and impose their moral positions on their children and the children of others. They take the moral high-ground because of their ideologies and expect everyone to appreciate their actions, however the two are just as hypocritical as much as they are pretentious (as displayed in one strip when they began a campaign against slavery but then employed unpaid interns to do the work for them).

In the March 2008 issue of Viz they visit Uncle Eddie for his daughter Amy&#x27;s second birthday party and give their niece an ethical gift, which seems (to Eddie) to be a &quot;donation to an Oxfam-funded goat thingy for a starving African family&quot;, but turns out to be a donation to their own &quot;Malcolm and Cressida Ethical Living Awareness Project&quot;. Tarquin and Guinevere give her a teddy bear to the dismay of Malcolm and Cressida, who declare it to be &quot;an anthropomorphisation of wild animals&quot;, &quot;an attempt to brainwash Amy into keeping pets&quot; and &quot;offensive and oppressive to the Sudanese people&quot; (referring to the contemporary Sudanese teddy bear blasphemy case). They then assume Amy will &quot;at least appreciate our effort to reduce the bear&#x27;s carbon footprint by putting it in the recycle bin&quot; and snatch it from her.

Both have large upturned noses. Cressida has her hair pulled back in a tight pony-tail and Malcolm has a scruffy beard and incredibly large teeth. Malcolm and Cressida were not originally married as they believed it to be an outmoded and sexist institution that enslaved women. However, they did eventually marry to get their wedding gifts. They had their own pagan ceremony and wrote their own vows (&quot;Do you, Cressida, take Malcolm to be your husband so long as you find it acceptable and convenient?&quot;)

Cressida delights in pointing out that, as a woman, she is an oppressed minority while Malcolm frequently claims he has &quot;Sensitive Persons Syndrome&quot;. A committed environmentalist, he insists he supports public transport, but cannot use it himself because his Syndrome prevents him from getting on a bus or train and his Volvo &quot;is Scandinavian, so it must be eco-friendly&quot;. The pair often identify themselves with ethnic minorities, claiming to have some Celtic heritage or that they were Native Americans in a previous life.

Malcolm and Cressida believe that all humans are equal even to the extent that there is no such thing as immaturity. Tarquin is often greeted by the sight of his parents openly having sexual intercourse (having also previously announced this intention to their children). Each story finds them forcing their children into some new ethically aware activity that ostensibly encourages a policy of togetherness but ends up with Tarquin and Guinevere often escaping to their much more realist Uncle Eddie (Cressida&#x27;s brother) who supplies them with ice creams and trips to theme parks.

Malcolm has a brother, Oswald, married to Lana (real name Linda), and a neurotic spinster sister, Joy. Oswald and Lana have an extremely snobbish son, Hector James. The family are Conservative and rich, damning the British worker and the foreigner with equal vigour. Malcolm also used to be a keen Young Conservative before meeting Cressida while canvassing. Lured by Cressida into a new world of progressive ideological debate (and sex), Malcolm abandoned his dreams of becoming a future Tory Prime Minister and grew a beard. One episode shows Malcolm&#x27;s lock-up garage where he keeps a motorbike and a topless women calendar on the wall. He goes for a ride on the bike but is injured by Cressida, who does not know it is him and throws a protest sign at the front wheel, throwing him off. Unconscious, he imagines an alternative reality in which he has an attractive wife and is Prime Minister. Another day Cressida takes two ethically-aware friends for a tour of the house and visits Malcolm&#x27;s computer den. He is caught in the den playing pornographic computer games such as &quot;Deth Fuck&quot; and &quot;Karate Whores Must Die&quot; whilst leering and salivating wildly.

Cressida&#x27;s family have made few appearances: her mother and father seem to be separated and her mother appears to drink. When Malcolm left her and Tarquin, Cressida wondered what she was going to do for money until Tarquin pointed out that it was always her father who sent her monthly cheques. However her father had taken a new mistress: since this meant he had no money to give to his daughter, Cressida experimented with prostitution.

An early Viz character, called Mike Smitt, looks similar to the original form of Malcolm. This character is referred to as a patronising git, as all he does is talk to people as if they are stupid, or point out to the whole street that a girl on crutches is disabled and unable to speak up for herself.

==Tarquin and Guinevere==
Tarquin is the elder child, aged about twelve, often the voice of common sense, a very effective foil to Malcolm &amp; Cressida due to his desire for normality or to make money. His diplomatic ability is a means of resistance to parental authority diametrically opposed to their schemes: he is calculating and methodical in his manipulation of Malcolm &amp; Cressida. He has a rational, scientific worldview that rejects vague ideas about spirituality and seems grounded in evidence and deductive reasoning. As a result, he is very sceptical about ideas such as crystal healing or rebirthing, questioning their rational basis, even asking a practitioner of &quot;Wan-Ki&quot;: &quot;Where did you get your diploma, University of Mumbo-Jumbo?&quot; When Malcolm and Cressida take him to a &quot;Whole Self Centre&quot;, claiming that he suffers from an &quot;erotic shame complex&quot;, Tarquin talks of a workshop about discovering the inner child. He gets the attendees to undress and touch each other, dance, and feel each other&#x27;s bodies while several smartly dressed businessmen queue and pay to watch through the windows. It&#x27;s a front for a sleazy peep show. Occasionally a strip would have Tarquin showing little involvement, or none at all in the parents&#x27; end. A Christmas themed strip had Tarquin reprimanded for wanting toys for Christmas &quot;when there is so much suffering in the world&quot;. Malcolm attempts to make amends by dressing as a &quot;nature spirit&quot;, which is foiled when he jumps out in front of a neighbor&#x27;s child, mistaking him for Tarquin, and is beaten and apprehended by the child&#x27;s father, having recently heard news of a child molestor in the area. Cressida cancels her plans with Tarquin to sort it out with the police, leaving Tarquin some money for the health foods store. Tarquin uses it to get the toys he wished for, as well as pizza while watching the Christmas day James Bond film.

Despite his female name, Guinevere is a boy. Wanting to avoid gender stereotyping, Malcolm and Cressida occasionally try to make one or both of their sons wear girls&#x27; clothes or take &quot;female&quot; roles in some psychobabble ceremony. Guinevere was born during the course of the comic strip and after growing to his current age of about five or six, stopped there. Tarquin appeared to get older in the early years of &quot;Modern Parents&quot; and in one episode turned thirteen. Guinevere, whose name is usually just shortened to &quot;Guin&quot; by his brother, is largely a passive character, easily upset, his big brother often coming to his rescue. Guinevere&#x27;s first word was football although Malcolm and Cressida were keen for it to be dolphin.

==Other characters==
Malcolm and Cressida have many friends, notably Ashley and Cordelia in the Ethically Aware Parents Support Group, who, like them, are middle-class, politically correct and often into various causes. Most of them have children who, without exception, have the same despairing and uncooperative attitude towards their parents as Tarquin and Guinevere. Cressida&#x27;s brother, Edward – more commonly known as simply Uncle Eddie – acts as a counter-weight to his sister and brother-in-law and treats his two nephews, Tarquin and Guinevere, like normal boys. &#x27;Guest&#x27; characters include Dr Earnest Rabbitt (who is firmly opposed to killing animals) and Professor Ruth Lesscow (an extreme women&#x27;s rights activist). In earlier episodes of the strip, Tarquin had a friend called Ian, of whom his parents clearly disapproved, and once a girlfriend called Dawn, of whom Malcolm and Cressida thought Tarquin was controlling and possessive.

<text>Sky Witness is a British pay television channel owned and operated by Sky, a division of Comcast. The channel primarily broadcasts Police procedural shows from the United States aimed at the 18–45 age group. An Italian version of Sky Witness, called Sky Investigation, launched on 1 July 2021.

==History ==
Sky Witness&#x27;s history can be traced back to 1993 when UK Living began broadcasting. The channel was purchased by BSkyB in 2010 and announced on 25 October 2010, that Living would be rebranded as Sky Living in early 2011 to improve their entertainment line-up.

On 8 June 2018, Sky announced that Sky Living would be closed and replaced on 6 August by a new channel Sky Witness, bringing an end to the &quot;Living&quot; brand after 25 years.

Following the acquisition of Sky by Comcast in 2018, much of the programming previously screened on the Comcast-owned Universal TV (particularly first-run acquired series) was moved to Sky Witness; allowing the channel to be closed and replaced by Sky Comedy.

The same Sky Witness schedule, shown in both the UK and Ireland, also includes a selection of documentary programming from both the Irish Broadcasters, RTE and TV3/Virgin Media Television Ireland (the Irish broadcaster now owned by the cable TV company of the same name in Ireland, not to be confused with the earlier Flextech version of Virgin Media Television). Also there is some independently produced series, some commissioned directly by Sky, focusing on Ireland&#x27;s various emergency services, medical, and certain Government of Ireland agencies, such as the Revenue Commissioners. The selection is similar to the genres focusing on other countries equivalent agencies, also shown on Sky Witness.

<text>The University of Richmond (UR or U of R) is a private liberal arts college in Richmond, Virginia, United States. It is a primarily undergraduate, residential institution with approximately 3,900 undergraduate and graduate students in five schools: the School of Arts and Sciences; the E. Claiborne Robins School of Business; the Jepson School of Leadership Studies; the University of Richmond School of Law; and the School of Professional &amp; Continuing Studies. It is classified among &quot;Baccalaureate Colleges: Arts &amp; Sciences Focus&quot;.

==History==
The University of Richmond traces its history to a meeting of the Baptist General Association of Virginia held on June 8, 1830. The BGAV resolved &quot;that the Baptists of this State form an education society for the improvement of the ministry.&quot; Thus, the Virginia Baptist Education Society was instituted. However, the society did not have enough funds for a proper school yet. In the meantime, they asked their vice-president, Rev. Edward Baptist, &quot;to accept into his home young men wishing to prepare for the ministry.&quot; Baptist was an 1813 graduate of Hampden–Sydney College. In August 1830, William Allgood, the first student of this ministry school, came to Baptist&#x27;s Dunlora Plantation to attend classes in &quot;a building of three or four rooms.&quot; The school, eventually known as Dunlora Academy, enrolled nine students in its first year. After two years, the society purchased for $4,000 &quot;Spring Farm,&quot; located about five miles north of Richmond. This farm was the home of the Virginia Baptist Seminary which opened July 1, 1832, and began classes July 4 under the leadership of Robert Ryland.

The Virginia Baptist Seminary offered courses in Latin, Greek, and mathematics. Each day, students worked for three hours at farm labor. President Ryland thought highly of this system as it was &quot;improving the health, diminishing the expenses, and perhaps guarding the humility of the young preachers.&quot; In reality, the farming experiment proved to be unprofitable and was dropped from the school after a couple of years. Over time, enrollment and faculty increased to a point where the education society began looking for a more suitable property than the small &quot;Spring Farm,&quot; where dorms consisted of log cabins while the schoolrooms and the chapel were in a barn.

In 1834, the Virginia Baptist Education Society bought the former Haxall family plantation. This property was much larger and more efficient than &quot;Spring Farm.&quot; It was situated in the main house, Columbia, and other brick buildings. As the seminary grew, it became in need of funds. The education society was unable to receive bequests or hold property as it was an unincorporated organization. The seminary could not receive a charter from the legislature as it was a theological school. Therefore, around 1840 the seminary applied for a charter as a liberal arts college, which was granted on March 4 of that year. At this time, the society turned over the land and buildings of the school to the trustees of the newly minted Richmond College.

Richmond College officially opened on January 2, 1843. It had &quot;68 students, 3 teachers, land and buildings valued at $20,000, a small endowment, and a library of 700 volumes&quot;. For an eleven-month session, tuition and room and board cost $120. The salaries of the teachers were $900 for President Ryland, and $600 and $500 for the other two.

During the American Civil War, the entire student body formed a regiment and joined the Confederate army. Richmond College&#x27;s buildings were used as a hospital for Confederate troops and later as a barracks for Union soldiers. The college invested all of its funds in Confederate war bonds, and the outcome of the war left it bankrupt. In 1866, James Thomas donated $5,000 to reopen the college. The T.C. Williams School of Law opened in 1870.

In 1894, the college elected Frederic W. Boatwright president. President Boatwright would serve for 51 years. He is most remembered for raising the funds needed to move the college in 1914 from its original uptown location to a new 350-acre campus in what is now Westhampton area of Richmond, and in doing so created Westhampton College for women.

Westhampton College opened with 82 students on September 17, 1914, as Richmond Women&#x27;s College. Its first dean was May Keller, with Boatwright serving as treasurer. The college was housed in the Richmond Women’s College Building, built between July 1911 and 1913. Shortly afterward, the building was renamed Westhampton College. In 1948, the building received its current name of North Court. The building was divided into an academic wing and living space for the students and faculty. In addition, the female students had access to the library and science buildings of Richmond College.

The institution&#x27;s main library, Boatwright Memorial Library, is named in Boatwright&#x27;s honor. Symbolically, the library and its soaring academic gothic tower occupy the highest spot on the grounds. Its grounds were landscaped in 1913, by Warren H. Manning under the supervision of Charles Gillette.

The institution was renamed the University of Richmond On September 21, 1920. This established a corporation that combined the renamed Richmond College for Men and Westhampton College. The respective parts of the campus continue to be referred to as the Westhampton and the Richmond &quot;sides&quot;. “
In 1949, the E. Claiborne Robins School of Business opened, followed by the School of Continuing Studies in 1962. In 1969, when financial issues threatened closing the institution or turning it over to the Commonwealth of Virginia, E. Claiborne Robins Sr., a trustee and alumnus, donated $50 million to the institution, the largest gift made to an institution of higher education at the time. In constant dollars, it remains among the largest. Robins&#x27; goal was to make Richmond one of the best private universities in the country. In partnership with the institution&#x27;s president E. Bruce Heilman and development director H. Gerald Quigg the $10 million matching grant component of the gift raised over an additional $60 million, making the institution&#x27;s total endowment at the time one of the highest in the country.

During World War II, Richmond was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the V-12 Navy College Training Program which offered students a path to a Navy commission.

==Campus==
===Main campus===
The University of Richmond&#x27;s campus consists of in a suburban setting on the western edge of the city. Most of the campus lies within the city limits; a small section of the south campus, including the Special Programs Building (home to the campus police), intramural sports fields, and most of the campus apartments, lies within Henrico County.

The institution has, with few exceptions, remained true to the original architectural plans for the campus—red brick buildings in a collegiate gothic style set around shared open lawns. Many of the original buildings, including Jeter Hall and North Court, both residence halls, and Ryland Hall, the original administration building and library for Richmond College, were designed by Ralph Adams Cram in 1910. Cram, a noted institutional architect, also designed buildings for Princeton, Cornell, Rice, and Williams, among other universities. Warren H. Manning, a former apprentice to Frederick Law Olmsted, designed the original landscape plan. The overall effect of the gothic architecture set amid a landscape of pines, rolling hills, and Westhampton Lake, is intimate and tranquil. In 2000 and again in 2021, the campus was recognized by The Princeton Review as the most beautiful in the United States.

The University of Richmond owns the former Reynolds Metals Executive Office Building, a gift-purchase from Alcoa in 2001. Located a short distance from campus, the building was designed by architect Gordon Bunshaft and opened in 1958. The building, which incorporates nearly of aluminum, is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. It currently serves as the headquarters of Altria Group and its subsidiary, Philip Morris USA, which leases it from the institution.

In early 2001, the institution finalized the purchase of of land in eastern Goochland County, a short distance from the main campus. The land is currently used for biology research, but future uses could include intramural athletic fields.

The University of Richmond campus used to be home to the Virginia Governor&#x27;s School for Visual and Performing Arts and Humanities during the summer.

===UR Downtown===
The institution also operates UR Downtown, a downtown campus of sorts occupying leased space within a larger building at 626 East Broad Street. Despite its small size, UR Downtown hosts the Richmond on Broad café (owned and operated by the institution), a mixed-purpose lower-level, art gallery spaces, offices, two classrooms, and a conference room. Located in the city&#x27;s Arts District, UR Downtown also participates in the monthly art festival, First Fridays. Moreover, the space hosts multiple exhibits each year, often in collaboration with local organizations. The UR Downtown conference room is also home to an original 1956 sgraffito-style mural by Hans E. Gassman, created for the bank that occupied the building in the past. Other than art, UR Downtown serves as a VITA site, providing free tax assistance to low-income families. The spaces inside UR Downtown are made available to advocacy and non-profit organizations in need of meeting space. The Caricco Center for Pro Bono law service, the Richmond Families Initiative, and Partners in the Arts also operate out of UR Downtown.

==Athletics==

The institution won its first national championship in 1982 when women&#x27;s tennis won the AIAW national championship. The institution won its first NCAA national championship in any sport on December 19, 2008, when the Spiders football team defeated the Montana Grizzlies 24–7 in the NCAA Division I Football Championship (which is exclusively for teams in the Football Championship Subdivision, the second tier of NCAA Division I football). Richmond was ranked 23rd in men&#x27;s basketball at one point during the 2009–10 season. During its 2010 season, the Richmond Men&#x27;s Cross Country team placed 24th at the NCAA Division I Cross Country Championships. In the 2020-2021 Cross Country season, Richmond Men&#x27;s Cross Country team became the first NCAA Division I program without any scholarships or an indoor or outdoor track team to win a conference title. The 2010-11 Richmond Spiders men&#x27;s basketball team won the 2011 Atlantic 10 men&#x27;s basketball tournament, earning the team a spot in the 2011 NCAA Men&#x27;s Division I Basketball Tournament. The Spiders fell to Kansas in the Sweet Sixteen.

<doc id="856512" wikidata="Q3529302" url="?curid=856512" title="Richmond College, Galle">
<text>Richmond College () is a primary and secondary school in Galle, Sri Lanka which was established as the Galle School in 1814. The founder of the school was the Wesleyan Missionary George Bough. The first principal of the school was Rev Samuel Langdon. In 1882, it was renamed Richmond College. Richmond College is considered as the oldest public school in Sri Lanka and is the first Wesleyan Methodist school to be established in Asia.

==Founding (Unofficial)==
The first missionaries from the Wesleyan Methodist Church to Ceylon were led by the Rev. Dr. Thomas Coke, and consisted of William Ault, James Lynch, George Erskine, William Martin Harvard, Thomas Hall Squance, and John Mckenny, leaving England on 30 December 1813. During their journey, Coke died at sea on 2 May. They reached Ceylon on 29 June 1814. 
They held an inaugural church service on 3 July 1814 at the Old Dutch Church at Galle Fort. Governor Robert Brownrigg, sent his brother-in-law, Rev Bisset, the senior colonial chaplain, to meet and confer with the missionaries, inviting the missionaries to establish schools for the Ceylonese.
Following a conference on 11 July, Benjamin Clough (1791-1853) was elected to take charge of the Galle station. Subsequently, Clough was visited by the Maha Mudaliyár of Galle, Don Abraham Dias Abeysinghe Amarasekera, on 25 July 1814, who upon hearing that Clough was going to establish a school offered his deceased brother&#x27;s house to be used for the school. The house, &#x27;Doornberg&#x27;, located on Upper Dickson Road, was built by the Dutch in 1712. 
According to Clough’s journal, which was archived in the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) at the University of London, he notes -

Mission documents record, 
The school had only five children and one adult, the Mudaliyár himself. It was initially an English school, the Galle School, and then subsequently became known as Galle Boys’ School or as Galle English School.

== History ==
The first College magazine was published in 1887. It was only the second occasion that a school in Ceylon had produced a magazine. The same year, the English Literary Union was formed and cricket was started in the school. In 1894, under the principal-ship of Horatius Hartley, the Richmond College Old Boys&#x27; Association was formed. Another important occurrence during that year was the establishment of the College Cadet Corps. Main Hall James Horne Darrel assumed duties as principal in 1896. The school experienced both physical expansion as well as qualitative growth. During his period, Richmond rose to be recognised as one of the best schools in the island. At the local University of Cambridge Examinations of 1905, Richmond earned a top position among assisted schools and second place among all schools in Ceylon. The same year, the Richmond-Mahinda Cricket Encounter was played for the first time, with the two principals, Darrell of Richmond and F. L. Woodward of Mahinda College, officiating as umpires. Darrell sacrificed his life for the college nursing the pupils who were afflicted with &#x27;typhoid&#x27; when there was an outbreak in the country and was buried at the Dadalla Cemetery, Galle. W. J. T. Small became principal following the death of Darrell. Darrell and Small are the only two principals of Richmond who have been buried side by side and both principals met with their deaths under tragic circumstances; the former due to typhoid fever and the latter due to an accident.

Commerce was introduced as a subject in 1912. This was also the year in which football was started at Richmond. In 1915, the 2nd Galle (Richmond) Scouts Group was established. Scouting at Richmond College enjoyed remarkable success from the beginning. The first two King&#x27;s Scouts in the island were produced by Richmond. In 1916, Ceylon&#x27;s first cub pack was started at Richmond College. A notable event during the Small&#x27;s period was the formation of the National Association at Richmond in 1915. It was in effect a forum within the school for the emerging nationalist movement. In 1922, Alec Sneath took over the reins of Richmond College. He was responsible for many measures which brought refinement and qualitative development to the school. In 1926, a well-equipped library was established in a new building. The Science Society was started the same year. In 1931, the Sinhala Literary Union came into being.

In 1940, the last of the missionary principals left, leaving the school in the hands of local graduates. E. R. de Silva, an old boy (alumni) of the school, had the distinction of becoming the first Ceylonese principal of Richmond College. This was a period which saw major changes in the educational structure of Ceylon. The Free Education Scheme which was devised by C. W. W. Kannangara, an old boy of Richmond College, was being implemented, and the school had to be geared to suit the changes. The history of Richmond are from original Mission Records held in the Methodist Mission Library, in Colombo and in England.

In 1962, Richmond College, which was owned by the Methodist Mission, was vested in the government with no compensation to the Mission. D. G. Welikala, the first head of Richmond College under state management, was also its first Buddhist principal. With the takeover, the Methodist Vernacular School on Richmond Hill was amalgamated with Richmond. This school was referred to as the &quot;Kaha Iskole (කහ ඉස්කෝලේ)&quot; by some and &quot;Pin Iskole (පිං ඉස්කෝලෙ)&quot; meaning Charity school by others has been in existence from the time the Missionaries established a learning seat on Richmond Hill in 1858. During this period, considerable expansion and change had to take place to cater to the new situation. Richmond College faced the challenge of transition so successfully that the then Minister of Education commended Richmond on several occasions, describing it as a model institution among nationalised schools.

Richmond College was one of the first schools in the island to start teaching agriculture as a subject. In 1969, it became the first school in the country to start an agricultural stream for the Advanced Level. In 1976, the College celebrated its centenary of upgrading. In terms of the provisions of the White Paper on Education, Richmond College was named a National School in 1986. Richmond College Old Boys&#x27; Association was incorporated in 1998 by Act #04 of Parliament of Sri Lanka.

In 2013 the Methodist Church at Richmond Hill was declared was formally recognised by the Government as an Archaeological Protected Monument.

==Cricket==
The annual cricket match between Richmond College and Mahinda College is known as &quot;the lovers&#x27; quarrel&quot;. It is one of the longest cricket match series in Sri Lanka, having been played for over 119 years. The match which is also known as the &quot;Lovers&#x27; Quarrel&quot; in public, is played at the Galle International Stadium. The Lovers&#x27; Quarrel was begun in 1905, under the two principals Rev. James Horne Darrel of Richmond College and Sir. Frank Lee Woodward of Mahinda College.

<text>Harold Calvin Marston Morse (March 24, 1892 – June 22, 1977) was an American mathematician best known for his work on the &quot;calculus of variations in the large&quot;, a subject where he introduced the technique of differential topology now known as Morse theory. The Morse–Palais lemma, one of the key results in Morse theory, is named after him, as is the Thue–Morse sequence, an infinite binary sequence with many applications.

He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1929, the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1932, and the American Philosophical Society in 1936. In 1933 he was awarded the Bôcher Memorial Prize for his work in mathematical analysis. J. Robert Oppenheimer described Morse as &quot;almost a statesman of mathematics.&quot;

==Biography==
He was born in Waterville, Maine to Ella Phoebe Marston and Howard Calvin Morse in 1892. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Colby College (also in Waterville) in 1914. At Harvard University, he received both his master&#x27;s degree in 1915 and his PhD in 1917. He wrote his PhD thesis, &quot;Certain Types of Geodesic Motion of a Surface of Negative Curvature&quot;, under the direction of George David Birkhoff.

He was married on June 20, 1922 to Celeste Phelps and they had two children, Meroe and Dryden. The couple divorced. He later married Louise Jefferys on June 13, 1940. They had five children, Julia, William, Elizabeth, Peter, and Louise.

Morse was a Benjamin Peirce Instructor at Harvard in 1919–1920, after which he served as an assistant professor at Cornell University from 1920 to 1925 and at Brown University in 1925–1926. He returned to Harvard in 1926, advancing to professor in 1929, and teaching there until 1935. That year, he accepted a position at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, where he remained until his retirement in 1962.

He spent most of his career on a single subject, now known as Morse theory, a branch of differential topology that enables one to analyze the topology of a smooth manifold by studying differentiable functions on that manifold. Morse originally applied his theory to geodesics (critical points of the energy functional on paths); these techniques were used in Raoul Bott&#x27;s proof of his periodicity theorem. Morse theory is a very important subject in modern mathematical physics, such as string theory.

He died on June 22, 1977, at his home in Princeton, New Jersey. His second wife, Louise Jeffreys, died in 2016.

Marston Morse should not be confused with either his 5th cousin twice removed Samuel Morse, famous for Morse code, nor Anthony Morse, famous for the Morse–Sard theorem.

<doc id="856528" wikidata="Q1188784" url="?curid=856528" title="Racer (simulator)">
<text>Racer, fully named Racer Free Car Simulator, is a freeware and source available video game simulator that runs on Microsoft Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.

Although &quot;Racer&quot; started out as a driving simulator, it also has features that are usually seen in racing games, such as racing against AI cars, or against human opponents in multiplayer mode. Its weak points, when compared with commercial racing games, is the absence of wear/damage physics or a career mode.

== History ==
The first version of &quot;Racer&quot; was released on 29 August 2000. Over the years, a community has grown around &quot;Racer&quot;. The software itself is maintained exclusively by creator Ruud van Gaal. An important characteristic of &quot;Racer&quot; is its openness; the formats for cars, tracks and other data are documented. Furthermore, tools to aid in car and track creation are part of the release. As a result, a large number of cars has been created and published, in a large variety: Formula One, GT, vintage, trucks, daily drivers, luxury sedans, and even a shopping trolley has been modeled. Likewise, tracks are available in various types, from true racing circuits to drag strips, mountain roads, and even a car park.

== Licensing ==
The &quot;Racer&quot; software is free, in the sense of freeware for non-commercial users. While the source code of an older version (0.5) was made available under GPL, later versions are not under an open-source license. The cars and tracks have various forms of license, but can all be downloaded for free.

Whilst one of the strengths of &quot;Racer&quot; is its open file format, perhaps one of its weaknesses is its closed-source stance and development team. The &quot;Racer&quot; community contributes to testing and suggesting features that should be added, but the development side of &quot;Racer&quot; is much based on the amount of time the developers have to contribute towards it. This translates to infrequent updates of varying quality, but updates are often feature-rich and inspire a new burst of energy into the development and modification of cars and tracks.

<doc id="856535" wikidata="Q748108" url="?curid=856535" title="Nemea">
<text>Nemea (; ; ) is an ancient site in the northeastern part of the Peloponnese, in Greece. Formerly part of the territory of Cleonae in ancient Argolis, it is today situated in the regional unit of Corinthia. The small village of Archaia Nemea (formerly known as &quot;Iraklion&quot;) is immediately southwest of the archaeological site, while the new town of Nemea lies to the west.

Here, in Greek mythology, Heracles overcame the Nemean Lion, and here, during Antiquity, the Nemean Games were held (ending c. 235 BC) and were celebrated in the eleven Nemean odes of Pindar.

==Myth, legend and history==
In Greek mythology, Nemea was ruled by king Lycurgus and queen Eurydice. Nemea was famous in Greek myth as the home of the Nemean Lion, which was killed by the hero Heracles, and as the place where the infant Opheltes, lying on a bed of parsley, was killed by a serpent while his nurse Hypsipyle fetched water for the Seven against Thebes on their way from Argos to Thebes. The Seven founded the Nemean Games in his memory, according to its &quot;aition&quot;, or founding myth, accounting for the crown of victory being made of parsley or the wild form of celery and for the black robes of the judges, interpreted as a sign of mourning. The Nemean Games were documented from 573 BC, or earlier, at the sanctuary of Zeus at Nemea.

At the &quot;temenos&quot;, the grave of Opheltes was surrounded by open-air altars and enclosed within a stone wall. The sanctuary&#x27;s necessary spring was named Adrasteia: Pausanias wondered whether it had the name because an &quot;Adrastos&quot; had &quot;discovered&quot; it, but Adrasteia, the &quot;inescapable one&quot;, was a nurse of the infant Zeus in Crete. The tumulus nearby was credited as the burial mound of his father, and the men of Argos had the privilege of naming the priest of Nemean Zeus, Pausanias was informed when he visited in the late 2nd century CE. In his time the temple, which he noted was &quot;worth seeing&quot;, stood in a grove of cypresses; its roof had fallen in and there was no cult image within the temple. Three limestone columns of the Temple of Nemean Zeus of about 330 BC have stood since their construction, and two more were reconstructed in 2002. As of late 2007, four more are being re-erected. Three orders of architecture were employed at this temple, which stands at the end of the Classic period and presages this and other developments of Hellenistic architecture, such as the slenderness (a height of 6.34 column diameters) of the Doric columns of the exterior. The site around the temple has been excavated in annual campaigns since 1973: the great open-air altar, baths, and ancient accommodations for visitors have been unearthed. The temple stands on the site of an Archaic period temple, of which only a foundation wall is still visible. The stadion has recently been discovered. It is notable for its well-preserved vaulted entrance tunnel, dated to about 320 BC, with ancient graffiti on the walls.

The material discovered in the excavations is on display in an on-site museum constructed as a part of the University of California&#x27;s excavations.

In 2018, archaeologists discovered a large, intact tomb dating to the early Mycenaean era (1650–1400 B.C.).

===The Battle of the Nemea River===
In 394 BC the Battle of the Nemea River was fought between Sparta and her Achaian, Elean, Mantinean, and the Tegeate allies against a coalition of Boeotians, Euboeans, Athenians, Corinthians, and Argives. This was to be the last clear-cut victory that Sparta enjoyed. The tactics were similar to all other Greek hoplite battles, except that when the armies were arrayed, with the Spartans having the customary honour of being on the right, the army drifted right as it advanced. This was not good for the Spartan allies, as it exposed the soldiers to a flanking attack, but it gave the Spartans the opportunity to use their superior coordination and discipline to roll up the flank of the Athenians, who were stationed opposite.

The result of the battle was a victory for Sparta, even though her allies on the left suffered significant losses. This willingness to accept losses on the left flank for flanking position on the right was a dramatic change from typical conservative hoplite military tactics.

== Features of the Site ==

=== Temple of Zeus ===
The Temple of Zeus at Nemea is the most popular feature of the ancient Nemea site. The temple is located within a large sacred area with many buildings and features. The Temple remains today date back to the 4th century BC (~330 BC) but the temple was built on top of an earlier version dating back to the 6th century BC. The older version of the Temple of Zeus was destroyed in fire, so the people of ancient Nemea built the current temple on top of the site.

The current temple is 9,240 feet large and mostly made of limestone. It had 32 columns along the perimeter, only three of which remain standing today. Six columns have been reconstructed for reference when visiting the site. The temple was partially reconstructed to give visitors a clearer idea its magnitude and greatness. The Temple of Zeus uses three of the architectural orders: Doric, Corinthian, and Ionic. The doric peristyle is used on the exterior of the Temple, the corinthian style for the colonnade, and the ionic order for the second story of the Temple. The finished Temple of Zeus did not have any sculpted decoration. The design is traditional and displays precision and care.

=== The Hellenistic Stadium ===
The Nemean Stadium was excavated from 1974 to 1981. The natural earth where the stadium was built was perfect for the construction. Two ridges extending north from Evangelistria Hill created a natural space for an amphitheater. The track originally was 600 feet long. The eastern side of the track has a water channel, water basin, and a 300-foot marker, all of which correspond to the western side of the track. There are also thought to be &quot;front row seats&quot; in the Nemean Stadium. These &quot;seats&quot; are scattered limestone blocks parallel to the water channel.

The stadium includes a tunnel that is 36 meter long. The tunnel serves to prove that Ancient Greek architects understood how to create the complex architectural form. Along the walls of the tunnel, there is graffiti from the Ancient Greeks. The name &quot;Telestas&quot;, who is a known ancient olympic victor, was carved into the wall. There is also the apodyterion, or locker room. Athletes would use this space to prepare for the competitions by removing their clothing and rubbing their body with olive oil. The apodyterion has stamps on the roof-tiles that reveal the architects name, Sosikles.

The Nemean Games were held at the Stadium every two years. Nemea was one of the four sites for the competitions, the other sites were Delphi, Isthmia, and Olympia. All Greeks gathered for the celebration, and there was established a sacred truce to suspend all wars and hostilities so everyone could come see the competition. The track of the stadium had to be dug up, leveled, and rolled over every two years to keep its level below the water channel on the sides. Found in the excavation of the site are two black marble bases that may have been where the victors of the games stood.

=== The Oikoi ===

South of the Temple of Zeus, there are nine poorly preserved buildings, now commonly called oikoi. The Greek word “oikos”, usually meaning “house”, is used since the purpose of these buildings is unclear. These buildings face north along an east–west line and resemble the position of the treasuries at Olympia, and possibly served a similar purpose as both a treasury and meeting hall, as at Delos.

The fourth, fifth, and sixth oikos have been dated to the first half of the 5th century BC, following the Persian Wars, which suggest a general date for the others. The first oikoi were discovered during the 1920s but were not completely excavated until the 1970s. Farming activity and robbing of the building materials in the post-classical period has caused extensive damage to the site, so that only the limestone foundations of the oikoi remain.

The first oikos is the largest and measures 22.40 by 13.15 meters. It lies just east of the modern path to the Temple of Zeus. The eighth oikos, which is located much farther east, features a well in its back room that could have been used in association with preparing and eating meals.  It was later remodeled as a bronze sculpting workshop. The ninth oikos was used as a cooking area for the conjoined dining establishment but suffered early destruction. The dining establishment connected to the eighth and ninth oikos measured 9.82 by 7.44 meters and had a sacrificial pit 6.20 meters west of it. The establishment allowed up to eleven dining couches and the ash and pig bones located in the pit suggest the use of ritual dining. Located just southwest of the dining establishment, there were four kilns that used to produce roof tiles most likely during the later years of the 4th century BC when the site was renovated with funding from the Macedonian kings.

<text>Imagine FM was an Independent Local Radio station based in Stockport broadcasting to South Manchester and Cheshire in the North West of England.

==History==
The station began its life as KFM, initially as a pirate local radio station based in Stockport and broadcasting to the South Manchester/North Cheshire area on 94.2 MHz and then on 1017 kHz.

KFM ran during the 1980s and then relaunched legitimately as one of the first &#x27;incremental&#x27; local commercial stations in 1990, set up to provide more localised and specialised programming.

Stoke-on-Trent based Signal Radio assumed control of the station, following difficulties in its latter incarnation, and KFM became memorable almost solely for its 7:00 p.m. – 1:00 a.m. &quot;Night-time KFM&quot; output. This combined local and global new indie music with innovative DJing.

Presenters on air at this time include Craig Cash, Caroline Aherne, Jon Ronson, Terry Christian and Neil Cossar, all of which have gone on to forge successful careers in the media and performing arts.

KFM was succeeded by Signal Cheshire.

Imagine FM is now trading as an independent radio station since it was bought from UTV Radio in January 2009.

===Signal Cheshire===
In 1990 a new service was launched, in Cheshire, on 96.4 FM called &quot;Echo 96&quot;. In 1991, this was renamed &quot;Signal Cheshire&quot; upon the acquisition of the &quot;KFM&quot; 104.9 transmitter. Based in Stockport, &quot;Signal Cheshire&quot; targeted the surrounding area of South Manchester and much of Cheshire, opting into networked programming from the Stoke-on-Trent site by night. There was a further change of identity in 1997 to &quot;Signal FM&quot;.

In 2000, &quot;Imagine FM&quot; became the new rebranded service on 104.9 and 96.4, and when the 104.9 frequency was readvertised, the then-owners of both stations, The Wireless Group, decided that the 96.4 transmitter should return to &quot;Signal One&quot;.

The station uses the tag line &quot;Cheshire&#x27;s No.1 More Music Station&quot; and prides itself on updating the area with local news and information.

The transmitter is based close to Stockport town centre.

===2009 sale===
On Wednesday 21 May 2008, Ofcom rejected a request by UTV to co-locate the station to Warrington alongside three of its stations. As a result of Ofcom&#x27;s decision, UTV placed Imagine FM up for sale in June 2008, stating that if a buyer cannot be found by 30 June 2008 then the station&#x27;s licence would be handed back to Ofcom. The station was sold by former Imagine owners UTV Radio in January 2009 and now trades as Imagine FM Limited.
After 20 years of the 104.9 wavelength being based at Regent House, Stockport, Imagine FM moved to Waterloo Place, Stockport in November 2010 and now broadcasts from the legendary Strawberry Studios.

The transmitter was also relocated from Romiley to Stockport centre at the same time.

Under the ownership of the Helius Media Group, Imagine came under common ownership, and began to share programming with High Peak Radio in the Derbyshire dales.

===2021 sale and relaunch===
On 17 June 2021, it was announced that Bauer Radio would acquire the Imagine Radio services and add these to the Greatest Hits Radio network, further expanding GHR&#x27;s coverage of both the Greater Manchester environs (following the earlier addition of Tower FM, Wish FM, Wire FM and most recently 96.2 The Revolution to the group) and Derbyshire (where GHR already occupies the former Peak FM).

<text>The Green Zone () is the most common name for the International Zone of Baghdad. It is a area in the Karkh district of central Baghdad, Iraq, and the seat of the Iraqi government.

== History ==

===Pre-2003===
The International Zone was a heavily fortified zone in the center of the Iraqi capital that served as the headquarters of successive Iraqi regimes. It was the administrative center for the Ba&#x27;ath Party. The area was not originally home to the villas of government officials though it was the location of a number of military bases, government ministries, and presidential palaces inhabited by Saddam Hussein and his family. The largest of these was the Republican Palace that was President Saddam Hussein&#x27;s primary seat of power. The area is also known as &quot;Karradat Mariam&quot;, so named for a locally famous woman who helped the poor people of Baghdad.

===Invasion of Iraq (2003)===
The area was taken by US military forces in April 2003 in some of the heaviest fighting during the capture of Baghdad. In the lead-up to the US invasion of Iraq, Saddam and many high status residents of the area were evacuated because of the anticipated aerial bombardment of the area by US forces. Most of the remaining residents fled as US ground forces closed in on the Iraqi capital out of a fear of arrest by Coalition forces or possible reprisals by disgruntled Iraqis. Some of the original inhabitants who did not flee continued to live in the area but many are also undocumented squatters referred to as the &quot;215 Apartments&quot;.

Coalition airstrikes at the outset of the fighting left a sizable number of buildings in central Baghdad abandoned. The Coalition Provisional Authority administrators who arrived on the heels of the forward invading forces decided they were ideal for use by Coalition administrators. Jay Garner, head of the reconstruction team, set up his headquarters in the former Republican Palace; other villas were taken by groups of government officials and private contractors. Eventually some five thousand officials and civil contractors settled in the area.

The abandoned buildings were not only attractive to Coalition forces, but also to homeless Iraqis. Among these were individuals who had lost their homes in the conflict, but most were urban poor who had been homeless or lived in slums before the war and saw moving into the abandoned houses as a sizable increase in their standard of living. They felt that since they were not Ba&#x27;athist, they had as much right to the vacated houses as the Coalition authorities. As of 2009, there continued to be some five thousand of these Iraqis living in the International Zone.

===Under Coalition Forces control===
The area came to be known as the &quot;Green Zone&quot; during the occupation to refer to an area under the full control of the Coalition Forces, in contrast to the Red Zone.

The Green Zone was the governmental headquarters of the Coalition Provisional Authority that oversaw the public administration of the country from April 2003 until June 2004, when it was succeeded by the Iraqi Interim Government. The latter facilitated the first elections held after the US-led invasion, in 2005.

Entry to the Green Zone was under the control of a small garrison of American troops who manned the various checkpoints. They were typically a battalion of soldiers at FOB Prosperity, under the command of the Multi-National Division – Baghdad. Additionally, a battalion of coalition soldiers from the Republic of Georgia also manned the entry checkpoints.

The Green Zone was completely surrounded by high concrete blast walls, T-Walls and barbed wire fences with access only available through a handful of entry control points, all controlled by Coalition troops. It is this security that made the Green Zone the safest area of Baghdad, and gave its name colloquially as &quot;the bubble&quot;. The southern and eastern side of the zone is protected by the Tigris River – the only entrance to the zone from this side is the Arbataash Tamuz (July 14) Bridge (named for the date that the former regime came to power).

The Green Zone was frequently shelled by insurgents with mortars and rockets, though these attacks caused few casualties. In October 2004 it was hit by two suicide bombings, which destroyed the bazaar and the Green Zone Cafe. On April 12, 2007, a bomb went off in the Iraqi Parliament cafeteria, killing Mohammed Awad (a member of the Sunni National Dialogue Front) and injuring 22, including one of the vice presidents. The Green Zone was shelled with rocket and mortar fire almost daily from March 23, 2008, until May 5, 2008, causing numerous civilian and military casualties; as stated in a &quot;USA Today&quot; article, a high percentage of the rocket and mortar fire originated in Sadr City. On April 6, 2008, two U.S. soldiers were killed and 17 more wounded when a rocket or mortar attack struck inside the Green Zone. On July 22, 2010, three Triple Canopy security guard contractors (two Ugandans and one Peruvian) were killed and 15 more wounded (including two U.S. nationals) when a rocket attack struck inside the International Zone.

===Handover to the Iraqi government===
Since the handover of sovereignty to Iraqis, many of the facilities in the Green Zone have been turned over to the new Iraqi government. A number of embassies are located there. The largest embassy in the world, namely, the U.S. embassy is located in the southern part of the International or &quot;Green&quot; Zone overlooking the Tigris River.

On 1 January 2009, full control of the International Zone (formerly &quot;Green Zone&quot;) was handed over to Iraqi security forces, though the Zone remained off-limits to the public. This changed on 4 October 2015, when it was opened to the public with certain restrictions, and again on 10 December 2018, when parts of the Green Zone were opened to the public without restrictions for the first time in over 15 years.

===2020 Rocket Attack===
On 8 January 2020, following the assassination of Qasem Soleimani and Abu Mahdi Al-Muhandis, two Katyusha rockets struck within the Green Zone.

<doc id="856543" wikidata="Q7205089" url="?curid=856543" title="Plone (band)">
<text>Plone are an electronic music band from Birmingham, England.

==Career==
Plone formed in late 1994 when Mark Cancellara and Mike Johnston started to buy old analogue keyboards and guitar effects units, and began to rehearse and make soundscapes under the name Rehab. Johnston was living with Billy Bainbridge (who was in another band at the time, Supernal, also containing members of electro band sol dat) who bought himself a keyboard and joined the band, changing their name to Plone.

The band started gigging as support to local bands such as Pram and Broadcast. In 1997, the band was approached by Wurlitzer Jukebox who released the single, &quot;Press a Key&quot;. On the strength of this the band was signed to Warp and, in September 1998, released the single &quot;Plock&quot;. This was tipped as one of the singles of the year by &quot;NME&quot;, &quot;Melody Maker&quot; and &quot;Dazed &amp; Confused&quot;.

Rob Mitchell (who had originally signed the band to Warp) was diagnosed with cancer in 2001 and died in September that year, which caused their second album to never officially be released. Although never released, it has appeared on torrent and other file-sharing sites on the internet.

Bainbridge went on to play keyboards with Broadcast (on the &#x27;Ha Ha Sound&#x27; tour), and is now a member of Seeland with Tim Felton (now also ex-Broadcast), and released a single &quot;Wander&quot; / &quot;Pherox&quot; on Duophonic in 2005. Johnston went on to form Mike in Mono, and is also &#x27;Clive 2&#x27; in ZX Spectrum Orchestra and a member of the Modified Toy Orchestra.

Mark Cancellara is currently a magician&#x27;s assistant and DJ.

Starting in the summer of 2009, Plone&#x27;s song &quot;Plaything&quot; appeared on a Reese&#x27;s Peanut Butter Cups commercial.

In October 2019, it was announced that Bainbridge and Johnston had reconvened as Plone and that a new album would be released on the Ghost Box label in 2020. On 25 February 2020 the new album was announced, named Puzzlewood and set to be released on 17 April. It is compiled from material recorded at various points since the “lost second album”, right up to the present day.

<doc id="856544" wikidata="Q407669" url="?curid=856544" title="Methyl salicylate">
<text>Methyl salicylate (oil of wintergreen or wintergreen oil) is an organic compound with the formula C8H8O3. It is the methyl ester of salicylic acid. It is a colorless, viscous liquid with a sweet, fruity odor reminiscent of root beer (in which it is used as a flavoring), but often associatively called &quot;minty&quot;, as it is an ingredient in mint candies. It is produced by many species of plants, particularly wintergreens. It is also produced synthetically, used as a fragrance and as a flavoring agent.

==Biosynthesis and occurrence==
Methyl salicylate was first isolated (from the plant &quot;Gaultheria procumbens&quot;) in 1843 by the French chemist Auguste André Thomas Cahours (1813–1891), who identified it as an ester of salicylic acid and methanol.

The biosynthesis of methyl salicylate arises via the hydroxylation of benzoic acid by a cytochrome P450 followed by reaction with a methyltransferase enzyme.

== Methyl salicylate as a plant metabolite ==

Many plants produce methyl salicylate in small quantities. Methyl salicylate levels are often upregulated in response to biotic stress, especially infection by pathogens, where it plays a role in the induction of resistance. Methyl salicylate is believed to function by being metabolized to the plant hormone salicylic acid. Since methyl salicylate is volatile, these signals can spread through the air to distal parts of the same plant or even to neighboring plants, whereupon they can function as a mechanism of plant-to-plant communication, &quot;warning&quot; neighbors of danger. Methyl salicylate is also released in some plants when they are damaged by herbivorous insects, where they may function as a cue aiding in the recruitment of predators, notably hoverflies, lacewings, and lady beetles. 

Some plants produce methyl salicylate in larger quantities, where it likely involved in direct defense against predators or pathogens. Examples of this latter class include: some species of the genus &quot;Gaultheria&quot; in the family Ericaceae, including &quot;Gaultheria procumbens&quot;, the wintergreen or eastern teaberry; some species of the genus &quot;Betula&quot; in the family Betulaceae, particularly those in the subgenus &quot;Betulenta&quot; such as &quot;B. lenta&quot;, the black birch; all species of the genus &quot;Spiraea&quot; in the family Rosaceae, also called the meadowsweets; species of the genus &quot;Polygala&quot; in the family Polygalaceae. Methyl salicylate can also be a component of floral scents, especially in plants dependent on nocturnal pollinators like moths, scarab beetles, and (nocturnal) bees.

==Commercial production==
Methyl salicylate can be produced by esterifying salicylic acid with methanol. Commercial methyl salicylate is now synthesized, but in the past, it was commonly distilled from the twigs of &quot;Betula lenta&quot; (sweet birch) and &quot;Gaultheria procumbens&quot; (eastern teaberry or wintergreen).

==Uses==

Methyl salicylate is used in high concentrations as a rubefacient and analgesic in deep heating liniments (such as Bengay) to treat joint and muscular pain. Randomised double blind trials report that evidence of its effectiveness is weak, but stronger for acute pain than chronic pain, and that effectiveness may be due entirely to counterirritation. However, in the body it metabolizes into salicylates, including salicylic acid, a known NSAID.

Methyl salicylate is used in low concentrations (0.04% and under) as a flavoring agent in root beer, chewing gum, mints and medicine such as Pepto-Bismol. When mixed with sugar and dried, it is a potentially entertaining source of triboluminescence, for example by crushing Wint-O-Green Life Savers in a dark room. When crushed, sugar crystals emit light; methyl salicylate amplifies the spark because it fluoresces, absorbing ultraviolet light and re-emitting it in the visible spectrum. It is used as an antiseptic in Listerine mouthwash produced by the Johnson &amp; Johnson company. It provides fragrance to various products and as an odor-masking agent for some organophosphate pesticides.

Methyl salicylate is also used as a bait for attracting male orchid bees for study, which apparently gather the chemical to synthesize pheromones, and to clear plant or animal tissue samples of color, and as such is useful for microscopy and immunohistochemistry when excess pigments obscure structures or block light in the tissue being examined. This clearing generally only takes a few minutes, but the tissue must first be dehydrated in alcohol. It has also been discovered that methyl salicylate works as a kairomone that attracts some insects, such as the spotted lanternfly. Unlike some other kairomone&#x27;s, Methyl Salicylate attracts all stages of the spotted lanternflies life. 

Other niche uses include:

* as a simulant or surrogate for the research of chemical warfare agent sulfur mustard, due to its similar chemical and physical properties;
* restoring (at least temporarily) the elastomeric properties of old rubber rollers, especially in printers;
* as a transfer agent in printmaking (to release toner from photocopied images and apply them to other surfaces);
* as a historical substitute for cedar oil as an immersion oil in microscopy, given its refractive index (1.538) being close to that of crown glass (1.515) and being less prone to drying than cedar oil;
* as a penetrating oil to loosen rusted parts.

==Safety and toxicity==
Methyl salicylate is potentially deadly, especially for young children who may accidentally ingest preparations containing methyl salicylate, such as an essential oil solution. A single teaspoon (5 mL) of methyl salicylate contains approximately 6 g of salicylate, which is equivalent to almost twenty 300 mg aspirin tablets (5mL × 1.174g/mL = 5.87g). Toxic ingestions of salicylates typically occur with doses of approximately 150 mg/kg body weight. This can be achieved with 1 mL of oil of wintergreen, which equates to 140mg/kg of salicylates for a 10kg child (22lbs). The lowest published lethal dose is 101 mg/kg body weight in adult humans, (or 7.07 grams for a 70 kg adult). It has proven fatal to small children in doses as small as 4 mL. A seventeen-year-old cross-country runner at Notre Dame Academy on Staten Island died in April 2007 after her body absorbed methyl salicylate through excessive use of topical muscle-pain relief products (using multiple patches against the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions).

Most instances of human toxicity due to methyl salicylate are a result of overapplication of topical analgesics, especially involving children. Salicylate, the major metabolite of methyl salicylate, may accumulate in blood, plasma or serum which may help professionals to confirm a diagnosis of poisoning in hospitalized patients or to assist in an autopsy.

<text>Cockney Wanker is a character created by Graham Dury and Simon Thorpe in &quot;Viz&quot; based on a stereotyped male Cockney. Wanker speaks in rhyming slang (often slang invented by the writers) and spends his days drinking and selling stolen or unworkable goods to passers-by from an East End market stall. Another of Wanker&#x27;s specialities is trading used cars. Playing upon the stereotype of the indigenous population of London being fantasists, Wanker often buys a car, sells it back to the same person for the same amount of money, then declares the transaction to have been &quot;A nice little earner!&quot; He wears cheap gold jewellery or Argos bling and &#x27;Laahndan&#x27; gangster dark glasses, and is often seen smoking a cigar.

He is a wife-beater and lifelong racist who complains about &quot;Sooties&quot;, yet respects Frank Bruno. He is established as a royalist, especially supportive of the Queen Mother, spouting received wisdom such as &quot;Ninety Free she is. Ninety Free. Wahn the bladdy war for us she did!&quot;

Wanker&#x27;s appearance is based on a combination of a stereotypical London taxi driver and Mike Reid&#x27;s character Frank Butcher from &quot;EastEnders&quot;. His characterisation also draws elements from David Jason&#x27;s &quot;Del Trotter&quot; in &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot;. Other characters in the strip closely resemble &quot;EastEnders&quot; characters, e.g. Shirl, his long suffering and battered wife (Kathy Beale) and Lou, Shirl&#x27;s fearsome old-school East End mother (Lou Beale).

<doc id="856552" wikidata="Q2107722" url="?curid=856552" title="Pram (band)">
<text>Pram are an English post-rock band formed in Birmingham in 1988 by singer-keyboardist Rosie Cuckston, guitarist Matt Eaton, drummer Andy Weir and bassist Samantha Owen. 

Subsequent lineups have changed frequently, most notably with Cuckston&#x27;s departure in 2008. Their electronic pop sound, described by AllMusic as &quot;equally quaint and unsettling,&quot; employs unconventional instruments and draws on stylistic influences such as krautrock, exotica, and dub.

The group signed to Too Pure Records in 1993, where they released their debut LP &quot;The Stars Are So Big, The Earth Is So Small... Stay as You Are&quot;. They later signed to Domino. Following the 2007 album &quot;The Moving Frontier&quot;, they took a lengthy hiatus, returning in 2018 with &quot;Across the Meridian&quot;.

==History==
===Early years===
Rosie Cuckston, Matt Eaton and Andy Weir grew up together attending Harrogate Grammar School in Harrogate, North Yorkshire. In the late 1980s Cuckston and Eaton moved to Birmingham to study at Birmingham Polytechnic (now Birmingham City University), where Cuckston met Shropshire-born Samantha &quot;Sam&quot; Owen by chance (at a local supermarket&#x27;s Singles Night). Weir had moved to London to study art, but kept in touch: in the meantime, Cuckston and Eaton played together in bands and got as far as recording in commercial studios, but Eaton would later recall that &quot;the process didn’t lend itself to diversity and experimentation.&quot; In 1988, Weir reunited with the other three and they began playing music together in Birmingham under the temporary name Hole (at that point, performing solely with vocals and a homemade theremin).

Some time later Hole changed their name to Pram, with Cuckston singing and playing keyboards, Eaton mostly playing guitar, Weir drumming, and Owen playing bass guitar. A little later the group added a fifth member, Leeds Grammar School-educated Max Simpson, on keyboard and sampler. Over time, the various band members introduced their multi-instrumental skills to the project. Sam Owen and Matt Eaton frequently shared bass guitar and six-string guitar roles (as well as adding to the keyboards), while Owen also performed on various woodwind and reed instruments as well as singing backing vocals. The band were also quick to incorporate unusual instruments, including toys, into their sound - their performance and recording armoury included the theremin, a zither, a toy piano, a glass hammer, a glockenspiel, and a Hawaiian bubble machine.

Pram&#x27;s name emphasised their unearthly, childlike tone and presentation, with Rosie Cuckston&#x27;s eerie vocals and lyrics dealing with depression, loneliness and the dark side of childhood. The band&#x27;s early recordings had a Krautrock-influenced blend of rhythmic guitar, keyboards and percussion which would eventually see them associated with the emerging post-rock genre, as would other elements of their work (although the band have rejected the label). The band was also inspired by multimedia and by memories of broadcast material: Sam Owen has commented that &quot;in some ways film, animation, children&#x27;s TV, &quot;Play for Today&quot; and public information broadcasts all lodged their spirit into our songs as much as the music we listened to.&quot;.

In 2011, Matt Eaton recalled &quot;there was never any discussion at that time what the group would sound like. We appropriated some of the working methods of Can and Faust... if a piece had a similarity/reminded someone of another work it was generally rejected. The emphasis was on new. We were inspired a lot by groups like The Slits, and especially The Raincoats. They invented their own ways of playing music - that&#x27;s a surefire way towards artistic fulfilment.&quot; Other cited influences on the nascent Pram included Sonic Youth, Pixies, My Bloody Valentine, The Fall, Big Black, The Residents and Alice Coltrane as well as various dub and bhangra artists.

===Too Pure years===

Pram&#x27;s first mini-LP, &quot;Gash&quot; was self-released on their own label &#x27;Howl Records&#x27; and sold by mail order and at gigs. While much harsher and more immediate than the band&#x27;s subsequent recordings, it presented them as an inventive and dedicated experimental band and got them early attention from record labels.

Pram&#x27;s growing reputation soon engaged the interest of Too Pure Records (then home to Stereolab, Mouse on Mars and PJ Harvey). Signing to Too Pure in 1993, Pram embarked on the release of several increasingly sophisticated recordings, the first of which was the &quot;Iron Lung EP&quot;.

Andy Weir left shortly after the release of the EP and was replaced as drummer by Daren Garratt, who would perform on all subsequent recordings until the dawn of the new millennium. This new line-up gelled instantly and would write, record and mix the band&#x27;s debut album, 1993&#x27;s &quot;The Stars Are So Big, The Earth Is So Small... Stay as You Are&quot; in time to meet their agreed, scheduled September release date. During the recording sessions, a trumpeter (credited only as &quot;The Verdigris Horn&quot;) also joined the band and played on several album tracks, including the quarter-hour &quot;In Dreams You Too Can Fly&quot;.

In April 1994, Pram released the &quot;Meshes&quot; EP, which was followed in September by their second album &quot;Helium&quot;. This record featured increasing use of the sampler. Pram&#x27;s subsequent recordings began to show a marked interest in exotica.

Although their third album, 1995&#x27;s &quot;Sargasso Sea&quot;, was awarded a rating of 0/10 when reviewed by the &quot;NME&quot; (which Pram took as a compliment), the band continued to gain momentum and popularity. Despite this, the band&#x27;s sales were insufficient to save their business relationship with Too Pure, and the label dropped the band in late 1995. Pram have acknowledged that, despite the end of the business relationship, the label had always respected their artistic integrity and let them be themselves.

===Between labels===
For a couple of years, Pram performed and recorded without a long-term record deal. Their first release during this period was a 1995 self-released cassette compilation of early demos and live recordings called &quot;Perambulations&quot;.

The band&#x27;s next EP, &quot;Music for Your Movies&quot;, was released in November 1996 through Stereolab&#x27;s label Duophonic Records. It was followed by the vinyl-only &quot;Omnichord/Sixty Years of Telephony&quot; single on the small independent label Wurlitzer Jukebox Records. Another non-album single, &quot;The Last Astronaut&quot;, was released in 1997 on the Kooky label. Also in 1997, the band expanded and reissued their debut EP &quot;Gash&quot; as a full-length album on the æ label, adding five tracks from &quot;Perambulations&quot; and doubling the length.

Pram&#x27;s lineup changed several times during this period. A theremin player known only as &quot;The Colonel&quot; joined the band in 1996, bringing his own home-made theremin with him. By late 1997, Daren Garratt would be replaced on drums by Mark Butterworth, although pre-recorded material with Daren would continue to feature on records for the following two years. Former Long Fin Killie drummer Dave Turner would also have a stint with the band.

===Domino years, Part 1===
By 1998, Pram had found a new home at Domino Records (distributed by Merge Records in the USA). Their fourth album, &quot;North Pole Radio Station&quot; (which had originally been recorded for release on Wurlitzer Jukebox before the label shut down) was released on Domino in March 1998. A related EP called &quot;Sleepy Sweet&quot; was released the following August.

In 1998, Pram recorded the soundtrack to Martin Davies of bolexbrothers 10-minute animated film &quot;Keep in a Dry Place and Away From Children&quot; and in 1999, they released it as an EP, including a remix by Mouse on Mars. 
Also in 1999, Domino collected various single and EP tracks from the previous two years and compiled them on the &quot;Telemetric Melodies&quot; compilation. These were the final recordings to feature Daren Garratt on drums (with the notable exceptions of the &quot;Last Astronaut&quot; 7&quot;, the &quot;Sleepy Sweet&quot; EP and around half of the tracks on the &quot;North Pole Radio Station&quot; album).

By 2000, three new members had joined Pram - former Broadcast drummer Steve Perkins, multi-instrumentalist Nick Sales (of the long-running Birmingham performance art group Blissbody) and trumpeter Alex Clare. All three performed on the band&#x27;s fifth album, &quot;The Museum of Imaginary Animals&quot; which was released in 2000. The album featured the single &quot;The Owl Service&quot;, named after the Alan Garner book of the same name.

The &quot;Somniloquy&quot; LP was released in 2001, featuring both new tracks and remixes of various recent album tracks and singles. Remix contributors were Andy Votel, fellow Brummie experimentalists Plone and Tele:funken (the latter credited as &quot;Terry Funken&quot;).

===Domino years, Part 2===
Pram&#x27;s sixth album - 2003&#x27;s &quot;Dark Island&quot; - proved to be more of a breakthrough in terms of the band&#x27;s profile. One of its songs, &quot;Track of the Cat&quot;, was used on a BT Group advert. A remix of &quot;Simon from Sydney/Untitled 2&quot;, commissioned by Warp Records, was used on Volkswagen&#x27;s &quot;30 years in the Making&quot; advertising campaign. By now, the band&#x27;s lineup had changed again. While Steve Perkins had drummed on three tracks on &quot;Dark Island&quot;, he was replaced during the sessions by Laurence Hunt. Trumpeter Hannah Baines (of Misty&#x27;s Big Adventure) was briefly a member of the band for live performances in 2003. In spite of the relatively greater success of &quot;Dark Island&quot;, Pram did not release a new album for another four years.

In 2004, &quot;NME&quot; finally reversed their previous scathing opinion of Pram by tipping them as the next big band to watch out for.

In 2006, trombonist Harry Dawes (who also played theremin and stylophone) joined the band. By this time, both Sales and Clare had left for other projects.

In September 2007 Pram released their seventh studio album &quot;The Moving Frontier&quot;. It was named number 7 in &quot;Wire&quot; Magazine&#x27;s Top Ten records of the year. A remix EP based on various &quot;Moving Frontier&quot; tracks, &quot;Prisoner of the Seven Pines&quot;, followed in 2008 as did a full self-released collection of the band&#x27;s visual work (short films, music videos and animations), collated on a limited edition 90-minute DVD called &quot;Shadow Shows of the Phantascope&quot; These would be the band&#x27;s last commercial releases for a decade.

===Release hiatus/work in other artistic areas===

Following the release of &quot;Prisoner of the Seven Pines&quot; and &quot;Shadow Shows of the Phantascope&quot;, Rosie Cuckston permanently left the band in 2008 to concentrate on academia (and, later, politics). Partly as a consequence of this, Pram went into a period of dormancy (as far as commercial releases were concerned) for almost a decade. The remaining band members worked on other projects, both separately and together.

In 2010 and 2001, Pram collaborated with visual artist &quot;Film Ficciones&quot; (filmmaker Scott Johnston) on a large scale multi platform show that used early cinematic techniques, shadow-play, theater and a live musical performance in silhouette to soundtrack a three-screen film produced by Johnston and the band. The piece &quot;Shadow Shows&quot; premiered at Supersonic Festival Birmingham, touring to Germany and then headlining the closing day of the Edinburgh International Film Festival in 2011.
In 2012 the group recorded a series of experimental works at Jochen Hans Irmler&#x27;s Klangbad Studio, with the intention of releasing a new LP of experimental works.

As Pram, the group conducted workshops in sound art and field recording, producing as yet unreleased work that was performed live in 2016.

Now working as a semi-instrumental project, with an increased interest in film and site-specific work, the band performed at the Imaginary Musics festival in Switzerland in May 2017 (playing an audio-visual &quot;Music for Kopfkino&quot; set) and at a combined sound-art installation and concert (&#x27;Under the Blossom That Hangs On The Bough&#x27;) in Birmingham&#x27;s Martineau Gardens as part of the for-Wards project and festival for June 2017.

===Return to album releases===

In 2018 Pram released a new album, &quot;Across the Meridian&quot;, on Domino Records (with Sam Owen now handling vocals). The album was launched at a Club Integrale Midlands concert at the Edge, on 20 July 2018, followed by concerts at The Lexington, London, on 22 July and the Soup Kitchen, Manchester, on 26 July (with Fliss Kitson of The Nightingales playing drums).

During 2019 the band were working on further editing and arranging for the 2012 Klangbad Studio session recordings.

==Work as remixers==
Pram have remixed LFO and the Aphex Twin for the Warp Records 10th anniversary compilation. They have also remixed a song for the Indian singer Mohammed Rafi.

==Outside band activities==
Rosie Cuckston recorded songs with Lætitia Sadier as Monade in the late 90s. She appeared on their &quot;M Is The Thirteenth Letter/Monade&quot; and &quot;Split&quot; singles.

Matt Eaton produces his own music under the name &#x27;Micronormous&#x27; and has released a number of tracks on compilation albums - in Autumn 2009 he was reporting as working on an album for Warm Circuit records (home of the Modified Toy Orchestra). Eaton also DJs with Mark Cancellara (ex-Plone) at Silver Dollar, a reggae club in Birmingham.

Sam Owen and Max Simpson record and perform their own work as &#x27;Moths of the Moon&#x27;. Their first mini-LP &#x27;Another Place&#x27; was released in July 2021 on Ondes Positives Recordings.

<text>A utility bicycle, city bicycle, urban bicycle, European city bike (ECB), Dutch bike, classic bike or simply city-bike is a bicycle designed for frequent very short, relatively slow rides through very flat urban areas. It is a form of utility bicycle commonly seen around the world, built to facilitate everyday short-distance riding (no more than 5-6 km a day) in normal clothes in cold-to-mild weather conditions. It is therefore a bicycle designed for very short-range practical transportation, as opposed to those primarily for recreation and competition, such as touring bicycles, road bicycles, and mountain bicycles. Utility bicycles are the most common form globally, and comprise the vast majority found in the developing world. City bikes may be individually owned or operated as part of a public bike sharing scheme.

Generally as they are more suitable for urban environments, they focus more on short-distance comfort and practicality instead of speed or efficiency. They normally have a slightly curved, roughly planar aligned and elevated handlebar, providing users an upright sitting position. They have fewer gears and they often are heavier than road bicycles. They might have the top central frame bar diagonally aligned for allowing easy mounting in and out and they might have a back or front frame for transport of items. The saddle is typically larger compared with other bicycles and the majority are provided with chain and tire protection against oil or dirt.

==History==
Bicycles have been promoted for their utilitarian strengths since before they were technically known as bicycles. The dandy horse and the boneshaker were hoped to become an inexpensive utilitarian alternative to horses by their makers. However the inherent danger, cost, discomfort, and restrictive gender roles of the day, kept it popular mainly with wealthy adventurous young men, and mainly for recreation and sport. The development of penny-farthing moved away from the utilitarian goal of earlier forms, with its less stable ride, and difficulty carrying much baggage. It furthered the trend of bicycles to be used by young men, willing to take risks, for sport and recreation. Despite this, we find the earliest mention of working bikes in 1874, in Paris, as couriers, for a newspaper and the stock market riding penny-farthings.

It was the introduction of the safety bicycle that was successful for the first time to build a bicycle that worked well for utilitarian purposes, &quot;a poor man&#x27;s nag&quot;. It was this development that was the cause of the bicycle boom of the 1890s. The main use of bicycles during the boom was still sport and recreation, but additionally they were adopted by many professions such as police, postal workers, delivery men, municipal workers and for basic transportation of people of all classes, races, and genders. In the US, after the boom, use changed dramatically from sport and recreation to basic transportation. By 1902, as the boom was coming to an end, nearly all cyclists were cycling for practical purposes. The price of bicycles dropped dramatically, due to increased competition between makers and more price conscious consumers; profits dried up and many of the cycling manufacturers went out of business. The history is similar in the UK, but there some of the manufacturers were better able to handle the transition to transportation based cycling, even to the point of talking of a second boom due to so many working-class people taking up cycling. Additionally the British makers were able to tap into the developing markets overseas, primarily India, China, and Japan. In countries like the US, the use of utility bicycles all but disappeared until after the Second World War, when a few British and Italian roadster-type bicycles saw a brief upsurge in popularity. Since the Second World War, utility bicycles have remained popular in countries like the Netherlands, China, and much of the developing world.

===Technological improvements===
Since the 1890s only incremental mechanical advances have taken place for the majority of the world&#x27;s utility bicycles. In fact many bicycles in Asia still employ rod brakes. One exception to this was the continued development of substitute propulsion systems for utility bicycles in the form of add-on gasoline engines and transmissions. Developed shortly after 1900 in Europe and the United States, motorized utility bicycles surged in popularity in Western Europe after the Second World War. Typically, a small one or two-horsepower, two-cycle engine was fitted with a tire roller-drive mechanism that would convert any standard utility roadster into a motorised bicycle. As they could still be propelled by human power, they were considered as bicycles under most national registration schemes. The motorised utility bicycle or &quot;cyclemotor&quot; offered greater range, faster commutes, and increased versatility to a large sector of the postwar European consumer market that could not afford expensive automobiles or motorcycles.

In 1962, the advent of the Moulton bicycle brought a fresh outlook to the traditional utility concept. Using small, easily transportable frames and wheels as well as suspension, the Moulton was designed to accommodate the increasing public usage of bicycles in concert with other forms of mass transportation. During the 1990s, several bicycle designs were introduced in an attempts to improve on the traditional utility bike. Most of these centered on the use of lightweight frame alloys, new brake and gearing systems, and electronic navigation and monitoring assistance.

== Use ==
Utility bicycles are principally used for short-distance commuting, running errands, shopping, leisure or for transporting goods or merchandise. Utility bicycles may also be seen in postal service, in war, and for employee transportation inside large workplaces (factories, warehouses, airports, movie studio lots, etc.). In some countries, entire fleets of utility bicycles may be operated or administered by local or national government agencies as part of a public bike sharing programme.

The utility bicycle is the most widely used form of bicycle in many undeveloped parts of the world. While motor vehicles have displaced bicycles for personal transportation in many industrialized and post-industrial nations, rising fuel costs and concerns over the environment have led many people to once again turn to utility bicycles for a variety of daily tasks. In countries where purpose-built utility bikes are unavailable or unsuited to local conditions, many cyclists have acquired hybrid bicycles, road bicycles, mountain bikes, or touring bicycles for commuting and general utility use, often refurbishing older or secondhand models. A few countries, notably China, India, Japan, Netherlands, Denmark and the Flemish Region of Belgium, continue to produce versions of the utility bike. In addition, the Deutsche Post uses a version of a utility bike in most German cities for delivering mail.

==Design==
Utility bicycles often feature a step-through frame so they can be easily mounted, single speed, or with internal hub gearing, and drum brakes to reduce the need for maintenance, mudguards to keep the rider&#x27;s clothing clean, a chain guard to prevent skirts or loose trousers from being caught in the chain, a skirt guard to prevent a long coat or skirt catching in the rear wheel or brakes, a center stand kickstand so it can be parked easily, and a basket or pannier rack to carry personal possessions or shopping bags.

A traditional type of utility bicycle, the roadster may weigh as much as 16–23 kg (35 to 50 lbs). Parts such as frames, wheels/rims, and tires are chosen for strength, safety, and durability rather than high performance. Additionally, utility bikes tend to incorporate fewer technological advances in material design and engineering in comparison to road bicycles, though there are exceptions. In particular, the small-tired Moulton portable utility cycles incorporate advanced engineering with slightly lighter weight.

Most utility bikes feature an upright riding position. The handlebars are almost always curved back and positioned higher than the saddle so that the rider can operate controls without changing their riding posture. The saddle is also placed right above the rear wheel axle instead of the bottom bracket, which makes it more difficult to pedal. Some people add a child seat or a trailer. The utility bike&#x27;s combination of parts, design, and features provide functionality and (short-distance) comfort at the expense of weight, an adequate compromise when used as originally intended (local commuting and short rides).

===&quot;Stadsfiets&quot; as a defining term===
The Dutch has the full set of features commonly incorporated into a utility bicycle. The Dutch words and mean &#x27;bicycle&#x27; and &#x27;city bicycle&#x27;, respectively. A is considered to be a fully outfitted European city bike, distinguished by the following typical features: upright riding position, fully enclosed chaincase, skirtguard, O-lock, hub gearing, dynamo hub, manually operated small warning bell, and built-in lights.

German and Dutch versions of the European city bike are similar, though there are differences.

The &quot;English roadster&quot; is similar in design, appearance, and intended use. The primary differences are that the continental bicycles tend to have a higher handlebar position for a more upright riding posture, and are more likely to have rod-actuated drum brakes. Because of Great Britain&#x27;s cultural and trading influence in its former colonies, the roadster can still be seen in local production and use in many countries of the world.

===Traditional vs. contemporary design===
A traditional-styled European city bike includes a frame made of low-carbon high-tensile steel, black paint with chromed accessories, an opaque skirtguard, bottle dynamo, simple dynamo-powered lights, and either a single-speed or 3-speed internally geared hub.

Contemporary city bikes are increasingly found in many European cities, including Amsterdam and Copenhagen. Dutch and Danish-made city bikes often include such features as a clear skirt guard, colors other than black, aluminum alloy or chromoly steel frame, front suspension fork, suspension seatpost, Hub dynamo, dynamo lighting with motion-and-darkness detection, magnetic lights, a 7- or 8-speed hub, adjustable kickstand, child seats, and a headlight integrated into the front fork. Newer German models, on the other hand, tend to incorporate a &quot;less is more&quot; philosophy.

===Suitability compared to hybrid or commuter bikes===
The suitability and availability of fully outfitted city bikes depends on multiple factors, including local terrain, city density, car traffic, weather, and bicycle infrastructure. Traditional European city bikes are optimized for short-distance, frequent transportation over flat terrain in urban settings. However, such bikes are also used in hilly Switzerland—although they&#x27;re an extremely rare sighte there, due to their heavier weight and inefficient geometry—, including Basel and Bern, where 23% and 15% of daily trips are made by bicycle respectively.

A fully outfitted European city bike or heavy utility roadster typically weighs 16–23 kg (35–50 lbs), compared with 6–10 kg (14–22 lbs) for the average road racing bike and 10–13 kg (22–29 lbs) for the typical modern mountain bike, touring bicycle, or hybrid city bike, commuter, or cross bike. A steel-frame European city bike with hub gear, chain case, and other features is heavier and more difficult to ride uphill than a road bike. A steel-frame bike is more cumbersome to carry and store, so it might not be the best choice for commuters needing to transport their bicycles on public transportation nor cyclists living or working in upper floor residences. Instead, European city bikes are often locked and stored outside businesses or residences, even during inclement weather. For easier carrying and storage, makers of European city bikes provide features similar to city bikes on folding bicycles. In the Netherlands, many modern city bikes are also available with an aluminum alloy frame, significantly reducing weight to partly overcome the practical difficulties with a heavier bike.
In the United States, Americans living in cities or suburbs with many days of sunshine per year have traditionally used road racing bicycles, sport/touring bicycles, or mountain bikes for general commuting or utility purposes. For all-weather use, U.S. buyers tend to purchase substantially lighter machines than the traditional &quot;Stadsfiets&quot; or utility roadster, instead choosing hybrid city bikes or commuter bikes derived from road or mountain designs. The latter frequently employ lightweight frames and wide gear ranges for use on higher-speed roadways as well as steep terrain. To save weight, some hybrid city or commuter bikes do not usually possess many accessories, adding only fenders, a rack, and perhaps a partial chainguard, as well as front and rear lights. Their smaller bulk and lighter weight often permits them to be carried into offices and residences, an advantage in countries with extremely high rates of bicycle vandalism and theft (even of older or obsolete models with little monetary value).

Most European city bikes are designed to withstand year-round outdoor storage, even in frigid Scandinavia where daily bike usage remains high year-round. Thus, European city bikes need not always be brought indoors and can be left outside, properly locked. To deter theft and vandalism, the European city bike has a tougher frame, non-quick-release seat and wheels, and a rear-wheel lock. To prevent theft or vandalism, it is ideal to bring the bike indoors, but this is not always possible in dense cities with compact living quarters.

===Lightweight variants===
Much like the English &quot;sports roadster&quot;, a lighter-weight variant of the contemporary utility bicycle adheres to the same general approach to bike design and use, but saves weight and increases efficiency by using:

* Caliper brakes instead of hub brakes
* Derailleurs rather than hub gearing
* A battery-based lighting system rather than a hub dynamo system
* Carbon front fork
* Aluminum rims and hubs, with fewer spokes
* Light plastic or webbing skirt guard, or no skirtguard
* No suspended seat or fork

The lightweight European city bike is a popular model for Dutch brands such as Batavus and Gazelle, where high levels of bicycle use result in demand for higher performance city bicycles, which is otherwise similar to the fully outfitted typical European city bike. This is sometimes marketed as a &quot;sports&quot; variant of the latter.

==Typical features==

===Angled-back handlebars===

A European city bike has angled-back handlebars and an upright riding position. The handlebars, similar to the North Road style handlebars, have a moderate rise and are swept back toward the body, enabling a fully upright posture similar to a person walking. The rider is easily visible to other traffic and can easily see traffic and hazards.

The handlebar&#x27;s shape allows shopping bags, locks, and other items to be hung from the bars without slipping off. This reduces steering control, but that is compensated by the more stable geometry of the frame and forks.

===Hub gearing===
A hub gear is an important feature of a European city bike. A hub gear system provides greater ease-of-use than a derailleur system due to the ability to change gear stationary, smooth changes, the ability to provide a wide range of ratios, and the requirement of little maintenance.

A geared hub requires only one shifter rather than two, thus is easier to use than the pair of derailleurs which provide a greater number of speeds to sporting bicycles that need them. A European city bike or roadster typically has 3, 5, 7, 8 or 11 speeds. In a few high-end models, a Rohloff 14-speed geared hub is available. Batavus makes several models of full-featured city bikes that have a NuVinci hub with continuously variable drive ratio. The NuVinci has nearly the same range as an 8-speed hub (around 300%), selectable at any ratio within the range. With most bikes, the bicycle gearing may be scaled up or down as needed, for example by installing a smaller chainring in front and/or larger sprocket in back to facilitate climbing.

Hub gearing permits the use of a fully enclosed chaincase, which minimizes the need for maintenance. A hub gear has lower efficiency than a clean, properly adjusted derailleur system, but retains its efficiency without conscientious cleaning and adjustment. A hub gear system is heavier than a derailleur system. In a hub gear system, the main moving parts are enclosed, making repair more difficult than with a derailleur system. If a geared hub fails, it is sometimes more economical to replace the hub than attempt to repair it.

===Stable geometry===
A curved fork and angled vertical tubing provides stable, non-twitchy steering, enabling the rider to ride with one hand, while freeing the other hand for signalling or to secure a load on the rear rack. Europeans commonly use the free hand to hold an umbrella or cell phone, or to hold the shoulder of a child riding their own bike, to train the child for positioning on the road. A coaster brake further enables such one-handed riding, because the one hand on the handlebar only has to steer, not also brake.

A stable European city bike enables securely travelling along in a position that is as upright as walking; it feels stable and relaxed, like walking very fast. A safe city bike needs to be capable of easily turning without falling over, and needs to be capable of moving reliably with shopping bags and a lock hanging from the handlebars.

===Hub dynamo, automatic lights and magnetic lights===
A hub dynamo enables a built-in lighting system without the loud noise and high drag of a bottle (sidewall) dynamo, and without the unreliability, high cost, ecological disposal problem, and maintenance inherent with batteries. The hub dynamo powers LED or halogen front and rear lights. The lights have a built-in reflector. The taillight is mounted cleanly on the rear rack or fender. A built-in reflector in the headlight and taillight surrounds or is adjacent to the LED or light bulb. Built-in lights stay on point, i.e., need no adjustments.

The latest systems include a capacitor-powered standlight, powered for a few minutes by a capacitor. This prevents the lights from going out as soon as the bike speed drops to less than a few kilometers per hour; this evens out the amount of light at various speeds, sustaining the light at lower speeds.

The latest systems include automatic switching based on darkness+motion detection. This prevents having to reach to physically position a bottle dynamo or consume set-up time; this enables ready, guaranteed lighting regardless of the daylight conditions. A three-position switch has positions for Off, On, and Auto. A hub dynamo prevents the usage-overhead and preparation time of attaching the headlight and taillight to the bike prior to using the bike, and prevents having to remove the headlight and taillight and carry them while the bicycle is parked in public. A built-in light system avoids a failing battery lamp and prevents getting a ticket and fine from having no lights at night.

Many Danish bikes feature lights powered through electromagnetic induction. The lights are mounted on the bike wheels, eliminating the need for batteries while incurring less resistance to the rider than traditional dynamos.

===Front suspension with built-in headlight===
A front suspension fork is common on high-end, contemporary-styled European city bikes. This is often a coil/oil or air/oil suspension fork with adjustable compression and rebound. A traditional roadster has no front suspension, or a spring-based front suspension that has more limited travel and adjustability.

Some high-end models integrate the headlight into the front fork and fender assembly. This discourages vandalism, protects the wiring, and reduces the number of external wires and cables.

===O-lock===

A built-in O-lock is a type of bicycle lock that prevents ride-off theft, establishes ownership, secures the back wheel to the frame (which can be separately locked), and provides a lock and slot for a cable. An O-lock is also called a ring lock or wheel lock.

The O-lock facilitates outdoor parking, by reducing the risk that someone can steal the bike by quickly riding off on it. An O-lock is lightweight and unobtrusive. It can be locked very quickly and conveniently, such as when parking the bike outside a store while running errands.

The O-lock also serves as a deterrent to ownership disputes, as the person who has the O-lock key is proven to be the owner of the bike. More recent O-locks have a slot to attach an armored cable, allowing a cyclist to lock the frame, wheels, and seat.

O-locks provide a limited degree of security, like all locks. The greatest security requires using multiple types of locks together. In Copenhagen and Japan, the O-lock is generally used alone; the bikes are insured against theft and the owner must show that they have the key, to demonstrate that the bike was locked. The key can only be removed by locking the lock. In other locations, the O-lock is used along with locking the frame to a secure object, or the O-lock is used alone when the owner is very close by, to prevent ride-off theft.

===Skirt guard===
A skirt guard (or coatguard) allows using the bike with normal clothes, for both the main rider and a passenger riding on the back rack. The skirt guard helps enable riding in cold and rain because it allows easy use of a coat, cloak, dress, skirt, scarf, or luggage; winter biking becomes possible in conjunction with wearing more clothing and using a skirtguard and chaincase. It also enables transporting various materials on the rack without getting caught in the spokes.

A skirtguard prevents winter or flowing spring clothing from getting caught in the area where many features converge: the back brake, O-lock, and spokes. The skirtguard and O-lock form an integrated system. The O-lock catches clothing, so the skirtguard is needed to compensate. The O-lock passes through a hole in the skirt guard. The traditional, old-fashioned city bike has a solid (opaque) fabric skirt guard, while the contemporary European city bike has a clear plastic guard.

===Fully enclosed chain guard===
A fully enclosed chain guard and mudguards protect against oil or dirt. Chaincase enables using the bike with normal clothes and no preparation activity, such as wearing trouser clips or rolling up a trouser leg. A full guard prevents oil stains on clothes, and keeps trouser legs from getting caught in the chain or front chainring. While newer designs may use a partial chain guard, the latter still permits the chain to occasionally catch and stain loose trouser legs if not secured.

A full chain guard also keeps the drive train (chain and external gears) clean and efficient by excluding water, mud, and grit which can otherwise splash onto the chain and front chainring, increase wear, and reduce drivetrain efficiency. To repair a rear flat tire, a fully enclosed chain guard must be partially disassembled to remove the back wheel, or the tire must be repaired in-place without removing the wheel.

===Full fenders with mudguard flaps===
The fenders are aluminium or plastic, sometimes with a taillight affixed to the bottom of the back fender. The fairly low bottom of the back fender reduces road grime splashing up to a cyclist who is following behind. Integrated fenders designed into the bike provide a clean, safe attachment, and match the bike frame.

===Enclosed drum brakes===
Enclosed drum brakes or a rear coaster brake are used on most European city bikes, rather than rim brakes. A bike with drum brakes is optimized for stopping in wet weather: in wet weather, drum brakes provide more stopping power and reliability than rim brakes; but in dry weather, less.

Enclosed drum brakes require infrequent maintenance, compared to rim brakes or disc brakes, and are more durable than disc brakes, which are exposed.

Drum brakes are best suited for slower, moderate use, rather than longer periods of hard downhill braking while carrying a load. Under such heavy braking, drum brakes are reported to sometimes fade, losing stopping power, while rim brakes can overheat the rim and cause a tire blowout. A common model of drum brake is the Shimano Rollerbrake, which includes a mechanism to prevent the drum brake from suddenly catching and grabbing more than intended.

Drum brakes are heavier than rim brakes.

===Luggage carrier===
A Dutch convention is to carry a passenger on the back rack, the passenger balancing side-saddle. The sturdy rack supports passenger weight, to carry a passenger and sustain a launch without collapsing. A standard strap assembly attaches cleanly to the rack, providing useful transport capability. There are standard notches for a strap assembly with 2 to 4 elastic straps. The rack is integrated into the bike design; the taillight is usually mounted on the back of the rack.

Danish bikes are usually equipped with a back rack with a spring-loaded clamp.

===Tires and wheels===
Tires are puncture-resistant for travelling without a pump and tools to fix a flat tire. Width is normally medium to wide 38–44 mm (1.5-1.75 inches), providing a balance of speed with durability and cushioning. These are semi-slick road tires with shallow tread, such as Schwalbe Marathon tires. Such tires are faster and quieter than mountain-bike tires, and more durable and reliable than road-racing tires. Reflective bands on the sidewalls make the wheels visible as wheels, not just as small reflectors. This makes the bike more visible from side at night by cars without using reflective clothing and extra lights.

Large 710 mm (28″) 700 B or 700 C wheels are typical, providing a smoother ride than 660 mm (26″) wheels. On traditional Dutch city bikes, extremely thick spokes add carrying strength. To discourage theft, the front and back wheels use axle bolts instead of quick-releases. European city bikes are used in bike-friendly areas for short distances with sturdy tires. These features are suited to riding without tools or quick-release wheels.

===Platform pedals===
The platform pedals allow use with normal shoes.

===Saddle===
The saddle is typically moderately broad, softly cushioned, and is often suspended. A non-quick-release seat prevents having to lock or remove the seat to prevent theft. These features allow an increase in comfort considering the erect position. Some saddles further have a longitudinal slot, to avoid perineal pressure. Besides avoiding perineal pressure, these slots avoid sit bone pain, and saddle sores.

===Single, dual or adjustable kickstand===
A kickstand is present, and is often dual-leg or a center-stand for stability while the bike is carrying children or a load. Alternately, an adjustable-length kickstand enables parking regardless of the slope and load. A kickstand allows a bicycle to stand in any flat or slope surface without the need of an external stand or support.

===Other features===
A bell is standard equipment for bikes in Europe, and is required by law in some European countries, such as Denmark, Poland and Germany. Additional features are available, such as front and rear bicycle reflectors, baskets, child seats and a windshield.

==Media and politics==
In 1997, then President of the United States Bill Clinton was given a European city bike named &quot;City Bike One&quot; as a memento of his visit to Copenhagen, Denmark.

<text>Broadcast were an English band formed in Birmingham in 1995 by Trish Keenan (vocals, keyboards, guitar) and James Cargill (bass). Their musical style blended elements of 1960s psychedelia with early electronic music and samples from esoteric sources; it earned the band a cult following.

Broadcast released three studio albums—&quot;The Noise Made by People&quot; (2000), &quot;Haha Sound&quot; (2003), and &quot;Tender Buttons&quot; (referencing Gertrude Stein&#x27;s experimental book of poetry by the same name) (2005)—on Warp Records, as well as several EPs and a collaborative album with the Focus Group titled &quot;Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age&quot; (2009). Their final release as a group was &quot;Distant Call&quot;, released in 2024.

Aside from founding members Keenan and Cargill, Broadcast experienced regular lineup changes. The band has included Roj Stevens (keyboards), Tim Felton (guitar), and Steve Perkins (drums). Keith York, Phil Jenkins, Jeremy Barnes, Neil Bullock and Ash Sheehan have also featured in the band as touring or session drummers. From 2005 to 2011, Broadcast consisted only of the founding duo. Following the death of Keenan in 2011, Cargill oversaw all remaining Broadcast activity.

==History==
===1995–1999: Formation===
Keenan (formerly of folk duo Hayward Winters) and Cargill met in the mid 1990s at the Sensateria psychedelic club, and formed Pan Am Flight Bag in 1995, renamed Broadcast after several concerts.

The band&#x27;s first release in 1996, was the 7&quot; single &quot;Accidentals&quot; (issued on Wurlitzer Jukebox Records), which was written based around a sample from Joseph Losey’s 1967 film &quot;Accident&quot;. The same year, they released &quot;The Book Lovers&quot; EP (issued in November by Duophonic Records).
In 1996, the band recorded a Peel Session.

Warp released a compilation album, &quot;Work and Non Work&quot;, in June 1997, compiling the EP and two singles. The 1999 Broadcast track &quot;You Can Fall&quot; was included on the soundtrack album for the film &quot;Morvern Callar&quot;, released by Warp in 2002.

===2000–2010: Studio albums===
The group&#x27;s debut studio album, &quot;The Noise Made by People&quot;, was released by Warp in March 2000. It was self-produced in the group&#x27;s own recording studio after having been through three producers to get a particular sound. Regarding the expensive two year production of the album, Keenan said, &quot;There [were] no financial benefits in getting it right.&quot; The band issued two EPs in the same year, &quot;Extended Play&quot; and &quot;Extended Play Two&quot;.

Their second album, &quot;Haha Sound&quot;, was released in August 2003, preceded by two EPs, &quot;Microtronics Volume 01: Stereo Recorded Music for Links and Bridges&quot; and &quot;Pendulum&quot;. Recording sessions for the album took place in fragments at various locations: Keenan recorded vocal tracks with her head in a cardboard box which gave it a &quot;closeness and deadness that makes it sit in the mix a bit nicer,&quot; while drummer Bullock recorded drum tracks in a neighborhood church before overdubbing guitar tracks and additional arrangements. &quot;Haha Sound&quot; became their first charting album in the United States, reaching No. 8 in the Top Dance/Electronic Albums chart. While touring the United States to promote &quot;Haha Sound&quot;, the group recruited American drummer Jeremy Barnes to perform their live shows. Felton departed after &quot;Haha Sound&quot; to form a new project, Seeland, with touring keyboardist Billy Bainbridge (formerly of fellow Birmingham Warp act, Plone).

Broadcast&#x27;s next album, &quot;Tender Buttons&quot;, was released in September 2005. It was their first album as a duo of Keenan and Cargill. On tour, they were joined by Ash Sheehan on drums and James&#x27;s brother Bill on guitar and keyboards. A second compilation of B-sides and rarities, &quot;The Future Crayon&quot;, was issued in August 2006.

Broadcast released a collaborative album with the Focus Group (aka graphic designer and Ghost Box label co-owner Julian House) called &quot;Broadcast and the Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age&quot; in October 2009. The band was chosen by Matt Groening to perform at the All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival he curated in May 2010 in Minehead, Somerset, England.

===2011–2024: Keenan&#x27;s death and demo releases===
Keenan died on 14 January 2011 at the age of 42, following complications with pneumonia, which she suffered from after earlier contracting H1N1. Cargill, the sole remaining member, said in a 2011 interview with &quot;Under the Radar&quot; that a new Broadcast album was in the works, featuring vocals recorded by Keenan shortly before her death. He later said: &quot;Trish left a lot of tapes, four-tracks and stuff, and I&#x27;ve been going through those. It&#x27;s difficult, and I&#x27;m connected to it at the same time. It&#x27;s wonderful, but I&#x27;m also feeling a sense of loss. The next thing I release with Trish on it will be more like a monument and a tribute to her rather than this obsessive thing I used to have about making albums.&quot;

Broadcast were credited with providing the soundtrack &quot;Berberian Sound Studio&quot; for the 2012 film of the same name; the soundtrack was released 7 January 2013.

Warp Records reissued the band&#x27;s entire discography in March 2015, and announced further rare reissues from the band in 2022. In April of that year, three collections of unreleased material were released: &quot;Maida Vale Sessions&quot;, &quot;Microtronics - Volumes 1 &amp; 2&quot;, and &quot;Mother Is The Milky Way&quot;. &quot;Maida Vale Sessions&quot; is a compilation of alternate versions of released songs, recorded at Maida Vale Studios. &quot;Microtronics&quot; is an expanded collection of instrumentals originally released during 2003&#x27;s tour for Haha Sound. &quot;Mother Is The Milky Way&quot; was originally released as a limited tour-only CD to support their collaborative album &quot;Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age&quot;. It&#x27;s considered their last true release before Keenan&#x27;s death.

In 2024, Warp Records announced the release of two demo albums: &quot;Spell Blanket - Collected Demos 2006-2009&quot;, a collection of Keenan&#x27;s archive of 4-track tapes and MiniDiscs intended for the band&#x27;s follow-up to &quot;Tender Buttons&quot;, to be released in May, and &quot;Distant Call - Collected Demos 2000-2006&quot;, consisting of demos that mostly appeared in previous studio albums, in September. A demo version of &quot;Tears In The Typing Pool&quot;, a track featured on &quot;Tender Buttons&quot;, and a demo titled &quot;Follow The Light&quot; were released in March as singles from &quot;Distant Call&quot; and &quot;Spell Blanket&quot;, respectively. Following the release of &quot;Distant Call&quot; on 28 September 2024, Broadcast officially disbanded.

==Other projects==
Cargill formed the project Children of Alice with House and former Broadcast member Stevens; they released their eponymous debut album in February 2017. The group&#x27;s name is a tribute to Keenan, who had cited &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; as a main inspiration.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
&quot;FACT&quot; described Broadcast&#x27;s music as blending &quot;pop songcraft and experimentally-minded electronic music into a contemporary blend of psychedelia that resonated deeply with listeners&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; described their work as incorporating direct pop while &quot;mixing together influences such as the primitive electronics of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop, Czech surrealism, Moog organ, forgotten film soundtracks and kitsch ephemera.&quot; A mixture of electronic sounds and Keenan&#x27;s 1960s-inspired vocals, the band is heavily influenced by the 1960s American psychedelic group the United States of America, using many of the same electronic effects. The band were also known for using samples taken from both library music compilations and real-life field recordings. The band&#x27;s musical style has been variously labeled psychedelic pop, dream pop, avant-pop, and space age pop. Their preoccupation with past cultural aesthetics saw them grouped with the 2000s electronic trend known as hauntology.

Keenan said that the group &quot;[listens] to a lot of soundtracks&quot;, and in a 2007 interview, she stated that the group aspired with each album to &quot;make a soundtrack for a film that doesn&#x27;t exist.&quot; In their early years, the band was frequently compared to acts such as Portishead and Stereolab. The group&#x27;s musical output, according to journalist Mikey Jones, &quot;fused the worlds of pop songcraft and experimentally-minded electronic music into a contemporary blend of psychedelia that resonated deeply with listeners, effectively expanding the conventions of what could be considered psychedelic.&quot; Keenan&#x27;s first love had been primarily folk music, but this influence was downplayed in the early years of Broadcast due to Cargill&#x27;s initial dislike of the genre. However, it became prominent as the band&#x27;s sound became more open towards experimentation. 

Other recurrent elements in the band&#x27;s music (particularly their first two albums) were &quot;science fiction&quot; atmospheres and &quot;skewed variants&quot; of swing and jazz music, which &quot;offered a Eurocentric counterpoint to the mostly American psych innovators they’d imbibed.&quot; In a review published in &quot;Spin&quot; in 2001, the band were unfavourably likened to being &quot;stuck in a time warp–the sound of &#x27;70s wife-swapping parties with beanbags and unhappy children serving sausages on sticks.&quot;

===Equipment===
The band&#x27;s recording gear and methods were profiled in a 2003 article in &quot;Electronic Musician&quot;, in which it was noted that they recorded many of their guitar arrangements (played at that time on a 1960s Italian Eko Edsel) through microphones, rather than through a DI unit.
Additional instruments, including the vibraphone, timpani, clarinets and organ were recorded and subsequently fed through a speaker again in order to be re-recorded with microphones. Their private studio setup included an AKG BX-15, a Fostex rackmount coil reverb amplifier and an Acutronics tray (originally sourced from a Fender amplifier.) Their recording setup also included a MOTU 2408 hard-disk recording system, an Apple Mac G4, a Fender Rhodes, a Vox Continental and a Korg MS-20.

For digital production, the band sometimes used an reFX QuadraSid emulator and Native Instruments Reaktor. Commenting on the production of their third album, &quot;Haha Sound&quot;, Keenan said: &quot;You know when it feels overworked. We used more of a minimalist approach on this album: There has been less emphasis on decoration and more on repetitive parts that go through the tracks. They are not the focus for your ear, but they are the foundation.&quot;

===Live performances===
Keenan suffered from stage fright in Broadcast&#x27;s early days, and earned a reputation for a &quot;shoegazing onstage introversion.&quot; &quot;I used to get nervous like the whole of that day of the show, and now it only happens the moment I walk onstage,&quot; she later said in a 1998 interview. &quot;When you listen to me sing my first line, you can always tell my heart is in my throat. Headlining gigs is a confidence booster.&quot;

<text>Bentley Rhythm Ace (BRA) are a British electronic music act formed in Birmingham in 1995, originally consisting of Mike Stokes and Richard March.

==Career==
The band was formed in Birmingham by Richard March, formerly with the group Pop Will Eat Itself, and Mike Stokes formerly with Bugweed Centipede. &quot;Both more or less penniless, they drank in the same pub and were forced to buy their records at the cheapest place possible - car boot sales&quot;. Their live drummers include Keith York and Car SOS&#x27;s Fuzz Townshend (alongside whom March previously played with in Pop Will Eat Itself), while EMF&#x27;s James Atkin is also involved with BRA as a touring member.

BRA signed on the Brighton based record label Skint and released their eponymous debut album, &quot;Bentley Rhythm Ace&quot; in 1997, which spawned the popular single &quot;Bentleys Gonna Sort You Out!&quot;.

A second album, &quot;For Your Ears Only&quot;, was released in 2000 on Parlophone but was less popular. A further single &quot;Madam, Your Carriage Awaits&quot; was released. The group also compiled a two-CD &quot;FSUK&quot; compilation album. In 2004, the Bentleys released a 4-song record with Sophia Lolley called &quot;Angel Face&quot;.

The name probably refers to the Rhythm Ace line of analogue drum machines manufactured by Ace Tone, some of which were rebranded and distributed by Bentley Pianos in the UK.

The group epitomises the big beat era. Signed to Skint Records, they enjoyed commercial success with their music being used on television advertisements and having an underground following.

The group split in 2000 after which they played the occasional low-key DJ set. In 2016, the duo reformed and played live sets across the UK at festivals, supporting the Wonder Stuff&#x27;s December tour and headlining a few of their own shows.

<text>The Hollywood Hotel was a famous hotel, society venue of early Hollywood landmark, formerly located at 6811 Hollywood Boulevard, on the north side, extending from Highland Avenue to Orchid Avenue, in central Hollywood, Los Angeles, California.

==History==

===Early years===

The Hollywood Hotel opened in December 1902. It was designed and built by Lyman Farwell and Oliver Perry Dennis for early Hollywood developer H.J. Whitley, to support selling residential lots to potential buyers arriving from Los Angeles by the electric Balloon Route trolley of the Los Angeles Pacific Railroad. It was developed on property owned by Harrison Gray Otis, George Hoover, and Whitley. Located on the west side of Highland Avenue, the elegant wood structure with Mission Revival style stucco facades and broad verandas also fronted on unpaved Prospect Avenue, lined with California pepper trees. The hotel was sited among lemon groves then at the base of the Hollywood Hills, part of the Santa Monica Mountains in the area. Whitley was instrumental in improvements to Prospect Avenue, which in 1910 was renamed Hollywood Boulevard. Increasing business compelled the building of an additional 40-room wing onto the hotel in 1905.

Whitley surrounded the hotel with of cultivated gardens. He operated the establishment as a country resort hotel as the developing community of Hollywood first established itself.

In 1906 the heiress Almira Hershey, who was then living in a mansion on Bunker Hill in Downtown Los Angeles, took a buggy ride to see the hotel that was being advertised in the Los Angeles Times. She was so impressed with the Hollywood Hotel she decided to buy it. She hired Margaret J. Anderson who had worked for her at the Darby and the Fremont Hotels, which Hershey owned, as manager. Under Anderson&#x27;s management, the hotel expanded from 16 rooms to 250 and became well known in the area, but the two women had a contentious relationship and Anderson left to move to the Beverly Hills Hotel in 1912.

===Motion picture era===
The fame of the Hollywood Hotel, like that of Hollywood, came from its identification with the Hollywood movie industry, beginning in the 1910s. Those who stayed at the hotel included Jesse Lasky, Carl Laemmle, Louis B. Mayer, Harry Warner, and Irving Thalberg. Producers, directors, writers and technicians held conferences on the broad verandas.

There was a &#x27;stream&#x27; of silent film movie stars and movie moguls passing through. Some of the movie industry people resided in the hotel, and many attended the dances held Thursday nights in the ballroom. It was considered &quot;the&quot; place to be seen and the cultural center of Hollywood. To identify where certain people regularly sat to dine, the hotel had stars with the names of celebrities painted on the ceiling above their tables.

Among the scores of movie stars who stayed at the Hollywood Hotel through the years was Rudolph Valentino, who lived in room 264. He met his first wife, Jean Acker, in the hotel, where they were married in 1919 and spent their honeymoon. Other stars included Ethel Barrymore, Norma Shearer, and Valentino&#x27;s second wife Natasha Rambova. The hotel also hosted notable guests from beyond Los Angeles and the United States.

Songwriter Carrie Jacobs Bond composed her famous song &quot;A Perfect Day,&quot; and sang it, while a guest at the Hollywood Hotel.

In 1922 Almira Hershey lost a breach of contract dispute with the hotel&#x27;s long time manager George Krom, which allowed him to purchase the hotel.

===Decline and demolition===
In the early 1940s, Charles E. Toberman, a real estate developer who was known as &quot;Mr. Hollywood,&quot; acquired all the stock of the Good Hope Company, which owned the Hollywood Hotel property. He wanted to tear it down then and redevelop the block, but was halted because of the restrictions on building materials during World War II.

By the 1950s, the hotel was run down and faded from its former glory. Developers were adamant that renovating and restoring the property was out of the question.

Though the Hollywood Hotel was an architectural landmark and had housed many of the great Hollywood stars in its day, it was razed in August 1956 to make way for a development. It was replaced by a twelve story office building for the First Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association of Hollywood, a shopping center, and parking lots.

In 2001 those were demolished, and the Hollywood and Highland Center shopping and entertainment complex was built on the site. It includes the Dolby Theatre (formerly known as the Kodak Theatre), the current home of the annual Academy Awards ceremony.

<doc id="856573" wikidata="Q2165275" url="?curid=856573" title="Rompler">
<text>A rompler is an electronic musical instrument that plays pre-fabricated sounds based on audio samples. The term &quot;rompler&quot; is a blend of the terms &quot;ROM&quot; and &quot;sampler.&quot; In contrast to samplers, romplers do not record audio. Both may have additional sound editing features, such as layering several waveforms and modulation with ADSR envelopes, filters and LFOs.

The waveforms are commonly stored in form of PCM-encoded waveforms which were similar to those stored in WAV or AIFF file formats, although in some hardware design other encodings and forms of (usually lossless) compression could be used. 

The core characteristic of a rompler, compared to a sampler, is that they do not have the ability to record new samples, or in case of software instruments, the ability to add user samples from disk.

Note that earlier digital synthesizers, which used short-cycle sampled waveforms, are usually not considered romplers but are either called &quot;PCM synthesizers&quot; or &quot;wavetable synthesizers&quot; because the sampled waveform in this case is usually only made of a single full cycle (or a handful of full cycles) of the wave and would therefore be a fraction of a second in length, whereas in case of a sampler or a rompler, the recording would usually contain the sample&#x27;s decay and sometimes even release sections, such as with a recorded drum hit or piano note. Also, in their usage of sampled waves, filters (usually digital) were employed to gradually alter the timbre of cycling wave which makes them somewhat similar to analog subtractive synthesizers. However in many such designs, the attack section of a sound was often sampled as a full, longer sample, and then crossfaded or mixed with the looping PCM waveform, such as with Roland&#x27;s Linear Arithmetic synthesis and its competitors from other manufacturers, further blurring the difference.

Hardware romplers emerged in the late 1980s, as price drops of memory chips allowed for longer recording storage to be used without making the instruments prohibitively expensive. They were meant to displace previous FM and PCM-based digital synthesizers in the market, by offering more realistic sound of real, acoustic and electronic instruments, and by the early 1990s they became the dominant technology for mainstream keyboards. The most successful early romplers are considered to be Korg M1 workstation, and E-mu Proteus module. 

Before the emergence of software virtual instruments, computer sound hardware gradually shifted from synthesizer based sound and music reproduction (such as with Commodore SID or Yamaha OPN chips) to PCM-based chips, such as Commodore Amiga&#x27;s Paula. Combined with computer&#x27;s RAM and disk storage, these chips allowed for longer PCM recordings to be reproduced, and games and other software often used rompler-like software technology to reproduce music, most notable example being music trackers on Amiga. Later computer sound hardware employed hardware rompler and sample-based synthesizers (such as Gravis Ultrasound and E-mu/Creative SoundBlaster) to increase number of voices and reduce CPU usage for sound processing.

As the processing power of personal computers grew, these hardware synthesizers were gradually abandoned and sound hardware of contemporary computers now usually has only PCM reproduction converters with all synthesis and reproduction logic implemented in software. Modern computers are capable of real-time reproduction of large number of voices, as well as real-time emulation of analogue sound circuits. With the introduction of digital audio workstations, musicians started to employ more and more virtual instruments, so a market for software romplers, as a source of instantly available sampled instruments, also emerged. Some popular examples of software romplers are reFX Nexus and IK Multimedia Sampletank.

== Notable romplers ==

* Korg M1 (1988), the Korg M1 was one of the first commercially successful ROMplers. It features a range of iconic sound presets, including the famous &quot;M1 Piano&quot; used in 1990s house music.
* E-mu Proteus (1989) was popular among producers for its high-quality samples and ease of use.
* Kurzweil K2000 (1990) was one of the first ROMplers to incorporate a powerful synthesis engine V.A.S.T, making it a favorite of musicians and sound designers alike.
* Roland JV-1080 (1994) was used extensively in electronic, film score and pop music in the 1990s.
* Yamaha Motif series (2001) is known for its realistic sounds and extensive synthesis capabilities.
* Native Instruments Kontakt (2002) is a virtual instrument that offers a vast library of samples and an intuitive interface for creating custom instruments.

<text>Joan Vollmer (February 4, 1923 – September 6, 1951) was an influential participant in the early Beat Generation circle. While a student at Barnard College, she became the roommate of Edie Parker (later married to Jack Kerouac). Their apartment became a gathering place for the Beats during the 1940s, where Vollmer was often at the center of marathon, all-night discussions. In 1946, she began a relationship with William S. Burroughs, later becoming his common-law wife. In 1951, Burroughs killed Vollmer. He claimed, and shortly thereafter denied, the killing was a drunken attempt at playing William Tell.

==Biography==
Joan Vollmer was born in Ossining, New York, and raised in Loudonville, New York. She graduated from St. Agnes School in 1939 and attended Barnard College in New York City on a scholarship, also studying journalism at Columbia University. Vollmer met Edie Parker at the West End Bar and the two moved in together in the first of a series of apartments in New York&#x27;s Upper West Side that they shared with the writers, hustlers, alcoholics and drug addicts that later became known as the Beats. These included: William S. Burroughs, Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, Lucien Carr, Herbert Huncke, Vickie Russell (a prostitute and addict who appears as &quot;Mary&quot; in Burroughs&#x27;s novel &quot;Junkie&quot;), and Hal Chase, a Columbia University graduate student from Denver. In &quot;The Women of the Beat Generation&quot;, Brenda Knight wrote:
Joan Vollmer Adams Burroughs was seminal in the creation of the Beat revolution; indeed the fires that stoked the Beat engine were started with Joan as patron and muse. Her apartment in New York was a nucleus that attracted many of the characters who played a vital role in the formation of the Beat; ... Brilliant and well versed in philosophy and literature, Joan was the whetstone against which the main Beat writers—Allen, Jack, and Bill—sharpened their intellect. Widely considered one of the most perceptive people in the group, her strong mind and independent nature helped bulldoze the Beats toward a new sensibility.

Vollmer married Paul Adams, a law student, in 1944, and had her first child, Julie, in August 1944. In 1945, Vollmer asked Adams, who was in the military at the time, to consent to divorce. Paul Adams divorced Vollmer upon returning from military service, reportedly appalled by her drug use and group of friends. In 1945, Kerouac introduced her to Benzedrine, which she used heavily for a few years. Early in 1946, she began a long-term relationship with Burroughs. The match was initially set up and encouraged by Ginsberg, who much admired Burroughs&#x27;s intellect and considered Vollmer his female counterpart. Once, Vollmer and Burroughs were arrested for having sex in a parked vehicle. 

In 1946, Vollmer was admitted to Bellevue Hospital in New York City due to psychotic episodes as a result of excessive amphetamine use. After being released, she began calling herself Mrs. William Burroughs despite the fact that Vollmer and Burroughs were never formally married. Vollmer and Burroughs had a son, William Burroughs, Jr., in 1947. Due to charges of drug abuse, drug distribution and lewd behavior, they relocated several times, moving first to New Waverly, Texas, then to New Orleans, and eventually to Mexico City. While living in New Orleans, Burroughs was arrested for heroin possession, during which time police searched Vollmer&#x27;s home, unearthing letters from Ginsberg discussing a possible shipment of marijuana. The resulting criminal charges were grave; if convicted, Burroughs would have served time in Louisiana&#x27;s infamous Angola State Prison. To avoid prosecution, Burroughs&#x27; lawyers negotiated his freedom by supplying the police with the names of his local contacts. He was then allowed to flee to Mexico City. Once he was settled, Vollmer joined him, along with her children.

Vollmer was reportedly unhappy in Mexico City. Benzedrine, her usual drug of choice, was unavailable, and she wrote to Ginsberg that she was &quot;somewhat drunk from 8:00am on... Bill is fine in himself, and so are we jointly. The boys are lovely, easy and cheap (3 pesos = 40 cents) but my patience is infinite.&quot; Ted Morgan describes her in &quot;Literary Outlaw&quot; as a woman suffering from serious drug and alcohol addictions which had aged her noticeably. Her face was swollen; she limped due to a recent bout of polio. Herbert Huncke, who had stayed with the couple in Texas, was struck by Burroughs&#x27;s indifference to Vollmer, stating that Burroughs &quot;didn&#x27;t like to be annoyed with her too much&quot;. In a 1980s interview with Ted Morgan, Burroughs described a domestic violence incident which occurred shortly after his arrival in Mexico in January 1950, stating that he &quot;slapped&quot; Vollmer after she threw his heroin in the toilet and recalled how he immediately went out to buy more, stating &quot;What could she do? [Go back to Upstate] New York?&quot; The same scene was recounted in Burroughs&#x27;s semi-autobiographical &quot;Junkie&quot;.

In August 1950, a petition for divorce was initiated in Mexico by Burroughs, Vollmer, or both. (Although their marriage was a common-law marriage, in Mexico it was considered legal.) However, the application was later withdrawn by their Mexican attorney. The divorce was likely required due to Burroughs&#x27;s stated desire to take custody of their son upon dissolution.

== Death ==

On September 6, 1951, shortly after his return from holiday in Ecuador with a boyfriend, Burroughs shot Vollmer in the head, allegedly while trying to shoot a glass he had asked her to balance on her head during a drunken William Tell act the couple were performing at a drinking party held at a friend&#x27;s apartment in Mexico City. Vollmer died several hours later at the age of 28. Numerous newspapers incorrectly reported her age as 27. Burroughs said he had 8–10 drinks and could not remember much of that night, while witnesses claimed they had two small glasses. The couple&#x27;s four-year-old son, William Burroughs Jr., was in the room when the incident occurred, as were the party&#x27;s host John Healey, and American students Edwin John Woods and Lewis Marker, both residents of the apartment building where the shooting occurred. Burroughs gave different accounts of the shooting, denying his original William Tell story after intervention by his attorney, Bernabé Jurado. Vollmer&#x27;s parents heard news of their daughter&#x27;s death from friends while on holiday in Montreal. Her father told the &quot;Albany Times Union&quot; &quot;I have no reason to believe the shooting was otherwise than accidental.&quot;

Burroughs&#x27; brother Mortimer arrived from St. Louis to help him, providing thousands of dollars for legal costs to Jurado. Jurado used part of the money to bribe the judge, ballistics experts, and others involved in the case. Burroughs was held on murder charges for 13 days before being released on bail. 

Burroughs claimed that he dropped the gun and it misfired, then changed his account again to say that he accidentally misfired the gun while trying to sell the weapon to an acquaintance, an account which was corroborated by two witnesses who had been coached by Jurado. Burroughs testified that he had not known that the gun was loaded because he had not used it in three months, and that while he had been checking the gun, the carriage had slipped and it had misfired at Vollmer. As a result, he was charged with criminal negligence, which carried a maximum sentence of five years. 

For a year, Burroughs reported every Monday morning to the jail in Mexico City while Jurado worked to resolve the case. However, Jurado fled to Brazil after shooting a youth who had accidentally damaged his Cadillac. Burroughs decided to follow Jurado&#x27;s example and fled back to the United States, where he was fortunate that Louisiana had not issued a warrant for his arrest on the previous narcotics charge. &quot;In absentia&quot;, Burroughs was convicted of manslaughter in Vollmer&#x27;s death. He received a two-year suspended sentence.

Vollmer was buried in Mexico City, and her parents took her two children back to the United States. Her daughter Julie went to live with her maternal grandparents in Loudonville and assumed the surname Vollmer, while Vollmer&#x27;s son was raised by her in-laws.

=== Reactions to Vollmer&#x27;s death ===
Friends of the couple were divided in opinion on the case. Ginsberg and Carr defended Burroughs and believed that Vollmer might have encouraged the William Tell incident, stating she had seemed suicidal when they visited her in 1951. In interviews with Ted Morgan from 1983 to 1986, Burroughs said &quot;Allen was always making it out as a suicide on her part, and I do not accept that cop-out.&quot; Haldon Chase, who had also visited Burroughs and Vollmer in 1951 in Mexico City, distanced himself from Burroughs after Vollmer&#x27;s death. Chase believed that Vollmer &quot;had wanted to die&quot;, but that Burroughs&#x27; story was &quot;a sham, a put-up thing to release Bill, to let him commit the ultimate crime.&quot; 

In a 1954 letter to Ginsberg, Burroughs wrote about his fears that he had subconsciously wanted to kill Vollmer: &quot;May yet attempt a story or some account of Joan&#x27;s death. I think I am afraid. Not exactly to discover unconscious intent, it&#x27;s more complex, more basic, and more horrible, as if the brain drew the bullet toward it.&quot; In the introduction to &quot;Queer&quot;, Burroughs describes how Vollmer&#x27;s death exposed him to the risk of possession by a malevolent entity he called &quot;the Ugly Spirit&quot;. Later in life, Burroughs described the Ugly Spirit as &quot;Monopolistic, acquisitive evil. Ugly evil. The ugly American&quot;, and took part in a shamanic ceremony with the explicit aim of exorcising the Ugly Spirit.

===In film===
The film &quot;Beat&quot; (2000) is a biographical account of the relationship between Vollmer and Burroughs. Vollmer is portrayed by Courtney Love and Burroughs by Kiefer Sutherland. The film centers on Vollmer&#x27;s death. Her death is also portrayed in the 1991 film &quot;Naked Lunch&quot;.

<doc id="856575" wikidata="Q1341631" url="?curid=856575" title="Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach">
<text>The title Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach () refers to either of two manuscript notebooks that the German Baroque composer Johann Sebastian Bach presented to his second wife, Anna Magdalena. Keyboard music (minuets, rondeaux, polonaises, chorales, sonatas, preludes, musettes, marches, gavottes) makes up most of both notebooks, and a few pieces for voice (songs, and arias) are included.

The Notebooks provide a glimpse into the domestic music of the 18th century and the musical tastes of the Bach family.

==History==
The two notebooks are known by their title page dates of 1722 and 1725. The title &quot;Anna Magdalena Notebook&quot; is commonly used to refer to the latter. The primary difference between the two collections is that the 1722 notebook contains works only by Johann Sebastian Bach (including most of the French Suites), while the 1725 notebook is a compilation of music by both Bach and other composers of the era.

===The 1722 notebook: French Suites and miscellany===

This notebook contains 25 unbound sheets (including two blank pages), which is estimated to be approximately a third of the original size. It is not known what happened to the other pages. The back and the corners are decorated with brown leather; greenish paper is used for the cover. The title page is inscribed &quot;&quot; in Anna Magdalena&#x27;s hand (using the feminine version of her last name). For a reason so far unknown to researchers, Johann Sebastian wrote the titles of three books by theologian (died 1698) in the lower right corner of the title page:
* &#x27; is a shortened and misspelled title of &#x27; (Anti-Calvinism, or Conversations about the reformed religion).
* &quot;&#x27; item&quot; refers to Pfeiffer&#x27;s &#x27; (&quot;Evangelical Christian School&quot;).
* &quot;AntiMelancholicus&quot; refers to &quot;&quot; (Anti-melancholy, or [something or someone] to drive out the melancholy).

The notebook contains the following works, most in Johann Sebastian&#x27;s hand:
* Five keyboard suites. The first three are fragments of the pieces that are now known as the first three French Suites, BWV 812–814. The next two are complete suites, French Suites Nos. 4 and 5, BWV 815–816. The minuets of suites 2 and 3 are separated from the rest of their respective suites and were most probably added at a later date by Anna Magdalena Bach (they are almost certainly in her hand), some time before 1725.
* &quot;Fantasia pro organo&quot;, unfinished, BWV 573. A short organ piece, 12 complete bars and the beginning notes of the 13th bar.
* Air with variations in C minor, unfinished, BWV 991. The first 10 bars feature coherent two-part writing, but the remaining 35 bars only have one voice written out.
* &quot;Jesus, meine Zuversicht&quot;, chorale prelude, BWV 728. A brief (9 bars) piece in three voices, features two sections with repeats for each.
* Minuet in G major, BWV 841 (not to be confused with Petzold&#x27;s &quot;Minuet in G major&quot; in the 1725 notebook). A short dance with simplistic two-part writing and two sections with repeats for each.

===The 1725 notebook===

The 1725 notebook is larger than the 1722 one, and more richly decorated. Light green paper is used for the front cover, Anna Magdalena&#x27;s initials and the year number &quot;1725&quot; are printed in gold, the annotations A[nna] M[agdal] B[ach] added by her stepson C. P. E. Bach when he inherited it. All pages feature gilt edging. Most of the entries in the 1725 notebook were made by Anna Magdalena herself, with others written in the hand of Johann Sebastian, some by sons Johann Christian and Carl Philipp Emanuel, and a few by family friends such as Johann Gottfried Bernhard and Johann Gottfried Heinrich. 
Although the 1725 notebook does contain work composed by Johann Sebastian Bach, it also includes works by many other composers. The authorship of several pieces is identified in the notebook itself, while that of others was established by researchers. The composers of still others, including several popular songs of the time, remain unknown. 
Here is a complete list of the pieces included, in order of appearance in the notebook:
#Keyboard partita in A minor, BWV 827. This is the third partita from Bach&#x27;s set of Partitas for keyboard BWV 825–830, which was published in 1731 as the first volume of &quot;&quot;.

#Keyboard aria in G major, BWV 988/1. Another well-known piece, this is the aria of the Goldberg Variations, BWV 988. Christoph Wolff has suggested that this Aria was entered into the two blank pages of this book by Anna Magdalena later, in 1740.

====&quot;Menuet fait par Mons. Böhm&quot;====
No. 21 of the second Notebook, &quot;Menuet fait par Mons. Böhm&quot; (Minuet by Mr. Böhm), in G major, was never assigned a number in the BWV catalogue. It is however included in both the Bach-Gesellschaft Ausgabe (BGA) and the New Bach Edition (Neue Bach-Ausgabe, NBA) of the Notebooks. There is some doubt which composer by the name Böhm may have been intended, Georg Böhm being the best known among them.

<text>Charles Henry Plumb, Baron Plumb, (27 March 1925 – 15 April 2022) was a British politician and farmer who went into politics as a leader of the National Farmers&#x27; Union. He later became active in the Conservative Party and was elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP). He served as an MEP from 1979 to 1999, and was President of the European Parliament from 1987 to 1989, the only Briton to hold the post.

==Personal life==
Plumb&#x27;s family was from Cheshire and had been in farming for several generations. His father farmed at Coleshill in Warwickshire, on which his son joined him in 1940. He took over running the farm after his father died in 1952. The farm ran to and consisted primarily of a dairy herd (200 pedigree Ayrshire cattle) with 70 breeding sows and of grain.

Plumb was married to Marjorie () from 1947 until her death in 2019; they had three children. He died on 15 April 2022, at the age of 97, after suffering a stroke.

==National Farmers&#x27; Union==
After rising through the county branch, in 1965, Plumb was elected vice-president of the National Farmers&#x27; Union. Although only 40 years old he was considered for the presidency, but had to settle for promotion to deputy president in 1966. In the late 1960s, Plumb was a member of the Northumberland Committee inquiring into the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease, being the only working farmer on the committee. Towards the end of the committee&#x27;s deliberations, a report from political correspondent J. W. Murray in &quot;Farmer and Stockbreeder&quot; said Plumb had single-handedly persuaded the committee to recommend prohibiting the import of carcass meat from countries where foot-and-mouth was endemic.

In January 1970, the incumbent president of the NFU Gwilym Williams failed to get the 80% support necessary to be re-elected, and Plumb was elected president of the NFU in his place. Plumb&#x27;s term of office included British accession to the European Economic Community and its Common Agricultural Policy and Plumb negotiated for greater support for British agriculture; he stressed that Britain no longer had the economic power to bring cheap food prices. Plumb was, however, a strong supporter of British membership of the European Economic Community; he was considered as a possible director for the pro-market campaign in the 1975 referendum campaign and was described as one of its most indefatigable spokesmen. Plumb was awarded a knighthood in the 1973 Birthday Honours.

Throughout the 1970s, Plumb had Richard C. Butler as his deputy at the NFU, and Butler succeeded him as president when he retired in 1979.

==European Parliament==
Having joined the Conservative Party, Plumb was elected Member of the European Parliament for the Cotswolds seat in 1979 and remained in the European Parliament until 1999, being President of the European Parliament from 1987 to 1989. He was the only British president of the European parliament. He was made a Life peer as Baron Plumb, of Coleshill in the County of Warwickshire on 6 April 1987.

On 11 October 1988, Plumb received international attention. During the papal visit to the European Parliament in Strasbourg, Pope John Paul II was delivering a speech. Northern Ireland MEP Ian Paisley, a staunch Protestant and opponent of Catholicism, heckled throughout the delivery, brandishing posters accusing the Pope of being the Antichrist. Using his position as president, Plumb ordered Paisley to leave the chamber.

He retired from the House of Lords on 3 November 2017. He was also Chancellor of Coventry University between 1995 and 2007.

===2012 allegations of conflict of interest===
In June 2012, the Bureau of Investigative Journalism and &quot;The Independent&quot; newspaper revealed how senior members of the House of Lords failed to disclose their business interests in a public inquiry. As of July 2012, Plumb&#x27;s entry in the register of interests listed his only remunerated employment/profession as &#x27;farming&#x27;, despite his involvement with the Brussels-based lobbying firm Alber &amp; Geiger since 2007. According to &quot;The Independent&quot;, Plumb insisted he did not need to register his involvement because he had “never been in employment, paid or unpaid” by the firm.

<text>Last and First Men: A Story of the Near and Far Future is a &quot;future history&quot; science fiction novel written in 1930 by the British author Olaf Stapledon. A work of unprecedented scale in the genre, it describes the history of humanity from the present onwards across two billion years and eighteen distinct human species, of which our own is the first. The book employs a narrative conceit that, under subtle inspiration, the novelist has unknowingly been dictated a channelled text from the last human species.

Stapledon&#x27;s conception of history follows a repetitive cycle with many varied civilisations rising from and descending back into savagery over millions of years, as the later civilisations rise to far greater heights than the first. The book anticipates the science of genetic engineering, and is an early example of the fictional supermind: a consciousness comprising many telepathically linked individuals.

In 1932, Stapledon followed &quot;Last and First Men&quot; with the far less acclaimed &quot;Last Men in London&quot;. Another Stapledon novel, &quot;Star Maker&quot; (1937), could also be considered a sequel to &quot;Last and First Men&quot; (mentioning briefly man&#x27;s evolution on Neptune), but is even more ambitious in scope, being a history of the entire universe.

It is the 11th title in the SF Masterworks series.

== Species of humans ==
* First Men. (Chapters 1–6) The First Men are our own species. Beginning in the early twenty-first century, several increasingly devastating wars take place in Europe, which result in the United States and China becoming the two dominant superpowers on Earth. In the twenty-fourth century, the US and China go to war, and the war concludes with the formation of the First World State. Two centuries thereafter, all religions and secular science consolidate into a religion based on the worship of motion whose god is Gordelpus, the Prime Mover. Four millennia after the formation of the First World State, humans deplete Earth&#x27;s supply of fossil fuels, resulting in the total collapse of civilization. 100,000 years later, the Patagonian Civilization emerges. One feature of the Patagonian civilization was a cult of youth. One day, a riot occurs at a mine, and the rioters inadvertently cause a colossal subterranean explosion, rendering most of the Earth&#x27;s surface uninhabitable for millions of years save for the poles and the northern coast of Siberia. The only survivors of the disaster are thirty-five humans stationed at the North Pole, whose descendants eventually split up into two separate species, the Second Men and some sub-humans. The First Men do not become completely extinct until shortly after the emergence of the Second Men.
* Second Men. (Chapters 7– 9) The Second Men came into existence ten million years after the fall of the First Men. &quot;Their heads, indeed, were large even for their bodies, and their necks massive. Their hands were huge, but finely moulded...their legs were stouter...their feet had lost their separate toes...blonde hirsute appearance...Their eyes were large, and often jade green, their features firm as carved granite, yet mobile and . ...not till they were fifty did they reach maturity. At about 190 their powers began to fail...&quot; Unlike our species, egotism is virtually unknown to them. At the acme of their highly advanced civilization, just as they are about to create a superior human species through &quot;artificial evolution&quot;, a protracted war with the Martians finally ends with the Martians extinct and the Second Men gone into eclipse.
*Third Men. (Chapter 10) &quot;Scarcely more than half the stature of their predecessors, these beings were proportionally slight and lithe. Their skin was of a sunny brown, covered with a luminous halo of red-gold hairs... golden eyes... faces were compact as a cat&#x27;s muzzle, their lips full, but subtle at the corners. Their ears, objects of personal pride and of sexual admiration, were extremely variable both in individuals and in races. ... But the most distinctive feature of the Third Men was their great lean hands, on which were six versatile fingers, six antennae of living steel.&quot; Deeply interested in music (to the point of developing a religion based on the worship of music) and the design of living organisms. The Third Men eventually split into two factions: one that sought to create a subspecies of mediums, and one that focused on designing humans that consist almost entirely of brain tissue.
*Fourth Men. (Chapter 11) Giant brains bred by one faction of the Third Men. For a long time they help govern their creators, but eventually their rule becomes oppressive and the Third Men rebel. The Fourth Men prevail by recruiting as servants a subspecies of Third Men prone to hypnotic suggestion (the ultimate product of the effort to breed a mediumistic subspecies). The docile subspecies of the Third Men exterminate the original subspecies, save for a few individuals to be used as lab specimens. After the war, the Fourth Men eventually reach the limits of their scientific abilities and discover that emotions and body are also necessary for complete understanding of the cosmos.
*Fifth Men. (Chapters 11–12) An artificial human species designed by the Fourth Men. &quot;On the average they were more than twice as tall as the First Men, and much taller than the Second Men... the delicate sixth finger had been induced to divide its tip into two Lilliputian fingers and a corresponding thumb. The contours of the limbs were sharply visible, for the body bore no hair, save for a close, thick which, in the original stock, was of ruddy brown. The well-marked eyebrows, when drawn down, shaded the sensitive eyes from the sun.&quot; After clashing with and finally eliminating the Third and Fourth Men, they develop a technology greater than Earth had ever known before. When Earth ceases to be habitable, they terraform Venus, committing genocide on its marine native race which tries to resist them. The Fifth Men do not cope well after the migration and eventually devolve and diverge into two species: the Sixth Men and a seal-like subhuman species.
*Sixth Men. (Chapter 13) &quot;Sadly reduced in stature and in brain, these abject beings... gained a precarious livelihood by grubbing roots upon the forest-clad islands, trapping the innumerable birds, and catching fish... Not infrequently they devoured, or were devoured by, their seal-like relatives.&quot; After tectonic changes provide them with a promising land mass, they fluctuate like the First Men and repeat all their mistakes.
*Seventh Men. Flying humans, &quot;scarcely heavier than the largest of terrestrial flying birds&quot;, are created by the Sixth Men. After 100 million years, a flightless pedestrian subspecies appears which re-develops technology.
*Eighth Men. &quot;These long-headed and substantial folk were designed to be strictly pedestrian, physically and mentally.&quot; When Venus becomes uninhabitable, about to be destroyed along with the entire inner Solar System, they design the Ninth Men, who will live on Neptune.
*Ninth Men. (Chapter 14) &quot;Inevitably it was a dwarf type, limited in size by the necessity of resisting an excessive gravitation... too delicately organized to withstand the ferocity of natural forces on Neptune... civilization crumbled into savagery.&quot; After the Ninth Men&#x27;s civilization collapses, the Ninth Men themselves devolve into various animal species.
*Tenth to Thirteenth Men. (Chapter 14) &quot;Nowhere did the typical human form survive.&quot; About three hundred million years after the colonization of Neptune, a rabbit-like species evolves into the Tenth Men. The Tenth Men are sapient but primitive. After a plague wipes out the Tenth Men, several other primitive human species rise and fall.
*Fourteenth to Seventeenth Men. The Fourteenth, Fifteenth, and Sixteenth Men are essentially Neptunian versions of the First, Second and Fifth Men, respectively. The Fourteenth Men create great civilisations and destroy them, frustrated with their own imperfections. The Fifteenth improve upon that, creating a spirituality based on &quot;a devotion to the fulfilment of human capacity&quot;. They eventually create the Sixteenth Men - the first Neptunian artificial species. Thus the cycle of rise and collapse of civilisations ends, and steady progress takes its place. The Sixteenth Men achieve the highest level of civilisation possible &quot;to the individual human brain acting in physical isolation&quot; and to avoid stagnation create the Seventeenth Men, with an ability for &quot;mental fusion of many individuals&quot; to succeed them; however, the Seventeenth Men are &quot;flawed&quot; in some unspecified way, unimagined by the 16th due to their lesser awareness, and last only a short period of time before being replaced by the Eighteenth Men.
*Eighteenth Men. (Chapters 15–16) The most advanced humans of all, essentially a perfected version of the 17th species. A race of philosophers and artists with a very liberal sexual morality. &quot;Superficially we seem to be not one species but many.&quot; (One interesting aspect of the Eighteenth Men is that they have a number of different &quot;sub-genders&quot;, variants on the basic male and female pattern, with distinctive temperaments. The Eighteenth Men&#x27;s equivalent of the family unit includes one of each of these sub-genders and is the basis of their society. The units have the ability to act as a group mind, which eventually leads to the establishment of a single group mind uniting the entire species.) This species no longer dies naturally, but only by accident, suicide, or being killed. Despite their hyper-advanced civilisation, they practice ritual cannibalism. They are eventually extinguished on Neptune after a supernova consumes the remains of the Solar System, faster than any means of escape they can devise for their corporeal forms. This last species of man devises a method of panspermia, a virus to broadcast life to other worlds and ultimately cause the evolution of new sentient species throughout the galaxy.

===Sub-humans===
*Baboon-like Submen. (Chapter 7) &quot;Bent so that as often as not they used their arms as aids to locomotion, flat-headed and curiously long-snouted, these creatures were by now more baboon-like than human&quot;.
*Seal-like Submen. (Chapter 13) &quot;The whole body was moulded to stream-lines. The lung capacity was greatly developed. The spine had elongated, and increased in flexibility. The legs were shrunken, grown together, and flattened into a horizontal rudder. The arms also were diminutive and fin-like, though they still retained the manipulative forefinger and thumb. The head had shrunk into the body and looked forward in the direction of swimming. Strong carnivorous teeth, emphatic gregariousness, and a new, almost human, cunning in the chase, combined to make these seal-men lords of the ocean&quot;.
*Period of Eclipse. (Chapter 14) &quot;Man&#x27;s consciousness was narrowed and coarsened into brute-consciousness. By good luck the brute precariously survived.&quot; Nature succeeds in colonising Neptune where sapient life fails. Human-derived mammals of all shapes come to dominate Neptune&#x27;s ecosystem before adapting well enough for the vestiges of opposable thumbs and intelligence to become assets again.

== In popular culture ==
Characters discuss the novel in H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;Star Begotten&quot;.

The novel appears in the computer game &quot;Deus Ex&quot; as a reference when a corporation in the game allegedly tries to develop the Second Men in the series, but also in a much broader aspect as the game deals with genetic engineering, the next phase of evolution and human augmentations. Also similar to the book are the options presented to the player as to where human kind will go next: a fall back into an almost savage state of humanity, a keeping of the status quo or an extreme progression with the danger of sacrificing basic rights.

== Film adaptation ==

Icelandic composer Jóhann Jóhannsson directed and scored a multimedia &quot;Last and First Men&quot;, &quot;combining a film narrated by actress Tilda Swinton and accompanying score played by the BBC Philharmonic&quot; at the 2017 Manchester International Festival. The 16mm black-and-white film is predominantly of memorial sculptures erected in the former Republic of Yugoslavia. Jóhann collaborated with José Enrique Macián on writing the narration adapted from Stapledon&#x27;s novel. This was next performed at the Barbican Centre, London in December 2018, and later at Sydney Opera House as part of the Vivid Festival, on 2 June 2019. In 2020, a film of this work was released as Jóhann&#x27;s debut and final directorial work, with sound artist Yair Elazar Glotman completing the work after Jóhann&#x27;s death in February 2018. The film premiered at the 70th Berlin International Film Festival, and later screened at other film festivals around the world and released on VOD.

== Influences on other writers ==
Brian Aldiss, in his preface to the 1962 edition, acknowledges the deep impression on him—and considerable influence on his own later writing—of Stapledon&#x27;s book, which he encountered in 1943 while a British soldier fighting the Japanese in Burma, &quot;An appropriately unusual period of life at which to encounter a vision so far outside ordinary experience.&quot;

Aldiss also mentions James Blish as another writer deeply influenced by Stapledon.

C. S. Lewis, in his own preface to &quot;That Hideous Strength&quot;, notes: &quot;I believe that one of the central ideas of this tale came into my head from conversations I had with a scientific colleague, some time before I met a rather similar suggestion in the works of Mr. Olaf Stapledon. If I am mistaken in this, Mr. Stapledon is so rich in invention that he can afford to lend, and I admire his invention (though not his philosophy) so much that I should feel no shame to borrow.&quot;

The reference to objecting to Stapledon&#x27;s philosophy was no accident. In particular, Lewis objected to Stapledon&#x27;s idea, as expressed in the present book, that mankind could escape from an outworn planet and establish itself on another one; this Lewis regarded as no less than a Satanic idea especially, but not only, because it necessitated the genocide of the original inhabitants of the target planet. Professor Weston, the chief villain of Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Space Trilogy&quot;, is an outspoken proponent of this idea (much to his grief, however), and in &quot;Out of the Silent Planet&quot;, Lewis opposes to it his depiction of the virtuous and stoic Martians/Malacandrians who, even though they possess the technology to cross space and colonize Earth. choose to die with their dying planet.

Arthur C. Clarke has said of Stapledon&#x27;s 1930 book &quot;Last and First Men&quot; that &quot;No other book had a greater influence on my life... [It] and its successor &quot;Star Maker&quot; (1937) are the twin summits of [Stapledon&#x27;s] literary career.&quot;

H. P. Lovecraft held the book in very high regard (though he did not say whether it influenced any of his own stories), saying in a 1936 letter to Fritz Leiber &quot;no one ought to miss reading W. Olaf Stapledon&#x27;s &quot;Last and First Men&quot;... Probably you &quot;have&quot; read it. If not, make a bee line for library or bookstall!&quot;, and in another 1936 letter to Leiber &quot;I&#x27;m glad to hear of your perusal of &quot;Last and First Men&quot;—a volume which to my mind forms the greatest of all achievements in the field that Master Ackerman would denominate &quot;scientifiction&quot;. Its scope is dizzying—and despite a somewhat disproportionate acceleration of the tempo toward the end, and a few scientific inferences which might legitimately be challenged, it remains a thing of unparalleled power. As you say, it has the truly basic quality of a myth, and some of the episodes are of matchless poignancy and dramatic intensity.&quot; Finally, in a 1937 letter to Arthur Widner he said &quot;I don&#x27;t care for science fiction of the sort published in cheap magazines. There&#x27;s no vitality in it—merely dry theories tacked on to shallow, unreal, insincere juvenile adventure stories. But I do like the few real masterpieces in the field—certain of H. G. Wells&#x27;s novels, S. Fowler Wright&#x27;s &quot;The World Below&quot;, &amp; that marvellous piece of imagination by W. Olaf Stapledon, &quot;Last &amp; First Men&quot;.&quot;

John Maynard Smith has said &quot;A man called Olaf Stapledon was a marvellous predictor who wrote science fiction books that I read when I was 16 and that completely blew my mind; and Arthur C. Clarke put his finger on quite a number of bright thoughts. He and I have something in common: we both took out of the public library the same science fiction book when we were boys of about 15 or 16, which was Stapledon&#x27;s &quot;Last and First Men&quot;. We took it out of the same country library in Porlock in Somerset. Whoever put that book on the shelves had a lot to answer for!&quot;

Sir Patrick Moore has said &quot;The science fiction novel &quot;Last and First Men&quot; by Olaf Stapledon is immensely thought-provoking and I&#x27;ve read it time and time again.&quot;

<text>The Bornless Ritual, also known as the Preliminary Invocation of the Goetia or simply Preliminary Invocation, originates from the Graeco-Egyptian &quot;Papyri Graecae Magicae&quot; (PGM), a collection of ancient spells, invocations, and hymns compiled between the 2nd century BCE and the 5th century CE. Initially used for exorcism and healing, the ritual invokes the &quot;Headless One&quot;. In modern times this entity has been re-interpreted as the &quot;Bornless One&quot; without beginning or end, who symbolizes the unity of the divine and the practitioner. Some interpretations suggest that the ritual may have connections with the Egyptian god Set. It is also called the &quot;Headless Rite&quot; or the &quot;Invocation of the Bornless One&quot;. 

Adapted by the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn and Aleister Crowley&#x27;s A∴A∴, the ritual is employed to contact the Holy Guardian Angel, a key concept in Thelema and other esoteric traditions. It serves purposes of spiritual protection, purification, and preparation for deeper magical workings, aiming to facilitate a connection with higher spiritual forces.

Today, the Bornless Ritual remains significant in Western esotericism, especially in the pursuit of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Its continued use underscores its foundational role and impact on the spiritual journey in modern occult practices.

==Historical origins and development==
The Bornless Ritual is deeply rooted in ancient texts and traditions, drawing from Graeco-Egyptian magical practices. One of the primary sources for the ritual is the Greek Magical Papyri (&quot;Papyri Graecae Magicae&quot;), a collection of ancient spells, invocations, and hymns compiled between the 2nd century BCE and the 5th century CE. This collection includes various rituals and invocations that have influenced the development of the Bornless Ritual.

The ritual is derived from a specific text within the Greek Magical Papyri known as the &quot;Stele of Jeu the Hieroglyphist in his letter&quot; (PGM V. 96-172). The original ritual was intended as a rite of exorcism. It refers to &quot;Moses&quot; and the &quot;ceremonies of Israel&quot;, suggesting a Jewish influence. The Bornless Ritual was first published in England in 1852 by Charles Wycliffe Goodwin as &quot;Fragment of a Graeco-Egyptian Work Upon Magic&quot; for the Cambridge Antiquarian Society. In 1899, E. A. Wallis Budge included excerpts from it in his book &quot;Egyptian Magic&quot;.

The adaptation of the Bornless Ritual in the context of Western esotericism owes much to the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (1887–1903). Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers, one of the primary founders of the Golden Dawn, is credited with incorporating the ritual into the order&#x27;s teachings. The Golden Dawn&#x27;s teachings and ceremonial practices played a significant role in preserving and popularizing the ritual. Israel Regardie&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Dawn&quot; provides an in-depth look at the ritual&#x27;s structure and its significance within the order&#x27;s framework.

Aleister Crowley&#x27;s extensive work on the ritual is detailed in his &quot;The Temple of Solomon the King&quot;, where he emphasizes its use for attaining the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. His &quot;Liber Samekh&quot; offer a detailed interpretation and adaptation of the ritual, which he integrated into his practices. These foundational texts and references form the bedrock upon which contemporary understandings and practices of the Bornless Ritual are built.

==Theoretical foundations==

The theoretical foundations of the Bornless Ritual are rooted in ancient Egyptian and Greek magical traditions, reflecting a synthesis of Hermetic, Gnostic, and early Christian influences. The ritual calls upon the &quot;Bornless One&quot;, a term signifying a primordial, transcendent deity beyond the confines of birth and death. This concept is central to the Hermetic tradition, emphasizing the unity of the divine and the individual soul&#x27;s capacity to access higher realms of existence. Philosophers such as Iamblichus and the Neoplatonists have significantly contributed to the metaphysical framework that informs the ritual, advocating the practice of theurgy to attain divine illumination.

In Thelema, the Bornless Ritual is particularly significant for its role in the &quot;Invocation of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel&quot;. The invocation&#x27;s structure and language are designed to evoke a profound spiritual response, tapping into the archetypal imagery and symbolism present in ancient magical traditions. The ritual&#x27;s invocation of divine names, magical formulae and attributes is intended to align the practitioner with cosmic forces, facilitating a state of heightened spiritual awareness and connection with the Holy Guardian Angel. This alignment bridges the gap between the material and spiritual worlds, enabling the practitioner to wield spiritual authority and attain deeper self-realization.

==Structure==
The structure of the Bornless Ritual is composed of several key components that together form an impactful invocation. It begins with the declaration of the practitioner&#x27;s intent and a series of preparatory invocations aimed at purifying and consecrating the ritual space. The core of the ritual involves the recitation of the central invocation, which addresses the Bornless One and enumerates divine attributes, invoking protection, guidance, and spiritual authority. This central invocation is a detailed litany that calls upon various divine names and attributes, establishing a connection with higher spiritual forces. The invocation includes references to ancient deities such as the Egyptian god Thoth and the Greek god Hermes, symbolizing wisdom and communication.

Following the central invocation, the ritual concludes with a series of closing statements, reaffirming the practitioner’s connection to the divine and sealing the ritual space. Each segment is rich with symbolism, drawing on elements from various esoteric traditions to create a unified magical operation. The language used in the ritual is designed to resonate deeply with the practitioner&#x27;s unconscious mind, invoking a sense of awe and numinosity. This intricate structure ensures that the ritual is both a spiritual and psychological journey, guiding the practitioner through stages of purification, invocation, and empowerment. In Thelema, these stages facilitate the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel, with the aim of establishing a profound connection with one&#x27;s true divine self.

==Practical application==
In ancient times, the Bornless Ritual was primarily used for exorcism and healing. Its invocation of the &quot;Bornless One&quot; was believed to summon a transcendent power capable of banishing negative influences and purifying the practitioner and their surroundings. This use of the ritual reflects its roots in the Graeco-Egyptian magical traditions, where it served as a means of invoking divine assistance for health and protection. The ritual&#x27;s exorcistic qualities was thought to make it effective for warding off malevolent entities and ensuring the safety of the practitioner.

In modern ceremonial magic, the Bornless Ritual serves multiple purposes, extending its ancient applications to more complex magical workings. It is often used to invoke divine guidance and protection, enhancing the practitioner’s spiritual resilience and clarity. Practitioners often report heightened states of consciousness and profound spiritual experiences as a result of performing the Bornless Ritual. It is considered an advanced practice within the magical community, often performed after preparatory rituals such as the lesser ritual of the pentagram.

In the Golden Dawn, it was used as an invocation of the knowledge and conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. Crowley included his version of the ritual in his book &quot;Liber Samekh&quot;. It is a core method and milestone in Thelema, and is often considered the proper preliminary invocation to the &quot;Ars Goetia&quot; since it was introduced as such by Crowley.

==Performance==
Performing the Bornless Ritual requires meticulous attention to detail and a profound understanding of its components. The practitioner must begin by purifying themselves through bathing and donning ritual garments, followed by the consecration of the ritual space with incense and the drawing of protective symbols. The ritual proceeds with the chanting of the invocation, during which the practitioner must focus intensely on the words and their meanings. The use of specific gestures and movements can enhance the ritual&#x27;s effectiveness, aligning the practitioner&#x27;s body and mind with the invocation&#x27;s spiritual intent.

At the climax of the ritual is the powerful invocation of the Bornless One, a key segment that exemplifies the depth and complexity of the ritual. This climatic invocation as translated from the text by Hans Dieter Betz reads:

Variations of the ritual exist, allowing for adaptations to different traditions and personal preferences, but the core elements remain consistent. Common challenges include maintaining concentration and navigating the intense energies invoked, which can be overwhelming for the unprepared practitioner. However, with practice and experience, these challenges can be managed effectively. The Bornless Ritual demands a high level of commitment and discipline, but its rewards in terms of spiritual empowerment and enlightenment make it a cornerstone of ceremonial magic practice.

==Spiritual and psychological effects==
The spiritual and psychological effects of the Bornless Ritual are multifaceted. Practitioners often report a heightened sense of spiritual clarity and connection, experiencing visions or insights during and after the ritual. The repetitive and rhythmic nature of the invocation induces a trance-like state, facilitating deeper meditation and introspection. This process can lead to significant personal transformations, as the practitioner confronts and transcends inner obstacles.

The ritual also fosters a sense of empowerment and divine presence, reinforcing the practitioner’s spiritual path and commitment to their esoteric practices. By invoking the Bornless One and aligning with its attributes, practitioners may feel a stronger connection to their higher self and the divine. This connection can result in enhanced spiritual resilience and an increased ability to handle life&#x27;s challenges with greater equanimity. Regular practice of the Bornless Ritual is thought to contribute to long-term spiritual development, facilitating ongoing growth and deeper understanding of one&#x27;s place within the cosmos.

==Retreat and intensive practice==
In modern esoteric practice, the Bornless Ritual is often integrated into intensive retreat settings to potentiate its effects. Inspired by the Abramelin operation, these retreats can span several months. Crowley developed a six-month version detailed in &quot;Liber VIII&quot;. During these retreats, practitioners focus intensively on the ritual, aiming to achieve the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. The extended period of focused practice allows for deeper spiritual engagement and transformation, enhancing the ritual&#x27;s efficacy and impact.

Reports from practitioners who have undertaken these intensive retreats often mention profound psychological and spiritual experiences. Many practitioners describe encounters with Jungian archetypes, which are symbolic representations of universal human experiences and emotions. These archetypes can emerge during the deep meditative and trance states induced by the ritual, providing insights into the practitioner&#x27;s unconscious mind.

Additionally, some practitioners report experiencing atavistic resurgence, where ancient, primal aspects of the psyche surface during the ritual. These experiences can be both enlightening and challenging, as they confront practitioners with deeply buried aspects of their psyche that require integration and understanding. The intensive nature of the retreat amplifies these experiences, making the Bornless Ritual a powerful tool for deep psychological and spiritual work.

==Scholarly perspectives==
Scholarly interest in the Bornless Ritual spans various disciplines, including religious studies, anthropology, and psychology. Researchers analyze its historical roots, comparing it with similar rituals across different cultures and epochs. Academic studies often focus on the ritual’s linguistic and symbolic components, exploring their psychological impacts and the mechanisms by which they induce altered states of consciousness.

While scholars critique efficacy of prayer from a scientific perspective, others acknowledge its cultural and spiritual significance, contributing to a broader understanding of esoteric practices. Jake Stratton-Kent has produced a robust analysis, examining its historical and practical aspects in detail. Richard Kaczynski&#x27;s work on Aleister Crowley and Thelema also provides valuable insights into the ritual&#x27;s context and evolution. Contemporary researchers continue to explore its applications and adaptations in modern occultism, examining how the ritual evolves and maintains its relevance. The interplay between tradition and innovation in the Bornless Ritual offers rich material for ongoing scholarly investigation.

==Long-term impact==
Over time, regular practice of the Bornless Ritual is thought to have enduring effects on a practitioner&#x27;s spiritual and psychological development. It aids in the integration of spiritual principles into daily life, promoting a balanced and harmonious existence. The ritual’s emphasis on divine invocation and spiritual alignment cultivates resilience and adaptability, enabling practitioners to navigate life&#x27;s challenges with greater ease.

The Bornless Ritual also deepens the practitioner&#x27;s understanding of their place within the cosmos, reinforcing a sense of purpose and interconnectedness. This ongoing process of spiritual purification and empowerment can lead to lasting changes in one&#x27;s worldview and personal growth. The ritual’s ability to evoke spiritual experiences and foster psychological resilience underscores its enduring value in the esoteric tradition, particularly in Thelema, where the pursuit of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is central.

<text>KUOW-FM (94.9 MHz) is a National Public Radio member station in Seattle, Washington. It is the largest of the three full-fledged NPR member stations in the Seattle and Tacoma media market, with two Tacoma-based stations, KNKX and KVTI being the others. It is a service of the University of Washington, but is operated by KUOW Puget Sound Public Radio, a nonprofit community organization. Studios are located on University Way in Seattle&#x27;s University District, while the transmitter is on Capitol Hill.

==History==
KUOW went on the air in 1952 on 90.5 FM. Its transmitter was on the University of Washington campus atop the Administration Building, now Gerberding Hall. In 1958, Dorothy Stimson Bullitt moved KING-FM to 98.1 and gifted KING&#x27;s 94.9 FM transmitter and antenna to the Edison Vocational School. That same year, KUOW started using the 94.9 FM transmitter operated by Edison. KUOW is one of the few public radio (or any non-commercial educational) stations in the United States broadcasting on a frequency outside of the reserved band (88–92 MHz; Seattle is also home to KING-FM on 98.1, which became a non-commercial station in 2010). From its 1954 sign-on until 1987, KUOW was a sister station to educational/NET television outlet (and now PBS member station) KCTS-TV (channel 9); the university spun off KCTS in 1987 and became a community licensee.

In the 1960s, however, KUOW began branching out, adding more news programming. It was a charter member of NPR in 1970. In 1992, it changed format from music to news and information, and in 1999 it moved off campus to its current location on University Way. Also in 1999, UW outsourced the station&#x27;s operation to Puget Sound Public Radio.

In late March 2020, KUOW &quot;made an editorial decision to stop airing White House briefings on the coronavirus pandemic live on a daily basis.&quot; A statement from the station asserted that the decision was not politically based, and their &quot;greater concern was the potential impact of false information on the health and safety of our community.&quot;

For several weeks in January and February 2022, a technical glitch with HD Radio caused the infotainment systems of Mazda vehicles made between 2014 and 2017 to only play KUOW&#x27;s signal and flash repeatedly. Mazda blamed the issue on a missing file extension in KUOW&#x27;s station logo; KUOW had ruled out a theory that the rollout of 5G networks had interfered with the existing 3G data received by infotainment systems.

==Audience==
KUOW reported that the station served an average of 413,600 listeners each week in 2019, down from 447,100 in 2018. The station also reported that their on-demand audio and podcasts received 2.9 million downloads total.

KUOW-FM broadcasts in HD. On March 7, 2018, KUOW made the decision to discontinue the HD2, HD3, and HD4 subchannels. &quot;KUOW2&quot; continues to be transmitted on translator K214EW 90.7 and KQOW-HD2 in Bellingham, while KUOW Jazz was discontinued. The main analog signal continues to be simulcast on HD1.

KUOW is also carried on the following satellite and broadcast translator stations to improve reception of the station:

* KQOW 90.3 FM Bellingham
* KUOW 1340 AM Tumwater and Olympia

==Finances==
For KUOW&#x27;s fiscal year ending June 30, 2019, the station reported total revenue of $18,732,286 and total expenses of $18,339,864, for a net gain of $392,422. Its sources of revenue were:

* 68% individuals
* 24% businesses
* 6% institutions such as Corporation for Public Broadcasting and University of Washington
* 2% other expenses such as interest and dividends or donated services and supplies

==Programs==
KUOW broadcast the Washington Talking Book and Braille Library&#x27;s Evergreen Radio Reading Service to blind and handicapped listeners on its 67 kHz subcarrier, until the service&#x27;s closure on August 15, 2014. KUOW was one of three major FM stations in Washington to do so; KPBX-FM in Spokane and KFAE-FM in Yakima were the others.

=== Music programming ===
* &quot;The Swing Years and Beyond&quot;: a program that ran from 1968 to 2017 featuring jazz, swing, and blues music from the early 20th century.

=== Podcasts ===

* &quot;Battle Tactics for Your Sexist Workplace&quot;
* &quot;How&#x27;s Your Day?&quot;
* &quot;KUOW Newsroom&quot;
* &quot;KUOW Shorts&quot;
* &quot;Primed&quot;
* &quot;Radioactive&quot;
* &quot;Seattle Now&quot;
* &quot;Second Wave&quot;
* &quot;SoundQs&quot;
* &quot;Speakers Forum&quot;
* &quot;The Wild With Chris Morgan&quot;

==== How to Be a Girl ====

&quot;How to Be a Girl&quot; is a parenting podcast hosted by a mother using the pseudonym Marlo Mack to discuss her experiences raising her transgender child. Mack had been recording her child since she was a baby and had recently joined a local radio club when her daughter began expressing that she was not a boy, which lead to the production of the podcast. The podcast has been nominated for a Peabody award and has won both a Webby award for best writing as well as the international award from the British Podcast Awards. Freddie McConnell of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the show calling it a &quot;tender take on an under-represented reality&quot; and Katy Cowan of &quot;Creative Boom&quot; praised the show saying that it was &quot;a revealing and often emotional podcast.&quot;

==== The Record ====
&quot;The Record&quot; is KUOW&#x27;s flagship local news and interview podcast hosted by Bill Radke that debuted in the fall of 2013 and ended in July 2021. After a neo-Nazi was punched for wearing a Nazi band in public, Radke interviewed the neo-Nazi on the show, which was received negatively from the show&#x27;s audience and led to Radke apologizing for doing the interview. &quot;Week in Review&quot; is the Friday edition of &quot;The Record&quot;, which won an award in 1996 for the best commentary and analysis from the Society for Professional Journalist.

==== Soundside ====
&quot;Soundside&quot; is a midday news podcast hosted by Libby Denkman that airs on KUOW on Mondays through Thursdays. The show was created after &quot;The Record&quot; ended.

==== Terrestrial ====

&quot;Terrestrial&quot; was an environmental podcast hosted by Ashley Ahearn which ran from April 2017 until December 2017. Ahearn started the podcast because she felt that most environmental journalism is impersonal and she wanted to explore how individuals cope with climate change rather than the discouraging state of the world. The podcast was nominated for &quot;Best Green Podcast&quot; in 2020 at the iHeartRadio Podcast Awards and was featured on &quot;Outside Online&quot; as the best environmental podcast of 2017. Jillian Capewell of &quot;HuffPost&quot; praised the show saying that the podcast is an &quot;informative show in a sound-rich and powerful audioscape&quot; and Rowan Slaney of &quot;The Guardian&quot; praised the show saying that &quot;it absolutely blew me away.&quot;

<doc id="856614" wikidata="Q1095535" url="?curid=856614" title="Čech cohomology">
<text>In mathematics, specifically algebraic topology, Čech cohomology is a cohomology theory based on the intersection properties of open covers of a topological space. It is named for the mathematician Eduard Čech.

==Motivation==
Let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space, and let formula_1 be an open cover of &quot;X&quot;. Let formula_2 denote the nerve of the covering. The idea of Čech cohomology is that, for an open cover formula_1 consisting of sufficiently small open sets, the resulting simplicial complex formula_2 should be a good combinatorial model for the space &quot;X&quot;. For such a cover, the Čech cohomology of &quot;X&quot; is defined to be the simplicial cohomology of the nerve. This idea can be formalized by the notion of a good cover. However, a more general approach is to take the direct limit of the cohomology groups of the nerve over the system of all possible open covers of &quot;X&quot;, ordered by refinement. This is the approach adopted below.

==Construction==

Let &quot;X&quot; be a topological space, and let formula_5 be a presheaf of abelian groups on &quot;X&quot;. Let formula_1 be an open cover of &quot;X&quot;.

===Simplex===
A &quot;q&quot;-simplex σ of formula_1 is an ordered collection of &quot;q&quot;+1 sets chosen from formula_1, such that the intersection of all these sets is non-empty. This intersection is called the &quot;support&quot; of σ and is denoted |σ|.

Now let formula_9 be such a &quot;q&quot;-simplex. The &quot;j-th partial boundary&quot; of σ is defined to be the (&quot;q&quot;−1)-simplex obtained by removing the &quot;j&quot;-th set from σ, that is: 

:formula_10

The &quot;boundary&quot; of σ is defined as the alternating sum of the partial boundaries:

:formula_11

viewed as an element of the free abelian group spanned by the simplices of formula_1.

===Cochain===
A &quot;q&quot;-cochain of formula_1 with coefficients in formula_5 is a map which associates with each &quot;q&quot;-simplex σ an element of formula_15, and we denote the set of all &quot;q&quot;-cochains of formula_1 with coefficients in formula_5 by formula_18. formula_18 is an abelian group by pointwise addition.

===Differential===
The cochain groups can be made into a cochain complex formula_20 by defining the coboundary operator formula_21 by:

formula_22

where formula_23 is the restriction morphism from formula_24 to formula_25 (Notice that ∂jσ ⊆ σ, but σ ⊆ ∂jσ.)

A calculation shows that formula_26

The coboundary operator is analogous to the exterior derivative of De Rham cohomology, so it sometimes called 
the differential of the cochain complex.

====Cocycle====
A &quot;q&quot;-cochain is called a &quot;q&quot;-cocycle if it is in the kernel of formula_27, hence formula_28 is the set of all &quot;q&quot;-cocycles.

Thus a (&quot;q&quot;−1)-cochain formula_29 is a cocycle if for all &quot;q&quot;-simplices formula_30 the cocycle condition 

:formula_31 

holds. 

A 0-cocycle formula_29 is a collection of local sections of formula_5 satisfying a compatibility relation on every intersecting formula_34

:formula_35

A 1-cocycle formula_29 satisfies for every non-empty formula_37 with formula_38

:formula_39

====Coboundary====
A &quot;q&quot;-cochain is called a &quot;q&quot;-coboundary if it is in the image of formula_27 and formula_41 is the set of all &quot;q&quot;-coboundaries.

For example, a 1-cochain formula_29 is a 1-coboundary if there exists a 0-cochain formula_43 such that for every intersecting formula_34

:formula_45

===Cohomology===

The Čech cohomology of formula_1 with values in formula_5 is defined to be the cohomology of the cochain complex formula_48. Thus the &quot;q&quot;th Čech cohomology is given by

:formula_49.

The Čech cohomology of &quot;X&quot; is defined by considering refinements of open covers. If formula_50 is a refinement of formula_1 then there is a map in cohomology formula_52 The open covers of &quot;X&quot; form a directed set under refinement, so the above map leads to a direct system of abelian groups. The Čech cohomology of &quot;X&quot; with values in &quot;formula_5&quot; is defined as the direct limit formula_54 of this system.

The Čech cohomology of &quot;X&quot; with coefficients in a fixed abelian group &quot;A&quot;, denoted formula_55, is defined as formula_56 where formula_57 is the constant sheaf on &quot;X&quot; determined by &quot;A&quot;.

A variant of Čech cohomology, called numerable Čech cohomology, is defined as above, except that all open covers considered are required to be &quot;numerable&quot;: that is, there is a partition of unity {ρ&quot;i&quot;} such that each support formula_58 is contained in some element of the cover. If &quot;X&quot; is paracompact and Hausdorff, then numerable Čech cohomology agrees with the usual Čech cohomology.

==Relation to other cohomology theories==

If &quot;X&quot; is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex, then the Čech cohomology formula_59 is naturally isomorphic to the singular cohomology formula_60. If &quot;X&quot; is a differentiable manifold, then formula_61 is also naturally isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology; the article on de Rham cohomology provides a brief review of this isomorphism. For less well-behaved spaces, Čech cohomology differs from singular cohomology. For example if &quot;X&quot; is the closed topologist&#x27;s sine curve, then formula_62 whereas formula_63

If &quot;X&quot; is a differentiable manifold and the cover formula_1 of &quot;X&quot; is a &quot;good cover&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; all the sets &quot;U&quot;α are contractible to a point, and all finite intersections of sets in formula_1 are either empty or contractible to a point), then formula_66 is isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology.

If &quot;X&quot; is compact Hausdorff, then Čech cohomology (with coefficients in a discrete group) is isomorphic to Alexander-Spanier cohomology.

For a presheaf formula_5 on &quot;X&quot;, let formula_68 denote its sheafification. Then we have a natural comparison map

:formula_69

from Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology. If &quot;X&quot; is paracompact Hausdorff, then formula_70 is an isomorphism. More generally, formula_70 is an isomorphism whenever the Čech cohomology of all presheaves on &quot;X&quot; with zero sheafification vanishes.

==In algebraic geometry==
Čech cohomology can be defined more generally for objects in a site C endowed with a topology. This applies, for example, to the Zariski site or the etale site of a scheme &quot;X&quot;. The Čech cohomology with values in some sheaf formula_5 is defined as

:formula_73

where the colimit runs over all coverings (with respect to the chosen topology) of &quot;X&quot;. Here formula_74 is defined as above, except that the &quot;r&quot;-fold intersections of open subsets inside the ambient topological space are replaced by the &quot;r&quot;-fold fiber product

:formula_75

As in the classical situation of topological spaces, there is always a map

:formula_76

from Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology. It is always an isomorphism in degrees &quot;n&quot; = 0 and 1, but may fail to be so in general. For the Zariski topology on a Noetherian separated scheme, Čech and sheaf cohomology agree for any quasi-coherent sheaf. For the étale topology, the two cohomologies agree for any étale sheaf on &quot;X&quot;, provided that any finite set of points of &quot;X&quot; are contained in some open affine subscheme. This is satisfied, for example, if &quot;X&quot; is quasi-projective over an affine scheme.

The possible difference between Čech cohomology and sheaf cohomology is a motivation for the use of hypercoverings: these are more general objects than the Čech nerve

:formula_77

A hypercovering &quot;K&quot;∗ of &quot;X&quot; is a certain simplicial object in C, i.e., a collection of objects &quot;K&quot;&quot;n&quot; together with boundary and degeneracy maps. Applying a sheaf formula_5 to &quot;K&quot;∗ yields a simplicial abelian group formula_79 whose &quot;n&quot;-th cohomology group is denoted formula_80. (This group is the same as formula_74 in case &quot;K&quot;∗ equals formula_82.) Then, it can be shown that there is a canonical isomorphism

:formula_83

where the colimit now runs over all hypercoverings.

=== Examples ===
The most basic example of Čech cohomology is given by the case where the presheaf formula_5 is a constant sheaf, e.g. formula_85. In such cases, each formula_86-cochain formula_29 is simply a function which maps every formula_86-simplex to formula_89. For example, we calculate the first Čech cohomology with values in formula_89 of the unit circle formula_91. Dividing formula_92 into three arcs and choosing sufficiently small open neighborhoods, we obtain an open cover formula_93 where formula_94 but formula_95.

Given any 1-cocycle formula_29, formula_97 is a 2-cochain which takes inputs of the form formula_98 where formula_99 (since formula_95 and hence formula_101 is not a 2-simplex for any permutation formula_102). The first three inputs give formula_103; the fourth gives

:formula_104

Such a function is fully determined by the values of formula_105. Thus,

:formula_106

On the other hand, given any 1-coboundary formula_107, we have

:formula_108

However, upon closer inspection we see that formula_109 and hence each 1-coboundary formula_29 is uniquely determined by formula_111 and formula_112. This gives the set of 1-coboundaries:

:formula_113

Therefore, formula_114. Since formula_1 is a good cover of formula_92, we have formula_117 by Leray&#x27;s theorem.

We may also compute the coherent sheaf cohomology of formula_118 on the projective line formula_119 using the Čech complex. Using the cover

:formula_120

we have the following modules from the cotangent sheaf

:formula_121

If we take the conventions that formula_122 then we get the Čech complex

:formula_123

Since formula_124 is injective and the only element not in the image of formula_124 is formula_126 we get that

:formula_127

<text>Tamil Nadu Dr. Ambedkar Law University (TNDALU) is a public state university established in 1997 at Chennai, India by the Government of Tamil Nadu under &quot;The Tamil Nadu Dr. Ambedkar Law University Act, 1996&quot;, which also brought all law colleges in Tamil Nadu under the control of the university. It was named after B. R. Ambedkar, an Indian jurist, social reformer and the architect the Constitution of India. The university was inaugurated on 20 September 1997 by K. R. Narayanan, former president of India. The university started a law school on its own campus in 2002 as the School of Excellence in Law, Chennai (SOEL).

==Academics==
At the undergraduate level, SOEL has a three-year course leading to a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.), and five-year integrated double-degree courses leading to a combination between a LL.B. and a Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Computing, Bachelor of Business Administration, or Bachelor of Computer Application.

The Postgraduate Department provides Master of Laws degrees across nine different branches.

==Campus==
Chief minister J. Jayalalithaa in February 2016 unveiled a state-of-the-art campus for the TN Dr Ambedkar Law University at Perungudi next to Taramani MRTS station. The new campus has separate blocks for administration and classes, besides a library at a cost of 59.27 crore. The CM opened the facility through video conferencing from her chamber at the Secretariat. The campus also has hostel facilities for girls and a playground with gallery.

<text>Effervescence is the escape of gas from an aqueous solution and the foaming or fizzing that results from that release. The word effervescence is derived from the Latin verb &quot;fervere&quot; (to boil), preceded by the adverb &quot;ex&quot;. It has the same linguistic root as the word fermentation.

Effervescence can also be observed when opening a bottle of champagne, beer or carbonated beverages such as some carbonated soft drinks. The visible bubbles are produced by the escape from solution of the dissolved gas (which itself is not visible while dissolved in the liquid).

== In beverages ==

Although CO2 is most common for beverages, nitrogen gas is sometimes deliberately added to certain beers. The smaller bubble size creates a smoother beer head. Due to the poor solubility of nitrogen in beer, kegs or widgets are used for this.

== Chemistry ==

In the laboratory, a common example of effervescence is seen if hydrochloric acid is added to a block of limestone. If a few pieces of marble or an antacid tablet are put in hydrochloric acid in a test tube fitted with a bung, effervescence of carbon dioxide can be witnessed.
This process is generally represented by the following reaction, where a pressurized dilute solution of carbonic acid in water releases gaseous carbon dioxide at decompression:

In simple terms, it is the result of the chemical reaction occurring in the liquid which produces a gaseous product.

<text>The Friden Flexowriter was a teleprinter produced by the Friden Calculating Machine Company. It was a heavy-duty electric typewriter capable of being driven not only by a human typing, but also automatically by several methods, including direct attachment to a computer and by use of paper tape.

Elements of the design date to the 1920s, and variants of the machine were produced until the early 1970s; the machines found a variety of uses during the evolution of office equipment in the 20th century, including being among the first electric typewriters, computer input and output devices, forerunners of modern word processing, and also having roles in the machine tool and printing industries.

==History==

===Origins and early history===
The Flexowriter can trace its roots to some of the earliest electric typewriters. In 1925, the Remington Typewriter Company wanted to expand their offerings to include electric typewriters. Having little expertise or manufacturing ability with electrical appliances, they partnered with Northeast Electric Company of Rochester and made a production run of 2500 electric typewriters. When the time came to make more units, Remington was suffering a management vacuum and could not complete contract negotiations, so Northeast began work on their own electric typewriter. In 1929, they started selling the Electromatic.

In 1931, Northeast was bought by Delco. Delco had no interest in a typewriter product line, so they spun the product off as a separate company called Electromatic. Around this time, Electromatic built a prototype automatic typewriter. This device used a wide roll of paper, similar to a player piano roll. For each key on the typewriter, there was a column on the roll of paper. If the key was to be pressed, then a hole was punched in the column for that key.

The Electromatic typewriter patents document the use of pivoted spiral cams operating against a hard rubber drive roller to drive the print mechanism. This was the foundation of essentially all later electric typewriters. The typewriter could be equipped with a &quot;remote control&quot; mechanism allowing one typewriter to control another or to record and play back typed data through a parallel data connection with one wire per typewriter key. The Electromatic tape perforator used a wide tape, with punch position per key on the keyboard.

In 1932, a code for the paper tape used to drive Linotype and other typesetting machines was standardized. This allowed use of a tape only five to seven holes wide to drive automatic typewriters, teleprinters and similar equipment.

In 1933, IBM wanted to enter the electric typewriter market, and purchased the Electromatic Corporation, renaming the typewriter the IBM Model 01, and continuing to use the Electromatic trademark.

IBM experimented with several accessories and enhancements for its electric typewriter. In 1942, IBM filed a patent application for a typewriter that could print justified and proportionally spaced text. This required recording each line of text on a paper tape before it was printed. IBM experimented with a 12-hole paper tape compatible with their punched-card code.
Eventually, IBM settled on a six-hole encoding, as documented in their automatic justifying typewriter patents filed in 1945. Equipping an electric typewriter with both a paper-tape reader and punch created the basic foundation for what would become the Flexowriter.

By the late 1930s, IBM had a nearly complete monopoly on unit record equipment and related punched card machinery, and expanding the product line into automatic typewriters equipped with paper tape raised antitrust issues. As a result, IBM sold the product line and factory to the Commercial Controls Corporation (CCC) of Rochester, New York, which also absorbed the National Postal Meter Corporation. CCC was formed by several former IBM employees.

===World War II===
Around the time of World War II, CCC developed a proportional spacing model of the Flexowriter known as The Presidential (or sometimes the President). The model name was derived from the fact that these units were used to generate the White House letters informing families of the deaths of service personnel in the war. CCC also manufactured other complex mechanical devices for the war effort, including M1 carbines.

In 1944, the pioneering Harvard Mark I computer was constructed, using an Electromatic for output.

===Postwar===
In 1950, Edwin O. Blodgett filed a patent application on behalf of Commercial Controls Corporation for a &quot;tape controlled typewriter.&quot; This machine used a six-level punched paper tape, and was the basis for the machines CCC and Friden built over the next 15 years. This improved machine was contemporaneous with the first generation of commercial computers. Applications for Flexowriters exploded in the 1950s, covering territory in commercial printing, machine tools, computers, and many forms of office automation. This versatility was helped by Friden&#x27;s willingness to engineer and build many different configurations. In the late 1950s, CCC was purchased by Friden, a maker of electromechanical calculators, and it was under their name that the machines achieved their greatest diversity and success; applications are further detailed below.

Two tape stations allowed production of what was then called the form letter, the combination of standard text (one tape) with varying name and address information (the other tape).

===End of product line===

Edwin Blodgett, Chief Engineer of Friden R&amp;D, was replaced in 1964. It is unclear what effect this had on development, especially as Blodgett was apparently biased against electronics, favoring electromechanical solutions to design problems.

Friden was acquired by the Singer Corporation in 1965. Singer had little or no understanding of the computer industry, and there was a clash of corporate culture with Friden employees.

There was a major redesign of the Flexowriter in the mid 1960s. The Model 2201 Programatic, introduced in 1965, had a sleek modern styling and 13 programmable function keys. This was the first major change in appearance of Flexowriters in nearly forty years. Programming was done using a 320-contact plugboard, and all of the logic was implemented using relays. The case, although modern looking, was entirely metal, giving the machine a shipping weight of 132 pounds (60 kg). The selling price was £2900 (British pounds).

Although primarily sold as a stand-alone word processor (a term not yet in use at the time), Friden also sold it with a communications option allowing it to be used as a computer terminal. Members of the 2200 family operated at 135 words per minute (11.3 characters per second). The family also included the 2210 and 2211, on which the function keys were replaced with a numeric keypad, and the 2261, using ASCII instead of the proprietary eight-bit code used by other members of the 2200 family.

The 2300 series were cosmetically similar to the 2200 series, although without the function keys or numeric keypad, with a simplified plugboard, and operating at 145 words per minute (12 characters per second). In addition to the basic 2301, the 2302 supported the auxiliary tape readers and punches from the 2200 family. The 2304 offered proportional spacing and a carbon ribbon mechanism, making it suitable for preparing camera-ready copy. The base price for the 2300 family was £1400 (British pounds). This would be the last hurrah for the line, with production halting in the early 1970s.

Sales and innovation declined. In the late 1960s, the market for word processing equipment was shifting to magnetic media. IBM introduced the Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter (MT/ST) in 1964. In October, 1968, Information Control Systems introduced the Astrotype word processing system. Both of these used magnetic tape and Selectric print mechanisms. With its fixed type font and paper-tape recording medium, the Flexowriter had difficulty competing with these machines, although some Flexowriter documentation emphasized the fact that, unlike IBM&#x27;s MT/ST tapes, Flexowriter users could cut and splice paper tapes, particularly if they could recognize some of the common codes such as carriage return.

The Diablo daisy wheel printer, introduced in 1969, offered comparable print quality at twice the speed. Larger manufacturers such as IBM and DEC made their own console equipment, and video terminals began to appear, displacing paper-based systems. Eventually, even the CNC machine tool industry abandoned paper tape, although this was significantly slower because of the long working life of machine tools.

==Applications==

===Automatic typewriters===

From its earliest days through to at least the mid-1960s, Flexowriters were used as automatic letter writers.

While the US White House was using them during the Second World War, in the 1960s, United States Members of Congress used Flexowriters extensively to handle enormous volumes of routine correspondence with constituents; an advantage of this method was that these letters appeared to have been individually typed by hand. These were complemented by autopen machines which could use a pen to place a signature on letters making them appear to have been hand-signed.

Auxiliary paper-tape readers could be attached to a Flexowriter to create an early form of &quot;mail merge&quot;, where a long custom-created tape containing individual addresses and salutations was merged with a closed-loop form-letter and printed on continuous-form letterhead; both tapes contained embedded &quot;control characters&quot; to switch between readers.

===Console terminals===
As the unit record equipment (tabulating machine) industry matured and became the computer industry, Flexowriters were commonly used as console terminals for computers. Because ASCII character coding had not yet been standardized, each type of computer tended to use its own system for encoding characters; Flexowriters were capable of being configured with numerous encodings particular to the computer system the machine was being used with.

Computers that used Flexowriters as consoles include:
* The Electromatic on the Harvard Mark I
* The MIT Whirlwind I computer, first designed to control a flight simulator, and later becoming the basis of the SAGE network.
* The Lincoln Laboratory TX-0, an early experimental transistor-based minicomputer, which was to be a seminal influence on hacker culture at MIT in the late 1950s prior to the introduction of the PDP-1.
* The BMEWS DIP computer, NORAD Combat Operations Center (COC), Colorado Springs, Colo., beginning in 1960. Tape code was essentially base-32.
*Electrodata 205. ElectroData was purchased by the Burroughs Corporation, and many later Burroughs machines also used Flexowriters
* The Librascope LGP-30 and LGP-21
* The Packard Bell PB 250
* The SEA CAB 500
* The ALWAC III-E
* The English Electric KDF9.

The Whirlwind I deployment in 1955 is notable as it seems to have been the first time that a typewriter-like input device was directly connected to a general-purpose electronic computer, becoming directly ancestral to today&#x27;s computer keyboards.

===Offline punch and printer===
Flexowriters could also be used as offline punches and printers. Programmers would type their programs on Flexowriters, which would punch the program onto paper tape. The tapes could then be loaded into computers to run the programs. Computers could then use their own punches to make paper tapes that could be used by the Flexowriters to print output. Among the computers which commonly used Flexowriters for this task was the DEC PDP-1.

===Machine tools===
The ability to support diverse encodings meant that adapting Flexowriters to generate the paper tapes used to drive CNC machine tool equipment was a relatively simple affair, and many Flexowriters found homes in machine shops into the 1970s, when magnetic media displaced paper tape in the industry.

===Unit record and early computing===
Friden manufactured equipment which could connect their calculators to Flexowriters, printing output and performing unit record tasks such as form letters for bills, and eventually manufactured their own computers to further enhance these capabilities. These variants were sold as the Friden Computyper. Computypers were electromechanical; they had no electronics, at least in their earlier models. The calculator mechanism, inside a desk-like enclosure, was much like a Friden model STW desktop calculator, except that it had electrical input (via solenoids) and output (low-torque rotary switches on the dial shafts) .

===Commercial printing===

A product known as the Justowriter (or Just-O-Writer) was developed for the printing industry. It allowed typists to produce justified text for use in typesetting. This worked by having the user type the document on a Recording unit, which placed extra codes for spacing on the paper tape. The tape was placed into a second specially adapted Flexowriter which had two paper tape reading heads; one would read the text while the other controlled the spacing of the print. Spacing codes were stored in relays inside the machine as a line of text progressed. At least some Justowriters used carbon (as opposed to ink-impregnated fabric) ribbons to produce cleaner type, suitable for mass photo-set reproduction, sometimes referred to as cold type composition.

The Line Casting Control or LCC product generated paper tapes for Linotype and Intertype automatic typesetters. In addition to punching a tape containing the text to be typeset, it turned on a lamp easily seen by the operator to show that the text on the line being typed could be typeset—it was within justifiable range. The LCC had a four-wheel rotary escapement, and a set of gears between the carriage rack and the escapement, to permit the smallest unit of spacing at the escapement to be quite small at the carriage. The spring-tensioned tape that moved the carriage had far more tension (possibly 20 lbs?) than did a standard Flexowriter.

American Type Founders produced a phototypesetter based on the Justowriter/Flexowriter platform.

===Finance===
There was an &quot;accounting&quot; model with an ultra-wide carriage and two-color ribbon for printing out wide financial reports. The Friden accounting model was called &quot;5010 COMPUTYPER&quot; and was capable of arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication &amp; division) at electronic speeds and to print the results automatically in a useful document.

==Hardware==
As a cutting edge device of their time, Flexowriters, especially some of the specialized types like typesetters, were quite costly. They were made for extreme durability. There were porous sintered bronze bearings, many hardened steel parts, very strong springs, and a substantial AC motor to move all the parts. Most parts are made of heavy gauge steel. The housing and most removable covers were heavy die castings. While the final Singer models did make some use of plastics, even they were quite heavy compared to other electric typewriters of their time.

As a result, the platen carriage was very heavy, and when the &quot;Carriage Return&quot; key was pressed, the carriage moved with about of force and enough momentum to injure a careless operator. If used only as manual typewriters, and properly maintained, Flexowriters might last a century. When reproducing form letters from punched tape, the considerable speed and loud sound of the device made watching it a somewhat frightening experience.

Towards the bottom of the unit there was a large rubber roller (&quot;power roll&quot;) that rotated continuously at a few hundred rpm. It provided power for typing as well as power-operated backspace, type basket shift, and power for engaging (and probably disengaging) the carriage return clutch.

Referring to the photo of the cam assembly (often simply called a cam; it was not meant to be disassembled), the holes in the side plates at the lower left were for the assembly&#x27;s pivot rod, which was fixed to the frame. At the extreme upper left was part of a disconnectable pivot that pulled down on the typing linkage. As installed, &quot;down&quot; was to the right in the photo.

Referring again to the part at the upper left, the mating part had a threaded mounting for adjusting cam clearance from the power roll. The irregular &quot;roundish&quot; part, lower right center, was the cam itself. It rotated in the frame while in contact with the power roll. The surface of the cam in contact with the power roll had grooves for better grip. As the radius at the contact patch increased, the frame rotated clockwise to pull down on the linkage to type the character.

This particular cam assembly had a cam that rotated a full turn for each operation; it might operate the backspace, basket shift, or carriage-return clutch disengage mechanism. Cams for typing characters rotated only half a turn, the halves being identical.

Below the cam in this photo (hidden) was a spring-loaded lever that pushed against a pin on the cam. On the upper edge of the cam, as shown, was a little projection that engaged the release lever, which was at the lowest part of the image; this was an irregular shape.

When a key was pressed down, it moved the release lever and unlatched the cam for that letter; the spring-loaded lever pressing on the pin rotated the cam until it engaged the power roll. As the cam continued to turn, increasing radius rotated the cam&#x27;s frame slightly (clockwise in the photo) to operate the typing linkage for that character.

As the cam continued to rotate, the spring-loaded lever pushed on the pin to move it toward home position, but if the key were still down, the cam (now out of contact with the power roll) stalled because the projection on the cam would catch on another part of the release lever. The cam stalled until the key was released. When released, the lever would catch the projection so the cam was now in home position. This resembled a simple clock escapement, and prevented repeated typing. (The &quot;key-down&quot; anti-repeat stop could be removed, so that fast repetitive typing could be done, but this change was difficult to undo.)

Carriage return was done by a non-stretch very durable textile tape attached to the platen advance mechanism at the left of the carriage. For a return, the tape wound up on a small reel operated from the drive system through a clutch. A cam engaged the clutch; it was disengaged by the left margin stop, perhaps directly, perhaps via another cam. A light-torque spring kept the return tape wound on the reel.
The basic mechanism looked just like an IBM electric typewriter from the late 1940s. In fact, some Flexowriter parts were identical in fit and function to the early IBM electric typewriters (those with rotary carriage escapements, a gear-driven power roll, and a governor-controlled variable speed &quot;universal&quot; (wound-rotor/commutator) motor).

The early IBM rotary-escapement proportional-spacing typewriters (three wheel rotary escapement, spur gear differentials) had code bars to control the amount of carriage movement for the current character. They were operated by the cams. However, the Flexowriter&#x27;s mechanical encoder was a very different and far more rugged design, although still operated by the cams.
Flexowriters (at least those prior to 1969) do not have transistors; electrical control operations were done with telephone-style (E-Class) relays, and troubleshooting often involved problems with the timing on the relays. Another reader has also found that the timing settings of the various leaf switches (such as in the tape reader) are also important.

The screws used in the Flexowriter were unique, having large flat heads with a very narrow screwdriver slot and a unique thread size and pitch. This may have been a conscious decision. Another reader found that standard 4-40UNC threads appear to fit some of the cover-attachments; internally, the headless set-screws require fluted Bristol keys, which were not commonly available in Great Britain.

There was a holder for a large roll of paper tape on the back of the unit, with tape feeding around to a punch on the left side, toward the rear. The tape reader was on the same side, toward the front, and was essentially identical to the reader shown on the front of the square housing in the photo of the auxiliary reader. The right side of a Flexowriter had a large (~1&quot;) connector for hooking the unit up to computers and other equipment. Depending on the model, this connector might be wired in many different ways.

At various times and in various configurations, &quot;Flexos&quot; came with 5-, 6-, 7-, or 8-channel paper tape reader/punches, could have several auxiliary paper tape units attached, and could also attach to IBM punched card equipment.

<doc id="856624" wikidata="Q3561500" url="?curid=856624" title="Vive le Québec libre">
<text>&quot; (, &#x27;Long live free Quebec!&#x27;) was a phrase in a speech delivered by French President Charles de Gaulle in Montreal, Quebec on July 24, 1967, during an official visit to Canada for the Expo 67 world&#x27;s fair. While giving an address to a large crowd from a balcony at Montreal City Hall, he uttered (&quot;Long live Montreal! Long live Quebec!&quot;) and then added, followed by loud applause, (&quot;Long live free Quebec!&quot;) with particular emphasis on the word . The phrase, a slogan used by Quebecers who favoured Quebec sovereignty, was seen as giving his support to the movement.

The speech caused a diplomatic incident with the Government of Canada and was condemned by Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson, saying that &quot;Canadians do not need to be liberated&quot;. In France, though many were sympathetic to the cause of Quebec nationalism, De Gaulle&#x27;s speech was criticized as a breach of protocol.

==Background==
Even before his arrival, the Canadian federal government had been concerned about President de Gaulle&#x27;s visit. Earlier that year, the French government had not sent a high-level representative to the funeral service for the Governor General of Canada, Georges Vanier. This attracted notice in Canada, as Vanier and his wife, Pauline, had been personal friends of de Gaulle since 1940, when the latter was in exile in London, England. In April, de Gaulle did not attend the 50th anniversary ceremonies commemorating the Canadian victory at Vimy Ridge. So worried was the Pearson government about potential interference of France in domestic affairs that the Canadian Secretary of State for External Affairs, Paul Martin, was dispatched to visit de Gaulle in Paris to mend the two countries&#x27; relationship. The &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; speculated in 2012—45 years after the speech—that de Gaulle was still annoyed over a perceived slight from World War II-era Canadian Prime Minister Mackenzie King&#x27;s slow recognition of the new French government in late summer 1944.

In the spring of 1966, as part of the Expo 67 diplomatic protocols, de Gaulle and all world leaders whose countries had an exhibit at the fair were invited to visit Canada during the spring and summer of 1967. A few months later, de Gaulle was also sent a separate invitation to visit Quebec by Quebec premier Daniel Johnson. De Gaulle, as a visiting head of state, should have arrived in the Canadian capital of Ottawa, as would be conventional protocol. Instead, he took the time to sail to French islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon with French navy&#x27;s Mediterranean flagship, the cruiser &quot;Colbert&quot;, so that he could arrive in Quebec City, the capital city of the province of Quebec. There, de Gaulle was cheered enthusiastically, while the new governor general, Roland Michener, was booed by the same crowd when viceregal salute was played at his arrival. In his speech, de Gaulle spoke of his country&#x27;s &quot;evolving&quot; ties with Quebec, hinting at his support for Quebec sovereignty.

==Speech==

On July 15, before boarding the &quot;Colbert&quot;, de Gaulle told Xavier Deniau: &quot;They will hear me over there, it will make waves!&quot; He also confided to his son-in-law General Alain de Boissieu that: &quot;I am going to strike a strong blow. Things are going to get hot. But it is necessary. It is the last chance to rectify the cowardice of France.&quot;

On July 24, de Gaulle arrived in Montreal and was driven up the &quot;Chemin du Roy&quot; to Montreal City Hall, where Mayor Jean Drapeau and Premier Johnson waited. De Gaulle was not scheduled to speak that evening, but the crowd chanted for him; he told Drapeau: &quot;I have to speak to those people who are calling for me&quot;. According to a number of personal interviews with high-ranking French officials, as well as documents he uncovered, scholar Dale C. Thomson wrote that de Gaulle&#x27;s statement was planned, and that he used it when the opportunity presented itself.

De Gaulle stepped out onto the balcony to give a short address to the assembled masses which was also broadcast live on radio. In his speech he commented that his drive down the banks of the Saint Lawrence River, lined as it had been with cheering crowds, reminded him of his triumphant return to Paris after the liberation from Nazi Germany. The speech appeared to conclude with the words (&quot;Long live Montreal! Long live Quebec!&quot;), but he then added, (&quot;Long live free Quebec! Long live, long live, long live French Canada! And long live France!&quot;), whereupon the crowd roared with approval, especially after hearing, .

==Reaction==

This statement, coming from the French head of state, was considered a serious breach of diplomatic protocol. It emboldened the Quebec sovereignty movement, and produced tensions between the leadership of the two countries. The crowd&#x27;s reaction to de Gaulle&#x27;s phrase was emotional and it sparked controversy with many English Canadians afterwards, as they were outraged at the implied threat to Canada&#x27;s territorial integrity. Canadian Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson rebuked de Gaulle with an official statement, delivered to the French Embassy on July 25, and read on national television that evening. He said &quot;The people of Canada are free. Every province in Canada is free. Canadians do not need to be liberated. Indeed, many thousands of Canadians gave their lives in two world wars in the liberation of France and other European countries.&quot;

A media and diplomatic uproar ensued thereafter, which resulted in de Gaulle cutting short his visit to Canada. The day after the speech, de Gaulle visited Expo 67 and hosted a banquet at the French pavilion. On July 26, instead of continuing his visit on to Ottawa, where he was scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Pearson, he decided to return to France on a French military jet.

The newly appointed Canadian Minister of Justice, Pierre Trudeau, publicly wondered what the French reaction would have been if a Canadian Prime Minister shouted, &quot;Brittany to the Bretons&quot;. From then on, de Gaulle remained unimpressed by Trudeau, saying (&quot;We have not one concession, nor even any courtesy, to extend to Mr. Trudeau, who is the adversary of the French cause in Canada.&quot;) De Gaulle was also heavily criticized by a large part of the French media for his breach of international protocol, in particular by &quot;Le Monde&quot;.

Meanwhile, to members of the Quebec sovereignty movement, the speech was viewed as a watershed moment. Occurring soon after the Quiet Revolution, and taking into account the low economic and political state of French Canadians at the time, the support of a foreign head of state seemed to add credibility to the movement in the eyes of many, including future Quebec premier René Lévesque.

On the flight home from Montreal, de Gaulle told René de Saint-Légier de la Saussaye—his diplomatic counsellor—that the event was &quot;a historical phenomenon that was perhaps foreseeable but it took a form that only the situation itself could determine. Of course, like many others I could have got away with a few polite remarks or diplomatic acrobatics, but when one is General De Gaulle, one does not have recourse to such expedients. What I did, I had to do it.&quot;

In 1969, de Gaulle visited Brittany, during which, in Quimper, he declaimed a poem written by his uncle (also called Charles de Gaulle) in the Breton language, expressing devotion to Breton culture. The speech, well received by the crowd, followed a series of crackdowns on Breton nationalism. He was accused of double standards for, on the one hand demanding a free Quebec, while on the other oppressing the movement in Brittany. During this Quimper speech, he replied to this criticism that Brittany was free and had been freed by Bretons and other French forces during the Liberation, reminding them that the Resistance was more intense in Brittany than in any other part of France, and that many Bretons had joined the Free French Forces.

<text>155 (one hundred [and] fifty-five) is the natural number following 154 and preceding 156.

== In mathematics ==
155 is:
*a composite number
*a semiprime.
*a deficient number, since 1+5+31=37&lt;155.
*odious, since its binary expansion formula_1 has a total of 5 ones in it.

There are 155 primitive permutation groups of degree 81. 

If one adds up all the primes from the least through the greatest prime factors of 155, that is, 5 and 31, the result is 155. Only three other &quot;small&quot; semiprimes (10, 39, and 371) share this attribute.

<doc id="856635" wikidata="Q4765134" url="?curid=856635" title="AnimeSuki">
<text>AnimeSuki (from Japanese &quot;anime&quot; and ) is a website and once considered &quot;... the largest database of BitTorrent anime shows&quot; that focused on providing unlicensed anime fansubs using the BitTorrent peer-to-peer system. The website was created by GHDpro on December 26, 2002. Animesuki was not a tracker; instead, it provided links to many trackers across the web. It did not list pornography or series that had been licensed in North America. However, in 2013 it stopped maintaining its database of torrents, and the forums remain as the only active part of the site.

==Legal status==
The site only linked to anime that had not been licensed by any American companies. Once a title was licensed, the corresponding fansub links were removed from the site and the series was listed on its licensed list. Nonetheless, although none of the files were hosted on the site itself, AnimeSuki could be held accountable for violating copyright law, as linking to sites that themselves infringe on the law has been considered a form of contributory infringement in the United States (Intellectual Reserve v. Utah Lighthouse Ministry).

Though fansubs are technically copyright violations, AnimeSuki&#x27;s legal page alleges that the WTO TRIPS Agreement specifies that the distribution of copyrighted material is only necessarily illegal when done on a commercial scale, thus making it difficult for anyone besides the copyright holder to prosecute fansubbers. To date, only one Japanese company, Media Factory, has requested its content removed from the site. However, Funimation and Kadokawa Pictures USA have also sent them separate cease and desist letters concerning several titles, which were promptly removed. In Singapore, Odex has targeted AnimeSuki&#x27;s users with legal action.

AnimeSuki was also known for erring on the side of caution regarding licenses. Even though some series such as &quot;Hanaukyo Maids&quot; were not initially licensed, AnimeSuki kept them from being listed because of the likelihood that Geneon would secure the rights to it.

==Present==
Over time, AnimeSuki experienced a decline in new fansub entries, due to various changes in online anime distribution, such as preference to download episodes directly from translators&#x27; websites, competition with other database websites, frequent updates, and disbandment of translation groups. Fan translations have further declined, as more anime became licensed and professionally translated for official release worldwide. And since the growing popularity of video streaming websites such as Crunchyroll, HIDIVE, Amazon Prime Video and Netflix, which provide licensed anime and can stream to smartphones, AnimeSuki has ceased all updates and activity.

As of February 15, 2019, the main website is closed. However, as of 2025, the discussion boards remain active.

<doc id="856656" wikidata="Q7994880" url="?curid=856656" title="White House Farm murders">
<text>The White House Farm murders took place near the village of Tolleshunt D&#x27;Arcy, Essex, England, during the night of 6–7 August 1985. Nevill and June Bamber were shot and killed inside their farmhouse at White House Farm along with their adopted daughter, Sheila Caffell, and Sheila&#x27;s six-year-old twin sons, Daniel and Nicholas Caffell. The only surviving member of the immediate family was the adopted son, Jeremy Bamber, then aged 24, who said he had been at home a few miles away when the shooting took place.

Police initially believed that Sheila, who had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, had fired the shots before turning the gun on herself, but weeks after the murders, Jeremy&#x27;s ex-girlfriend told police that he had implicated himself. The prosecution argued that, motivated by a large inheritance, Jeremy had shot the family with his father&#x27;s semi-automatic rifle, then placed the gun in Sheila&#x27;s hands to make the deaths look like a murder–suicide. A silencer, the prosecution said, was on the rifle and would have made it too long, they argued, for Sheila&#x27;s fingers to reach the trigger to shoot herself. Jeremy was convicted of five counts of murder in October 1986 by a 10–2 majority verdict, sentenced to a minimum of twenty-five years, and informed in 1994 that he would never be released. The Court of Appeal upheld the verdict in 2002.

Jeremy protested his innocence throughout, although his extended family remained convinced of his guilt. Between 2004 and 2012, his lawyers submitted several unsuccessful applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, arguing that the silencer might not have been used during the killings, that the crime scene might have been damaged then reconstructed, that crime scene photographs were taken weeks after the murders and that the time of Sheila&#x27;s death had been miscalculated.

A key issue was whether Jeremy had received a call from his father on the night of the murder to tell him Sheila had &quot;gone berserk&quot; with a gun. Jeremy said that he did, that he alerted police and that Sheila fired the final shot while he and the officers were standing outside the house. It became a central plank of the prosecution&#x27;s case that the father had made no such call and that the only reason Jeremy would have lied about it — indeed, the only way he could have known about the shootings when he alerted the police — was that he was the killer himself.

==Bamber family==
===June and Nevill Bamber===

Ralph Nevill Bamber (known as &#x27;Nevill&#x27;, born 8 June 1924) was a farmer, former Royal Air Force (RAF) pilot and magistrate at the local Witham magistrates&#x27; court. He and his wife, June (née Speakman, born 3 June 1924), had married in 1949 and moved into the Georgian White House Farm on Pages Lane, Tolleshunt D&#x27;Arcy, Essex, set among of tenant farmland that had belonged to June&#x27;s father. The Court of Appeal described Nevill as &quot;a well-built man, tall and in good physical health.&quot; This became significant because Jeremy&#x27;s defence later suggested that Sheila, a slim woman aged 28, had been able to beat and subdue her father, something the prosecution contested.

Unable to have biological children, the Bambers adopted Sheila and Jeremy as infants; the children were not related to each other. June suffered from depression and had been admitted to a psychiatric hospital in the 1950s, including in 1958 after Sheila&#x27;s adoption, where she was given electroshock therapy at least six times. In 1982 she was treated by Hugh Ferguson, a psychiatrist who later saw Sheila.

The Bambers were financially secure, owning property that included the farmhouse, a flat in London, 300 acres of land and a caravan site. The couple gave the children a good home and private education, but June was intensely religious and tried to force her children and grandchildren to adopt the same ideas. She had a poor relationship with Sheila, who felt June disapproved of her, and June&#x27;s relationship with Jeremy was so troubled that he had apparently stopped speaking to her. Sheila&#x27;s ex-husband was concerned about the effect June was having on his sons; she made them kneel and pray with her, which upset him and the boys.

===Daniel and Nicholas Caffell===
Daniel and Nicholas Caffell (born 22 June 1979) were born to Sheila and Colin Caffell, who married in 1977 and divorced in 1982. Colin was an art student when he met Sheila. Both parents were involved in the children&#x27;s upbringing after the divorce, although the boys were briefly placed in foster care in 198283 because of Sheila&#x27;s health problems. For several months before the murders they had been living with Colin in his home in Kilburn, North London, not far from Sheila&#x27;s residence in Maida Vale.

A week-long visit to White House Farm had been arranged for August 1985 at the Bambers&#x27; request; the plan was that the boys would visit their grandparents with Sheila before going on holiday to Norway with their father. Daniel and Nicholas were reluctant to stay at the farm. They disliked that June made them pray, and in the car on the way asked Colin to speak to her about it. In addition Daniel had become a vegetarian and was worried about being forced to eat meat. When their father dropped them off at the house on 4 August, it was the last time he saw them. The boys are buried together in Highgate Cemetery. Sheila was cremated, and the urn with her ashes was placed in their coffin.

===Sheila Caffell===
====Background====

Sheila Jean &quot;Bambi&quot; Caffell (born 18 July 1957) was born to the 18-year-old daughter of Eric Jay, a senior chaplain to the Archbishop of Canterbury. At his insistence, the baby was placed for adoption. Her mother gave Sheila up to the Church of England Children&#x27;s Society two weeks after the birth, and the Bambers adopted her in October 1957. The chaplain had known Nevill in the RAF and selected the Bambers from a list of prospective adopters.

After school Sheila attended secretarial college in Swiss Cottage, London. In 1974, when she was aged 17, she discovered she was pregnant by Colin Caffell. The Bambers arranged an abortion. Her relationship with her mother deteriorated significantly that summer after June found Sheila and Colin sunbathing naked in a field. June reportedly started calling Sheila the &quot;devil&#x27;s child.&quot;

Sheila continued with her secretarial course, then trained as a hairdresser, and briefly worked as a model with the Lucie Clayton Charm Academy, including two months&#x27; work in Tokyo. After she became pregnant again, she married Colin at Chelmsford Register Office in May 1977, but miscarried in the sixth month. The Bambers bought the couple a garden flat in Carlingford Road, Hampstead, to help Sheila recuperate. Sheila suffered another miscarriage, then on 22 June 1979, after four months of bed rest in hospital, she gave birth to Daniel and Nicholas. Colin, apparently having begun an affair just before the birth, left Sheila for five months. Sheila became increasingly upset; on one occasion, when Colin left her 21st birthday party with another woman, she required hospital treatment after breaking a window with her fist. The couple divorced in May 1982.

After the divorce, Nevill bought Sheila a flat in Morshead Mansions, Maida Vale, and Colin helped raise the children from his home in nearby Kilburn. Sheila decided to trace her birth mother, then living in Canada. They met at Heathrow Airport in 1982 for a brief reunion, but a relationship did not develop. At around this time Sheila became friendly with a group of young women who nicknamed her &quot;Bambi&quot;, and who later told reporters that she often complained about her poor relationship with her adoptive mother. The group partook in drugs, particularly cocaine, and fraternisations with older men. As her brief modelling career had ended after the birth of the boys, Sheila lived on welfare and took low-paying jobs, including as a waitress for one week at School Dinners, a London restaurant in which dinner was served by young women in school uniform, stockings and suspenders. There were also cleaning jobs and one episode of nude photography that she later regretted.

====Health====
Sheila&#x27;s mental health continued to decline, with episodes of banging her head against walls. In 1983 her family doctor referred her to Hugh Ferguson, the psychiatrist who had treated June. Ferguson said Sheila was in an agitated state, paranoid and psychotic. She was admitted to St Andrew&#x27;s Hospital, a private psychiatric facility, where Ferguson diagnosed a schizoaffective disorder. After Sheila was discharged in September 1983, he continued seeing her as an out-patient and concluded that his first diagnosis had been mistaken. Ferguson now believed that she had schizophrenia and began treating her with trifluoperazine, an antipsychotic drug.

Ferguson wrote that Sheila believed the devil had given her the power to project evil onto others, and that she could make her sons have sex and cause violence with her. She called them the &quot;devil&#x27;s children&quot;, the phrase June had used of Sheila, and said she believed she was capable of murdering them or of getting them to kill others. She spoke about suicide, although the court heard that Ferguson did not regard her as a suicide risk.

Sheila was readmitted to St Andrew&#x27;s in March 1985, five months before the murders, after a psychotic episode in which she believed herself to be in direct communication with God and that certain people, including her boyfriend, were trying to hurt or kill her. She was discharged four weeks later, and as an out-patient received a monthly injection of haloperidol, an antipsychotic drug that has a sedative effect. From that point, the twins lived all or most of the time with Colin in Kilburn. According to Jeremy, the family discussed placing the boys in daytime foster care over dinner on the night of the murders, with little response from Sheila.

Despite Sheila&#x27;s erratic mental state, Ferguson told the court that the kind of violence necessary to commit the murders was not consistent with his view of her. In particular, he said he did not believe she would have killed her father or children, because her difficult relationship was confined to her mother. Colin said the same: that, despite her tendency to throw things and sometimes hit him, she had never harmed the children. June&#x27;s sister, Pamela Boutflour, testified that Sheila was not a violent person and that she had never known her to use a gun; June&#x27;s niece, Ann Eaton, told the court that Sheila did not know how to use one. Jeremy disputed this, telling police on the night of the shooting, as they stood outside the house, that he and Sheila had gone target shooting together. He acknowledged later that he had not seen her fire a gun as an adult.

===Jeremy Bamber===

Jeremy Nevill Bamber was born on 13 January 1961 to a student midwife who, after an affair with a married British Army sergeant, gave her baby to the Church of England Children&#x27;s Society when he was six weeks old. His biological parents later married and had other children; his father became a senior staff member in Buckingham Palace. The Bambers adopted Jeremy when he was six months old. They sent him to St Nicholas Primary, then along with Sheila to Maldon Court prep school. This was followed when he was aged 9, in September 1970, by Gresham&#x27;s School, a boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, where he joined the cadet force. Jeremy was apparently unhappy at Gresham&#x27;s because of bullying and other factors.

After leaving Gresham&#x27;s with no qualifications, Jeremy attended sixth form college, and in 1978 achieved seven O-levels. Nevill paid for him to visit Australia, where he took a scuba-diving course, before travelling to New Zealand. Former friends alleged that Jeremy had broken into a jeweller&#x27;s shop while in New Zealand and had stolen an expensive watch. He had also boasted, they said, of being involved in smuggling heroin. Jeremy returned to England in 1982 to work on his adoptive parents&#x27; farm for £170 a week, and set up home in a cottage Nevill owned at 9 Head Street, Goldhanger. The cottage lay 3–3.5 miles (5.6 km) from White House Farm, a five-minute drive by car and at least fifteen minutes by bicycle. Nevill also gave Jeremy a car to use, and eight percent of a family company, Osea Road Camp Sites Ltd, which ran the Bambers&#x27; caravan site.

To his supporters, who over the years have included Members of Parliament and journalists, Jeremy is a victim of one of Britain&#x27;s worst miscarriages of justice. &quot;The Guardian&quot; took up his case in the early 1990s; one or more &quot;Guardian&quot; journalists began corresponding with him in 2006, and two interviewed him in 2011. Describing Jeremy as &quot;clever and strategic&quot;, they wrote that there was something about him that made the public unsympathetic toward him. He was &quot;handsome in a rather cruel, caddish way—he seemed to exude arrogance and indifference. ... Like Meursault in the Camus novel &quot;L&#x27;Étranger&quot;, he did not seem to display the appropriate emotions.&quot; He is reported to have passed a polygraph test in 2007.

Jeremy&#x27;s detractors include his extended family and his father&#x27;s former secretary, Barbara Wilson. She told reporters that Jeremy used to provoke his parents, riding in circles around his mother on a bicycle, wearing make-up to upset his father and once hiding a bag of live rats in Wilson&#x27;s car. Whenever Jeremy visited the farm there were arguments, she claimed. Tension had apparently increased in the weeks before the murders; Wilson said Nevill had remarked to her about foreseeing a &quot;shooting accident.&quot; Jeremy&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, Julie Mugford, alleged that he had talked about killing his family. A farm worker testified that Jeremy had once said of Sheila: &quot;I&#x27;m not going to share my money with my sister.&quot; The court heard that, in March that year, while discussing security at the family&#x27;s caravan site, he had told his uncle: &quot;I could kill anybody. I could even [or &#x27;easily&#x27;] kill my parents.&quot; Jeremy denied having said this.

===Extended family, inheritance===
The financial ties and inheritance issues within the immediate and extended family provided a motive and added a layer of complexity to the case. The Bambers&#x27; company, N. and J. Bamber Ltd, was worth £400,000 in 1985 (c. £1,061,016 in 2021). In their wills, June left £230,000 (c. £608,000) and Nevill £380,000 (c. £1,004,000). During the trial, the court heard that the Bambers had left their estate to both Jeremy and Sheila, to be divided equally. In addition, Nevill&#x27;s will had said that, to inherit, Jeremy had to be working on the farm at the time of his father&#x27;s death. The court also heard, from Mugford&#x27;s mother, that he had been saying June wanted to change her will to bypass him and Sheila and leave her estate to Sheila&#x27;s twins instead.

The parents&#x27; estate included land and buildings occupied by Jeremy&#x27;s cousins, who were made aware, after the murders, that he intended to sell them. It was one of those cousins who found the silencer in the gun cupboard, with the flecks of blood and paint that proved pivotal to the prosecution. Because of Jeremy&#x27;s conviction, the estate passed instead to the cousins. One moved into White House Farm, while that cousin and several others acquired full ownership of the caravan site and other buildings. This conflict of interest became a bone of contention, as did the apparent failure of the police to search and secure the crime scene. Jeremy argues that the family set him up, a claim that one of the group dismissed in 2010 as &quot;an absolute load of piffle.&quot;

Jeremy has launched two legal actions while in prison, claiming a share of the estate, which the cousins said was part of an attempt to harass and vilify them. In 2003 he began a High Court action to recover £1.2 million from the estate of his maternal grandmother, arguing that he should have inherited her home at Carbonnells Farm, Wix, which went instead to June&#x27;s sister—the grandmother had cut Jeremy out of her will when he was arrested—and that he was owed seventeen years&#x27; rent from his cousins who lived there. In 2004 he went to the High Court again to claim a £326,000 share of the profit from the caravan site. The court ruled against him in both cases.

==Jeremy&#x27;s visit to the farm==
===Atmosphere in the house===
On Sunday, 4 August 1985, three days before the murders, Sheila and the boys arrived at White House Farm to spend the week with Nevill and June. The housekeeper saw Sheila that day and noticed nothing unusual. Two farm workers saw her the following day with her children and said she seemed happy. One of the crime scene photographs showed that someone had carved &quot;I hate this place&quot; into the cupboard doors of the bedroom in which the twins were sleeping.

Jeremy visited the farm on the evening of Tuesday, 6 August. He told the court that during his visit his parents suggested to Sheila that the boys be placed in daytime foster care with a local family; he said Sheila did not seem bothered by the suggestion and had simply said she would rather stay in London. The boys had been in foster care before, although in London rather than near White House Farm, and it had not appeared to cause a problem for Sheila. Ferguson told the Court of Appeal in 2002 that any suggestion that the children be removed from her care would have provoked a strong reaction from Sheila, but that she might have welcomed daytime help.

A farmworker heard Jeremy leave around 9:30 pm. Barbara Wilson, the farm&#x27;s secretary, telephoned Nevill at around that time and was left with the impression that she had interrupted an argument. She said Nevill was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June&#x27;s sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.

===Murder weapon===
Jeremy told the court that, hours before the murders on 6 August, he had loaded the rifle, thinking he heard rabbits outside, but had not used it. He left the rifle on the kitchen table, with a full magazine and a box of ammunition, before leaving the house. It did not at that point have the silencer or telescopic sight attached, he claimed. Both had been on the rifle in late July, according to a nephew, but Jeremy said his father must have removed them. The prosecution disputed this, maintaining that the silencer was on the rifle when the family was murdered.

Nevill kept several guns at the farm. He was reportedly careful with them, cleaning them after use and securing them. He had bought the gun, a .22 Anschütz model 525 semi-automatic rifle, on 30 November 1984, along with a Parker Hale silencer, telescopic sight and 500 rounds of ammunition. It used cartridges, which were loaded into a magazine that held ten rounds. Twenty-five shots were fired during the killing, so if the rifle was fully loaded to begin with, it would have been reloaded at least twice. The court heard that the magazine became harder to load with each cartridge; loading the tenth was described as &quot;exceptionally hard&quot;.

The rifle had normally been used to shoot rabbits with the silencer and telescopic sight attached. The court heard that the sight had to be removed with a screwdriver, but it was usually left in place because it was time-consuming to realign it. Nevill&#x27;s nephew visited the farmhouse on the weekend of 26–28 July 1985 and told the court that he had seen the rifle, in the gun cupboard in the ground-floor office, with the sight and silencer attached. He had taken the gun out and used it for target shooting.

==Police logs, 7 August 1985==
===Telephones in the farmhouse===
There were three telephones at White House Farm on the night of the shooting, all on the same landline. There was usually a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom on Nevill&#x27;s bedside table; a beige Statesman phone in the kitchen; and a blue Sceptre 100 phone in the office on the first floor. (There was a fourth phone too, an Envoy cordless phone in the kitchen, but it had been picked up for repair on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the main bedroom and into the kitchen, where the police found it with its receiver off the hook. They found the Statesman phone still in the kitchen but hidden in a pile of magazines.

===Jeremy&#x27;s call to police===
Jeremy telephoned Chelmsford police station (and not the 999 emergency number) from his home in the early hours of 7 August to raise the alarm. He told them he had received a telephone call from his father—from the landline at White House Farm to the landline at Bamber&#x27;s home—to say that Sheila had &quot;gone berserk&quot; with a gun. Jeremy said the line went dead in the middle of the call.

The prosecution argued that Jeremy had received no such call, and that his claim to have done so was part of his setting the scene to blame Sheila. Nevill was &quot;severely bloodied&quot; at that point, according to the Court of Appeal, but the telephone had &quot;no visible blood&quot; on it when police examined the scene, although it was acknowledged that no swabs had been taken. It was Jeremy, the prosecution said, who had left the kitchen telephone off the hook after calling his home from White House Farm to establish that part of his alibi.

After Jeremy telephoned the police, a British Telecom operator checked the White House Farm line—at 3:56 am according to the police log, and at 4:30am according to the Court of Appeal—and found that the line was open. The operator could hear a dog barking. British Telecom did not at the time keep records of local calls. According to experts who testified at the trial, if Nevill had telephoned Jeremy without replacing the receiver, the line between them would have remained open for one or two minutes. During this time, Jeremy would not have been able to use his telephone.

Explaining why he had called a local police station and not 999, Jeremy told police on the night that he had not thought it would make a difference to how soon they would arrive. He said he had spent time looking up the number, and even though his father had asked him to come quickly, he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London, then had driven slowly to the farmhouse. Jeremy acknowledged that he could have called one of the farm workers but had not considered it. In his early witness statements, Jeremy said he had telephoned the police immediately after receiving his father&#x27;s call, then telephoned Mugford. During later police interviews, he said he had called Mugford first. Jeremy said he was confused about the sequence of events.

===Logs===
====Event log====
In 2010 Jeremy&#x27;s lawyers highlighted two police logs in support of his application to have his case referred back to the Court of Appeal. The question was whether these logs support the prosecution position that there was one call that night to the police, from Jeremy alone, or the defence position that there were two calls, one from Nevill followed by a second from Jeremy.

One log shows that Jeremy rang the local police station and spoke to police constable Michael West in the information room. As a result, West began an &quot;event log&quot;. This states that Jeremy&#x27;s call came in at 3:36 am on 7 August 1985. Jeremy maintains that he telephoned ten minutes after his father phoned him. But at trial it was accepted that West had misread a digital clock and that the call had probably come in just before 3:26 am, because that was when West asked a civilian dispatcher, Malcolm Bonnett, to send a car to the scene. The car, Charlie Alpha 5, was dispatched at 3:35am. The event log noted a call from:

The Court of Appeal noted that Jeremy said he had &quot;tried to ring his father back at White House Farm but he could not get a reply&quot;. During the trial, the court heard that Jeremy said his father had not hung up after speaking and that he could hear noise in the background. At some point PC West spoke to Jeremy again on the telephone; Jeremy apparently complained about the time the police were taking, saying: &quot;When my father rang he sounded terrified.&quot; He was told to go to the farm and wait for the police.

====Radio log====
Michael Bonnett, a civilian dispatcher in Chelmsford police station&#x27;s information room, began a &quot;radio log&quot; which kept track of messages about the situation. The radio log discusses a telephone call made at 3:26 am on 7 August. According to the prosecution, this is the call known to have been made by Jeremy, the same call entered in the event log. According to the defence, the radio log is not simply a duplicate log of Jeremy&#x27;s call but a log of a separate call to the police by Nevill.

The radio log is headed, &quot;Daughter gone berserk&quot;: &quot;Mr Bamber, White House Farm, Tolleshunt d’Arcy—daughter Sheila Bamber, aged 26 years, has got hold of one of my guns.&quot; It adds: &quot;Message passed to CD by the son of Mr Bamber after phone went dead.&quot; It goes on to say: &quot;Mr Bamber has a collection of shotguns and .410s&quot;, and it includes White House Farm&#x27;s telephone number. The final entry says: &quot;0356 GPO [the telephone operator] have checked phone line to farmhouse and confirm phone left off hook.&quot; The radio log shows that a patrol car, Charlie Alpha 7 (CA7)—not Charlie Alpha 5, as mentioned in the event log—was sent to the scene at 3:35 am.

==Scene at White House Farm==
===Events outside===

After the telephone calls, Jeremy drove to the farmhouse, as did three officers from Witham police station who later testified that he had been driving much more slowly than them; they passed him on Pages Lane and arrived at the farmhouse one or two minutes before him. Jeremy&#x27;s cousin, Ann Eaton, testified that he was normally a fast driver. The group waited outside the house for a tactical firearms unit to arrive, which turned up at 5 am and decided to wait until daylight before trying to enter. Police determined that all the doors and windows to the house were shut except for the window in the main bedroom on the first floor. Using a loudhailer, they spent two hours trying to communicate with Sheila. The only sound they reported from the house was a dog barking.

While waiting outside, the police questioned Jeremy, who they said seemed calm. According to the Court of Appeal, Jeremy told them about the phone call from his father and that it had sounded as though someone had cut off the call. He also said he did not get along with his sister. When asked whether she might have &quot;gone berserk with a gun&quot;, the police said he replied: &quot;I don&#x27;t really know. She is a nutter. She&#x27;s been having treatment.&quot; When asked why Nevill would have called Jeremy and not the police, he replied that his father was the sort of person who might want to keep things within the family. Jeremy claimed to have called Chelmsford police station, rather than 999, because he did not think it would affect the police&#x27;s response time. Over the next few hours he talked about cars in general with one of the officers, saying that the Osea Road caravan site &quot;would be able to stand him a Porsche&quot; soon.

Jeremy told the police that Sheila was familiar with guns and that they had gone target shooting together. He said he had been at the farmhouse himself a few hours earlier, and that he had loaded the rifle because he thought he had heard rabbits outside. Jeremy had left the rifle on the kitchen table fully loaded, with a box of ammunition nearby. A doctor who was called to the house testified the deaths could have occurred at any time during the night. He said Jeremy appeared to be in a state of shock: he broke down, cried and seemed to vomit. The doctor said Jeremy told him about the discussion the family had had about possibly placing Sheila&#x27;s sons in foster care.

===Scene inside===
====Apparent struggle====
The police entered the farmhouse at 7:54 am, using a sledgehammer to break the back door. The door had been locked from the inside, with the key still in the lock. They found five bodies with multiple gunshot wounds, Nevill downstairs in the kitchen and the rest upstairs. Twenty-five shots had been fired, mostly at close range. In what order the family was killed is not known. A telephone was lying on one of the kitchen surfaces with its receiver off the hook, next to empty .22 cartridge cases. The police said chairs and stools were overturned, and there was broken crockery, a broken sugar basin, a broken ceiling light, and what looked like blood on the floor.

====Nevill====

Nevill was found in the kitchen, dressed in pyjamas, lying over an overturned chair next to the fireplace, amid a scene suggestive of a struggle. He had been shot eight times, six times to the head and face, fired when the rifle was a few inches from his skin. The remaining shots to his body had occurred from at least two feet away. Based on where the empty cartridge cases were found—three in the kitchen and one on the stairs—the police concluded that he had been shot four times upstairs, but had managed to get downstairs where a struggle took place, and during which he was hit several times with the rifle and shot again, this time fatally.

There were two wounds to Nevill&#x27;s right side, and two to the top of his head which would probably have resulted in unconsciousness. The left side of his lip was wounded, his jaw was fractured, and his teeth, neck and larynx were damaged. The pathologist said he &quot;would not have been able to engage in purposeful talk&quot;, according to the Court of Appeal. There were gunshot wounds to his left shoulder and left elbow. The court heard that he had &quot;black eyes and a broken nose, linear bruising to the cheeks, lacerations to the head, linear type bruising to the right forearm, bruising to the left wrist and forearm and three circular burn type marks to the back. The linear marks were consistent with Mr Bamber having been struck with a long blunt object, possibly a gun.&quot; One of the pillars of the prosecution case was that Sheila would not have been strong enough to inflict this beating on Nevill, who was 6 ft 4 in (1.93 m) tall and by all accounts in good health.

====June====
June&#x27;s body and clothing were heavily bloodstained; she was found in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found lying on the floor by the door of the master bedroom. June had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under away. That and another shot to the right side of her head would both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck and to her right forearm, and two injuries on the right side of her chest and right knee.

====Daniel and Nicholas====
The boys were found in their beds in their own room (formerly Sheila&#x27;s room). They appeared to have been shot while in bed. The court heard that Daniel had been shot five times in the back of the head, four times with the gun held within of his head, and once from over away. Nicholas had been shot three times, all contact or close-proximity shots.

====Sheila====
Sheila was found on the floor of the master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, her feet were bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the injuries had occurred from three inches (76 mm) away and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. The pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries, Vanezis said.

Blood and urine samples indicated that Sheila had taken haloperidol and, several days earlier, had used cannabis. There were no marks on her body suggestive of a struggle. The firearms officer who first saw her said her feet and hands were clean, her fingernails manicured and not broken, and her fingertips free of blood, dirt or powder. There was no trace of lead dust. The rifle magazine would have been loaded at least twice during the killings; this would usually leave lubricant and material from the bullets on the hands. A scenes-of-crimes officer, Detective Constable Hammersley, said there were bloodstains on the back of her right hand but that otherwise her hands were clean.

There was no blood on Sheila&#x27;s feet or other debris, such as the sugar that was on the downstairs floor. Low traces of lead were found on her hands and forehead at post-mortem, but the levels were consistent with the everyday handling of things around the house. A forensic scientist, Brian Elliott, testified that if Sheila had loaded eighteen cartridges into a magazine he would expect to see more lead on her hands. The blood on her nightdress was consistent with her own, and no trace of firearm-discharge residue was on it. Given that Sheila was wearing just a nightdress, it was hard to see how she could have carried the cartridges. The rifle, without the silencer or sights attached, was lying on her body pointing up at her neck. June&#x27;s Bible lay on the floor to the right of Sheila. It was normally kept in a bedside cupboard. June&#x27;s fingerprints were on it, as were others that could not be identified, including one made by a child.

==Police investigation==
===Murder-suicide theory, crime scene===
The police and media were initially convinced by the murder-suicide theory. Detective Chief Inspector Thomas Jones, deputy head of CID, was so sure Sheila had killed her family that he ordered Jeremy&#x27;s cousins out of his office when they asked him to consider whether Jeremy had set the whole thing up. The &quot;Daily Express&quot; reported on 8 August 1985, the day after the murders:

A farming family affectionately dubbed &quot;The Archers&quot; was slaughtered in a bloodbath yesterday. Brandishing a gun taken from her father&#x27;s collection, deranged divorcee Sheila Bamber, 28, first shot her twin six-year-old sons. She gunned down her father as he tried to phone for help. Then she murdered her mother before turning the automatic .22 rifle on herself.

The result of this certainty was that the investigation was poorly conducted. The murder scene was not secured or searched thoroughly, and evidence was not recorded or preserved. Within a couple of days, the police had burned the bloodstained bedding and carpets, apparently to spare Jeremy&#x27;s feelings. The scenes-of-crime officer moved the murder weapon without wearing gloves, and it was not examined for fingerprints until weeks later. Three days after the killings, Bamber and the extended family were given back the keys to the house.

Police did not find the silencer in the cupboard. One of Jeremy&#x27;s cousins found it on 10 August, with what appeared to be flecks of red paint and blood, and took it to another of the cousin&#x27;s homes; it took the police a further three days to collect it. A few days after that, the cousins found a scratch on the red mantelpiece that the prosecution said was caused by the silencer during a struggle for the gun; that accounted for the fleck of red paint. The Bible found near Sheila was not examined at all. Journalist David Connett writes that a hacksaw blade that might have been used to gain entry to the house lay in the garden for months. Officers did not take contemporaneous notes; those who had dealt with Jeremy wrote down their statements weeks later. The bodies were released days after the murders, and three of them (Nevill, June and Sheila) were cremated. Jeremy&#x27;s clothes were not examined until one month later. Ten years later, all blood samples were destroyed.

After Jeremy was convicted, the trial judge, Mr Justice Maurice Drake, expressed concern about the &quot;less than thorough investigation&quot;, while &quot;The Times&quot; wrote about &quot;blunders, omissions and ineptitude&quot;. Home Secretary Douglas Hurd requested a report on the investigation from Essex Chief Constable Robert Bunyard and in March 1989 issued a statement in the House of Commons: &quot;It is clear that errors were made in the early stages of the police investigation contrary to existing force practice.&quot;

===Funeral, Bamber&#x27;s behaviour===

The inquest into the murders was opened on 14 August 1985. The police gave evidence that the killings constituted a murder–suicide, and the bodies were released. Nevill, June and Sheila were cremated; the boys were buried. Jeremy&#x27;s behaviour before and after the funeral increased suspicion among his family that he had been involved; they alleged that he sobbed during the funeral service for his parents and sister, and at one point seemed to buckle and had to be supported by Mugford, but that he was smiling and joking later at the wake.

Shortly after the funerals, Jeremy travelled to Amsterdam with Mugford and a friend, where he bought a large quantity of cannabis; the travel agent who sold the tickets said the group had been in high spirits. Jeremy also began selling his family&#x27;s belongings; Mugford&#x27;s mother was offered June&#x27;s car and an ad was placed in a local newspaper asking £900 for Nevill&#x27;s. Just after his first arrest and release in September, Jeremy tried to sell twenty nude photographs of Sheila for £20,000 to &quot;The Sun&quot; and went on another overseas trip with a friend, this time to Saint-Tropez.

===Fingerprints on rifle===
A print from Sheila&#x27;s right ring finger was found on the right side of the butt of the rifle, pointing downwards. A print from Jeremy&#x27;s right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across the gun. He said he had used the gun to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints that could not be identified.

===Silencer===

The silencer was not on the gun when the bodies were discovered. It was found by one of Jeremy&#x27;s cousins, three days after the murders, in the ground-floor office gun cupboard. Whether it was on the gun during the murders became a pivotal issue. The prosecution maintained that the silencer had indeed been on the gun, and that this meant Sheila could not have shot herself. Forensic tests indicated that her arms were not long enough to turn the gun on herself with the silencer attached. If she had shot the others with the silencer, then realized the gun was too long for her to shoot herself, the silencer would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard before going back upstairs to shoot herself. If Sheila was not the killer, it meant Jeremy had lied about the telephone call from his father saying Sheila had &quot;gone berserk&quot; with the gun.

The police searched the gun cupboard on the day of the murders but found nothing. Three days later, on 10 August, Bamber&#x27;s extended family visited the farm with Basil Cock, the estate&#x27;s executor. During that visit, one of the cousins, David Boutflour, found the silencer and rifle sights in the gun cupboard. The court heard that this was witnessed by Boutflour&#x27;s father and sister, as well as by Basil Cock and the farm secretary.

Instead of alerting the police, the family took the silencer to Boutflour&#x27;s sister&#x27;s home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and blood on the silencer, and its surface had been damaged. When the police collected the silencer on 12 August, five days after the murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had disappeared by the time the silencer arrived at the Forensic Science Service (FSS) at Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire. A scientist at the FSS, John Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila&#x27;s, although it could have been a mixture of Nevill&#x27;s and June&#x27;s. A firearms expert, Malcolm Fletcher, said the blood was backspatter caused by a close-contact shooting.

===Scratch marks on mantelpiece===

Jeremy&#x27;s cousins returned to the farmhouse to search for the source of the red paint on the silencer. In the kitchen they found marks in the red paint on the underside of the mantelpiece above an AGA cooker. A sample taken by a scenes-of-crime officer was found to contain the same fifteen layers of paint and varnish that were in the paint flake found on the silencer. Casts of the marks on the mantelpiece were deemed consistent with the silencer having come into contact with the mantel several times.

===Julie Mugford&#x27;s statements===
====Background====
On 7 September 1985, a month after the murders, Mugford changed her statement to police, now alleging that Jeremy had been planning to kill his family. As a result of her second statement, he was arrested the following day.

Jeremy and Mugford had started dating in 1983, when she was aged 19 and studying for a degree in education at Goldsmiths College in London. She had taken a holiday job in Sloppy Joe&#x27;s, a pizzeria in Colchester, where Jeremy had a bar job in the evenings. During police interviews, Mugford admitted to a brief background of dishonesty: in 1985 she had been cautioned for using a friend&#x27;s chequebook after it had been reported stolen to obtain goods worth around £700; she said that she and the friend had repaid the money to the bank. Mugford also acknowledged having helped Jeremy, in March 1985, to steal just under £1,000 from the office of the Osea Road caravan site his family owned. She said that he had staged a break-in to make it appear that strangers were responsible.

====Statements to police====
Mugford was initially supportive of Jeremy. Photographs of his parents&#x27; and Sheila&#x27;s funeral show him weeping and hanging onto her arm. During an interview with the police on the day after the murders, she said that Jeremy had telephoned her at home in the early hours of 7 August, between 3:00 and 3:30 am, and said, &quot;There&#x27;s something wrong at home,&quot; and sounded worried. She said she had been tired and had not asked what was wrong.

Mugford&#x27;s position changed the following month after she&#x27;d had a series of rows with Jeremy. He seemed to want to end the relationship, and they had argued about his involvement in the murders. Mugford told Jeremy he was a psychopath and at one point tried to smother him with a pillow. During one argument on 4 September, another woman telephoned Jeremy in Mugford&#x27;s presence. As it became clear to Mugford that he had been seeing the woman, she smashed a mirror and slapped him; he then twisted her arm up her back. Three days later, she went to the police and changed her statement.

In the second statement, Mugford alleged that between July and October 1984, Jeremy had said he wished he could &quot;get rid of them all&quot;. He had talked disparagingly about his &quot;old&quot; father and &quot;mad&quot; mother, she claimed, who were trying to &quot;run his life&quot;. Jeremy was also alleged to have said that his sister had nothing to live for and that the twins were disturbed. That the Bambers were paying for Sheila&#x27;s expensive flat in Maida Vale annoyed him, she said.

In discussions she said she had dismissed as &quot;idle talk&quot;, Jeremy had talked about sedating his parents with sleeping pills, shooting them, then setting fire to the farmhouse. He reportedly said Sheila would make a good scapegoat. Mugford alleged he had discussed cycling along the back roads to the house, entering through the kitchen window because the catch was broken, and leaving it via a different window that latched when it was shut from the outside. A telephone call would be made from White House Farm to his home in Goldhanger &quot;because the last phone call made would be recorded&quot;. Jeremy claimed to have killed rats with his bare hands to test whether he was able to kill but he said it had taught him that he would not be able to kill his family, although he allegedly continued to talk about doing so.

====&quot;Tonight or never&quot; allegation====
Mugford said she had spent the weekend before the murders with Jeremy in his cottage in Goldhanger, where he had dyed his hair black. She had seen his mother&#x27;s bicycle there, she said; the prosecution later alleged that he had used this bicycle to cycle between his cottage and White House Farm on the night of the murders to avoid being seen in his car on the road. Mugford told police that Jeremy had telephoned her at 9:50 pm on 6 August to say he had been thinking about the crime all day, was &quot;pissed off&quot;, and that it was &quot;tonight or never&quot;. A few hours later, at 3:00–3:30 am on 7 August, Mugford said he phoned her again to say: &quot;Everything is going well. Something is wrong at the farm. I haven&#x27;t had any sleep all night ... bye honey and I love you lots.&quot; Her flatmates&#x27; evidence suggested that call had come through closer to 3:00 am. Jeremy called later in the morning to tell Mugford that Sheila had gone mad and that a police car was coming to pick her up. When she arrived with the police at Jeremy&#x27;s cottage, she said he had pulled her to one side and said: &quot;I should have been an actor.&quot;

Later on the evening of 7 August, Mugford asked Jeremy whether he had done it. He said no, but that a friend of his had, whom he named; the man was a plumber the family had used in the past. Jeremy allegedly said he had told this friend how he could enter and leave the farmhouse undetected, and that one of his instructions had been for the friend to telephone him from one of the phones in the farmhouse that had a memory redial facility, so that if the police checked it he would have an alibi. Everything had gone as planned, he said, except that Nevill had put up a fight, and the friend had become angry and shot him seven times. The friend had allegedly told Sheila to lie down and shoot herself last, Jeremy said. The friend then placed the Bible on her chest so she appeared to have killed herself in a religious frenzy. The children were shot in their sleep, he said. Mugford said Jeremy claimed to have paid the friend £2,000.

====Letter about Mugford====
A letter dated 26 September 1985 from the assistant director of public prosecutions who prepared the case against Jeremy suggests that Mugford not be prosecuted for the burglary, the cheque fraud, and a further offence of selling cannabis. Mugford subsequently testified against Jeremy during his trial in October 1986. The judge told the jury that they could convict Jeremy on Mugford&#x27;s testimony alone. Immediately after the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the &quot;News of the World&quot; for £25,000 ().

===Bamber&#x27;s arrest===
As a result of Mugford&#x27;s statement, Jeremy was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released. Jeremy told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he claimed the only reason he had broken into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. He further claimed he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs window and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also claimed he had seen his parents&#x27; wills, and that they had left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila. As for the rifle, Jeremy told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case.

Charged on 9 September with breaking into the Osea Bay caravan site on 25 March 1985 and stealing £980, Jeremy was released on bail on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez with a friend. Shortly before this, he tried to sell his life story and nude photographs of Sheila to &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper for £20,000. Before leaving England, Jeremy said that he returned to the farmhouse, gaining entry by the downstairs bathroom window. He claimed he did this because he had left his keys in London and needed papers from the house for the trip to France; he entered through the window rather than borrow keys from the farm&#x27;s housekeeper who lived nearby. When he returned to England on 29 September, Jeremy was arrested at Dover and charged with the murders.

==Trial, October 1986==
===Prosecution case===

Jeremy&#x27;s trial, which lasted eighteen days, opened on 3 October 1986 before Mr Justice Drake and a jury of seven men and five women at Chelmsford Crown Court. The prosecution was led by Anthony Arlidge QC, and the defence by Geoffrey Rivlin QC, supported by Ed Lawson QC. &quot;The Times&quot; wrote that Jeremy cut an arrogant figure in the witness box. At one point, when prosecutors accused him of lying, he replied: &quot;That is what you have got to establish.&quot;

The prosecution case was that Jeremy, motivated by hatred and greed, had left White House Farm around 10 pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, to drive to his home in Goldhanger. Later, perhaps in the early hours of the morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother&#x27;s bicycle — which he had borrowed a few days earlier — cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the farmhouse from the back. He had entered the house through a downstairs bathroom window, taken the rifle with the silencer attached, and gone upstairs. He had shot June in her bed; she had managed to walk a few steps before collapsing and dying. He had shot Nevill in the bedroom too, but Nevill was able to get downstairs where he and Jeremy fought in the kitchen before Jeremy shot him four times, twice in his temple and twice in the top of his head. He had shot Sheila in the main bedroom, next to her mother, and had shot the children in their beds as they slept.

Jeremy had then arranged the scene to make it appear that Sheila was the killer, the prosecution argued. He discovered that she could not have reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it to the gun cupboard, then placed a Bible next to her body to introduce a religious theme. After removing the kitchen phone from its hook, he left the house via a kitchen window, perhaps after showering, and banged the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled back to Goldhanger on his mother&#x27;s bicycle. Shortly after 3 am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26 am to say he had just received a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns so that they would be reluctant to enter.

The prosecution further argued that Jeremy had not received a telephone call from his father, that Nevill was too badly injured after the first shots to have spoken to anyone, that there was no blood on the kitchen phone that had been left off the hook, and that Nevill would have called the police before calling Jeremy. They also argued that, had Jeremy really received such a call, he would have dialled 999, alerted the farm workers, then made his way quickly to White House Farm himself.

The silencer played a central role in the prosecution&#x27;s case. It was deemed to have been on the rifle when it was fired because of the blood found inside it. The prosecution said the blood had come from Sheila&#x27;s head when the silencer was pointed at her. Had she discovered that she could not shoot herself with the silencer attached, the court heard, it would have been found next to her body; she had no reason to return it to the gun cupboard. That she had carried out the killings was further discounted because, it was argued, she had not recently expressed suicidal thoughts; the expert evidence was that she would not have harmed her children or father; she had no interest in or knowledge of guns; she lacked the strength to overcome her father; and there was no evidence on her clothes or body that she had moved around the crime scene or been involved in a struggle. In particular, her long fingernails had remained intact.

===Defence case===
The defence maintained that the witnesses who said Jeremy disliked his family were lying or had misinterpreted his words. Mugford had lied about his confession, they said, because he had betrayed her. No one had seen Jeremy cycle to and from the farm. There were no marks on him on the night in question that suggested he had been in a fight. No blood-stained clothing of his was recovered. He had not driven to the farm as quickly as he could have after his father telephoned because he was afraid, they said. There was no probative value in the finding of a hacksaw in the garden, because Jeremy had entered the house via the windows many times, before the killings and since.

The defence argued that Sheila was the killer and that she did know how to handle guns, having been raised on a farm and had attended shoots when she was younger. She had a very serious mental illness, had told a psychiatrist she felt capable of killing her children, and the loaded rifle and cartridges had been left on the kitchen table by Jeremy. There had been a recent family argument about placing her children in foster care. A former boyfriend of Sheila&#x27;s gave a written statement to the court that she had had some kind of breakdown in March 1985, in his presence, when she began beating the wall with her fists because the telephone line had gone dead during a call; she had said the phone was bugged and talked about God and the devil, and how the latter loved her. This former boyfriend said he had feared for the safety of people around Sheila, who had a &quot;deep and intense dislike&quot; of June, her adoptive mother. The defence argued that people who have carried out so-called &quot;altruistic&quot; killings have been known to engage in ritualistic behaviour before killing themselves, and that Sheila might have placed the silencer in the cupboard, changed her clothes and washed herself, which would explain why there was little lead on her hands, or why sugar from the floor was not found on her feet. There was also a possibility that the blood in the silencer was not hers, but was a mixture of Nevill&#x27;s and June&#x27;s.

===Summing up, verdict===

The judge told the jury that there were three crucial points, in no particular order. Did they believe Mugford or Jeremy? Were they sure that Sheila was not the killer who then committed suicide? He said this question involved another: was the second, fatal, shot fired at Sheila with the silencer on? If yes, she could not have fired it. Finally, did Nevill call Jeremy in the middle of the night? If there was no such call, it undermined the entirety of Jeremy&#x27;s story; the only reason he would have had to invent the phone call was that he was responsible for the murders.

On 28 October, after deliberating for more than nine hours, the jury found Jeremy guilty by a majority of 10–2 (the minimum required for conviction). Sentencing him to five life terms, with a recommendation that he serve a minimum of twenty-five years, the judge told Jeremy: &quot;Your conduct in planning and carrying out the killing of five members of your family was evil, almost beyond belief.&quot; In December 1994, Home Secretary Michael Howard told Jeremy that he would remain in prison for the rest of his life, following a decision in 1988 by the Home Secretary of the day, Douglas Hurd.

==Appeals==
===Leave to appeal refused, 1989 and 1994===
Jeremy first sought leave to appeal in November 1986, arguing that the judge had misdirected the jury. The application was heard and refused by Mr Justice Caulfield in April 1988. During a full hearing in March 1989 before three Appeal Court judges—Lord Lane, the Lord Chief Justice; Mr Justice Roch; and Mr Justice Henry—Jeremy&#x27;s lawyer, Geoffrey Rivlin QC, argued that the trial judge&#x27;s summing up had been biased against his client, that his language had been too forceful, and that he had undermined the defence by advancing his own theory. Rivlin also argued that the defence had not pressed Mugford about her dealings with the media but should have, because as soon as the trial was over her story began to appear in newspapers. On 20 March 1989 the judges refused Jeremy leave to appeal, ruling that there was nothing unsafe or unsatisfactory about the verdicts.

Because the trial judge had criticized the police investigation, Essex Police held an internal inquiry. Jeremy alleged this report confirmed that evidence had been withheld by the police so he made a formal complaint, which was investigated in 1991 by the City of London Police. This investigation uncovered more material, which Jeremy used to petition the Home Secretary in September 1993 for a referral back to the Court of Appeal, refused in July 1994. During this process, the Home Office declined to give Jeremy the expert evidence it had obtained, so he applied for judicial review of their decision in November 1994, which resulted in the Home Office handing over the evidence. In 1996 a police officer destroyed many of the trial exhibits, saying later he had not been aware that the case was ongoing. Jeremy&#x27;s defence team referred to the destruction of blood samples as a &quot;disgrace&quot;.

===Court of Appeal, 2002===
====Criminal Cases Review Commission referral====
In 1997 the Home Office passed Jeremy&#x27;s case to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which had just been established to review alleged miscarriages of justice. In March 2001 the CCRC referred the case to the Court of Appeal because of the discovery of DNA inside the silencer; this was found as a result of a test not available in 1986 and constituted fresh evidence. Jeremy&#x27;s conviction rested in part on evidence that Sheila&#x27;s blood had been found inside the silencer, suggesting that it had been on the gun when she died; but her arms were not long enough to point the gun back at herself and pull the trigger with the silencer attached. The appeal was heard from 17 October to 1 November 2002, at the Royal Courts of Justice, by Lord Justice Kay, Mr Justice Wright and Mr Justice Henriques, who published their decision on 12 December 2002. The prosecution was represented by Victor Temple QC and Jeremy by Michael Turner QC. In a 522-paragraph judgment, the judges concluded that there was no conduct on the part of investigators that threatened the integrity of the trial, and that the more they examined the case, the more they thought the jury had been right.

====Grounds====
Jeremy initially brought sixteen issues to the attention of the court. Two (grounds 14 and 15) related to the silencer and DNA testing; the rest were about failure to disclose evidence or the fabrication of evidence. The defence withdrew ground 11 (&quot;the proposed purchase of a Porsche by the appellant&quot;) before the hearing.
*Ground 1a – &quot;hand swabs from Sheila Caffell&quot;
*1b – &quot;the testing of the hand swabs from Sheila Caffell&quot;
*2 – &quot;disturbance of the crime scene&quot;
*3 – &quot;evidence relating to windows&quot;
*4 – &quot;timing of phone call to Julie Mugford&quot;
*5 – &quot;evidence relevant to the credibility of Julie Mugford&quot;
*6 – &quot;letter from Colin Caffell&quot;
*7 – &quot;the statement of Colin Caffell&quot;
*8 – &quot;photograph showing carving of the words &#x27;I hate this place&#x27;&quot;
*9 – &quot;the Bible&quot;
*10 – &quot;the question of inheritance&quot;
*11 – &quot;the proposed purchase of a Porsche by the appellant&quot;
*12 – &quot;the telephone in the office&quot;
*13 – &quot;scars on the appellant&#x27;s hands&quot;
*14 and 15 – &quot;blood in the sound moderator&quot;
*15 – &quot;DNA evidence&quot;
*16 – &quot;police misconduct&quot;
====New silencer evidence====

Although all the grounds (except 11) were reviewed by the court, the CCRC referred the case to the Court of Appeal on the basis of ground 15, the discovery of DNA on the silencer, the result of a test not available in 1986. The silencer evidence during the trial had come from John Hayward, a biologist in private practice, formerly of the FSS. He had found a &quot;considerable amount of blood&quot; inside the silencer; he had stated that it was human blood and that the blood group was consistent with it having come from Sheila. He said there was a &quot;remote possibility&quot; that it was a mixture of blood from Nevill and June.

Mark Webster, an expert instructed by Jeremy&#x27;s defence team, argued that Hayward&#x27;s tests had been inadequate and that there was a real possibility, not a remote one, that the blood had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something she could not have done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution&#x27;s position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.

The defence argued that new tests comparing DNA in the silencer to a sample from Sheila&#x27;s biological mother suggested that the &quot;major component&quot; of the DNA in the silencer had not come from Sheila. A DNA sample from June&#x27;s sister suggested that the major component had come from June, the defence argued. The court concluded that June&#x27;s DNA was in the silencer, that Sheila&#x27;s DNA may have been in the silencer, and that there was evidence of DNA from at least one male. The judges&#x27; conclusion was that the results were complex, incomplete, and also meaningless because they did not establish how June&#x27;s DNA came to be in the silencer years after the trial, did not establish that Sheila&#x27;s was not in it, and did not lead to a conclusion that Jeremy&#x27;s conviction was unsafe.

===Against whole-life tariff===

In 2008 Jeremy lost a High Court appeal before Mr Justice Tugendhat against his whole-life tariff. This was upheld by the Court of Appeal in 2009. Jeremy and three other British whole-life prisoners appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, but the appeal was rejected in 2012. Jeremy and two of the prisoners (one of them the serial killer Peter Moore) appealed that decision, and in 2013 the European Court&#x27;s Grand Chamber ruled that keeping the prisoners in jail with no prospect of release or review may not have been compatible with Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment.

==Campaign==
===Background===

A campaign, known from November 2015 as JB Campaign Ltd, gathered pace over the years to secure Jeremy&#x27;s release. The civil-liberties group Justice for All took up his case in 1993 to prepare for his appeal that year, and &quot;The Guardian&quot; ran a long investigative piece by Jim Shelley in November 1993 that included a telephone interview with Jeremy from HMP Long Martin, Worcestershire; Jeremy said he still could not understand why he had been convicted. From March 2001 several websites were set up to discuss the evidence, and in 2002 Jeremy used one of the sites to offer a £1 million reward for evidence that would overturn his conviction. Campaign events included a supporter reading a letter from Jeremy to his parents at their graveside, and a &quot;Bamber bake-off&quot; featuring his mother&#x27;s favourite recipes.

Jeremy&#x27;s case was taken up by MPs George Galloway (Respect) and Andrew Hunter (DUP) and journalists Bob Woffinden and Eric Allison of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Allison became one of the campaign&#x27;s patrons. Woffinden argued between 2007 and 2011 that Sheila had shot her family, then watched as police gathered outside before shooting herself. He changed his mind in 2011 and said he believed Jeremy was guilty. In 2015 the human-rights campaigner Peter Tatchell appealed to the Chief Constable of Essex Police to disclose all evidence related to the case.

===Campaign&#x27;s arguments===
====Location of Sheila&#x27;s body, time of death====
The defence disputed the location of Sheila&#x27;s body. The police said they had found her upstairs with her mother. According to early police logs, one officer reported seeing through a window what he thought was the body of a woman near the kitchen door, but he later radioed that it was a man. A retired police officer who worked on the case said in 2011 that the first police logs were simply mistaken in reporting that a woman&#x27;s body had been found downstairs. Jeremy&#x27;s lawyers argued that images of Sheila taken by a police photographer at around 9 am on 7 August 1985 showed that her blood was still wet. According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30 am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9 am. They argued that she was alive when Jeremy was standing outside the house with the police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the bedroom, where she shot herself again, this time fatally.

====Alleged crime-scene damage====
The defence argued that the first officers to enter the farmhouse had inadvertently disturbed the crime scene, then reconstructed it. Crime-scene photographs not made available to the original defence show Sheila&#x27;s right arm and hand in slightly different positions in relation to the gun, which is lying across her body. The gun itself also appears to have moved. Former Detective Chief Superintendent Mick Gradwell of Lancashire Constabulary, shown the photographs by &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said in 2011: &quot;The evidence shows, or portrays, Essex police having damaged the scene, and then having staged it again to make it look like it was originally. And if that has happened, and that hasn&#x27;t been disclosed, that is really, really serious.&quot;

====Arguments about the silencer====

The contention that the gun had a silencer on it during the murders was central to the prosecution&#x27;s case; Jeremy and his lawyers have sought since 1987 to discredit the silencer evidence. With the silencer fitted, the gun was too long for Sheila to have turned it on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed to have been made during a fight for the gun. That the silencer was found in the gun cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—blighted the prosecution&#x27;s case, although it was accepted by a majority of the jury.

Lee writes that the silencer evidence became confused because of the way the exhibit was named. It was first called &quot;SBJ/1&quot;, because it was handed over by Detective Sergeant Stan Jones (SBJ). When it was learned that David Boutflour had found it, the silencer was renamed exhibit &quot;DB/1&quot;. But because there was a Detective Constable David Bird, it was renamed again to &quot;DRB/1&quot;. The name changes led to confusion in later documents, giving the impression that more than one silencer had been found. In 2011, Lee writes, Jeremy&#x27;s blog announced: &quot;We can now prove 100% that there were two sound moderators obtained by police at different times.&quot; The CCRC responded that year that the claims were &quot;not supported by the material that exists&quot;. Again in 2013 Jeremy&#x27;s blog said: &quot;I can now prove with 100% certainty that Essex police seized one Parker Hale (MM1 type) suppressor from the house on 7 August 1985&quot; (the day of the murder, rather than the day the cousin found it). According to &quot;The Times&quot; in 2013, he aimed to show that the police had taken four silencers from his family members, including the one in the cupboard, and that evidence and paperwork from them—and from an additional laboratory silencer—had been mixed up.

In or around 2012, Jeremy&#x27;s lawyers commissioned gun experts from the US and UK to examine photographs of the bodies and the silencer evidence. They argued that injuries on the bodies were consistent with the silencer not having been used, and that its absence would explain burn marks on Nevill&#x27;s body. The court had heard that &quot;three circular burn type marks&quot; had been found on Nevill&#x27;s back. In November 1985 a police report submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions had argued that the burn marks were made with the hot end of the gun or with a poker from the AGA cooker.

====Arguments about scratch marks====

The defence commissioned a report from Peter Sutherst, a British forensic photographic expert, who was asked in 2008 to examine negatives of the kitchen taken on the day of the murders and later. In his report, dated 17 January 2010, Sutherst argued that the scratch marks in the red paintwork on the kitchen mantelpiece had been created after the crime-scene photographs had been taken. The prosecution alleged that the marks had been made during the struggle in the kitchen between Bamber and his father, as the silencer, attached to the rifle, had scratched against the mantelpiece. The prosecution said that paint chips identical to the paint on the mantelpiece had been found on or inside the silencer. Sutherst said the scratch marks appeared in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 days after the murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said he had failed to find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where it might have been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. Sutherst was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila&#x27;s toes. Sutherst concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.

====Arguments about police logs====

Police telephone logs had been entered as evidence during the trial, but had not been noticed by Jeremy&#x27;s lawyers. Jeremy&#x27;s new defence team based their new CCRC submissions in part on these logs, particularly on the radio log that, they say, shows Nevill called police that night to say his daughter had &quot;gone berserk&quot; with one of his guns. A separate log of a police radio message shows there was an attempt to speak to someone inside the farmhouse that night, as police waited outside to enter, but there was no response. Police say the officers simply made a mistake.

====Arguments about Mugford letter====

Jeremy&#x27;s lawyers argued that the 26 September 1985 letter to Mugford from John Walker, assistant director of public prosecutions, raised the possibility that she had been persuaded to testify in the hope that charges against her would not be pursued. In the letter, Walker had suggested to the Chief Constable of Essex Police, &quot;with considerable hesitation&quot;, that Mugford not be prosecuted for drug offences, burglary and cheque fraud, offences to which she had confessed during her police interviews regarding Bamber. The defence team also highlighted that, as soon as the verdict was announced, Mugford sold her story to the &quot;News of the World&quot; for £25,000 (equivalent to £ in ).

==Criminal Cases Review Commission, 2004–2012==
In 2004 Jeremy&#x27;s defence team, which included Giovanni di Stefano, applied unsuccessfully to have the CCRC refer the case back to the Court of Appeal. His lawyers made a fresh submission to the CCRC in 2009. The CCRC provisionally rejected Jeremy&#x27;s 2009 submission in February 2011 in an 89-page document. It invited his lawyers to respond within three months, extended the deadline to allow them to study all 406 crime-scene photographs, and in September 2011 granted them an indefinite period in which to pursue an additional line of inquiry.

The CCRC finally rejected the application in April 2012 in a 109-page report, which said the submission had not identified any new evidence or legal argument that would raise the real possibility of the Court of Appeal overturning the conviction. In November 2012 the High Court turned down Bamber&#x27;s application for a judicial review of that decision. The next year, di Stefano was sentenced in the UK to 14 years in prison for having fraudulently presented himself as a lawyer. Jeremy&#x27;s defence team was said to be preparing a fresh submission.

== In popular media ==
The case became the subject of a television drama series, &quot;White House Farm&quot;, starring Freddie Fox as Bamber and Cressida Bonas as Sheila, broadcast in January 2020 on ITV in the UK and HBO Max in the United States. In 2021, documentary maker Louis Theroux produced a four-part series for Sky Crime on the murders, titled &quot;The Bambers: Murder At The Farm&quot;. Theroux told the &quot;Radio Times&quot; that the series had to be extended from an initial three-episode format due to the complexities of the case, and told Sky News that &quot;both scenarios have anomalies&quot;.

<text>The Chiesa di San Felice (Church of St Felix) is a Roman Catholic church in Florence, region of Tuscany, Italy. It is located on the south bank of the River Arno, just west of the Pitti Palace. It is predominantly Gothic, but has a Renaissance façade by Michelozzo, added in 1457. Over the high altar is a large Crucifix attributed to Giotto or his school.

== History ==
A church at the site was built about the 10th-century outside one of the gates of early walls of Florence. It first belonged to the Monastery of San Silvestro of Nonantola, and in 1413 it was transferred to the Camaldolese Order. In 1552, it became property of the Dominican nuns of San Pietro Martire. The church provided a sanctuary to women fleeing from abusive husbands.

== Interior and artwork ==
The interior had a &quot;Madonna with Child and Saints&quot; by Ridolfo Ghirlandaio. Another chapel has a fresco by Giovanni da San Giovanni, depicting &quot;San Felice reviving St Massimo&quot;; the angels gathering the grapes in the painting are by Baldassare Franceschini. It had a triptych (1467) by Neri di Bicci, depicting &quot;St Augustin and St John Baptist, and St Julian and King St Sigismond&quot;. Another chapel had a &quot;Madonna and Child with St Hyacinth&quot;, by Jacopo da Empoli. The church has a &quot;Last Supper&quot; by Matteo Rosselli.

<text>James Paul DePaiva (born October 8, 1957) is an American actor. He is best known for playing the role of Max Holden on the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; (1987 to 1990, 1991 to 2003, returning briefly in 2007).

== Early life ==
DePaiva was born in Hayward, California, but he was raised in Livermore. He is related to a Central Park designer and also former U.S. President Andrew Johnson. DePaiva&#x27;s father was a jazz musician. He has said that he was raised in a very strict household. In his early teens, he struggled with his weight and became insecure.

DePaiva started acting in school plays when he was in the seventh grade. Instead of pursuing it, he focused on music. He began playing the electric bass professionally at the age of fifteen. DePaiva played punk rock, Latin rock, and country-western in several bands, including Livewire. He got a job at a music store and became an apprentice, eventually making plans to buy the store.

When DePaiva was twenty two, his father died from cancer. At the time of his father&#x27;s death, he was abusing drugs. He decided to stop taking drugs and focus on the career that he really wanted, which was acting. DePaiva studied drama, as well as fencing, ballet, and jazz dance at a community college.
==Career==
DePaiva&#x27;s early roles were in local theater. His stage credits include &quot;The Fifth of July&quot;, &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot;, &quot;The Desk Set&quot;, &quot;Company&quot;, &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, &quot;The School for Scandal&quot;, and &quot;All&#x27;s Well That Ends Well&quot;. He acted for several months at a repertory theatre in Solvang. DePaiva met someone who offered to introduce him to an agent and also the casting director of the ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;, if he would take a role in his play. DePaiva did the play, then moved to Los Angeles.

After meeting with Marvin Page, the casting director of &quot;General Hospital&quot;, DePaiva became an extra on the show, then an under-five. He finally landed a recurring role in 1985, playing a waiter who flirted with Holly (Emma Samms). The character was credited at the time as Greenhouse Waiter. He didn&#x27;t receive a name until 1995, when DePaiva was interviewed for the book &quot;General Hospital: The Complete Scrapbook&quot;. Author Gary Warner asked him to supply a character name to print in the book and DePaiva told him it was Eddie Holton, which was actually the name of a crew member he worked with on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. 

DePaiva took acting classes and studied with Stella Adler. He appeared as a day player on the NBC soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; and guest starred on &quot;Simon &amp; Simon&quot;. He auditioned for the role of Jamie Frame on the NBC soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; (which went to Laurence Lau).

DePaiva landed his big break when he joined the cast of the ABC soap opera &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as Max Holden in 1987. He played the role until December 1988, when he announced that he wouldn&#x27;t be signing a new contract. Eight days after leaving, he started negotiating a new contract with the show and began appearing on screen again two months later. In early 1990, he announced that he would be leaving again. The role was recast with Nicholas Walker. 

DePaiva moved to Los Angeles, where he guest starred on an episode of &quot;Mathnet&quot;. He also appeared in a television commercial for Fruit of the Loom, co-starring with Ed Marinaro and Patrick Duffy. He returned to &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as Max Holden in October 1991. DePaiva and his &quot;OLTL&quot; co-stars Susan Batten and David Ledingham appeared in the music video for Roy Orbison and K.d. lang&#x27;s &quot;Cryin&#x27;&quot; in 1992.

In 1997, DePaiva nearly left &quot;One Life to Live&quot; to play Ben Warren on the CBS soap opera &quot;Guiding Light&quot;, a character who had been created for him. He decided to stay on &quot;OLTL&quot; and the role went to Hunt Block instead.

On February 14, 2002, DePaiva and his wife, Kassie DePaiva, starred on stage in A. R. Gurney&#x27;s &quot;Love Letters&quot; at Jersey Central Theatre.

In 2003, DePaiva announced at &quot;One Life to Live&quot;&#x27;s annual fan club gathering that he had been dismissed from the show. His final airdate was October 27, 2003. He made a brief return to the series in August 2007 for the 9,999th and 10,000th episodes.

DePaiva directed the 2006 film &quot;Undone&quot;, which was produced by his wife, Kassie DePaiva. The film starred Kassie, Heather Tom, Forbes March, Timothy D. Stickney, and Ricky Paull Goldin. DePaiva began directing episodes of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; in the late 1990s. After leaving the role of Max in 2003, he continued to direct the show. He also directed episodes of the CBS soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;. 

In 2009, DePaiva and his wife, Kassie DePaiva, starred in a Time Life infomercial for a CD box set, &quot;The Power of Love&quot;. 

In January 2010, DePaiva co-starred with Georgia Engel in &quot;High Spirits&quot;, a musical take on Noël Coward&#x27;s play &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; at the Community School of Naples. In April 2011, he starred in &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot; at The Players Theatre in New York. He also appeared in a production of &quot;Tricky Wicked Bitch&quot;. Returning to the Community School of Naples, DePaiva co-starred with his wife, Kassie DePaiva, in the musical &quot;110 in the Shade&quot; in May 2013.

DePaiva played Eddy Parish on the web series &quot;Tainted Dreams&quot; in 2013. From June 2017 to 2018, he played the recurring role of Dr. David Bensch on &quot;General Hospital&quot;. He starred on stage as Dr. Jack Chase in &quot;Chasing Jack.&quot; The play ran from October 5-8, 2017 at Fordham University School of Law.

==Personal life==
DePaiva&#x27;s first marriage ended in divorce. He then married actress Misty Rowe, best known for &quot;Hee Haw&quot;, on June 4, 1986. Rowe suffered a miscarriage in 1990, during her sixth month of pregnancy. A medical error occurred during dilation and curettage, causing her to hemorrhage excessively. Soon after, she became ill due to a reaction from a bee sting. Rowe recovered and eventually became pregnant again, giving birth to their daughter in July 1992 in Los Angeles. DePaiva wasn&#x27;t present at the birth, because he was on a flight from New York, where &quot;One Life to Live&quot; was filmed. Rowe announced to Soap Opera Digest in February 1995 that DePaiva had asked her for a divorce.

He first met Kassie DePaiva (then known by her maiden name, Kassie Wesley) in the late 1980s at the Whaler Bar in New York, where she was singing. They didn&#x27;t see each other again until 1993, when she was cast on &quot;One Life to Live&quot;. They were married on May 31, 1996 at the courthouse in her hometown of Morganfield, Kentucky. Kassie has said that she scheduled her wedding in between a dentist appointment and a golf game. They had a more formal wedding in June 1996 at their home in the Catskills. The ceremony included DePaiva&#x27;s daughter, who was then four years old. 

The DePaivas have one son, James Quentin (J. Q.) DePaiva, who was born on May 12, 1997. When he was twelve months old, they learned that he had been born with an enlarged vestibular aqueduct, an inner-ear abnormality that caused him to be completely deaf. He received his first cochlear implant at eighteen months old and his second at eight years old. The DePaivas have lobbied congress to make hearing tests mandatory for newborns in all fifty states. In September 2007, J. Q. had a recurring role as Jason on &quot;All My Children.&quot; His character appeared on Erica Kane&#x27;s television show at her request in hopes that he would help her daughter Kendall deal with the hearing loss of her own son, Spike.
