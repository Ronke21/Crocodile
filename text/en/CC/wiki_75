<doc id="865747" wikidata="Q5933665" url="?curid=865747" title="Hugo's House of Horrors">
<text>Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors (titled Hugo&#x27;s Horrific Adventure in the Microsoft Windows version) is a parser-based adventure game designed by independent software developer David P. Gray and published as shareware in 1990. The game follows the character Hugo as he searches for his girlfriend Penelope in a haunted house. To progress through the game, the player uses items and interacts with the environment to solve puzzles and access more rooms in the house. The gameplay was inspired by &quot;Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards&quot;. &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; was praised for its environment and atmosphere, but was criticized for its plot and visual design. It was followed by two sequels: &quot;Hugo II, Whodunit?&quot; and &quot;Hugo III, Jungle of Doom!&quot;, and a spin-off first-person shooter game, &quot;Nitemare 3D&quot;.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; is a parser-based adventure game, and the player interacts with the game by typing commands into the parser. This includes actions such as looking or grabbing items. Some synonyms are recognized and work as alternative inputs. Most puzzles are solved by using an item in the inventory to interact with the environment. The player controls Hugo&#x27;s movement with the arrow keys on the keyboard. Pressing the key starts Hugo&#x27;s movement, and pressing it again makes him stop. The numeric keypad is also supported, which allows diagonal movement.

Picking up items and completing certain actions gives the player points, and the points counter will reach its maximum once the player has completed every action and finished the game. &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; allows the player to freely save and load at any point, and it provides a boss key to hide the program. The game is short, with a successful play through offering from ten minutes to one hour of gameplay. In the &quot;Hugo Trilogy&quot; release, the text parser is replaced by a point and click interface.

As with many adventure games of the time, some puzzles result in an immediate game over if the player responds incorrectly, and the game can become unwinnable if certain items are not collected while they are available. This includes four different points in which the player must react immediately to avoid a game over. This sometimes means that the correct command must be typed and ready to submit before the player enters the next room.

==Plot==
The plot of &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; is limited to what is necessary to explain the game&#x27;s premise. Hugo ventures to a haunted house after his girlfriend, Penelope, goes there for a babysitting job and gets kidnapped. As he explores the house, he finds a vicious hungry dog, a mad scientist, and a dining room full of classic horror monsters. No explanation is given for why these characters are present in the house or what their motivations are. Hugo discovers a secret cave underneath the house where he evades a mummy and then encounters an old man who asks him trivia questions before letting him pass. Hugo answers the man&#x27;s questions and goes into the next room to find Penelope. He frees her, and the two escape from the house.

==Development and design==

&quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; was a one-man project created by David P. Gray. According to Gray, he pursued self-employment after worrying about job security, and he chose software development after a chance encounter with a gynecologist who made money writing computer programs on the side. He founded Gray Design Associates, initially producing business oriented software before switching to video games. He had previous experience designing video games from practicing with the vector graphics system provided to him while he worked for the UK Ministry of Defence. Gray developed &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; in 1989.

Gray described &quot;Leisure Suit Larry in the Land of the Lounge Lizards&quot; as the inspiration for the gameplay in &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot;. He had noted the long list of credits for the game and wished to produce a similar game entirely on his own. The alliterative title was chosen as a tribute to &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot;, as it allowed the executable file to be titled HHH.exe, similar to &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot;&#x27;s LLL.exe. The gameplay is similar to that used by the Adventure Game Interpreter, the game engine used for games such as &quot;King&#x27;s Quest&quot;, &quot;Space Quest&quot;, and &quot;Police Quest&quot;. Gray also took inspiration from the character design in &quot;Captain Comic.&quot;

Gray&#x27;s goal in designing the game was to replicate the atmosphere he felt when he first played &quot;Colossal Cave Adventure&quot;. He likened the opening scene of &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; to text adventure games that start in front of a house. Gray intentionally did not include lengthy exposition or instructions in &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot;, saying that he was impatient with these things in games. He determined that anyone who could not figure out the first puzzle themselves would probably not enjoy the game anyway. There is little dialogue in the game, and most text that appears are simple explanations of what is happening in the room. &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; uses a 16 color palette, and music and sound effects are limited to chiptune sounds produced by the PC speaker. The original game requires an IBM PC compatible computer with Enhanced Graphics Adapter or Video Graphics Array. More recent computers cannot run the game, but it is compatible with DOS emulators such as DOSBox.

Keith Stuart of &quot;The Guardian&quot; cited &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; as an early example of an indie game with horror elements. The game features several horror-themed elements, including a haunted mansion, a lightning storm, and bats. The haunted house premise arose from a cartoon image of a haunted house that Gray had purchased, choosing to design the game around this image. Gray cited &quot;Hammer House of Horror&quot; as an inspiration for the game&#x27;s theme, including the character of Dr. Hamerstein, a mad scientist.

== Release ==
Gray released &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; on January 1, 1990. He first released it by uploading it to CompuServe forums and it saw success as a shareware game. The game was a commonly featured entry in shareware adventure game compilations. According to Gray, it was the first graphical adventure game to be released as shareware. He attributed its success to the relatively limited selection of such games in shareware. After it was successful as shareware, Gray sold a retail version of the game through different vendors before signing with Sofsource. Unlike most shareware games, there were no differences in the shareware and retail versions of the game. Instead, the retail version included a book of hints. The shareware version also allowed paid registration, and according to Gray, this earned him six times as much income as the retail version. The registered version also included the book of hints.

&quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; was re-released on Windows in 1995 as part of the &quot;Hugo Trilogy&quot;. When porting the game to Windows 3.1, Gray replaced the parser-based gameplay with a point-and-click interface inspired by &quot;Beneath a Steel Sky&quot;, and he added new sound effects using Sound Blaster. The original DOS game was written in Microsoft Quick C, and the port to Windows was written in Microsoft Visual C++. The point-and-click version of the game is titled &quot;Hugo&#x27;s Horrific Adventure&quot;. By 2008, Gray said that he had forgotten why he changed the name.

== Reception and legacy ==
Lee Perkins of &quot;The Age&quot; listed &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; as an example of a popular high quality shareware game in 1993. Meghann O&#x27;Neill of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; praised the game&#x27;s focus on exploration and puzzles without excessive exposition. Richard Cobbett of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; criticized the game for its poor art design, its limited puzzles, its lack of narrative, and its short length. Reece Warrender of &quot;Adventure Gamers&quot; praised the game&#x27;s atmosphere but criticized it for its sound design, counter-intuitive puzzles, and limited parser vocabulary. Gray himself acknowledged weaknesses in the game, describing it as short game with &quot;rudimentary&quot; graphics and little plot.&quot;

Players often compare &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; to the point-and-click adventure game &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot;, which features a similar premise and humor. Gray has responded that he had never played &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; and was only aware of the similarities after &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; was released. Hugo&#x27;s parser-based gameplay was already outdated by the time the game was created, as &quot;Maniac Mansion&quot; had already popularized the SCUMM game engine.

Gray created two sequels for &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot;: &quot;Hugo II, Whodunit?&quot; and &quot;Hugo III, Jungle of Doom!&quot;. &quot;Nitemare 3D&quot;, a first-person shooter created by Gray, also features the characters of Hugo and Penelope and the same general plot as &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot;. Fan versions of &quot;Hugo&#x27;s House of Horrors&quot; have since been created. An unlicensed port was created using Adventure Game Studio in 2001, but was taken down after Gray issued a cease and desist letter. A surrealist choose-your-own-adventure modification of the game titled &quot;HHH&quot; was created as part of the 2014 Interactive Fiction Competition.

<doc id="865750" wikidata="Q2231486" url="?curid=865750" title="The People's Court">
<text>The People&#x27;s Court is an American arbitration-based reality court show, featuring an arbitrator handling small claims disputes in a simulated courtroom set. Within the court show genre, it is the first of all arbitration-based reality-style programs, which has overwhelmingly become the convention of the genre. The original series ran from 1981 to 1993, and the revival ran from 1997 to 2023. Both versions ran in first-run syndication. The show ranks as the longest-running traditional court show and second-longest-running court show in general, having a total of 38 overall seasons as of the 2022–23 television year, behind only niche court show &quot;Divorce Court&quot; by 2 seasons.

The first version of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; was presided over solely by former Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Joseph Wapner. The final incarnation of the show had different presiding judges: former New York City Mayor Ed Koch (1997–1999), former New York Supreme Court Judge Jerry Sheindlin (1999–2001), and former Florida State Circuit Court Judge Marilyn Milian (2001–2023). Milian is the show&#x27;s longest-reigning arbiter, presiding over the series for 22 years.

The program is the third highest rated of court shows after only &quot;Judge Judy&quot; reruns (ended the original run in July 2021) and &quot;Hot Bench&quot; (produced by Judy Sheindlin), respectively. With &quot;Judge Judy&quot;″s end at 25 seasons in 2021, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;″s revival now boasts the genre&#x27;s longest single production continuance having entered its 26th season in the 2022–23 television year (albeit having gone through 3 arbitrators). In June 2021, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; won its 4th Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program, which officially gives it the most Daytime Emmy wins in the court show genre. In February 2023, it was confirmed that the 26th season of the revival would be its last. The final episode aired on July 21, 2023.

==Conception==
When John Masterson devised the original camera-in-court concept in 1975, he first pitched it to Monty Hall, the producer and host of the game show &quot;Let&#x27;s Make a Deal&quot;, and his partner, producer-writer Stefan Hatos. They put a young associate, Stu Billett, in charge of selling it, but the networks were not interested. Billett later went out on his own and refined the concept into a show shot in a studio rather than a real courtroom. Small-claims court participants agreed to drop their court cases and accept binding arbitration in a simulated courtroom. The networks expressed interest, but still did not buy it; however, it did sell into the first-run syndication market. The series was executive produced by Ralph Edwards, who also created and hosted the documentary show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, and Stu Billett, who later went on to create &quot;Moral Court&quot;. John Masterson, whom many consider a pioneer and originator of &quot;reality TV&quot; also created &quot;Bride and Groom&quot; and &quot;Queen for a Day&quot;.

&quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; is the first court show to use binding arbitration, introducing the format into the genre in 1981. The system has been duplicated by most of the show&#x27;s successors in the judicial genre. Moreover, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; is the first popular, long-running reality in the judicial genre. It was preceded only by a few short-lived realities in the genre; these short-lived predecessors were only loosely related to judicial proceedings, except for one: &quot;Parole&quot; (1959) took footage from real-life courtrooms holding legal proceedings. Before &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;, the vast majority of TV courtroom shows used actors, and recreated or fictional cases (as did radio before that). Examples of these types of court shows include &quot;Famous Jury Trials&quot; and &quot;Your Witness&quot;.

&quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; has had two incarnations. The show&#x27;s first life was presided over solely by former Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Joseph Wapner. His tenure lasted from the show&#x27;s debut on September 14, 1981, until May 28, 1993, when the show was canceled due to falling ratings. This left the show with a total of 2,484 half-hour episodes and 12 seasons. The show was taped in Los Angeles during its first life. After being canceled, reruns aired in syndication until September 9, 1994, and on the USA Network from October 16, 1995, to June 6, 1997.

On September 8, 1997, after being out of production for four years, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; was revived in first-run syndication as a 60-minute program. Former lawyer and Mayor of New York Ed Koch was chosen as arbiter, which he maintained for two seasons. By the 1999–2000 season, former New York State Supreme Court Judge Jerry Sheindlin (husband of Judy Sheindlin from &quot;Judge Judy&quot; and &quot;Judy Justice&quot;) succeeded Koch. Sheindlin only lasted one and a half seasons and was replaced towards the end of the 2000–01 season. For the remainder of the revival&#x27;s run, Marilyn Milian was the judge.

==Original version (1981–1993)==
&quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; pilot episode was taped on October 23, 1980, with a second pilot episode taped on January 13, 1981. The show debuted as a half-hour program on September 14, 1981.
The judge from the show&#x27;s first 12 seasons (including the 1980 pilot) was Joseph Wapner. Rusty Burrell was his bailiff, Jack Harrell was the announcer, and Doug Llewelyn was the host and court reporter, who announced the matter of the dispute at the beginning of each trial. He also interviewed the plaintiff and the defendant after the court ruling, to gauge their responses to the verdict. Llewelyn often ended each episode with a jaunty &quot;If you&#x27;re in a dispute with another party and you can&#x27;t seem to work things out, don&#x27;t take the law into your own hands; you take &#x27;em to court,&quot; which became something of the 1980s catchphrase. If a case ended with a verdict for the defendant, however, Llewelyn instead ended the episode by saying, &quot;If someone files a lawsuit against you and yet you&#x27;re convinced you&#x27;ve done nothing wrong, don&#x27;t be intimidated. The best policy is to go to court and stand up for your rights.&quot; The cases often had pun-related names, such as &quot;The Overdone Underthings&quot; and &quot;A Head with a Beer on It&quot;. Judge Wapner greeted his litigants by saying, &quot;I know each of you has been sworn. I&#x27;ve read your complaint...&quot; Occasionally, if an episode wrapped up a few minutes early, Judge Wapner fielded questions from the courtroom observers, or legal consultant Harvey Levin explained the legal reasons behind Wapner&#x27;s decisions.

&quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; deals in small-claims matters. When the show debuted as a half-hour program on September 14, 1981, litigants could not sue for more than US$1,500, which was the limit for small-claims court at the time in California. As the laws in California changed, so did this amount. Starting in 1990, litigants could sue for up to US$5,000, which is now the law in most states.
Researchers for the show examined small-claims filings in Southern California and approached the plaintiff and defendant in interesting cases. The producers offered to have Judge Wapner arbitrate the dispute if they would agree to dismiss their action and be bound by Judge Wapner&#x27;s decision. Through this approach, the show could get real people with real cases. Though the show is decorated and runs like a real courtroom, it is not a real court or part of any judicial system, but instead a form of binding arbitration.

The losing party does not need to pay the judgment, as such. Instead (as is stated in the disclaimer at the end of each show), both parties are paid from a fund (set up by Ralph Edwards-Stu Billett Productions). This fund was based on the amount of the lawsuit claim, but an exact formula was not stated. The fund was to be first divided equally, then any monetary judgment ordered was subtracted from the loser&#x27;s half (and presumably both halves in the case of cross judgments). Each litigant received at least what remained of their half in shows concluding with that disclaimer.
The disclaimer did not call this fund an &quot;appearance fee&quot;, a term which appeared later in connection with &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; and other court shows. There may have been a later period when &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; paid the judgment, plus expenses and only a modest appearance fee to each litigant.

===Cancellation===
In 1993, after 12 seasons on &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;, Wapner was not invited back to the show. The show&#x27;s producers wished to revamp the series, but they did not notify him of that decision, which he eventually learned of from his brother-in-law, who read about it in the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. Wapner expressed holding great resentment and bitterness at the show&#x27;s producers for his finding out this way, and additional resentment over being let go when, according to him, the show was still doing well. However, although the show had a good run ratings-wise, the ratings had dropped to an all-time low at around the time &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; was canceled.

Wapner stated that he was told years later that the producers did not want to hurt his feelings, but that it was exactly what they did. He also stated that he was not notified when the producers decided to revamp the series and that he held no opinions on &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; judges who succeeded him as he never watched the program. He did, however, note that the two &quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot; judges who succeeded him, Ed Koch and Jerry Sheindlin, only lasted no more than two seasons each, whereas he lasted the original series&#x27; entire 12 seasons. He also emphasized that judges need to be respectful of litigants. In 2009, he returned to The People&#x27;s Court during the Marilyn Milian era to preside over a case in honor of his 90th birthday.

==Revival (1997–2023)==
After the O. J. Simpson murder trial revived interest in court shows, and &quot;Judge Judy&quot; became very successful, on September 8, 1997, a revival of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; debuted in first-run syndication. The series as a whole reached its 38th season in September 2022, with its 26th and final season in its production cycle. The 1997–2023 reincarnation has vastly outlasted the program&#x27;s original version, which ran 12 seasons. The show&#x27;s second incarnation was headed by three judges in all.

The new &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; expanded from the original version&#x27;s 30-minute length to a 60-minute broadcast where former New York Newscaster Carol Martin (1997–98) of WCBS-TV hosted from a studio. Harvey Levin (1997–2023) was also added to the show cast in a role that was added to reflect the court show&#x27;s title &quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot;: returning from breaks, Levin acting as a field reporter, is shown at an external public place taking questions and opinions from people about the case, and then, returning to the studio at the end of the show for a wrap-up. Curt Chaplin (1997–2023) replaced Jack Harrell as the show&#x27;s announcer and appeared on camera as the court reporter with the addition of a litigant-final-thoughts interviewer, known for snippily interviewing the program&#x27;s litigants following the conclusion of each case. Beginning with the 2016-17 season, Doug Llewelyn from the first incarnation of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; took over this litigant interviewing role. Chaplin, however, maintained his voice-over role in the series. In this role, Chaplin narrated the court show in a manner that poked fun at the cases with and exaggerated vocal expressions and verbiage.

===Ed Koch era (1997–1999)===

Former New York City Mayor Ed Koch presided over the court from September 8, 1997, to June 25, 1999, with reruns airing until September 10. In 1998, Carol Martin left the show, with Levin becoming the sole host. The studio segments were done away with and Levin hosted the entire episodes from the viewing area, which eventually moved from the Manhattan Mall to the Times Square visitors&#x27; center. Since Levin is now based in Los Angeles with TMZ, the viewing area has moved to the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, California, while production of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; has moved to Connecticut. The opening outlines of the taped cases are shown to people in the outdoor viewing area on a monitor. Their responses are edited into the program.

===Judge Jerry Sheindlin era (1999 – March 2001)===

Judge Jerry Sheindlin (husband of Judge Judy Sheindlin, the presiding judge over &quot;Judge Judy&quot;) sat on the bench from September 13, 1999, to March 9, 2001, and ratings on the show lagged. The bailiff for both of these judges&#x27; tenures was Josephine Ann Longobardi.

===Judge Marilyn Milian era (2001–2023)===
On March 12, 2001, late in &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;″s fourth season, retired Florida State Circuit Court Judge Marilyn Milian replaced Sheindlin as presiding judge on the court show. Under Milian, &quot;People&#x27;s Court&quot; ratings improved. Milian is the first Hispanic judge to preside over a courtroom series. By the completion of the 16th season of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; (2012–13), Milian had completed seasons presiding over the series, officially making her the longest reigning judge over the program—outlasting Joseph Wapner&#x27;s reign of 12 seasons. For the remainder of the 2000–01 season, Davey Jones took over the role of bailiff, replacing Longobardi. In September 2001, Jones was replaced by Douglas McIntosh, who remained on the show until its cancellation in July 2023.

In 2008, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;, under Milian&#x27;s reign, was nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award under a new Courtroom/Legal Show category created by the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences. In 2009 and 2010, the show was nominated again for the Daytime Emmy Award under the same category but did not win. On May 1, 2013, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; had again been nominated for an Outstanding Legal/Courtroom Program Daytime Emmy, but again did not win.

The show was taped in Manhattan for the first 15 seasons of the revival; beginning with the 16th season (2012–13), it was taped in Stamford, Connecticut.

For the show&#x27;s 20th season, Doug Llewelyn returned to the series for the first time since the end of the original series. He resumed his previous role as host/reporter, replacing Curt Chaplin, who remained in the announcer role . For Llewelyn&#x27;s first show back, Judge Milian welcomed him &quot;home&quot; and handed him his suit jacket and microphone.

===Cancellation ===
On February 18, 2023, it was announced that &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; revival would end after 26 seasons. &quot;Variety&quot; reported that the cancelation was due to a broader decline in advertising revenue for syndicated daytime shows, leading television stations to prioritize spending money on local news, rather than acquiring other programming.

This also ends a 26-year relationship with Harvey Levin and Telepictures which sold &quot;TMZ&quot; to Fox Corporation in 2021 while continuing the final two years doing &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;.

In April 2023, it was reported that Allen Media Group had signed Milian to a new show, &quot;Justice for the People with Judge Milian&quot;, set to premiere in syndication in fall 2023.

==Series overview==

===Opening disclaimer===
When &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; premiered on September 14, 1981, as a half-hour show, the first opening disclaimer was used during the first five seasons of the Wapner run, and was narrated by Jack Harrell:

Beginning in Season 6 (1986-1987), and running until the end of the Wapner run in 1993, the opening disclaimer by Jack Harrell was changed:

On September 8, 1997, when &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; expanded from 30 minutes to 60 minutes, where former New York mayor Ed Koch became the judge, the show moved to New York City, and the opening disclaimer was changed and was narrated by Curt Chaplin:

On September 13, 1999, when Jerry Sheindlin replaced Ed Koch as the judge, the opening disclaimer by Curt Chaplin was changed:

When Marilyn Milian replaced Jerry Sheindlin as the final judge on March 12, 2001, the opening disclaimer was changed:

Later, Milian&#x27;s opening disclaimer was changed:

Then, a couple of years later, Milian&#x27;s opening disclaimer changed again:
After a few months, the soundbites of Judge Milian&#x27;s voice were removed from the opening, and Curt Chaplin&#x27;s opening disclaimer was slightly changed:

In September 2009, the final opening disclaimer was used:

===Litigant compensation===
At the end of each show, the following disclaimer appeared:
Both the plaintiff and the defendant have been paid from a fund for their appearance. The amount, if any, awarded in the case, is deducted from this fund, and the remainder is divided equally between both litigants. The amount of the fund is dependent on the size of the judgment.
No information is given as to what relation the amount of the fund bears to the size of the judgment, nor the amount of the fund if a verdict for the defense is rendered.

In a talk-show appearance, Judge Wapner gave a few more specifics as to how compensation was typically calculated. In his words, if the plaintiff won, the show would pay his/her judgment and give the defendant $50 for his/her time, whereas if the defendant won, the parties would &quot;split $500&quot;. 

In 1989, a litigant sued the producers, claiming, &quot;I was only willing to appear because they guaranteed me $1,500. I never would have appeared on that show and made a fool out of myself for a chintzy $250.&quot; (In response, an associate producer said that before going on the show, participants are given a packet of information &quot;where everything is clearly outlined to the nth degree.&quot;)

&quot;The New York Post&quot; reported on some of the details surrounding compensation for a lawsuit filed by Claudia Evart. &quot;The show pays all damages awarded to defendants and plaintiffs, as well as a $250 appearance fee.&quot;

==Production notes==
The 1981–93 life of the show was initially taped at Golden West Broadcasters and, later, Metromedia Square in Los Angeles, before moving to The Production Group. In New York City, &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; first taped episodes at the NEP/Image studios in the former Grand Ballroom of the Hotel Pennsylvania, which was also the studio for the talk show &quot;Maury&quot;. In 1998, the show began taping at the MTI Studios on the 8th floor at 401 Fifth Avenue, where the courtroom received a makeover. In 2006, the MTI Studios were sold to NEP/Image. At the end credits of some episodes, the show is said to be taped at the NEP/Image studios. The former MTI studios are officially part of NEP Broadcasting&#x27;s NEP Penn Studios. 

In 2012, the show moved to the Connecticut Film Center in Stamford, taking advantage of the same state tax credits which attracted NBCUniversal&#x27;s syndication and cable divisions to the Stamford area.
The aired episodes are sometimes spliced together in a different order from which they are taped (a common procedure on some hour-long shows). This is why the judge&#x27;s blouse color may change and why fewer courtroom observers may be seen during the second half of the show than during the first half. For the 2012 season, the show started broadcasting in widescreen standard definition, before eventually converting to high-definition broadcast shortly thereafter.

All versions of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; are &quot;A Ralph Edwards-Stu Billett Production&quot; in association with Telepictures Productions and distributed by Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution (including its predecessors Telepictures and later Lorimar-Telepictures), all of which are now part of Warner Bros. Discovery.

Since June 2020, cases have been posted on the official The People&#x27;s Court YouTube channel. The channel has over 500,000 subscribers and has amassed 600 million views. Both current and old cases are posted.

===Theme music===
The theme music, &quot;The Big One (People&#x27;s Court Theme)&quot;, was composed by Alan Stanley Tew. The uptempo theme music, with a prominent piano theme and bongo drum rhythm, has been sampled by many artists, including Nelly. It has also been featured in several films and television shows, including the 1977 pornographic film &quot;Barbara Broadcast&quot;, the 1979 low-budget film &quot;Malibu High&quot;, the BCTV current affairs program &quot;Webster!&quot;, &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, &quot;The Loud House&quot;, &quot;Blue Harvest&quot;, the sixth-season premiere episode of &quot;Family Guy&quot;, the December 5, 2005, and December 21, 2009, editions of &quot;WWE Raw&quot; in Tampa, Florida, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot;, and &quot;Popular&quot;.

===2020 COVID-19 production adjustments===
When &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; resumed production for the 2020–21 season, there were several protocols put in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States earlier in the year. The studio was still set up as normal, but no spectators were allowed inside. The two litigants for each case also did not appear in court, nor did Judge Milian. Instead, the trial was conducted remotely with monitors placed behind the plaintiff&#x27;s and defendant&#x27;s stands and behind the bench. Bailiff Douglas McIntosh was present in the courtroom area to swear in the litigants, while Doug Llewelyn still conducted the post-case interviews while stationed in the corridor. Harvey Levin continued to offer commentary, doing so from his office at TMZ headquarters in Los Angeles. After each case, in a segment called &quot;After the Verdict,&quot; Judge Milian discussed her verdict in chambers with her husband, John Schlesinger, a former assistant United States attorney, who in 2004 was elected to the 11th Judicial Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County.

For the 2021–22 season, Judge Milian returned to the studio with the plaintiffs and defendants still appearing remotely.

For the start of the 2022 season, only reruns were served for the first month and a half. New episodes began to air on October 17 with all parties returning to the studio.

==British version==
A British version of the show was produced by STV Studios (then known as &quot;SMG TV Productions&quot;) to replace Trisha Goddard&#x27;s talk show on ITV from April 18 to May 27, 2005. Jerome Lynch and Rhonda Anderson served as judges, with Carol Smillie as the court reporter.

<text>All rights reversed is a phrase that indicates a release of a publication under copyleft licensing status. It is a pun on the common copyright disclaimer &quot;All rights reserved&quot;, a copyright formality originally required by the Buenos Aires Convention of 1910. However Arnoud Engelfriet writes that &quot;[t]he phrase [&#x27;All rights reversed&#x27;] by itself is not enough; a license must explicitly state the rights that are granted&quot;.

&quot;All Rights Reversed&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;rites&quot;) was used by author Gregory Hill in his Discordian text &quot;Principia Discordia&quot;.

In 1984 or 1985, programmer Don Hopkins sent Richard Stallman a letter labeled &quot;Copyleft—all rights reversed&quot;. Stallman chose the phrase to identify his free software method of distribution. It is often accompanied by a reversed version of the copyright symbol. That said, the use of the reversed copyright symbol is considered legally risky by the Free Software Foundation.

<text>An email attachment is a computer file sent along with an email message. One or more files can be attached to any email message, and be sent along with it to the recipient. This is typically used as a simple method to share documents and images.

==History, and technical detail==
Originally, ARPANET, UUCP, and Internet SMTP email allowed 7-bit ASCII text only. Text files were emailed by including them in the message body. In the mid 1980s text files could be grouped with UNIX tools such as bundle and shar (shell archive) and included in email message bodies, allowing them to be unpacked on remote UNIX systems with a single shell command.

The COMSYS/MSGDMS system at MIT offered &quot;Enclosures&quot; beginning by 1976. Users inside COMSYS could receive the enclosure file directly. Messages sent to users out of the COMSYS world sent the enclosure as part of the message body, which was useful only for text files.

Attaching non-text files was first accomplished in 1980 by manually encoding 8-bit files using Mary Ann Horton&#x27;s uuencode, and later using BinHex or xxencode and pasting the resulting text into the body of the message. When the &quot;Attachment&quot; user interface first appeared on PCs in around 1985, it used the uuencode format for SMTP transmission, as did Microsoft Mail later.

Modern email systems use the MIME standard, making email attachments more utilitarian and seamless. This was developed by Nathaniel Borenstein and collaborator Ned Freed - with the standard being officially released as RFC2045 in 1996.

With MIME, a message and all its attachments are encapsulated in a single multipart message, with base64 encoding used to convert binary into 7-bit ASCII text - or on some modern mail servers, optionally full 8-bit support via the 8BITMIME extension.

==Size limits==
Email standards such as MIME do not specify any file size limits, but in practice email users will find that they cannot successfully send very large files across the Internet.

This is because of a number of potential limits: 
* Mail systems often arbitrarily limit the size their users are allowed to submit. 
* A message will often pass through several mail transfer agents to reach the recipient. Each of these has to store the message before forwarding it on, and may therefore also impose size limits. 
* The recipient mail system may reject incoming emails with attachments over a certain size.

The result is that while large attachments may succeed internally within a company or organization, they may not when sending across the Internet.

As an example, when Google&#x27;s Gmail service increased its arbitrary limit to 25MB it warned that: &quot;you may not be able to send larger attachments to contacts who use other email services with smaller attachment limits&quot;. 

Also note that all these size limits are based, not on the original file size, but the MIME-encoded copy. The common Base64 encoding adds about 37% to the original file size, meaning that an original 20MB file could exceed a 25MB file attachment limit.
A 10MB email size limit would require that the size of the attachment files is actually limited to about 7MB.

Users should be cautious with certain file formats when received as email attachments, such as .zip and .tgz files, because they can contain harmful viruses and potential software. .iso files can also be used to spread malware and .exe is an executable file that can become active on a computer as soon as it is opened.

==Malware==

A lot of malware is distributed via email attachments with some even considering such to be the main vector for cyberattacks on businesses. Users are advised to be extremely cautious with attachments and to not open any attachments that are not from a trusted source and expected − even if the sender is in their address book as their account might have been taken over or misused. While many email servers scan attachments for malware and block dangerous filetypes, this should not be relied upon − especially as such cannot detect zero-day exploits. 

===Dangerous file types===
Email users are typically warned that unexpected email with attachments should always be considered suspicious and dangerous, particularly if not known to be sent by a trusted source. However, in practice this advice is not enough – &quot;known trusted sources&quot; were the senders of executable programs creating mischief and mayhem as early as 1987 with the mainframe-based Christmas Tree EXEC.

Since the ILOVEYOU and Anna Kournikova worms of 2000 and 2001, email systems have increasingly added layers of protection to prevent potential malware. Now, many block certain types of attachments.

<doc id="865764" wikidata="Q5454862" url="?curid=865764" title="Fisher transformation">
<text>In statistics, the Fisher transformation (or Fisher &quot;z&quot;-transformation) of a Pearson correlation coefficient is its inverse hyperbolic tangent (artanh). 
When the sample correlation coefficient &quot;r&quot; is near 1 or -1, its distribution is highly skewed, which makes it difficult to estimate confidence intervals and apply tests of significance for the population correlation coefficient ρ. 
The Fisher transformation solves this problem by yielding a variable whose distribution is approximately normally distributed, with a variance that is stable over different values of &quot;r&quot;.

==Definition==

Given a set of &quot;N&quot; bivariate sample pairs (&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot;), &quot;i&quot; = 1, ..., &quot;N&quot;, the sample correlation coefficient &quot;r&quot; is given by

:formula_1

Here formula_2 stands for the covariance between the variables formula_3 and formula_4 and formula_5 stands for the standard deviation of the respective variable. Fisher&#x27;s z-transformation of &quot;r&quot; is defined as
:formula_6
where &quot;ln&quot; is the natural logarithm function and &quot;artanh&quot; is the inverse hyperbolic tangent function.

If (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) has a bivariate normal distribution with correlation ρ and the pairs (&quot;X&quot;&quot;i&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;&quot;i&quot;) are independent and identically distributed, then &quot;z&quot; is approximately normally distributed with mean
:formula_7
and a standard deviation which does not depend on the value of the correlation rho (i.e., a Variance-stabilizing transformation)
:formula_8
where &quot;N&quot; is the sample size, and ρ is the true correlation coefficient.

This transformation, and its inverse
:formula_9
can be used to construct a large-sample confidence interval for &quot;r&quot; using standard normal theory and derivations. See also application to partial correlation.

==Derivation==

Hotelling gives a concise derivation of the Fisher transformation.

To derive the Fisher transformation, one starts by considering an arbitrary increasing, twice-differentiable function of formula_10, say formula_11. Finding the first term in the large-formula_12 expansion of the corresponding skewness formula_13 results in
:formula_14
Setting formula_15 and solving the corresponding differential equation for formula_16 yields the inverse hyperbolic tangent formula_17 function.

Similarly expanding the mean &quot;m&quot; and variance &quot;v&quot; of formula_18, one gets
:m = formula_19
and
:v = formula_20
respectively.

The extra terms are not part of the usual Fisher transformation. For large values of formula_21 and small values of formula_12 they represent a large improvement of accuracy at minimal cost, although they greatly complicate the computation of the inverse – a closed-form expression is not available. The near-constant variance of the transformation is the result of removing its skewness – the actual improvement is achieved by the latter, not by the extra terms. Including the extra terms, i.e., computing (z-m)/v1/2, yields:
:formula_23
which has, to an excellent approximation, a standard normal distribution.
== Application ==
The application of Fisher&#x27;s transformation can be enhanced using a software calculator as shown in the figure. Assuming that the r-squared value found is 0.80, that there are 30 data , and accepting a 90% confidence interval, the r-squared value in another random sample from the same population may range from 0.656 to 0.888. When r-squared is outside this range, the population is considered to be different.

== Discussion ==

The Fisher transformation is an approximate variance-stabilizing transformation for &quot;r&quot; when &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; follow a bivariate normal distribution. This means that the variance of &quot;z&quot; is approximately constant for all values of the population correlation coefficient &quot;ρ&quot;. Without the Fisher transformation, the variance of &quot;r&quot; grows smaller as |&quot;ρ&quot;| gets closer to 1. Since the Fisher transformation is approximately the identity function when |&quot;r&quot;| &lt; 1/2, it is sometimes useful to remember that the variance of &quot;r&quot; is well approximated by 1/&quot;N&quot; as long as |&quot;ρ&quot;| is not too large and &quot;N&quot; is not too small. This is related to the fact that the asymptotic variance of &quot;r&quot; is 1 for bivariate normal data.

The behavior of this transform has been extensively studied since Fisher introduced it in 1915. Fisher himself found the exact distribution of &quot;z&quot; for data from a bivariate normal distribution in 1921; Gayen in 1951
determined the exact distribution of &quot;z&quot; for data from a bivariate Type A Edgeworth distribution. Hotelling in 1953 calculated the Taylor series expressions for the moments of &quot;z&quot; and several related statistics and Hawkins in 1989 discovered the asymptotic distribution of &quot;z&quot; for data from a distribution with bounded fourth moments.

An alternative to the Fisher transformation is to use the exact confidence distribution density for &quot;ρ&quot; given by
formula_24
where formula_25 is the Gaussian hypergeometric function and formula_26 .

==Other uses==

While the Fisher transformation is mainly associated with the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient for bivariate normal observations, it can also be applied to Spearman&#x27;s rank correlation coefficient in more general cases. A similar result for the asymptotic distribution applies, but with a minor adjustment factor: see the cited article for details.

<doc id="865767" wikidata="Q2882034" url="?curid=865767" title="In loco parentis">
<text>The term in loco parentis, Latin for &quot;in the place of a parent&quot;, refers to the legal responsibility of a person or organization to take on some of the functions and responsibilities of a parent.

Originally derived from English common law, the doctrine is applied in two separate areas of the law. First, it grants educational institutions such as colleges and schools discretion to act in the best interests of their students, although not allowing what would be considered violations of the students&#x27; civil liberties. Second, this doctrine may allow a non-biological parent to exercise the legal rights and responsibilities of a biological parent if they have held themselves out as the parent.

The &quot;in loco parentis&quot; doctrine is distinct from the doctrine of &quot;parens patriae&quot;, the psychological parent doctrine, and adoption.

==Situation specific==
===Education===
====Primary and secondary education====
Cheadle Hulme School, originally known as the Manchester Warehousemen and Clerks Orphans Schools, formed in 1855, adopted &quot;in loco parentis&quot; as its motto, well before the world&#x27;s first public education act, the Elementary Education Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 75).

The first major limitation to this came in the U.S. Supreme Court case &quot;West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette&quot; (1943), in which the court ruled that students cannot be forced to salute the American flag. More prominent change came in the 1960s and 1970s in such cases as &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District&quot; (1969), when the Supreme Court decided that &quot;conduct by the student, in class or out of it, which for any reason – whether it stems from time, place, or type of behavior – materially disrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or invasion of the rights of others is, of course, not immunized by the constitutional guarantee of freedom of speech.&quot; Adult speech is also limited by &quot;time, place and manner&quot; restrictions and therefore such limits do not rely on schools acting &quot;in loco parentis&quot;.

In &quot;Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District&quot; (1969), the Supreme Court held that for school officials to justify censoring speech, they &quot;must be able to show that [their] action was caused by something more than a mere desire to avoid the discomfort and unpleasantness that always accompany an unpopular viewpoint,&quot; allowing schools to forbid conduct that would &quot;materially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.&quot; The court found that the actions of the Tinkers in wearing armbands did not cause disruption and held that their activity represented constitutionally protected symbolic speech.

In &quot;New Jersey v. T. L. O.&quot; (1985) Justice White wrote:
The case upheld the search of a purse while on public school property based upon reasonable suspicion, indicating there is a balancing between the student&#x27;s legitimate expectation of privacy and the public school&#x27;s interest in maintaining order and discipline. However, in &quot;Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier&quot; (1987) the Supreme Court ruled that &quot;First Amendment rights of students in public schools are not automatically coextensive with the rights of adults in other settings, and must be applied in light of the special characteristics of the school environment&quot; and schools may censor school-sponsored publications (such as a school newspaper) if content is &quot;...inconsistent with its basic educational mission.&quot; Other student issues such as school dress codes along with locker, cell phone, and personal laptop computer searches by public school officials have not yet been tested in the Supreme Court.

Private institutions are given significantly more authority over their students than public ones, and are generally allowed to arbitrarily dictate rules. In the Kentucky State Supreme Court case &quot;Gott v. Berea College&quot; (1913), it was upheld that a &quot;college or university may prescribe requirements for admission and rules for the conduct of its students, and one who enters as a student implicitly agrees to conform to such rules of government&quot;, while publicly funded institutions could not claim the same ability.

In &quot;Morse v. Frederick&quot; (2007) Justice Clarence Thomas, concurring with the majority, argued that &quot;Tinker&#x27;s&quot; ruling contradicted &quot;the traditional understanding of the judiciary&#x27;s role in relation to public schooling,&quot; and ignored the history of public education. He believed the judiciary&#x27;s role to determine whether students have freedom of expression was limited by &quot;in loco parentis&quot;. He cited &quot;Lander v. Seaver&quot; (1859), which held that &quot;in loco parentis&quot; allowed schools to punish student expression that the school or teacher believed contradicted the school&#x27;s interests and educational goals. This ruling declared that the only restriction the doctrine imposed were acts of legal malice or acts that caused permanent injury. Neither of these were the case with &quot;Tinker&quot;.

====Higher education====
Though &quot;in loco parentis&quot; continues to apply to primary and secondary education in the U.S., application of the concept has largely disappeared in higher education. This was not always the case.

Prior to the 1960s, undergraduates were subject to many restrictions on their private lives. Women were generally subject to curfews as early as 10 pm, and dormitories were sex-segregated. Some universities expelled students—especially female students—who were deemed &quot;morally&quot; undesirable. More importantly, universities saw fit to restrict freedom of speech, on campus, often forbidding organizations out of favor or with different views from speaking, organizing, demonstrating, or otherwise acting on campus. These restrictions were severely criticized by the student movements of the 1960s, and the Free Speech Movement at the University of California, Berkeley formed partly on account of them, inspiring students elsewhere to step up their opposition.

The landmark 1961 case &quot;Dixon v. Alabama&quot; was the beginning of the end for &quot;in loco parentis&quot; in U.S. higher education. The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit found that Alabama State College could not summarily expel students without due process. However, that still does not prevent students who exercise their rights from being subject to legal action for violation of institutional rules.

===Hospital and nursing homes===
Caregivers and management have the duty of care in place of the parent.

In the absence of parents, another relative or person &quot;in loco parentis&quot; can give consent for children.
For children in care, the local authority usually has full parental rights and the director of social services or deputy needs to sign the consent form. If the child is in voluntary care, the parents still act as guardians and their consent should be obtained.

In law, parents have responsibility for their child. Staff have an ethical duty to ensure that the care of the child is equally good no matter the educational attainments of the parents. On rare occasions, however, physician is faced with parents whose level of literacy or understanding prevents them from properly grasping what is happening. Sometimes other members of the family may be able to act &quot;in loco parentis&quot;, and it is reassuring to have supportive grandparents who can make rational suggestions in the best interests of all concerned. Occasionally, it may be necessary to formalize this arrangement. If there is any doubt about who carries parental responsibility, or competence, the child-safeguarding team must be involved.

Indian law has provision for &quot;in loco parentis&quot;. Under Indian law non-human entities such as animals, trusts (including those established for estate planning), charitable organizations, corporations, managing bodies, etc. and several other non-human entitles have been given the status of &quot;legal person&quot; with legal rights and duties, such as to sue and be sued, to own and transfer the property, to pay taxes, etc. In court cases regarding animals, the animals have the status of &quot;legal person&quot; and humans have the legal duty to act as &quot;loco parentis&quot; towards animals welfare like a parent has towards the minor children. In a case of cow-smuggling, the Punjab and Haryana High Court mandated that &quot;entire animal kingdom including avian and aquatic&quot; species has a &quot;distinct legal persona with corresponding rights, duties, and liabilities of a living person&quot; and humans are &quot;loco parentis&quot; while laying out the norms for animal welfare, veterinary treatment, fodder and shelter, e.g. animal drawn carriages must not have more than four humans, and load carrying animals must not be loaded beyond the specified limits and those limits must be halved when animals have to carry the load up a slope.

<doc id="865768" wikidata="Q6763590" url="?curid=865768" title="Marilyn Milian">
<text>Marilyn Milian (born May 1, 1961), known professionally as Judge Milian, is an American television personality, lecturer, retired Florida Circuit Court judge and court-show arbitrator. For 22 seasons from March 12, 2001 to July 21, 2023, Milian starred in the American courtroom television series &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;, replacing Jerry Sheindlin. &quot;Justice for the People with Judge Milian&quot;, another arbitration-based reality court show, premiered in the fall of 2023. The show follows suit of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; in which she handles legal disputes. 

Milian is the first Hispanic arbitrator to preside over a court show and during &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;&#x27;s 2012–2013 season she became the show&#x27;s longest-serving judge, surpassing Joseph Wapner, the show&#x27;s inaugural jurist.

==Early life==

Milian was born in Manhattan to Cuban parents Jorge, a general contractor, and Georgina Milian. She spoke Spanish before learning English and is fluent in both languages. The family moved from Astoria, Queens, to Miami when she was eight years old. She graduated from St. Brendan High School.

Milian earned her undergraduate degree in psychology from the University of Miami. She then attended Georgetown University Law Center, earning her J.D. She spent a year working at Harvard Law School, where she served as director of training for the Guatemala Project. She was responsible for training the Guatemalan trial judiciary, defense, and prosecution bar in investigatory and trial techniques.

==Career==

===Legal career===

Milian was appointed assistant state attorney for the Dade County State Attorney&#x27;s Office by Janet Reno, who was then the county&#x27;s state attorney. After ten years in that position, she then worked for the Miami County Court, serving in the domestic violence, criminal, and civil divisions. In 1999, Florida governor Jeb Bush appointed Milian to the Miami Circuit Court, where she served in the Criminal Division. In 2001, she replaced Jerry Sheindlin as judge of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court,&quot; and became the first Hispanic judge on any English-language television court show. Milian has listed as an adjunct faculty member of the University of Miami School of Law, teaching litigation skills.

===&quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;===

Milian served as presiding judge in the second life of the courtroom show &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;, the first arbitration-based reality court show and the second-longest running court show in history. Milian presided over the program from the spring of 2001, which was late in &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;″s 17th season (or the fourth season of the revived version of the show), to the end of the 2022-23 season.

&quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; has featured several arbitrators, with Milian currently holding the title of the longest-presiding arbitrator over the series. By the completion of the show&#x27;s 28th season (2012–13), Milian had completed twelve and a half seasons presiding over the program, officially making her the longest-running judge on &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;. The late Joseph Wapner, the show&#x27;s original judge, was the previous holder of this record. By the spring of 2021, she reached 20 years as presiding judge over the program.

In contrast to &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;″s previous arbiters, Milian is considerably more animated in her role, but she&#x27;s also known for being levelheaded and logical in her observations and handling of the cases. Although engaging for the most part, Milian also dishes out a good-natured, lively sass at the litigants and does not tolerate any disrespect from them.

Milian explains Americans&#x27; fascination with the court show genre: &quot;We are a fast-food nation. People love to see resolution, they want to watch someone who has done wrong confronted and see justice prevail … all in an hour.&quot;

Milian was portrayed by Cecily Strong in a 2017 &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; parody of &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot; where she presided over a case between President Donald Trump and three judges of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

===&quot;Justice for the People with Judge Milian&quot;===
In April 2023, it was reported that Allen Media Group had signed Milian to a new show, &quot;Justice for the People with Judge Milian&quot;, the show premiered in syndication fall 2023.

==Personal life==
Milian is married to John Schlesinger, a former assistant United States attorney who was elected to the 11th Judicial Circuit Court for Miami-Dade County, Florida, the same position that Milian held before retiring to host &quot;The People&#x27;s Court&quot;. They live in Coral Gables, Florida with their three children. 

Milian is the spokesman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation&#x27;s Safe Online Surfing (FBI-SOS) campaign. In 2019, she appeared on the daytime version of &quot;Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?&quot;, winning $5,000 for Camp Fiesta, a Florida summer camp free for children with cancer.

<text>The 61st Street–Woodside station (announced as the Woodside–61st Street station on trains) is an express station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway located at 61st Street and Roosevelt Avenue in Woodside, Queens. It is served by the 7 train, with additional peak-direction &lt;7&gt; service during rush hours.

61st Street–Woodside opened on April 21, 1917 as Woodside, as part of an extension of the IRT Flushing Line. Following a period of neglect, it was renovated in the early 2020s.

==History==

=== Early history ===
The 1913 Dual Contracts called for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) to build new lines in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Queens did not receive many new IRT and BRT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city&#x27;s Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding in the other two boroughs first before building in Queens, which was relatively undeveloped. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, along with the Astoria Line; it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens&#x27;s oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of the line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.

61st Street–Woodside opened on April 21, 1917 as Woodside, as part of an extension of the IRT Flushing Line to Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street–Corona Plaza). The Long Island Rail Road station predates the station, as it originally opened in 1869.

On February 29, 1928, five petitions signed with 600 names were sent to the New York State Transit Commission (NYSTC), requesting that an escalator be constructed at the station to the southeastern corner of 61st Street and Roosevelt Avenue. On July 25, the NYSTC ordered the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) to install a double-width escalator from the mezzanine to that corner, similar to one at the Third Avenue entrance at Grand Central station on the same line. The new escalator was placed into service on December 27, 1930.

=== Later years ===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. On October 17, 1949, the joint BMT/IRT operation of the Flushing Line ended, and the line became the responsibility of the IRT. After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the station were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars. With the opening of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, trains were lengthened to eleven cars.

In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. Although the adjacent LIRR station was renovated in the 1990s, the subway station remained in poor shape. By the late 2010s, the 61st Street station was in poor condition; one newspaper reported that the station had issues with falling debris, rust, and peeling paint. The escalator leading up from 61st Street to the mezzanine, which had been installed around 2000, was one of the least reliable escalators in any subway station in Queens.

As part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program, the MTA announced plans to renovate the 52nd, 61st, 69th, 82nd, 103rd and 111th Streets stations, a project that had been delayed for several years. Conditions at these stations were reported to be among the worst of all stations in the subway system. Work on the 61st Street station included ADA upgrades; track, staircase, and platform replacement; and structural and waterproofing improvements. The Manhattan-bound platform at the 61st Street–Woodside station will close for renovation starting fall 2024, followed by the closure of the Flushing-bound platform. Throughout construction, trains in both directions will continue to stop at the station, and express service would only run between 74th Street - Broadway and Mets - Willets Point. A separate contract was awarded to Skanska-Railroad JV to further improve structural conditions in the station; work began in early 2023.

==Station layout==

This station has two island platforms and three tracks. The two outer tracks are used for the full-time local service while the bidirectional center track typically is used for rush hour peak-direction &lt;7&gt; express service, but the center track is closed. There is a mezzanine located at the center, underneath the platforms, with an ADA-accessible elevator to each platform, as well as another to each Long Island Rail Road platform. The elevator from the mezzanine to the street stops at the LIRR&#x27;s eastbound Main Line platform.

The station is about above street level, and is located above a natural depression in ground level along Roosevelt Avenue.

Artwork includes John Cavanagh&#x27;s &quot;Commuting/Community&quot; (1986), located near the stairway down to LIRR Track 4, and Dimitri Gerakaris&#x27;s &quot;Woodside Continuum&quot; (1999), which forms part of the steel-grating fare-control separation.

===Exits===
Entrance and exit are provided by long stairs down to street level on the northern curb of Roosevelt Avenue at 61st Street, as well as to other nearby locations via the LIRR platforms. An ADA-compliant elevator provides access to street level at the northeast corner of 61st Street and Roosevelt Avenue, while a long escalator at the southeast corner provides entrance only. The Woodside station of the Long Island Rail Road is located directly beneath the Flushing Line station; any of the three LIRR platforms can be accessed directly from the mezzanine.

== Political positions ==
In 2020, Záborská proposed an anti-abortion bill to the National Council of the Slovak Republic, however, it did not pass.

In 2021, she voted to pass a proposal to amend the constitution, which would tie one&#x27;s legal sex to that assigned at birth, effectively prohibiting transgender people from changing their legal sex. The bill would also amend the constitution to say that &quot;parents are a father - a man, and a mother - a woman.&quot;

<doc id="865774" wikidata="Q751675" url="?curid=865774" title="Newry and Armagh (UK Parliament constituency)">
<text>Newry and Armagh is a parliamentary constituency in the United Kingdom House of Commons. The current MP is Dáire Hughes of Sinn Féin who was first elected at the 2024 election.

==Boundaries==

1983–1997: The District of Armagh, and the District of Newry and Mourne wards of Ballybot, Belleek, Bessbrook, Camlough, Creggan, Crossmaglen, Daisy Hill, Derrymore, Drumalane, Drumgullion, Fathom, Forkhill, Newtownhamilton, St Mary&#x27;s, St Patrick&#x27;s, Tullyhappy, and Windsor Hill.

1997–present: The District of Armagh, and the District of Newry and Mourne wards of Ballybot, Bessbrook, Camlough, Creggan, Crossmaglen, Daisy Hill, Derrymore, Drumgullion, Drumalane, Fathom, Forkhill, Newtownhamilton, Silver Bridge, St Mary&#x27;s, St Patrick&#x27;s, Tullyhappy, and Windsor Hill.

The seat was created in boundary changes in 1983, as part of an expansion of Northern Ireland&#x27;s constituencies from 12 to 17, and was predominantly made up from the old Armagh constituency with the addition of Newry town from the old South Down constituency. In 1995, the Boundary Commission originally proposed to abolish the seat with the Armagh district joining most of Dungannon in a new &#x27;Blackwater&#x27; constituency with the rest becoming part of a new Newry and Mourne constituency. This was strongly opposed during the local enquiries and the eventual boundary review did not implement it. The constituency contains the entirety of the former Armagh district and the Newry half of the former Newry and Mourne district.

==History==
For the history of the equivalent constituency prior to 1983, please see Armagh.

The constituency is majority nationalist, though initially on its creation in 1983 Jim Nicholson of the Ulster Unionist Party won the seat due to the nationalist vote being divided between the Social Democratic and Labour Party and Sinn Féin. In 1986 Nicholson, along with all the other unionist MPs, resigned his seat in protest over the Anglo-Irish Agreement and stood in a by-election to provide voters the opportunity to decide on it. However the nationalist parties contested the seat and Seamus Mallon of the SDLP gained sufficient votes to outpoll Nicholson and win the seat. Mallon held it until his retirement in 2005.

The main attention has been upon the rise of the Sinn Féin vote. In the 2001 election they surged forward, cutting Mallon&#x27;s majority drastically, as well as heavily outpolling the SDLP in the equivalent area local elections held on the same day. Then in the 2003 Assembly election Sinn Féin won three seats to the SDLP&#x27;s one. Mallon stood down at the 2005 general election fearing the loss of his seat as was widely predicted among political pundits, the seat subsequently fell to Sinn Féin with Murphy out polling the SDLP by almost 8000 votes.

Newry is overwhelmingly nationalist, and was one of two districts in Northern Ireland to return a numerical majority of people identifying themselves as &quot;Irish&quot; at the 2011 census at 52.1% Irish.
Armagh is more unionist, though it does have a larger proportion of people identifying as &quot;Irish&quot; in comparison to the Northern Ireland average at 44.4% &quot;British&quot; 32.4% &quot;Irish&quot;.

==Members of Parliament==
The Member of Parliament since the 2024 general election is Dáire Hughes of Sinn Féin.

Consisting of eight decks, including a private owners&#x27; deck, &quot;Octopus&quot; can host up to 26 guests accommodated in 13 staterooms and is crewed by a complement of 63 spread across 30 cabins. Entertainment facilities include several bars, a spa, library, cinema, gym, basketball court and multiple lounges including a forward-facing observation area. It has two helicopter pads on the main deck: a twin pad and hangars at the stern and a single pad on the bow; and a tender docked in the transom and a landing craft. There are a total of seven tenders aboard. The yacht also has a pool, located aft on one of its upper decks, and two submarines (one of them operated by remote control and capable of attaining greater depths). The latter was lent to Google Earth for the &quot;Explore the Ocean&quot; project. Side hatches at the water line form a dock for personal watercraft. At an economical cruising speed of 12.5 knots, &quot;Octopus&quot; has a range of 12,500 nmi.

== History ==
Allen loaned &quot;Octopus&quot;, which is equipped with a submarine and ROV, for a variety of rescue and research operations. These include assisting in a hunt for an American pilot and two officers whose plane disappeared off Palau, and loaning his yacht to scientists to study the coelacanth, a &quot;living fossil&quot; that was once believed to be extinct.

In January 2011, while en route to Antarctica, one of its helicopters was forced to make an emergency landing in the waters off the coast of Argentina. While the helicopter was severely damaged, there was no loss of life, with only the co-pilot suffering minor injuries. Allen was not aboard at the time.

In 2012, he loaned the ship to the Royal Navy in their attempt to retrieve the ship&#x27;s bell from the , which sank to a depth of in the Denmark Strait during World War II, as a national memorial. HMS &quot;Hood&quot; was hit by a shell from the ; its magazines exploded and the ship sank in minutes with a loss of over 1,400 lives. The bell was located but not recovered, due to adverse weather conditions. On August 7, 2015 it was announced that the bell from HMS &quot;Hood&quot; had been recovered by the ROV operating from &quot;Octopus&quot;. After conservation, the bell was put on display in 2016 at the National Museum of the Royal Navy, Portsmouth.

In March 2015, an Allen-led research team announced that it had found the Japanese battleship in the Sibuyan Sea off the coast of the Philippines. Armed with main guns and displacing at full load, &quot;Musashi&quot; and its sister ship were the largest and most heavily armed battleships in naval history.

Allen died in 2018. From December 2018 to July 2019, the yacht underwent a refit at Blohm+Voss and was advertised for sale in September 2019 with an asking price of €295 million. The asking price was later reduced to €235 million and the yacht was sold to an anonymous buyer in 2021.
Later on, the buyer was announced by insideryachtfan.com to be the Swedish &quot;pharma billionaire&quot; .

<text>The Queensboro Plaza station (originally named the Queensboro Bridge Plaza station or simply Bridge Plaza station) is an elevated New York City Subway station at Queens Plaza (originally called Queensboro Bridge Plaza or simply Bridge Plaza) in the Long Island City neighborhood of Queens. It is near the east end of the Queensboro Bridge, with Queens Boulevard running east from the plaza. The station is served by the 7 and N trains at all times, the W train on weekdays, and the &lt;7&gt; train rush hours in the peak direction.

Queensboro Plaza was originally built in 1916–1917 as part of the Dual Contracts between New York City and the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT) and the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT). The station initially had eight tracks to allow BMT and IRT passengers to transfer between the Astoria, Flushing, and Second Avenue elevated lines. The northern section of the station was closed in the late 1940s and demolished in 1964. Queensboro Plaza now contains only four tracks: two each for the IRT Flushing Line () and the BMT Astoria Line ().

Today, Queensboro Plaza is the only station in the entire system to provide cross-platform transfers between &quot;A&quot; Division () and &quot;B&quot; Division () trains. While the station is near the Queens Plaza underground subway station, which serves the IND Queens Boulevard Line, the two stations are separate and do not offer free transfers. West of the station, the Astoria Line descends into the 60th Street Tunnel under the East River into Manhattan, while the Flushing Line turns south before descending into the Steinway Tunnel past Court Square.

== History ==

=== Dual Contracts ===

==== Construction ====


The New York Public Service Commission adopted plans for what was known as the Broadway–Lexington Avenue route (later the Broadway Line) in Manhattan on December 31, 1907. A proposed Tri-borough system was adopted in early 1908. Operation of Manhattan&#x27;s Broadway Line was assigned to the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT, subsequently the Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation or BMT) in the Dual Contracts, adopted on March 4, 1913. The Dual Contracts also included opening the Steinway Tunnel, an incomplete tunnel between the New York City boroughs of Manhattan and Queens. The Steinway Tunnel would be operated by the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT).

The Dual Contracts negotiations had been intricate and sometimes fractious. The IRT had initially been loath to let the BRT operate its Broadway Line through Midtown Manhattan, but relented when negotiators offered the BRT all of the proposed lines in the planned dual system. In Queens, which heretofore had no subway service, two lines had been proposed, both extending from an interchange station (later Queensboro Plaza) in Long Island City. The shorter Astoria Line would run to Astoria in northwestern Queens, while the longer Flushing Line would be built initially to Corona, and eventually to Flushing, in north-central Queens. As part of the Dual Contracts, the IRT was given ownership of both lines, but the BRT was given trackage rights over the routes, allowing both companies to share revenue from their Queens operations.

The Snare &amp; Triest Construction Company was hired to construct the station for $884,859. The firm employed an average of 114 workers for each day. The Queensboro Plaza station was built as an eight-track station, with four tracks across each of two levels. Each company took two tracks on each level; the BRT took the two northernmost tracks, while the IRT took the two southernmost tracks. The lower level was for trains to Manhattan, while the upper level was for trains to Astoria or Corona (and later Flushing). By September 1915, the station was nearly 75 percent complete.

==== Operation ====
The southern half of the station opened on November 16, 1916, followed by the northern half of the station on February 1, 1917. In general, BRT trains were wider and longer than those on the IRT, and the Queens lines were built so that they could only fit the narrower IRT trains. The IRT had direct service into Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel, as well as via the Queensboro Bridge to the Second Avenue elevated line. However, BRT trains from the 60th Street Tunnel and the Broadway Line in Manhattan could not run north or east of Queensboro Plaza, as they were wider. Consequently, BRT trains from Manhattan had to terminate on the northern side of the station, where cross-platform interchanges were available to narrower BRT shuttle trains that could run in Queens.

The city government took over the BMT&#x27;s operations on June 1, 1940, and the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. Second Avenue elevated service ceased on June 13, 1942.

The service on the Flushing and Astoria lines east of Queensboro Plaza was shared by the IRT and BMT until 1949. BMT trains on the Flushing Line were designated 9, while IRT services on that line were designated 7 on maps only. BMT and IRT trains on the Astoria Line were both designated 8. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7.

=== Service changes and station modifications ===

==== 1940s to 1960s ====
On October 17, 1949, the $1.375 million renovation of the station was completed which allowed the rerouting of trains between Manhattan and Queens. As part of the project, the Astoria Line platforms were shaved back to allow BMT service to operate through to 60th Street, and new connections were built between the 60th Street Tunnel approach and the west tracks at the east (former IRT) platforms, and the west (former BMT) platforms were closed. Once the project was completed, the IRT started using the Flushing Line only and the BMT started using the Astoria Line only. With the station&#x27;s renovation, it became easier for passengers to transfer between the IRT and BMT lines. Instead of having to climb between the upper and lower level platforms, passengers were able to use cross-platform transfers. There was a crossover just west of the station which allowed the Astoria trains to access the Steinway tunnels. This was removed directly after the joint operation ceased in 1949. Much of the mezzanine was rebuilt as part of the project, including the pedestrian bridges leading to either side of Queens Plaza. On the north side of the lower level, a new window wall was constructed.

After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the BMT&#x27;s Astoria Shuttle was replaced with service from the 2 Fourth Avenue Line (later the RR train, then the R train), operating from Astoria–Ditmars Boulevard to Bay Ridge–95th Street in Brooklyn; additional service was provided part-time by the 1 train (Brighton Express) and later the QT and QB trains (Brighton Local) and the T (West End Express). the New York City Board of Transportation announced that platforms on the Flushing Line would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths. With the exception of the Queensboro Plaza station, which was already long, the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the other Flushing Line stations were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars. With the opening of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, trains were lengthened to eleven cars.

In 1960, the city&#x27;s Department of Traffic proposed demolishing the abandoned northern half of the Queensboro Plaza station to improve traffic flow. The abandoned structure was demolished in 1964. As part of the project, an overpass was constructed from the station towards Queens Plaza North, spanning the site of the demolished platforms. One set of crossovers between the BMT and IRT lines remains on the upper level; this is the Flushing Line&#x27;s only track connection to the rest of the system.

==== 1970s to 1990s ====
During the first half of the 1970s, annual ridership at the station dropped 17 percent to 2.344 million by 1975. The subway system&#x27;s operator, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), allocated funding for the installation of reversible escalators in 1975 as part of the MTA&#x27;s six-year capital plan. The New York City Department of City Planning proposed renovating the Queensboro Plaza station in 1979 as part of a $170 million project. The station would have been connected to the Queens Plaza station of the IND Queens Boulevard Line, as well as the proposed Northern Boulevard station on the 63rd Street Line, as part of the 63rd Street subway project. The project would have also included a new bus terminal, access to a parking garage, and a pedestrian mall on the north side of Northern Boulevard. The proposal was intended to attract business to the Queens Plaza area. Ultimately, the 63rd Street Line was constructed only as far as 21st Street–Queensbridge with no connections to the stations at Queens Plaza.

In 1981, the MTA listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. A renovation of the Queensboro Plaza station were funded as part of the MTA&#x27;s 1980–1984 capital plan. The station was repainted in 1986. In addition, as part of an initiative called Creative Station, colorful nylon banners were installed on the viaducts next to the station for $15,000. The R train&#x27;s northern terminal was swapped with that of the N in 1987, so the N went to Ditmars Boulevard (serving Queensboro Plaza) and the R went to 71st Avenue.

In April 1993, the New York State Legislature agreed to give the MTA $9.6 billion for capital improvements. Some of the funds would be used to renovate nearly one hundred New York City Subway stations, including Queensboro Plaza. The contract for the project&#x27;s design was awarded in May 1994. Work on the renovation began in early 1998, at which point the project was expected to last four years. The W train started serving the Astoria Line, including the Queensboro Plaza station, in 2001. The W was discontinued in June 2010 and replaced with the Q until November 2016, when the W was restored.

====Elevator installation====
In 2018, it was announced that the Queensboro Plaza station may receive elevators as part of a process to expand the New York City Subway system&#x27;s accessibility. , funding had been committed to accessibility renovations at the Queensboro Plaza station. Accessibility improvements at Queensboro Plaza were approved in December 2021, and the MTA began preliminary work shortly afterward. The work involved installing a new elevator from the south side of Queens Plaza to the mezzanine and a second elevator from the mezzanine to the platforms. In addition, the mezzanine was extended east to accommodate the elevator connecting the mezzanine and the platforms, and the overpass to the northern exit was widened. To accommodate the new elevator, the southbound platform was closed for two weeks and partially rebuilt in August 2023. The project also involved the installation of new platform edges with ADA boarding areas, an ADA ramp at mezzanine level, additional digital information screens, and new CCTV and public address systems. The elevators opened on December 12, 2024; the entire project was budgeted at $74 million.

In February 2022, developer Grubb Properties filed plans for a 26-story apartment tower at 25–01 Queens Plaza North. The project will include a third elevator, running between the north side of Queens Plaza and the mezzanine.

== Station layout ==
This two-level station has two island platforms (one on each level) and four tracks. It stands over the south (railroad east) side of the roadway, but formerly spanned the whole plaza. Trains running into Queens stop on the upper level and Manhattan-bound trains below. On both levels, the BMT Astoria Line (which to the south joins with the 60th Street Tunnel Connection and heads through the 60th Street Tunnel to the BMT Broadway Line) uses the north track and the IRT Flushing Line uses the south track.

In 2014, the station was renovated by NYCTA employees (as opposed to an outside contractor). A computer assisted tower was installed on the south end, as part of the IRT Flushing Line automation.

===Track layout===

In the original configuration, the station had eight tracks: four on each level. The station was long in total. Originally, the IRT used both sides of the current platforms, and the BMT used now-demolished platforms north of the current platforms, also double-decked. The south side of the IRT platforms was used by the Flushing Line, as today. The north side was used by Astoria trains, but instead of going through the 60th Street Tunnel, they went over the Queensboro Bridge to the elevated IRT Second Avenue Line. Double crossovers south (lower tracks) and north (upper tracks) of the platforms allowed trains from either side to switch to the other line after leaving the station.

At the BMT half, the south track served subway trains to Manhattan and the BMT Broadway Line. By 1924, trains came from Manhattan on the upper level, continued north to a merge with the lower level, and then returned via the lower level. Before that, trains reversed direction using a double crossover south of the platforms. Since the platforms were IRT-size, the BMT used its own elevated cars to provide service on the lines, with a required transfer at Queensboro Plaza. Shuttles from Astoria came in on the west side lower track and then reversed direction to head to Flushing; Flushing trains came in on the upper track and reversed direction towards Astoria.

During the early period of dual service on the Astoria and Flushing portions, IRT and BMT trains had their own stopping marks on the platforms and the sections of the platforms were separated. Passengers had separate entrances to the platforms depending on which service they wanted. This set-up prevented free transfers between the trains of the two companies. This arrangement had to end when the IRT lengthened trains. The two companies worked out an agreement in which the revenue collected on those stations was shared.

After 1949, the track layout around the station was greatly simplified. Only the original southern side of the Queensboro Plaza station remains in service, with two tracks on each level. Queens-bound trains use the upper level, while Manhattan-bound trains use the lower level. BMT trains use the northern tracks on each level and IRT trains use the southern tracks. A double crossover remains on the upper level. This connection is used for non-revenue moves, specifically to transfer subway cars to the Coney Island Shops for repairs, or to move rolling stock to or from the Flushing Line.

===Exits===
The station&#x27;s only exits are through a mezzanine located below the lower level (and formerly connected to the now torn-down BMT platforms to the west). From the mezzanine, there is a concrete footbridge across Queens Plaza North to the second floor of a building. There is also an overpass leading to Queens Plaza South.
== In popular culture ==

Queensboro Plaza is featured in a defining moment in the film &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes&quot;. The protagonist astronaut (&quot;Brent&quot;) unknowingly enters the ruins of an underground station; upon seeing the words &quot;Queensboro Plaza&quot; in tiles, and finding an advertisement for the New York Summer Festival, he realizes that he is indeed on Earth and not another planet, and that New York City has been destroyed in a nuclear war. In reality, Queensboro Plaza is an elevated station and has no tilework.

The station is also featured in the &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode entitled &quot;The Cigar Store Indian&quot;, as the location of a renowned gyro stall, and again incorrectly depicted as an underground station, on an IRT Lexington Avenue Line train.

The station is also incorrectly depicted as an underground station in an episode of &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;.

The station and nearby MetLife Plaza were a regular CG composite as location shots between scenes in ABC series &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;.

The station also appears briefly in the season 2 opening sequence of HBO political drama &quot;The Newsroom&quot;.

The station is also shown in the TV show &quot;The King of Queens&quot;″s theme song, which shows a Redbird 7 train entering the station&#x27;s upper level.

The station also appears on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in a looking for triangles film with Maria (Sonia Manzano).

A shot of the station appears in the 2020 Pixar movie &quot;Soul.&quot;

<text>William Sanford Evans (December 18, 1869 – June 27, 1949) was a Manitoba politician. Between 1933 and 1936, he was the leader of that province&#x27;s Conservative Party caucus.

Evans was born in Spencerville, Ontario, the son of Rev. J.S. Evans and Mary Jane Vaux. He was educated at the Collegiate Institute in Hamilton, Ontario, Victoria University and Columbia University. He subsequently moved to Manitoba.

Evans was active in the publishing industry of his new province, founding the &quot;Winnipeg Telegram&quot; and writing a book on Canadian Imperialism during the Second Boer War. In 1920, he co-founded a publishing firm specializing in grain industry news. He married Mary Irene Gurney, a noted pianist, in 1900.

Evans ran for the federal Conservatives in Winnipeg in 1904, but was defeated by Liberal David Bole. He was elected Mayor of Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1909, and served in that position until 1911.

Evans was first elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1922, leading the Conservative party list in Winnipeg (which elected ten MLAs through preferential balloting). He was re-elected in 1927 and 1932, topping the Winnipeg ballot on the latter occasion. Evans was chosen as Conservative party parliamentary leader following the resignation of Col. Fawcett Taylor in 1933. He did not run against Errick F. Willis for the party leadership in 1936 and did not run for reelection in the provincial election which followed.

In 1931, while still serving in the Manitoba legislature, Evans was appointed by British Columbia Premier Simon F. Tolmie to head a commission investigating that province&#x27;s fruit-growing cooperatives. The commission&#x27;s report recommended a return to open competition and was opposed by many within the industry.

He was president of the first Canadian Club, formed in Hamilton, and helped form the Canadian Club of Winnipeg, also serving as its president.

Evans continued to publish grain industry news following his retirement from parliament. He died in 1949.

Notably, Evans&#x27;s brother Harry M.E. Evans served as Mayor of Edmonton, Alberta. As well, Evans&#x27;s son Gurney Evans served as a cabinet minister in the governments of Dufferin Roblin and Walter Weir in Manitoba.

<text>Andrew Taylor (born 14 October 1951) is a British author best known for his crime and historical novels, which include the Lydmouth series, the Roth Trilogy and historical novels such as the number-one best-selling &quot;The American Boy&quot; and &quot;The Ashes of London&quot;. His accolades include the Diamond Dagger, Britain&#x27;s top crime-writing award.

==Biography==
Andrew Taylor grew up in East Anglia. He read English at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and has an MA in Library, Archive and Information Science from University College London.

His first novel, &quot;Caroline Minuscule&quot; (1982), won the John Creasey Memorial Award of the Crime Writers&#x27; Association of Great Britain. He is the only author to have won the CWA&#x27;s Historical Dagger three times, with &quot;The Office of the Dead&quot;, &quot;The American Boy&quot; and &quot;The Scent of Death&quot;. He has also won the Cartier Diamond Dagger, for sustained excellence in crime writing and has been shortlisted for the Gold Dagger, the Theakston&#x27;s Old Peculiar (twice), and the Edgar award. &quot;Bleeding Heart Square&quot; won Sweden&#x27;s Martin Beck Award, the Golden Crowbar, in 2009. &quot;The King&#x27;s Evil&quot; won the Gold Crown for the best historical novel of the year. He was inducted into The Detection Club in 1995.

&quot;The American Boy&quot;, a gothic mystery linked to Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s boyhood years in England, was one of the ten titles featured in Channel 4&#x27;s Richard and Judy Book Club 2005 and was also selected for The Times Top Ten Crime Novels of the Decade.

The Roth Trilogy (now also available in an omnibus edition as &quot;Requiem for an Angel&quot;) was shown on ITV in March 2007. It was a three-part drama series under the title of &quot;Fallen Angel&quot;, starring Charles Dance and Emilia Fox. The series was broadcast on three consecutive nights, beginning 11 March 2007.

His most recent books are historical novels as well as crime fiction. They explore different historical eras: &quot;Bleeding Heart Square&quot;, is set in the 1930s mainly in London (2008); &quot;The Anatomy of Ghosts&quot; (2010), set in eighteenth-century Cambridge; &quot;The Scent of Death&quot;, set in British New York, 1778–80; and its sequel, &quot;The Silent Boy&quot; (2014), during the French Revolution.

&quot;The Ashes of London&quot; (2016) is set during and just after the Great Fire of 1666. It is the first of a series set in Restoration England. The paperback edition was made Waterstone&#x27;s thriller of the month for two consecutive months through January and February 2017 and was the number one bestseller for eight weeks in The Times/Waterstones chart. In 2018 he published a sequel- &quot;The Fire Court&quot;, and the third of the series, &quot;The King&#x27;s Evil&quot;, was released in March 2019. The series continued with &quot;The Last Protector&quot; (2020), &quot;The Royal Secret&quot; (2021) and &quot;The Shadows of London&quot; (2023).

Andrew Taylor has also written a number of novellas with ghostly or other-worldly themes, originally as Kindle Singles. Three have been collected under the title &quot;Fireside Gothic&quot; (2016).

He has reviewed in many publications, in particular the &quot;Spectator&quot; (whose crime fiction reviewer he was for ten years) and &quot;The Times&quot;. He has also written short stories and articles on crime fiction. He has contributed the Grub Street column to &quot;The Author&quot;, the journal of the Society of Authors 2003-21. He edited The Author 2004-06. He has also taught fiction courses for the Arvon Foundation and elsewhere.

He is married with two children. He and his family have lived for many years in Coleford in the Forest of Dean on the borders of England and Wales.

<text>Raymond J. Bishop (January 15, 1906 – February 19, 1978) was a Catholic priest who was one of the several involved in the case of exorcising a boy in Maryland, who allegedly was possessed after using a ouija board. The case inspired author William Peter Blatty to write his 1971 novel &quot;The Exorcist&quot;.

==Life==
In 1949, Father Bishop taught at Saint Louis University, where one of his female students asked for help concerning her 13-year-old cousin (for reasons of anonymity referred to by the pseudonym Robbie Mannheim), who she said had been experiencing supernatural attacks after playing with a ouija board, and who had gone through one unsuccessful exorcism. Bishop contacted his close friend, Father William S. Bowdern, and they performed another exorcism on the boy.

In the 1950s, Bishop was sent to Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska, where he taught for more than 20 years. He died on February 19, 1978, in Nebraska.

<text>Danny Hellman (born August 2, 1964) is an American freelance illustrator and cartoonist. Since 1989, his illustrations have appeared in publications including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; and others, and his comic book work has appeared in DC Comics publications.

==Early life==
Danny Hellman was raised in the Jackson Heights neighborhood of Queens, New York City, New York. He graduated from the High School of Art &amp; Design, in Manhattan, in 1982, and took figure drawing classes throughout the 1980s at the Art Students League. After teaming with Bill Mantlo, a veteran comic book writer, on a presentation for a comic based on the &quot;&quot; arcade video game, and being told by editor-in-chief Tom DeFalco that Hellman&#x27;s artwork was not yet professional quality, Hellman briefly attended the School of Visual Arts. He soon dropped out and began working as a bicycle messenger, while drawing and distributing posters for the rock music band Floor Kiss.

==Career==
Danny Hellman&#x27;s career began in 1988. Hellman, then a self-described &quot;stoner&quot; who lived in his grandparents&#x27; attic in Queens, followed illustrator friends in getting freelance work from Kevin Hein, art director of the weekly New York City pornographic newspaper &quot;Screw&quot;. Hellman showed Hein a portfolio of his rock posters, and a modified version of one became Hellman&#x27;s first &quot;Screw&quot; cover. He continued to contribute cover art to the magazine on a regular basis, and provide occasional interior comic-strip work parodying the likes of Superman, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;, until &quot;Screw&quot; ceased publication in 2006.

In the early 1990s, Hellman went on to illustrate for art director Michael Gentile at &quot;New York Press&quot; — later continuing with Gentile with the art director moved to &quot;Habitat&quot; — and the local periodicals &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, and &quot;Guitar World&quot;. Hellman eventually drew for national publications including &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Fortune&quot;, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, and &quot;FHM&quot;.

Hellman&#x27;s earliest recorded credit is penciling and inking writer Dennis Eichhorn&#x27;s two-page autobiographical story &quot;Iron Denny&quot; in Starhead Comix&#x27;s &quot;Real Schmuck&quot; #4 (April 1993).

In the early to mid 1990s, Hellman self-published a number of minicomics, which included &quot;Coffee Drinkin&#x27; Man&quot;, (written by Hellman&#x27;s friend, East Village painter Geoff Gilmore); the original version of &quot;Legal Action Comics&quot;, which reprinted strips of his from &quot;Screw&quot; that parodied Superman, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;; and &quot;Peaceful Atom and the Mystery Mice&quot;.

He went on to draw comics for a variety of alternative comics publishers, as well as an Aquaman story for DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Bizarro World&quot;, and several one-page strips for &quot;The Big Book of&quot; series of trade paperbacks for the DC imprint Paradox Press. Other comics work includes &quot;Hotwire&quot;, &quot;Mad&quot;, &quot;Last Gasp Comics &amp; Stories&quot; #1-5 (1994–1997), and Fantagraphics&#x27; &quot;Spicecapades&quot; (Spring 1999).

==Ted Rall lawsuit==
Hellman has been described as a &quot;veteran prankster&quot;. Following an August 3, 1999 &quot;Village Voice&quot; cover story criticizing &quot;Maus&quot; author Art Spiegelman by editorial cartoonist Ted Rall, Hellman created an email list called &quot;Rallsballs@onelist.com&quot; and sent a satirically self-agrandizing letter entitled &quot;Ted Rall&#x27;s Balls&quot;, impersonating Rall, to at least 35 cartoonists and editors, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Rall filed a lawsuit, claiming among other things, libel, lost employment opportunities and emotional distress, and asking damages of US$ 1.5 million. Eventually four of Rall&#x27;s five claims were dismissed, leaving only libel per se. The case had still not gone to trial in 2005, when Rall&#x27;s attorney died.

To defray legal costs, Hellman published two charity anthologies designed to raise funds. What was to be a third issue became the summer anthology &quot;Typhon&quot;.

<doc id="865800" wikidata="Q2982982" url="?curid=865800" title="The No WTO Combo">
<text>The No WTO Combo was a one-shot punk rock band started by Krist Novoselic (former Nirvana bassist). The band consisted of Jello Biafra (former frontman of Dead Kennedys); guitarist Kim Thayil of Soundgarden; and the rhythm section of Sweet 75, with Gina Mainwal on drums and Novoselic on bass.

They were originally scheduled to play the Showbox November 30, the night before the WTO meeting of 1999 in Seattle, but the performance was canceled because the venue&#x27;s staff could not get past the police &quot;curfew zone.&quot;

They rescheduled the show for the next night, December 1, but Biafra and Novoselic played a short acoustic set that night down the street at The Central Tavern, where Biafra was approached by local record producer Mark Cavener. Cavener offered to record the album at the Showbox the next evening. The performance itself would be the first formal concert played by Thayil since the demise of Soundgarden a few years beforehand, and only the second time Biafra had played music in a planned live setting since Dead Kennedys split in 1986.

Novoselic later asked Jack Endino to mix the recordings, resulting in the bands&#x27; only release, &quot;Live from the Battle in Seattle&quot;, distributed by Biafra&#x27;s record label Alternative Tentacles.

<doc id="865802" wikidata="Q835916" url="?curid=865802" title="International unit">
<text>In pharmacology, the international unit (IU) is a unit of measurement for the effect or biological activity of a substance, for the purpose of easier comparison across similar &quot;forms&quot; of substances. International units are used to quantify vitamins and biologics (hormones, some medications, vaccines, blood products and similar biologically active substances).

International units as used in pharmacology are not part of the International System of Units (SI). 

== For biologic preparations ==

Biologics are medications and other products made from biological sources. Depending on the form (powder vs solution), production method, or just batch-to-batch differences, there is often some variation in their relative potencies, so that a simple measure of mass would not suffice. The &quot;international unit&quot; allows one to compare the relative potency of all these forms, so that different forms or preparations with the same biological effect will contain the same number of IUs. To do so, the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization (WHO ECBS) provides a reference preparation of the agent, arbitrarily sets the number of IUs contained in that preparation, and specifies a biological assay and/or an immunoassay procedure to compare other preparations of the same agent to the reference preparation. Since the number of IUs contained in a new substance is arbitrarily set, there is no equivalence between IU measurements of different biological agents.

=== Process of definition ===
To define the IU for a substance, an international collaborative study is organized by the WHO Expert Committee on Biological Standardization using various assay systems in several laboratories. The main goal of the study is to reach a consensus regarding methods of analysis and the approach to standardization so that results can be compared.

The study is performed using highly purified preparations of the substance, typically in lyophilized form, called &quot;international reference preparations&quot;, or &quot;IRPs&quot;. Each preparation is divided into precisely weighed samples, with each sample stored in its own ampoule labeled with a code corresponding to the source IRP. Assays are performed using these samples and are calibrated against the previously available IU standard. These results can be quite variable; the final IU value for samples of a given IRP are determined by consensus. The IRP that provides the best results and shows the best long term stability is selected to define the next IU. This IRP is then referred to as the &quot;international standard&quot;.

When a standard sample comes close to depleting, a new standard will have to be found. A new batch of the substance in question is produced and calibrated against the old one, so that the unit still represents the same amount of biological activity. Many substances have undergone several such standard sample changes. The &quot;third international standard&quot; of prolactin has nearly run out and in 2016 replacement was proposed.

=== Examples ===
* 1 IU of rhEGF is defined as the potency of 0.001 μg of a rhEGF in the &quot;91/530&quot; standard vial. One manufacturer reports that its rhEGF is 1.4 times as potent as the 91/530 standard.
* 12.5 IU of oxytocin is defined as the potency of 21 μg of pure peptide in the &quot;76/575&quot; standard vial.

Before the purification of penicillin was perfected, the amounts were also described in &quot;International Units&quot; (and some non-international arbitrary &quot;units&quot; before them) to account for batch-to-batch variation. See .

== For vitamins ==
A number of vitamins have distinct vitamers of distinct biological potencies. There is a system in place also called the &quot;international unit&quot; to describe the relative strength of these different molecular forms. Like the biological &quot;international unit&quot;, the IU for vitamins is also an &quot;arbitrary&quot; number that cannot be interconverted among different types of activities. By 1934, the WHO (then the League of Nations Health Organisation) had already defined the international units for vitamins A, B1, C, and D.

Unlike biologic preparations, small molecules like vitamins can be very easily purified to yield products that are equivalent in potency. As a result, a simple mass conversion (as opposed to an assay) suffices to obtain the IU:

* 1 IU Vitamin A = 0.3 μg retinol (~0.1 nmol) = 0.6 μg beta-carotene
* 1 IU Vitamin D = 0.025 μg D2/D3 ≈ 0.65 pmol
* 1 IU Vitamin E = mg d-alpha-tocopherol = 0.90 mg of dl-alpha-tocopherol

== History ==

In 1931, the Permanent Commission on Biological Standardisation of the League of Nations Health Organisation specified the provisional standards for vitamins A, B1, C, and D. These original standards were quite crude by modern measures: the standard for vitamin A was a mixture of many carotenoids, for vitamin B1 the result of adsorbing rice polishings onto fuller&#x27;s earth, for vitamin C a sample of lemon juice, for vitamin D a sample of irradiated ergosterol in oil. In 1935, the standards for A, C, and D were changed to use pure substances: pure beta-carotene in oil, crystalline ascorbic acid, and crystalline ergocalciferol. This same commission also established early standards for biologics (antitoxins, insulins, pituitary extract and sex hormones) in the interwar period.

In 1944, officials from the League of Nations, in cooperation with the Royal Society, established a first international standard for penicillin. The postwar World Health Organization established a second standard in 1953. Both were defined using a pure, crystalline substance.

== Languages ==
The name &quot;international unit&quot; is often capitalized in English and other languages, although major English-language dictionaries treat it as a common noun and thus use lower case. The name has several accepted abbreviations. It is usually abbreviated as &quot;IU&quot; in English, and &quot;UI&quot; in Romance languages (for example Spanish &quot;unidad internacional&quot;, Portuguese &quot;unidade internacional&quot;, French &quot;unité internationale&quot;, Italian &quot;unità internazionale&quot;, Romanian &quot;unitate internațională&quot;), &quot;IE&quot; in several Germanic languages (for example German &quot;internationale Einheit&quot;, Dutch &quot;internationale eenheid&quot;) or as other forms (for example Russian МЕ, международная единица [&quot;mezhdunarodnaya yedinitsa&quot;], Hungarian NE, &quot;nemzetközi egység&quot;).

In order to remove the possibility of having the letter &quot;I&quot; confused with the digit &quot;1&quot;, some hospitals have it as a stated policy omit the &quot;I&quot;, that is, to only use U or E when talking and writing about dosages, while other hospitals require the word &quot;units&quot; (or words &quot;international units&quot;) to be written out entirely. (For example, &quot;three international units per litre&quot; may be abbreviated &quot;3 U/L&quot;. The &quot;liter&quot; sign (L) is less affected, as less confusing written forms are used.)

<text>The Liberal Democratic Party ( &quot;Libaral Pakshaya&quot;; ), formerly known as the Liberal Party is a political party in Sri Lanka which initially began as a think-tank called the Council for Liberal Democracy. The party was founded in 1981 by Dr. Chanaka Amaratunga, a longstanding member of the United National Party, which was at the time the ruling party of Sri Lanka. 

The CLD broke up with the UNP in 1982 over the 1982 referendum, which postponed parliamentary elections for six years. After four years of attempts to promote liberal thinking in Sri Lanka, in particular with regard to constitutional reforms that would promote devolution along with separation and reduction of powers at the center, Dr Amaratunga and several of his associates eventually relaunched the CLD as the Liberal Party in February 1987. 

Though the party never established itself as an electoral success, the Liberal Party continued to have an impact as a think-tank. It contributed seminally to the manifestoes of presidential candidates Sirimavo Bandaranaike and Gamini Dissanayake in 1988 and 1994 respectively.

In 1996, Dr Amaratunga died in a car accident, which led to a significant reduction in party activity. Amaratunga&#x27;s successor Rajiva Wijesinha contested in the 2000 parliamentary elections and came 6th in a field of 15, a success that served to advance the image of the party.

On 19 June 2022, the Liberal Party was renamed as the Liberal Democratic Party. The first congress of the LDP was held on 26 July 2022. Kamal Nissanka is the current leader of the party and Amal Randeniya is the current general secretary.

<text>The 90th Street–Elmhurst Avenue station is a local station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway, located at 90th Street and Elmhurst Avenue in Elmhurst, Queens. It is served by the 7 train at all times.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The 1913 Dual Contracts called for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) to build new lines in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Queens did not receive many new IRT and BRT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city&#x27;s Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding in the other two boroughs first before building in Queens, which was relatively undeveloped. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, along with the Astoria Line; it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens&#x27;s oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of the line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there. The Flushing Line was opened from Queensboro Plaza to Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street–Corona Plaza) on April 21, 1917, with a local station at 90th Street.

=== Later years ===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. On October 17, 1949, the joint BMT/IRT operation of the Flushing Line ended, and the line became the responsibility of the IRT. After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the station were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars. With the opening of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, trains were lengthened to eleven cars.

On February 2, 2019, a fatal gang shooting occurred at the station, carried out by an alleged MS-13 or SUR 13 member who shot another person of rival 18th Street gang.

==Station layout==
This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is used by the peak direction &lt;7&gt; express service during rush hours.

Both platforms have beige windscreens and brown canopies with red support frames and columns in the center and beige, waist-high, steel fences with lampposts at regular intervals at either ends. The windscreens have translucent panels by the exit staircases and the station signs are in the standard black name plates in white lettering.

===Exits===
This station has one elevated station house below the center of the platforms and tracks. The north side has two staircases going down to either northern corners of 90th Street and Roosevelt Avenue while the south side has one staircase going down to the triangle formed by Roosevelt Avenue, Elmhurst Avenue, and Case Street.

Inside the station house is a token booth in the center. On the south (geographical west) side is a turnstile bank that leads to a waiting area/crossover and one staircase going up to each platform. On the north (geographical east) side, each side has a bank of two turnstiles and one staircase going up to the platform.

<text>Shirley Clarke Franklin (born May 10, 1945) is an American politician, a member of the Democratic Party who served as the 58th mayor of Atlanta, Georgia, from 2002 to 2010. She currently serves as a member on the board of directors for both Delta Air Lines and Mueller Water Products.

The 58th mayor of Atlanta, she was the first woman to hold the post and the first black woman to be elected mayor of a major Southern city. Franklin was Atlanta&#x27;s fourth African-American mayor. In July 2009, Mayor Franklin (along with Frances Townsend and Judge William H. Webster) was appointed to an ad hoc Department of Homeland Security special task force for 60-day review of the Homeland Security Advisory System.

==Education==
Originally from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, she is a graduate of the Philadelphia High School for Girls. Franklin received her B.A. in sociology from Howard University and her M.A., also in sociology, from the University of Pennsylvania.
She is an Honorary member of Delta Sigma Theta sorority.

==Political career==
Franklin served as the Commissioner of Cultural Affairs under Mayor Maynard Jackson. Subsequently, she was named Chief Administrative Officer and City Manager under Mayor Andrew Young.

Her 2001 run for mayor was her first run for public office. She won, succeeding Mayor Bill Campbell after winning 50 percent of the vote, defeating several candidates including Democrat Robb Pitts (33 percent). Facing a massive and unexpected budget deficit, Franklin slashed the number of government employees and increased taxes to balance the budget as quickly as possible.

Franklin made repairing the Atlanta sewer system a main focus of her office. Prior to Franklin&#x27;s term, Atlanta&#x27;s combined sewer system violated the federal Clean Water Act and burdened the city government with fines from the Environmental Protection Agency. In 2002, Franklin announced an initiative called &quot;Clean Water Atlanta&quot; to address the problem and begin improving the city&#x27;s sewer system.

She has been lauded for efforts to make the City of Atlanta &quot;green.&quot; Under Franklin&#x27;s leadership Atlanta has gone from having one of the lowest percentages of LEED certified buildings to one of the highest.

In 2005, &quot;Time&quot; named Franklin one of the five best big-city American mayors. In October of that same year, she was included in the U.S. News &amp; World Report &quot;Best Leaders of 2005&quot; issue.

With solid popular support and strong backing from the business sector, Franklin was reelected Atlanta Mayor in 2005, garnering more than 90 percent of the vote. Her popularity led to increased speculation that she may be a viable contender for a future Georgia governor&#x27;s race.

In February 2006, The White House Project named Shirley Franklin one of its &quot;8 in &#x27;08&quot;, a group of eight female politicians who could possibly run and/or be elected president in 2008. She was the only person on the list to not be a governor, senator or presidential cabinet member, and one of two African-American women on the list; the other was United States Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice.

In 2006, Shirley Franklin led the effort to have the papers of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. given to his alma mater, Morehouse College, instead of being sold at auction: &quot;I never imagined I could contribute to the continuation of Dr. King&#x27;s legacy in as a significant way. And I&#x27;m really humbled I was able to do anything to continue his legacy.&quot;

Franklin was a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino. She was 2007/08 President of the National Conference of Democratic Mayors.

In 2008, facing a major deficit, Mayor Franklin asked the Atlanta City Council to approve a property tax increase, to avoid public safety cuts. The Atlanta City Council unanimously shot down the measure, which would have caused the average city homeowner to pay an estimated extra $30 in property taxes under Franklin&#x27;s plan. As Mayor Franklin warned, without the tax increase, layoffs and pay cuts of Atlanta public safety officials would be imminent.

According to the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;, in December 2008 Franklin announced that 222 city workers would lose their jobs to help fill a projected $50 million to $60 million budget shortfall. Most remaining city workers, including firefighters, will work fewer hours and suffer a pay cut as part of the budget cuts.

Mayor Shirley Franklin has said that the deficits in the city of Atlanta are not because of excess city spending. In fact, according to the Atlanta Business Chronicle city spending actually ran slightly below budgeted amounts through the first quarter of the fiscal year that began in July. According to Mayor Shirley Franklin, city tax collections are down by more than 12 percent because of the economic downturn. However, basic accounting mistakes in the city budget also played a significant role in the budget crisis.

Franklin, along with Philadelphia&#x27;s Michael Nutter and Phil Gordon of Phoenix, lobbied Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson in a joint letter asking for a share of the proposed $700 billion bailout.

==Honors==

Mayor Franklin was the recipient of Profile in Courage Award in 2005, issued by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation. The foundation praised her management of the city of Atlanta during the critical period of enormous deficit and loss of public confidence in government following the corrupt administration of Mayor Bill Campbell. In 2007, she received an honorary degree in Doctor of Humane Letters from Oglethorpe University.

In 2022, she was inducted as a Georgia Trustee, an honor given by the Georgia Historical Society in conjunction with the Governor of Georgia to individuals whose accomplishments and community service reflect the ideals of the founding body of Trustees, which governed the Georgia colony from 1732 to 1752.

==Personal life==
Franklin has a daughter, Kai Franklin Graham, whose former husband, Tremayne &quot;Kiki&quot; Graham, was sentenced to life in prison for his involvement in a drug dealing operation. Kai herself pled guilty to helping to launder money for him. Shirley Franklin had a son named Cabral. He died in 2015.

According to a DNA analysis, Franklin is descended, mainly, from people of Guinea-Bissau and Sierra Leone.

<text>Ildjarn was a Norwegian black metal project that formed in 1991. Ildjarn recorded music until 1997 but did not officially end until 2005. The man behind Ildjarn was Vidar Våer, although some releases were collaborations with a musician known as Nidhogg.

==History==
The band was formed in 1991. The band&#x27;s music was a very raw, fast, simple and lo-fi brand of black metal, with most songs composed of basic drum patterns, a couple of riffs, and unintelligible vocals. The band&#x27;s style has been compared to hardcore punk in its simplistic ferocity and short song lengths. Two Ildjarn albums were made entirely on a synthesizer. Of all the released music, the only Ildjarn song to have its lyrics published was &quot;Eksistensens Jeger&quot;, from the self-titled compilation &quot;Ildjarn-Nidhogg&quot; in 2003.

In 2006, the band website stated that no more news would be printed, leading to the conclusion that Ildjarn had ended. The title of Ildjarn&#x27;s 2005 release, &quot;Ildjarn is Dead&quot;, further supports this conclusion. Part of Vidar Våer&#x27;s motivation for ending Ildjarn was due to his 4-track recorder breaking (the same 4-track recorder used during Emperor&#x27;s early days as Thou Shalt Suffer). 

Ildjarn never had or shared any political affiliations, messages or themes, but the artist supported veganism in interviews. However, in the Final Statement Vidar issued in 2005, he stated: &quot;(...) I don’t wish to comment any more on subhumans such as gay human males. They are the lowest of the low, like retards, Congoids (...)&quot;

==Related projects==
The related band Sort Vokter consisted of Ildjarn, Nidhogg and two other members known as Tvigygre and Heiinghund. They released only one album called &quot;Folkloric Necro Metal&quot;.

<text>The 82nd Street–Jackson Heights station (formerly known as 25th Street (Jackson Heights) station) is a local station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway, located at the intersection of 82nd Street and Roosevelt Avenue in Jackson Heights, Queens. It is served by the 7 train at all times.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The 1913 Dual Contracts called for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) to build new lines in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Queens did not receive many new IRT and BRT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city&#x27;s Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding in the other two boroughs first before building in Queens, which was relatively undeveloped. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, along with the Astoria Line; it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens&#x27;s oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of the line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.

The Flushing Line was opened from Queensboro Plaza to Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street–Corona Plaza) on April 21, 1917, with a local station at what is now 82nd Street. The current 82nd Street station was known as &quot;25th Street&quot; from its opening until March 10, 1921, when it was renamed &quot;25th Street (Jackson Heights)&quot;. The station was again renamed on April 2, 1925, to &quot;82nd Street–Jackson Heights&quot;.

=== Later years ===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. On October 17, 1949, the joint BMT/IRT operation of the Flushing Line ended, and the line became the responsibility of the IRT. After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the station were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars. With the opening of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, trains were lengthened to eleven cars.

In 1981, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) listed the station among the 69 most deteriorated stations in the subway system. A renovation of the 82nd Street station was funded as part of the MTA&#x27;s 1980–1984 capital plan. The MTA received a $106 million grant () from the Urban Mass Transit Administration in October 1983; most of the grant would fund the renovation of eleven stations, including 82nd Street.

As part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program, the MTA announced plans to renovate the 52nd, 61st, 69th, 82nd, 103rd and 111th Streets stations, a project that had been delayed for several years. Conditions at these stations were reported to be among the worst of all stations in the subway system. The Manhattan-bound platform at the 82nd Street–Jackson Heights station was closed for renovation on May 15, 2023, and reopened on April 19, 2024. The Flushing-bound platform at this station was closed for renovation on May 6, 2024, and reopened on January 22, 2025.

==Station layout==

This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is used by the peak direction rush hour &lt;7&gt; express service. Both platforms have beige windscreens and brown canopies supported by green frames and columns in the center and black waist-high steel fences at either ends. The station signs are in the standard black name plate in white lettering. Each platform has a large &quot;82&quot; sign between the two staircases to the mezzanine below.

===Exits===

This station&#x27;s one entrance/exit is an elevated station house beneath the tracks. It is built of wood and bricks and has a concrete flooring. It has three staircases from all corners of 82nd Street and Roosevelt Avenue except the southeast one and a token booth in the center. Two turnstile banks at either ends lead to a waiting area/crossunder and one staircase to each platform at the center.

<text>Dick&#x27;s Drive-In Restaurants, Inc., or simply Dick&#x27;s, is an American regional chain of fast-food restaurants located in the Seattle metropolitan area. It was founded in Seattle&#x27;s Wallingford neighborhood in 1954 by Dick Spady, H. Warren Ghormley, and Dr. B.O.A. Thomas. Dick&#x27;s currently operates nine locations, of which all but one are drive-ins.

==History==
Founders Dick Spady, H. Warren Ghormley, and Dr. B. O. A. Thomas opened the first Dick&#x27;s on January 28, 1954, in Seattle&#x27;s Wallingford neighborhood. Located on N.E. 45th Street, the restaurant was designed by noted Seattle architect Raymond Peck, whose iconic design for the original location has been replicated at all future locations except Queen Anne. A grand opening was held on February 20, 1954. In 1955, a second Dick&#x27;s was opened in Seattle&#x27;s Capitol Hill district. This was followed by a third in 1960 in the Crown Hill neighborhood, a 4th in 1963 in Lake City, and ventured outside of Seattle&#x27;s city limits for the first time to Bellevue in 1965. The Bellevue location is the only location to have closed, shuttering its doors in 1974 as a Herfy&#x27;s opened across the street with indoor seating. Shortly after the closure of the Bellevue location, the Queen Anne location opened in 1974. All but the Queen Anne location are without customer seating. The Queen Anne location has indoor tables and no drive-in.

The simple menu has changed little over time. It features fast-food staples such as hamburgers, hand-cut french fries, and individually made milkshakes. Dick&#x27;s is particularly well known for the &quot;Dick&#x27;s Deluxe,&quot; which includes lettuce, mayonnaise, and chopped pickles. No substitutions are allowed and all burgers are cooked to well done. For most of Dick&#x27;s history, the only available omissions were the Deluxe without cheese or fries without salt. More recent menu changes, however, allow ordering plain versions of the hamburger and cheeseburger.

For several years Dick&#x27;s has offered employee benefits such as a 50% matched 401(k), 100% employer-paid medical insurance, and a college tuition scholarship (currently at $28,000) accessible after six months of employment. In 2013, Dick&#x27;s Drive-In was voted &quot;the most life-changing burger joint in America&quot; in an Esquire.com poll.

In September 2010, it was announced that Dick&#x27;s was planning on opening its first new location in over 30 years, and an online poll on their website would determine the new location. After a few weeks of polling, the area north of Seattle won the right for a new Dick&#x27;s Drive-In. On October 15, 2010, Dick&#x27;s officials announced the new location to be in Edmonds on the corner of Hwy 99 and 220th St. On October 20, 2011, the 6th location in Edmonds opened to the public. The opening occurred multiple weeks ahead of schedule.

In 2017, Dick&#x27;s launched another poll to determine its seventh location, which would be located either on the Eastside or in South King County. Over 177,000 participants cast their votes, with the majority favoring the South region. Locations being considered included Kent, West Seattle, South Seattle, Renton, Burien, SeaTac, Tukwila, Auburn, Normandy Park, Des Moines and Federal Way. After an extensive amount of time, it was announced on September 7, 2017, that the 7th location to the chain would be located in Kent on Highway 99, south of Sea-Tac Airport. The location opened on December 12, 2018.

In September 2020, Dick&#x27;s announced that it would launch a food truck to serve five locations in Western Washington that were chosen through a public poll: Bellevue, Bellingham, Everett, Renton, and West Seattle. The restaurant also announced that it would be expanding to the Eastside once a suitable location is found. A collaboration with local chef Edouardo Jordan of Salare and JuneBaby was also announced with a three-day popup event at the Queen Anne location. In December 2021, Dick&#x27;s opened an Eastside location at the Crossroads Shopping Center in Bellevue. Dick&#x27;s then announced on April 28, 2022, that it would open a ninth location at The Commons shopping center in Federal Way in 2023.

<doc id="865825" wikidata="Q2157281" url="?curid=865825" title="Germany–Soviet Union relations, 1918–1941">
<text>German–Soviet Union relations date to the aftermath of the First World War. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, dictated by Germany ended hostilities between Russia and Germany; it was signed on March 3, 1918. A few months later, the German ambassador to Moscow, Wilhelm von Mirbach, was shot dead by Russian Left Socialist-Revolutionaries in an attempt to incite a new war between Russia and Germany. The entire Soviet embassy under Adolph Joffe was deported from Germany on November 6, 1918, for their active support of the German Revolution. Karl Radek also illegally supported communist subversive activities in Weimar Germany in 1919.

From the outset, both states sought to overturn the new order that was established by the victors of World War I. Germany, laboring under onerous reparations and stung by the collective responsibility provisions of the Treaty of Versailles, was a defeated nation in constant turmoil. This and the Russian Civil War made both Germany and the Soviets into international outcasts, and their resulting rapprochement during the interbellum was a natural convergence. At the same time, the dynamics of their relationship was shaped by both a lack of trust and the respective governments&#x27; fears of its partner&#x27;s breaking out of diplomatic isolation and turning towards the French Third Republic (which at the time was thought to possess the greatest military strength in Europe) and the Second Polish Republic, its ally. The countries&#x27; economic relationship dwindled in 1933, when Adolf Hitler came to power and created Nazi Germany; however, the relationships restarted in the end of 1930s, culminating with the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 and several trade agreements.

Few questions concerning the causes of World War II are more controversial and ideologically loaded than the issue of the policies of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin towards Nazi Germany between the Nazi seizure of power and the German invasion of the USSR on June 22, 1941. A variety of competing and contradictory theses exist, including: that the Soviet leadership actively sought another great war in Europe to further weaken the capitalist nations; that the USSR pursued a purely defensive policy; or that the USSR tried to avoid becoming entangled in a war, both because Soviet leaders did not feel that they had the military capabilities to conduct strategic operations at that time, and to avoid, in paraphrasing Stalin&#x27;s words to the 18th Party Congress on March 10, 1939, &quot;pulling other nations&#x27; (the UK and France&#x27;s) chestnuts out of the fire.&quot;

==The Soviet Union and Weimar Germany==

=== Revolution and end of World War I ===
The outcome of the First World War was disastrous for both Germany&#x27;s future and for the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic. During the war, the Bolsheviks struggled for survival, and Vladimir Lenin had no option except to recognize the independence of Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. Moreover, facing a German military advance, Lenin and Leon Trotsky were forced to enter into the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, which ceded large swathes of western Russian territory to the German Empire. On 11 November 1918, the Germans signed an armistice with the Allies, ending the First World War on the Western Front. After Germany&#x27;s collapse, British, French and Japanese troops intervened in the Russian Civil War.

Initially, the Soviet leadership hoped for a successful socialist revolution in Germany as part of the &quot;world revolution&quot;. However, the attempts to set up soviet-style republics in Germany were local and short-lived (Bavaria: 25 days; Bremen: 26 days; Würzburg: 3 days) or failed altogether (such as the Spartacist uprising). Subsequently, the Bolsheviks became embroiled in the Soviet war with Poland of 1919–1920. Because Poland was a traditional enemy of Germany (see e.g. Silesian Uprisings), and because the Soviet state was also isolated internationally, the Soviet government began to seek a closer relationship with Germany and therefore adopted a much less hostile attitude towards Germany. This line was consistently pursued under People&#x27;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs Georgy Chicherin and Soviet Ambassador Nikolay Krestinsky. Other Soviet representatives instrumental in the negotiations were Karl Radek, Leonid Krasin, Christian Rakovsky, Victor Kopp and Adolph Joffe.

In the 1920s, many in the leadership of Weimar Germany, who felt humiliated by the conditions that the Treaty of Versailles had imposed after their defeat in the First World War (especially General Hans von Seeckt, chief of the Reichswehr), were interested in cooperation with the Soviet Union, both in order to avert any threat from the Second Polish Republic, backed by the French Third Republic, and to prevent any possible Soviet-British alliance. The specific German aims were the full rearmament of the Reichswehr, which was explicitly prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles, and an alliance against Poland. It is unknown exactly when the first contacts between von Seeckt and the Soviets took place, but it could have been as early as 1919–1921, or possibly even before the signing of the Treaty of Versailles.

On April 16, 1920, Victor Kopp, the RSFSR&#x27;s special representative to Berlin, asked at the German Foreign Office whether &quot;there was any possibility of combining the German and the Red Army for a joint war on Poland&quot;. This was yet another event at the start of military cooperation between the two countries, which ended before the German invasion of the Soviet Union on June 22, 1941.

By early 1921, a special group in the Reichswehr Ministry devoted to Soviet affairs, &quot;Sondergruppe R&quot;, had been created.

Weimar Germany&#x27;s army had been limited to 100,000 men by the Treaty of Versailles, which also forbade the Germans to have aircraft, tanks, submarines, heavy artillery, poison gas, anti-tank weapons or many anti-aircraft guns. A team of inspectors from the League of Nations patrolled many German factories and workshops to ensure that these weapons were not being manufactured.

===Treaty of Rapallo 1922 and secret military cooperation===
The Treaty of Rapallo between Weimar Germany and Soviet Russia was signed by German Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau and his Soviet colleague Georgy Chicherin on April 16, 1922, during the Genoa Economic Conference, annulling all mutual claims, restoring full diplomatic relations, and establishing the beginnings of close trade relationships, which made Weimar Germany the main trading and diplomatic partner of the Soviet Union.

Rumors of a secret military supplement to the treaty soon spread. However, for a long time the consensus was that those rumors were wrong, and that Soviet-German military negotiations were independent of Rapallo and kept secret from the German Foreign Ministry for some time. This point of view was later challenged. On November 5, 1922, six other Soviet republics, which would soon join the Soviet Union, agreed to adhere to the Treaty of Rapallo as well.

The Soviets offered Weimar Germany facilities deep inside the USSR for building and testing arms and for military training, well away from Treaty inspectors&#x27; eyes. In return, the Soviets asked for access to German technical developments, and for assistance in creating a Red Army General Staff.

The first German officers went to Soviet Russia for these purposes in March 1922. One month later, Junkers began building aircraft at Fili, outside Moscow, in violation of Versailles. The joint factory built Junkers&#x27; most recent all-metal designs. Soviet aircraft designers learned new techniques at the factory, such as Andrei Tupolev and Pavel Sukhoi. After the factory was turned over to Soviet use, Soviet adaptations of the Junker bombers were manufactured there, such as the Tupolev TB-1 and Tupolev TB-3.

The great artillery manufacturer Krupp was soon active in the south of the USSR, near Rostov-on-Don. In 1925, a flying school was established near Lipetsk (Lipetsk fighter-pilot school) to train the first pilots for the future Luftwaffe. Since 1926, the Reichswehr had been able to use a tank school at Kazan (Kama tank school) and a chemical weapons facility in Saratov Oblast (Tomka gas test site). In turn, the Red Army gained access to these training facilities, as well as military technology and theory from Weimar Germany.

The Soviets offered submarine-building facilities at a port on the Black Sea, but this was not taken up. The &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; did take up a later offer of a base near Murmansk, where German vessels could hide from the British. During the Cold War, this base at Polyarnyy (which had been built especially for the Germans) became the largest weapons store in the world.

====Documentation====
Most of the documents pertaining to secret German-Soviet military cooperation were systematically destroyed in Germany. The Polish and French intelligence communities of the 1920s were remarkably well-informed regarding the cooperation. This did not, however, have any immediate effect upon German relations with other European powers. After World War II, the papers of General Hans von Seeckt and memoirs of other German officers became available, and after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, a handful of Soviet documents regarding this were published.

===Relations in the 1920s===


===Trade===

Since the late nineteenth century, Germany, which has few natural resources, had relied heavily upon Russian imports of raw materials. Before World War I, Germany imported of raw materials and other goods per year from Russia. This fell after World War I, but after trade agreements signed between the two countries in the mid-1920s, trade had increased to per year by 1927. In the late 1920s, Germany helped Soviet industry begin to modernize, and to assist in the establishment of tank production facilities at the Leningrad Bolshevik Factory and the Kharkov Locomotive Factory.

Germany&#x27;s fear of international isolation due to a possible Soviet rapprochement with France, the main German adversary, was a key factor in the acceleration of economic negotiations. On October 12, 1925, a commercial agreement between the two nations was concluded.

===Plans for Poland===
Alongside Soviet Russia&#x27;s military and economic assistance, there was also political backing for Germany&#x27;s aspirations. On July 19, 1920, Victor Kopp told the German Foreign Office that Soviet Russia wanted &quot;a common frontier with Germany, south of Lithuania, approximately on a line with Białystok&quot;. In other words, Poland was to be partitioned once again. These promptings were repeated over the years, with the Soviets always anxious to stress that ideological differences between the two governments were of no account; all that mattered was that the two countries were pursuing the same foreign policy objectives.

On December 4, 1924, Victor Kopp, worried that the expected admission of Germany to the League of Nations (Germany was finally admitted to the League in 1926) was an anti-Soviet move, offered German Ambassador Ulrich Graf von Brockdorff-Rantzau to cooperate against the Second Polish Republic, and secret negotiations were sanctioned. However, the Weimar Republic rejected any venture into war.

===Diplomatic relations===
By 1919, both Germany and Russia were pariah nations in the eyes of democratic leaders. Both were excluded from major conferences and were deeply distrusted. The effect was to bring Moscow and Berlin closer together, most notably at Rapallo. German diplomats worried at the revolutionary nature of the Soviet Union, but were reassured by Lenin&#x27;s New Economic Policy that seem to restore a semblance of capitalism. Berlin officials concluded that their policy of engagement was a success. However, in 1927 Berlin realized that the Comintern, and Stalin, did not reflect a retreat from revolutionary Marxist–Leninism.

In 1925, Germany broke its diplomatic isolation and took part in the Locarno Treaties with France and Belgium, undertaking not to attack them. The Soviet Union saw western European &quot;détente&quot; as potentially deepening its own political isolation in Europe, in particular by diminishing Soviet-German relationships. As Germany became less dependent on the Soviet Union, it became more unwilling to tolerate subversive Comintern interference: in 1925, several members of Rote Hilfe, a Communist Party organization, were tried for treason in Leipzig in what was known as the Cheka Trial.

On April 24, 1926, Weimar Germany and the Soviet Union concluded another treaty (Treaty of Berlin (1926)), declaring the parties&#x27; adherence to the Treaty of Rapallo and neutrality for five years. The treaty was signed by German Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann and Soviet ambassador Nikolay Krestinsky. The treaty was perceived as an imminent threat by Poland (which contributed to the success of the May Coup in Warsaw), and with caution by other European states regarding its possible effect upon Germany&#x27;s obligations as a party to the Locarno Agreements. France also voiced concerns in this regard in the context of Germany&#x27;s expected membership in the League of Nations.

=== Third Period ===

In 1928, the 9th Plenum of the Executive Committee of the Communist International and its 6th Congress in Moscow favored Stalin&#x27;s program over the line pursued by Comintern Secretary General Nikolay Bukharin. Unlike Bukharin, Stalin believed that a deep crisis in western capitalism was imminent, and he denounced the cooperation of international communist parties with social democratic movements, labelling them as social fascists, and insisted on a far stricter subordination of international communist parties to the Comintern, that is, to Soviet leadership. This was known as the Third Period. The policy of the Communist Party of Germany (KPD) under Ernst Thälmann was altered accordingly. The relatively independent KPD of the early 1920s almost completely subordinated itself to the Soviet Union.

Stalin&#x27;s order that the German Communist party must never again vote with the Social Democrats coincided with his agreement, in December 1928, with what was termed the &#x27;Union of Industrialists&#x27;. Under this agreement the Union of Industrialists agreed to provide the Soviet Union with an up-to-date armaments industry and the industrial base to support it, on two conditions:

Firstly, they required paying in hard currency or in goods, not in Soviet rubles. Stalin desperately wanted their weapons, including anti-aircraft guns, howitzers, anti-tank guns, machine guns etc., but he was critically short of money. As Russia had been a major wheat exporter before the First World War, he decided to expel his recalcitrant kulak peasant farmers to the wastes of Siberia and create huge collective farms on their land like the 50,000 hectare farm that Krupp had created in the North Caucasus. Thus, in 1930 and 1931, a huge deluge of Soviet wheat at slave labour prices flooded unsuspecting world markets, where surpluses already prevailed, thereby causing poverty and distress to North American farmers. However, Stalin secured the precious foreign currency to pay for German armaments.

Yet the Union of Industrialists were not only interested in cash for their weapons, they wanted a political concession. They feared the arrival of socialism in Germany and were irate at the KPD and Social Democrats objecting to providing funds for the development of new armored cruisers. Stalin would have had no compunction about ordering the German Communists to change sides if it suited his purpose. He had negotiated with the German armaments makers throughout the summer of 1928 and was determined to modernize his armed forces. From 1929 onwards, therefore, the Communists voted faithfully with the far right DNVP and Hitler&#x27;s NSDAP in the Reichstag despite fighting them in the streets.

Relying on the foreign affairs doctrine pursued by the Soviet leadership in the 1920s, in his report of the Central Committee to the Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (b) on June 27, 1930, Joseph Stalin welcomed the international destabilization and rise of political extremism among the capitalist powers.

===Early 1930s===
The most intensive period of Soviet military collaboration with Weimar Germany was 1930–1932. On June 24, 1931, an extension of the 1926 Berlin Treaty was signed, though it was not until 1933 that it was ratified by the Reichstag due to internal political struggles. Some Soviet mistrust arose during the Lausanne Conference of 1932, when it was rumored that German Chancellor Franz von Papen had offered French Prime Minister Édouard Herriot a military alliance. The Soviets were also quick to develop their own relations with France and its main ally, Poland. This culminated in the conclusion of the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact on July 25, 1932, and the Soviet-French non-aggression pact on November 29, 1932.

The conflict between the Communist Party of Germany and the Social Democratic Party of Germany fundamentally contributed to the ease with which Hitler&#x27;s government replaced the Weimar Republic with the Third Reich. It is, however, disputed whether Hitler&#x27;s seizure of power came as a surprise to the USSR. One author has claimed that Stalin accepted and even facilitated Hitler&#x27;s rise in order to foster an inter-imperialist war, a theory dismissed by others.

During this period, trade between Germany and the Soviet Union declined as the more isolationist Stalinist regime asserted its power and as the abandonment of post-World War I military control decreased Germany&#x27;s reliance on Soviet imports, such that Soviet imports fell to by 1934.

===Persecution of ethnic Germans in the Soviet Union===
The USSR had a large population of ethnic Germans, especially in the Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, who were distrusted and persecuted by Stalin from 1928 to 1948. They were relatively well-educated, and at first, class factors played a major role, giving way after 1933 to ethnic links to the dreaded Nazi German regime as the chief criterion. Taxes escalated after the Operation Barbarossa. Some settlements were permanently banished to the east of the Urals.

==Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union before World War II==

German documents pertaining to Soviet-German relations were captured by the American and British armies in 1945, and published by the U.S. Department of State shortly thereafter. In the Soviet Union and Russia, including in official speeches and historiography, Nazi Germany has generally been referred to as Fascist Germany () from 1933 until today.

===Initial relations after Hitler&#x27;s election===
After Adolf Hitler came to power on January 30, 1933, he began the suppression of the Communist Party of Germany. The Nazis took police measures against Soviet trade missions, companies, press representatives, and individual citizens in Germany. They also launched an anti-Soviet propaganda campaign coupled with a lack of good will in diplomatic relations, although the German Foreign Ministry under Konstantin von Neurath (foreign minister from 1932 to 1938) was vigorously opposed to the impending breakup. The second volume of Hitler&#x27;s programmatic Mein Kampf (which first appeared in 1926) called for &quot;Lebensraum&quot; (living space for the German nation) in the east (mentioning Russia specifically), and, in keeping with his world view, portrayed the Communists as Jews (see also Jewish Bolshevism) who were destroying a great nation.

Moscow&#x27;s reaction to these steps of Berlin was initially restrained, with the exception of several tentative attacks on the new German government in the Soviet press. However, as the heavy-handed anti-Soviet actions of the German government continued unabated, the Soviets unleashed their own propaganda campaign against the Nazis, but by May the possibility of conflict appeared to have receded. The 1931 extension of the Berlin Treaty was ratified in Germany on May 5. In August 1933, Molotov assured German ambassador Herbert von Dirksen that Soviet-German relations would depend exclusively on the attitude of Germany towards the Soviet Union. However, Reichswehr access to the three military training and testing sites (Lipetsk, Kama, and Tomka) was abruptly terminated by the Soviet Union in August–September 1933. Political understanding between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany was finally broken by the German-Polish Non-Aggression Pact of January 26, 1934, between Nazi Germany and the Second Polish Republic.

Maxim Litvinov, who had been People&#x27;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs (Foreign Minister of the USSR) since 1930, considered Nazi Germany to be the greatest threat to the Soviet Union. However, as the Red Army was perceived as not strong enough, and the USSR sought to avoid becoming embroiled in a general European war, he began pursuing a policy of collective security, trying to contain Nazi Germany via cooperation with the League of Nations and the Western Powers. The Soviet attitude towards the League of Nations and international peace had changed. In 1933–34 the Soviet Union was diplomatically recognized for the first time by Spain, the United States, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria, and ultimately joined the League of Nations in September 1934. It is often argued that the change in Soviet foreign policy happened around 1933–34, and that it was triggered by Hitler&#x27;s assumption of power. However, the Soviet turn towards the French Third Republic in 1932, discussed above, could also have been a part of the policy change.

Hermann Rauschning in his 1940 book &quot;Hitler Speaks: A Series of Political Conversations With Adolf Hitler on His Real Aims 1934&quot; records Adolf Hitler as speaking of an inescapable battle against both Pan-Slavism and Neo-Slavism. The authenticity of the book is controversial: some historians, such as Wolfgang Hänel, claim that the book is a fabrication, whereas others, such as Richard Steigmann-Gall, Ian Kershaw and Hugh Trevor-Roper, have avoided using it as a reference due to its questionable authenticity. Rauschning records Hitler as saying of the Slavs:

Historian Eric D. Weitz discussed the areas of collaboration between the regimes in which hundreds of German citizens, the majority of whom were Communists, had been handed over to the Gestapo from Stalin&#x27;s administration. Weitz also stated that a higher proportion of the KPD Politburo members had died in the Soviet Union than in Nazi Germany.

===Relations in the mid-1930s===
On May 2, 1935, France and the USSR signed a five-year Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance. France&#x27;s ratification of the treaty provided one of the reasons why Hitler remilitarized the Rhineland on March 7, 1936.

The 7th World Congress of the Comintern in 1935 officially endorsed the Popular Front strategy of forming broad alliances with parties willing to oppose fascism – Communist parties had started pursuing this policy from 1934. Also in 1935, at the 7th Congress of Soviets (in a study in contradiction), Molotov stressed the need for good relations with Berlin.

On November 25, 1936, Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan concluded the Anti-Comintern Pact, which Fascist Italy joined in 1937. (Although Italy had already signed the Italo-Soviet Pact in 1933)
Economically, the Soviet Union made repeated efforts to reestablish closer contacts with Germany in the mid-1930s. The Soviet Union chiefly sought to repay debts from earlier trade with raw materials, while Germany sought to rearm. The two countries signed a credit agreement in 1935. By 1936, crises in the supply of raw materials and foodstuffs forced Hitler to decree a Four Year Plan for rearmament &quot;without regard to costs&quot;. However, despite those issues, Hitler rebuffed the Soviet Union&#x27;s attempts to seek closer political ties to Germany along with an additional credit agreement.

Litvinov&#x27;s strategy faced ideological and political obstacles. The ruling Conservatives in Britain, who dominated the House of Commons from 1931 onwards, continued to regard the Soviet Union as no less of a threat than Nazi Germany (some saw the USSR as the greater threat). At the same time, as the Soviet Union underwent upheavals in the midst of the Great Purge of 1934–1940, the West or even Western leftists did not perceive it as a potentially valuable ally.

Further complicating matters, the purge of the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs forced the Soviet Union to close down quite a number of embassies abroad. At the same time, the purges made the signing of an economic deal with Germany less likely: they disrupted the already confused Soviet administrative structure necessary for negotiations and thus prompted Hitler to regard the Soviets as militarily weak.

===Spanish Civil War===

The Nationalists led by General Francisco Franco defeated the Republican government for control of Spain in a very bloody civil war, 1936–1939. Germany sent in elite air and tank units to the Nationalist forces; and Italy sent in several combat divisions. The Soviet Union sent military and political advisors, and sold munitions in support of the &quot;Loyalist,&quot; or Republican, side. The Comnitern helped Communist parties around the world send in volunteers to the International Brigades that fought for the Loyalists. The other major powers were neutral.

===Collective security failures===
Litvinov&#x27;s policy of containing Germany via collective security failed utterly with the conclusion of the Munich Agreement on September 29, 1938, when Britain and France favored self-determination of the Sudetenland Germans over Czechoslovakia&#x27;s territorial integrity, disregarding the Soviet position. However, it is still disputed whether, even before Munich, the Soviet Union would actually have fulfilled its guarantees to Czechoslovakia, in the case of an actual German invasion resisted by France.

In April 1939, Litvinov launched the tripartite alliance negotiations with the new British and French ambassadors, (William Seeds, assisted by William Strang, and Paul-Emile Naggiar), in an attempt to contain Germany. However, they were constantly dragged out and proceeded with major delays.

The Western powers believed that war could still be avoided and the USSR, much weakened by the purges, could not act as a main military participant. The USSR more or less disagreed with them on both issues, approaching the negotiations with caution because of the traditional hostility of the capitalist powers. The Soviet Union also engaged in secret talks with Nazi Germany, while conducting official ones with United Kingdom and France. From the beginning of the negotiations with France and Britain, the Soviets demanded that Finland be included in the Soviet sphere of influence.

==Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact==

=== 1939 needs and discussions ===
By the late 1930s, because a German autarkic economic approach or an alliance with Britain was impossible, closer relations with the Soviet Union were necessary, if not just for economic reasons alone. Germany lacked oil, and could only supply 25 percent of its own needs, leaving Germany 2 million tons short a year and a staggering 10 million tons below planned mobilization totals, while the Soviet Union was required for numerous key other raw materials, such as ores (including iron and manganese), rubber and food fat and oils. While Soviet imports into Germany had fallen to in 1937, massive armament production increases and critical raw material shortages caused Germany to turn to reverse their prior attitude, pushing forward economic talks in early 1939.

On May 3, 1939, Litvinov was dismissed and Vyacheslav Molotov, who had strained relations with Litvinov, was not of Jewish origin (unlike Litvinov), and had always been in favour of neutrality towards Germany, was put in charge of foreign affairs. The Foreign Affairs Commissariat was purged of Litvinov&#x27;s supporters and Jews. All this could well have purely internal reasons, but it could also be a signal to Germany that the era of anti-German collective security was past, or a signal to the British and French that Moscow should be taken more seriously in the tripartite alliance negotiations and that it was ready for arrangements without the old baggage of collective security, or even both.

The reshuffle was warily perceived by Germany as an opportunity.

It is sometimes argued that Molotov continued the talks with Britain and France to stimulate the Germans into making an offer of a non-aggression treaty and that the triple alliance failed because of the Soviet determination to conclude a pact with Germany. Another point of view is that the Soviet&#x27;s pursuit of a triple alliance was sincere and that the Soviet government turned to Germany only when an alliance with the Western powers proved impossible.

Additional factors that drove the Soviet Union towards a rapprochement with Germany might be the signing of a non-aggression pact between Germany, Latvia and Estonia on June 7, 1939 and the threat from Imperial Japan in the East, as evidenced by the Battle of Khalkhin Gol (May 11 – September 16, 1939). Molotov suggested that the Japanese attack might have been inspired by Germany in order to hinder the conclusion of the tripartite alliance.

In July, open Soviet–German trade negotiations were under way. In late July and early August, talks between the parties turned to a potential deal, but Soviet negotiators made clear that an economic deal must first be worked out. After Germany had scheduled its invasion of Poland on August 25, and prepared for the resulting war with France, German war planners estimated that a British naval blockade would further exacerbate critical German raw material shortages for which the Soviet Union was the only potential supplier.

Then, on August 3, German Foreign Minister Joachim Ribbentrop outlined a plan in which Germany and the Soviet Union would agree to nonintervention in each other&#x27;s affairs and would renounce measures aimed at the other&#x27;s vital interests and that &quot;there was no problem between the Baltic and the Black Sea that could not be solved between the two of us.&quot; The Germans stated that &quot;there is one common element in the ideology of Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union: opposition to the capitalist democracies of the West&quot;, and explained that their prior hostility toward Soviet Bolshevism had subsided with the changes in the Comintern and with the Soviet renunciation of a world revolution.

===Pact and commercial deal signings===

By August 10, the countries had worked out the last minor technical details to make all but final their economic arrangement, but the Soviets delayed signing that agreement for almost ten days until they were sure that they had reached a political agreement with Germany. The Soviet ambassador explained to German officials that the Soviets had begun their British negotiations &quot;without much enthusiasm&quot; at a time when they felt Germany would not &quot;come to an understanding&quot;, and the parallel talks with the British could not be simply broken off when they had been initiated after &#x27;mature consideration.&#x27; Meanwhile, every internal German military and economic study had argued that Germany was doomed to defeat without at least Soviet neutrality.

On August 19, the German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939) was reached. The agreement covered &quot;current&quot; business, which entailed a Soviet obligation to deliver in raw materials in response to German orders, while Germany would allow the Soviets to order for German industrial goods. Under the agreement, Germany also granted the Soviet Union a merchandise credit of over 7 years to buy German manufactured goods at an extremely favorable interest rate.

On August 22 the secret political negotiations were revealed when German newspapers announced that the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany were about to conclude a non-aggression pact, and that the Soviet Union&#x27;s prolonged negotiations regarding a Triple Alliance with France and Britain had been suspended. The Soviets blamed on the Western powers their reluctance to take the Soviet Union&#x27;s military assistance seriously and to acknowledge the Soviet right to cross Poland and Romania, if necessary against their will, and furthermore their failure to send representatives with more importance and clearly defined powers and to resolve the disagreement over the notion of &quot;indirect aggression&quot;.

On August 23, 1939, a German delegation headed by Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop arrived to Moscow, and in the following night, the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact was signed by him and his Soviet colleague Vyacheslav Molotov, in the presence of Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. The ten-year pact of non-aggression declared both parties&#x27; continued adherence to the Treaty of Berlin (1926), but the pact was also supplemented by a secret additional protocol, which divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet zones of influence:
1. In the event of a territorial and political rearrangement in the areas belonging to the Baltic States (Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), the northern boundary of Lithuania shall represent the boundary of the spheres of influence of Germany and the U.S.S.R. In this connection the interest of Lithuania in the Vilna area is recognized by each party.

2. In the event of a territorial and political rearrangement of the areas belonging to the Polish state the spheres of influence of Germany and the U.S.S.R. shall be bounded approximately by the line of the rivers Narew, Vistula, and San.

The question of whether the interests of both parties make desirable the maintenance of an independent Polish state and how such a state should be bounded can only be definitely determined in the course of further political developments.

In any event both Governments will resolve this question by means of a friendly agreement.

3. With regard to Southeastern Europe attention is called by the Soviet side to its interest in Bessarabia. The German side declares its complete political disinterestedness in these areas.
The secret protocol shall be treated by both parties as strictly secret. 
Though the parties denied its existence, the protocol was rumored to exist from the very beginning.

The news of the Pact, which was announced by &quot;Pravda&quot; and &quot;Izvestia&quot; on August 24, was met with utter shock and surprise by government leaders and media worldwide, most of whom were aware of only the British-French-Soviet negotiations, which had taken place for months. British and French negotiators, who were in Moscow negotiating what they thought would be the military part of an alliance with the Soviet Union, were told &quot;no useful purpose can be served in continuing the conversation.&quot; On August 25, Hitler told the British ambassador to Berlin that the pact with the Soviets freed Germany from the prospect of a two front war, thereby changing the strategic situation from that which had prevailed in World War I, and that therefore Britain should accept his demands regarding Poland. However, Hitler was surprised when Britain signed a mutual-assistance treaty with Poland that day, causing Hitler to delay the planned August 26 invasion of western Poland.

The pact was ratified by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union on August 31, 1939.

==World War II==

===German invasion of western Poland===

A week after having signed the Molotov–Ribbentrop pact, on September 1, 1939, Nazi Germany invaded its zone of influence in Poland. On September 3, the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand and France, fulfilling their obligations to the Second Polish Republic, declared war on Germany. The Second World War broke out in Europe.

On September 4, as Britain blockaded Germany at sea, German cargo ships heading towards German ports were diverted to the Soviet Arctic port of Murmansk. On September 8 the Soviet side agreed to pass it by railway to the Soviet Baltic Sea port of Leningrad. At the same time the Soviet Union refused to allow a Polish transit through its territory citing the threat of being drawn into war on September 5.

Von der Schulenburg reported to Berlin that attacks on the conduct of Germany in the Soviet press had ceased completely and the portrayal of events in the field of foreign politics largely coincided with the German point of view, while anti-German literature had been removed from the trade.

On September 7 Stalin once again outlined a new line for the Comintern that was now based on the idea that the war was an inter-imperialist conflict and hence there was no reason for the working class to side with Britain, France, or Poland against Germany, thus departing from the Comintern&#x27;s anti-fascist popular front policy of 1934–1939. He labeled Poland as a fascist state oppressing Belarusians and Ukrainians.

German diplomats had urged the Soviet Union to intervene against Poland from the east since the beginning of the war, but the Soviet Union was reluctant to intervene as Warsaw had not yet fallen. The Soviet decision to invade that part of eastern of Poland which had earlier been agreed as the Soviet zone of influence was communicated to the German ambassador Friedrich Werner von der Schulenburg on September 9, but the actual invasion was delayed for more than a week. The Polish intelligence became aware of the Soviet plans around September 12.

===Soviet invasion of eastern Poland===

On September 17 the Soviet Union finally entered the Polish territories that had been granted to it by the secret protocol of non-aggression pact from the east. As the pretexts to justify their actions, the Soviets cited the collapse of the Second Polish Republic and they claimed that they were trying to help the Belarusian and Ukrainian people. The Soviet invasion is usually considered direct result of the pact, although the revisionist school contends that this was not the case and that the Soviet decision was taken a few weeks later. The Soviet move was denounced by Britain and France, but they did not intervene. In an exchange of captured Polish territories in compliance with the terms of the protocol, already on September 17 the Red Army and Wehrmacht held a joint military parade in Brest; occupation of the city was then transferred by Germany to the Soviet troops. In the following battles with the rest of the Second Polish Republic&#x27;s army, the Soviet Union occupied the territories roughly corresponding to its sphere of interests, as defined in the secret additional protocol to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact.

The territory of Poland had been completely occupied by the two powers by October 6, and the Polish state was liquidated. In early November the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union annexed the occupied territories and the Soviet Union shared a common border with Nazi Germany, the Nazi-occupied Polish territories and Lithuania for the first time. After the invasion, cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union was visible, for example, in the four Gestapo-NKVD Conferences, where the occupying powers discussed plans for dealing with the Polish resistance movement, for the further destruction of Poland, and which enabled both parties to exchange Polish prisoners of interest prior to the signing of German–Soviet Frontier Treaty in Moscow in the presence of Joseph Stalin. The cooperation between Gestapo and NKVD continued, resulting in further exchanges of prisoners, among them Margarete Buber-Neumann, Alexander Weissberg-Cybulski, Betty Olberg and Max Zucker.

===Amendment of the Secret Protocols===
On September 25, when Hitler was still going to proceed to Lithuania, the Soviet Union proposed to renegotiate the spheres of interest. On September 28, 1939, in Moscow Molotov and Ribbentrop signed the German-Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty, determining the boundary of their respective national interests in the territory of the former Polish state. In a secret supplementary protocol to the treaty the spheres of interest outside Poland were renegotiated, and in exchange for some already captured portions of the Polish territory Germany acknowledged still independent Lithuania part of the Soviet zone.

===Expanded commercial pact===

Germany and the Soviet Union entered an intricate trade pact on February 11, 1940, that was over four times larger than the one the two countries had signed in August 1939. The trade pact helped Germany to surmount a British blockade of Germany. In the first year, Germany received one million tons of cereals, half a million tons of wheat, 900,000 tons of oil, 100,000 tons of cotton, 500,000 tons of phosphates and considerable amounts of other vital raw materials, along with the transit of one million tons of soybeans from Manchuria. These and other supplies were being transported through Soviet and occupied Polish territories, and this allowed Nazi Germany to circumvent the British naval blockade. The Soviets were to receive a naval cruiser, the plans to the battleship &quot;Bismarck&quot;, heavy naval guns, other naval gear and thirty of Germany&#x27;s latest warplanes, including the Bf 109 fighter, Bf 110 fighter and Ju 88 bomber. The Soviets would also receive oil and electric equipment, locomotives, turbines, generators, diesel engines, ships, machine tools and samples of Germany artillery, tanks, explosives, chemical-warfare equipment and other items. The Soviets also helped Germany to avoid British naval blockades by providing a submarine base, Basis Nord, in the northern Soviet Union near Murmansk. This also provided a refueling and maintenance location, and a takeoff point for raids and attacks on shipping.

===Soviet war with Finland===

The last negotiations with Finland had been initiated by the Soviet side as part of its collective security policy in April 1938, and aimed to reach an understanding and to secure a favorable Finnish position in case of a German attack on the Soviet Union through Finnish territory, but this had proven futile due to the Finnish reluctance to break its neutrality, and negotiations ended in April 1939, shortly before Litvinov&#x27;s dismissal. On October 13, 1939, new negotiations started in Moscow, and the Soviet Union (represented by Stalin, Molotov, and Vladimir Potyomkin) presented Finland with proposals including a mutual assistance pact, the lease of the military base of Hanko, and the cession of a 70 km-deep area on the Karelian Isthmus located immediately to the north of the city of Leningrad to the Soviet Union, in exchange for border lands further to the north. Finland, however, refused to accept the offer, withdrew from negotiations on November 7, 1939, and continued preparations for a possible Soviet invasion.

On November 26, the Soviet Union staged the shelling of Mainila near the border, accused Finnish troops of the provocation and requesting their withdrawal. In turn, on November 27 Finland requested a withdrawal of troops of both nations from the border area. On November 28, the Soviet Union denounced the 1932 Soviet-Finnish Non-Aggression Pact, and on November 29 broke off diplomatic relations with Finland. On November 30, 1939, forces of the USSR under the command of Kliment Voroshilov attacked Finland in what became known as the Winter War, starting with the invasion of Finnish Karelia and bombing civilian boroughs of Helsinki. On December 1, 1939, the puppet socialist government of the Finnish Democratic Republic was established under the auspices of the Soviet Union in the border town of Terijoki. On December 14 the Soviet Union was expelled from the League of Nations for waging a war of aggression. After presiding over the disastrous start of the campaign, and a disproportionally heavy death toll of Red Army soldiers, Voroshilov was replaced by Semyon Timoshenko as the commander of the front on January 7, 1940 (and four months later as People&#x27;s Commissar for Defense). In mid-February, 1940, Soviet troops finally managed to break through the Mannerheim Line, and Finland sought an armistice.

The Moscow Peace Treaty was signed on March 12, 1940, and at noon the following day the fighting ended. Finland ceded the Karelian Isthmus and Ladoga Karelia, part of Salla and Kalastajasaarento, and leased the Hanko naval base to the USSR, but remained a neutral state, albeit increasingly leaning toward Germany (see Interim Peace).

The consequences of the conflict were multiple: Although the Soviet Union gained new territories, the war pushed neutral Finland towards an accommodation with Nazi Germany. Furthermore, the invasion had revealed the striking military weaknesses of the Red Army. This prompted the Soviet Union to reorganize its military forces, but it also dealt yet another blow to the international prestige of the USSR.

As a result of having suffered disproportionately high losses compared to the Finnish troops — despite a fourfold Soviet superiority in troops and nearly absolute superiority in heavy weapons and aircraft — the Red Army appeared to be an easy target, which contributed to Hitler&#x27;s decision to plan an attack against the Soviet Union. Soviet official casualty counts in the war exceeded 200,000, while Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev later claimed the casualties may have been one million.

===Soviets take the three Baltic countries===

From the beginning, there was tension over the Soviets&#x27; moves in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, which were in the Soviet sphere of influence. All three governments were presented with Stalin&#x27;s ultimatums threatening with war, and had no other choice but to sign a so-called &quot;Treaty of defence and mutual assistance&quot; which permitted the Soviet Union to establish a number of military bases on their soil. Nazi Germany advised them to accept the conditions. The three Baltic countries acceded to the Soviet demands and signed the &quot;mutual assistance treaties&quot; on September 28, October 5, and October 10, 1939, respectively (for 10 years for Estonia and Latvia and 15 years for Lithuania). The tension included the internment of a submarine crew in the Orzeł incident. On October 18, October 29, and November 3, 1939, the first Soviet troops moved into the military bases in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania under the treaties.

The Soviet Union had expressed discontent with the three Baltic countries&#x27; leaning toward Britain and France, and the so-called Baltic Entente of 1934, which could have ostensibly been reoriented toward Germany, and later used it to accuse the Baltic governments of a violation of the &quot;mutual assistance treaties&quot; of the autumn of 1939. On May 25, 1940, after several Soviet soldiers had allegedly disappeared from Soviet garrisons in Lithuania, Molotov accused the city of Kaunas of provocations. On June 14, People&#x27;s Commissar of Defence Timoshenko ordered a complete blockade of Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. The Soviet air force shot down a Finnish passenger plane Kaleva heading from Tallinn towards Helsinki. Shortly before midnight, Molotov presented Lithuania with a ten-hour ultimatum, demanding the replacement of the Lithuanian government with a pro-Soviet one and free access for additional Soviet troops, threatening the country with immediate occupation otherwise.

Lithuanian President Antanas Smetona insisted on armed resistance, but was not supported by the military leadership, so Lithuania acceded to the ultimatum. The government was reshuffled and additional Soviet troops entered Lithuania. Vladimir Dekanozov was sent to Kaunas as the Soviet special envoy. The following night, Smetona fled to Germany (and later to Switzerland, and then to the United States). On June 16, Molotov presented similar ultimatums to Latvia and Estonia, citing Soviet concerns over the Baltic Entente, and they acceded as well. At the same time, the Wehrmacht started concentrating along the Lithuanian border.

In mid-June 1940, when international attention was focused on the German invasion of France, Soviet NKVD troops raided border posts in Lithuania, Estonia and Latvia. State administrations were liquidated and replaced by Soviet cadres; as a result, 34,250 Latvians, 75,000 Lithuanians and almost 60,000 Estonians were deported or killed. Elections were held with single pro-Soviet candidates listed for many positions, with resulting peoples assemblies immediately requested admission into the USSR, which was granted by the Soviet Union.

===Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina===

With France no longer in a position to be the guarantor of the status quo in Eastern Europe, and the Third Reich pushing Romania to make concessions to the Soviet Union, the Romanian government gave in, following Italy&#x27;s counsel and Vichy France&#x27;s recent example. (see Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina)

===August tensions===
The Finnish and Baltic invasions caused a deterioration of relations between Germany and the Soviet Union. Because of tensions caused by these invasions, Germany&#x27;s falling behind in deliveries of goods, and Stalin&#x27;s worries that Hitler&#x27;s war with the West might end quickly after France signed an armistice, in August 1940, the Soviet Union briefly suspended its deliveries under the German-Soviet Commercial Agreement. The suspension created significant resource problems for Germany. By the end of August, relations improved again.

===Soviet negotiations regarding joining the Axis===
After Germany entered a Tripartite Pact with Japan and Italy, in October 1940, Ribbentrop wrote to Stalin about &quot;the historical mission of the Four Powers – the Soviet Union, Italy, Japan and Germany – to adopt a long range-policy and to direct the future development of their peoples into the right channels by delimitation of their interests in a worldwide scale.&quot; Stalin replied, referencing entering an agreement regarding a &quot;permanent basis&quot; for their &quot;mutual interests.&quot; Stalin sent Molotov to Berlin to negotiate the terms for the Soviet Union to join the Axis and potentially enjoy the spoils of the pact.

Ribbentrop asked Molotov to sign another secret protocol with the statement: &quot;The focal point of the territorial aspirations of the Soviet Union would presumably be centered south of the territory of the Soviet Union in the direction of the Indian Ocean.&quot; Molotov took the position that he could not take a &quot;definite stand&quot; on this without Stalin&#x27;s agreement. In response to a written German draft four powers agreement, Stalin presented a written counterproposal, including the Soviets joining the four power Axis if Germany foreclosed acting in the Soviet&#x27;s sphere of influence. Germany never responded to the counterproposal.

===January 1941 Border and Commercial Agreement===

On January 10, 1941, Germany and the Soviet Union signed an agreement that settled several ongoing issues. The agreement formally set the border between Germany and the Soviet Union between the Igorka river and the Baltic Sea, It extended trade regulation of the 1940 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement until August 1, 1942, increased deliveries above the levels of year one of that agreement, settled trading rights in the Baltics and Bessarabia, calculated the compensation for German property interests in the Baltic States now occupied by the Soviets and other issues. It also covered the migration to Germany within two and a half months of ethnic Germans and German citizens in Soviet-held Baltic territories, and the migration to the Soviet Union of Baltic and &quot;White Russian&quot; &quot;nationals&quot; in German-held territories. Secret protocols in the new agreement stated that Germany would renounce its claims to one piece of Lithuanian territory in the &quot;Secret Additional Protocols&quot; of the German–Soviet Boundary and Friendship Treaty and would be paid 7.5 million dollars ().

The agreements provided the USSR with new weapons, while in return it provided Germany with a million tons of feed grains, nine hundred thousand tons of oil, half a million tons of phosphate, half a million tons of iron ore, plus chromium and other raw materials.

===Mid-1941 relations===
In an effort to demonstrate peaceful intentions toward Germany, on April 13, 1941, the Soviets signed a neutrality pact with Axis power Japan. While Stalin had little faith in Japan&#x27;s commitment to neutrality, he felt that the pact was important for its political symbolism, to reinforce a public affection for Germany.

Stalin felt that there was a growing split in German circles about whether Germany should initiate a war with the Soviet Union. Stalin did not know that Hitler had been secretly discussing an invasion of the Soviet Union since the summer of 1940, and that Hitler had ordered his military in late 1940 to prepare for war in the east regardless of the parties&#x27; talks of a potential Soviet entry as a fourth Axis power.

On 1 May 1941, German military delegation, including Ernst August Köstring and Hans Krebs, attended the Soviet military parade in Moscow in honour of International Workers&#x27; Day.

===Further development===
During 1940, Nazi Germany pursued its conquest of western Europe: On April 9, 1940, Germany invaded Denmark and Norway. On May 15, the Netherlands capitulated. By June 2, Germany had occupied Belgium. On June 14, Wehrmacht entered Paris. On June 22, France surrendered.

The British historians Alan S. Milward and W. Medicott show that Nazi Germany — unlike Imperial Germany — was prepared only for a short war (Blitzkrieg). According to Andreas Hillgruber, without the necessary supplies from the USSR and strategic security in the East, Germany could not have succeeded in the West. Had the Soviet Union joined the Anglo-French blockade, the German war economy would have soon collapsed. If Germany had been forced to rely on its own raw materials as of September 1939, those resources would have lasted a mere 9 to 12 months.

According to Mr. Rapoport, &quot;one of Stalin&#x27;s first gifts to the Nazis was to turn over some 600 German Communists, most of them Jews, to the Gestapo at Brest-Litovsk in German-occupied Poland.&quot; The Soviets also offered support to the Nazis in official statements: Joseph Stalin himself emphasized that it was the Anglo-French alliance that had attacked Germany, not the other way around, and Molotov claimed that Germany had made peace efforts, which had been turned down by &#x27;Anglo-French imperialists&#x27;.

By invading Poland and annexing the Baltic States, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union eliminated the buffer states between them and magnified the threat of war.

==&quot;Volksdeutsche&quot; in the Soviet Union==
Ethnic Germans in the Soviet Union of the 1920s enjoyed a certain degree of cultural autonomy, there were 8 national districts in Ukraine as well as a number in Russia proper and one each in Georgia and Azerbaijan and Volga German Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic (Volga German ASSR), schools and newspapers, in compliance with the policy of national delimitation in the Soviet Union.

In September 1929, discontented with the reintroduction of coercive grain requisitions and collectivization of agriculture, several thousand Soviet peasants of German descent (mostly Mennonites) convened in Moscow, demanding exit visas to emigrate to Canada, provoking a significant political scandal in Germany, which soured Soviet-German relations. The charity &quot;Brothers in Need&quot; was established in Germany to raise money for the Soviet Germans, President Paul von Hindenburg himself donated of his own money for that purpose. The Soviet government first permitted 5,461 Germans to emigrate, but then deported the remaining 9,730 back to their original places of residence. However, throughout 1930, efforts were still being made by the Soviet government to increase the number and quality of German national institutions in the Soviet Union.

The first mass arrests and show trials specifically targeting Soviet Germans (those who were considered counter-revolutionaries) occurred in the Soviet Union during the 1933 Ukrainian terror. However, with the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (b)&#x27;s decree of November 5, 1934, the domestic anti-German campaign assumed all-union dimensions.

In 1933–1934, a campaign was launched in Germany to help Soviet Volksdeutsche during the famine by sending food packets and money.

Deeply concerned over cross-border ethnic ties of national minorities (such as Germans, Poles, Finns), in 1934 the Soviet Union decided to create a new border security zone along its western border, and in 1935–1937 potentially disloyal nationalities (including German) were mostly (albeit not completely) deported from this strip of land to the inner parts of the Soviet Union by NKVD. German national institutions were gradually abolished.

In 1937–1938 NKVD conducted mass operations &quot;for the destruction of espionage and sabotage contingents&quot; (known as National operations of NKVD) among diaspora nationalities against both Soviet and foreign citizens (resulting in arrest and usually execution), including an NKVD campaign against Germans, in fact indiscriminately targeting national minorities during the Great Terror. Concurrently all German and other diaspora national districts and schools in the Soviet Union except the Volga German ASSR and German schools within that republic were abolished.

The Soviet government had made a prior decision to evacuate the entire population of German origin in case of German invasion, which was immediately implemented after the actual invasion by forcibly transferring 1.2 million citizens of German origin from European Russia to Siberia and Soviet Central Asia.

==Aftermath==

===Hitler breaks the Pact===


Nazi Germany terminated the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact with its invasion of the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa on June 22, 1941. After the launch of the invasion, the territories that had been gained by the Soviet Union as a result of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact were lost in a matter of weeks. In the three weeks following the breaking of the Pact, the Soviet Union attempted to defend itself against vast German advances; in the process, the Soviet Union suffered 750,000 casualties, and lost 10,000 tanks and 4,000 aircraft. Within six months, the Soviet military had suffered 4.3 million casualties and the Germans had captured three million Soviet prisoners, two million of which would die in German captivity by February 1942. German forces had advanced 1,050 miles (1,690 kilometers), and maintained a linearly-measured front of 1,900 miles (3,058 kilometers).

===Denial of the Secret Protocol&#x27;s existence by the Soviet Union===

German officials found a microfilmed copy of the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact in 1945 and provided it to United States military forces. Despite publication of the recovered copy in western media, for decades it was the official policy of the Soviet Union to deny the existence of the secret protocol.

After the Baltic Way demonstrations of August 23, 1989, a Soviet commission concluded in December 1989 that the protocol had existed. In 1992, only after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the document itself was declassified.

===Post-war commentary regarding the timing of rapprochement===
After the war, historians have argued about the start of Soviet-German rapprochement. There are many conflicting points of view in historiography as to when the Soviet side began to seek rapprochement and when the secret political negotiations started.

Some scholars argue that for a long time the collective security doctrine was a sincere and unanimous position of the Soviet leadership, pursuing a purely defensive line, whereas others contend that from the very beginning the Soviet Union intended to cooperate with Nazi Germany, collective security being merely tactical counter to some unfriendly German moves. However, perhaps Moscow sought to avoid a great war in Europe because it was not strong enough to fight an offensive war; but there was much disagreement over the policy between Litvinov and Molotov about how to attain that goal, and Stalin alternated between their positions, initially pursuing both contradictory lines simultaneously quite early and abandoning collective security only at some point in 1939.

Nazi Germany started its quest for a pact with the Soviet Union at some point in the spring of 1939 in order to prevent an English–Soviet–French alliance and to secure Soviet neutrality in a future Polish–German war.

Some argue that the rapprochement could start as early as in 1935–1936, when Soviet trade representative in Berlin David Kandelaki made attempts at political negotiations on behalf of Stalin and Molotov, behind Litvinov&#x27;s back. Molotov&#x27;s speech to the Central Executive Committee of the Supreme Soviet in January 1936 is usually taken to mark this change of policy. Thus, Litvinov&#x27;s anti-German line did not enjoy unanimous support by the Soviet leadership long before his dismissal. Walter Krivitsky, an NKVD agent, who defected in the Netherlands in 1937, reported in his memoires in 1938 that already then Stalin had sought better relations with Germany. According to other historians, these were merely responses to German overtures for détente.

It is also possible that the change of foreign policy occurred in 1938, after the Munich Agreement, which became the final defeat of Litvinov&#x27;s anti-German policy of collective security, which was marked by the reported remark about an inevitable fourth partition of Poland made by Litvinov&#x27;s deputy Vladimir Potemkin in a conversation with French ambassador Robert Coulondre shortly thereafter.

The turn towards Germany could also have been made in early 1939, marked by Stalin&#x27;s speech to the 18th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in March 1939, shortly after the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, when he warned that the Western democracies were trying to provoke a conflict between Germany and the Soviet Union and declared the Soviet Union&#x27;s non-involvement in inter-capitalist quarrels, which is sometimes considered to have been a signal to Berlin.

According to others, the first sign of a Soviet–German political &quot;détente&quot; was the conversation between Soviet ambassador Aleksey Merekalov and Ernst von Weizsäcker, State Secretary in the German Foreign Ministry, on April 17, 1939, when the former hinted at possible improvement of the relations. This was followed by a series of perceived German signals of goodwill and the replacement of Litvinov with Molotov. According to Geoffrey Roberts, recently released documents from the Soviet diplomatic files show that western historians have been mistaken in assuming that the Merekalov-Weiszäcker meeting of April 1939 was the occasion for Soviet signals of a desire for détente with Nazi Germany. His point of view, supported by Derek Watson and Jonathan Haslam, is that it was not until the end of July 1939 – August 1939 that the policy change occurred and that it was a consequence rather than a cause of the breakdown of the Anglo-Soviet-French triple alliance negotiations. It must have been clear to Molotov and Stalin in August 1939, that an agreement with Germany avoided an immediate war with that country and could satisfy Soviet territorial ambitions in eastern Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, and Bessarabia; whereas an alliance with Britain and France offered no territorial gains and risked a war with Germany in which the USSR was most likely to bear the brunt of a German attack.

<text>The 69th Street station (also known as the 69th Street–Fisk Avenue station) is a local station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway. Located at 69th Street and Roosevelt Avenue in the Woodside, Queens, it is served by the 7 train at all times.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The 1913 Dual Contracts called for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) to build new lines in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Queens did not receive many new IRT and BRT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city&#x27;s Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding in the other two boroughs first before building in Queens, which was relatively undeveloped. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, along with the Astoria Line; it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens&#x27;s oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of the line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.

The Flushing Line was opened from Queensboro Plaza to Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street–Corona Plaza) on April 21, 1917, with a local station at 69th Street.

=== Later years ===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. On October 17, 1949, the joint BMT/IRT operation of the Flushing Line ended, and the line became the responsibility of the IRT. After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the station were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars. With the opening of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, trains were lengthened to eleven cars.

As part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program, the MTA announced plans to renovate the 52nd, 61st, 69th, 82nd, 103rd and 111th Streets stations, a project that had been delayed for several years. Conditions at these stations were reported to be among the worst of all stations in the subway system. The Manhattan-bound platform at the 69th Street station will close for renovation starting winter 2025, followed by the closure of the Flushing-bound platform.

==Station layout==
This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is used by the peak direction express service during rush hours. The extreme north (geographical east) end of the northbound platform is a closed work stair leading to a storage area below the tracks.

Both platforms have beige windscreens and brown canopies with green support frames and columns in the center and black, waist-high, steel fences at either ends. Black lampposts are at the un-canopied sections at regular intervals and the station signs are in the standard black name plate in white lettering.

The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway passes under the IRT Flushing Line just east of the station. There were formerly crossovers and switches between this station and 61st Street–Woodside. They were removed in 2008 and replaced with crossovers on either side of 74th Street–Broadway. The new crossovers are set up in such a way that trains going in either direction on the express track can stop at 74th Street.

Under the elevated structure of the Flushing Line directly east of the station and the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and two tracks of the New York Connecting Railroad, which is used for freight by CSX, Canadian Pacific, and Providence and Worcester Railroad.

===Exits===
This station has one elevated station house beneath the center of the platforms and tracks. Two staircases from the street, one at the northeast corner of 69th Street and Roosevelt Avenue and the other at the southwest corner, go up to the mezzanine, where there is a token booth at the center and a turnstile bank at either ends. Both turnstile banks lead to a waiting area/crossunder and have one staircase going up to each platform.

<text>Laurence J. Kenny (not Father Lawrence Kenny (August 19, 1896 - January 1977)

Father Laurence J. Kenny (October 12, 1864 Zaleski, Vinton County, OH, - December 28, 1958 Lemay, St. Louis County, MO), the son of Thomas Kenny and Margaret Hayes both from Ireland. Father Laurence J. Kenny was a Roman Catholic Jesuit priest who was the confessor to the exorcist Father William S. Bowdern.

Page 49 of Thomas Allen&#x27;s &quot;Possessed&quot; Father Raymond Bishop &quot;sought out Father Laurence J. Kenny, S.J., a man renowned for his warmth and wisdom. Kenny, who was in his nineties, had only recently retired as a professor of history. He was the confessor to many of the priests in the Jesuit community at the university.&quot; 
He spent his adolescence studying at Saint Joseph&#x27;s College in Bardstown, Kentucky, and Saint Xavier College in Cincinnati, Ohio until he entered the Jesuit novitiate at Florissant in 1883, at the age of 18. His period of religious formation included several years studying philosophy and science in Woodstock, Maryland, until 1890, when he began to teach at Saint Ignatius College in Chicago. He returned to Saint Louis to attend Saint Louis University and obtain his master&#x27;s degree in 1895. In 1896, he studied for a time at Creighton University in Omaha, Nebraska before studying theology at the Saint Ignatius Mission in Montana, a mission founded by Jesuit Peter J. De Smet.

Ordained in 1900, he was one of the first to be ordained in Saint Francis Xavier (College) Church at Saint Louis University. Aside from a brief six-year stint teaching at the University of Detroit, he spent most of his adult life teaching history at the University, also serving at various times as registrar, prefect of discipline, and director of the history department. He possessed a great interest in the history of the University, and in genealogical research

Fr. Kenny spent the last year of his life at Mount Saint Rose Hospital where he died of coronary thrombosis from which he suffered for 8 years. He first was buried at St. Stanislaus Seminary Cemetery in Florissant, MO. After the seminary was sold his remains was removed to Calvary Cemetery, St. Louis City,

<doc id="865838" wikidata="Q2061415" url="?curid=865838" title="52nd Street station (IRT Flushing Line)">
<text>The 52nd Street station (also known as the 52nd Street–Lincoln Avenue station) is a local station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of 52nd Street and Roosevelt Avenue in Woodside, Queens, it is served by the 7 train at all times.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The 1913 Dual Contracts called for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) to build new lines in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Queens did not receive many new IRT and BRT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city&#x27;s Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding in the other two boroughs first before building in Queens, which was relatively undeveloped. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, along with the Astoria Line; it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens&#x27;s oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of the line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.

The Flushing Line was opened from Queensboro Plaza to Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street–Corona Plaza) on April 21, 1917, with a local station at 52nd Street.

=== Later years ===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. On October 17, 1949, the joint BMT/IRT operation of the Flushing Line ended, and the line became the responsibility of the IRT. After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the station were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars. With the opening of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, trains were lengthened to eleven cars.

As part of the 2015–2019 Capital Program, the MTA announced plans to renovate the 52nd, 61st, 69th, 82nd, 103rd and 111th Streets stations, a project that had been delayed for several years. Conditions at these stations were reported to be among the worst of all stations in the subway system. The Manhattan-bound platform at the 52nd Street station will close for renovation starting winter 2025, followed by the closure of the Flushing-bound platform.

==Station layout==
This elevated station has two side platforms and three tracks. The center express track is used by the rush hour peak direction &lt;7&gt; express train. Both platforms have beige windscreens and brown canopies with green roofs along the entire length except for a small section at the south end, which has only a windscreen on the eastbound side and a waist-high steel fence on the westbound side.

This is the southernmost (geographical west) station on the IRT Flushing Line that is on a steel viaduct above Roosevelt Avenue. West of this station, the line curves and becomes a concrete viaduct above Queens Boulevard until 32nd Place.

===Exits===
This station has two entrances. The full-time one is a wooden elevated station house beneath the tracks at the south end. It has a single staircase to each platform, waiting area that allows free transfer between directions, turnstile bank, token booth, and two staircases to the street, one to each western corner of 52nd Street and Roosevelt Avenue.

The other entrance is at the station&#x27;s extreme north (geographical east) end. A single canopied staircase from each platform goes down a landing outside of a now-closed elevated station house beneath the tracks. A single HEET turnstile provides entrance/exit from the station before a street stair goes down 53rd Street and Roosevelt Avenue. The Manhattan-bound staircase is at the northeast corner while the Flushing-bound one is at the southeast corner.

<doc id="865848" wikidata="Q722407" url="?curid=865848" title="Edmond de la Fontaine">
<text>Edmond de la Fontaine (24 July 1823 – 24 June 1891), better known by his pen name of Dicks, was a Luxembourgish jurist, poet, and lyricist, known for his work in the Luxembourgish language. He is considered the national poet of Luxembourg, and along with Michel Lentz and Michel Rodange, one of the most important figures in the history of Luxembourgish literature. In addition, his &quot;Luxemburger Sitten und Bräuche&quot; was one of the most influential early ethnographies on the Luxembourgish people.

Fontaine was the third son of Gaspard-Théodore-Ignace de la Fontaine, who was appointed Governor of Luxembourg in 1841, and subsequently served as the country&#x27;s first Prime Minister in 1848. Fontaine studied law at Liège, and spent a further year at Heidelberg pursuing Germanic studies from 1844 until 1847, before becoming a lawyer in 1850. Fontaine was not a skilled speaker, and this may be the reason why he later left the bar and became a deputy judge, then worked as an office manager for the railways. In 1858, he opened a weaving business, employing 60 workers in Remich. From 1867 until 1870, he served as mayor of Stadtbredimus, in eastern Luxembourg&#x27;s Moselle Valley, and served as a Justice of the Peace in Vianden from 1881 and 1889. He lived in Stadtbredimus Castle from 1858 to 1881 where he would live for the last decade of his life.

<text>The 46th Street–Bliss Street station (announced as the 46th Street station on trains) is a local station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway. Located at the intersection of 46th Street and Queens Boulevard in Sunnyside, Queens, it is served by the 7 train at all times.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The 1913 Dual Contracts called for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) to build new lines in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Queens did not receive many new IRT and BRT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city&#x27;s Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding in the other two boroughs first before building in Queens, which was relatively undeveloped. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, along with the Astoria Line; it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens&#x27;s oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of the line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.

The Flushing Line was opened from Queensboro Plaza to Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street–Corona Plaza) on April 21, 1917, with a local station at 46th Street.

=== Later years ===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. On October 17, 1949, the joint BMT/IRT operation of the Flushing Line ended, and the line became the responsibility of the IRT. After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the station were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars. With the opening of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, trains were lengthened to eleven cars.

The present-day 33rd, 40th, and 46th Streets were originally respectively known as Rawson, Lowery, and Bliss Streets until the 1930s, when they were given numbered street names. 46th Street was named after early ferry operator and industrialist Neziah Bliss, whose other namesakes include the nearby neighborhood of Blissville. To avoid confusion, the 33rd Street–Rawson Street, 40th Street–Lowery Street, and 46th Street–Bliss Street stations displayed both the new and old names of the respective street. Since a New York City Transit Authority rule prohibited subway stations from being named after nonexistent streets, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) removed the old names of each street from station signs and subway maps in 1998. Local residents opposed the renaming and unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the MTA to restore the old names. The New York City Council passed a law in July 2003, giving both the old and new names to all three streets; after new street signs were installed in September 2003, the MTA agreed to restore the old names of each station. The MTA renamed the station in 2004.

In December 2019, the MTA announced that this station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency&#x27;s 2020–2024 Capital Program. A request for proposals was put out on May 18, 2023 for the contract for a project bundle to make 13 stations accessible, including 46th Street. The contract to add two elevators at the station was awarded in December 2023.

==Station layout==
This elevated station has three tracks and two side platforms. The center track is used by the rush hour peak direction &lt;7&gt; express train. This is the easternmost (railroad north) station on the IRT Flushing Line&#x27;s concrete viaduct above Queens Boulevard. East of here, the line curves north and becomes elevated over Roosevelt Avenue.

Each platform has concrete windscreens painted in beige and green canopies in the center and waist-high beige barriers at either side. The windscreens contain stained glass windows as part of an artwork called &quot;Q is For Queens&quot; by Yumi Heo installed in 1999. They depict various images related to Heo&#x27;s children book illustrations. This can also be found on the station&#x27;s main entrance.

===Exits===

This station has two entrances/exits, both of which are station houses built within the viaduct&#x27;s concrete structure. The main one is at the west (geographic south) end of the station and has two staircases and one turnstile bank to each platform, token booth, and four street stairs built within the viaduct&#x27;s support pillars. These stairs lead to all four corners of 46th Street and the parking lot underneath the viaduct and between the two sides of Queens Boulevard. This entrance does not allow a free transfer between directions (even though it has the layout that could allow one as both turnstile banks lead to the center of the station house).

The station&#x27;s other entrance is unstaffed, containing just HEET and exit-only turnstiles, two staircases to each platform, and two street stairs, also built within the support pillars, going down to either western corners of 47th Street and the parking lot. This entrance has a waiting area that allows a free transfer between directions.

<text>The Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort, commonly known as Fallsview Casino, is a resort casino in Niagara Falls, Ontario, Canada. It opened publicly on June 10, 2004. The $1 billion complex overlooks the Horseshoe Falls and is one of the most prominent features of the Niagara skyline. The complex is owned by the Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corporation and operated by Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment.

==History==
Planning began in February 1998 – Falls Management Group L.C. selected to develop new casino resort. The casino was built on a site that was once the transformer station building for the Ontario Power Company at the foot of Horseshoe Falls. Prior to the casino&#x27;s construction, the site was also occupied by the Canadian Pacific Railway Montrose Subdivision.

Construction began in 2001 and the resort opened on June 10, 2004.

On June 11, 2019, the day-to-day operations of Fallsview and Casino Niagara were assumed by Mohegan Gaming and Entertainment–an affiliate of the Mohegan Tribe, and owner of the Mohegan Sun in Uncasville, Connecticut—under a 21-year agreement with OLG. It marked the company&#x27;s first Canadian properties.

In August 2022, the resort opened a new 5,000-seat concert hall, branded as the OLG Stage. The $130 million hall was originally scheduled to open in 2020, but its opening was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and all other shows scheduled for it were either cancelled or moved to the existing Avalon Theatre until the venue could be finalized.

Beginning with its 2022 revival, Citytv has filmed its reality competition series &quot;Canada&#x27;s Got Talent&quot; at the Fallsview, with the second season filmed entirely at the Avalon Theatre, and its third moving to the OLG Stage.

==Grounds==
The casino resort complex takes up . The resort includes a casino that holds over 130 gaming tables, including poker tables; and over 3,500 slot machines. Additionally, the resort includes 18 restaurants, a shopping centre with 30 shops, one nightclub, a fitness spa, and a hotel with 372 rooms and suites.

The resort includes two performance venues, the 1,500-seat Avalon Theatre, and the 5,000-seat OLG Stage.

The east façade of the complex retains the walls of the terrace and front entrance of the transformer station built in 1904. The area where the transformers resided is now the Grand Hall convention halls.

At the main entrance is a water feature called &#x27;The Teslatron&#x27;. In its first few years of operation, it held night screenings with sound and lighting, but that has stopped in the last few years. At street level there is a fountain that varies its height with the wind so as not to wet pedestrians and passing cars. The resort also includes a parking lot with 3,000 spaces.

The 1999 artwork featured at the station is called &quot;Q is for Queens&quot; by Yumi Heo.

===Exit===
The exit is under the tracks in the median of Queens Boulevard. The exit is at 40th Street with two stairs from each platform. Since fare control is on different sides of the exit, there is no free transfer between directions, although the station&#x27;s layout could allow one. This makes the station one of only two stations along the 7 (the other being Vernon Boulevard–Jackson Avenue) to not have a crossover or crossunder, as well as the only elevated station on the line that does not allow for free transfers between directions.

<text>The Olympiastadion (), also known in English as the Berlin Olympic Stadium or simply the Olympic Stadium, is a sports stadium at Olympiapark Berlin in Berlin, Germany. It was originally designed by Werner March for the 1936 Summer Olympics. During the Olympics, the record attendance was thought to be over 100,000.

Since renovations in 2004, the Olympiastadion has a permanent capacity of 74,475 seats and is the largest stadium in Germany for international football matches. The Olympiastadion is a UEFA category four stadium.

Besides its use as an athletics stadium, the arena has built a footballing tradition. Since 1963, it has been the home of the Hertha BSC. It hosted three matches in the 1974 FIFA World Cup. It was renovated for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, when it hosted six matches, including the final. The DFB-Pokal final match is held each year there since 1985. The Olympiastadion Berlin served as a host for the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup as well as the 2015 UEFA Champions League final.

It hosted six games in UEFA Euro 2024, including the final.

==History==
===1916–1934: Deutsches Stadion===

During the 1912 Summer Olympics, the city of Berlin was designated by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to host the 1916 Summer Olympics. Germany&#x27;s proposed stadium for this event was to be located in Charlottenburg, in the Grunewald Forest, to the west of Berlin—thus the stadium was also known as &quot;Grunewaldstadion&quot;. A horse racing-course already existed there which belonged to the Berliner Rennverein, and even today the old ticket booths survive on the current Jesse-Owens-Allee. The government of Germany decided not to build in the nearby Grunewald forest, or to renovate buildings that already existed. Because of this desire, they hired the same architect who originally had built the &quot;Rennverein&quot;, Otto March.

March decided to build the stadium under the ground (&quot;Erdstadion&quot;, in German). However, the 1916 Olympic Games were cancelled due to World War I. In the 1920s the first buildings of a school, the &quot;Deutsches Sportforum&quot; (German Sport Forum), dedicated to the teaching of professors of physical education and the study of sport science were built northeast of the stadium site. From 1926 to 1929, Otto March&#x27;s sons (Werner and Walter) were assigned to build an annex for these institutions, though the finalization was delayed until 1936.

===1936–1945: Olympiastadion===
In 1931, the International Olympic Committee selected Berlin to host the 11th Summer Olympics. Originally, the German government decided merely to restore the earlier Olympiastadion of 1916, with Werner March again retained to do this.

When the Nazi Party won the election in Germany in 1933, they decided to use the Olympic Games to build a new stadium and Olympic Complex for Berlin in 1936. Fuhrer and Reich Chancellor Adolf Hitler ordered the construction of a great sports complex in Grunewald named the &quot;Reichssportfeld&quot; with a new Olympiastadion. Architect Werner March remained in charge of the project, assisted by his brother Walter. When the complex was built it was owned by the Hohenzollern Royal Family (Constitutional Monarchy of Germany), who retained ownership after the games.

Construction took place from 1934 to 1936. When the Reichssportfeld was finished, it was . It consisted of (east to west): the Olympiastadion, the Maifeld (Mayfield, capacity of 50,000) and the Waldbühne amphitheatre (capacity of 25,000), in addition to various places, buildings and facilities for different sports (such as football, swimming, equestrian events, and field hockey) in the northern part.

Werner March built the new Olympiastadion on the foundation of the original Deutsches Stadion, once again with the lower half of the structure recessed below ground level.

The capacity of the Olympiastadion reached 110,000 spectators. It also possessed a VIP stand. At its end, aligned with the symmetrically designed layout of the buildings of the Olympischer Platz and toward the Maifeld, was the Marathon Gate with a big receptacle for the Olympic Flame. 

====Maifeld====

The Maifeld (Mayfield) was created as a huge lawn (11.2 hectares, 28 acres) for gymnastic demonstrations, specifically annual May Day celebrations by the government. The area was surrounded by 19 metres of land elevation (62 ft), even though the Olympiastadion (to the east) was only 17 metres (55 ft) high. The total capacity was 250,000 people, with 60,000 in the large stands that extended at the west end.

Also located there were the Langemarck-Halle (below) and the Bell Tower (rising high). The walls were built with sturdy stone from the area of the Lower Alps, and also feature equine sculptures (work of Josef Wackerle). This consisted of huge halls built under the stands of the Maifeld. Pillars were raised on which hung flags and shields commemorating all the forces that participated in a battle fought in Langemark (West Flanders, Belgium) on 10 November 1914, during the First World War. Since 2006, the ground floor is home to a public exhibit providing historical information on the area of the former Reichssportfeld.

During the 1936 Olympics, the Maifeld was used for polo and equestrian dressage events.

After the Second World War, the occupying forces of the British Army (Berlin Infantry Brigade) annually celebrated the King&#x27;s or Queen&#x27;s Official Birthday on the Maifeld and used it for a variety of sporting activities including cricket. Starting in 2012, Maifeld became home to the cricket clubs of Berlin.

====Bell Tower====
The Bell Tower crowned the western end of the Reichssportfeld planted amid the tiers of the Maifeld stands. It was 77 metres (247 ft) high. From its peak could be observed the whole city of Berlin. During the games, it was used as an observation post by administrators, police officials, doctors, and the media.

In the tower was the Olympic Bell. On its surface were the Olympic rings with an eagle, the year 1936, the Brandenburg Gate, the date 1–16 August in German, a motto between two swastikas: &quot;I call the youth of the world&quot; also in German, and &quot;11. Olympic Games Berlin&quot; – although the games were the 10th (Summer) Olympics, they were the Games of the XI Olympiad.

The Bell Tower was the only part of the Reichssportfeld that was destroyed in the war. The Third Reich used the tower&#x27;s structure to store archives (such as films). The Soviet troops set its contents on fire, turning the tower into a makeshift chimney. The structure emerged from the fire severely damaged and weakened.

In 1947, the British engineers demolished the tower; however, it was reconstructed accurately in 1962. The Olympic Bell (which had survived the fire and remained in its place in the tower) fell 77 metres and cracked and has been incapable of sounding since then. In 1956, the bell was rescued, only to be used as a practice target for shooting with anti-tank ammunition. The damaged old bell survives and serves as a memorial.

The recreation of the tower was carried out from 1960 to 1962, once again by the architect Werner March, following the original blueprints. The present tower became an important tourist destination offering a panorama of Berlin, Spandau, the Havel Valley, Potsdam, Nauen and Hennigsdorf.

The most significant battle around the Olympiastadion was in April 1945 when the Soviet army fought to capture it. This was during the final battle of the Second World War in Europe, with the total invasion of Berlin as the Allies&#x27; target. The Olympiastadion survived the war almost untouched; it only suffered the impact of machine gun shots.

===1945–1990: West Berlin era===

After the war, the former &quot;Reichssportfeld&quot; became the headquarters of the British military occupation forces. The administration settled in the northeastern buildings designed by the March brothers in the 1920s, which the Third Reich had used for official sport organisations such as the Reich Academy of Physical Training and extended by 1936, adding the &quot;Haus des deutschen Sports&quot; (House of German Sports) and other buildings (which belong since 1994 to the Olympiapark Berlin, a central sporting facility of the City of Berlin). Soon, the British forces renovated war-damaged buildings but also converted interiors to their specific needs (one gymnasium was converted into a dining hall, another into a garage). From 1951 to 2005, the Olympischer Platz had a giant antenna transmitting for all the portable radios in Berlin.

From then until 1994 and their departure, British forces held an annual celebration of the Queen&#x27;s Official Birthday in the Maifeld with thousands of spectators from Berlin present. During the 1960s, American military and high school football teams introduced hundreds of thousands of Berliners to American football at the stadium in exhibition games.

During those years, Bundesliga football matches were played in the Olympiastadion, with Hertha BSC as the local team. In the Maifeld, several competitions of football, rugby and polo were staged too. In the summers, the Waldbühne resumed its classical music concerts, and playing movies. The theatre was also used as an improvised ring for boxing matches.

===1990–2004: Reunified Berlin===

In 1998, Berliners debated the destiny of the Olympiastadion in light of the legacy it represented for Germany. Some wanted to tear the stadium down and build a new one from scratch, while others favoured letting it slowly crumble &quot;like the Colosseum in Rome&quot;. Finally, it was decided to renovate the Olympiastadion.

FIFA chose it as one of the venues of the 2006 FIFA World Cup. The State of Berlin hired a consortium composed of Walter Bau AG and &quot;DYWIDAG&quot; that won the €45 million franchise. The consortium took charge of the operation of the facilities together with Hertha BSC and the Government of Berlin after the remodelling. On 3 July 2000, the renovation began with a ceremony presided over by the Chancellor Gerhard Schröder, accompanied by Eberhard Diepgen (Mayor of Berlin), Franz Beckenbauer and Prof. Dr. Ignaz Walter.

===2004–present: Multi-purpose arena===
The re-inauguration celebrations of the new Olympiastadion were carried out on 31 July 2004, and 1 August 2004. On that day, Saturday, the party began with performances from Pink, Nena and Daniel Barenboim. It culminated at night with the opening ceremony. On day two, friendly matches were played between different categories of the club Hertha BSC and visiting teams. On 8 September 2004, Brazil played Germany.

From 2003 to 2007, the stadium was home to the Berlin Thunder.

In 2011, the venue hosted the World Culture Festival organized by the Art of Living where 70,000 people meditated for peace.

In 2018, the venue hosted the 2018 European Athletics Championships.

In 2024, the venue hosted the UEFA Euro 2024 final.

In 2025, the venue will host the NFL International Series between the Indianapolis Colts and a team to be determined.

==Renovation==
With the intention of creating a more intimate atmosphere for football games, the playing field was lowered by . Approximately of sand was excavated. The lower tier of seating in the stadium was demolished and rebuilt at a completely different angle of inclination.

The roof was extended to cover a total of , with 20 roof-supporting columns carrying a weight of of steel. The roof rises over the seats and is made up of transparent panels that allow sunlight to stream in during the day. The western portion (on the Marathon Arch) is open to reveal the Bell Tower to the spectators.

The conservation factor of the Olympiastadion as a historical monument was also considered, especially with respect to the preservation of the natural stone blocks. After criticisms, the colour of the athletics track around the game field was changed from red to blue, reflecting the colours of Hertha BSC.

The renovations used of concrete and of pre-cast reinforced concrete elements. Some of concrete was demolished and removed and of natural stone was refurbished.

The Olympiastadion was equipped with the latest technology in artificial illumination and sound equipment. It has 113 VIP stands, a set of restaurants, and two underground garages (for 630 cars). The total cost of the remodelling and amplification was €242 million.

==Capacity==
The new Olympiastadion has the highest all-seated capacity in Germany. It has a permanent capacity of 74,475 seats. The upper tier has 31 seating rows at an average slope of 23° and houses 36,455 seats, of which 36,032 are regular seats, 290 are seats on the press stand and 133 are seats in skyboxes. The lower tier has 42 seating rows at an average angle of 25.4° and houses 38,020 seats, of which 32,310 are regular seats, 560 are box seats, 563 are lounge seats (expandable to 743), 4,413 are business seats, and 174 are wheelchair spaces.

For some football matches, such as those between Hertha BSC and FC Bayern München, the capacity can be temporarily expanded by the addition of a mobile grandstand over the Marathon Arch. The extended capacity reached 76,197 seats in 2014.

The only stadiums in Germany with higher total capacities are the Signal Iduna Park in Dortmund and the Allianz Arena in Munich. However, the Signal Iduna Park and the Allianz Arena have both seating and standing areas and their all-seated capacities are lower than that of the Olympiastadion. The total capacity of the Allianz Arena is also lower than the extended capacity of the Olympiastadion.

==Tenant==
The stadium has been used as the home venue for the 2. Bundesliga club Hertha Berlin since 1963. In 1963, the Bundesliga was formed, and Hertha BSC participated by direct invitation, leaving its old stadium (the &quot;Plumpe&quot;) to use the Olympiastadion. On 24 August, it played the first local match against 1. FC Nürnberg, with the final score 1–1. However, in 1965, the German Football Association found Hertha BSC guilty of bribery and relegated them to the Regionalliga Berlin.

In 1968, Hertha returned to the first division, and to the Olympiastadion, and in 1971 sold the &quot;Plumpe&quot;. The second half of the 1970s was quite successful for Hertha BSC. In 1979, it reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Cup, but was defeated by Red Star Belgrade. Hertha reached the finals of the German Cup twice (1977 and 1979). In the 1980s, Hertha had a declining time in the Bundesliga, and fell into the Amateur-Oberliga Berlin in 1986. They moved to the smaller Poststadion. Hertha recovered, and joined the 2. Bundesliga for the 1988–89 season, and returned to the Olympiastadion. Other teams have also used the Olympiastadion, like Tasmania, Tennis Borussia and Blau-Weiß 90 when they played in the Bundesliga. 1. FC Union Berlin played four home matches during the 2021–22 UEFA Europa Conference League at the Olympiastadion and the home matches in the 2023–24 UEFA Champions League, both due to the Stadion An der Alten Försterei not being up to UEFA&#x27;s Stadium Specifications.

When the Olympiastadion was not picked to host matches for the UEFA Euro 1988 because of West Berlin&#x27;s controversial status, the stadium held a Four Nations Tournament instead, and the DFB-Pokal final was awarded to Berlin for five years. It has been held there permanently since 1985. The stadium also hosted the women&#x27;s DFB-Pokal finals from 1985 to 2009.

With the demolition of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, a spontaneous feeling of sympathy between Hertha and 1. FC Union Berlin from East Berlin arose, which culminated in a friendly match at the Olympiastadion with 50,000 spectators (27 January 1990). In 1990, Hertha returned to the Bundesliga, although they fell again to the 2. Bundesliga from 1991 until 1997.

Since 1997, the club has improved, climbing up the Bundesliga table and qualifying for the UEFA Champions League, with matches against top European teams like Chelsea and AC Milan.

==Notable events==

The Olympiastadion held the world record for the attendance of a baseball game during the 1936 Olympics thought to be over 100,000.

The stadium hosted five American Bowls between 1990 and 1994. The stadium was also home to Berlin Thunder, an American football team in NFL Europe, from 2003 until the league&#x27;s operator, the U.S. National Football League, closed down the money-losing competition in 2007. The NFL would return to the stadium in 2025 for the NFL International Series, the first regular season game in Berlin between the Indianapolis Colts and a team to be determined. 

The stadium also hosted The World Culture Festival. 2011 was to celebrate 30 years of service to humanity by Art of Living Foundation.

The stadium also hosts the annual Internationales Stadionfest since 1937, which served as an IAAF Golden League event until 2010.

The stadium hosted the 2009 World Championships in Athletics where Usain Bolt broke the 100 metres and 200 metres world records.

===1936 Summer Olympics===
On 1 August 1936, the Olympics were officially inaugurated by the head of state Adolf Hitler, and the Olympic cauldron was lit by athlete Fritz Schilgen. Four million tickets were sold for all the events of the 1936 Summer Olympics. This was also the first Olympics with television transmission (25 viewing spaces were scattered all over Berlin and Potsdam) and radio transmissions in 28 languages (with 20 radio vans and 300 microphones).

While the Olympic flame had been used for the first time in Amsterdam in 1928, in Berlin 1936 a marathon-like tour of the Olympic torch was introduced, from Olympia in Greece, crossing six frontiers with a journey of to Berlin, through Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, Austria and Germany. The original idea of this Olympic torch relay was Carl Diem&#x27;s, who was a political advisor to Propaganda Minister Joseph Goebbels, specialising in Olympic affairs. The Olympics were the subject of the propaganda film &quot;Olympia&quot; (1938) by Leni Riefenstahl.

Among the sport competitions, one of the most memorable events was the performance of the African-American track and field athlete Jesse Owens, representing the United States of America. Owens won the gold medal in the 100, 200, long jump and 4 x 100 relay. One of the main streets outside the stadium is named Jesse Owens Allee in recognition of his performance. The stadium also hosted the equestrian jumping, football, and handball events.

===1974 FIFA World Cup Group A===
Three matches from Group A (West Germany, Chile, East Germany and Australia) were played in the Olympiastadion. The third match, Australia vs Chile, was played in torrential rain. The historic match between the two German teams, however, was played in Hamburg. The hosts, West Germany, won the tournament.

<text>Salsette Island (, , Sashti) is an island in Konkan division of the state of Maharashtra, along India&#x27;s west coast. Administratively known as the Mumbai Suburban district, Mira Bhayander and a portion of Thana (Thane) lie on it; making it very populous and one of the most densely populated islands in the world. It has a population of more than 20 million inhabitants living on an area of about .

==Location==
Salsette is bounded on the north by Vasai Creek, on the northeast by the Ulhas River, on the east by Thane Creek and Mumbai Harbour, and on the south and west by the Arabian Sea. The original seven islands of Mumbai, which were merged by land reclamation during the 19th and early 20th centuries to form the city of Mumbai, are now practically a southward protruding peninsula of the much larger Salsette Island.

The island of Trombay that was to the southeast of Salsette is today part of Salsette as much of the intervening swamps have been reclaimed. It contains Sanjay Gandhi National Park, also known as Borivali National Park. The city of Thane is at the northeastern corner, on Thane Creek, while the western suburbs of Mumbai which stretches from Bhayandar in the northwest corner to Bandra which lies just before the Mumbai City district lies on its western side while the eastern suburbs of Mumbai that stretches from Thane to Kurla lies on the eastern half of the island. Both suburbs are separated by the Borivali National Park till the neighbourhood of Powai in Andheri. Politically, the Mumbai City district covers the peninsula south of Mahim and Sion while most of the original island constitutes the Mumbai Suburban district. The northern portion lies within Thane district, which extends across Thane creeks onto the mainland.

==History==


The word &quot;Sasashti&quot; (also shortened to &quot;Sashti&quot;) is Maharashtri Konkani term for &quot;sixty-six&quot;, referring to the original &quot;sixty-six villages&quot; on the island. It was inhabited by (Aagri, Kunbi) farmers, agriculturists, (Bhandaris) toddy tappers, (Sutar, Malis) artisans and (Kolis) fisherfolk who trace their conversion to Christianity back to 55 AD with the arrival of Christ&#x27;s disciple, Bartholomew the Apostle, in north Konkan region. They were later converted to the Latin Church in India by four religious orders—the Dominicans, Franciscans, Augustinians &amp; Jesuits— who arrived in the 15th century with the Portuguese. These original inhabitants of Salsette are the Bombay East Indian Catholics, the Aagris &amp; Kolis.

109 Buddhist caves, including those at Kanheri, can be found on the island, and date from the end of the 2nd century. Salsette was ruled by a succession of Hindu kingdoms, the last of which were the Silharas and later the Marathas. In 1343, the islands were annexed by the Sultan of Guzerat. 

In 1534, the Portuguese empire seized the islands from Sultan Bahadur Shah. Sashti became part of the northern province of Portuguese India, which was governed from Vasai (Bassein) on the north shore of Bassein Creek. It was leased to the explorer Diogo Rodrigues from 25 October, 1535 to 1548. In 1554, the islands were handed over to Garcia de Orta, a renowned physician and botanist and the author of &quot;Colloquies on the Simples Drugs and Medical Matter of India&quot;, a seminal work on Indian Eastern medicine of its time.

Nine churches were built on Salsette island by the Portuguese; Nirmal (1557), Nossa Senhora dos Remédios (1557), Sandor (1566), Agashi (1568), Nandakal (1573), Papdy (1574), Pale (1595), Manickpur (1606), and Nossa Senhora das Mercês (1606). The St Andrews Church and the Mount St Mary&#x27;s Church in Bandra, the Cross at Cross Maidan, Gloria Church (1632) in Mazagaon and the remnants of a church in Santa Cruz are the sole places of worship that have survived to the 21st century.

In 1661, the seven Bombay (Mumbai) islets were ceded to Britain as part of the dowry of Catherine de Braganza to Charles II of England; while Salsette remained in Portuguese hands. Charles II in turn, leased the Bombay islets to the English East India Company in 1668 for £10 per year. The company found the deep harbour at Mumbai (Bombay) eminently apposite, and the population rose from 10,000 in 1661 to 60,000 by 1675. In 1687, the East India Company transferred their headquarters there from Surat. In 1737, the island was captured by Mahratta violence, all of the Portuguese northern province in India, except Damaon, Diu &amp; Silvassa, as it was frequently invaded by the Mahratta forces until 1739. Marquis de Pombal formally ceded what would become Greater Bombay, to Peshwa Balaji Bajirao of the Mahratta Confederacy in the 1750s.

The British occupied Salsette in 1774, and it was formally ceded to the East India Company in the 1782 Treaty of Salbai. In 1782, William Hornby, then Governor of Bombay Province, initiated the project of connecting the islets of Bombay. By 1845, the seven southern islands had been connected to form South Bombay, with an area of 435 km². Railway viaducts and causeways were built in the 19th century to connect Bombay Island to the mainland via Salsette. The channels separating Mumbai from Salsette and Trombay were bridged by the Sion Causeway in 1803. Accessibility considerably increased after construction of this causeway. Mahim and Bandra were connected by the Mahim Causeway in 1845. 

These railway lines and roads encouraged wealthier merchants to build villas on Salsette. By 1901, the population of Salsette had increased to 146,993 and the area began to be referred to as Greater Bombay.

==Geography==

Salsette is dominated by a central mass of hills surrounded by tidal flats. A number of much smaller islands lay on its western flank. These included Bandra, Khar Danda, Juhu (an old linear sand bar rising above sea level by just a metre or two), Versova, Marve Island, Dharavi Island and Rai Murdhe, all with a knoll core and fringing wave-cut platforms and sandy beaches. These islands seem to have remained separate until as late as 1808. 

At the time of writing of the old Gazetteer of Thana in 1882, these islands could be reached during low tides by walking across the tidal inlets in between, except for the island of Dharavi in present-day Gorai (not to be confused with the slum near Mahim), which had to be reached by a boat. These are no longer separate, being joined to Salsette via reclamation. The highest point is the conical peak of Kanheri (467 metres) in Borivali National Park on the northern reaches of the island. This national park is the world&#x27;s biggest within city limits.

===Geology===
The island is at the confluence of a number of fault lines. This makes the area earthquake-prone, up to a magnitude of 6. The island is mostly composed of black basalt rock. Since it is along the sea coast, it has a sandy belt on its western coast. The southern region of Old Mumbai is mostly at sea level. However, the parts which were erstwhile shallows are below sea level. Many parts of the city are hilly.

===Other natural formations===
====Lakes====
There are three major lakes on the island: Powai Lake, Tulsi Lake and Vihar Lake. The latter two supply part of Mumbai&#x27;s water requirements. Numerous other smaller ponds and lakes are present.

====Rivers====
The Mithi River (Mahim), Poisar River, Oshiwara River and Dahisar River originate in the national park and empty into the Arabian Sea. The Mithi River originates at Vihar Lake. Vasai and Thane creeks are estuarine distributaries of the Ulhas River.

====Creeks====
A number of saline or brackish creeks extend inland from the coastline. Mahim Creek separates the city from the suburbs in the west. Further north on the western coast, the Oshiwara river empties into Malad (or Marvé) Creek and the Dahisar River into Gorai Creek. The eastern waterfront also has many small creeks.

====Wetlands====
The small southern part of the eastern waterfront of Salsette forms Mumbai Harbour.

North of this region lie vast amounts of protected wetlands at Sewree, home to migratory birds. The northern and northwestern part of the island and parts of Mahim River have government-protected marshlands. These swampy regions form massive, dense mangrove forests.

<text>Kathleen Mary Margaret Bryant (8 March 1897 – 1 January 1988), known professionally as Margot Bryant, was an English stage and television actress best known for playing Minnie Caldwell in the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; from its inception in 1960 until her departure in 1976.

==Early life and career==
Bryant was born in Hull, the daughter of general practitioner Dr. William Arthur Bryant and Catherine Lewis. Bryant moved to London with her parents on completing her education. There, she became interested in theatre, and appeared in the chorus lines of various productions before moving on to musical comedies. She danced in Fred Astaire&#x27;s show &quot;Stop Flirting&quot;.

Bryant also appeared in a number of films, such as &quot;The Cure for Love&quot; (1949) and &quot;Beat Girl&quot; in 1960. She also appeared in a West End role, as Lucy in &quot;Gay&#x27;s the Word&quot; at the Saville Theatre. Bryant also toured in &quot;My Mother Said&quot; and later appeared in the show&#x27;s television production. She also appeared in &quot;The Bell Family&quot; and in films &quot;I Get Myself Arrested&quot; and &quot;The Large Rope&quot;.

===&quot;Coronation Street&quot;===
Bryant&#x27;s most notable role came later in life, playing the timid, elderly Minnie Caldwell in the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot;, a role she occupied from 1960 to 1976, over the course of 987 episodes. The character&#x27;s life tended to revolve around her ginger tomcat, Bobby. Caldwell was a diminutive figure, with a distracted manner and often appeared drinking milk stout in the snug of the soap&#x27;s public house, the Rovers Return Inn.

The character, consequently, was a put upon companion of her two friends, busybody Martha Longhurst (played by Lynne Carol) and battle-axe Ena Sharples (played by Violet Carson). On the formation of the trio, the show&#x27;s creator Tony Warren explained, &quot;I noticed that whenever you get tough, old viragos, they&#x27;ve got henchmen. Generally had a talkative one, who could be shouted down, and a silent one, who nodded but was a bit rebellious.&quot;

Bryant suffered severe memory loss in March 1976 and was unable to continue in the role; her penultimate episode involved her reading her lines off prompts and on props such as her handbag. Her final episode was broadcast in April 1976, with Minnie leaving the street to live with an old friend, Handel Gartside (played by Harry Markham), in Derbyshire. Bryant never returned to the programme and her character had died off-screen by 2008, when returning former character Jed Stone (played by Kenneth Cope) was seen visiting Minnie&#x27;s grave.

==Personal life and death==
Bryant was a dedicated performer, always insisting on high standards of professionalism and good manners. She was later distressed by her difficulty to remember her lines as her health deteriorated. She also suffered from depression. According to her co-star Betty Driver (who played Betty Turpin), Bryant &quot;was a little tinker&quot; who &quot;swore like a trooper&quot;. Driver, who was friends with both Doris Speed (Annie Walker) and Bryant, said that the pair &quot;were at each other&#x27;s throats all the time. Doris was staunch Labour and Margot was Tory.&quot; After Bryant had left &quot;Coronation Street&quot; and retired from acting, she went to live in a nursing home, where she was &quot;often visited&quot; by Driver and her sister Freda.

Bryant was later diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and admitted to Cheadle Royal Hospital in Heald Green, where she remained as an in-patient until her death on New Year&#x27;s Day 1988. She never married or had children, but had a love of cats. Bryant was close friends with fellow &quot;Coronation Street&quot; actress Eileen Derbyshire.

Bryant&#x27;s funeral was held at Manchester Crematorium on 11 January 1988, attended by members of the &quot;Coronation Street&quot; cast, including Thelma Barlow, Eileen Derbyshire, Julie Goodyear, Barbara Knox and William Roache.

<text>Cheryl Ann Jacques (born February 17, 1962) is an American politician and attorney who served six terms in the Massachusetts Senate, was the president of the Human Rights Campaign for 11 months, and served as an administrative judge in the Massachusetts Department of Industrial Accidents.

Jacques graduated from Boston College in 1984 and received her J.D. from Suffolk University Law School in 1987.

Jacques was Assistant District Attorney in Middlesex County and Assistant Attorney General of the state. She ran for U.S. Congress, but lost in the Democratic primary to Stephen Lynch. Jacques was the first openly lesbian member of the Massachusetts Senate where she served six terms, and came out as a lesbian during her fourth, citing the statistic that one-third of gay and lesbian teens attempt suicide as part of her motivation for coming out. She was succeeded in the state Senate by Scott Brown.

Jacques became president of HRC in 2004, succeeding Elizabeth Birch. She addressed the 2004 Democratic National Convention in this post. She resigned on November 30, 2004, citing &quot;a difference in management philosophy&quot; with her board, following criticism of the HRC&#x27;s failure to defeat voter referendums in 11 states banning same-sex marriage and, in some cases, civil unions.

After leaving HRC, she was of counsel to the law firm of Brody, Hardoon, Perkins and Kesten and was a consultant on diversity issues to corporations and non-profit organizations.

In 2008 Jacques was named a Department of Industrial Accidents Administrative Judge by Governor Deval Patrick. On March 12, 2012 the State Ethics Commission charged her with violating Massachusetts&#x27; conflict-of-interest law after she allegedly tried to use her clout as a judge to have a dentist office reduce her brother-in-law&#x27;s bill. Jacques contended that she never intended to introduce her position, but did so &quot;inadvertently&quot;. The ethics commission found in favor of Jacques on the grounds that the enforcement division failed to prove that Jacques used her official position to intervene in the dispute. In 2013, Jacques and two other administrative judges filed charges with the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination, alleging the agency provided a higher salary and a parking space to a male judge appointed after them. In 2014, Governor Patrick chose not to reappoint Jacques, which she alleged was in retaliation for the gender discrimination lawsuit.

==Personal life==
In 2004, Jacques married Jennifer Chrisler. They have three sons.

<text>Confederation Centre of the Arts () is a cultural centre dedicated to the visual and performing arts located in the city of Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, Canada.

==History==
Construction of Confederation Centre, as it is commonly referred to, started in 1960 and Queen Elizabeth II officially opened it to the public on October 6, 1964. The institution was originally built with funding by the ten provincial governments in Canada and the federal government as Canada&#x27;s National Memorial to the Fathers of Confederation, who met in Charlottetown in September 1864 at what was called the Charlottetown Conference. Today its operations are 65% self-funded through ticket sales, memberships, donations, and sponsorships; 25% funded from Canadian Heritage; 6% funded from the Province of PEI; and 4% from other annual granting bodies.

The centre has played host to the Charlottetown Festival every summer since 1965, although there was no 2020 Charlottetown Festival due to the global COVID-19 pandemic. It holds the Guinness World Record for the longest running annual musical theatre production, &quot;Anne of Green Gables — The Musical&quot;, performed every summer from 1965 until 2019. Hundreds of other productions have been featured. The centre was designated a National Historic Sites of Canada in 2003.

In 2011 the mainstage Homburg Theatre underwent a $17-million renovation to improve acoustics, seating, lighting, and rigging. The project was completed in time for the centre&#x27;s 50th anniversary in 2014.

==Architecture==

Confederation Centre was built on Queen&#x27;s Square in the centre of Charlottetown&#x27;s business district, immediately west of Province House, Prince Edward Island&#x27;s legislature and the location of the Charlottetown Conference. The centre is one contiguous structure, however at street level it appears as three separate buildings (hosting a theatre and art gallery) clustered around &quot;Memorial Hall&quot; which faces east toward Province House. The Confederation Chambre in Province House, where the conference meetings took place, is located on the western side of that building, thus facing directly at Confederation Centre&#x27;s Memorial Hall.

Confederation Centre covers a block in the central business district, bounded on three sides by Grafton Street, Queen Street, and Richmond Street. The structure houses an art museum, and several performing arts venues.

===Art museum===
Opened at the same time as the rest of the structure, the Confederation Centre Art Gallery is an art museum in the northeast pavilion of the Confederation Centre of the Arts. The art gallery pavilion is housed in a three-storey structure, that includes over of exhibition space. As of June 2017, it held over 17,000 works in its permanent collection.

===Theatres===
The Confederation Centre of the Arts includes a number of venues for the performing arts. These include a 1,109 seat mainstage theatre, the largest theatre mainstage in Canada east of Montreal; and two studio theatres.

<text>The 33rd Street–Rawson Street station (announced as the 33rd Street station on trains) is a local station on the IRT Flushing Line of the New York City Subway. It is located over Queens Boulevard on a concrete viaduct. It is served by the 7 train at all times.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
The 1913 Dual Contracts called for the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) and Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company (BRT; later Brooklyn–Manhattan Transit Corporation, or BMT) to build new lines in Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx. Queens did not receive many new IRT and BRT lines compared to Brooklyn and the Bronx, since the city&#x27;s Public Service Commission (PSC) wanted to alleviate subway crowding in the other two boroughs first before building in Queens, which was relatively undeveloped. The IRT Flushing Line was to be one of two Dual Contracts lines in the borough, along with the Astoria Line; it would connect Flushing and Long Island City, two of Queens&#x27;s oldest settlements, to Manhattan via the Steinway Tunnel. When the majority of the line was built in the early 1910s, most of the route went through undeveloped land, and Roosevelt Avenue had not been constructed. Community leaders advocated for more Dual Contracts lines to be built in Queens to allow development there.

The Flushing Line was opened from Queensboro Plaza to Alburtis Avenue (now 103rd Street–Corona Plaza) on April 21, 1917, with a local station at 33rd Street.

=== Later years ===
The city government took over the IRT&#x27;s operations on June 12, 1940. The IRT routes were given numbered designations in 1948 with the introduction of &quot;R-type&quot; rolling stock, which contained rollsigns with numbered designations for each service. The route from Times Square to Flushing became known as the 7. On October 17, 1949, the joint BMT/IRT operation of the Flushing Line ended, and the line became the responsibility of the IRT. After the end of BMT/IRT dual service, the New York City Board of Transportation announced that the Flushing Line platforms would be lengthened to 11 IRT car lengths; the platforms were only able to fit nine 51-foot-long IRT cars beforehand. The platforms at the station were extended in 1955–1956 to accommodate 11-car trains. However, nine-car trains continued to run on the 7 route until 1962, when they were extended to ten cars. With the opening of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, trains were lengthened to eleven cars.

The present-day 33rd, 40th, and 46th Streets were originally respectively known as Rawson, Lowery, and Bliss Streets until the 1930s, when they were given numbered street names. To avoid confusion, the 33rd Street–Rawson Street, 40th Street–Lowery Street, and 46th Street–Bliss Street stations displayed both the new and old names of the respective street. Since a New York City Transit Authority rule prohibited subway stations from being named after nonexistent streets, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA) removed the old names of each street from station signs and subway maps in 1998. Local residents opposed the renaming and unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the MTA to restore the old names. The New York City Council passed a law in July 2003, giving both the old and new names to all three streets; after new street signs were installed in September 2003, the MTA agreed to restore the old names of each station.

In December 2019, the MTA announced that this station would become ADA-accessible as part of the agency&#x27;s 2020–2024 Capital Program. A requests for proposals was put out on May 18, 2023 for the contract for a project bundle to add elevators at 13 stations, including 33rd Street–Rawson Street. The contract to add two elevators at the station was awarded in December 2023.

==Station layout==
The station has two side platforms and three tracks. The center track is used by peak-direction &lt;7&gt; express trains during rush hours.

===Exits===
Both exits are under the tracks in the median of Queens Boulevard. The full-time exit is at 33rd Street, with two stairs from each platform, and the part-time exit is at 34th Street, also with two stairs from each platform. The part-time exit has a crossunder to allow free transfers between opposite directions while the full-time one does not, even though it has the layouts that could allow one.

The county constituency was first created in 1885 from the southern part of Down. It was defined as including &#x27;The Baronies of – Iveagh Upper, Lower Half, Lordship of Newry, and Mourne, and so much of the Barony of Iveagh Upper, Upper Half, as comprises the Parishes of – Clonallan, Donaghmore, Drumgath, Kilbroney, and Warrenpoint.&#x27;. In 1918, it was redefined as including &#x27;The rural district of Newry No. 1; the part of the rural district of Kilkeel which is not included in the East Down Division; and the urban districts of Newcastle, Newry and Warrenpoint.&#x27; From the dissolution of Parliament in 1922, it was merged back into Down. Maps showing the component units of the constituency can be seen here.

The seat was re-created in 1950 when the old Down two MP constituency was abolished as part of the final move to single member seats. Originally the seat consisted of most of the mid and southern parts of County Down, with the north included in North Down. It was defined as including &#x27;(i) The urban districts of Banbridge, Downpatrick, Dromore, Kilkeel, Newcastle, Newry and Warrenpoint; (ii) the rural districts of Banbridge, Downpatrick, Kilkeel, Moira and Newry No. 1.&#x27; Of the post 1973 districts, it contained all of Down and Banbridge, together with parts of Newry and Mourne, Ards and Craigavon.

In 1983 the seat was radically cut down as part of an expansion of Northern Ireland&#x27;s constituencies from 12 to 17. Significant parts of the constituency were transferred to either Upper Bann or Newry and Armagh. The composition of the seat in 1983 was the entire district of Down, the Annaclone, Ballyoolymore, Croob, Dromore, Drumadonnell, Garran, Quilly and Skeagh, the electoral wards of Banbridge, and the Annalong, Ballycrossan, Binnian, Clonallan, Cranfield, Donaghmore, Drumgath, Kilkeel, Lisnacree, Rathfriland, Rostrevor, Seaview, and Spelga wards from Newry and Mourne.

In boundary changes proposed by a review in 1995, the seat was originally to be abolished and replaced by a new Mid Down constituency. This provoked a storm of protest and following a local enquiry minor changes were made with the seat losing one small section to Lagan Valley and another to Strangford. It still consists of parts of Down, Banbridge and Newry and Mourne districts.

In 2005, the Boundary Commission published provisional recommendations for modifying the boundaries of constituencies in Northern Ireland. For South Down, it originally proposed to add part of Newry from Newry and Armagh and the Loughbrickland part of Banbridge district from Upper Bann, while losing some more of Down to Strangford. These changes were challenged in a round of public consultations, with the result that revised recommendations were made. Under the new proposals, the Newry area remained in Newry and Armagh and Loughbrickland in Upper Bann. This meant that only 4 wards around the town of Ballynahinch were transferred to Strangford. These changes became the final recommendations and were given legal effect in 2008.

==History==

===1885–1922===
The constituency was a predominantly Nationalist area in 1918. The Unionists had significant but minority support. The Sinn Féin candidate polled poorly, probably due to the limited electoral pact to avoid seriously splitting the anti-unionist vote in seats the unionist candidate might have otherwise won.

===The First Dáil===
Sinn Féin contested the general election of 1918 on a platform that instead of taking up any seats they won in the United Kingdom Parliament, they would establish a revolutionary assembly in Dublin. In republican theory, every MP elected in Ireland was a potential Deputy to this assembly. In practice, only the Sinn Féin members accepted the offer and their candidate Éamon de Valera only received 0.2% of the votes in South Down, while being elected unopposed for East Clare and East Mayo; the nationalist Jeremiah McVeagh, elected as IPP MP for South Down, did not participate in the First Dáil.

In 1921, Sinn Féin decided to use the UK authorised elections for the Northern Ireland House of Commons and the House of Commons of Southern Ireland as a poll for the Irish Republic&#x27;s Second Dáil. This area, in republican theory, was incorporated in a potential eight-member Dáil constituency of Down.

===1950–present===
When initially created, this seat had a clear unionist majority, albeit with a strong nationalist minority. However boundary changes, which have wrapped it closer around nationalist heartlands near Downpatrick and the Mournes, have transformed South Down into a safe nationalist seat.

The House of Commons seat was consistently held by the Ulster Unionist Party from its creation until 1987. In the October 1974 general election the former Conservative MP Enoch Powell defended the seat for the UUP, representing a coup for them as they gained the support of a high-profile English politician, offering them a spokesperson to the United Kingdom as a whole.

Powell advocated a policy of &quot;integration&quot; for Northern Ireland whereby all forms of devolution would be wound up and the province governed as an integral part of the United Kingdom. As part of this, he campaigned for the province to have the same ratio of MPs to population as in the rest of the United Kingdom, rather than fewer, which had previously been justified due to the existence of the devolved Stormont Parliament. Powell was successful in this, but a side effect was that in his own constituency; a significant block of unionist voters were removed, resulting in a nationalist majority. Powell managed to survive for two election cycles due to a split nationalist vote, but in 1987, he narrowly lost to Eddie McGrady of the Social Democratic and Labour Party, who held the seat until he retired in 2010.

Since then, the unionist vote has declined further due to boundary changes, which excluded mainly unionist Dromore and Saintfield, and a trend for many unionists to tactically vote for the SDLP at Westminster elections to avoid the seat falling to Sinn Féin. However, in 2017, Sinn Féin gained the constituency for the first time with Chris Hazzard defeating former leader of the SDLP Margaret Ritchie as part of the SDLP&#x27;s parliamentary wipeout at that year&#x27;s snap general election.

The winning vote share in 2019 was the smallest of the 650 nationwide; it was just under of the total votes that were cast.

==Members of Parliament==
The Member of Parliament since the 2017 general election has been Chris Hazzard of Sinn Féin. He succeeded SDLP MP Margaret Ritchie.

<doc id="865890" wikidata="Q7568013" url="?curid=865890" title="South Mumbai">
<text>South Mumbai, colloquially SoBo from South Bombay in Indian English, administratively the Mumbai City District, is the city centre and the southernmost precinct of Greater Bombay. It extends from Colaba to Mahalaxmi (Western side), Byculla (Central Side) and Mazgaon (Harbour Side) neighbourhoods, and comprises the city&#x27;s old and formerly main business localities, making it the wealthiest urban precinct in India. Property prices in South Mumbai are by far the highest in India and among the highest in the world. In terms of Maharashtra Legislative Assembly, the precinct consists of the constituencies of Colaba, Mumbadevi, Malabar Hill and Byculla.

Taj Mahal Hotel, Gateway of India, Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, Ballard Estate, and the Bombay Harbour are some of the most iconic landmarks of South Bombay. Billionaire Mukesh Ambani&#x27;s $1.5 billion home Antilia is located here and is now a part of the iconic skyline. Most residents of South Mumbai belong to old money business, law, trade, and fashion families. Geographically, South Mumbai lies at the southernmost extent of Mumbai Island. Most city residents use the term to refer to the stretch extending from Colaba to Tardeo and Byculla as South Mumbai. The area is delimited on the east by Mumbai harbour and on the west by the Arabian Sea.

South Mumbai is also home to many educational institutions; namely Mumbai University&#x27;s Fort Campus, Cathedral and John Connon School, St. Anne&#x27;s High School, Fort, JB Petit, Campion, Bombay International School, Gamdevi, St. Mary&#x27;s School, Mumbai, etc.; exclusive sports clubs: CCI, The Willingdon Sports Club, as well as the Bombay Gymkhana; and hospitals such as Breach Candy Hospital, Bombay Hospital, Jaslok Hospital, and Hurkisondas Hospital.

==Significance==
South Mumbai hosts the Reserve Bank of India, the Bombay Stock Exchange and, one of the oldest YMCA buildings. Its primary business districts are the Fort, Nariman Point, Ballard Estate, and more recently Lower Parel, Mumbai Central. Many leading Indian and multi-national companies are headquartered here. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Churchgate serve as headquarters and starting point for country&#x27;s Central Railway and Western Railway lines respectively.

The headquarters of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, the governing civic body of Greater Mumbai is located in South Mumbai. The Bombay High Court is also in South Mumbai.

The terrorist attacks of 2008 included many prominent South Mumbai locations including the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel in Colaba, Leopold Cafe and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus.

The area houses a significant proportion of prime upmarket residential neighbourhoods of Mumbai including: Pedder Road, Nepean Sea Road, Kemps Corner, Altamount Road, Carmichael Road, Breach Candy and Walkeshwar Road, forming a sort of golden quadrilateral and includes some of the most expensive residential areas in the world, such as the Hanging Gardens, Kemps Corner, Cuffe Parade and Malabar Hill.

South Mumbai is home to two UNESCO World Heritage Sites: Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus and the city&#x27;s distinctive ensemble of Victorian and Art Deco buildings. South Mumbai boasts a large number of Art Deco buildings, second only to Miami. South Mumbai&#x27;s architecture also comprises historical monuments from the colonial era which attract tourists throughout the year.

South Mumbai has many educational institutions such as Jamnalal Bajaj Institute of Management Studies, St. Xavier&#x27;s College, Government Law College, Jai Hind College, Wilson College, Grant Medical College, Sydenham Institute of Management Studies, Research and Entrepreneurship Education, among others.

Many distinctive sporting clubs have been an integral part of South Mumbai landscape like the Willingdon Sports Club, the Turf Club at Mahalaxmi Racecourse, the Bombay Gymkhana, the Breach Candy Club, the N.S.C.I., and the Malabar Hill Club (Formerly W.I.A.A. Club). The Cricket Club of India (CCI) and Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) are located at Mumbai&#x27;s two cricket stadiums, namely Brabourne Stadium and Wankhede Stadium respectively.

Although land reclamation has allowed the southernmost tip of the district to double in size since the 1970s, the business districts face an acute shortage of real estate. As a result, the real-estate prices are among the top ten worldwide. As a ratio to average per capita income, real-estate prices in the business districts remain the most expensive in the world.

South Mumbai is also home to such sporting grounds as Brabourne Stadium, Wankhede Stadium, Shivaji Park, Azad Maidan, Oval Maidan, and Cooperage Ground.

Mumbai&#x27;s most popular beach, Girgaon Chowpatty is located at the beginning of a 3.6 km esplanade known as the Marine Drive which is a popular hangout spot among the citizens. Another popular esplanade in South Mumbai is the Worli Seaface.

South Mumbai has popular art galleries and museums like Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya, Jehangir Art Gallery, Nehru Centre Art Gallery. Sobo Films, an independent film producer, has been named after the area but is itself based in Andheri in the west.

South Mumbai has become less congested with the creation of the Bandra Worli Sea Link. Auto rickshaws are strictly banned here. This facilitates quicker transport between people residing in the suburbs and the corporate offices in South Mumbai. Traffic is a major concern in most parts.

==Division==
The city of Mumbai lies on two different islands, Mumbai Island and Salsette Island. Administratively it has two official divisions: Mumbai City district and Mumbai Suburban district. Mumbai City district is Mumbai Island - the area on its southernmost tip is called South Mumbai. Mumbai Suburban district consists the Western, Eastern, Central and Northern parts of the city. The northernmost portion of the island - outside Mumbai city limits - lies in Thane district.

==Old Bombay==

Old Bombay was used to refer to the area which was formed by the merging of the seven original islands of Mumbai, India. The term was used from the 19th century until the 1980s and is now considered archaic, however still widely used.

<text>Charles Augustine González (born May 5, 1945) is an American Democratic politician from Texas. He represented Texas&#x27;s 20th congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1999 to 2013. He served as Chairman of Latinos for Obama and National Co-Chair of President Obama&#x27;s 2012 re-election campaign.

==Early life, education, and legal career==
González was born in San Antonio, Texas, the son of Bertha Marie (née Cuellar) and Henry B. González, who represented the 20th from 1961 until his son took over in 1999. His parents, of Mexican descent, were both Texas-born. Charlie graduated from Thomas A. Edison High School. He received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in government from the University of Texas at Austin in 1969, and then later earned his Juris Doctor degree from St. Mary&#x27;s University in San Antonio in 1972. As a youth, he was a Boy Scout in Troop 90 of San Antonio. His father was the Scoutmaster.

González served as a technical sergeant in the Texas Air National Guard from 1969 until 1975. He then began practicing law until 1982 when he began rising through the ranks of the court system. He served first as a municipal court judge, then later as a judge in county and then district court, both of which are elected positions.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Henry González, of Texas&#x27;s 20th congressional district, had long groomed his son to be his successor. When his father didn&#x27;t seek a full 19th term in 1998, Charlie ran for the seat. In a crowded seven-way Democratic primary, Gonzalez led the field with 44%, missing the 50% threshold to avoid a run-off. In that election, he defeated San Antonio City Councilwoman Maria Antonietta Berriozabal 62%-38%. In the general election, he defeated Republican James Walker 63%-36%. He became only the fourth person to represent the 20th District since its creation in 1935. In fact, Charlie&#x27;s first race was the first open-seat race in the district&#x27;s 64-year history. However, he had effectively assured himself of succeeding his father with his primary win. The 20th is a heavily Democratic, majority-Hispanic district; the Republicans have only put up nominal candidates in this district since Henry won it in a 1961 special election.

Charlie kept this tradition going. He was re-elected six more times, and never won re-election with less than 63% of the vote. He only faced a Republican challenger three times, in 2004, 2008 and 2010. He had no major-party opposition in 2000 and 2006 and was completely unopposed in 2002.

He decided to retire and not seek another term in 2012.

===Tenure===
Charlie González is a member of the New Democrat Coalition. He is generally seen as less confrontational than his father, who once punched someone for calling him a communist. Between them, the father and son represented the 20th for 52 consecutive years; the only family combination to serve longer in the House has been the Dingells of Michigan, who have represented various districts centered around Detroit and its suburbs for almost 90 consecutive years.

Rep. González was one of the first congressmen to actively support Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. &quot;Senator Obama brings all these new fresh faces,’’ Gonzalez told the San Antonio Express-News. &quot;He has a wider audience. He has the greater potential to engage a greater number of people.’’

González announced on November 25, 2011, that he would not seek reelection in the 2012 congressional elections. He said he wanted a job that would allow him &quot;to be productive and have the resources to make a better life&quot; for himself and his family.

===Committee assignments===
*Committee on Energy and Commerce
**Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade
**Subcommittee on Energy and Power
**Subcommittee on Health
*Committee on House Administration
**Subcommittee on Elections (Ranking Member)
**Subcommittee on Oversight

===Caucus memberships===
*Congressional Hispanic Caucus (Chair)
*Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus
*Congressional Arts Caucus

<text>A military marine mammal is a cetacean or pinniped that has been trained for military uses. Examples include bottlenose dolphins, seals, sea lions, and beluga whales. The United States and Soviet militaries have trained and employed oceanic dolphins for various uses. Military marine mammals have been trained to rescue lost naval swimmers, guard navy ships against enemy divers, locate mines for later clearance by divers, and aid in location and recovery of equipment lost on the seabed.

== Dolphins ==

=== Uses of Military Dolphins ===
These animals are able to defend ships against enemy divers, locate and retrieve lost or damaged equipment, attach homing devices for torpedoes to larger targets, locate submarines, and much more. 

=== Soviet Union Navy dolphins ===
The Soviet Navy operated a research facility to explore military uses of marine mammals at Kazachya Bukhta (), near Sevastopol. The Russian military&#x27;s dolphin program is believed to have languished in the early 1990s.

A Soviet military Beluga whale named Tichka twice escaped in 1991 and 1992, crossed the Black Sea and was admired by the residents of the Turkish town Gerze, who called him Aydın.

==== Russian Federation, Ukraine, and Iran ====
After the fall of the Soviet Union, the Soviet military dolphin program was passed to the Ukrainian Navy. In March 2000 the BBC reported that the Ukrainian navy had transferred their military dolphin project from Sevastopol to Iran. Iran bought the animals, and the chief trainer carried on his research at Iran&#x27;s new oceanarium.

In 2012, Ukraine allegedly &quot;resurrected&quot; the military dolphin program. After the 2014 annexation of Crimea, the Ukrainian dolphin program was taken over by Russia. Conflicting statements have been made regarding the fate of the dolphins. One claim is that the program had been demilitarized prior to the annexation, with all military dolphins either sold commercially or dead by natural causes. A counter-claim suggests that dolphins died patriotically after going on hunger strikes and resisting their Russian captors. Russia reportedly intended to use advanced technology to visualise the dolphin&#x27;s biosonar signals in future military dolphin research.

Government public records show that in 2016, five bottlenose dolphins were purchased by the Russian defence ministry from Moscow’s Utrish Dolphinarium.

In 2022 and 2023, there were reports that Russia had deployed dolphins to protect the Sevastopol Naval Base from Ukrainian attacks.

===United States Navy dolphins===
The U.S. Navy trains dolphins and sea lions under the U.S. Navy Marine Mammal Program, which is based in San Diego, California. The Navy gets some of its dolphins from the Gulf of Mexico. Military dolphins were used by the U.S. Navy during the First and Second Gulf Wars, and their use dates back to the Vietnam War. About 75 dolphins were in the program circa 2007, and around 70 dolphins and 30 sea lions were reported to be in the program in 2019.

Pioneering the use of dolphins in warfare was the scientist James Fitzgerald whom the CIA sent to Key West, Florida, to set up a classified laboratory in 1964. His assignment was to study whether dolphin hydrodynamics could be applied to the design of submarines, torpedoes and missiles and whether the animals could be trained to perform missions.

The United States Navy implemented a program in 1960 to work with dolphins and sea lions in order to help with defense, mine detection, and the design of new submarines and new underwater weapons. The Navy did many tests with several marine mammals to determine which would be best for the required missions, with &quot;more than 19 species...including some sharks and birds&quot; tested, though the bottlenose dolphin and California sea lion were considered the best at what the Navy needed them for. The bottlenose dolphins&#x27; asset was their highly evolved biosonar, helping to find underwater mines, and the sea lions&#x27; asset was their impeccable underwater vision, which can help to detect enemy swimmers. In fiscal year 2007, the United States Navy spent $14 million on research on marine mammal training programs for object recovery and mine detection and had 75 trained dolphins. 

In 2005, there were press reports that some U.S. military dolphins based on Lake Pontchartrain had escaped during the Hurricane Katrina flooding. The U.S. Navy dismissed these stories as nonsense or a hoax, though they may be taking on the status of an urban myth.

====Care of animals====
The marine mammals used for the Navy&#x27;s research and operations are cared for by a full-time staff of veterinarians, veterinarian technicians, and highly trained marine biologists.

====Training====
The dolphins and sea lions are trained by five teams of the Navy&#x27;s Marine Mammal fleet members. One team specializes in swimmer detection, three teams in mine location, and another team in object recoveries. The quick-response goal of this fleet is to mobilize a team and be on site within 72 hours. Dolphins are trained much like police dogs and hunting dogs are. They are given rewards such as fish on correct completion of a task. Dolphins are trained to detect underwater mines and enemy swimmers and then report back to their handlers. Rumours that dolphins had been trained to kill divers have been denied by the US Navy, which claims that training dolphins to fight or kill humans is impossible.

Retired US Admiral Tim Keating claimed that military dolphins could be used to detect mines in the Strait of Hormuz, after Iran threatened to close the waterway in January 2012.

=== Israel ===
On January 10, 2022, Hamas, through a report by Al-Quds, suspects Israel of using dolphins for the purpose of targeting Hamas dive fighters. Similar Israel-related animal conspiracy theories were stated in August 2015 when Al-Quds claimed to have sources regarding another incident of a cetacean fighter, equipped with a remote control, a camera, and a weapon that can fire harpoon-type projectiles.

=== Harm to animals ===
Ric O&#x27;Barry, a former U.S. Navy and civilian trainer of marine mammals, writes that the dolphins complied with their training program only to obtain food. Once they became full, they would no longer be obedient. To prevent this and potential escapes, the navy installed anti-foraging devices that prevented dolphins from fully opening their mouth to feed in the oceans. He also believes that deploying dolphins during war would cause the enemy to attack all dolphins that it comes across, because there is no way to tell a friendly dolphin from a hostile one.

== Seals and sea lions ==
Seals and sea lions are trained and utilised by the US Navy and the Russian Navy. In Russia, dolphins and seals have been trained to carry tools for divers and to detect torpedoes, mines, and other ammunition to working depths of up to 120 metres. Seals are considered better suited than belugas for military use in polar conditions for their &quot;high professionalism&quot; and ability to learn, retain, and understand oral commands.

== Belugas ==
In 2019, a beluga was found off the coast of Norway that was believed to have most likely been trained by the Russian Navy. The beluga, called Hvaldimir, was wearing a harness that was labeled &quot;Equipment of St. Petersburg&quot;, seemed comfortable around humans, and attempted to pull ropes from the sides of a Norwegian fishing vessel. Beluga research was conducted by the Murmansk Sea Biology Research Institute in northern Russia on behalf of the Russian Navy. Experiments were conducted to determine whether belugas could be used to “guard entrances to naval bases’” in arctic regions and &quot;assist deepwater divers and if necessary kill any strangers who enter their territory&quot;. The research concluded that dolphins and seals were better suited to military use in polar conditions than belugas.

<text>Michael A. Burstein (born 1970) is an American writer of science fiction.

== Background ==
Michael A. Burstein was born in New York City, and grew up in Forest Hills in the borough of Queens. He attended Hunter College High School in Manhattan and went on to Harvard College where he was a member of the Harvard-Radcliffe Science Fiction Association. He graduated Harvard in 1991 with a degree in Physics; in 1993 he earned a Master&#x27;s in Physics from Boston University. In 1994 Burstein attended the Clarion Workshop. In 1995 he studied comic book writing under Dennis O&#x27;Neil at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.

==Writing career==
Burstein&#x27;s first published story, &quot;TeleAbsence&quot;, which appeared in the July 1995 issue of &quot;Analog&quot;, was nominated for the Hugo Award and was chosen by the readers of &quot;Analog&quot; as the best short story published by the magazine in 1995. Two years later, Burstein won the John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer at the 1997 World Science Fiction Convention, LoneStarCon2.

Burstein subsequently received Hugo nominations for &quot;Broken Symmetry&quot;, &quot;Cosmic Corkscrew&quot;, &quot;Kaddish for the Last Survivor&quot; (also a Nebula Award nominee), &quot;Spaceships&quot;, &quot;Paying It Forward&quot;, &quot;Decisions&quot;, &quot;Time Ablaze&quot;, &quot;Seventy-Five Years&quot;, and &quot;TelePresence&quot;, and a Nebula and Sturgeon Award nomination for &quot;Reality Check&quot;. His novella &quot;Sanctuary&quot; was chosen by the readers of &quot;Analog&quot; as the best novella published by the magazine in 2005 and was a nominee for the Nebula Award.

<text>Errick French Willis (March 21, 1896 – January 9, 1967) was a politician in Manitoba, Canada. He served as leader of the province&#x27;s Conservative Party between 1936 and 1954, and was responsible for beginning and ending the party&#x27;s alliance with the Liberal-Progressive Party. He also served as Manitoba&#x27;s 15th Lieutenant Governor between 1960 and 1965.

==Early life and education==

Willis was born in Boissevain, Manitoba. He was the son of R.G. Willis, himself the leader of the Conservative Party from 1919 to 1920.

The younger Willis received a BA from the University of Toronto, an MA from the University of Manitoba and an LL.B from the University of Manitoba. He subsequently worked as a barrister and farmer, and was involved in local masonic organizations. Willis married Louise Isabel Trimble Willis.

==Political career==

Willis began his political career at the federal level. He was a Conservative, but used the label &quot;Progressive-Conservative&quot; in Souris in the election of 1926, and was defeated by a straight Progressive candidate. He won the riding in the 1930 election, again having contested it as a &quot;Progressive-Conservative&quot; and served for five years as a backbench supporter of R.B. Bennett&#x27;s Conservative government. In 1932, outside politics, Willis was a member of the Canadian curling team that won a gold medal in the curling event at the 1932 Winter Olympics.

He was defeated in the 1935 election, losing by three votes to the Liberal candidate.

Willis was acclaimed as leader of the provincial Conservative Party on June 9, 1936, replacing W. Sanford Evans. He was elected for the riding of Deloraine in a provincial election held later in the year.

The election of 1936 was very close, with John Bracken&#x27;s Liberal-Progressives winning 23 seats in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and Willis&#x27;s Conservatives winning 16. Another 16 seats were won by smaller parties. There were rumours of a Bracken-Willis coalition after the election, but this plan was rejected by the Conservative leader.

After the start of World War II, the idea of an all-party coalition was revived by Bracken&#x27;s government. The Conservatives, Social Credit and the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation joined Bracken&#x27;s Liberal-Progressives in a &quot;non-partisan government&quot;, meant to demonstrate the united resolve of the province. Willis was sworn in as Minister of Public Works on November 4, 1940. When CCF leader Seymour Farmer resigned in 1942, Willis also became Minister of Labour, holding this position until 1944.

The coalition was generally advantageous to the Conservative Party, which was renamed the Progressive Conservative (PC) Party in the mid-1940s. Its ministers were allowed a fair degree of autonomy, and were fully integrated into the province&#x27;s governing structure, unlike the CCF and Social Credit ministers, who were marginalized. The party maintained an identity separate from the Liberal-Progressives throughout this period. In a 1946 manifesto, its members pledged to support an increase in old-age pensions, a decrease in tariff rates, and further transportation openings to the province&#x27;s north. Willis, supported by the Liberal-Progressives, was re-elected by acclamation in 1941, 1945 and 1949.

There were some Progressive Conservatives who opposed the coalition, particularly after Liberal-Progressive Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Douglas Campbell became the province&#x27;s premier in 1948. The Conservatives had nominated Willis to be premier, but Campbell defeated him in a vote among coalition MLAs. Campbell&#x27;s philosophy of &quot;minimal government&quot; was rejected by the more progressive figures in the PC ranks, the most vocal of whom was Dufferin Roblin (grandson of former Premier Sir Rodmond Roblin). In 1949, Roblin was elected to the legislature for Winnipeg South as an anti-coalition Progressive Conservative.

Under pressure from his party and disturbed by the Campbell government&#x27;s inaction on various issues, Willis resigned from cabinet on August 19, 1950. At a party convention in October, the Progressive Conservatives voted 215 to 17 to leave the coalition. Willis, who also fended off a leadership challenge from George Hastings at the convention, once again became leader of the opposition.

Willis was re-elected for Turtle Mountain in the provincial election of 1953, but the provincial Progressive Conservative organization was weak, and Campbell&#x27;s Liberal-Progressives won a decisive majority. MLA J. Arthur Ross forced a leadership convention in 1954; at this convention, Roblin defeated Willis to become party leader.

Willis continued as a member of the legislature after this loss. He was re-elected in 1958, and served in Roblin&#x27;s minority government as Minister of Public Works, Minister of Agriculture and Deputy Premier. Re-elected again in 1959, he continued to serve in cabinet until January 15, 1960, when he was appointed as the province&#x27;s lieutenant governor. He remained in this position until August 31, 1965.

==Death==
Willis died in Winnipeg on January 9, 1967.

<text>Ararat is a 2002 historical-drama film written and directed by Atom Egoyan and starring Charles Aznavour, Christopher Plummer, David Alpay, Arsinée Khanjian, Eric Bogosian, Bruce Greenwood, and Elias Koteas. It is about a family and film crew in Toronto working on a film based loosely on the 1915 defense of Van during the Armenian genocide. In addition to exploring the human impact of that specific historical event, &quot;Ararat&quot; examines the nature of truth and its representation through art. The genocide is denied by the Government of Turkey, an issue that partially inspired and is explored in the film.

The film was featured out of competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. It won five awards at the 23rd Genie Awards, including Best Motion Picture.

==Plot==
In Toronto, an Armenian Canadian family is headed by Ani, a widow whose husband attempted to assassinate a Turkish ambassador. Her adult son Raffi is involved in a sexual affair with Celia, his step-sister, who has accused Ani of pushing her father off of a cliff, while Ani insists he slipped and fell. Ani gives art history presentations on Armenian American painter Arshile Gorky, with Celia constantly attending and publicly heckling Ani about concealing the truth.

An Armenian film director, Edward Saroyan, arrives to Toronto with a goal to make a film about the Armenian genocide, the Van Resistance, and Gorky. Ani is hired as a historical consultant, with Raffi working on the project with his mother. An aspiring Turkish Canadian actor named Ali receives his big break when cast as Ottoman governor Jevdet Bey. Ali reads on the history of the genocide, which he had never heard much of before, and offends Raffi when he tells Saroyan that he believes the Ottomans felt the genocide was justified, in light of World War I. Raffi attempts to explain to Ali that the Armenians were citizens of the Ottoman Empire and that the Turks were not at war with them. Ali shrugs the encounter off, saying they were both born in Canada and they should together try to move past the genocide.

After Raffi returns to Canada from a flight to Turkey, he is interrogated at airport security by a retiring customs official named David, who has reason to believe Raffi is involved in a plot to smuggle drugs. Rather than employ drug-sniffing dogs, David prefers to speak to Raffi at length, with Raffi claiming he had taken it upon himself to shoot extra footage in Turkey. In fact, the film is premiering that night. Inspired by his own son, David chooses to believe Raffi is innocent, and releases him. The film reels remain with him, however, which David discovers to contain heroin.

==Cast==

==Themes==

Issues explored in the film include truth and art. Using a story within a story device, the film explores whether films should recreate war crimes, and whether films can alter facts to communicate more important truths.

Another theme of the film is gaps between generations, as it explores how later generations understand the historical record rather than the Armenian genocide itself. Numerous Armenian Canadian characters in the film identify symbols with their heritage, such as pictures of Mount Ararat. The fictionalized Arshile Gorky&#x27;s symbols are a button and a photo of his mother. Gorky is depicted in the film as a link between the history and current life of the Armenian people.

==Production==
===Development===
Director Atom Egoyan and his wife, actress Arsinée Khanjian, are Armenian Canadians, and some of Egoyan&#x27;s ancestors had been lost in the genocide. Egoyan had attempted to explain the genocide to their son, Arshile, when he was around six. Arshile asked, &quot;Did the Turks say sorry?&quot; The film &quot;Ararat&quot; is intended as a response to that question.

Producer Robert Lantos had promised that he would support a film about the genocide if Egoyan ever felt prepared to make one. Alliance Atlantis provided Egoyan a budget of $12 million.

===Filming===

For cinematography, Egoyan worked with his frequent collaborator Paul Sarossy, with shooting taking place over 45 days during summer 2001. The battle scenes depicting the Defense of Van were shot in Drumheller, Alberta, with some of the soldiers actually being computer generated. The Van villages were also computer generated.

Other scenes were shot at Cherry Beach in Toronto. The film could not be shot in Turkey or at the real Mount Ararat because of Turkey&#x27;s denial of the genocide.

The film was made prior to the Parliament of Canada voting to recognize the Armenian genocide in 2004. Egoyan said it was more important that the Turkish government accept the truth.

==Release==
MGM considered distributing &quot;Ararat&quot; but Alex Yemenidjian, the chief executive, stated that financially it would not be rational for it to distribute the film; therefore Miramax distributed it instead.

The film was screened out of competition at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival. The film also played on the opening day of the 2002 Toronto International Film Festival on 5 September. The film opened on 15 November 2002 in Los Angeles, New York City and Toronto.

When &quot;Ararat&quot; was released, it was the sole film screened in commercial theaters in the United States in the modern era to be about the Armenian genocide.

The Italian release of &quot;Ararat&quot; was intended to for 24 April 2003. However, its showing was unexpectedly banned by Italian authorities a day before the planned release, with the authorities explaining that the film&#x27;s distributor missed the deadline to apply for a mandatory censorship certificate. The Embassy of Turkey in Rome acknowledged its government did not want the film screened in Italy, but said it was not involved in the decision that the film would not be shown.

Initially Yılmaz Karakoyunlu, the Turkish Minister of State, said that the Turkish government would oppose the film as much as possible. However the Turkish government had given permission for the film to run in Turkey as it was, at the time, trying to increase freedom of expression so Turkey could join the European Union. Belge Film had permission from the Turkish government to release the film in Turkey itself, but opted not to when nationalists pledged to &quot;take action&quot;. It ran on the Turkish TV station Kanaltürk four years later.

==Reception==

===Box office===
In the opening week after the limited release on 15 November, the film averaged $35,188 per screen. It made $162,000 in five theatres by 18 November. By 24 days, it had made US$1.1 million in North America.

The film completed its run on 30 January 2003, with a gross of $1,555,959 in North America. It grossed $1,187,377 in other territories for a total of $2,743,336.

===Critical reception===
Critical reception was mostly negative. In Canada, &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote &quot;The metaphors are provocative, but too often, the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery.&quot; Brian D. Johnson, writing for &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, called it frustrating, though also interesting, and said it fell short despite ambition. The &quot;National Post&quot;&#x27;s review stated &quot;Egoyan is almost crippled by a need to show all sides.&quot; At the Toronto International Film Festival, the national panel of judges placed it in the year&#x27;s top 10.

Roger Ebert gave it two and a half stars, calling it &quot;needlessly confusing,&quot; saying it &quot;clearly comes from Egoyan&#x27;s heart&quot; but is &quot;too much, too heavily layered, too needlessly difficult, too opaque.&quot; He also said it was disputed whether the film&#x27;s quote from Adolf Hitler that the Armenian genocide is forgotten is genuine. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden called the film a &quot;profound reflection on historical memory,&quot; and &quot;hands down the year&#x27;s most thought-provoking film.&quot; The BBC&#x27;s Tom Dawson wrote the film &quot;feels clumsy and convoluted&quot; compared to Egoyan&#x27;s other work.

&quot;Ararat&quot; holds a 55% approval rating on review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, based on 78 reviews, with an average rating of 6.3/10. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;Though Ararat radiates intelligence, its impact is diminished by an overly intricate plot and cerebral style.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 62 out of 100 based on 25 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

===Nationalist criticism===
Ethnic Turks in Canada had proposed boycotting films by Disney and its subsidiary companies, and several nationalist critics sent e-mails to Egoyan and established websites arguing that the film&#x27;s premise is not true. Some individuals sent threats to Egoyan, including statements that a release of the film could result in danger for Armenians in Turkey. &quot;Film Quarterly&quot; stated &quot;&quot;Ararat&quot; touched off a new round of angry denials and charges of hate mongering.&quot;

===Accolades===
The film won several awards. These included five awards at the 23rd Genie Awards, which &quot;Ararat&quot; star Arsinée Khanjian co-hosted with actor Peter Keleghan. Egoyan was not present.

In 2008, the government of Israel also awarded the Dan David Prize to Egoyan for &quot;creative rendering of the past.&quot; &quot;Ararat&quot; was especially a reason for the honour.

<text>Darlaston is an industrial town in the Metropolitan Borough of Walsall in the West Midlands of England. It is located near Bilston, Walsall, Wednesbury, Willenhall and Tipton. It was historically part of Staffordshire.

==Topography==

Darlaston is situated between Wednesbury and Walsall in the valley of the River Tame in the angle where the three major head-streams of the river converge. It is located on the South Staffordshire coalfield and has been an area of intense coal-mining activity. The underlying coal reserves were most likely deposited in the Carboniferous Period.

Disused coal mines are found near Queen Street in Moxley, behind Pinfold Street JMI School, near Hewitt Street and Wolverhampton Street, in George Rose Park, and behind the police station in Victoria Park.

Mining subsidence, which has taken its toll on many buildings across central England, has also made its mark in Darlaston. In 1999, a council house on the New Moxley housing estate collapsed down a disused mineshaft, its occupant, an elderly man had complained of creaking and groaning in the house to neighbours who alerted the authorities. They in turn instructed him to leave. A few hours later it collapsed down the mine. The adjoining house also had to be demolished.

==History==
The ancient origins of the town are now very obscure due to the archive record being relatively recent. Any archaeological evidence has been largely destroyed due to intensive coal mining during the 18th and 19th centuries. A possible Saxon castle probably existed at Darlaston, which eventually became a timber castle. No remains exist today.

Between the 12th and 15th centuries, the de Darlaston family were the landowners, When the de Darlaston family died out, the manor was taken over by the Hayes family and was known as Great Croft.

Darlaston&#x27;s location on the South Staffordshire coalfield led to the early development of coal mining and associated industrial activities. At first such activity was relatively small scale requiring only a copyhold permission from the lord of the manor. So, for example, in 1698 Timothy Woodhouse was manager of the coal mines belonging to Mrs. Mary Offley, then the lady of the manor. In the first year, he sold 3,000 sacks of coal and later went into partnership in his own business.

Rapid industrial growth in the early decades of the 19th century brought with it problems of housing, poverty, and deprivation. In December 1839, the parish rector reported approximately 1,500 homes in the parish of Darlaston, most of which were in poor condition and owned by working-class people. In 1841 the town had a population of 6,000. Development was driven by the presence of excellent transport links: the Birmingham Canal Navigations and Grand Junction Railway. Much of the mining land was owned by the Birmingham Coal Company. Artist Thomas F. Worrall was born in the Woods Bank area in 1872, where his father worked as a blacksmith.

Notable beneficiaries of nineteenth-century industrialisation were the Rose family whose fortune had been made by astute enclosure of common land. Upon the death of Richard Rose in 1870 his estate was valued at over £877. He bequeathed the land to his wife Hannah. His brother was James Rose, shown in the 1871 census as a latch, bolt, and nut maker, employing 39 people, including 19 children. By the time of the 1881 census, James Rose was 55 and his business had expanded to employ 90 people. James Rose died in 1901.

In 1894, Darlaston became an urban district, and the local board became Darlaston Urban District Council. On 1 April 1966 the district was abolished and merged with the County Borough of Walsall and the County Borough of Wolverhampton. The parish was also abolished on 1 April 1966 and merged with Walsall and Wolverhampton. In 1961 the parish had a population of 21,839. In 1974 it became part of the metropolitan county of the West Midlands.

Darlaston was subject to several bombing raids in World War II. A Luftwaffe bombing on 5 June 1941 wrecked several council houses in Lowe Avenue, Rough Hay, and killed 11 people. The bomb had been aimed at Rubery Owen&#x27;s factory but missed by some distance. The houses were later rebuilt.

Many Victorian terraced houses were demolished during the second half of the 20th century, and the Urban District Council of Darlaston built thousands of houses and flats to replace them with. From 1966 Darlaston was administered by Walsall borough and is now in the WS10 postal district which also includes neighbouring Wednesbury. However, since 1999 the council-owned housing stock has been controlled by Darlaston Housing Trust. In 2001 two of the town&#x27;s four multi-story blocks of flats were demolished, and the remaining two were demolished in 2004. .

By the end of the 1980s, most of the industry in the town had closed and the town is now considered a &quot;ghost town&quot;, with an increasingly high level of unemployment. In 2011 a total of 15 derelict sites in the town were designated as enterprise zones offering tax breaks and relaxed planning laws to any businesses interested in setting up bases in the selected areas. These enterprise zones are expected to create thousands of jobs and ease the town&#x27;s long-running unemployment crisis, which has deepened since 2008 as a result of the recession.

==Education==
The town is served by one large secondary school, Grace Academy, which until 2009 was known as Darlaston Comprehensive School.

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 Census, Darlaston&#x27;s built-up area population was 21,545 residents. Of the findings, the ethnicity and religious composition of the wards separately were:

The religious composition of the built-up area at the 2021 Census was recorded as:

The tables show that Darlaston is an ethically diverse town and has several religions being followed. 

==Notable buildings==
===All Saints church===
All Saints&#x27; Church, Darlaston (built 1872) was destroyed by enemy air raids in July 1942. A new church opened in 1952, designed by local architect Richard Twentyman. It is Grade 2 listed.

===Bentley Old Hall===
Bentley Old Hall stood in the north of Darlaston until the early 20th century. Bentley Hall was one of several country houses where in 1651 – after the Battle of Worcester – the future Charles II was sheltered, here by Colonel John Lane. The future king finally escaped disguised as the servant of Jane Lane, the colonel&#x27;s sister. Bentley Old Hall grounds were redeveloped as a housing estate in the 1950s.

===Darlaston Manor House===
The location of the manor house is believed to be congruent with the Asda supermarket car park, slightly south west of the original parish church, now St Lawrence&#x27;s Church.

===Darlaston Town Hall===

Darlaston Town Hall was designed by the Birmingham architect Jethro Anstice Cossins (1830–1917), and it was opened in 1888, built on the site of one of the town&#x27;s two workhouses. It comprised municipal offices, a public library and a public hall. Between 2006 and 2008 the building was restored by Walsall Borough Council at a cost of about £400,000. The main building now houses local Social Services departments, while the hall continues to be used for public meetings, concerts of music and other entertainments.

===Darlaston Windmill===
Darlaston had its own windmill from as early as 1695, when it appears on a map of that date. The mill continued to be in use until about 1860.

===St Lawrence Darlaston===

The Grade-II listed St Lawrence&#x27;s church dates largely from the 1870s and was designed by A. P. Brevitt. The site dates back to early medieval times, and the church registers begin in 1539 and are held at the county archives in Stafford. The Bishop&#x27;s Transcripts are held at Lichfield Record Office.

A grant from the UK Heritage Lottery Fund enabled the complete redecoration of the church&#x27;s interior in 2018.

== Suburban areas ==

===Darlaston Green===
Darlaston Green lies to the north of Darlaston town centre. A coal mine named Darlaston Green was included in an 1889 list of abandoned mines. An 1872 publication listed the Darlaston Green works, owned by the Darlaston Steel and Iron Co. Ltd, as having firstly 38 puddling furnaces and eight rolling mills

=== Woods Bank ===
Woods Bank lies southwest of Darlaston town centre, close to the Black Country New Road and the village of Moxley. It borders the borough of Sandwell and is primarily residential.

The number of houses in the Woods Bank area increased by 87% between 1841 and 1871, and a sanitary report of 1875 describes a dwelling there as consisting of one lower and one upper room, with no ventilation or back door. In comparison with the rest of Darlaston, Woods Bank suffered greatly from unemployment in the iron trade as a result of the mid to late 1870s UK-wide economic depression, and has been described as &quot;a distinct location of poor ironworkers&quot;.

===Roads===
Since the early 1970s, the town centre has been bypassed by St Lawrence&#x27;s Way, which runs between The Green and Great Croft Street Island by the Town&#x27;s Asda. No motorway runs through the town, but a section of the M6 between J9 and J10 may be considered to be in Darlaston. Also the A462 from Wednesbury runs through the town on its way to Willenhall, the A454/A463 Black Country Route have a Junction on the Darlaston/Willenhall Border and the A4444 Black Country New Road meets the A41 London - Ellesmere Port Road and A4038 near to Moxley War Memorial and the Walsall Canal. The A4038 runs through the Town as the Moxley Road, Pinfold Street and Walsall Road and has a junction with the A462 near to Darlaston Library. The A4038 links the A4444 Black Country New Road and the A41 Black Country New Road and Moxley High Street to Walsall Via Darlaston and Pleck

<text>Fort Randall Dam is a earthen dam which spans the Missouri River and impounds Lake Francis Case, the 11th-largest reservoir in the U.S. The dam joins Gregory and Charles Mix counties, South Dakota, a distance of 880 river miles (1,416 km) upstream of St. Louis, Missouri, where the river joins the Mississippi River. The dam and hydroelectric power plant were constructed by and are currently operated by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

==History &amp; background==
Fort Randall Dam was authorized by the Flood Control Act of 1944 and plays a key role in the Pick–Sloan Plan for development of water resources in the Missouri River basin. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction of the dam in 1946, and was the first Pick–Sloan dam completed by the Omaha District. President Dwight D. Eisenhower threw the switch that started the first power generating unit in 1954. When completed in 1956, Fort Randall Dam and the Lake Francis Case Project cost approximately $200 million. U.S. Route 18 and U.S. Route 281 cross the crest of the dam. The dam is just over north of the Nebraska state line.

The Fort Randall Dam is located within sight of its namesake Fort Randall, an early U.S. Army Frontier Post. Fort Randall Dam is one of six Missouri River mainstem dams; the next dam upstream is Big Bend Dam, near Ft. Thompson, and the next dam downstream is Gavins Point Dam, near Yankton.

A significant birding site, the Fort Randall Eagle Roost, is located near the dam. The Eagle Roost was listed as a National Natural Landmark in 1967, shortly after completion of the dam. The eagles that roost here may use the dam&#x27;s spillway to catch and eat fish.

==Hydroelectric Power==
The eight generating units of the Fort Randall Dam are capable of generating 40 megawatts of electricity each, with an annual production of 1.727 billion kilowatt-hours. The combined maximum capacity of 320 megawatts is enough to supply 245,000 households, according to the Corps of Engineers. The river behind the dam drains an area of . Its reservoir, Lake Francis Case, has a surface area of at maximum operating pool, coinciding with a volume of .

== 2011 Missouri River flood==
In June 2011, in response to the 2011 Missouri River Floods, the dam was releasing over , which greatly exceeded its previous record release of set in 1997.

==Visitor Center==
The Fort Randall Visitor Center is located on the western edge of Pickstown, South Dakota, along U.S. Highway 281 and 18. Open from Memorial Day through Labor Day, the visitor center offers a view of the Dam, Lake Francis Case, and the Missouri River. Exhibits highlight the dam&#x27;s construction, area, natural and cultural history, and paleontology. There is also a freshwater aquarium with fish species found in the Missouri River.

<doc id="865922" wikidata="Q189637" url="?curid=865922" title="Dentin">
<text>Dentin ( ) (American English) or dentine ( or ) (British English) () is a calcified tissue of the body and, along with enamel, cementum, and pulp, is one of the four major components of teeth. It is usually covered by enamel on the crown and cementum on the root and surrounds the entire pulp. By volume, 45% of dentin consists of the mineral hydroxyapatite, 33% is organic material, and 22% is water. Yellow in appearance, it greatly affects the color of a tooth due to the translucency of enamel. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle than enamel, is necessary for the support of enamel. Dentin rates approximately 3 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness. There are two main characteristics which distinguish dentin from enamel: firstly, dentin forms throughout life; secondly, dentin is sensitive and can become hypersensitive to changes in temperature due to the sensory function of odontoblasts, especially when enamel recedes and dentin channels become exposed.

==Development==
Prior to enamel formation, dentine formation begins through a process known as dentinogenesis, and this process continues throughout a person&#x27;s life even after the tooth has fully developed. Events such as tooth decay and tooth wear can also initiate dentine formation.

Dentinogenesis is initiated by the odontoblasts of the pulp. Odontoblasts are specialised cells that lay down an organic matrix known as pre-dentine. This pre-dentine is subsequently mineralised into dentine. Mineralisation of pre-dentine begins at the dentino-enamel junction during tooth development and progresses towards the pulp of the tooth. After growth of pre-dentine and maturation into dentine, the cell bodies of the odontoblasts remain in the pulp, along its outer wall, and project into tiny tubules in the dentine.

Pre-dentine is composed of 90% type I collagen and 10% non-collagenous proteins (including phosphoproteins, proteoglycans, growth factors, phosphatases such as alkaline phosphatase, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs)), and this composition is significantly altered when it is mineralised into dentine. See the Structure section for information about the composition of dentine.

== Structure ==
Unlike enamel, dentin may be demineralized and stained for histological study. Dentin consists of microscopic channels, called dentinal tubules, which radiate outward through the dentin from the pulp to the exterior cementum or enamel border. The dentinal tubules extend from the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ) in the crown area, or dentinocemental junction (DCJ) in the root area, to the outer wall of the pulp. From the outer surface of the dentin to the area nearest the pulp, these tubules follow an S-shaped path. The diameter and density of the tubules are greatest near the pulp. Tapering from the inner to the outermost surface, they have a diameter of 2.5 μm near the pulp, 1.2 μm in the middle of the dentin, and 0.9 μm at the dentino-enamel junction. Their density is 59,000 to 76,000 per square millimeter near the pulp, whereas the density is only half as much near the enamel. Within the tubules, there is an odontoblast process, which is an extension of an odontoblast, and dentinal fluid, which contains a mixture of albumin, transferrin, tenascin and proteoglycans. In addition, there are branching canalicular systems that connect to each other. These branches have been categorized by size, with major being 500–1000 nm in diameter, fine being 300–700 nm, and micro being less than 300 nm. The major branches are the terminal ends of the tubules. About every 1-2 μm, there are fine branches diverging from dentinal tubules at 45 degree angles. The microtubules diverge at 90 degree angles. The dentinal tubules contain the cytoplasmic extensions of odontoblasts that once formed the dentin and maintain it. The cell bodies of the odontoblasts are aligned along the inner aspect of dentin against a layer of predentin where they also form the peripheral boundary of the dental pulp Because of dentinal tubules, dentin has a degree of permeability, which can increase the sensation of pain and the rate of tooth decay. The strongest held theory of dentinal hypersensitivity suggests that it is due to changes in the dentinal fluid associated with the processes, a type of hydrodynamic mechanism.

Dentin is a bone-like matrix that is porous and yellow-hued material. It is made up, by weight, of 70–72% inorganic materials (mainly hydroxylapatite and some non-crystalline amorphous calcium phosphate), 20% organic materials (90% of which is collagen type 1 and the remaining 10% ground substance, which includes dentin-specific proteins), and 8–10% water (which is adsorbed on the surface of the minerals or between the crystals). Because it is softer than enamel, it decays more rapidly and is subject to severe cavities if not properly treated, but due to its elastic properties, it is good support for enamel. Its flexibility prevents the brittle enamel fracturing.

In areas where both primary and secondary mineralization have occurred with complete crystalline fusion, these appear as lighter rounded areas on a stained section of dentin and are considered globular dentin. In contrast, the darker arc-like areas in a stained section of dentin are considered interglobular dentin. In these areas, only primary mineralization has occurred within the predentin, and the globules of dentin do not fuse completely. Thus, interglobular dentin is slightly less mineralized than globular dentin. Interglobular dentin is especially evident in coronal dentin, near the dentinoenamel junction (DEJ), and in certain dental anomalies, such as in dentinogenesis imperfecta.

=== Regional variations in dentin structure and composition ===

The different regions in dentin can be recognized due to their structural differences. The outermost layer, known as the mantle dentin layer, is found in the crown of the tooth. It can be identified by the presence of various characteristics, including collagen fibres found perpendicular to the enamel-dentin junction and it is slightly less mineralized (by approximately 5%, compared to the enamel. The dentin undergoes mineralization in the presence of matrix vesicles (&quot;hydroxyapatite-containing, membrane-enclosed vesicles secreted by odontoblasts, osteoblasts, and some chondrocytes; believed to serve as nucleation centers for the mineralization process in dentin, bone, and calcified cartilage.&quot;) The dentinal tubules in this region branch profusely.

In the root of the tooth there are two morphologically distinguishable outer layers: the hyaline layer on the periphery of dentin and the granular layer of Tomes beneath this. The granular layer has a dark, granular appearance which occurs due to the branching and looping back of dentinal tubules in this region. This appearance, specific to root dentin, is possibly due to differences in the rates of formation of coronal and root dentin. The hyaline layer, which has an obscure origin, is a clear layer, unlike the granular layer, with a width of up to 20μm. It can have clinical significance during periodontal regeneration.

Circumpulpal dentin forms the majority of the dentin and is generally constant in structure. Peripherally, mineralization can be seen to be incomplete, whereas centrally the mineralizing front shows ongoing mineralizing.

The innermost layer of dentin is known as predentin, and is the initial dentin matrix that is laid down prior to mineralization. It can be distinguished by its pale color when stained with haematoxylin and eosin. The presence of odontoblastic processes here allows the secretion of matrix components. Predentin can be 10-40μm in width, depending on its rate of deposition.

=== Microstructure and crack propagation ===
During the dentinogenesis process, the odontoblast cells retreat from the DEJ to the outer lining of the pulp, leaving behind microtubules filled with cytoplasmic extensions and depositing intertubular dentin (ITD) in its place. ITD comprises the bulk of the dentin and, similarly to bone, is a matrix composite of tablet-shaped hydroxyapatite nanoparticles wrapped around collagen fibers. The mineralized collagen fibers are arranged in layers oriented perpendicular to the direction of the dentin microtubules which are lined with peritubular dentin (PTD), a 1-2 μm thick layer of hydroxyapatite tablets with no preferred orientation and lacks any supporting collagen fibers.

The hydroxyapatite tablets within the ITD were found to be compressed along the crystallographic c-axis due to tight interaction between the tablets and the collagen fiber. Tablets aligned parallel with the collagen fibers experience a significant increase in compressive stress of around 90 MPa and, for crack formation to occur, tensile stresses must first overcome this residual compressive stress. Since typical mastication stresses do not exceed 40 MPa, the ITD prevents cracks from forming during normal daily use and helps deflect cracks perpendicular to the dentin tubule and away from the pulp.

Inelastic deformation of dentin primarily happens through microcracking. Crack propagation within dentin travels preferentially along the interfaces of the ITD layers. Since the PTD, the hydroxyapatite tablets are not preferentially orientated; they are under less compressive residual stress, causing the microtubules to act as crack initiation sites. This manifests as cross-hatched shear microcracks forming at the microtubules in compression and as ring-shaped microcracks in tension. The tip of a larger crack creates a stress concentration that helps initiate microcracks around the microtubules ahead of it, consuming energy and resisting further damage. The imperfect linking of the microcrack to a larger crack also induces &#x27;uncracked ligaments&#x27;, which help arrest the larger crack. In comparison, enamel does not display the same fracture resistance, and fractures traveling across the DEJ are usually stopped within ~10  μm. The combination of the residual stress and the perpendicular orientation of the ITD mineralized collagen fibers significantly increases the fracture toughness and fatigue endurance limit along the microtubule direction.

==Types==
Dentin is classified into three types: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Secondary dentin is a layer of dentin formed after the tooth&#x27;s root has fully formed. Tertiary dentin develops as a result of a stimulus, such as a carious attack or wear.

===Primary dentin===

Primary dentin, the most prominent dentin in the tooth, lies between the enamel and the pulp chamber (near dentinoenamel junction). The outer layer closest to enamel is known as mantle dentin. This layer is unique to the rest of primary dentin. Mantle dentin is formed by newly differentiated odontoblasts and forms a layer consistently 15-20 micrometers (μm) wide. Unlike primary dentin, mantle dentin lacks phosphorylation, has loosely packed collagen fibrils and is less mineralized. Below it lies the circumpulpal dentin, more mineralized dentin which makes up most of the dentin layer and is secreted after the mantle dentin by the odontoblasts. Circumpulpal dentin is formed before the root formation is completed.

Newly secreted dentin is unmineralized and is called predentin. It is easily identified in hematoxylin and eosin stained sections since it stains less intensely than dentin. It is usually 10-47μm and lines the innermost region of the dentin. It is unmineralized and consists of collagen, glycoproteins, and proteoglycans. It is similar to osteoid in bone and is thickest when dentinogenesis is occurring.

=== Secondary dentin ===

Secondary dentin (adventitious dentin) is formed after root formation is complete, normally after the tooth has erupted and is functional. It grows much more slowly than primary dentin but maintains its incremental aspect of growth. It has a similar structure to primary dentin, although its deposition is not always even around the pulp chamber. It appears greater in amounts on the roof and floor of the coronal pulp chamber, where it protects the pulp from exposure in older teeth. The secondary dentin formed is not in response to any external stimuli, and it appears very much similar to the primary dentine. It is the growth of this dentin that causes a decrease in the size of the pulp chamber with age. This is clinically known as pulp recession; cavity preparation in young patients, therefore, carries a greater risk of exposing the pulp. If this occurs, the pulp can be treated by different therapies such as direct pulp capping. Previously it was thought that Pulp capping was most successful if followed by a stainless steel crown, however this procedure is most of the times unnecessary in children. it requires the unnecessary removal of enamel which is key to the life of the tooth. Adhesive dentistry allows for conservative restoration techniques that minimize the loss of tooth structure and should be used. In order to maintain space in the primary dentition, attempts are made not to extract a pulpal exposure.

===Tertiary dentin (including reparative dentin and reactionary dentin) – pathologic===

Tertiary dentin is dentin formed as a reaction to external stimulation such as cavities and wear. It is of two types, either reactionary, where dentin is formed from a pre-existing odontoblast, or reparative, where newly differentiated odontoblast-like cells are formed due to the death of the original odontoblasts, from a pulpal progenitor cell. Tertiary dentin is only formed by an odontoblast directly affected by a stimulus; therefore, the architecture and structure depend on the intensity and duration of the stimulus, e.g., if the stimulus is a carious lesion, there is extensive destruction of dentin and damage to the pulp, due to the differentiation of bacterial metabolites and toxins. Thus, tertiary dentin is deposited rapidly, with a sparse and irregular tubular pattern and some cellular inclusions; in this case, it is referred to as &quot;osteodentin&quot;. Osteodentin is seen in Vit.A deficiency during development. However, if the stimulus is less active, it is laid down less rapidly with a more regular tubular pattern and hardly any cellular inclusions. The speed at which tertiary dentin forms also varies substantially among primate species.

==Defect and conditions==
===Dentinal sclerosis===
Dentinal sclerosis or transparent dentin sclerosis of primary dentin is a change in the structure of teeth characterized by calcification of dentinal tubules. It can occur as a result of injury to dentin by caries or abrasion, or as part of the normal aging process.

==Animal dentin==
Elephant ivory is solid dentin. The structure of the dentinal tubules contributes to both its porosity and its elasticity. Elephant tusks are formed with a thin cap of enamel, which soon wears away, leaving the dentin exposed. Exposed dentin in humans causes the symptom of sensitive teeth. Dentin is best known for its occurrence in teeth, but in early vertebrates, it was an important part of the dermal skeleton that covered most of the body, and it persists today in a few taxa such as the coelacanth.

Because dentin is softer than enamel, it wears away more quickly than enamel. Some mammalian teeth exploit this phenomenon, especially herbivores such as horses, deer or elephants. In many herbivores, the &quot;occlusal&quot; (biting) surface of the tooth is composed of alternating areas of dentin and enamel. Differential wearing causes sharp ridges of enamel to be formed on the surface of the tooth (typically a molar), and to remain during the working life of the tooth. Herbivores grind their molars together as they chew (&quot;masticate&quot;), and the ridges help to shred tough plant material.

In xenarthrans, enamel is generally absent, with the tooth instead consisting of alternating orthodentine and vasodentine.

A material similar to dentin forms the hard material that makes up dermal denticles in sharks and other cartilaginous fish.

<doc id="865925" wikidata="Q585926" url="?curid=865925" title="Antoine Coypel">
<text>Antoine Coypel (; 11 April 16617 January 1722) was a French painter, pastellist, engraver, decorative designer and draughtsman. He became court painter first to Philippe I, Duke of Orléans, and later to King Louis XV. He became director of the Académie Royale. He was given the title of &quot;Garde des tableaux et dessins du roi&quot; (Keeper of the paintings and drawings of the king), a function which combined the role of director and curator of the king&#x27;s art collection. He was raised to the nobility by the French king. He is known for his history paintings, biblical, mythological and allegorical works, portraits and genre scenes.

==Life==

Antoine Coypel was born in Paris as the son of the French painter Noël Coypel. He studied under his father, with whom he spent four years in Rome after his father had been appointed director of the French academy in 1672. In Rome he sketched the Antique monuments and artworks and studied the works of the Italian Renaissance and Baroque, in particular of Raphael, Carracci, Titian, Veronese and Correggio. He became acquainted with the contemporary artists Gianlorenzo Bernini and Carlo Maratta. Bernini became his mentor. He won a prize for drawing at the Accademia di San Luca, the association of artists in Rome.

Coypel completed his training at the Académie Royale in Paris. In 1689 he received an important commission for an altarpiece in the Notre-Dame de Paris. In 1681, at the age of 20 he was admitted (reçu) as a full member of the Académie royale with the submission of a work called &quot;Louis XIV repose dans le sein de la Gloire après la paix de Nimègue&quot; (Louis XIV rests in the bosom of Glory after the Peace of Nijmegen) (Musée Fabre). He worked on many of the French king&#x27;s construction projects of that time including in Versailles, Trianon, Marly and Meudon. He was in 1685 appointed premier peintre of the Duke of Orléans (the French king&#x27;s eldest brother who at the time was Philippe I, Duke of Orléans). The House of Orléans remained an important patron of the artist for many years. Between 1701 and 1706, he created one of his most brilliant works for the d&#x27;Orléans family, the vault of the Aeneas Gallery in the Palais-Royal (now disappeared). The work was completed a few years later by a cycle of seven additional paintings.
Coypel became professor and rector of the Academy in 1707 and director in 1714, and in 1716 was appointed king&#x27;s painter. He was raised to the nobility the following year. He completed an extensive decoration of the ceiling of the Royal chapel at Versailles in 1708, in the manner of the Roman Baroque.

His half-brother Noël-Nicolas and his son Charles-Antoine Coypel (1694–1752) were also accomplished painters. The sculptor François Dumont was his brother-in-law.

Coypel died in 1722, at 61 years of age.

==Paintings==
Antoine Coypel&#x27;s style was eclectic. He worked initially in the French classical tradition which he renewed with a colourful palette. He went through a period in which he was strongly influenced by Rubens as is clear in certain paintings, in particular his &quot;Democritus&quot; (1692, Louvre). Coypel&#x27;s spirit of renewal is evident in the series of large paintings on Old Testament themes, which were very well received at the time: &quot;Susan accused of adultery&quot; (c. 1695, Museo del Prado) and &quot;The sacrifice of Jephta&#x27;s daughter&quot; (c. 1695-1697 Musée Magnin). He was, with Jean Jouvenet, Charles de La Fosse and Louis de Boullogne, one of the best examples of the transition in French painting from the austere manner of the reign of Louis XIV to the lighter style of the 18th century.

==Drawings==
Coypel was one of the leading draughtsmen of his generation. About 500 of his drawings survive, many of them kept at the Louvre. They comprise figure studies and preparatory drawings for his paintings. He was particularly skilled in the use of coloured pencils and chalks.

<text>Noël Coypel (; 25 December 1628 – 24 December 1707) was a French painter, and was also called Coypel le Poussin, because he was heavily influenced by Poussin.

==Biography==
His father, Guyon Coypel, was an unsuccessful artist, originally from Cherbourg. He began his studies in Orléans with an artist named Pierre Poncet, who had been a student of Simon Vouet. At the age of fourteen, he went to Paris. There, he found work in the studios of Noël Quillerier. His progress was rapid. In 1646, aged only eighteen, he was employed in preparing the decorations for the opera &quot;Orfeo&quot; by Luigi Rossi. 

This attracted the attention of Charles Errard, who was responsible for the artwork at the Oratoire and the King&#x27;s Bedroom at the Louvre, who engaged him to do some paintings. He would work exclusively on the orders of Louis XIV for almost twenty years, creating several paintings for the King&#x27;s apartments and, following the King&#x27;s marriage, the ceilings of the Queen&#x27;s apartment. He also painted at the Tuileries and Fontainebleau. 

In 1659, he married Madeleine Hérault (1641–1682), an art student. That same year, he presented himself at the Académie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture but, due to the amount of work he was doing for the King, his official reception was postponed until early in 1663. Later that year, he displayed his reception piece, &quot;The Reprobation of Cain After the Death of Abel&quot;. He was named an assistant professor the following year, and became a full Professor a few months later. 

He was appointed Director of the French Academy in Rome in 1672, succeeding his former mentor, Errard, who had served for the first six years of the Academy&#x27;s existence. His son, Antoine, and his brother-in-law, the landscape painter Charles-Antoine Hérault, accompanied him. He held that office until 1675. During his administration, the Academy was finally established at the Palazzo Capranica. While there, he continued to produce paintings for the Royal Family and developed an enthusiasm for mythological themes. In 1673, he was admitted to the Académie de Saint-Luc. 

Upon returning to Paris, he resumed his work for the King. In 1685, three years after his wife&#x27;s death, he married Anne-Françoise Perrin (1665–1728), another young art student. They had fourteen children, most of whom died in infancy. A notable exception was their son, Noël-Nicolas Coypel, who also became a well-known painter.

The Marquis de Louvois and the Marquis de Villacerf engaged him to create some designs for the Gobelins Manufactory. In 1689, he was elected Deputy Rector for the Académie Royale. He was promoted to Rector in 1690, and to the Directorship in 1695, replacing the late Pierre Mignard. In 1702, he reassumed the position of Rector. Three years later, at the age of seventy-seven, he undertook a project to paint frescoes above the high altar at the Église des Invalides. This difficult work resulted in a long, serious illness that led to his death on Christmas Eve in 1707.

<text>Railroad Model Craftsman is an American magazine specializing in the hobby of model railroading. The magazine is published monthly by White River Productions, which acquired the title from Carstens Publications in 2014. Its first issue in March 1933 was called The Model Craftsman because it covered other areas of scale modeling as well. Founded by Emanuele Stieri, it was second editor Charles A. Penn who helped grow the company and lead the publication towards the hobby of scale models. In April 1949 it changed its focus to model trains and changed its name to Railroad Model Craftsman to reflect this change in editorial content. While it can claim to be the oldest model railroading magazine in continuous publication in the United States, rival &quot;Model Railroader&quot; counters with the tagline &quot;Model railroading &quot;exclusively&quot; since 1934.&quot; (However, both were predated by &quot;The Model Maker,&quot; which dates from 1924, and showcased working models of steam engines, trains, and boats.) 
Over the years, several other titles have been folded into the publication, including &quot;Toy Trains, Electric Trains and Hobby Railroading, Miniature Rail Roading, Model &amp; Railway News,&quot; and &quot;The O Gager.&quot;

== History ==
=== 1933–1962: Stieri and Penn years ===
The company was founded in 1933 by Emanuele Stieri, a prolific how-to writer, and was the first editor-in-chief of the fledgling publication. Published by Model Craftsman Publishing Corp., the company moved headquarters from Chicago to New York City in 1934. The company was acquired by Charles A. Penn in 1935. The company relocated to suburban Ramsey, New Jersey in 1940. During the 1940s, the staff consisted of Charles Penn as editor and publisher, Robert W. Thompson as managing editor, Lewis Austin as the model railroad editor, Leon Shulman as the model airplane editor, and Louis H. Hertz as the research editor. After World War II, Robert Thompson was succeeded by his brother Jim as managing editor.

In December 1940, the magazine absorbed &quot;The Modelmaker,&quot; which was first published by Spon &amp; Chamberlain in January 1924 and was the only magazine dedicated to model building until Model Craftsman was founded. The magazine also increased to 74 pages. 

As the magazine&#x27;s editorial focus shifted entirely toward the hobby of model railroading, the publication was renamed &quot;Model Railroad Craftsman&quot; in April 1949. Feeling the name was too close to that of &quot;Model Railroader&quot;, publisher Al Kalmbach asked for a slight name change as professional courtesy. As a result, &quot;Railroad Model Craftsman&quot; debuted in July 1949.

Harold Carstens joined the staff as an associate editor in 1952, after previously contributing several articles. As of 1954, the magazine staff consisted of Charles Penn as editor and publisher, Jim Thompson as executive editor, Hal Carstens as managing editor, Sam Skean, Bill Schopp as technical editor, and Edwin P. Alexander as research editor.

=== 1962–2014: Under the Carstens ===
In 1962, Hal Carstens was named publisher and president following the retirement of Charles Penn. Hal Carstens later purchased the company, and the name was changed to Carstens Publications in 1969. Tony Koester joined the staff as an associate editor in 1968, and later became managing editor in 1971. By 1972, Jim Boyd was working full-time as editor of &quot;Flying Models,&quot; but was also listed as an associate editor of RMC. The last big move came in 1973 when the publishing company moved to rural Newton in northern New Jersey, housed in a newly constructed suite of offices with an attached warehouse. Koester and Boyd worked together to push more modern prototype content and fine scale modeling features in contrast to the more loose interpretations of the hobby previously published by Hal Carstens. Boyd would be named editor of the new &quot;Railfan &amp; Railroad&quot; magazine launched by Carstens in 1974.

By 1980, Jim Boyd and Bill Schaumburg were listed as associate editors (Bill joined the staff in November 1976). In 1981, Bill Schaumburg succeeded Koester as managing editor, and Chris D&#x27;Amato and Jim Ankrom joined the staff as associate editors in 1982. By the mid-1980s, Boyd was dropped from the masthead as he was now concentrating full-time as editor of &quot;Railfan &amp; Railroad&quot;.

The magazine was published 12 times a year by Carstens Publications, located in Newton, New Jersey. As its name would suggest, &quot;Railroad Model Craftsman&quot; concentrates more on scratch building and kitbashing than its closest competitor. In-depth features relating to prototype historical research, model construction techniques, and high-quality detailing and finishing are common themes. The editors have also closely followed the emerging trend of Railway Prototype Modelers, who seek to reproduce scale replicas of actual existing pieces of railway equipment as closely as possible, and share those techniques with other modelers. Although the magazine is not scale-specific, most of its plans are published either in HO scale or O scale, with instructions on converting them to other scales. Almost all of the content in the magazine is generated by readers, with very few articles produced by the editors.

Publisher Hal Carstens died on June 23, 2009, with his son Henry Carstens assuming day-to-day control of the company.

Enjoying a long career as RMC&#x27;s longest serving editor, Bill Schaumburg retired in February 2013. After his departure, the staff of the magazine consisted of editor Chris D&#x27;Amato, associate editor Jim Ankrom, and part-time associate editor Scott Lupia. Most of the accompanying art work, maps, and track plans were produced by illustrators Ken Lawrence and Otto Vondrak.

=== Since 2014: White River Productions ===
After years of financial struggle, Carstens Publications president Henry Carstens announced the company&#x27;s permanent closure on August 22, 2014. On September 1, 2014, White River Productions of Bucklin, Missouri, announced their acquisition of Railroad Model Craftsman as well as sister publication &quot;Railfan &amp; Railroad&quot;. Beginning with the January 2015 issue, the primary editorial staff consisted of Stephen Priest and Tony Cook, the first major change since the 1980s. Harry K. Wong later joined the staff as an associate editor. The magazine was completely redesigned, and some columns were retired, while others have been renamed (&quot;Safety Valve&quot; became &quot;Postmarks&quot; in 2014, restored to its original name in 2019). The magazine continued to produce in-depth features focused on scale model construction and prototype research.

In February 2019, Otto Vondrak was named the eighth editor of Railroad Model Craftsman, effective with the May 2019 issue, and splitting his duties as associate editor of &quot;Railfan &amp; Railroad&quot;. The rest of the staff consists of Harry K. Wong as associate editor, and Todd Gillette as graphic designer. In April 2020, Justin Franz joined the staff as associate editor.

== Magazine sections ==
The main part of the magazine is dedicated to the features. The subjects can range from a tour of a model railroad; to historical research related to a structure, piece of equipment, or entire railroad line; to the construction, painting, and detailing of a scale model.

Safety Valve - (Formerly &quot;Postmarks&quot; from 2014-2019) A column of letters submitted to the editors by the readers of RMC expressing opinions about or sharing news related to features published in the magazine. Printed on a space-available basis.

Receiving Yard - (Formerly &quot;Dispatcher&#x27;s Report&quot;) This section features announcements from various hobby manufacturers of new model railroading products available. Descriptions are brief and contain contact information for the manufacturer or their representative, compiled by associate editor Harry K. Wong.

Railbooks - Various new books and recordings related to the world of railroading and scale models are reviewed in-depth by the editors and other authors.

Timetable - A listing of model railroad related events taking place around the country, submitted by readers, and published on a space-available basis.

Dremel Kitbashing Award - Co-sponsored by hobby tool manufacturer Dremel, is awarded to a hobbyist who completes a well-executed kitbashing project in any scale, using a variety of model building techniques. Dremel ended its support for the award in 2022, ending a 50-year run.

Scratchbuilder&#x27;s Workshop - (Formerly &quot;Scratchbuilder&#x27;s Corner&quot;) This regular monthly column was launched in 2002. Each month, veteran model builder Bob Walker discusses tips, techniques, and philosophy related to the construction of scale models from scratch, otherwise known as &quot;scratchbuilding.&quot; Walker retired from the column in 2019, and a number of authors contribute to the monthly Craftsman Workshop column in its place.

<doc id="865939" wikidata="Q3554829" url="?curid=865939" title="Rational variety">
<text>In mathematics, a rational variety is an algebraic variety, over a given field &quot;K&quot;, which is birationally equivalent to a projective space of some dimension over &quot;K&quot;. This means that its function field is isomorphic to
:formula_1
the field of all rational functions for some set formula_2 of indeterminates, where &quot;d&quot; is the dimension of the variety.

==Rationality and parameterization==

Let &quot;V&quot; be an affine algebraic variety of dimension &quot;d&quot; defined by a prime ideal &quot;I&quot; = ⟨&quot;f&quot;1, ..., &quot;f&quot;&quot;k&quot;⟩ in formula_3. If &quot;V&quot; is rational, then there are &quot;n&quot; + 1 polynomials &quot;g&quot;0, ..., &quot;g&quot;&quot;n&quot; in formula_4 such that formula_5 In other words, we have a formula_6 of the variety.

Conversely, such a rational parameterization induces a field homomorphism of the field of functions of &quot;V&quot; into formula_4. But this homomorphism is not necessarily onto. If such a parameterization exists, the variety is said to be unirational. Lüroth&#x27;s theorem (see below) implies that unirational curves are rational. Castelnuovo&#x27;s theorem implies also that, in characteristic zero, every unirational surface is rational.

==Rationality questions==
A rationality question asks whether a given field extension is &quot;rational&quot;, in the sense of being (up to isomorphism) the function field of a rational variety; such field extensions are also described as purely transcendental. More precisely, the rationality question for the field extension formula_8 is this: is formula_9 isomorphic to a rational function field over formula_10 in the number of indeterminates given by the transcendence degree?

There are several different variations of this question, arising from the way in which the fields formula_10 and formula_9 are constructed.

For example, let formula_10 be a field, and let

:formula_14

be indeterminates over &quot;K&quot; and let &quot;L&quot; be the field generated over &quot;K&quot; by them. Consider a finite group formula_15 permuting those indeterminates over &quot;K&quot;. By standard Galois theory, the set of fixed points of this group action is a subfield of formula_9, typically denoted formula_17. The rationality question for formula_18 is called Noether&#x27;s problem and asks if this field of fixed points is or is not a purely transcendental extension of &quot;K&quot;.
In the paper on Galois theory she studied the problem of parameterizing the equations with given Galois group, which she reduced to &quot;Noether&#x27;s problem&quot;. (She first mentioned this problem in where she attributed the problem to E. Fischer.) She showed this was true for &quot;n&quot; = 2, 3, or 4. found a counter-example to the Noether&#x27;s problem, with &quot;n&quot; = 47 and &quot;G&quot; a cyclic group of order 47.

==Lüroth&#x27;s theorem==

A celebrated case is Lüroth&#x27;s problem, which Jacob Lüroth solved in the nineteenth century. Lüroth&#x27;s problem concerns subextensions &quot;L&quot; of &quot;K&quot;(&quot;X&quot;), the rational functions in the single indeterminate &quot;X&quot;. Any such field is either equal to &quot;K&quot; or is also rational, i.e. &quot;L&quot; = &quot;K&quot;(&quot;F&quot;) for some rational function &quot;F&quot;. In geometrical terms this states that a non-constant rational map from the projective line to a curve &quot;C&quot; can only occur when &quot;C&quot; also has genus 0. That fact can be read off geometrically from the Riemann–Hurwitz formula.

==Unirationality==

A unirational variety &quot;V&quot; over a field &quot;K&quot; is one dominated by a rational variety, so that its function field &quot;K&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) lies in a pure transcendental field of finite type (which can be chosen to be of finite degree over &quot;K&quot;(&quot;V&quot;) if &quot;K&quot; is infinite). The solution of Lüroth&#x27;s problem shows that for algebraic curves, rational and unirational are the same, and Castelnuovo&#x27;s theorem implies that for complex surfaces unirational implies rational, because both are characterized by the vanishing of both the arithmetic genus and the second plurigenus. Zariski found some examples (Zariski surfaces) in characteristic &quot;p&quot; &gt; 0 that are unirational but not rational. showed that a cubic three-fold is in general not a rational variety, providing an example for three dimensions that unirationality does not imply rationality. Their work used an intermediate Jacobian. 
 showed that all non-singular quartic threefolds are irrational, though some of them are unirational. found some unirational 3-folds with non-trivial torsion in their third cohomology group, which implies that they are not rational.

For any field &quot;K&quot;, János Kollár proved in 2000 that a smooth cubic hypersurface of dimension at least 2 is unirational if it has a point defined over &quot;K&quot;. This is an improvement of many classical results, beginning with the case of cubic surfaces (which are rational varieties over an algebraic closure). Other examples of varieties that are shown to be unirational are many cases of the moduli space of curves.

==Rationally connected variety ==
A rationally connected variety &quot;V&quot; is a projective algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field such that through every two points there passes the image of a regular map from the projective line into &quot;V&quot;. Equivalently, a variety is rationally connected if every two points are connected by a rational curve contained in the variety.

This definition differs from that of path connectedness only by the nature of the path, but is very different, as the only algebraic curves which are rationally connected are the rational ones.

Every rational variety, including the projective spaces, is rationally connected, but the converse is false. The class of the rationally connected varieties is thus a generalization of the class of the rational varieties. Unirational varieties are rationally connected, but it is not known if the converse holds.

==Stably rational varieties==

A variety &quot;V&quot; is called &quot;stably rational&quot; if formula_19 is rational for some formula_20. Any rational variety is thus, by definition, stably rational. Examples constructed by show, that the converse is false however.

 showed that very general hypersurfaces formula_21 are not stably rational, provided that the degree of &quot;V&quot; is at least formula_22.

<text>Noël-Nicolas Coypel (; 17 November 1690, Paris – 14 December 1734, Paris) was a French Baroque painter.

==Biography==
His father, Noël Coypel, was a well-known artist, as was his half-brother, Antoine Coypel, who was almost thirty years his senior. He learned the basic elements of painting from them. After winning several awards from the Académie Royale, he received their accreditation in 1716 and became a full member in 1720, when Antoine was the Rector there. His reception piece was a depiction of the god Neptune abducting the nymph Amymone.

In 1727, King Louis XV announced a competition to promote history painting at the Académie. Coypel submitted &quot;The Triumph of Amphitrite&quot;. Although it failed to win a prize, it proved to have great popular appeal.

Encouraged by this, he sought to make himself better known by offering to paint the Chapel of the Virgin at the 13th century , without remuneration. The ceiling was especially noted, for what was described as its &quot;unusual composition&quot;. His works there were short-lived however, as a reconstruction project that began in 1787 was interrupted by the Revolution and ended with the church being demolished.

He also created a painting for the Order of Minims at the Place des Vosges, representing Saint Francis of Paola crossing the sea with his companions. Shortly after, he executed two paintings in the secret chapel of the Sorbonne; a Saint Anthony and a Saint Hillary. King Louis owned a copy of his &quot;Glory of the Angels&quot;, displayed at Versailles, and a Nativity scene in the Queen&#x27;s private oratory 
In 1733. he was appointed to a professorship at the Académie. The following year, he died suddenly from an unspecified &quot;domestic accident&quot;.

<text>Rille (German for &#x27;groove&#x27;) is typically used to describe any of the long, narrow depressions in the surface of the Moon that resemble channels. The Latin term is &quot;rima&quot;, plural &quot;rimae&quot;. Typically, a rille can be several kilometers wide and hundreds of kilometers in length. However, the term has also been used loosely to describe similar structures on a number of planets in the Solar System, including Mars, Venus, and on a number of moons. All bear a structural resemblance to each other.

==Structures==
Three types of rille are found on the lunar surface:

* Sinuous rilles meander in a curved path like a mature river, and are commonly thought to be the remains of collapsed lava tubes or extinct lava flows. They usually begin at an extinct volcano, then meander and sometimes split as they are followed across the surface. , 195 sinuous rilles have been identified on the Moon. Vallis Schröteri in Oceanus Procellarum is the largest sinuous rille, and Rima Hadley is the only one visited by humans, on the Apollo 15 mission. Another prominent example is Rima Herigonius.
* Arcuate rilles have a smooth curve and are found on the edges of the dark lunar maria. They are believed to have formed when the lava flows that created a mare cooled, contracted and sank. These are found all over the Moon, examples can be seen near the south-western border of Mare Tranquillitatis and on the south-eastern border of Mare Humorum. Rima Sulpicius Gallus is a clear example in southwestern Mare Serenitatis.
* Straight rilles follow long, linear paths and are believed to be grabens, sections of the crust that have sunk between two parallel faults. These can be readily identified when they pass through craters or mountain ranges. Vallis Alpes is by far the largest graben rille, indeed it is regarded as too large to be called a rille and is itself bisected by a linear rille; Rima Ariadaeus, west of Mare Tranquillitatis, is a clearer example.

Rilles which show more than one structure are termed hybrid rilles. Rima Hyginus in Sinus Medii is an example, initially formed through a fault and subsequently subject to volcanic activity.

==Formation==
Precise formation mechanisms of rilles have yet to be determined. It is likely that the different types are formed by different processes. Common features shared by lunar rilles and similar structures on other bodies suggest that common causative mechanisms operate widely in the solar system. Leading theories include lava channels, collapsed lava tubes, near-surface dike intrusion, &quot;nuée ardente&quot; (pyroclastic cloud), subsidence of lava-covered basin and crater floors, and tectonic extension. On-site examination would be necessary to clarify exact methods.

===Sinuous rilles===
According to NASA, the origin of lunar sinuous rilles remains controversial. The Hadley Rille is a 1.5 km wide and over 300 m deep sinuous rille. It is thought to be a giant conduit that carried lava from an eruptive vent far to the south. Topographic information obtained from the Apollo 15 photographs supports this possibility; however, many puzzles about the rille remain.

<doc id="865961" wikidata="Q585323" url="?curid=865961" title="Franz von Lenbach">
<text>Franz Seraph Lenbach, after 1882, Ritter von Lenbach (13 December 1836 – 6 May 1904), was a German painter known primarily for his portraits of prominent personalities from the nobility, the arts, and industry. Because of his standing in society, he was often referred to as the &quot;Malerfürst&quot; (Painter Prince).

==Biography==
His father, who originally came from South Tyrol where the family name was spelled &quot;Lempach&quot;, was a Master Mason for Schrobenhausen, where Lenbach was born. Lenbach completed his primary education at Landsberg in 1848, then attended a business school in Landshut. From 1851 to 1852, he was apprenticed to the sculptor Anselm Sickinger in Munich. At that time, his father died and he went home to help in the family business.

He was only there a short time before beginning studies at the Augsburg University of Applied Sciences. While there, he drew and painted in his spare time, befriended Johann Baptist Hofner (1832–1913), the animal painter, and decided to become an artist. In 1854, he obtained his family&#x27;s reluctant permission to study at the Academy of Fine Arts, Munich, and later took private lessons from Hermann Anschütz. 

Lenbach was already an accomplished artist when he became the pupil of Karl von Piloty. In 1858, he was able to stage an exhibition at the Glaspalast and won a travel scholarship, which enabled him to accompany Piloty to Rome. A few works remain as the outcome of this first journey: &quot;A Peasant seeking Shelter from Bad Weather&quot; (1855), &quot;The Goatherd&quot; (1860, in the Schack Gallery, Munich) and &quot;The Arch of Titus&quot; (in the Palfy collection, Budapest). He also travelled to Paris and Brussels. It was about then that he started receiving his first portrait commissions.

On returning to Munich, he was at once called to Weimar to take the appointment of professor at the newly established Weimar Saxon Grand Ducal Art School, where he became known for taking his students on painting expeditions en plein aire. He remained for only two years, however, when he felt the need for more studies and decided to take another trip to Italy. During this time, he also found an important patron; Baron Adolf Friedrich von Schack. Through his support, Lenbach was able to leave for Italy in 1863 with a guaranteed annual income. 

He returned to Munich in 1866. The following year, he won a gold medal at the Exposition Universelle and went to Spain for one year, accompanied by his student, Ernst Friedrich von Liphart, to make more copies of the Old Masters for Schack. Upon returning, his career as a portrait painter began in earnest. His breakthrough came in 1869, when he won a gold medal at the Glaspalast, despite being up against many fashionable French painters. After 1870, he began making visits to Vienna to develop a market for his paintings there, which even survived the Panic of 1873. It is also said that he travelled there frequently because he had a passion for Maria Beccadelli di Bologna, which was never returned.

From 1875 to 1876 he, Hans Makart, and other associates made a trip to Egypt, which left a deep impression in his style. In 1882, he was awarded the Order of Merit of the Bavarian Crown, which entitled him to become &quot;Von Lenbach&quot;. The following year, he was back in Rome, where he lived in apartments at the Palazzo Borghese. One of his sitters was Clara Schumann, whose portrait he drew in pastel in 1878. In 1885, he was commissioned to do a portrait of Pope Leo XIII. As the Pope did not have time to sit for the portrait, a new technique was used to create a photographic template. He left Rome in 1887 and began building a villa in Munich. Later that year, he married Countess Magdalena Moltke.

By the 1890s, he was painting almost entirely from photographs, a common practice at the time, but he also began working too fast, in an effort to create sufficient income. In 1895, a major scandal erupted when one of his assistants took unfinished paintings and sketches, had students fill in the details, and passed them off as Lenbach&#x27;s work. In 1896, he and Magdalena were divorced, over suspicions of infidelity with her doctor, Ernst Schweninger, whom she did in fact later marry. Lenbach also remarried, to Charlotte von Hornstein, daughter of the composer Robert von Hornstein.

He refused to join the Munich Secession and was highly critical of the new Bavarian National Museum. He also began to paint women, almost exclusively, whereas before he had concentrated on men. Around 1900, he started to produce trading card designs for the Stollwerck chocolate company of Cologne.

In 1902, he became an honorary Knight in the Légion d’Honneur. That same year, he suffered a stroke while returning from a trip to his home town and never fully recovered. He died at his Munich villa two years later. He was buried at the Westfriedhof and many prominent figures spoke at his funeral.

==Legacy==

Some of Lenbach&#x27;s paintings are now in national collections in the United Kingdom, including portraits by Lenbach of Bismarck and Gladstone in the National Galleries of Scotland and another of Gladstone in the Palace of Westminster. Others are in the Frye Art Museum in Seattle, Washington.

==Third Reich era==
Lenbach&#x27;s paintings were much prized by top Nazis and given as gifts by underlings. Goebbels gifted Hitler a Lenbach in 1936, writing in his diary, &quot;(Hitler) is very touched and takes the greatest joy in my Lenbach&quot;. Lenbachs were also looted from Jewish collectors like the Löw-Beer family in Brněnec, Rudolf Mosse in Berlin, Sigmund Bernstein, and many others. The database of the German Lost Art Foundation lists 108 entries for Lenbach. The ERR database for objects seized in France (the &quot;Cultural Plunder by the Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg: Database of Art Objects at the Jeu de Paume&quot;) lists six artworks by Lenbach.

<text>John Paul Tremblay (born May 17, 1968) is a Canadian actor, screenwriter, and comedian who is best known for his role as Julian in the TV series &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;.

== Career ==
Before acting in &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot;, Tremblay and his future co-star Robb Wells owned a chain of pizza restaurants called J.R. Capone&#x27;s. Trailer Park Boys is written by Tremblay along with co-stars Robb Wells and Mike Smith.

Tremblay starred in the film adaptation of the series, which was released in 2006. The film was mostly filmed in the municipality of Halifax. 

Tremblay and Wells also appeared in the 2002 family film &quot;Virginia&#x27;s Run&quot;, though not as Ricky and Julian. 

In 2010, Tremblay appeared with many of his former &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; castmates in the new series &quot;The Drunk and On Drugs Happy Fun Time Hour&quot;. In 2011, Tremblay again reunited with Trailer Park Boys castmates Robb Wells and Mike Smith for the live comedy show Drunk, High and Unemployed, which toured across the United States.

Tremblay reunited with the &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; for an eighth and ninth season of the show which premiered on Netflix from September 5, 2014. Writing for seasons 10 &amp; 11 began in January 2015. Filming began for season 10 in June 2015. Season 10 of the show was released March 28, 2016, the eleventh on March 31, 2017, and the twelfth and most recent season was released on March 30, 2018. This concluded with most of the main characters entering an animated reality after taking an overdose of hallucinogenic mushrooms, which led into &quot;Trailer Park Boys: The Animated Series&quot; released in 2019.

<text>&quot;The Daemon Lover&quot; (Roud 14, Child 243) – also known as &quot;James Harris&quot;, &quot;A Warning for Married Women&quot;, &quot;The Distressed Ship Carpenter&quot;, &quot;James Herries&quot;, &quot;The Carpenter’s Wife&quot;, &quot;The Banks of Italy&quot;, or &quot;The House-Carpenter&quot; – is a popular ballad dating from the mid-seventeenth century, when the earliest known broadside version of the ballad was entered in the &quot;Stationers&#x27; Register&quot; on 21 February 1657.

==History and different versions==

There are a number of different versions of the ballad. In addition to the eight collected by Francis James Child in volume IV of his anthology &quot;The English and Scottish Popular Ballads&quot; (versions A to H), others can be found in Britain and in the United States, where it remained especially widespread, with hundreds of versions being collected throughout the years, around 250 of them in print. In comparison, only four new variants were recorded in the UK in the time between Child&#x27;s death in 1896 and the second half of the 1960s, all of them before 1910.

===&quot;A Warning for Married Women&quot; (Child A)===

The oldest version of the ballad – labeled 243 A in Child&#x27;s anthology and originally signed with the initials L.P. – is generally attributed to Laurence Price, a prominent ballad writer of that time. The original, full title of the broadside was &quot;A Warning for Married Women, by the example of Mrs. Jane Renalds, a West-Country woman born neer unto Plymouth, who having plighted her troth to a seaman, was afterwards married to a carpenter, and at last carried away by a spirit, the manner how shall be presently recited&quot;. The broadside does not seem to be a recasting of a pre-existing folk ballad in circulation, although it bears some similarities to other ballads, most notably a similarly named &quot;A Warning for Maidens&quot;, also known by the title &quot;Bateman&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; (Roud 22132).

&quot;A Warning for Married Women&quot; tells the story of Jane Reynolds and her lover James Harris, with whom she exchanged a promise of marriage. He is pressed as a sailor before the wedding takes place and Jane faithfully awaits his return for three years, but when she learns of his death at sea, she agrees to marry a local carpenter. Jane gives birth to three children and for four years the couple lives a happy life. One night, when the carpenter is away, the spirit of James Harris appears. He tries to convince Jane to keep her oath and run away with him. At first she is reluctant to do so, because of her husband and their children, but ultimately she succumbs to the ghost&#x27;s pleas, letting herself be persuaded by his tales of rejecting the royal daughter&#x27;s hand and assurance that he has the means to support her – namely, a fleet of seven ships. The pair then leaves England, never to be seen again, and the carpenter commits suicide upon learning that his wife is gone. The broadside ends with a mention that although the children were orphaned, the heavenly powers will provide for them.

===&quot;The Distressed Ship Carpenter&quot; (Child B)===

Another known version of the ballad, labeled 243 B in Child&#x27;s anthology and titled ‘The Distressed Ship Carpenter’, comes from the mid-eighteenth century and appears in &quot;A Collection of Diverting Songs, Epigrams, &amp; c.&quot; and in a chapbook titled &quot;The Rambler’s Garland&quot;. It is notable for its opening, ‘Well met, well met, my own true love’, which is characteristic of many versions of the ballad, in particular those recorded in America. This variation differs from &quot;A Warning for Married Women&quot;. The opening part of the ballad is lost, and so are the names of Jane and James; the text does not mention their former vows either. The former lover appears to be a mortal man, rather than a revenant. &quot;The Distressed Ship Carpenter&quot; ends with the eponymous craftsman lamenting and cursing seamen for ruining his life. With the disappearance of the supernatural elements, the story of the ballad became rationalized. These changes may have originated in an oral tradition or, as suggested by John Burrison, there was an intermediary broadside version of the ballad that served as a bridge between &quot;A Warning’&quot; and &quot;The Distressed Ship Carpenter&quot;; David Atkinson considers a possibility that the changes were made either to avoid any legal troubles with the intellectual property owners of &quot;A Warning&quot; or as a result of a change in broadside format to smaller sheets.

&quot;The Distressed Ship Carpenter&quot; is characterized by a number of common folk touches, possibly indicating that there was an intermediary folk version developed as a result of an oral tradition between this version of the ballad and the original broadside. The story begins in the third act, contains recurring words and phrases and is leaping and lingering, i.e. alternating between rapid and slow unfoldment of the events, at two crucial points: when relating the return of the former lover and the lovers’ confrontation after they board the ship. In doing so, the ballad preserves and focuses on its &quot;emotional core&quot;.

===Scottish and American traditions===

&quot;A Warning for Married Women&quot; and &quot;The Distressed Ship Carpenter&quot; seem to have inspired the Scottish and American traditions of the ballad, respectively. The Scottish versions collected by Child (designated as versions C-G) share a number of elements with Child 243 A not present in Child 243 B – among them a direct reference to former vows and the name of the sailor – but what distinguishes them most is the character of a lover, who regains his supernatural nature. What is especially characteristic of these versions is the introduction of a daemonic presence; in &quot;The Daemon Lover&quot; (Child 243 E, F, G) James Harris is no longer a ghost or a mortal man, but instead is revealed to be a cloven-footed devil.

It is generally agreed that copies collected in America (usually titled &quot;The House Carpenter&quot;) were derived from &quot;The Distressed Ship Carpenter&quot;. There are a number of similarities between these versions – such as the absence of former vows and supernatural elements characteristic of &quot;A Warning&quot; and Scottish versions – and the story presented in them remains essentially the same. Some elements taken from the Scottish tradition are present in American variants, for example &quot;hills of heaven, hills of hell&quot; line from Child 243 E, but the influence of &quot;The Distressed Ship Carpenter&quot; is prevalent. The most notable differences when compared to the English and Scottish traditions are their setting (i.e. &quot;the banks of Italy&quot; become &quot;the banks of old Tennessee&quot;) and more emphasis being put on the relationship between the mother and the child and their subsequent parting. The American history of the ballad in printed form dates back to the 1850s. Two verses that were printed in Philadelphia (1858; Child included them in his anthology), along with a broadside printed by Andrews of New York (ca. 1857; reissued by De Marsan in 1860) are the earliest known examples of the ballad in the United States, although the oral tradition had already existed there before they were published and it played a predominant role in the spread of the ballad in America.

==Tune and metre==

Referring to broadsides that were already in circulation for the tune was a common habit and so the original broadsides of &quot;A Warning for Married Women&quot; name the tune to which the ballad was to be sung as &quot;The Fair Maid of Bristol&quot;, &quot;Bateman&quot;, or &quot;John True&quot;. These three tunes are also identified as &quot;The Lady’s Fall&quot;, which was notably the tune for &quot;Bateman’s Tragedy&quot; (Roud 22132) and numerous other early seventeenth-century broadsides, most of which contained themes of &quot;crimes, monstrous births, or warnings of God’s judgement.&quot; Later, eighteenth-century copies of &quot;The Distressed Ship Carpenter&quot; carried no tune designation whatsoever. &quot;A Warning for Married Women&quot; and &quot;The Distressed Ship Carpenter&quot; were printed respectively in 32 four-line stanzas (in ballad metre) and 13 to 14 four-line stanzas (in long measure, described by Atkinson as “slightly awkward” at times).

==Themes==

&quot;A Warning for Married Women&quot; addresses the themes of marriage, unfaithfulness and bigamy. David Atkinson writes that it can be seen as &quot;a reinforcement of prevailing patriarchal family relationships.&quot; Barbara Fass Leavy describes Jane Reynolds as a &quot;cautionary example&quot; of what happens &quot;when women abandon their responsibilities in order to pursue their own pleasures.&quot; The theme of materialism is prevalent throughout the different versions, as the wife usually remains concerned whether her lover will be able to maintain her. Likewise, he uses promises of prosperity as a way to seduce her. Leavy also suggests a different reading of the ballad, in which it is her marriage with a carpenter, rather than her decision to flee with the former lover, that can be considered an act of infidelity. Atkinson describes the original broadside as &quot;the preservation of outmoded ways of thinking within the canon of popular literature.&quot; In accordance with the ecclesiastical law of early seventeenth-century England, a mutual promise of marriage was enough to make the couple husband and wife and was considered binding in the eyes of God. As a result, breaking such a promise would make any subsequent marriage invalid and invite divine punishment. The ballad therefore employs &quot;popular theology to reinforce [its] emphasis on fidelity in marriage.&quot; The broadside may be read as encouraging faithfulness to the person with whom the original pre-marriage vows were exchanged and warning against divine punishment for breaking the oath.

The changes resulting from the recasting of &quot;A Warning for Married Women&quot; as &quot;The Distressed Ship Carpenter&quot; can be seen as the reflection of &quot;a genuine, if quite gradual, change in social and judicial attitudes in early modern England.&quot; The revenant becomes a former lover and crime and punishment take the place of sin and retribution. The theme of sin becomes notable once again in the Scottish &quot;Demon Lover&quot; tradition (notably Child D-G), which establishes that the former lover is the devil who &quot;came to carry off the unfaithful girl to the hills of hell.&quot; The imagery of the &quot;hills of heaven and hell&quot; is present in some of the variants collected in America. Alan Lomax describes the ballad as a reinforcement of the Calvinist sexual morality.

The ballad also touches on the issues of class relations. According to Dave Harker, &quot;A Warning for Married Women&quot; questions the responsibilities of young women &quot;of worthy birth and fame&quot;. In her reading of the ballad, Leavy mentions the binary opposition between the husband and the lover and two modes of existence they represent; the mundane life and domestic ties of the artisan and the life of adventure and freedom of the seaman.

Many supernatural ballads mention fictional or remote places as locations. In multiple variants of the ballad, James Harris promises to take his lover to &quot;the banks of Italie&quot;, which is a real, but sufficiently far-off place to serve as the final destination for an unfaithful wife and her supernatural lover. In other versions, the banks of Italy turn into, for example, the banks of Tennessee (in this version the destination becomes a familiar place to return to), various generalizations (&quot;deep blue sea&quot;, &quot;salt water sea&quot;) or abstractions (&quot;isle of sweet liberty&quot;, &quot;banks of sweet relief&quot;).

==Traditional recordings==

The ballad was collected and recorded many times in the Appalachian Mountains; Clarence Ashley recorded a version with a banjo accompaniment in 1930, Texas Gladden had two versions recorded in 1932 and 1946, whilst Sarah Ogan Gunning sang a version in 1974. Jean Ritchie sang her family&#x27;s version of the ballad twice, one of those times recorded by Alan Lomax, now available online courtesy of the Alan Lomax archive. The song was also popular elsewhere in the United States; Ozark singer Almeda Riddle sang another traditional version in 1964, and folklorist Max Hunter recorded several Ozark versions which are available on the online Max Hunter Folk Collection.

Canadian folklorists Edith Fowke, Kenneth Peacock and Helen Creighton each recorded a different &quot;House Carpenter&quot; variant in Canada in the 1950s and 60s.

The song appears to have been largely forgotten in Britain and Ireland, but a fragmentary version, sung by Andrew Stewart of Blairgowrie, Perthshire, Scotland, and learned from his mother, was recorded by Hamish Henderson in 1955, and can be heard on the Tobar an Dualchais website. A variant performed by Frank Browne in Bellanagare, Co. Roscommon, Ireland, was also recorded in 1975 by Hugh Shields.

==In literature==

Elizabeth Bowen&#x27;s 1945 short story &quot;The Demon Lover&quot; uses the ballad&#x27;s central conceit for a narrative of ghostly return in wartime London.

Shirley Jackson&#x27;s collection &quot;The Lottery and Other Stories&quot; includes &quot;The Daemon Lover&quot;, a story about a woman searching for her mysterious fiancé named James Harris.

In Grady Hendrix’s 2020 novel &quot;The Southern Book Club&#x27;s Guide to Slaying Vampires&quot;, the main antagonist is a vampire named James Harris as a way to pay ode to the ballad.

==In classical music==
Hamish MacCunn&#x27;s 1887 concert overture &quot;The Ship o&#x27; the Fiend&quot; is based on the ballad.

<doc id="865978" wikidata="Q6665260" url="?curid=865978" title="Lock Up Your Daughters (musical)">
<text>Lock Up Your Daughters is a musical based on the 1730 comedy &quot;Rape upon Rape&quot;, by Henry Fielding, and adapted by Bernard Miles. The lyrics were written by Lionel Bart and the music by Laurie Johnson. It was first produced on the London stage in 1959.

In 1969, it was made into a film starring Christopher Plummer, Susannah York, and Glynis Johns, but the songs were deleted.

==Productions==
&quot;Lock Up Your Daughters&quot; opened in London at the Mermaid Theatre on 28 May 1959, where it ran for 328 performances. This was the first production at the theatre. Directed by Peter Coe with choreography by Gilbert Vernon, and stage design by Sean Kenny, it featured Stephanie Voss (Hilaret Politic), Hy Hazell (Mrs. Squeezum), Terence Cooper (Capt. Constant), Frederick Jaeger (Ramble), John Sharp (Politic), Brendan Barry (Dabble), Richard Wordsworth (Squeezum), and Keith Marsh (Sotmore). A revival opened at the Mermaid Theatre on 17 May 1962 and ran for 664 performances. The director was Richard Wordsworth, with choreography by Denys Palmer.

Another revival ran in the West End at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre in 1963 with Hy Hazell as (Mrs. Squeezum) and Sally Smith as Hilaret.

A Broadway version of the show was planned but closed on the road in 1960. It was directed by Alfred Drake, and featured Nancy Dussault as Hilaret, John Michael King and George S. Irving, and Hy Hazell repeating her role as Mrs. Squeezum.

An Australian production opened at the Princess Theatre, Melbourne in April 1961, and toured to Sydney, Adelaide and Perth.

The Goodspeed Opera House (Connecticut) has performed the show twice, in 1969 and 1982. The 1982 production was directed by Bill Gile (Darwin Knight was credited) and featured Carleton Carpenter (Mr. Squeezum), Dena Olstad (Hilaret), Keith Rice, (Constant), and Jeff McCarthy (Ramble).(Mr. Carpenter published a comic murder mystery about the production called &quot;The Peabody Experience&quot;).

==Plot summary==
&quot;Note: there is one set, which serves as a street scene, Justice Squeezum&#x27;s courtroom, Mrs Squeezum&#x27;s boudoir, a tavern bar-room, Politic&#x27;s parlour, Hilaret&#x27;s bedroom, a prison cell, an upstairs room at the tavern, and Justice Worthy&#x27;s courtroom.&quot;

In London, 1735, naive young Hilaret leaves the over-protective walls of her father&#x27;s house resolved to elope with her beloved Captain Constant. She charges Ramble with rape, and her maid Cloris charges Constant with rape. The cases are tried by the corrupt justice, Mr. Squeezum.

==Film==

The film based on the musical and play was directed by the musical&#x27;s director, Peter Coe. It was released in the UK in March 1969 and in the US in October 1969. Filmed in Kilkenny, Ireland by Domino Films it ran for 102 minutes. The film originally was given an &quot;X&quot; certificate (over 18&#x27;s) by the UK Censor, but it was given a &quot;15&quot; on video.

In his review, Roger Greenspun wrote: &quot;...a three-strand plot that has been so smothered in atmosphere, activity and authenticity that even the great traditions of theatrical untruth cannot breathe life into it. The production values of &quot;Lock Up Your Daughters!&quot; are ambitious enough to fill three movies, but they are not sufficient to substitute for one.&quot;

<text>ESPN25 was a special event conducted to mark the 25th anniversary of ESPN.

During the run-up to the anniversary date of September 7, 2004, the network counted down the top sports moments of the last 25 years (the &quot;ESPN era&quot;). Each Tuesday, a new 25-to-1 list was unveiled, as was the next headline in that 25-to-1 countdown. In addition, each day during &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, the next moment in the list of the top 100 moments of the ESPN era was shown. The celebration concluded by declaring the Miracle on Ice hockey game between the United States and the Soviet Union at the 1980 Winter Olympic Games the #1 moment, game, and headline of the last 25 years.

==The Headlines==
ESPN also had a weekly series, &quot;The Headlines&quot;, hosted by Bob Ley, counting down the top 25 stories since 1979, &quot;stories that at some point jumped off the sports page, and onto the front page.&quot;

==Old School Week==
Several former ESPN anchors were invited back to co-anchor the nighttime Sportscenter broadcast with ESPN anchors of the time, during an &quot;old school week&quot;.

* Craig Kilborn, alongside Dan Patrick, broadcast Sunday, September 8, 2004; 
* Charley Steiner, alongside Bob Ley, broadcast Monday, September 9, 2004;
* Gayle Gardner, alongside Stuart Scott, broadcast Tuesday, September 10, 2004;
* Greg Gumbel, alongside Chris Berman, broadcast Wednesday, September 11, 2004;
* George Grande, alongside Chris Berman, broadcast Thursday, September 12, 2004.

==Who&#x27;s #1?==
Immediately following &quot;The Headlines&quot; (before &quot;The Headlines&quot; in the early portion of the summer), Stuart Scott hosted &quot;Who&#x27;s #1?&quot;, which counts down the top 25 of the last 25 years in some category. &quot;Who&#x27;s #1&quot; has since expanded into a weekly series on ESPN Classic, with additional categories and a new host, Trey Wingo. In the weekly series, only 20 items are revealed, and, in a post-show segment, the &quot;Second Guessers&quot; debate the choices.

==Missing footage==
Conspicuously absent from the entire ESPN25 series was all but a few seconds of footage from National Football League games. During the &quot;Headlines&quot; show about 9/11, ESPN aired the entrance of Dallas Cowboys defensive back George Teague entering Texas Stadium with the American flag when the NFL resumed play after the attacks; otherwise, it had to air still photographs whenever the league was mentioned. Neither the league nor ESPN explained why the footage was absent, but the network had just shown &quot;Playmakers&quot;, a weekly drama show about a fictitious professional football team called the Cougars. The show&#x27;s blunt treatment of off-the-field problems drew criticism from NFL officials, and reports surfaced that the NFL threatened not to renew ESPN&#x27;s television contract with the league if &quot;Playmakers&quot; was renewed for a second season. The show was not renewed.</text><links>

<doc id="865983" wikidata="Q505758" url="?curid=865983" title="Karl von Piloty">
<text>Karl Theodor von Piloty (1 October 1826 – 21 July 1886) was a German painter, noted for his historical subjects, and recognised as the foremost representative of the realistic school in Germany.

==Life and work==
Piloty was born in Munich. His father, Ferdinand Piloty (d. 1844), enjoyed a great reputation as a lithographer. In 1840, Karl was admitted as a student of the Munich Academy, under the artists Karl Schorn and Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld. A year later the acclaimed history paintings (referred to as the &#x27;Belgian paintings&#x27;), i.e. the &quot;Compromise of the nobles&quot; and &quot;The Abdication of Charles V&quot; by the two Belgian artists Edouard de Bièfve and Louis Gallait, were shown in Munich and their realistic depiction of a historic subject matter made a lasting impression on him. After a journey to Belgium, France and England, Piloty commenced work as a painter of genre pictures, and, in 1853, produced a work, &quot;Die Amme&quot; (&quot;The Wet Nurse&quot;), which, on account of its originality of style, caused a considerable sensation in Germany at the time.

But he soon forsook this branch of painting in favour of historical subjects, and produced in 1854 for King Maximilian II &quot;The Accession of Maximilian I to the Catholic League in 1609&quot;. It was succeeded by &quot;Seni at the Dead Body of Wallenstein&quot; (1855), which gained for the young painter the membership of the Munich Academy, where he succeeded Schorn (his brother-in-law) as professor in 1856.

Among other well-known works by Piloty are the &quot;Battle of the White Mountain near Prague&quot;, &quot;Nero Dancing upon the Ruins of Rome&quot; (1861), &quot;Godfrey of Bouillon on a Pilgrimage to the Holy Land&quot; (1861), &quot;Galileo in Prison&quot; (1864) and &quot;The Death of Alexander the Great&quot; (unfinished), his last great work. He also executed a number of mural paintings for the royal palace in Munich.

For Baron von Schach, Piloty painted the famous &quot;Discovery of America&quot;. In 1874, he was appointed keeper of the Munich Academy, being afterwards ennobled by the king of Bavaria. Piloty was the foremost representative of the realistic school in Germany. He was a successful teacher, and among his more famous pupils were Hans Makart, Franz von Lenbach, Franz Defregger, Gabriel von Max, Georgios Jakobides, Eduard von Grützner, and Gyula Benczúr.

<text>The Rev. George Bramwell Evens (15 February 1884–20 November 1943) was, under the pseudonym Romany (and sometimes The Tramp), a British radio broadcaster and writer on countryside and natural history matters – quite possibly the first to broadcast on such issues. He was also a Minister of the Methodist Church.

==Biography==

Evens&#x27; mother was Romani, born in a &quot;vardo&quot; (Romany wagon). His father was Salvation Army Lieutenant George Evens, a native of Plymouth. He was born at 3 Argyll Street, Anlaby Road, Hull, England and educated at Epworth College, Rhyl, as boarder, then at Queens College, Taunton. He married Eunice, the daughter of The Reverend Owen Thomas on 1 August 1911.

He is most famous for his &quot;Out with the Romany&quot; radio programmes (later &quot;Out with Romany&quot;), which commenced in 1933 on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;, describing travels in his own &quot;vardo&quot; (purchased in 1921, at Brough Hill Fair, for £75), with Comma the horse, his English Cocker Spaniel Raq, and his young friends Muriel and Doris. Although the programmes were all pre-scripted and performed entirely in the studio, the impression given was of Romany and his friends going for a walk in the countryside and spontaneously discussing the plants and animals they came across. Raphael Samuel saw the programme as instrumental in making the countryside desirable for a generation of listeners. Simon Barnes has paid tribute to how his father (radio) and himself (books) were drawn to natural history by Romany: &quot;I longed to walk through the country with the all-knowing, all-seeing Romany&quot;.

As a Methodist minister, Evens&#x27; ministries included Goole; the Methodist Central Hall, Carlisle (1914–1926); Huddersfield (1926–1929); and the King Cross Methodist Chapel, Halifax (1929–1939), after which ill health forced him to give up the ministry. He retired to Wilmslow, where he died, leaving his wife, son Glyn and daughter, Romany June.

His ashes were scattered, at his request, at Old Parks Farm, Glassonby, Cumbria, which he had enjoyed visiting over a 22-year period: in 2001, a memorial to him was erected there by The Romany Society. 

The vardo was donated, unconditionally, by his widow, to the forerunners of Cheshire East Borough Council (CEBC). For many years it was displayed by CEBC, outdoors, in Wilmslow. In late 2012, having deteriorated badly, it was restored and moved to Bradford Industrial Museum, to be displayed indoors.

The &quot;Romany Society&quot;, originally formed in 1943, disbanded in 1965, and re-founded in 1996, celebrates his life and work, with regular newsletters and an annual magazine. Its patron is Terry Waite.

The BBC radio programmes were all broadcast live, and only one recording survives – dated October 1943, just a month before his death. It was released on CD in 2006.

==Bibliography==
The books were analysed, from a collector&#x27;s point of view, in the January 2002 edition of &quot;Book and Magazine Collector&quot; magazine.

<text>John Anton Fier III (June 20, 1956 – September 14, 2022) was an American drummer, producer, composer, and bandleader. He led The Golden Palominos, an experimental rock group active from 1981 to 2010.

==Family==
Fier, known as Tony, was born in Cleveland, Ohio, to Ruthe Marie Fier and Anton J. Fier Jr., a former Marine and electrician. His parents separated when he was young and he lived with his stepfather, a polka musician.

==Career==
In the mid-late-1970s Fier worked in a record store, began drumming, and contributed to recordings by The Styrenes and Pere Ubu, which he joined in 1977 and left in 1978 when he moved to New York City. The 1978 Pere Ubu EP titled &quot;Datapanik in the Year Zero&quot; was dedicated to Fier, who doesn&#x27;t play on it.

In New York City, he got a job at SoHo Music Gallery where he had the chance to talk with musicians. Answering an ad in the &quot;Village Voice&quot;, he became a member of The Feelies in 1978, playing drums on their critically acclaimed debut album &quot;Crazy Rhythms&quot;.

From June 1981 through February 1982 Fier re-joined Pere Ubu, replacing original drummer Scott Krauss. He played drums, piano, marimba and other percussion on their fifth album, &quot;Song of the Bailing Man&quot;.

Around that time, he was in The Lodge (with John Greaves) and played in the first line-up of The Lounge Lizards, appearing on their 1981 debut album. Later that year, Fier founded The Golden Palominos, which initially featured Arto Lindsay, John Zorn, Bill Laswell and Fred Frith but later became a loose collective of musicians Fier was working with at the moment.

In the mid 1980s, he was briefly a member of Richard Hell and the Voidoids. He was also a member of Swans, appearing on their 1991 album, &quot;White Light from the Mouth of Infinity&quot;.

Fier collaborated extensively with Bill Laswell, Arto Lindsay, and Rhys Chatham. He also toured and recorded with Bob Mould, Hüsker Dü guitarist, vocalist and songwriter. and played with bassist Jack Bruce and Japanese guitarist Kenji Suzuki on the 1987 album &quot;Inazuma Super Session – &quot;Absolute Live!!&quot;&quot;

Fier played on the John Zorn-led album &quot;Locus Solus&quot; in 1983. 20 years later, Fier, Zorn and Lindsay recorded a live album for Zorn&#x27;s 50th birthday celebration: &quot;50th Birthday Celebration Volume 3&quot; of the &quot;50th birthday series&quot; on Tzadik Records. In 1984, he played on Laurie Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Mister Heartbreak&quot;.

Fier also contributed to records from the Electric Eels, Yoko Ono, Mick Jagger, Material, Herbie Hancock, Gil Scott-Heron, Peter Blegvad, Matthew Sweet, Stina Nordenstam, Lloyd Cole, Los Lobos, David Cunningham, Joe Henry, Afrika Bambaataa, and Jeff Buckley.

Fier also produced several albums, such as the 1988 album of Drivin&#x27; n Cryin&#x27; &quot;Whisper Tames the Lion&quot;, a 2009 album by guitar virtuoso Jim Campilongo titled &quot;Orange&quot;, and Lianne Smith&#x27;s &quot;Two Sides of a River&quot;, on which Fier also played drums.

==Death==
Syd Straw, a member of the Golden Palominos, posted on Facebook on October 11, 2019, that Fier was no longer playing drums.

Fier died on September 14, 2022, at the age of 66, at the Pegasos Clinic, in Basel, Switzerland, of VAD (Voluntary Assisted Dying) or assisted suicide. According to Exit International director Philip Nitschke, Fier was not suffering from terminal illness, but &quot;wanted to die on his own terms after feeling he had accomplished everything he could in life.&quot; Golden Palominos guitarist Nicky Skopelitis was Fier&#x27;s friend and the executor of his estate. Fier&#x27;s cremated remains were delivered to Skopelitis along with a cremation notice, indicating the date of death as September 14, 2022. As noted in &quot;The Independent&quot;, Fier reportedly had left a final letter, in which he wrote &quot;My father died at 42, and my mother at 52. I never expected or prepared myself to live this long and had no example of how to properly do so.&quot; {[The Independent, October 13, 2022}]. Fier&#x27;s friends reported the musician had money troubles and injuries which hampered his drumming, and had discussed the possibility of ending his life for several years.

In November 2022, the Feelies performed a tribute concert for Fier who had recently passed.

<doc id="865994" wikidata="Q703458" url="?curid=865994" title="Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld">
<text>Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (26 March 1794 – 24 May 1872) () was a German painter, chiefly of Biblical subjects. As a young man he associated with the painters of the Nazarene movement who revived the florid Renaissance style in religious art. He is remembered for his extensive &quot;Picture Bible&quot;, and his designs for stained glass windows in cathedrals.

==Biography==
Schnorr was born in Leipzig, the son of Veit Hanns Schnorr von Carolsfeld 
(1764–1841), a draughtsman, engraver, and painter, from whom he received his initial artistic education, his earliest known works being copies of the Neoclassical drawings of John Flaxman. In 1811 he entered the Vienna Academy, from which Johann Friedrich Overbeck and others who rebelled against the old conventional style had been expelled about a year before. There he studied under Friedrich Heinrich Füger, and became friends with Joseph Anton Koch and Heinrich Olivier, both of whom would have an important influence on his style.
Schnorr followed Overbeck and the other founders of the Nazarene movement to Rome in 1815. This school of religious and romantic art tended to reject modern styles, attempting to revert to and revive the principles and practice of earlier periods.

At the beginning of his time in Rome, Schnorr was particularly influenced by his close study of fifteenth-century Italian painting, especially the works of Fra Angelico. Soon however, he abandoned this refined simplicity, and began to look towards more elaborate High Renaissance models.

From its outset the Nazarene movement made an effort to recover fresco painting and monumental art, and Schnorr had an opportunity to demonstrate his powers when commissioned to decorate the entrance hall of the Villa Massimo near the Lateran with frescoes illustrating the works of Ariosto. Other cycles in the house were begun by Peter von Cornelius and Johann Friedrich Overbeck.

Schnorr married Maria Heller, the stepdaughter of Ferdinand Olivier, in 1827.
Their son Ludwig Schnorr von Carolsfeld was an operatic tenor who died at the age of 29. He had just begun to gain renown as the first to sing Wagner&#x27;s Tristan. Schnorr&#x27;s brother, (1788–1853) was also a painter. Schnorr died in Dresden in 1872.

==Career==
The second period of Schnorr&#x27;s artistic output began in 1825, when he left Rome, settled in Munich, entered the service of Ludwig I of Bavaria, and transplanted to Germany the art of wall-painting which he had learned in Italy. He showed himself qualified as a sort of poet-painter to the Bavarian court; he organized a staff of trained executants, and covered five halls in the new palace – the &quot;Residenz&quot; – with frescoes illustrating the . He also painted a series of scenes from the lives of Charlemagne, Frederick Barbarossa and Rudolph of Habsburg. 

Schnorr had initially wanted to create a complex symbolic programme in which these German historical subjects were combined with scenes from the Old Testament. This however was rejected by Ludwig, leaving Schnorr to complain that he was left with the task of painting a mere &quot;newspaper report of the Middle Ages&quot; (&quot;Zeitungsartikel des Mittelalters&quot;). Critics considered these compositions to be creative, learned in composition, masterly in drawing, but also exaggerated in thought and extravagant in style.

In 1846 Schnorr moved to Dresden to become a professor at the academy there. The next year he was appointed director of the Gemäldegalerie.

==Art==
Schnorr&#x27;s third period was marked by his biblical illustrations. He was a Lutheran, and took a broad and unsectarian view. His &quot;Picture Bible&quot; was published in Leipzig in 30 parts in 1852–60, and an English edition followed in 1861. The &quot;Picture Bible&quot; illustrations were often complex and cluttered; some critics found them lacking in harmony of line and symmetry, judging them to be inferior to equivalent work produced by Raphael. His style differs from the simplicity and severity of earlier times, exhibiting instead the floridity of the later Renaissance.

Schnorr&#x27;s biblical drawings and cartoons for frescoes formed a natural prelude to designs for church windows, and his renown in Germany secured commissions in Great Britain. Schnorr was one of ten artists who provided designs for a scheme of stained-glass for Glasgow Cathedral, commissioned in 1856–7 and manufactured at the royal factory in Munich, and he later designed windows for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in London. This Munich glass provoked controversy: medievalists objected to its lack of lustre, and stigmatized the windows as mere coloured blinds and picture transparencies. The opposing party, however, claimed for these modern revivals &quot;the union of the severe and excellent drawing of early Florentine oil-paintings with the colouring and arrangement of the glass-paintings of the latter half of the 16th century.&quot; Four windows by Schnorr were installed at St Paul&#x27;s: three in the chancel (removed in 1888) and one at the west end (destroyed in 1941). Most of the Munich glass at Glasgow was removed during the 20th century.

==Paintings==
==Nazi-looted art==
In August 2016, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., returned a drawing in its collection, &quot;A Branch with Shriveled Leaves&quot; (1817) by Schnorr, to the heirs of Dr. Marianne Schmidl (1890–1942), an Austrian ethnologist who was murdered in the Holocaust.

<doc id="866013" wikidata="Q879287" url="?curid=866013" title="William Donald Schaefer">
<text>William Donald Schaefer (November 2, 1921 – April 18, 2011) was an American politician who served in public office for 50 years at both the state and local level in Maryland. As a Democrat, he was the 45th mayor of Baltimore from December 1971 to January 1987, the 58th Governor of Maryland from January 21, 1987, to January 18, 1995, and the 32nd Comptroller of Maryland from January 20, 1999, to January 17, 2007. On September 12, 2006, he was defeated in his reelection bid for a third term as Comptroller by Maryland Delegate Peter Franchot in the Democratic Party primary.

==Early life and career==
Schaefer was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the only child of Tululu Irene (née Skipper) and William Henry Schaefer, on November 2, 1921. His parents were Baptist, and he was of part German ancestry. He spent his childhood at 620 Edgewood Street in the old West Baltimore community off Edmondson Avenue, near Hilton Street and Parkway by Gwynns Falls-Leakin Park. He received early education in Baltimore&#x27;s city public schools, and later graduated from The Baltimore City College (a public high school) in its centennial class of 1939. Schaefer received an LL.B. from the University of Baltimore School of Law in 1942 and an LL.M. in 1954.

Schaefer was a member of the Order of DeMolay in Baltimore as a youth, later inducted into the DeMolay International Hall of Fame. He was also a Freemason and a member of the &quot;Grand Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons of the State of Maryland&quot;. He was a member of &quot;Mystic Circle Lodge No. 104&quot; when he first ran for public office. During his childhood and much of his adulthood, Schaefer was a member of Cummins Memorial Church in the Reformed Episcopal Church, serving as a vestryman and treasurer.

When the United States entered World War II on Monday, December 8, 1941, Schaefer joined the United States Army and later achieved officer rank, taking charge of administering hospitals in England and the rest of western Europe. He continued to remain in the U.S. Army Reserves during his academic, legal and political/public service careers until 1979, when he retired with the rank of colonel.

Schaefer resumed his legal career afterwards, practicing real estate law. He had earned his Master of Law degree in 1954 from the University of Baltimore School of Law and formed a general practice law firm with two colleagues. Except for his military service, he lived unmarried with his mother in two different very plain West Baltimore two-story, six-room &quot;daylight-style&quot; rowhouses on Edgewood Street (off Edmondson Avenue) all his life, until moving to the Government House (Maryland Governor&#x27;s Mansion) at age 65 in 1987.

Impelled, according to his biographer, by a situation in which Cummins Memorial Church lost a city property auction in which it was the highest bidder due to alleged corruption, Schaefer ran for a seat in the Maryland House of Delegates (lower chamber of the General Assembly of Maryland) in 1950 and again in 1954, losing both elections. He was successful in his third campaign for a seat on the Baltimore City Council in 1955, when his concern for city planning and housing issues propelled him to a seat representing the 5th Councilmanic District. In 1967, Schaefer ran successfully for Baltimore City Council president and, four years later in 1971, he ran successfully for the mayor&#x27;s office, when incumbent mayor Thomas L. J. D&#x27;Alesandro III, brother of Nancy Pelosi, retired after one term.

==Mayor of Baltimore (1971–1987)==

Schaefer served four terms as mayor, being first elected in 1971, then re-elected in 1975, 1979 and 1983, each time receiving 85% or more of the vote. He was known for his attention to detail: taking notes of strewn garbage and citing other violations as he rode around for appointments/events in a plain town car with a police officer driver, and ordering them fixed immediately. A famous photograph shows him dressed in a Victorian style red and orange-striped bathing suit, with a straw boater hat, carrying an inflatable rubber duck into the outside seal pool at the then under construction National Aquarium in Baltimore at the Inner Harbor, attracting wide national media attention, to settle a wager that it would not be opened in time in August 1981. In 1984, in a move to give the majority African-American population more power in the city of Baltimore, Schaefer named Bishop L. Robinson as the Baltimore City Police Department&#x27;s first African-American police commissioner, a position previously dominated by Irish American and Italian American members of the city police department. Baltimore&#x27;s 1967 police headquarters were renamed for Robinson in 2007.

Throughout his tenure as mayor, Schaefer realized that the closings of large manufacturing plants like Bethlehem Steel at Sparrows Point (since 1887 in southeastern suburban, but blue-collar Baltimore County, near Dundalk), the largest waterfront steel mill in the world; and the 70-year-old General Motors auto/truck assembly plant on Broening Highway in the southeast city would negatively impact the quality of life in the city of Baltimore and add to the city&#x27;s unemployment rate. His administration turned to tourism as a possible alternative. He pushed for and saw built a new Baltimore Convention Center along West Pratt Street between South Charles, Sharp and Howard Streets in downtown Baltimore in 1979, enlarged again in the 1990s to keep up with expanding and larger competition for the burgeoning nationwide convention business; as well as the opening of Baltimore&#x27;s famed &quot;Harborplace&quot;, festival marketplace pavilions by shopping center developer and urban visionary James Rouse along the north and west shores of the old &quot;Basin&quot; (Inner Harbor) at East Pratt Street along South Calvert Street, replacing the former small grassy central &quot;Pratt and Light&quot; triangular Samuel Smith Park with its bronze statue of the old brave &quot;Defender of Baltimore&quot; (from the British attack at the Battle of Baltimore crafted at the 1914 Star Spangled Banner Centennial from the War of 1812) and its surrounding &quot;temporary&quot; Light Street parking lots from the last waterfront &quot;urban renewal&quot; project of the Mayor Thomas J. D&#x27;Alesandro, Jr. (1903–1987, served 1947–1959) administration from the late 1940s. Dubbed &quot;America&#x27;s Best Mayor&quot; at the time by several national magazine stories, Mayor Schaefer was hailed for transforming a deteriorating city into a hub of national tourism, although the groundwork and the original vision for the Inner Harbor project in the early 1960s to succeed the previous Charles Center downtown renewal of 1958–1970 had first been foreseen and crafted two mayoral administrations earlier under progressive/liberal Republican mayor and former governor of Maryland Theodore R. McKeldin (1900–1974, served 1943–1947 and 1963–1967), who was eventually recognized by having the redeveloped plaza facing the new &quot;festival marketplaces&quot; at Pratt, Light and Calvert Streets renamed for him. With new businesses, new hotels, a new National Aquarium and the new convention center, Baltimore had been revived. Harborplace had 18 million visitors its first year, 1980–81. In 1984, &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine named Schaefer &quot;the best mayor in America&quot;. A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Schaefer as the twentieth-best American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

===Colts leave===
Schaefer constantly battled Robert Irsay, the owner of the Baltimore Colts of the National Football League. Irsay and Orioles owner Jerrold Hoffberger complained that Memorial Stadium, which the Colts and the American League&#x27;s Baltimore Orioles shared, was antiquated due to a lack of quality seats and inadequate parking. Schaefer extracted a promise from Irsay that the Colts owner would call Schaefer first before moving the team. However, after one of the houses of the Maryland State Legislature passed legislation giving the city of Baltimore the right to seize ownership of the team by eminent domain  – an idea first floated in a memo written by Baltimore mayoral aide Mark Wasserman – Robert Irsay called Indianapolis Mayor William Hudnut that afternoon and began serious negotiations in order to move the team before the Maryland legislature&#x27;s other chamber could pass similar legislation. In the early morning hours of March 29, 1984, Mayflower moving vans began relocating the Colts from the team&#x27;s Owings Mills training facility to Indianapolis. Schaefer lamented that &quot;[Irsay] didn&#x27;t call his old friend, Don&quot; before the move.

===Ravens arrive===
The Colts were not the first professional sports team to leave Baltimore on Schaefer&#x27;s watch. In 1973, the Baltimore Bullets moved to Landover, Maryland and were renamed the Capital Bullets, and later, the Washington Bullets.
In his last years as mayor, and later during his two terms as governor, Schaefer led the push to build Oriole Park at Camden Yards for the Orioles and M&amp;T Bank Stadium for a new NFL team, which came to fruition in 1996 when Art Modell moved the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore, giving credit to Schaefer for the transaction:

==Governor of Maryland (1987–1995)==
Schaefer, with running mate Melvin Steinberg, was overwhelmingly elected the 58th governor of Maryland in 1986, defeating Republican challenger Thomas J. Mooney with 82% of the vote, the largest percentage total ever for a contested statewide election in Maryland. He was re-elected in 1990 with almost 60% of the vote. Immediately upon taking office, Schaefer sought to take on the state&#x27;s unemployment problem. After learning of a proposed closing of a major corporation in western Maryland, he personally went to Allegany County with his top advisors and the Maryland Congressional delegation and devised a plan of state and federal action to meet the needs of the faltering company. The corporation kept its headquarters in Allegany County, saving 600 jobs.
Schaefer&#x27;s legacy includes the construction of Oriole Park at Camden Yards, stricter measures taken toward preventing and solving the Chesapeake Bay pollution problem, and higher standards for public schools.

Schaefer reappointed Philip Kapneck as Maryland Trade Ambassador, originally appointed by Governor Mandel. Kapneck worked closely with the pro-business governor, bringing overseas companies to Maryland, creating many new jobs and generating revenue for the state.

Schaefer as governor also pushed for the light rail line of electric trains that run 30 miles from Hunt Valley in Baltimore County, through Baltimore, past Oriole Park at Camden Yards, to Cromwell Station/Glen Burnie in Anne Arundel County, near BWI Airport.

Detractors remind the public that, in the winter of 1991, Gov. Schaefer compared Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore to an outhouse (he referred to the region as a &quot;shithouse&quot;). When the remark circulated, Eastern Shore residents erupted in protest.

In the 1992 presidential election, Governor Schaefer endorsed Republican President George H. W. Bush over Democratic challenger Bill Clinton. &quot;He was a great man. I liked him; he was a friend. I went up to Camp David with him.&quot;. He also endorsed Republican Congresswoman Helen Delich Bentley in her bid to succeed him as governor in 1994.

Schaefer stepped down from his position as governor on January 18, 1995, after serving the maximum two four-year terms.

==Post-gubernatorial activities==
Following his career as governor, Schaefer became Of Counsel to the law firm of Gordon, Feinblatt, Rothman, Hoffberger &amp; Hollander, LLC, in Baltimore until 1999. The William Donald Schaefer Chair was established at University of Maryland, College Park&#x27;s School of Public Affairs in 1995. Schaefer held the position until 1999, at which time the program was expanded to include funded internships.

Schaefer had a long-time companion in Hilda Mae Snoops, who was his &quot;official hostess&quot; in the Governor&#x27;s mansion. She commissioned a controversial Victorian-style outdoor fountain and helped design a rose garden and walkways. The fountain is included in her First Lady-style portrait. After Snoops&#x27; death in 1999, the fountain became a source of controversy as Schaefer accused his successor, Parris Glendening, of using it to get political revenge by turning it off, supposedly to save water even though it recycles existing water. Upon becoming governor, Robert Ehrlich held a ceremony to turn the water flow back on in the fountain. Snoops is interred in the mausoleum at Dulaney Valley Memorial Gardens, with an adjacent place reserved for Schaefer.

==Comptroller of Maryland (1999–2007)==
In 1998, three years after leaving the governorship, with the sudden death of longtime (forty years in office) Comptroller and Maryland political legend Louis L. Goldstein of Calvert County in southern Maryland, Schaefer ran in the special election for the position of Comptroller of Maryland against Republican Mark Epstein. He won by a substantial margin, 62% to 38%. Schaefer came into the office on January 25, 1999. In 2002, he had remained extremely popular in Maryland and received almost 68% of the vote in the general election.

Schaefer feuded frequently with Governor Parris Glendening at the bi-monthly Board of Public Works (BPW) meetings. Schaefer once called Glendening a &quot;despot&quot; and often chided him. Schaefer frequently referred to Glendening as &quot;Ayatollah.&quot; Glendening endorsed and paid for advertisements on behalf of Schaefer&#x27;s 2002 Democratic primary opponent, Secretary of State John T. Willis, but Schaefer defeated him easily. Glendening&#x27;s degree of unpopularity was such that it was reported his support for Willis might cost Willis votes. Schaefer enjoyed considerably warmer relations with Governor Robert Ehrlich, the Republican who succeeded Glendening on January 15, 2003.

===Controversies===
As Comptroller, Schaefer regularly spoke critically of immigrants who cannot communicate in English. He was particularly well known for his May 2004 comment about a non-English-speaking McDonald&#x27;s cashier.

Schaefer also stirred up controversy on October 12, 2004, when he called people with AIDS &quot;a danger&quot;. He said that those with the disease &quot;brought it on themselves.&quot; From the 1990s, he had repeatedly called for a public registry listing HIV-positive Maryland residents. &quot;As far as I&#x27;m concerned, people who have AIDS are a danger&quot;, Schaefer said. &quot;People should be able to know who has AIDS.&quot;

On February 15, 2006, Schaefer made suggestive comments to Elizabeth Krum, a 24-year-old assistant to then-Governor Robert Ehrlich. Responding to Schaefer&#x27;s request for tea, Krum set a thermal mug in front of him. Schaefer watched her walk away, then beckoned for her to return. When she obliged, he told her, &quot;Walk again&quot;, staring after her as she left the conference room. Schaefer initially refused to apologize, saying, &quot;She&#x27;s a pretty little girl. She ought to be damn happy that I observed her going out the door. The day I don&#x27;t look at pretty women is the day I die.&quot; (Schaefer long called the women with whom he worked &quot;little girls.&quot;) However, within days of the leering incident, Schaefer issued a handwritten letter to Krum informing her she had handled the affair as a &quot;trouper.&quot;

On July 5, 2006, Schaefer launched into a rambling commentary on immigration as the public works board considered a contract to provide testing services for the English as a Second Language (ESOL) program in Maryland schools. As state education officials tried to explain the contract, Schaefer demanded to know whether the program would benefit Korean students. &quot;Korea&#x27;s another one, all of a sudden they&#x27;re our friends, too, shooting missiles at us&quot;, he said. Schaefer was apparently referring to North Korea&#x27;s test launch earlier that week of a long-range missile, which fell into the ocean. Schaefer refused to apologize for his comments after a meeting with South Korean community leaders. Later that same day, when he was questioned by a female &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reporter about the ESOL program, Schaefer&#x27;s response was to call her a &quot;sweet little girl.&quot;

===2006 re-election campaign===
Schaefer faced a competitive primary challenge for Comptroller in 2006. He was challenged by Anne Arundel County Executive Janet S. Owens and Delegate Peter Franchot (District 20). The campaign initially looked like a struggle between Schaefer and Franchot. After deciding against running for the U.S. House seat being vacated by Benjamin Cardin (so that Cardin could run for the U.S. Senate), Owens decided to jump into the race for Comptroller.

In early July 2006, when asked if he would debate Owens, he said he &quot;wouldn&#x27;t debate her on how to bake a chocolate cake.&quot; Franchot campaigned strongly as the &quot;only real Democrat in the race.&quot; On September 5, 2006, Schaefer told &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist Marc Fisher that Janet Owens is a &quot;prissy little miss&quot; who wears &quot;long dresses, looks like Mother Hubbardit&#x27;s sort of like she was a man.&quot; He made additional comments that she was &quot;getting fat.&quot; Later, in an on-air interview with reporter Tyler Evans of local news station News Channel 8, he further commented: &quot;She&#x27;s got these long clothes on and an old-fashioned hairdo. You know it sort of makes you real mad.&quot; On September 8, 2006, another local news station, WUSA9, showed an off-screen reporter asking him, &quot;Did you call her an Old Mother Hubbard?&quot; to which he responded, &quot;Well, what does she look like? ... Old-fashioned hairdo; long dress ... If I lose or win – whatever I do – I&#x27;m gonna send her some &quot;Style&quot; magazines.&quot; His campaign called a press conference, but he failed to show. Owens commented that perhaps Schaefer had become too old to run, saying that running against him was like a granddaughter &quot;taking the keys away from grandpa.&quot; In response, Schaefer and his campaign hinted that Owens was lashing out at him in an act of age discrimination. One viewer wrote in, suggesting that perhaps Schaefer was showing signs of dementia. The anchor responded that the caller had pointed out &quot;the elephant in the room&quot; that, until then, the media was hesitant to suggest. Schaefer refused to apologize for his comments regarding Owens&#x27; appearance, saying, &quot;An apology? An apology for what? I can&#x27;t help it how she looks.&quot; Asked about his heated exchanges with Owens, Schaefer said, &quot;This was started not by me.&quot; He added, &quot;There&#x27;s dirty politics, and then there&#x27;s filthy politics.&quot;

On September 12, during the Democratic primary election, Schaefer was pushed into third place behind Franchot and Owens, with Franchot winning the primary by 15,000 votes over Owens. The tight three-way race saw Franchot winning the Washington, D.C., suburbs (Montgomery County and Prince George&#x27;s County), Owens winning in Central Maryland (Howard County and Anne Arundel County), and Schaefer holding his own in the Baltimore metro area (Baltimore City and Baltimore County). This was Schaefer&#x27;s first campaign loss since 1954.

Schaefer&#x27;s last day at work as Comptroller was January 19, 2007. He was succeeded on January 22 by Franchot, who won the general election, and was not present for Franchot&#x27;s swearing in. After retiring, he moved into the Charlestown Retirement Community in Catonsville, Maryland. His health declined quickly and he made few public appearances in his final years.

==Death==
Schaefer died at the age of 89 on April 18, 2011, at his latest home in Catonsville. He had recently been hospitalized due to pneumonia at St. Agnes Hospital in southwest Baltimore and was receiving hospice care at the time of his death. During his governorship, Schaefer had switched his membership from his longtime church, Cummins Memorial, to Old St. Paul&#x27;s Episcopal Church, the oldest church in Baltimore, founded 1692. His funeral now took place at Old St. Paul&#x27;s, and Schaefer was buried at Dulaney Valley Memorial Gardens near Towson in suburban Baltimore County.

==Legacy==
In 1978, Schaefer received the U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official, an award given out annually by Jefferson Awards.

The William Donald Schaefer Center for Public Policy was established in 1985. Currently the center is located at the University of Baltimore School of Public Affairs.

In 2008, Schaefer moved the &quot;Civic Fund&quot;, which he had established and used while Mayor of Baltimore to make small grants to neighborhoods for projects such as erecting flagpoles or cultivating community gardens, to the Baltimore Community Foundation, adding to it his leftover campaign funds and proceeds from the sale of his house. After its settlement, $1.4 million from the late governor&#x27;s estate was added in 2012 to this fund. The William Donald Schaefer Civic Fund is a permanent endowment which continues to provide small grants for neighborhood projects.
Two years before his death, a statue of Schaefer was unveiled in Baltimore&#x27;s Inner Harbor as a gift by construction magnate Willard Hackerman.

In July 2022, a theatrical production titled &quot;Do It Now!&quot; about Schaefer&#x27;s time as mayor was produced at Fells Point Corner Theatre in Baltimore.

Several buildings have been dedicated in Schaefer&#x27;s honor:
*William Donald Schaefer Building, state office building at the northwest corner of St. Paul and East Baltimore Streets (former bankrupt Merritt Savings &amp; Loan Association building) in downtown Baltimore, Maryland.
*William Donald Schaefer Engineering Building at Morgan State University on Hillen Road in northwest city.
*William Donald Schaefer Hall at St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland, in St. Mary&#x27;s County where he served on the board of trustees for years
*Governor William Donald Schaefer International Terminal (Concourse E) at Baltimore-Washington International Thurgood Marshall Airport (BWI)
*William Donald Schaefer Auditorium at The Baltimore City College (a public high school), where Schaefer had graduated in the centennial class of 1939, and was responsible for the funding of $10 million for a major renovation in 1977–1979.

<text>Mount Saint Mary&#x27;s University, Los Angeles (known as Mount St. Mary&#x27;s College until January 2015) is a private, Catholic university primarily for women, in Los Angeles, California. Women make up 90 percent of the student body.

Founded in 1925 by the Sisters of St. Joseph of Carondelet, today the university has two campuses apart: Chalon in Brentwood and Doheny in North University Park, near downtown Los Angeles.

==Campuses==
=== Chalon Campus===

The university first held its classes at St. Mary&#x27;s Academy, then located at West Slauson Avenue and Crenshaw Boulevard. In 1928, the Sisters purchased of land along the foothills of the Santa Monica Mountains from the Rodeo Land and Water Company for $162,000. In 1947, an additional was acquired to complete what is today the university&#x27;s Chalon campus. The campus contains a blend of architecture familiar to Los Angeles, largely in the tradition of the Spanish Colonial Revival and Mission Revival styles. The location of the campus in Brentwood, on a 1,100-foot (340 m) ridge, provides an overlook to both the Getty Center and of the Pacific Ocean.

Being the university&#x27;s first campus, Chalon has been home to a number of important events in the history of the university. In 1929, the university&#x27;s first graduation was held on the Chalon campus. In 1952, the university granted its first baccalaureate degrees in nursing, also the first in Southern California. In 1955, the university began offering graduate degree programs.

Today, Chalon is home to the university&#x27;s traditional baccalaureate programs, offering more than 35 academic majors and minors. The most popular majors are: nursing, pre-nursing, psychology, biology, sociology, and business.

The Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media is located at the university.

===Doheny campus===

The university grew to two campuses in 1962 when it was given , holding two city blocks of Queen Anne style and Victorian mansions, in Los Angeles next to the University of Southern California. The property was formerly owned by Edward L. Doheny and his wife, the Countess Estelle Doheny, who made their fortune in oil. The Chester Place residences were built at the turn of the century by Judge Charles Silent. The university named the campus after the Countess Doheny and her husband. Because of the Countess&#x27;s desire for privacy, the Dohenys purchased all the adjacent houses and made it into a private street. The West Adams campus is located in one of the oldest neighborhoods of the city.

The Doheny campus first played host to the university&#x27;s Associate in Arts program when it opened in 1962. Forty years later, in 2002, the university began its first doctoral degree, in physical therapy, which joined the other graduate programs now offered at the Doheny campus.

In 1992, the university launched its Weekend and Evening College program at the Chalon campus, which primarily focuses on providing working professionals the opportunity to complete their undergraduate degrees within four years by attending classes scheduled on weekends. The Weekend and Evening College program moved to the Doheny campus in 2006, joining a number of courses for the associate and graduate programs offered at Doheny on weekday evenings and on weekends, furthering the idea of accessibility introduced by Weekend and Evening College.

Doheny is home to the university&#x27;s associate, daytime and evening graduate programs, Weekend and Evening College (undergraduate and graduate), and educational credential programs.

<doc id="866015" wikidata="Q3366150" url="?curid=866015" title="Manitoba Social Credit Party">
<text>The Manitoba Social Credit Party (originally the Manitoba Social Credit League) was a political party in the Canadian province of Manitoba. In its early years, it espoused the monetary reform theories of social credit.

It was formed in the 1935–1936, shortly after William Aberhart&#x27;s supporters formed a Social Credit government in Alberta. While the party never won many seats in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba, it maintained a presence in the legislature for most of the period from 1936 to 1973.

==Origins==
In its earliest years, the Social Credit League took the form of a populist protest movement. Like other Social Credit parties in Canada, it eventually became as a party of conservatism while retaining an anti-establishment message. The party&#x27;s leadership was consistently anti-socialist.

The Social Credit Party ran 19 candidates in the provincial election of 1936, five of whom were elected. It did not have a leader during the election, but chose Stanley Fox to lead the parliamentary group shortly thereafter. During this period, the party supported the monetary reforms of Major Douglas, which Aberhart had been promoting in Alberta for several years.

The 1936 election produced a minority government, with 23 Liberal-Progressives, 16 Conservatives, 7 Independent Labour Party members, the 5 Social Crediters and 4 others. After early talks for a Liberal-Progressive/Conservative coalition broke down, the Social Crediters made a surprise offer to keep the outgoing Liberal-Progressive government of John Bracken in power. Some party members may have hoped for a formal coalition, but this came to nothing and the party supported the government from the outside for the next four years.

Fox stepped down as party leader in 1937, and was replaced by S.E. Rogers.

==World War II and coalition==
After the start of World War II, Bracken promoted a &quot;non-partisan government&quot; for Manitoba, in which all four major parties would hold cabinet portfolios in a demonstration of provincial unity. The plan was approved by the other parties, and Social Credit joined the government in late 1940. Social Credit Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Norman Turnbull was sworn in as a minister without portfolio on November 4, 1940, and served in this capacity until February 14, 1946.

The decision to join government caused a split in the party. Salome Halldorson crossed the floor to sit as an Opposition Social Credit MLA and won the support of Alberta Socred Premier Ernest Manning as well as the Manitoba Social Credit League which officially expelled the four Social Credit MLAs who supported the government. Nevertheless, in the election of 1941, several Social Credit candidates ran in opposition to the coalition, while coalition supporters continued to call themselves Social Credit candidates. This division damaged the party&#x27;s credibility with the electorate, and only three Social Credit candidates were elected: Fox, Turnbull and Rogers (all government supporters).

==Decline==

The party does not seem to have had a leader in the parliament which followed, and in fact became little more than an appendage of the Liberal-Conservative coalition as the 1940s progressed. Fox and Turnbull were re-elected in the 1945 election, but the party ran only two other candidates in the rest of the province. It completely lost its coherence as a parliamentary force in the late 1940s, and did not run any candidates in the 1949 election.

The Social Credit Party re-emerged for the election of 1953: William Bullmore was elected in the constituency of Dauphin, and Gilbert Hutton won in Minnedosa. The party was again marginalized in the parliament which followed, however, and none of its candidates were elected in the provincial elections of 1958 and 1959. Although the Social Credit parties of Alberta and British Columbia had largely abandoned their monetary policies by this time, Bullmore and Hutton continued to promote social credit during their time in parliament.

During the late 1940s and the 1950s, the President of the Manitoba Social Credit League was Wilbert James Tinkler. He was the closest that the party had to an official leader in this period, as neither Bullmore nor Hutton held an official role in the legislature. Tinkler ran for federal and provincial office on six occasions.

Tinkler became the president of the Social Credit league at a time when it had only a minimal presence in the legislature, and a weak provincial organization. The party had joined the governing coalition of Premier John Bracken in 1940, and its parliamentary representation was subsequently regarded as little more than an adjunct to the province&#x27;s Liberal-Conservative government. Several figures within the party had campaigned against the alliance in 1941, but all were defeated. The party&#x27;s organization subsequently collapsed, and it offered no candidates for election in 1949.

Social Credit did not have an official political leader between 1941 and at least 1959. Tinkler, as its leading official for most of this period, was not a prominent public figure, though he did help reconstruct some semblance of a provincial network for the party. He was replaced as party president by S.S. Hunt of Dauphin in late June 1953, but appears to have regained this title later in the decade. Tinkler continued to work in the party after Jacob Froese became its official leader following the 1959 election.

==Later years==
The party received another lease on life in November 1959, when Jacob Froese won a by-election in the riding of Rhineland. Froese remained a member of the legislature until the 1973 election, when he was defeated by a Progressive Conservative candidate. The party was unable to win any other seats, however, and Froese effectively acted as an independent MLA during his time in parliament. He served as party leader for most, if not all of the period from 1959 to 1977. Froese was sometimes called the &quot;conscience of parliament&quot;, and does not appear to have endorsed his party&#x27;s original views on monetary reform.

The Manitoba Social Credit Party ran five candidates in the 1977 election, all of whom fared poorly. Even Froese was reduced to a fourth-place finish in Rhineland. In the 1981 election, the party announced that it would not run any candidates. Froese was by this time a member of Sidney Green&#x27;s Progressive Party.

The party seems to have dissolved itself shortly thereafter.

<doc id="866017" wikidata="Q5533478" url="?curid=866017" title="Genome@home">
<text>Genome@home was a volunteer computing project run by Stefan Larson of Stanford University, and a sister project to Folding@home. Its goal was protein design and its applications, which had implications in many fields including medicine. Genome@home was run by the Pande Lab.

==Function==
Following the Human Genome Project, scientists needed to know the biological and medical implications of the resulting wealth of genetic information. Genome@home used spare processing power on personal computers to virtually design genes that match existing proteins, although it can also design new proteins that have not been found in nature. This process is computationally demanding, so distributed computing is a viable option. Researchers can use the results from the project to gain a better understanding of the evolution of natural genomes and proteins, and their functionality. This project had applications in medical therapy, new pharmaceuticals, and assigning functions to newly sequenced genes.

Genome@home directly studied genomes and proteins by virtually designing new sequences for existing 3-D protein structures, which other scientists obtained through X-ray crystallography or NMR techniques. By understanding the relationship between the sequences and specific protein structures, the Pande lab tackled contemporary issues in structural biology, genetics, and medicine.

Specifically, the Genome@home project aided the understanding of why thousands of different amino acid sequences all form the same structures and assisted the fields of proteomics and structural genomics by predicting the functions of newly discovered genes and proteins. It also had implications in medical therapy by designing and virtually creating new versions of existing proteins. Genome@home&#x27;s software was designed for uniprocessor systems. It begins with a large set of potential sequences, and repeatedly searches through and refines these sequences until a well-designed sequence is found. It then sends this sequence to the server, and repeats the process.

==Conclusion==
For financial reasons, the project was officially concluded on March 8, 2004, although data was still collected until April 15. Following its completion, users were asked to donate to Folding@home instead.

==Results==
It accumulated a large database of protein sequences, which will be used for important scientific purposes for years by the Pande Lab and other scientists across the world.

Four peer-reviewed scientific publications have resulted from Genome@home.

<doc id="866020" wikidata="Q7737085" url="?curid=866020" title="The Golden Palominos">
<text>The Golden Palominos were an American musical group headed by drummer, producer, arranger, and composer Anton Fier, first formed in 1981. Aside from Fier, the Palominos membership fluctuated, with only bassist Bill Laswell and guitarist Nicky Skopelitis appearing on every album through 1996. Their final work, 2012&#x27;s &quot;A Good Country Mile&quot; features vocalist Kevn Kinney. The band&#x27;s early work developed out of the No Wave scene, but later branched out into alternative rock, country rock and electronic music.

While the Palominos&#x27; records usually featured a core set of musicians and a certain emotional continuity throughout the bulk of an album, various guest appearances resulted in stylistic changes from track to track. Fier stated that he thought of himself as a casting director, elaborating: &quot;Each record was an experiment and some lasted for two records, never longer than that. I chalk it up to my short attention span and the fact that there were lots of people I wanted to work with and ways to explore areas of music I was interested in, and certain combos wouldn&#x27;t fit with others, so one record would be this and another record would be something else.&quot;

==History==

===Initial lineup===
The group first featured Fier, singer-guitarist Arto Lindsay, saxophonist John Zorn, bass guitarist Bill Laswell and violinist/guitarist Fred Frith. Their self-titled debut album was released on New York&#x27;s Celluloid Records in 1983, and featured guest appearances by bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, guitarist Nicky Skopelitis, percussionist David Moss, turntablist M.E. Miller and others. The album has some of the first recorded turntable scratching outside of rap music, courtesy of Laswell and M.E. Miller. M.E. Miller also used vocal splitting technique to create harmony on the song he sings.

They were heavily influenced by so-called no wave music (Arto Lindsay had played in the seminal no-wave band DNA), but their music also contained elements of funk and of the improvisational jazz stylings that became Zorn&#x27;s trademark. This line-up lasted only for the first record, although all of the core members apart from Zorn were guests on subsequent Palominos recordings.

===1985–1989===
The Palominos&#x27; next album, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Visions of Excess&quot;, sounded vastly different. Of the band members that were on the first album, only Fier, Laswell and Arto Lindsay remained.
&quot;Visions of Excess&quot; also marked the debut of singer Syd Straw, whose songwriting and vocals were featured prominently, as well as on the group&#x27;s next album. Michael Stipe, John Lydon and Jack Bruce took turns on lead vocals, while Richard Thompson and Jody Harris were featured on lead guitar.

&quot;Blast of Silence (Axed My Baby for a Nickel)&quot; was released the following year, continuing in much the same vein as &quot;Visions of Excess&quot; and with appearances by many of the same personnel. It included covers of two songs written by Little Feat&#x27;s Lowell George, both sung by Syd Straw. The record also featured prominent guest appearances by Peter Blegvad, Matthew Sweet, Don Dixon, Peter Holsapple and T-Bone Burnett.

&quot;A Dead Horse&quot; (1989) carried on in the sound of its predecessors slightly, but some of the songs crossed into a darker, more ambient and ethereal sound that dominated the Palomino records of the 1990s. Syd Straw had moved on and was no longer in the band, with most of the vocals now handled by Amanda Kramer, formerly of the dance music group Information Society. Fier later was a guest on Straw&#x27;s first solo record, &quot;Surprise&quot;.

===1990–1995===
&quot;Drunk with Passion&quot; marked the first album not on Celluloid Records, taking cues from some of the darker sounds heard on &quot;A Dead Horse&quot; and using more processed and electronic sounds, giving some of its songs an ethereal feel. This album is arguably more influenced by its guest appearances than are any of the previous albums. Guests included Hüsker Dü&#x27;s Bob Mould (who formed the band Sugar the following year), Richard Thompson, and Michael Stipe. Nicky Skopelitis also became more of a cornerstone of the band, contributing to the bulk of &quot;Drunk with Passion&quot;&#x27;s songs along with Fier and Kramer. In 1992, Fier released his first solo record, &quot;Dreamspeed&quot;, which is partially a reworking of the Palomino&#x27;s next album, &quot;This Is How It Feels&quot;.

&quot;This Is How It Feels&quot;, released on Restless Records in 1993, continued the ambient sound of &quot;Drunk with Passion&quot;, but also incorporated elements of club and trance music. It also marked the introduction of new lead vocalist Lori Carson, who co-wrote nine of the CD&#x27;s tracks with Anton Fier. Bill Laswell also returned to contribute on this record, and his production work on this and on the following record, &quot;Pure&quot;, heavily influenced Laswell&#x27;s own remix work of the late 1990s, as seen on the CDs &quot;Emerald Ather&quot; and &quot;City of Light&quot;. The album also contains the first cover song since &quot;Blast of Silence&quot;, an ethereal, drum-machine-laced re-interpretation of Jackson Browne&#x27;s &quot;These Days&quot;. To further highlight the album&#x27;s dance elements, an EP of remixes of songs from &quot;This Is How It Feels&quot;, entitled &quot;Prison of the Rhythm&quot;, was released shortly after the CD&#x27;s release.

&quot;Pure&quot;, released a year later, is seen by many as the band&#x27;s most focused work, owing much to the strong contributions once again of Carson, Laswell, and Skopelitis. Tracks such as &quot;No Skin&quot; and &quot;Pure&quot; continue in the dance/ambient style of the previous album. The CD also stirred a minor controversy over the bare female breast on its cover, with some stores carrying a version of the CD with a booklet and the cover replaced by simple, text-based artwork. Another remix EP (&quot;No Thought, No Breath, No Eyes, No Heart&quot;) accompanied &quot;Pure&quot;&#x27;s release.

&quot;Pure&quot; was also the last Palominos record for Lori Carson. However, the song &quot;Little Suicides&quot;, from &quot;Pure&quot; showed the same sparse sound, production, and strong yet quiet vocals (albeit less electronic) that influenced Carson&#x27;s solo work. Anton Fier produced Carson&#x27;s 1995 solo record, &quot;Where It Goes&quot;.

1994 also saw the release of what was essentially Fier&#x27;s second solo recording, &quot;Absence of Time&quot; (released under the moniker Blind Light), which used outtakes from &quot;Pure&quot; for much of its framework.

===1995–2000===
&quot;Dead Inside&quot; (1996) was another stylistic turnaround for the Palominos, and their last proper album. This record had a deathly, industrial sound, with the line-up consisting only of Fier, multi-instrumentalist Knox Chandler (who before joining the Palominos, was also in a band with Lori Carson), Nicky Skopelitis, and poet Nicole Blackman. Blackman&#x27;s dark and deliberate lyrics (tellingly, Blackman had also recently worked with the industrial German band KMFDM) made &quot;Dead Inside&quot; a challenging record; its sound and tone stand out as decidedly unlike any of the others. The album&#x27;s opener is a brutal, spoken-word track, &quot;Victim&quot;, which details a woman&#x27;s thoughts as she is abducted and eventually murdered by her kidnapper.

In 1997, The Palominos released another EP, named &quot;Dead Outside&quot;, composed of five remixes of tracks from &quot;Dead Inside&quot;. The EP, in a novelty for its time, was released as free MP3s on the Internet, made available via Nicole Blackman&#x27;s website and through a fan-created band appreciation website (since decommissioned). The EP consisted of five remixes, each released sequentially for download from the sites for one month only, as per Fier&#x27;s instructions:

# &quot;Victim: The Last Thing&quot; by Sean Beavan (whose credits include 8MM, Nine Inch Nails, and Marilyn Manson) with John Van Eaton
# &quot;Ride: Pragmatic Spasmatic&quot; by Raymond Watts (of KMFDM &amp; Pig)
# &quot;Belfast: Empty as Wire&quot; by Scanner (a frequent Blackman collaborator)
# &quot;Ride&quot; remixed by Mark Walk (of Ruby)
# &quot;Victim: Interference&quot; by John Van Eaton (another Blackman collaborator who also worked with NiN for 10 years)

Fier brought the Golden Palominos to an end after the release of &quot;Dead Inside&quot;, as he was unhappy with Restless Records and struggling with a drinking problem.

===2000–2012===
Both Syd Straw and Lori Carson have gone on to moderately successful and critically acclaimed solo careers, with Carson a frequent contributor to television shows and movies. A compilation of some of Carson&#x27;s contributed songs, titled &quot;Stolen Beauty&quot;, was released by Rykodisc in 2003, and her last solo record, &quot;The Finest Thing&quot;, was released in 2004.

Anton Fier reappeared on the music scene in 2009, producing Drivin&#x27; &#x27;n&#x27; Cryin&#x27;s album &quot;The Great American Bubble Factory&quot;, which was the band&#x27;s first album in 12 years.

In 2010, the Golden Palominos played two shows in New York City: a May 7 show at Le Poisson Rouge and a May 11 show at The Living Room. Both shows were an unqualified success and speculation began as to if more dates or a re-formation of the band was in the future.

At around the same time, Fier began drumming again in New York City as a sideman to his friend Tony Scherr, and Kevn Kinney, the lead singer of Drivin&#x27; &#x27;n&#x27; Cryin&#x27;, re-connected with Fier at these shows.

Fier and Kinney rekindled their friendship and began rehearsing together again, which then progressed into starting a Kickstarter campaign to fund a new Kevin Kinney album. The album, &quot;A Good Country Mile&quot;, was released on February 21, 2012, and is billed as &#x27;Kevn Kinney and The Golden Palominos&#x27; (composed of Fier on drums, Scherr on guitars, and Andy Hess, formerly of Gov&#x27;t Mule, on bass as well as Aaron Lee Tasjan on guitars and backing vocals). Initial reviews of the album were positive with &quot;Jambands&quot; stating the &quot;...resulting music is raw and lovely and real as hell.&quot; While this represents the first music from the Palominos in nearly 15 years, any additional projects exclusively under the Golden Palominos moniker have not materialized.

Anton Fier died on September 22, 2022, at the age of 66.

===Compilations===
Much of the Golden Palominos&#x27; work has become increasingly hard to find, and compilations do not provide a complete overview of their work. A few best-of compilations are available: two &quot;A History&quot; collections on Celluloid both released in 1992; a German collection released in 1997; and 2002&#x27;s collection &quot;Run Pony Run&quot;. However, none include any material from &quot;Drunk with Passion&quot; onward. The later albums on Restless are growing harder to find on CD, with the earliest CDs on Celluloid and &quot;Drunk with Passion&quot; being nearly non-existent. (&quot;Dreamspeed&quot; is also extremely rare in its original release and is a prized possession of Fier aficionados. However, Fier re-released it and his other solo record, &quot;Absence of Time&quot;, on John Zorn&#x27;s Tzadik label in late 2003.)

<text>Peter von Cornelius (23 September 1783, Düsseldorf – 6 March 1867, Berlin) was a German painter; one of the main representatives of the Nazarene movement. He was the uncle of the composer Peter Cornelius (1824–1874).

==Life==

===Early years===
Cornelius was born in Düsseldorf. From the age of twelve he attended drawing classes at the Düsseldorf Academy. His father, who was superintendent of the Düsseldorf gallery and professor at the academy, died in 1799, after which Cornelius supported his family by his work as a portraitist and illustrator. In a letter to the Count Raczynski he wrote:It fell to the lot of an elder brother and myself to watch over the interests of a numerous family. It was at this time that it was attempted to persuade my mother that it would be better for me to devote myself to the trade of a goldsmith than to continue to pursue painting – in the first place, in consequence of the time necessary to 
qualify me for the art, and in the next, because there were already so many painters. My dear mother, however, rejected all this advice, and I felt myself impelled onward by an uncontrollable enthusiasm, to which the confidence of my mother gave new strength, which was supported by the continual fear that I should be removed from the study of that art I loved so much.

His earliest major work was the decoration of the choir of the church of St Quirinus at Neuss, commissioned by Canon Wallraff of Cologne in 1803. In 1809, he began a series of drawings illustrating Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;, the first part of which had been published the previous year. For these Cornelius employed a linear style much influenced by a facsimile edition of Dürer&#x27;s prayer book for Maximilian I. Six of the images were shown to the poet, who approved of them. Cornelius continued the series following his move to Rome, and it was published in twelve engravings between 1816 and 1826, under the title &quot;Bilder zu Goethe&#x27;s Faust&quot;. He moved to Frankfurt in 1809, and worked there until going to Rome two years later.

===Rome===
Cornelius arrived in Rome on 14 October 1811, and soon became one of the most promising of the &quot;Lukasbund&quot; or &quot;Nazarene Brotherhood&quot;, a group of young German artists resident in the city, which included Johann Friedrich Overbeck, Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow, Philipp Veit, Julius Schnorr von Karolsfeld and Ludwig Vogel, a fraternity (some of whom selected a ruinous convent for their home) who had banded together for resolute study and mutual criticism. At Rome Cornelius participated, with other members of the brotherhood, in the decoration of the Casa Zuccari (the residence of Jakob Salomon Bartholdy, the Prussian consul general), and the Villa Massimi, while at the same time also working on designs for the illustration of the &quot;Nibelungenlied&quot;.

===Return to Germany===
In 1819, Cornelius left the frescoes at the Villa Massimi unfinished and returned to Germany, having been summoned to Munich by the crown-prince of Bavaria, later King Ludwig I, to direct the decorations for his new sculpture gallery, the Glyptothek. In 1821, he took on, in addition to his work for Ludwig, the directorship of the Düsseldorf Academy. He soon discovered, however, that attention to such widely separated duties was incompatible with the just performance of either, and so eventually he resigned his post at Düsseldorf, some of his pupils following him to Munich to assist him there. At the death of Director Langer, 1824–5, he became director of the Munich Academy.

===Works in Munich and Berlin===

The fresco decorations of the Ludwigskirche in Munich, which were for the most part designed and executed by Cornelius, were perhaps the most important mural works of their time. The large fresco of the Last Judgment, over the high altar in that church, measures in height by in width. The frescoes of the Creator, the Nativity, and the Crucifixion in the same building are also upon a large scale. Other major works in Munich included his decorations in the Pinakothek and in the Glyptothek; those in the latter building, in the hall of the gods and the hall of the hero-myths, are perhaps the best known. In about 1839–40, he left Munich for Berlin to work on a series of cartoons, depicting the Apocalypse, for a cycle of frescoes commissioned by Frederick William IV for a proposed &quot;Campo Santo&quot; or royal mausoleum in Berlin. The king abandoned his plans following the revolution of 1848, but Cornelius continued to work on the cartoons for the rest of his life.

He maintained close contact with the art world in Rome, and returned to live there between 1853 and 1869.

==Style and technique==

Cornelius, as an oil painter, possessed little technical skill, and his works do not exhibit any instinctive appreciation of colour. Even as a fresco painter his manipulative power was not great. In critically examining the execution in colour of some of his magnificent designs, one cannot help feeling that he was, in this respect, unable to do them full justice. Cornelius and his associates endeavoured to follow in their works the spirit of the Italian painters. But the Italian strain is to a considerable extent modified by the Dürer heritage. This Dürer influence is manifest in a tendency to overcrowding in composition, in a degree of attenuation in the proportions of, and a poverty of contour in, the nude figure, and also in a leaning to the selection of Gothic forms for draperies. These peculiarities are even noticeable in Cornelius&#x27;s principal work of the &quot;Last Judgment&quot;, in the Ludwigskirche in Munich.

The attenuation and want of flexibility of contour in the nude are perhaps most conspicuous in his frescoes of classical subjects in the Glyptothek, especially in that representing the contention for the body of Patroclus. But despite these peculiarities there is always in his works a grandeur and nobility of conception. Although not dexterous in the handling of the brush, he could conceive and design a subject with masterly purpose. If he had an imperfect eye for colour, he had vast mental foresight in directing the German school of painting; and his favorite motto of &quot;Deutschland uber alles&quot; indicates the direction and the strength of his patriotism. His pupils included Karl Hermann, Wilhelm von Kaulbach and Adam Eberle. Cornelius often relied on pupils and assistants for the execution, and sometimes even the design of the projects of which he was in charge. The cartoons for the Glyptothek were all by Cornelius&#x27;s own hand; in the Pinakothek, however, his sketches and small drawings sufficed, and at the Ludwigskirche even the invention of some of the subjects was entrusted to Hermann.

==Influence==
In 1855, Théophile Gautier wrote that Cornelius &quot;enjoyed a celebrity such as few artists enjoy in their lifetime&quot;, adding that he was admired &quot;as if he were already dead&quot;. To comprehend and appreciate thoroughly the magnitude of the work which Cornelius accomplished for Germany, we must remember that at the beginning of the 19th century Germany had no national school of art. Germany was in painting and sculpture behind all the rest of Europe. Yet in less than half a century Cornelius founded a great school, revived mural painting, and turned the gaze of the art world towards Munich. The German revival of mural painting had its effect upon England, as well as upon other European nations, and led to the famous cartoon competitions held in Westminster Hall, and ultimately to the partial decoration of the Houses of Parliament. In November 1841, when the latter work was in contemplation, Cornelius, in response to invitations, visited England. His opinion was in every way favourable to the carrying out of the project, and even in respect of the durability of fresco in the English climate.

Cornelius, in his teaching, always inculcated a close and rigorous study of nature, but he understood by the study of nature something more than constantly making studies from life; he meant the study of nature with an inquiring and scientific spirit. Study nature, was the advice he once gave, in order that you may become acquainted with its essential forms.

<doc id="866025" wikidata="Q12068125" url="?curid=866025" title="Sampson Medal">
<text>The Sampson Medal was a U.S. Navy campaign medal. The medal was authorized by an Act of Congress in 1901. The medal was awarded to those personnel who served on ships in the fleet of Rear Admiral William T. Sampson during combat operations in the waters of the West Indies and Cuba. The Sampson Medal was also known as the West Indies Naval Campaign Medal, not to be confused with the West Indies Campaign Medal which was a separate award. A similar commemorative decoration was the Dewey Medal, considered senior to the Sampson Medal.

==Creation==
The Sampson Medal was first authorized by a Joint resolution of the United States Congress on March 3, 1901. The resolution authorized the Secretary of the Navy to have produced bronze medals to commemorate naval engagements in the West Indies and on the shores of Cuba during the Spanish–American War. The medal was to be presented to the officers and men of the United States Navy and Marine Corps who participated in engagements and battles that were deemed to be of sufficient importance to merit their commemoration.

The resolution also stipulated that those who might be eligible for recognition for participation in more than one engagement would not receive a second medal, but would receive a &quot;bronze bar appropriately inscribed, to be attached to the ribbon by which the medal is suspended.&quot;

==Appearance==
The obverse of the medal was designed by Charles E. Barber. It depicts a bust of Admiral Sampson. The reverse was designed by George T. Morgan. It depicts a Navy officer, Sailor, and Marine standing upon a block identifying the action for which the medal was awarded. Suspending the ribbon of the medal is a brooch pin with the name of the recipient&#x27;s ship. The recipient&#x27;s name is engraved on the lower rim of the medal, this being one of only two medals officially issued named to a recipient.

Campaign clasps or engagement bars were authorized for wear on the ribbon, showing various battles and the ship name which had participated. The medal was issued for 47 engagements or skirmishes and some were awarded with several engagement bars. When worn as a ribbon on a military uniform, there were no devices authorized.

<doc id="866026" wikidata="Q4752973" url="?curid=866026" title="Ancient planter">
<text>&quot;Ancient planter&quot; (sometimes called ancient colony men) was a term applied to early colonists who migrated to the Colony of Virginia when the settlement was managed privately by the Virginia Company of London. A colonist received a land grant if they remained in Virginia for at least three years. Under the terms of the &quot;Instructions to Governor Yeardley&quot; (issued in 1618), these colonists received the first land grants in the New World.

==History==

These land grants constituted a dividend paid out by the Virginia Company of London, which was constituted as a joint stock company. Under the terms of the Second Charter, issued in 1609, the Company offered shares for twelve pounds ten shillings per share, to be invested and reinvested for seven years. Those men who ventured to Virginia in person, investing their time and risking their lives, would each be counted as holding one share.

In 1616, at the end of the administration of Sir Thomas Dale, the first dividend became due and payable to all who had invested, whether by the purchase of shares or by &quot;personal adventure&quot;. However, since the colony had not prospered, there was no money to divide. Instead, the Company offered grants of land. Colonists who had paid their own passage to Virginia received a &quot;first dividend&quot; of , free of quit-rent, for their &quot;personal adventure&quot;, and an additional hundred acres for each share they owned in the London Company:

Those who had been brought at the Company&#x27;s expense (as indentured servants) also received 100 acres for their &quot;personal adventure&quot;, but in their case the land was subject to an annual rent of one shilling per 50 acres:


Colonists who arrived after the departure of Sir Thomas Dale were entitled to a lesser grant of . The London Company reasoned that &quot;... by the singular Industry and virtue of the said Sir Thomas Dale the former Difficulties and Dangers were in greatest part overcome to the great ease and security of such as have been since that time transported thither&quot;. In other words, those who had come earlier received twice as much land, supposedly in recognition of the greater risks and hardships they had endured. Of course, reducing the size of the grant to 50 acres also saved the hard-pressed Company a great deal of money, and the later colonists can scarcely be said to have experienced the &quot;great ease and security&quot; mentioned by the Company; the death rate continued extremely high.

The phrase &quot;ancient planter&quot; was not an honorific; it was simply a descriptive term, as used in the &quot;Instructions&quot;, for a planter of long standing.

According to a letter from John Rolfe dated January 1619/20: 
==Identification==

Because the surviving historical records are incomplete, and sometimes demonstrably inaccurate, it is not possible to compile a definitive list of ancient planters.

The database of Colonial Land Office Patents at the Library of Virginia is the principal source of information as to the identities of those who received grants as ancient planters. Though the record does not begin until 1623, when administration of the colony was taken over by the Crown, many of the subsequent patents identify &quot;ancient planters&quot;, or provide information which shows that a tract of land must have been originally granted under the terms applying to Ancient Planters.

Additional information comes from the 1624/5 Muster, a census ordered as part of the handover of the colony from the Virginia Company to the Crown. For some of the colonists, the census includes information on the year and ship of arrival. In many cases this valuable information is missing.

Also as part of the transition to Crown Colony status, a list of grants was compiled in 1625 and sent to London. This list does not identify the ancient planters as such, but in some cases knowledge of the grant combined with information from other sources (e.g., knowledge of the date of arrival) is enough to show that the planter in question must have received the grant as an ancient planter.

<text>Sir William Henry Mahoney Christie (1 October 1845 – 22 January 1922) was a British astronomer.

He was born in Woolwich, London, the son of Samuel Hunter Christie and educated at King&#x27;s College School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He was fourth wrangler in 1868 and was elected a fellow of Trinity in 1869.

Having been Chief Assistant at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich from 1870 to 1881, he was appointed to replace George Airy as the eighth Astronomer Royal in 1881 and remained in office until 1910. He received the degree D.Sc. &quot;(honoris causa)&quot; from the University of Oxford in June 1902, and was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1904. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June, 1881. He was president of the Royal Astronomical Society from 1888 to 1890.

The first Astronomer Royal to retire at 65 (all previous incumbents bar Airy and John Pond had died in office; John Pond had been forced by poor health to resign in 1835, while Airy retired aged 81), Christie died and was buried at sea near Gibraltar in 1922. He had married in 1881 Mary Violette, daughter of Sir Alfred Hickman.

<doc id="866029" wikidata="Q1929352" url="?curid=866029" title="Roots rock">
<text>Roots rock is a genre of rock music that looks back to rock&#x27;s origins in folk, blues and country music. It is seen as a response to the perceived excesses of the dominant psychedelic and the developing progressive rock. Because &quot;roots music&quot; (Americana) is often used to mean folk and world musical forms, roots rock is sometimes used in a broad sense to describe any rock music that incorporates elements of this music. 

After a further decline, the 2000s saw a new interest in &quot;roots&quot; music. One proof of that is the specific Grammy Award given since 2015, notably to Jon Batiste in 2022. According to their website, that trophy is defined as: &quot;This category recognizes excellence in Americana, bluegrass, blues or folk recordings in modern and/or traditional vocal and instrumental styles, as well as original material by artists who use traditional and/or modern roots elements, sounds and instrumental techniques as the basis for their recordings.&quot;

==History==

In 1966, as many rock artists moved towards expansive and experimental psychedelia, Bob Dylan spearheaded the back-to-basics roots revival when he went to Nashville to record the album &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot;, using notable local musicians like Charlie McCoy. This, and the subsequent more clearly country-influenced albums, &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; (1967) and &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot; (1969), have been seen as creating the genre of country folk, a route pursued by a number of, largely acoustic, folk musicians. Other acts that followed the back to basics trend in different ways were the Canadian/American group The Band and the California-based Creedence Clearwater Revival, both of which mixed basic rock and roll with folk, country, and blues, to be among the most successful and influential bands of the late 1960s. At the same time the Grateful Dead, a band previously associated with the San Francisco sound and known for ferocious psychedelic improvisation, followed in the footsteps of Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash to focus on Americana-styled songwriting for their 1970 albums &quot;Workingman&#x27;s Dead&quot; and &quot;American Beauty&quot;. The same movement saw the beginning of the recording careers of Californian solo artists like Ry Cooder, Bonnie Raitt, and Lowell George.

===Blues rock===

The blues boom overlapped, both chronologically and in terms of personnel, with the earlier, wider rhythm and blues phase, which had begun to peter out in the mid-1960s leaving a nucleus of instrumentalists with a wide knowledge of blues forms and techniques, which they would carry into the pursuit of more purist blues interests. Blues Incorporated and John Mayall and the Bluesbreakers were well known in the London Jazz and emerging R&amp;B circuits, but the Bluesbreakers began to gain some national and international attention, particularly after the release of &quot;Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton&quot; album (1966), considered one of the seminal British blues recordings. From 1966 to 1968, young Englishmen formed blues rock bands such as Cream, Fleetwood Mac, Keef Hartley Band, Ten Years After, and Free. In America, Paul Butterfield Blues Band, Canned Heat, and Johnny Winter performed at Woodstock Festival 1969.

===Country rock===

Dylan&#x27;s lead was also followed by the Byrds, who were joined by Gram Parsons in 1968. Earlier in the year Parsons had already recorded &quot;Safe at Home&quot; with the International Submarine Band, which made extensive use of pedal steel guitar and is seen by some as the first true country-rock album. The result of Parsons tenure in the Byrds was &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot; (1968), generally considered one of the finest and most influential recordings in the genre. The Byrds continued for a brief period in the same vein, but Parsons left soon after the album was released to be joined by another ex-Byrds member Chris Hillman in forming the Flying Burrito Brothers. Over the next two years they recorded the albums &quot;The Gilded Palace of Sin&quot; (1969) and &quot;Burrito Deluxe&quot; (1970), which helped establish the respectability and parameters of the genre, before Parsons departed to pursue a solo career.

Country rock was a particularly popular style in the California music scene of the late 1960s, and was adopted by bands including C.C.R., Poco, and New Riders of the Purple Sage. Some folk-rockers followed the Byrds into the genre, among them the Beau Brummels and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. A number of performers also enjoyed a renaissance by adopting country sounds, including: the Everly Brothers, whose &quot;Roots&quot; album (1968) is usually considered some of their finest work; former teen idol Ricky Nelson (after dropping the &quot;Y&quot; from his name and letting his hair grow) who became the frontman for the Stone Canyon Band; Michael Nesmith who formed the First National Band after his departure from the Monkees; and Neil Young who moved in and out of the genre throughout his career. One of the few acts to successfully move from the country side towards rock were the bluegrass band The Dillards.

The greatest commercial success for country rock came in the 1970s, with the Doobie Brothers mixing in elements of R&amp;B, Emmylou Harris (a former backing singer for Parsons) becoming the &quot;Queen of country-rock&quot;, and Linda Ronstadt creating a highly successful pop-orientated brand of the genre. Members of Ronstadt&#x27;s former backing band went on to form the Eagles (made up of members of the Burritos, Poco, and Stone Canyon Band), and emerged as one of the most successful rock acts of all time, producing albums that included &quot;Desperado&quot; (1973) and &quot;Hotel California&quot; (1976). Country rock began to fade in the late 1970s in the face of punk and new wave trends.

===Southern rock===
Although the Southern states had been, as much as anywhere, the birthplace of rock and roll, after the decline of rockabilly in the late 1950s, it was not until the early 1970s that a distinctive regional style of rock music emerged. (This was despite some successful bands from the region, a major contribution to the evolution of soul music in the Stax-Volt records company and the existence of the Muscle Shoals and FAME Studios). The founders of Southern rock are usually thought to be the Allman Brothers Band, who developed a distinctive sound, largely derived from blues rock, but incorporating elements of boogie, soul, and country; combining hard rock instrumentation and rhythms with accented vocals and Duane Allman&#x27;s slide guitar.

Of the acts that followed the Allmans into the emerging genre, the most successful was Lynyrd Skynyrd, who with songs like &quot;Free Bird&quot; (1973) and &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; (1974) helped establish the &quot;Good ol&#x27; boy&quot; image of the subgenre and the general shape of 1970s guitar rock. They were followed by many other bands, including the Atlanta Rhythm Section, ZZ Top, Black Oak Arkansas, Potliquor, Barefoot Jerry, Grinderswitch, Wet Willie, Blackfoot, Johnny Winter, Edgar Winter Group, Sea Level, and the more country-influenced The Marshall Tucker Band. After the loss of original members of the Allmans and Lynyrd Skynyrd, the genre began to fade in popularity in the late 1970s, but was sustained the 1980s with acts like the Outlaws, Georgia Satellites, the Fabulous Thunderbirds, Stevie Ray Vaughan &amp; Double Trouble, Jimmie Vaughan, Pointblank, .38 Special, and Molly Hatchet.

===Swamp rock===

Swamp rock originated in the mid-1960s as a fusion of rockabilly and soul music with swamp blues, country music and funk. The style also drew from beat music, country blues, Cajun music and New Orleans rhythm and blues. Part of the early swamp rock scene were John Fogerty &amp; C.C.R., Leon Russell, Dale Hawkins, Tony Joe White, and Delaney &amp; Bonnie.

===Heartland rock===

The term heartland rock was first used in the early 1970s to describe Midwestern arena rock groups like Kansas, REO Speedwagon, and Styx, but came to be associated with a more socially concerned form of roots rock more directly influenced by folk, country, and rock and roll. It has been seen as an American Midwest and Rust Belt counterpart to West Coast country rock and the Southern rock of the American South. Led by figures who had initially been identified with punk and new wave, it was most strongly influenced by acts such as Bob Dylan, the Byrds, Creedence Clearwater Revival, and Van Morrison, 1960s garage rock, and the Rolling Stones.

Exemplified by the commercial success of singer songwriters Bruce Springsteen, Bob Seger, and Tom Petty, along with less widely known acts such as Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes and Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers, it was partly a reaction to post-industrial urban decline in the East and Mid-West, often dwelling on issues of social disintegration and isolation, beside a form of good-time rock and roll revivalism. The genre reached its commercial, artistic, and influential peak in the mid-1980s, with Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born in the USA&quot; (1984), topping the charts worldwide and spawning a series of top ten singles, together with the arrival of artists including John Cougar/Mellencamp, Steve Earle, and more gentle singer/songwriters such as Bruce Hornsby. It also impacted the United Kingdom in the 1980s through Dire Straits. It can also be heard as an influence on artists as diverse as Billy Joel and Kid Rock. Though various heartland rock acts had sustained success through the 1990s, such as Tom Petty, Bruce Springsteen, The Wallflowers, and to a lesser extent, the BoDeans and Los Lobos, Heartland rock&#x27;s commercial prosperity and general popularity began to fade away as early as the early 1990s. As rock music in general, and blue collar and white working class themes in particular, lost influence with younger audiences, heartland&#x27;s artists turned to more personal works. Subsequently, however, American bands the Killers and the War on Drugs and English act Sam Fender firmly integrated the heartland rock genre into their respective musical styles.

===1980s revival===
The term &quot;roots rock&quot; was coined during the mid-1980s. A number of key bands were defined as cow punk, punk rockers who played country music, including Jason &amp; The Scorchers from Tennessee, Dash Rip Rock from Louisiana, and Drivin N Cryin from Georgia, but the centre of the cow punk movement became Los Angeles, thanks to bands including the Long Ryders, Tex &amp; the Horseheads, the Rave-Ups, Lone Justice, and Rank and File. Also part of this trend and enjoying some mainstream success were Gun Club, Chris Isaak, Violent Femmes, BoDeans, and Los Lobos.

In addition the alternative country movement, producing such figures as Steve Earle, Lucinda Williams, and Uncle Tupelo, can be seen as part of the roots rock tendency. The movement began to decline in popularity again in the 1990s but produced some bands like Son Volt, Wilco, and The Bottle Rockets.

After disbanding Dire Straits in 1995, lead singer Mark Knopfler has largely returned to a roots-rock sound across his ten albums.
