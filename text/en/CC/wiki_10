<text>The Piper PA-24 Comanche is an American single-engine, low-wing, all-metal monoplane of semimonocoque construction with tricycle retractable landing gear and four or six seats. The Comanche was designed and built by Piper Aircraft and first flew on May 24, 1956. Together with the PA-30 and PA-39 Twin Comanches, it made up the core of Piper&#x27;s lineup until 1972, when the production lines for both aircraft were destroyed in the 1972 Lock Haven flood.

==Design and development==

Two prototypes were built in 1956, with the first being completed by June 20, 1956. The first production aircraft, powered by a Lycoming O-360-A1A engine, first flew on October 21, 1957. In 1958, it was joined by a higher-powered PA-24-250 with a Lycoming O-540-A1A5 engine; this model was originally to be known as the PA-26, but Piper decided to keep the PA-24 designation.

In 1964, the PA-24-400 was introduced. The following year, the PA-24-250 was superseded by the PA-24-260, featuring the Lycoming IO-540D or E engine of . A turbocharged version using a Rajay turbocharger was introduced in 1970.

Production of the Comanche ended in 1972, when torrential rains from Hurricane Agnes caused the great Susquehanna River flood of 1972, flooding the manufacturing plant and destroying airframes, parts, and much of the tooling necessary for production. Rather than rebuild the tooling, Piper chose to abandon production of the Comanche and Twin Comanche and continue with two newer designs already in production at Piper&#x27;s other plant in Vero Beach, Florida - the PA-28R-200 Arrow and the twin-engined PA-34 Seneca.

==Variants==

===Comanche 180===
The original version of the Comanche was the PA-24-180, which featured a carbureted Lycoming O-360-A1A engine, swept tail, laminar flow airfoil, and all-flying stabilator.

The standard fuel capacity of the PA-24-180 was . The flaps were manually actuated, controlled by the same Johnson bar actuator as the Piper Cherokee. The aircraft specifications were for cruise speeds of and fuel burns between at 55 and 75% power settings, respectively. Full-fuel payload with standard fuel was , with a gross weight of and range with 45-minute reserve of .

When new, standard, typically equipped Comanche 180s sold between $17,850 (1958) and $21,580 (1964). A total of 1,143 were built.

===Comanche 250===
In 1958, Piper introduced a version using a Lycoming O-540 engine, giving the PA-24-250 Comanche a top cruise speed of . Most 250s had carbureted Lycoming O-540-AIA5 engines, but a small number were fitted out with fuel-injected versions of the same engine. Early Comanche 250s had manually operated flaps and carried of fuel. Auxiliary fuel tanks ( total) became available in 1961. Electrically actuated flaps were made standard with the 1962 model year.

The PA-24-250 was the most numerous of the single Comanches; 2,537 were built.

===Comanche 260===

Four 260-horsepower (194 kW) versions of the Comanche were introduced beginning in 1965. They were:
*PA-24-260 (1965)
*PA-24-260B (1966 to 1968)
*PA-24-260C (1969 to 1972)
*PA-24-260TC (Turbocharged 260C) (1970 to 1972)

A total of 1,029 airplanes were sold from the Comanche 260 line, including the 260TC.

The 260 had an empty weight around and a maximum gross weight of . It had four seats, and a -capacity auxiliary fuel system was available as an option. Cruise speed was advertised as with fuel burn of .

The 260B had an overall length more than the previous models due to a longer propeller spinner, not a longer fuselage. The 260B had a third side window and a provision for six seats. The fifth and sixth seats take up the entire baggage area and seat smaller adults, placarded to a total weight of . Typical empty weight was and gross weight was . Fuel burn was and advertised speed was .

The 260C introduced a new &quot;Tiger Shark&quot; cowling, maximum gross weight of , cowl flaps, and an aileron-rudder interconnect. Cruise speed was advertised as with fuel flow of . To prevent possible aft center-of-gravity problems due to the increased gross weight and its fifth and sixth seats, the propeller shaft was extended. This moved the center of gravity slightly forward. With a useful load of , it has the largest payload of all of the Comanches except the 400. Often mistaken on the ramp for the 400 model, the slightly longer cowling includes a distinctively longer nose gear door, as compared to the B models and older versions.

Starting in 1970, Piper offered a turbo-normalized variant of the PA-24-260 known as the 260TC with a Lycoming IO-540-R1A5 engine and dual Rajay turbochargers. Twenty-six were produced between 1970 and 1972. Advertised by Piper as a &quot;second throttle&quot;, the turbochargers are controlled using a manual wastegate assembly that places an additional handle labeled &quot;boost&quot; next to the throttle handle in the cockpit, effectively creating a secondary throttle. The TC model is certified for flight to , with an advertised turbo critical altitude of , giving a maximum true airspeed of .

===PA-24-300===
In 1967, one aircraft was modified with a Lycoming engine for trials. It did not enter production.

===PA-24-380===
Two prototype aircraft were built in 1961. They were standard Comanche airframes, but had Lycoming IO-720-A1A engines with a three-bladed propeller. The design was modified with an even larger engine and produced as the PA-24-400.

===Comanche 400===
The PA-24-400 Comanche 400 was produced from 1964 to 1966. Only 148 PA-24-400s were built.

The Comanche 400 is powered by the , horizontally opposed, eight-cylinder Lycoming IO-720 engine, developed specifically for the model. Cooling problems have happened with the rear cylinders. 
The Comanche 400 has a three-bladed propeller and carries of fuel, or with optional extended tanks. Fuel burn was advertised as , at 55-75% power. The high fuel burn means that it is expensive to operate. The 400 had a typical empty weight of and a maximum gross weight of .

Book speeds for the PA-24-400 included a cruising speed of and a top speed of .

While identical in planform to other PA-24 models, the 400 is structurally strengthened, primarily in the tail, with an extra nose rib in the stabilator and the vertical fin. The stabilator, vertical fin, and rudder of the 400 share virtually no common parts with the 180, 250, or Comanches.

===Twin Comanche===
===PA-33===
In 1967, a single Comanche was modified by Swearingen with a pressurized cabin. The prototype, powered by a Lycoming O-540 engine and equipped with Twin Comanche landing gear, was designated the PA-33. First flown on March 11, 1967, the prototype later crashed on takeoff in May 1967 and the project was cancelled.

==World records==

===Max Conrad===
In June 1959, Max Conrad flew a Comanche 250 on a record-breaking distance flight in Fédération Aéronautique Internationale C1-D Class, for aircraft from to less than . Having removed the interior seats and replaced them with fuel tanks, Conrad flew nonstop from Casablanca, Morocco, to Los Angeles, a distance of . When the aircraft took off from Casablanca, it was heavily overloaded and just cleared the airport fence. The Comanche 250 Max Conrad flew for this flight is now located in the museum at the Liberal, Kansas, airport.

On November 24–26, 1959, Conrad flew a Comanche 180 on a distance record flight in FAI C1-C Class for aircraft taking off at weights from to less than that still stands: Casablanca to El Paso, Texas, nonstop, a distance of , in 56 hours 26 minutes. He set a closed-circuit distance record in the same aircraft on July 4–6 November 1960, flying .

=== Kenneth Walker ===
On 14 May 1962, Kenneth Walker arrived in Brisbane, Australia, in a PA-24-250 on a delivery flight from San Francisco. Walker&#x27;s flight was the first ever solo single-engine crossing of the Pacific, and the third solo crossing from the US to Australia. From Brisbane, Walker continued south to deliver the Comanche to the Royal Newcastle Aero Club at Maitland, New South Wales, Australia. 

===Toku-Hana===

In July 1964, Henry Ohye, flying a 1961 PA-24-250, made the first successful trans-Pacific flight from the United States to Japan in a single-engined aircraft. He flew from Los Angeles to Tokyo with stops in Honolulu, Midway, Wake, Guam, and Okinawa.

===Myth Too===
A 1966 Comanche 260B, named &quot;Myth Too&quot; and registered as G-ATOY, was owned by English aviator Sheila Scott. The aircraft, flown by Scott, holds 90 world-class light aviation records. It is on public display at the National Museum of Flight, Scotland.

===Oldest circumnavigator===
The circumnavigation by the oldest pilot on record in 1994 was made by Fred Lasby at age 82 in a Comanche 260B.

==Accidents==
*The 1963 Camden PA-24 crash – On March 5, 1963, country music singers Patsy Cline, Lloyd &quot;Cowboy&quot; Copas, and Hawkshaw Hawkins were on board a Comanche owned and piloted by Cline&#x27;s manager, Randy Hughes, when it crashed in deteriorating weather near Camden, Tennessee, killing all on board.

<doc id="847349" wikidata="Q1877372" url="?curid=847349" title="Lunar Landing Research Vehicle">
<text>The Bell Aerosystems Lunar Landing Research Vehicle (LLRV, nicknamed the Flying Bedstead) was a Project Apollo era program to build a simulator for the Moon landings. The LLRVs were used by the FRC, now known as the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center, at Edwards Air Force Base, California, to study and analyze piloting techniques needed to fly and land the Apollo Lunar Module in the Moon&#x27;s low gravity environment.

The research vehicles were vertical take-off vehicles that used a single jet engine mounted on a gimbal so that it always pointed vertically. It was adjusted to cancel 5/6 of the vehicle&#x27;s weight, and the vehicle used hydrogen peroxide rockets which could fairly accurately simulate the behavior of a lunar lander.

Success of the two LLRVs led to the building of three Lunar Landing Training Vehicles (LLTVs), an improved version of the LLRV, for use by Apollo astronauts at the Manned Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas, predecessor of NASA&#x27;s Johnson Space Center. One LLRV and two LLTVs were destroyed in crashes, but the rocket ejection seat system safely recovered the pilot in all cases.

The final phase of every Apollo landing was manually piloted by the mission commander. Because of landing site selection problems, Neil Armstrong, Apollo 11 commander, said his mission would not have been successful without extensive training on the LLTVs. Selection for LLTV training was preceded by helicopter training. In a 2009 interview, astronaut Curt Michel stated, &quot;For airborne craft, the helicopter was the closest in terms of characteristics to the lunar lander. So if you didn&#x27;t get helicopter training, you knew you weren&#x27;t going. That sort of gave it away.&quot; Even Tom Stafford and Gene Cernan did not get LLTV training for their Apollo 10 mission which was the first flight of the Lunar Module to the Moon, because NASA &quot;didn&#x27;t have plans to land on Apollo 10&quot; so &quot;there wasn&#x27;t any point in ... training in the LLTV.&quot; Cernan only got this training after being assigned as backup commander for Apollo 14, and in 1972 was the last to fly the LLTV while training as commander for Apollo 17, the final landing mission.

==History==
Built of aluminum alloy trusses, the LLRVs were powered by a General Electric CF700-2V turbofan engine with a thrust of 4,200 lbf (19 kN), mounted vertically in a gimbal. The engine lifted the vehicle to the test altitude and was then throttled back to support five-sixths of the vehicle&#x27;s weight, simulating the reduced gravity of the Moon. Two hydrogen peroxide lift rockets with thrust that could be varied from 100 to 500 lbf (440 to 2,200 N) handled the vehicle&#x27;s rate of descent and horizontal movement. Sixteen smaller hydrogen peroxide thrusters, mounted in pairs, gave the pilot control in pitch, yaw and roll.

The pilot had an ejection seat. On activation, it propelled the pilot upward from the vehicle with an acceleration of roughly 14 times the force of gravity for about a half second. From the ground, it was sufficient to propel the seat and pilot to an altitude of about where the pilot&#x27;s parachute could be automatically and successfully deployed. Manufactured by Weber Aircraft LLC, it was one of the first zero-zero ejection seats, capable of saving the operator even if the aircraft was stationary on the ground, a necessity given the LLRV&#x27;s low and slow flight envelope.

After conceptual planning and meetings with engineers from Bell Aerosystems, Buffalo, New York, a company with experience in vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) aircraft, NASA issued Bell a $50,000 study contract in December 1961. Bell had independently conceived a similar, free-flying simulator, and out of this study came the NASA Headquarters&#x27; endorsement of the LLRV concept, resulting in a $3.6 million production contract awarded to Bell on February 1, 1963, for delivery of the first of two vehicles for flight studies at the FRC within 14 months.

LLRV-1 was shipped from Bell to FRC in April. LLRV-2 was also shipped at the same time, but in parts. Because of a potential cost overrun, the FRC Director, Paul Bickle, decided to have it assembled and tested at FRC. The emphasis then was on LLRV-1. It was first readied for flight on a tilt table constructed at FRC to evaluate its engine operation without actually flying it. The scene then shifted to the old South Base area of Edwards.

The first three flights of #1 were made on October 30, 1964 by FRC&#x27;s senior research test pilot, Joe Walker. He continued to pilot a number of flights through December 1964, after which flights were shared with Don Mallick, also a FRC research pilot, and Jack Kleuver, the Army&#x27;s senior helicopter test pilot. Familiarization flights were also made by NASA Manned Spacecraft Center (later Johnson Space Center) pilots Joseph Algranti and H.E. Ream.

Modifications were later made to the cockpits of both LLRVs to better simulate the actual Lunar Module. These included the addition of the LM&#x27;s three-axis hand controller and throttle. A Styrofoam cockpit enclosure was also added to simulate the pilot&#x27;s restricted view in the LM.

The final LLRV flight at FRC took place on November 30, 1966. In December 1966, vehicle #1 was shipped to Houston, followed by #2 in January 1967. During the preceding two years, a total of 198 flights of LLRV-1 and six flights of LLRV-2 had been flown without a serious accident.

The first LLRV flight by Neil Armstrong was made in vehicle #1 on March 27, 1967 from its base at a corner of Ellington Air Force Base, the headquarters for Johnson Space Center&#x27;s aircraft operations. Joe Algranti, chief of JSC&#x27;s Aircraft Operations Division, and test pilot H.E. Ream also made flights that month. Both observed, as did Armstrong and the other astronauts, that if a serious control problem developed, the pilot had little choice but to eject, since the vehicle only operated to a maximum altitude of .

On May 6, 1968, Armstrong was forced to use LLRV-1&#x27;s ejection seat from about altitude after a control problem, and had about four seconds on his full parachute before landing on the ground unhurt. LLRV-1 was lost. The accident investigation board found that the fuel for the vehicle&#x27;s attitude control thrusters had run out and that high winds were a major factor. As a result, JSC management decided to terminate further LLRV flights, as the first LLTV was about to be shipped from Bell to Ellington to begin ground and flight testing.

LLRV-2 (NASA 951) was eventually returned to the Armstrong Flight Research Center, where it is on display as an artifact of the center&#x27;s contribution to the Apollo program. 

===Lunar Landing Training Vehicle===

Negotiations between JSC and Bell Aerosystems for three LLTVs (LLTV-1 to 3), an improved training version of the LLRV, were initiated in October 1966 and a $5.9 million contract for three vehicles was finally signed in March 1967. 

In June 1968, the first vehicle (LLTV-1) was delivered by Bell to Ellington to begin its ground and flight testing by JSC&#x27;s Aircraft Operations Division (AOD). AOD&#x27;s head, Joe Algranti, was the principal test pilot for its first flight in August 1968. Flight testing continued until December 8, when Algranti lost control of LLTV-1 during a flight to expand the vehicle&#x27;s speed envelope. He managed to eject just three-fifths of a second before the vehicle hit the ground, the close call believed to be as a result of his attempt to regain control.

The accident investigation found that the ground controllers had elected not to monitor in real time the attitude thrusters that controlled the vehicle&#x27;s yaw motion, and, at the velocity Algranti was flying, the thrusters had been overpowered by the LLTV&#x27;s aerodynamic forces, causing Algranti to lose control. Due to tight cost constraints on the LLRV and LLTV, wind tunnel testing had been avoided in favor of careful flight testing for evaluation of the vehicles&#x27; aerodynamic characteristics. After reviewing the results of the crash investigation, however, it was decided that the third LLTV (LLTV-3) be loaded into NASA&#x27;s Super Guppy and flown to the Langley Research Center in Virginia for testing in its full-scale wind tunnel. Testing was initiated on January 7, 1968 and ended one month later on February 7.

It was quickly determined that the cause of the divergence was the Styrofoam cockpit enclosure. As the vehicle&#x27;s sideslip angle reached minus two degrees, a yawing force rapidly built up that exceeded the ability of the yaw thrusters to counteract. The fix decided on was simply to remove the top of the enclosure, thus venting it and eliminating the excessive yawing force. It was also possible from the wind tunnel results to develop a preliminary flight envelope for the LLTV, defining its allowable maximum airspeed at various angles of angle of attack and sideslip. All this had to be verified by flight test, however, since it was not possible in the tunnel to obtain good data with the engine running.

A high level LLTV Flight Readiness Review Board was appointed on March 5, 1969 by JSC Director Dr. Robert Gilruth. It consisted of him as chairman, with board members Chris Kraft, head of Mission Operations; George Low, head of JSC&#x27;s Apollo Program; Max Faget, JSC&#x27;s Director of Engineering and astronaut Deke Slayton, Director of Flight Crew Operations. The board reviewed the wind tunnel results, and on March 30 gave approval for the resumption of test flights in LLTV-2. The test program of 18 flights, all flown by H.E. Ream, was successfully completed on June 2. Hence, in the month before the Apollo 11 launch Armstrong was able to complete his LLTV flight training. He commented after his return:

In Armstrong&#x27;s 2005 authorized biography &quot;First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong&quot;, astronaut Bill Anders is quoted as describing the LLTV as &quot;a much unsung hero of the Apollo Program&quot;. Although Armstrong had to eject from the LLRV, no other astronaut ever had to eject from the LLTV, and every Lunar Module pilot through the final Apollo 17 mission trained in the LLTV and flew to a landing on the Moon successfully.

In January 1971 LLTV-2 was destroyed while testing a major modification to the computer system. Its test pilot, Stuart Present, was able to eject safely. 

Gene Cernan piloted the surviving LLTV-3 vehicle on November 13, 1972, three weeks before Apollo 17. LLTV-3 (NASA 952) is now on display at the Johnson Space Center.

==Lunar Sim Mode ==

There were two distinct modes of flight for the LLRV and LLTV. The basic mode was with the engine fixed so that it remained &#x27;normal&#x27; with respect to the body.

In the gimbaled &quot;Lunar Sim Mode,&quot; the free-gimbaled turbofan engine was allowed to swivel and was kept pointing downward to Earth&#x27;s center of mass regardless of the LLRV&#x27;s attitude; this allowed the vehicle to tilt at the far greater angles that would be typical of hovering and maneuvering above the lunar surface. Despite its ungainly appearance, the LLRV was equipped with a highly sophisticated array of early sensors (mainly Doppler radar) and computational hardware. The system had no specific name, but the effect it produced was called &quot;Lunar Sim Mode.&quot; This was the highest degree of hardware-based simulation. It was not a system to unburden the pilot, as an autopilot does, nor was it meant to introduce any sort of safety or economy.

Lunar Sim Mode can also be thought of as a mixture of stability augmentation, recalculation of vertical acceleration according to the lunar gravity constant, all followed by accompanied instantaneous corrective action. The LLRV&#x27;s Lunar Sim Mode was even able to correct for wind gusts within milliseconds, as they would have disturbed the impression of a missing atmosphere.

FRC test pilot Don Mallick&#x27;s comments following the vehicle&#x27;s first flight in the lunar simulation mode illustrate the experience of piloting the LLRV:

Deke Slayton, then NASA&#x27;s Chief Astronaut, later said there was no way to simulate a Moon landing except by flying the LLRV.

==Specifications (LLRV)==

==Control system==

The electronic control system for the Lunar Landing Training Vehicle was developed for NASA by Bell Aerosystems, Inc. which had engineering facilities located in Niagara Falls, New York. The LLTV was a second generation vehicle, after the Lunar Landing Research Vehicle, used by NASA Apollo Program astronauts to develop piloting skills. The LLTV provided Apollo program commanders the opportunity to experience the flight characteristics associated with the 1/6 gravity conditions on the Moon. The first LLTV vehicle was assembled at Ellington Air Force Base in Houston, Texas in 1967. Three LLTV vehicles were eventually delivered to Ellington AFB. The last remaining of the three LLTV vehicles is on display at the Johnson Spacecraft Center in Houston, Texas.

The electronic control system was designed with redundant channels that used 2 of 2 logic. The outputs of each primary channel were compared on a continuous basis. If a fault was detected in the primary control system, then control was automatically switched to an identical backup channel and the pilot immediately took measures to bring the vehicle to the ground. All the controls were analog circuits utilizing Burr-Brown transistor amplifier modules and other analog components.

==Aircraft on display==

Two of the five vehicles survive:

<text>Holy water is water that has been blessed by a member of the clergy or a religious figure, or derived from a well or spring considered holy. The use for cleansing prior to a baptism and spiritual cleansing is common in several religions, from Christianity to Sikhism. The use of holy water as a sacramental for protection against evil is common among Lutherans, Anglicans, Catholics, and Eastern Christians.

== In Christianity ==

In Catholicism, Lutheranism, Anglicanism, Eastern Orthodoxy, Oriental Orthodoxy and some other churches, holy water is water that has been sanctified by a priest for the purpose of baptism, for the blessing of persons, places, and objects, or as a means of repelling evil.

=== History ===
The Apostolic Constitutions, whose texts date to , attribute the precept of using holy water to the Apostle Matthew. It is plausible that the earliest Christians may have used water for expiatory and purificatory purposes in a way analogous to its employment in Jewish Law (&quot;And he shall take holy water in an earthen vessel, and he shall cast a little earth of the pavement of the tabernacle into it&quot;, Numbers 5:17). Yet in many cases, the water used for the sacrament of Baptism was flowing water, sea- or river-water, which — in the view of the Catholic Church — could not receive the same blessing as that water contained in the baptisteries. However, Eastern Orthodox Christians do perform the same blessing, whether in a baptistery or for an outdoor body of water.

=== Use and storage ===

Sprinkling with holy water is used as a sacramental that recalls baptism. In the West, the blessing of the water is traditionally accompanied by exorcism and by the addition of exorcised and blessed salt.

Holy water is kept in the holy water font, which is typically located at the entrance to the church (or sometimes in a separate room or building called a baptistery). Smaller vessels, called stoups, are usually placed at the entrances of the church, to enable people to bless themselves with it on entering. 

In the Middle Ages Christians esteemed the power of holy water so highly that in some places fonts had locked covers to prevent the theft of holy water for unauthorized magic practices. The Constitutions of Archbishop Edmund Rich (1236) prescribe that: &quot;Fonts are to be kept under lock and key, because of witchcraft (&quot;sortilege&quot;). Similarly the chrism and sacred oil are kept locked up.&quot;
=== Proper disposal ===

In Catholicism, holy water, as well as the water used during the washing of the priest&#x27;s hands at Mass, is not allowed to be disposed of in regular plumbing. Roman Catholic churches will usually have a special basin (a ) that leads directly into the ground for the purpose of proper disposal. A hinged lid is kept over the holy water basin to distinguish it from a regular sink basin, which is often just beside it. Items that contained holy water are separated, drained of the holy water, and then washed in a regular manner in the adjacent sink.

=== Hygiene ===
Holy water fonts have been identified as a potential source of bacterial and viral infection. In the late-19th century, bacteriologists found staphylococci, streptococci, coli bacilli, Loeffler&#x27;s bacillus, and other bacteria in samples of holy water taken from a church in Sassari, Italy. In a study performed in 1995, 13 samples were taken when a burn patient acquired a bacterial infection after exposure to holy water. The samples in that study were shown to have a &quot;wide range of bacterial species&quot;, some of which could cause infection in humans. During the swine-flu epidemic of 2009, Bishop John Steinbock of Fresno, California, recommended that &quot;holy water should not be in the fonts&quot; for fear of spreading infections. Also in response to the swine flu, an automatic, motion-detecting holy-water dispenser was invented and installed in an Italian church in 2009. In 2020, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, Episcopal Conferences directed that holy water be removed from the fonts or stoups.

=== Christian traditions ===

==== Roman Catholics ====

===== Sacramental and sanctification =====

A blessing, as a prayer, is a sacramental. By blessing water, Catholic priests praise God and ask him for his grace. As a reminder of baptism, Catholic Christians dip their fingers in holy water and make the sign of the cross when entering a church.

Fr. John F. Sullivan, writing in the early twentieth century, noted that, &quot;Besides the pouring of baptismal water ... the sprinkling with holy water is a part of the ceremonies of Matrimony, of Extreme Unction and of the administration of the Holy Eucharist to the sick, and it is employed also in services for the dead.&quot;

The Sunday liturgy may begin with the Rite of Blessing and Sprinkling Holy Water, in which holy water is sprinkled upon the congregation; this is called &quot;aspersion&quot; (from the Latin, , &quot;to sprinkle&quot;). This ceremony dates back to the 9th century. An &quot;aspergill&quot; or aspergillum is a brush or branch used to sprinkle the water. An is the vessel which holds the holy water and into which the aspergillum is dipped, though elaborate Ottonian examples are known as . Blessed salt may be added to the water where it is customary to do so.

The Catholic Church teaches this use of holy water and making a sign of the cross when entering a church reflects a renewal of baptism, a cleansing of venial sin, as well as providing protection against evil. It is sometimes accompanied by the following prayer:

Some Catholics believe that water from specific shrines (such as Lourdes) can bring healing - although that water is not the same as typical holy water found in parishes, since it has not been blessed by a priest.

===== Formula =====
The traditional Latin formula for blessing the water is as follows:

A priest may choose from three other formulae found in the &quot;Book of Blessings&quot; for blessing water. They are to be accompanied by the priest blessing the water with the sign of the cross. They are as follows:

V. Blessed are you, Lord, all-powerful God, who in Christ, the living water of salvation, blessed and transformed us. Grant that when we are sprinkled with this water or make use of it, we will be refreshed inwardly by the power of the Holy Spirit and continue to walk in the new life we received at Baptism. We ask this though Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

V. Lord, holy Father, look with kindness on your children redeemed by your Son and born to a new life by water and the Holy Spirit. Grant that those who are sprinkled with this water may be renewed in body and spirit and may make a pure offering of their service to you. We ask this through Christ our Lord. R. Amen.

V. O God, the Creator of all things, by water and the Holy Spirit you have given the universe its beauty and fashioned us in your own image. R. Bless and purify your Church. V. O Christ the Lord, from your pierced side you gave us your sacraments as fountains of salvation. R. Bless and purify your Church. V. Priest: O Holy Spirit, giver of life, from the baptismal font of the Church you have formed us into a new creation in the waters of rebirth. R. Bless and purify your Church.

===== Protection against evil =====
In his book &quot;The Externals of the Catholic Church&quot;, originally published in 1917, Fr. John F. Sullivan writes:

The prayers said over the water are addressed to the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost, that through the power of the Blessed Trinity the spirits of evil may be utterly expelled from this world and lose all influence over mankind. Then God is besought to bless the water, that it may be effective in driving out devils and in curing diseases; that wherever it is sprinkled there may be freedom from pestilence and from the snares of Satan.

Catholic saints have written about the power of holy water as a force that repels evil. Saint Teresa of Avila (1515-1582), a Doctor of the Church who reported visions of Jesus and Mary, believed fervently in the power of holy water and stated that she used it with success to repel evil and temptations. She wrote:

The 20th-century nun and mystic Saint Faustina in her diary (paragraph 601) said she once sprinkled a dying sister with holy water to drive away demons. Although this was wrong to do, since it was the priest&#x27;s duty, she remarked, &quot;holy water is indeed of great help to the dying&quot;.

In &quot;Holy Water and Its Significance for Catholics,&quot; Cistercian priest Henry Theiler states that in addition to being a strong force in repelling evil, holy water has the twofold benefit of providing grace for both body and soul.

The new excludes the exorcism prayer on the water. Exorcised and blessed salt has traditionally been added to the holy water as well. Priests can continue to use the older form if they wish as confirmed by Pope Benedict XVI in , which states &quot;What earlier generations held as sacred, remains sacred and great for us too&quot;.

==== Eastern Christians ====


Among the Eastern Orthodox and the Byzantine Rite Catholics, holy water is used frequently in rites of blessing and exorcism, and the water for baptism is always sanctified with a special blessing.

There are two rites for blessing holy water: the &quot;Great Blessing of Waters&quot;, which is held on the Feast of Theophany and at baptisms, and the &quot;Lesser Blessing of Waters&quot; which is conducted according to need and local custom during the rest of the year, certain feast days calling for the Lesser Blessing of Waters as part of their liturgical observance. Both forms are based upon the Rite of Baptism. After the blessing of holy water the faithful are sprinkled with it and each drinks some of it.

Holy water is drunk by the faithful after it is blessed and it is a common custom for the pious to drink holy water every morning. In the monasteries of Mount Athos holy water is always drunk in conjunction with consuming antidoron. Eastern Orthodox do not typically bless themselves with holy water upon entering a church as Western Catholics do, but a quantity of holy water is often kept in a font placed in the narthex (entrance) of the church, available for anyone who would like to partake of it or to take some of it home.

After the annual Great Blessing of Waters at Theophany (also known as Epiphany), the priest goes to the homes of the faithful within his parish and, in predominantly Orthodox lands, to the buildings throughout town, and blesses them with holy water.

When blessing objects such as the palms on Palm Sunday, Paschal eggs and other foods for Easter, candles, or liturgical instruments and sacred vessels (at least in some traditions, such as in that of the Georgian Orthodox Church, icons and crosses must also be blessed, as they are not considered intrinsically holy and redeemed), the blessing is completed by a triple sprinkling with holy water using the words, &quot;This (&quot;name of item&quot;) is blessed by the sprinkling of this holy water, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&quot;

Throughout the centuries, members of the Orthodox Church have believed many springs of water to be miraculous. Some still flow, such as the one at Pochaev Lavra in Ukraine, and the Life-Giving Spring of the Theotokos in Constantinople (commemorated on Bright Friday).

==== Anglicans ====

Although &quot;Holy water&quot; is not a term used in official rites of the Church of England, font water is sanctified in the Church of England baptism rite. In contrast, the Episcopal Church (United States) does expressly mention the optional use of holy water in some recent liturgies of blessing. More generally, the use of water within High Church Anglicanism or Anglo-Catholicism adheres closely to Roman Catholic practice. In many Anglican churches baptismal water is used for the asperges. A widely-used Anglo-Catholic manual, &quot;Ritual Notes&quot;, first published by A. R. Mowbray in 1894, discusses the blessing and use of holy water. In addition to &quot;the pious custom&quot; of blessing oneself on entering and leaving a church &quot;in memory of our baptism and in token of the purity of heart with which we should worship Almighty God&quot;, the book commends that &quot;Holy water should be obtained from the parish priest, may be (and indeed should be) taken away and kept for use privately by the faithful in their homes.&quot; An English translation of the traditional rite for the blessing of water and salt, including the exorcisms, was included in the Anglican Missal. Shorter forms are found in &quot;A Priest&#x27;s Handbook&quot; by Dennis G. Michno, and &quot;Ceremonies of the Eucharist&quot; by Howard E. Galley. Some parishes use a stoup, basin, or font to make holy water available for the faithful to use in blessing themselves, making the sign of the cross upon entering the church.

In the &quot;Book of Occasional Services&quot; of the Episcopal Church (United States), in the rite for Restoring of Things Profaned, the bishop or priest while processing around the church or chapel recites Psalm 118 with the antiphon :

A rubric directs that as each profaned object is addressed, &quot;it may be symbolically cleansed by the use of signs of purification, such as water or incense.&quot;

==== Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church ====

Holy water is important to the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church and regarded as healing from demonic possession and for treating sick people, particularly in cases of mental illness. It can be consumed or poured over someone supposed to be afflicted by harmful things. A majority of studies show that many Ethiopians prefer holy water for biomedical purposes, especially for treatment of HIV/AIDS. Pilgrims visit different monasteries such as Tsadkane Mariam and Entoto Kidane Mehret to acquire holy water. 

Besides, holy water also used for Ethiopian Orthodox holidays such as Timkat (Epiphany) where Christians gather at notable squares and churches and priests bless holy water and spatter them. In Gondar, the Fasilides Bath is used to bathe and represents the Jordan River.

==== Lutherans ====

The use of holy water in some synods of Lutheranism is for the baptism of infants and new members of the church. The water is believed to be blessed by God, as it is used in a sacrament. The water is applied to the forehead of the laity being baptised and the minister performs the sign of the cross. Lutherans tend to have baptismal water fonts near the entrance of the church.

Other synods do not use holy water but do typically treat the water used for baptisms in a respectful manner.

==== Methodists ====
In the Methodist tradition, Holy Baptism is often administered by sprinkling or pouring holy water over the candidate. The official Baptismal Liturgy, as well as the liturgy for Reaffirmation of Baptism commonly done through asperges, has a prayer for the blessing of this water:

== Other religions ==
=== Sikhism ===

One of the holiest sites in Sikhism, Harmandir Sahib, is surrounded by a pool of water called &quot;amritsar&quot; or &quot;amritsarovar&quot;. For those who wish to take a dip in the pool, the Temple provides a half hexagonal shelter and holy steps to &quot;Har ki Pauri&quot;. Bathing in the pool is believed by many Sikhs to have restorative powers, purifying one&#x27;s karma. Some carry bottles of the pool water home particularly for sick friends and relatives. The pool is maintained by volunteers who perform &quot;kar seva&quot; (community service) by draining and desilting it periodically.

Sikhs use the Punjabi term &quot;amrita&quot; (ਅੰਮ੍ਰਿਤ) for the holy water used in the baptism ceremony known as &quot;Amrit Sanskar&quot; or &quot;Amrit Chhakhna&quot;.

=== Hinduism ===

The significance of water in Hinduism is described in the hymn called the mantra pushpam, present in the Taitiriya Aranyakam section of the text Yajurveda. Bathing in holy water is a key element in Hinduism, and the Ganges is considered the holiest Hindu river. Holy water in Hinduism is thought to purify the soul and combat evil. Some Hindus use holy water to wash hands before ringing a bell.

=== Buddhism ===
The idea of &quot;blessed water&quot; is used in virtually all Buddhist traditions. In the Theravada tradition, water is put into a new pot and kept near a &quot;Paritrana&quot; ceremony, a blessing for protection. This &quot;lustral water&quot; can be created in a ceremony in which the burning and extinction of a candle above the water represents the elements of earth, fire, and air. This water is later given to the people to be kept in their home. Not only water but also oil and strings are blessed in this ceremony. Most Mahayana Buddhists typically recite sutras or various mantras (typically that of the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara for example) numerous times over the water, which is then either consumed or is used to bless homes afterwards. In Vajrayana Buddhism, a &quot;Bumpa&quot;, a ritual object, is one of the &quot;Ashtamangala&quot;, used for storing sacred water sometimes, symbolizing wisdom and long life.

=== Islam ===
The Muslim variety of holy water is the Zamzam water that comes from a spring near the Kaaba in Mecca.

The drinking of &quot;healing water&quot; (&quot;āb-i shifā&quot;) is a practice in various denominations of Shia Islam. In the tradition of the Twelver Shi&#x27;a, many dissolve the dust of sacred locations such as Karbala (&quot;khāk-i shifa&quot;) and Najaf and drink the water (&quot;āb-i shifā&quot;) as a cure for illness, both spiritual and physical.

The Ismaili tradition involves the practice of drinking water blessed by the Imam of the time. This water is taken in the name of the Imam and has a deep spiritual significance. This is evident from the names used to designate the water, including light (&quot;nūr&quot;) and ambrosia (&quot;amṛt, amī, amīras, amījal&quot;). This practice is recorded from the 13th and 14th centuries and continues to the present day. The ceremony is known as &quot;ghat-pat&quot; in South Asia.

=== Mandaeism ===
In Mandaeism, mambuha (), sometimes spelled &quot;mambuga&quot;, is sacramental drinking water used in rituals such as the masbuta (baptism), while halalta () is sacramental rinsing water used in rituals such as the masiqta (death mass).

=== Others ===
In Ancient Greek religion, holy water called &quot;khernips&quot; () was created when a torch from a religious shrine was extinguished in it. In Greek religion, purifying people and locations with water was part of the process of distinguishing the sacred from the profane.

In Wicca and other ceremonial magic traditions, a bowl of salt is blessed and a small amount is stirred into a bowl of water that has been ritually purified. In some traditions of Wicca, this mixture of water and salt symbolizes the brine of the sea, which is regarded as the womb of the Goddess, and the source of all life on Earth. The mixture is consecrated and used in many religious ceremonies and magical rituals.

== Unofficial uses ==

Holy water has also been believed to ward off or act as a weapon against mythical evil creatures, such as vampires and werewolves. In eastern Europe, one might sprinkle holy water onto the corpse of a suspected vampire in order to destroy it or render it inert. Thereafter, the concept proliferated into fiction about such creatures.

<text>The Man from Delmonte are an independent band from Manchester, England, formed in the mid-1980s.

==History==
Band members included Mike West (vocals and acoustic guitar), Sheila Seal (bass), Martin Vincent (guitar and harmonica), and Howard Goody (drums).

The band members had little in common with most Manchester bands. Goody was a graduate of Winchester School of Art. Vincent had been an art critic and painter. Seal, a Glaswegian, was a classically trained musician who had run an art gallery. West, who wrote the songs, was the Australian-born son of the author Morris West.

The band played many gigs at the Boardwalk club, in Manchester, where they recorded their &quot;Big Noise&quot; live album in 1989.

They took their name from a series of 1980s television advertisements for Del Monte fruit juices, featuring the &quot;man from Del Monte&quot;. In these, the man would visit villages to sample their fruit juices, to see if they were good enough to be included in his company&#x27;s drinks. The tagline, shouted jubilantly by a villager on approval was, &quot;The man from Del Monte, he say &#x27;Yes!.

At one point they were managed by journalist Jon Ronson.

After they split up in 1990, some members continued as Surfurbia. West moved to New Orleans to pursue a solo career in the early 1990s.

The band are reforming to play gigs in the UK in February and April 2025.

<doc id="847365" wikidata="Q7748355" url="?curid=847365" title="The Longstones">
<text>The Longstones are two standing stones, one of which is the remains of a prehistoric &#x27;cove&#x27; of standing stones, at , close to Beckhampton in Avebury parish, in the English county of Wiltshire.

Two stones are visible, known as &#x27;Adam&#x27; and &#x27;Eve&#x27; although the latter is more likely to have been a stone that formed part of the Beckhampton Avenue that connected with Avebury. The avenue probably terminated here, although it may have extended further to the south-west beyond the stones. William Stukeley recorded the site in the 18th century when it was only partially destroyed, and suggested it extended further, although modern excavation and archaeological geophysics have not confirmed this.

Adam is the larger of the two stones, weighing an estimated 62 tons, and along with three others formed a four-sided cove. Excavations carried out jointly by the Universities of Leicester, Newport and Southampton in 2000 revealed the socket holes for the other stones which were tightly placed close to Adam. The cove had been open on its south-eastern side which faced towards the nearby South Street barrow, 130m away. The other stones were removed in the post-medieval period by a local landowner.

Adam fell over in 1911 and was re-erected by Maud Cunnington in 1912. She also found a Beaker inhumation of a middle-aged man buried close by the stone. In 1933 the stones were scheduled as an ancient monument.

<text>Gabalfa (, ) is a district and community in the north of the city of Cardiff, capital of Wales. It is characterised by a four-lane flyover road at the Gabalfa Interchange, where the A48 road meets the A470 road (North Road) which leads from Cardiff to northern Wales, and the A469 road (Caerphilly Road).

The name is derived from the Welsh , literally translated as &#x27;place of the boat&#x27;. It was formerly the site of a ferry crossing across the River Taff, upon which a school is now built. The area was first heavily developed in the 1880s, with most of the characteristic terraced housing originating from the next 30 years of construction.

The area around St. Joseph&#x27;s Church near to Companies House is known as &#x27;the Colonies&#x27; due to a number of streets named after former British colonies, including Australia Road and Newfoundland Road.

== Education ==
=== Primary ===
Gabalfa has three primary schools, with a combined attendance of more than 720:

* St. Joseph&#x27;s (Roman Catholic) Primary School
* Allensbank Primary School
* Ysgol Mynydd Bychan (&#x27;Heath School&#x27; in Welsh), which teaches in the Welsh medium

Gabalfa Primary School is not within modern Gabalfa but in neighbouring Llandaff North.

=== High School ===
Gabalfa has one comprehensive school, Cathays High School, with around 900 students (mainly from outside Gabalfa).

=== University ===
Gabalfa has a high student population. There are several halls of residence for Cardiff University in the area, housing about 3,100 students, some 10% of the student body. Liberty House serves mainly medical and nursing students at the nearly University Hospital of Wales. In addition, many students live in privately rented accommodation in the area.

==Places of worship==

Churches in Gabalfa include St Mark&#x27;s on North Road (Church in Wales), St Joseph&#x27;s on New Zealand Road (Roman Catholic), and the All Nations Church on Eastern Avenue (Ministries Without Borders, co-located with the All Nations Centre).

==Politics==

The electoral ward of Gabalfa lies within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff North, which has been represented since 2017 by Welsh Labour MP Anna McMorrin. In the Senedd, Cardiff North is represented by Welsh Labour MS Julie Morgan.

There is no community council for the area.

Gabalfa was served by two Cardiff councillors: Ed Bridges (Liberal Democrat), elected in 2004, and Gareth Holden, elected in 2012. Holden was elected as a Liberal Democrat but resigned from the party in 2013. He lost to a Liberal Democrat candidate in the May 2017 election. The ward is currently served by Rhys Taylor and Ashley Wood (2019).

Gabalfa is bounded by Birchgrove and Heath to the north, Cathays and Maindy to the south, and Llandaff North to the northwest.

==Transport==
The area is known for the Gabalfa Interchange (or Gabalfa flyover), where the A48 Eastern Avenue, A470 North Road, and A469 Whitchurch Road (south)/Caerphilly Road (north) meet. The interchange is known for its suicides and suicide attempts, although efforts have been made to improve this, with signs to suicide prevention charities now clearly visible on the pedestrian bridge over Eastern Avenue.

=== Bus ===
Cardiff Bus&#x27; service 35 bus circles the area before heading to Cardiff Bay via Cathays and Central station. Services 1/2 &quot;Bay Circle&quot; run along Western Avenue towards Heath or Llandaff. Additionally, the following services stop at the Gabalfa Interchange:

*8 (University Hospital of Wales) or (Cathays-Roath-Central Station-Grangetown-Cardiff Bay)
*9 (University Hospital of Wales) or (International Sports Village)
*21 (Rhiwbina-Coryton-Whitchurch) or (Central Stn)
*23 (Whitchurch-Coryton-Rhiwbina) or (Central Stn)
*24 (Whitchurch-Llandaff North-Pontcanna-Llandaff)
*25 (Central Stn)
*27 Capital City Green (Heath-Birchgrove-Thornhill) or (Central Stn)
*35 (Gabalfa) or (Cathays-Central Stn-Cardiff Bay)

=== Rail ===
There are no railway stations located within Gabalfa, although a new railway station serving the ward was proposed by the County Council in 2000. The nearest railway stations are Heath Low Level and Heath High Level to the north-west, Cathays to the south and Llandaf to the north-east.

=== Walking and cycling ===
The Taff Trail, a long-distance footpath and cycle route that runs along the River Taff, is connected to Gabalfa by Llys Tal-y-Bont Road.

In 2023, a new cycle path was completed along Allensbank Road on the edge of Gabalfa, as part of Cardiff&#x27;s Cycleway 1. To promote cycling and improve safety, in recent years councillors and residents have campaigned with some success for traffic calming measures, such as Gabalfa becoming a zone, raised crossings being installed, and curbs being narrowed.

Gabalfa is within a 30-minute walk or a 10-minute cycle of the city centre.

<text>Mynachdy () is a district of the city of Cardiff, Wales. Mynachdy is situated between Gabalfa, Birchgrove and Cathays. Mynachdy is often paired with neighbouring Gabalfa, and shares its councillors. It is close to a few universities such as Cardiff University and the Royal Welsh College of Music &amp; Drama, as well as student accommodation.

== Name ==
The word &quot;mynachdy&quot; comes from the Welsh words &quot;mynach&quot; (monk) and &quot;tŷ&quot; (house). This probably refers to Llys Talybont, a manor building in the modern area of Mynachdy that was owned by the monks of Llantarnam Abbey.

== Mynachdy Institute ==
The Mynachdy Institute is a community centre in Mynachdy. There have been many threats of closure, with plans to replace it with student flats. However, after its initial closure, a successful community movement regained control of the Institute from Cardiff Council.

== Transport ==
The A470 North Road runs along Mynachdy&#x27;s northeast side.

Mynachdy is bordered on its southwest side by a local railway line. There are plans under consideration to build the Gabalfa railway station on this line to serve Mynachdy and neighbouring Gabalfa.

<doc id="847376" wikidata="Q454577" url="?curid=847376" title="Oldřich, Duke of Bohemia">
<text>Oldřich (; ; – 9 November 1034 or 1042), a member of the Přemyslid dynasty, was Duke of Bohemia from 1012 to 1033 and briefly again in 1034. His accession to the Bohemian throne marked the start of a phase of stability after a long period of internal dynastic struggles. Under his rule, the Moravian lands were reconquered from Polish occupation.

== Life ==
Oldřich was the fourth (third surviving) son of Duke Boleslaus II of Bohemia (d. 999). Like all his father&#x27;s children, his mother was Adiva. Upon the death of his father, his eldest brother Boleslaus III succeeded as duke, however, he soon entered into a fierce conflict with his younger brothers Oldřich and Jaromír. In 1001, both had to flee to the Bavarian court at Regensburg. When Boleslaus III was deposed by the rival Vršovci dynasty the next year and the Polish ruler Bolesław I the Brave invaded Bohemia, King Henry II of Germany intervened. As a part of Henry&#x27;s expedition to Prague, Boleslaus&#x27;s brothers were able to return to Bohemia, and Jaromír was installed as Bohemian duke in 1004. 

In the German–Polish War of 1002–18, Duke Jaromír remained a loyal supporter of the German king. Nevertheless, Henry did not take action when he was deposed and blinded by his brother Oldřich on 12 April 1012. While Jaromír fled to Poland, Oldřich recognised the sovereignty of the German king. He secured his rule by suppressing the Vršovci insurgents.

Oldřich and his son Bretislaus sought to win back Moravia, once conquered from the Poles by Oldřich&#x27;s grandfather Duke Boleslaus I. Bretislaus and his wife Judith of Schweinfurt took up residence in Olomouc. In 1029, the Bohemian forces, backed by Holy Roman Emperor Conrad II, finally drove the Poles out of the eastern lands. However, Bretislaus&#x27;s efforts to occupy adjacent territories in what is today Slovakia by marching against the forces of the Kingdom of Hungary failed in 1030 due to the jealousy of the emperor, who reached an agreement with King Stephen I. In the following year, Bohemian forces refused to take the field for the emperor.

In 1032, Duke Oldřich was invited to the &quot;Hoftag&quot; diet at Merseburg, but did not appear. His absence raised the ire of the emperor and Conrad, busy with events in Burgundy, charged his son Henry III with punishing the recalcitrant Bohemian. Oldřich was arrested, deposed and sent to Bavaria. He was again replaced by his brother Jaromír. However, when Oldřich was pardoned the next year, he returned to Bohemia and had Jaromír captured and deposed. He seized power again and drove out Jaromír&#x27;s son from Moravia.

Oldřich died abruptly on 9 November 1034 and later examination of his skeleton reveal his skull to have suffered a fatal blow. Jaromír then renounced the throne in favour of his nephew Bretislaus.

==Marriage and children==

According to legend rendered by the medieval chronicler Cosmas of Prague, Duke Oldřich about 1002 married a Božena, daughter of Křesina, after discarding his first wife on the grounds that they were childless. Together they had a son:
*Bretislaus I (1002/1005–1055), Duke of Bohemia from 1035 until his death

<doc id="847378" wikidata="Q1370584" url="?curid=847378" title="Ma Perkins">
<text>Ma Perkins (sometimes called Oxydol&#x27;s Own Ma Perkins) is an American radio soap opera that was heard on NBC from 1933 to 1949 and on CBS from 1942 to 1960. It was also broadcast in Canada, and Radio Luxembourg carried it in Europe. 

The program began on WLW in Cincinnati, Ohio, where it was broadcast from August 14, 1933 to December 1, 1933. Its network debut occurred on NBC on December 4, 1933. Between 1942 and 1949, the show was heard simultaneously on both networks. During part of its run on NBC, that network&#x27;s coverage was augmented by use of transcriptions. Beginning April 1, 1935, nine stations broadcast the transcriptions. Oxydol dropped its sponsorship in 1956.
The program continued with various sponsors until 1960.

The series was produced by Frank and Anne Hummert with scripts by Robert Hardy Andrews, Orin Tovrov, and others. (An early scriptwriter was Chicago-based Richard Durham, who was likely the only Negro writing for the radio industry.) &quot;Ma Perkins&quot; began August 14, 1933, on WLW in Cincinnati. On December 4 of that year, it graduated to the NBC Red network. On NBC and CBS the series ran for a total of 7,065 episodes.

&quot;America’s mother of the air&quot; was portrayed by actress Virginia Payne, who began the role at the age of 19 and never missed a performance during the program&#x27;s 27-year run. Kindly, trusting widow Ma Perkins had a big heart and a great love of humanity. She always offered her homespun philosophy to troubled souls in need of advice.

&quot;Ma Perkins&quot; is widely credited with giving birth to storytelling and content-based advertising.

==Characters and story==
Ma owned and operated a lumber yard in the town of Rushville Center (population 4000), where the plotlines pivoted around her interactions with the local townsfolk and the ongoing dilemmas of her three children, Evey, Fay and John. John Perkins died during World War II. Ma&#x27;s daughter Fay was played by Marjorie Hannan, Isabelle Krehbiel and Rita Ascot. Gilbert Faust had the role of John. Evey Perkins was played by Lillian White, Dora Johnson, Laurette Fillbrandt and Kay Campbell, who later became known for playing Grandma Kate Martin on the television soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot;. Shuffle Shober, Ma&#x27;s best friend, was played by Charles Egelston (and later Edwin Wolfe). Murray Forbes was heard as Willie Fitz, and Cecil Roy portrayed Junior Fitz.

In &quot;Sounds from the Past,&quot; Chris Plunkett offered an overview of the series:
:Typical of Hummert productions, Ma Perkins had her share of tears, crises, and drama, but with a plotline much slower paced than the average soap opera. In a typical year, no more than three or four major complications were covered --interspersed by long &quot;quiet spells,&quot; filled with (brutally) protracted discussions on the meaning of life amid the ever-changing tapestry of family, friends and the small town around them... Early in the drama’s run Ma was portrayed as quite combative and spiteful, but her character soon developed (and softened) into the kindhearted sage and conscience of the entire community. There were various dramas that unfolded over the years, some more far-fetched than others. Two of the more memorable plot stretches involve Ma exposing a black market baby-napping ring, and Ma harboring Soviet political dissidents inside her home.

When the show ended on Friday, November 25, 1960, the day after Thanksgiving Day, it was one of only eight entertainment shows still on the CBS radio network. The last episode was the only one in which Virginia Payne&#x27;s name was mentioned, by Payne herself in a farewell speech. In all other episodes, the announcer at the close of the show would run down the names of all the actors in the cast (but one), and then say, &quot;... and Ma Perkins.&quot;

<text>The San Francisco Spiders were a professional ice hockey team based in Daly City, California. They were members of the South Division of the former International Hockey League (IHL). Playing at the Cow Palace, the Spiders competed for one season, folding at the close of the 1995–96 IHL season.

==History==
On November 22, 1994, the IHL announced an expansion franchise had been awarded to the Bay Area to begin play for the 1995–96 season at the Cow Palace. The former president and chief executive officer of the Jackson National Life Insurance Company Dave Pasant was the owner and paid the $6 million franchise fee to the IHL in becoming the league&#x27;s 18th team. By December, the Spiders nickname and logo were unveiled. Spiders was selected over Seals, Quakes, Fog and Rush and at the time of its establishment was the lone professional sports team with the Spiders nickname. Jean Perron served as both the general manager and head coach and was assisted by Bruce Boudreau who later became the head coach of the Washington Capitals, Anaheim Ducks, Minnesota Wild and Vancouver Canucks. The inaugural game was a 5–1 loss to the Los Angeles Ice Dogs before 11,415 fans on September 29, 1995.

For the one season, the Spiders roster took on a familiar look to the Cow Palace&#x27;s previous hockey tenant, the San Jose Sharks. Dale Craigwell, Link Gaetz, Robin Bawa, David Maley, Ed Courtenay and Mike Lalor all played for the IHL expansion team. The most notable NHL player who played briefly for the Spiders was Sandis Ozolinsh. Ozolinsh, who was holding out for a new contract from the Sharks, played two games with the Spiders. He scored one goal, the first goal in team history, shortly before the NHL&#x27;s San Jose Sharks traded him to the Colorado Avalanche.

The team finished in third place in the South division, winning 40 games and losing only 32. The Spiders lost 3–1 in the first round of the playoffs to the Chicago Wolves. Goalie Stephane Beauregard won the James Gatschene Memorial Trophy as league MVP for the season.

The Spiders&#x27; mascot, Spinner, was widely known as &quot;the hardest working mascot in sports.&quot; Spinner was often lowered from the arena rafters by a rope, once being unable to free himself and covering by dancing in place until arena staff freed him.

Poor attendance and difficulties with the arena caused the team to suspend operations. On weekends, attendance tended to be respectable, around the 7–8,000 mark, but on weekdays, the Spiders often struggled to draw more than 2,500 in averaging 5,024 fans for each home game. The team filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in May 1996 in citing losses of $6 million for the season, and would officially cease operations on June 24, 1996. Most of the players were traded away to other IHL teams for &quot;future considerations.&quot; The Kansas City Blades received eight players from the Spiders. The team was scheduled to move to Victoria, British Columbia in 2000, but this move never happened due to failure to replace the aging Victoria Memorial Arena.

<doc id="847382" wikidata="Q5199901" url="?curid=847382" title="Cyncoed">
<text>Cyncoed ( ) is a community in the northeast of Cardiff, the capital of Wales. With many properties in the area fetching over £1 million, Cyncoed is considered to have some of the highest property prices in the country. Cyncoed overlooks the city centre of Cardiff, near Roath Park, with views of the surrounding mountains.

==Background and development==
In 1887 John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute offered of marshland to Cardiff Council, for use as a public park. In 1894, Roath Park was officially opened to the public. Work initially focused on creating the lake from an area of marshland. In 1915 a lighthouse was constructed in the lake containing a scale model of the &#x27;Terra Nova&#x27; ship to commemorate Captain Scott&#x27;s ill-fated voyage to the Antarctic from Cardiff in 1910. The park&#x27;s atmosphere today still retains the Victorian elegance and has Conservation Area status.

In 1914, the council built Cefn Coed Road, which ran past the original (18th century, and still standing to this day), farmhouse, which allowed small builders to develop houses for coal merchants and exports who worked at the Coal Exchange.

Post World War I developers bought the farmland as Cardiff expanded rapidly, with high quality detached housing being built to access Cardiff Golf Club, which occupied land to the north, and The Cyncoed Tennis Club.

During World War II there was a US Army in the area. Post the war, in the 1950s this area was redeveloped as housing demand grew, and the rural nature of Cyncoed vanished forever, including the development of the Lakeside estate, centered on Celyn Avenue.

As of February 2022, Cyncoed had an average property price of £475,126. 

==Description==

Some of the older and larger properties have been demolished and replaced by smaller homes and supplemented with smaller semi-detached infill. Modern housing estates now surround the area. The surrounding communities are:

Features include a small shopping village, a number of churches, and a synagogue because there is a sizable Jewish community living in Cyncoed. Cyncoed Medical Centre is actually just within neighbouring Pontprennau, on the road junction Cyncoed, Pontprennau and Pentwyn, to enable it to serve all three communities.

Between Cyncoed and Llanishen lie two defunct reservoirs. The company which owned this site, Western Power Distribution, intended to build houses on Llanishen Reservoir. Local residents campaigned for 15 years to stop the development. Eventually the reservoirs were sold to the steelworks and put back to their intended purpose of steelmaking. The reservoirs have recently been devolved back to the Welsh Water authority which, after draining and structural inspection, intends to return both to public amenity use.

==Education==

Primary schools and secondary schools provide local education. Rhydypenau Primary School serves most of Cyncoed and is considered one of the best Primary Schools in Cardiff. There is also Lakeside Primary School which was built on Ontario Way, and Cardiff High School (used to be called &#x27;Ty Celyn&#x27;) which serves a large proportion of Cardiff&#x27;s teenagers. It was built on the site of Celyn Farm, located towards Roath Park. There are campuses of Cardiff Metropolitan University and a Cardiff University hall of residence also in the vicinity.

As well as a modern hall of residence for Cardiff University, in 1961 the Cardiff College of Education providing teacher training opened. Various courses are now taught on the Cyncoed campus of Cardiff Metropolitan University, but it is most famous for its physical education department which has produced various sportspeople from its students, including: Dai Davies; Lynn Davies; Gareth Edwards; Clive Griffiths; Greg Thomas; Steve Watkin. As well as top football team Cardiff Metropolitan University F.C. who compete in the Welsh Premier League.

==Rhydypennau library==

Rhydypennau Library () is situated near Cardiff High School. Refurbished in 2006–2007, modifications to the entrance included installing automatic doors and replacing existing ramps. New windows were also fitted and fascia boards were replaced. Accessible facilities for disabled people were introduced.

There are 4 PCs with free public Internet access and 1 PC in the children&#x27;s section. Storytime for pre-school children followed by craft activities, and rhymetime for babies and toddlers are organised by the library.

==Electoral ward==

Cyncoed is both an electoral ward, and a community without a community council in Cardiff. The electoral ward is within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff Central. It is bounded by Llanishen to the northwest; Lisvane to the north; Pentwyn to the east; Penylan and Plasnewydd to the south; and Heath to the west. It is represented by three councillors on Cardiff Council. There have been three Liberal Democrat Councillors since the early 1990s with the sole exception of between 2017 and 2022 when there were two Liberal Democrats and one Conservative Councillor.

==Transport==
Cyncoed is served by Cardiff Bus services 28, 28A, 28B, 51, 52 and 53 to and from the city centre. Heath High Level and Heath Low Level railway stations are 0.6 miles southwest.

Cyncoed Road runs through Cyncoed, served by Cardiff Bus routes 51 and 53 connect the outer suburbs to the inner city with links to Lakeside, Roath and the city centre. The 28, 28A and 28B continues to Llanishen and Thornhill. Some western parts of the area have access to Heath Low Level railway station, with services northbound to Coryton on the City Line. Heath High Level station is nearby, on the Rhymney Line with services northbound to Rhymney via Lisvane &amp; Thornhill and Caerphily. Both lines have services southbound to Cardiff Queen Street and Cardiff Central railway station.

Celyn Avenue leads west to Heath and Cyncoed Road leads north to Pontprennau and south to Cathays, the city centre, Roath and Penylan.

==Notable residents==
* The poet Gillian Clarke lived there for many years.

<doc id="847388" wikidata="Q366328" url="?curid=847388" title="Brunetto Latini">
<text>Brunetto Latini (who signed his name &quot;Burnectus Latinus&quot; in Latin and &quot;Burnecto Latino&quot; in Italian; –1294) was an Italian philosopher, scholar, notary, politician and statesman. He was a teacher and friend of Dante Alighieri.

==Life==
Brunetto Latini was born in Florence in 1220 to a Tuscan noble family, the son of Buonaccorso Latini. He belonged to the Guelph party. He was a notary and a man of learning, much respected by his fellow citizens and famed for his skill as an orator. He expounded the writings of Cicero as guidance in public affairs.

He was of sufficient stature to be sent to Seville on an embassy to Alfonso X of Castile to seek help for Florence against the Sienese; the mission was unsuccessful. On his return from Spain, travelling along the Pass of Roncesvalles, he describes meeting a student from Bologna astride a bay mule, who told him of the defeat of the Guelphs at the Battle of Montaperti. As a result, Latini was exiled from his native city. He took refuge in France from 1261 to 1268 while working as a notary in Montpellier, Arras, Bar-sur-Aube, and Paris.

In 1269, when the political situation allowed, he returned to Tuscany and for some twenty years held successive high offices. In 1273 he was appointed as Secretary to the Council of the Republic of Florence. In 1280, he contributed to the temporary reconciliation between the Guelph and Ghibelline parties, and in 1284 presided over the conference in which an attack on Pisa was agreed. Finally, in 1287, he was elevated to the dignity of &quot;prior&quot; as one of 12 magistrates established through the constitution of 1282.

Giovanni Villani says that &quot;he was a great philosopher and a consummate master of rhetoric, not only in knowing how to speak well, but how to write well&quot;. He was the author of various works in prose and verse. He died in 1294, leaving behind a daughter, Bianca Latini, who had married Guido Di Filippo De&#x27; Castiglionchi in 1284. His tomb can be found in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore, Florence, to the left of the high altar.

==Works==

While in France, he wrote his Italian &quot;Tesoretto&quot; and in French his prose &quot;Li Livres dou Trésor&quot;, both summaries of the encyclopaedic knowledge of the day. The latter is regarded as the first encyclopedia in a modern European language. The Italian 13th-century translation known as &quot;Tesoro&quot; was misattributed to . He also translated into Italian the &quot;Rettorica&quot; and three &quot;Orations&quot; by Cicero. The Italian translation of Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Nicomachean Ethics&quot; is often misattributed to Brunetto Latini: it is a work of Taddeo Alderotti instead.

==The &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;==
Latini was Dante&#x27;s guardian after the death of his father. Early Dante commentators spoke of Brunetto as his teacher, as does Dante himself. Vittorio Imbriani took issue with that concept, saying Brunetto was far too busy a man to have been a mere teacher. Dante immortalized him in the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; (see &quot;Inferno&quot;, XV. 22–87). It is also believed that there was an intellectual and affectionate bond between the elderly man and the young poet. It was perhaps Latini who induced Dante to read Cicero and Boethius, after the death of Beatrice.

Many of the characters in Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; are also mentioned in the legal and diplomatic documents Brunetto Latini wrote in Latin. There is a portrait of Latini in the &quot;Bargello&quot; in Florence, once reputed to be by Giotto, next but one to the side of Dante (between them is Corso Donati). In a wood engraving, Gustave Doré envisages the same scene from Inferno XV, 1861.

===Canto XV===
Dante places Latini within the third ring of the Seventh Circle, the Circle of the Violent against God, nature and art, with the blasphemers, sodomites, and usurers. Dante writes of the &quot;clerks and great and famous scholars, defiled in the world by one and the same sin&quot;.

Dante&#x27;s treatment of Latini, however, is commendatory beyond almost any other figure in the &#x27;Inferno&#x27;. He calls the poet &quot;a radiance among men and speaks with gratitude of that sweet image, gentle and paternal, / you were to me in the world when hour by hour / you taught me how man makes himself eternal&quot;. Dante addresses Latini with the respectful pronoun &quot;voi&quot;; Latini uses the informal &quot;tu&quot;, as perhaps was their custom when they spoke together in Florence. The portrait is drawn with love, pathos and a dignity that is more compelling given the squalor of the punishment.

Latini asks first, humbly, if he may keep Dante company, letting his group run on. Dante offers to sit down with him but that would only increase Latini&#x27;s penalty; he and the other souls are doomed to keep moving aimlessly around the arena.

Latini proceeds in obscure imagery to foretell Dante&#x27;s future. The malicious ingrates who of old descended from &quot;Fiesole&quot; will be his enemies. They are reputed blind, avaricious, envious and proud. Let him beware, he warns, not to be stained by them. Mark Musa suggests that in this speech between the two there is sexual imagery indicative of the act of sodomy.

According to John D. Sinclair, Dante respected Latini immensely but nonetheless felt it necessary to place him with the sodomites since, according to Sinclair, such behaviour by Latini was well known in Florence at the time. The squalor of Latini&#x27;s sin and penalty is nevertheless painful for Dante to visualize.

Other critics point to the fact that, outside of &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;, there are no firm historical records suggesting Latini was accused of sodomy or homosexual relations—and indeed he seemingly condemns it himself in the &quot;Tesoretto&quot;. Some therefore have suggested that Latini is placed in Canto XV for being violent against art and against his vernacular (Latini wrote in French instead of Florentine, which Dante championed as a literary language in De Vulgari Eloquentia). Yet, Latini started working in the treatise in 1260, before Dante was born, and thus in a very different cultural climate, when French was the language of aristocracy. Perhaps Latini is there to demonstrate and underline that even the greatest of men may be guilty of private sins. Neither objection rules out the possibility that he was guilty of the perceived sin himself; and given the setting and context, it is difficult to see that there can be any doubt, particularly following the discovery in recent years of a love poem, &quot;S&#x27;eo son distretto inamoratamente&quot; which Latini sent to another poet, Bondie Dietaiuti, who replied with another love poem.

<text>Trowbridge is a district, community and coterminous electoral ward on the eastern edge of the city of Cardiff, capital of Wales.

The community and electoral ward includes some or all of the areas of the St Mellons estate and Trowbridge, as well as part of the Wentlooge Levels between the mainline railway and the coast. It is bounded by the village of Old St Mellons to the north; Marshfield (in Newport principal area) to the east; and Splott and Rumney to the west.

==History==
Trowbridge largely dates from the second half of the 20th century, when housing spread east from Rumney onto the farmland of the area.

Until 1938, the area was part of the civil parish of Rumney, in the historic county of Monmouthshire.

==Governance==
Trowbridge is both an electoral ward, and a community of the City of Cardiff. There is no community council for the area. Trowbridge was in the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff South &amp; Penarth until the 2024 UK general election, subsequently it became part of the new Cardiff East constituency. It remains in the Cardiff South and Penarth Senedd constituency until 2026.

The Trowbridge electoral ward is represented by four councillors on Cardiff Council. At the Cardiff Council election on 4 May 2017 the ward elected three Labour Party councillors and one Liberal Democrat. Prior to this Trowbridge elected Labour councillors, with the exception of 2004 when a Liberal Democrat won a seat.

==Schools==
Trowbridge Primary School.

St John Lloyd primary school.

==Places of interest==
*Caldicot and Wentloog Levels
*Hendre Lake Park
*Crosbie&#x27;s Pond

==Waste incinerator proposal==
In 2019, plans for a new £150m waste incinerator plant was proposed by Mor Hafren Bio Power, off Newlands Road in Wentloog, Trowbridge. The facility would burn up to 200,000 tonnes of waste each year, while also generating 15 Megawatts of electricity. It would be only 3 miles from the Viridor plant in Splott. A campaign group was set up by Trowbridge residents and anti-incinerator campaigners.

A final decision on whether the Mor Hafren facility can proceed was expected in 2020.

<text>Ernst Hermann August Theodor Busse (15 December 1897 – 21 October 1986) was a German officer during World War I and World War II.

== Early life and career ==
Busse, a native of Frankfurt (Oder), joined the Imperial German Army as an officer cadet in 1915 and was commissioned in February 1917. He also won the Knight&#x27;s Cross with Swords of the Hohenzollern Order. After the armistice, he was accepted as one of 2,000 officers into the new Reichswehr in which he steadily rose in rank.

==World War II==
Busse was a General Staff officer in April 1939 and prepared a training program that was approved by the Chief of the General Staff in August and covered a period from 1 October 1939 to 30 September 1940. Between 1940 and 1942, he served as the Chief of Operations to General (later Field Marshal) Erich von Manstein in the 11th Army on the Eastern Front. He remained serving on von Manstein&#x27;s staff from 1942 to 1943 as Chief of Operations of Army Group Don and then from 1943 to 1944 he was Chief of Staff of Army Group South, both on the Eastern Front. Serving with Army Group South, he was awarded the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross on 30 January 1944. He spent a short time in reserve and was then appointed General Officer Commanding German 121st Infantry Division. In July 1944, he commanded I Army Corps.

While Busse took command of the 9th Army on 21 January 1945, his appointment was never confirmed. It would appear that it was customary for commanders of formations of the status of an Army and higher to be on six months probation before their final appointments as Commanders-in-Chief. Germany surrendered unconditionally before Busse&#x27;s probationary period had expired.

During the last five months of the war, Busse commanded the 9th Army, which had become part of Army Group Vistula. As the Soviets continued to advance into Germany, he fought to protect the German capital. Specifically, Busse commanded the 9th Army during the Battle of Seelow Heights and the Battle of the Oder-Neisse. In April 1945, during the Battle of Berlin, Busse&#x27;s Ninth Army was cut off from the armies on its flanks and almost encircled by Soviet Forces. General Gotthard Heinrici tried to convince Busse to withdraw several times, but Busse refused even to consider withdrawal unless a specific command arrived from the Führer. Eventually Busse&#x27;s Ninth Army was driven into a pocket in the Spree Forest south of the Seelow Heights and west of Frankfurt, where it became fully encircled by two prongs of the massive Soviet assault on Berlin. In the ever-shrinking pocket, Busse&#x27;s forces were all but annihilated in what is known as the Battle of Halbe, but remnants ultimately managed to break through to the west to link up with General Walther Wenck’s 12th Army south of Beelitz and then to withdraw west to the Elbe, cross the partially-destroyed bridge at Tangermünde and surrender to American forces between May 4 and 7.

==Postwar==
Between 1945 and 1947, Busse was a prisoner-of-war. After the war Busse was West Germany&#x27;s director of civil defense, and he wrote and edited a number of works on the military history of World War II.

==Awards and decorations==

* Ehrenkreuz für Frontkämpfer on the 5th of December 1934

* Clasp to the Iron Cross
* 2nd Class on 27 May 1940
* 1st Class on 30 May 1940

<doc id="847398" wikidata="Q170037" url="?curid=847398" title="Balsamic vinegar">
<text>Balsamic vinegar () is a dark, concentrated, intensely flavoured vinegar made wholly or partially from grape must: freshly crushed grape juice with all the skins, seeds, and stems.

==Etymology==
The Italian word (from Latin , from Greek , ) means &#x27;balsam-like&#x27; in the sense of &quot;restorative&quot; or &quot;curative&quot;; cf. English &#x27;balm&#x27;. Ultimately from Ancient Hebrew-Phoenician ( or , IPA [baːˈɬaːm]), the name means &#x27;perfume or spice&#x27;, with the consonant sequence of the letter &#x27;λ&#x27; and &#x27;σ&#x27; deriving from Ancient Greek to pronounce the שׂ (ś) sound, sounding back then as [ɬ].

==History==
The term &quot;balsamico&quot; in &quot;balsamic vinegar&quot; originates from the Latin word &quot;balsamum&quot; and the Greek word &quot;βάλσαμον&quot;, both conveying the idea of something &quot;restorative&quot; or &quot;curative&quot;. The practice of cooking grape can be traced back to ancient Roman times, where it was valued both as a medicinal remedy and a sweetener or condiment in cooking. The story of balsamic vinegar began in the 11th century in the city of Modena; by 1046, it was already gaining a wider reputation. The future Holy Roman Emperor, King Henry III, requested Marquis Bonifacio of Canossa to craft a high quality vinegar in his castle. By the late 1200s, vinegar production flourished at the Este Court in Modena, with the term &quot;balsamic&quot; first recorded in 1747 in the ledgers of the Este family cellars.

In the second half of the 19th century, the provinces of Emilia joined the newly formed Kingdom of Italy, and balsamic vinegar of Modena was promoted at national and international exhibitions. While aristocratic families cultivated a refined balsamic tradition, local peasant families began to blend it with wine vinegar, creating a lighter version for everyday use.

This practice eventually led to the creation of Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PGI and widespread distribution across the world. Historically, in the area of Modena and Reggio, the vinegars produced in the houses were made more pleasant by flavouring them with herbs, liquorice, rosemary, roses, vanilla, or by producing them with different raw materials (trebbiano, moscato...) or procedures, creating over the centuries a widespread fame for &quot;Modena-style vinegars&quot;.

In 1747, in the registers of the cellars of the Ducal Palace of Modena, located in Rubiera, the adjective &quot;balsamic&quot; appeared for the first time, to distinguish a particular type from the many others present in the palace. In 1830 this definition was further refined, so that the vinegars present at the Court were divided into &quot;balsamic&quot;, &quot;semi-balsamic&quot;, &quot;fine&quot;, and &quot;common&quot;.

With the birth of the Italian State in 1860, the awakening of the markets gradually aroused more interest in balsamic vinegar, and considerable historical and bibliographical research was carried out on this product. At the end of the 19th century, the balsamic vinegar of Modena began to appear at exhibitions, creating great interest locally and internationally.

From a regulatory point of view, the first ministerial authorization to produce &quot;balsamic vinegar of Modena&quot; dates back to 1933. After World War II, the economic boom led some producers, such as Telesforo Fini and the Monari-Federzoni family, to market a different product under the name &quot;balsamic vinegar&quot;, which was a mix with wine vinegar for daily use. This made balsamic vinegar common on Italian tables and began its spread to foreign countries.

In 1965, further regulations on the use of the term &quot;balsamic vinegar&quot; were established, and the first production regulations for &quot;balsamic vinegar of Modena&quot; were created. In 1976, to distinguish traditional production methods from industrial ones, the term &quot;natural&quot; balsamic vinegar was adopted, later changed to &quot;traditional&quot; due to legislative requirements.

==Protected designation of origin==
The term &quot;aceto balsamico&quot; is unregulated, but there are three protected types of balsamic vinegar:

* &quot;Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Modena&quot; PDO (traditional balsamic vinegar of Modena)
* &quot;Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale di Reggio Emilia&quot; PDO (traditional balsamic vinegar of Reggio Emilia)
* &quot;Aceto Balsamico di Modena&quot; PGI (balsamic vinegar of Modena)

Many products contain Aceto Balsamico di Modena IGP as an ingredient, such as glazes and other condiments.

===&quot;Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PDO&quot; and &quot;traditional balsamic vinegar of Reggio Emilia PDO&quot;===


Only two consortia produce true traditional balsamic vinegar, that of Modena and neighbouring Reggio Emilia. True balsamic vinegar is made from a reduction of pressed Trebbiano and Lambrusco grapes. The resulting thick syrup, called &quot;mosto cotto&quot; in Italian, is subsequently aged for a minimum of 12 years in a battery of several barrels of successively smaller sizes. 

The casks are made of different woods such as chestnut, cherry, oak, mulberry, ash, and juniper. True balsamic vinegar is rich, glossy, deep brown, and has a complex flavour that balances the natural sweet and sour elements of the cooked grape juice with hints of wood from the casks.

Reggio Emilia designates the different ages of their balsamic vinegar (&quot;aceto balsamico tradizionale di Reggio Emilia&quot;) by label colour. A red label means the vinegar has been aged for at least 12 years, a silver label that the vinegar has aged for at least 18 years, and a gold label designates that the vinegar has aged for 25 years or more.

Modena uses a different system to indicate the age of its balsamic vinegars (&quot;aceto balsamico tradizionale di Modena&quot;). A white-coloured cap means the vinegar has aged for at least 12 years and a gold cap bearing the designation &quot;extravecchio&quot; (&#x27;extra-old&#x27;) shows the vinegar has aged for 25 years or more.

===Balsamic vinegar of Modena===

These commercial-grade products imitate the traditional product. They are made of as little as 20% grape must (and not necessarily from Modena or Reggio Emilia), with the addition of wine vinegar, colouring, caramel, and sometimes thickeners such as guar gum or cornflour to artificially simulate the sweetness and thickness of the aged &quot;aceto balsamico tradizionale di Modena&quot;. PGI status requires a minimum ageing period of two months, not necessarily in wooden barrels, rising to three years when labelled as invecchiato (&#x27;aged&#x27;). As the manufacturing process is highly industrialized, the output of a medium-sized producer may be hundreds of litres per day.
In 2009, the European Commission inserted the Balsamic Vinegar of Modena (&quot;aceto balsamico di Modena&quot;) designation in the register of PGI productions.

===&quot;Condimenti&quot; that used the term balsamic===
&quot;Condimento&quot; (&#x27;dressing&#x27;) balsamic vinegars may be labeled as &quot;condimento balsamico&quot;, &quot;salsa balsamica&quot; or &quot;salsa di mosto cotto&quot;. For those products, there is a risk of creating confusion among consumers looking for the original Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PGI, the two different Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PDO, and Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Reggio Emilia PDO.

&quot;Condimento&quot; balsamic vinegar may be made in any of the following ways:

* Made by producers of both Balsamic Vinegar of Modena PGI or Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena/Reggio Emilia PDO, by using the PGI or PDO as an ingredient. For those products, the use of the PGI and PDO as an ingredient must be clearly reported, i.e. &quot;glaze with Aceto Balsamico di Modena IGP&quot;. The Consortium must approve the label and the use of the PGI&#x27;s/PDO&#x27;s name.
* Made by the same method as the vinegars, but by producers outside Modena and Reggio Emilia provinces and not made under consortium supervision. No reference to the PDO/PGI can be made for those products, and they cannot use the geographical names Modena or Reggio Emilia.

As there are no official standards or labelling systems to designate &quot;condimento&quot; balsamic vinegar, it can be hard to tell their quality based on the packaging alone.
==Traditional processes==

Traditional balsamic vinegar is produced from the juice of just-harvested white grapes, typically, Trebbiano grapes, boiled down to reach a minimum sugar concentration of 30% (brix) or more in the must, which is then fermented with a slow ageing process which further concentrates the flavours. The flavour intensifies over the years, with the vinegar being stored in wooden casks, becoming sweet, viscous, and very concentrated. During this period, a portion evaporates: it is said that this is the &quot;angels&#x27; share&quot;, a term also used in the production of bourbon whiskey, Scotch whisky, wine, and other alcoholic beverages.

None of the product may be withdrawn until the end of the minimum aging period of 12 years. At the end of the aging period (12, 18 or 25 years), a small portion is drawn from the smallest cask, and each cask is then topped up with the contents of the preceding (next larger) cask. Freshly reduced cooked must is added to the largest cask, and in every subsequent year, the drawing and topping up process is repeated. This process where the product is distributed from the oldest cask and then refilled from the next oldest vintage cask is called solera or &quot;in perpetuum&quot;.

<text>St Mellons () is a district and suburb of eastern Cardiff, the capital city of Wales. Prior to 1996 St Mellons was the name given to the community largely north of Newport Road (B4487) which included the old St Mellons village. After 1996 the old community was divided and renamed as Old St Mellons and Pontprennau, with the newer, much larger area of modern housing and business parks to the south of Newport Road retaining the St Mellons name. Historically in Monmouthshire, St Mellons became part of South Glamorgan and Cardiff in 1974.

==History==
St Mellons village began as a small commercial centre in the historic county of Monmouthshire, relying heavily on rural agriculture, farming and travel. Owners of coach houses or coaching inns would cater for travellers using Newport Road, the old Roman Road between Cardiff and London.

St Mellons became a community (the lowest tier of local government) and part of the city of Cardiff district of South Glamorgan under the Local Government Act 1972 on 1 April 1974. The St Mellons community was divided and renamed in 1996: Old St Mellons was created from the eastern part (largely the Old St Mellons ward). The remaining part of the St Mellons community became Pontprennau.

When people refer to St Mellons today, they are often not talking about the historic St Mellons, but the considerably larger and more modern housing estate which has been built to the south and east. The newer estate has retained the name &#x27;St Mellons&#x27;. Many buildings in Old St Mellons date back to the 19th century while the vast majority of buildings in St Mellons were built in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

Vaendre Hall off Vaendre Close was built in 1850 for the industrialist John Cory, it sits on a 4 acre estate, having been sold with 18 acres in 1893. It is bordered by St Mellons golf course.

===Origins of the name===
The English name St Mellons is believed to be derived from the 6th-century Saint Melaine who became Bishop of Rennes in Brittany, rather than the more legendary 4th-century Mellonius, Bishop of Rouen. One of these bishops is known to have been born and brought up in the area where the estate now exists, though stories of the two have become hopelessly confused in many biographies over the years leaving historians unsure as to which is which.

The Welsh translation of St Mellons is &quot;Llaneirwg&quot; which is made up of &quot;Llan&quot;, a Welsh word meaning &#x27;enclosure&#x27;, and the personal-name Eirwg or Eurwg. Wales was originally evangelised by Celtic monks whose practice was to move into an area, and erect small premises within a fenced area - &#x27;the enclosure&#x27;. From here they continued their work and subsequently a church would be erected on the site. The extent of the missionary activity in Wales is shown by the number of place names beginning with &#x27;Llan&#x27; which is generally followed by the name of the missionary monk who founded the church in that place. In the case of LLaneirwg, Eurwg is the name of a mythical King of Gwent. Eurwg is said to have lived on the hill at St Mellons during the Romano-British era, he and his people were converted to Christianity and baptised in the nearby Rhymney River. Eurwg&#x27;s church was erected near the site of the former church of 1360 and the area has since been known as &quot;Llaneirwg&quot;, literally &quot;Church of Eirwg/Eurwg&quot;.

==Governance==
The modern St Mellons is included in the Trowbridge community and electoral ward which currently has three seats on Cardiff Council.

St Mellons (or Trowbridge) does not have a community council and the area falls outside the boundaries of Old St Mellons Community Council.

==The area==
The modern St Mellons is included in the Trowbridge community and electoral ward (Old St Mellons combines with neighbouring Pontprennau to become a Pontprennau &amp; Old St Mellons ward). The 2001 Census put the population of Trowbridge as 14,801, the 4th most populated ward in Cardiff. Located on the eastern edge of Cardiff, St Mellons is bordered by the unitary authority of Newport.

===Facilities===

The area is home to two major retail complexes. The largest features a Tesco petrol station and superstore, which hit the headlines in January 2010 when it banned customers from shopping in their nightwear and a parade of small retail units including a hairdresser, solicitor, betting shop, dentist, fish &amp; chip takeaway and newsagent.

The other complex, located approximately one mile away, has among others, two previously empty supermarket units which once belonged to Hyper Value and Kwik Save until both companies went into liquidation in 2006 and 2007. 

There are a number of sports and leisure facilities dotted around the district, including floodlit outdoor courts, playing fields and children&#x27;s play parks (at least two children&#x27;s play areas had the equipment removed and nature took over)as well as community centres (now demolished), a bowls club (now demolished), job centre and St Mellons Library. There is also &quot;Hendre Lake Park&quot;; a park and man-made lake popular with local fishermen situated near the mainline railway.

The Beacon Centre

Toward the south of the estate there is the Beacon Centre which is a community centre created in the early 2000s. The centre runs a large variety of groups and events for the community. The centre is home to the Beacon Church, an Elim Pentecostal church.

Shops and public houses

In Old St Mellons there is a Texaco petrol station, newsagent and convenience store, fish &amp; chip shop, and hairdresser. The Post Office closed in 2009. There are also four public houses situated in close proximity along Newport Road: &quot;The Church Inn&quot;, The Poachers Arms, &quot;Ty&#x27;r Winch&quot; and &quot;The Fox &amp; Hounds&quot; (widely believed to be one of the oldest pubs in Cardiff). These establishments were able to gain extra business on weekends by exploiting the Sunday Closing (Wales) Act 1881. The act prohibited the sale of alcohol in Welsh establishments on the Sabbath, but St Mellons was in the ancient county of Monmouthshire where the act did not take effect until 1921.

;Public houses in Old St Mellons
===Education===
St Mellons has 5 state primary schools: &quot;Meadowlane Primary&quot;, &quot;Bishop Childs Church in Wales Primary&quot;, &quot;Oakfield Primary&quot;, &quot;Willowbrook Primary&quot; and &quot;St. Mellons Church in Wales Primary&quot;. It also has a private school, St John&#x27;s College, Cardiff, amongst the best performing schools in Wales, based on results. The building and surrounding fields were part of the &quot;Ty-to-Maen convalescent house&quot;, which only closed in the 1970s. The surrounding land was sold off for housing in the late 1990s following the death of the house&#x27;s former owner William Nicholls, who now has a street on the estate named after him.

There are no learning institutions in this suburb for secondary, tertiary or higher education students (other than for fee-payers at St John&#x27;s College). Two secondary schools in the Rumney/Llanrumney area nearby, Eastern High School and St Illtyd&#x27;s Catholic High School (St. Illtyd&#x27;s also admits non-Catholics), mop up most secondary school pupils, who are expected to travel by bus or car to these establishments from St Mellons (at their own expense). Proposals in former years for a secondary school in the Tesco/Cath Cobb Woods area have been abandoned and strategically forgotten about.

Tertiary education is offered nearby at the Cardiff and Vale College, Rumney or St David&#x27;s Catholic College, Cyncoed (which also admits non-Catholics).

===Business park===

The St Mellons Business Park is a collection of large scale business parks located on low-lying land east of St Mellons considered to be Cardiff&#x27;s green belt. It has a vast number of factories and office units which have been (or are still) occupied by such companies as Capita, Gilesports, TBI, and Lloyds TSB. A number of roads in and around the business parks are named after computer programming languages, namely Pascal, COBOL and Fortran.

===Conservation area===
Old St Mellons has been deemed an area of special architectural or historical interest and lies in a conservation area which Cardiff County Council first adopted in 1977. The area was reassessed and updated in July 2007 to cover a smaller land area. A number of Grade II listed buildings lie inside the boundary of the conservation area including the &quot;Church Inn&quot; and &quot;Poachers Arms&quot; public houses, St Johns College, and the two churches.

===Coastal defences===
Much of the newer estates were built on the Wentloog Levels, areas of low-lying farmland which regularly became flooded until they were reclaimed from the sea during Roman times. A system of drainage reens and sluice gates together with a seawall which runs from the River Usk in the east to the Rhymney River in the west protect the area from the risk of coastal flooding as the land is still only a few metres above sea level.

===Wildlife===
Despite large scale development, a lot of wildlife can still be seen especially to the eastern fringe: foxes, rabbits, grey squirrels, buzzards, herons, egrets, moorhens, swans, mallards, green woodpeckers and many other birds are a common sight.

==Hendre Lakes Development==

Hendre Lakes Business Park is a large commercial property scheme proposed on land to the east of St Mellons by Cardiff Parkway Developments. Other investors in the project include Investec and the Welsh Government, which has a 10% equity stake.

The offices and other proposed facilities would be served by a new Cardiff Parkway train station as well as park and ride facilities.

Subject to planning, work on both projects is expected to start with the station and a first phase of 300,000 sq ft of 900,000 sq ft of development at Cardiff Hendre Lakes, completed in 2023.

==Transport==
===Roads===
All main roads and side streets in St. Mellons have a 20mph speed limit, with the exception of the A48 and Cypress Drive, where some sections have a 30mph limit. There are no permanent speed cameras anywhere in the estate. In 2007, a number of road-related deaths led to residents campaigning that traffic calming measures be implemented before more lives are lost. In late 2008, Cardiff Council began implementing new traffic calming measures outside the primary schools, including zebra crossings and speed bumps. These measures are now commonplace across St. Mellons.

The area is located next to Junction 29a of the A48 (M)/Eastern Avenue Junction, where the A48 continues eastbound through Coedkernew and the A48(M) rejoins the M4.

===Proposed M4 relief road===
Plans are in place to utilise the area&#x27;s motorway links by creating a new dual carriageway. The St Mellons / Wentloog Link road would become part of the Cardiff Ring Road, crossing the railway line to serve the existing freight terminal and industrial land built on the Wentloog Levels.

The plans, however, are not without objection from local residents who fear their health, safety and the value of their homes will be affected. The road is planned to be built in low-lying marsh land, which is a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI).

===Buses===
Cardiff Bus services 30, 44 and 45 serve the area. Services run frequently between the area and Cardiff City Centre.

===Rail===
There is no local railway station, despite Hendre Lake park being adjacent to the Freight Terminal Port, situated along the main line between Cardiff and Newport. The nearest main line station is Cardiff Central.

In July 2017, Transport Secretary Chris Grayling gave his backing to a privately financed £25 million station at St Mellons, to be known as Cardiff Parkway. Planning permission was granted in 2022, but the Welsh Government intervened with a review, citing the broader national interest of the project. The project was finally approved in January 2025.

<text>Pentrebane () is a district in the west of Cardiff, capital of Wales. It is part of the Fairwater community.

==Description==
Pentrebane was built in the 1960s on agricultural land to the northwest of Fairwater. The newer estate sits on the top of the hill overlooking Fairwater and Llandaff, and on the cusp of St. Fagans and the Vale of Glamorgan. To the north of the suburb lies the route of the former Llantrisant and Taff Vale Junction Railway and is served by Fairwater railway station.

There are three primary schools in close proximity to each other: Holy Family R.C. Primary, Pentrebane Primary and Ysgol Coed Y Gof. A Roman Catholic secondary school, Bishop Hannon was built in Pentrebane in the 1960s but demolished around 1987 to make way for housing (on what is now called Bell Fields).

==Governance==
Pentrebance falls within the Fairwater electoral ward for elections to Cardiff Council.

==Notable people==
The Wales footballer Ryan Giggs grew up living with his grandparents in Pentrebane.

<text>Gilbert &quot;Gib&quot; Parent (July 25, 1935 – March 3, 2009) was a Canadian member of Parliament. He is best known in his role as speaker of the House of Commons between 1994 and 2001.

Parent was born on July 25, 1935, in Mattawa, Ontario, and his janitor father, a Mattawa-born Metis, moved the young family to Welland, Ontario. He went to St. Joseph&#x27;s College on a football scholarship, and earned a teaching certificate from the Ontario College of Education.

Prior to his election to the House of Commons, he worked as a teacher and was vice-principal at Thorold Secondary School.

==Political career==
Parent was elected to Parliament six times as a member of the Liberal Party of Canada. He was first elected in the 1974 election representing the riding of St. Catharines. He was re-elected in the 1979, 1980. Parent was defeated in the 1984 election as Brian Mulroney&#x27;s Progressive Conservative Party swept to power, but regained his seat four years later in 1988, and was re-elected in the 1993 and 1997 elections.

His riding&#x27;s name was subsequently changed to Welland, then Welland—St. Catharines—Thorold and finally Niagara Centre. Under Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau, Parent served, at different times between 1977 and 1981, as Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Veterans Affairs, to the Minister of Labour and to the Minister of State (Sports).

Parent was first elected Speaker in January 1994. In the House, Parent was forced into the challenge of presiding over a five-party Parliament that resulted from the emergence of the Bloc Québécois and the Reform Party. Upon being re-elected to the position in September 1997, he told the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; that he expected the different voices in Parliament, informed by strong opinions on all sides, would make the House the lively place it should be.

Parent died at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto at the age of 73 of pneumonia while recovering from colon cancer surgery. He is survived by his brothers, Gerald Parent and Romeo Parent, wife of 39 years, Joan Parent (née Davis), their 4 daughters, Michele (Dave) Hundertmark, Monique (John) Finley, Madeleine (Mark) Thomas, and Terri (Sandro) Perruzza and 13 grandchildren, and partner Sandra Page, 2 daughters and 1 grandchild.

<doc id="847412" wikidata="Q7228084" url="?curid=847412" title="Pontcanna">
<text>is an inner-city district and community in the west of Cardiff, Wales. It is located adjecent to Canton, Cardiff. It is also located a short distance to the city centre, and its borders are approximately indicated by Western Avenue, the River Taff, Cowbridge Road East and Llandaff Road.

==Description==
Pontcanna is an area of wide tree-lined streets and large houses. It is a relatively wealthy area with numerous cafes and independent retailers centred on Pontcanna Street and Cathedral Road. There is both a large English-born population (roughly 25%) and a smaller Welsh-speaking population (roughly 20%). The area was formerly home to the television studios of TWW, Teledu Cymru, HTV and S4C&#x27;s headquarters; the BBC Wales&#x27;s Broadcasting House was nearby in Llandaff.

Many of the larger villas (particularly on Cathedral Road) have been converted into flats, guest houses or business premises. Located on the edge of Cardiff city centre, Pontcanna gives easy access to the centre for professionals, as well as access via the Gabalfa Interchange to the A48(M) motorway.

==History==
The name Pontcanna stems from Pont Canna Farm, which in turn was named after a bridge across the Whitehouse Brook, a one-time tributary of the River Taff which ran between Llandaff Fields and Riverside. The bridge is believed to have stood near the junction of what, today, are Teilo Street and Cathedral Road. The bridge was removed (and the brook covered up) in 1896. Saint Canna is said to have been a 6th-century saint, although there is little early evidence of her existence.

What is nowadays Pontcanna was almost completely open farmland until the late nineteenth century. The main route, Cathedral Road, was previously known as Pontcanna Lane, running between Plasturton Farm in the south and Pontcanna Farm to the north. In 1854 Sophia, widow of the 2nd Marquess of Bute began to finance the creation of a 41-acre garden on the site of Plasturton Farm, next to the River Taff and Cardiff Bridge. This is now a public amenity known as Sophia Gardens and was a catalyst for the development of Pontcanna.

Between 1885 and 1900 the large villas along Cathedral Road were constructed. Plasturton Avenue and Plasturton Gardens were then added at the turn of the twentieth century.

A large synagogue, designed by Delissa Joseph of London, was constructed and opened at the south end of Cathedral Road in 1896–7. After Cardiff&#x27;s Jewish community had largely moved to the suburbs, it was closed in 1989. It has been converted into luxury offices.

A chapel belonging to the Presbyterian Church of Wales, designed by Edgar G.C. Down of Cardiff, was built at the north end of Cathedral Road in 1903. It has since ceased to be a chapel and has been subdivided into office accommodation.

In 1951 the Sophia Gardens Pavilion was opened. This was a major entertainment venue for the city, hosting top stars such as Danny Kaye and Tommy Steele. In 1982 the roof collapsed after a heavy snow storm and the Pavilion was closed.

Some of the large villas along Cathedral Road have been replaced by modern office buildings. For example, No.8 Cathedral Road was rebuilt in the 1970s to create offices for Alex Gordon &amp; Partners, architects of Transport House (see below).

Transport House, prominently located at the south end of Cathedral Road, was designed by the Alex Gordon Partnership and opened in 1978. It is 5 storeys in height, constructed using pre-cast concrete panels. It is the headquarters for the Wales TUC and other trade union organisations.

==Parks and leisure facilities==
Sophia Gardens and Pontcanna Fields form a large strip of parkland between Pontcanna and the River Taff. Pontcanna Fields was acquired by the Cardiff Council from the 5th Marquis of Bute in 1947. The parkland includes the Cardiff City Riding School, football pitches and allotments.

Plasturton Gardens is a small public park between Plasturton Avenue and Plasturton Place.

The SWALEC Stadium (home to Glamorgan County Cricket Club) and the Sport Wales National Centre are located on Sophia Close, just north of Sophia Gardens Park.

==Government==
Pontcanna is part of the Cardiff electoral ward of Riverside, and in the Cardiff West UK parliamentary constituency.

In 2016 Pontcanna became a local government community in its own right, having previously been part of the Riverside community. However, it does not have a community council.

<text>Adamsdown (sometimes or , ) is an inner city area and community in the south of Cardiff, the capital city of Wales. Adamsdown is generally located between Newport Road, to the north and the mainline railway to the south. The area includes Cardiff Prison, Cardiff Magistrates&#x27; Court, Cardiff Royal Infirmary, a University of South Wales campus, and many streets of residential housing. There are two primary schools in the area Adamsdown Primary School and Tredegarville Primary School.

==History==
In mediaeval times, Adamsdown lay just outside the east walls of Cardiff and was owned by the lords of Glamorgan. The area may be named after an Adam Kygnot, a porter at Cardiff Castle around 1330 AD. The Welsh name &quot;Waunadda&quot; derives from &quot;(g)waun&quot; (a heath or down) and the personal name &quot;Adda&quot; (Adam). This name appears to be a recent creation, and there is no evidence that Adam Kygnot was ever called &#x27;Adda&#x27;. &quot;Y Sblot Uchaf&quot; is the Welsh name of Upper Splott, a farm that stood on the site of the later Great Eastern Hotel (demolished 2009) on the corner of Sun Street and Metal Street.

According to an 1824 map, Adamsdown was largely a farm. A replacement for a prison which was located on St Mary Street opened in the area in 1832, and a cemetery in 1848. In the following year, an outbreak of cholera affected the area. As the cemetery became full, it was converted into a park. In 1883 the &quot;South Wales and Mounmouthsire Infirmary&quot; was opened at a cost of £23,000. Many were refused from the hospital, such as those with infectious diseases and women in the advanced stages of pregnancy. In 1923, the hospital became the Cardiff Royal Infirmary.

The Newtown area of Adamsdown was the first new area to be developed, where many Irish immigrants settled. Street names are drawn from astronomy (Star, Constellation, Planet, Eclipse etc.), metals (Gold, Copper, Tin, Zinc, etc.) or jewellery (Topaz, Pearl, Agate, Saphire etc.).
The Church of St German of Auxerre, Star Street, was designed by Bodley &amp; Garner and built 1881–84. It is described as &quot;tall, spacious and elegant&quot;, also with a contemporary school house. The church is Grade I listed.

Cardiff&#x27;s first municipal secondary school was established at Howard Gardens in 1884, which became a Grammar School in 1941. It was destroyed by bombing in World War II, and a Cardiff Metropolitan University campus now stands on the site.

Until the 1970s, Roath Cattle Market and Slaughterhouse were located in Adamsdown. One could obtain meats illicitly off-ration during World War II. Regeneration of Adamsdown in the 20th century saw Victorian buildings demolished for 1960s and 70s tower blocks, the highest of which is Brunel House, at the eastern gateway to Cardiff city centre.

===Vulcan Hotel===
The Vulcan Hotel was a hotel and public house, formerly located in Adamsdown built in 1853. It was close to Queen Street station, on the southside of the Newport Road in the working class area of the suburb. It remained unchanged although adjoining Victorian buildings were demolished and redeveloped around it.

In 2012, Brains Brewery confirmed that they were to terminate their lease on the property. Marcol Asset Management agreed to donate the building to the St Fagans National History Museum. From July 2012, the building was taken down by contractors and preservationists, to allow brick-by-brick movement to St Fagans, styled as a &quot;between the wars&quot; 1920-1930s period exhibit.

==Today==
Cardiff Magistrates&#x27; Court, Cardiff Prison, Cardiff Royal Infirmary, the Cardiff School of Creative and Cultural Industries of the University of South Wales, Cardiff Reform Synagogue, and several Sikh temples can be found in this district and a mosque is under construction.

Adamsdown is one of the older working-class suburbs of Cardiff. It is about 10 minutes&#x27; walk from the commercial Cardiff city centre. It is largely a residential area, but is also home to the Rubicon Dance school. Adamsdown has undergone regeneration, in particular the shopping area of Clifton Street, where the traditional stone buildings such as Roath Police station have been sandblasted and renovated, most of the shop fronts have been replaced and updated, the pavements have been widened and a new one-way traffic system has been introduced. The aim of this was to attract more traders and shoppers to the area.

==Adamsdown electoral ward==
Adamsdown is both an electoral ward, and a community of the City of Cardiff. There is no community council for the area. The Adamsdown electoral ward falls within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff Central. It is bounded by the wards of Penylan to the north east; Splott to the south east; Butetown to the south; Cathays to the west; and Plasnewydd to the north. In the 2016 local elections Nigel Howells (Lib Dem) and Owen Llewellyn Jones (Labour) were elected Councillors.

==Transport==
Cardiff Queen Street station is on the western fringe of Adamsdown. The station is on the Valley Lines urban rail network.

The area is also served by Cardiff Bus. Services stopping outside the Cardiff Royal Infirmary, which all go to City Centre in the reverse direction are:
*11 (Pengam Green via Splott and Tremorfa)
*30 (Newport)
*44/45 (St. Mellons via Rumney)
*49/50 (Llanrumney)

The 11 route runs through the heart of the area connecting it with Tremorfa/Splott to the east and the City Centre to the west. The 1/2 &quot;Bay Circle&quot; route also serves some parts of the area.

The busy and commercial Newport Road (A4161) runs through northern Adamsdown, leading towards the M4 motorway to the east and the city centre to the west. City Road leads to northern districts of Cardiff.

<doc id="847422" wikidata="Q4816592" url="?curid=847422" title="Atlantic Wharf">
<text>Atlantic Wharf () is a southern area of the city of Cardiff, Wales. It is primarily an area of new houses and apartments located on the west side of the disused Bute East Dock and to the east of Lloyd George Avenue. It also includes a number of refurbished dock warehouses, modern hotels, the Red Dragon Centre and Cardiff Council&#x27;s County Hall. Atlantic Wharf lies in the Butetown electoral division of Cardiff and the Cardiff South and Penarth constituency for the UK Parliament and the Senedd.

==History==
The Bute East Dock (originally called the East Bute Dock) was constructed to ease pressure on the existing Bute Dock in the 1850s. It was opened by the 12-year-old Third Marquess of Bute on 14 September 1859. The new dock was 1,310 m in length and up to 152m wide. It was surrounded by railway sidings and large warehouses. Eventually the Bute East Dock was closed in 1970. The railway sidings were removed.

Only after 1980 did redevelopment begin around the disused dock. The Cardiff Bay Development Corporation was set up in the late 1980s to drive regeneration of the Docks area. Atlantic Wharf grew to include housing, new businesses, hotels and the conversion of three large derelict dock warehouses in the close vicinity of Bute East Dock. In 1988 the County Council built a new council headquarters building at Atlantic Wharf to reinforce the regeneration initiatives. It has been described as a &quot;remarkable gesture of faith [by] the South Glamorgan County Council&quot;.

A new multiplex cinema and leisure complex was built nearby, known as Atlantic Wharf Leisure Village (now the Red Dragon Centre). Collingdon Road was landscaped and redeveloped to form a mile-long boulevard to Cardiff Bay. Work was completed in 2000 and the road was renamed Lloyd George Avenue.

===21st century===
With approximately 1,500 houses and flats and no representative of its own on Cardiff Council, in 2016 the Atlantic Wharf Residents’ Association demanded that Atlantic Wharf be made into a separate electoral ward. There are also plans to regenerate the area with a large mixed-use development situated on a 30 acres (12 ha) site; this would include new council offices, waterfront apartments, a replacement leisure complex, hotel and &quot;immersive&quot; arts theatre to sit alongside a new 15,000 capacity indoor arena.

==&#x27;Little Ireland&#x27;==
The district of Newtown was constructed on the initiative of the Marquess of Bute in the mid-1800s to provide housing for the labourers who were building the new docks. The area consisted of six streets in the far north edge of what is now Atlantic Wharf. The streets were occupied mainly by Irish immigrants from Cork. Over 100 years after its creation, the buildings of Newtown were subject to compulsory purchase and were demolished in 1970 for redevelopment. The area eventually became an industrial estate next to the mainline railway.

==Notable buildings==

* The Bonded Warehouse – Built in 1861 at the head of Bute East Dock using a frame of cast iron columns, in classical proportions. Grade II listed. Now converted into offices for an architecture practice.
* Spillers &amp; Bakers building (Schooner Way) – Mill and warehouse building constructed by milling company Spillers in 1887. Grade II listed. Now converted into luxury apartments.
* The Bute Docks Feeder canal runs through the area. Two of the original 1850s bridges have Grade II listed status.
* County Hall (Atlantic Wharf) – Headquarters of Cardiff Council, built 1986–1987 and officially opened in October 1988 by Lord Callaghan.
* Red Dragon Centre (Hemingway Road) – Leisure complex including a 12-screen cinema, bowling alley and restaurants.
* The quayside crane, built in 1933 by Messrs. Stothert &amp; Pitt Ltd., was built for the Great Western Railway Company and was last used in January 1987.

<doc id="847429" wikidata="Q2293778" url="?curid=847429" title="Driver (video game)">
<text>Driver (subtitled &quot;You Are the Wheelman&quot; in North America) is an action driving video game and the first installment in the &quot;Driver&quot; series. Developed by Reflections Interactive and published by GT Interactive, it was released on the PlayStation on 25 June 1999, and was ported to Microsoft Windows on 1 October 1999, and to Classic Mac OS on 12 December 2000 by Abersoft Limited.

The game, inspired by movie car chases, sees players driving around four real-life cities – Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York – using a variety of vehicles, with the plot focusing on the work of an undercover police officer, John Tanner, who infiltrates a criminal outfit to investigate their operations, only to discover a plot by their boss to assassinate the President of the United States.

The game proved a commercial hit upon release, and received favorable reviews from critics. Ports for Microsoft Windows and Mac were released on 1 October 1999 and December 2000. A remake for the Game Boy Color, developed by Crawfish Interactive and published by Infogrames was released in May 2000, while versions for iOS and Palm Pre, developed and published by Gameloft, were released on 8 December 2009. The game was re-released on the PlayStation Network on 14 October 2008. The game&#x27;s success led to further sequels, including &quot;Driver 2&quot; in November 2000 and &quot;Driver 3&quot; in June 2004.

== Gameplay ==
The game is played out in four cities: Miami, San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York, each of which remain only partially faithful to the actual city layouts. A fifth bonus city, Newcastle (where Reflections Interactive is based), is unlockable in the PC version through gameplay and in the PlayStation version using a cheat device, but no missions are available and the playable area is small. The game was notable at the time of its original release insofar as the player was able to explore each city as an open world environment. &quot;Driver&quot; has often been compared to the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; series. It also bears significant thematic resemblances to the 20th Century Fox movie &quot;The Driver&quot; (1978).

== Plot ==
NYPD detective and former racing driver John Tanner is sent undercover by Lieutenant McKenzie to investigate a crime syndicate led by Castaldi; McKenzie instructs Tanner to go to Miami and meet a pimp named Rufus. After arriving in Miami, Tanner uses his driving skills to prove himself to some gangsters in a parking garage, and becomes their getaway driver.

Tanner carries out jobs for various criminals before meeting Rufus, who tasks Tanner with rescuing Jean-Paul, one of his associates. Rufus is later shot dead by his girlfriend Jesse, whom Tanner apprehends, and she reveals that Jean-Paul is now in San Francisco.

Tanner goes to San Francisco, where he finally meets Castaldi and begins working directly for him. He also meets Rusty Slater, his former racing rival, who also works for Castaldi. Tanner later learns from local informant Mojo that Castaldi is working with a man named Don Hancock, who is running for president. He comes to suspect that Slater has been spying on him and wrecks Slater&#x27;s car during a chase, resulting in Slater being arrested.

Castaldi&#x27;s syndicate moves to Los Angeles, where Castaldi plans to assassinate FBI agent Bill Maddox. Tanner instructs Lech, a police associate, to ensure Maddox turns up; otherwise, his cover may be blown. The assassination fails and the police ambush the gangsters, forcing Tanner to take them to safety. Tanner convinces the suspicious gangsters that Slater told the police about the planned assassination. Lech later tells Tanner that McKenzie recently met with Marcus Vaughn, an FBI agent whom Tanner realizes is working with Castaldi and Hancock.

The syndicate then moves to New York, where Castaldi plans a high-profile assassination. Lech tells Tanner that Hancock has bribed several people in the FBI and that McKenzie wants him to pull out of the operation, as he worries for Tanner&#x27;s cover. Tanner insists on staying undercover and keeps working for Castaldi, intent on uncovering his plan.

Tanner eventually learns that Castaldi plans to assassinate the President of the United States, and Tanner is tasked with driving the President&#x27;s car. However, he ignores all instructions and takes the President to safety. McKenzie then arrives and tells Tanner that Castaldi and all of his associates, including Hancock and Vaughn, have been arrested, then offers Tanner his badge back. However, Tanner suspects that the police and FBI were involved with Castaldi, so he leaves, ignoring McKenzie completely.

== Development ==
Series creator Martin Edmonson was inspired by the very first film he saw at the cinema, 1978 crime thriller &quot;The Driver&quot;. The &quot;infamous car park level&quot;, which tasks players with performing a series of driving feats such as handbrake turns and slaloming, the difficulty of which frustrated many players, was directly lifted from a scene in the film.

The destruction of vehicles in-game was inspired by Edmonson watching &quot;real destruction derbies and banger racing&quot; as a child and observing the &quot;twisted metal and the battered cars&quot; afterwards. To achieve the &quot;sound effects of the crunching metal sound&quot; of car crashes during development, the team &quot;went to a wrecker&#x27;s yard and hired a big JCB, and we were picking up cars and dropping them on top of other cars&quot;.

According to Spanish video game magazine &quot;Magazine 64&quot;, in 1999, GT Interactive were conducting development tests for a port to the Nintendo 64, although no such release ever materialized. In 2009, a remastered version of the game was released on the App Store. Developed and published by Gameloft, the original plot and structure were left intact, but the graphics were enhanced, the music was re-done, and voice acting was re-recorded for the cutscenes.

== Reception ==
&quot;Driver&quot; was a commercial hit, with sales above 1 million units by early August 1999. In the German market, &quot;Driver&quot;″s PlayStation version received a &quot;Gold&quot; award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) by the end of July, indicating sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The committee raised it to &quot;Platinum&quot; status (200,000 sales) by the end of September. In the United States, &quot;Driver&quot;″s jewel case version for computers sold 390,000 copies and earned $3.8 million by August 2006, after its release in October 2000. It was the country&#x27;s 42nd-best-selling computer game between January 2000 and August 2006. , it has sold over units worldwide and grossed $150 million in revenue.

Upon its initial release, &quot;Driver&quot; was met with very positive feedback and critical acclaim. The PlayStation and iOS versions received &quot;favorable&quot; reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

Jeff Lundrigan reviewed the PlayStation version of the game for &quot;Next Generation&quot;, rating it four stars out of five, and stated that &quot;a movie buff&#x27;s dream – but &quot;Driver&quot; is still great even if you aren&#x27;t big on movies&quot;.

IGN&#x27;s Douglass C. Perry said of the original PlayStation game: &quot;In the history of driving games for PlayStation, there is nothing that comes close to the comprehensive, deep, and thoroughly pleasurable experience that&#x27;s embedded deep in the heart of &quot;Driver&quot; [...] It fulfills driving enthusiasts&#x27; deepest desires to drive as fast as possible through major US cities and to slam into just about anything without any repercussions. In that sense, &quot;Driver&quot; is a dream come true&quot;. He went on to call it &quot;one of the best driving games on any system&quot;. Game Revolution&#x27;s Ben Silverman was equally impressed, saying: &quot;&quot;Driver&quot; excels where other games have failed by striking a perfect balance between action and realism. Car handling is a wonderful mixture of true physics and arcade functionality—not as nitpicky and sim oriented as &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; nor as ridiculously implausible as &quot;SF Rush&quot;. Driving follows the &#x27;easy to learn, hard to master&#x27; formula [...] Rarely does a game captivate the stoic and hypercritical Game Revolution office, but &quot;Driver&quot; has done just that&quot;. GameSpot&#x27;s Ryan MacDonald was not as enthusiastic, saying: &quot;&quot;Driver&quot; is a game that might be mediocre in its presentation but more than makes up for it in its gameplay and concept&quot;.

IGN&#x27;s Mike Morrissey praised the quality of the PC port and said: &quot;Though the PC version of &quot;Driver&quot; is a fairly straight port from the PlayStation title released in July, graphic improvements are apparent, especially at resolutions of 800x600 and over with the details cranked. Though this requires a fairly fast computer, the effect is worth it. Smooth frame rates reveal nice textures for the buildings and surroundings, translucent water in areas of Miami, and of course, lens flare&quot;. GameSpot&#x27;s Erik Wolpaw was somewhat disappointed with the port, but this was negated because the original game was so strong: &quot;Like many console-to-PC ports, &quot;Driver&quot; suffers from being translated verbatim and taking little advantage of the more powerful PC platform. However, &quot;Driver&quot;″s core game design is so strikingly original and fun that it can be enjoyed without embellishment&quot;. They concluded that &quot;it is addictive, intuitive, and fun, which are qualities sometimes overlooked in the industry&#x27;s myopic pursuit of purely technical innovation. With &quot;Driver&quot;, Reflections has produced the definitive re-creation of the classic urban car-chase movie and has quite possibly introduced a new genre of driving game&quot;.

IGN&#x27;s Craig Harris praised the Game Boy Color port&#x27;s top down view and the controls and concluded: &quot;I&#x27;m actually quite surprised at how well &quot;Driver&quot; turned out for the Game Boy Color. I was expecting a Point-A-to-B game like &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and got a whole lot more. The missions have different elements to give the basic formula a bit more variety. It&#x27;s missing a few details from the PlayStation version, but for what Crawfish had to work with hardware-wise, the development team did a great job&quot;. GameSpot&#x27;s Frank Provo was critical of the sound, but aside from that, he said, &quot;&quot;Driver&quot; is smoothness personified. Driving around is fun and exciting, the levels are varied, and the side games really do improve your skill within the main game. Even without a battery save and a two-player feature, there&#x27;s really nothing major to complain about&quot;.

Reviewing the Classic Mac OS port of the game in March 2001, &quot;MacAddict&quot; editor Frank O&#x27;Connor gave the game a positive review, noting that it &quot;plays like a dream&quot; and described it as &quot;hecka fun&quot;. Criticism was noted for the Macintosh version being a port of the PlayStation version as opposed to the enhanced Windows version. O&#x27;Connor noted that a &quot;few graphical tweaks and even some rudimentary changes to the interlace would have made Driver an instant and all-time Mac classic&quot;. 

Despite the general praise, the opening tutorial set in a car park, where the player has to perform various stunts and moves (such as drifting and 180 degree turns) as well as the final mission, were criticised for excessive difficulty. Because of this, the game frequently appears in lists of &quot;hardest PS1 games&quot;.

At the 1999 E3 Game Critics Awards, &quot;Driver&quot; won &quot;Best Racing Game&quot;, and in 2002 it was ranked No. 12 on IGN&#x27;s list of the &quot;Top 25 PlayStation Games&quot;. The Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences named &quot;Driver&quot; as a finalist for &quot;Console Game of the Year&quot; and &quot;Console Racing Game of the Year&quot; during the 3rd Annual Interactive Achievement Awards.

<text>The Justice and Development Party (Arabic: حزب العدالة والتنمية) is a political party in Morocco that advocates for Islamic democracy. It was the ruling party of Morocco from 2011 to 2021.

==History==
PJD was founded by Abdelkrim al-Khatib, one of the founders of the Popular Movement party, from which he was expelled in the mid-1960s, under the name of &quot;MPDC&quot; (, the &quot;Popular Democratic and Constitutional Movement&quot;). The party was an empty shell for many years, until various members of a clandestine association Chabiba Islamia, who later formed the MUR (, the &quot;Unity and Reform Movement&quot;) joined the party, with the authorisation and encouragement of former interior minister Driss Basri. It later changed its name to current PJD in 1998.

The party won eight seats in the parliamentary election in 1997. In the parliamentary election held on 27 September 2002, the party won 42 out of 325 seats, winning most of the districts where it fielded candidates. Its secretary-general since 2004 was Saadeddine Othmani, MP representing Mohammedia. In the parliamentary election held on 7 September 2007, the PJD won 43 out of 325 seats, behind the Istiqlal Party, which won 52. This was contrary to expectations that the PJD would win the most seats. However, the party had limited number of candidates in the election.

Abdelilah Benkirane was elected leader of the PJD in July 2008, taking over from Saadeddine Othmani. Having won a plurality of seats (107 seats) in the November 2011 parliamentary election, the party formed a coalition with three parties that had been part of previous governments, and Benkirane was appointed Prime Minister of Morocco on 29 November 2011.

His new government has targeted average economic growth of 5.5 percent a year during its four-year mandate, and to reduce the jobless rate to 8 percent by the end of 2016 from 9.1 percent at the start of 2012. Benkirane&#x27;s government has also actively pursued Morocco&#x27;s ties with the European Union, its chief trade partner, as well as becoming increasingly engaged with the six-member Gulf Co-operation Council.

In the 2021 general election, the PJD suffered a crushing defeat, losing 113 seats.

On 11 March 2023, the PJD released a statement criticizing Nasser Bourita, Morocco&#x27;s foreign minister, accusing him of defending Israel during meetings with African and European officials. In response, the royal cabinet released a statement rebuking the PJD. Party leader Abdelilah Benkirane asked members of the party to not comment on the statement released by the royal cabinet and said the comments were directed towards Bourita, rather than the nation&#x27;s interests.

==Ideology==
PJD is a conservative Islamic-democratic party which supports the Moroccan monarchy. PJD disavows violence, terrorism and seeks to defend Morocco&#x27;s Islamic identity through legislative means.

According to a paper published by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the PJD has placed economic and legal issues at the core of its platform and is committed to internal democracy.

The party&#x27;s stated platform includes:
* Education reform and reestablishment.
* Economic partnerships with other countries.
* Enhancement of democracy and human rights.
* Encouraging investment.
* Greater &quot;Arab and Muslim unity&quot;.

It is historically affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, however, despite this, PJD was never an official branch.

<doc id="847436" wikidata="Q918514" url="?curid=847436" title="Alexei Razumovsky">
<text>Count Alexei Grigorievich Razumovsky (, ; 1709–1771) was a Russian Registered Cossack who rose to become the lover, and it was suggested he was the morganatic spouse, of Empress Elizabeth Petrovna of Russia. A member of the House of Razumovsky, he survived Elizabeth. The matter of any children they may have had together is unresolved.

==Early life==
Alexei Grigorievich Razumovsky was born as Alexei (or Oleksiy) Rozum on 17 March 1709 (NS: 28 March) on Lemeshi, a farm in the area of Chernigov Regiment, Tsardom of Russia (now Ukraine), to the family of a registered Ukrainian-born Cossack, Gregory Rozum. In his youth he was a shepherd and he was taught to read and write by a rural sexton. Having a fine voice, he sang in the choir at the village church. In 1731, Colonel Vyshnevsky, one of empress Anna Ivanovna&#x27;s courtiers, while passing through the village on his way back to the Russian capital from a mission to Hungary, was impressed with his vocal ability, and took him to Saint Petersburg where he joined the choir of the Russian palace chapel as Alexei Grigoriev.

Razumovsky was handsome, which, along with his vocal talents, captivated Elizabeth Petrovna, who brought him to the imperial court in 1732. With the deportation of Elizabeth&#x27;s then favourite, Alexis Shubin, Razumovsky became her favorite. After losing his voice, he was accepted in the post of the court bandura player, and then the manager of one of Elizabeth&#x27;s mansions. He received the rank of the hof-quartermeister; and actually supervised Elizabeth&#x27;s court. During the period of Anna Leopoldovna&#x27;s reign he was made a Kamer-Junker.

==&quot;Night Emperor&quot;==
Razumovsky played an important role in the palace revolution of 25–26 November 1741 (NS 6–7 December), which brought about Elizabeth Petrovna&#x27;s accession to the throne. On 30 November (NS 11 December) he was appointed as a chamberlain with the rank of a general-lieutenant. On the coronation day (25 April (NS: 6 May) 1742) he was made a Hofmarschall. Other honours bestowed on him included the Order of Saint Andrew and the Order of Alexander Nevsky, as well as being awarded numerous estates in Moscow and elsewhere.

Two years later in 1744, he received the comital title Reichsgraf (рейхграф in Russian) from the Holy Roman Emperor Charles VII and he was made a count in Russia in the same year. In 1745 he became the captain-lieutenant of the life-guards, and in 1748 he became the lieutenant-colonel of life-guards. On 5 September (NS: 16 September) 1756 he received the rank of field marshal. During Elizabeth Petrovna&#x27;s reign he kept an exclusive position at court (though in his last years he was rivaled by the younger Ivan Shuvalov); in 1744, the empress visited his native village and met members of his family. Razumovsky&#x27;s apartments in the Summer Palace directly adjoined to Elizabeth&#x27;s apartments, and he had constant access to her.

Razumovsky was not interested in politics, but he quite often supported chancellor Bestuzhev. On his advice, the office of Ukrainian &quot;hetman&quot; was restored and his younger brother Kirill Razumovsky was made a &quot;hetman&quot; and president of the Russian Academy of Sciences.

==Later years==
Before her death, the empress made her successor Peter III promise not to offend her favorites. In 1762, Razumovsky submitted his resignation and moved from the Winter Palace to the Anichkov Palace, which had been presented to him by Elizabeth. After Catherine II&#x27;s accession to the throne, Razumovsky refused the title of highness that was offered to him. At the empress&#x27;s request, he destroyed all documents about his marriage with Elizabeth. He died on 6 July (NS 17 July) 1771 in Saint Petersburg and was buried in the Annunciation Church of the Alexandro-Nevskaya Lavra.

The question of Razumovsky and Elizabeth Petrovna&#x27;s children remains unresolved and subject to many legends. The best known pretenders were two princesses Tarakanova, one of whom (Augusta Tarakanova) became a nun under the name Dosifeya. She died in 1810 and was buried in the Romanov family crypt; another (Elizabeth Tarakanova) was arrested in Livorno, Tuscany by Aleksei Grigoryevich Orlov and returned to Russia in February 1775. She was then imprisoned in the Peter and Paul Fortress, where she died from tuberculosis. The legend of her being drowned during the floods of 1777 served as the plot for a painting by artist Konstantin Flavitsky (1864, Tretyakov Gallery).

<text>Thomas Corwin Mendenhall (October 4, 1841 – March 23, 1924) was an American autodidact physicist and meteorologist. He was the first professor hired at Ohio State University in 1873 and the superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey (one of the ancestor organizations of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) from 1889 to 1894. Alongside his work, he was also an advocate for the adoption of the metric system by the United States and is the father of author profiling.

==Biography==

Mendenhall was born in Hanoverton, Ohio, to Stephen Mendenhall, a farmer and carriage-maker, and Mary Thomas. In 1852 the family moved to Marlboro, a Quaker community outside of Akron, Ohio. His parents were strong abolitionists and frequently opened their home to escaped slaves heading north along the Underground Railroad. Mendenhall became principal of the local primary school in 1858. He formalized his teaching qualifications at National Normal University in 1861 with an &quot;Instructor Normalis&quot; degree.

While living in Columbus, Ohio, he married Susan Allan Marple in 1870. The couple had one child, Charles Elwood Mendenhall (1872–1935), teacher and chairman of the physics department at University of Wisconsin–Madison for 34 years.

He taught at a number of schools in Ohio including Central High School in Columbus, gaining an impressive reputation as a teacher and educator. In 1873, although he lacked conventional academic credentials, he was appointed professor of physics and mechanics at the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College. The college ultimately became Ohio State University, Mendenhall being the first member of the original faculty. He was later awarded the first ever honorary Ph.D. from The Ohio State University in 1878.
In 1878, on the recommendation of Edward S. Morse, he was recruited to help the modernization of Meiji Era Japan as one of the &quot;o-yatoi gaikokujin&quot; (hired foreigners), serving as visiting professor of physics at Tokyo Imperial University. In connection with this appointment, he founded a meteorological observatory to make systematic observations during his residence in Japan. From measurements using a Kater&#x27;s pendulum of the force of gravity at sea level and at the summit of Mount Fuji, Mendenhall deduced a value for the mass of the Earth that agreed closely with estimates that Francis Baily had made in England by another method. He also made a series of elaborate measurements of the wavelengths of the solar spectrum by means of a large spectrometer. He also became interested in earthquakes while in Japan, and was one of the founders of the Seismological Society of Japan (SSJ). During his time in Japan, he also gave public lectures on various scientific topics to general audiences in temples and in theaters.

Returning to Ohio in 1881, Mendenhall was instrumental in developing the Ohio State Meteorological Service. He devised a system of weather signals for display on railroad trains. This method became general throughout the United States and Canada.
He became professor at the U.S. Signal Corps in 1884, introducing of systematic observations of lightning, and investigating methods for determining ground temperatures. He was the first to establish stations in the United States for the systematic observation of earthquake phenomena. Resigning in 1886, Mendenhall took up the presidency of the Rose Polytechnic Institute in Terre Haute, Indiana before becoming superintendent of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1889. During his time as superintendent, he issued the Mendenhall Order and oversaw the consequent transition of the United States&#x27;s weights and measures from the customary system, based on that of England, to the metric system. Mendenhall remained a strong proponent for the official adoption of the metric system all his life. Also, as superintendent of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, he was also responsible for defining the exact national boundary between Alaska and Canada. The Mendenhall Valley and Glacier in Juneau, Alaska was named for him in 1892. 

Mendenhall invented the portable Mendenhall Gravimeter in 1890 while he was superintendent of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, and at that time it provided the most accurate relative measurements of the local gravitational field of the Earth. The gravimeters were used at over 340 survey stations across the US and around the world including Germany, the Netherlands, Java, Philippines, Cuba, Haiti, Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Panama, Canada, and Mexico. The swing of the pendulum was more regular than the most accurate clocks of the era, and as the &quot;world&#x27;s best clock&quot; it was used by Albert A. Michelson to measure the speed of light, for which he won a Nobel Prize in 1907. An early model of the original 1890s Mendenhall Gravimeter is on display at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.
Mendenhall was appointed president of the Worcester Polytechnic Institute from 1894 until 1901, when he emigrated to Europe. He returned to the United States in 1912. He was appointed to the board of trustees of the Ohio State University in 1919 and is remembered for his successful efforts to close the College of Homeopathic Medicine and his unsuccessful effort to limit the capacity of Ohio Stadium to 45,000 seats, contending that it would never be able to fill to its design capacity of 63,000 seats. He continued to serve as a trustee until his death at Ravenna, Ohio in 1924. He was buried at Forest Hill Cemetery in Madison, Wisconsin.

His portrait is currently part of the Smithsonian Institution National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. It was painted by his former pupil Annie Ware Sabine Siebert, who was the first recipient of a Master of Arts degree from The Ohio State University in 1886, and one of the first women to earn an architecture degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1888. A portrait by famous artist and Columbus, Ohio native George Bellows was commissioned by the Ohio State University in 1913.

The largest collection of images, historical documents and handwritten material relating to Thomas Corwin Mendenhall is with Mendenhall family member documentary filmmaker Sybil Drew.

==Work on stylometry==
In 1887 Mendenhall published one of the earliest attempts at stylometry also known as author profiling, the quantitative analysis of writing style. Prompted by a suggestion made by the English mathematician Augustus De Morgan in 1851, Mendenhall attempted to characterize the style of different authors through the frequency distribution of words of various lengths. In this article Mendenhall mentioned the possible relevance of this technique to the Shakespeare authorship question, and several years later the idea was picked up by a supporter of the theory that Sir Francis Bacon was the true author of the works usually attributed to Shakespeare. He paid for a team of two people to undertake the counting required, but the results did not appear to support the theory. For comparison, in 1901 Mendenhall also had works by Christopher Marlowe analysed, and proponents of the Marlovian theory of Shakespeare authorship welcomed his finding that &quot;in the characteristic curve of his plays Christopher Marlowe agrees with Shakespeare about as well as Shakespeare agrees with himself.&quot;

<text>KTVI (channel 2) is a television station in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, affiliated with the Fox network. It is owned by Nexstar Media Group alongside KPLR-TV (channel 11), an owned-and-operated station of The CW. The two stations share studios on Ball Drive in Maryland Heights; KTVI&#x27;s transmitter is located in Sappington, Missouri.

==History==
===As WTVI===
The station first signed on the air by Signal Hill Telecasting Corporation on August 10, 1953, as WTVI, broadcasting on UHF channel 54. It was originally licensed to Belleville, Illinois (across the Mississippi River from St. Louis), and was the second television station in the St. Louis market after KSD-TV (channel 5, now KSDK) on February 8, 1947. The station&#x27;s first broadcast was a baseball game between the St. Louis Browns and Cincinnati Reds, announced by Buddy Blattner, Bill Durney and Milo Hamilton. It operated as a primary CBS affiliate, and held secondary affiliations with ABC and DuMont. DuMont affiliation was agreed to in February 1953 to replace KSD-TV. The station was project to sign on May 15, 1953. The station originally operated from studios located in Alton, Illinois. The CBS affiliation moved to KWK-TV (channel 4, now KMOV) when it debuted on July 8, 1954; more or less by default, WTVI became a primary ABC affiliate.

===As KTVI===
The station moved to UHF channel 36, and relocated its city of license to St. Louis on April 9, 1955, keeping the base &quot;TVI&quot; letters as part of its callsign while flipping the first assigned letter from &quot;W&quot; to &quot;K&quot; with this switch of sides of the Mississippi River, thus changing to the current KTVI. It moved its operations to facilities located in the Clayton-Tamm/Dogtown neighborhood in west St. Louis (off present-day I-64/US 40 at the intersection of Berthold, Oakland, and Hampton Avenues). However, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) had recently changed its regulations so that the station could have kept its license in Belleville even while moving its main studio to St. Louis. The WTVI calls are currently used by a PBS member station in Charlotte, North Carolina.

The station lost DuMont programming when the network ceased operations in 1956, making KTVI an exclusive ABC affiliate. As the FCC would not require television sets to include UHF tuners until 1961, on April 15, 1957, KTVI moved to VHF channel 2, something it had attempted to do soon after moving to St. Louis–the channel 2 allocation had been reassigned from Springfield, Illinois, under pressure from the Truman administration, originally done so as not to interfere with CBS-owned WBBM-TV in Chicago.

For many years, the station was owned by the Newhouse newspaper chain (now Advance Publications), owners of the now-defunct &quot;St. Louis Globe-Democrat&quot;. In 1980, Newhouse exited from broadcasting, and sold KTVI and its other television outlets to the Los Angeles-based Times Mirror Company. In March 1993, in order for the company to concentrate on its newspaper and cable television system franchises, Times Mirror sold KTVI and its three sister stations—fellow CBS affiliates KTBC in Austin and KDFW-TV in Dallas–Fort Worth and NBC affiliate WVTM-TV in Birmingham—to Argyle Television Holdings in a two-part deal for $335 million in cash and securities. Under the transaction&#x27;s purchase option structure, WVTM and KTVI were the first two stations that Argyle sold to New World, which the latter purchased for a combined $80 million. (It would later respectively acquire KDFW and KTBC from the group for $335 million in cash and securities). The purchase of the entire group was completed in December of that year following securement of financing for the deal.

===As a Fox station===
====New World Communications ownership====
On May 23, 1994, as part of a $500-million overall deal in which network parent News Corporation also purchased a 20% equity interest in the group, New World signed a long-term affiliation agreement with Fox to switch thirteen television stations—five that New World had already owned and eight that the company was in the process of acquiring through separate deals with Great American Communications and Argyle Television Holdings (which New World purchased one week later in a purchase option-structured deal for $717 million), including KTVI—to the network. The stations involved in the agreement—all of which were affiliated with one of the three major broadcast networks (CBS, ABC and NBC)—would become Fox affiliates once individual affiliation contracts with each of the stations&#x27; existing network partners had expired. (WVTM did not switch as WBRC, which was placed in a blind trust, was later sold to Fox outright as New World could not keep both due to FCC rules at the time that forbade duopolies). The deal was motivated by the National Football League (NFL)&#x27;s awarding of the rights to the National Football Conference (NFC) television package to Fox on December 18, 1993, in which the conference&#x27;s broadcast television rights moved to the network effective with the 1994 NFL season, ending a 38-year relationship with CBS.

ABC had a fourteen-month leeway to find a new affiliate in St. Louis, as its contract with KTVI did not expire until July 1, 1995; its affiliation contracts expired only one month after as CBS&#x27;s agreement with KDFW and KTBC was scheduled to expire, giving the networks that were already affiliated with the three former Argyle stations slated to switch to Fox a longer grace period to find new affiliates than CBS, NBC and/or ABC were given in most of the other markets affected by the Fox-New World deal (ABC&#x27;s affiliation contracts with WGHP and WBRC ended even later, respectively expiring in September 1995 and September 1996). Of ABC&#x27;s options, four prospects were automatically eliminated: KSDK was in the middle of a long-term affiliation agreement between its owner at the time, Multimedia Broadcasting, and NBC; KMOV was under a long-term agreement between CBS and Paramount Stations Group (which was in the process of selling KMOV and its four other major network affiliates to focus on its Fox-affiliated and independent stations that were set to become charter affiliates of group parent Viacom&#x27;s then-upstart United Paramount Network [UPN]); and KNLC (channel 24, now a MeTV owned-and-operated station) and WHSL (channel 46, now Ion Television O&amp;O WRBU) were respectively owned by the locally based New Life Christian Church and the Home Shopping Network at the time, and both stations had inferior signals, even on cable, making either unlikely choices as even last-ditch options. This left independent station KPLR-TV (channel 11, now a CW owned-and-operated station) and existing Fox station KDNL-TV (channel 30) as the only viable options with which ABC could reach an affiliation agreement. The network first approached KPLR about negotiating an affiliation deal, ultimately to be turned down by its then-owner Koplar Communications. On August 25, 1994, River City Broadcasting reached an agreement with ABC to shift the network&#x27;s affiliation rights to KDNL.

KTVI switched to Fox on August 7, 1995, ending its relationship with ABC after 42 years; concurrently, ABC programming moved to KDNL-TV. The last ABC program to air on KTVI was an &quot;ABC Sunday Night Movie&quot; presentation of &quot;Survive the Savage Sea&quot; at 8 p.m. Central Time on August 6. As with most of the other New World-owned stations affected by the agreement with Fox, KTVI retained its longtime &quot;Channel 2&quot; branding upon the affiliation switch, with references to the Fox logo and name limited in most on-air imaging; it also retained the news branding it had been using before it joined the network—in its case, &quot;The 2 News Team&quot;, which the station adopted in November 1990 as an ABC affiliate. In addition to expanding its local news programming at the time it joined Fox, the station replaced ABC daytime and late-night programs that migrated to KDNL with an expanded slate of syndicated talk shows as well as some documentary-based reality series and off-network sitcoms, and also acquired some syndicated film packages and first-run and off-network syndicated drama series for broadcast in weekend afternoon timeslots on weeks when Fox did not provide sports programming.

====News Corporation/Fox ownership====
On July 17, 1996, News Corporation announced that it would acquire New World in an all-stock transaction worth $2.48 billion, with the latter company&#x27;s ten Fox affiliates being folded into the former&#x27;s Fox Television Stations subsidiary, making them all owned-and-operated stations of the network (the New World Communications name continued as a licensing purpose corporation for KTVI and its sister stations until 2007 under Fox, and from 2009 to 2011 under Local TV ownership); upon the completion of the merger on January 22, 1997, KTVI became the first network-owned station in the St. Louis market since CBS sold KMOX-TV (which became what is now KMOV concurrent to the sale) to Viacom in 1986. Under Fox ownership, programming began to change very slightly as KTVI (through Fox) began to add stronger first-run syndicated shows as well as stronger off-network sitcoms to the programming mix.

KTVI first launched its website on November 1, 1999, which featured a design similar to other sites belonging to Fox&#x27;s owned-and-operated stations at the time and focused on promotional and programming content initially, but eventually incorporated news content. The website was migrated to the MyFox platform on September 14, 2006. On October 15, 2007, KTVI launched STLMoms.com, a website aimed at St. Louis area mothers, whose concept spun off from a popular blog featured on the station&#x27;s main website. Subsequently, on June 2, 2008, KTVI launched GarageSaleSTL.com, a free website that primarily features a Google-based map of viewer-submitted garage sales (the site has since been discontinued).

====Local TV and Tribune ownership====
On December 22, 2007, Fox sold KTVI and seven other owned-and-operated stations—WDAF-TV in Kansas City, WBRC in Birmingham, WGHP in Greensboro–Winston-Salem–High Point, WJW in Cleveland, WITI in Milwaukee, KDVR in Denver and KSTU in Salt Lake City—to Local TV (a broadcast holding company operated by private equity firm Oak Hill Capital Partners that was formed on May 7 of that year to assume ownership of the broadcasting division of The New York Times Company) for $1.1 billion; the sale was finalized on July 14, 2008. On February 1, 2012, WJW redesigned its web site under the new WordPress-hosted design implemented months earlier by sister stations WDAF and WITI, replacing the site design previously used for the Local TV stations that was developed by Tribune Interactive (now Tribune Digital). On July 1, 2013, the Tribune Company (which in 2008, had formed a joint management agreement involving its Tribune Broadcasting subsidiary and Local TV to operate stations owned by both companies and provide web hosting, technical and engineering services to those run by the latter group) acquired the Local TV stations for $2.75 billion; the sale was completed on December 27.

On September 17, 2008, Local TV LLC entered into a local marketing agreement with Tribune Broadcasting, under which it assumed some operational responsibilities for CW affiliate KPLR-TV. The agreement, which took effect on October 1, allowed KTVI to provide advertising and promotional services as well as news operations for KPLR, while Tribune would retain responsibilities over channel 11&#x27;s programming (although both stations would share certain syndicated programs), master control and production services. The LMA resulted from the formation of a &quot;broadcast management company&quot; that was created to provide management services to stations owned by both Tribune and Local TV. Although it was the senior partner in the agreement, KTVI vacated its longtime studios in the Clayton-Tamm/Dogtown neighborhood on St. Louis&#x27; west side and moved its operations to KPLR&#x27;s facility in Maryland Heights (KPLR moved to that building, the larger of the two facilities, in 2003; whereas KTVI had been operating from the Berthold studios for nearly 50 years).

On July 1, 2013, Tribune acquired KTVI and Local TV&#x27;s eighteen other television stations outright for $2.75 billion; the sale received FCC approval on December 20, and was completed on December 27, creating the first legal station duopoly in the St. Louis market between KTVI and KPLR. As FCC rules prohibit the common ownership of two of the four highest-rated television stations in the same market, Tribune&#x27;s direct purchase of KTVI to form a duopoly with KPLR was permissible because KPLR ranked in fifth place in total day ratings at the time of the purchase. (In recent years, KPLR and KDNL – which ranked fourth in the ratings at that time – have rotated between fourth and fifth place in total day viewership due to the weaker viewership of KDNL&#x27;s programming since its news department was shut down by owner Sinclair Broadcast Group in 2001); St. Louis also has only nine full-power television stations, seven of which are commercial outlets, making this the only legal duopoly allowable in the market under FCC rules.

===Aborted sale to Sinclair; sale to Nexstar===

Sinclair—which has owned KDNL-TV since the group&#x27;s 1996 acquisition of its previous corporate parent River City Broadcasting—entered into an agreement to acquire Tribune Media on May 8, 2017, for $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in Tribune debt. Prohibited from owning all three stations, Sinclair would have been required to sell KPLR to a third party to comply with ownership rules and alleviate potential antitrust issues. The deal received significant scrutiny over Sinclair&#x27;s forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties, prompting the FCC to designate it for hearing and leading Tribune to terminate the deal and sue Sinclair for breach of contract.

Following the Sinclair deal&#x27;s collapse, Nexstar Media Group of Irving, Texas, announced its purchase of Tribune Media on December 3, 2018, for $6.4 billion in cash and debt. The sale was completed on September 19, 2019.

==Programming==
KTVI currently carries the majority of the Fox network schedule; however, it delays the network&#x27;s Saturday late night block (currently, as of September 2016, consisting of reruns of Fox prime time reality series) by a half-hour in order to air its 10 p.m. newscast. The station may preempt some Fox programs in order to air long-form breaking news or severe weather coverage, although live sports events may require such coverage to air simultaneously with the scheduled Fox Sports telecast. Fox prime time shows preempted or otherwise interrupted by such content may either be rebroadcast on tape delay over KTVI&#x27;s main channel in place of syndicated programs normally shown during overnight timeslots. Station personnel also gives viewers who subscribe to AT&amp;T U-verse, DirecTV, Dish Network and other pay television providers within the KTVI viewing area the option of watching the affected shows on the Fox Now streaming platforms or its cable/satellite video-on-demand service the day after their initial airing. 

The only two notable program preemptions that KTVI made as a Fox affiliate—outside of those necessitated by extended breaking news or severe weather coverage, special programming, or other scheduling conflicts—have been the brief one of the Fox Kids block and that of the secondary Sunday morning NFL pre-game show &quot;Fox NFL Kickoff&quot;, of which KTVI had declined carriage for the 2015 regular season (the program moved to Fox from Fox Sports 1 in September 2015), with the station&#x27;s second digital subchannel airing it instead in its network-recommended time slot; KTVI began clearing &quot;Fox NFL Kickoff&quot; in September 2016. 

===Fox children&#x27;s programming===
Unlike most of its sister stations under its former New World ownership, KTVI has carried Fox&#x27;s children&#x27;s programming. Upon joining the network in August 1995, it opted not to run the Fox Kids weekday afternoon and Saturday morning blocks, instead airing children&#x27;s programs acquired via syndication on weekend mornings (the preemptions of Fox Kids by the New World stations led the network to change its carriage policies to allow Fox stations uninterested in carrying the block the right of first refusal to transfer the local rights to another station; by 2001, affiliates were no longer required to run the Fox Kids lineup even if Fox had not secured a substitute carrier). Fox Kids originally wanted to be broadcast locally on KPLR, but the offer was turned down by that station&#x27;s then-owner Koplar Communications, because Koplar felt that &quot;they had a strong slate of children&#x27;s programming and no room for the Rangers&quot;. Fox Kids subsequently went unseen in the market, and representatives of the block faced the possibility of piping in KSMO-TV in Kansas City (which aired Fox Kids because WDAF-TV declined carriage of the block) for cable subscribers until September, when Fox Kids arranged for its programming to be aired locally on religious independent KNLC. KNLC then drew the ire of the network by asking children to write to Missouri governor Mel Carnahan to protest the planned execution of Johnny Lee Wilson, then in prison for the 1986 murder of 79-year-old Aurora resident Pauline Martz (Carnahan pardoned Wilson that same month); additionally, KNLC&#x27;s poor signal—both over the air and on cable—angered members of the largest Fox Kids Club in the nation. As a result, Fox Kids moved to KTVI in 1996.

KTVI stopped carrying the Fox Kids weekday block in 1998, although the station retained its Saturday morning lineup via negotiations, although KTVI had to cut to two hours of educational-and-informational programming before cutting back to Fox Kids (this was despite the fact that Fox gave its affiliates the option to push the weekday block to an earlier afternoon timeslot at that period). Fox discontinued its weekday block nationwide on December 31, 2001, while the Saturday lineup was contracted out to 4Kids Entertainment and relaunched as FoxBox on September 14, 2002. In September 2006, KTVI aired the block (by then, renamed 4Kids TV) two hours earlier than most carrier stations to accommodate the station&#x27;s Saturday morning newscast. Fox ended its network-supplied children&#x27;s programming on December 28, 2008, replacing it thereafter with the paid programming block &quot;Weekend Marketplace&quot;. On September 13, 2014, KTVI began carrying &quot;Xploration Station&quot;, a live-action educational program block distributed by Steve Rotfeld Productions that is syndicated primarily to Fox stations, on Saturday mornings through an agreement involving Tribune&#x27;s Fox-affiliated stations.

===Sports programming===
KTVI became the official &quot;home&quot; station of the St. Louis Rams—which had relocated to the city from Los Angeles in 1995 (with the exception of select prime time telecasts on Thursday, Sunday and Monday nights, KTVI broadcast most of the NFL franchise&#x27;s road games as well as most home games against other NFC teams). The station served as the local broadcaster for the Rams&#x27; appearance in Super Bowl XXXVI. KTVI&#x27;s status as the team&#x27;s primary station ended after the 2015 season, as a consequence of NFL team owners voting to approve the Rams&#x27; relocation back to Los Angeles effective with the 2016 NFL season, 30–2.

Since 1996, channel 2 also airs any St. Louis Cardinals games that are broadcast via Fox&#x27;s broadcast contract with Major League Baseball; this included the team&#x27;s World Series victories in 2006 and 2011, and its appearances in the 2004 and 2013 World Series.

===News operation===
KTVI presently broadcasts 68 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with 11½ hours each weekday and 5½ hours on Saturdays, and 5 hours on Sundays); in regards to the number of hours devoted to news programming, it is the highest local newscast output among St. Louis&#x27;s broadcast television stations. KTVI&#x27;s Sunday 5 p.m. newscast is subject to preemption due to network sports coverage, as is standard with Fox stations that carry early evening weekend newscasts (though the Saturday 5 p.m. newscast is usually delayed to 6 p.m. due to baseball or college football coverage).

====News department history====
As an ABC affiliate, KTVI&#x27;s newscasts usually placed third in the ratings, behind longtime leader KSDK (channel 5) and KMOV. However, for most of the 1980s and early 1990s, the station fought a spirited battle with KMOX-TV/KMOV for second place. Since 2009, the station&#x27;s weekday morning newscast has placed first among the newscasts in the St. Louis market during that time period. One of the mainstay evening segments is &quot;You Paid For It&quot; (an investigative segment reported by Elliott Davis that uncovers city government tax abuse; the segment ends by giving the phone number of the office of that municipality&#x27;s mayor, followed by the signoff &quot;Call and speak your mind: after all, you paid for it&quot;).

After joining Fox in August 1995, KTVI increased its news programming output from roughly 30 hours a week to nearly 45 hours. It initially retained a news schedule similar to what it had as an ABC affiliate. All of its existing newscasts were retained, but it expanded its weekday morning newscast from one to three hours (with two hours added from 7 to 9 a.m.), and bridged the weeknight 5 and 6 p.m. newscasts into a 90-minute early evening news block (by adding a half-hour newscast at 5:30 to compensate for Fox&#x27;s lack of a national news program). However, like its Austin sister station KTBC did during its first four years as a Fox station, KTVI did not initially add a prime time newscast at 9 p.m. upon switching to the network to compensate for Fox&#x27;s lack of prime time network programming during that hour; instead, it filled the slot with syndicated programming from the August 1995 switch until September 1997, when it debuted a half-hour 9 p.m. newscast; it continued to air syndicated shows during the 9:30 half-hour until the prime time newscast expanded to one hour in September 1999, now leading directly into the 10 p.m. newscast (KTVI is one of several Fox stations that offer newscasts in both the final hour of prime time and the traditional late news timeslot, one of the few affiliated with the network that runs a nightly 10 p.m. (or 11 p.m.) newscast and one of the few to continue its Big Three-era 10 p.m. newscast after switching to Fox).

In addition to compensating for the absence of daily national newscasts on Fox&#x27;s schedule, the expansion of KTVI&#x27;s news schedule also served to fill timeslots vacated by the departures of &quot;Good Morning America&quot; and &quot;World News Tonight&quot; through its discontinuance of the ABC affiliation. KTVI is able to emphasize a broad array of stories from national and local reports, to investigative stories because of its large news programming output. The station also devotes a sizeable portion of its sports coverage to local high school sports (once partnering with the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; to produce the now-canceled &quot;Prep Sports Show&quot; on Saturdays) and was the home of Jeff Fisher&#x27;s weekly St. Louis Rams review show on Mondays.

For much of the time since it affiliated with Fox until the LMA began, KTVI&#x27;s 9 p.m. newscast had beaten KPLR-TV&#x27;s own prime time news program in that timeslot. Before Dick Ford retired from the station in December 2005, all four of KTVI&#x27;s main male anchors (Ford, Tom O&#x27;Neal, Dan Gray and John Pertzborn) formerly served as anchors at KSDK. On April 10, 2006, KTVI debuted a new standardized graphics package, logo and news theme (&quot;Fox Affiliate News Theme&quot; by OSI Music) that was used by Fox&#x27;s other owned-and-operated stations and select affiliates, during that evening&#x27;s 9 p.m. newscast. A new set and weather center (replacing one built in 1998) was also introduced (the old news desk was donated to Southern Illinois University Carbondale, with the old weather center donated to the University of Missouri–St. Louis). In December 2008, KPLR temporarily relocated its newscasts to KTVI&#x27;s now-former Clayton-Tamm/Dogtown studios as KPLR&#x27;s facility was being remodeled to accommodate both KPLR and KTVI&#x27;s newscasts; KTVI moved production of its newscasts to a temporary set in January 2009, in order for crews dismantle and move the station&#x27;s existing news set to KPLR&#x27;s Maryland Heights facility.

On February 15, 2009, KTVI began broadcasting local newscasts in high definition from its new Maryland Heights studio, accompanied by a new graphics package. The set was updated with several elements added to better fit the new graphics and due to the conversion to HD, while removing the city skyline backdrop in favor of a blue background. In January 2010, KTVI expanded its weekday morning newscast to six hours from 4 to 10 a.m. (despite the expansion, the station retained its 11 a.m. newscast). On December 23, 2011, KTVI/KPLR opened a news bureau in the newly renovated Peabody Opera House in downtown St. Louis, to better serve the downtown and eastern portion of the St. Louis metropolitan area.

On January 28, 2015, both stations introduced a new combined set with LED lighting, two video walls (one replacing the weather green screen), and a new anchor desk. Both stations now share the set (but KPLR uses a separate Weather center). They also introduced new graphics and music package for both stations the same day. KTVI became the first station in the Central Time Zone to launch an 11 p.m. weeknight newscast Hosted by Shirley Washington and Jasmine Huda (formerly of KMOV) the show debuted on January 18, 2016.

In mid-2019, both stations introduced &quot;The Power of Two: Midday&quot;, replacing &quot;Fox 2 News Midday&quot; and &quot;News 11 at Noon&quot;. The program is aired live at 11 a.m. on KTVI and KPLR.

On January 30, 2020, both stations introduced a new graphics package and music package for each station. The music, titled &quot;Beyond&quot;, was created by Stephen Arnold Music, and is largely used by Fox affiliates.

In spring 2020, both stations introduced &quot;The Power of Two at 6 am&quot;, which is simulcast on KTVI and KPLR. While branded for both stations, it is largely targeted towards the KTVI audience, as it is part of &quot;Fox 2 News in The Morning&quot;.

In February 2021, both stations overhauled their set again with an expansion of the physical studio space with multiple venues and a larger video wall. KPLR no longer has a separate weather center, now just appearing on the same set as KTVI.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s digital signal is multiplexed:

KTVI began carrying Antenna TV upon its launch on January 1, 2011, on digital subchannel 2.2. As of January 2016, digital subchannel 2.3 started showing colored bars with a pending affiliation to Escape.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KTVI shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 2, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 43, using virtual channel 2.

As part of the repacking process following the 2016-2017 FCC incentive auction, KTVI relocated to UHF channel 33 in 2020.

<text>Reseda , also known as the mignonette , is a genus of fragrant herbaceous plants native to Europe, southwest Asia and North Africa, from the Canary Islands and Iberia east to northwest India.

==Description==
&quot;Reseda&quot; includes herbaceous annual, biennial and perennial species tall. The leaves form a basal rosette at ground level, and then spirally arranged up the stem; they can be entire, toothed or pinnate, and range from long. The flowers are produced in a slender spike, each flower small ( diameter), white, yellow, orange, or green, with four to six petals. The fruit is a small dry capsule containing several seeds.

==Cultivation and uses==
Propagation is by seed, which is surface-sown directly into the garden or grass verge. The plant does not take well to transplanting and should not be moved after sowing.

Mignonette flowers are extremely fragrant. It is grown for the sweet ambrosial scent of its flowers. It is used in flower arrangements, perfumes and potpourri. A Victorian favourite, it was commonly grown in pots and in window-boxes to scent the city air. It was used as a sedative and a treatment for bruises in Roman times. The volatile oil is used in perfumery. Yellow dye was obtained from the roots of &quot;R. luteola&quot; by the first millennium BC, and perhaps earlier than either woad or madder. Use of this dye came to an end at the beginning of the twentieth century, when cheaper synthetic yellow dyes came into use.

Charles Darwin used &quot;R. odorata&quot; in his studies of self-fertilised plants, which he documented in &quot;The Effects of Cross and Self-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom&quot;.

<text>Critical applied linguistics (CALx) is an interdisciplinary critical approach to English applied linguistics. One of the central concerns in this approach is exposing the political dimensions and power relations involved in mainstream applied linguistics, in areas like language teaching, language policy and planning, language testing, language rights, and so on. The term was first used in 1990 by Alastair Pennycook.

<text>The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) is a public medical school in Charleston, South Carolina. It opened in 1824 as a small private college aimed at training physicians and has since established hospitals and medical facilities across the state. It is one of the oldest continually operating schools of medicine in the United States and the oldest in the Deep South.

The school has expanded into a state university with a medical center and six colleges for the education of health professionals, biomedical scientists, and other health care personnel. It also operates as a center for research and has a public hospital.

==Colleges==

===College of Medicine===

====History====
The College of Medicine began in 1823 with the incorporation of the Medical College of South Carolina, a private institution of the Medical Society of South Carolina. Seven Charleston physicians formed the initial faculty with 30 students enrolled in 1824. The first graduation was on April 4, 1825. With the exception of the American Civil War, the college has served continuously to the present, even when there was a total enrollment of two students. 

At the time of Robert Wilson&#x27;s appointment as dean of the College of Medicine in 1908, Abraham Flexner was beginning his survey of the medical college. Flexner&#x27;s survey resulted in the report titled &quot;Medical Education in the United States and Canada&quot;. It was highly critical of the medical college and its poor facilities, lack of full-time faculty, lack of equipment, and lack of money. Recognizing that the college did not meet national requirements, Wilson determined that the only way to save the college from closure was to transfer it to state ownership in order to have access to state appropriations. The state took over formal control of the college in 1913.

In 1969, twelve African Americans were fired from the hospital, resulting in a two-month-long strike and protest that gathered as many as 10,000 participants, including influential leaders such as Coretta Scott King.

====Degree programs====
The College of Medicine offers a four-year medical curriculum leading to a Doctor of Medicine (M.D.). The college also offers dual-degree programs in conjunction with other colleges and universities. The Colleges of Medicine and Graduate Studies offer a combined M.D./Ph.D degree through the Medical Scientist Training Program as well as an M.D./master&#x27;s degree in clinical research through the Southeastern Predoctoral Training in clinical research. Students can also receive a combined M.D./M.H.A. through the Colleges of Medicine and Health Professions. The college partners with the University of South Carolina and The Citadel to provide an M.D./master&#x27;s in Public Health and M.D./master&#x27;s of Business Administration, respectively.

The college accepts 155–160 students per year into the medical curriculum. The curriculum consists of two years of core basic science instruction followed by two years of clinical training. Students also participate in a longitudinal curriculum that includes instruction in doctoring, physical examination and diagnosis, and biomedical ethics.

===College of Pharmacy===

The Department of Pharmacy was created by an amendment to the charter in 1881, organized in 1882, and discontinued by 1884. Resuming in 1894, the Department of Pharmacy offered the Graduate in Pharmacy (Ph.G.) degree. The current program offers the Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) degree. In 2006, the College of Pharmacy merged with the University of South Carolina&#x27;s College of Pharmacy in Columbia, SC to form the South Carolina College of Pharmacy (SCCP). However, in 2016 the College of Pharmacy at MUSC ended its merger with SCCP. Members of the graduating class of 2020 were the first to receive degrees under the newly separated MUSC College of Pharmacy.

The MUSC College of Pharmacy offers a dual PharmD/MBA program, a consortium between The Citadel Graduate College and MUSC College of Pharmacy. This consortium was originally designed and implemented before the SCCP was formed.

===College of Nursing===

The two-year training course for nurses was started in 1884 at Roper Hospital. The training school was incorporated into the Medical College of South Carolina in 1919 and expanded to three years. Today, the College of Nursing offers a Bachelor of Science in nursing, a Master of Science in nursing, and three doctoral degrees – a PhD (Doctor of Philosophy), and a DNP (Doctor of Nursing Practice).

===College of Graduate Studies===

Graduate instruction began in 1949, with the first Master of Science degree conferred in 1951 and the first Doctor of Philosophy awarded in 1952. The School of Graduate Studies, formally organized in 1965, now offers a variety of programs including neuroscience, biostatistics, epidemiology, molecular and cellular biology, pathology and laboratory medicine, pharmacology, pharmaceutical sciences, microbiology and immunology, and environmental sciences. 

===College of Dental Medicine===

The School of Dental Medicine was authorized in 1953 at the request of the South Carolina Dental Association. Funding delayed the school until 1964. The first class received DMD degrees in 1971.
MUSC recently completed construction of a new, clinical education facility: The James B. Edwards Dental Clinics Building.

===College of Health Professions===

Three hospital-based training programs (Medical Technology, Cytotechnology, and Radiologic Technology) became the nucleus of a Division of Technical Training, recognized as a separate branch of the Medical College in 1964. The School of Allied Health Sciences, now the College of Health Professions, was formally organized in 1966, and expanded to offer over 20 different training options in the paramedical field. The college now offers baccalaureate, masters, and doctoral degree programs.

==MUSC Foundation==

The Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) Foundation was chartered in 1966 as a charitable, educational foundation to support the education, research, patient care and other programs at the Medical University. Most gifts to MUSC are handled by the foundation, which ensures that benefactors receive proper acknowledgment. Gifts of all sizes and types are accepted from alumni, parents and friends of the university as well as corporations and foundations.

==Hospitals==
As MUSC Health the university maintains several hospitals.

===MUSC Health University Medical Center===

The Medical College of South Carolina was one of the first medical schools in the United States to establish, in 1834, an infirmary specifically for teaching purposes. In the 1840s the college also entered into agreements for clinical training opportunities at the Poorhouse, the Marine Hospital, and the local &quot;dispensary.&quot; In 1856, Roper Hospital was opened, and for 100 years Roper was the Medical College&#x27;s primary teaching hospital.

The Medical College recognized the need for its own facilities to expand clinical teaching opportunities, as well as to serve as a major referral center in South Carolina for diagnosis and treatment of disease. The ten-story Medical University Hospital accepted its first patients in 1955. In 1985 the name of the hospital and its clinics was changed to MUSC Health Medical Center, reflecting its function in an academic health institution and its wide range of services to the public. This comprehensive facility now consists of three separate hospitals (the University Hospital, the Institute of Psychiatry, and the Children&#x27;s Hospital). The Medical Center includes centers for specialized care (Heart Center, Transplantation Center, Hollings Cancer Center, Digestive Diseases Center). Numerous outpatient facilities include the Family Medicine Center, University Diagnostic Center, and affiliated faculty practice association ambulatory care centers. In the past ten years, $200 million in capital improvements for the Medical Center focused resources on improved quality of patient care and accessibility of services. In 1993–94 there were over 23,000 inpatient admissions and almost 300,000 outpatient visits.

In 1994, Peter B. Cotton formed the Digestive Disease Center at the Medical University of South Carolina. The center specializes in the management and treatment of digestive diseases. In 2012, it was the first hospital in South Carolina to perform the new LINX Reflux Management System treatment for patients with GERD.

=== MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children&#x27;s Hospital ===

MUSC Shawn Jenkins Children&#x27;s Hospital is a nationally ranked, freestanding acute care women&#x27;s and children&#x27;s hospital in Charleston, South Carolina. It is affiliated with the Medical University of South Carolina. The hospital features all private rooms that consist of 250 pediatric beds and 29 beds for women. The hospital provides comprehensive pediatric specialties and subspecialties to infants, children, teens, and young adults aged 0–21 throughout the Carolinas. The hospital also sometimes treats adults that require pediatric care. The hospital has a rooftop helipad and is an ACS verified level I pediatric trauma center, the only one in South Carolina. The hospital features a regional pediatric intensive-care unit and an American Academy of Pediatrics verified level IV neonatal intensive care unit.

Along with the main hospital in Charleston, MUSC Children&#x27;s operates the ambulatory R. Keith Summey Medical Pavilion with 4 operating rooms and 2 procedure rooms.

=== Others ===
The MUSC board voted to acquire Kershaw Health&#x27;s hospitals and Providence Hospitals in 2021. The hospitals had their names changed, and are now in MUSC Health.

==University status==

Until 1950, the college was headed by a dean, with the schools headed by directors. In 1950, the title of the school&#x27;s chief executive was changed to president, with the six schools headed by deans. In 1969, the state legislature elevated the Medical College to university status. By this act it established MUSC as the state&#x27;s only free standing academic health sciences center, and one of the few institutions of its kind in the nation.

In 1970, the six schools of the university were designated as colleges, each with its separate administration and faculty organization. Each college awards appropriate degrees along standard academic lines connected with its educational activities. All professional education programs, and the MUSC Medical Center, are accredited by the appropriate professional accrediting agency.

==South Carolina Area Health Education Consortium==

One of the most pressing problems in health care delivery and disease prevention across the nation is in the distribution of health professionals. The Medical University serves as the &quot;home&quot; institution for the South Carolina Area Health Education Consortium (AHEC), a statewide consortium of teaching hospitals and rural health education centers. As Dean of the Medical University of South Carolina from 1971 to 1974, J. F. A. McManus provided the impetus for the establishment, with area hospital leaders, of a consortium of statewide hospitals for undergraduate and postgraduate medical education. Since 1972 South Carolina AHEC has influenced the education, supply, retention, and geographic distribution of health care professionals statewide, particularly in smaller, underserved communities. South Carolina AHEC programs include undergraduate and graduate level medical education, nursing, allied health, pharmacy and dental education, as well as all family practice residency programs in the state. South Carolina AHEC maintains partnerships between the university and communities across the state, as evidenced by more than 200 full-time faculty members and hundreds more part-time and consulting faculty who teach in South Carolina AHEC programs in virtually every county of the state.

==Growth in the past 40 years==

In the 93 years since the Medical University became a state institution, its growth was gradual up to the 1940s and phenomenal since then, particularly in the past 40 years. Student enrollments have jumped from 571 in 1965 to almost 2,500 students in the fall of 2006 (not including post doctoral residents in medicine, dental medicine and pharmacy); the full-time faculty has grown from approximately 200 to over 1,000 (including approximately 500 FTE teaching faculty). The library has more than 200,000 bound volumes, approximately 12,600 E-journal subscriptions, and a vast array of online databases &amp; knowledgebases.

More than $200,000,000 of extramural grant awards were received by MUSC in the 2009–2010 fiscal year. 
Expansion in enrollments and programs has been made possible by ambitious programs of physical plant development that have seen the institution grow from one building in 1913 to a medical complex, with more than 89 buildings. Among the many buildings added to the campus was the historic old Charleston Arsenal, acquired in 1963. Since 1985, nine new buildings have been constructed: East Wing and Children&#x27;s Hospital (1986), Institute of Psychiatry (1988), North Tower (1993), Harper Student Center (1993), Hollings Cancer Center (1993), The Strom Thurmond Biomedical Research Center and the Gazes Cardiac Institute (1997) in cooperation with the VA Hospital, Charles P. Darby Children&#x27;s Research Institute (2005), Ashley-Rutledge Parking Garage (2005), and Ashley River Tower (2008). In addition there have been major renovation/addition projects including Storm Eye Institute expansion (1998), Rutledge Tower Ambulatory Care Facility renovation (1998), College of Health Professions Complex (2005), Hollings Cancer Center Tower expansion (2005), and Colcock Hall (2005–2006). The growth of the campus has been made possible, at times, by the demolition of historic properties such as the c. 1820s Bennett Mill&#x27;s overseer&#x27;s house at 76 Barre Street, demolished in 1977 to make way for a parking lot.

The Drug Discovery &amp; Bioengineering Building, part of the James E. Clyburn Research Center, was completed in 2011. This building began a new chapter in South Carolina as it created 78 labs and other facilities to improve biomedical research efforts. The Bioengineering building and the work it will do are in collaboration with Clemson University and the University of South Carolina.

<text>The Alaskan Way Viaduct (&quot;the viaduct&quot; for short) was an elevated freeway in Seattle, Washington, United States, that carried a section of State Route 99 (SR 99). The double-decked freeway ran north–south along the city&#x27;s waterfront for , east of Alaskan Way and Elliott Bay, and traveled between the West Seattle Freeway in SoDo and the Battery Street Tunnel in Belltown.

The viaduct was built in three phases from 1949 through 1959, with the first section opening on April 4, 1953. It was the smaller of the two major north–south traffic corridors through Seattle (the other being Interstate 5), carrying up to 91,000 vehicles per day in 2016. The viaduct ran above Alaskan Way, a surface street, from S. Nevada Street in the south to the entrance of Belltown&#x27;s Battery Street Tunnel in the north, following previously existing railroad lines.

The viaduct had long been viewed as a barrier between downtown and the city&#x27;s waterfront, with proposals to replace it as early as the 1960s. Questions of the structure&#x27;s seismic vulnerability were raised after several earthquakes damaged similar freeways in other cities, including some with the same design as the viaduct. During the 2001 Nisqually earthquake, the Alaskan Way Viaduct suffered minor damage but later inspections found it to be vulnerable to total collapse in the event of another major earthquake, necessitating its replacement.

The state and city governments considered several options, including a rebuilt elevated structure, a surface boulevard, and cut-and-cover tunnel, but could not compromise on a final choice. A deep-bored tunnel was selected in 2009 and the southern section of the viaduct was demolished in 2011 and replaced with a six-lane, single-deck freeway that travels through the SoDo industrial area. Excavation of the downtown bored tunnel by the tunnel boring machine &quot;Bertha&quot; began in 2013 and was completed in 2017 after two years of delays. The viaduct was closed permanently on January 11, 2019, and the new tunnel opened three weeks later on February 4. Demolition of the main viaduct deck began weeks later, and was completed in early 2020 with remaining demolition occurring at the southern approach ramp through 2020 as part of the Waterfront Seattle project.

==Route description==


The Alaskan Way Viaduct was a double-decker freeway that traveled through Downtown Seattle and SoDo along the western waterfront facing Elliott Bay. The two highway decks each carried two to four lanes measuring as narrow as wide, with northbound traffic on the upper deck and southbound traffic using the lower deck with a vertical clearance of . The viaduct was tall, had concrete railings, and was supported by 400 columns spaced approximately every .

SR 99 formerly transitioned from a surface freeway to the double-decker elevated viaduct near South Holgate Street in SoDo, approximately north of the First Avenue South Bridge and beyond an interchange with the West Seattle Freeway near Harbor Island. The freeway then ran between the Port of Seattle&#x27;s Terminal 46 and the Seattle Coast Guard Station to the west and the BNSF Railway container yard to the east. It passed a set of ghost ramps near Safeco Field that were originally planned to accommodate a freeway connection to Interstate 90 that was never built. Near CenturyLink Field, SR 99 reached the terminus of the original (and post-2011) viaduct and the south portal of the future downtown bored tunnel, using a set of diagonal ramps parallel to Railroad Way to reach the central section of the viaduct.

The viaduct expanded from four lanes to six lanes and turned northwest as it followed Alaskan Way and the city&#x27;s waterfront on the west side of Pioneer Square; the area underneath the viaduct was used for street parking between construction periods. It passed east of the state ferry terminal at Colman Dock and reached a set of ramps serving downtown traffic: the Columbia Street onramp to the southbound lanes and the Seneca Street offramp from the northbound lanes. The waterfront section of the viaduct was noted for its scenic views, which include Elliott Bay, the distant Olympic Mountains, and the city&#x27;s skyline. Between the Seattle Aquarium and Pike Place Market, the double-decker viaduct ended as SR 99 split into a pair of side-by-side elevated lanes that traveled over the north portal of the Great Northern railroad tunnel and under Victor Steinbrueck Park. SR 99 then came to an interchange with Elliott and Western avenues, which marked the north end of the viaduct and the south end of the four-lane Battery Street Tunnel. The Western Avenue crossing included a notch in the southbound railing of the viaduct, which was cut out to pass around a column of the Seattle Empire Laundry Building.

The Alaskan Way Viaduct was one of two north–south freeways traversing Downtown Seattle, the other being Interstate 5 to the east. Traffic volumes on the viaduct, measured by WSDOT in terms of average annual daily traffic in 2015, averaged approximately 91,000 vehicles south of Columbia Street and 71,000 vehicles between Columbia Street and Western Avenue. The viaduct formerly carried an average daily volume of 110,000 vehicles until the start of demolition in 2011. The viaduct and other sections of SR 99 were designated as part of the National Highway System by the federal government and as Highway of Statewide Significance by the state legislature.

==History==


The Alaskan Way Viaduct was originally built to carry a section of U.S. Route 99, the main north–south highway in Washington and along the U.S. West Coast. The highway previously used downtown streets, but rising automobile congestion in the 1920s sparked proposals for a limited-access bypass of Seattle. An elevated roadway, placed along the waterfront&#x27;s Railroad Avenue (later renamed Alaskan Way), was recommended by several city engineers in the latter part of the decade. Plans for an elevated highway gained public support in the late 1930s and was approved for construction in 1947 using funds from the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944.

Construction on the viaduct began in February 1950 and was completed in stages between 1953 and 1959. The central portion, from Railroad Way to Elliott Avenue, opened on April 4, 1953. It was connected to the Battery Street Tunnel the following year and a series of offramps and onramps to downtown in the 1960s. Additional ramps to University and Spring streets were included in design plans, but never built. The southern section of the viaduct, linking to the Spokane Street Bridge, was opened in September 1959.

The viaduct officially closed on January 11, 2019, attracting spectators and drivers who caused it to miss the 10 p.m. deadline. Demolition of the northbound ramp on Railroad Way began the following day in preparation for the excavation of pre-constructed ramps into the new tunnel. Demolition was completed in stages between February and November 2019, using a section-by-section approach to avoid major disruptions. The last section to remain standing was near Pike Place Market.

===Earthquake concerns===

The 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake destroyed the similarly designed Cypress Street Viaduct in Oakland, California, with the loss of 42 lives. The 2001 Nisqually earthquake damaged the viaduct and its supporting Alaskan Way Seawall and required the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) to invest US$14.5 million in emergency repairs. Experts gave a 1-in-20 chance that the viaduct could be shut down by an earthquake within the next decade. Semi-annual inspections discovered continuing settlement damage from the Nisqually earthquake up until the viaduct was removed in 2019.

In 2001, the Alaskan Way Viaduct was considered for placement on the National Register of Historic Places by the Washington State Office of Archaeology and Historic Preservation for its historic qualities.

Due to damage from continuing settlement, a group of researchers and faculty from the University of Washington urged the mayor of Seattle (in 2007) to close the viaduct within a four-year timeframe.

===Tunnel planning and construction===
On January 12, 2009, the governments of Washington, King County, the city of Seattle, and the Port of Seattle announced that they had agreed to replace the viaduct with a four-lane, long tunnel. The tunnel would have a south portal in SoDo, near CenturyLink Field, and a north portal near Thomas Street, north of the Battery Street Tunnel.

The project was estimated to cost $4.25 billion, with state, city, and county promised funding well short of the estimate. The state would fund boring of the tunnels, while the city and county would fund surface street improvements and repairs to the Alaskan Way Seawall, which itself was damaged in the Nisqually earthquake. The announcement did little to quell the long and heated debate over the viaduct&#x27;s replacement, with several factions expressing their criticism over the tunnel decision.

Boring of the tunnel by the tunnel boring machine &quot;Bertha&quot; began on July 30, 2013, with the roadway initially scheduled to open in December 2015. Tunneling stopped on December 6, 2013, after the boring machine struck a steel pipe, which obstructed its path into the route. Investigations revealed that the machine had struck a pipe which had been installed in 2002 as a part of an exploratory well used to measure groundwater as part of the planning phases for the project. Boring resumed briefly on January 28–29, 2014, stopping again due to damage to the seal system which protects the machine&#x27;s main bearing and damage to several of the cutting blades. This caused a two-year delay as it was necessary to dig a vertical shaft recovery pit from the surface in order to access and lift the cutterhead for repair and partial replacement.

Work was initially expected to resume by March 2015, but it was December 2015 before tunnelling recommenced. Boring was halted again 23 days later after a sinkhole developed on the ground in front of the machine, but resumed a month later.

In July 2016, a citywide ballot measure attempted to build an elevated park along the waterfront after the demolition of the viaduct, utilizing a portion of the existing structure. The attempt failed, with more than 80 percent of voters in Seattle rejecting the measure. By this time, the tunnel was not expected to be completed until 2019, and had incurred $223 million in cost overruns.

===Opening of new tunnel===

In March 2018, construction of the replacement tunnel was expected to be completed in August 2018, with a planned opening date of October 2018. Cost overruns had reached about $600 million due to the delays in tunnel boring. WSDOT reverted to the tunnel&#x27;s original opening date of early 2019 to accommodate a longer preparation period and avoid potential work delays due to winter weather. On January 11, 2019, the Alaskan Way Viaduct was permanently closed in preparation for the opening of the new tunnel, which required the excavation of several buried ramps at the south portal and other road realignments.

The viaduct was opened to pedestrian traffic on February 2, 2019, and bicycle traffic the day after, as part of a festival to celebrate the freeway&#x27;s history. Over 100,000 people attended the two events, which also included tours of the new tunnel. The replacement tunnel was opened to traffic on February 4, 2019.

===Demolition and replacement===
Demolition of the viaduct began on February 15, 2019, after being delayed by several days due to a severe snowstorm. Contractors began with the upper deck and its columns, followed by the lower deck in a section-by-section process. It was originally scheduled to be completed by June 2019, but a compressed schedule caused by the tunnel&#x27;s delayed opening caused demolition to take longer than expected and conflict with the summer tourism season. Demolition work reached the 50 percent milestone on June 11, with the Pioneer Square and Pike Place Market sections left for the final stages. The final double-deck section of the viaduct, including the Marion Street pedestrian bridge at Colman Dock, was demolished in late September 2019. The final section of the viaduct, removed in November 2019, was over the northern portal of the Great Northern Tunnel near the Pike Place Market.

Demolition work was completed on November 21, 2019, with of concrete recycled and of steel rebar reclaimed. Some of the concrete from the demolition was pulverized and used to fill the Battery Street Tunnel. New development along the waterfront in downtown Seattle, including a park promenade, was planned to be completed by 2021. The full program is scheduled to be completed in 2025 due to delays attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic and a concrete workers&#x27; strike.

<doc id="847469" wikidata="Q7369726" url="?curid=847469" title="Ross Youngs">
<text>Ross Middlebrook &quot;Pep&quot; Youngs (April 10, 1897 – October 22, 1927) was an American professional baseball player. Nicknamed &quot;Pep&quot;, he played ten seasons in Major League Baseball for the New York Giants from 1917 through 1926, playing right field almost exclusively. Youngs was a part of the Giants teams that won four consecutive National League pennants and the 1921 and 1922 World Series.

From Shiner, Texas, Youngs excelled at baseball and American football at the West Texas Military Institute. After beginning his professional career in minor league baseball, Youngs was signed by the Giants in 1916. Youngs had a lifetime .322 batting average with the Giants and batted over .300 nine times in his career, including eight consecutive seasons. His career was cut short by illness, however, as he died at the age of 30 of Bright&#x27;s disease.

Youngs was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1972 by the Veterans Committee. His election was not without controversy, however, as the Veterans Committee consisted of his former teammates, and charges of cronyism were leveled against the committee.

==Early life and minor leagues==
Youngs was born in Shiner, Texas, the second of three children, all sons. His father was a railroad worker, but suffered disability and moved his family to San Antonio where he worked as a rancher. Youngs&#x27; mother ran a small hotel in San Antonio and Youngs had a paper route.

Youngs was educated at West Texas Military Institute. He received offers for scholarships to play college football but passed on these, as he preferred baseball. He made his professional baseball debut for the Austin Senators of the Texas League in 1914. Appearing in 17 games, he hit just .145 for the class-B Senators and, in 1915, found himself down in the Class-D leagues, playing for Brenham of the Middle Texas League and the Waxahachie Athletics of the Central Texas League; both leagues disbanded during the season. In 1916, playing in the infield for the Sherman Lions of the Class-D Western Association, he hit .362 as a switch-hitter, drawing the attention of the New York Giants, who purchased his contract in August for $2,000 ($ in current dollar terms).

==New York Giants==
Youngs reported to spring training in Marlin, Texas with the Giants in 1917. They initially assigned him to the Rochester Hustlers, a team in the International League with which the Giants had a working relationship. Giants manager John McGraw told Mickey Doolan, the manager of the Hustlers, &quot;I&#x27;m giving you one of the greatest players I&#x27;ve ever seen. Play him in the outfield. If anything happens to him, I&#x27;m holding you responsible.&quot; In 140 games with Rochester, Youngs hit .356, earning himself a late-season promotion to the big league club. McGraw gave Youngs the nickname &quot;Pep&quot; due to his hustle and soon began to groom Youngs to become his successor as Giants&#x27; manager.

Youngs made his major league debut on September 25 and played in seven of the last nine games of the season for the eventual National League (NL) pennant-winners: six in center field and one in right. In those seven games he went 9-for-26 (.346) with two doubles and three triples. In 1918, regular Giants right fielder Dave Robertson left the team to manage a local military ballclub, and Youngs was given the full-time job out of spring training. Batting exclusively left-handed, Youngs responded by batting .302 in 121 games, finishing sixth in the league. It would be the first of seven straight seasons in which he hit .300 as a regular, and the second of eight overall counting his brief stint in 1917. He also finished sixth in the NL with a .368 on-base percentage (OBP). The next season Robertson was traded to the Chicago Cubs for pitcher Phil Douglas, leaving Youngs to become a fixture in right field for the Giants. Youngs finished third in the NL in 1919 with a .311 batting average. His .351 batting average in 1920 was second in the NL to Rogers Hornsby.
Youngs batted .327 in 1921, good for ninth in the NL. In Game 3 of the 1921 World Series Youngs became the first player to record two hits in the same inning of a World Series game. The Giants defeated the New York Yankees as Youngs batted .280 in the series. Youngs hit for the cycle on April 29, 1922. He finished the regular season ninth in the NL in OBP (.398) and tied for ninth in stolen bases (17), proceeding to hit .375 in the 1922 World Series as the Giants again defeated the Yankees. Youngs led the NL in runs scored in 1923, with 121, and his .348 batting average was the eighth best in the league. Youngs batted .356 in the 1923 World Series, which the Giants lost to the Yankees.

Youngs batted .356 during the 1924 season, finishing third in the NL. In the final series of this season, the Giants were playing the Philadelphia Phillies at the Polo Grounds and battling for the pennant with the Brooklyn Dodgers. Jimmy O&#x27;Connell, an outfielder for the Giants, offered Phillies shortstop Heinie Sand $500 to intentionally lose the games ($ in current dollar terms). Sand rejected the bribe and reported it to Phillies manager Art Fletcher. It eventually led to the lifetime suspension of O&#x27;Connell and Giants coach Crazy Dolan by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. O&#x27;Connell implicated teammates Youngs, George Kelly, and Frankie Frisch as co-conspirators; Landis, however, cleared the trio of any wrongdoing.

Youngs slumped to a .185 batting average during the 1924 World Series, which the Giants lost to the Washington Senators. Continuing to struggle in 1925, Youngs batted .264, his only season with a batting average below .300, but improved to .306 in 95 games during the 1926 season. Toward the end of his career, Youngs taught Mel Ott, his eventual successor, how to play right field in the Polo Grounds.

==Illness and death==
Youngs&#x27;s career was abruptly cut short in 1926, when he was diagnosed with the kidney disorder that, at the time, was called Bright&#x27;s disease. He had been exposed to streptococcal infection in 1924. Too ill to play after August 10, 1926, Youngs returned home on McGraw&#x27;s insistence and received a blood transfusion in March 1927.

Youngs died of Bright&#x27;s disease on October 22, 1927, at the age of 30. He went from weighing during his playing career to by the time of his death. In Youngs&#x27; obituary in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Giants manager John McGraw called Youngs &quot;the greatest outfielder I ever saw on a ball field.&quot; The Giants honored Youngs with a bronze plaque on the right field wall of the Polo Grounds; although the Giants intended to pay for it, fans expressed their desire to contribute and, even though contributions were limited to $1 per person, donations paid for the plaque entirely.

==Legacy==
Over his ten-year career, Youngs posted 812 runs, 42 home runs, 592 runs batted in (RBI), 153 stolen bases, .322 career batting average, .399 on-base percentage and .441 slugging percentage. He batted .300 or higher in every season until 1925, and higher than .350 twice. Youngs scored 100 or more runs three times and posted a career-high 102 RBI in 1921 and 10 home runs in 1924. During his tenure with the team, the Giants went to the World Series four consecutive years (1921–1924) and won twice (1921, 1922). Youngs was a favorite of McGraw, who kept only two pictures in his office: one of Christy Mathewson and one of Youngs. Rosy Ryan, a teammate with the Giants, and Burleigh Grimes, who played against Youngs as a member of the Brooklyn Dodgers, considered Youngs the best player they ever saw.

Youngs was included in the inaugural balloting for the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1936, but received less than 5% of the vote from the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America (BBWAA). Youngs remained on the ballot every year through 1956, receiving his highest vote total in 1947 with 22%. Ford C. Frick, Commissioner of Baseball, and former teammate Bill Terry both championed Youngs&#x27; candidacy.

Former Giants teammates Terry and Frankie Frisch joined the Veterans Committee in 1967 and aided the elections of several of their former teammates, including Youngs in 1972. In addition to Youngs, Terry and Frisch shepherded the selections of Giants teammates Jesse Haines in 1970, Dave Bancroft and Chick Hafey in 1971, George Kelly in 1973, Jim Bottomley in 1974, and Freddie Lindstrom in 1976. Youngs died at the earliest age of any current Hall of Famer. Youngs is the only member of the National Baseball Hall of Fame from San Antonio and was inducted into the San Antonio Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. Shiner, the town in which Youngs was born, hosted a baseball tournament in his honor at Clipper Field from 2001 through 2003.

Youngs&#x27; selection, along with some of the other selections made by Terry and Frisch, has been considered one of the weakest in some circles. According to the BBWAA, the Veterans Committee was not selective enough in choosing members, and charges of cronyism were later leveled against the committee. This led to the Veterans Committee having its powers reduced in subsequent years. Baseball statistician Bill James recognized this and wrote that Youngs does not belong in the Hall of Fame. In 1981, however, Lawrence Ritter and Donald Honig included Youngs in their book &quot;The 100 Greatest Baseball Players of All Time&quot;. They explained what they called &quot;the Smoky Joe Wood Syndrome&quot;, where a player of truly exceptional talent but a career curtailed by injury or illness should still – in spite of not owning career statistics that would quantitatively rank him with the all-time greats – be included on their list of the 100 greatest players.

==Personal life==
Youngs married Dorothy Pienecke, a woman from Brooklyn who he met while vacationing in the Berkshires, in October 1924. Their daughter Caroline was born in December 1925. Dorothy feuded with Youngs&#x27; mother, however, and the couple separated before the birth of Caroline, whom he never met. Youngs was considered friendly and generous, loaned money constantly, and was reportedly owed $16,000 at the time of his death ($ in current dollar terms). Youngs enjoyed playing golf and was considered the best golfer in the major leagues.

<doc id="847476" wikidata="Q886181" url="?curid=847476" title="The Jewish Chronicle">
<text>The Jewish Chronicle (The JC) is a London-based Jewish weekly newspaper. Founded in 1841, it is the oldest continuously published Jewish newspaper in the world. Its editor () is Daniel Schwammenthal.

The newspaper is published every Friday (except when this is a Jewish holiday, when it appears earlier in the week) providing news, opinion pieces, social, cultural and sports reports, as well as editorials and a spectrum of readers&#x27; opinions on the letter page. The news section of its website is updated several times a day.

The average weekly circulation in 2018 was 20,141, of which 7,298 were free copies, down from 32,875 in 2008. In February 2020, it announced plans to merge with the &quot;Jewish News&quot; but, in April 2020, entered voluntary liquidation and was acquired from the liquidators by a private consortium of political insiders, broadcasters and bankers. The paper&#x27;s political stance under editor Jake Wallis Simons subsequently moved to the right.

In 2024, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that some of the newspaper&#x27;s prominent journalists quit the newspaper due to its purportedly unknown ownership arrangements and alleged publication of &quot;fabricated&quot; stories.

==History==
===19th century===
&quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; first appeared on 12 November 1841. Its first editors were David Meldola and Moses Angel. It was issued as a weekly until May 1842, when it was suspended. From October 1844, it resumed as a fortnightly, with Joseph Mitchell as its editor. In 1847, it became again a weekly newspaper. A. Benisch, who became the proprietor and editor in 1855, bequeathed the paper to the Anglo-Jewish Association in 1878, who sold it to its new editor and anti-Zionist Asher I. Myers, Sydney M. Samuel and Israel David.

In 1881, the leaders of the Jewish community in London were being criticised for not campaigning against the pogroms that were taking place in the Russian Empire. Under the leadership of Francis Henry Goldsmid, the pogroms were not mentioned by the newspaper and it was only after the feminist Louisa Goldsmid gave her support following calls to arms by an anonymous writer named &quot;Juriscontalus&quot; and Asher Myers of &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; that action was taken. Public meetings were then held across the country and Jewish and Christian leaders in Britain spoke out against the atrocities.

===20th century===

In December 1906, L.J. Greenberg, a successful advertising agent and English Zionist leader, contacted the Dutch banker Jacobus Kann with the object of buying &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; to promote Zionism. The same month, Greenberg, together with David Wolffsohn, Joseph Cowen, Jacobus H. Kahn, and Leopold Kessler, bought the shares. Greenberg himself became its editor.

At the time, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; gained a near monopoly in the Jewish press, taking over its principal competitors, &quot;The Hebrew Observer&quot; and &quot;The Jewish World&quot;. Only in October 1919, did &quot;The JC&quot; get a strong opposing voice from &quot;The Jewish Guardian&quot;, paper of the League of British Jews, which counterbalanced the Zionist views of &quot;The JC&quot;, until it disappeared in 1931. After Greenberg died the same year, &quot;The JC&quot; remained moderately pro-Zionist under the leadership of Leopold Kessler.

The weekly newspaper &quot;The Jewish World&quot; was taken over in 1913. It published articles by various Zionist leaders, as well as early non-Jewish pro-Zionists. In 1934, it was merged with &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;. After 1948, the paper maintained a pro-Israel attitude.

In the late 1930s, David F. Kessler became managing director to assist his chairman father Leopold Kessler, a moderate Zionist and an associate of Theodor Herzl, known as the father of the State of Israel. After service as a soldier in World War II during which his father had died, Kessler found that the editor, Ivan Greenberg, had taken a right-wing Zionist position highly critical of moderate Zionists and the British policy in Palestine. Kessler, after a struggle with the newspaper&#x27;s board, sacked Greenberg and installed a moderate editor.

By the early 1960s, the Kessler family owned 80% of the newspaper&#x27;s shares. To safeguard the newspaper&#x27;s future, Kessler created a foundation ownership structure loosely modelled on the Scott Trust, owners of &quot;The Guardian&quot;. Kessler was chairman for nearly 30 years until his death in 1999.

Joseph Finklestone wrote for the paper from 1946 to 1992 in roles including sports editor, chief sub-editor, home news editor, assistant editor, foreign editor, and diplomatic editor.

Geoffrey Paul (&quot;né&quot; Goldstein) was editor between 1977 and 1990.

===21st century===
Editors of &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; have included Ned Temko, 1990 to 2005, Jeff Barak (managing editor, 2006), who returned to Israel, and David Rowan, 2006 to 2008, who joined &quot;The Observer&quot;. Stephen Pollard became editor in November 2008 and editor-at-large in December 2021. He was succeeded as editor by Jake Wallis Simons.

In 2018, the newspaper made a loss of about £1.1 million, following a loss of £460,000 in the previous year. After a number of years of declining circulation and a pension deficit, the reserves of its owners since 1984, the charity The Kessler Foundation, had been exhausted and they planned to introduce revenue and cost measures to reduce losses. According to the editor, the paper had been facing the &quot;real threat&quot; of having to close and the &quot;Press Gazette&quot; reported its situation as &quot;facing a grave closure threat&quot;. Jonathan Goldstein, chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, organised a consortium of 20 individuals, families and charitable trusts to make donations to The Kessler Foundation to enable its continued support of the newspaper. Alan Jacobs, founder of Jacobs Capital, became the new chairman.

In February 2020, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; and &quot;Jewish News&quot; announced plans to merge, subject to raising the necessary finance to support the merger. Combined, they printed more than 40,000 copies weekly.

On 8 April 2020, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; went into liquidation, and both papers announced their intentions to close, due to the COVID lockdown. In April 2020, when the &quot;Chronicle&quot; faced closure due to financial problems during the Covid pandemic, threats to the paper&#x27;s survival were met by sadness and some jubilation, with journalists Jonathan Freedland and Hadley Freeman expressing sorrow, and some Labour supporters welcoming its demise.

The Kessler Trust launched a bid to buy the two papers, giving editorial control to the senior staff of the &quot;News&quot;. However, a £2.5 million counter-offer, supported by the editor, was accepted by the liquidators and trust in what &quot;The Guardian&quot; described as a brief but messy takeover bid. The consortium was led by Robbie Gibb and included John Woodcock, broadcasters Jonathan Sacerdoti and John Ware and Jonathan Kandel, former Charity Commission chairman William Shawcross, Rabbi Jonathan Hughes, Investec&#x27;s corporate and institutional banking chief operating officer Robert Swerling, managing partner at EMK Capital Mark Joseph, and Tom Boltman, head of strategic initiatives at Kovrr, with support from anonymous philanthropists.

The consortium said it was running the paper as a community asset, not for profit, and that it would set up a trust to ensure its editorial independence. The &quot;News&quot; was then taken out of liquidation. However, the identity of other backers in the consortium was unknown, which is highly unusual for a significant UK newspaper. Ware told &quot;The Times&quot; in September 2024, &quot;I, and some others, repeatedly asked to be told who the new funders were. We were told that wouldn’t be possible. I was assured that they were politically mainstream and I trusted those assurances because I trusted who gave them. I didn’t want the paper to fold so I allowed my name to be used, having been told it would help. I had zero managerial, financial or editorial influence, control or input, nor ever have had. It was just a name.&quot; Due to concerns over the publication&#x27;s new editorial line under Wallis Simons, Ware stopped writing for &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; in February 2024, defecting to the &quot;Jewish News.&quot; Former &quot;Chronicle&quot; journalist Lee Harpin said in September 2024 that after the takeover he was told the new owners wanted more views &quot;well to the right of the Tory party&quot;.

Some sources suggested that the funding may have come from a right-wing American billionaire, Paul Singer, known as a &quot;longtime supporter of hawkish pro-Israel causes&quot;, the Likud party, and Benjamin Netanyahu. However, Singer&#x27;s hedge-fund company has denied the claim. There were also concerns about the potential conflict of interest for Gibb, who sat on the BBC&#x27;s editorial standards committee while his JC editor has been critical of the BBC&#x27;s coverage of the Israel-Gaza conflict.

On 15 March 2024, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; announced ownership of the paper would transfer to a newly created charitable trust. In September 2024, its editor told &quot;The Guardian&quot; the ownership transfer had taken place in July 2024, but &quot;The Guardian&quot; could find no evidence of the transfer in Companies House records, and the Charity Commission said that it had no record of an application from &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;. However Jonathan Kandel, a former tax lawyer apparently now associated with investment company Starwood Capital Group, was listed at Companies House as a person with significant control, replacing Jonathan Kandel, and a director of Jewish Chronicle Media.

==== Elon Perry controversy ====
In September 2024, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; removed several articles from its website that had been criticised by Israeli media as fabrications. The nine reports were written by Elon Perry, a freelancer with no apparent track record as a journalist who had provided a questionable résumé. One of his articles claimed Israel had intelligence that Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar was planning to smuggle Israeli hostages to Iran and accompany them there. This echoed a talking point previously raised by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and was seen by commentators in Israel as an attempt to drum up support for Netanyahu&#x27;s unpopular stance in hostage negotiations at the time. IDF spokesperson Daniel Hagari said he was unaware of any intelligence about Sinwar intending to flee to Iran with hostages.

On 15 September 2024, four prominent long-time columnists, David Aaronovitch, David Baddiel, Jonathan Freedland and Hadley Freeman resigned from the newspaper due to their view that it was making political rather than journalistic judgements, and because of the recent fabricated stories. &quot;Sunday Times&quot; journalist Josh Glancy had resigned with similar concerns in 2023.

On 18 September 2024, a &quot;Haaretz&quot; opinion piece by Etan Nechin stated the view that the JC had &quot;increasingly abandoned journalistic integrity in order to champion causes widely associated with the Israeli right&quot; and was &quot;predisposed to deception&quot;.

==Editorial position==
Under the ownership of Asher Myers and Israel Davis, from 1878, the paper was hostile to Zionism, in line with the official positions of the religious and lay leaders of the community. After Leopold Greenberg had taken over the paper in 1906, it became strongly Zionist, and it was made into &quot;a firm and influential champion of Zionism&quot;.

&quot;The JC&quot; supported the 1917 Balfour Declaration, the publication of which was postponed for a week in order to allow &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; to publish its opinion in time. After the Declaration was issued, however, the paper became critical of Chaim Weizmann. Greenberg was discontented with the too vague definition of the Zionist goals and wanted him to state clearly that Palestine must be politically Jewish. He wanted to define the &quot;National Home&quot; as a Jewish Commonwealth. Although JC&#x27;s support of Zionism somewhat decreased after Greenberg&#x27;s death, it has consistently devoted considerable space to Israel and Zionism.

Under Leopold Greenberg, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; was hostile to the Reform and Liberal movements in Britain. Over the years, attention shifted from Orthodoxy in Anglo-Jewry to developments in Progressive Judaism, while becoming more critical of the Orthodox position on halakhic issues.

In 2009, responding to the issue of bias, then-editor Stephen Pollard said &quot;But don&#x27;t forget who our readership is. They are interested in getting the news about Israel. It&#x27;s not a biased view. We are presenting one aspect of all the news that is going on. Nobody gets all their news from &quot;The JC&quot;; we&#x27;re a complementary news source.&quot;

In 2014, he apologised on behalf of the paper for running an advertisement by the Disasters Emergency Committee appealing for funds for humanitarian relief for Gaza. He said that he and the paper did not support the appeal and were &quot;entirely supportive&quot; of Operation Protective Edge. He disputed the reported number of civilian casualties and asserted that many were terrorists.

In June 2019, Pollard said, &quot;I think in the last few years there&#x27;s certainly been a huge need for the journalism that &quot;The JC&quot; does in especially looking at the anti-Semitism in the Labour party and elsewhere&quot; and &quot;there&#x27;s such a huge need for our proper crusading independent journalism&quot;. Kessler Foundation chair Clive Wolman said: &quot;In the end, we and the JC Trust decided that our primary consideration had to be to preserve the editorial independence of &quot;The JC&quot;, particularly at a time when its journalists are playing such an important role in exposing antisemitism in British politics. In July 2019, Pollard said that the Jewish community wants &quot;to see [the current Labour Party leadership] removed from any significant role in public life.&quot;

In 2024, an unnamed consortium member characterised the Jewish Chronicle&#x27;s editorial position on Israel as &quot;my country, right or wrong&quot;, describing its editor, Wallis Simons, as &quot;behaving like a political activist, not a journalist&quot;.

==Reception==
In September 2014, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; published an editorial alleging the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA) voted for a ban on Israelis joining the International Union of Architects (IUA) and was in effect a &quot;ban on Jews&quot; and thus antisemitic. The RIBA motion had called for the suspension of the Israeli Association of United Architects over the building of illegal settlements in Palestine. Following a complaint to the Press Complaints Commission, the &quot;Chronicle&quot; published a letter of response from David Mond, in which he accused the paper of inspiring &quot;its readers to see antisemitism in every critic&quot; of Israel.

In August 2016, dozens of prominent Jewish activists including Miriam Margolyes, Ilan Pappe and Michael Rosen signed an open letter censuring the newspaper for what they accused of being &quot;McCarthyite&quot; &quot;character assassination&quot; of Jeremy Corbyn after the paper published &quot;seven key questions&quot; for Corbyn, including on his ties to Holocaust deniers, featuring his referral of the Hamas and Hezbollah to as &quot;friends&quot;.

In December 2019, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; published an article by Melanie Phillips, asserting that Islamophobia was a bogus term to provide cover for antisemites. The Board of Deputies of British Jews described its publication as an &quot;error&quot;. Editor Stephen Pollard acknowledged that &quot;A number of people within the Jewish community, and friends of the community, have expressed their dismay – and anger – at its content.&quot;

When &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; faced closure due to financial problems in April 2020, former ANC politician and anti-apartheid activist Andrew Feinstein alleged: &quot;&quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;″s equating of antisemitism with criticism of Israel has put back the struggle against real AS &amp; all racism by years.&quot; while the freelance journalist Mira Bar-Hillel rejoiced at the paper&#x27;s potential closure as &quot;the best news of the day&quot;, accusing it of being a &quot;pathetic rag&quot;.

In July 2021, a letter was sent to the British press regulatory body IPSO requesting a standards investigation into &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; due to what the signatories believed to be &quot;systemic&quot; failings. The nine signatories were mostly linked to the Labour party and had complaints about factually inaccurate reporting upheld by the regulator between 2018 and 2021 or, in three instances, had been libelled by the paper. The complainants alleged that the paper&#x27;s editorial standards were &quot;shockingly low&quot; and stated that &quot;unless standards there improve there will be more victims, while readers will continue to be misled.&quot;

Writing in the &quot;Byline Times&quot;, Brian Cathcart, Professor of Journalism at Kingston University, argued that IPSO had failed to act on &quot;the collapse of journalism standards at &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;&quot;, which he stated had &quot;been found by the IPSO itself to have breached its code of practice 28 times.&quot; He suggested IPSO&#x27;s failure to act was in part due to the regulator&#x27;s unwillingness to attract accusations of attempting to silence the paper from the Conservative Party, who benefitted politically from the debate around antisemitism in the Labour Party in which the paper was a prominent player. He also identified &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;″s owner Robbie Gibb as an obstacle to an IPSO investigation into standards at the paper.

In 2021, some members of the Wikipedia community debated &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;&#x27;s impartiality in its coverage of pro-Palestinian activism led by Western leftist and Muslim groups. It was declared as generally reliable.

==Lawsuits and rulings==
In 1968, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; published an article by Labour MP Maurice Edelman saying that another Labour MP, Christopher Mayhew, had made antisemitic comments on a television programme. Mayhew sued for libel, arguing that his comments were anti-Zionist, but not antisemitic. He dropped the case after receiving a public apology from both Edelman and the newspaper in the High Court. A complaint by Mayhew to the Press Council in April 1971, about the editing of a published letter to the editor, was denied.

In 2009, an International Solidarity Movement activist accepted £30,000 damages and an apology from the paper over a letter it had published claiming that he had harboured two suicide bombers.

In August 2017, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; published an adjudication by the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) as a result of an court report that the newspaper had published. The regulator considered the article had breached clause 9 the Editors&#x27; Code of Practice, which relates to the reporting of crime. IPSO ruled that the JC had published details of the family members of the defendant without valid justification.

In August 2019, the British charity Palestinian Relief and Development Fund (Interpal) received an apology, damages of £50,000 and legal costs after &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; published &quot;false and defamatory allegations&quot;, implying that it had links to terrorist activity. On 23 August, the paper published a full apology, together with an article by Ibrahim Hewitt, chair of trustees of Interpal.

In November 2019, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; published a ruling by IPSO that it had breached the Editors&#x27; Code of Practice in relation to claims in four articles about a Labour Party member published in early 2019. IPSO also expressed significant concerns about the newspaper&#x27;s failure to answer IPSO&#x27;s questions and said it considered that the publication&#x27;s conduct during the investigation was not appropriate. In February 2020, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; acknowledged that they had made untrue allegations, for which they apologised, and agreed to pay damages and legal costs.

In September 2020, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; published an apology to a councillor about whom the newspaper had printed numerous allegations. The newspaper asserted that the councillor was involved in inviting an activist, who it deemed to be antisemitic, to a Labour Party event; that the councillor ignored &quot;antisemitic statements&quot; made by a fellow activist; and that the councillor had &quot;launched a vicious protest against Luciana Berger in terms suggestive of antisemitism&quot; and had tried to &quot;improperly interfere with a democratic vote at a regional Labour Party meeting&quot;. In addition to the apology, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot;, its editor Stephen Pollard, and senior reporter Lee Harpin paid substantial libel damages and the legal costs.

In March 2021, &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; printed an article about political activist and journalist Marc Wadsworth which stated that he was involved in a &quot;conspiracy to intimidate, threaten or harass Jewish activists into silence&quot; in an online meeting of the Labour in Exile Network. In reality Wadsworth had not attended the meeting, had issued no such threats and was not a member of the Labour in Exile Network. The newspaper admitted the story was false in all respects, issued an apology, and agreed to pay substantial damages and legal costs. The presiding judge stated “This was a serious mistake for the Jewish Chronicle to have made.” Following the libel verdict, the &quot;Morning Star&quot; printed an extract from Wadsworth&#x27;s statement, in which he said he was &quot;deeply distressed that &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; did not check its facts or contact me before its article was written.&quot;

In August 2021 &quot;The Telegraph&quot; said that eight complaints to IPSO about the paper had been upheld, two were not upheld, and two were resolved through mediation in the preceding three years, while Brian Cathcart, for the &quot;Byline Times&quot;, said the paper had 33 breaches of the Editors Code within a similar timeframe.

In November 2022 &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; published an opinion column by Zoe Strimpel that included a statement that &quot;the Islamic Republic [of Iran] has repeatedly vowed to wipe Israel and Jews off the face of the Earth&quot;. In April 2023 IPSO ruled that this was inaccurate, and hence breached Clause 1 of the Editors&#x27; Code of Practice. IPSO ordered &quot;The JC&quot; to publish a correction, equal in prominence to the original column.

In April 2023, IPSO upheld a complaint on behalf of Rabbi Yisroel Dovid Weiss about whom &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; twice (online and in print) wrote a claim of Holocaust denial. The claim had initially been made by Associated Press but was retracted in 2007. &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; knew this in advance of publication. IPSO upheld complaints under Accuracy Clause 1; they considered the newspaper&#x27;s behaviour &quot;unacceptable&quot; and reported their &quot;significant concerns&quot; to IPSO&#x27;s Standards department.

IPSO&#x27;s 2023 annual statement recorded that &quot;The Jewish Chronicle&quot; had the second equal most breaches of its Editors’ Code by all newspapers that year, with four breaches, one less than &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

<doc id="847477" wikidata="Q4757251" url="?curid=847477" title="Andrew Harvey (religious writer)">
<text>Andrew Harvey (born June 9, 1952) is a British author, religious scholar and teacher of mystic traditions, known primarily for his popular nonfiction books on spiritual or mystical themes, beginning with his 1983 &quot;A Journey in Ladakh&quot;. He is the author of over 30 books, including, &quot;The Hope, A Guide to Sacred Activism&quot;, &quot;The Direct Path&quot;, the critically acclaimed &quot;Way of Passion: A Celebration of Rumi&quot;, &quot;The Return of the Mother&quot; and &quot;Son of Man&quot;. He was the subject of the 1993 BBC documentary &quot;The Making of a Modern Mystic&quot; and is the founder of the Sacred Activism movement.

Harvey lives in Chicago, Illinois, where he continues to write when he is not lecturing. Harvey conducts workshops on Sacred Activism, the teachings of Rumi, yoga and practices that will lead to deeper spiritual awareness. Harvey travels with students to sacred sites in India, Australia and South Africa, and offers personal spiritual direction. Harvey was listed as number 33 in the Watkins&#x27; Mind Body Spirit magazine as one of the 100 Most Spiritually Influential Living People in 2012. In 2012, he was nominated for the Templeton Prize, which was awarded to the Dalai Lama.

==Early life and education==
Harvey was born in Coimbatore, India in 1952 and lived there until he was nine years old. He was educated at English boarding schools and then the University of Oxford, where he later taught Shakespeare and French literature until 1977. He wrote his dissertation on madness in Shakespeare and Erasmus.

==Career==
At 21 in the early 1970s, Harvey became a fellow of All Souls College, Oxford. By 1977 he had become disillusioned with life at Oxford and returned to India, where a series of mystical experiences initiated his spiritual journey. Over the next thirty years he plunged into different mystical traditions to learn their secrets and practices. In 1978 he met a succession of Indian saints and sages and began his study and practice of Hinduism. In 1983, in Ladakh, he met a Tibetan adept, Thuksey Rinpoche, and undertook with him the Mahayana Buddhist bodhisattva vows; later, in 1990, he would collaborate with Sogyal Rinpoche and Patrick Gaffney in the writing of &quot;The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying&quot;. In 1984, Harvey began a ten-year-long exploration and explication of Rumi and Sufi mysticism in Paris with a group of French Sufis under the guidance of Eva de Vitray-Meyerovitch, the translator of Rumi into French. In 1992, he met Father Bede Griffiths in his ashram in south India near where Harvey had been born. It was this meeting that helped him synthesize the whole of his mystical explorations and reconcile Eastern with Western mysticism. 
While in India, Harvey encountered Mother Meera, who became his guru and the subject of his book &quot;Hidden Journey&quot;. His memoir, &quot;The Sun at Midnight&quot;, describes their subsequent break and his disillusionment with gurus.

For the last 30 years, Harvey has travelled widely, living in India, London, Paris, New York and San Francisco, studying, teaching at university level and in seminars and workshops. A prolific writer, Harvey has authored or co-authored over 30 books. His focus since 2005 has been the advocacy of what he terms &quot;Sacred Activism&quot;. He is the founder and director of the Institute of Sacred Activism, which trains leaders and social justice advocates.

==Teachings==
Harvey is a scholar of mystic traditions. He envisions true spirituality to be the divinisation of earthly life through spiritual practice. These practices can take many forms and can be taken from religious traditions.
Harvey sees six poets and religious figures as having universal appeal:
:*Shakyamuni Buddha as portrayed in the &quot;Dhammapada&quot;
:*Jesus as portrayed in the &quot;Gospel of Thomas&quot;
:*Rumi, a 13th century Sufi poet. 
:*Kabir, a 15th century Indian poet
:*Ramakrishna, a 19th century Hindu sadhu
:*Aurobindo, a 20th century Hindu philosopher-sage

Harvey also emphasises the Divine Feminine, as expressed in the Virgin Mary, Kali, the Black Madonna, and Mother Earth.

Since 2005, Andrew Harvey&#x27;s work has focused on teaching Sacred Activism around the globe. Harvey describes sacred activism as &quot;the product of the union of a profound spiritual and mystical knowledge, understanding, and compassion, peace and energy, with focused, wise, radical action in the world.&quot;

<doc id="847478" wikidata="Q579128" url="?curid=847478" title="Duration (finance)">
<text>In finance, the duration of a financial asset that consists of fixed cash flows, such as a bond, is the weighted average of the times until those fixed cash flows are received.
When the price of an asset is considered as a function of yield, duration also measures the price sensitivity to yield, the rate of change of price with respect to yield, or the percentage change in price for a parallel shift in yields.

The dual use of the word &quot;duration&quot;, as both the weighted average time until repayment and as the percentage change in price, often causes confusion. Strictly speaking, Macaulay duration is the name given to the weighted average time until cash flows are received and is measured in years. Modified duration is the name given to the price sensitivity. It is (-1) times the rate of change in the price of a bond as a function of the change in its yield.

Both measures are termed &quot;duration&quot; and have the same (or close to the same) numerical value, but it is important to keep in mind the conceptual distinctions between them. Macaulay duration is a time measure with units in years and really makes sense only for an instrument with fixed cash flows. For a standard bond, the Macaulay duration will be between 0 and the maturity of the bond. It is equal to the maturity if and only if the bond is a zero-coupon bond.

Modified duration, on the other hand, is a mathematical derivative (rate of change) of price and measures the percentage rate of change of price with respect to yield. (Price sensitivity with respect to yields can also be measured in absolute (dollar or euro, etc.) terms, and the absolute sensitivity is often referred to as dollar (euro) duration, DV01, BPV, or delta (δ or Δ) risk). The concept of modified duration can be applied to interest-rate-sensitive instruments with non-fixed cash flows and can thus be applied to a wider range of instruments than can Macaulay duration. Modified duration is used more often than Macaulay duration in modern finance.

For everyday use, the equality (or near-equality) of the values for Macaulay and modified duration can be a useful aid to intuition. For example, a standard ten-year coupon bond will have a Macaulay duration of somewhat but not dramatically less than 10 years and from this, we can infer that the modified duration (price sensitivity) will also be somewhat but not dramatically less than 10%. Similarly, a two-year coupon bond will have a Macaulay duration of somewhat below 2 years and a modified duration of somewhat below 2%.

==Macaulay duration==
Macaulay duration, named for Frederick Macaulay who introduced the concept, is the weighted average maturity of cash flows, in which the time of receipt of each payment is weighted by the present value of that payment. The denominator is the sum of the weights, which is precisely the price of the bond. Consider some set of fixed cash flows. The present value of these cash flows is:

:formula_1

The Macaulay duration is defined as:

:(1)     formula_2

where:
* formula_3 indexes the cash flows,
* formula_4 is the present value of the formula_3th cash payment from an asset,
* formula_6 is the time in years until the formula_3th payment will be received,
* formula_8 is the present value of all future cash payments from the asset.

In the second expression the fractional term is the ratio of the cash flow formula_4 to the total PV. These terms add to 1.0 and serve as weights for a weighted average. Thus the overall expression is a weighted average of time until cash flow payments, with weight formula_10 being the proportion of the asset&#x27;s present value due to cash flow formula_3.

For a set of all-positive fixed cash flows the weighted average will fall between 0 (the minimum time), or more precisely formula_12 (the time to the first payment) and the time of the final cash flow. The Macaulay duration will equal the final maturity if and only if there is only a single payment at maturity. In symbols, if cash flows are, in order, formula_13, then:
:formula_14
with the inequalities being strict unless it has a single cash flow. In terms of standard bonds (for which cash flows are fixed and positive), this means the Macaulay duration will equal the bond maturity only for a zero-coupon bond.

Macaulay duration has the diagrammatic interpretation shown in figure 1. 
This represents the bond discussed in the example below - two year maturity with a coupon of 20% and continuously compounded yield of 3.9605%. The circles represent the present value of the payments, with the coupon payments getting smaller the further in the future they are, and the final large payment including both the coupon payment and the final principal repayment. If these circles were put on a balance beam, the fulcrum (balanced center) of the beam would represent the weighted average distance (time to payment), which is 1.78 years in this case.

For most practical calculations, the Macaulay duration is calculated using the yield to maturity to calculate the formula_15:

:(2)     formula_16

:(3)     formula_17

where:
* formula_3 indexes the cash flows,
* formula_4 is the present value of the formula_3th cash payment from an asset,
* formula_21 is the cash flow of the formula_3th payment from an asset,
* formula_23 is the yield to maturity (continuously compounded) for an asset,
* formula_6 is the time in years until the formula_3th payment will be received,
* formula_8 is the present value of all cash payments from the asset until maturity.

Macaulay gave two alternative measures:
* Expression (1) is Fisher–Weil duration which uses zero-coupon bond prices as discount factors, and
* Expression (3) which uses the bond&#x27;s yield to maturity to calculate discount factors.

The key difference between the two durations is that the Fisher–Weil duration allows for the possibility of a sloping yield curve, whereas the second form is based on a constant value of the yield formula_23, not varying by term to payment. With the use of computers, both forms may be calculated but expression (3), assuming a constant yield, is more widely used because of the application to modified duration.

===Duration versus Weighted Average Life===
Similarities in both values and definitions of Macaulay duration versus Weighted Average Life can lead to confusing the purpose and calculation of the two. For example, a 5-year fixed-rate interest-only bond would have a Weighted Average Life of 5, and a Macaulay duration that should be very close. Mortgages behave similarly. The differences between the two are as follows: 
# Macaulay duration only measures fixed period cash flows, Weighted Average Life factors in all principal cash flows whether they be in fixed or floating. Thus for Fixed Period Hybrid ARM mortgages, for modeling purposes, the entire fixed period ends on the date of the last fixed payment or the month prior to reset.
# Macaulay duration discounts all cash flows at the corresponding cost of capital. Weighted Average Life does not discount.
# Macaulay duration uses both principal and interest when weighting cash flows. Weighted Average Life only uses principal.

==Modified duration==
In contrast to Macaulay duration, modified duration (sometimes abbreviated MD) is a price sensitivity measure, defined as the percentage derivative of price with respect to yield (the logarithmic derivative of bond price with respect to yield). Modified duration applies when a bond or other asset is considered as a function of yield. In this case one can measure the logarithmic derivative with respect to yield:

: formula_28

When the yield is expressed continuously compounded, Macaulay duration and modified duration are numerically equal. To see this, if we take the derivative of price or present value, expression (2), with respect to the continuously compounded yield formula_23 we see that:

: formula_30

In other words, for yields expressed continuously compounded,

:formula_31.

where:
* formula_3 indexes the cash flows,
* formula_6 is the time in years until the formula_3th payment will be received,
* formula_8 is the present value of all cash payments from the asset.

===Periodically compounded===
In financial markets, yields are usually expressed periodically compounded (say annually or semi-annually) instead of continuously compounded. Then expression (2) becomes:
:formula_36

:formula_37

To find modified duration, when we take the derivative of the value formula_8 with respect to the periodically compounded yield we find

:formula_39

Rearranging (dividing both sides by ) gives:

:formula_40

which is the well-known relationship between modified duration and Macaulay duration:

:formula_41

where:
* formula_3 indexes the cash flows,
* formula_43 is the compounding frequency per year (1 for annual, 2 for semi-annual, 12 for monthly, 52 for weekly, etc.),
* formula_21 is the cash flow of the formula_3th payment from an asset,
* formula_6 is the time in &quot;years&quot; until the formula_3th payment will be received (e.g. a two-year semi-annual would be represented by a formula_6 index of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0),
* formula_49 is the yield to maturity for an asset, periodically compounded
* formula_8 is the present value of all cash payments from the asset.

This gives the well-known relation between Macaulay duration and modified duration quoted above. It should be remembered that, even though Macaulay duration and modified duration are closely related, they are conceptually distinct. Macaulay duration is a weighted average time until repayment (measured in units of time such as years) while modified duration is a price sensitivity measure when the price is treated as a function of yield, the &quot;percentage change&quot; in price with respect to yield.

=== Units ===

Macaulay duration is measured in years.

Modified duration is measured as the percent change in price per one unit (percentage &quot;point&quot;) change in yield per year (for example yield going from 8% per year (y = 0.08) to 9% per year (y = 0.09)). This will give modified duration a numerical value close to the Macaulay duration (and equal when rates are continuously compounded).

Formally, modified duration is a , the &quot;percent&quot; change in price for a &quot;unit&quot; change in yield, rather than an elasticity, which is a percentage change in output for a &quot;percentage&quot; change in input. Modified duration is a rate of change, the percent change in price per change in yield.

===Non-fixed cash flows===
Modified duration can be extended to instruments with non-fixed cash flows, while Macaulay duration applies only to fixed cash flow instruments. Modified duration is defined as the logarithmic derivative of price with respect to yield, and such a definition will apply to instruments that depend on yields, whether or not the cash flows are fixed.

===Finite yield changes===
Modified duration is defined above as a derivative (as the term relates to calculus) and so is based on infinitesimal changes. Modified duration is also useful as a measure of the sensitivity of a bond&#x27;s market price to finite interest rate (i.e., yield) movements. For a small change in yield, formula_51,

: formula_52

Thus modified duration is approximately equal to the percentage change in price for a given finite change in yield. So a 15-year bond with a Macaulay duration of 7 years would have a modified duration of roughly 7 years and would fall approximately 7% in value if the interest rate increased by one percentage point (say from 7% to 8%).

== Fisher–Weil duration ==
Fisher–Weil duration is a refinement of Macaulay’s duration which takes into account the term structure of interest rates. Fisher–Weil duration calculates the present values of the relevant cashflows (more strictly) by using the zero coupon yield for each respective maturity.

== Key rate duration ==

Key rate durations (also called partial DV01s or partial durations) are a natural extension of the total modified duration to measuring sensitivity to shifts of different parts of the yield curve. Key rate durations might be defined, for example, with respect to zero-coupon rates with maturity &#x27;1M&#x27;, &#x27;3M&#x27;, &#x27;6M&#x27;, &#x27;1Y&#x27;, &#x27;2Y&#x27;, &#x27;3Y&#x27;, &#x27;5Y&#x27;, &#x27;7Y&#x27;, &#x27;10Y&#x27;, &#x27;15Y&#x27;, &#x27;20Y&#x27;, &#x27;25Y&#x27;, &#x27;30Y&#x27;. Thomas Ho (1992) introduced the term key rate duration. Reitano covered multifactor yield curve models as early as 1991 and has revisited the topic in a recent review.

Key rate durations require that we value an instrument off a yield curve and requires building a yield curve. Ho&#x27;s original methodology was based on valuing instruments off a zero or spot yield curve and used linear interpolation between &quot;key rates&quot;, but the idea is applicable to yield curves based on forward rates, par rates, and so forth. Many technical issues arise for key rate durations (partial DV01s) that do not arise for the standard total modified duration because of the dependence of the key rate durations on the specific type of the yield curve used to value the instruments (see Coleman, 2011 ).

==Bond formulas==
For a standard bond with fixed, semi-annual payments the bond duration closed-form formula is:

: formula_53

* &quot;FV&quot; = par value
* &quot;C&quot; = coupon payment per period (half-year)
* &quot;i&quot; = discount rate per period (half-year)
* &quot;a&quot; = fraction of a period remaining until next coupon payment
* &quot;m&quot; = number of full coupon periods until maturity
* &quot;P&quot; = bond price (present value of cash flows discounted with rate &quot;i&quot;)

For a bond with coupon frequency formula_43 but an integer number of periods (so that there is no fractional payment period), the formula simplifies to:
:formula_55

where
* &quot;y&quot; = Yield (per year, in percent),
* &quot;c&quot; = Coupon (per year, in decimal form),
* &quot;m&quot; = Number of coupon periods.

=== Example 1 ===
Consider a 2-year bond with face value of $100, a 20% semi-annual coupon, and a yield of 4% semi-annually compounded. The total PV will be:

:formula_56

::formula_57

The Macaulay duration is then

:formula_58.

The simple formula above gives (y/k =.04/2=.02, c/k = 20/2 = 10):

:formula_59

The modified duration, measured as percentage change in price per one percentage point change in yield, is:

:formula_60 (% change in price per 1 percentage point change in yield)

The DV01, measured as dollar change in price for a $100 nominal bond for a one percentage point change in yield, is

:formula_61 ($ per 1 percentage point change in yield)

where the division by 100 is because modified duration is the percentage change.

=== Example 2 ===
Consider a bond with a $1000 face value, 5% coupon rate and 6.5% annual yield, with maturity in 5 years. The steps to compute duration are the following:

1. Estimate the bond value
The coupons will be $50 in years 1, 2, 3 and 4. Then, on year 5, the bond will pay coupon and principal, for a total of $1050. Discounting to present value at 6.5%, the bond value is $937.66. The detail is the following:

Year 1: $50 / (1 + 6.5%) ^ 1 = 46.95

Year 2: $50 / (1 + 6.5%) ^ 2 = 44.08

Year 3: $50 / (1 + 6.5%) ^ 3 = 41.39

Year 4: $50 / (1 + 6.5%) ^ 4 = 38.87

Year 5: $1050 / (1 + 6.5%) ^ 5 = 766.37

2. Multiply the time each cash flow is received, times its present value

Year 1: 1 * $46.95 = 46.95

Year 2: 2 * $44.08 = 88.17

Year 3: 3 * $41.39 = 124.18

Year 4: 4 * $38.87 = 155.46

Year 5: 5 * 766.37 = 3831.87

TOTAL: 4246.63

3. Compare the total from step 2 with the bond value (step 1)

Macaulay duration: 4246.63 / 937.66 = 4.53

== Money duration ==
The &#x27;, or &#x27; or Bloomberg &#x27;, also called &#x27; or in the United States, is defined as negative of the derivative of the value with respect to yield:

: formula_62

so that it is the product of the modified duration and the price (value):

: formula_63 ($ per 1 percentage point change in yield)

or

: formula_64 ($ per 1 basis point change in yield)

The DV01 is analogous to the delta in derivative pricing (one of the &quot;Greeks&quot;) – it is the ratio of a price change in output (dollars) to unit change in input (a basis point of yield). Dollar duration or DV01 is the change in price in &quot;dollars,&quot; not in &quot;percentage.&quot; It gives the dollar variation in a bond&#x27;s value per unit change in the yield. It is often measured per 1 basis point - DV01 is short for &quot;dollar value of an 01&quot; (or 1 basis point). 
The name BPV (basis point value) or Bloomberg &quot;Risk&quot; is also used, often applied to the dollar change for a $100 notional for 100bp change in yields - giving the same units as duration. 
PV01 (present value of an 01) is sometimes used, although PV01 more accurately refers to the value of a one dollar or one basis point annuity. (For a par bond and a flat yield curve the DV01, derivative of price w.r.t. yield, and PV01, value of a one-dollar annuity, will actually have the same value.)
DV01 or dollar duration can be used for instruments with zero up-front value such as interest rate swaps where percentage changes and modified duration are less useful.

=== Application to value-at-risk (VaR) ===
Dollar duration formula_65 is commonly used for value-at-risk (VaR) calculation. To illustrate applications to portfolio risk management, consider a portfolio of securities dependent on the interest rates formula_66 as risk factors, and let

: formula_67

denote the value of such portfolio. Then the exposure vector formula_68 has components

: formula_69

Accordingly, the change in value of the portfolio can be approximated as

: formula_70

that is, a component that is linear in the interest rate changes plus an error term which is at least quadratic. This formula can be used to calculate the VaR of the portfolio by ignoring higher order terms. Typically cubic or higher terms are truncated. Quadratic terms, when included, can be expressed in terms of (multi-variate) bond convexity. One can make assumptions about the joint distribution of the interest rates and then calculate VaR by Monte Carlo simulation or, in some special cases (e.g., Gaussian distribution assuming a linear approximation), even analytically. The formula can also be used to calculate the DV01 of the portfolio (cf. below) and it can be generalized to include risk factors beyond interest rates.

==Risk – duration as interest rate sensitivity==

The primary use of duration (modified duration) is to measure interest rate sensitivity or exposure. Thinking of risk in terms of interest rates or yields is very useful because it helps to normalize across otherwise disparate instruments. Consider, for example, the following four instruments, each with 10-year final maturity:

All four have a 10-year maturity, but the sensitivity to interest rates, and thus the risk, will be different: the zero-coupon has the highest sensitivity and the annuity the lowest.

Consider first a $100 investment in each, which makes sense for the three bonds (the coupon bond, the annuity, the zero-coupon bond - it does not make sense for the interest rate swap for which there is no initial investment). Modified duration is a useful measure to compare interest rate sensitivity across the three. The zero-coupon bond will have the highest sensitivity, changing at a rate of 9.76% per 100bp change in yield. This means that if yields go up from 5% to 5.01% (a rise of 1bp) the price should fall by roughly 0.0976% or a change in price from $61.0271 per $100 notional to roughly $60.968. The original $100 invested will fall to roughly $99.90. The annuity has the lowest sensitivity, roughly half that of the zero-coupon bond, with a modified duration of 4.72%.

Alternatively, we could consider $100 notional of each of the instruments. In this case the BPV or DV01 (dollar value of an 01 or dollar duration) is the more natural measure. The BPV in the table is the dollar change in price for $100 notional for 100bp change in yields. The BPV will make sense for the interest rate swap (for which modified duration is not defined) as well as the three bonds.

Modified duration measures the &quot;size&quot; of the interest rate sensitivity. Sometimes we can be misled into thinking that it measures &quot;which part&quot; of the yield curve the instrument is sensitive to. After all, the modified duration (% change in price) is almost the same number as the Macaulay duration (a kind of weighted average years to maturity). For example, the annuity above has a Macaulay duration of 4.8 years, and we might think that it is sensitive to the 5-year yield. But it has cash flows out to 10 years and thus will be sensitive to 10-year yields. If we want to measure sensitivity to parts of the yield curve, we need to consider key rate durations.

For bonds with fixed cash flows a price change can come from two sources:

# The passage of time (convergence towards par). This is of course totally predictable, and hence not a risk.
# A change in the yield. This can be due to a change in the benchmark yield, and/or change in the yield spread.
The yield-price relationship is inverse, and the modified duration provides a very useful measure of the price sensitivity to yields. As a first derivative it provides a linear approximation. For large yield changes, convexity can be added to provide a quadratic or second-order approximation. Alternatively, and often more usefully, convexity can be used to measure how the modified duration changes as yields change. Similar risk measures (first and second order) used in the options markets are the delta and gamma.

Modified duration and DV01 as measures of interest rate sensitivity are also useful because they can be applied to instruments and securities with varying or contingent cash flows, such as options.

==Embedded options and effective duration==

For bonds that have embedded options, such as putable and callable bonds, modified duration will not correctly approximate the price move for a change in yield to maturity.
Consider a bond with an embedded put option. As an example, a $1,000 bond that can be redeemed by the holder at par at any time before the bond&#x27;s maturity (i.e. an American put option). No matter how high interest rates become, the price of the bond will never go below $1,000 (ignoring counterparty risk). This bond&#x27;s price sensitivity to interest rate changes is different from a non-puttable bond with otherwise identical cash flows.

To price such bonds, one must use option pricing to determine the value of the bond, and then one can compute its delta (and hence its lambda), which is the duration. The effective duration is a discrete approximation to this latter, and will require an option pricing model.

: formula_71

where Δ &quot;y&quot; is the amount that yield changes, and formula_72 and formula_73 are the values that the bond will take if the yield falls by &quot;y&quot; or rises by &quot;y&quot;, respectively. (A &quot;parallel shift&quot;; note that this value may vary depending on the value used for Δ &quot;y&quot;.)

These values are typically calculated using a tree-based model, built for the &quot;entire&quot; yield curve (as opposed to a single yield to maturity), and therefore capturing exercise behavior at each point in the option&#x27;s life as a function of both time and interest rates; see .

==Spread duration==
Spread duration is the sensitivity of a bond&#x27;s market price to a change in option-adjusted spread (OAS). Thus the index, or underlying yield curve, remains unchanged. Floating rate assets that are benchmarked to an index (such as 1-month or 3-month LIBOR) and reset periodically will have an effective duration near zero but a spread duration comparable to an otherwise identical fixed rate bond.

==Average duration==
The sensitivity of a portfolio of bonds such as a bond mutual fund to changes in interest rates can also be important. The average duration of the bonds in the portfolio is often reported. The duration of a portfolio equals the weighted average maturity of all of the cash flows in the portfolio. If each bond has the same yield to maturity, this equals the weighted average of the portfolio&#x27;s bond&#x27;s durations, with weights proportional to the bond prices. Otherwise the weighted average of the bond&#x27;s durations is just a good approximation, but it can still be used to infer how the value of the portfolio would change in response to changes in interest rates.

==Convexity==

Duration is a linear measure of how the price of a bond changes in response to interest rate changes. As interest rates change, the price does not change linearly, but rather is a convex function of interest rates. Convexity is a measure of the curvature of how the price of a bond changes as the interest rate changes. Specifically, duration can be formulated as the first derivative of the price function of the bond with respect to the interest rate in question, and the convexity as the second derivative.

Convexity also gives an idea of the spread of future cashflows. (Just as the duration gives the discounted mean term, so convexity can be used to calculate the discounted standard deviation, say, of return.)

Note that convexity can be positive or negative. A bond with &quot;positive convexity&quot; will not have any call features - i.e. the issuer must redeem the bond at maturity - which means that as rates fall, both its duration and price will rise.

On the other hand, a bond &quot;with&quot; call features - i.e. where the issuer can redeem the bond early - is deemed to have &quot;negative convexity&quot; as rates approach the option strike, which is to say its duration will fall as rates fall, and hence its price will rise less quickly. This is because the issuer can redeem the old bond at a high coupon and re-issue a new bond at a lower rate, thus providing the issuer with valuable optionality. Similar to the above, in these cases, it may be more correct to calculate an effective convexity.

Mortgage-backed securities (pass-through mortgage principal prepayments) with US-style 15- or 30-year fixed-rate mortgages as collateral are examples of callable bonds.

==Sherman ratio==
The &quot;Sherman ratio&quot; is the yield offered per unit of bond duration, named after DoubleLine Capital&#x27;s chief investment officer, Jeffrey Sherman. It has been called the &quot;Bond Market&#x27;s Scariest Gauge&quot;, and hit an all-time low of 0.1968 for the Bloomberg Barclays US Corporate Bond Index on Dec 31, 2020. The ratio is simply the yield offered (as a percentage), divided by the bond duration (in years).

<text>KMOV (channel 4) is a television station in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, affiliated with CBS. It is owned by Gray Media alongside low-power station KDTL-LD (channel 4.6). The two stations share studios on Progress Parkway in suburban Maryland Heights; KMOV&#x27;s transmitter is located in Lemay, Missouri.

==History==
===Early history===
The station first signed on the air on July 8, 1954, as KWK-TV. At its launch, channel 4 was owned by a consortium which included Robert T. Convey (28%) and the now-defunct Newhouse Newspapers–published &quot;St. Louis Globe-Democrat&quot; (23%), who jointly operated KWK radio (1380 AM, now KXFN); Elzey M. Roberts Sr., former owner of KXOK radio (630 AM, now KYFI), which had to be sold as a condition of the license grant (23%); and Missouri Valley Television Inc., made up of Saint Paul, Minnesota–based Hubbard Broadcasting (23%) and several St. Louis residents (combined 3%).

Each of the station&#x27;s part-owners had competed individually for the channel 4 construction permit before agreeing to merge their interests only three months before the station went on the air. Upon signing on KWK-TV took the CBS affiliation from Belleville, Illinois–licensed WTVI (channel 54, now KTVI channel 2). Until 1955, it also aired ABC programs that WTVI declined to broadcast. The station&#x27;s original studios, built by KWK radio in anticipation of television, were located on Cole Street in Downtown West.

===As a CBS owned-and-operated station===
However, CBS was planning to operate its own television station in St. Louis alongside its powerhouse radio station, KMOX (1120 AM). The network originally won the permit to build a new station on channel 11 – the last remaining commercial VHF channel assigned to St. Louis – in January 1957. But after being approached with an offer, CBS decided in August of that year to buy KWK-TV instead for $4 million. The agreement required CBS to give up its construction permit for channel 11, and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) transferred it to one of the failed applicants, a group led by St. Louis hotelier Harold Koplar, for no financial consideration. Almost immediately, the deal was held up after the St. Louis Amusement Company, another of the original applicants for channel 11, protested to the United States Court of Appeals in January 1958. The U.S. Supreme Court ultimately upheld the decision in November of that year. CBS had already taken control of channel 4&#x27;s operations that March, and changed its call letters to KMOX-TV in reference to its new radio sister. The following April, channel 11 signed on as independent station KPLR-TV.

In July 1968, CBS opened a new studio and office facility in downtown St. Louis to house the KMOX stations, which until that point had been operating from separate locations (KMOX radio was headquartered near Forest Park). Channel 4 moved from Cole Street into the new facility, known as One Memorial Drive, and remained there until December 3, 2023; the Cole Street studio was soon acquired by KDNL-TV (channel 30), which operated that facility from its sign-on in June 1969 until 2022.

===Viacom ownership===
By late 1985, CBS was in rough financial straits, an after-effect of successfully fending off a hostile takeover attempt by Ted Turner the year before. CBS spent the latter portion of 1985 repurchasing a large portion of its stock to help block the Turner takeover. Once Turner sold his stock, CBS was saddled with significant debt and needed to raise money. Not long after Laurence Tisch became the company&#x27;s chairman, CBS decided to sell KMOX-TV, at the time its smallest owned-and-operated television station by market size. On May 16, 1986, the original iteration of Viacom, the former CBS Inc. subsidiary and future parent company, completed its $122.5 million purchase of the station; so as to comply with an FCC regulation in place at the time that prohibited TV and radio stations in the same market but with different ownership from having the same callsigns, KMOX-TV&#x27;s callsign was slightly modified to the present KMOV almost a month later on June 18. Despite the sale, channel 4&#x27;s operations continued to be based alongside KMOX radio at their downtown studios on Memorial Drive; KMOX would relocate from that building in 2012. The two stations still have a news partnership.

Viacom announced its purchase of Paramount Pictures in 1993. The merger, completed in 1994, placed Viacom&#x27;s existing five-station group (KMOV; WHEC-TV in Rochester, New York; WNYT in Albany, New York; WVIT in New Britain, Connecticut; and KSLA-TV in Shreveport, Louisiana) under common ownership with the Paramount Stations Group; the two groups were formally consolidated in December 1995. However, in 1994, the company decided to divest itself of all of its major network affiliates to focus on stations that carried its then-upstart United Paramount Network (UPN), which would start up service on January 16, 1995.

===Belo Corporation ownership===
Dallas-based A. H. Belo Corporation acquired KMOV in a three-way deal also involving two stations in the Seattle–Tacoma market. As part of the transaction, A. H. Belo (which spun off its broadcast holdings into a separate, similarly named company in 2008) sold KIRO-TV (then a UPN affiliate, which was included in the deal because the company had recently acquired that market&#x27;s NBC affiliate KING-TV) to Cox Enterprises, who concurrently sold its existing Seattle–Tacoma station, then-CBS affiliate KSTW, to Viacom. The deal was consummated on June 1, 1997 (KIRO and KSTW swapped their affiliations on June 30, 1997, thus returning to its original affiliation).

In the spring of 2013, a lighted sign with the KMOV logo was installed on the top of the south face of Gateway Tower, which not only gave the station visibility on the St. Louis skyline, but was also visible in center field of wide shots of Busch Stadium during St. Louis Cardinals games.

===Changing hands===
On June 13, 2013, the Gannett Company, owner of NBC affiliate KSDK (channel 5), announced that it would acquire Belo. As the deal would violate FCC regulations that disallow common ownership of two of the four highest-rated stations in a single market (KMOV and KSDK have ranked as the top two stations in the St. Louis market in total-day ratings for several years), Gannett would retain KSDK, while it would spin off KMOV to Sander Media, LLC (owned by former Belo executive Jack Sander). Gannett intended to provide services to the station through a shared services agreement, KMOV&#x27;s operations were to remain largely separate from KSDK, including separate and competing news and sales departments. However, on December 16, 2013, the United States Department of Justice threatened to block the merger unless Gannett, Belo and Sander completely divested KMOV to a government-approved third-party company that would be barred from entering into any agreements with Gannett. The DOJ claimed that Gannett and Sander would be so closely aligned that Gannett would have dominated spot advertising in St. Louis. On December 23, 2013, shortly after the Gannett/Belo deal was approved and completed, Des Moines, Iowa–based Meredith Corporation – which already had a broadcasting presence in Missouri through its ownership of fellow CBS affiliate KCTV in Kansas City – announced that it would purchase KMOV, along with KTVK and KASW in Phoenix (the latter of which Meredith would later sell to the Nexstar Broadcasting Group) for $407.5 million. The sale of KMOV was completed on February 28, 2014.

More than a year later on September 8, 2015, Richmond, Virginia–based Media General announced that it would acquire Meredith for $2.4 billion. If it had been completed, it would have marked KMOV&#x27;s third ownership shift since 2013. Media General would eventually shelve the Meredith deal in favor of a counter-offer by Nexstar.

On April 24, 2018, it was announced that Meredith would be acquiring CW affiliate KPLR-TV from Tribune Media as a result of station sales ordered by the FCC as a result of Tribune&#x27;s proposed acquisition by Sinclair Broadcast Group, owners of ABC affiliate KDNL-TV. If Sinclair&#x27;s acquisition of Tribune and related station sales were approved, it would have created a duopoly between KMOV and KPLR-TV. However, on August 9, 2018, Tribune announced it would terminate the Sinclair deal, intending to seek other M&amp;A opportunities. This came three weeks after the FCC&#x27;s July 18 vote to have the deal reviewed by an administrative law judge amid &quot;serious concerns&quot; about Sinclair&#x27;s forthrightness in its applications to sell certain conflict properties. Tribune also filed a breach of contract lawsuit in the Delaware Chancery Court, alleging that Sinclair engaged in protracted negotiations with the FCC and the U.S. Department of Justice&#x27;s Antitrust Division over regulatory issues, refused to sell stations in markets where it already had properties, and proposed divestitures to parties with ties to Sinclair executive chair David D. Smith that were rejected or highly subject to rejection to maintain control over stations it was required to sell. The deal was nullified, with Tribune eventually accepting another merger agreement with Nexstar that, due to other station spin-offs, retained the existing KTVI/KPLR duopoly and closed without issue in mid-September 2019.

=== Sale to Gray Television, move to St. Louis County ===
On May 3, 2021, Gray Television announced its intent to purchase the Meredith Local Media division, including KMOV, for $2.7 billion. The sale was completed on December 1.

On December 3, 2023, with its 6 p.m. newscast, KMOV completed the on-air move from Gateway Tower to a remodeled and adapted facility in the St. Louis County suburb of Maryland Heights which had formerly been occupied by medical device manufacturer ERT, joining KTVI/KPLR in relocating to Maryland Heights, which provides much easier access to the area&#x27;s freeway system via Interstate 270 and a secured parking lot rather than the cumbersome mix of on-street and underground parking it had at Gateway Tower. The station had soft-launched a new branding, &quot;First Alert 4&quot; (which has become a common brand for Gray&#x27;s local newscasts) in the months before, which was solidified in full with the move to Maryland Heights.

==Programming==
===Past programming preemptions and deferrals===
As a CBS-owned station, channel 4 cleared the entire network schedule and, after the launch of &quot;CBS News Nightwatch&quot; in 1982 adopted a 24/7 schedule as a result. When Viacom took over in 1986, this changed rather drastically. KMOV began signing off the air at night, thus preempting &quot;Nightwatch&quot;. A barrage of scattered prime time preemptions later followed that was so rampant, the station earned a mention in Ken Auletta&#x27;s 1991 book, &quot;Three Blind Mice&quot;. KMOV randomly replaced CBS prime time shows with programming such as Billy Graham Crusades and &quot;National Geographic&quot; specials, syndicated movie packages, and occasional local and regional sporting events, all of which allowed the station and Viacom full control of the ad time airing during the preemptions. According to Auletta, KMOV preempted 103 hours of CBS prime time programs in 1987, accounting for nearly 10 percent of the network prime time schedule. In the 1990s, the prime time preemptions eased as all networks began to tighten down contractually on heavy preemptions, and currently, the station only occasionally preempts a CBS prime time show, usually only due to breaking news or severe weather. The station also resumed a 24-hour broadcast schedule in the early 1990s.

From September 1989 until September 11, 2015, KMOV aired &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; on a same-day delay at 3 p.m., and later, at 4 p.m. (serving as a lead-in for its early-evening newscasts), with &quot;The Price Is Right&quot; airing on a one-hour delay at 11 a.m.; KMOV also delayed &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; by a half-hour since 1997 under original host Tom Snyder (one of several CBS stations that have done this practice), in order to run syndicated programming after the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; (KMOV completely preempted &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; during the program&#x27;s first two years on the air). On September 14, 2015, KMOV moved &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot; and &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; to their recommended network time periods with the first full season under Meredith ownership, with the relocation of the former two shows occurring as a result of the launch of a half-hour 4 p.m. newscast.

===Sports programming===
KMOX/KMOV served as the unofficial home station of the NFL&#x27;s St. Louis Cardinals from their arrival in St. Louis in 1960 until the 1987 season, when the team relocated to Phoenix, Arizona. It also aired any games of the city&#x27;s next NFL team, the Rams from 1998 (when CBS acquired the AFC broadcast package) to 2015 (usually home interconference contests), when the Rams returned to Los Angeles.

KMOV aired games of the baseball St. Louis Cardinals from 1990 to 1993 as part of CBS&#x27; national broadcast contract with Major League Baseball.

KMOV was also served as the host of the 2005 Final Four which took place at the Edward Jones Dome.

The station aired St. Louis Blues NHL games for one season, during the 1996–97 season until their over-the-air telecasts moved back to KPLR-TV for the 1997–98 season. In January 2025, the Blues announced an agreement with Gray Media to exclusively broadcast three regular season games during the 2024–25 season. All of the games will air on Matrix Midwest, while two games will be simulcast on KMOV&#x27;s primary subchannel.

===Locally produced non-news programming===
In 2003, KMOV began producing &quot;At the Zoo&quot;, a program that gives a behind-the-scenes look inside the St. Louis Zoo and was hosted by meteorologist Kent Ehrhardt (encore presentations of older episodes aired from 2009 to 2011). In September 2008, KMOV premiered &quot;Great Day St. Louis&quot;, an hour-long daytime talk show, mostly focusing on entertainment and lifestyle topics in the St. Louis area (the show is currently hosted by Matt Chambers, Kent Ehrhardt, and Laura Hettiger). In January 2011, KMOV debuted &quot;At the Center&quot;, which features an inside look at attractions at the St. Louis Science Center.

===News operation===
KMOV presently broadcasts 41 hours of locally produced newscasts each week (with hours each weekday, five hours on Saturdays and hours on Sundays). In addition, the station produces the half-hour sports wrap-up program &quot;Sports Sunday&quot;, which airs on Sundays after the 10 p.m. newscast. Many members of KMOV&#x27;s on-air news staff have moved on to work for national news organizations (Richelle Carey and meteorologist Reynolds Wolf, for example, both joined CNN in 2006). While it would seem like a positive aspect, the &quot;revolving door&quot; turnover rate of its anchors and reporters has been one of KMOV&#x27;s weaknesses over the years (especially under CBS ownership, where it had the same &quot;farm team&quot; talent development role WKYC in Cleveland played for NBC), leading to the unfamiliarity that many of the station&#x27;s on-air personalities have in the market. Though this may have initially caused some issues for KMOV, ratings for channel 4&#x27;s newscasts have since increased. Since the departure of Karen Foss from KSDK in December 2006, Larry Conners assumed the title of the longest-serving 10 p.m. news anchor in the market until he was fired by the station in 2013 after a Facebook post questioning if he was being audited by the Internal Revenue Service in the wake of a contentious interview with President Barack Obama during the 2012 election cycle.

In 1976, channel 4 became the second station to adopt Dick Marx&#x27;s &quot;WBBM Channel 2 News Theme&quot;, that eventually became the de facto official newscast music for CBS&#x27; owned-and-operated stations. The theme was dropped by the station in 1986 after Viacom took control, though from 2001 to 2008, the station used the Frank Gari-composed &quot;CBS Enforcer Music Collection&quot;, which uses a music signature derived from the WBBM package. Ironically from 1989 to 1992, KMOV used Gari&#x27;s &quot;News Series 2000&quot;, which was traditionally associated with ABC stations, as its news theme. In July 2018, the &quot;CBS Enforcer Music Collection&quot; theme returned to the station, replacing their previous theme, the Gari-composed &quot;The Edge&quot;.

KMOX-TV was competitive in the ratings for most of the period from the late 1960s to the early 1980s. From the early 1980s until recently, KMOX-TV/KMOV was a solid, if distant, runner-up to KSDK. However, until the mid-1990s, the station had to fend off spirited competition from KTVI. Although KMOV&#x27;s newscasts were critically favored, they were rarely rewarded with a ratings win over long-dominant KSDK, with the 10 p.m. newscast regularly winning at least a 20 percent share in viewership, while KSDK averaged about a 30 percent share. KMOV has seen significant ratings growth since 2004, and beat KSDK at 10 p.m. both during the November 2004 sweeps period – the first time in over a quarter-century that KSDK did not place first in any timeslot – and during the May and November 2006 sweeps periods; it also became the most-watched late evening newscast in the United States during the latter period. Most of the ratings growth at 10 p.m. was attributed to CBS&#x27; prime time ratings increases and NBC&#x27;s large drop in viewership. However, KMOV also saw growth in all of its other newscast timeslots, even where the station does not benefit from a strong CBS lead-in. Starting in late 2013, KMOV started to dominate the news ratings in most newscasts, winning the noon, 5, 6 and 10 p.m. time slots, while KSDK plummeted to third place at 5 and 6 p.m. for the first time in that station&#x27;s history. Despite the firing of longtime anchor Larry Conners by the station in May 2013, KMOV has placed first among the market&#x27;s 10 p.m. newscast in every demographic every month since that time.

In February 2002, KMOV partnered with the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; to produce the weekly news discussion program &quot;Extra Edition&quot;, hosted by now-former weekday morning anchor Marc Cox.

On January 27, 2008, beginning with its 5:30 p.m. newscast, KMOV became the second television station in the St. Louis market to begin broadcasting its local newscasts in high definition (after KSDK, which has produced its newscasts in the format since 2006).

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:

On February 17, 2014, KMOV dropped the Live Well Network, as Meredith planned on using the bandwidth utilized from digital channel 4.3 for the station&#x27;s ATSC M/H mobile DTV signal. On November 17, 2014, KMOV relaunched 4.3 as &quot;MyTV St. Louis&quot;, returning MyNetworkTV (and some syndicated programming) to the market after a nine-month absence due to former affiliate WRBU (channel 46)&#x27;s sale to Ion Media Networks and that station&#x27;s wholesale conversion into an Ion Television owned-and-operated station.

KMOV carried MeTV on their second subchannel from 2013 until February 1, 2018, when it moved to KNLC-TV (channel 24), which was sold in December 2017 to MeTV parent Weigel Broadcasting. This allowed Meredith to air Cozi TV for the first time in the St. Louis market (it had entered an agreement to air on Meredith stations in early 2016, but KMOV&#x27;s circumstances with MeTV and MyNetworkTV under their previous Belo and Gannett ownerships prevented Cozi TV from being carried until that point).

On August 22, 2024, as part of a larger initiative by Gray Television to launch regional sports networks, the MyNetworkTV subchannel was rebranded as &quot;Matrix Midwest&quot;. Its new lineup includes a partnership with the Missouri Tigers to produce pre- and post-game shows for its football games (&quot;Mizzou Live&quot;) and a coach&#x27;s show (&quot;Tiger Talk&quot;) with Eliah Drinkwitz. The channel continues to carry its existing syndicated (also joined by &quot;GMFB: Overtime&quot;), lifestyle, and MyNetworkTV programming. In September 2024, it was announced that the subchannel would also air Missouri Valley Conference basketball as part of an agreement between the conference and Gray, with a package of regular season games, and coverage of the opening round and quarter finals of the MVC men&#x27;s basketball tournament. The games also stream on ESPN+ and the ESPN app. The subchannel also has an agreement with the St. Louis Blues to air classic games and the Blues Hall of Fame induction ceremony. In February 2025, Matrix Midwest aired matches from the Coachella Valley Invitational preseason tournament featuring St. Louis City SC of Major League Soccer.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
KMOV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 4, on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 56, which was among the high-band UHF channels (52–69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition, to UHF channel 24, using virtual channel 4.

<doc id="847507" wikidata="Q1326048" url="?curid=847507" title="Daytona USA">
<text>is a 1994 arcade racing game developed by Sega AM2. Inspired by the popularity of the NASCAR motor racing series in the US, the game has players race stock cars on one of three courses. It was the first game to be released on the Sega Model 2 arcade system board. Released by Sega in March 1994, &quot;Daytona USA&quot; is one of the highest-grossing arcade games of all time.

Sega partnered with GE Aerospace to develop the Model 2, which renders 3D graphics capable of texture filtering and texture mapping. &quot;Daytona USA&quot; was developed by AM2 after a meeting of the heads of Sega&#x27;s regional offices to decide on a game to debut the Model 2 hardware. The concept was suggested by Tom Petit, president of Sega&#x27;s American arcade division, with input from AM2 director Toshihiro Nagoshi, who became the game&#x27;s director and producer. Sega aimed to outperform Namco&#x27;s &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; (1993). The developers researched motorsports extensively; they mapped Daytona International Speedway, and their experience developing &quot;Virtua Racing&quot; (1992) helped with lighting and camera control.

&quot;Daytona USA&quot; was a critical and commercial success, with its graphics, soundtrack and gameplay all receiving high praise. The game was ported to the Sega Saturn in 1995, and was followed by sequels and enhanced versions for consoles and arcades. It has been frequently named one of the best video games of all time.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, the player drives a stock car known as the Hornet. The player&#x27;s objectives are to outrun the competing cars and complete the race before time runs out, passing checkpoints to collect more time. Players begin in last place and compete against a field of up to 39 computer-controlled cars, dependent on the course selected. Three courses are available for play: Beginner, Advanced, and Expert, also known respectively as Three Seven Speedway, Dinosaur Canyon, and Seaside Street Galaxy. Adaptive difficulty is used; the first lap of each race measures the skill of the player and adjusts the difficulty of opponents accordingly. For less skilled players, opposing cars open lanes for the player, while higher-skilled players have to deal with opponents that block their path. The game&#x27;s physics include realistic driving mechanics, including drifting and power sliding. The steering wheel in the arcade cabinet uses force feedback so players feel collisions and bumps. Shifting is performed with an H-type shifter.

&quot;Daytona USA&quot;&#x27;s arcade version on the Model 2 is capable of displaying up to 300,000 texture-mapped polygons per second, nearly double that of the previous Model 1. Visually, the game uses texture filtering, giving the visuals a smooth appearance. As in &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;, the game&#x27;s camera system presents four different view perspectives from which the game can be played, and also includes the ability to view behind the car. The arcade version allows up to eight players to compete with each other, depending on the number of cabinets linked together. Linked deluxe cabinets may also include a camera pointing towards the drivers seat, linked to a closed-circuit television to show the player on a separate screen. In multiplayer, only the lead driver needs to reach a checkpoint before time runs out. Rubber-banding is used in multiplayer races to ensure all players stay involved in the race.

The Sega Saturn version does not include multiplayer, but includes an additional &quot;Saturn&quot; mode, which turns off the game&#x27;s timer and adds more cars for the player to choose from. Additional &quot;Endurance&quot; and &quot;Grand Prix&quot; modes are also included, both of which require pit stops. Sustaining damage in a race in these modes will adversely affect the car&#x27;s performance. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions included online multiplayer with up to eight players.

==Development==
In September 1992, Sega partnered with the engineering division GE Aerospace to create its new arcade system board, the Model 2. They were connected via a cold call from GE&#x27;s Bob Hichborn, who met with Sega executives at the division&#x27;s Daytona Beach, Florida headquarters in 1990, and later at Sega&#x27;s headquarters in Tokyo in November of the same year. At the second meeting, GE Aerospace executives brought a tape demonstrating the hardware&#x27;s 3D graphics simulating the Daytona International Speedway. GE estimated that their sale of the Model 2&#x27;s graphics technology accelerated Sega&#x27;s arcade hardware development by 14 months. 

The heads of Sega&#x27;s regional offices began discussing ideas for games to demonstrate the Model 2&#x27;s capabilities. Sega&#x27;s previous board, the Model 1, had debuted in 1992 with &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;, which was popular in Japan and Europe. Tom Petit, president of Sega&#x27;s American arcade division Sega Enterprises USA, suggested that NASCAR would be an attractive brand to use for a Model 2 game in the US. Though Sega Europe&#x27;s Vic Leslie had reservations due to the greater popularity of Formula One in Europe, Sega executives approved the concept. Petit and Sega Enterprises USA chief of finance Masahiro Nakagawa began negotiations with representatives of the Daytona 500 at Daytona International Speedway for a license to develop a game based on the race. To lower costs, Sega decided not to negotiate with NASCAR for a license, and so the game does not contain real sponsors, drivers, or cars.

Sega mandated that &quot;Daytona USA&quot; had to be better than Namco&#x27;s 1993 racing game &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; and it had to achieve higher sales. &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; had reached the top of arcade sales charts at the end of 1993 and beginning of 1994, and it had received highly favorable reviews of its graphics, especially in comparison to &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;. Development was assigned to Sega AM2, a development division headed by Yu Suzuki, who had led development on popular racing games including &quot;Hang-On&quot;, &quot;Out Run&quot;, and &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;. AM2 director Toshihiro Nagoshi was given direct responsibility for the project, with Nagoshi and Suzuki serving as producers. The game was Nagoshi&#x27;s first project as a director. Nagoshi was aware of the racing arcade games already on the market and decided he wanted to take his game in a different direction. While in the US for a meeting on the Model 2, Nagoshi was given tickets to a NASCAR race, and later recalled that it was a new experience for him because it was not a known style of racing in Japan. He chose to design his game to be &quot;funky entertainment&quot;, in contrast to the simulation-based style of &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;.

AM2 split into two teams: one focused on &quot;Daytona USA&quot; while the other developed &quot;Virtua Fighter&quot;. As research for the project, Nagoshi read books and watched videos on NASCAR, although he found it difficult to convey the emotions of the sport to his staff in Japan. Game planner Makoto Osaki said he purchased a sports car and watched the NASCAR film &quot;Days of Thunder&quot; more than 100 times. Programmer Daichi Katagiri was an avid player of arcade racing games at the time and leaned on that experience. The developers used satellite imagery and sent staff to photograph Daytona International Speedway; Nagoshi walked a full lap to get a feel for the banking in the corners. The team considered both Daytona International Speedway and Bristol Motor Speedway for the game&#x27;s beginner course. According to Nagoshi, because &quot;Daytona USA&quot; was not intended to be a simulation game, and because it would be sold in Japan and Europe in addition to North America, the oval and tri-oval designs were rejected as too repetitive. The final design for the beginner circuit, Three Seven Speedway, uses the tri-oval layout with a sharper final turn that requires strong braking.

Unlike &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;&#x27;s Model 1 hardware, the Model 2 is capable of displaying surface detail on its 3D graphics with texture mapping. As this was new for the developers, trial and error was used to find the most effective approach. Suzuki also reached out to Sega designer Jeffery Buchanan, who suggested placing interesting features, such as a dinosaur fossil and a clipper ship, at various locations within the game. Katagiri said there was no need to develop software for rendering because the Model 2 hardware handled this. For camera control and lighting effects, the team drew on its experience developing &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;. &quot;Daytona USA&quot; shares some features with &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, including a drifting mechanic. Nagoshi initially planned not to include drifting as NASCAR stock cars do not drift, but changed his mind when the team decided not to focus on simulation. He did not believe in fortune telling, but chose the number 41 for the Hornet player car because he was told by someone close to him that the number would be lucky.

The soundtrack was composed by Takenobu Mitsuyoshi, who had no familiarity with stock car racing. He chose to include vocals after hearing &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;&#x27;s techno soundtrack and deciding to try a different approach; he recorded his own vocals as the fastest way to get the music into the game. Each course has a corresponding song. &quot;Let&#x27;s Go Away&quot;, the &quot;Daytona&quot; theme, uses a mixture of rock and funk instrumentals, while &quot;Sky High&quot; leaned on Mitsuyoshi&#x27;s background in jazz fusion. A hidden track, &quot;Pounding Pavement&quot;, was inspired by &quot;Hotel California&quot; by the Eagles and is accessible by holding the fourth view perspective button while selecting the beginner track in the arcade version. For the arcade version, the songs were sampled onto a Yamaha sound chip, including the drums and Mitsuyoshi&#x27;s voice, then reconstructed by varying when the tracks would play and loop. This was the only way to include vocals, due to technical limitations of the Model 2. For the Saturn version, the music was remixed.

==Release==
Prior to release, Sega debuted a prototype of &quot;Daytona USA&quot; at the Amusement Machine Show in Tokyo in August 1993, and it was tested in select Japanese arcades the same month; Petit stated that this was done to measure how the games would be received by the public. The complete version of &quot;Daytona USA&quot; was released in Japan in March 1994, and made its North American debut the same month at Chicago&#x27;s American Coin Machine Exposition (ACME); it was subsequently released worldwide in April 1994. According to Petit, Sega delayed the worldwide launch to measure reception before investing in other territories. The standard game was released in a twin-seat cabinet and a deluxe cabinet fitted with detailed seats on top of subwoofers; Sega originally planned to use actual car seats, but management determined the seats were too difficult to enter and exit. &quot;Daytona USA&quot; debuted at number two on arcade operator publication &quot;RePlay&quot;″s &quot;Player&#x27;s Choice&quot; chart and stayed on the list for five years, with 16 months at number one. &quot;Daytona USA&quot; was rereleased in 1996 in arcades as &quot;Daytona USA: Special Edition&quot;, designed as a smaller, more affordable cabinet.Around the time of the worldwide release, Sega announced releases for its Saturn and 32X consoles, but a year later, Sega announced their intention to focus solely on the Saturn. In early 1995, Sega AM2&#x27;s Saturn division split into three departments, each charged with converting a different arcade game to the Saturn: &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot;, &quot;Virtua Cop&quot;, and &quot;Daytona USA&quot;. Due to slow progress on the &quot;Daytona USA&quot; conversion, several members of the &quot;Virtua Fighter 2&quot; team were reassigned to &quot;Daytona USA&quot;. AM2 completed the conversion in April 1995. It was a Western launch game for Saturn, and was also released for Windows via SegaSoft. In Japan, two separate Windows releases were done in September and December 1996, with the first released version supporting specific graphics cards such as Leadtek&#x27;s WinFast GD400. A Windows version was released in Europe on November 14, 1996, and in North America in December of the same year.

==Remakes and sequels==
&quot;Daytona USA: Championship Circuit Edition&quot;, a reworked and expanded version of &quot;Daytona USA&quot;, was released in 1996 for the Saturn. Developed by Sega&#x27;s consumer software division, it uses a modified version of the game engine used for &quot;Sega Rally Championship&quot;. An enhanced arcade remake, called Sega Racing Classic, was released in 2010 and is the first title in the series not branded with the &quot;Daytona&quot; name as Sega no longer owned the rights at the time. It operates on Sega&#x27;s RingWide arcade system board and features high definition graphics and an arranged instrumental soundtrack. Another enhanced version was released digitally for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2012, as &quot;Daytona USA&quot;. It includes both the original arcade soundtrack and the arranged soundtrack from &quot;Sega Racing Classic&quot; with vocals by Mitsuyoshi, along with added features including eight player online multiplayer, challenge, and karaoke modes. The Xbox 360 version was later made backward compatible on the Xbox One and extended to the Xbox Series X/S, though the game was later delisted from all Xbox stores in February 2023.

&quot;Daytona USA 2: Battle on the Edge&quot;, an arcade-exclusive sequel using the Sega Model 3 hardware, was released in 1998. It is the only &quot;Daytona&quot; game that uses no courses or music from the original. &quot;Daytona USA 2001&quot;, a remake of &quot;Daytona USA&quot; and &quot;Championship Circuit Edition&quot;, was released in 2001 for the Dreamcast, with graphical upgrades, online multiplayer, and new courses. &quot;Daytona Championship USA&quot;, also referred to as &quot;Daytona USA 3&quot;, debuted in late 2016 as an arcade exclusive; it was the first &quot;Daytona&quot;-branded arcade game in 18 years.

==Reception and legacy==

===Arcade===
&quot;Daytona USA&quot; was popular in arcades. In Japan, it was the ninth highest-grossing arcade game of 1994, and the highest-grossing dedicated arcade game of 1995. In North America, it was listed by arcade industry magazine &quot;Play Meter&quot; as one of the top two highest-grossing arcade video games of 1994, with the twin cabinet receiving a Diamond Award from the American Amusement Machine Association (AAMA) that year; it again received a Diamond Award the following year for being one of America&#x27;s top three best-selling arcade games of 1995. In the United Kingdom, it topped the dedicated arcade charts for six months in 1994, from May to October. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;&#x27;s Nick Thorpe said that though &quot;Daytona USA&quot; is considered anecdotally one of the most successful arcade games for its multiplayer and longevity, exact figures were difficult to find. In 2015, &quot;IGN&quot;&#x27;s Luke Reilly said that the game is &quot;perhaps the most recognisable arcade racing game of all time and the highest-grossing sit-down cabinet ever&quot; and noted the continued presence of &quot;Daytona USA&quot; cabinets in arcades and bowling alleys.

The original arcade game was critically acclaimed by video game and arcade industry publications alike. Upon its North American debut at ACME 1994, it received a highly positive reception from &quot;Play Meter&quot; and &quot;RePlay&quot;, which both considered it the game of the show while praising the graphics and gameplay, but with &quot;Play Meter&quot; criticizing the expensive cabinet price. Rik Skews of &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; considered &quot;Daytona USA&quot; the best arcade game he had played in years, and praised its &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; graphics, sound, and damage physics. Also highly regarding &quot;Daytona USA&quot;&#x27;s graphics were &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; (&quot;EGM&quot;), which asserted that &quot;the stakes in the arcade wars have been raised again&quot;, and &quot;GamePro&quot;&#x27;s Manny LaMancha, who argued that &quot;Daytona USA&quot; is a combination of &quot;Virtua Racing&quot;&#x27;s action with &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;&#x27;s realism. In contrast, Bob Strauss of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; compared the game to watching a movie, and said, &quot;Picture yourself watching a sci-fi movie, set in a futuristic arcade, that involves a dizzying car race. &#x27;Wow!&#x27; you can imagine saying to yourself, &#x27;How did they do those special effects?&#x27; You&#x27;ll have the same reaction while enjoying &quot;Daytona USA&quot;&quot;.

===Saturn===
The Saturn version received a positive reception, with high scores from most critics, though a number of them criticized it for graphical issues. &quot;Maximum&quot; highly regarded the challenging course design and realistic game mechanics, particularly the impact of wind resistance, but criticized the low-resolution graphic texture mapping, clipping, and lack of multiplayer. While identifying improvements on the North American version of the game compared to the Japanese version, two sports game reviewers for &quot;EGM&quot; found problems with the frame rate and animation. By contrast, a reviewer for &quot;Sega Saturn Magazine&quot; found the game graphically impressive aside from the pop-up and asserted it had strong arcade-style gameplay, and one from &quot;Next Generation&quot; argued that, while &quot;&quot;Daytona USA&quot; suffers from an accumulation of weaknesses, if it&#x27;s a fast, thrilling racing game you&#x27;re after, the Saturn conversion has a great deal to recommend&quot;. The Windows version was a port of the Saturn&#x27;s, and was not as well-received for inheriting the Saturn version&#x27;s graphical issues despite being released a year later. 

Several reviewers compared the Saturn version to &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;&#x27;s PlayStation conversion. &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; considered the Saturn&#x27;s &quot;Daytona USA&quot; better than the PlayStation&#x27;s &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, with Mark Patterson claiming that, while &quot;nowhere near as polished as &quot;Ridge Racer&quot;, it does play better, mainly because you can ram the other cars off the track and smash your own car up&quot;. While Air Hendrix of &quot;GamePro&quot; concluded &quot;Daytona USA&quot;″s &quot;intense gameplay and breathtaking graphics will exhilarate any racing fan&quot; and had positive feedback for the additions of Saturn mode and mirror mode, he argued it &quot;pales in comparison&quot; to the PlayStation version of &quot;Ridge Racer&quot; in terms of &quot;features, gameplay, and graphics&quot;.

===Retrospective===
&quot;Daytona USA&quot; was named one of the best games of all time by &quot;Next Generation&quot; in 1996, &quot;GamesMaster&quot; in 1996, &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; in 2000, &quot;EGM&quot; in 1997 and 2001, Yahoo! in 2005, and &quot;Empire&quot; in 2009. It was named one of the best coin-op games by &quot;EGM&quot; in 1997 and by &quot;Killer List of Videogames&quot;, and one of the best retro games by &quot;NowGamer&quot; in 2010 and &quot;EGM&quot; in 2006. &quot;Edge&quot; named it the 70th &quot;best game to play today&quot; in 2009. In 2015, &quot;IGN&quot; named it the sixth-most influential racing game, asserting that it &quot;remains a shining example of arcade racing done oh so right&quot;. Thorpe wrote that &quot;Daytona USA&quot; &quot;doesn&#x27;t just stand alongside the likes of &quot;Turbo&quot;, &quot;Out Run&quot;, &quot;Super Monaco GP&quot; and &quot;Sega Rally&quot; as part of a proud arcade racing heritage, but perhaps defines it&quot;.

According to aggregator Metacritic, the Xbox 360 version received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; and the PlayStation 3 version received &quot;mixed&quot; reviews. Justin Towell of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; regarded &quot;Daytona USA&quot; as &quot;a joyous, jubilant celebration of everything that made arcade games so exciting&quot; and the new survival mode &quot;a brilliant test of memory, logic and dexterity&quot;. &quot;1Up.com&quot;&#x27;s Ray Barnholt praised this version but expressed disappointment at the lack of new features. By contrast, &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Martin Robinson asserted that &quot;age doesn&#x27;t seem to have ravaged &quot;Daytona USA&quot;&#x27;s core&quot; and wrote that the game serves as &quot;fitting tribute to one of arcade racing&#x27;s enduring icons&quot;.

<doc id="847508" wikidata="Q16903078" url="?curid=847508" title="Stations in West Hampstead">
<text>West Hampstead is an area in north-west London, England that is served by a number of different stations, all of which have very similar names. Although physically separate, they are near each other and the stations form a railway interchange. Two of the stations are part of the National Rail network and the third is on the London Underground.

The three stations – located north to south on West End Lane are:

* West Hampstead Thameslink railway station – served by Thameslink.
* West Hampstead railway station – served by London Overground.
* West Hampstead tube station – served by London Underground Jubilee line.

==Stations and lines==
West Hampstead Thameslink railway station is the oldest of the three stations, but acquired its name when the Thameslink route was established in 1988. Earlier names included &quot;West End, West End and Brondesbury, West Hampstead&quot; and until 1988, &quot;West Hampstead Midland.&quot; It is located on the western side of West End Lane at the Iverson Road junction. Services are operated by Thameslink. , annual usage was 3.8 million.

West Hampstead railway station is on the North London Line, with train services provided by London Overground. It was known as &quot;West End Lane&quot; until 1975. It is on the western side of West End Lane between the tube station and Iverson Road. , annual usage was 4.5 million.

West Hampstead tube station is on London Underground Jubilee line. It is on the eastern side of West End Lane near Broadhurst Gardens. It was a Bakerloo line station until 1979. , annual usage was 10.5 million.

Additionally, three railway lines pass through West Hampstead but do not have stations in the area; they are:
* The Metropolitan line, whose trains bypass the tube station as they have no platforms there;
* The Midland Main Line, whose trains run through the Thameslink station without stopping;
* The Chiltern Main Line, which runs parallel to the Underground lines on the south side.

==Current interchange==

To change stations passengers leave one and walk along West End Lane to the other. The diagram shows the relative locations of the stations which are spaced over about . Out-of-station interchange within twenty minutes between any two of the stations entails no additional charge. As an example: a journey from Richmond to St Albans may be made on one ticket with a walk between the North London Line and the Thameslink stations. Step free access is available at the Thameslink and Overground stations.

==West Hampstead Interchange proposal==
In 2003, Chiltern Railways unveiled a proposal to redevelop the area along West End Lane to create an integrated station complex which would allow passenger interchange among five different Tube and railway lines. The scheme envisaged building new platforms on the Chiltern Main Line and the Metropolitan lines, and relocating the Thameslink and London Overground stations to the east side of West End Lane. The combined station would have a central passenger concourse and ticket hall, and pedestrian walkways would connect the stations. The scheme also proposed the construction of a new housing and office development and widening West End Lane, turning it into &quot;a tree-lined boulevard&quot; with additional space for buses and taxis. 

The plans were put on hold in 2007 due to uncertainty over the North London Line rail franchise. The proposal is now no longer possible, due to development in the area. Furthermore, both the Thameslink station and the Overground station have been rebuilt and upgraded in recent years, with step free access added to both.

<doc id="847515" wikidata="Q648527" url="?curid=847515" title="William J. Seymour">
<text>William Joseph Seymour (May 2, 1870 – September 28, 1922) was a Holiness Pentecostal preacher who initiated the Azusa Street Revival, an influential event in the rise of the Pentecostal and Charismatic movements, particularly Holiness Pentecostalism. He was the second of eight children born in an African-American family to emancipated slaves.

Seymour was a student of the early Pentecostal minister Charles Parham, and he adopted Parham&#x27;s belief that speaking in tongues was the sign of receiving the baptism in the Holy Spirit. In 1906, Seymour moved to Los Angeles, California, where he preached the Pentecostal message and sparked the Azusa Street Revival. The revival drew large crowds of believers as well as media coverage that focused on the controversial religious practices as well as the racially integrated worship services, which violated the racial norms of the time. Seymour&#x27;s leadership of the revival and publication of &quot;The Apostolic Faith&quot; newspaper launched him into prominence within the young Pentecostal movement. Seymour broke with Parham in 1906 over theological differences.

As the revival&#x27;s influence extended beyond Los Angeles through evangelism and missionary work, Seymour was in the process of developing the revival into a larger organization called the Apostolic Faith Movement. This process was ultimately defeated by power struggles with other ministers, such as Florence Crawford and William Howard Durham, which ultimately damaged the unity of the early Pentecostal movement and led to a decrease in Seymour&#x27;s influence. By 1914, the revival was past its peak, but Seymour continued to pastor the Apostolic Faith Mission he founded until his death. The revival acted as a catalyst for the spread of Pentecostal practices, such as speaking in tongues and integrated worship, throughout the world. It also played an important role in the history of most major Pentecostal denominations.

==Early life==
William Joseph Seymour was the second of eight children born to emancipated slaves Simon and Phyllis Salabar Seymour in Centerville, Louisiana. He was baptized as a child at the Church of the Assumption in Franklin, a Catholic parish. In 1884, when Seymour was fourteen years old, his parents built a house about a mile and a half from his birthplace adjacent to the New Providence Baptist Church in Centerville that the family likely attended while remaining Catholics.

While serving in the Union Army during the Civil War, Seymour&#x27;s father contracted an illness from which he finally died in November 1891. The twenty-one-year-old William then became the primary provider for his family, growing subsistence crops with very limited income from other sources. The family was able to keep their property but lived at the poverty level.

Seymour grew up during a period of heightened racism that likely led to his decision to move north, away from the persecution endured by southern blacks around the turn of the century. In 1895, Seymour moved to Indianapolis, where he attended the Simpson Chapel Methodist Episcopal Church (and possibly other African American churches) and became a born-again Christian.

==Early career==
In Indianapolis, Seymour was introduced to the Holiness movement through Daniel S. Warner&#x27;s &quot;Evening Light Saints&quot;, a group whose distinctive beliefs included non-sectarianism, faith healing, foot washing, the imminent Second Coming of Christ, and separation from &quot;the world&quot; in actions, beliefs, and lifestyle, including not wearing jewelry or neckties. In the summer of 1900, Seymour returned to Louisiana and worked briefly as a farm hand.

In 1901, Seymour moved to Cincinnati, where he worked as a waiter and probably attended God&#x27;s Bible School and Training Home, a school founded by holiness preacher Martin Wells Knapp. At Knapp&#x27;s school, blacks and whites studied side by side. Knapp taught Premillennialism—that Jesus would return prior to a literal millennium—and also took seriously &quot;special revelation&quot; such as dreams and visions. While in Cincinnati, Seymour contracted smallpox and was blinded in his left eye. Seymour blamed his disability on his reluctance to answer God&#x27;s call to the ministry.

Seymour moved to Houston in 1903. During the winter of 1904–1905, he was directed by a &quot;special revelation to Jackson, Mississippi, to receive spiritual advice from a well-known colored clergyman&quot;. He probably met Charles Price Jones and Charles Harrison Mason, founders of what would become the Church of God in Christ. Between 1895 and 1905, Seymour also met other holiness leaders, including John Graham Lake and Charles Parham, who was leading a growing movement in the Midwest.

Parham&#x27;s Apostolic Faith Movement emphasized speaking in tongues. Although speaking in tongues had occurred in some isolated religious circles as early as 1897, Parham began to practice it in 1900 and made the doctrine central to his theological system, believing it to be a sign that a Christian had received the baptism with the Holy Spirit. On January 1, 1901, Parham and some of his students were praying over Agnes Ozman when she began to speak in what was interpreted to be Chinese, a language Ozman never learned. Pentecostals identify Ozman as the first person in modern times to receive the gift of speaking in tongues as an answer to prayer for the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Parham also spoke in tongues and went on to open a Bible school in Houston as his base of operations in 1905.

When Houston African American holiness leader Lucy F. Farrow took a position with Charles Parham&#x27;s evangelistic team as his children&#x27;s nanny, Farrow asked Seymour to pastor her church. In 1906, with Farrow&#x27;s encouragement, Seymour joined Parham&#x27;s newly founded Bible school. Though Seymour&#x27;s attendance at Parham&#x27;s school violated Texas Jim Crow laws, with Parham&#x27;s permission, Seymour simply took a seat just outside the classroom door. Parham and Seymour shared pulpits and street corners on several occasions during the early weeks of 1906, with Parham only permitting Seymour to preach to blacks. During this time, Seymour continued praying that he would receive the baptism with the Holy Spirit. Though unsuccessful at the time, he remained committed to Parham&#x27;s beliefs about speaking in tongues, but he rejected Parham&#x27;s belief in the annihilation of the wicked and in the use of tongues in evangelism. Parham understood the gift of tongues to be xenoglossy, unlearned human languages to be used for evangelistic purposes.

Within a month of studying under Parham, Seymour received an invitation to pastor a holiness mission in Los Angeles founded by Julia Hutchins, who intended to become a missionary to Liberia. Although Parham believed Seymour unqualified because he had not yet been baptized in the Holy Spirit, Seymour went to Los Angeles anyway.

==Azusa Street Revival==

===Origins of the revival===

Seymour arrived in Los Angeles on February 22, 1906, and preached at Julia Hutchins&#x27;s church two days later. Seymour argued that speaking in tongues was the evidence of having received the Holy Spirit, even though he had not experienced it himself. Hutchins and J. M. Roberts, president of the Southern California Holiness Association, rejected Seymour&#x27;s position as contrary to accepted holiness views and had the church doors padlocked to keep Seymour out. Hutchins and the local holiness association called a special meeting at which they asked Seymour doctrinal questions. Among other things, the holiness leadership claimed that sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Spirit were the same thing, while Seymour remained unconvinced that the leaders themselves had been baptized in the Spirit. The association president removed Seymour from the pastorate, forbidding him to teach his doctrine of baptism in the Spirit in the holiness church. Nevertheless, he told Seymour that he was pleased Seymour was seeking baptism in the Spirit, adding, &quot;When you receive it, please let me know because I am interested in receiving it too.&quot;

===Speaking in tongues===

Seymour stayed at the home of a friend, Edward Lee, and started a prayer meeting at Lee&#x27;s house. When it grew too large for the house, it moved two blocks away to the home of another African American, Richard Asberry. (One attendee, Jennie Evans Moore, later married Seymour.) The prayer group accepted Seymour&#x27;s teaching and prayed to receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost. To help him minister to these people as they sought the baptism of the Spirit, he contacted two friends in Houston: Lucy Farrow and Joseph Warren, who he invited to join them at the Asberry&#x27;s home. The core group was made up of about 15 African Americans, including five children. Others joined them, including a former Baptist named Frank Bartleman, who would later publish a detailed account of the Azusa Street Revival. The size of the meetings at the Asberry&#x27;s house continued to grow as word got out about the new teachings among the Los Angeles holiness sector.

On Friday, April 6, 1906, the members of the meeting decided to add fasting to their discipline of regular prayer. They planned a ten-day fast, during which they would study Acts 2:1–4 and pray each evening until they had the same experience described in that text. On April 9, Edward Lee spoke in tongues after Seymour and the newly arrived Lucy Farrow laid hands on him in Lee&#x27;s home. Overjoyed, the group walked to the Asberry&#x27;s house for the evening meeting. Seymour took his text, as was expected, from Acts 2:4: &quot;And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.&quot; He then went on to explain what had just happened to Edward Lee. No sooner had he completed the story, when someone else began to speak in tongues. Before the evening was over, several others, including Jennie Evans Moore, had spoken in tongues. Over the next three days, the Asberry home became the focus of attention among the various networks of Wesleyan holiness people. As Frank Bartleman observed, &quot;The news spread like fire, naturally.&quot; The Azusa Street Revival had begun.

===Move to Azusa Street and worldwide influence===

Three days later, on April 12, after a long evening spent in prayer, Seymour himself received the baptism in the Holy Spirit and spoke in tongues. By that time, the group was far too large for the Asberry&#x27;s house; at one point the weight of the overflowing attendees caused the front porch to collapse, forcing Seymour to look for a new location. The group moved to an old African Methodist Episcopal church building at 312 Azusa Street in Los Angeles, and while legally incorporated as the Apostolic Faith Mission, it also became known as the Azusa Street Mission.

The revival quickly grew. Crowds of up to 1,500 packed into the small mission for the better part of three years. During the peak of the revival, meetings ran from mid-morning to midnight, seven days a week. Well-known names in the early Pentecostal movement like Parham, Lake, F. F. Bosworth, Thomas Hezmalhalch, and many others attended the revival and then took what they had received to the mission fields.
From the beginning, the movement was racially egalitarian. Blacks and whites worshiped together at the same altar, against the normal segregation of the day. Seymour claimed that the Holy Spirit was bringing people together across all social lines and boundaries to the revival. He not only rejected the existing racial barriers in favor of &quot;unity in Christ&quot;, but he also rejected the then almost-universal barriers to women in any form of church leadership. Latinos soon began attending as well, after a Mexican-American worker received the Holy Spirit baptism on April 13, 1906.

Seymour was clearly the leader of the Azusa revival in the beginning. He delegated authority to twelve overseers, ordained ministers, and commissioned missionaries. He also began publishing a newspaper, &quot;The Apostolic Faith&quot;, in September 1906. Within one year, the circulation of Seymour&#x27;s paper reached 40,000 issues. With the notable exception of Parham, who was uncomfortable with the mixing of races at Azusa, many other prominent holiness preachers, like G.B. Cashwell and C.H. Mason, made the pilgrimage to Los Angeles to preach and pray alongside Seymour.

The resulting movement became widely known as Pentecostalism, likening it to the manifestations of the Holy Spirit recorded as occurring in the first two chapters of the book of Acts, from the day of the Feast of Pentecost onwards. By the end of 1909, the movement had achieved geographical ubiquity. Every region of the United States had a Pentecostal presence, with additional missions planted in 50 nations worldwide.

==Decline of the Azusa Street Revival==
===Opposition===

As with most new religious movements, the Azusa Street Revival was not without controversy. Newspapers published such titles as, &quot;Religious Fanaticism Creates Wild Scene&quot;, &quot;Holy Kickers Carry on Mad Orgies&quot;, &quot;All Night Meetings in Azusa Street Church, Negroes and Whites Give Themselves Over to Strange Outbursts of Zeal&quot;, &quot;Whites And Blacks Mix in a Religious Frenzy&quot;, &quot;Wives Say They Left Husbands to Follow Preacher&quot;, &quot;Disgusting Scenes at Azusa Street Church&quot;, and &quot;Crazed Girls in Arms of Black Men.&quot;

In October 1906, Parham arrived at the Azusa Street Mission. After observing some ecstatic practices and racial mixing in worship, he went to the pulpit and began to preach that God was disgusted at the state of the revival. Seymour refused to back down from his doctrines, and Parham then denounced the Azusa revival as false. Parham launched a racially tinged assault on what he deemed fanaticism and religious anarchy and demanded reforms that included the outright dismissal of many of Seymour&#x27;s key aides. He claimed that Seymour had corrupted the teaching of tongue-speech; Parham believed that the spoken tongues had to be a recognizable human language (xenoglossy), while Seymour&#x27;s theology allowed for a divine language that could not be understood by human ears (glossolalia). Parham denounced these views as unscriptural. Parham also preached against the racial mixing of the revival. Seymour responded by recanting an earlier acknowledgement of Parham&#x27;s authority and declaring the Holy Ghost to be the mission&#x27;s only leader.

Parham became the most far-reaching challenge to Seymour&#x27;s leadership. Seymour dismissed Parham from the mission, but he stayed in town long enough to establish a small, competing congregation just blocks from the mission. Parham also appealed to the press to recognize him as the leader of the movement. The Seymour–Parham breakup marked the beginning of the end of Parham&#x27;s prominence in the movement; however, as it turned out, Azusa&#x27;s days were also numbered. The peak of the revival spanned from 1906 through 1908.

===Apostolic Faith publication===

The revival at Azusa continued to grow until 1908. Parham and other evangelists such as Florence Crawford (Seymour&#x27;s former State Director of the Pacific Coast Apostolic Faith Movement) began discrediting the movement through doctrinal differences. After breaking her relationship with Seymour in 1907, Crawford quickly formed an independent work in Portland, Oregon, under the same name Seymour used, Apostolic Faith Movement. She then began to undermine Seymour&#x27;s undisputed leadership of the movement on the Pacific Coast. Seymour&#x27;s marriage to Jennie Evans Moore on May 13, 1908, did not sit well with his secretary, Clara Lum, who had already begun showing allegiance to Crawford. Lum had arguably the most powerful position outside of Seymour in the movement because of her extensive experience and abilities, particularly as editor of the newspaper. Disapproving of Seymour&#x27;s action, Lum resigned her post, stole the paper&#x27;s mailing list and joined Crawford in Portland, where they began publishing &quot;The Apostolic Faith&quot; newspaper without Seymour.

Without possession of the mailing list, Seymour lost control of the newspaper, and his authority over the burgeoning Pentecostal revival began to slip. Lum and Crawford refused to give control of the paper back to Seymour when he and others went to Portland, and with no recourse left to him, he returned empty-handed to Los Angeles. The loss of the newsletter was a crippling blow to the Azusa revival. Seymour remained the pastor of the Apostolic Faith Mission until his death, but his significant contributions to the larger American Pentecostal movement were largely minimized by his contemporaries.

===Seymour&#x27;s last years===

Another blow to Seymour&#x27;s authority in the later movement was the split between Seymour and William Durham. During one of Seymour&#x27;s revival tours in 1911, he asked Durham if he would serve as the visiting preacher while he was gone. Durham agreed, but his views on sanctification caused a schism in the church. Seymour was asked to return to Azusa immediately, while his wife Jennie padlocked Durham out of the mission. Durham began to attack Seymour publicly, launching a rhetoric campaign claiming that Seymour was no longer following the will of God and was not fit to be a leader. This did further harm to Seymour&#x27;s ministry. Even after Durham&#x27;s sudden death in 1912, the Pentecostal community in Los Angeles remained split.

Although his message had spread around the world, by 1914 Seymour&#x27;s congregation on Azusa Street had shrunk to a small, local, Black American church. He continued as pastor until his death. On September 28, 1922, Seymour suffered two heart attacks and died in his wife&#x27;s arms. He was buried in Evergreen Cemetery in East Los Angeles, near influential Pentecostal preacher Francisco Olazábal. Jennie Seymour died on July 2, 1936, and was buried next to her husband.

==Legacy and influence==

Under Seymour&#x27;s leadership, the Azusa Street Mission sent evangelists throughout the United States, spreading the Pentecostal message from Los Angeles all over the United States and resulting in many missions that modeled themselves after Azusa. By 1914, Pentecostalism had spread to almost every major U.S. city. All major American Pentecostal denominations can trace their origins to Azusa Street, including the Assemblies of God, the Church of God in Christ, the Church of God (Cleveland, Tennessee), the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World, the United Pentecostal Church, and the Pentecostal Holiness Church.

The mission&#x27;s doctrines quickly went around the world, with many of the missionaries spreading the new message having themselves been at the Azusa Street revival. By 1907, missionaries from Azusa Street had reached Mexico, Canada, Western Europe, the Middle East, West Africa, and parts of Asia. In the 21st century, estimates of worldwide Pentecostal membership range from 115 million to 400 million.

<text>The Council of Asian Liberals and Democrats (CALD) is a regional organization of liberal democratic political parties in Asia.

== History and details ==
The Council was created on 10 December 1993, in a meeting in Taipei, Taiwan. There are nine member parties, an associate member, and one party with observer status. Currently, many democrats in Asia have a relationship with CALD. CALD has also opened its membership to like-minded individuals, and regularly engages with non-member political parties from Japan and South Korea with which it shares the same democratic values. The Democratic Party of Japan is one of the examples. 

For the convenience of particular members, they also accept individual members, like the situation in Hong Kong. The Democratic Party of Hong Kong is represented in CALD by Martin Lee and Sin Chung Kai. The third individual member of the CALD was Indonesia&#x27;s ex-President Abdurrahman Wahid (1940–2009). Aung San Suu Kyi and Corazon Aquino (1933–2009) are honorary members of CALD.

The CALD has been sanctioned by the People&#x27;s Republic of China for allegedly promoting Taiwanese independence. The council has called the sanctions unfortunate and said they would not undermine the advocacy work it is engaged in.

<doc id="847520" wikidata="Q2578356" url="?curid=847520" title="William Creek, South Australia">
<text>William Creek, in the Outback region of the Australian state of South Australia, is an isolated township with a population of fewer than 20. It is located about half-way along the Oodnadatta Track, north-west of Marree and east of Coober Pedy.

==Location==
William Creek is the entry point from Coober Pedy to Lake Eyre in the Tirari Desert. William Creek offers the only petrol station between Marree, Coober Pedy and Oodnadatta on the Oodnadatta Track and has a campground, two motels and one of the world&#x27;s most remote pubs. The world&#x27;s largest cattle station is located in nearby Anna Creek Station and the Woomera Prohibited Area is also nearby.

William Creek is a convenient half-way stop along the track, with accommodation and meals at the hotel and a well-maintained if somewhat dusty campground. In the Memorial Park it is possible to see many diverse items, including a commemorative inscription to a young Austrian woman, who died in 1998 trying to walk back to William Creek from a four-wheel drive vehicle bogged in the sand beside Lake Eyre. The first stage of the Black Arrow rocket, Britain&#x27;s only successful independent space launch, was recovered from the surrounding Anna Creek cattle station and placed in the memorial park for nearly 50 years but has been taken to the UK by technology firm Skyrora.

William Creek is serviced twice weekly by the Coober Pedy Oodnadatta One Day Mail Run. The four-wheel-drive mail truck also carries some general freight and passengers.

==History==
William Creek is on the traditional lands of the Arabana people. In 2012, the Federal Court granted the Arabana people native title to more than 68,000 square kilometres in the region.

The name William Creek was given to the area in November 1859 by explorer John McDouall Stuart during his expeditions in the area. William was the second son of John Chambers, a pioneer pastoralist of South Australia and a strong ally of Stuart.

A small settlement arose in 1889 as a result of the arrival of the Great Northern railway – later named the Central Australia Railway and now popularly known as the Ghan line, after the train that operated on the line. Construction commenced in 1878 near Port Augusta and reached William Creek in 1889. Work on the line continued, ultimately linking Port Augusta to Oodnadatta, which became the northern railhead until the late 1920s. As large work parties flowed into the area, a boarding house was established in 1886 and James Jagoe&#x27;s Eating House is recorded there in 1886. In 1890, Henry Lane received a wine licence for the site and assume Jagoe&#x27;s business and facilities. In 1911, Gilbert Reed described a whistle-stop on a train journey to Oodnadatta; he ate at Paige&#x27;s boarding house, where the meal was goat, dressed up as mutton.

In 1896, a telegraph office was opened – William Creek became a repeater station on the Australian Overland Telegraph Line. It replaced nearby Strangways Springs which was decommissioned and reverted to pastoral lands.

Early tourists to the area were mesmerised by the vast expanses, the heat, the mound springs and the distances.

The town has always been small: never larger than a few cottages, a small school and a hotel-store. The historic William Creek Hotel is listed on the South Australian Heritage Register.

==Governance==
William Creek is in the federal electoral division of Grey and the state electoral district of Stuart. It is in the 63% of South Australia that is unincorporated, i.e. outside the jurisdiction of local government council areas; an area of , 2 times that of the United Kingdom. The 4500 residents in this area – less than 0.2% of the state&#x27;s population – receive municipal services from a state government agency, the Outback Communities Authority, in a hybrid management model involving local government and community self-management.

==Near William Creek==
Lake Eyre can be seen from several vantage points along the Oodnadatta Track and appears as a large white saltpan. It is only from the air that its immensity can be appreciated. The curvature of the Earth can be seen on the horizon and beneath it is possible to identify the courses of the ancient rivers that still occasionally flow into the lake. Trevor Wright and the pilots from Wrightsair take up to five passengers for a 60-minute flight out of William Creek, passing over the spectacular Painted Hills to the west, then along the southern edge of the lake, pointing out the features beneath and explaining the topography. The Painted Hills are brilliantly coloured eroded sandstone ridges. These, and all of the country traversed in the one-hour flight, are part of Anna Creek Station. From the air the Oodnadatta Track can be seen, stretching to the horizon in two directions.

<text>West Midlands Safari Park is a safari park located in Bewdley in Worcestershire, England. It was opened under the name of West Midland Safari Park in Spring 1973.

The park holds over 165 species of exotic animals and features other attractions such as a small theme park. The park contains the largest groups of white lions, cheetahs, hippopotamuses and meerkats in the UK, as well as the largest lemur walk-through exhibit. It was also the first park in the UK to have the African big five game animals.

The park is a member of the British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums (BIAZA) and the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA). The Dhole and Cheetah enclosures in the drive-through safari are part of a larger heathland Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), which the park is restoring.

==History==
The park was opened by founder Jimmy Chipperfield on 17 April 1973 and hosted a few former circus animals. The park also had a dolphin area where the sea lion theatre is today, but it was a travelling show and the dolphins were later returned to Margate. The 1970s also saw the park develop a &quot;boat safari&quot;, although it was later removed. A narrow-gauge railway through parts of the park was constructed by Severn Lamb in 1979.

In 2004, the park featured its first new animal attraction in some time with the arrival of four African white lions in the Kingdom of the White Lions exhibit. The park was the first safari park in the UK to have all five African big game animals, although its leopards have since been moved to Scotland and the last remaining Cape buffalo left in 2022. It was also the first park or zoo in Europe to successfully breed white lion cubs and has made efforts to conserve the species.

In 2006, the managing directors of West Midland Safari Park officially opened the Ongava Research Centre on the Ongava Game Reserve near the Etosha National Park, their &quot;sister park&quot; in Namibia. The centre focuses on researching lions and rhinoceroses and carrying capacity of the reserves, which hold many rare animals. The centre has three full-time researchers who work closely with Save the Rhino and the University of Cape Town.

In June 2023 following public feedback, the drive through safari must be pre booked via an allocated time slot which is included in the admission when pre booked or can be booked at the main ticket office for free at the Lost City Plaza. You can only drive through the safari once per visit 

On 8 February 2024 the safari announced it would be adding the &#x27;s&#x27; to Midland and renaming West Midlands Safari Park.

<text>Stoddard-Hamilton Aircraft, based in Arlington, Washington, was a designer and supplier of high-performance homebuilt aircraft kits, offering parts and plans to homebuilders. The company&#x27;s popular &quot;Glasair&quot; aircraft series are low wing, two-seat (side by side) fiberglass designs.

The Glasair TD of 1979 was the first pre-molded composite aircraft kit on the general aviation market, introduced at the 1980 EAA Oshkosh Airshow. The company was started by Tom Hamilton and named, tongue in cheek, after the style of large aircraft manufacturers in the United States. Using Hamilton&#x27;s middle and last name, the company was incorporated as Stoddard-Hamilton.

Retractable gear and up-engined models were later introduced, with the Glasair III Turbo capable of speeds in excess of , and another model being fitted with a turboprop engine. In the mid-1990s, Glasair introduced the Glastar, a high-wing, short-field capable utility aircraft with two seats.

In 2001, Thomas W. Wathen purchased the assets of the Glasair from bankrupt Stoddard-Hamilton Aircraft. He combined New Glasair LLC with New GlaStar LLC and continued production of the Glasair and GlaStar kits at the Arlington factory, marketing them under the Glasair Aviation name.

<doc id="847524" wikidata="Q5099513" url="?curid=847524" title="Chin music">
<text>Chin music is a slang term with several different meanings.

==Street slang==
In American slang, &quot;chin music&quot; is a term for idle talk. In the US it dates back at least a century — &quot;There&#x27;s too much chin music an&#x27; too little fightin&#x27; in this war, anyhow&quot; is a quote from Stephen Crane&#x27;s 1895 novel &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot; — and is recorded in Australian newspapers from as early as 1836. It can alternatively be used as a euphemism for punching someone in the jaw.

==Baseball==

In baseball slang, it means a pitch that is thrown near the batter&#x27;s face. The pitcher&#x27;s intent may be to cause the batter to move &quot;back&quot; such that it is more difficult to hit a future outside pitch, to frighten the batter into a poorer batting approach, to intimidate opposing batters, or to actually hit the batter with the pitch. If the umpire suspects the pitcher of either of the latter two intentions, he may eject the pitcher immediately or warn both teams that any similar pitch will result in automatic ejection. The pitcher&#x27;s manager may also be ejected or warned if the umpire believes the manager ordered the beanball.

In the late 1800s, at baseball&#x27;s inception, the phrase &quot;chin music&quot; was used to describe razzing or heckling from the fans. It began being used as a synonym for a brushback pitch around World War II.

==Cricket==

In cricket, chin music is a term for a bowling strategy where bouncers are aimed at the batsman&#x27;s throat or chin. Rising rapidly off the pitch, the ball is difficult to play unless the batsman has quick footwork. If fended rather than avoided, it may yield a ballooned return catch to the bowler or to close-in fielders. This is a difficult ball to bowl, since a few inches on either side would present the batsman with a short ball that can be easily put away on either side of the pitch. It is not illegal in cricket, but the number of short deliveries allowed in an over is usually restricted, and bowlers who exceed this may get a warning from the umpire or may lead to a no ball, often given a free hit.

<doc id="847530" wikidata="Q370967" url="?curid=847530" title="Rutan VariEze">
<text>The Rutan VariEze is a composite, canard aircraft designed by Burt Rutan. It is a high-performance homebuilt aircraft, hundreds of which have been constructed. The design later evolved into the Long-EZ and other, larger cabin canard aircraft. The VariEze is notable for popularizing the canard configuration and moldless glass cloth composite construction for homebuilt aircraft.

== Overview ==
Work on the VariEze design, which grew out of Rutan&#x27;s experience designing and building the VariViggen, began in 1974. The first prototype, designated Model 31 and registered N7EZ, first flew on May 21, 1975 after four months of construction. This aircraft used a Volkswagen engine conversion. Three months later it was shown at Oshkosh where Dick Rutan piloted it to an under 500 kg class distance record of . Rutan believed that by engaging in a program of breaking class records he could further fine-tune the design.

The aircraft was so popular at Oshkosh that Rutan redesigned the aircraft so that it could be sold as a set of plans. A second prototype, the Model 33, N4EZ, built using a larger wing, a Continental O-200 engine, and many other detail changes, was shown at Oshkosh in July 1976 and plans were offered for sale. Approximately 2000 aircraft were under construction by 1980, with about 300 flying by late 1980. Ultimately more VariEzes and Long-EZs (a derivative, slightly larger design) were constructed than any other homebuilt type of the time. The sale of plans ceased in 1985.

Rutan&#x27;s stated goals for the design included reduced susceptibility to departure/spin and efficient long range cruise; these goals were achieved. The use of a canard configuration allowed a stall-resistant design, at the price of somewhat increased takeoff and landing speeds and distances relative to a similar conventional design with effective flaps. The holder of the CAFE Challenge aircraft efficiency prize briefly was Gary Hertzler, set using a VariEze.

The prototypes flew originally with elevons on the canard for both pitch and roll control but the design was changed to pitch control with the canard elevators and roll control with mid span wing ailerons after a few aircraft were built.

While the airplane was resistant to pitch departures, a few builders discovered a potential for a novel lateral departure mode resulting from one winglet stalling at large sideslip angles. An outer wing leading edge droop (and later vortilons on some examples) was added to alleviate this problem and rudder travel was reduced.

The design&#x27;s stall resistance did not appear to translate to a lower accident rate than for other homebuilts; a review of the NTSB database from 1976 to 2005 shows 130 total accidents and 46 fatal accidents out of a fleet of about 800 (691 registered in 2005). Precise comparisons are difficult, however, because of the haphazard nature of data collection and analysis for accidents involving homebuilt airplanes.

The VariEze is subject to a 2.5g positive, 1.5g negative, maximum load factor limit applied after the discovery of problems with some VariEze wings.

In lieu of a parking brake, the nosewheel retracts and the nose rests on the ground. Referred to as kneeling, this eases access to the cockpit. Resting the nose on the ground also prevents the plane from tipping onto its rear when the pilot&#x27;s seat is unoccupied.

<doc id="847537" wikidata="Q828516" url="?curid=847537" title="Oodnadatta Track">
<text>The Oodnadatta Track is an unsealed outback road in the Australian state of South Australia, connecting Marla in the north-west via Oodnadatta to Marree in the south-east. Along the way, the track passes the settlements of Oodnadatta and William Creek, the southern lake of the Kati Thanda-Lake Eyre National Park, and mound springs known as Freeling Springs, Strangways Springs, and The Bubbler and Blanche Cup (Wabma Kadarbu Mound Springs).

Some maps show Oodnadatta Track as route D95, which, under the extended Australian alphanumeric road numbering system, belongs to a D road, a category distinct from a C road. However, the D95 is not signposted, as the Department for Infrastructure and Transport has a policy of not marking unsealed roads.

==History==
The track follows a traditional Australian Aboriginal trading route. Along the track are numerous springs feeding water from the Great Artesian Basin, the most accessible examples being the mound springs near Coward Springs, now in the Wabma Kadarbu Mound Springs Conservation Park. Later, because of the availability of water, the route was chosen for the steam-train powered Central Australia Railway, the original route of &quot;The Ghan&quot;. 

It was also the route taken by the explorer John McDouall Stuart on his third expedition in 1859. Remnants of the many railway sidings and bridges, the ruins of railway buildings, and Overland Telegraph Line repeater stations are located along the track – some of the best preserved are at the Coward Springs Campground – complete with a natural artesian spa and the abandoned Curdimurka railway siding. 

Angle Pole () is the point near Oodnadatta where the direction of the telegraph line changed to a more northerly direction. It is near the Peake cattle station, also known as &quot;The Peake&quot;, or Freeling Springs. The ruins of Peake telegraph station exist on the station today. Nearby Peake Creek was named after Edward John Peake by John McDouall Stuart in June 1859, hence Peake Station, which was acquired by Kidman Holdings in 1898.

The track was named by Adam Plate of the Oodnadatta Progress Association in about 1980, to form a trilogy of unsealed tourist routes with the Birdsville and Strzelecki Tracks nearby. This road has no major intersections.

==Route==
The Oodnadatta Track heads southeast from Marla to Oodnadatta, and then roughly follows the former Central Australia Railway further southeast, until meeting the sealed Outback Highway at Marree. The road&#x27;s surface has been well maintained in recent years. 

In dry weather, the track is passable to most vehicles and caravans. A four-wheel drive (4x4) vehicle gives a more comfortable journey, and is essential for driving the track during and after rain. Since the track is unsealed, the Government of South Australia recommends that users check whether it is open before departure.

==Major junctions==
Oodanadatta Track is entirely contained within the Outback Communities Authority local government area.

<text>Blundell&#x27;s School is an independent co-educational boarding and day school in the English public school tradition, located in Tiverton, Devon. It was founded in 1604 under the will of Peter Blundell, one of the richest men in England at the time, and moved to its present site on the outskirts of the town in 1882.

While the full boarding fees are £45,750 per year, the school offers several scholarships and bursaries, and provides flexi-boarding. The school has 360 boys and 225 girls, including 117 boys and 85 girls in the Sixth Form, and is a member of the Headmasters&#x27; and Headmistresses&#x27; Conference.

==History==


Peter Blundell, one of the wealthiest merchants of Elizabethan England, died in 1601, having made his fortune principally in the cloth industry. His will set aside considerable money and land to establish a school in his home town &quot;to maintain sound learning and true religion&quot;. Blundell asked his friend John Popham, Lord Chief Justice of England, to carry out his wishes, and appointed a number of local merchants and gentry as his first trustees (known as feoffees). The position of feoffee is no longer hereditary, but a number of notable local families have held the position for a considerable period: the first ancestor of the current chairman of the governors to hold that position was elected more than 250 years ago, and the Heathcoat-Amory family have a long tradition of service on the Governing Body, since Sir John Heathcoat-Amory was appointed in 1865.

The Old Blundell&#x27;s School was built to be much larger and grander than any other in the West Country, with room for 150 scholars and accommodation for a master and an usher. The Grade 1 listed building is now in the care of the National Trust and the forecourt is usually open to visitors. One ex-Blundell&#x27;s boy was the writer R. D. Blackmore, who in the novel &quot;Lorna Doone&quot; set the stage for a fight between John Ridd and Robin Snell on the Blundell&#x27;s triangular lawn.

Peter Blundell&#x27;s executors established links with Balliol College, Oxford, and with Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, and large sums were settled to provide for scholarships for pupils of the school to attend those colleges. 

The prep school St Aubyn&#x27;s was moved to the Blundell&#x27;s campus in 2000, taking over the day-boy house Milestones and the Sanatorium, and was renamed Blundell&#x27;s Prep School. It has about 250 pupils aged from three years to eleven. The headmaster is Andy Southgate.

===2024 attempted murder===

In 2024, a pupil at the school was found guilty of attempted murder of two other students and one of the staff using a hammer; he had been 16 at the time of the assaults in 2023. &quot;The Guardian&quot; said that 
&quot;a troubling picture emerged of aspects of life at the 400-year-old school&quot;, with bullying, children having weapons and unrestricted access to their mobile telephones.

The boy was sentenced to life in prison with a minimum of 12 years. In November 2024, Mrs Justice Cutts lifted the anonymity orders and named him as Thomas Wei Huang from Malaysia.

==Sport==
===Rugby===
Rugby is the main sport played at Blundell&#x27;s in the Autumn and Spring terms. The earliest mention of &quot;football&quot; in the Blundellian was in 1861 and the first recorded &quot;rugger&quot; match played by boys at Blundell&#x27;s was in 1868 against Tiverton Rugby Club, making the school one of the oldest anywhere formally to play the game. The Blundell&#x27;s crest still hangs in the main room at Twickenham in recognition of this.

OBs Dave Lewis Gloucester Rugby, Matt Kvesic and Will Carrick-Smith Exeter Chiefs all currently play in the Aviva Premiership.

Sam Maunder, brother of Jack Maunder, plays for England U18 squad.

===The Russell===
One annual tradition is the school&#x27;s cross-country run known as the Russell, named after Old Boy Jack Russell, a vicar and dog-breeder. It was first run in 1887, and 2009 saw the 129th run. 

==Southern Railway Schools Class==

The School lent its name to the thirty-third steam locomotive (Engine 932) in the Southern Railway&#x27;s Class V of which there were 40. This class was also known as the Schools Class because all 40 of the class were named after prominent English public schools. &quot;Blundell&#x27;s&quot;, as it was called, was built in 1934. The locomotive bearing the school&#x27;s name was withdrawn from service in January 1961. In 2009 Hornby produced a model of this particular Schools class locomotive. As the product photograph shows, while the name of this locomotive has been variously quoted as &quot;Blundells&quot; or &quot;Blundell&#x27;s&quot;, the apostrophe does actually appear on the nameplate.

==Old Blundellians==
The first known society of former pupils, known as Old Blundellians (OBs), was established as early as 1725.

William Hogarth engraved the letterhead for the invitation to a dinner for former pupils of the School in 1725 and the ticket for Tiverton School Feast in 1740.

<doc id="847558" wikidata="Q2709591" url="?curid=847558" title="Confusion matrix">
<text>In the field of machine learning and specifically the problem of statistical classification, a confusion matrix, also known as error matrix, is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm, typically a supervised learning one; in unsupervised learning it is usually called a matching matrix. 

Each row of the matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class, or vice versa – both variants are found in the literature. The diagonal of the matrix therefore represents all instances that are correctly predicted. The name stems from the fact that it makes it easy to see whether the system is confusing two classes (i.e. commonly mislabeling one as another). 

It is a special kind of contingency table, with two dimensions (&quot;actual&quot; and &quot;predicted&quot;), and identical sets of &quot;classes&quot; in both dimensions (each combination of dimension and class is a variable in the contingency table).

==Example==
Given a sample of 12 individuals, 8 that have been diagnosed with cancer and 4 that are cancer-free, where individuals with cancer belong to class 1 (positive) and non-cancer individuals belong to class 0 (negative), we can display that data as follows:

Assume that we have a classifier that distinguishes between individuals with and without cancer in some way, we can take the 12 individuals and run them through the classifier. The classifier then makes 9 accurate predictions and misses 3: 2 individuals with cancer wrongly predicted as being cancer-free (sample 1 and 2), and 1 person without cancer that is wrongly predicted to have cancer (sample 9).

Notice, that if we compare the actual classification set to the predicted classification set, there are 4 different outcomes that could result in any particular column. One, if the actual classification is positive and the predicted classification is positive (1,1), this is called a true positive result because the positive sample was correctly identified by the classifier. Two, if the actual classification is positive and the predicted classification is negative (1,0), this is called a false negative result because the positive sample is incorrectly identified by the classifier as being negative. Third, if the actual classification is negative and the predicted classification is positive (0,1), this is called a false positive result because the negative sample is incorrectly identified by the classifier as being positive. Fourth, if the actual classification is negative and the predicted classification is negative (0,0), this is called a true negative result because the negative sample gets correctly identified by the classifier.

We can then perform the comparison between actual and predicted classifications and add this information to the table, making correct results appear in green so they are more easily identifiable.

The template for any binary confusion matrix uses the four kinds of results discussed above (true positives, false negatives, false positives, and true negatives) along with the positive and negative classifications. The four outcomes can be formulated in a 2×2 &quot;confusion matrix&quot;, as follows:
The color convention of the three data tables above were picked to match this confusion matrix, in order to easily differentiate the data.

Now, we can simply total up each type of result, substitute into the template, and create a confusion matrix that will concisely summarize the results of testing the classifier:
In this confusion matrix, of the 8 samples with cancer, the system judged that 2 were cancer-free, and of the 4 samples without cancer, it predicted that 1 did have cancer. All correct predictions are located in the diagonal of the table (highlighted in green), so it is easy to visually inspect the table for prediction errors, as values outside the diagonal will represent them. By summing up the 2 rows of the confusion matrix, one can also deduce the total number of positive (P) and negative (N) samples in the original dataset, i.e. formula_1 and formula_2.

==Table of confusion==
In predictive analytics, a table of confusion (sometimes also called a confusion matrix) is a table with two rows and two columns that reports the number of &quot;true positives&quot;, &quot;false negatives&quot;, &quot;false positives&quot;, and &quot;true negatives&quot;. This allows more detailed analysis than simply observing the proportion of correct classifications (accuracy). Accuracy will yield misleading results if the data set is unbalanced; that is, when the numbers of observations in different classes vary greatly. 

For example, if there were 95 cancer samples and only 5 non-cancer samples in the data, a particular classifier might classify all the observations as having cancer. The overall accuracy would be 95%, but in more detail the classifier would have a 100% recognition rate (sensitivity) for the cancer class but a 0% recognition rate for the non-cancer class. F1 score is even more unreliable in such cases, and here would yield over 97.4%, whereas informedness removes such bias and yields 0 as the probability of an informed decision for any form of guessing (here always guessing cancer).

According to Davide Chicco and Giuseppe Jurman, the most informative metric to evaluate a confusion matrix is the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC).

Other metrics can be included in a confusion matrix, each of them having their significance and use.

== Confusion matrices with more than two categories ==

Confusion matrix is not limited to binary classification and can be used in multi-class classifiers as well. The confusion matrices discussed above have only two conditions: positive and negative. For example, the table below summarizes communication of a whistled language between two speakers, with zero values omitted for clarity.

<doc id="847565" wikidata="Q5598698" url="?curid=847565" title="Great Barr">
<text>Great Barr is a large and loosely defined area to the north-west of Birmingham, in the county of the West Midlands, England. The area was historically in Staffordshire, and the parts now in Birmingham were once known as Perry Barr, which is still the name of an adjacent Birmingham district. Other parts still known as Great Barr are now in the Metropolitan Boroughs of Walsall and Sandwell.

&quot;Barr&quot; means &quot;hill&quot;, and the name refers to nearby Barr Beacon. The name Barr Magna is used on some old maps. Others show it as &quot;Gt. Barr&quot;.

==History==


Samuel Taylor, an itinerant Methodist preacher, visited Great Barr in 1792 and remarked &quot;preached at Barr, a village famous for nothing as having given birth to Francis Asbury of America and being the present residence of his parents, at whose house we preached&quot;.

Great Barr was largely rural until the early 20th century, though it was influenced by the early stages of the industrial revolution which affected the nearby towns of Birmingham and the Black Country. The Staffordshire parish of Barr straddled the route from Birmingham to Walsall. Birmingham&#x27;s historian William Hutton was surprised to see so many nail-making workshops in the area. He noted that &quot;in some of these workshops I observed one, or more, females, stripped of their upper garments, and not overcharged with the lower, wielding the hammer with all the grace of their sex&quot;.

At that time the area was on the main drovers&#x27; routes which saw trains of horses taking coal from Walsall and Wednesbury to the factories and furnaces of Birmingham. At the Scott Arms there was a weekly cattle market which attracted large crowds. The Scott Arms and the Malt Shovel public house in Newton, did a roaring trade with drunkenness, cockfighting, and gambling common. Francis Asbury referred to it as &quot;a dark place called Great Barre&quot;

The rural economy was dominated by four great landowning families, the Wryley Birches, Dartmouths, Scotts and Goughs. The parish was series of tiny hamlets: Howell&#x27;s Row, Sneal&#x27;s Green, Newton, Margaret&#x27;s Lane, Queslett, the Common, Bourn Pool, Bourn Vale, the Tamworth Road, the Gough Arms Inn (later called the Beacon Inn) and around Barr Hall. In 1817 there were 120 houses occupied by 127 families, 78 of whom were engaged in agriculture and 30 in trade. These trades included a tailor, boarding house owner, a wheelwright, a butcher, a grocer, who doubled as a constable, a shoemaker, two brick makers, a maltster, gun lock maker, three blacksmiths, and four spectacle frame makers.

Great Barr was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Aldridge, in 1866 Great Barr became a separate civil parish, which in 1894 became part of Walsall Rural District. The 1901 census recorded a population of 1,344 and by 1921 this had increased to 2,232. A 1919 report on health and sanitation in Walsall Rural District describes the parish of Great Barr as extensive, almost entirely rural and having a scattered population, with the exception of residential Streetley. 

By 1931 the population had grown to 3,294 and in that year Great Barr parish was reduced in size by transfers of land to West Bromwich, Walsall, and Sutton Coldfield parishes. In 1934 Walsall Rural District was abolished and Great Barr was transferred to Aldridge Urban District. By 1951 the population of Great Barr had reached 12,648. On 1 April 1966 Aldridge Urban District was abolished to form Aldridge Brownhills Urban District, part also went to West Bromwich. In 2015 the two local government wards in the Metropolitan Borough of Sandwell, which now cover much of Great Barr, had a combined electorate of 18,840 adults.

By the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 it was a busy residential area with good road connections to West Bromwich, Walsall and Birmingham.

Expansion continued after the war, and during the 1960s the area received a motorway link when Junction 7 of the newly built M6 motorway was opened on the A34. It is also located close to the starting point of the M5, which can be accessed just one mile (1.6 km) northwards on the M6.

On 11 August 1975, eight-year-old local schoolgirl Helen Bailey was found dead from a single knife wound, in woods near Booths Farm. Her killer was never found.

Kidnapper Michael Sams abducted estate agent Stephanie Slater from a house in Turnberry Road, Great Barr before holding her for eight days in January 1992. Following receipt of £175,000 ransom, Sams released her. Police arrested him three weeks later and he was sentenced to life imprisonment for abducting Slater and murdering Leeds prostitute Julie Dart.

==Geography==
The modern centre of Great Barr is focussed on the busy junction of the A34 and A4041 roads, at the Scott Arms public house and shopping centre. This is named after the Scott family of Great Barr Hall, which was once home of Samuel Galton and a meeting place of the Lunar Society.

However, the name is also loosely applied to a swathe of the West Midlands bounded by junction 8 of the M6 motorway in the west, the Birmingham – Walsall railway line (part of the former Grand Junction Railway, opened in 1837, and including Hamstead railway station, formerly called Great Barr station) and Perry Barr to the south, Kingstanding to the east, and the open countryside of Barr Beacon to the north.


Great Barr includes much of the B42, B43 and B44 postcode areas.

== Namesakes ==
Barr Limestone is a type of rock first identified in Great Barr. The specific name of the fossil trilobite species &quot;Bumastus barriensis&quot;, roughly meaning &quot;of Barr&quot;, comes from its common name among collectors, the &quot;Barr trilobite&quot;, referring to its plentiful occurrence in these formations, at Great Barr.

==Places of interest==
Bishop Asbury Cottage (incorrectly named as &quot;Bishop Ashbury&#x27;s Cottage&quot; on Ordnance Survey maps), was where Francis Asbury, the first American Methodist Bishop, was raised. It is owned by Sandwell Council and is Grade II listed. It is open by appointment for group visits, and opens occasionally to the general public.

Great Barr Hall is a Grade II* listed building, and due its current state of disrepair is not open to the public. St. Margaret&#x27;s Church stands nearby.
Red House Park is open to the public and provides important amenities for the local community. It is owned by the Sandwell Council. In the grounds are both the Red House itself and an obelisk erected in memory of Princess Charlotte who died in childbirth in November 1817. The Red House, a country house also used a convalescent home, and then a community centre, is Grade II listed building, but is no longer open to the public, having been sold in 2015 and converted to residential apartments.

Birmingham Canal Navigations&#x27; Tame Valley Canal runs through Great Barr, from Piercy Aqueduct at Hamstead, along a cutting in 200-million year old sandstone, under Freeth bridge at Tower Hill, under the A34 and into Perry Barr Locks at Perry Barr.

<text>Gordon Mumma (born March 30, 1935, in Framingham, Massachusetts) is an American composer. He is known most for his work with electronics, many devices of which he builds himself, and for his performances on horn.

==Biography==
Mumma entered the University of Michigan in 1952 at age 17, after dropping out of high school. He dropped out of Michigan after a year, but the connections he made in Ann Arbor were the foundation of much of his musical career. His early work was in piano, and his musical development drew on traditional composers such as Bach and Haydn, as well as modern composers such as Bartók, Schoenberg, Webern, and Ives.

Mumma&#x27;s performances on piano were often in the context of piano ensembles, partnered with John Cage, David Tudor, and other performers. He toured internationally in the 1960s in a two-piano performance collaboration with Robert Ashley. He cofounded Ann Arbor&#x27;s Cooperative Studio for Electronic Music with Ashley in 1958–66, was a cofounder of the ONCE Festival in 1961–66 in Ann Arbor, was a resident composer with the Merce Cunningham Dance Company alongside Cage and Tudor from 1966–74, and was a member of the Sonic Arts Union with Ashley, Alvin Lucier, and David Behrman.

Mumma was professor of music at the University of California-Santa Cruz from 1975 to 1994, where his composition students included Chris Brown, Joe Hannan, Dan Keller, Daniel James Wolf, Jonathan Segel, and Mamoru Fujieda. Mumma also has a close association with Mills College in Oakland, California, where he was the Darius Milhaud Professor in 1981, Distinguished Visiting Composer in 1989, and Jean Macduff Vaux Composer-in-Residence in 1999. He was awarded a Foundation for Contemporary Arts John Cage Award (2000).

Mumma currently lives in Victoria, British Columbia, where he continues to compose.

<text>Gorbonianus (&quot;Welsh:&quot; &quot;Gorviniaw map Morydd&quot;) was a legendary king of the Britons as recounted by Geoffrey of Monmouth. He came to power in 349BC. He was the eldest son of King Morvidus, and the brother of Archgallo, Elidurus, Ingenius, and Peredurus.

According to Geoffrey, Gorbonianus was unlike many kings in that he loved equity and ruled frugally. He often would pay his respects to the gods and ruled his people with common justice and laws. Many temples were built or restored in his reign and the kingdom grew increasingly more wealthy. Protection was given to the country farmers from their masters. He gave wealth to his soldiers as to stop unnecessary violence against the peasantry or neighbours.

He reigned for some time then died and was buried in Trinovantum. He was succeeded by his brother, Archgallo, who was deposed for his wickedness, and the kingship passed back and forth among the sons of Morvidus for several years. After the death of the final brother, Elidurus, the kingship passed to an unnamed son of Gorbonianus, who Layamon calls Lador.

<text>Georgy Vasilyevich Chicherin (or Tchitcherin; ; 24 November 1872 – 7 July 1936) was a Russian Marxist revolutionary and a Soviet politician who served as the first People&#x27;s Commissar for Foreign Affairs in the Soviet government from March 1918 to July 1930.

==Childhood and early career==
A distant relative of Alexander Pushkin, Georgy Chicherin was born into an old noble family. He was born on the estate of his uncle, Boris Chicherin, in Karaul, Tambov. His father, Vasily N. Chicherin, was a diplomat employed by the Foreign Office of the Russian Empire. 
His uncle was an influential legal philosopher and historian. As a young man, Chicherin became fascinated with history; classical music, especially Richard Wagner; and Friedrich Nietzsche, passions that he would pursue throughout his life. He wrote a book about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and spoke all major European languages and a number of Asian ones. After graduating from St. Petersburg University with a degree in history and languages, Chicherin worked in the archival section of the Russian Ministry for Foreign Affairs from 1897 to 1903.

In 1904, Chicherin inherited the estate of his famous uncle in Tambov Governorate and became very wealthy. He immediately used his new fortune to support revolutionary activities in the runup to the Russian Revolution of 1905 and was forced to flee abroad to avoid arrest late in that year. He spent the next 13 years in London, Paris and Berlin, where he joined the Menshevik faction of the Russian Social Democratic Labor Party and was active in emigre politics. In Imperial Germany, Chicherin allegedly sought medical treatment in a nursing home to cure his homosexuality.

==Antiwar activity in Britain==
With the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Chicherin adopted an antiwar position, which brought him closer to Vladimir Lenin&#x27;s Bolsheviks. In 1915 he moved to Britain, where he soon developed a friendship with Mary Bridges-Adams, an activist with the Plebs League and founding member of the Central Labour College. Both founded the Russian Political Prisoners and Exiles Relief Committee, an organisation continued a long tradition in British society to support the victims of tsarist repression, but it realigned its focus to build support from organised labour, rather than searching for wealthy patrons. The aim of the committee was to collect money to send to revolutionaries incarcerated in tsarist prisons, but under Chicherin&#x27;s skilful watch, the aim was extended to cover the broader political aim of systematic agitation against tsarism itself.

In 1917, he was arrested by the British government for his antiwar writings, and he spent a few months in Brixton Prison.

==Bolshevik government==
The Bolsheviks had come to power in Russia after the October Revolution of 1917. The first head of the Commissariat of Foreign Affairs, which had replaced the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Leon Trotsky, secured Chicherin&#x27;s release and safe passage to Russia in exchange for British subjects who were being held in Russia, including George Buchanan, the British ambassador. Chicherin had now started to be in poor health and overweight.

Upon his return to Russia in early 1918, Chicherin formally joined the Bolsheviks, and was appointed as Trotsky&#x27;s deputy during the negotiations that led to the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. After the treaty was signed in late February 1918, Trotsky, who had advocated a different policy, resigned his position in early March. Chicherin became the acting head of the Commissariat and was appointed Commissar for Foreign Affairs on 30 May. On 2 March 1919, he was one of five men chairing the First Congress of the Comintern.

Chicherin followed a pro-German foreign policy in line with his anti-British attitudes, which he had developed during his time in the Foreign Ministry, when Britain was blocking Russian expansion in Asia. In 1920, he even suggested to Lenin, who agreed, that English workers should be formed into volunteer units. Soviet armies were nearing Warsaw, but nothing came of the idea.

In July 1918, his close friend, Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, became the new German ambassador after his predecessor, Count Wilhelm Mirbach, was shot in the Left SR uprising.

In 1922, Chicherin participated in the Genoa Conference and signed the Treaty of Rapallo with Germany. He begged Lenin to avoid wrecking the Genoa Conference since he believed that would make it easier to get foreign loans. Chicherin pursued a policy of collaboration with Germany and developed a closer working relationship with Brockdorff-Rantzau. 

Chicherin also held diplomatic negotiations with the papal nuncio Eugenio Pacelli, the future Pope Pius XII, on the status of the Roman Catholic Church in the newly formed Soviet Union.

On 10 April 1923, Chicherin wrote a letter to fellow Politburo member Joseph Stalin, in which he described the international political fallout from the recent show trial and execution in the Lubyanka Prison on Easter Sunday of Monsignor Konstanty Budkiewicz. In America, France, and the United Kingdom, efforts to gain diplomatic recognition for the USSR had suffered a major setback. In Westminster, Labour MPs had been flooded by petitions &quot;demanding the defense of Cieplak and Budkiewicz&quot;, by &quot;worker&#x27;s organizations&quot;, &quot;dying socialists&quot;, and &quot;professionalists&quot;. In the United States, Progressive Republican Senator William Borah had been about to discuss possible recognition of the USSR with U.S. Secretary of State Charles Evans Hughes. Due to the American people&#x27;s outrage over Budkiewicz&#x27;s execution, the meeting had been cancelled and the senator had been forced to indefinitely postpone the founding of a committee to press for diplomatic negotiations. Chicherin further explained to Stalin that the outside world saw the continuing Soviet anti-religious campaign, &quot;as nothing other than naked religious persecution.&quot; Chicherin also expressed fear that, if Russian Orthodox Patriarch Tikhon were also sentenced to death, the news would, &quot;worsen much further our international position in all our relations.&quot; He concluded by proposing &quot;the rejection in advance of the death sentence on Tikhon&quot;.

Chicherin is thought to have had more phone conversations with Lenin than anyone else. When Joseph Stalin replaced Lenin in 1924, Chicherin remained foreign minister, and Stalin valued his opinions. In 1928, Chicherin stated that he wanted an improved relationship with capitalist countries to encourage foreign investment. That policy had Stalin&#x27;s enthusiastic support and was approved by the Politburo in late 1927 and early 1928. Stalin said that &quot;it can hardly be doubted that Comrade Chicherin is better informed about the mood in foreign investment circles than any of us&quot;.

Although known for his workaholic habits, Chicherin was sidelined from November 1926 to June 1927 and from September 1928 until January 1930, while receiving medical treatment in Germany or in the French Riviera. Chicherin showed considerable courage in writing letters criticising politicians and policies that were being pursued. In February 1927, Chicherin criticized Nikolai Bukharin for his speeches that had a negative attitude to Soviet–German relations: &quot;This was particularly dangerous because of the deterioration of the relationship between the USSR and Britain.&quot; Chicherin said, &quot;At a time when the British are working against us, we must take care of our relationship with other states. We have to nurture such relationships.&quot;
On 3 June 1927, Chicherin, in a sanatorium in Germany, wrote about incidents that were detrimental to German–Soviet relations. He was exasperated &quot;by some comrades who can do no better than ruin all our work by attacking Germany, spoiling everything once and for all.&quot; When Kliment Voroshilov made a speech at the 1929 May Day Parade attacking the Weimar Republic, Chicherin wrote to the Politburo that the speech would do irreparable damage to German–Soviet relations.

Chicherin played a major role in establishing formal relations with China and in designing the Kremlin&#x27;s policy on China. He focused on the Chinese Eastern Railway, Manchuria, and the Mongolian issue.

== Personality ==
Chicherin was an eccentric, with obsessive work habits. Alexander Barmine, who worked in the People&#x27;s Commissariat for Foreign Affairs, noted that &quot;Chicherin was a man whose peculiar habits had to be respected. His workroom was completely buried in books, newspaper and documents ... He used to patter into our room in his shirt sleeves, wearing a large silk handkerchief round his neck and slippers adorned with metal buckles ... which, for comfort&#x27;s sake, he never troubled to fasten, making a clicking noise on the floor.&quot; Arthur Ransome noted, in 1919: 

==Later life==
In 1930 Chicherin was formally replaced by his deputy, Maxim Litvinov. A continuing terminal illness burdened his last years, which forced him away from his circle of friends and active work and led to an early death. When Chicherin died in 1936, the official state newspaper &quot;Izvestia&quot; summarised his character by describing him as highly educated, an exceptional diplomat and a sophisticated art lover.

After his death and until the Khrushchev Thaw, he was rarely mentioned in Soviet literature although he was mentioned in the &quot;Soviet Diplomatic Dictionary&quot; in an article occupying 52 pages in the 1950 edition, compared with Litvinov&#x27;s 92 pages and Vyacheslav Molotov&#x27;s 292 pages.

<doc id="847571" wikidata="Q285821" url="?curid=847571" title="NieA 7">
<text>, also known as NieA under 7, is a doujinshi manga series created by graphic designer Yoshitoshi Abe and later published by Kadokawa Shoten on their monthly &quot;Shōnen&quot; magazine &quot;Monthly Ace Next&quot; from October 1999 to January 2001. The manga revolves around a poor, introverted student named Mayuko Chigasaki, who lives above a Japanese bathhouse, and a freeloading, freewheeling outcast alien named NieA, who lives in Mayuko&#x27;s closet.

The manga is adapted into a 13-episode anime series by Triangle Staff and aired on WOWOW from April 16 to July 19, 2000. Much of the anime&#x27;s staff also worked on &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;, as producer Yasuyuki Ueda suggested the team work on a lighter anime as relief from the dark, heavily psychological &quot;Serial Experiments Lain&quot;. The character Chiaki, a ufology fanatic, shares a name with Chiaki J. Konaka, the script writer for &quot; Serial Experiments Lain&quot;.

==Plot==
Set in a retro-future setting, the series revolves around Mayuko Chigasaki, a high school graduate who goes to cram school in preparation for college. However, due to having no place to settle in, she decided to live in a bathhouse in the countryside, which is in a financial crisis due to having no customers. Even worse, she has to live with an alien girl named NieA, who has no antenna and is considered an &quot;under-seven&quot;, a class despised by other aliens due to being the lowest of their kind.

The series touches lightly upon issues of discrimination, stereotypes, social alienation, cultural assimilation and city life versus countryside living. Mayuko, who attends a cram school, is a young girl living away from her family and expresses a lot of melancholy. NieA, who is apparently placed in an inferior class by her fellow aliens due to being a physical minority among them, immediately accuses anyone who calls her a &quot;stupid no-antenna&quot; or the like, of discrimination. Other aliens adopt various stereotypical cultural styles, such as Chada who dresses in Indian attire and opens a convenience store, or Karna who chooses to associate herself with the Chinese Revolution. This theme of the outsider alien is carried through in the brief comic live-action sequence which ends each episode, &quot;Dalgit&#x27;s Tidbit of Indian Information.&quot;

==Characters==
:
:Mayuko &quot;Mayu&quot; Chigasaki is a student at the Ipponmatsu Cram School who lives in a rented room at the Enohana Bathhouse. She is hardworking, polite, honest, and very self-conscious. Mayuko spends all of her time and energy just making ends meet. She shares an apartment with NieA, who she often refers to as a &quot;freeloader&quot;.
:
:NieA is a lower-class or &quot;under-seven&quot; alien, who has no antenna. She lives with Mayuko and builds spaceships out of junk. She shares an apartment with Mayuko, who often argues with her about money and food.
:
:Genzo is Mayuko&#x27;s childhood friend who has dreadlocks and is stoic in nature. He is usually seen carrying sacks of rice or a bottle crate of bottled drinks as a present to Mayuko and NieA.
:

<doc id="847578" wikidata="Q6551608" url="?curid=847578" title="Linda Green">
<text>Linda Green is a British comedy-drama television series that aired on BBC One from 30 October 2001 to 17 December 2002. It was produced for the BBC by the independent Red Production Company. The series was created by Paul Abbott, and other writers to pen episodes included &quot;Sorted&quot; writer Danny Brocklehurst, Catherine Johnson and Russell T Davies. The producer was Phil Collinson.

==Plot==
The series focused on the life of the eponymous title character, a 30-something woman who works as a car saleswoman by day and sings in a club at night. It follows her various trials and tribulations in love and her relationships with her friends, in particular Jimmy McKenzie (Sean Gallagher), a mechanic at the car showroom where Linda works, and with whom she enjoys sexual relations when she feels like it, Michelle Fenton (Claire Rushbrook), a chiropodist, and Darren Alexander (Daniel Ryan), a kitchen-fitter. The latter two characters are a cohabiting couple with children, Jamie (Lee Shepherd) and Leanne (Jodie Hamblet), and, in series 2, a new baby, Eric. Despite the demands of parenthood, Michelle and Darren enjoy frequent nights out, usually at the club, with Linda and Jimmy. Linda&#x27;s mother, Iris, who works as a clerk in the magistrates&#x27; court, is played by Rachel Davies, and her father, Frank, a deputy headteacher, by Dave Hill. Linda also has two siblings, both considerably younger than her: the very bright Katie (Jessica Harris), in whom Linda frequently confides, and the easy-going Philip, a.k.a. Fizz (Bruno Langley), who is hoping to join the Army, rather against his father&#x27;s wishes. As well as being the eldest child, Linda is also her father&#x27;s favourite, although he is always careful never to treat the other two less favourably. Both Frank and Iris are always ready to provide a shoulder to cry on when Linda is unhappy, usually as a result of a failed relationship. One of Linda&#x27;s former boyfriends, the much younger Ricky Pinder (John Donnelly), becomes a semi-regular in the show when he becomes Katie&#x27;s boyfriend. The other club singer, Coral (Jacinta Sloan) and the club comic (Danny De Bouy) also appear on a semi-regular basis.

==Cast==
Linda was played by Liza Tarbuck, who by then was best known as a television presenter, although she had originally trained as an actress and had had a starring role in ITV sitcom Watching for seven years from 1987. Individual episodes attracted well-known guest stars, such as Christopher Eccleston, David Morrissey, Simon Pegg, Pam Ferris, Anne Reid, Amelia Bullmore, George Costigan, Jamie Theakston, Martin Freeman, Peter Kay, Nicholas Gleaves, Maxine Peake, Meera Syal and Mark Benton. It also featured a guest appearance by Tarbuck&#x27;s father Jimmy Tarbuck, who played her ex-Army paternal uncle, Vic Green. Up and coming stand-ups Sarah Darlington and Jolanta Migdalska also feature. In addition, Andy Devine appeared in one episode as Linda and Jimmy&#x27;s abrasive and lecherous boss Syd Jenkins, a.k.a. &#x27;Syd With the Wife&#x27;.

==Renewal==
Although quite popular in its first season, the series proved less so in its second, and it was not renewed again after the second run had come to an end. The second series has never been released on DVD.

<doc id="847580" wikidata="Q7751265" url="?curid=847580" title="The Microphones">
<text>The Microphones were an American indie folk, indie rock, and experimental project from Olympia, Washington. The project was founded in 1996 and ended in 2003, with a short reunion following in 2007 and revivals in 2019 and 2020. Across every iteration of the Microphones, it has been fronted by Phil Elverum. Elverum is the principal songwriter and producer behind the band&#x27;s albums, but he has also collaborated with other local musicians on his other recordings and tours. Many of Elverum&#x27;s recordings from the project&#x27;s initial period were released by the label K Records.

Since 2003, Elverum has recorded and performed primarily under the name Mount Eerie. He played a one-off concert in Anacortes, WA under the name the Microphones in June 2019 and announced the release of the fifth and final Microphones album, &quot;Microphones in 2020&quot;, in August 2020.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
Phil Elverum became involved in the Washington music scene while working at the Business, a record store in his home town of Anacortes, in the mid-1990s. Elverum began experimenting with recording equipment in the back of the store, which led to the store&#x27;s owner Bret Lunsford releasing two cassettes (&quot;Microphone&quot; and &quot;Wires and Cords&quot;) on his label, KNW-YR-OWN. Elverum also played drums in Lunsford&#x27;s band, D+, before moving to Olympia in 1997 to attend Evergreen State College.

While in Olympia, Elverum caught the attention of K Records owner and musician Calvin Johnson. After recording for some time at the Dub Narcotic studios, Elverum was able to complete his first full-length album, a CD entitled &quot;Tests&quot;, which was released in 1998 on Elsinor Records. &quot;Tests&quot; combined songs from his earlier cassette releases and the recently recorded Dub Narcotic recordings. At the same time, Elverum released his first 7&quot; single, &quot;Bass Drum Dream&quot; on Up Records.

=== K Records years ===
Elverum slowly gained recognition as a talented producer and recording engineer in the studio. While helping, often anonymously, with many of the area&#x27;s artists, he began work on his second full-length, &quot;Don&#x27;t Wake Me Up&quot;, released on K Records in 1999. Elverum toured for a few months following the release with fellow K Records artist Mirah, and, showcasing his talents on the road, was able to build a small but loyal fanbase and gain appreciation in the indie music scene. While performing in another K Records band, Old Time Relijun, Elverum began recording &quot;It Was Hot, We Stayed in the Water&quot;. Released on K Records in 2000, the album was Elverum&#x27;s most ambitious yet, featuring layers of harmonic guitars, noise, and Beach Boys-esque harmonies.

Elverum&#x27;s next release, &quot;The Glow Pt. 2&quot;, was released by K Records in 2001. It was noted by critics for its production and songwriting. Probably his best-known album, it explored intensely personal themes, recalling lost loves and childhood memories. Sometimes sad, simple, and gentle (&quot;I Felt Your Shape&quot;), other times intense and layered with noise, guitars, and drums (&quot;The Moon&quot;). Pitchfork Media named &quot;The Glow Pt. 2&quot; as the top album of 2001, and #73 on their 200 Top Albums of the 2000s. Tiny Mix Tapes named it the 5th best album of the 2000s.

After a lengthy tour of Europe and North America (known as the &quot;Paper Opera Tour&quot;)&quot;&quot;, Elverum returned to Dub Narcotic to begin work on his follow-up to &quot;The Glow Pt.2&quot;. Released by K Records in 2003, &quot;Mount Eerie&quot; was named after the mountain on Fidalgo Island where Elverum spent much of his childhood. Containing five long songs, the album features a narrative arc, in which Elverum dies, is eaten by vultures, and discovers the face of the Universe. It represents a turning point and a realization period in Elverum&#x27;s life. Like its predecessor, &quot;Mount Eerie&quot; was also praised by critics for its ambitious and imaginative production.

=== Dissolution ===
Elverum toured North America and Europe again in 2002, playing mostly solo shows (billed as the &quot;I Will Move Away Forever and Never Come Back Ever&quot; tour) before settling in Finnkonevika, Kjerringøy, Norway, where he spent the winter living in a log cabin. In February 2003, he toured Japan with Calvin Johnson, Kyle Field, and the Tokyo band Moools, which resulted in the album &quot;Live in Japan&quot;. &quot;Live In Japan&quot; was released by K Records in early 2004, by which time Elverum had already begun to perform shows under the name Mount Eerie.

===Subsequent Microphones releases and performances===
In January 2007, a one-off 7&quot; single was released under the Microphones moniker, titled &quot;Two Songs by the Microphones&quot;. In 2008, &quot;The Glow Pt. 2&quot; was reissued by K Records with an additional disc of outtakes and rarities. In March 2011, Elv(e)rum re-recorded the Microphones&#x27; song &quot;I Lost My Wind&quot; for the compilation &quot;Collaborate With a 1940s Wire Recorder&quot;. In 2013, the Microphones&#x27; four studio albums (in addition to the singles compilation &quot;Song Islands&quot;) were remastered and reissued on Elverum&#x27;s own label, P.W. Elverum &amp; Sun, Ltd. In 2016, a compilation of the Microphones&#x27; early cassette releases was released as &quot;Early Tapes: 1996–1998.&quot;

Elverum played a one-off concert in Anacortes, WA under the name the Microphones in June 2019, performing alongside D+, Black Belt Eagle Scout, and Little Wings.

On August 7, 2020, Elverum released a new Microphones album: &quot;Microphones in 2020&quot;. The album is a 44:44 single song about Elverum&#x27;s own life and search of meaning.

On January 13, 2022, Elverum announced a comprehensive retrospective box set, &quot;Completely Everything, 1996–2021&quot; which contains the entire Microphones discography; Elverum also stated that it would be the final release from the Microphones.

== Style ==
According to Kyle Cochrun of &quot;PopMatters &quot;&quot;The band shirked traditional song structures, buried melodies under dissonance, added or abandoned the rhythm section at unexpected moments, caked guitar distortion on soft-spoken campfire jingles, relished in a decidedly scattershot soundscape, and dismantled any forward momentum they worked to build&quot;.

<doc id="847582" wikidata="Q3114830" url="?curid=847582" title="Great Seal of the Realm">
<text>The Great Seal of the Realm is a seal that is used in the United Kingdom to symbolise the sovereign&#x27;s approval of state documents. It is also known as the Great Seal of the United Kingdom (known prior to the Treaty of Union of 1707 as the Great Seal of England; and from then until the Union of 1801 as the Great Seal of Great Britain). To make it, sealing wax is melted in a metal mould or matrix and impressed into a wax figure that is attached by cord or ribbon to documents that the monarch wishes to seal officially. The formal keeper of the seal is the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain. 

Scotland has had its own great seal since the 14th century. The Acts of Union 1707, joining the kingdoms of Scotland and England, provided for the use of a single Great Seal for the new Kingdom of Great Britain. However, it also provided for the continued use of a separate Scottish seal to be used there, and this seal continues to be called the Great Seal of Scotland and used by the monarch to sign letters patent for bills of the Scottish Parliament. Similarly, a separate Great Seal of Ireland, which had been used in Ireland since the 13th century, continued in use after the union of 1801, until the secession of the Irish Free State, after which a new Great Seal of Northern Ireland was created for use in Northern Ireland. A new Welsh Seal was introduced in 2011.

==History==

At some time before the year 1066 Edward the Confessor began to use a &quot;Great Seal&quot;, which created a casting in wax of his own face, to signify that a document carried the force of his will. With some exceptions, each subsequent monarch up to 1603, when the king of Scotland succeeded to the throne of England, chose his or her own design for the Great Seal.

Levina Teerlinc is believed to have designed the seal of Queen Mary I, and also the earliest seal used by her successor Elizabeth I, in the 1540s.
When opening Parliament on 3 September 1654, the Lord Protector Oliver Cromwell was escorted by the three &quot;Commissioners of the Great Seal of the Commonwealth of England&quot;, who were Whitelock, Lisle, and Widdrington. This Seal was inscribed with &quot;The Great Seal of England, 1648&quot;, displaying a map of England, Ireland, Jersey, and Guernsey on one side, with the Arms of England and Ireland. On the other side was shown the interior of the House of Commons, the Speaker in his chair, with the inscription, &quot;In the first year of Freedom, by God&#x27;s blessing restored, 1648.&quot; In 1655, Cromwell appointed three Commissioners of the Great Seal of Ireland, Richard Pepys, Chief Justice of the Upper Bench, Sir Gerard Lowther, Chief Justice of the Common Bench; and Miles Corbet, Chief Baron of the Exchequer. But they held the seal only until 1656, when Cromwell nominated William Steele, Chief Baron of the Court of Exchequer in England, Lord Chancellor of Ireland.

In 1688, while attempting to flee to France during the Glorious Revolution, James II allegedly attempted to destroy his Great Seal by throwing it into the River Thames, in the hope that the machinery of government would cease to function. James&#x27;s successors, William III and Mary II, used the same seal matrix in their new Great Seal. This may have been a deliberate choice, in order to imply the continuity of government. A new obverse was created, but the reverse was crudely adapted by inserting a female figure beside the male figure. When Mary died, the obverse returned to the design used by James II, while the female figure was deleted from the reverse. Thus, William III used a seal that was identical to James II&#x27;s, except for changes to the legend and coat of arms. 

The 1922 secession from the United Kingdom of the Irish Free State impelled a change in the royal style, which was agreed at the 1926 Imperial Conference and effected by the Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927, after which a new Great Seal was struck with the new style. The 1927 act referred to the &quot;Great Seal of the Realm&quot; as opposed to the previously usual &quot;Great Seal of the United Kingdom&quot; on the basis that the latter designation was too narrow, ignoring the use of the seal in relation to other Dominions of the British Commonwealth. Edward VIII, who abdicated only a few months after succeeding to the throne, never selected a design for his own seal and continued to use that of his predecessor, George V. Only one matrix of the Great Seal exists at a time, and since the wax used for the Great Seal has a high melting point, the silver plates that cast the seal eventually wear out. The longer-lived British monarchs have had several Great Seals during their reigns, and Queen Victoria had to select four different Great Seal designs during her sixty-three years on the throne.

The last seal matrix of Elizabeth II was authorised by the Privy Council in July 2001. It was designed by James Butler and replaced that of 1953, designed by Gilbert Ledward. The obverse shows the middle-aged Elizabeth II enthroned and robed, holding in her right hand a sceptre and in her left the orb. The circumscription is an abbreviated form of the royal titles in . On the reverse are the full royal arms, including crest, mantling and supporters. This is the first time that the royal arms have provided the main design for one side of the English or British Great Seal. The obverse of the 1953 version depicted the Queen on horseback, dressed in uniform and riding sidesaddle, as she used to attend the annual Trooping the Colour ceremony for many years until the late 1980s. The seal&#x27;s diameter is , and the combined weight of both sides of the seal matrix exceeds . Charles III, , uses the seal of his mother and predecessor, having directed by Order in Council on 10 September 2022, &quot;that the Lord High Chancellor of Great Britain is authorised to make use of the Great Seal for sealing all things whatsoever that pass the Great Seal until another Great Seal be prepared and authorised by His Majesty&quot;.

==Design==

The Great Seal is two-sided, with separate matrices for the obverse and reverse, whose respective imprints are termed the seal and counterseal. The (obverse) seal contains an image of the monarch enthroned, encircled with the style of the monarch, usually in Latin. The counterseal usually contains an image of the monarch on horseback, encircled with either the same style of the monarch or a variant. Counterseals having non-equestrian images were that of Edward the Confessor (a variant of the seal image); the second of Anne (Britannia); the first of George V (the king as an Admiral of the Fleet); and the second of Elizabeth II (the royal arms).

The Wafer Seal is single-sided embossing seal whose design is a shallow-relief copy of the obverse side of the Great Seal.

==Usage==

The Great Seal is attached to the official documents of state that require the authorisation of the monarch to implement the advice of His Majesty&#x27;s Government.

Under today&#x27;s usage of the Great Seal, seals of dark green wax are affixed to letters patent elevating individuals to the peerage, blue seals authorise actions relating to the royal family, and scarlet seals appoint bishops and implement various other affairs of state. In some cases the seal is replaced by a wafer version, a smaller representation of the obverse of the Great Seal embossed on coloured paper attached to the document being sealed. This simpler version is used for royal proclamations, letters patent granting royal assent to legislation, writs of summons to Parliament, licences for the election of bishops, commissions of the peace, and many other documents. It formerly constituted treason to forge the Great Seal.

The Great Seal of the Realm is in the custody of and is administered by the Lord Keeper of the Great Seal. This office has been held jointly with that of Lord Chancellor since 1761. The current Lord Chancellor is Shabana Mahmood. The Constitutional Reform Act 2005 reiterates that the Lord Chancellor continues to be the custodian of the Great Seal. Though, in the past, the Great Seal has been delivered to and remained in the custody of the Sovereign when it has been used to seal instruments that related to or granted gifts or emoluments to the Lord Chancellor.

The Clerk of the Crown in Chancery, who is also Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Justice, heads His Majesty&#x27;s Crown Office, and is responsible for the affixing of the Great Seal. They are assisted by the Deputy Clerk of the Crown. Day-to-day custody is entrusted to the Clerk of the Chamber, and subordinate staff include a Sealer and two Scribes to His Majesty&#x27;s Crown Office.
Section 2 of the (47 &amp; 48 Vict. c. 30) governs the use of the Great Seal of the Realm:

==Inscriptions on the Great Seal==
The Great Seal for each successive monarch is inscribed with the monarch&#x27;s style (in Latin) on both sides of the seal. Some of those used in the past are shown below. Where the inscriptions on both sides of the seal are identical, only one is given. Where they are the same except for the use of abbreviations, the one with the fuller forms is given. Where they are different, they are shown separated by a slash.

<doc id="847583" wikidata="Q722680" url="?curid=847583" title="Greatest Hits (1992 Kylie Minogue album)">
<text>Greatest Hits is the first greatest hits album by Australian singer Kylie Minogue. The album was released on 24 August 1992 as Minogue&#x27;s final release under Pete Waterman Limited (PWL). The record contains nineteen singles from the singer&#x27;s first four studio albums, as well as three new songs recorded specifically for inclusion on this album. The album was largely written and produced by the Stock Aitken Waterman team, and its release marked the end of Minogue&#x27;s professional relationship with them. It contained all her single releases to date including the Japan-only single, &quot;Turn It into Love&quot;, featured on Kylie&#x27;s first studio album in 1988.

&quot;Greatest Hits&quot; entered the UK Albums Chart at number one, becoming Minogue&#x27;s third number-one album in the United Kingdom. It charted there for eleven weeks and was later certified platinum for shipments of 300,000 copies. The album was also successful in Australia, debuting and peaking at number three and charting for fifteen weeks. It was later certified platinum for shipments exceeding 70,000 copies, by Australian Recording Industry Association. The album is Minogue&#x27;s third number one album in the United Kingdom, after &quot;Kylie&quot; (1988) and &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot; (1989).
This compilation was superseded by 2004&#x27;s &quot;Ultimate Kylie&quot; collection, with only seven tracks not being included on that 2-CD set and, later, by 2019&#x27;s &quot;Step Back in Time: The Definitive Collection&quot;, with only three tracks not being included on the expanded, 3-CD version of the latter. Following her release from PWL, she stated that she felt stifled by Stock, Aitken and Waterman, saying, &quot;I was very much a puppet in the beginning. I was blinkered by my record company. I was unable to look left or right.&quot;

==Release==
The album was promoted with two singles, &quot;What Kind of Fool (Heard All That Before)&quot; and &quot;Celebration&quot;, originally a hit for Kool &amp; The Gang in 1980. In Australia, the album was released with completely different artwork and was available as a limited edition digi-pack. A limited edition was also available in Australia with the &quot;Kylie&#x27;s Non-Stop History 50+1&quot; remix album as a bonus disc and the original album was later re-issued again with the original UK artwork in 1998. An accompanying video compilation called &quot;Greatest Video Hits&quot; was released alongside the album. The video featured all Minogue&#x27;s music videos to date except the in-house promo video for &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;. The Australian version keeps the original title, &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, and was released with the same cover as the Australian edition of its audio counterpart. The Japanese Laserdisc edition also includes the video for &quot;Celebration&quot;. In the 2009 iTunes re-release, the single versions of the tracks have been put in place of the album versions, including a rare single version of &quot;It&#x27;s No Secret&quot; put in place of the original album version. The album was re-issued again in 2011 with an altered track list for the South African leg of Kylie&#x27;s Aphrodite World Tour.

===Singles===

The first single was &quot;What Kind of Fool (Heard All That Before)&quot;. It was released in the United Kingdom in August 1992 and peaked at number fourteen in the UK Singles Chart. The release was backed with the fan-favourite &quot;Things Can Only Get Better&quot;. The second and final single was &quot;Celebration&quot;, a cover of Kool &amp; the Gang&#x27;s hit. It was released in November 1992 and peaked at number twenty on the UK Singles Chart. It was also Minogue&#x27;s last single for PWL.

==Track listing==
All songs written and produced by Mike Stock, Matt Aitken and Pete Waterman except where noted.

<doc id="847584" wikidata="Q845859" url="?curid=847584" title="Cruz Azul">
<text>Club de Futbol Cruz Azul S.A. de C.V., commonly referred to as Cruz Azul, is a professional football club based in Mexico City, Mexico. It competes in Liga MX, the top tier of Mexican football. Founded in 1927 in Jasso, Hidalgo, the club officially moved to Mexico City in 1971, where it had already registered a great presence and activity since its beginnings. Estadio Azteca, the nation&#x27;s largest sports venue, served as their home venue until 1996, when they moved to Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes, which was renamed Estadio Azul. After 22 years, the team returned to the &quot;Azteca&quot; following the conclusion of the 2017–18 Liga MX season. Its headquarters are in La Noria, a suburb within Xochimilco in the southern part of Mexico City.

Domestically, the club has won nine league titles, four Copa MX, three Campeón de Campeones, and holds a joint-record with one Supercopa de la Liga MX and one Supercopa MX. In international competitions, the club&#x27;s six titles makes it the second-most successful club in the history of the CONCACAF Champions Cup/Champions League, the most prestigious international club competition in North American football. Cruz Azul also holds numerous distinctions, including being the club with the most league runner-up finishes (12), the first CONCACAF team to reach the final of the Copa Libertadores—the most prestigious club competition in South American football—losing on penalties to Boca Juniors in 2001, achieving a rare continental treble in the 1968–69 season by winning the Primera División, Copa México and CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, becoming the first CONCACAF club and third worldwide to accomplish this feat, and becoming the first club worldwide, and one of only five, to have won the continental treble twice.

In its 2014 Club World Ranking, the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics placed Cruz Azul as the 99th-best club in the world and the third-best club in CONCACAF. According to several polls published, Cruz Azul is the third-most popular team in Mexico, behind only C.D. Guadalajara and Club América. It is also the second most supported team in its area, Greater Mexico City, behind América and ahead of Pumas UNAM.

==History==

===Background and foundation===
Carlos Garces López was a footballer and athlete, included in the Mexico national team for the 1924 and 1928 athletics and football. As a midfielder, he was part of Club América&#x27;s founding squad and was a key player to their dominance of the Primera Fuerza in the mid-1920s. Garces López was included in the debut Mexico national football team in 1923, playing in Mexico&#x27;s debut series of official international matches against Guatemala. At the time, football in Mexico was not a lucrative occupation. Garces López was a licensed dentist providing dental care at the cement company Cooperativa La Cruz Azul, S.C.L. located in the small town of Jasso, Hidalgo. He would travel regularly to Mexico City from Jasso to train and play for América.

In 1925, Cooperativa La Cruz Azul had voted to establish a company baseball team as the sport was popular in the town of Jasso. Garces López personally lobbied for many months to change the official company sport to football. American employees initially receiving resistance but the company directors relented to a referendum for determination of the company team&#x27;s main sport. The March 22, 1927 election favored football. Cooperativa La Cruz Azul replaced the company baseball diamond with a football pitch. The football team was officially established two months later on May 22 where Garces López was appointed head coach.

===Amateur era (1927–1961)===

Initially, Cruz Azul played in local tournaments organized by the company against teams representing towns neighboring Jasso. The team was composed solely of company workers for the next three decades. The club was widely successful in amateur tournaments during the 1930s and 1940s, winning 15 consecutive state level league titles.

====Establishment as a co-operative (1931–1934)====

By 1931, Cooperativa La Cruz Azul had experienced a series of economic troubles during the Great Depression. Due to the loss of demand and production of cement and other construction materials, the company faced bankruptcy and was bought by cement company &quot;La Tolteca&quot; on March 1, 1931, for 1 million pesos. The liquidation of Cooperativa La Cruz Azul was anticipated by 192 workers of the company who unionized and sued the executives of the company to prevent the transfer of the property which was set for October 15, 1931. The government of Hidalgo ruled in favor of the workers after it was shown &quot;La Tolteca&quot; had premeditated intentions of liquidation. The workers assumed control of the industrial facilities on November 2. On May 21, 1932, the governor of Hidalgo, Bartolomé Vargas Lugo, decreed the 192 workers of Cooperativa La Cruz Azul as collective owners of the plant, exercising eminent domain. Part of the agreement, all 192 workers who assumed responsibility of the plant agreed to pay the state of Hidalgo 1.3 million pesos over the course of 10 years. The company changed its name to &quot;Cooperativa Manufacturera de Cemento Portland La Cruz Azul, S.C.L&quot;, reestablishing itself as a cooperative on January 29, 1934. The debt was settled on November 2, 1941, 10 years after workers took ownership of the plant. In celebration, Cruz Azul organized a match against R.C. España, that ended in a 0–0 draw.

This scenario of the club&#x27;s formation encourages its working-class facade.

====Success in amateur competitions (1932–1952)====

From 1932 to 1943, Cruz Azul won 15 consecutive league titles in an amateur league in the state of Hidalgo. On 8 different occasions, the club represented the state of Hidalgo in national amateur tournaments. From the mid-1930s to the late 1940s, the club regularly traveled to Mexico City to face the reserve teams of Atlante, Necaxa, Marte, and R.C. España, playing at Parque Necaxa to great success. By 1937, Cruz Azul had garnered a considerable following both in Hidalgo and Mexico City. Around this period in time Guillermo Álvarez Macías began playing on the team as a midfielder.

====Foundations for professional status (1953–1960)====

On December 10, 1953, Guillermo Álvarez Macías was appointed general manager of Cooperativa La Cruz Azul. He had been employed at the cooperative since 1931 at the age of 12 when his father died. Initially employed as an automotive mechanic, Álvarez Macías spent over two decades at the company, rising through the ranks. A self-proclaimed socialist, Álvarez Macías laid plans to transform the cooperative into a functioning town, building schools, restaurants, paving roads, in hopes to modernize and &quot;share social and economic progress, to raise the standard of living of the worker and his family.&quot; In his goal to promote social well-being among members of the co-op, Álvarez Macías invested into cultural and recreational activities. This included investing much more into the football club whose proceeds were used to provide the worker-players with better living conditions.

In 1958, team captain and machinist, Luis Velázquez Hernández, served as the club&#x27;s ambassador to the Mexican Football Federation to lobby for official membership on the club&#x27;s behalf. Velázquez Hernández met Paulino Sánchez in Mexico City, who had ties to prominent football executives. They met with Joaquín Soria Terrazas and Ignacio Trelles to discuss membership in the federation for the club. Sánchez vouched in favor of Cruz Azul, citing their continual success in the amateur and reserve tournaments. Much to the displeasure of Álvarez Macías who asserted the club was not ready for professional football.

In preparation for federation membership, Paulino Sánchez assumed the position as head manager of the club. Due to regulations, teams were required to have a reserve team. &quot;Lafayette&quot;, a club experiencing financial troubles located in Colonia Moctezuma, had many talented players that could potentially be Cruz Azul&#x27;s reserves. Under the recommendation of Sánchez, Cruz Azul purchased the &quot;Lafayette&quot; team. The acquisition was completed sometime in 1960. Plans to construct a club stadium that complied to the standards set by the Mexican Football Federation were conceived in 1960. In 1961, ground broke to construct Estadio 10 de Diciembre and finished in 1963.

Despite not possessing federation membership and due to Sánchez&#x27;s personal contacts, Cruz Azul was invited to compete in the 1960-61 edition of &quot;Copa de la Segunda División de México&quot;, a competition sanctioned by the Mexican Football Federation. The club&#x27;s debut game was played on April 2, 1961, in Jasso against Zamora, ending in 2–1 in favor of Cruz Azul. The second leg was played on April 9, 1961, ending in a 3–3 draw. They faced Querétaro in the next round winning 1–0 on aggregate. Cruz Azul was eliminated by UNAM. Following their impressive performance in the cup, the Mexican Football Federation granted Cruz Azul an opportunity to register as a professional team.

===Professional level and rapid rise to prominence (1961–1968)===

The club was officially registered to compete in the nation&#x27;s second tier professional league for the 1961–62 season.

Due to the regulations by the Mexican Football Federation that prohibited the official usage of company names by clubs, the club changed its name to &quot;Cooperativa Cruz Azul&quot; from &quot;Cemento Cruz Azul&quot; 

====Promotion to Primera División (1964)====

Jorge Marik, a Hungarian coach who previously managed Atlas and Atlante, signed on to manage the club in 1961. Cruz Azul won a direct promotion to Primera División after Marik led the club to the 1st position on the general table with 45 points (19 wins, 7 draws, and 4 losses) in the 1963–64 Mexican Segunda División season.

Following the club&#x27;s promotion, Estadio 10 de Diciembre underwent renovations on March 6, 1964, rebuilding the wooden stands and dressing rooms which were compliant to regulations.

Cruz Azul finished their first season in the top flight, the 1964–65 Mexican Primera División season, in 8th place with 10 wins, 9 draws, 11 losses.

After poor results, Marik left the club after the 1965–66 Mexican Primera División season where Cruz Azul finished in 13th place out of 16 teams on the league table. Walter Ormeño became the team&#x27;s interim coach, managing 3 games, before the club signed Raúl Cárdenas October 20, 1966.

===Establishment in the top flight (1969–1980)===

====Domination of Primera División (1969–1975)====

=====1968–69 season: first championship, treble=====

During the 1968–69 season under the direction of Cárdenas, Cruz Azul won their first Copa México, their first Primera División title, and their first CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. After only 4 years in the nation&#x27;s top flight, Cruz Azul managed to complete a treble, being the first club to do so in not only Mexico but in the CONCACAF region as well.

=====1970–1980=====

Cruz Azul finished in second place on the general table for the 1969–70 Mexican Primera División season.
The club was awarded the 1970 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup on December 15, 1970, after Saprissa and Transvaal withdrew from the second phase of the competition in September citing economic issues.

Between 1970 and 1980, Cruz Azul led the Primera División with six league tournament championships; four under Cárdenas and the last two under Ignacio Trelles. This powerful version of the team earned the nickname &quot;La Máquina Celeste&quot; (The Blue Machine), which continues as one of the official nicknames of the team.

On December 18, 1976, Guillermo Álvarez Macías died of a heart attack at the age of 56 while awaiting President Portillo for a meeting.

===First drought (1981–1997)===
Throughout the 1980s, Cruz Azul remained one of the most competitive teams in the league. Despite their consistent form and financial wealth, the club was unable to obtain a title. This drought would last for another 17 years.

====Billy Álvarez presidency====

In 1988, Guillermo Héctor Álvarez Cuevas, the son of the late Guillermo Álvarez Macías, assumed the position of general manager at the cooperative Cooperativa La Cruz Azul and presidency of Cruz Azul.

====1990–1995====
For the 1991–92 season, Cruz Azul signed Carlos Hermosillo. An América icon who was fundamental to America&#x27;s 1988–89 league championship victory against Cruz Azul, Hermosillo&#x27;s signing was met with ambivalence by the club&#x27;s supporters. Hermosillo, however, quickly established himself as an integral part of the team where he was the league&#x27;s top goal scorer for 3 consecutive years (1993–94, 1994–95, 1995–96 – 27, 35, 26 goals respectively).

In the 1994–95 season, the club finished 3rd in the league&#x27;s overall table and reached a league final for the first time in 6 years where they were defeated 3–1 on aggregate by Necaxa.

====1996–1997: end of drought and second treble====
July 20 of 1996 marked the end of a 16 year long championship drought for Cruz Azul. The team managed by Víctor Manuel Vucetich won the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup single round-robin tournament held in Guatemala City. Cruz Azul finished 1st on the table after defeating Seattle Sounders 11–0 at Estadio Flores. Vucetich also lead Cruz Azul to a Copa México title, winning the 1996–97 Copa México at the Estadio 10 de Diciembre after defeating Toros Neza 2–0.
Under the management of Luis Fernando Tena, Cruz Azul won the CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup on August 24, 1997, for the second consecutive year after defeating LA Galaxy 5–3 in the final. 
On December 7, 1997, Cruz Azul, who finished 2nd in the general standings of the league table, won the Invierno 1997 league tournament the against table leaders León via golden goal. This marked an end to the club&#x27;s 17 year long league drought as well as achieving Cruz Azul&#x27;s second continental treble.

The second leg of the series is largely remembered in part of a self-admittedly inexplicable act of aggression committed by León&#x27;s goalkeeper Ángel Comizzo towards Carlos Hermosillo that handed the championship title to Cruz Azul. During the 15th minute of the first half of extra time, Comizzo shoved and kicked Cruz Azul striker Hermosillo in the face while inside the penalty box. Referee Arturo Brizio only witnessed the shove but did not see the kick as he turned his head away when Comizzo kicked Hermosillo. The penalty was called in favor of Cruz Azul while Comizzo did not get sent off. Hermosillo, whose face was bleeding profusely, took the penalty kick and scored. As the golden goal rule applied, Cruz Azul won the match and their eighth league title.

===Second trophy drought (1998–2013)===
====Copa Libertadores 2001====

In 2001, Cruz Azul was invited to a tournament between select Mexican and Venezuelan teams that would then compete in the Copa Libertadores, a tournament of the best South American teams. The two best teams of this qualifying tournament earned immediate placement on the roster.

Cruz Azul was one of the seeded teams and reached the 2001 Copa Libertadores final match. Cruz Azul started the tournament in Group 7 along with Sao Caetano, Defensor Sporting, and Olmedo. Cruz Azul finished as leader of the group with 13 points. In the round of 16 Cruz Azul faced Cerro Porteño. The first leg was played in Asunción, where Cruz Azul lost 2–1. The second leg was played in Mexico City, where Cruz Azul won the game 3–1. The aggregate score was 4–3 in favor of Cruz Azul and they moved on to the quarterfinals.

In the quarterfinals, Cruz Azul faced River Plate of Argentina. The first leg of the match was played in Buenos Aires and ended in a 0–0 draw. The second leg was played in Mexico City and Cruz Azul won 3–0. Cruz Azul was having a great run and faced Rosario Central at the semifinals. The first leg was played in Mexico City and Cruz Azul won the game 2–0. The second leg was played in Rosario, a very exciting match that ended in a 3–3 draw in favor of Cruz Azul due to the 2–0 victory in the first leg.

In the final match, Cruz Azul played against the Argentine giants Boca Juniors. Cruz Azul lost at home the first leg 1–0, but came back to win the second leg with the same score at Boca&#x27;s La Bombonera stadium with Paco Palencia scoring the goal. Until then, no team had ever won a Copa Libertadores final match there. After overtime, the championship was decided by penalty kicks where Boca Juniors prevailed. Still, Cruz Azul surprised everybody with the unprecedented feat of reaching the final and defeating established Argentinian teams such as Rosario Central and River Plate.

====2005 abduction of Rubén Omar Romano====

After leaving a pre-season practice session on July 16, 2005, manager Rubén Omar Romano was cornered by two stolen vehicles and abducted by 5 men. A ransom note was later found demanding of Romano&#x27;s family $500,000. Assistant coach Isaac Mizrahi managed the team during Romano&#x27;s absence. After 65 days, Romano was found and rescued unharmed. Federal agents raided a house in a poor neighborhood where Romano and his kidnappers were situated. The agents arrested 7 conspirators who were under the orders of convicted abductor Jose Luis Canchola.

During the hostage incident, the club had decided to not renew Romano&#x27;s contract upon the end of Apertura 2005 and instead offered the position to Mizrahi following stellar results. Mizrahi accepted the offer while Romano was in captivity. Romano stated he felt betrayed and his friendship with Mizrahi was severed.

====Series of runner-ups and last-minute losses (2008–2013)====
The club was regularly regarded to be contenders for championship titles due to their formidable and financial stature in the league. Throughout this period in time however, Cruz Azul competed in many league and tournament finals only to finish runners-up. In these championship matches, as well as regular season games, Cruz Azul initially would be favorites to win, often having the advantage over the opponent, but would ultimately draw or lose near the end of full stoppage time. As a result, the club garnered a negative reputation of being cursed and the club would often be subject to ridicule. The term cruzazulear, defined as &quot;the act of losing a game after victory is practically assured&quot;, is used to describe Cruz Azul losing a match in the aforementioned manner beginning sometime in 2013. The usage of the term was so prevalent that it is officially recognized by the Royal Spanish Academy in 2020.

=====Clausura 2008=====
During the Clausura 2008 season, the team played a great tournament, finishing in second place. The team won 9 games, had 4 draws and lost only 4 times. In the quarterfinals they played against the Jaguares losing 1–0 in the first leg and winning 2–1 in the second leg with goals of Pablo Zeballos and Miguel Sabah. They moved to the semifinals against the San Luis, the first leg was played in San Luis and Cruz Azul won 0–1 with a goal of Miguel Sabah. In the second leg, Cruz Azul and the San Luis played a formidable match that ended 1–1 with goals of Eduardo Coudet and Pablo Zeballos. In the final, Cruz Azul played against Santos Laguna, second place in the tournament. In the first leg, Cruz Azul lost 1–2 at home, and a 1–1 draw in the second leg meant that Santos were champions with a 3–2 aggregate score.

=====Apertura 2008=====
For the Apertura 2008 season, Cruz Azul finished in 5th place on the overall table. The team had 7 wins, 5 draws, and 5 losses.

In the quarterfinals, Cruz Azul defeated Pumas UNAM with an aggregate score of 3–1, moving on to the semifinals against Atlante; the first leg was played in Mexico City, and Cruz Azul won 3–1. In the second leg, Cruz Azul tied Atlante 1–1 in Cancún, which meant that Cruz Azul reached the Final for the second consecutive time. In the final, Cruz Azul played against Toluca, both teams tied on winning Mexican titles (at that time with 8 each). The first leg played in Mexico City ended with a dramatic 0–2 with a victory for Toluca, and in the second leg, which was played at Estadio Nemesio Díez, Cruz Azul won 0–2, which put the aggregate score at 2–2, which meant extra time had to be played. No goals were scored in extra time and the match went into a penalty shootout, where Toluca won 7–6 over Cruz Azul and won the title, after Alejandro Vela missed his penalty, even though he was the one that scored the opening goal of the game for Cruz Azul. In the 72nd minute, César Villaluz was fouled in the penalty box and suffered a serious injury, but Cruz Azul were unable to substitute him as they had no remaining substitutes, so the team was forced to defend the scoreline with 10 men for almost fifty minutes, which possibly could´ve had a big outcome on the result, as well as the decision to not award a penalty.

===== 2008–09 CONCACAF Champions League =====
The team qualified for the 2008–09 CONCACAF Champions League by finishing league runner-ups. In the first stage, they finished second in Group A, qualifying for the knockout stage. In the quarter-finals, they defeated Pumas UNAM 2–0 on aggregate; in the semi-finals, they defeated the Puerto Rico Islanders on penalties with 10 men, after coming back from a 2–0 loss in the first leg. In the final against Atlante, they lost the first game 0–2 and tied the second 0–0, losing on aggregate.

====Clausura 2009====
In the Clausura 2009, the team had the worst tournament in club history en route to a last-place finish. They accumulated just 13 points in 17 games, winning only two games, with seven draws and eight losses. The Club sacked their manager Benjamín Galindo with one game left in the Clausura. He was replaced for the remainder of the season by Robert Siboldi who was then coaching Cruz Azul&#x27;s affiliate in Hidalgo.

=====Apertura 2009=====
In the Apertura 2009, the team had signed Enrique Meza to manage the team and signed several players, including the best goalkeeper of the previous Mexican tournament José de Jesús Corona, Argentine striker Emanuel Villa, Ramón Núñez, and Emilio Hernández. The team finished the regular season in second place with 33 points, winning 11 games of 17 played, and qualifying for the playoffs; Villa was the top scorer of the tournament with 17 goals. In the quarter-finals, they beat Puebla 7–6 on aggregate, and in the semi-finals, they beat Monarcas Morelia 2–1 on aggregate. In the final, they lost to Monterrey 6–4 on aggregate, meaning this was now their third consecutive time failing to win a league finals.

In April 2012, Cruz Azul changed their official name from Club Deportivo, Social y Cultural Cruz Azul, A.C. to simply Cruz Azul Fútbol Club, A.C.

=====2009–10 CONCACAF Champions League=====
In the 2009–10 CONCACAF Champions League, the team had a good tournament, finishing first in Group C and qualifying for the final stage of playoffs. In the quarter-finals, they defeated Panamanian team Árabe Unido 4–0 on aggregate, and then in the semifinal round, they played against the Mexico City rivals Pumas UNAM, losing the first leg 1–0 but winning the return leg 5–1 at Estadio Azul. In the final, against another Mexican club, Pachuca, they had the chance to win their 6th CONCACAF championship, winning the first game at home 2–1, but lost at Pachuca&#x27;s home 1–0 with a last minute goal, meaning Pachuca won the championship by the away goals rule, and Cruz Azul missed the opportunity to participate in the 2010 FIFA Club World Cup.

=====Liga MX Clausura/Copa MX Clausura 2013=====
During the 2013 season, Cruz Azul started slow but regained confidence after beating Club América in the Copa MX semi-finals and winning the Copa MX final over the Atlante. After Cruz Azul won the Copa MX, their Liga MX performance improved and they were considered one of the contenders for the title due to a good streak. They would face bitter rivals the Club America in a historical final series of the &quot;Clásico Joven.&quot; Cruz Azul was up 2–0 in aggregate when the Club America made a miraculous comeback with goals in the 89th from Aquilvado Mosquera and 93rd minute from Moises Munoz who was a goalkeeper of the second leg; Club America would go on to win 4–2 on penalties.

=== End of Second drought and CONCACAF Champions League win (2014–2019) ===
On April 23, 2014, after defeating Toluca, Cruz Azul won their 6th CONCACAF championship, a record at the time, and winning their first trophy in seventeen years. This gave Cruz Azul a berth at the 2014 FIFA Club World Cup, where they would earn a fourth-place finish.

From the Clausura 2014 to the Clausura 2017, Cruz Azul had been unable to qualify to the liguilla playoffs for six consecutive tournaments. Cruz Azul qualified for the liguilla for the first time in three years in the Apertura 2017 season. However, they were eliminated in the quarterfinals by the América, who advanced as the higher-ranked seed, with an aggregate score of 0–0. On 27 November 2017, Cruz Azul announced that Paco Jémez would not renew his contract for the following season.

In the Liga MX Clausura 2018 tournament, Cruz Azul ended up ranked 12th and failed to qualify for the liguilla. The club also finished last place in the group stage of the Clausura 2018 Copa MX.
On 7 May 2018, the club announced director of football Eduardo de la Torre&#x27;s contract had ended and would be replaced by Ricardo Peláez, former director of football for Club América.

On 31 October, they would face Monterrey in the Apertura 2018 Copa MX Final, winning 2–0 with goals from Elías Hernández and Martín Cauteruccio. It was their first trophy in the tournament since 2013.

Cruz Azul faced América in a rematch of the Clausura 2013 final for the Apertura 2018 final. The first leg was played on 13 December 2018 which ended in a scoreless draw. The second leg was played three days later and ended in a 2–0 victory for América. With this defeat, Cruz Azul extended its 21-year-old championship drought in the league for at least another season.

===Administrative vicissitude (2020)===

====Indictment and ousting of board of directors====

In May 2020, Guillermo Alvarez Cuevas, then president of the club, was indicted by Mexican authorities on multiple accounts of insurance fraud, racketeering, extortion, tax evasion, and money laundering. On July 26, an arrest warrant was issued for Alvarez along with board directors Victor Manuel Garcés, Miguel Eduardo Borrell, and Mario Sánchez Álvarez for alleged ties to organized crime. Alvarez subsequently resigned from his position at the club in August 2020 after 32 years as acting president. Interpol is currently searching for Alvarez in 195 countries and as of June 2, 2021, remains at large.

====2020 season====
On December 6, 2020, Cruz Azul faced UNAM on the second semi-final leg of the Guardianes 2020 Liga MX final phase. Although Cruz Azul had a 4–0 lead at the beginning of the second leg, they lost the match 0–4, thus tying in aggregate. Because UNAM won the clubs&#x27; week 17 match 1–0, they held the tiebreaker and advanced to the final.

=== End of Drought (2021) ===
Following a disappointing end to 2020, Cruz Azul underwent significant changes ahead of the Guardianes 2021 tournament. The club appointed Juan Reynoso as the new head coach. Reynoso, a former player, had been part of the Cruz Azul squad that won their previous league title in the Invierno 1997 tournament. Álvaro Dávila also joined as the club&#x27;s executive president, with Reynoso as his managerial choice.

The season started poorly for Cruz Azul, with consecutive defeats against Santos Laguna and Puebla, losing both games 1–0. However, the team turned things around in the third matchday, securing a 1–0 away victory against Pachuca. This marked the beginning of an unprecedented 12-match winning streak, tying the Liga MX record set by León in the Clausura 2019. The streak ended with a 1–1 draw against América in Matchday 15.

Despite this, Cruz Azul remained unbeaten for the rest of the regular season, finishing as league leaders with 41 points from 17 matches, an 80% effectiveness rate that also tied León&#x27;s record from 2019. This dominance set the stage for their playoff campaign.

In the quarterfinals, Cruz Azul faced Toluca. After losing the first leg 2–1 at the Estadio Nemesio Díez, the team rallied with a 3–1 victory in the second leg at the Estadio Azteca, advancing with a 4–3 aggregate. In the semifinals, they encountered Pachuca. After a goalless first leg, a decisive goal by Santiago Giménez in the second leg secured Cruz Azul&#x27;s place in the final.

The final of the Guardianes 2021 pitted Cruz Azul against Santos Laguna. The first leg, held at the Estadio Corona in Torreón, saw a tightly contested match. Despite Santos Laguna&#x27;s control over portions of the game, Cruz Azul showcased a solid defensive performance, keeping a clean sheet. Luis Romo&#x27;s exceptional solo effort resulted in the only goal of the match, giving Cruz Azul a 1–0 lead going into the second leg.

On 30 May 2021, Cruz Azul ended its 23-year Primera División championship drought by beating Santos Laguna 2–1 on aggregate at Estadio Azteca, earning its ninth league title, after having lost seven finals in the last thirteen years.

=== The Martín Anselmi Era (2024-2025) ===
On 20 December 2023, Martín Anselmi was appointed as the head coach of Cruz Azul following the departure of former manager Joaquín Moreno, whose disappointing Apertura 2023 campaign saw the club finish in 16th place. Before the start of the Clausura 2024, Anselmi oversaw the signings of key players, including Kevin Mier, Gabriel Fernández, Lorenzo Faravelli and Gonzalo Piovi, raising expectations for the team&#x27;s performance. Anselmi&#x27;s first match with the club ended in a 1–0 defeat against Pachuca. Despite this initial setback, he guided the team to a remarkable turnaround, securing a 2nd-place finish in the regular season with 33 points and earning a spot in the Liguilla. During this period, Anselmi posted a video to his personal Instagram that contained Julieta Venegas’s song “Andar Conmigo”, which many supporters viewed as a sign of good luck. 

In the playoffs, Cruz Azul ended up defeating Pumas UNAM and Monterrey, making it all the way to the Clausura final where they would face América for the 6th time in a Liga MX final, making it the most played final in the league’s history. Leading up to the final, Cruz Azul received support from many notable figures such as Colombian goalkeeping legend, René Higuita, Mexican comedian and actor, Eugenio Derbez, and Mexican rapper Alemán. Cruz Azul ended up losing the final with a score of 2–1 on aggregate after a controversial penalty was awarded to América after Carlos Rotondi tackled Israel Reyes in the penalty area.

====Apertura 2024====
Leading up to the Apertura 2024, Cruz Azul had very high expectations due to them finishing second in the final and table during the previous tournament. Cruz Azul started the season off with a 1–0 win against Mazatlán and maintained an impressive unbeaten streak of six wins and one draw leading up to matchday 8. However, their momentum was halted when they faced Atlético San Luis, suffering a 3–1 defeat that ended their unbeaten streak. Heading into the final matchday of the regular season, Cruz Azul was on the verge of breaking the league record for the most points achieved in a short tournament of 17 matchday games, with 41 points. To set the new record, they simply needed to avoid a loss. On the decisive day, they were facing Tigres UANL, when during the 83rd minute, former Cruz Azul player Uriel Antuna was pulled down in the penalty area by Gonzalo Piovi. The referee awarded a penalty where Nicolás Ibáñez scored putting the game 1–0. During the 98th minute, Cruz Azul captain Ignacio Rivero sent a cross into the penalty area where Ángel Sepúlveda scored from a header, securing Cruz Azul the draw in the dying minutes, and breaking the league record with 42 points.

With a spot in the playoffs secure, Cruz Azul were seen as the clear favorites to win the tournament. They were tasked with facing Club Tijuana in the quarterfinals. The first leg was played in Tijuana and Xolos shockingly defeated Cruz Azul 3-0. Many thought it was over for Cruz Azul, but Cruz Azul were able to turn the game around in the second leg and ended up deafening Tijuana 3-0, securing a spot in the semifinals. Cruz Azul faced América in the semifinals and with a 0-0 draw in the first leg, that game had to be settled in the second leg. Alejandro Zendejas opened the score and right after halftime, goalkeeper Kevin Mier made a fatal mistake causing Richard Sánchez to make the score 2-0. Going into the last 10 minutes of the game, Cruz Azul were trailing 3-1, until captain Ignacio Rivero scored making it 2-3 and just 6 minutes later, 19 year old Amaury Morales scored from a volley leveling the game at 3-3. It seemed as if Cruz Azul were in the final once again, but during the 94th minute, América was awarded a penalty, which Rodrigo Aguirre scored and put the game at 3-4 in América’s favor, sending them to the final for the 3rd season in a row.

=== Clausura 2025 ===

Before the start of the Clausura 2025, it was announced that Cruz Azul would be playing their home games at the Estadio Olímpico Universitario. Cruz Azul started the season off with a 1-1 draw to Atlas. On 25 January, Cruz Azul head coach Martín Anselmi flew to Portugal to become the new head coach of FC Porto without notifying club officials which caused outrage in the club. Cruz Azul threatened to take legal action due to Anselmi breaching his contract.

==Crest and colors==
===Crests===

Cruz Azul&#x27;s crest has evolved over the decades, consistently reflecting the club&#x27;s core identity since its founding in 1927. The blue cross, positioned within a white circle and framed by a red square, has long symbolized the club&#x27;s heritage and connection to Cooperativa La Cruz Azul, S.C.L., representing the values of unity, resilience, and teamwork. The cross itself is inspired by British influences, as Cruz Azul was originally connected to British culture.

In its early years, the club&#x27;s emblem was a simple, shield-shaped design centered around the blue cross, a powerful symbol linked to the cooperative roots of the organization. As Cruz Azul grew in prominence, the club refined its emblem in 1964, adopting a rounder design that included the full name, Club Deportivo Cruz Azul. This design marked a shift in the club&#x27;s identity as it became more established in Mexican football, presenting a more formal, professional image while keeping the cross as its focal point.

The crest underwent another change in the early 1970s following Cruz Azul&#x27;s first league title. Stars were added above the cross to represent these achievements, and by 1973, the crest displayed three stars, celebrating the team&#x27;s growing success in the Primera División. This marked the beginning of a tradition where stars were added to commemorate each league title, creating a visual record of Cruz Azul&#x27;s accomplishments within the emblem. In the years that followed, the club&#x27;s crest was further refined, with cleaner lines and a modernized look that highlighted the name “Deportivo Cruz Azul” alongside the cross. By 1980, the stars were standardized, and the design streamlined to enhance brand consistency, allowing it to adapt more easily across various media and merchandise. This period solidified the crest&#x27;s status as one of Mexican football&#x27;s most recognizable symbols.

As Cruz Azul&#x27;s prominence grew within Mexican football, the club introduced a significant redesign of its crest in 1997. The emblem was updated to a circular shape, giving it a modern and unified appearance that stood out among traditional club designs. This circular design was complemented by the addition of the word “Mexico” around the outer ring, a declaration of the club&#x27;s pride in representing the nation at both domestic and international levels. The new shape and wording reinforced Cruz Azul&#x27;s identity as a symbol of Mexican football, making the crest instantly recognizable and resonant with fans across the country. This design remained largely unchanged for over two decades, becoming a lasting emblem of the club&#x27;s heritage.

In 2021, Cruz Azul modified its crest to celebrate a significant milestone as the club achieved its ninth Liga MX title, ending a 23-year drought since their previous league title in 1997. This redesign added a ninth star around the emblem, symbolizing the triumph and resilience of the club after years of pursuit. The iconic blue cross remained unchanged at the center, preserving the emblem’s traditional identity while marking this significant moment in Cruz Azul&#x27;s history. The following year, “Club de Futbol” replaced “Deportivo” around the outer ring, signaling a subtle shift in branding as the club continued to evolve while honoring its heritage. Additionally, the stars encircling the emblem were removed, streamlining the design to focus on the iconic blue cross and the club’s name. This current iteration embodies a forward-looking spirit while remaining grounded in the cooperative principles that have defined Cruz Azul from the beginning.

===Colors===
The colors of Cruz Azul—red, white, and blue—pay homage to the British origins of the company and reflect the club&#x27;s identity. The blue cross signifies strength and solidarity, while the red and white enhance the visual representation of the club&#x27;s heritage. This color palette, deeply rooted in the cooperative&#x27;s history, represents the values of the organization and its commitment to unity within the community. Additionally, the blue, white, and red colors resonate with the symbolism of the &quot;Santa Cruz&quot; (Holy Cross), further solidifying the connection to the cooperative&#x27;s mission and identity.

==Nicknames==

Cruz Azul has a rich variety of nicknames over its history, listed chronologically:

* &quot;Cementeros&quot; (cement workers): As a result of affiliation with the Cruz Azul Cement, the first name refers directly to the employees of the company, as the team originally was formed with them. Over the years, the concept is extended not only to those who worked in the cooperative, but the construction workers in general.
* &quot;Liebres&quot; (hares): When the team was promoted to the Primera División in the mid-1960s, the club played a fast and physical game. These characteristics, coupled with their mostly white uniforms, led fans to compare the players of those years with the hares which abound in the town. The nickname took hold, and an anthropomorphic hare is often used as a mascot and icon to represent the Cruz Azul. While some modern fans believe that the mascot is a rabbit, the club&#x27;s board has officially declared that it is a hare.

* &quot;La Máquina&quot; (the machine, the locomotive): This nickname is fed by several sources of inspiration. One is based on a railway that brought the cement from the Cruz Azul plant, in the former village of Jasso (south of Tula de Allende), to Mexico City. After moving to Mexico City, the Cruz Azul was the most dominant club in Mexico during the 1970s, reinforcing the nickname as a comparison to the image of a locomotive sweeping through their opponents. The name may have been borrowed from the similarly nicknamed River Plate club that motored through its opponents in the Argentine Primera División in the 1940s. It has been suggested that reporter Rugama Angel Fernandez was the first to publish an article with the name La Máquina for the Cruz Azul. The nickname has some variations, including The Sky-blue Machine (&quot;La Máquina Celeste&quot;), The Blue Machine (&quot;La Máquina Azul&quot;) and The Cement Machine (&quot;La Máquina Cementera&quot;).

==Stadium==

Cruz Azul originally played at Estadio 10 de Diciembre in Jasso, Hidalgo, from 1964 to 1971. This 17,000-seat stadium saw the club’s first league titles in the 1968–69 and 1970 seasons. Although they left the stadium in 1971, it remained an alternate venue for Copa México, CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup, and some league matches.

In 1971, Cruz Azul moved to the Estadio Azteca in Mexico City, where they experienced some of their most significant achievements, including five league titles and multiple domestic and international cup victories. They briefly left in 1996 for the Estadio Azul, where they played until 2018. The team returned to the &quot;Azteca&quot; in 2018, where they won their ninth league title in 2021.

The Estadio Azul, located in Mexico City&#x27;s Colonia Nápoles, served as Cruz Azul&#x27;s home from 1996 to 2018. Despite never winning a league title there, it was an iconic venue for the club. After a contract renewal issue, the team returned to the &quot;Azteca&quot; but announced a temporary return to the Estadio Azul, now known as the Estadio Ciudad de los Deportes, in 2024 due to renovations at the &quot;Azteca&quot; for the upcoming 2026 FIFA World Cup. 

Cruz Azul&#x27;s second stint at Ciudad de los Deportes lasted one year, as from 2025 the team moved to the Estadio Olímpico Universitario due to logistical issues at the Colonia Nápoles stadium.

The team&#x27;s training facilities, Instalaciones La Noria, are located in Xochimilco. The team has indicated that it intends to build a new stadium, but solid plans such as location have not materialized.

== Support ==

The most recent survey from 2021 placed the club as the 3rd largest fan base in Mexico, behind C.D. Guadalajara and Club América respectively and above UNAM, with 10,9% or 14 million supporters. Historically, since its inception the team was supported mainly by cement workers. After promotion to the Primera División in the 1960s, more people began to follow the team. In the 1970s when the team managed six of their nine titles even more people joined the group of supporters of the team.

The club became infamous in Mexico for not having won a Mexican league title from 1997 to 2021. For an English-speaking audience, the so-called &quot;Cruz Azul curse&quot; is likened to Neverkusen for German team Bayer Leverkusen, the Curse of the Bambino for MLB baseball&#x27;s Boston Red Sox, or the Curse of the Billy Goat for MLB&#x27;s Chicago Cubs. The commonality derives from these teams&#x27; inability, no matter the quality of the team relative to their opponents in a tournament or a championship match, to win a championship. The &quot;curse&quot; was broken after their winning of the Guardianes 2021 final match versus Santos Laguna, after scoring 2–1 on May 30, 2021. Their title drought also included six losses in finals, among other painful playoff defeats, and spurred the creation of the verb &quot;cruzazulear&quot; which is now used in Mexico to describe choking, or to lose a game when victory was almost assured.

The club had its own official cheerleading club, known as &quot;Las Celestes&quot;, who were included as part of the institution in 2004. For years, they performed pre-match and during the halftime, becoming a valued tradition of the club and among fans. Cruz Azul was the only Mexican team to officially include cheerleaders as part of its club activities. However, as of today, &quot;Las Celestes&quot; are no longer active.
Cruz Azul has a passionate fan base, with &quot;La Sangre Azul&quot; as its only official supporters&#x27; group (&quot;barra brava&quot; in Spanish), recognized by the club. Established in January 2001, it is known for its unwavering support, creating a vibrant atmosphere at both home and away games. Through their chants, banners, and coordinated displays, they play a vital role in uniting fans and enhancing the matchday experience. However, in March 2015, the group lost the support of the club&#x27;s board due to violent incidents. In recent seasons, though, the relationship with the club&#x27;s new board has shown signs of improvement, aiming to restore a positive and collaborative connection. &quot;La Sangre Azul&quot; stands as a key element of Cruz Azul’s fan culture, embodying the loyalty and pride of the club’s supporters.

== Rivalries ==

Cruz Azul&#x27;s biggest rival is Club América, with their encounters are famously known as the &quot;Clásico Joven&quot; (). This rivalry is also deeply rooted in social class distinctions: Club América is often viewed as representing the wealthy and powerful, while Cruz Azul is said to represent the working class, hence fans of Cruz Azul and the team itself being dubiously referred to by the nickname of &quot;Los Albañiles&quot; (), a reference to Cruz Azul&#x27;s eponymous parent company, which is one of Mexico&#x27;s major companies specializing in concrete and construction.
