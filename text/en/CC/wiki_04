<text>In Major League history, the term knuckle curve or knuckle curveball has been used to describe three entirely different pitches. All are unrelated to the similar sounding knuckleball.

The first, more modern and commonly used pitch called the knuckle curve is really a standard curveball, thrown with one or more of the index or middle fingers bent. According to practitioners, this gives them a better grip on the ball and allows for tighter spin and greater movement. In all other respects, this knuckle curve is identical to the standard curveball. This version of the knuckle curve was used by Major League pitchers Phil Hughes and Brad Peacock in the 2010s. Mike Mussina was well known for his incorporation of the pitch into his repertoire. Justin Verlander formerly threw a knuckle curve but was forced to abandon the pitch due to problems with blisters. This knuckle curve is usually called the spike curve by MLB players and coaches because the pitch is nothing like a knuckleball.

The second type of knuckle curve is a breaking ball that is thrown with a grip similar to the knuckleball. Unlike a knuckleball, which spins very little, a knuckle curve spins like a normal curveball because the pitcher&#x27;s index and middle fingers push the top of the ball into a downward curve at the moment of release. Since only two fingers produce the spin, however, a knuckle curve does not spin as fast as a curveball, meaning the break is less sharp and less predictable. Because this knuckle curve can be thrown with the same general motion as a fastball, it is more deceptive than a normal curveball. This kind of knuckle curve is rare. It is easier to control than a standard knuckleball, but still difficult to master. The most famous practitioners of this type of knuckle curve are Burt Hooton, who pitched for the Chicago Cubs and the Los Angeles Dodgers from the mid-1970s to mid-1980s, and former reliever Jason Isringhausen.

The third type of knuckle curve was thrown by Dave Stenhouse in the 1960s. Stenhouse&#x27;s knuckle curve was thrown like a fastball but with a knuckleball grip. Stenhouse discovered that this pitch had excellent movement, and when he came to the majors, he utilized it as a breaking pitch. This pitch may have been the same as the knuckleball thrown by Jesse Haines and Freddie Fitzsimmons. The pitch would be perfected by Chicago White Sox legend Hoyt Wilhelm during the later stages of his career, after flirting with it for most of his time in the majors.

<doc id="845722" wikidata="Q1884383" url="?curid=845722" title="Tunnel magnetoresistance">
<text>Tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR) is a magnetoresistive effect that occurs in a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), which is a component consisting of two ferromagnets separated by a thin insulator. If the insulating layer is thin enough (typically a few nanometres), electrons can tunnel from one ferromagnet into the other. Since this process is forbidden in classical physics, the tunnel magnetoresistance is a strictly quantum mechanical phenomenon, and lies in the study of spintronics.

Magnetic tunnel junctions are manufactured in thin film technology. On an industrial scale the film deposition is done by magnetron sputter deposition; on a laboratory scale molecular beam epitaxy, pulsed laser deposition and electron beam physical vapor deposition are also utilized. The junctions are prepared by photolithography.

== Phenomenological description ==

The direction of the two magnetizations of the ferromagnetic films can be switched individually by an external magnetic field. If the magnetizations are in a parallel orientation it is more likely that electrons will tunnel through the insulating film than if they are in the oppositional (antiparallel) orientation. Consequently, such a junction can be switched between two states of electrical resistance, one with low and one with very high resistance.

== History ==

The effect was originally discovered in 1975 by Michel Jullière (University of Rennes, France) in Fe/Ge-O/Co-junctions at 4.2 K. The relative change of resistance was around 14%, and did not attract much attention. In 1991 Terunobu Miyazaki (Tohoku University, Japan) found a change of 2.7% at room temperature. Later, in 1994, Miyazaki found 18% in junctions of iron separated by an amorphous aluminum oxide insulator and Jagadeesh Moodera found 11.8% in junctions with electrodes of CoFe and Co. The highest effects observed at this time with aluminum oxide insulators was around 70% at room temperature.

Since the year 2000, tunnel barriers of crystalline magnesium oxide (MgO) have been under development. In 2001 Butler and Mathon independently made the theoretical prediction that using iron as the ferromagnet and MgO as the insulator, the tunnel magnetoresistance can reach several thousand percent. The same year, Bowen et al. were the first to report experiments showing a significant TMR in a MgO based magnetic tunnel junction [Fe/MgO/FeCo(001)]. 
In 2004, Parkin and Yuasa were able to make Fe/MgO/Fe junctions that reach over 200% TMR at room temperature. In 2008, effects of up to 604% at room temperature and more than 1100% at 4.2 K were observed in junctions of CoFeB/MgO/CoFeB by S. Ikeda, H. Ohno group of Tohoku University in Japan.

== Applications ==

The read-heads of modern hard disk drives work on the basis of magnetic tunnel junctions. TMR, or more specifically the magnetic tunnel junction, is also the basis of MRAM, a new type of non-volatile memory. The 1st generation technologies relied on creating cross-point magnetic fields on each bit to write the data on it, although this approach has a scaling limit at around 90–130 nm. There are two 2nd generation techniques currently being developed: Thermal Assisted Switching (TAS) and Spin-transfer torque.

Magnetic tunnel junctions are also used for sensing applications. Today they are commonly used for position sensors and current sensors in various automotive, industrial and consumer applications. These higher performance sensors are replacing Hall sensors in many applications due to their improved performance.

== Physical explanation ==

The relative resistance change—or effect amplitude—is defined as

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the electrical resistance in the anti-parallel state, whereas formula_3 is the resistance in the parallel state.

The TMR effect was explained by Jullière with the spin polarizations of the ferromagnetic electrodes. The spin polarization &quot;P&quot; is calculated from the spin dependent density of states (DOS) formula_4 at the Fermi energy:

formula_5

The spin-up electrons are those with spin orientation parallel to the external magnetic field, whereas the spin-down electrons have anti-parallel alignment with the external field. The relative resistance change is now given by the spin polarizations of the two ferromagnets, &quot;P1&quot; and &quot;P2&quot;:

formula_6

If no voltage is applied to the junction, electrons tunnel in both directions with equal rates. With a bias voltage &quot;U&quot;, electrons tunnel preferentially to the positive electrode. With the assumption that spin is conserved during tunneling, the current can be described in a two-current model. The total current is split in two partial currents, one for the spin-up electrons and another for the spin-down electrons. These vary depending on the magnetic state of the junctions.

There are two possibilities to obtain a defined anti-parallel state. First, one can use ferromagnets with different coercivities (by using different materials or different film thicknesses). And second, one of the ferromagnets can be coupled with an antiferromagnet (exchange bias). In this case the magnetization of the uncoupled electrode remains &quot;free&quot;.

The TMR becomes infinite if &quot;P1&quot; and &quot;P2&quot; equal 1, i.e. if both electrodes have 100% spin polarization. In this case the magnetic tunnel junction becomes a switch, that switches magnetically between low resistance and infinite resistance. Materials that come into consideration for this are called &quot;ferromagnetic half-metals&quot;. Their conduction electrons are fully spin-polarized. This property is theoretically predicted for a number of materials (e.g. CrO2, various Heusler alloys) but its experimental confirmation has been the subject of subtle debate. Nevertheless, if one considers only those electrons that enter into transport, measurements by Bowen et al. of up to 99.6% spin polarization at the interface between La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 and SrTiO3 pragmatically amount to experimental proof of this property.

The TMR decreases with both increasing temperature and increasing bias voltage. Both can be understood in principle by magnon excitations and interactions with magnons, as well as due to tunnelling with respect to localized states induced by oxygen vacancies (see Symmetry Filtering section hereafter).

==Symmetry-filtering in tunnel barriers==
Prior to the introduction of epitaxial magnesium oxide (MgO), amorphous aluminum oxide was used as the tunnel barrier of the MTJ, and typical room temperature TMR was in the range of tens of percent. MgO barriers increased TMR to hundreds of percent. This large increase reflects a synergetic combination of electrode and barrier electronic structures, which in turn reflects the achievement of structurally ordered junctions. Indeed, MgO filters the tunneling transmission of electrons with a particular symmetry that are fully spin-polarized within the current flowing across body-centered cubic Fe-based electrodes. Thus, in the MTJ&#x27;s parallel (P) state of electrode magnetization, electrons of this symmetry dominate the junction current. In contrast, in the MTJ&#x27;s antiparallel (AP) state, this channel is blocked, such that electrons with the next most favorable symmetry to transmit dominate the junction current. Since those electrons tunnel with respect to a larger barrier height, this results in the sizeable TMR.

Beyond these large values of TMR across MgO-based MTJs, this impact of the barrier&#x27;s electronic structure on tunnelling spintronics has been indirectly confirmed by engineering the junction&#x27;s potential landscape for electrons of a given symmetry. This was first achieved by examining how the electrons of a lanthanum strontium manganite half-metallic electrode with both full spin (P=+1 ) and symmetry polarization tunnel across an electrically biased SrTiO3 tunnel barrier. The conceptually simpler experiment of inserting an appropriate metal spacer at the junction interface during sample growth was also later demonstrated

While theory, first formulated in 2001, predicts large TMR values associated with a 4eV barrier height in the MTJ&#x27;s P state and 12eV in the MTJ&#x27;s AP state, experiments reveal barrier heights as low as 0.4eV. This contradiction is lifted if one takes into account the localized states of oxygen vacancies in the MgO tunnel barrier. Extensive solid-state tunnelling spectroscopy experiments across MgO MTJs revealed in 2014 that the electronic retention on the ground and excited states of an oxygen vacancy, which is temperature-dependent, determines the tunnelling barrier height for electrons of a given symmetry, and thus crafts the effective TMR ratio and its temperature dependence. This low barrier height in turn enables the high current densities required for spin-transfer torque, discussed hereafter.

==Spin-transfer torque in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs)==
The effect of spin-transfer torque has been studied and applied widely in MTJs, where there is a tunnelling barrier sandwiched between a set of two ferromagnetic electrodes such that there is (free) magnetization of the right electrode, while assuming that the left electrode (with fixed magnetization) acts as spin-polarizer. This may then be pinned to some selecting transistor in a magnetoresistive random-access memory device, or connected to a preamplifier in a hard disk drive application.

The spin-transfer torque vector, driven by the linear response voltage, can be computed from the expectation value of the torque operator:

formula_7

where formula_8 is the gauge-invariant nonequilibrium density matrix for the steady-state transport, in the zero-temperature limit, in the linear-response regime, and the torque operator formula_9 is obtained from the time derivative of the spin operator:

formula_10

Using the general form of a 1D tight-binding Hamiltonian:

formula_11

where total magnetization (as macrospin) is along the unit vector formula_12 and the Pauli matrices properties involving arbitrary classical vectors formula_13, given by

formula_14

formula_15

formula_16

it is then possible to first obtain an analytical expression for formula_9 (which can be expressed in compact form using formula_18, and the vector of Pauli spin matrices formula_19).

The spin-transfer torque vector in general MTJs has two components: a parallel and perpendicular component:

A parallel component:
formula_20

And a perpendicular component:
formula_21

In symmetric MTJs (made of electrodes with the same geometry and exchange splitting), the spin-transfer torque vector has only one active component, as the perpendicular component disappears:

formula_22.

Therefore, only formula_23 vs. formula_24 needs to be plotted at the site of the right electrode to characterise tunnelling in symmetric MTJs, making them appealing for production and characterisation at an industrial scale.

Note: 
In these calculations the active region (for which it is necessary to calculate the retarded Green&#x27;s function) should consist of the tunnel barrier + the right ferromagnetic layer of finite thickness (as in realistic devices). The active region is attached to the left ferromagnetic electrode (modeled as semi-infinite tight-binding chain with non-zero Zeeman splitting) and the right N electrode (semi-infinite tight-binding chain without any Zeeman splitting), as encoded by the corresponding self-energy terms.

==Discrepancy between theory and experiment==
Theoretical tunnelling magneto-resistance ratios of 10000% have been predicted. However, the largest that have been observed are only 604%. One suggestion is that grain boundaries could be affecting the insulating properties of the MgO barrier; however, the structure of films in buried stack structures is difficult to determine. The grain boundaries may act as short circuit conduction paths through the material, reducing the resistance of the device. Recently, using new scanning transmission electron microscopy techniques, the grain boundaries within FeCoB/MgO/FeCoB MTJs have been atomically resolved. This has allowed first principles density functional theory calculations to be performed on structural units that are present in real films. Such calculations have shown that the band gap can be reduced by as much as 45%.

In addition to grain boundaries, point defects such as boron interstitial and oxygen vacancies could be significantly altering the tunnelling magneto-resistance. Recent theoretical calculations have revealed that boron interstitials introduce defect states in the band gap potentially reducing the TMR further
These theoretical calculations have also been backed up by experimental evidence showing the nature of boron within the MgO layer between two different systems and how the TMR is different.

<doc id="845725" wikidata="Q210910" url="?curid=845725" title="Origin of Symmetry">
<text>Origin of Symmetry is the second studio album by English rock band Muse, released on 18 June 2001 through Taste Media. It was produced by John Leckie, who produced Muse&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Showbiz&quot; (1999), and David Bottrill.

&quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; is considered Muse’s breakthrough album. It reached number three on the UK Albums Chart and was certified platinum. Four singles were released: &quot;Plug In Baby&quot;, &quot;New Born&quot;, &quot;Bliss&quot;, and &quot;Hyper Music&quot; / &quot;Feeling Good&quot;. It was their first album to chart in the U.S. As of 2018, &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; had sold more than two million copies worldwide. It received mostly positive reviews, with critics praising its blend of rock and classical music. It has since been named one of the greatest rock albums of the 2000s by several publications.

For the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary in 2021, Muse released a remixed and remastered version, Origin of Symmetry: XX Anniversary RemiXX.

==Writing==
&quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; has been described as alternative rock, progressive rock, hard rock, and space rock. Muse developed it during their tour for their debut album, &quot;Showbiz&quot;. &quot;Feeling Good&quot;, a cover, was written for Broadway by Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse in 1964, and first recorded by Nina Simone for her 1965 album &quot;I Put a Spell on You&quot;.

The album title derives from the 1994 book &quot;Hyperspace&quot; by the theoretical physicist Michio Kaku, which suggests the title &quot;The Origin of Symmetry&quot; for a future book about the discovery of supersymmetry, a reference to &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. According to the Muse songwriter, Matt Bellamy: &quot;Everyone&#x27;s been writing about the origin of life so now they&#x27;ll start looking at the origin of symmetry; there&#x27;s a certain amount of stability in the universe and to find out where it originates from would be to find out if God exists.&quot; Whereas the &quot;Showbiz&quot; lyrics had &quot;wallowed in heartbroken angst&quot;, Bellamy&#x27;s lyrics moved to &quot;sci-fi surrealism&quot;.

==Recording==
After completing the &quot;Showbiz&quot; tour, Muse recorded &quot;Plug In Baby&quot;, &quot;Bliss&quot;, &quot;New Born&quot; and &quot;Darkshines&quot; with the producer David Bottrill, forming the &quot;backbone&quot; of &quot;Origin of Symmetry.&quot; To capture their live energy, Muse recorded together as a band, with some overdubs.

After Bottrill departed to work on the Tool album &quot;Lateralus&quot;, Muse enlisted John Leckie, who had produced &quot;Showbiz.&quot; They recorded in Sawmills in Fowey, Cornwall; Ridge Farm Studio in Surrey; Real World Studios in Box, Wiltshire; and David Gilmour&#x27;s &quot;Astoria&quot; houseboat studio on the Thames. While they were working in Real World Studios, they went to a church in Bath to record a church organ for &quot;Megalomania&quot;.

Having mainly recorded &quot;Showbiz&quot; with a Gibson Les Paul guitar, Bellamy recorded &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; using a custom Manson guitar equipped with a built-in Fuzz Factory, a fuzz distortion effect. It was the first of many collaborations between Bellamy and Manson.

==Release==
&quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; was released on 18 June 2001. It was originally scheduled for release in the United States through Maverick Records, which had also released &quot;Showbiz.&quot; However, Muse left Maverick when they demanded Bellamy rerecord the album with less falsetto, and it was not released in the US until 2005.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; received mainly positive reviews. Roy Wilkinson of &quot;Q&quot; praised it as an &quot;astonishing record... where extra-terrestrial fascinations meet the classical world&#x27;s more unhinged impulses&quot;, adding that &quot;comparisons with Radiohead that dogged Muse&#x27;s early career now seem all but obsolete&quot;. Roger Morton of &quot;NME&quot; called the album a &quot;reinvention of grunge as a neo-classical, high gothic future rock, full of flambéed pianolas and white-knuckle electric camp ... It&#x27;s apparent that Muse can handle their brutal arias.&quot; &quot;Q&quot; named &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; one of the 50 best albums of 2001, while &quot;Kerrang!&quot; named it the ninth-best.

&quot;The Guardian&quot;″s Betty Clarke panned &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; as &quot;unbelievably overblown, self-important and horrible&quot;. The &quot;Stylus&quot; critic Tyler Martin felt that Muse were &quot;very good at their craft&quot;, but that &quot;the constant overplaying of everything waters it all down immensely&quot;.

== Legacy ==
&quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; has made appearances on lists of the greatest rock albums of the 2000s. In 2006, &quot;Q&quot; named it the 74th-greatest album of all time, and in 2008 &quot;Q&quot; readers voted it the 28th-best British album. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; named it the 20th-best British rock album and the 13th best album of the 21st century. For its 10th anniversary, Muse performed &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; in its entirety at the Reading and Leeds Festivals on 26 August and 28 August 2011.

In a retrospective review, Natalie Shaw of BBC Music wrote that &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; &quot;shows a band with the drive and unfettered ambition to create a standalone marvel which not only awakens the ghosts and clichés from prog&#x27;s pompous past, but entirely adds its own voice&quot;. He said that many elements of the band&#x27;s later albums, such as &quot;Black Holes and Revelations&quot; (2006), could be traced back to the album. The author Amy Britton argued that on &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; Bellamy &quot;progressed [his band]&#x27;s sound so much that he earned a new title – this generation&#x27;s guitar hero,&quot; highlighting &quot;Plug In Baby&quot; and &quot;New Born&quot;. In a retrospective review in 2021, the &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Jazz Monroe wrote: &quot;Muse were playing melodrama as teenage realism, an extremely, ridiculously honest noise ... By combining goth vulnerability with sci-fi scale and hard-rock drama, [&quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot;] captures a paradox of young romance: on one hand, Bellamy sounds wracked with despair, but he proclaims his heartbreak with the glee of an ecstatic preacher.&quot;

=== Reissues ===
On 6 December, 2019, &quot;Origin of Symmetry&quot; was remastered and reissued as part of the &quot;Origin of Muse&quot; boxset, alongside &quot;Showbiz&quot;, demos, live performances and other material. On 18 June 2021, the album&#x27;s 20th anniversary, Muse released a remixed and remastered version, &quot;Origin of Symmetry: XX Anniversary RemiXX&quot;. A collaboration with the producer Rich Costey, who worked on several later Muse albums, it features a &quot;more open, dynamic and less crushed sound&quot;. The new mixes also restore elements that were originally muted or obscured, such as string sections on &quot;Space Dementia&quot;, &quot;Citizen Erased&quot; and &quot;Megalomania&quot;, and a harpsichord on &quot;Micro Cuts&quot;. The album features new cover artwork by Sujin Kim. The &quot;Pitchfork&quot; critic Jazz Monroe described the reissue as &quot;definitive ... even more colossal and timeless&quot;.

==Track listing==

*Most streaming services place &quot;Feeling Good&quot; as the eighth track, between &quot;Micro Cuts&quot; and &quot;Screenager&quot;, and include &quot;Futurism&quot; as the 12th track. The Japanese and &quot;XX Anniversary RemiXX&quot; editions place &quot;Futurism&quot; as the 11th track, before &quot;Megalomania&quot;.

<text>A television producer is a person who oversees one or more aspects of a television program. Some producers take more of an executive role, in that they conceive new programs and pitch them to the television networks, but upon acceptance they focus on business matters, such as budgets and contracts. Other producers are more involved with the day-to-day workings, participating in activities such as screenwriting, set design, casting, and directing.

<text>The minister of transport () is a minister of the Crown in the Canadian Cabinet. The minister is responsible for overseeing the federal government&#x27;s transportation regulatory and development department, Transport Canada, the Saint Lawrence Seaway, Nav Canada, and the Port Authority system. Since September 19, 2024, the position has been held by Anita Anand of the Liberal Party.

== History ==
The &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; under section 92(10) established federal responsibility for land and sea transportation between provinces and internationally. Most transportation duties and powers were placed under the minister of public works, with responsibilities for ports and harbours going to the minister of marine and fisheries. In 1879, the Department of Public Works was divided in two, with powers and duties over rail and inland sea transport going to the newly formed minister of railways and canals. The minister of railways and canals was one of the most important cabinet posts because of the importance of railways to the economic development of Canada, with three prime ministers assuming the position either before or during their premiership.

In Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s third cabinet in 1935, C. D. Howe was appointed to both the minister of railways and canals and the minister of marine, which was a short-lived position split from the minister of marine and fisheries in 1930. The office of Minister of Transport was created by Mackenzie King in 1936, which was formally a successor to the minister of railways and canals, and C. D. Howe was appointed as the first Minister of Transport.

From 2006 to 2013, the position was styled Minister of Transport, Infrastructure and Communities, a name change corresponding with responsibility for Infrastructure Canada being transferred to the portfolio at that time. &quot;Minister of Transport&quot; remained the title for legal purposes. With the Cabinet shuffle of July 15, 2013, Infrastructure and Communities portfolio was separated from Transport and assigned to the minister of intergovernmental affairs.

Transport Canada used to manage most of Canada&#x27;s major airports, but in the 1990s, most airports were off-loaded to non-profit private airport authorities. The department is now responsible for transportation safety, appointments to Boards of Governors, and regulation management.

<doc id="845731" wikidata="Q1069636" url="?curid=845731" title="Saurashtra (region)">
<text>Saurashtra, also known as [[Kathiawar]], is a peninsular region of Gujarat, India, located on the Arabian Sea coast. It covers about a third of Gujarat state, notably 11 districts of Gujarat, including Rajkot District. It was formerly a state of India before it merged with Bombay state. In 1961 it separated from Bombay and joined Gujarat.

== Location ==
Saurashtra peninsula is bound on the south and south-west by the Arabian Sea, on the north-west by the Gulf of Kutch and on the east by the Gulf of Khambhat. From the apex of these two gulfs, the Little Rann of Kutch and Khambhat, waste tracts half salt morass half sandy desert, stretch inland towards each other and complete the isolation of Kathiawar, except one narrow neck which connects it on the north-east with the mainland of Gujarat.

The peninsula is sometimes referred to as Kathiawar after the Kathi Darbar, which once ruled most of the region. However, Saurashtra is not entirely synonymous with Kathiawar, since a small portion of the historical Saurashtra region extends beyond the Kathiawar peninsula. Sorath forms the southern portion of the peninsula.

&quot;Sau&quot; means 100 and &quot;rasthra&quot; means languages and Sourasthra is made up with 100 languages so there isn&#x27;t one original word.

According to few experts, the name Saurashtra is derived from Saura Rashtra. In Sanskrit, Saura means Sun and Rashtra means country. It means, country of Sun, and there were 12 sun temples in ancient times in this region. Due to continued Islamic invasions, the idols of deities of these temples were moved to other places, one of those is located at Kanakaditya Temple at Kasheli near Pawas in Ratnagiri district of Maharashtra. The location of other 11 idols are currently unknown.

== Districts ==
The Saurashtra region comprises the south western part of modern Gujarat state and the districts included in this region are:

* Devbhoomi Dwarka
* Jamnagar
* Morbi
* Rajkot
* Porbandar
* Junagadh
* Gir Somnath
* Amreli
* Bhavnagar
* Botad
* Surendranagar
* Ahmedabad (part) {Dhandhuka taluka}

The region also historically encompassed the Diu district of the Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu union territory.

== Etymology ==

The name &quot;Saurashtra&quot; itself is from Sanskrit (, ), the vṛddhi form of (, ), derived from (, ) + (, ). Thus the name literally means &quot;good nation.&quot;

== History ==
Referred to as Saurashtra and as some other names as well over a period of time, since the Mahabharata and Vedic period, this region is mentioned again as Surastrene, or Saraostus in the first century CE Periplus of the Erythraean Sea: 
In earliest foreign mention, Egyptian mathematician, geographer, astrologer Claudius Ptolemy and Greek manuscript Periplus both call this region &quot;Surastrene&quot;

The region is mentioned in the Junagadh Rock inscription dating 150 CE, attributed to Rudradaman I. Prior to this, during the rule of Ashoka (268–232 BCE), the region was under Yavana Tushaspa, and governed by Pushyagupta during Chandragupta Maurya&#x27;s reign (322BC – 298BC). From the 8th to 11th century, Brahmin merchants from Saurashtra region started migrating towards Southern India due to the frequent Muslim invasions, these merchants upon the invitation of Chola, Pandya, Vijayanagara, Nayak and Thanjavur Maratha Kings set up mercantile silk-weaving guilds throughout Southern India and were involved in the trade of silk clothes and diamonds to the royal families of ancient South India, as the silk became the attire of royal families after the period of Gupta dynasty. These Brahmins who trace their ancestry to the historical region of Saurashtra are now known as the Saurashtra people. Several historians believe that it was Saurashtrian textile merchants who introduced idly to South India during the 10th and 12th centuries. There are even claims that a mix of rice and urad dal ground together and later steamed to form cakes had its origins in Gujarat. This was called &quot;Iddada&quot;.

===Gir===
For a long time, the name &quot;Sorath&quot; referred to this region. From the 9th to 14th century Chudasama Rajput ruled Sorath with their capitals Vanthali and Junagadh alternatively. The Chudasama Rajputs ruled Sorath longer than any others, until the Sorath area came under Muslim rule. Sorath, a Muslim name of Saurashtra, was initially one of ten prants, but by the colonial age it was one of only four surviving ones, the others being absorbed. The salute state Junagadh (alias &quot;Junagarh&quot; or the &quot;Old Fort&quot;), founded during British rule, and its neighbouring states were controlled by the Western India States Agency (WISA). In 1947, Junagadh&#x27;s Muslim ruler desired to accede his territory to Pakistan, but the predominantly Hindu population rebelled.

===Saurashtra State===

After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, 217 princely states of Kathiawar, including the former Junagadh State, were merged to form the state of Saurashtra on 15 February 1948. Initially, it was named United State of Kathiawar, which was renamed to Saurashtra State in November 1948. The exercise took up a lot of Shri Vallabhbhai Patel&#x27;s time to convince the local princes and petty subas (totalling 222 in Saurashtra alone). However, Maharaja Krishnakumar Sinhji of Bhavnagar State readily extended to offer his large and royal empire of Bhavnagar / Gohilwar to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel, and Bhavnagar became the first in the country to be merged into the union of India.

The capital of Saurashtra was Rajkot. Uchharangray Navalshankar Dhebar, who later went on to become President of the Indian National Congress between 1955 and 1959, became Saurashtra&#x27;s first Chief Minister. He was succeeded by Rasiklal Umedchand Parikh on 19 December 1954.

On 1 November 1956, Saurashtra was merged into Bombay state. In 1960 Bombay state was divided along linguistic lines into the new states of Gujarat and Maharashtra. The territory of Saurashtra, including Junagadh and all of Sorath, became part of the state of Gujarat. 

== Postage stamps ==
The first postage stamps of the state were issued for Princely State of Junagadh in 1864. They consisted of three lines of Hindi script in colourless letters on black, and were produced by hand-stamping with watercolor ink. A second issue in 1868 used coloured letters, printed in black or red on several colours of paper.

The issue of 1877 was the first to include Latin letters; the circular design included the inscription &quot;SORUTH POSTAGE&quot; at the top, and &quot;ONE ANNA OF A RUPEE&quot; (or &quot;FOUR ANNAS...&quot;) at the bottom. Some of these were surcharged in 1913–14, followed by redesigned stamps in 1914.

A set of eight stamps in 1929 included pictures of Junagadh, the Gir lion, and the Kathi horse in addition to the nawab. In 1937 the one anna value was reissued reading &quot;POSTAGE AND REVENUE&quot;.

The Indian province of Saurashtra did not design any of its own stamps, but before adopting the stamps of India, Saurashtra issued a court fee stamp overprinted for postal use, then created more one anna stamps by surcharging three stamps of the 1929 issue.

== Natural resources ==

Saurashtra has been a flourishing region and rich in natural resources since ancient times, while having gone through several droughts especially during the 20th century. Water resources and its related dynamics have influenced the region and its agro-economy to a certain extent. It is found that water was easily available in the region 10 to 15 years ago. Ashvin A. Shah, a US-based engineering consultant who conducted a survey in 1998 on water availability in the region, says, &quot;The presence of 700,000 dugwells in Saurashtra region indicates the presence of extensive groundwater aquifers throughout the region. This means there is one well for fewer than 20 people or one well every 300 metres&quot;.

Amri Saurashtra went through severe droughts over the years to the extent that people could no longer grow crops, nor did they have drinking water available. There has been in recent times a campaign to take up rain water harvesting.

Significantly, the Check dam campaign from the late 1990s brought almost a drastic change resulting in raising water tables in Saurashtra. However, in 2019, the region was hit with a severe drought, affecting 20 districts in Gujarat, and water had to be brought in by tanker from the Sardar Sarovar Dam on the Narmada River.

<text>The Civic Alliance of Serbia (; abbr. ГСС or GSS) was a liberal political party in Serbia.

==History==
The Civic Alliance of Serbia (GSS) was founded on 10 June 1992. Initially, it was a coalition of two successor parties to Ante Marković&#x27;s Yugoslavia-wide Union of Reform Forces for Serbia proper and Vojvodina, renamed the Reform Party of Serbia and League of Social Democrats of Vojvodina respectively, along with the Serbian successor to the Association for the Yugoslav Democratic Initiative renamed the Republican Club, and the People&#x27;s Peasant Party. In the 1992 election, the coalition was represented by Ratomir Tanić. Following the election, the Republican Club led by Nebojša Popov and the Reform Party of Serbia led by Vesna Pešić merged to form the GSS party.

In 1996 Žarko Korać left the GSS with a group of dissidents who opposed forming coalition with the right-wing Serbian Renewal Movement for the 1996 federal election and formed the Social Democratic Union (SDU).

Notable members over the years included Goran Svilanović, former Foreign Minister of Serbia and Montenegro, Nataša Mićić, former parliamentary president and acting president of Serbia, Gašo Knezević, former Serbian Minister of Education, and Vesna Pešić, the party founder and longtime leader.

The future of the party had been in doubt ever since it split into two wings. One part promoted a merger with Democratic Party, while the other part wanted to continue political existence as an independent party. The December 2004 party congress upheld the decision to remain an independent party and elected Nataša Mićić as the new leader. The party decided to apply for membership of the ELDR and the Liberal International. At its May 2004 council, ELDR, accepted GSS as an affiliate member.

However, GSS merged into Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on April 7, 2007. The party had three representatives in the National Assembly of Serbia in 2007 elected from the list of the LDP.

<doc id="845737" wikidata="Q1199270" url="?curid=845737" title="Glueball">
<text>In particle physics, a glueball (also gluonium, gluon-ball) is a hypothetical composite particle. It consists solely of gluon particles, without valence quarks. Such a state is possible because gluons carry color charge and experience the strong interaction between themselves. Glueballs are extremely difficult to identify in particle accelerators, because they mix with ordinary meson states. In pure gauge theory, glueballs are the only states of the spectrum and some of them are stable.

Theoretical calculations show that glueballs should exist at energy ranges accessible with current collider technology. However, due to the aforementioned difficulty (among others), they have so far not been observed and identified with certainty, although phenomenological calculations have suggested that an experimentally identified glueball candidate, denoted &quot;f&quot;(1710), has properties consistent with those expected of a Standard Model glueball.

The prediction that glueballs exist is one of the most important predictions of the Standard Model of particle physics that has not yet been confirmed experimentally. Glueballs are the only particles predicted by the Standard Model with total angular momentum () (sometimes called &quot;intrinsic spin&quot;) that could be either 2 or 3 in their ground states.

Experimental evidence was announced in 2021, by the TOTEM collaboration at the LHC in collaboration with the DØ collaboration at the former Tevatron collider at Fermilab, of odderon (a composite gluonic particle with odd C-parity) exchange. This exchange, associated with a quarkless three-gluon vector glueball, was identified in the comparison of proton–proton and proton–antiproton scattering. In 2024, the X(2370) particle was determined to have mass and spin parity consistent with that of a glueball. However, other exotic particle candidates such as a tetraquark could not be ruled out.

== Properties ==
In principle, it is theoretically possible for all properties of glueballs to be calculated exactly and derived directly from the equations and fundamental physical constants of quantum chromodynamics (QCD) without further experimental input. So, the predicted properties of these hypothetical particles can be described in exquisite detail using only Standard Model physics that have wide acceptance in the theoretical physics literature. But, there is considerable uncertainty in the measurement of some of the relevant key physical constants, and the QCD calculations are so difficult that solutions to these equations are almost always numerical approximations (calculated using several very different methods). This can lead to variation in theoretical predictions of glueball properties, like mass and branching ratios in glueball decays.

=== Constituent particles and color charge ===
Theoretical studies of glueballs have focused on glueballs consisting of either two gluons or three gluons, by analogy to mesons and baryons that have two and three quarks respectively. As in the case of mesons and baryons, glueballs would be QCD color charge neutral. The baryon number of a glueball is zero.

=== Total angular momentum ===
Double-gluon glueballs can have total angular momentum (which are either scalar or pseudo-scalar) or (tensor). Triple-gluon glueballs can have total angular momentum (vector boson) or 3 (third-order tensor boson). All glueballs have integer total angular momentum that implies that they are bosons rather than fermions.

Glueballs are the only particles predicted by the Standard Model with total angular momentum () (sometimes called &quot;intrinsic spin&quot;) that could be either 2 or 3 in their ground states, although mesons made of two quarks with and with similar masses have been observed and excited states of other mesons can have these values of total angular momentum.

=== Electric charge ===
All glueballs would have an electric charge of zero, as gluons themselves do not have an electric charge.

=== Mass and parity ===
Glueballs are predicted by quantum chromodynamics to be massive, despite the fact that gluons themselves have zero rest mass in the Standard Model. Glueballs with all four possible combinations of quantum numbers (spatial parity) and (charge parity) for every possible total angular momentum have been considered, producing at least fifteen possible glueball states including excited glueball states that share the same quantum numbers but have differing masses with the lightest states having masses as low as (for a glueball with quantum numbers  = 0,  = +1,  = +1, or equivalently  = 0), and the heaviest states having masses as great as almost (for a glueball with quantum numbers  = 0,  = +1,  = −1, or  = 0).

These masses are on the same order of magnitude as the masses of many experimentally observed mesons and baryons, as well as to the masses of the tau lepton, charm quark, bottom quark, some hydrogen isotopes, and some helium isotopes.

=== Stability and decay channels ===
Just as all Standard Model mesons and baryons, except the proton, are unstable in isolation, all glueballs are predicted by the Standard Model to be unstable in isolation, with various QCD calculations predicting the total decay width (which is functionally related to half-life) for various glueball states. QCD calculations also make predictions regarding the expected decay patterns of glueballs. For example, glueballs would not have radiative or two photon decays, but would have decays into pairs of pions, pairs of kaons, or pairs of eta mesons.

== Practical impact on macroscopic low energy physics ==

Standard Model glueballs are extremely ephemeral (decaying almost immediately into more stable decay products) and are only generated in high energy physics. Thus in the natural conditions found on Earth that humans can easily observe, glueballs arise only synthetically. They are scientifically notable mostly because they are a testable prediction of the Standard Model, and not because of phenomenological impact on macroscopic processes, or their engineering applications.

== Lattice QCD simulations ==
Lattice QCD provides a way to study the glueball spectrum theoretically and from first principles. Some of the first quantities calculated using lattice QCD methods (in 1980) were glueball mass estimates. Morningstar and Peardon computed in 1999 the masses of the lightest glueballs in QCD without dynamical quarks. The three lowest states are tabulated below. The presence of dynamical quarks would slightly alter these data, but also makes the computations more difficult. Since that time calculations within QCD (lattice and sum rules) find the lightest glueball to be a scalar with mass in the range of about . Lattice predictions for scalar and pseudoscalar glueballs, including their excitations, were confirmed by Dyson–Schwinger/Bethe–Salpeter equations in Yang–Mills theory.

== Experimental candidates ==

Particle accelerator experiments are often able to identify unstable composite particles and assign masses to those particles to a precision of approximately , without being able to immediately assign to the particle resonance that is observed all of the properties of that particle. Scores of such particles have been detected, although particles detected in some experiments but not others can be viewed as doubtful.

Many of these candidates have been the subject of active investigation for at least eighteen years. The GlueX experiment has been specifically designed to produce more definitive experimental evidence of glueballs.

Some of the candidate particle resonances that could be glueballs, although the evidence is not definitive, include the following:

=== Vector, pseudo-vector, or tensor glueball candidates ===

* X(3020) observed by the BaBar collaboration is a candidate for an excited state of the = 2, 1 or 1 glueball states with a mass of about .

=== Scalar glueball candidates ===
* f0(500) also known as σ – the properties of this particle are possibly consistent with a glueball of mass or .
* f0(980) – the structure of this composite particle is consistent with the existence of a light glueball.
* f0(1370) – existence of this resonance is disputed but is a candidate for a glueball–meson mixing state
* f0(1500) – existence of this resonance is undisputed but its status as a glueball–meson mixing state or pure glueball is not well established.
* f0(1710) – existence of this resonance is undisputed but its status as a glueball–meson mixing state or pure glueball is not well established.

=== Other candidates ===

* Gluon jets at the LEP experiment show a 40% excess over theoretical expectations of electromagnetically neutral clusters, which suggests that electromagnetically neutral particles expected in gluon-rich environments such as glueballs are likely to be present.

<text>Frantic is a 1988 American-French neo-noir mystery thriller film directed by Roman Polanski and starring Harrison Ford and Emmanuelle Seigner. Ennio Morricone composed the film score. Although a commercial failure, the film was a critical success, and has since gone on to become something of a cult classic, with Morricone&#x27;s score being hailed as one of his best.

== Plot ==
Dr. Richard Walker is a surgeon visiting Paris with his wife Sondra for a medical conference. At their hotel, she is unable to unlock her suitcase, and Walker determines that she picked up the wrong one at the airport. While Walker is taking a shower, Sondra receives a phone call that Walker can&#x27;t hear and she mysteriously disappears from their hotel room.

Still jet-lagged, Walker searches for his wife in the hotel with the help of a polite but mostly indifferent staff and then wanders outside to look for her himself. A wino overhears him in a café and says he saw Sondra being forced into a car in a nearby alley. Walker is skeptical, until he finds his wife&#x27;s ID bracelet on the cobblestones. He contacts the Paris police and the U.S. Embassy, but their responses are bureaucratic, and there is little hope anyone will bother looking for her. As Walker carries on the search himself he stumbles onto a murder site where he encounters the streetwise young Michelle, who mistook Sondra&#x27;s suitcase for her own at the airport. He realises that Michelle is a career drug smuggler, but does not care or know for which shady dealers she is hired. Michelle reluctantly helps Walker in his attempt to learn what was packed in her switched suitcase, and how to trade the contents for the return of his kidnapped wife.

Following their visit to Michelle&#x27;s apartment, Walker&#x27;s hotel room and shabby cabarets, it turns out that the smuggled contents are not drugs, but a krytron, an electronic switch used as a detonator for nuclear weapons, stolen and smuggled inside a souvenir replica of the Statue of Liberty, on orders of some Arab country&#x27;s agents. The American embassy, working with Israeli agents, wants to get hold of the precious device, and they have no problem letting Sondra die for it. In order to save his wife, Walker joins forces with Michelle, who is only interested in getting her paycheck.

The film finishes with a confrontation on the Île aux Cygnes, in the middle of the Seine, next to the Paris Statue of Liberty replica, where Sondra is to be released in exchange for the krytron. However, a gunfight ensues between the Arab agents who were to get the precious device, and the Israeli Mossad secret agents who traced them to get hold of it. The Arabs are killed in the crossfire but Michelle is hit too, dying soon after having slipped the krytron into Walker&#x27;s pocket, with Sondra at their side. Furious, Walker shows the krytron device to the Israeli agents before he throws it into the Seine. He carries Michelle&#x27;s body away, ready to leave Paris with his wife.

==Cast==
== Production ==
=== Filming ===
Filming took place on location in Paris with exteriors filmed outside Le Grand Hotel in rue Scribe in the 9th arrondissement. The hotel&#x27;s lobby also appeared in the film.
Filming also took place at the Île aux Cygnes island in the Seine for the Lady Liberty scenes.

== Release ==
&quot;Frantic&quot; was released in the UK on 16 February 1988, with a release of 26 February in the US and a 30 March release in France.

===Box office===
The film was a disappointment at the box-office with a domestic gross of $17,637,950, failing to recoup its production budget. However, the film was more successful in other countries such as France where it received 1,293,721 admissions.

===Critical reception===
Although a commercial failure in the US, &quot;Frantic&quot; was a critical success. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported that 77% of critics gave positive reviews based on a sample of 43 reviews with an average rating of 6.4/10. The site&#x27;s consensus simply calls it &quot;A tense, on-point thriller in the vein of Polanski&#x27;s earlier work&quot;. Metacritic calculated an average score of 66 out of 100 based on 16 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The film received &quot;two thumbs up&quot; from Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert on their &quot;At the Movies&quot;. Roger Ebert, in his review, gave the film three out of four stars, saying: &quot;to watch the opening sequences of &quot;Frantic&quot; is to be reminded of Polanski&#x27;s talent. Here is one of the few modern masters of the thriller and the film noir. &quot;Frantic&quot; is a reminder of how absorbing a good thriller can be.&quot;

Pat Collins of WWOR-TV called it &quot;Polanski&#x27;s best film ever&quot;. Desson Howe, of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, called the movie &quot;vintage Polanski&quot;, with its relentless paranoia, irony, diffident strangers and nutty cameos. British film magazine &quot;Empire&quot; rated the movie three out five, calling it Polanski&#x27;s most satisfying film since &quot;Chinatown&quot;, and one of the best traditional thrillers to come down the pike in quite some time.

<doc id="845743" wikidata="Q18248" url="?curid=845743" title="Una-Sana Canton">
<text>The Una-Sana Canton ( and Serbian: Унско-сански кантон; ) is one of the ten cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, an entity within Bosnia and Herzegovina. It is located in the northwest of the country and has been named after the rivers Una and Sana. The center of the cantonal government is Bihać. The canton is bordered by Republika Srpska from the east, the Canton 10 from the southeast, and Croatia from the south, west, and north.

==Political subdivisions ==
== Demographics ==

The liberalisation of the labour market in Germany in 2017 led to a significant wave of emigration from Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Una-Sana Canton has been the leading region in terms of emigration within the country. In 2021, the Cantonal Ministry of Internal Affairs issued 15,900 certificates of impunity for the purpose of working abroad. This marked an increase from around 13,500 certificates issued in 2017, 14,800 in 2018, and 12,200 in 2019. In 2020, the number of certificates issued was around 9,200. Furthermore, in 2021, approximately 1,500 children enrolled in the first year of primary school, which is 2,000 fewer than 20 years ago.

=== 1991 ===

In the 1991 census, the Canton of Una-Sana had 330,479 residents, including:

*241,511 (73.08%) Muslims
*67,351 (20.38%) Serbs
*8,766 (2.653%) Croats
*12,851 (3.887%) others

=== 2013 Census ===
==Traffic==
Due to the proximity to Croatia and its narrow northern outline, various important traffic lines between Zagreb and the Adriatic traverse the Una-Sana canton, such as the railway line Novi Grad-Bihać-Knin. The airport of Željava is located near Bihać and is located right between the Bosnian and Croatian border.

<doc id="845746" wikidata="Q977999" url="?curid=845746" title="Nadine Coyle">
<text>Nadine Elizabeth Louise Coyle (born 15 June 1985) is an Irish singer. In 2002, she was selected as a member of Girls Aloud, a pop girl group created through ITV&#x27;s reality competition show &quot;&quot;. The group went on to receive large success, achieving a string of 20 consecutive UK top ten singles (including four number ones), two UK number one albums, five consecutive platinum selling studio albums, and receiving nominations for five BRIT Awards, winning Best Single in 2009 for &quot;The Promise&quot;.

In 2010, Coyle released her debut solo studio album, &quot;Insatiable,&quot; and its title track, through her own record label, Black Pen Records, in partnership with supermarket giant Tesco. In 2017, she released the single &quot;Go to Work&quot; on Virgin EMI Records, and later that year, she released her debut EP, &quot;Nadine&quot;.

==Early life==
Coyle was born on 15 June 1985 to Lillian and Niall Coyle in Derry, Northern Ireland. Her parents first noticed her talent for singing at the age of two, when she sang the Drifters&#x27; &quot;Saturday Night at the Movies&quot;. Coyle was uninterested in her education but received good marks. She recorded a demo CD, which was distributed to Louis Walsh and &quot;The Late Late Show&quot;. The CD included cover versions of &quot;Fields of Gold&quot;, &quot;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&quot;, &quot;Love Is&quot; and the aria &quot;Summertime&quot;.

==Career==
===2001: &quot;Popstars&quot;===
While attending Thornhill College in 2001, Coyle auditioned for the Irish version of the reality television talent show &quot;Popstars&quot;, on which Louis Walsh was a judge. She won a place in the band Six, but it was later revealed that she had lied about her age. She was 16 years old, two years younger than the minimum age requirement of 18. She returned to Thornhill College in Derry.

===2002–2009: Girls Aloud===

Walsh encouraged Coyle to enter &quot;&quot;, the second British series of the international &quot;Popstars&quot; franchise. The series&#x27; goal was to create two winning pop groups – a boy band and a girl group, each consisting of five members who would then partake in &quot;a battle of the sexes&quot; as they vie for the Christmas number one on the UK Singles Chart. Several thousand applicants attended auditions across the UK in hope of being selected. Ten girls and ten boys were chosen as finalists by judges Walsh, Pete Waterman and Geri Halliwell. These finalists then took to the stage participating in weekly Saturday night live performances (alternating weekly between the girls and boys). Following her performance of &quot;Fields of Gold&quot;, Walsh told her she gave the &quot;performance of the night. Stole the show for me,&quot; while fellow judge Halliwell said, &quot;I&#x27;d love to buy a single of yours already&quot;.

Coyle joined Cheryl Tweedy, Sarah Harding, Nicola Roberts and Kimberley Walsh to comprise the new girl group Girls Aloud, formed through the show by a public vote on 30 November 2002. The group&#x27;s debut single &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart, becoming the 2002 Christmas number one. Girls Aloud hold the record for the shortest time between formation and reaching number one. The group released their debut album &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot; in May 2003, which entered the charts at number two and was certified platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) later the same year. Their singles &quot;I&#x27;ll Stand by You&quot;, &quot;Walk This Way&quot; and &quot;The Promise&quot; charted at number one. Two of their albums have reached the top of the UK Albums Chart: their greatest hits album &quot;The Sound of Girls Aloud&quot; and 2008&#x27;s &quot;Out of Control&quot;, both of which entered the chart at number one, with over one million copies of the former being sold.
They also achieved seven certified albums and have been nominated for five Brit Awards, winning the 2009 Best Single for &quot;The Promise&quot;.

The group&#x27;s musical style is pop, but throughout their career they had experimented with electropop and dance-pop. Girls Aloud&#x27;s collaborations with Brian Higgins and his songwriting and production team Xenomania earned the group critical acclaim, due to an innovative approach to mainstream pop music. The group became one of the few UK reality television acts to achieve continued success, amassing a fortune of £30 million by May 2010. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; lists them as &quot;Most Successful Reality TV Group&quot; in the 2007 edition. They also hold the record for &quot;Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a Female Group&quot; in the 2008 edition and are credited again for &quot;Most Successful Reality TV Group&quot; in the 2011 edition. The group was also named the United Kingdom&#x27;s biggest-selling girl group of the 21st century, with over 4.3 million singles sales and 4 million albums sold in the UK alone.

===2009–2013: &quot;Insatiable&quot; and Girls Aloud reunion===

In 2009, Girls Aloud decided they would partake in a hiatus to pursue solo projects. That same year, Coyle collaborated with Boyz II Men for their album &quot;Love&quot;, recording a cover of the Take That song &quot;Back for Good&quot;, although the song was cut from the final track listing. Coyle also worked with Jay Sean, although the duet was later scrapped.

Coyle announced plans to release a solo album during Girls Aloud&#x27;s hiatus. She enlisted Barbara Charone, who has worked with Madonna and Christina Aguilera, as a publicist and Bruce Garfield as her manager. Early reports indicated three major record labels interested in Coyle, In April 2010, it was reported she had signed to Geffen Records. The deal later fell through. In August 2010, Coyle officially signed a deal with grocery store chain Tesco&#x27;s new record label, releasing the album through her own Black Pen Records imprint.

She worked with a number of famous songwriters and producers during recording sessions, such as Desmond Child, Guy Chambers, Mike Elizondo, Steve Booker, Toby Gad, Tony Kanal and newcomer Ricci Riccardi. According to an interview with Booker, Coyle had worked on song ideas using GarageBand which she then presented to Booker in England to work on together further. The producer said, &quot;She was singing her songs to loops, and then I took the loops out and rewrote the music from scratch to her ideas.&quot; He described her songs as &quot;very pop&quot;. Booker also worked on songs to show off Coyle&#x27;s vocals: &quot;Because she&#x27;s got such a belting voice, I tried a couple of things where she could really belt,&quot; he said.

The album was preceded by the release of her debut single, the title track &quot;Insatiable&quot;. Co-written with Guy Chambers and produced by Ricci Riccardi, the song has an &quot;80s feel&quot; and &quot;a harder, guitar-led sound.&quot; The single peaked at number twenty-six in the UK Singles Chart.

In November 2012, Coyle reunited with the rest of Girls Aloud to celebrate their tenth anniversary. On 18 November 2012, the band released their new single &quot;Something New&quot; which was also the official charity single for Children in Need. The group released their second greatest hits compilation &quot;Ten&quot; on 26 November 2012. Coyle and the group embarked on the in February. After the tour&#x27;s conclusion in March 2013, the group announced that they were disbanding.

===2015–present: &quot;Nadine&quot; and new projects===
In late June, Coyle appeared on ITV&#x27;s &quot;Michael Flatley: A Night to Remember&quot;, as part of &quot;ITV Music Specials&quot;. On the programme she sang a cover of &quot;Dangerous Games&quot;, shortly thereafter she announced she would star alongside Flatley on his 2014 tour on select dates. Coyle, in August, also revealed she has been in the studio recording new songs for a forthcoming second studio album.

On 16 September 2014, Coyle announced that she began working with longtime collaborator Brian Higgins. In March 2015, Coyle spoke about the details concerning her second album, stating that she intended on signing with a major label and that the sound is &quot;similar&quot; to that of London Grammar. Later that year, Nadine recorded a duet with Shane Filan from the band Westlife for his album &quot;Right Here&quot;. They performed the single, titled &quot;I Could Be&quot; together on that year&#x27;s annual &quot;Children in Need&quot; telethon.

In July 2017, it was announced that Coyle had signed a recording deal with Virgin EMI Records. She released her new single, &quot;Go to Work&quot;, on 8 September 2017. In February 2018, it was announced that Coyle will release a four-track EP &quot;Nadine&quot; in April 2018. &quot;Girls on Fire&quot; was the first track to be released from the EP, on 8 February 2018.

Coyle announced a seven-date tour, touring the UK and Ireland in May 2018. The tour was cancelled without reschedule in April 2018, a month before commencing, with Coyle stating it was becoming &quot;impossible to achieve&quot; what they had wanted to do and that the cancellation was &quot;definitely a lesson&quot; for her. In 2019, Coyle returned to the music scene with her summer anthem &quot;Fool for Love&quot;, produced by Brian Higgins of Xenomania. In December of that year, Coyle announced another track called &quot;All That I Know&quot; which was released in 2020.

In October 2022, Nadine sang a cover of the Cranberries classic &quot;Zombie&quot;, as it was voted the number 1 Irish song of all time by RTE2FM listeners. Her performance gathered great reviews.

In July 2023, Coyle attended the European premiere of &quot;Barbie&quot; and released a new single, a cover of Snow Patrol&#x27;s classic &quot;Chasing Cars&quot;. Coyle&#x27;s version is titled &quot;If I Lay Here (Chasing Cars)&quot;.

In May and June 2024, Coyle and her Girls Aloud bandmates got back together for an arena tour titled The Girls Aloud Show in memory of their late bandmate Sarah Harding.

==Other ventures==
As a member of Girls Aloud, Coyle has also appeared in the fly on the wall documentary &quot;Girls Aloud: Home Truths&quot;, the E4 documentary series &quot;Girls Aloud: Off the Record&quot; and a one-off variety show entitled &quot;The Girls Aloud Party&quot;. Coyle made a cameo appearance in Natasha Bedingfield&#x27;s video for &quot;I Wanna Have Your Babies&quot;.

Coyle contributed to the book &quot;Dreams that Glitter - Our Story&quot;, an autobiography with her Girls Aloud bandmates, in October 2008. The book was written with a ghostwriter and published by the Transworld imprint Bantam Press. The book featured unseen photographs and included insights into the members&#x27; personal lives, their success together, style tips and &quot;everything we&#x27;ve learned about life, love and music.&quot;

As a member of Girls Aloud, Coyle has also endorsed Barbie, KitKat, Nintendo DS, Samsung, Sunsilk and Pandora.

In December 2009, Coyle visited her hometown of Derry to successfully break the record of the most trees planted in one site in an hour by 100 volunteers. Coyle has also dedicated some of her time to charities, including the Northern Ireland children&#x27;s hospice.

Coyle published her new record label Black Pen Records, which additionally released her debut album &quot;Insatiable&quot; and her further singles. In 2012, Coyle served as a guest judge for an episode of the series &quot;America&#x27;s Next Top Model&quot;.

In March 2018, Coyle appeared in Fabulous Magazine with a cover photo shoot and feature interview where she discussed life after Girls Aloud.

In 2019, Coyle participated in the nineteenth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; and finished in fifth place.

==Personal life==
Coyle had a cancer scare when she found a lump in her breast when she was 17.

In 2006, Coyle moved from Northern Ireland to Los Angeles, California. This led to her constantly commuting back and forth between the US and the UK for her projects with Girls Aloud and as a solo artist. Whilst living in Los Angeles, Coyle opened an Irish pub restaurant in Sunset Beach, California named Nadine&#x27;s Irish Mist in 2008 as a family business, which would allow family members to live near her and help her run the business. In 2013, her estimated wealth was £6 million according to that year&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Rich List.

On 15 August 2013, Coyle announced on her Instagram account that she was expecting a child. She further confirmed her reunion with ex-fiancé Jason Bell, who is the father of her daughter. Their daughter, Anaíya Bell, was born on 10 February 2014.

In 2015, after nine years in Los Angeles, Coyle closed down Nadine&#x27;s Irish Mist and moved back to Northern Ireland to raise her daughter Anaíya. She stated that she decided to close the restaurant as the business gradually took a toll on her overworked family members and that she was tired of being approached by film and television producers who wanted to use the restaurant for their projects. She also stated that she was becoming homesick for Northern Ireland whilst living in Los Angeles.

Coyle and Bell split in 2019 &quot;due to their increasingly distanced lives&quot;, as Bell remained in the United States when Coyle returned to Northern Ireland. However, by 2021 the two were living together in Northern Ireland to allow Bell to co-parent Anaíya during the COVID-19 pandemic.

<doc id="845750" wikidata="Q3422344" url="?curid=845750" title="Rational-legal authority">
<text>Rational-legal authority (also known as rational authority, legal authority, rational domination, legal domination, or bureaucratic authority) is a form of leadership in which the authority of an organization or a ruling regime is largely tied to legal rationality, legal legitimacy and bureaucracy. The majority of the modern states of the twentieth and twenty-first centuries are rational-legal authorities, according to those who use this form of classification.

Scholars such as Max Weber and Charles Perrow characterized the rational-legal bureaucracy as the most efficient form of administration. Critics challenge that rational-legal authority is as rational and unbiased as presented, as well as challenge that it is effective.

==Rational-legal authority==
In sociology, the concept of rational-legal domination comes from Max Weber&#x27;s tripartite classification of authority (one of several classifications of government used by sociologists); the other two forms being traditional authority and charismatic authority. All of those three domination types represent an example of his ideal type concept. Weber noted that in history those ideal types of domination are always found in combinations.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition. Charismatic authority is legitimized by the personality and leadership qualities of the ruling individual. Finally, rational-legal authority derives its powers from the system of bureaucracy and legality.

==Legal rationality and legitimate authority ==
Under rational-legal authority, legitimacy is seen as coming from a legal order and the laws that have been enacted in it (see also natural law and legal positivism).

Weber defined legal order as a system where the rules are enacted and obeyed as legitimate because they are in line with other laws on how they can be enacted and how they should be obeyed. Further, they are enforced by a government that monopolizes their enactment and the legitimate use of physical force.

If society, as a whole, approves the exercise of the power in a certain way, then the power is considered &quot;legitimate authority&quot;.

== Max Weber&#x27;s theory: type of authority ==
Max Weber broke down legitimate authority into three different types of societies: Traditional Authority, Rational-legal Authority, and Charismatic Authority. Each of these authorities have their own unique complex societies that have evolved from simple definitions.

=== 1.Traditional authority: traditional grounds ===

* Is the type of power that has been around longer, it is the type of power that is traditionally rooted in beliefs and the practices of society. This authority is liked by many individuals for two main reasons: the inheritance of past generations and religiousness that the societies have.
* Traditional authority is based on a tradition or custom that is followed by the traditional leaders. In traditional authority, status is a key concept. There are no requirements to serving as a traditional leader but there are no salaries. The consequences to traditional authority are discouragement of education and rational calculation.
* Traditional authority consists of a dominant profile, one who embodies tradition and rule. This type of leadership exemplifies the power to construct order.

=== 2. Rational-legal authority: rational grounds ===

* Acquired from law and is constructed from the reliance of society&#x27;s rules and laws. This type of authority has the confidence to leave the right of leaders to undertake the decisions and set the policy. Rational-legal authority is the basis of modern democracies. Examples of this type of authority: officials elected by voters, rules that are in the constitution, or policies that are written in a formal document.
* Rational-legal authority is built on a structure of bureaucracy. In a rational-legal authority one ascends in their career paths through promotion and they eventually retire. Some of the benefits of rational-legal authority are transportation, large-scale industry, mass communication and an income economy. Other outcomes of rational-legal authority are tendencies towards equal opportunity and a promotion of education.
* Rational-legal authority requires a logical and systematic approach to leadership. Weber&#x27;s rational leadership prevails in decision making.
* Finally, Legal Rational Authority derives its power from the system of bureaucracy and legality.

=== 3. Charismatic authority: charismatic grounds ===

* Comes from individuals and their personal qualities. Certain individuals are influential to others with their unique qualities which help them gain followers. The span of a &quot;charismatic&quot; individual&#x27;s power and authority can vary from a specific group to an entire society. Examples of charismatic leaders include: Joan of Arc, Adolf Hitler, Martin Luther King Jr, Jesus Christ.
* Charismatic authority has no clear structure; it is based on individual influence. One is chosen to be staff by their charismatic characteristics. Someone under a charismatic authority lives under gifts not salary. As long as someone has influence they will be a legitimate power.
* In charismatic authority, confidence is the driving force for leadership. With charismatic authority leadership has the ability to connect distinct groups and lead them to the finish line.

==Emergence of the modern state==
Weber wrote that the modern state based on rational-legal authority emerged from the patrimonial and feudal struggle for power (see traditional authority) uniquely in the Occidental civilization. The prerequisites for the modern Western state are:
* Monopolization by central authority of the means of administration and control based on a centralized and stable system of taxation and use of physical force
* Monopolization of legislative
* Organisation of an officialdom, dependent upon the central authority

Weber argued that some of those attributes have existed in various time or places, but together they existed only in Occidental civilization. The conditions that favoured this were
* Emergence of rational-legal rationality (various status groups in the Occident promoted that emergence)
* Emergence of modern officialdom (bureaucracy), which required
** Development of the money economy, where officials are compensated in money instead of kind (usually land grants)
** Quantitative and qualitative expansion of administrative tasks
** Centralization and increased efficiency of administration.

Weber&#x27;s belief that rational-legal authority did not exist in Imperial China has been heavily criticized, and does not have many supporters in the early 21st century.

==Modern state==
According to Max Weber, a modern state exists where a political community has:
* An administrative and legal order that has been created and can be changed by legislation that also determines its role
* Binding authority over citizens and actions in its jurisdiction
* The right to legitimately use the physical force in its jurisdiction

An important attribute of Weber&#x27;s definition of a modern state was that it is a bureaucracy.

The vast majority of the modern states from the 20th century onward fall under the rational-legal authority category.

==Rational-legal leaders==
The majority of modern bureaucratic officials and political leaders represent this type of authority.

Officials:
* Are personally free.
* Serve a higher authority.
* Are appointed on the basis of conduct and their technical qualifications.
* Are responsible for the impartial execution of assigned tasks.
* Their work is a full-time occupation.
* Their work is methodical and rational
* Their work is rewarded by a salary and prospects of career advancement.

Politicians:
* Are solely responsible for independent action.
* Must recognize that public actions that conflict with their basic policy must be rejected.
* Should have charismatic appeal to win elections under conditions of universal suffrage.

Weber provided ten necessities addressing: &quot;how individual officials are appointed and work&quot;. The administrative staff are under the supreme authority for legal authority in a bureaucratic administrative style.

# They are personally free and subject to authority only with respect to their impersonal official obligation.
# They are organized in a clearly defined hierarchy of offices.
# Each office has a clearly defined sphere of competence in the legal sense.
# The office is filled by a free contractual relationship or free selection.
# Candidates are selected on the basis of technical qualification.
# They are remunerated by fixed salaries in money for the most part, with a right to pensions.
# The office is treated as the sole, or at least primary, occupation of incumbent.
# It constitutes a career. Promotions are dependent on the judgement of superiors.
# The official works entirely separated from ownership of the means of administration and without appropriation of his/her position.
# He is subject to strict and systematic discipline and control in the conduct of the office.

<text>Patrick Nuo (born 31 August 1982) is a Swiss singer.

==Early life==
Nuo was born and raised in Lucerne, Switzerland, where he lived till the age of 17. His mother is Swiss and his father is an ethnic Albanian from Kosovo. He has a younger brother, Simon. At the age of 14, Nuo abandoned all hope of becoming a popular tennis pro and decided to focus on a musical career instead. After a few misleading steps at home, he managed to move to Hamburg, Germany, where he was engaged as a backing vocalist for several record productions. In the meantime he also worked as a model for charity projects. His final home of residence for many years now is Los Angeles, California.

==Career==
In 2002, Patrick met producer and songwriter David Jost, who helped Nuo sign a contract with Warner Music. In the following months, the duo created a whole album together, which was eventually released under the name &quot;Welcome&quot; in September 2003. A top 20 chart success in Switzerland and Germany, it spawned three singles; including debut single &quot;5 Days&quot; and follow-up &quot;Reanimate&quot;, which reached number 18 on the Swiss Singles Chart. 

That same year, Nuo joined Zeichen der Zeit, a Christian music project whose first single &quot;Du bist nicht allein&quot; became a top ten success in Germany. A second single released from the project&#x27;s self-titled compilation album, &quot;Ein weiterer Morgen&quot;, entered the top 40 of the German Singles Chart the following year. Also in 2004, a reissue of &quot;Welcome&quot; was released. It spawned the single &quot;Undone&quot;, which served as the theme song for American comedy film &quot;Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed&quot; (2004) in German-speaking Europe.

In May 2005, Nuo&#x27;s second album &quot;Superglue&quot; was released. While not as commercially successful as &quot;Welcome&quot; in Germany, it would eventually become his highest-charting to date, reaching number four on the Swiss Albums Chart. Two singles were released from &quot;Superglue&quot;: &quot;Girl in the Moon&quot; and &quot;Beautiful&quot;, the latter of which became his first and only top ten hit to date. The song peaked at number nine and number seven in Switzerland and Austria respectively. In 2006, Nuo reteamed with Zeichen der Zeit to produce their second album &quot;Generation David&quot; (2006), and participated in another non-profit aid project when he provided vocals for the Fury in the Slaughterhouse cover, charity single &quot;Won&#x27;t Forget These Days&quot;, released during the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

In 2007, after a label change to Ariola Records, Nuo&#x27;s third album &quot;Nuo&quot; was released. It widely failed to match the success of his previous studio albums and produced three singles of which lead single &quot;Watchin&#x27; Over You&quot; became the only single to chart. In September 2009, the single &quot;Come On Now&quot; was released on Flash Records.

In 2011, Nuo became a member of the jury in the German &quot;Idol&quot; series show &quot;Deutschland sucht den Superstar&quot; alongside producer Dieter Bohlen and singer Fernanda Brandão. In 2013, he was one out of eleven celebrities who joined the seventh season of &quot;Ich bin ein Star – Holt mich hier raus!&quot; based on the British reality television show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;. He finished fifth.

<doc id="845754" wikidata="Q1279026" url="?curid=845754" title="Liberal Alliance of Montenegro">
<text>Liberal Alliance of Montenegro () was a Montenegrin separatist, liberal and anti-war political party, active between 1990 and 2005. The Liberal Alliance was a full member of the Liberal International from 1994 until the party&#x27;s dissolution in 2005.

== History ==
The LSCG was the first political party to advocate an independent Montenegro during the Yugoslav Wars period, and remained a strong supporter of the idea of independence throughout its existence.

It was also one of the only two parties, alongside the Social Democratic Party, which openly opposed the Montenegrin involvement in the War in Croatia and the shelling of Dubrovnik in 1991. Despite advocating Montenegrin nationalism and thus pursuing separatist policies, LSCG was a strictly pacifist party, opting for democratic means in its political activity. It also openly supported the restoration of the Montenegrin language and Montenegrin Orthodox Church.

The LSCG was founded on 26 January 1990 by a group of Montenegrin pro-independence oriented intellectuals led by Slavko Perović. The LSCG did not participate in the 1990 parliamentary election, but Perović was one of the candidates on the electoral list of the Union of Reform Forces (SRSJ), which won 17 seats and became the second minority.

=== Foundation and anti-war activism (1990–1995) ===
During the independence referendum campaign in 1992, the LSCG was the main promoter of independence together with Albanian minority Democratic Alliance in Montenegro. The two parties decided to boycott the referendum, which resulted in the pro-independence option receiving only 3.14% of the vote, which meant that Montenegro would remain a constituent republic (along with Serbia) of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

The first election the LSCG participated in was the 1992 parliamentary elections, in which it won 12,04% of the vote and 13 seats. This made it the third largest party in Montenegro, trailing behind the DPS and the NS. That same year, LSCG leader Slavko Perović was the party&#x27;s presidential candidate, also coming in third place with 18,3% of the vote. He was eliminated before the second round of the election, which was won by Momir Bulatović (DPS).

=== Popular Unity coalition (1996) ===
At the 1996 parliamentary election, the LSCG entered a coalition agreement with the People&#x27;s Party (NS) called Popular Unity. The idea was that such a coalition would open the way for reconciliation of Montenegrins and Serbs, and they could start thinking about politics in a different way. The coalition of liberals and populists won 24.91% of votes and gained 19 MPs, 9 of which went to the LSCG. However, the LSCG terminated the coalition after the decision of the NS to enter into coalition with ruling Democratic Party of Socialists of Montenegro.

=== Crisis and leadership change (1997–2000) ===
At the 1997 presidential election, the LSCG did not table a candidate. However, in the second round the party supported Milo Đukanović over Momir Bulatović, in order to send a message that they were not against the &quot; West &quot; which had supported Đukanović&#x27;s candidacy. At the next parliamentary election in 1998, the LSCG won 6,21% of the vote, slightly over than 20,000 votes, and 5 seats in the Montenegrin parliament. The LSCG lost a significant number of voters due to a change of policy by the DPS, which gradually started supporting the independence of Montenegro, attracting a portion of their voters. Due to the poor electoral result, Perović resigned from his post. At the party electoral convention, held on 23 and 24 January 1999, Miodrag Živković officially became the new political leader of the LSCG.

=== Minority government support and decline (2001–2003) ===
At the 2001 parliamentary election, the LSCG received a larger number of votes: 7,85% (almost 28.000 votes), winning 6 seats in the Assembly. Due do the political deadlock, in which no party had won an absolute majority, the LSCG made an agreement with DPS to support its minority government. This decision came following a pledge from the DPS that within a year a referendum on independence would have been held. However, the LSCG still retained a resolute attitude of opposition, and withdrew support to the minority government due to the fact that the referendum had not been announced in the promised period. At the 2002 parliamentary election, the LSCG campaign under the slogan &quot;Montenegro Can - LSCG&quot;, and won 5,77% of votes (just over 20.000 votes), receiving only 4 seats.

Together with other opposition parties, the LSCG boycotted the presidential election held in February 2003, but opted to table a candidate for the presidential election just three months later. LSCG candidate Miodrag Živković won 31,44% of votes, but was defeated in the first round by the ruling coalition candidate Filip Vujanović. These elections would prove be the last election the Liberal Alliance participated in.

=== The rift and dissolution (2004–2005) ===
Following the outbreak of the &quot;Trsteno Affair&quot; (sr), a corruption scandal related to the selling of state-owned Trsteno beach and cove in Kotor municipality, the involved party officials led by incumbent party president Miodrag Živković were expelled from the party on 7 September 2004. The expelled party faction led by Živković went on to form the Liberal Party (LP) in October 2004. Following the expulsion of Živković, Vesna Perović was elected as new leader of LSCG on 23 October 2004. However, following the corruption scandal and general crisis in the party, just a year before the main goal laid out in its program, Montenegrin independence, was to be carried out at the 21 May Referendum, the LSCG passed a decision to infinitely freeze its activity, a move declared to be a response to the constant repressive activity by the Montenegrin Agency of National Security.

<text>The Central Bosnia Canton (, ) is one of 10 cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The most populous settlement in the region is Bugojno, followed by Travnik and Novi Travnik.

== Geography ==
It is in the country&#x27;s center, west of Sarajevo. The center of canton government is Travnik.

== Municipalities ==
The canton is split into the municipalities of Bugojno, Busovača, Dobretići, Donji Vakuf, Fojnica, Gornji Vakuf-Uskoplje, Jajce, Kiseljak, Kreševo, Novi Travnik, Travnik, Vitez. The region reports a GDP equitable with the average of Bosnia and Herzegovina more broadly. The region has historically benefitted from and economically relied on agriculture, trade, as well as mineral deposits. The Central Bosnia Canton is the fifth largest of ten and its share of the national population is slightly below average.

In April 2022, the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction recognized the region in a climate resilience initiative.

== Demographics ==

Of the ten cantons comprising the Federation of Bosnia Herzegovina, Central Bosnia Canton and Herzegovina-Neretva Canton are the only ones in which neither the Bosniaks nor Croats form an absolute majority. There are thus special legislative procedures for the protection of the constituent ethnic groups. The Bosniaks form a majority in the municipalities of Bugojno, Jajce, Donji Vakuf, Fojnica, Gornji Vakuf-Uskoplje, Novi Travnik and Travnik. The Croats form a majority in the municipalities of Busovača, Dobretići, Kreševo, Kiseljak and Vitez.

<doc id="845760" wikidata="Q872773" url="?curid=845760" title="Traditional authority">
<text>Traditional authority is a form of leadership in which the authority of an organization or a regime is largely tied to tradition or custom. Reasons for the given state of affairs include belief that tradition is inherently valuable and a more general appeal to tradition.

==In sociology==
In sociology, the concept of traditional authority (domination) comes from Max Weber&#x27;s tripartite classification of authority, the other two forms being charismatic authority and rational-legal authority. All of those three domination types represent an example of his ideal type concept. Weber noted that in history those ideal types of domination are always found in combinations.

In traditional authority, the legitimacy of the authority comes from tradition; in charismatic authority from the personality and leadership qualities of the individual; and in rational-legal authority from people that are bureaucratically and legally attached to certain positions.

===Patriarchs and their households===
Weber derives the traditional domination from patriarchies and their households – in other words, from the ancient tradition of family (the authority of a master over his household). The master is designated in accordance with the rules of inheritance. He has no administrative staff nor any machinery to enforce his will by force alone; he depends on the willingness of the group members to respect his authority. Those members stand in personal relations to him. They obey him based on the belief that this is their duty sanctioned by immemorial tradition and on feeling of filial piety for the person of the master.

=== Patrimonialism ===

Patrimonial government occurs when the ruler&#x27;s household expands with the household administration giving rise to governmental offices. All officials are personal dependents or favourites of the ruler, appointed by him. Their interactions with the ruler are based on paternal authority and filial dependence. The officials treat their work as a personal service to the ruler. The ruler has complete control over the officials; he empowers them from case to case, assigns specific tasks, promotes and demotes. They have no rights, rather they have privileges granted and withdrawn by the ruler. It is rare to discover any clear and stable hierarchy and responsibility in the deluge of official titles of most patrimonial administrations.

Military force is an important instrument of a patrimonial rule. Weber distinguished five types of military organisations. In all of those cases the military is a tool of the ruler, solely for his use—but he is responsible for its upkeep (equipment, maintenance and wages).

With the growth of the territory organized and more independent administrative staff and military force became a necessity. This usually leads to decentralisation, and some individuals gain more independence in the form of certain rights (for example, the right to inheritance and marriage without the consent of the rulers, to be judged by independent courts instead of officials of the royal household, etc.).

One of the best examples of almost pure type of patrimonialism is ancient Egypt, where the population was entirely dependent upon the control of the waterways (Nile River). This facilitated the creation of centralised government. When the royal household required it, the individual had to perform the public duties, such as participate in labor-intensive project (rising of the pyramids). Thus the whole country was in fact the patriarchal household of the pharaoh.

When land is given to military or officials for the performance of their duties, their independence increases and the power of the ruler weakens (consider the Mameluks and their rebellions, or the difference between Chinese Confucian literati who were never able to overthrow the power of the emperor and European knights who evolved into powerful aristocracy in many cases vastly limiting the power of the kings (especially in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth)).

Patrimonial dominance has often prevailed in the Orient, where land remained in the control of the ruler. However, in the Occident the ruler lost control of the lands given to the nobility, which according to Weber was a major reason for patrimonialism being replaced by feudalism.

===Feudalism===
When compared to patrimonialism, feudalism has one major similarity and several important differences.

The similarity is that both are based on tradition and have powerful rulers who grant rights in return for military and administrative services.

The differences are important for the subtler distinction:
* feudalism replaces the paternal relationship of patrimonialism by a contract of allegiance based on knightly militarism.
* the patrimonial ruler&#x27;s grants of authority and the personal dependence of official are replaced in feudalism by the contractual freedom, personal allegiance and socioeconomic prominence on the part of the vassals.

===Traditional leaders===
Most of the representatives of any dynasty ruling for more than one generation (kings, emperors, sultans, etc.) would fall into that category. Thus, the majority of monarchies and some autocracies and theocracies would be ruled by traditional leaders.

Often the male head of a common family should be considered a traditional leader. This could also be the case in a family-owned business if its director and other leadership positions are chosen based on family ties and/or age.

<text>Options is a 1975 absurdist science fiction novel by American writer Robert Sheckley, published in paperback by Pyramid Books. The first British edition appeared in 1977, and a French translation was published in 1979.

The story is ostensibly about a marooned space traveller&#x27;s attempt to get a spare part for his starship, the &quot;Intrepid III&quot;. He has a robotic guard, programmed to guard him against all planetary dangers. But soon he discovers that the robot has not been programmed for the planet where they are, with comic results. However, the narrative later descends into a mass of diversions, non-sequiturs and meditations on the nature of authorship. Eventually the diversions take over the book to the extent that the author openly introduces an increasingly bizarre succession of deus ex machina in an attempt to get the novel back on track, but eventually admits defeat.

==Reception==
Spider Robinson reviewed the novel favorably, declaring that although Sheckley deliberately broke most of the rules for successful storytelling, &quot;Options&quot; was &quot;hilarious... an exploding cigarette, a velvet banana, a bearded tractor, a Presbyterian platypus.&quot;

Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Options&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #86, and stated that &quot;the author is &#x27;unable&#x27; to construct a credible plot device to save the situation. Lots of fun but, for obvious reasons, not much plot.&quot;

<text>The West Herzegovina Canton () is one of the cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The West Herzegovina Canton is in the Herzegovina region in the southwest of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Its seat of government is in Široki Brijeg, while other municipalities within the Canton are Grude, Ljubuški and Posušje. It has 94,898 inhabitants, of whom more than 98% are ethnic Croats. Economically, it is the most developed part of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

==History==

The majority of the present-day West Herzegovina Canton was part of Zachlumia, the medieval South Slavic principality. In the 15th century, it became part of the Duchy of Saint Sava under Stjepan Vukčić Kosača, who proclaimed himself the herzog (duke), thus giving the name for the whole region - Herzegovina. The Ottomans conquered Herzegovina in 1483 when the territory of the West Herzegovina Canton became part of the Sanjak of Herzegovina. In 1833 the Sanjak of Herzegovina became more autonomous under Ali-paša Rizvanbegović, who became pasha of the Herzegovina Eyalet, however, after his death, Herzegovina once again became a sanjak. In 1878 the whole territory was occupied and later in 1908 annexed by the Austria-Hungary, who held it until 1918. During that time, the territory of the West Herzegovina Canton was part of the District of Mostar in the Condominium of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

After the collapse of Austria-Hungary and after the creation of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the territory of the West Herzegovina Canton remained part of the District of Mostar. However, with the creation of banovinas in 1929, the territory became part of the Littoral Banovina, and in 1939 it was incorporated in the Banovina of Croatia, where it &quot;de iure&quot; remained until 1943.

During World War II, the territory of the West Herzegovina Canton became part of the Independent State of Croatia, a Nazi-affiliated puppet state created in April 1941. Administratively, it was part of the County of Hum, having Mostar as its capital. The puppet state collapsed in May 1945.

The Yugoslav Partisans formed the People&#x27;s Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (later renamed to Socialist Republic), as a federal unit of Yugoslavia, of which the territory of the West Herzegovina Canton became part as well. However, in the process of the collapse of the communist regime, ethnic Croats formed the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia, which encompassed all Croat-majority municipalities in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including those of the West Herzegovina Canton.

During the Bosnian War, the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia was later proclaimed a republic in 1993. The following year, in 1994, it became part of the Croat-Bosniak Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which led to the formation of ten cantons in June 1996, including the West Herzegovina Canton.

==Geography==
West Herzegovina Canton is located in the Herzegovina region of southwest Bosnia and Herzegovina. It has Čvrsnica mountain to the north, Croatia to the west and south, and the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton to the east. The area of the canton is .

The canton has three rivers: Lištica, Trebižat and Ričina, and the Blidinje Lake. Its highest peak is Pločno on the Čvrsnica mountain, 2,228 metres.

The canton is a very mountainous area especially in Posušje (where it also becomes mountainous) and the northern parts of Široki Brijeg. The region is interlaced with karst fields with which the mountains of western and northern Herzegovina descend to the sea. Dugo polje (1150–1250 m) is the first step, followed by Rakitno polje (870–910 m), Posuško polje (580–610 m), Bekijsko polje (260–300 m), Mostarsko Blato (220 m) and Ljubuško polje (80–100 m) with which the descent ends. The rivers Lištica and Tihaljina flow through western Herzegovina, Ričina sometimes flows through the Posusje field and Ugrovača through the Kočerin field. The territory as a whole belongs to the Neretva basin or the Adriatic Sea.

There is also a significant difference between the sub-Mediterranean climate in Posušje and the sub-Mediterranean climate in Široki Brijeg and Grude. In Posušje, mountain and Mediterranean influences collide, so the sub-Mediterranean climate in Posušje is harsher and closer to the temperate mountain climate prevailing in the area of Tribistovo, Radovnje, etc. Summers in western Herzegovina are hot and temperatures exceed 35 degrees. In winter, snow is also not impossible in Ljubuški, but it is more frequent and common in the northernmost towns, especially in Posušje, where it sometimes falls profusely and remains for a long time.

However, by a decision of the Constitutional Court, the constitutional provisions on cantonal symbols were marked as unconstitutional in 1998. Acting on the court&#x27;s decision, the Cantonal Assembly removed the disputed provisions in 2000 and adopted a new law on the flag and coat of arms in 2003 that restored the same symbols.

<text>This article discusses the Polish order of battle during the [[invasion of Poland]]. In the late 1930s Polish headquarters prepared &quot;Plan Zachód&quot; (&quot;Plan &quot;West&quot;), a plan of mobilization of Polish Army in case of war with Germany. Earlier, the Poles did not regard the Germans as their main threat, priority was given to threat from the Soviets (see: Plan East).

The overall operational plan assumed the creation of thirty infantry divisions, nine reserve divisions, eleven cavalry brigades, two motorized brigades, three mountain brigades and a number of smaller units. Most Polish forces were grouped into six armies and a number of corps-sized &quot;Operational Groups&quot;. Later in the course of the war other operational units were created.

==Armies==

=== Karpaty Army ===
Created on July 11, 1939, under Major General Kazimierz Fabrycy. &quot;Armia Karpaty&quot; was created after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia and created a puppet state of Slovakia. The main aim of the army was to secure mountain passes in the Carpathians. Initially the army consisted of 2 improvised mountain brigades and a number of smaller units, but later in the course of war was joined by forces of the withdrawing &quot;Armia Kraków&quot;.

* 2nd Mountain Brigade (&quot;2 Brygada Górska&quot;), made of National Defence units from Limanowa, Gorlice and Nowy Sącz, as well as Border Defence Corps units from Volhynia,

However, because of mistakes committed by Gen. Rómmel, the army was located too close to the German border and joined fighting from the very beginning of the campaign, which deprived it of any possibilities of cooperation with the surrounding units. It consisted of 4 infantry divisions and 2 cavalry brigades.

<text>Uroplatus phantasticus, the satanic leaf-tailed gecko, eyelash leaf-tailed gecko or the phantastic leaf-tailed gecko, is a species of gecko indigenous to the island of Madagascar. First described in 1888 by George Albert Boulenger, &quot;U. phantasticus&quot; is the smallest in body of the &quot;Uroplatus&quot; geckos, though there is an ongoing debate as to whether one of its cousins, &quot;U. ebenaui&quot;, is smaller because of its shorter tail. 

==Etymology==
The generic name, &quot;Uroplatus&quot;, is a Latinization of two Greek words: &quot;ourá&quot; (οὐρά) meaning &quot;tail&quot; and &quot;platys&quot; (πλατύς) meaning &quot;flat&quot;. Its specific name &quot;phantasticus&quot; is the Latin word for &quot;imaginary&quot;, based upon the gecko&#x27;s unique appearance, which led Belgian naturalist George Albert Boulenger to describe it as “mythical” in 1888.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species is endemic to Madagascar, meaning it is found nowhere else. It is an arboreal animal that relies on its natural camouflage in the northern and central tropical forests of Madagascar.

==Description==
Its adult size is up to 90mm in total length, including the tail. 

As with all &quot;Uroplatus&quot; geckos the tail is flattened, but the leaf-like appearance is only seen in the &quot;ebenaui&quot; complex (&quot;U. phantasticus&quot;, &quot;U. ebenaui&quot;, and &quot;U. malama&quot;; although the tail size is much reduced in &quot;U. ebenaui&quot;). It has often been debated whether &quot;U. phantasticus&quot; is in fact the same species as &quot;U. ebenaui&quot; (the Nosy Bé flat-tailed gecko). However &quot;U. phantasticus&quot; possesses more, and longer, spines on the head, body and trunk. Other members of the genus &quot;Uroplatus&quot; have flattened tails that serve more to diminish the profile of the gecko while it is inactive. Some &quot;U. phantasticus&quot; geckos even have notches in their tails to further mimic a decaying leaf. This is also thought to be a form of sexual dimorphism, as the trait seems more common in the males of the species. In addition, &quot;U. phantasticus&quot; has an eyelash-like projection above each eye. During daylight hours, these adaptations help the gecko blend into its surroundings. At night it helps the gecko hunt for prey by providing camouflage.

Geckos possess no eyelids, just a transparent covering over their eyes, and so they use their long, mobile tongues to wipe away any dust or debris that gets into the eye.

The gecko occurs in a variety of colors, including hues of purple, orange, tan and yellow, but is often mottled brown, with small black dots on the underside that help to distinguish it from similar species.

==Behavior==

A nocturnal reptile, with suitably large eyes, the leaf-tailed gecko moves about its rainforest habitat at night feeding on insects. The adhesive scales under their fingers and toes and their strong curved claws enable them to move adeptly through the trees. The leaf-tailed gecko is somewhat of an expert at avoiding predators, not only through their incredible mimicry but through a number of behaviours. They can flatten their body against the substrate to reduce the body&#x27;s shadow, open their jaws wide to show a frightening, bright red mouth, and voluntarily shed their tail in order to trick a predator.

Like many reptiles, the leaf-tailed gecko is oviparous, or egg-laying. Reproduction starts at the beginning of the rainy season when it lays clutches of two spherical eggs onto the ground under leaf litter or in the dead leaves of plants.

==Captivity==
&quot;Uroplatus phantasticus&quot; is common in captivity and often kept in breeding pairs or trios. Males can be housed together as intraspecific aggression tends to be low when captive conditions are sufficient. However, even in good circumstances, there is occasional male-male aggression. Keepers of this species often simply refer to them as &quot;Phants&quot;.

The gecko eats a variety of appropriately sized insects including crickets and moths. If breeding is successful in captivity, eggs will be laid at intervals of approximately 30 days and take 90 to 120 days to hatch.

There are seven zoos in the United States that have this gecko, two of which breed it, including the San Diego Zoo.

==Conservation==
Habitat destruction, deforestation, and collection for the pet trade all threaten the existence of this species. Studies suggest that leaf-tailed geckos can only inhabit a very specific environment and are not tolerant of any degradation of their natural habitat. This makes them vulnerable to the impacts of habitat degradation and harvesting, a common problem due to it being popular pets. The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) lists all of the &quot;Uroplatus&quot; species on their &quot;Top ten most wanted species list&quot; of animals threatened by illegal wildlife trade, because of it &quot;being captured and sold at alarming rates for the international pet trade&quot;. It is a CITES Appendix 2 protected animal.

Protected areas are therefore essential, and at present, the satanic leaf-tailed gecko is known to occur in at least three: Tsaratanana Strict Nature Reserve, Marojejy National Park, and Anjanaharibe Special Reserve. However, illegal harvesting of leaf-tailed geckos is known to occur even within protected areas, and efforts to control this threatening activity are required if this extraordinary and unique reptile is to endure. This gecko is not a prey of birds, as commonly thought.

<text>Geographic profiling is a criminal investigative methodology that analyzes the locations of a connected series of crimes to determine the most probable area of offender residence. By incorporating both qualitative and quantitative methods, it assists in understanding spatial behaviour of an offender and focusing the investigation to a smaller area of the community. Typically used in cases of serial murder or rape (but also arson, bombing, robbery, terrorism and other crimes), the technique helps police detectives prioritize information in large-scale major crime investigations that often involve hundreds or thousands of suspects and tips.

In addition to determining the offender&#x27;s most likely area of residence, an understanding of the spatial pattern of a crime series and the characteristics of the crime sites can tell investigators other useful information, such as whether the crime was opportunistic and the degree of offender familiarity with the crime location. This is based on the connection between an offender&#x27;s behavior and his or her non-criminal life.

Geographic profiling is growing in popularity and, combined with offender profiling, can be a helpful tool in the investigation of serial crime.

== Development ==
While the use of spatial analysis methods in police investigations goes back many years (e.g. detectives gathered around a large city map with pins stuck in it), the formalized process known today as geographic profiling originated out of research conducted at Simon Fraser University&#x27;s School of Criminology in British Columbia, Canada, in 1989.

Geographic profiling is based on the assumption that offenders tend to select victims and commit crimes near their homes. The technique has now spread to several US, Canadian, British, and other European law enforcement agencies. Originally designed for violent crime investigations, it is increasingly being used on property crime.

Through numerous research studies, more importance has been placed on the journeys offenders habitually make to determine the spatial range of criminal activity. Because of their familiarity, these areas become a comfort zone within which offenders prefer to commit crimes. Consequently, criminal acts follow a distance-decay function, whereby people are more likely to commit offences near their homes. An exception to this is a buffer zone around offenders&#x27; homes, within which they avoid committing crimes in case they are identified by a neighbour.

=== Central concepts === 

The theoretical foundation of geographic profiling is in environmental criminology. Key concepts include:
*Journey-to-crime
:Supports the notion that crimes are likely to occur closer to an offender’s home and follow a distance-decay function (DDF) with crimes less likely to occur the further away an offender is from their home base. It is concerned with the ‘distance of crime’ and that offenders will in general travel limited distances to commit their crimes. 
*Routine activity theory
:Originally developed by Cohen and Felson (1979), the primary principle is that the offender and victim must intersect in time and space for a crime to occur. This approach focuses on the concept that crime occurs when an opportunity is taken within both parties’ non-criminal spatial activity. An activity space may consist of the regular areas an offender travels such as work, school, home or recreational areas. 
*Rational choice theory
:Concepts relating to the explanation of spatial behaviour include the least-effort principle where offenders are more likely to act on the first or opportunity and the idea of a buffer zone. It exhibits a constant tension between the offender’s desire to divert attention from his home base and the desire to travel no further than necessary to commit crimes. 
*Crime pattern theory
:Developed by Canadian environmental criminologists Paul and Patricia Brantingham, the theory exerts the strongest influence in geographic profiling. It suggests that crime sites and opportunities are not random. There is an emphasis in the interaction between the offender’s mental map of spatial surroundings and the allotment of victims (target backcloth).

Serial crimes are the easiest to develop geographic profiles for, since each crime contains new spatial information and provides additional data including the fact that the crime area tends to enlarge with an increase of comfort and confidence. The initial hunt and criminal acts are likely to occur close to the offender&#x27;s home or workplace. As the success rate increases, the criminal&#x27;s growing confidence will lead him/her to seek his prey further from home. Crimes that are suitable for analysis are those that are predatory and involve some spatial decision-making process such as the area for hunting targets, travel routes, mode of transportation and even body dump sites.

Another leading researcher in this area is David Canter whose approach to geographic profiling is based on the circle theory of environmental range. In 1993, Canter and Larkin developed two models of offender behaviour: the marauder and commuter models. The distinction is that marauders operate close to the offender&#x27;s home while commuters commit crimes far outside the habitual zone. It hopes to differentiate the two types of serial offenders by studying the relationship of the criminal spatial behaviour with the offender&#x27;s place of residence.

==Considerations==
In developing a geographic profile, there are important factors to consider:
*Crime locations
A crime will contain evidence. The evidence found at the location provides information leading to the offender and victim&#x27;s prior location, clues as to where they may have gone, as well as information depicting what happened. Collecting and comparing clues from numerous crime locations influences the development of the offender&#x27;s patterns.
*Offender type
According to Dr. Kim Rossmo there are four different types of offenders with regard to geographic profiling. 
Hunter: the hunter singles out a specific victim without leaving his home territory. He will commit crimes where he lives. 
Poacher: a poacher will travel out of his home territory to do his hunting. 
Troller: A troller will realize an opportunistic encounter while occupied in other activities and then strike. 
Trapper: a trapper will draw the victim into him using different seemingly harmless situations. 
*Hunting Methods
Hunting process can be broken down into two parts. (1) The search for a suitable victim, and (2) the method of attack. 
*Target backcloth (the spatial opportunity structure of crime sites)
“Target or victim backcloth is important for an understanding of the geometric arrangement of crime sites; it is the equivalent of the spatial opportunity structure (Brantingham &amp; Brantingham, 1993b). It is configured by both geographic and temporal distribution of “suitable” (as seen from the offenders perspective) crime targets or victims across the physical landscape. The availability of particular targets may vary significantly according to neighborhood, area, or even city, and is influenced by time, day of week, and season; hence, the term structural backcloth is also used.”
*Arterial roads and highways 
Large roads and highways play a huge part in crime strictly because it how both criminals and victims are forced to travel. Crimes will often cluster around freeway exits and entrances.
*Bus stops and train stations
These are two forms of rapid transportation that may also be used by offenders and victims and can be hot spots in certain areas. 
*Physical and psychological boundaries
Offender and victim alike are both restrained by physical boundaries such as rivers, lakes, oceans or highways. Psychological boundaries may also affect movement, for example a black offender may not travel into a white neighborhood for fear or being identified. 
*Land use
*Neighbourhood demographics
Certain offenders prefer a certain ethnicity of victim, if so then he may hunt in different neighborhoods affecting spatial crime patterns. 
*Routine activities of victims
Understanding the routine of a victim may provide insight into how the offender searches for his victims. 
*Singularities
*Displacement

Incorporating these factors in a profile can lead to a geographic pattern where it sheds light on an offender&#x27;s mobility, method of transportation, ability to navigate boundaries and most importantly, the possible residential location. It is important to recognize such spatial intentionality, to determine the offender&#x27;s comfort zone and their desire to commit crimes in locations where they feel a sense of familiarity. However, the reality may be more complex since an offender may have multiple spatial anchor points, such as home, workplace or the residence of their significant other.

==Tools==
Geographic profiling is an investigative tool that can be seen as a strategic information management system to assist police with the large volume of information throughout an investigation. It concentrates its focus on the geographic aspects of the crime and was developed in response to the demands of solving serial crimes. In response, Rossmo developed a computerized geographic profiling algorithm called criminal geographic targeting (CGT) which assess the spatial characteristics of crimes. It analyzes the geographic coordinates of the offender&#x27;s crimes and produces a color map which assigns probabilities to different points for the most likely area of the offender&#x27;s home base. CGT has been patented and integrated into a specialized crime analysis software product called Rigel. The Rigel product is developed by the software company Environmental Criminology Research Inc. (ECRI), which Rossmo co-founded.

Geographic Profilers often employ tools such as Rigel, CrimeStat or Gemini to perform geographic analysis. System inputs are crime location addresses or coordinates, often entered through a geographic information system (GIS). Output is a jeopardy surface (three-dimensional probability surface) or color geoprofile, which depicts the most likely areas of offender residence or search base. These programs assist crime analysts and investigators to focus their resources more effectively by highlighting the crucial geographic areas.

==Geographic Profiling Analysis (GPA) training==
Geographic profiling is a sub-type of offender or criminal profiling (the inference of offender characteristics from offence characteristics). It is therefore related to psychological or behavioral profiling. If psychological profiling is the &quot;who,&quot; geographic profiling is the &quot;where.&quot; All certified geographic profilers are members of the International Criminal Investigative Analysis Fellowship (ICIAF), a professional profiling organization first begun by investigators trained by the FBI in the mid-1980s.

A Geographic Profiling Analysis (GPA) training programme has also been created and is governed by the Committee for GPA Training and Certification (CGPATC). The program has been designed so that geographic profiling analysis remains a recognized law enforcement tool; a meaningful certification for crime analysts and detectives; a standard of quality through adequate qualifications in law enforcements is maintained; and finally to establish an ethical code of conduct.

==Limitations==
Although geographic profiling is a useful tool for assisting investigations, e.g. in prioritizing suspects, like any other models there are certain limitations:
*Benefit in the case of a single crime may be limited.
*It may be most useful against impulsive crimes by impulsive offenders.
*It may not distinguish between multiple offenders operating in the same area and following similar modi operandi.
*Although computer systems can be highly sophisticated, they cannot analyze all the information involved in a crime series and they are only as good as the accuracy of their algorithms&#x27; underlying assumptions.
*In crimes against lucrative targets the residential location of the perpetrator may be of small significance compared to the location of the target.

<doc id="845817" wikidata="Q164242" url="?curid=845817" title="Movement for Rights and Freedoms">
<text>The Movement for Rights and Freedoms ( &quot;Dvizhenie za prava i svobodi&quot;, ДПС, DPS; , HÖH) is a centrist political party in Bulgaria with a support base among ethnic minority communities. Until 2024 it was a member of the Liberal International and the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe (ALDE). While representing the interests of Muslims, especially Turks and to a lesser extent Pomaks (Muslim Bulgarians), the party also receives the largest share of Romani votes.

==History==

The party was officially established in 1990, with its founder Ahmed Dogan serving as its leader until 2013. On 19 January 2013, Lyutfi Mestan was elected as the second chairman of the Movement for Rights and Freedoms. Mestan was removed from power by the insistence of Dogan for declaring support for Turkey for shooting down a Russian military jet in 2015. This led Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan to blacklist Ahmed Dogan and ban him from entering Turkey. Mestan formed his own party, named Democrats for Responsibility, Solidarity and Tolerance.

Following a leadership dispute prior to the October 2024 elections, party members split into two separate electoral coalitions: Alliance for Rights and Freedoms (loyalists to Ahmed Dogan), and DPS – A New Beginning (led by Delyan Peevski). After the faction led by Peevski was recognized to be the legitimate DPS by the Supreme Administrative Court of Bulgaria, the faction led by Dogan split, changed their name and registered without claiming DPS to be a member of the alliance. Peevski has since become the sole chairman of the DPS and removed Dogan as the honorary president.

==Election results==

Starting in 1990 as the first political party of the Turkish minority participating in the parliamentary elections, in the first elections in 1990 after the end of the communist regime, which the Turks of the country had boycotted, the party won 6.0% of the popular vote and 24 out of 400 seats and became the fourth largest party in the parliament. In the parliamentary elections in 1991 it won 7.6% of the vote and remained with 24 seats in а 240-seater parliament. In the elections in 1994 it won 5.4% of the vote and its seats decreased to 15. In the elections in 1997 it won 7.6% of the vote and 19 out of 240 seats. From 2001 to 2009, the party was part of the government, first in a coalition with the National Movement Simeon II (NDSV) party and then with the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP). The party had ministers in the Sakskoburggotski Government, Stanishev Government and Oresharski Government (2013-2014).

It won in the elections in 2001 7.5% of the vote and 21 out of 240 seats. Subsequently, for the first time the party joined a coalition government, which was led by the winner of the elections (NDSV). Under the control of the party were two out of the 17 Bulgarian ministries – the Ministry of Agriculture and Forests and the Minister without portfolio, the other 15 remained under the control of senior coalition partner NDSV. At the 2005 elections it increased to 12.8% of vote and 34 out of 240 seats and was kept in power as a part of the coalition led by the Bulgarian Socialist Party (BSP) and National Movement Simeon II (NDSV) party. The ministries under the control of the Movement of Rights and Freedoms increased to three out of 18.

At the 2009 elections it increased to 14.0% of vote and 38 out of 240 seats. Following the election, the government was totally occupied by the decisive winner, the Citizens for European Development of Bulgaria (GERB) party and the Movement for Rights and Freedoms was еxcluded from the government and remained in opposition after having been part of coalition governments for the two consecutive preceding terms between 2001 and 2009. At the 2009 European Parliament elections the party won 14.1% of the vote and three MEPs out of Bulgaria&#x27;s total representation of 18. Two of the MEPs are ethnic Turks (Filiz Husmenova and Metin Kazak) and one (Vladko Panayotov) is ethnic Bulgarian.

In the Bulgarian parliamentary election in 2013, the Movement for Rights and Freedoms decreased to 11.3% of the vote; it took 36 seats and remained the third biggest party. The DPS won the elections abroad with 41.3% and the most polling stations and voters in a foreign country were in Turkey.

The DPS won four MEPs in the 2014 European Parliament elections.

===National Assembly===


===European Parliament===
==Controversies==

===Ethnic nature===

On 8 October 1991, ninety-three members of Bulgaria&#x27;s National Assembly — virtually all of them affiliated with the former Communist Party — asked the constitutional court to declare the DPS unconstitutional citing article 11.4 of the constitution which explicitly bans political parties &quot;formed on ethnic, racial, and religious basis&quot;. On 21 April 1992, the court rejected the petition and affirmed the constitutionality of the DPS.

Even though the DPS has been legally a part of Bulgarian political life since then, some Bulgarian nationalists, particularly the far-right National Union Attack, continue to assert that it is anti-constitutional because it consists mainly of ethnic Turks. However, the statute of the DPS states that it &quot;is an independent public and political organization, founded with the purpose of contributing to the unity of all Bulgarian citizens&quot;.

Additionally, supporters of DPS argue that banning parties on the basis of their ethnic composition constitutes an instance of ethnic discrimination and is in contravention to European law, the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in particular to which Bulgaria is a signatory. Furthermore, despite a similar constitutional ban, religious parties, such as the Bulgarian Christian Coalition have competed for parliamentary elections since 1997, and again in 2005, without any political upheaval.

More recently, Antonina Zheliazkova, head of the Centre for Interethnic Relations in Sofia, praised Ahmed Dogan by stating that &quot;He has been working hard to open up the party to all citizens and has encouraged the DPS&#x27;s supporters to be free to vote for non-ethnic parties&quot;.

===Other Turkish political factions===
At present there are three other tiny Turkish political factions that oppose the DPS&#x27;s politics. These groups — which united to form the Balkan Democratic League — are the Movement of the Democratic Wing (DDK), led by Osman Oktay; the Party for Democracy and Justice (PDS), led by Nedim Gencev; and the Union of the Bulgarian Turks (SBT), led by Seyhan Türkkan.

However, these movements, as well as the National Movement for Rights and Freedoms, member of a Social-Democratic coalition (&#x27;Rose coalition&#x27;) failed to secure any elected representative in the parliament. A party founded in 2011 by members who left the party and headed by Korman Ismailov—People&#x27;s Party Freedom and Dignity, gained 1.5% of the vote in a coalition with National Movement Simeon II (NDSV) and therefore did not cross the 4% threshold to enter the parliament. This party was part of the Reformist Bloc and crossed the threshold and entered the parliament and the government in 2014, but only with one Deputy Minister that was removed. Another political fraction DOST founded by the former leader Mestan, had 17,000 registered members in 2016, which were obtained only for about one year. If so, the members of the Movement of Rights and Freedoms must have dropped in numbers.

===Alleged manipulation of votes===

The DPS was severely criticized by the Bulgarian ultra-nationalist party Attack as well as mainstream right-wing political parties such as Democrats for a Strong Bulgaria (DSB) and the Union of Democratic Forces (SDS) and even by DPS coalition partners of the National Movement Simeon II for allegedly manipulating the vote in the June 2005 elections in some places by bringing Bulgarian citizens of Turkish origin living in Turkey to vote in the elections. However, allegations of ethnic Turks coming to vote in Bulgaria at their permanent address and then returning to Turkey to vote with their passports, could not be &quot;verified or confirmed&quot; by international observers, whose assessment on the election was that it was free and fair.

===Opposing privatization on ethnic grounds===
In February 2005, the DPS opposed the privatisation of Bulgaria&#x27;s largest tobacco company, Bulgartabac, which was backed by the government and the European Union, on the grounds that the industry traditionally employs ethnic Turks. The resulting crisis led to the resignation of vice premier Lydia Shouleva.

=== Delyan Peevski ===

Delyan Peevski is &quot;a highly controversial figure in Bulgarian politics, business and media.&quot; He has served several terms of office in Bulgaria&#x27;s Parliament as a DPS MP. He was placed under US sanctions for corruption through the Magnitsky Act mechanism in May 2021. He even served as head of the Bulgarian State Agency for National Security for one day, &quot;but after mass protests broke out in the streets was forced to hand in his resignation.&quot;
Peevski served as MP from the parliamentary group of the DPS in the 41st, 42nd, 43r, 44th, 47th and 48th National Assembly of Bulgaria and is currently serving as MP in the 49th National Assembly, where his legislative efforts are focused mainly on the judicial reform, Bulgaria&#x27;s support for Ukraine and enforcement of the EU sanctions against Russia. On October 16, 2023, he became co-chairperson of the Parliamentary Group of DPS.

== European representation ==
In the European Parliament, Movement for Rights and Freedoms sits in the Renew Europe group with three MEPs.

In the European Committee of the Regions, Movement for Rights and Freedoms sits in the Renew Europe CoR group with two full and two alternate members for the 2020-2025 mandate. Nedzhmi Ali is member of the Renew Europe CoR Bureau.

<text>In baseball, an out occurs when the umpire rules a batter or baserunner out. When a batter or runner is out, they lose their ability to score a run and must return to the dugout until their next turn at bat. When three outs are recorded in a half-inning, the batting team&#x27;s turn expires.

To signal an out, an umpire generally makes a fist with one hand, and then flexes that arm either upward, particularly on pop flies, or forward, particularly on routine plays at first base. Home plate umpires often use a &quot;punch-out&quot; motion to signal a called strikeout.

==Ways of making outs==
* The most common ways batters or runners are put out are when:
** The batter strikes out (they make three batting mistakes, known as &quot;strikes&quot;, without hitting the ball into fair territory); 
** The batter flies out (they hit the ball and it is caught before landing);
*** A baserunner fails to return to their time-of-pitch base after a flyout occurs and a fielder with the ball touches the base;
** a baserunner is tagged out (they are touched by the ball, held in an opponent&#x27;s hand, while not on a base);
** a baserunner is forced out (an opponent with the ball reaches the base the runner is forced to advance to before the runner does).
* The batter is out when:
** Strikeout-related outs:
*** with two strikes, the batter swings at a pitched ball and misses;
*** with two strikes, they do not swing at a pitch that the umpire judges to be in the strike zone (and the catcher catches the ball and does not drop it);
*** with two strikes, the batter foul tips a pitch directly back into the catcher&#x27;s mitt, and the catcher holds the ball and does not drop it;
*** with two strikes, they bunt a pitch into foul territory;
*** the third strike is pitched and caught in flight;
*** on any third strike, if a baserunner is on first and there are fewer than two outs (even when not caught);
** Outs related to the batter&#x27;s box:
*** they are hit by their own fair ball, outside the batter&#x27;s box, before the ball is played by a fielder;
*** they hit a pitch while one foot is entirely outside the batter&#x27;s box;
*** they step from one batter&#x27;s box to the other when the pitcher is ready to pitch;
** Other ways of being out:
*** they commit interference;
*** they fail to bat in their proper turn and is discovered in an appeal; or
*** they are found to have used an altered bat.
* Ways that runners can be out:
** The batter-runner is out when:
*** a preceding runner interferes with a fielder trying to complete a double play on the batter-runner;
*** Tag-related outs:
**** a fielder with a live ball in their possession touches first base or tags the batter-runner before the batter-runner reaches first base (except when the batter is awarded first base, such as on a base on balls)
**** the batter-runner does not return directly to first base after overrunning the bag and they are tagged with the ball by a fielder.
*** Flyout-related outs:
**** a batted ball is caught in flight (fly out); 
**** they hit an infield popup while the infield fly rule applies;
**** a fielder intentionally drops a line drive with fewer than two outs in a force situation (man on first, men on first and second, men on first and third, bases loaded) in an attempt to create a double play;
** Any baserunner, other than the batter-runner, is out when:
*** they are forced out; that is, they fail to reach their force base before a fielder with a live ball touches that base;
*** a fielder catches a batted ball in flight, and subsequently, some fielder with a live ball in possession touches the runner&#x27;s time of pitch base before the runner returns to it (appeal play);
*** while they are attempting to reach home plate with fewer than two outs, the batter interferes with a fielder and such action hinders a potential tag out near home plate;
*** they are found to have committed a mockery of the game, for example, a stolen base of first from the second; or
*** they are found to be an illegal substitute.
** Any baserunner, including the batter-runner, is out when:
*** they are tagged out; that is, touched by a fielder&#x27;s hand holding a live ball while in jeopardy, such as while not touching a base;
*** they stray more than three feet (0.9 meters) from their running baseline in attempting to avoid a tag;
*** they pass a base without touching it and a member of the defensive team properly executes a live ball appeal;
*** they pass a preceding runner who is not out;
*** they commit interference, such as when they contact a fielder playing a batted ball, or when they contact a live batted ball before it passes a fielder other than the pitcher;
*** they are touched by a fair ball in fair territory before the ball has touched or passed an infielder. The ball is dead and no runner may score, nor runners advance, except runners forced to advance. EXCEPTION: If a runner is touching their base when touched by an infield fly, they are not out, although the batter is out;
*** they intentionally abandon their effort to run the bases after touching first base; or
*** they run the bases in reverse order in an attempt to confuse the defence or to make a travesty of the game.
Note: When a fielder makes a putout, they must maintain secure possession of the ball. The general exception is when a fielder loses possession of the ball because they attempt to throw it immediately after making the out.

==Crediting outs==
In baseball statistics, each out must be credited to exactly one defensive player, namely the player who was the direct cause of the out. When referring to outs credited to a defensive player, the term putout is used. Example: a batter hits a fair ball that is fielded by the shortstop. The shortstop then throws the ball to the first baseman. The first baseman then steps on first base before the batter reaches it. For this play, only the first baseman is credited with a putout, while the shortstop is credited with an assist. For a strikeout, the catcher is credited with a putout, because the batter is not out until the pitched ball is caught by the catcher. (If the catcher drops the third strike and has to throw the batter-runner out at the first base, the first baseman receives the putout while the catcher receives an assist.) When an out is recorded without a fielder&#x27;s direct involvement, such as where a runner is hit by a batted ball, the fielder nearest to the action is usually credited with the putout.

Although pitchers seldom get credited with putouts, they are credited with their role in getting outs through various pitching statistics such as innings pitched (a measure of the number of outs made by the pitcher, used in calculating their ERA) and strikeouts.

==Outs that occur in specific situations==

Certain terms are sometimes used to better describe the circumstances under which an out occurred. 

For strike outs: 

* A strike out looking means that a third strike was called because the ball was in the strike zone 
* A strikeout swinging refers to a swinging third strike. 

For force outs and/or tag outs (outs that retire runners):
* Throw out: refers to when a throw is made to a fielder covering a base, who then uses the ball to put out a runner coming to that base. 
* Ground out: when the batter hits a ground ball that leads to them being thrown out. 

For fly outs:
* Pop out: When the batter hits a pop up (a fly ball that goes high but not far) and it is caught. 
* Line out: A line drive that is caught. 
* Foul out: A foul fly ball that is caught.

<doc id="845828" wikidata="Q1669673" url="?curid=845828" title="Rally of the Republicans">
<text>The Rally of the Republicans (; abbreviated RDR) is a liberal party in Ivory Coast (). The party is the country&#x27;s governing party; the party&#x27;s leader, Alassane Ouattara, is the current President of Ivory Coast.

==History==
The RDR, which has most of its support in the north of the country, was formed as a liberal offshoot of the ruling party, the Democratic Party of Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (PDCI), in mid-1994. Djéni Kobina became the new party&#x27;s Secretary-General. The RDR sought for Ouattara, who had served as Prime Minister from 1990 to 1993, to become its candidate in the 1995 presidential election. However, amendments to the electoral code required presidential candidates to have lived in the country for five years and to have been born of Ivorian parents. It was thought that these provisions were specifically intended to keep Ouattara out of the running; he had been deputy managing director of the International Monetary Fund for almost five years and his father&#x27;s family had roots in Burkina Faso. For this reason the RDR boycotted the election.

The RDR held its first ordinary congress on July 2–3, 1995, at which Ouattara was nominated as its presidential candidate. Following Kobina&#x27;s death, the party held its first extraordinary congress in January 1999 to elect a new Secretary-General. Ouattara was elected President of the RDR on August 1, 1999 at the second extraordinary congress of the party, and he was designated as the party&#x27;s candidate for the next presidential election.

Ouattara said that he was eligible to stand in this election, scheduled to be held in 2000, pointing to documents which he said demonstrated that he and his parents were of Ivorian birth, as required by the electoral code. He was accused of forging these papers, however, and an investigation was begun. His nationality certificate was annulled by a court in October 1999 and an arrest warrant for Ouattara was issued a month later, although he was in France at the time.

The RDR demonstrated in favor of Ouattara&#x27;s candidacy; a demonstration in Abidjan reported as being 10,000 strong was held on September 27. A number of RDR leaders, including the party&#x27;s Secretary-General, Henriette Diabate, were arrested on October 27 on the grounds that they were responsible for violence occurring during protests they organized; in November, they were convicted and sentenced to prison. When soldiers rebelled on December 23, 1999, one of their demands was the release of the imprisoned RDR leaders; when President Henri Konan Bédié rejected the demands, they seized power on December 24 and promptly released the RDR prisoners. Ouattara returned to Ivory Coast on December 29, hailing Bédié&#x27;s ouster as a &quot;revolution supported by all the Ivorian people&quot;.

Despite Ouattara&#x27;s support for the coup, his candidacy in the October 2000 presidential election was rejected by the Supreme Court, on the same nationality basis that was used to prevent his candidacy during Bédié&#x27;s presidency. As a result, the RDR decided to boycott the presidential election. It also boycotted the parliamentary election held on 10 December 2000 and 14 January 2001, but nevertheless won five out of 225 seats. The RDR is a full member of the Liberal International, which it joined at the Liberal International&#x27;s Dakar Congress in 2003.

On May 18, 2005, despite their history of hostility, the RDR and the PDCI signed an agreement to form a coalition, the Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace, along with two smaller parties, the Union for Democracy and Peace in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (UDPCI) and the Movement of the Forces of the Future (MFA), ahead of the presidential election then planned for October 2005.

Ouattara was designated as the RDR&#x27;s presidential candidate at its Second Ordinary Congress on February 1–3, 2008 and also re-elected as President of the RDR for another five years. At the congress, he invited the former rebel Forces Nouvelles de Côte d&#x27;Ivoire (New Forces) to team up with the RDR for the election.

In the first round of the 2010 presidential elections, Ouattara finished second, behind incumbent Laurent Gbagbo. In the runoff, Ouattara was announced as finishing first with 54 percent of the vote—a result recognized by virtually the entire international community. Gbagbo, however, refused to step down, touching off a major political crisis that only ended with Gbagbo&#x27;s capture on 11 April 2011.

Between 2012 and 2016, the RDR&#x27;s Fadika Sarra Sako served as vice-president of the National Assembly.

At the RDR&#x27;s Third Ordinary Congress on 9–10 September 2017, it was expected that Ouattara would be elected as President of the RDR, but he instead proposed Henriette Diabaté for the post, and she was duly elected by acclamation. Kandia Camara was designated as Secretary-General and Amadou Gon Coulibaly as First Vice-t. In 2020, Célestine Olibé Trazéré left the RDR for the Rally of Houphouëtists for Democracy and Peace.

==Congress of Republican Women==
Aya Virginie Toure was elected President of the Rally of Republican Women with a majority vote of 59%.

<text>Norman Lovett (born 31 October 1946) is a British stand-up comedian and actor best known for his portrayal of Holly, the ship&#x27;s computer in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;.

== Career ==
Lovett became a stand-up comedian in his thirties, initially supporting punk bands in the late 1970s, before establishing himself on the alternative comedy scene during the 1980s. He played London&#x27;s Comedy Store on many occasions.

From 1989 to 1993, Lovett wrote and starred in his own surreal BBC2 sitcom called &quot;I, Lovett&quot;. He played a version of himself who is an inventor living in a world of surrealism with his talking dog, voiced by Geoffrey Hughes; spider, voiced by Mary Riggans; and talking inanimate objects. During this time, he also wrote and starred in a one-off special called &quot;Lovett Goes To Town&quot;, which was aired as part of Galaxy series &quot;The Last Laugh&quot;.

In 1996, Lovett played a doctor in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Asylum&quot;, created by Edgar Wright, alongside Simon Pegg, Jessica Stevenson, Julian Barratt and an ensemble cast. Lovett later worked with Edgar Wright again on &quot;Is It Bill Bailey?&quot;, a stand-up/sketch series starring Bill Bailey.

Lovett&#x27;s first television appearances include a stand-up performance on &quot;Pyjamarama&quot; in 1983, and a brief role in &quot;The Young Ones&quot; in the episode &quot;Summer Holiday&quot;. He appeared again with &quot;The Young Ones&quot; star Rik Mayall in sketches for UK music series &quot;The Tube&quot;, and television act &quot;The Dangerous Brothers&quot;.

Lovett has made a number of other acting appearances such as the Ghost of Christmas Past in a television adaptation of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, Mr. Follett in &quot;The History of Tom Jones&quot;, the film &quot;The Criminal&quot;, BBC docudrama &quot;Seven Wonders of the Industrial World&quot;, as well as the BBC One sitcom &quot;Keeping Up Appearances&quot;. He also appeared in three episodes of drama &quot;The Bill&quot;, three episodes of the Scottish sitcom &quot;Rab C Nesbitt&quot;, an episode of &quot;EastEnders&quot;, comedy drama series &quot;Happy Families&quot;, and children&#x27;s television series &quot;Gordon the Gopher&quot;. He played a supporting role in two series of the television series &quot;Don&#x27;t Miss Wax&quot;, hosted by Ruby Wax.

In 2006, Lovett appeared in the comedy-horror film &quot;Evil Aliens&quot;. In 2013, he featured in the mockumentary feature film &quot;Behind the Scenes of Total Hell&quot;.

Lovett&#x27;s comedy has a quiet, dead-pan surrealism, and in 2000, he made a successful stand-up tour, co-headlining with Chris Barrie, who played Rimmer in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. In 2008 Lovett co-headlined a stand-up tour with Hattie Hayridge, who played the female version of Holly in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. His career as a stand-up comedian has included regular appearances at the Edinburgh Fringe. Comedian Stewart Lee has cited Lovett as an influence, and on occasion the two have featured on the same bill, including an alternative comedy showcase event in 2011, curated by Lee at the Royal Festival Hall. In 2008, Lovett released his first stand-up DVD &quot;Bags and Biscuits&quot;. In 2012, he released his second stand-up DVD, &quot;Norman Lovett: Outside the Box&quot;.

From 2014 to 2018, Lovett was a main cast member in BBC Radio 4 comedy &quot;To Hull and Back&quot;, alongside Maureen Lipman and series creator Lucy Beaumont.

== &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; ==
Lovett played the role of Holly in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; in its first and second series. Starting from the third series, Lovett declined to join the cast when &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; filming moved to London, while Lovett had moved to Edinburgh, with the distance between the two cities decreasing his willingness to participate.

Lovett returned in the seventh series as a guest star and the eighth as a regular. However, a disagreement with writer/producer Doug Naylor meant that for a period Lovett refused to take part in any further &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; productions.

Following the success of &quot;Red Dwarf X&quot;, Lovett resumed contact with Naylor, resulting in his guest appearance in the twelfth series episode &quot;Skipper&quot;. After this, Lovett resumed his role as Holly in the 2020 special &quot;The Promised Land&quot;.

Lovett has also played the role of Holly in &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;-related releases, such as the &quot;Tongue Tied&quot; music video, a sketch for BBC&#x27;s Children in Need, the interactive DVD game &quot;Beat the Geek&quot;, and additional footage filmed for &quot;Red Dwarf Remastered&quot;.

== Other activities ==
Lovett is known for political activism. He has performed stand-up comedy on numerous occasions for &#x27;Stand Up For Labour&#x27; in support of said party. In 2016, he was awarded Stand Up For Labour&#x27;s Act of the Year. In September 2016, Lovett performed at the &#x27;Keep Corbyn&#x27; rally in Brighton, in support of Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.

Lovett&#x27;s voice is available as an in-game purchase in the 2014 game Elite Dangerous, allowing the user to customise the ships &#x27;COVAS&#x27; speech system.

Lovett has stated that one of his personal career highlights was supporting punk rock band The Clash.

<doc id="845832" wikidata="Q512314" url="?curid=845832" title="Socialite">
<text>A socialite is a person, typically a woman from a wealthy or aristocratic background, who is prominent in high society. A socialite generally spends a significant amount of time attending various fashionable social gatherings, instead of having traditional employment.

==Word history==
The word &quot;socialite&quot; is first attested in 1909 in a Tennessee newspaper. It was popularized by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in the 1920s. 

==United Kingdom==
Historically, socialites in the United Kingdom were almost exclusively from the families of the aristocracy and landed gentry. Many socialites also had strong familial or personal relationships to the British royal family.

Between the 17th and early 19th centuries, society events in London and at country houses were the focus of socialite activity. Notable examples of British socialites include Beau Brummell, Lord Alvanley, the Marchioness of Londonderry, Daisy, Princess of Pless, Lady Diana Cooper, Mary Constance Wyndham, Lady Ursula d&#x27;Abo, Margaret Greville and the Mitford sisters. Since the 1960s, socialites have been drawn from a wider section of society more similar to the American model, with many socialites now coming from families in business or from the world of celebrity. Despite this, the notion of the Sloane Ranger still emphasises many socialites&#x27; connections to Britain&#x27;s ruling class. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is widely regarded as the current home of socialite activity in the UK. The television show &quot;Made in Chelsea&quot; has explored the lifestyles of young socialites living in London in the 21st century.

==United States==
American members of the Establishment, or an American &quot;society&quot; based on birth, breeding, education, and economic standing, were originally listed in the &quot;Social Register&quot;, a directory of the names and addresses of the &quot;preferred social contacts&quot; of the prominent families in the 19th century. In 1886, Louis Keller started to consolidate these lists and package them for sale.

===18th and 19th centuries===
The concept of socialites dates to the 18th and 19th century. Most of the earliest socialites were wives or mistresses of royalty or nobility, but being a socialite was more a duty and a means of survival than a form of pleasure. Bashful queens were often forced to play gracious and wealthy hostess to people who despised them. Mistresses had to pay for their social reputation and had to use their social skills to obtain favor in the court and retain the interest of their lovers.

With the increase of wealth in the US in the 19th century, being a socialite developed into a role that brought power and influence.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, the term &quot;socialite&quot; is still attached to being wealthy and socially recognized. The lines between being a socialite and celebrity with an exuberant partying lifestyle have since become blurred due to the influence of both popular culture and the media, particularly when the status of being a celebrity is largely due to that lifestyle. Celebrity Paris Hilton is an example of a 21st-century socialite due to her ability to attract media attention and fame based only on her connections and associations. Hilton is the great-granddaughter of Conrad Hilton, the founder of Hilton Hotels &amp; Resorts, and heiress to the Hilton Hotel fortune. Due to her outrageous lifestyle, Hilton was hailed by the media as &quot;New York&#x27;s leading It Girl&quot; in 2001.

&quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, an American television series airing between September 2007 and December 2012, focuses on the lives of New York City socialites who live on Manhattan&#x27;s Upper East Side. The show is a strong influence on how socialites are regarded in the 21st century because of the presence of scandal, wealth, and fashion in each episode. Pop culture gives the impression that by simply being wealthy and fashionable, an individual has the opportunity to become famous. Consequently, it is an individual&#x27;s ability to climb the social ladder due to his or her wealth and recognition that makes them a socialite.

According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, socialites spend between $98,000 and $455,000 per year (young and old, respectively) to maintain their roles as successful socialites. Just the evening wardrobe of an individual regularly attending society functions can cost $100,000 annually. Examples of modern-day American socialites include: The Kardashian-Jenner family, Jill Kelley, Tinsley Mortimer, EJ Johnson, Olivia Palermo, Lauren Santo Domingo, Paris Hilton, Derek Blasberg, and Jean Shafiroff.

<text>The Constitution of the State of Hawaii (), also known as the Hawaii State Constitution, is the fundamental governing document of the U.S. state of Hawaii. As an organic text, it establishes the principles and framework of government, enumerates the rights and freedoms of Hawaiian citizens, and serves as the supreme law of the state.
Hawaii was governed by several constitutions during its period as a sovereign kingdom and short-lived transitional republic, prior to U.S. annexation in 1900. The current constitution was adopted by referendum in 1950, amended upon admission to the Union in 1959, and further amended at the constitutional convention of 1968; it was most recently amended in 1978, which saw the most significant changes to government and popular rights to date.

As in most states, the Hawaiian Constitution is modeled after United States Constitution and reinforces many of the same basic rights and structures, albeit with more expansive or unique provisions; unlike its federal counterpart, it lists key individual rights of citizens, guarantees an explicit right to privacy, safeguards collective bargaining, and prohibits sex-based discrimination. Reflecting the state&#x27;s unique history and cultural heritage, Constitution of Hawaii establishes protections for the environment, public wellness, and Native Hawaiians.

Hawaii&#x27;s local governmental structure is unique among the U.S. states in that it is limited to two levels of government: the state and the four counties, each with a mayor and a council; there are no municipal governments. The amendment process is similar to that of the federal constitution, requiring a proposal by constitutional convention or by the legislature. At close to 21,500 words, the Hawaii State Constitution is nearly five times longer than the U.S. Constitution, but shorter than the average state constitution.

==Background==
The Tenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which is part of the Bill of Rights, provides that &quot;The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved to the States respectively, or to the people.&quot; The Guarantee Clause of Article 4 of the Constitution states that &quot;The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government.&quot; These two provisions indicate that the constituent states of the U.S. have wide latitude to adopt a constitution as the fundamental document of state law.

==History ==
The Hawaii Constitution was framed by a Constitutional Convention under Act 334, Session Laws of Hawaii 1949. It was adopted by popular ballot on November 7, 1950, and was deemed amended when three propositions submitted to the people—in accordance with the Act of the U.S. Congress approved March 18, 1959—were adopted by the people on June 27, 1959. It was subsequently accepted, ratified, and confirmed by Congress on March 18, 1959, and became effective on August 21, 1959, upon the issuance of a presidential proclamation admitting the state of Hawaii into the Union.

The Constitution has since been amended a number of times in accordance with proposals adopted by the legislature or by constitutional convention and ratified by the people. Its most dramatic and sweeping changes came with the Constitutional Convention held on July 5, 1978. All 34 amendments proposed by the convention passed; collectively, they redefined the relationship between citizens and government, establishing term limits for state office holders, providing a requirement for an annual balanced budget, laying the groundwork for the return of federal (such as the island of Kahoolawe) and created the Office of Hawaiian Affairs to address the wrongs perpetrated against native Hawaiians. The 1978 convention also created an ambitious project of preservation of the Hawaiian culture including the adoption of Hawaiian diacritical marks for official usage, use of Hawaiian names, etc. The Hawaiian language became the official state language of Hawaii for the first time since the overthrow.

Based upon language the U.S. Supreme Court had used to legalize abortion and birth control around the same time, the 1978 convention added the text: &quot;the right of the people to privacy is recognized and shall not be infringed without the showing of a compelling state interest.&quot; The Hawaii State Constitution is one of only five in the U.S. to explicitly define a right to privacy.

==Preamble==
The preamble to the current Constitution of Hawaii states, &quot;We, the people of the State of Hawaii, grateful for Divine Guidance, and mindful of our Hawaiian heritage, reaffirm our belief in a government of the people, by the people and for the people, and with an understanding heart toward all peoples of the earth do hereby ordain and establish this constitution for the State of Hawaii.&quot;

==Bill of Rights==
The preamble is followed by a twenty-point Bill of rights:

* All political power of this State is inherent in the people; and the responsibility for the exercise thereof rests with the people. All government is founded on this authority.
* All persons are free by nature and are equal in their inherent and inalienable rights. Among these rights are the enjoyment of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, and the acquiring and possessing property. These rights cannot endure unless the people recognize their corresponding obligations and responsibilities.
* No law shall be enacted respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof, or abridging the freedom of speech or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to assemble and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.
* No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law, nor be denied the equal protection of the laws, nor be denied the enjoyment of his civil rights or be discriminated against in the exercise thereof because of race, religion, sex or ancestry.
* The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers and effects against unreasonable searches, seizures, and invasions of privacy shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or things to be seized or the communications sought to be intercepted.
* No citizen shall be disfranchised, or deprived of any of the rights or privileges secured to other citizens, unless by the law of the land.
* No citizen shall be denied enlistment in any military organization of this State nor be segregated therein because of race, religious principles or ancestry.
* No person shall be held to answer for a capital or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury, except in cases arising in the armed forces when in actual service in time of war or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy; nor shall any person be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself.
* Excessive bail shall not be required, nor excessive fines imposed, nor cruel or unusual punishment inflicted. The court may dispense with bail if reasonably satisfied that the defendant or witness will appear when directed, except for a defendant charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment.
* In suits at common law where the value in controversy shall exceed one hundred dollars, the right of trial by jury shall be preserved. The legislature may provide for a verdict by not less than three-fourths of the members of the jury.
* In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, or of such other district to which the prosecution may be removed with the consent of the accused; to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor; to have the assistance of counsel for his defense. The State shall provide counsel for an indigent defendant charged with an offense punishable by imprisonment for more than sixty days.
* No person shall be disqualified to serve as a juror because of sex.
* The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it. The power of suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus, and the laws or the execution thereof, shall never be exercised except by the legislature, or by authority derived from it to be exercised in such particular cases only as the legislature shall expressly prescribe.
* The military shall be held in strict subordination to the civil power.
* A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
* No soldier or member of the militia shall, in time of peace, be quartered in any house, without the consent of the owner or occupant, nor in time of war, except in a manner prescribed by law.
* There shall be no imprisonment for debt.
* Private property shall not be taken or damaged for public use without just compensation.
* The power of the State to act in the general welfare shall never be impaired by the making of any irrevocable grant of special privileges or immunities.

<doc id="845835" wikidata="Q2024654" url="?curid=845835" title="Ontario Highway 17">
<text>King&#x27;s Highway 17, more commonly known as Highway 17, is a provincially maintained highway and the primary route of the Trans-Canada Highway through the Canadian province of Ontario. It begins at the Manitoba boundary, west of Kenora, and the main section ends where Highway 417 begins just west of Arnprior. A small disconnected signed section of the highway still remains within the Ottawa Region between County Road 29 and Grants Side Road. This makes it Ontario&#x27;s longest highway.

The highway once extended even farther to the Quebec boundary in East Hawkesbury with a peak length of about . However, a section of Highway 17 &quot;disappeared&quot; when the Ottawa section of it was upgraded to the freeway Highway 417 in 1971. Highway 17 was not re-routed through Ottawa, nor did it share numbering with Highway 417 to rectify the discontinuity, even though Highway 417 formed a direct link between the western and eastern sections of Highway 17. However, from East Hawkesbury to Ottawa, Highway 17 retained the Trans-Canada Highway routing and signs until it met up again and merged with Highway 417 until 1997 when Highway 17 through Ottawa was downgraded. The Trans-Canada Highway designation now extends along all of Highway 417.

Ontario Highway 17 is a very important part of the national highway system in Canada, as it is the sole highway linking the eastern and western regions of the country. Although other small roads connect the province of Ontario with the province of Manitoba, it is the only major highway that links the two, making it a crucial section of Canada&#x27;s primary commercial and leisure route.

== History ==
=== Beginnings ===
With the establishment of the provincial highway network on February 26, 1920, the Department of Public Highways, predecessor to today&#x27;s Ministry of Transportation of Ontario, sought to establish a network of reliable roads through the southern part of the province. Through July and August 1920, a highway east of Ottawa to Pointe-Fortune at the Quebec boundary, known as the Montreal Road, was assumed by the department. This original routing of Highway 17 followed what is now Montreal Road, St Joseph Boulevard, and the Old Montreal Road eastward out of Ottawa; Laurier Street through Rockland; Regional Road 55 and 26 between Clarence and Plantagenet; Blue Corner Road and Bay Road (Regional Road 4) to L&#x27;Original; John Street, Pharand Street, Eliza Street, and Main Street to Hawkesbury; Front Road along the shore of the Ottawa River from Hawkesbury to Chute-a-Blondeau and Des Outaouais Road just west of and Pointe-Fortune, and Regional Road 17 elsewhere.
A portion of this original highway was lost when the completion of the Carillon Generating Station in 1964 raised the water level of the Ottawa River north of Voyageur Provincial Park.

West of Ottawa, a route was assumed to Arnprior on October 6, following today&#x27;s Carling Avenue, March Road and Donald B. Munro Drive between Ottawa and Kinburn, and Kinburn Side Road and Madawaska Boulevard between Kinburn and Arnprior. On June 15, 1921, the highway was extended to Pembroke via Renfrew, Cobden, and Beachburg. The entire route between Pembroke and Pointe-Fortune became known as Highway 17 in the summer of 1925.

Although the jurisdiction of the soon-to-become Department of Highways did not extend beyond Pembroke, a rough trail continued to North Bay, and a trunk road constructed by the Department of Northern Development beyond there to Sault Ste. Marie by 1923, roughly following the route of Highway 17 today.
The Pembroke and Mattawan Road Colonization Road was constructed between 1853 and 1874 to encourage settlement in the Upper Ottawa Valley. Between Mattawa and North Bay, many aboriginals and early settlers made use of the Mattawa River, the headwaters of which lie just north of Lake Nipissing. From there they would travel down the French River into Georgian Bay and onwards to Lake Superior. Highway 17 between Mattawa and Sault Ste. Marie roughly traces this early voyageur route.
=== Northern development and the Lakehead ===
Following World War I, discussions of a cross-continental road through Canada became vocal and construction of such a route was underway in several places. However, funding for this work was soon halted as the government distributed funding to projects that were believed to be more important than the luxury of the new road. The most significant accomplishment of this work was the Nipigon Highway between Thunder Bay and Nipigon, opened in 1924.

With the signing of the Department of Northern Development (DND) Act in 1926, construction resumed on improving many northern roads; the Ferguson Highway was the main project to begin as a result of the act. The onset of the Great Depression would result in federally funded relief projects being signed with provinces in late 1930.
Thousands of men were hired to construct highways in remote areas of the province from temporary camps, named Bennett Camps after then-Prime Minister R. B. Bennett. This provided the necessary labour to open road links through vast expanses of wilderness in a relatively short period of time. Beginning in 1931, certain routes were designated as the Trans-Canada Highway, including the route between Sault Ste. Marie and the Quebec boundary as well as the planned connection to Thunder Bay and Winnipeg.
By June 1931, planning for the route of the highway was complete,
and work underway on the new link between Thunder Bay and Winnipeg that would roughly parallel the Canadian Pacific Railway. The first section to open was between the Manitoba town of Whitemouth and Kenora. On July 1, 1932, (Dominion Day), an inter-provincial ceremony was held in Kenora to dedicate the new route.
The next link would connect the road through the Kenora with the rough road connecting Vermilion Bay, Dryden and Dyment. This section opened in early 1933.

From the east, construction proceeded at a similar pace, although through much more barren expanses of forests and lakes. By the end of 1932, construction had proceeded from Thunder Bay through Upsala to English River. A gap was all that remained, between Dyment and English River.
On June 4, 1934, crews cleared the last section of forest separating Thunder Bay from Winnipeg.
However, it would require another year of rock blasting and construction to make the route navigable by vehicles. On July 1, 1935, a multi-day motorcade celebration was held to officially open the new highway. A convoy of vehicles travelled from Thunder Bay to Winnipeg along the route, resting overnight in Kenora before completing the two-day journey.

By the end of 1935, numerous factors combined which resulted in the termination of the highway camps. The federal government of R. B. Bennett used Section 98 of the Criminal Code in 1931 to arrest several leaders of the Communist Party of Canada. However, the lack of evidence and protests would eventually lead to the early release of the men, much to the embarrassment of the government.
The men, with public support behind them, headed north to highway camps, where mounting tensions due to low wages, poor conditions, lacklustre food, isolation, and military-like discipline resulted in organized labour strikes. Funding was pulled from the Trans-Canada Highway in 1936.

On April 1, 1937, the DND was absorbed into the Department of Highways, and the road west of Pembroke became an extension of Highway 17. At this point, the highway from Sault Ste. Marie to the Quebec boundary was long. Portions were paved at this point: east of Sault Ste. Marie, west of Blind River, through Sudbury, east of Sturgeon Falls, through Mattawa, and from Chalk River to Quebec; the remainder was a gravel road. The highway between the Manitoba boundary and Nipigon was , mostly gravel-surfaced. The only significant exceptions were in the Kenora and Thunder Bay areas.

Before the outbreak of World War II in 1939, a new bridge spanning the Nipigon River was completed alongside a highway eastward to Schreiber. Both were opened together ceremoniously on September 24, 1937.
When the war began, construction on Highway 17 halted, with effort instead focused on the simpler northern route via Geraldton and Hearst.

=== The Gap ===
Following the war, construction on the missing segment of Highway 17 between Schreiber and Sault Ste. Marie proceeded slowly; the completion of Highway 11 between Nipigon and Hearst already provided a road between the east and west. However, in 1949 the federal government signed the Trans-Canada Highway Act, which provided up to a 90% subsidy to provinces to complete their portion of the highway to the required standards. Two portions of Ontario&#x27;s route were eligible for this subsidy: Highway 69 between Parry Sound and Sudbury, and Highway 17 along the north shore of Lake Superior.

Amongst some of the most difficult terrain encountered in Canada, engineers blasted 2,087,234 cubic metres (2,730,000 cubic yards) of rock, removed 5,982,641 cubic metres (7,825,000 cubic yards) of earth, and cleared of forest in order to bridge the of wilderness known as &quot;the Gap&quot;. The Gap was completed and opened to traffic on September 17, 1960, uniting the two segments and completing the route of Highway 17 from the Manitoba border to the Quebec border.

=== The Queensway ===

During the 1950s, the Greber Plan called for the creation of numerous parkways and divided highways through the growing city of Ottawa. One of these, known as &quot;The Queensway&quot;, was a grade-separated freeway that would bypass the urban alignment of Highway 17. The Greber Plan was produced by Jacques Gréber under the direction of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King in the late 1940s. Although Gréber had been corresponding with King as early as 1936, World War II halted any plans from reaching fruition at that time. Following the war, Gréber was again contacted and his expertise requested. He arrived on October 2, 1945, and began working almost immediately.
The Greber Plan, as it came to be known, was released in 1950 and presented to the House of Commons on May 22, 1951.
The plan called for the complete reorganization of Ottawa&#x27;s road and rail network, and included amongst the numerous parkways was an east to west expressway along what was then a Canadian National Railway line.

With the rail lines removed, construction of the new expressway got underway in 1957 when Queen Elizabeth visited Ottawa to open the first session of the 23rd Parliament. On October 15, the Queen detonated dynamite charges from the Hurdman Bridge, which now overlooks the highway as it crosses the Rideau River, and formally dedicated the new project as the Queensway. At the ceremony, premier Leslie Frost indicated that the entire project would cost C$31 million and emphasized the importance of the link to the Trans-Canada Highway.

The Queensway was constructed in four phases, each opening independently: phase one, from Alta Vista Drive (now Riverside Drive) east to Highway 17 (Montreal Road); phase two, from Highway 7 and Highway 15 (Richmond Road) to Carling Avenue; phase three, from Carling Avenue to O&#x27;Connor Street; and, phase four, from O&#x27;Connor Street to Alta Vista Drive, crossing the Rideau Canal and Rideau River.
Phase one opened to traffic on November 25, 1960, extending up to the Rideau River.
On the western side of Ottawa, phase two opened a year later in October 1961. The central section presented the greatest challenge, as an embankment was built to create grade-separations. In addition, the structures over the Rideau Canal and river required several years of construction. On May 15, 1964, the majority of the third phase was ceremonially opened.
completing the Carling Avenue interchange and extending the freeway as far as Bronson Avenue.
Several months later, on September 17 the short but complicated section east to O&#x27;Connor Street was opened.
This left only phase four, the central section of the Queensway, which was opened in three segments. On November 26, 1965, the structures over the Rideau Canal were opened to traffic. At the same time, the westbound lanes of the Queensway were extended to Concord Street, located west of the Nicholas Street interchange.
The interchange opened on January 1, 1966, allowing travel in both directions over the canal.
The final segment, linking the two section of the Queensway, was placed into service on October 28, 1966.
Following this, the Highway 17 designation was applied along the Queensway and the old routing renumbered as Highway 17B.

=== Bypasses and upgrades ===
Although it was completed from Manitoba to Quebec in 1960, many upgrades to the original routing of Highway 17 had and would take place over the years. In addition to bypasses around almost every urban centre it encountered, many original sections have been downloaded to regional and local jurisdiction or decommissioned entirely to lie abandoned in the forest. Of special note are reroutings in the Ottawa Valley – where the highway follows very little of the original routing – and around Thunder Bay, where it has undergone several reroutings and upgrades since the 1920s. In the following section, upgrades are listed from west to east due to complex chronologies.

;Thunder Bay
The original routing of Highway 17 travelled into Port Arthur along the Dawson Road, now Highway 102.

;Nipigon
Highway 17 originally entered Red Rock along what is now Highway 628 before turning north alongside the Nipigon River north to Nipigon.

;Sault Ste. Marie
Although the route into and out of Sault Ste. Marie has remained generally the same, Highway 17 has been rerouted through the city numerous times. In addition, to the east of the city, the route has been redirected onto a four lane at-grade expressway around Echo Bay. As recently as 2022, local government has reached out to the provincial government to revisit possibilities of creating a bypass around Sault Ste. Marie—however this plan has long been stalled by the MTO and provincial government, largely due to the high cost of construction and uncertain demand; there has also been no environmental impact assessment to date.

;Espanola

;Sudbury
The route of Highway 17 in Sudbury currently follows the Southwest and Southeast Bypasses through the south end of the city. Prior to the completion of this route, the highway followed what is now Municipal Road 55 through the downtown core.

;North Bay

;Upper Ottawa Valley
Construction of the Renfrew Bypass began in June 1974,
and continued for three years, opening in 1977.

;Ottawa

;Lower Ottawa Valley

;Elsewhere
The last gravel stretches of Highway 17, between Kenora and Dryden and north of Batchawana Bay, were paved in 1964.

=== Downloads ===
On April 1, 1997, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) transferred the responsibility of maintenance and upkeep along of Highway 17 east of &quot;the split&quot; with Highway 417 to Trim Road (Regional Road 57), a process commonly referred to as &quot;downloading&quot;. The Region of Ottawa–Carleton designated the road as Regional Road 174. Despite the protests of the region that the route served a provincial purpose, a second round of transfers saw the remainder of Highway 17 to the Region&#x27;s eastern limit downloaded on January 1, 1998, adding to the length of Regional Road 174.
The highway was also downloaded within the United Counties of Prescott and Russell, where it was redesignated as County Road 17.
The result of these transfers was the truncation of Highway 17 at the western end of Highway 417, while the Trans-Canada Highway designation was taken from the former Highway 17 and applied to Highway 417.
A short disconnected section of Highway 17 between Ottawa Road 29 and Grants Side Road remains under provincial jurisdiction to the present day.

=== Conversion to Highway 417 northwest of Ottawa ===
Expansion of the two lane Highway 17 west of the interchange with Highway 7 got underway in 1991; this section was renumbered as Highway 417 as construction progressed westward. The construction saw a second two lane roadway built parallel to the existing route to create a divided freeway, a process known as twinning.

When the twinning of Highway 17 reached March Road, new contracts were tendered to continue the process northward. Bot Construction was awarded the contract for the section north to Panmure Road on December 9, 1998. On February 16, 2000, the Ministry of Transportation of Ontario (MTO) officially announced that Highway 417 would be extended to Arnprior over the next several years. A contract to build the freeway from north of Panmure Road to south of Arnprior was tendered in early 2002. This work was completed and the extension opened to traffic on September 24, 2004.

Concurrent with the twinning of Highway 7 between Carleton Place and Ottawa, the interchange with Highway 417 was upgraded to support the divided traffic flows; a new flyover ramp was built connecting westbound Highway 417 with westbound Highway 7. Construction began on August 22, 2006, and was opened in June 2008 along with the Highway 7 expansion.

Construction to twin the Arnprior Bypass portion of Highway 17, which included a new interchange at White Lake Road, began during the spring of 2009. The bypass was originally built in 1981 as one of a number of upgrades to Highway 17 between Ottawa and North Bay. It was intended for directing through traffic around downtown Arnprior and was designed for an eventual upgrade to a divided freeway. The major structure in this project was a second crossing of the Madawaska River. Work was completed in late 2012; the new section was opened ceremonially on November 29 and cost $63 million, $7 million less than projected.

== Route description ==
Highway 17, particularly west of Sault Ste. Marie, crosses some of the most remote regions of Ontario. Despite the isolation of the highway, it is well-travelled throughout its length. The section of Highway 17 north of Lake Superior is regarded as one of the most scenic drives in the province.

=== Manitoba to Nipigon ===
Highway 17 begins at the boundary between Ontario and Manitoba, where a large installation greets drivers in both directions. The highway is two lanes wide and travels over and between the surface features of the Canadian Shield; further west into Manitoba the highway widens into a four-lane divided expressway. To the east, the highway travels through thick boreal forest towards Keewatin, where the Kenora Bypass, Highway 17A, splits to the north. Through the town of Kenora, Highway 17 is signed but maintained under a connecting link agreement between the town and the province. Full provincial maintenance resumes at the eastern town limits. Further east, the highway merges with the Kenora Bypass. It meets the northern terminus of Highway 71, then makes a gradual eastward journey through the lake-dotted Kenora District to the town of Dryden. Here the highway encounters one of the few agriculturally-sustainable areas of northern Ontario. The highway begins to zig-zag southeasterly, passing through several minor settlements before entering the mining town of Ignace. Shortly thereafter, it begins to curve to the south. It meets Highway 11 east of the Manitoba boundary.
The two highways travel concurrently towards Thunder Bay at the western Lakehead of Lake Superior. Though it originally travelled through what was then the twin-cities, the highway bypasses to the northwest on the at-grade Thunder Bay Expressway.

=== Nipigon to Sudbury ===
Within Nipigon, Highway 11 and Highway 17 cross the Nipigon River on the Nipigon River Bridge. Along with the railway crossing immediately to the south, and another on the northern shore of Lake Nipigon, this forms the narrowest bottleneck in Canada between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. On the eastern shore of the river, Highway 11 separates and travels north towards Geraldton and Hearst. Highway 17 continues east along the northern shore of Lake Superior. Near White River, the highway enters Algoma District and turns southward. It meets the western terminus of Highway 101 near Wawa, which provides for a shorter route to Sudbury via the Sultan Industrial Road.
South of Wawa, the highway enters Lake Superior Provincial Park. After proceeding through several mountain ranges, and crossing numerous rivers and the Montreal River Hill, the highway enters Sault Ste. Marie. Here a border crossing into the United States is provided via the Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge, which connects with I-75 in Michigan. As the highway exits Sault Ste. Marie to the east, a newly constructed segment of four-lane divided highway branches north; Highway 17B (one of two remaining business routes of Highway 17 in service) continues east through Garden River. The divided highway bypasses Garden River and passes east of Echo Bay before curving south and merging with Highway 17B.

Shortly thereafter, it turns to the east and travels along the North Channel of Lake Huron towards Sudbury, passing through numerous small towns, including Thessalon, Blind River, Massey and McKerrow. At Sudbury, the highway widens into a freeway through the Walden area of the city until reaching the Southwest / Southeast Bypass at Lively, where it narrows again to a Super 2 road. This segment is currently undergoing an environmental assessment, with plans to upgrade it to a full freeway in the next ten years.

=== Sudbury to Arnprior ===

Highway 17 passes to the south of the urban centre of Sudbury. It meets Highway 69 at an interchange. At this interchange, the Southwest and Southeast Bypasses meet, and for just over a kilometre, Highway 17 is a divided four-lane freeway.

The Super 2 continues northeast to meet the original alignment of Highway 17 east of downtown Sudbury. Here it turns east and travels through the city&#x27;s outlying neighbourhoods of Coniston and Wahnapitae; a new freeway alignment of this route is currently in the planning stages.

The highway route passes through the rural municipalities of Markstay-Warren and West Nipissing before reaching North Bay, where it follows an undivided four-lane expressway alignment, with reduced but not full control of access, through the city of North Bay; as of 2012, early preparations have taken place for a freeway conversion and realignment of this segment. For 4.1 kilometres from Algonquin Avenue to the Twin Lakes area, the route is once again concurrent with Highway 11. At the northern end of this concurrency, Highway 11 travels north towards Cochrane before continuing westward to Nipigon; at the southern end, it continues southward towards Barrie, while Highway 17 turns east toward the Ottawa Valley. An at-grade intersection with Highway 63 is located at approximately the midpoint of the concurrency.
East of North Bay, Highway 17 meets Highway 94, thereafter travelling alongside the Mattawa River to its confluence with the Ottawa River in Mattawa, where it meets Highway 533 at a roundabout. The highway then parallels the Ottawa River through a mountainous region, first passing through the villages of Stonecliffe and Rolphton before arriving in Deep River, a planned community developed as part of the Manhattan Project. It then passes through Chalk River and enters Canadian Forces Base Petawawa.

Beginning at the southern end of the army base, Highway 17 follows the &quot;Pembroke Bypass&quot;, bypassing west of Petawawa and Pembroke, where it intersects Highway 41. The bypass ends at Renfrew County Road 40, north of Muskrat Lake. The highway then travels south through the town of Cobden. It follows a bypass east of Renfrew and meets Highway 60. Highway 17 curves east and passes north of Alexander Stewart Provincial Park. Approximately west of Scheel Drive, west of Arnprior, the highway divides and widens to four lanes, at which point Highway 417 begins. A disconnected section of Highway 17 still exists within the City of Ottawa, between Ottawa Road 29 and Grants Side Road, travelling parallel to Highway 417. However, it is likely to be downgraded, becoming an extension of Ottawa Road 117.
=== Business routes ===

For many decades, Highway 17 had five business routes. All were at one time the primary route of Highway 17 through their respective locations, and were given the Highway 17B business route designation following the construction or designation of a newer bypass alignment. Only the route in North Bay remains as the business routes in Ottawa, North Bay, Thessalon and Sault Ste. Marie have been decommissioned.

In 2009, a new Highway 17B route was created in the Garden River First Nation.

== Future ==
With all route planning studies now completed on Highways 11 and 69/400, in the latter half of the 2000s, the Ministry of Transportation&#x27;s planning branch began undertaking more active preparations for the eventual conversion of Highway 17 to freeway. Although no comprehensive conversion plan is currently in place, planning and construction projects are now underway at a number of locations along the highway.

Sault Ste. Marie MPP David Orazietti has spearheaded a petition to have the entire highway four-laned from Arnprior to Sault Ste. Marie, similar to the campaign previously undertaken by his caucus colleague Rick Bartolucci regarding the extension of Highway 400. Cheryl Gallant, the federal Member of Parliament for Renfrew—Nipissing—Pembroke, has also advocated the four-laning of the highway through the Ottawa Valley toward North Bay, and ultimately the entire length of the highway throughout Northern Ontario.

A 2009 study commissioned by the forestry trade magazine &quot;The Working Forest&quot;, titled &quot;A Vision for Ontario&#x27;s Trans Canada Highway, North Bay to the Manitoba Border&quot;, determined that it would cost the Ontario government $600 million per year over 25 years to convert the entire length of both Highway 17 and Highway 11 to freeway, suggesting that a comprehensive plan would be affordable and achievable if the provincial and federal governments could reach a cost-sharing agreement.

=== Renfrew County ===

Studies are underway on the extension of Highway 417 through the Ottawa Valley region from its current terminus at Arnprior to Petawawa. From Arnprior to Haley Station and from Meath to Petawawa, the proposed freeway route largely follows the existing alignment — in these areas, the current highway route largely avoids existing communities, and thus a second set of lanes can be easily added alongside the existing route. Within the township of Whitewater Region, however, a new alignment is planned several kilometres east of the existing road in order to bypass communities such as Cobden.

In August 2017, the Ministry of Transportation formally confirmed that detail design studies have commenced on the next westward extension of Highway 417, from the existing terminus at Scheel Drive in Arnprior to three kilometres west of the Bruce Street intersection at Renfrew.

=== North Bay ===
Planning studies have been completed for the conversion of Highway 17&#x27;s alignment through North Bay, which is currently a four-lane expressway with partial but not full control of access, into a full freeway. The plan will include an interchange with a new alignment of Highway 11, which would replace the existing Algonquin Avenue segment. In the city, the four-laned route will follow the existing highway route from the western city limits to Meighen Avenue, and then a new alignment from there to the eastbound Highway 11/17 interchange. The bypassed portion of the current route will be realigned to connect with Lansdowne Avenue. This alignment, nicknamed &quot;Route 6&quot;, has been planned since the 1970s; although minor adjustments to the plan have been made since, as of 2017 the ministry has not announced an official construction schedule.

Studies commenced on an extension of the four-lane route easterly to Bonfield in early 2011, and from Eau Claire Station to the Nipissing District-Renfrew County boundary in early 2012; further studies on the routes from Bonfield to Eau Claire Station and from North Bay to Cache Bay are expected to begin at a later date.

=== Sudbury ===
As the extension of Highway 400 approaches Sudbury, the MTO began a route planning and environmental assessment study on Highway 17 easterly from Highway 69 to Markstay in 2010; studies for the segment from Highway 69 westerly to the existing freeway in Walden were completed in 2007. The current route plan involves twinning the existing Southeast Bypass to its terminus, along with the construction of a new four-lane route north of Coniston and Wahnapitae. 

Original plans called for a new multi-level interchange with Highway 69 in the Lake Laurentian Conservation Area.
However, public consultation has since removed this proposal from the route planning process; all of the plans currently under consideration involve converting the existing alignment of Highway 69 to a full freeway which would meet Highway 17 at the existing interchange.

Preliminary route planning studies have also been completed on the freeway&#x27;s westerly extension to McKerrow, near Espanola, but no construction schedule has been announced to date. However, the first phase of this route, extending the existing freeway from Municipal Road 55 in Sudbury for six kilometres farther west through the Den-Lou neighbourhood, is currently in the detail design phase.

=== Sault Ste. Marie ===
At Sault Ste. Marie, the expressway segment currently ends six kilometres short of its eventual terminus at Black Road and Second Line, as an agreement has yet to be reached with the Batchawana First Nation regarding land use through Rankin. The completion date for this segment is not currently known. In the interim, highway traffic travels between the expressway and the current highway alignment through Sault Ste. Marie by means of the previously planned northerly extension of Trunk Road.

The former segment of Highway 17 through Garden River was initially redesignated as part of Highway 638, although the Garden River First Nation disputed this designation and insisted that the highway be renamed Highway 17B. As of February 2009, the former route is now designated as Highway 17B. In February 2010, Garden River&#x27;s band council publicly warned that they would consider imposing tolls on the routes of both Highway 17 and Highway 17B through their territory if the provincial government did not assist the council with a funding shortfall of approximately $1 million.

In February 2011, the Ministry of Transportation announced that the expressway&#x27;s current level intersection at Highway 638 in Echo Bay will be converted to a full interchange.

=== Thunder Bay and Kenora ===

Construction started in 2004 on a westerly extension of Thunder Bay&#x27;s Harbour Expressway, from the Thunder Bay Expressway to Vibert Road, intended to serve as a new alignment for Highways 11 and 17.

In July 2008 the federal and provincial governments announced a $6.2 billion infrastructure program that makes the four-laning of Hwys. 11 and 17 near Kenora and Thunder Bay a priority. Engineering work on twinning 11/17 between Nipigon and Thunder Bay was to begin in 2008. On May 1, 2009 the federal and provincial government announced that twinning of Highway 11/17 would begin in 2010.
On May 15, 2009, the federal and provincial government announced that twinning of Highway 17 at the Manitoba/Ontario boundary easterly toward Kenora would also begin in 2010. Construction to twin the highway between Ouimet and Dorion northeast of Thunder Bay is currently underway.

On November19, 2021, the first contracts for the twinning of Highway17 east from the Manitoba boundary to Kenora were signed. Work is set to begin in the spring of 2022 on the portion from the provincial boundary to Highway 673.

<text>Tomato juice is a juice made from tomatoes, usually used as a beverage, either plain or in cocktails such as a Bloody Mary, a Caesar, or Michelada.

==History==
Tomato juice was first served as a beverage in 1917 by Louis Perrin at the French Lick Springs Hotel in southern Indiana, when he ran out of orange juice and needed a quick substitute. His combination of squeezed tomatoes, sugar and his special sauce became an instant success as Chicago businessmen spread the word about the tomato juice cocktail.

==Production==
Many commercial manufacturers of tomato juice also add salt. Other ingredients are also often added, such as onion powder, garlic powder, and other spices. In the United States, mass-produced tomato juice began to be marketed in the mid 1920s, and became a popular breakfast drink a few years thereafter.

In the United States, most tomato juice is made from tomato paste, but pressing is allowed as well. The tomatoes are required to be ripe (using a color standard on the finished product), mostly blemish-free, and mostly deseeded. The total solid content is more than 5.0%, with no added water allowed. Additional salt and organic acidulants, but not sweeteners, are allowed.

In Canada, tomato juice is unconcentrated and pasteurized. The other requirements are largely similar, except that additives allowed are a sweetening agent, citric acid and salt. Reconstituted juices in general are required to be labelled clearly.

==Uses==

In Canada and Mexico, tomato juice is commonly mixed with beer; the concoction is known in Canada as Calgary Red-Eye, and in Mexico as Cerveza preparada. Tomato juice is the base for the cocktails Bloody Mary and Bloody Caesar, and the cocktail mixer Clamato. In the UK, tomato juice is commonly combined with Worcestershire sauce. In Germany, tomato juice is a base ingredient in the Mexikaner mixed shot.

Chilled tomato juice was formerly popular as an appetizer at restaurants in the United States. 

Tomato juice is frequently used as a packing liquid for canned tomatoes, though it is sometimes replaced by tomato purée for international commerce due to tariff issues on vegetables vs. sauces. According to &quot;Cook&#x27;s Illustrated&quot; magazine, tomatoes packed in juice as opposed to purée tend to win taste tests, being perceived as fresher tasting.

Tomato juice is used in the preparation of tomato juice agar, used to culture various species of &quot;Lactobacillus&quot;.

Tomato juice is a popular drink among airplane passengers. A small study by Yan and Dando hints that this is due to an increased perception of umami flavor while in the loud and pressurized environment of the cabin. An alternative explanation is that it has become tradition similar to eating popcorn at the cinema.

<text>jEdit is a free software text editor available under GPL-2.0-or-later. It is written in Java and runs on any operating system with Java support, including BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

==History==
The development of jEdit was started by Slava Pestov in 1998, who left the project in 2006, handing development to the free software community.

==Features==
jEdit includes syntax highlighting that provides native support for over 200 file formats. Support for additional formats can be added manually using XML files. It supports UTF-8 and many other encodings.

It has extensive code folding and text folding capabilities as well as text wrapping that takes indents into account.

The application is highly customizable and can be extended with macros written in BeanShell, Jython, ECMAScript and some other scripting languages.

===Plug-ins===
There are over 150 available jEdit plug-ins for many different application areas.

Plug-ins are used to customize the application for individual use and can make it into an advanced XML/HTML editor, or an integrated development environment (IDE), with compiler, code completion, context-sensitive help, debugging, visual differentiation and language-specific tools.

The plug-ins are downloaded via an integrated plug-in manager which finds and installs them along with any dependencies. The plugin manager will track new versions and can download associated updates automatically.

Some available plug-ins include:
* Spell checker using Aspell
* Syntax and style checkers for various languages
* Text auto-complete
* Accents plugin that converts character abbreviations for accented characters as they are typed.
* XML plugin that is used for editing XML, HTML, ECMAScript and CSS files. In the case of XML, the plug-in does validation. For XML, HTML and CSS, it uses auto-completion popups for elements, attributes and entities.

==Reception==
In general, jEdit has received positive reviews from developers.

Rob Griffiths wrote in April 2002 for &quot;MAC OS X HINTS&quot; saying he was &quot;very impressed&quot; and naming it &quot;pick of the week&quot;. He cited its file memory upon reopening, its ability to notice if an open file was changed on disk by another program, syntax coloring, including that users can create their own color schemes, split windows feature, show line number feature, convertible tabs to soft-tabs and view sidebars. He also praised its customization possibilities using the extensive preferences panel and the &quot;on the fly&quot; search engine, which searches while typing. Griffiths noted that the application has a few drawbacks, such as that it is &quot;a bit slow at scrolling a line at a time&quot; and that because it is a Java application it doesn&#x27;t have the full Aqua interface.

Also reviewing the application in April 2002, Daniel Steinberg writing for O&#x27;Reilly Media said: 

Scott Beatty reviewing jEdit on &quot;SitePoint&quot; in 2005 particularly noted the application&#x27;s folding feature along with its search and replace and PHP syntax highlighting capabilities. He recommended the use of the PHPParser plug-in. PHPParser is a sidebar that checks for PHP syntax errors whenever a PHP code file is loaded or saved. He noted that downloading jEdit is simple, but that getting and installing the plug-ins to customize it for individual use can be a complex process: &quot;Beware that a full setup requires a series of downloads, and that this process can take time.&quot;

Writing in December 2011, reviewer Rares Aioanei praised jEdit&#x27;s versatility, stating &quot;jEdit&#x27;s design allows you to use it as a simple editor, but also use it as an IDE and expand its functionality via plugins so that it becomes exactly what you want it to be for the task or language at hand.&quot; but also adding that &quot;jEdit is not, however, an IDE with everything but the Christmas tree, like Eclipse or Microsoft Visual Studio. Rather, it&#x27;s a compact application for editing code, providing practical tools along with basic IDE features.&quot;

<text>Victor Tayback (January 6, 1930 – May 25, 1990) was an American actor. He was best known for his role as diner owner Mel Sharples on the television sitcom &quot;Alice&quot; (1976–1985), as well as his multiple guest appearances on &quot;The Love Boat&quot; (1977–1987). The former earned him two consecutive Golden Globe Awards (for Best Supporting Actor in a Television Series) and a Primetime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Continuing Performance by a Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series.

==Early life==
Tayback was born on January 6, 1930 in Brooklyn, New York, to Syrian Catholic immigrant parents Helen (née Hanood; ) and Najeeb James Tayback () . Both of his parents had emigrated to the United States from Aleppo. He moved with his family to Burbank, California during his teenage years and attended Burbank High School, from which he graduated in 1947. He also attended Glendale Community College and the Frederick A. Speare School of Radio and TV Broadcasting.

==Career==
Tayback served in the United States Navy before beginning his acting career at the age of 25. A lifetime member of the Actors Studio, he was a familiar face on television in the 1960s and 1970s, appearing on numerous series, including &quot;The Man from U.N.C.L.E.&quot;, &quot;Star Trek&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot;, &quot;That Girl&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;, &quot;The Partridge Family&quot;, &quot;All in the Family&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;Columbo&quot;, and &quot;The Love Boat&quot;. He also appeared in many films such as &quot;Bullitt&quot; (1968), &quot;Papillon&quot; (1973), &quot;The Gambler&quot; (1974), &quot;The Cheap Detective&quot; (1978), and &quot;All Dogs Go to Heaven&quot; (1989), as well as more than 25 stage productions, including &quot;Twelve Angry Men&quot;, &quot;The Diary of Anne Frank&quot;, &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, and &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot;. He was the co-founder of the theater troupe Company of Angels. He also appeared in television commercials, notably in 1968 with Richard Dreyfuss for the AMC Javelin.

Tayback&#x27;s most famous role was as diner owner Mel Sharples in both the film &quot;Alice Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; (1974) and the television series &quot;Alice&quot; (1976–1985). He was the only actor in the original film to reprise his role for the rest of the series. For the role, he was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award in 1978 and won two consecutive Golden Globe Awards in 1980 and 1981. In 1971, he made a guest appearance as Dirks in season 16, episode 19 of the long-running CBS Western series &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;.

==Personal life==
Tayback was married to Sheila Maureen Barnard (1932–2001) from March 16, 1963, until his death on May 25, 1990. They had a son, Christopher (born 1963), who is a business trial lawyer and former prosecutor.

==Death==
Tayback died of a heart attack at age 60 at Glendale Adventist Medical Center on May 25, 1990. He is buried at Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Hollywood Hills).

<text>Thomas Dadford Sr. (died 1809) was an English canal engineer as were his sons, Thomas Dadford Jr., John Dadford, and James Dadford.

==Biography==
Thomas Dadford probably originated from Stewponey or Stourton, Staffordshire, near Stourbridge. He started as one of James Brindley&#x27;s many pupil-assistants, in which capacity he worked on the Staffordshire and Worcestershire Canal and the Birmingham Canal Navigations.

He was engineer and surveyor on the Dudley Canal until 1783, and consulted by them later when they were extending through Dudley Tunnel.

*1774 – with John Priddy he surveyed the Stroudwater Canal
*1782 – with Thomas (Junior), he made recommendations for improvements to the River Trent.
*1784 – advised on the Coventry Canal&#x27;s aqueduct over the River Tame.
*1789 – cutting contractor on the Cromford Canal.
*1791, he became a shareholder of the Neath Canal.

The latter part of his career was spent in Monmouthshire, Glamorganshire, and Montgomeryshire, for example on the Monmouthshire &amp; Brecon Canal in the early 1790s, often working with his two sons. He worked on many canal projects, including the Neath and the Aberdare, in many of which he was also a shareholder. Until 1794, with his son and Thomas Sheasby, he was engineer and contractor on the Glamorganshire Canal, until they had a row with the company and were arrested for alleged overpayments. The matter was later resolved in their favour and they were exonerated.

His last canal was the Montgomeryshire, where he succeeded his son John as engineer in July 1797.

<doc id="845862" wikidata="Q599141" url="?curid=845862" title="Antonine Plague">
<text>The Antonine Plague of AD 165 to 180, also known as the Plague of Galen (after Galen, the Greek physician who described it), was a prolonged and destructive epidemic, which impacted the Roman Empire. It was possibly contracted and spread by soldiers who were returning from campaign in the Near East. Scholars generally believed the plague was smallpox, due to the skin eruptions over the entirety of the body which appeared to be red and black (Horgan), although measles has also been suggested, and recent genetic evidence strongly suggests that the most severe form of smallpox arose in Europe much later. As yet, there is no genetic evidence from the Antonine plague.

Ancient sources agree that the plague is likely to have appeared during the Roman siege of the Mesopotamian city of Seleucia in the winter of 165–166, during the Parthian campaign of Lucius Verus. Ammianus Marcellinus reported that the plague spread to Gaul and to the legions along the Rhine. Eutropius stated that a large proportion of the empire&#x27;s population died from this outbreak. According to the contemporary Roman historian Cassius Dio, the disease broke out again nine years later in 189 AD and caused up to 2,000 deaths a day in the city of Rome, 25% of those who were affected. The total death count has been estimated at 5–10 million, roughly 10% of the population of the empire. The disease was particularly deadly in the cities and within the Roman army.

The Antonine plague occurred during the last years of what is called the Pax Romana, the high point in the influence, territorial control, and population of the Roman Empire. Historians differ in their opinions of the impact of the plague on the empire in the increasingly troubled eras after its appearance. Based on archaeological records, Roman commercial activity in the Indian Ocean extending to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia from ports of Roman Egypt seems to have suffered a major setback after the plague. This disruption likely contributed to a broader economic decline and social instability throughout the empire in the years that followed.

==Economic growth and poor health==
Epidemics were common in the ancient world, but the Antonine plague was the first known pandemic of the Roman Empire. The Antonine plague spread throughout the Roman Empire and infected many millions of people. The pandemic erupted during the last years of what is often considered the &quot;golden age&quot; of Rome during the reign of co-emperor Marcus Aurelius. The Roman Empire at that time had a population estimated at 75 million people. Historians generally agree that the population of the Roman Empire peaked at about the time that the Antonine Plague appeared and, thereafter, the population declined.

The economic prosperity of the Roman Empire notwithstanding, the conditions were propitious for a pandemic. The population was unhealthy. About 20 percent of the population—a large percentage by ancient standards—lived in one of hundreds of cities; Rome, with a population estimated at one million, being the largest. The cities were a &quot;demographic sink&quot; even in the best of times. The death rate exceeded the birth rates and a constant in-migration of new residents was necessary to maintain the urban population. As perhaps more than one-half of children died before reaching adulthood, the average life expectancy at birth was only in the mid-twenties. Dense urban populations and poor sanitation contributed to the dangers of disease. The connectivity by land and sea between the vast territories of the Roman Empire made the transfer of infectious diseases from one region to another easier and more rapid than it was in smaller, more geographically confined societies. Epidemics of infectious diseases in the empire were common, with nine recorded between 43 BC and 148 AD. The rich were not immune to the unhealthy conditions. For example, only two of emperor Marcus Aurelius&#x27; fourteen children are known to have reached adulthood.

A good indicator of nutrition and the disease burden is the average height of the population. The conclusion of the study of thousands of skeletons is that the average Roman was shorter in stature than the people of pre-Roman societies of Italy and the post-Roman societies of the Middle Ages. The view of historian Kyle Harper is that &quot;not for the last time in history, a precocious leap forward in social development brought biological reverses&quot;. This decline in average height during the Roman era may reflect the stresses of urbanization, warfare, and economic inequality. Despite increasing development, average height did not increase in Europe between 1000 and 1800, while it increased in the 5th and 6th centuries during late antiquity.

==Spread of the disease==
The traditional Roman view attributed the cause of the Antonine plague to the violation by the Roman army of a temple in the city of Seleucia during the Parthian campaign of Lucius Verus. The soldiers then carried it back to the Roman Empire from the Parthian Empire in early 166. However, the first documented case of the plague was in Smyrna (in Roman Anatolia) in 165 where the orator Aelius Aristides almost died from the disease. From the east the plague spread westward reaching Rome in 166 and nearly every corner of the empire by 172. The co-emperor Lucius Verus died from the plague in 169 and it ravaged the Roman army.

The plague endured until about 180 and another epidemic, possibly related, is reported by Dio Cassius to have struck the city of Rome in 189. Two thousand people in the city often died on a single day. Whether this new epidemic, or recurrence of the Antonine plague, impacted the empire outside the city of Rome is unknown.

== Epidemiology ==

In 166, during the epidemic, the Greek physician and writer Galen traveled from Rome to his home in Asia Minor and returned to Rome in 168, when he was summoned by the two Augusti, the co-emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus. He was present at the outbreak among troops stationed at Aquileia in the winter of 168/69. Galen briefly recorded observations and a description of the epidemic in the treatise &quot;Methodus Medendi&quot; (&quot;Method of Treatment&quot;), and he scattered other references to it among his voluminous writings. He described the plague as &quot;great&quot; and of long duration, and mentioned fever, diarrhea, and pharyngitis as well as a skin eruption, sometimes dry and sometimes pustular, that appeared on the 9th day of the illness to be a series of symptoms. The information that was provided by Galen does not unambiguously identify the nature of the disease, but scholars have generally preferred to diagnose it as smallpox.

The historian William H. McNeill asserts that the Antonine Plague and the later Plague of Cyprian (251–c. 270) were outbreaks of two different diseases, one of smallpox and one of measles but not necessarily in that order. The severe devastation to the European population from the two plagues may indicate that people had no previous exposure to either disease, which brought immunity to survivors. Other historians believe that both outbreaks involved smallpox. The latter view is bolstered by molecular estimates that place the evolution of measles sometime after 1000 AD. However, Galen&#x27;s description of the Antonine Plague is not completely consistent with smallpox.

==Impact==
Historians differ in their assessment of the impact of the Antonine Plague on Rome. To some, the plague was the beginning of the decline of the Roman Empire. To others, it was a minor event, documented by Galen and other writers but only slightly more deadly than other epidemics which frequently ravaged parts of the empire. Estimates of the fatalities from the pandemic range from 2 to 33% of the Roman Empire&#x27;s population with deaths between 1.5 and 25 million people. Most estimates coalesce around a fatality rate of about 10% (7.5 million people) of the total population of the empire with death rates of up to 15% in the cities and the army. If the pandemic was indeed smallpox, the number who died would have probably been about 25% of those infected as the survival rate from smallpox is often around 75%.

The traditional view was expressed by Barthold Georg Niebuhr (1776–1831) who concluded that &quot;as the reign of Marcus Aurelius forms a turning point in so many things, and above all in literature and art, I have no doubt that this crisis was brought about by that plague ... The ancient world never recovered from the blow inflicted on it by the plague which visited it in the reign of Marcus Aurelius.&quot; More recently, scholar Kyle Harper said something similar: the pandemic &quot;in any account of Rome&#x27;s destiny ... merit[s] a place squarely in the forefront.&quot;
To the contrary, a team of six historians questioned the &quot;extreme&quot; position of Harper and others on this plague as &quot;ignoring scholarship that suggests it had a less than catastrophic outcome,&quot; but the historians affirmed that &quot;we do not doubt that disease and climate had some of the impact Harper describes.&quot;

Some historians have hypothesized that the epidemic resulted in a surge in the popularity of the cult of Asclepius, the god of medicine; the epigraphic record, however, shows no evidence of such increase in the cult&#x27;s popularity.

===Impact on the Roman army===
The ancient chroniclers portray the plague as a disaster for the Roman army with the army &quot;reduced almost to extinction.&quot; This came in 166 at the beginning at the Marcomannic Wars in which Germanic tribes were invading Roman territory south of the middle Danube River in what is now the Czech Republic and Slovakia, and south to Italy. As the Roman army struggled with manpower shortages, the plague not only decimated their ranks but also weakened their strategic positions. The impact of the plague forced Marcus Aurelius to recruit and train additional soldiers from among &quot;gladiators, slaves, and bandits.&quot; After a delay of two years, in 169 the emperor launched an attack against the Germanic tribes. By 171, the Roman army had driven the invaders out of Roman territory. The war would continue sporadically until 180 when Marcus Aurelius died, possibly of the plague. This ongoing conflict contributed to a cycle of instability in the region. The plague may also have impacted the Germanic tribes.

== Climate connections ==
According to 2024 research, major plagues that significantly impacted the Roman Empire, such as the Antonine Plague, the Plague of Cyprian, and the Plague of Justinian, are strongly linked to periods of cooler and drier climate conditions, indicating that colder weather may have contributed to the spread of these diseases during that time. It is thought climate stress interacted with social and biological variables, such as food availability, rodent populations, and human migration, making populations more susceptible to disease.

<doc id="845863" wikidata="Q855504" url="?curid=845863" title="German order of battle for the invasion of Poland">
<text>This article details the order of battle of German military units during the invasion of Poland in 1939.

The German army&#x27;s forces for the invasion of Poland (codename &quot;Fall Weiss,&quot; English - &quot;Case White&quot;) were divided into Army Group North (consisting of the German 3rd and 4th armies) and Army Group South (consisting of the German 8th, 10th, and 14th armies, and the Slovak Army Group &quot;Bernolak&quot;).

Army Group C was on the western border of Germany defending against a potential French attack. This order of battle is for 04:47 on September 1, after which things started to get shuffled.

== Oberkommando des Heeres ==
&quot;Oberkommando des Heeres&quot; was the High Command of the Heer. It controlled everything related to the Heer: Personnel, Training, Recruitment, Armaments, Transportation, Supplies, Medical Services, etc. An ongoing problem was that each service branch was its own &quot;kingdom&quot; resulting in massive inefficiency.

&quot;Oberbefehlshaber des Heeres&quot; Generaloberst Walter von Brauchitsch
* &quot;Chef des Generalstab des Heeres&quot; General der Artillerie Franz Halder
:: Chief of the General Staff of the Army was the head of all of the departments of the Heer except for the armaments section and the replacement army.
* &quot;Chef der Heeresrüstung und Befehlshaber des Ersatzheeres&quot; General der Artillerie Friedrich &quot;Fritz&quot; Fromm
:: Chief of Armaments and Commander of the Replacement Army controlled all army procurement and production, and all of the troops within Germany who were replacements for front line units.

== Heeresgruppe Nord ==

Generaloberst Fedor von Bock

&quot;Heeresgruppe Nord&#x27;s initial objectives were to capture the &quot;Polish corridor&quot; (4. Armee) and drive southwards towards Warsaw from East Prussia (3. Armee)&quot;&lt;br&gt;

== Heeresgruppe C ==
Char. Generaloberst z.V. Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb

&quot;Heeresgruppe C&quot;&#x27;s only duty was to protect the western border of Germany from any French attacks until stronger units could be sent back from the east. It was accomplished by deception. The units were generally under strength, most of the infantry unit were missing their heavy weapons platoons, and some entire battalions. There was almost no mobility, except for horses and bicycles. Some of the units were headquarters only to give the impression of a larger presence.

===Kriegsmarine===
On August 30 the Polish Navy, realizing what was about to happen, sent three destroyers (&quot;Błyskawica&quot;, &quot;Grom&quot;, and &quot;Burza&quot;) to the UK. The group was spotted the 30th in the southern Baltic Sea by U 31 and again, in the Skagerrak, by U 19 on 31 August. Since the war had not started they were unmolested. With the destroyers gone some of the ships deployed to the Baltic were recalled and some sent to the North Sea. The fleet was in the process of shifting its deployment when the war broke out. Later, the submarines &quot;Orzeł&quot; and &quot;Wilk&quot; also made it to the UK, while the &quot;Sęp&quot;, &quot;Ryś&quot; and &quot;Żbik&quot;, sought internment in Sweden.

<text>In mathematics, a pedal curve of a given curve results from the orthogonal projection of a fixed point on the tangent lines of this curve. More precisely, for a plane curve &quot;C&quot; and a given fixed &quot;pedal point&quot; &quot;P&quot;, the pedal curve of &quot;C&quot; is the locus of points &quot;X&quot; so that the line &quot;PX&quot; is perpendicular to a tangent &quot;T&quot; to the curve passing through the point &quot;X&quot;. Conversely, at any point &quot;R&quot; on the curve &quot;C&quot;, let &quot;T&quot; be the tangent line at that point &quot;R&quot;; then there is a unique point &quot;X&quot; on the tangent &quot;T&quot; which forms with the pedal point &quot;P&quot; a line perpendicular to the tangent &quot;T&quot; (for the special case when the fixed point &quot;P&quot; lies on the tangent &quot;T&quot;, the points &quot;X&quot; and &quot;P&quot; coincide) – the pedal curve is the set of such points &quot;X&quot;, called the &quot;foot&quot; of the perpendicular to the tangent &quot;T&quot; from the fixed point &quot;P&quot;, as the variable point &quot;R&quot; ranges over the curve &quot;C&quot;.

Complementing the pedal curve, there is a unique point &quot;Y&quot; on the line normal to &quot;C&quot; at &quot;R&quot; so that &quot;PY&quot; is perpendicular to the normal, so &quot;PXRY&quot; is a (possibly degenerate) rectangle. The locus of points &quot;Y&quot; is called the contrapedal curve.

The orthotomic of a curve is its pedal magnified by a factor of 2 so that the center of similarity is &quot;P&quot;. This is locus of the reflection of &quot;P&quot; through the tangent line &quot;T&quot;.

The pedal curve is the first in a series of curves &quot;C&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;3, etc., where &quot;C&quot;1 is the pedal of &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;2 is the pedal of &quot;C&quot;1, and so on. In this scheme, &quot;C&quot;1 is known as the &quot;first positive pedal&quot; of &quot;C&quot;, &quot;C&quot;2 is the &quot;second positive pedal&quot; of &quot;C&quot;, and so on. Going the other direction, &quot;C&quot; is the &quot;first negative pedal&quot; of &quot;C&quot;1, the &quot;second negative pedal&quot; of &quot;C&quot;2, etc.

==Equations==

===From the Cartesian equation===
Take &quot;P&quot; to be the origin. For a curve given by the equation &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;)=0, if the equation of the tangent line at &quot;R&quot;=(&quot;x&quot;0, &quot;y&quot;0) is written in the form
:formula_1
then the vector (cos α, sin α) is parallel to the segment &quot;PX&quot;, and the length of &quot;PX&quot;, which is the distance from the tangent line to the origin, is &quot;p&quot;. So &quot;X&quot; is represented by the polar coordinates (&quot;p&quot;, α) and replacing (&quot;p&quot;, α) by (&quot;r&quot;, θ) produces a polar equation for the pedal curve.
For example, for the ellipse
:formula_2
the tangent line at &quot;R&quot;=(&quot;x&quot;0, &quot;y&quot;0) is
:formula_3
and writing this in the form given above requires that
:formula_4
The equation for the ellipse can be used to eliminate &quot;x&quot;0 and &quot;y&quot;0 giving
:formula_5
and converting to (&quot;r&quot;, θ) gives
:formula_6
as the polar equation for the pedal. This is easily converted to a Cartesian equation as
:formula_7
===From the polar equation===
For &quot;P&quot; the origin and &quot;C&quot; given in polar coordinates by &quot;r&quot; = &quot;f&quot;(θ). Let &quot;R&quot;=(&quot;r&quot;, θ) be a point on the curve and let &quot;X&quot;=(&quot;p&quot;, α) be the corresponding point on the pedal curve. Let ψ denote the angle between the tangent line and the radius vector, sometimes known as the polar tangential angle. It is given by
:formula_8
Then
:formula_9
and
:formula_10
These equations may be used to produce an equation in &quot;p&quot; and α which, when translated to &quot;r&quot; and θ gives a polar equation for the pedal curve.

For example, let the curve be the circle given by &quot;r&quot; = &quot;a&quot; cos θ. Then
:formula_11
so
:formula_12
Also
:formula_13

So the polar equation of the pedal is
:formula_14

===From the pedal equation===
The pedal equations of a curve and its pedal are closely related. If &quot;P&quot; is taken as the pedal point and the origin then it can be shown that the angle ψ between the curve and the radius vector at a point &quot;R&quot; is equal to the corresponding angle for the pedal curve at the point &quot;X&quot;. If &quot;p&quot; is the length of the perpendicular drawn from &quot;P&quot; to the tangent of the curve (i.e. &quot;PX&quot;) and &quot;q&quot; is the length of the corresponding perpendicular drawn from &quot;P&quot; to the tangent to the pedal, then by similar triangles
:formula_15
It follows immediately that the if the pedal equation of the curve is &quot;f&quot;(&quot;p&quot;,&quot;r&quot;)=0 then the pedal equation for the pedal curve is
:formula_16

From this all the positive and negative pedals can be computed easily if the pedal equation of the curve is known.

===From parametric equations===
Let
formula_17
be the vector for &quot;R&quot; to &quot;P&quot; and write
:formula_18,
the tangential and normal components of formula_19 with respect to the curve.
Then formula_20 is the vector from &quot;R&quot; to &quot;X&quot; from which the position of &quot;X&quot; can be computed.

Specifically, if &quot;c&quot; is a parametrization of the curve then
:formula_21
parametrises the pedal curve (disregarding points where &quot;c&#x27; &quot;is zero or undefined).

For a parametrically defined curve, its pedal curve with pedal point (0;0) is defined as
:formula_22

:formula_23

The contrapedal curve is given by:
:formula_24
With the same pedal point, the contrapedal curve is the pedal curve of the evolute of the given curve.

==Geometrical properties==
Consider a right angle moving rigidly so that one leg remains on the point &quot;P&quot; and the other leg is tangent to the curve. Then the vertex of this angle is &quot;X&quot; and traces out the pedal curve. As the angle moves, its direction of motion at &quot;P&quot; is parallel to &quot;PX&quot; and its direction of motion at &quot;R&quot; is parallel to the tangent &quot;T&quot; = &quot;RX&quot;. Therefore, the instant center of rotation is the intersection of the line perpendicular to &quot;PX&quot; at &quot;P&quot; and perpendicular to &quot;RX&quot; at &quot;R&quot;, and this point is &quot;Y&quot;. It follows that the tangent to the pedal at &quot;X&quot; is perpendicular to &quot;XY&quot;.

Draw a circle with diameter &quot;PR&quot;, then it circumscribes rectangle &quot;PXRY&quot; and &quot;XY&quot; is another diameter. The circle and the pedal are both perpendicular to &quot;XY&quot; so they are tangent at &quot;X&quot;. Hence the pedal is the envelope of the circles with diameters &quot;PR&quot; where &quot;R&quot; lies on the curve.

The line &quot;YR&quot; is normal to the curve and the envelope of such normals is its evolute. Therefore, &quot;YR&quot; is tangent to the evolute and the point &quot;Y&quot; is the foot of the perpendicular from &quot;P&quot; to this tangent, in other words &quot;Y&quot; is on the pedal of the evolute. It follows that the contrapedal of a curve is the pedal of its evolute.

Let &quot;C′&quot; be the curve obtained by shrinking &quot;C&quot; by a factor of 2 toward &quot;P&quot;. Then the point &quot;R′&quot; corresponding to &quot;R&quot; is the center of the rectangle &quot;PXRY&quot;, and the tangent to &quot;C′&quot; at &quot;R′&quot; bisects this rectangle parallel to &quot;PY&quot; and &quot;XR&quot;. A ray of light starting from &quot;P&quot; and reflected by &quot;C′&quot; at &quot;R&#x27; &quot;will then pass through &quot;Y&quot;. The reflected ray, when extended, is the line &quot;XY&quot; which is perpendicular to the pedal of &quot;C&quot;. The envelope of lines perpendicular to the pedal is then the envelope of reflected rays or the catacaustic of &quot;C′&quot;. This proves that the catacaustic of a curve is the evolute of its orthotomic.
As noted earlier, the circle with diameter &quot;PR&quot; is tangent to the pedal. The center of this circle is &quot;R′&quot; which follows the curve &quot;C′&quot;.

Let &quot;D′&quot; be a curve congruent to &quot;C′&quot; and let &quot;D′&quot; roll without slipping, as in the definition of a roulette, on &quot;C′&quot; so that &quot;D′&quot; is always the reflection of &quot;C′&quot; with respect to the line to which they are mutually tangent. Then when the curves touch at &quot;R′&quot; the point corresponding to &quot;P&quot; on the moving plane is &quot;X&quot;, and so the roulette is the pedal curve. Equivalently, the orthotomic of a curve is the roulette of the curve on its mirror image.

===Example===
When &quot;C&quot; is a circle the above discussion shows that the following definitions of a limaçon are equivalent:
*It is the pedal of a circle.
*It is the envelope of circles whose diameters have one endpoint on a fixed point and another endpoint which follow a circle.
*It is the envelope of circles through a fixed point whose centers follow a circle.
*It is the roulette formed by a circle rolling around a circle with the same radius.

We also have shown that the catacaustic of a circle is the evolute of a limaçon.

<text>Thomas Dadford Jr. (ca. 1761 to 1801) was an English canal engineer, who came from a family of canal engineers. He first worked with his father in the north of Britain on the Stour and the Trent, but later independently, contributing to a number of canal schemes, mainly in Monmouthshire and Glamorganshire but also in Montgomeryshire and Ellesmere, before dying at the age of 40.

==Family history==
Thomas Dadford was born in Britain around 1761, the first son of Thomas Dadford Sr. and Frances Brown, who are believed to have been living in Wolverhampton at the time. His father was a canal engineer, and his brothers John Dadford and James Dadford also worked in this field. Thomas received his early training from his father.

On 15 August 1797, he married Ann Parker of Chaddesley Corbett, Worcestershire. Both were Christians of the Catholic faith. They had no children.

The marriage did not last long, as Thomas died on 2 April 1801. He died at Crickhowell, and was buried at Llanarth, Monmouthshire. The cause of his death is not known. When he died, he left no will, but his wife obtained letters of administration in her favour; and his &quot;goods, chattels and credits&quot; amounted to £2,000.

==Working history==
His father was the engineer for the Stourbridge Canal, and from 1776 Thomas assisted him. However, he was dismissed in the following year.

In 1782 he assisted his father again, with a survey of the River Trent, which was to be improved for navigation.

His next project, from 1790, was the construction of the Glamorganshire Canal, where he worked with his father and with Thomas Sheasby. In 1790 he assisted his father and brother John with a survey for the fledgling Neath Canal Company. The following year he became the engineer for the Neath Canal, and also became surveyor and engineer for the Leominster Canal, a position which he held until 1795, simultaneously with his other projects.
He supervised the construction of the Neath Canal from Neath to Ynysbwllog, where the canal was to cross the River Neath by an aqueduct; but in 1792 he resigned before the project was completed, in order to become engineer for the Monmouthshire Canal. He was contracted to devote three-quarters of his time to the canal, the main line of which was completed by 1796, and the remaining quarter enabled him to fulfill his obligation on the Leominster Canal. In addition to the canal, he supervised construction of five tramways for the canal company, which connected to quarries, ironworks and collieries, and an independent tramway, the Trevil Rail Road. The Monmouthshire Canal Company also asked him to survey the southern section of the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal, with a view to finding a high level route which would result in most of the canal being lock-free. This he did and the route was adopted. He retained his position as engineer to the Monmouthshire Canal until late 1798.

From 1794 he assisted his brother John, who was engineer on the Montgomeryshire Canal. He was criticized by that company for his lack of attendance, but still managed to be the contractor for one section in 1795 and 1796, and to inspect and report on the final route with his father in 1797.

From January 1796 he was engineer for the Monmouthshire &amp; Brecon Canal, devoting one quarter of his time to this task, and was still acting in this capacity when he died.

His workload was prodigious, as he managed to fit in surveys for the Ellesmere Canal in 1793, a survey for the extension of the Neath Canal from Neath to Giant&#x27;s Grave in 1798, and a new survey of the proposed route for the Aberdare Canal in 1800, amongst others.

==Achievements==
During his brief working life Thomas Dadford Jr. managed to achieve a great deal. Major structures for which he was responsible include the fourteen locks on the Monmouthshire Canal at Rogerstone, the embankment at Gilwern which enables the Brecon and Abergavenny Canal to cross the River Clydach and a four-arched stone-built aqueduct which carries the same canal over the River Usk at Brynich.

He had less success with tunnels. The Southnet Tunnel on the Leominster Canal collapsed in 1795 (for which he was criticized by the engineer John Rennie), and the Ashford tunnel on the Brecon and Abergavenny Canal collapsed during construction.

<text>John Dadford was an English canal engineer, as were his father Thomas Dadford and brothers Thomas Dadford, Jr. and James Dadford. He lived from approximately 1769 to 1800, although neither date is known for certain.

==Biography==
John Dadford was the third son of the canal engineer Thomas Dadford and his wife Frances Brown, the daughter of a Wolverhampton toymaker called Samuel Brown. They lived in the Wolverhampton area, and it is probable that John was born in that area. His older brothers were Thomas and James, both of whom worked as canal engineers. He had a younger brother called William and a sister called Mary. He is known to have been a pupil at Sedgley Park Roman Catholic School between May 1778 and June 1781.

==Career==
By 1790, he was working as an engineer, assisting his father and his brother Thomas with surveys for the Neath Canal. His involvement with the construction of the Glamorganshire Canal is less certain, but quite likely. By 1792, he was working independently, surveying a route for a canal and tramway to connect the Neath Canal to the Glamorganshire Canal, and a route for a road along the Aberdare Valley. Between 1792 and 1793 he was employed as a carrier on the Glamorganshire Canal.

His next major project was the Brecknock and Abergavenny Canal. When he first surveyed the line, it was to run from the Glangrwyney Ironworks near Gilwern to the River Usk at Newbridge, near Caerleon, but the northern terminus was then extended to Brecon, and negotiations with the Monmouthshire Canal resulted in a revised line, with the two canals joining at Pontymoile. A bill was presented to Parliament in January 1793, but after its second reading, the Monmouthshire Canal succeeded in making an amendment, for a somewhat different route which had been surveyed by his brother Thomas.

An Act of Parliament to authorise the canal was obtained in March 1793, and allowed either the company or owners of collieries to build tramroads from the canal to points up to from it. Although no work on the canal had started, the company began building the Clydach Tramway, with Dadford as engineer. It used edge rails, like modern railways, which were laid on iron sleepers initially, but then on wooden sleepers. It is difficult to be certain which sections Dadford was responsible for, with Hadfield describing a tramroad from Gelli-felen colliery to Gilwern, which then crossed the River Usk to reach Glangrwyne, where iron from Ebbw Vale was worked in a forge Skempton describes a tramroad from Llangroiney &quot;[Glangrwyne]&quot; to Gellifelen, and a second section from Gellifelen to Fossalog, near Nantyglo, while Gladwin and Gladwin describe a route from Llammarch Colliery to Clydach Ironworks. Dadford&#x27;s bridge over the Usk collapsed in February 1795, when the river was in flood, and the fact that he had not built flood relief culverts into the embankments on either side of the bridge was deemed to have been a contributory factor in its failure.
In July 1794, he became the engineer for the Montgomeryshire Canal, which extended the Llanymynech Branch of the Ellesmere Canal from its terminus at Llanymynech to Newtown. It had been authorised in March 1794, and John was to be assisted by his brother Thomas. The route involved crossing the River Vyrnwy, where a five-arched aqueduct was built, each with a span of , and crossing the River Rhiw at Berriew, where two arches spanned the river, and there were two more arches on the land. One of the arches of the Vyrnwy aqueduct collapsed, and there were troubles with the Rhiw aqueduct. He resigned in July 1796 and emigrated to America. On his brother&#x27;s suggestion, he was replaced by his father. The committee were critical of the Dadfords, but when they called in William Jessop to advise them, he suggested that such issues were merely teething problems, and were quite normal on such a project.

==Legacy==
It is not known what Dadford did after emigrating, and he was not mentioned in his father&#x27;s will in 1809, which probably indicates that he died there before then. Despite the failure of some of his bridges, he was highly regarded, with the Monmouthshire Canal requesting that if anyone was sent down to inspect the works, they would prefer John Dadford to anyone else.

<text>Storsjön (, ) is the fifth largest lake in Sweden, with an area of and a greatest depth of . It is the largest lake in central Sweden, located in the province of Jämtland in modern Jämtland County. From Storsjön runs the river Indalsälven and the lake contains the major island Frösön. The city of Östersund is located on the east shore of the lake, opposite Frösön.

Storsjön is said to be the home of Storsjöodjuret, a cryptid lake monster not unlike the Loch Ness Monster, and every now and then there are new reports of people having spotted it. Descriptions of the creature have varied over the years. Some have described it as being serpentine in appearance, with multiple humps, a feline or canine-like head and grayish skin. Others have claimed that the creature is short in stature and morbidly obese, with a roundish skull.

The ferry company &quot;Vägverket Färjerederiet&quot; (run by the Swedish Road Authority) provides two ferry lines crossing the lake, one from Norderön to Håkansta and one from Isön to Norderön. They are replaced by ice roads during the winter, usually January–April.

<doc id="845883" wikidata="Q1738867" url="?curid=845883" title="Kenneth Halliwell">
<text>Kenneth Leith Halliwell (23 June 1926 – 9 August 1967) was a British actor, writer and collagist. He was the mentor, boyfriend and murderer of playwright Joe Orton.

== Childhood ==
Halliwell was born in Bebington near Liverpool. He was very close to his mother; when he was 11, he witnessed her death from a wasp sting at their family home.

Halliwell was a classics scholar at Wirral Grammar School, where he gained his Higher School Certificate in 1943. Eligible for military service in 1944, he registered as a conscientious objector, and was exempted conditional upon becoming a coal miner. After discharge in 1946, he acted for a time in Scotland and then returned home to act in Birkenhead. His father committed suicide in 1949 by inhaling coal-gas in a gas oven; Halliwell was the first to find the body the following morning, but he &quot;stepped over the body, put the kettle on, made a cup of tea and had a shave&quot; before he reported the death. Halliwell later moved to London to study drama at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art (RADA), having inherited the family fortune.

== Relationship with Orton ==
In 1951, Halliwell met fellow RADA student Joe Orton. Both men were struggling actors who became struggling writers; their common interests led to a lengthy romantic relationship. Halliwell, in the early years, seems to have been something of a mentor to Orton, who had had a rather cursory education, and helped to mould the writing style that would later be called &quot;Ortonesque&quot;. The two men collaborated on several novels, including &quot;The Boy Hairdresser&quot;, which were not published until after their deaths.

From January 1959, Orton and Halliwell were involved in the theft and defacement of public library books. Halliwell became an illicit collage artist, while Orton wrote the fake blurbs for the flyleaf of the dust jackets. After their trial in 1962 the two men were given custodial sentences: Halliwell was sent to HM Prison Ford in Sussex for six months and Orton went to Eastchurch in Kent.

Orton&#x27;s eventual success as a writer, which began not long after their release from prison, put a distance between the two men that Halliwell found difficult to handle. Towards the end of his life, Halliwell was on regular courses of anti-depressants.

== Murder–suicide ==
On 9 August 1967, Halliwell mortally injured Orton with nine hammer blows to the head, then overdosed on pentobarbital (Nembutal) sleeping pills. Halliwell died first. Their bodies were discovered late the following morning, when a chauffeur arrived at the door of their Noel Road flat in Islington to collect Orton for a meeting with director Richard Lester to discuss filming options on &quot;Up Against It&quot;, an unproduced script by Orton, written in 1967 for the Beatles.

Halliwell&#x27;s suicide note referred to the contents of Orton&#x27;s diary as an explanation for his actions:
If you read his diary, all will be explained. KH PS: Especially the latter part.
This is presumed to be a reference to Orton&#x27;s description of his promiscuity; the diary contains numerous incidents of cottaging in public lavatories and other casual sexual encounters.

== In popular culture ==
In &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot;, the 1987 film based on Orton&#x27;s life, Halliwell was portrayed by Alfred Molina.

In &quot;Fantabulosa!&quot;, the 2006 television play about Kenneth Williams, he was portrayed by Ewan Bailey.

British experimental music group Coil recorded three tracks titled &quot;The Halliwell Hammers&quot; for their 1995 album &quot;Worship the Glitch&quot;. The two primary members of Coil, John Balance and Peter Christopherson, were romantic partners through most of the band&#x27;s existence, and much of their work was inspired by or dedicated to gay icons and personalities of the past.

Halliwell is the subject of a monologue, &quot;Especially The Latter Part&quot;, by Richard Ely. It premiered in Lichfield, in 2009.

The stage version of &quot;Prick Up Your Ears&quot;, written by Simon Bent, opened on the West End in London at the Comedy Theatre on 17 September 2009. Matt Lucas played Halliwell and Chris New played Orton. Con O&#x27;Neill took over the role of Halliwell after Lucas pulled out. The play closed on 15 November 2009.

In 2014, a collage by Halliwell was purchased by Islington Museum at auction for £2,800. In 2016 the same museum purchased at auction &quot;The Cat Screen&quot;, a four-panel described as &quot;an important part of 1960s cultural history as well as an engaging piece of art work&quot;, for £8,000.

<doc id="845890" wikidata="Q3085838" url="?curid=845890" title="François Simiand">
<text>François Joseph Charles Simiand (18 April 1873 – 13 April 1935) was a French sociologist and economist best known as a participant in the Année Sociologique. As a member of the French Historical School of economics, Simiand predicated a rigorous factual and statistical basis for theoretical models and policies. His contribution to French social science was recognized in 1931 when, at the age of 58, he was elected to the faculty of the Collège de France and accepted the chair in labor history.

Simiand&#x27;s career was unusual. Like many destined to become influential academics in France, he entered the École Normale Supérieure and graduated in philosophy at the top of his class in 1896. However, he quickly became interested in law and economics and submitted a thesis on the wages of coal miners in France (1904) to the faculty of law rather than becoming an academic. As a result, he foreclosed forever the possibility of a prominent university appointment. Thus in 1901 he became the librarian for the French Ministries of Commerce and Labor, a post he held until the outbreak of World War I. From 1910 on he also taught Economic History at the École Pratique des Hautes Etudes, an institution which did not require a doctorate from its lecturers.

Toward the end of the nineteenth century Simiand joined the editorial board of the &quot;Année Sociologique&quot;. He became a central member of the group as editor of the economic sociology section and served as its expert on statistics. At the same time, as someone removed from the politics of French academics, he was at an institutional remove from Émile Durkheim&#x27;s ambitions for transforming the French university.

Simiand moved further into the administrative apparatus of the French state during World War I when he left his position as a librarian for work in the Ministry of Armaments where he played a prominent role in making policy. After the war, he served for a year as the Director of Labor for the province of Alsace-Lorraine. In addition, he took up a more permanent position as a teacher at the Conservatoire National des Arts et Métiers.

A student of Henri Bergson and Émile Durkheim, Simiand advanced a view of economics as a social science grounded in observable phenomena rather than convenient assumptions. This would imply a large program of historical and statistical research. Joseph Schumpeter, who denied the existence of a French or an Italian Historical School despite the historical current evident in their economics, acknowledged the significance of Simiand&#x27;s contributions. In Schumpeter&#x27;s view, Simiand should be considered a French Institutionalist.

Simiand&#x27;s views on scope and method, which appear in &quot;La Méthode positive en science économique&quot; (1911), were applied in his studies of real wages, money and long economic cycles. They were applied in criticism of the work of contemporary economists, as well.

<text>Simon Carmiggelt (; 7 October 191330 November 1987) was a Dutch writer, journalist, and poet who became a well known public figure in the Netherlands because of his daily newspaper columns and his television appearances.

==Biography==
Simon Johannes Carmiggelt was born on 7 October 1913 in The Hague, the second son of Herman Carmiggelt and Adriana Bik. He had one older brother, Jan (Johannes Simon). Simon did poorly in school and he left secondary school in 1929. He enjoyed working as an editor for the school paper though, and he was determined to become a journalist.

After various editorial jobs, he became a reporter for the socialist newspaper &quot;Het Volk&quot; (&quot;The People&quot;). Later on he worked for the same paper as a drama critic. He wrote short columns about daily life in The Hague, which he called &quot;Kleinigheden&quot; (&quot;Trifles&quot;). In 1939 Simon married Tiny de Goey. A year later she gave birth to a daughter, Marianne. In the same year the first collection of Kleinigheden was published, named &quot;Vijftig dwaasheden&quot; (&quot;Fifty follies&quot;).

When Nazi Germany invaded the Netherlands in 1940 and &quot;Het Volk&quot; was taken over and censored, Carmiggelt resigned from the paper. During the Second World War he had all sorts of small jobs, but he secretly got in touch with the Dutch resistance and worked for the underground newspaper &quot;Het Parool&quot; (&quot;The Password&quot;). He was responsible for the lay-out and printing of the paper. He wrote a few stories for &quot;Het Parool&quot;.

Under the German occupation of the Netherlands, Simon&#x27;s brother Jan was arrested by the Nazis in 1943 for aiding persons in hiding. He was taken to Herzogenbusch concentration camp, where he died of exhaustion on 26 September 1943. Jan&#x27;s death was to change the rest of Simon&#x27;s life; he would never fully overcome the trauma it caused.

After the war he again started to write columns for &quot;Het Parool&quot;; he signed them with the pen name &quot;Kronkel&quot; (&quot;Twist&quot;, or &quot;Kink&quot;). His &quot;Kronkels&quot; became known for their melancholic, sometimes sombre tone and the ironic use of formal language. Many columns were about unsuccessful, disillusioned people in cafes and bars (often in Amsterdam, where he then lived), who told the writer about their lives. Carmiggelt wrote about his children and later his grandchildren, his cats and other small events in his life. His work became popular and he received various Dutch literary prizes. Together with the Dutch-Indo author and essayist Tjalie Robinson he is credited with establishing a whole new genre in Dutch literature that found successors like Rudy Kousbroek.

In 1977 Carmiggelt started an affair with author Renate Rubinstein. She wrote a book about this, titled &quot;Mijn beter ik&quot; (My better self), which was published when both she and Simon had died. Carmiggelt&#x27;s last Kronkel was published in 1983. On 30 November 1987 he died of a heart attack. A year after his death, a statue of Carmiggelt (made by Kees Verkade) was placed near his former house in Amsterdam and one of him and his wife on a park bench near his summer house in De Steeg (Rheden). This last statue was stolen in the weekend of 21 January 2012. It was retrieved on 25 January, sawn into many pieces. Three men have been arrested in relation to this event; the motive is still unclear. The statue was pieced together by the sculptor Wik Kuijl and then re-unveiled in its original site on 23 January 2013.

<text>John Grubb Parke (September 22, 1827 – December 16, 1900) was a United States Army engineer and a Union general in the American Civil War. Parke&#x27;s Civil War service was closely associated with Ambrose E. Burnside, often serving him as chief of staff in major engagements such as Antietam, Fredericksburg and the Overland Campaign. Parke also held significant field commands during Burnside&#x27;s North Carolina Expedition, Vicksburg and the battle of Fort Stedman as well as brief stints in command of the Army of the Potomac. From 1887 to 1889, John G. Parke was the Superintendent of the United States Military Academy.

==Early life==
Parke was born in Coatesville, Chester County, Pennsylvania, to Francis G. and Sarah Parke. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1849 and was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the Corps of Topographical Engineers. As an engineer, he determined the boundary lines between Iowa and the Little Colorado River, surveyed routes for a railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, and served as the chief surveyor of the party charged with the delineation of the boundary of the northwest United States and the Province of Canada, 1857–1861.

==Civil War==
At the start of the Civil War, Parke was appointed brigadier general of volunteers and commanded a brigade in the operations on the North Carolina coast in early 1862. He received a brevet promotion for the Battle of Fort Macon and was promoted to major general of volunteers on July 18, 1862.

In the Army of the Potomac, Parke served briefly as commander of 3rd Division, IX Corps. Then he served as chief of staff to Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside during the battles of Antietam and Fredericksburg. He assumed command of the IX Corps and was sent to the Western Theater for the Vicksburg Campaign. Parke then was Burnside&#x27;s chief of staff in the Army of the Ohio in the defense of Knoxville.

Parke served as chief of staff to Burnside during the Overland Campaign, in which the latter commanded IX Corps, as well as in the beginning stages of the Siege of Petersburg. After the Battle of the Crater, Burnside was relieved of command and Parke assumed command of the IX Corps. He led it at the Battle of Globe Tavern, the Battle of Peebles&#x27; Farm, and the Battle of Boydton Plank Road.

In 1865, while Army of the Potomac commander Maj. Gen. George G. Meade was in a conference, Parke, being senior officer, was acting commander of the army during the Battle of Fort Stedman until Meade returned to the field. He led the IX Corps through the fall of Petersburg and the Appomattox Campaign. In 1865 he was appointed brevet major general in the regular army in recognition of his service at Fort Stedman.
==Postbellum career==
After the Confederate surrender, Parke commanded IX Corps in the Department of Washington. He also briefly commanded XXII Corps. Parke was mustered out of the volunteer service on January 15, 1866. He served as an engineer, being promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel on March 4, 1879. Parke attained the rank of colonel on March 17, 1884. He served as superintendent of the United States Military Academy from August 28, 1887, to June 24, 1889, and he retired from the Army on July 2 of that year.

Parke wrote several reports on public improvements and exploration of the west. He also served as a cartographer, publishing maps of the New Mexico Territory and California.
Parke died in Washington, D.C., leaving a wife, Ellen, but no children. He is buried in the churchyard of Church of St. James the Less in Philadelphia.

A Pennsylvania state historical marker outside Coatesville commemorates Parke as a surveyor and West Point superintendent.

<text>Send More Paramedics is an English zombie film-influenced crossover thrash band from Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. They are named after a line in the film &quot;Return of the Living Dead&quot;.

==Biography==
The name is a reference to a line in the 1985 horror/comedy &quot;Return of the Living Dead&quot;. The band originally formed as a side project of Leeds emo band And None of Them Knew They were Robots, but have gained a higher profile than And None of Them Knew They Were Robots, who have since split up.

The band played in the 1980s crossover style, described as &quot;Zombiecore...a fusion of 80s thrash and modern hardcore punk&quot;, with lyrics about zombies and cannibalism, and were heavily influenced by zombie movies. On stage, they dressed as zombies and the drummer donned a Mexican wrestling mask (a homage to the character in Brian Clement&#x27;s Meat Market films with whom he also shares the name El Diablo). As part of this on-stage persona, band members claimed to be members of the living dead.

The band performed at the 2005 Download Festival, the 2006 Reading and Leeds Festivals, were one of the first acts confirmed for 2006&#x27;s Damnation Festival and were the opening act for Avenged Sevenfold at the Camden Underworld. They also toured as support to The Offspring. Their live show was described by Drowned in Sound as &quot;brilliantly ghoulish&quot; and &quot;mouth-agape entertainment of the highest quality&quot;.

Disc 2 of their 2006 album, &quot;The Awakening&quot;, is a concept disc, a zombie movie soundtrack, similar to the soundtrack in George A. Romero&#x27;s &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot;.

They won the &#x27;fresh meat&#x27; competition on Zane Lowe&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show, leading to a &quot;Guerilla Gig Live&quot; performance on BBC Three. The video for which has recently been re-uploaded to YouTube.

The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Awakening&quot;, featured guest appearances from Jeff Walker and Ken Owen from Carcass.

The band announced their impending split in a Myspace blog in June 2007, which read:

The band briefly reformed in early 2014 to play TDON 10, a one-day indoor festival celebrating 10 years of &#x27;Thirty Days of Night Records&#x27;, also on the bill were; Azriel, Everette, Crossbreaker, Broken Teeth, Martyr Defiled, Grader, Public Domain, Iron Witch, Opium Lord, and Set Astray. They also performed two other shows in a short run. Complete dates as follows:

&quot;Live For Never – 2014&quot;

11th April – Leeds, Wharf Chambers (Secret warm-up gig) – Support from: ATTACK! VIPERS and Iron Witch

12th April – Leeds, Vox (TDON 10)

10th May – Camden Barfly – Support from: Pure Graft and The Dead Anyways

<doc id="845904" wikidata="Q3044061" url="?curid=845904" title="Project 86">
<text>Project 86 is an American rock band from Orange County, California, formed in 1996. The band has released twelve albums, which have collectively sold nearly 500,000 units worldwide, two EPs, two DVDs, and one live album.

In 1998, BEC Recordings released a self-titled debut album that was well received by critics and consumers. Their second release, &quot;Drawing Black Lines&quot;, garnered attention from mainstream record labels; Atlantic licensed the album from Tooth &amp; Nail Records, the parent company of BEC. The band&#x27;s third release, &quot;Truthless Heroes&quot;, was released exclusively by Atlantic, after the band was bought-out of their original deal with Tooth &amp; Nail. The band parted ways with Atlantic shortly after their third release, upon which they had a short stint as an independent. The band then negotiated a new contract with Tooth &amp; Nail, and subsequently released three more albums, the last one being &quot;Picket Fence Cartel&quot; in summer 2009. After fulfilling their last agreement with T&amp;N, in December 2011 the band announced a Kickstarter campaign via their official website and Facebook page, stating that &quot;the fans are now our record label.&quot; Their eighth studio release, &quot;Wait for the Siren&quot;, was released in 2012. Their ninth album, &quot;Knives to the Future&quot;, was independently released by Team Black Recordings in 2014.

== History ==

===1996–1999: Formation and self-titled debut===
According to the official Project 86 documentary &quot;XV,&quot; Project 86 formed in mid 1996 by vocalist Andrew Schwab in Orange County, California. Guitarist Randy Torres, who was a sophomore in high school, was the first member recruited. The original lineup included Schwab, Torres, Ethan Luck (Demon Hunter, Relient K), and bassist Matt Hernandez (Unashamed, The Dingees). Drummer Alex Albert was added when Hernandez left the band after a few rehearsals, then Luck moved to bass from drums. Luck left the band to join The Dingees in Summer 1997, after which high school senior Steven Dail joined in late 1997.

Schwab comments in a 2004 interview regarding the number 86 in the band name: &quot;The generation before us used that phrase to describe when they would reject or remove something...Project 86 is like the whole idea of being rejected, or separate, or not going along with the current.&quot; The group did not travel much initially; they decided to hone their sound and live performances before embarking on tours. In 1997, Project 86 was voted one of the top independent acts of the year by &quot;HM magazine&quot; readers. At Tomfest the same year, their performance was a big hit and Tooth &amp; Nail Records, became interested and subsequently signed them.

Bryan Carlstrom produced their self-titled debut. He had engineered albums by multi-platinum outfits The Offspring and Alice in Chains as well as producing labelmates Stavesacre . Schwab drew upon personal struggles he was experiencing at the time to write meaningful lyrics. Sonny Sandoval, lead singer of nu metal group P.O.D., appeared as a guest performer. The album was released in June 1998 and was well received. It sold over 50,000 copies to date and gained mainstream exposure on MTV shows &quot;Road Rules&quot; and &quot;The Real World&quot;. &quot;Project 86&quot; was observed by Allmusic to be the &quot;most daring album at the time for its genre&quot;. The success of their debut made Project 86 a top seller for BEC/Tooth and Nail. The band embarked on a pioneering tour called &quot;The Warriors Come Out and Play Tour&quot; in May 1999 with friends P.O.D. and Blindside as the middle slot, which drew crowds of 600-1000 across the nation.

===2000–2003: &quot;Drawing Black Lines&quot; and &quot;Truthless Heroes&quot;===
 The group worked on their sophomore record with producer Garth &quot;GGGarth&quot; Richardson. in Vancouver, BC. Schwab wrote lyrics about a wider variety of issues, rather than just focusing on personal expression with their sophomore release: &quot;The new album deals a lot less with me, and more with the world around us; Issues in people, society, culture&quot;. The sound was heavier and more progressive, with more hints of melody as well. As soon as the album was finished it garnered interest from several major labels, and Atlantic records licensed the album for co-release with Tooth and Nail/BEC in March 2000. &quot;Drawing Black Lines&quot; peaked at No. 37 on Heatseekers, and was well received by critics. By this time, listeners in the band had begun to amass a sizable fanbase. Despite heavy reliance on tour dates and word of mouth to inform people of its release, the album experienced some commercial success when it eventually sold nearly 120,000 copies. The band added Cory Edelmann, previously of No Innocent Victim, after the album was finished. Project 86 traveled nationwide with P.O.D., Hed PE, and Linkin Park on the &quot;Kings of the Game&quot; tour in October 2000. They also played a string of shows with Queensrÿche.

In 2002, Project 86 teamed with Slayer producer Matt Hyde to record their next album. The record was envisioned as a critique of post-9/11 America and the music industry. Formatted as a concept album, it told the story of a character attempting to find fulfillment in modern culture. &quot;Songs were written and assembled with a certain ebb and flow in mind,&quot; said Schwab, &quot;I approached the album like writing chapters in a book.&quot; The group spent over 14 months recording demos for Atlantic, which invested nearly $1,000,000 in the project when it was all said and done. Because of the pressure to produce radio singles, the sound of the album was quite different from its previous releases, as was Schwab&#x27;s cryptic lyrics, which represented the frustrations of being stifled creatively and feeling powerless in the process. 
&quot;Truthless Heroes&quot; was released in September 2002 and peaked at No. 146 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Their first and only single, &quot;Hollow Again&quot;, peaked at No. 35 on Mainstream Rock Tracks. Atlantic refused to release the second single because they claimed the lyrics conflicted with the Iraq War effort. While lauded by critics for its pounding criticism of the media and entertainment industry, the album proved to be controversial, particularly the promotional website. The group performed with Taproot on their self-titled tour in fall 2002. In addition, they played shows with Thirty Seconds to Mars, Trapt, Blindside, Trust Company, Sevendust, and Finger Eleven.

===2003–2006: &quot;Songs to Burn Your Bridges By&quot; and &quot;...And the Rest Will Follow&quot;===

In mid-2003 the band parted ways with Atlantic and their management team. The departure from Atlantic, in particular, was a big disappointment for the band. &quot;All of the hype about our future successes turned out to be just that – hype, &quot; said Schwab in an interview, &quot;We did not go platinum [...] the record fell short of expectations and did not come close to the impact of our previous effort.&quot; Project 86 then started an independent label called &quot;Team Black Recordings&quot;. Work began on a new album after Hyde was convinced to produce again. Their fourth album, &quot;Songs to Burn Your Bridges By&quot;, was made available exclusively on their website in Fall 2003.

The following year, Project 86 re-signed with their previous label, Tooth and Nail. &quot;Songs to Burn Your Bridges By&quot; was re-released in June 2004. The new version included 3 new tracks produced by Aaron Sprinkle and mixed by J.R. McNeely, several new mixes, and featured new artwork. The release peaked at No. 36 on Heatseekers, and was met with positive reviews by critics. According to Schwab, the album was a return to the bands heavier roots, and a means to express the frustrations the band went through during Truthless Heroes. The group performed at Purple Door, a Christian music festival, later that year. When Project 86 played their set, moshers threw mud everywhere and covered the stage and musical equipment. Thousands of dollars worth of musical equipment was damaged.

In Spring 2005, Project 86 reunited with &quot;Drawing Black Lines&quot; producer Garth Richardson to record their fifth album, &quot;...And the Rest Will Follow&quot;. After spending several days recording demos, the band flew to Vancouver, British Columbia, to record at The Farm Studios Compound. The band filmed the entire production and later released a DVD documentary entitled &quot;Subject to Change: The Making of ...And the Rest Will Follow&quot;. The album marked a spiritual change for the group who felt humbled by their past experiences. &quot;The record is about growing up and becoming a man and taking responsibility for your past mistakes,&quot; said Schwab, &quot;[We are] refocusing our goals back to what they were when we started, reaching kids and inspiring them to live lives with hope and purpose.&quot;

To promote the album, Project 86 released a new song on PureVolume every Monday until the release date. &quot;...And the Rest Will Follow&quot; was released in September 2005 and debuted at No. 131 on the Billboard 200. Critics were positive about the release. The band began a fall release tour and traveled with Spoken, Number One Gun, The Fold, and Mourning September. In January 2006, a live performance of the single &quot;My Will Be A Dead Man&quot; was broadcast on &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot;.

===2007–2008: &quot;Rival Factions&quot;, &quot;The Kane Mutiny EP&quot;, and &quot;This Time of Year EP&quot;===

In March 2007, Project 86 announced that Alex Albert had parted with the band on friendly terms to pursue other interests. Instead of searching for a full-time replacement, the band recruited Jason Gerken, formerly of Shiner, to play drums on the record. Production of their sixth album, entitled &quot;Rival Factions&quot;, followed suit with Deftones engineer Ulrich Wild. The album proved to be a large departure from their edgier material by sporting a distinct 1980s sound influenced by goth rock.

In the end, 40 songs were amassed for the new record, but only ten were used. According to Schwab, the album&#x27;s title was chosen to represent &quot;the tension that exists in everybody [...] the flesh and the spirit.&quot; It was also representative of their new musical direction, an attempt to polarize themselves from other heavy rock acts. Similarly to their last record, a documentary was filmed that detailed the recording process, entitled &quot;I Want Something You Have: Rival Factions The DVD&quot;.

&quot;Rival Factions&quot; was released in June 2007 and peaked at No. 124 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, the band&#x27;s highest debut to date. The record sold 6,000 copies in the first week and was well received by critics, who made favorable comparisons to Duran Duran, Billy Idol, and the Killers. The band proceeded to tour with labelmates MXPX, Showbread, and Sullivan on the summer &quot;Tooth &amp; Nail Tour&quot;. A performance also took place at the annual Christmas Rock Night event in Ennepetal, Germany, that December.
Several tracks were recorded and mixed that were not included on &quot;Rival Factions&quot;. These songs were compiled with their previous remixes to form an EP. A cover of &quot;Lucretia, My Reflection&quot; by the Sisters of Mercy was also included. &quot;The Kane Mutiny EP&quot; was released exclusively on iTunes in November 2007. Shortly after its release, the band uploaded a cover of &quot;This Time of the Year&quot; by Brenda Lee on iTunes. &quot;Our version was a little bit more like &quot;A Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; ,&quot; declared Schwab. The single was well received and led Project 86 to build an entire EP around the Christmas concept. &quot;This Time of Year EP&quot; was released in November 2008. Unlike the previous EP, &quot;This Time of Year&quot; was made available in digital and physical formats. Jason Martin of indie rock outfit Starflyer 59 helped record both albums.

===2009–2012: &quot;Picket Fence Cartel&quot; and &quot;XV Live&quot;===
In early 2009, the band returned to the studio with Martin and Ulrich Wild to record their seventh album, &quot;Picket Fence Cartel&quot;. Time was spent leisurely crafting the album; previous endeavors had been limited by deadlines. &quot;This time around, we said, &#x27;Look, let&#x27;s not just put out another record,&#x27;&quot; said Schwab, &quot;&#x27;Let&#x27;s make sure we get the record to a place that we&#x27;re happy with it.&#x27;&quot; The band focused on a heavy metal sound. However, they did not entirely jettison their 1980s influences as synthesizers percolated several songs. Schwab&#x27;s lyrics focused on his belief that power and corruption often &quot;run hand-in-hand when it comes to human souls.&quot; &quot;The world is teaching us that fame is to be sought after; that recognition will equal success, fortune and, ultimately, peace,&quot; he said, &quot;But the search for and attainment of fame and wealth usually destroy us in the end.&quot;

The record was released in July 2009 and peaked at No. 137 on the Billboard 200. Critics praised the title for its barrage of heavy rock and spiritually minded lyrics. Later that summer, Project 86 traveled nationwide on the &quot;Scream the Prayer Tour&quot; with metalcore outfits The Chariot, Haste the Day, and Gwen Stacy. Coming mid-October, Project 86 started the &quot;Picket Fence Cartel Tour&quot; with Children 18:3, Showbread, The Wedding, and Yearling, and added a second part in spring 2010 with Flatfoot 56 and Wavorly. The band released their first live album, entitled &quot;XV Live&quot;, in December 2010 to commemorate their 15th anniversary. The album&#x27;s songs spanned every studio album with the exception of the first.

Randy Torres, who had been gradually becoming less involved in the band over the previous several albums, decided to leave the band in late 2008 to work for Tooth and Nail records, and later, Microsoft. Steven Dail followed suit approximately one year later, citing the need to stop touring and be home with his family. 

=== 2012–2013: &quot;Wait for the Siren&quot; ===
Project 86 launched a Kickstarter campaign in December 2011 in an effort to &quot;Make the fans the record label&quot; after fulfilling their most recent contract with Tooth and Nail Records. Their eighth studio album titled &quot;Wait for the Siren&quot; was recorded in January and February 2012.

&quot;Wait for the Siren&quot; was recorded and produced independently through fan support via the band&#x27;s 2011-2012 Kickstarter campaign. On May 24, 2012, Project 86 released four preview tracks for the tracks &quot;Fall, Goliath Fall&quot;, &quot;Sots&quot;, &quot;Off the Grid&quot;, and &quot;Take the Hill&quot;.

The album was officially released on August 20, 2012.

=== 2014–2016: &quot;Knives to the Future&quot; ===

In late 2013, Project 86 announced that they were about to work on their ninth album which will also be released independently. He also said they will also do an acoustic EP plus Andrew Schwab will also release a solo album which will also be produced independently. They started an Indiegogo funding campaign on Feb 11 and closed on April 12, 2014 (11:59 pm PT). They successfully got US$89,816 raised of a goal of $50,000.

Schwab announced that pre-production for a new album began on June 6 followed by a month-long recording session in Steelman Studios in Van Nuys, CA. Matt McClellan and the band collaborated on production and Steve Evetts mixed the album. Dan Mumford was scheduled to do the artwork. The band spent the middle of the year in Los Angeles recording 18 new tracks including an acoustic EP. With a career spanning nearly 20 years and selling over half a million records Andrew Schwab feels this album is a special landmark for P86. He says, &quot;We have loved pushing the envelope of evolution on every Project 86 release and this record is no exception. The inspiration behind this record is completely different and it&#x27;s been incredible to write and record with such a talented group of guys.&quot;. Joining Schwab in the studio is Darren King (The Overseer) on guitar, Cody Driggers (The Wedding) on bass, and Ryan Wood (7 Horns 7 Eyes) on drums.

Project 86 announced the title of their album to be &quot;Knives to the Future&quot; and was released on November 11, 2014. &quot;Spirit of Shiloh&quot;, the first song from the album, debuted on SoundCloud.

In 2016, the band started a celebration for their 20th anniversary. They announced that they would release a new record and when supporting their PledgeMusic campaign, they sent an EP to all pledgers, titled &quot;Influence EP&quot;, which consists of cover songs of bands that all influenced them. On September 13, 2016, the band announced their 20th anniversary tour with support from Death Therapy.

=== 2017–2024: &quot;Sheep Among Wolves&quot; and &quot;Omni&quot; ===
From October 2016 to October 2017, while the band was writing and recording new music, they released eight new songs total for pledgers who pre-ordered new album on PledgeMusic. On October 9, 2017, it was announced that a new album, &quot;Sheep Among Wolves&quot;, was to be officially released on December 5, 2017, in celebration of their 20th anniversary as a band. The album featured a three-piece lineup of Schwab, King, and Wolves at the Gate and The Overseer drummer Abishai Collingsworth.

In 2021, the band announced that their upcoming 11th studio album would be their last. On December 15, 2022, the first single for the album, &quot;Metatropolis&quot;, was released, along with the album&#x27;s name, &quot;Omni&quot;, as well as the announcement that it would be a double album, with Pt. 1 a full length and Pt. 2 two EPs. On January 20, 2023, the band released a second single for the album, &quot;0 &gt; 1&quot;. After a third single, &quot;Virtual Signal&quot;, was released, Project 86 released &quot;Omni, Pt. 1&quot; on March 24, 2023. Pt. 2 was slated for release on March 1, 2024, with the first single, &quot;Ultraviolent&quot;, dropping on December 1, 2023. However, the album&#x27;s release was moved early to January 12, 2024.

Despite the promotion of &quot;Omni&quot; as the band&#x27;s last, in an interview with &quot;Heaven&#x27;s Metal&quot; magazine, Andrew Schwab divulged that Project 86 would be rebranded P86:Omni with the new shift in genre, ending the former incarnation of the band and beginning the new one.

== Musical style==
For most of their career, Project 86&#x27;s music was characterized by heavy rock and Schwab&#x27;s &quot;loud, eerie, and atmospheric&quot; vocal style. Their sound has been likened to rock groups Helmet, Rage Against the Machine, and Tool. The adjective &quot;intense&quot; has frequently been used as a description. Rick Anderson of Allmusic called the music &quot;dense and crunchy&quot;, while &quot;Albuquerque Journal&quot; writer Ron Gonzales declared it a &quot;blisteringly heavy sound.&quot; Commenting on their musical style, Schwab said, &quot;Our goal as a band has been to never make the same record twice. The only rule is that there are no rules. If there is a rule, it&#x27;s that we try not to over-think things, that the music that comes out is honest and real, spontaneous and from our heart.&quot; 

When Project 86 released their self-titled record, they were generally acknowledged to be a rapcore band. Schwab has maintained it was never intentional, &quot;I think we got lumped in with that music because we [had] toured with P.O.D. and Linkin Park.&quot; According to writer Mark Allan Powell, the music featured &quot;cryptic, down-tuned guitars&quot; and &quot;half-spoken, half-rapped&quot; vocals. &quot;Drawing Black Lines&quot; saw their style adopt elements of traditional metal, groove metal, and hard rock. The band used their song &quot;Pipedream&quot; as a blueprint to build the album: &quot;We knew that was one of the brightest spots on the album,&quot; said Schwab, &quot;I just wanted to take what we did in &#x27;Pipedream&#x27; and go further with it&quot;. Experimentation with noise occurred in track &quot;Twenty-Three&quot;, and would be revisited on their fourth album with &quot;Circuitry&quot;.

&quot;Truthless Heroes&quot; and &quot;Songs To Burn Your Bridges By&quot; generally focused on a &quot;dark, rock musical direction&quot;. The group strayed from the style for their fifth album &quot;...And The Rest Will Follow&quot;, opting to flirt with melodies and harmonies. &quot;Rival Factions&quot; marked a great departure when they embraced 1980s music and utilized keyboards. Their signature hardcore sound was reinstated for &quot;Picket Fence Cartel&quot;. &quot;We have had a great time adding more melody along the way,&quot; insisted Schwab, &quot;but in our hearts, we still really enjoy playing aggressive songs&quot;. Even so, some songs retained synthesizers while others boasted folk influences.
The band&#x27;s 2023 album &quot;Omni, Pt. 1&quot; saw the band transition from their alternative hard rock to metalcore with heavy industrial and djent elements; Schwab&#x27;s vocal style for this genre change transformed from expressive yelling into a vicious gritty roar. Talking about the dramatic shift in genre with &quot;Sound In the Signals&quot;, Schwab said, &quot;To be honest, I had a hankering to take the sound of the band in a heavier direction for a very long time, really, since &quot;Drawing Black Lines&quot; was released—we knew that people who were familiar with the band would be excited, and I personally couldn’t wait to see the reactions. The most common comment [I get] is, &#x27;Who is the guest vocalist?&#x27; Many people said this because I took a heavier approach with the vocals this time around; instead of my typical shout, I went more death metal. Many were surprised by this, but I actually have sung this way live for about a decade.&quot; Another reason for Schwab shifting the band&#x27;s genre was professional throat care he underwent during the COVID-19 pandemic, to get rid of a nodule he had developed as far back as &quot;Truthless Heroes&quot;. This allowed him to experiment with vocal styles, which led to the genre shift. 

===Influences===
Rock bands have largely influenced the band like the Deftones, Sepultura, Sick of It All, and Snapcase. At an early age, Schwab listened to Slayer, S.O.D., and Metallica. He later discovered East Coast hip hop. During the recording of &quot;Rival Factions&quot;, the band took heavy influence from post-punk groups like Depeche Mode, Joy Division, Psychedelic Furs, and The Sisters of Mercy. Some of their favorite bands are The Cure, Portishead, Quicksand, Shiner, and Sunny Day Real Estate.

===Lyrics===
Vocalist Andrew Schwab is the band&#x27;s lead lyricist. Schwab has said most lyrics are based on his emotions. He also tries to incorporate social commentary from literature. Prominent influences include comic book artist Chris Ware and writers Chris Bachelder, Don DeLillo, Aldous Huxley, George Orwell, and T. S. Eliot. He has written lyrics on a variety of topics, including alcohol abuse (&quot;One-Armed Man&quot;), conformity (&quot;S.M.C.&quot;), emptiness (&quot;Evil (A Chorus of Resistance)&quot;), greed (&quot;Cold and Calculated&quot;), nightlife (&quot;Molotov&quot;), spirituality (&quot;Chapter 2&quot;), pornography (&quot;P.S.&quot;), and child molestation (&quot;Sioux Lane Spirits&quot;). He delved into conceptual writing for 2023 and 2024&#x27;s &quot;Omni&quot;, detailing a story of an oppressive dystopian society led by a corporation that seeks to merge man with AI technology in order to eradicate God.

<text>The Mormon pioneers were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), also known as Latter-day Saints, who migrated beginning in the mid-1840s until the late-1860s across the United States from the Midwest to the Salt Lake Valley in what is today the U.S. state of Utah. At the time of the planning of the exodus in 1846, the territory comprising present-day Utah was part of the Republic of Mexico, with which the U.S. soon went to war over a border dispute left unresolved after the annexation of Texas. The Salt Lake Valley became American territory as a result of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which ended the war.

The journey was taken by about 70,000 people, beginning with advance parties sent out by church leaders in March 1846 after the 1844 death of the church&#x27;s leader Joseph Smith made it clear that the group could not remain in Nauvoo, Illinoiswhich the church had recently purchased, improved, renamed, and developed, because of the Missouri Mormon War, setting off the Illinois Mormon War. The well-organized wagon train migration began in earnest in April 1847, and the period (including the flight from Missouri in 1838 to Nauvoo), known as the &quot;Mormon Exodus&quot; is, by convention among social scientists, traditionally assumed to have ended with the completion of the first transcontinental railroad in 1869. Not everyone could afford to transport a family by railroad, and the transcontinental railroad network only serviced limited main routes, so wagon train migrations to the far west continued sporadically until the 20th century.

==Background of the migration==

Since its founding in 1830, members of the LDS Church frequently had conflicts and difficult relations with non-members, due to both their unorthodox religious beliefs and the conduct of the church leaders and members. These and other reasons caused the body of the church to move from one place to another—to Ohio, Missouri, and then to Illinois, where they built the city of Nauvoo. Sidney Rigdon was the First Counselor in the church&#x27;s First Presidency, and as its spokesman, Rigdon preached several controversial sermons in Missouri, including the Salt Sermon and the July 4th Oration. These speeches have sometimes been seen as contributing to the conflict known as the 1838 Mormon War in Missouri. As a result of the conflict, the Mormons were expelled from the state by Governor Boggs, and Rigdon and Smith were arrested and imprisoned in Liberty Jail. Rigdon was released on a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and made his way to Illinois, where he joined the main body of Mormon refugees in 1839. In 1844, Smith, and his brother, Hyrum, were killed by a mob while in custody in the city of Carthage, Illinois. In 1846, religious tensions reached their peak, and in 1848 mobs burned the Latter-day Saint temple in Nauvoo.

According to church belief, God inspired Brigham Young (Joseph Smith&#x27;s successor as church president) to call for the Saints (as church members call themselves) to organize and head West, beyond the western frontier of the United States.

During the winter of 1846–1847, Latter-day Saint leaders in Winter Quarters and Iowa laid plans for the migration of the large number of Saints, their equipment, and their livestock. It was here that Young first met Thomas L. Kane, a non-Mormon from Philadelphia with deep personal connections to the administration of U.S. president James K. Polk administration. Kane obtained permission for the Mormons to winter on Indian territory, and the site was originally called Kanesville. Young continued to trust Kane throughout his own lifetime, particularly as an intermediary with the often hostile federal government of the United States. This major undertaking was a significant test of leadership capability and the existing administrative network of the recently restructured church. For his role in the migration, Brigham Young is sometimes referred to as the &quot;American Moses.&quot;

Young personally reviewed all available information on the Salt Lake Valley and the Great Basin, consulted with mountain men and trappers who traveled through Winter Quarters, and met with Father Pierre-Jean De Smet, a Jesuit missionary familiar with the Great Basin. The wary Young insisted the Mormons should settle in a location no other colonizers wanted, and felt the Salt Lake Valley met that requirement, but would provide the Saints with many advantages as well.

The valley was then under the administration of Mexico, which had banned immigration from the United States with the Law of April 6, 1830. The Mormon settlers entered Mexico without government authorization, and despite the sovereignty rights held by the Shoshone, Utes, and the Goshutes. The U.S. Army captured Santa Fe de Nuevo México and the colonized parts of Alta California in late 1846, but the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo would not cede northern Mexico to the United States until February, 1848.

==Vanguard company of 1847==

Young organized a company to break the trail west to the Rocky Mountains, gather information about trail conditions, including water sources and Native American tribes, and to ultimately select the central gathering point in the Great Basin. The initial company would select and break the primary trail with the expectation that later pioneers would maintain and improve it. It was hoped that the group could, wherever possible, establish fords and ferries and plant crops for later harvest. In late February, plans were made to gather portable boats, maps, scientific instruments, farm implements and seeds. Techniques for irrigating crops were investigated. A new route on the north side of the Platte River was chosen to avoid major interaction with travelers using the established Oregon Trail on the river&#x27;s south side. Given the needs of the large volume of Saints who would travel west, church leaders decided to avoid potential conflicts over grazing rights, water access and campsites.
In April 1847, Young consulted with members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles who had recently returned from the British mission. John Taylor, Parley P. Pratt and Orson Hyde brought money contributed by the English Saints, a map based on John C. Fremont&#x27;s recent western expedition, and instruments for calculating latitude, elevation, temperature and barometric pressure. Chosen members of the vanguard group were gathered together, final supplies were packed, and the group was organized into military companies. The group consisted of 143 men, including three enslaved African-American men, and eight members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, three women, and two children. The train contained 73 wagons, one cannon, 93 horses, 52 mules, 66 oxen, 19 cows, 17 dogs and some chickens, and carried enough supplies to fully provision the group for one year. Young divided this group into 14 companies, each with a designated captain. Apprehensive of possible danger posed by Native Americans, a militia and night guard was formed under the direction of Stephen Markham.

On April 5, 1847, at 2 p.m., the wagon train moved west from Winter Quarters toward the Great Basin. With the afternoon start, they made three miles (5 km) and camped in a line a few hundred yards from a stand of timber. Journal records show that Young actively managed the journey, supervising details and occasionally giving reprimands when evening and Sunday recreation became rowdy or group members failed to complete their tasks. On one occasion, he chastised the camp&#x27;s hunters &quot;for being wasteful of flesh ... killing more than was really needed.&quot; Camp was awakened by a bugle at 5 a.m. and the company was expected to be prepared for travel by 7 a.m. Each day&#x27;s travel ended at 8:30 p.m. and the camp was in bed by 9 p.m. The company traveled six days during the week, but generally stayed in camp on Sunday to observe the Sabbath.

Some camp members were assigned specific tasks. William Clayton was appointed company scribe and was expected to record an accurate description of their journey and the distance they traveled each day. Clayton collaborated with Orson Pratt, a mathematician, and Appleton Harmon, a carpenter, to create a wagon-wheel odometer, or roadometer. It showed that the company averaged between fourteen and twenty miles per day. Apostle Orson Pratt was named the company&#x27;s scientific observer. He made regular readings on scientific instruments, took notes on geological formations and mineral resources, and described plants and animals. Journals kept by both Clayton and Pratt have become valuable resources for historians of the Mormon trek west. Clayton made his notes and measurements available to other emigrants in his &quot;The Latter-Day Saints&#x27; Emigrants&#x27; Guide&quot;.

Women of the company also performed vital tasks along the way. While much time was spent on traditional activities such as cooking, sewing, and tending children, several women served as scribes and diary keepers. Harriet Page Young, wife of Lorenzo Young, was the first woman selected for the company. She was in ill health and Lorenzo Young feared to leave her and their young children behind. The other original women of the company, Ellen Sanders Kimball, wife of Heber C. Kimball, and Clarissa Decker Young, wife of Brigham Young, were asked to accompany the group to look after Harriet Young and keep her company. The three women were joined by a larger group of women church members from Mississippi who merged with the main party at Laramie, Wyoming.

The first segment of the journey, from Winter Quarters to Fort Laramie, took six weeks, with the company arriving at the fort on June 1. The company halted for repairs and to reshoe the draft animals. While at Fort Laramie, the vanguard company was joined by members of the Mormon Battalion who had been excused from service due to illness and sent to winter in Pueblo, Colorado. Also traveling in the new group were church members from Mississippi who had taken a more southern route toward the Great Basin. At this point, the now larger company took the established Oregon Trail toward the trading post at Ft. Bridger. At a difficult crossing of the Platte, just before encountering the Sweetwater River, the company made use of their portable boat and were able to cross with comparative ease. Seizing the opportunity to both help future travelers and increase the cash available to the migration, nine men under the direction of Thomas Grover were left behind to construct and operate a ferry at that location. Missourians and other travellers at the river paid the Saints $1.50 or more per wagon to help them cross.

During the last week of June, Sam Brannan, leader of the &quot;voyage of the Brooklyn Saints&quot;, met the company near Green River, Wyoming. He reported to Young about his group&#x27;s successful journey and their settlement in what is today San Francisco, California. He urged the vanguard company to continue on to California but was unable to shift the leader&#x27;s focus away from the Great Basin. Young also met mountain man Jim Bridger on June 28. They discussed possible routes into the Salt Lake Valley, and the feasibility of viable settlements in the mountain valleys of the Great Basin. Bridger was enthusiastic about settlement near Utah Lake, reporting fish, wild fruit, timber and good grazing. He told Young that local Indians raised good crops, including corn and pumpkins, but that there was ever-present danger of frost. The company pushed on through South Pass, rafted across the Green River and arrived at Fort Bridger on July 7. About the same time, they were joined by thirteen more members of the sick detachment of the Mormon Battalion.

The vanguard company now faced a more rugged and hazardous journey, and were concerned about negotiating the passes of the Rocky Mountains. They had received conflicting advice, but Young chose to follow the trail used by the Donner–Reed party on their journey to California the previous year. Shortly after leaving Fort Bridger, the group met trapper Miles Goodyear, who owned a trading post at the mouth of the Weber River. He was enthusiastic about the agricultural potential of the large Weber Valley. During the trip through the rugged mountains, the vanguard company divided into three sections. After crossing the Green River, several members of the party suffered from &quot;mountain fever&quot; (probably Colorado tick fever, which is carried by the Rocky Mountain wood tick). Young himself became ill soon after meeting Goodyear. The small sick detachment lagged behind the larger group, and a scouting division was created to move ahead on the designated route.

In July 1847, the first company reached the Salt Lake Valley, with scouts Erastus Snow and Orson Pratt entering the valley on July 21. Pratt wrote: &quot;...we could not refrain from a shout of joy, which almost involuntarily escaped from our lips the moment this grand and lovely scenery was within our view.&quot; The two scouts undertook a twelve-mile (19 km) exploratory circuit into the valley before returning to the larger party. The next day, larger segments of the valley were explored, streams and hot springs investigated and the first camp established in the Salt Lake Valley. On July 23, Pratt offered a prayer dedicating the land to the Lord. Ground was broken, irrigation ditches were dug, and the first fields of potatoes and turnips were planted.

On July 24, Young first saw the valley from a &quot;sick&quot; wagon driven by his friend, Wilford Woodruff. According to Woodruff, Young expressed his satisfaction in the appearance of the valley and declared &quot;This is the right place, drive on.&quot; Today a monument stands in the spot where he made this declaration. Young later reported that he had seen the valley, including Ensign Peak, in a vision and recognized the spot.

On July 28, Young established a location for the future Salt Lake Temple and presented a city plan to the larger group for their approval. In August 1847, Young and other selected members of the vanguard company returned to Winter Quarters. By December 1847, more than two thousand Mormons had completed the journey to the Salt Lake Valley. Several hundred, including Young, returned east to gather and organize the companies scheduled for following years. Demographic estimates place 1,611 pioneers in the valley of the Great Salt Lake during the winter of 1847. The adult labor force, however, was quite small as a high percentage of the group, 53.2 percent were under the age of nineteen. Twenty five percent of the total were children under the age of eight.

Each year during the Mormon migration, people continued to be organized into &quot;companies&quot;, each company bearing the name of its leader. The company was further divided into groups of 10 and 50 with authority and responsibility delegated downward.

==Travel conditions==
The pioneers traveled to the Salt Lake Valley in the Great Basin using mainly large farm wagons, handcarts, and, in some cases, personally carrying their belongings. Their trail along the north bank of the Platte River and North Platte River and over the continental divide climbing up to South Pass and Pacific Springs from Fort John along the valley of the Sweetwater River, then down to Fort Bridger and from there down to the Great Salt Lake became known as the Mormon Trail.

Financial resources of the church members varied, with many families suffering from the loss of land and personal possessions in Missouri, and Illinois. This impacted the resources and supplies each family could draw upon as they covered the more than to the Great Basin. Church funds were also limited at this time, but church leaders provided what funding and other material assistance they could to families and companies which were undersupplied.

Covered wagons pulled by oxen were common, particularly in the early American companies. In October 1845, as church members were preparing to leave Nauvoo, the &quot;Nauvoo Neighbor&quot; printed an extensive list of suggested provisions for each family wagon. The provisions included two to three yoke of oxen, two milk cows, other livestock, arms and ammunition, 15 lb of iron, pulleys and ropes, fishing gear, farming and mechanical equipment, cooking equipment and at least 1000 pounds of flour plus assorted other foodstuffs. Some pioneers overestimated the number of goods they could haul on the long journey. As the oxen weakened under the strain, wagons were lightened by discarding prized possessions, including book collections, family china, and furniture. In 1847, just east of the Rocky Mountains, the Kimball family dug a large hole, wrapped their piano in buffalo skins and carefully buried it. An ox team retrieved the instrument the following spring and transported it to the Salt Lake Valley.

Several later companies were largely made up of people with fewer resources, who pulled or pushed handcarts (similar to wheelbarrows) holding all of their provisions and personal belongings. Many of these pioneers walked much of the way as family members rode in the carts.

Due to the weather in the American heartland, the best time to travel was April–September. Some companies, however, started late in the season which resulted in hardship and sometimes disaster. The most famous of these are the Willie and the Martin handcart companies. Leaving Iowa in July 1856, they did not reach Utah until November, suffering many deaths due to winter weather and the lack of adequate supplies.

==The ship &quot;Brooklyn&quot;==

In November 1845, Samuel Brannan, newspaperman and small-scale publisher of the Mormon paper &quot;The Prophet&quot; (later the &quot;New York Messenger&quot;), was directed by church elders to charter a ship that would carry its passengers away from the eastern United States to California, which was then part of Mexico. Over the course of two months, Brannan managed to recruit 70 men, 68 women, and 100 children—238 persons total. Brannan negotiated a fare of $75 for adults and half-fare for children with the Captain Abel W. Richardson, master and a principal owner of the ship &quot;Brooklyn&quot;.

On February 4, 1846 (the same day the Mormon exodus from Nauvoo began), the ship &quot;Brooklyn&quot; cleared New York harbor and began its nearly 6-month voyage to the Pacific coast of the then-Mexican Territory of California. The ship weighed and measured 125 ft x x 4.3 m) and was built in 1834 by Joseph H. Russell at Newcastle, Maine.

The voyage is the longest passage made by a Mormon emigrant company. The ship &quot;Brooklyn&quot; sailed from Brooklyn Harbor, New York, and traveled south across the Atlantic equator, around Cape Horn, stopping at the Juan Fernández Islands, then to the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii), finally docking in Yerba Buena (now San Francisco) on July 29, 1846, having made the sea voyage in five months and twenty-seven days.

Augusta Joyce Crocheron, a passenger on the ship &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, described the voyage:
The passengers of the ship &quot;Brooklyn&quot; left the United States with the hope of finding religious freedom. However, they arrived in Mexican Alta California just weeks after its occupation by the United States Navy at the outset of the Mexican–American War. Despite the tensions that drove them from their homes in the Eastern States, the crew and passengers &quot;felt more cheerful and secure.&quot; Mormon historian B. H. Roberts noted in his work &quot;A Comprehensive History of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;:

This dangerous trek of nearly would claim 10 lives of the ship&#x27;s 238 passengers, nine of whom were buried at sea.

Brooklyn Place, in Chinatown, San Francisco, is named for the ship, as was the erstwhile Brooklyn, California.

==Later migration==

After the initial departure of the Latter-day Saints living in Illinois and Missouri, converts to the church from other areas in the United States and from Europe followed the initial trail to join the main body of the church in Salt Lake City. Every year from 1847 until 1869, church members making this journey were formed into organized companies. Migration continued until about 1890, but those who came by railroad are not generally considered to be &quot;Mormon pioneers.&quot;

===Danish Mormon pioneers===
Mormon pioneers emigrated from many countries. Denmark was one of those countries, with a large number of Mormon emigrants coming to Utah between 1850 and 1910. The migration of Danes was initiated when missionaries from the LDS Church, including Erastus Snow, Peter O. Hansen and two others, were sent to Denmark in 1850. Hansen made the first translation of the Book of Mormon from English, by translating it into Danish. Religious freedom was written into the constitution of the Kingdom of Denmark in 1849. Along with the Danish translation of the Book of Mormon, this opened the area to great success in attaining converts. At that time the LDS Church was urging new members to gather to Utah, which led these early converts to make emigration plans.

Box Elder, Cache, Salt Lake, Utah, and Sevier counties had large numbers of Danes listed in 19th Century Utah census totals but Sanpete County was the area where the largest number settled.

==Growth and development==

The Mormons settled in the Salt Lake Valley, which at that time was used as a buffer zone between the Shoshones and the Utes, who were at war. Upon arriving in the Salt Lake Valley, the Mormons developed and cultivated the arid terrain to make it more suitable. They created irrigation systems, laid out farms, built houses, churches and schools. Access to water was crucial. Almost immediately, Young sent out scouting parties to identify and settle additional community sites. While it was difficult to find large areas in the Great Basin where water sources were dependable and growing seasons long enough to raise vitally important subsistence crops, satellite communities began to be formed in all directions. Church members eventually headed south into present-day Arizona and Mexico, west into California, north into Idaho and Canada, and east into Wyoming, settling many communities in those areas.

Shortly after the first company arrived in the Salt Lake Valley in 1847, the community of Bountiful was established to the north. In 1848, pioneers moved into lands purchased from trapper Miles Goodyear in present-day Ogden. In 1849, Tooele and Fort Utah (also known as Fort Provo, in modern-day Provo) were founded. The settlement of Provo was particularly troubling to the Utes, since it was at the heart of their territory. Ute chief Wakara suggested the pioneers instead move into the Sanpete Valley in central Utah, where they established the community of Manti. Tensions in Fort Utah mounted after Mormons murdered Old Bishop, and Young ordered an attack on Utes, called the Battle at Fort Utah. This was shortly followed by the Walker War.

Fillmore, Utah, intended to be the capital of the new territory, was established in 1851. In 1855, efforts to subdue and evangelize to local Native people led to outposts in Fort Lemhi on Idaho&#x27;s Salmon River, Las Vegas, Nevada and Elk Mountain in east-central of present-day Utah.

The experiences of returning members of the Mormon Battalion were also important in establishing new communities. On their journey west, the Mormon soldiers had identified dependable rivers and fertile river valleys in Colorado, Arizona and southern California. In addition, as the discharged men traveled to rejoin their families in the Salt Lake Valley, they moved through southern Nevada and southern Utah. Jefferson Hunt, senior Mormon officer of the Battalion, actively searched for settlement sites, minerals and other resources. His report encouraged 1851 settlement efforts in Iron Country, near present-day Cedar City. These southern explorations eventually led to Mormon settlements in St. George, Utah, Las Vegas and San Bernardino, California, as well as communities in southern Arizona. By 1885, Mormon communities were being established in northern Mexico.

==Legacy==

The Mormon pioneers are celebrated annually on July 24 in the State of Utah, known as Pioneer Day. Salt Lake City also has the Mormon Pioneer Memorial Monument, where Young, Eliza R. Snow, and other Mormon pioneers are buried and where a memorial exists dedicated to all who crossed the plains to the Salt Lake Valley. Additionally, the &quot;Pioneer&quot; (characterized as &quot;Pioneer Pete&quot;) is Lehi High School&#x27;s mascot. In some places, Mormons hold an event called &quot;Pioneer Trek&quot; for people who are ages fourteen to eighteen. In participating in the trek, the youth dress as pioneers and pack a few things to carry in handcarts. They go on a hike for a couple of days so they can experience what the pioneers had. During this multi-day event, camp organizers sometimes require youth to avoid the use of technology or anything that the pioneers did not have on their journeys, to enhance the experience.

==Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel Database==
The Mormon Pioneer Overland Travel gathers information from journals, church history records, and other materials to locate the company in which an ancestor traveled across the plains to get to Utah. This covers known and unknown wagon trains from 1847 to 1868. It contains lists of passengers in companies as well as genealogical information about ancestors. It is the most comprehensive list of Mormon immigrants and the wagon trains that brought them to Utah.

<text>James Moore (14 January 1849 – 17 July 1935) was an English bicycle racer. He is popularly regarded as the winner of the first official cycle race in the world in 1868 at St-Cloud, Paris, although this claim seems to be erroneous. In 1869 he won the world&#x27;s first road race Paris–Rouen sponsored by &quot;Le Vélocipède Illustré&quot; and the Olivier brothers&#x27; Michaux Bicycle Company. Moore covered the in 10 hours and 25 minutes. He was one of the first stars of cycle racing, dominating competition for many years.

==Early life and education==
Moore was born in Long Brackland, Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, England on 14 January 1849. Moore&#x27;s father, also James, was a blacksmith and farrier. His mother was Elizabeth Ann Moore. The couple had two sons and five daughters. The sons, Alfred and James, were born in Britain, the daughters in France.

The family moved to Paris when James was four years old. The reason for the move is not known. One account says that Moore&#x27;s father was French, the rest of the family of Irish and Scottish background, but there is no confirmation. The family eventually lived at 2 cité Godot-de-Mauroy. James made friends with the Michaux family of blacksmiths who lived opposite them at numbers 5 and 7. The Michaux family, either Pierre or his son Ernest is credited with being first to add cranks and pedals to a vélocipède. Moore owned a Michaux vélocipède around 1865.

One report said:
It was in 1865 that Moore became the owner of his first bicycle, having purchased in that year a heavy wooden velocipede or boneshaker from the famous pioneer cycle-manufacturing firm which had then been founded by Ernest Michaux. He rode the vehicle with the greatest enthusiasm.

Moore used the vélocipède to run errands for his father, travelling from the city centre to the suburbs. 

James Moore&#x27;s son, also James, said:
Six months [after moving to Paris] while most of the younger members of the family were still struggling with French, it was young Jimmy who acted as their interpreter. Obviously he was quite at home in Paris and like any other boy he was fascinated by the Cirque d&#x27;Été, the Summer Circus, which used to be pitched halfway down the Champs Elysees, a stone&#x27;s throw from his home on the avenue Montaigne. It was here that he developed a love for horses which was to remain with him for the rest of his life. He got on well with the circus people, who let him ride the horses at rehearsals. The acrobats and trapeze artists, too, were his friends and he learned many of their tricks. At 18 he could do a double somersault between two trapezes – quite a feat.

This account clashes with the claim that only the two sons were born when the family moved to France.

==Cycling career==
===The first cycle race - St-Cloud===
Moore joined the Véloce cycling club of Paris after 1868. He began racing at the meeting held in the park at St-Cloud, west of Paris, on 31 May 1868. Moore&#x27;s race is widely cited as the first formal cycle race in history and a plaque was added to the park railings to mark the event. But the validity of the claim is contested in Keizo Kobayashi&#x27;s history of the Draisienne and the Michaux vélocipede, which claims Moore&#x27;s race was the third that day and not even the most important.

The races on 31 May 1868, when Moore was 19, took place in the Saint-Cloud park in Paris. The races were to the park&#x27;s fountain and back – 1,200 metres on a gravel path. 

The French historian Pierre Chany wrote:
In Paris, &#x27;pedalling machines&#x27; proliferated, characterised by wheels of 1m or 1m 10 in front and 80cm at the back. Their riders gave exhibitions in which they rivalled each other in technique and vigour. Seeing these demonstrations, the Ollivier brothers, who controlled the Compagnie Parisienne, decided to hold a race on 31 May 1868 in the Parc de St-Cloud, made available to them by their Imperial Majesties &quot;Cycling Record&quot; reported that the event started on the stroke of 3pm in the presence of the aristocracy of Tout-Paris, all thrilled at the idea of seeing these men rival each other in strength and virtuosity.

Although Moore&#x27;s race has been widely considered the first, the Dutch historian Benjie Maso says it was the second and that the first was won by a rider called Polocini. (See below for more on the &quot;first race&quot; mystery). The favourite for the second event was François Drouet who was the early leader. At half way James Moore took the lead, breaking clear &quot;at the speed of lightning&quot;, according to &quot;Cycling Record&quot;, and won in 3 minutes and 50 seconds to the &quot;frenetic hurrahs&quot; of the crowd. Moore and Polocini were presented with gold medals worth one hundred francs awarded by the Compagnie Parisienne. Moore&#x27;s was engraved with his name and carried the effigy of Napoleon III. What is believed to have been the first cycle race in Britain took place at the Welsh Harp the day after Moore won in the Parc de St-Cloud. The race was won by Arthur Markham, who for many years had a bicycle shop nearby at 345 Edgware Road.

The St. Cloud races caught the public imagination and inspired events elsewhere. The first race in Britain was held the following day (see below) and races were held on 18 July in Ghent, Belgium. Races held in September in Brno, the capital of Moravia, marked the start of racing in central Europe. 

Moore&#x27;s winning bicycle is in Ely City Museum in Cambridgeshire. It has a diamond-shaped iron downtube and a top tube and tyres of flattened metal. The rest is wood, including the wheels. The back wheel has a diameter of 31 inches, the front 38 inches. The gearing is 1:1 (the pedals connected to the front hub), so the gear is low. The machine&#x27;s saddle perished and disappeared before the bicycle returned to Britain.

====Commemorative plaque====
The Touring Club of France erected a plaque in the Saint-Cloud park reading: &#x27;On 31 May 1868, James Moore became the winner of the first race for vélocipèdes in France&#x27;. Among those present were Godfrey Haggarel, British consul-general in Paris; Géo Lefèvre, vice-chairman of the Association of Sports Journalists and the man who thought up the Tour de France, officials from the town hall of St-Cloud and the Touring Club de France, and the racers Henry Debray, Lucien Louvet and Rodolf Moller, and Victor Breyer, the deputy organiser of the Tour de France. The plaque has since disappeared.

====The &#x27;first race&#x27; mystery====
James Moore believed all his life that he had won the first cycle race in the world. Keizo Kobayashi&#x27;s research and thesis, however, attempts to show that Moore&#x27;s was not the first race.

Nick Clayton, editor of &quot;The Boneshaker&quot;, magazine of veteran-cycle enthusiasts in Britain, wrote:

:Kobayashi has discovered at least five vélocipède races in France which predate St Cloud, so the blue plaque on the railings proclaiming Moore as winner of the first vélocipède race organised in France is incorrect on more than one count. True these races did not get the publicity that the Michaux organisation was able to attract for St-Cloud but it is curious why it should be James Moore&#x27;s name on the plaque rather than Edward-Charles Bon, winner of the earlier 2.30 race or even Poloni [sic], winner of the Grande Course that day.

Citing Kobayashi, Clayton says the programme for St Cloud was:

:1. At 2.30pm, 1km race for velocipedes of less than 1m [wheel] diameter, for a silver medal. Seven amateurs were involved, the winner was Edward-Charles Bon in 2min 40sec at a speed of 22.5 km/h.

:2. 1 km race for velocipedes of 1 metre for a silver gilt medal. Winner James Moore in 2min 35sec, speed 23.2 km/h. Five contestants. This medal is in Ely museum.

:3: Slow race of 50 metres. Six contestants, won by Durruthy.

:4: Grande Course for a gold medal. Three riders. Won by Polonini [sic] in 2min 33sec, 23.5 km/h.

Moore&#x27;s grandson put it to Clayton:

:If you accept that James Moore believed he won the first bicycle race, then, as he surely cannot have forgotten that his race was at least scheduled to be the second of the day at St Cloud, there must have been either something different about the first race – e.g. it was not exclusively for pedal machines – or the order of the events was changed so that his race took place first. My hypothesis assumes the former proposition, and is only partly reliant on whether the rules stated that the front wheels of the velocipedes in the second race were to be &quot;precisely&quot; 1 metre diameter as stated in your article. My main argument, however, is that the word &quot;velocipede&quot; was used generically to include all types of machine including even hobby-horses for which it was originally coined. They would surely have had wheels of less than one metre diameter.

Clayton replied:

:I think your attempt to redefine the second race at St Cloud &quot;as the first velocipede race&quot; does not hold water. Velocipedes meant boneshakers, only occasionally was there the odd tricycle or quadricycle. Boneshakers began effectively in 1867 and St Cloud was just one of several minor meetings which Duncan just happened to immortalise.

James Moore believed to his death that he had won the world&#x27;s first cycle race. Of suggestions that Moore had invented the story after rising to fame by winning the Paris–Rouen race (see below), his grandson John said:

:In that case, being only one year or so after the St Cloud race, it is incredible that, if the claim were false, no one – even from among the winners, spectators and other followers of the previous races as cited – seems to have challenged that claim.

For a long time no contemporary sources could be found to support any of the claims. Until the Bibliothèque nationale de France (French National Library) digitalised numerous French newspapers and periodicals.
Le Petit-Journal published a report of these races in its issue of Tuesday 2 June 1868:

The races have taken place in the following order:

VÉLOCIPÈDES SMALLER THAN ONE METRE (silver medal): Mr. Ch. Bon, in 2 minutes 40.
VÉLOCIPÈDES OF 1 METRE (gilded medal); five riders. Mr. James Moor, 1st, in 2 minutes 35.

SLOW RACE (50 metres of the track); six competitors. This race was very amusing; the riders tried their best not to go fast, without stopping; their contrary movements made them fall except for Mr. J. Darenty, student of the Grand Gymnasium, who won the prize.

GRAND RACE (gold medal). Three riders. Mr. Polinini, 1st in 2 minutes 33 seconds.

===Paris–Rouen – 1869, the first road race===
The Olivier brothers were delighted with the race and the next year, 1869, 7 November, promoted the Paris–Rouen race – about . The first prize was 1,000 francs, second prize a bicycle with suspension, then medals for the next three. The rules said the riders were not &#x27;to be trailed by a dog or use sails&#x27;. 325 riders started the race. The course took them through St-Germain (16 km), Mantes (39 km), Vernon (63 km) and Louviers (97 km). The race started at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris and finished in the centre of Rouen. He is presumed to have been riding a Suriray bicycle built by Tribout and equipped with ball bearings, which were patented by Jules Suriray, a Parisian bicycle mechanic, in 1869. 

Moore&#x27;s son, James, recalled:
To win Paris–Rouen, my father had to show muscular power, courage and determination and intelligence. The Place de l&#x27;Étoile [site of the Arc de Triomphe] was again the scene, at seven o&#x27;clock in the morning... The pedal-driven bicycle was now established and 325 riders had entered for the 83-mile race to Rouen. The organisers were scared of starting them all together, so split the field into two groups – a little girl of five made the draw. My father was the race favourite; second favourite was Castéra, who was second at St Cloud; third favourite was an English visitor, a student from Cambridge named Johnson, who had won races at home. My father was now considered so much a friend of France that he was being called &#x27;The Flying Parisian&#x27;.

Castéra and Johnson both drew even numbers, which meant they went off in the first group, 30 minutes before the odd numbers. My father drew number 187. When the signal was given for the second group to move off, my father went right to the front and was soon on his own. It was raining, and it remained wet all day. Right down the Avénue de la Grande Armée and the Avénue de Neuilly, over the bridges of the Seine, and on towards the first control at St Germain-en-Laye. As he pedalled hard up the steep hill near the town, he passed a group of stragglers from the first group who were pushing their machines. My father had gained 30 minutes on them in 12 miles!

Moore caught Castéra and then Johnson. He won in 10 hours and 25 minutes, finishing in front of an enthusiastic crowd at 6.10 pm. The average of only can be attributed to poor roads, lack of tyres, weight of the machine and the low gears. It was nevertheless fast enough that the mayor of Rouen, who was to present the trophies, was only stepping out of his carriage as Moore arrived. The runners-up were Jean-Eugène-André Castéra, sometimes described as a &quot;count&quot; &quot;(comte)&quot; even though the title had vanished with the Revolution, and Jean Bobillier from Voiron, on a farm bicycle weighing 35 kg. They finished 15 minutes after Moore and asked to be judged equal second. The only woman to finish in the time limit was a British woman who called herself Miss America. She came in 22nd at dawn next day.

There was a banquet in Rouen that night and Moore&#x27;s bicycle was draped with the Union Jack. When he went back to collect it from where it had been left outside a café in the rue Notre Dame des Victoires, it had disappeared. 

The historian Derek Roberts wrote:
What bicycle did Moore ride in the Paris–Rouen race in 1869? There are two candidates and three or four accounts. Bonneville said that Moore was riding a Suriray bicycle specially built by Tribout, fitted with ball bearings, rubber tyres 48¼-inch and 15¾-inch wheels with metal rims. It was the first high bicycle, said Bonneville, overlooking the fact that he had elsewhere said the honour belonged to Vibert. The anonymous authors of the series &#x27;Pioneers of the Cycle Industry&#x27; in &quot;Bicycling News&quot; said that Moore rode a heavy wooden Michaux fitted with solid rubber tyres which were secured to the wheel rims by means of sheet-iron braces screwed to the latter, and his machine embodied a type of ball bearing which had been more or less handmade by a Parisian manufacturer...

In &quot;The World on Wheels&quot;, H. O. Duncan, wrote: 
&#x27;The machine ridden by James Moore in the Paris–Rouen race was manufactured in the prison of St-Pelagy, just outside Paris, under the direction of J. Suriray. Tribout (one of the best French racing men) was his foreman. H. W. Bartleet wrote: &#x27;Moore won... on a Michaux bicycle with rubber tyres and ball bearings, the latter made (against the advice of Michaux) under Moore&#x27;s own supervision, the balls being ground circular by prisoners in a Paris prison, who could not rebel at the hard work.

Moore received a gold medal at the Compagnie Parisienne office on 21 November but it is not in the collection on show at Ely museum.

===Other races===
Moore won a race at Le Neubourg in 1868, then the grand prix of Cognac, Le Neubourg and Vesinet in 1869. But according to Nick Clayton, Moore preferred races in which he faced lesser competition and stood to win medals rather than money.

Clayton wrote:
Moore appears to have rested on his laurels for a time and did not defend his reputation in France in 1870. However, when war came in the summer he returned to England and according to Bonneville, who can be unreliable, he won at Wolverhampton on a Meyer. He rode in the All-England bicycle race for £20 given by the Wolverhampton Sun Bicycle Association on 26 and 28 November 1870, when he lost in a one-mile race to Sheldon.

Moore later (in 1873) set an hour record of 14 miles, 880 yards (23.331 km) at the Molyneaux Grounds in Wolverhampton. The book Bike Cult by Gavid B. Perry lists it as the very first hour record and the only one that was ridden on a tall bike. The Ariel bicycle had a 49&quot;-front wheel and 3.91 meters development.

Moore became an early world champion when he won the MacGregor Cup in 1872, 1873, 1874, 1875 and finally in Toulouse in 1877. He retired from racing in 1877.

Victor Breyer said:
He had attained a unique position as a crack velocipede rider. Indeed one to compare with what the great Arthur Zimmerman became a quarter of a century later. He raced in France and England, and it is a peculiar fact that he was acclaimed as the &#x27;Flying Frenchie&#x27; on your side of the Channel and &quot;l&#x27;Anglais volant&quot; on the other. Between 1868 and 1877, the year of his retirement, he proved almost unbeatable in both countries.

Nick Clayton wrote:
Clifford maintained that Moore was certainly the first and foremost cycling athlete of his day. Kobayashi makes a more moderate claim for him as the third best rider in France at this time after Edmond Moret and André Castéra. Moore was known for his tactical skills, probably learned at the horse-racing tracks, never passing his rivals until the last lap.

Moore&#x27;s son said:
He had a great interest in horse racing... Father studied the race horse in its trotting and pace, noting the great burst of power over the last 120 yards (100 m) or so. That is how I heard father rode his races, like a racehorse never swaying or losing rhythm and balance, with a strong final surge. The French horse has always been noted for its speed, English horses for stamina. That is why English horses seldom win on the shorter French courses. It is so with the cyclists also, isn&#x27;t it?

==Later life==
Moore worked with his father in the ambulance service in Paris during the Franco-Prussian war. He went to work at Maisons Lafitte, the French horse racing centre. In 1945 he was made a &quot;Chevalier de la Légion d&#x27;Honneur&quot;
. He studied at Cambridge, England, to become a member of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, later becoming a Fellow. He started a stud farm in Normandy.

Moore&#x27;s son said:
My father retained his athletic outlook into his later years. On his 50th birthday, he gave up smoking, announcing &#x27;I am disgusted with myself for following such a habit!&#x27; At 78, golf drew his attention. &#x27;This is a game I must try&#x27;, he said, and within three years reduced his handicap to nine, then to eight. 

He also took up tennis, at which &quot;he was rarely beaten&quot;. He never lost his French accent when speaking English, Lord Brain saying of him at a meeting of physicians: &quot;Dr Moore makes a tremendous effort to conceal his French intonation we all love so much.&quot; 
It is unclear when Moore returned to Britain. Some reports say after the Prussian war, others that it was before the first world war and still another that it was at the start of the second world war. He moved to 56 Wildwood Road in Hampstead, North London, where he died after a prostate operation at the age of 86. His grandson, John Moore, says the whereabouts of his grave is unknown but may be in the area of the Welsh Harp reservoir near Cricklewood in north London.

His obituary in Cycling read:
It is with deep regret that we have to record the death, at the age of 87, of Mr James Moore, who, on May 31, 1868, won the first cycle race ever held – a 25-kilometre event at Ville de St Cloud... The part that James Moore played in the history of cycle racing, while of brief duration, was historically of the greatest importance. Between 1873 and 1877 he won five international championships and smashed short-distance records galore. All these races, including the championship of the world races at the Molineux [sic] Grounds, Wolverhampton, in 1874, were ridden on a graceful old Ordinary. Mr Moore retained an interest in cycling until his death. In 1933 he was the guest of honour at the triennial dinner of the Road Records Association.

In 1966, the Saddle Club of London suggested the British Post Office produce a commemorative stamp for the 100th anniversary of the St-Cloud race. The club suggested a design but the idea was not adopted.

===Burial mystery===
The location of Moore&#x27;s grave is not known. His grandson, John, said: &quot;The odd thing is that my father was such a good story-teller but he couldn&#x27;t or wouldn&#x27;t tell me where my grandfather was buried. It was as if there was some unfinished business, some sort of mix-up, something I never understood. It&#x27;s a mystery.&quot; Moore believes the site may be near the Welsh Harp reservoir – also known as Brent Reservoir – in north London.

<text>Jack Maguire (February 5, 1925 – September 28, 2001) was an American professional baseball player whose career lasted for eight seasons (1943; 1946–52). He played in 94 Major League games as an outfielder and utility infielder for the New York Giants, Pittsburgh Pirates and St. Louis Browns in –51. A native of St. Louis, Missouri, Maguire threw and batted right-handed. He stood tall and weighed .

Maguire spent five seasons in the Giants&#x27; farm system before seeing his two full years of Major League service. He logged 30 games played as a left fielder, 13 as a right fielder, six games as a third baseman, three as a second baseman, and two as a first baseman. His 46 hits included five doubles, two triples and two home runs. He saw the most playing time as a member of his hometown Browns during the closing months of the 1951 season. Maguire started 30 games as a left fielder or third baseman, and had nine multi-hit games, including three-hit efforts against the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees on consecutive days, August 2–3.

As a youth growing up in St. Louis, Maguire gave Yogi Berra his famous nickname. One afternoon, after attending a movie that had a short piece on India, Maguire noticed a resemblance between Berra and the &quot;yogi&quot;, or person who practiced yoga, on the screen. Maguire said &quot;I’m going to call you Yogi&quot; and from that moment on, the name stuck.

Maguire also wore uniform #24 of the Giants from 1950 through May 23, 1951, his final game with the club. Rookie centerfielder Willie Mays, recalled from Triple-A, made his MLB debut two days later, on May 25, wearing #14 but he soon inherited 24, and famously wore it for the rest of his Hall of Fame career.

<text>Capital accumulation is the dynamic that motivates the pursuit of profit, involving the investment of money or any financial asset with the goal of increasing the initial monetary value of said asset as a financial return whether in the form of profit, rent, interest, royalties or capital gains. The goal of accumulation of capital is to create new fixed capital and working capital, broaden and modernize the existing ones, grow the material basis of social-cultural activities, as well as constituting the necessary resource for reserve and insurance. The process of capital accumulation forms the basis of capitalism, and is one of the defining characteristics of a capitalist economic system.

==Definition==

In economics and accounting, capital accumulation is often equated with investment of profit income or savings, especially in real capital goods. The concentration and centralisation of capital are two of the results of such accumulation (see below).

Capital accumulation refers ordinarily to:

*Real investment in tangible means of production, such as acquisitions, research and development, etc. that can increase the capital flow.
*Investment in financial assets represented on paper, yielding profit, interest, rent, royalties, fees or capital gains.
*Investment in &quot;non-productive&quot; physical assets such as residential real estate or works of art that appreciate in value.

and by extension to:

*Human capital, i.e., new education and training increasing the skills of the (potential) labour force which can increase earnings from work.
*Social capital, i.e. the wealth and productive capacity that the people in a society hold in common, rather than as individuals or corporations.

Both non-financial and financial capital accumulation is usually needed for economic growth, since additional production usually requires additional funds to enlarge the scale of production. Smarter and more productive organization of production can also increase production without increased capital. Capital can be created without increased investment by inventions or improved organization that increase productivity, discoveries of new assets (oil, gold, minerals, etc.), the sale of property, etc.

In modern macroeconomics and econometrics the term &quot;capital formation&quot; is often used in preference to &quot;accumulation&quot;, though the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) refers nowadays to &quot;accumulation&quot;. The term is occasionally used in national accounts.

===Measurement of accumulation===
Accumulation can be measured as the monetary value of investments, the amount of income that is reinvested, or as the change in the value of assets owned (the increase in the value of the capital stock). Using company balance sheets, tax data and direct surveys as a basis, government statisticians estimate total investments and assets for the purpose of national accounts, national balance of payments and flow of funds statistics. Usually, the reserve banks and the Treasury provide interpretations and analysis of this data. Standard indicators include capital formation, gross fixed capital formation, fixed capital, household asset wealth, and foreign direct investment.

==Demand-led growth models==
In macroeconomics, following the Harrod–Domar model, the savings ratio (formula_1) and the capital coefficient (formula_2) are regarded as critical factors for accumulation and growth, assuming that all saving is used to finance fixed investment. The rate of growth of the real stock of fixed capital (formula_3) is:

:formula_4

where formula_5 is the real national income. If the capital-output ratio or capital coefficient (formula_6) is constant, the rate of growth of formula_5 is equal to the rate of growth of formula_3. This is determined by formula_1 (the ratio of net fixed investment or saving to formula_5) and formula_2.

A country might, for example, save and invest 12% of its national income, and then if the capital coefficient is 4:1 (i.e. $4 billion must be invested to increase the national income by 1 billion) the rate of growth of the national income might be 3% annually. However, as Keynesian economics points out, savings do not automatically mean investment (as liquid funds may be hoarded for example). Investment may also not be investment in fixed capital (see above).

Assuming that the turnover of total production capital invested remains constant, the proportion of total investment which just maintains the stock of total capital, rather than enlarging it, will typically increase as the total stock increases. The growth rate of incomes and net new investments must then also increase, in order to accelerate the growth of the capital stock. Simply put, the bigger capital grows, the more capital it takes to keep it growing and the more markets must expand.

The Harrodian model has a problem of unstable static equilibrium, since if the growth rate is not equal to the Harrodian warranted rate, the production will tend to extreme points (infinite or zero production). The Neo-Kaleckians models do not suffer from the Harrodian instability but fails to deliver a convergence dynamic of the effective capacity utilization to the planned capacity utilization. For its turn, the model of the Sraffian Supermultiplier grants a static stable equilibrium and a convergence to the planned capacity utilization. The Sraffian Supermultiplier model diverges from the Harrodian model since it takes the investment as induced and not as autonomous. The autonomous components in this model are the Autonomous Non-Capacity Creating Expenditures, such as exports, credit led consumption and public spending. The growth rate of these expenditures determines the long run rate of capital accumulation and product growth.

==Marxist concept==
{{See also|Marxian economics}}
{{Marxism sidebar|expand=Critique of political economy}}Karl Marx borrowed the idea of capital accumulation or the concentration of capital from early socialist writers such as Charles Fourier, Louis Blanc, Victor Considerant, and Constantin Pecqueur. In Marx&#x27;s critique of political economy, capital accumulation is the operation whereby profits are reinvested into the economy, increasing the total quantity of capital. Capital was understood by Marx to be expanding value, that is, in other terms, as a sum of capital, usually expressed in money, that is transformed through human labor into a larger value and extracted as profits. Here, capital is defined essentially as economic or commercial asset value that is used by capitalists to obtain additional value (surplus-value). This requires property relations which enable objects of value to be appropriated and owned, and trading rights to be established. Marx argued that capital has the tendency for concentration and centralization in the hands of richest capitalists

According to Marxism during periods of stagnation in capitalism, the accumulation process is increasingly oriented towards investment on military and security forces, real estate, financial speculation, and luxury consumption. In that case, income from value-adding production will decline in favour of interest, rent and tax income, with as a corollary an increase in the level of permanent unemployment. Capital accumulation of the means of production in Marxist thought leads to the formation of the bourgeoisie.

&quot;Accumulation of capital&quot; sometimes also refers in Marxist writings to the reproduction of capitalist social relations (institutions) on a larger scale over time, i.e., the expansion of the size of the proletariat and of the wealth owned by the bourgeoisie. In the first volume of &quot;Das Kapital&quot; Marx had illustrated this idea with reference to Edward Gibbon Wakefield&#x27;s theory of colonisation, and further refers to the &quot;fetishism of capital&quot; reaching its highest point with &quot;interest-bearing capital&quot;, because of how capital appeared to grow almost of its own accord.

The Marxist analysis of capital accumulation and the development of capitalism identifies systemic issues with the process that arise with expansion of the productive forces. A crisis of overaccumulation of capital occurs when the rate of profit is greater than the rate of new profitable investment outlets in the economy, arising from increasing productivity from a rising organic composition of capital (higher capital input to labor input ratio). This depresses the wage bill, leading to stagnant wages and high rates of unemployment for the working class while excess profits search for new profitable investment opportunities. Marx believed that this cyclical process would be the fundamental cause for the dissolution of capitalism and its replacement by socialism, which would operate according to a different economic dynamic. Anarchists hold that the state always maintains a form of capital accumulation to the elite, even in self proclaimed socialist states and that for true equality the state should be abolished.

==Effects==
The effects of wealth accumulation results in increased savings for the individual. If economic growth is shared unevenly between different groups of the population wealth inequality emerges. Extreme wealth inequality leads to and economical power by the working class lowering, which can result in oligarchy, in which super rich individuals hold most power and money is society.

<text>U.S. Acres (known as Orson&#x27;s Farm outside the United States and as Orson&#x27;s Place in Canada) is an American comic strip that ran in newspapers from 1986 to 1989, created by Jim Davis, author of the comic strip &quot;Garfield&quot;. 

&quot;U.S. Acres&quot; was launched on March 3, 1986, in a then-unprecedented 505 newspapers by United Feature Syndicate. Most papers only ran the Sunday strip, usually on the same page as &quot;Garfield&quot;. For most of the last year of the strip&#x27;s existence, Brett Koth, who had been assisting Davis on &quot;Garfield&quot; at that time, was given co-creator&#x27;s credit in the strip, and signed his name to the strips along with Davis. The strip was centered on a group of barnyard animals, with the main character being Orson, a small pig who had been taken from his mother shortly after being born.

At the peak of the comic&#x27;s popularity, there were children&#x27;s books, plush animals (particularly of the characters Orson, Roy, Wade, Booker, Sheldon, and Cody), and posters of the main characters. Shirts, mugs, mousepads, and keychains of the characters would later be available. An animated adaptation was included in the TV show &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; (1988-1994) as a spin-off segment, and continued to be so for several years after the strip ended. The final daily strip was printed on April 15, 1989, while the final Sunday appeared on May 7, 1989. 

The strip was relaunched as an online webcomic on October 1, 2010, and was announced the day before in a question and answer column in &quot;USA Today&quot;. Later, in celebration of the strip&#x27;s twenty-fourth anniversary, the &quot;U.S. Acres&quot; strips prior to August 1, 1986 were released on Garfield.com. On August 7, 2016, a &quot;Garfield&quot; comic strip showed the &quot;U.S. Acres&quot; gang (sans Bo and Blue) in its logo box, featuring Garfield eating a bag of chicken feed.

In August 2019, Jim Davis sold the rights to &quot;U.S. Acres&quot; to Paramount Global (formerly ViacomCBS) as part of its acquisition of Paws, Inc. In April 2020, the strip was removed from GoComics. On June 19, 2020, Garfield.com shut down, redirecting to Nickelodeon&#x27;s website. As a result, the strip was removed as well as the webcomic being discontinued entirely. Garfield.com was later resurrected with a limited number of selected Garfield comics, but &quot;U.S. Acres&quot; is currently unavailable on the new website.

==Characters==
The primary traits of the strip&#x27;s main characters were established during the run of the comic strip, even down to such visual gags as the head on Wade&#x27;s inner tube having the same facial expression as Wade himself.

===Primary characters===

====Orson Pig====
Orson Pig (voiced by Gregg Berger): A good-natured yet naïve pig whose work ethic makes him the functional leader. His good humor being tested is one of the common gags in the cartoons. Originally, Orson had long eyelashes (to represent him as a young piglet); they disappeared on December 31, 1987 (permanently on January 3, 1988). Booker and Sheldon called him Mom (though it was inconsistent because at other times they just call him Orson). Being the runt of his litter, Orson&#x27;s original owner intended to get rid of him. Orson fell from the pick-up taking him away from his birthplace and moved to an unnamed farm, where he was later found by a farm girl who persuaded Orson to follow her to her father&#x27;s farm. Orson&#x27;s alter-ego is a costumed superhero named Power Pig, which more often than not causes his friends or adversaries to fall down laughing at him. Orson loves books, but is very influenced by them, by sometimes doing what&#x27;s in the book. Sometimes when Orson reads a book, particularly a scary one, the stuff he reads about usually appears behind him and scares the others away. While Orson has a mixed relationship with Roy in the strip, in the cartoon series he has a somewhat strong bond with him and is a lot more forgiving of his pranks.

====Roy Rooster====
Roy Rooster (voiced by Thom Huge): A loud, wisecracking rooster who endlessly enjoys practical jokes with Orson and Wade being his favorite targets. With a few exceptions, he is tolerated because his job of waking up everyone and &#x27;tending&#x27; to the chickens is important, but he does his best to avoid labor whenever possible. In the cartoon, he is far kinder, friendlier and more well-liked by the others and is often the one to defeat the series&#x27; antagonists such as Orson&#x27;s brothers. In spite of his lazy nature, Roy has proven to be a very capable protector of the chickens, coolly outsmarting and defeating the predators, such as the Weasel and the Fox (both of whom try to kidnap them) with a series of practical jokes and gags. He is also serious about being a cartoon star and does whatever he can to remain in the spotlight. Even though he is a jerk and insults everyone, Roy is not a bully and doesn’t really mean any harm. He is allergic to flowers, a fact that was first established in a strip published on July 2, 1986.

==== Booker ====
Booker (voiced by Frank Welker): A chick named by Orson for his love of books. Booker and Sheldon were still eggs when Orson found them abandoned and decided to hatch them. Booker is extremely adventurous and (over) confident despite his small size. He often chases worms but can never seem to catch them. In the comic, he often addressed Orson as &quot;Mom&quot;.

==== Sheldon ====
Sheldon (voiced by Frank Welker): Booker&#x27;s twin brother, who decided not to hatch. He becomes very philosophical and introspective over the course of the strip, and begins musing on his &quot;Sanctum Sanctorum&quot; (a small mound of grass). A recurring gag has him describe his shell as the perfect living space, which is never shown.

====Wade Duck====
Wade Duck (voiced by Howard Morris): The &quot;cowardly craven duck&quot; of the farm. His good nature is sometimes shadowed by his overwhelming hypochondria and panphobia. He is always seen wearing a kiddie pool flotation inner tube, which (as part of a continuous running gag) has a duck head in front of it that shares 
the same facial expressions as Wade – even down to the direction in which he is looking. He lost his fears as part of his final appearance on April 12, 1989.

====Bo Sheep====
Bo Sheep (voiced by Frank Welker): A sheep who is unintelligent and perky. In the TV series, he is not usually bright but always calm, cool, collected, dependable, and a skillful cook who speaks with a Southern Californian dialect. A common gag in the television series involves Bo and Lanolin constantly arguing, sometimes even about the fact that they are arguing.

====Lanolin Sheep====
Lanolin Sheep (voiced by Julie Payne): Bo&#x27;s twin sister, who is usually shown as a hard worker, but with a personality the polar opposite of her brother: loud and disagreeable. She is named after the grease produced by wool-bearing animals, such as sheep. While she is quite abrasive in the television series, especially towards Bo, in that she is nearly always arguing with him, but also towards Roy for his laziness, in the comic strip, she is much more abrasive towards everyone else in general.

===Secondary characters===
* Filbert (voiced by Howard Morris): A worm Booker often chases, but with no success. He lives in a hole with his wife Estelle and their son Willy.
* Cody: A puppy who takes pleasure in chasing the barnyard&#x27;s animals and trying to maul them. He was eventually removed from the strip without any explanation and does not appear in &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;. His final appearance was on September 13, 1988.
* Blue: A blue cat who is friends with Cody and keeps him in line. She disappeared from the strip after March 28, 1988, and, like Cody, is not present in &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;.
* Mort, Gort, &amp; Wart (voiced by Frank Welker, Thom Huge, and Howard Morris, respectively): Orson&#x27;s three larger, meaner brothers who play a much bigger role in the animated series than in the comic strip, where they are unnamed. They stopped appearing in the strip after Orson was taken away from his mother. They constantly torment Orson and in the animated series, they are frequent burglars of the farm&#x27;s crops. Their leitmotif in the series samples the melody of the classical piece &quot;In the Hall of the Mountain King&quot;.
* Max the Skateboarding Bird: An eccentric, flightless bird that first appears as a mysterious creature in a wall to whom Wade speaks on October 13, 1986. Jim Davis solicited ideas from readers (specifically children) as to what they thought the creature might be. On March 3, 1987, Davis revealed his choice in the strip. Max does not appear again following the week.
* The Weasel (voiced by Gregg Berger): A television-exclusive character who often tries to kidnap the chickens so that he can eat them, but is usually stopped by Roy. The only other regularly recurring antagonist in the animated series (he never appeared in the strip), he occasionally attempts to catch and eat Sheldon as well.
* Fido the Bull: A mean bull that lives in the barnyard.
* The Worms: Random worms that Booker chases.

The last &quot;U.S. Acres&quot; collection was published in England as a mass-market paperback, titled &quot;Orson&#x27;s Farm Cuts the Corn&quot;. The collection, which has since gone out of print along with the rest of the &quot;U.S. Acres&quot; books, contains fifty-nine of the final sixty strips (one Sunday strip was not printed) and is the rarest of any &quot;U.S. Acres/Orson&#x27;s Farm&quot; collection.

<text>Robert Michael Gates (born September 25, 1943) is an American intelligence analyst and university president who served as the 22nd United States secretary of defense from 2006 to 2011. He was appointed by President George W. Bush and was retained by President Barack Obama. Gates began his career serving as an officer in the United States Air Force but was quickly recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Gates served for twenty-six years in the CIA and at the National Security Council, and was director of central intelligence under President George H. W. Bush from 1991 to 1993. After leaving the CIA, Gates became president of Texas A&amp;M University and was a member of several corporate boards. Gates served as a member of the Iraq Study Group, the bipartisan commission co-chaired by James A. Baker III and Lee H. Hamilton that studied the lessons of the Iraq War.

Gates was nominated by Republican president George W. Bush as secretary of defense in 2006, replacing Donald Rumsfeld. He was confirmed with bipartisan support. In 2007, &quot;Time&quot; named Gates one of the year&#x27;s most influential people. In 2008, Gates was named one of America&#x27;s Best Leaders by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. He continued to serve as secretary of defense in President Barack Obama&#x27;s administration and retired in 2011. &quot;He&#x27;ll be remembered for making us aware of the danger of over-reliance on military intervention as an instrument of American foreign policy,&quot; said former senator David L. Boren. Gates was presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian award, by President Obama during his retirement ceremony.

Since leaving the Obama administration, Gates was elected president of the Boy Scouts of America, served as Chancellor of the College of William &amp; Mary, and served as a member on several corporate boards. In 2012, Gates was elected as a fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration.

==Early life and education==
Gates was born in Wichita, Kansas, the son of Isabel V. (née Goss) and Melville A. &quot;Mel&quot; Gates. Gates attained the rank of Eagle Scout in the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) and received the Distinguished Eagle Scout Award and Silver Buffalo Award from the BSA as an adult. He graduated from Wichita High School East in 1961. Gates is also a Vigil Honor member within the Order of the Arrow, BSA&#x27;s National Honor Society. He was selected as the 2017 BSA National Alumnus of the Year.

Gates then received a scholarship to attend the College of William &amp; Mary, graduating in 1965 with a B.A. in history. At William &amp; Mary, Gates was an active member and president of the Alpha Phi Omega (national service fraternity) chapter and the Young Republicans; he was also the business manager for the &quot;William and Mary Review&quot;, a literary and art magazine. At his William &amp; Mary graduation ceremony, Gates received the Algernon Sydney Sullivan Award naming him the graduate who &quot;has made the greatest contribution to his fellow man&quot;.

Gates then received a Master of Arts in the history of Eastern Europe and the south Slavs from Indiana University Bloomington in 1966. He completed his PhD in Russian and Soviet history at Georgetown University in 1974 under Joseph Schiebel, who had been heavily influenced by Karl Wittfogel&#x27;s studies on &quot;Soviet communism and its resemblance to oriental despotism and the Asiatic mode of production, [and] the role of government in controlling all of society.&quot; The title of his Georgetown doctoral dissertation is &quot;Soviet Sinology: An Untapped Source for Kremlin Views and Disputes Relating to Contemporary Events in China&quot; and is available from University Microfilms International as document number 7421652.

Gates was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from William &amp; Mary (1998), the University of Oklahoma (2011), Georgetown University (2014) and from Kansas State University (2012).

He married Rebecca &quot;Becky&quot; Gates (née Wilkie) on January 7, 1967, and they have two children.

==Intelligence career==
===Junior positions===
While at Indiana University, Gates was recruited by the Central Intelligence Agency and joined in 1966. On January 4, 1967, he was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the United States Air Force after attending Officer Training School under CIA sponsorship. From 1967 to 1969, he was assigned to the Strategic Air Command as an intelligence officer, which included a year at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri, where he delivered intelligence briefings to Intercontinental Ballistic Missile crews. After fulfilling his military obligation, he rejoined the CIA as an intelligence analyst. He wrote his doctoral thesis while serving as a professional intelligence officer. 

Gates left the CIA in 1974 to serve on the staff of the National Security Council. He returned to the CIA in late 1979, serving briefly as the director of the Strategic Evaluation Center, Office of Strategic Research. He was named the director of the DCI/DDCI Executive Staff in 1981, deputy director for intelligence in 1982, and deputy director of central intelligence from April 18, 1986, to March 20, 1989.

===Deputy National Security Advisor===
Under President George H. W. Bush, Gates was Deputy Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs from March until August 1989, and was Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Adviser under Brent Scowcroft from August 1989 until November 1991.

Gates was nominated to become the director of central intelligence (head of the CIA) in early 1987. He withdrew his name after it became clear the Senate would reject the nomination due to controversy about his role in the Iran-Contra Affair.

===Director of Central Intelligence===

Gates was nominated, for the second time, for the position of Director of Central Intelligence by Bush on May 14, 1991, confirmed by the Senate on November 5, and sworn in on November 6.

During a Senate committee hearing on his nomination, former division chief Melvin Goodman testified that the agency was the most corrupt and slanted during the tenure of William Casey with Gates serving as deputy. According to Goodman, Gates was part of an agency leadership that proliferated false information and ignored &#x27;reality&#x27;. National Intelligence Council chairman Harold P. Ford testified that during his tenure, Gates had transgressed professional boundaries.

Deputy directors during his tenure were Richard J. Kerr (from November 6, 1991, until March 2, 1992) and Adm. William O. Studeman (from April 9, 1992, through the remainder of Gates&#x27;s tenure). He served until 1993. It is notable that the reluctance of the Bush administration to involve itself in the breakup of Yugoslavia was due in no small part to three advisors who had deep exposure to the region: Scowcroft, Lawrence Eagleburger and himself: &quot;We saw the historical roots of this conflict and the near nonexistent potential for solving it, for us fixing it.&quot;

===Level of involvement in the Iran–Contra scandal===
Because of his senior status in the CIA, Gates was close to many figures who played significant roles in the Iran–Contra Affair and was in a position to have known of their activities. In 1984, as deputy director of CIA, Gates advocated that the U.S. initiate a bombing campaign against Nicaragua and that the U.S. do everything in its power short of direct military invasion of the country to remove the Sandinista government.

Gates was an early subject of Independent Counsel&#x27;s investigation, but the investigation of Gates intensified in the spring of 1991 as part of a larger inquiry into the Iran–Contra activities of CIA officials. This investigation received an additional impetus in May 1991, when President George H. W. Bush nominated Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence (DCI). The chairman and vice chairman of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) requested, in a letter to the independent counsel on May 15, 1991, any information that would &quot;significantly bear on the fitness&quot; of Gates for the CIA post.

Gates consistently testified that he first heard on October 1, 1986, from Charles E. Allen, the national intelligence officer who was closest to the Iran initiative, that proceeds from the Iran arms sales may have been diverted to support the Contras. Other evidence proves, however, that Gates received a report on the diversion during the summer of 1986 from DDI Richard Kerr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report of the Independent Counsel for Iran/Contra Matters; Volume I&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was whether the Independent Counsel could prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Gates was deliberately not telling the truth when he later claimed not to have remembered any reference to the diversion before meeting with Allen in October.
Grand jury secrecy rules hampered Independent Counsel&#x27;s response. Nevertheless, in order to answer questions about Gates&#x27;s prior testimony, Independent Counsel accelerated his investigation of Gates in the summer of 1991. This investigation was substantially completed by September 3, 1991, at which time Independent Counsel determined that Gates&#x27;s Iran–Contra activities and testimony did not warrant prosecution.

Independent Counsel made this decision subject to developments that could have warranted reopening his inquiry, including testimony by Clair E. George, the CIA&#x27;s former deputy director for operations. At the time Independent Counsel reached this decision, the possibility remained that George could have provided information warranting reconsideration of Gates&#x27;s status in the investigation. George refused to cooperate with Independent Counsel and was indicted on September 19, 1991. George subpoenaed Gates to testify as a defense witness at George&#x27;s first trial in the summer of 1994, but Gates was never called.

The final report of the Independent Counsel for Iran–Contra Scandal, issued on August 4, 1993, said that Gates &quot;was close to many figures who played significant roles in the Iran/contra affair and was in a position to have known of their activities. The evidence developed by Independent Counsel did not warrant indictment ...&quot;

==Career after leaving the CIA==
===1993–1999===
After retiring from the CIA in 1993, Gates worked as an academic and lecturer. He evaluated student theses for the International Studies Program of the University of Washington. He lectured at Harvard, Yale, Johns Hopkins, Vanderbilt, Georgetown, Indiana, Louisiana State, Oklahoma, and the College of William &amp; Mary. Gates served as a member of the Board of Visitors of the University of Oklahoma International Programs Center and a trustee of the endowment fund for the College of William &amp; Mary, his alma mater, which in 1998 conferred upon him honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters. In 1996, Gates&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider&#x27;s Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War&quot;, was published. Gates has also written numerous articles on government and foreign policy and has been a frequent contributor to the op-ed page of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

===Texas A&amp;M===
Gates was the interim Dean of the Bush School of Government and Public Service at Texas A&amp;M University from 1999 to 2001. On August 1, 2002, he became the 22nd president of Texas A&amp;M. As the university president, Gates made progress in four key areas of the university&#x27;s &quot;Vision 2020&quot; plan, a plan to become one of the top 10 public universities by 2020. The four key areas include improving student diversity, increasing the size of the faculty, building new academic facilities, and enriching the undergraduate and graduate education experience. During his tenure, Gates encouraged the addition of 440 new faculty positions and a $300 million campus construction program, and saw increases in minority enrollment. On February 2, 2007, Gates was conferred the title of president emeritus by unanimous vote of the Texas A&amp;M University System Board of Regents. Gates and his wife Becky received honorary doctoral degrees from Texas A&amp;M on August 10, 2007.

Gates left the presidency of Texas A&amp;M University on December 16, 2006, and was sworn in two days later as Secretary of Defense. He returned on April 21, 2009, as the speaker for the annual Aggie Muster ceremony. He is one of only 6 speakers not to be a graduate of Texas A&amp;M University since Dwight D. Eisenhower spoke in 1946. In his affiliation with A&amp;M, Gates has served on the National Security Higher Education Advisory Board.

===Corporate boards===
Gates has been a member of the board of trustees of Fidelity Investments, and on the board of directors of NACCO Industries, Inc., Brinker International, Inc., Parker Drilling Company, Science Applications International Corporation, and VoteHere, a technology company which sought to provide cryptography and computer software security for the electronic election industry. Following his nomination, a White House spokeswoman said that Gates planned to sell all the stock he owns in individual companies and sever all ties with them if confirmed by the Senate.

===Public service===

Gates is a former president of the National Eagle Scout Association.

In January 2004, Gates co-chaired a Council on Foreign Relations task force on U.S. relations towards Iran. Among the task force&#x27;s primary recommendation was to directly engage Iran on a diplomatic level regarding Iranian nuclear technology. Key points included a negotiated position that would allow Iran to develop its nuclear program in exchange for a commitment from Iran to use the program only for peaceful means.

At the time of his nomination by President George W. Bush to the position of Secretary of Defense, Gates was also a member of the Iraq Study Group, also called the Baker Commission, which was expected to issue its report in November 2006, following the mid-term election on November 7. He was replaced by former Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger.

===Declined appointment as Director of National Intelligence===
In February 2005, Gates wrote in a message posted on his school&#x27;s website that &quot;there seems to be a growing number of rumors in the media and around campus that I am leaving Texas A&amp;M to become the new director of national intelligence in Washington, D.C.&quot; The message said that &quot;To put the rumors to rest, I was indeed asked to take the position, wrestled with perhaps the most difficult—and close—decision of my life, and last week declined the position.&quot;

Gates committed to remain as president of Texas A&amp;M University and President George W. Bush offered the position of United States Director of National Intelligence (DNI) to John Negroponte, who accepted.

Gates said in a 2005 discussion with the university&#x27;s Academy for Future International Leaders that he had tentatively decided to accept the DNI position out of a sense of duty and had written an email that would be sent to students during the press conference to announce his decision, explaining that he was leaving to serve the U.S. once again. Gates, however, took the weekend to consider what his final decision should be, and ultimately decided that he was unwilling to return to Washington, D.C., in any capacity, simply because he &quot;had nothing to look forward to in D.C. and plenty to look forward to at A&amp;M&quot;.

==Secretary of Defense==
===Bush administration===

On November 8, 2006, after the 2006 midterm election, President George W. Bush announced his intent to nominate Gates to succeed the resigning Donald Rumsfeld as U.S. Secretary of Defense.

Gates was unanimously confirmed by the United States Senate Armed Services Committee on December 5, 2006. During his confirmation hearing on December 5, 2006, Gates replied to a question that, in his opinion, the United States was neither winning nor losing the war in Iraq. The next day, Gates was confirmed by the full Senate by a margin of 95–2, with Republican Senators Rick Santorum and Jim Bunning casting the two dissenting votes and senators Elizabeth Dole, Evan Bayh, and Joe Biden not voting. On December 18, 2006, Gates was sworn in as Secretary of Defense by White House Chief of Staff Josh Bolten at a private White House ceremony and then by Vice President Dick Cheney at the Pentagon.

Under the Bush administration, Gates directed the war in Iraq&#x27;s troop surge, a marked change in tactics from his predecessor. With violence on the decline in Iraq, in 2008, Gates also began the troop withdrawal of Iraq, a policy continued into the Obama administration.

====Walter Reed Medical Center scandal====
Several months after his appointment, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; published a series of articles beginning February 18, 2007, that brought to the spotlight the Walter Reed Army Medical Center neglect scandal. As a result of the fallout from the incident, Gates announced the removal of Secretary of the Army Francis J. Harvey, and later, he approved the removal of Army Surgeon General Kevin C. Kiley.

====Controversy over Joint Chiefs====
On June 8, 2007, Gates announced that he would not recommend the renomination of Peter Pace, the Chairman of Joint Chiefs of Staff, due to anticipated difficulties with the confirmation process. Instead, Gates recommended Mike Mullen, the Chief of Naval Operations at the time, to fill the position. Gates stated: &quot;I am no stranger to contentious confirmations, and I do not shrink from them. However, I have decided that at this moment in our history, the nation, our men and women in uniform, and General Pace himself would not be well-served by a divisive ordeal in selecting the next chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.&quot; Gates referred to Pace as a friend and praised his service as a Marine.

====Misshipments of nuclear weapons====
On June 5, 2008, in response to the findings on Air Force misshipments of nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons components, Gates announced the resignations of Secretary of the Air Force Michael Wynne and Air Force Chief of Staff Michael Moseley. Gates would later write that the USAF was &quot;one of my biggest headaches&quot; during his time in the office.

===Obama administration===

On December 1, 2008, President-elect Obama announced that Robert Gates would remain in his position as Secretary of Defense during his administration, reportedly for at least the first year of Obama&#x27;s presidency. Gates was the fourteenth Cabinet member in history to serve under two presidents of different parties, and the first to do so as Secretary of Defense. One of the first priorities under President Barack Obama&#x27;s administration for Gates was a review of U.S. policy and strategy in Afghanistan. Gates, sixth in the presidential line of succession, was selected as designated survivor during Obama&#x27;s inauguration. On March 1, 2009, he told David Gregory on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; that he would not commit to how long he would serve as Secretary of Defense but implied that he would not serve the entire first term.

While Gates continued the troop withdrawals in Iraq, which already had begun in the Bush administration, he also implemented a rapid, limited surge of troops in Afghanistan in 2009. Robert Gates removed General David D. McKiernan from command in Afghanistan on May 6, 2009 and replaced him with General Stanley A. McChrystal. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; called it &quot;a rare decision to remove a wartime commander&quot;. The &quot;Washington Post&quot; described the replacement as one of several replacements of generals who represented the &quot;traditional Army&quot; with generals &quot;who have pressed for the use of counter-insurgency tactics&quot;.

In December 2009, Gates visited Afghanistan following President Barack Obama&#x27;s announcement of the deployment of 30,000 additional personnel against the Taliban insurgency.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine notes that Gates and U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have &quot;forged a formidable partnership&quot;, speaking frequently, &quot;comparing notes before they go to the White House&quot;, meeting with each other weekly and having lunch once a month at either the Pentagon or the State Department.

In a March 2010 speech to a NATO conference in Washington, Secretary Gates said that &quot;The demilitarization of Europe—where large swaths of the general public and political class are averse to military force and the risks that go with it—has gone from a blessing in the 20th century to an impediment to achieving real security and lasting peace in the 21st&quot;.

Gates announced in February 2010 that the department would lift its ban on women serving on submarines. Gates also prepared the armed forces for the repeal of the don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell policy. Since the repeal in 2010, homosexuals are able to serve in the military openly. In service of that goal, he announced in late March 2010 the approval of new regulations that would make it more difficult to kick gays out of the military. Gates called the guideline changes, which went into effect immediately, a matter of &quot;common sense and common decency&quot; that would be &quot;an important improvement&quot; allowing the Pentagon to apply current law in &quot;a fairer and more appropriate&quot; manner. The Pentagon&#x27;s legal counsel, Jeh Johnson, said the new regulations are by no means a moratorium on the current law and stressed that cases would move forward under the new standards.

In August 2010, speaking to &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine Secretary Gates said that he would remain as Secretary of Defense until 2011 and then retire. &quot;I think that it would be a mistake to wait until January 2012,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not the kind of job you want to fill in the spring of an election year.&quot;

In March 2011, Gates directed the role of the United States armed forces in the 2011 military intervention in Libya. While aboard a military aircraft on March 20, 2011, Gates told the press that &quot;military forces are just one way to bring stability to Libya&quot;.
Gates was photographed in the White House Situation Room photograph taken on May 1, 2011, by Pete Souza during the raid that killed Al-Qaeda terrorist organization leader Osama bin Laden.

Gates officially retired as Secretary of Defense on July 1, 2011, and was presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation&#x27;s highest civilian award, by President Obama during his retirement ceremony.

====Fiscal restraint====
Gates&#x27;s tenure with the Obama administration included a huge shift in military spending. In April 2009, Gates proposed a large shift in budget priorities in the U.S. Department of Defense 2010 budget. The budget cuts included many programs geared toward conventional warfare, such as the end of new orders of the F-22 Raptor and of further development of Future Combat Systems manned vehicles. These cuts were counterbalanced by increases in funding for programs like the special forces. Gates called this the &quot;nation&#x27;s first truly 21st century defense budget&quot;. In late April 2010, he suggested the Navy cease funding development of a new multibillion-dollar ballistic missile submarine program on the grounds of cost and relevancy. He suggested the hundreds of billions of dollars would be better spent on a new generation of vessels tailored to the threats and tactics more likely to be faced, noting, &quot;Mark my words, the Navy and Marine Corps must be willing to re-examine and question basic assumptions in light of evolving technologies, new threats and budget realities.&quot; In a speech made on May 8, 2010, Gates stated that he would make politically unpopular cuts to the Pentagon bureaucracy in his future budgets.


It was announced in August 2010 that Gates was trying to find $100 billion in Defense savings through to 2015, in order to instill a &quot;culture of savings and restraint&quot; in the military. Secretary Gates said that &quot;It is important that we do not repeat the mistakes of the past, where tough economic times or the winding down of a military campaign leads to steep and unwise reductions in defense&quot;. Gates said &quot;As a matter of principle and political reality, the Department of Defense cannot expect America&#x27;s elected representatives to approve budget increases each year unless we are doing a good job, indeed everything possible, to make every dollar count&quot;. These cuts included the closing of the Joint Forces Command, the redundancy of fifty general and admirals, and the removal of 150 senior civilian positions.

====NATO comments====
On January 16, 2008, Gates was quoted in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; as saying NATO forces in southern Afghanistan do not know how to properly combat a guerrilla insurgency and that could be contributing to rising violence in the country. The Netherlands and United Kingdom protested.

In a June 10, 2011, speech in Brussels, before NATO, Gates again stated that other NATO members must do more as the United States tackles its budget deficit. He said bluntly that

In the past, I&#x27;ve worried openly about NATO turning into a two-tiered alliance: Between members who specialize in &quot;soft&quot; humanitarian, development, peacekeeping and talking tasks, and those conducting the &quot;hard&quot; combat missions. Between those willing and able to pay the price and bear the burdens of alliance commitments, and those who enjoy the benefits of NATO membership—be they security guarantees or headquarters billets—but don&#x27;t want to share the risks and the costs. This is no longer a hypothetical worry. We are there today. And it is unacceptable. The blunt reality is that there will be dwindling appetite and patience in the U.S. Congress—and in the American body politic writ large—to expend increasingly precious funds on behalf of nations that are apparently unwilling to devote the necessary resources or make the necessary changes to be serious and capable partners in their own defense. Nations apparently willing and eager for American taxpayers to assume the growing security burden left by reductions in European defense budgets. Indeed, if current trends in the decline of European defense capabilities are not halted and reversed, future U.S. political leaders—those for whom the Cold War was not the formative experience that it was for me—may not consider the return on America&#x27;s investment in NATO worth the cost.

==College chancellor (2011–present)==

On September 6, 2011, it was announced that Gates had accepted the position of chancellor at the College of William &amp; Mary, succeeding Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor for a seven-year term. He took the office of the chancellor on February 3, 2012.

In September 2018, Gates was re-appointed to serve a second seven-year term as chancellor at the College of William &amp; Mary.

===Extracurricular activities===

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Gates participated as a member of the National Advisory Council for the COVID Collaborative.

===Memoirs===
In his memoir, &quot;Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War&quot;, Gates alternately criticized and praised Obama&#x27;s military leadership, writing, &quot;I never doubted [his] support for the troops, only his support for their mission [in Afghanistan]&quot;, and &quot;I was very proud to work for a president who had made one of the most courageous decisions I had ever witnessed in the White House&quot; by authorizing the 2011 raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Of then Vice-President Joe Biden, Gates wrote &quot;“I think he has been wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades.”

==Criticism==

As deputy director and director of America&#x27;s leading intelligence agency for many years, Gates and his CIA staff have been faulted for failing to accurately gauge the decline and disintegration of the Soviet Union. More particularly, Gates has been criticized for allegedly concocting evidence to show that the Soviet Union was stronger than it actually was. George Shultz said that, while Secretary of State from 1982 to 1989, he felt the CIA under Gates was trying to &quot;manipulate&quot; him, that the agency was &quot;a big powerful machine not under good control. I distrust what comes out of it.&quot; Shultz personally convinced Reagan that the U.S. should soften its stance towards the USSR after Gorbachev came to power in 1985; Shultz told Gates at the time that his CIA was &quot;usually wrong&quot; about the Soviet Union, having dismissed Gorbachev&#x27;s policies as &quot;just another Soviet attempt to deceive us.&quot; In 1991, Stansfield Turner, former Director of Central Intelligence, described the &quot;enormity of this failure to forecast the magnitude of the Soviet crisis. ... I never heard a suggestion from the CIA ... that numerous Soviets recognized a growing systemic economic problem.&quot; Turner said this failure was a consequence of deliberate distortion by those in the upper echelon of the CIA who were helping to sell the Reagan administration&#x27;s defense buildup, a view backed by former CIA analyst Melvin Goodman at Gates&#x27;s 1991 confirmation hearings: &quot;[William] Casey seized on every opportunity to exaggerate the Soviet threat ... [while] Gates&#x27; role in this activity was to corrupt the process and the ethics of intelligence.&quot; Reviewing the third installment of Gates&#x27;s memoirs in 2016, Goodman said, &quot;In my 24 years at the CIA, there was never the kind of toxic atmosphere that existed when Gates served as deputy director for intelligence, deputy director of CIA, and finally director of CIA.&quot; Also, according to &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Gates, as deputy director of CIA, allegedly vouched for the comprehensiveness of a CIA study presented to the Senate and President Reagan alleging that the Soviet Union played a role in the 1981 shooting of Pope John Paul II. A CIA internal review later denounced the report as being skewed, but that Gates did not try to influence the report&#x27;s conclusions.

Shortly after his retirement from his tenure as Defense Secretary in summer 2011, during a meeting of the National Security Council Principals Committee, Gates highlighted many of the measures taken by the U.S. to advance Israel&#x27;s security during the Obama administration, including providing access to state of the art weaponry, assisting with the development of missile-defense systems, and sharing high-level intelligence, before expressing his view that the U.S. has received nothing in return from the Israeli government with regard to the peace process. According to senior U.S. administration sources, other officials present offered no rebuttal to Gates&#x27;s analysis. This was not the first time Gates publicly expressed frustration with the Netanyahu government, with which he had worked hard to provide wide-scale and deep military cooperation. The Likud party of Israel responded to Gates&#x27;s description of Benjamin Netanyahu as a danger to Israel&#x27;s future by claiming that most Israelis support the prime minister.

<text>Dover College is an independent day and boarding school in the English public school tradition located in Dover in south east England. It was founded in 1871, and takes both day pupils and boarders from the UK and internationally.

The school occupies some of the medieval buildings of Dover Priory, on a site just east of the eponymous railway station.

== History ==

===Foundation===

In 1869 Robert Chignell, who had a private school at Westmount, in Folkestone Road, leased part of the Dover Priory buildings for a private school. He passed on his interest, however, to a group of leading citizens and local businessmen in Dover, led by the Mayor of Dover, Dr. Astley, who had formed the Dover College Company to promote the foundation of a public school for the town on what remained of the Priory site with the dual intention of providing a public school education for local boys and of using and thus preserving the Priory&#x27;s remaining ancient buildings.

It is set in the grounds and ruins of the Priory of St. Martin, which was ransacked by King Henry VIII as part of his dissolution of the monasteries. The priory gives its name to Dover&#x27;s main railway station which was built on the western part of the priory site. Some of the original medieval buildings remain. The 12th century Strangers&#x27; Refectory is still used as an eating hall and for concerts (it is Grade II* listed). The college chapel was originally the priory guesthouse, it was built in the 12th century, it is Grade II* listed.
The bell tower was added in the late 19th century. The gatehouse of the priory (also listed) is used as a music room. The central lawn of the school is still referred to as The Close. The composer Thomas Tallis was organist to the priory in the late 16th century, and is commemorated in the naming of the college&#x27;s Tallis Music School.

The College was founded and opened as a boys&#x27; school on 15 September 1871. By the end of the first term there were 21 boys in the school, and by the end of the next summer another 32 had joined them. It acquired the large hall, or guest-house, in 1879 and converted it into a school Chapel by enlarging the east end into an apse. In time, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners made over the whole property to the College Trustees. The refectory was restored, revealing an important but damaged fresco, as (in 1881, to mark a charitable act by Sir Richard Dickenson the then mayor of Dover) was the gatehouse. The Gatehouse was restored by the celebrated architect George Edmund Street and is currently used as the music room for the Junior Department.

===20th century===
In August 1917, part of the school was damaged during an air raid, and the decision was finally taken to evacuate the College from Dover to Leamington College in Leamington Spa in the Midlands; the school returned to Dover in 1919 with only 150 pupils. During World War I, in common with many other schools, Old Dovorians became officers in the British Armed Forces and as a result suffered high casualty rates. 177 former pupils died; 58 Dovorians were awarded the DSO and 89 the MC – of the foreign awards 8 were awarded Croix de Guerre and 6 the Russian Order of Saint Stanislas. One Naval officer – Arthur Leyland Harrison – posthumously received the Victoria Cross for the Zeebrugge raid; another old boy, Gen Sir Reginald Dallas Brooks, was also on that raid and won his DSO before going on to become Governor of Victoria.

In 1921 the Jubilee of the School was celebrated, including the dedication of the War Memorial and the Bell Memorial in the Chapel. 1922 a trust set up by the old boys took ownership of the College and in 1923 it was reconstituted with a Royal Charter, which defined its aims:

:&quot;The object of the Corporation of Dover College shall be the conduct of a College for boys … in which they may receive a sound religious, classical, mathematical, scientific and general education and the doing of such things as are conducive to the attainment of this objective&quot;.

During the Second World War, Dover was on the front line, with only the Straits of Dover separating the town from Nazi-occupied France, and one of the most likely areas for a German invasion. As a result, the school was again evacuated, initially for a term to Blundell&#x27;s School in Devon with which Dover College had a long-standing friendship, and thence to Poltimore House, also in Devon. It returned to Dover in 1945 with 168 boys. During the war 102 former pupils died; Lt Col Terence Otway won a famous DSO for his action in capturing the Merville Battery on D-Day.

In 1957 was the first public school in the UK to formally create an International Department. In 1974, Dover College was one of the first English public schools to become fully co-educational.

In 1990 the college was taken to court by its head of history who claimed unfair dismissal on the grounds of illness. The case is known as Hogg v Dover College.

=== 21st century ===
In September 2001 Dover College opened a junior department for pupils aged 4–11. In 2009, it opened a pre-reception class to welcome three-year-old children.

The college renovated its music facilities under Stephen Jones, Headmaster from 2004 to 2011 who went on to be Warden of St. Edward&#x27;s School, Oxford. Under the leadership of Gerry Holden from 2011 to 2014, the college went through a period of change, which was re-directed upon the appointment of Gareth Doodes as headmaster from January 2015. In the intervening years the college now has the highest inspection judgements possible, an increase in the school roll, and a new curriculum based on creativity. In preparation for the college&#x27;s 150th anniversary in 2021, the college launched a new development plan, Project 150, that will see the building of a new theatre, pavilion at Farthingloe, renovation of boarding houses and classrooms, and improved international outreach with membership of the Round Square Organisation.

== Coat of arms ==
The school coat of arms shows St. Martin dividing his cloak, which he shared with a beggar. Martin of Tours is patron saint of France, and therefore appropriate for the English school closer than any other to France.
