<text>Daikokuten () is a syncretic Japanese deity of fortune and wealth. Daikokuten originated from Mahākāla, the Buddhist version of the native Shinto god Ōkuninushi.

==Overview==
===Mahākāla in East Asian Buddhism===

The Sanskrit term &#x27;Mahākāla&#x27; (&quot;Great Black [One]&quot;, &quot;Great Time&quot; or &quot;Great Death&quot;) was originally one of the epithets of the Hindu god Shiva in his aspect as time (&quot;kāla&quot;), the ultimate destroyer of all things. This title and aspect of Shiva was eventually adopted by Buddhism, where Mahākāla became reinterpreted as a &quot;dharmapāla&quot; or a protector of the Buddhist dharma but also as a terrifying deity who roams the forests at night with hordes of ghouls and demons in his train.

Mahākāla is mentioned in many Chinese Buddhist texts, although iconographic depictions of him in China were rare during the Tang and Song periods. He eventually became the center of a flourishing cult after the 9th century in the kingdoms of Nanzhao and Dali in what is now the province of Yunnan, a region bordering Tibet, where his cult was also widespread. Due to Tibetan influence, his importance further increased during the Mongol-led Yuan dynasty, with his likeness being displayed in the imperial palace and in Buddhist temples inside and outside the capital (though most of these images are now no longer extant). The deity&#x27;s name was both transcribed into Chinese characters as (&quot;Makakara / Makakyara&quot;; Middle Chinese (Baxter): &quot;ma xa kae la&quot;) and translated as (&quot;Daikokuten&quot;, &#x27;Great Black Deva&#x27;, with &quot;kāla&quot; being understood to mean &#x27;black&#x27;; MC (Baxter): &quot;dajH xok then&quot;).

In some texts, Mahākāla is described as a fearsome god, a &quot;demon who steals the vital essence (of people)&quot; and who feeds on flesh and blood, though he is also said to only devour those who committed sins against the Three Jewels of Buddhism. One story found in the Tang-era monk Yi Xing&#x27;s commentary on the &quot;Mahāvairocana Tantra&quot; portrays Mahākāla as a manifestation of the buddha Vairocana who subjugated the ḍākinīs, a race of flesh-eating female demons, by swallowing them. Mahākāla released them on the condition that they no longer kill humans, decreeing that they could only eat the heart – believed to contain the vital essence of humans known as &#x27;human yellow&#x27; (, &quot;jin&#x27;ō&quot;) – of those who were near death. A tale found in Amoghavajra&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Humane King Sūtra&quot; relates how a heterodox (i.e. non-Buddhist) master instructed Prince Kalmāṣapāda (斑足王) to offer the heads of a thousand kings to Mahākāla, the &quot;great black god of the graveyard&quot; (), if he wished to ascend the throne of his kingdom.

As time went by, Mahākāla also became seen as a guardian of Buddhist monasteries, especially its kitchens. The monk Yijing, who traveled to Srivijaya and India during the late 7th century, claimed that images of Mahākāla were to be found in the kitchens and porches of Indian Buddhist monasteries, before which offerings of food were made:

Yijing then relates an anecdote about how the deity once miraculously provided food for five hundred monks who came to visit the monastery of Makuṭabandhana in Kushinagar after one of the female servants prayed and made offerings before his image. This idea of Mahākāla as one who brought prosperity to monasteries and granted wishes may have contributed to the identification of the deity as a god of wealth and fortune in Japan.

In China, the god was also associated with fertility and sexuality: during the Qixi Festival (a.k.a. the Double Seventh Festival) held on the 7th day of the 7th month of the Chinese calendar, married women traditionally bought dolls or figurines called &#x27;Móhéluó&#x27; () or &#x27;Móhóuluó&#x27; () – the term probably deriving from &#x27;Mahākāla&#x27; – in the hopes of giving birth to a child. Ritual texts also prescribe the worship of Mahākāla to women looking for a male partner or to pregnant women.

===Transformation in Japan===
Upon being introduced to Japan via the esoteric Tendai and Shingon sects, Mahākāla (as &#x27;Daikokuten&#x27;) gradually transformed into a jovial, beneficent figure as his positive qualities (such as being the purveyor of wealth and fertility) increasingly came to the fore – mostly at the expense of his darker traits. Whereas earlier images of Daikokuten showed him as wrathful (or at least stern-faced), later artworks consistently came to portray him as smiling.

Saichō, the founder of the Tendai school, is credited with bringing the cult of Mahākāla-Daikokuten to Japan. Legend claims that when he first climbed Mount Hiei (located northeast of Kyoto), Mahākāla appeared to him in the form of an old man and offered to become the guardian of the monastic community envisioned by Saichō, what would become known as Enryaku-ji.

By the medieval period, when Buddhism and native Japanese beliefs (Shinto) were becoming syncretized, Daikokuten became conflated with the native &quot;kami&quot; Ōkuninushi (大国主), as the first two characters of the latter&#x27;s name (大国) can also be read as &#x27;Daikoku&#x27;. Daikokuten&#x27;s status as patron of Enryaku-ji also influenced this connection: he was identified with Sannō Gongen, the deity enshrined in Hiyoshi Taisha at the eastern foot of Mount Hiei, who in turn was identified with Ōkuninushi or Ōmononushi (Miwa Myōjin, the god of Mount Miwa in Nara Prefecture who is also interpreted as Ōkuninushi under another name or an aspect of his).
The sack or bag Daikokuten carries (already attested in Yijing&#x27;s description of portrayals of Mahākāla in India) served to further associate the god with Ōkuninushi: in the story of the Hare of Inaba (found in the ), the young Ōkuninushi is said to have originally been treated by his wicked elder brothers as their luggage carrier. Besides the sack, Daikokuten began to acquire other attributes such as the golden mallet called &quot;uchide no kozuchi&quot; (lit. &quot;tap-appear little mallet&quot;, i.e. a mallet that strikes out anything the user desires) and two big bales of rice. He was also considered a god of fertility, and was thus also portrayed making the obscene fig sign, carrying a suggestively bifurcated daikon (sometimes called the &quot;bride of Daikoku&quot;), sporting a huge erect penis, or being entirely represented himself by a wooden phallus.

Mice and rats also became a part of Daikokuten&#x27;s iconography, due to Mahākāla&#x27;s association with Vaiśravaṇa (&quot;Bishamonten&quot; in Japanese), the Buddhist analogue to the Hindu Kubera, and Pañcika, Vaiśravaṇa&#x27;s general and consort of the yakshini goddess Hārītī (known in Japan as &quot;Kishimojin&quot;), who were both associated with the northern direction – which corresponds to the sign of the Rat in the Chinese zodiac. (One of the twelve dikpālas or guardians of the directions in Buddhism is Īśāna, the guardian of the northeast who, like Mahākāla, is a Buddhicized form of Shiva.) This also contributed to the conflation of Daikokuten with Ōkuninushi, as mice also figured in the latter&#x27;s mythology.
Medieval exegetes interpreted Mahākāla-Daikokuten in both a positive and a negative way: on the one hand he was seen as a symbol of fundamental ignorance (expressed by the name &#x27;Daikoku&#x27;, which can be interpreted as &quot;great darkness&quot;), but on the other hand he also represented the nonduality of ignorance (symbolized by the character 黒, &#x27;black(ness) / dark(ness)&#x27;) and enlightenment (designated by the character 大, &#x27;great&#x27;). He was identified with Ichiji Kinrin (Ekākṣaroṣṇīṣacakra, a manifestation of both the cosmic buddha Vairocana – specifically, Vairocana&#x27;s head knob or &quot;uṣṇīṣa&quot; – and the sacred syllable &quot;bhrūṃ&quot;) and thus a symbol of ultimate reality, but also with the directional deity Īśāna (who as noted earlier was another deity derived from Shiva), who is also considered to be a god of obstacles. Indeed, because of the stigma related to his origins, he was identified in some texts as a &quot;jissha&quot; (実者, lit. &quot;true/real one&quot;, also known as 実類, &quot;jitsurui&quot;), a &#x27;real&#x27; god considered inferior to deities who are provisional manifestations of enlightened buddhas and bodhisattvas (&quot;gongen&quot;). However, medieval esoteric Buddhism also posited the existence of a &#x27;higher&#x27; Daikokuten, the conventional Daikokuten being but one of the various guises he takes. While the latter represented ignorance, the former was seen as transmuting ignorance into awakening.

Daikokuten was also linked or identified with other deities such as Ugajin, Benzaiten (the Buddhist version of Sarasvatī), Vaiśravana-Bishamonten, the earth god Kenrō Jijin (derived from the Indian earth goddess Pṛthivī, though the deity is also portrayed in Japan as male), or the wisdom king Acala (&quot;Fudō Myōō&quot; in Japanese). Indeed, Acala, like Mahākāla-Daikokuten, is credited in some sources with defeating and converting the ḍākinīs and is also considered to be a wrathful avatar of Vairocana. (Likewise, Acala is also thought by some scholars to be derived in one way or another from Shiva.)

In popular belief, Daikokuten is also commonly paired with the folk deity Ebisu. Just as Daikokuten was conflated with Ōkuninushi, Ebisu was sometimes identified with Ōkuninushi&#x27;s son Kotoshironushi or the dwarf god Sukunabikona, who assisted Ōkuninushi in developing the land of Japan. In homes, the two deities were enshrined in the kitchen or oven, while merchants worshiped them as patron deities of commercial success. Farmers meanwhile revered them as gods of the rice paddy (&quot;ta-no-kami&quot;).

==Iconography==
Mahākāla was originally represented in East Asian Buddhist art as a dark-skinned wrathful deity wearing a diadem and a necklace of skulls, with snakes coiled around his neck and arms. One iconographic type portrays him with three heads and six arms, holding a flayed elephant skin with his upper hands, a trident or a sword horizontally with his lower hands, and a human figure and a goat with his middle hands. Many artworks of this type show Mahākāla in a sitting position, though a description of the deity found in the dictionary compiled by the monk Huilin (慧琳) titled &quot;The Sound and Meaning of All Sutras&quot; (, pinyin: &quot;Yīqièjīng yīnyì&quot;) has him standing on the hands of the earth goddess. The same work describes Mahākāla as having eight arms, holding an elephant skin, a trident, a preta, a goat, a sword, and a &quot;khatvāṅga&quot; (a skull-topped club or staff). Some images of Mahākāla of this type found in Dunhuang (dating from the 9th-10th centuries) meanwhile show him standing on a snake. Another iconographic variant (not found in Chinese texts but attested in Japan) depicts Mahākāla with one head and two arms, holding a sword in his right hand and a skull cup (&quot;kapāla&quot;) in his left. He is sometimes also shown as trampling on the elephant-headed deity Vināyaka (the Buddhist analogue to the Hindu Ganesha, though the Buddhist version is sometimes also perceived as a negative figure), another deity Mahākāla is associated with. Indeed, the two deities are shown together in the outer northeast (upper left) corner of the Womb Realm (&quot;Garbhadhātu&quot;) Maṇḍala, one of the two main maṇḍalas of East Asian esoteric Buddhism.


Yijing describes the statues of Mahākāla he had seen in Indian monasteries as &quot;holding a golden bag and seated on a small chair, with one foot hanging down towards the ground.&quot; Some scholars believe that the images Yijing saw may have actually been that of the god Kubera, who was represented in Indian art as carrying a money bag; indeed, he identifies &#x27;Mahākāla&#x27; as being part of the retinue of the &quot;great god&quot; (大天, i.e. Mahādeva / Maheśvara). It is thought that the two gods may have been conflated at some point; images of both deities are commonly found guarding the entrances of temples in India, Nepal and other places influenced by Hindu-Buddhist culture, and Kubera was, as mentioned, closely associated with Shiva. The image of the sack-carrying Daikokuten that would become the standard in Japan is thus thought to be derived from Kubera&#x27;s iconography.
The earliest Japanese representations of Mahākāla-Daikokuten can be classified into two types: one (associated with the Shingon school) shows the deity standing, his left hand holding a sack slung over his shoulder, with his right hand clenched into a fist and resting on the right hip, while the other (associated with the Tendai school) depicts him as sitting. Most of these images show Daikokuten wearing Japanese clothing, though a few has him wearing armor. The standing portrayal is first mentioned in the 10th-century Shingon work &quot;Yōson dōjōkan&quot; (要尊道場観, &#x27;Visualizations of the Ritual Spheres of the Essential Deities&#x27;) and an apocryphal 11th-century text titled &quot;Daikokutenjin-hō&quot; (大黒天神法, &#x27;The Tantra of Mahākāla&#x27;), while the seated portrayal&#x27;s first literary appearance is in the 13th-century &quot;Asabashō&quot; (阿娑縛抄), a Tendai iconographical and ritual compendium. The &quot;Daikokutenjin-hō&quot; describes Daikokuten as black in color, wearing &quot;eboshi&quot; (烏帽子, a black cap worn by Japanese noblemen), &quot;kariginu&quot; (狩衣, informal aristocratic outerwear), and &quot;hakama&quot; (loose, skirt-like trousers), with his right fist resting at his waist and his left hand clutching a large bag, the color of which is that of rat&#x27;s hair.
The oldest surviving examples of the two iconographic variants date from around the 11th century (late Heian period). The oldest standing Daikokuten statue is found in Kanzeon-ji in Dazaifu, Fukuoka Prefecture and depicts him wearing &quot;eboshi,&quot; knee-length &quot;hakama&quot;, and shoes. The oldest depiction of the sitting Daikokuten, kept in Kongōrin-ji in Echi District, Shiga Prefecture, meanwhile, shows him wearing armor, seated on a rock and holding a small bag and a club or staff.

Daikokuten&#x27;s iconography evolved during the 14th century onwards, when he increasingly became portrayed as a smiling man with a rotund belly, holding a mallet and standing or sitting on rice bales. The origin of the mallet attribute is uncertain, although Bernard Faure (2015) links it with Mahākāla-Daikokuten&#x27;s association with the cult of the Saptamātṛkas (the &#x27;Seven Mothers&#x27;), who are pictured as holding mallets – symbolizing their role as plague deities – in the Madarijin (摩怛哩神) ritual. During the 16th century (late Muromachi period), the three deities Daikokuten, Vaiśravaṇa-Bishamonten and Sarasvatī-Benzaiten were fused together into the three-headed &#x27;Sanmen Daikokuten&#x27; (三面大黒天, lit. &quot;Three-Faced Daikokuten&quot;), which in a way &#x27;reconnected&#x27; the deity&#x27;s popular benign form with his less well-known wrathful form. This form was eventually introduced in later variants of the legend of Daikokuten&#x27;s apparition to Saichō in Mount Hiei: in response to Saichō&#x27;s dilemma over how to provide daily sustenance for three thousand monks, the god is now said to have shown himself to the latter with three faces and six arms.

An iconographic grouping known as the &#x27;Roku Daikoku&#x27; (六大黒天, lit. &quot;Six Daikoku&quot;) also developed during the same period, showing the deity in six different forms:

# Biku Daikoku (比丘大黒): Daikokuten in the form of a Buddhist monk (&quot;bhikkhu&quot;), holding a mallet in his right hand and a sword in his left
# Ōji Kara Daikoku (王子迦羅大黒): Daikokuten as a prince (王子, &quot;ōji&quot;) brandishing a sword and a vajra; sometimes interpreted as Mahākāla-Daikokuten&#x27;s son
# Yasha Daikoku (夜叉大黒): Daikokuten as the subduer of demons (&quot;yakṣa&quot;), wearing Japanese aristocratic garb and holding a wheel (&quot;dharmacakra&quot;) in his right hand
# Makakara Daikokunyo (摩伽迦羅大黒女): Daikokuten as a female figure holding a bale of rice above her head; sometimes interpreted as Mahākāla-Daikokuten&#x27;s consort (i.e. Mahākāḷī)
# Shinda Daikoku (信陀大黒 or 真陀大黒): Daikokuten as a boy with the wish-granting jewel (&quot;cintāmaṇi&quot;) in his hand
# Makara Daikoku (摩伽羅大黒): Daikokuten in his &#x27;regular&#x27; benign form, holding a mallet and a sack

The 17th-18th centuries (Edo period) marked the appearance of the cult of the Seven Lucky Gods (), of which Daikokuten is a key member. Daikokuten&#x27;s rise in popularity among the common people during the late medieval and early modern periods led to the god becoming a popular subject in art.

==Worship==

The god continues to enjoy an exalted position as a deity of fortune and the household in Japan. Images of Daikokuten can be found in both Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines in the country (a relic of the long-standing fusion of the two religions), though in the latter case, these are usually interpreted and revered as representations of the Japanese god Ōkuninushi rather than the Buddhist Mahākāla.

Due to his association with rats, days under the zodiac sign of the Rat (子日, &quot;ne-no-hi&quot;), especially that of the Yang Wood Rat (甲子, &quot;kōshi&quot; / &quot;kinoe-ne&quot;) are considered to be sacred to Mahākāla-Daikokuten (and by extension, Ōkuninushi), with the first (初甲子, &quot;hatsu kōshi&quot;) and last &quot;kōshi&quot; days (納め甲子, &quot;osame kōshi&quot;) of a given year being especially held in great esteem. Special ceremonies and festivals are held on these days at many places of worship dedicated to the deity.

During the early modern period, Daikokuten&#x27;s association with wealth and prosperity precipitated a custom known as &quot;fukunusubi&quot;, or &quot;theft of fortune&quot;. This custom started with the belief that whoever stole divine figures was assured of good fortune if not caught in the act. The &quot;toshi-no-ichi&quot; (year-end market) held at Sensō-ji in Asakusa became the main venue of the sale and disposal of such images by the fortune-seekers. Many small stalls were opened where articles including images of Daikokuten were sold on the eve of New Year celebrations. Another practice known as &quot;tsubute&quot; (礫, lit. &quot;stone throwing&quot;) involved &#x27;stealing&#x27; the wealth from a rich house by throwing into it a Daikokuten talisman at the hour of the rat (around midnight).

An esoteric ritual performed in many Tendai temples where Daikokuten is worshiped known as &quot;yokubei-ku&quot; (浴餅供, lit. &quot;glutinous rice bath&quot;) involves pouring rice porridge over a statue of the deity.

===Bījā and mantra===
The &quot;bīja&quot; or seed syllable used to represent Mahākāla-Daikokuten in Japanese esoteric Buddhism is (म), written in Siddhaṃ script. Mahākāla&#x27;s mantra meanwhile is as follows:

=== Temples ===

The following are a few examples of Buddhist temples that either have Daikokuten as their main focus of worship (&quot;honzon&quot;) or enshrine him in an auxiliary capacity.

* Enryaku-ji (Ōtsu, Shiga Prefecture) – Tendai
:The Daikoku-dō (大黒堂, &quot;Hall of Daikoku&quot;) located in the temple complex enshrines an image of the three-faced Sanmen Daikokuten attributed to Saichō, who is said to have made it after the god appeared to him and promised to become the patron of his monastic community.
* Daikoku-ji (大黒寺) (Habikino City, Osaka Prefecture) – Sōtō Zen
:One of the contenders for the birthplace of the cult of Mahākāla-Daikokuten in Japan. The temple&#x27;s founding story claims that it was first established in 665 CE by the ascetic En no Gyōja after seeing a vision of Daikokuten riding a five-colored cloud.
* Daikoku-ji (Fushimi-ku, Kyoto) – Shingon (Tōji-ha)
:Said to have been established by Kūkai, the founder of Shingon Buddhism, to whom is also attributed the image of Daikokuten that serve as the temple&#x27;s &quot;honzon&quot;. Originally named Chōfuku-ji (長福寺), the temple was renamed in 1615 after Shimazu Yoshihiro designated it as a &quot;prayer center&quot; (祈願所, &quot;kigansho&quot;) for his clan, the Shimazu, and their fiefdom, Satsuma Domain, where religious services are performed on their behalf.
*Myōen-ji (妙円寺) (Matsugasaki Higashimachi, Sakyō-ku, Kyoto) – Nichiren-shū
:Founded in 1616; also known as Matsugasaki Daikokuten (松ヶ崎大黒天). Enshrines a statue of Daikokuten attributed to Saichō.
* Mano-dera / Mano-ji (真野寺) (Kubo, Minamibōsō, Chiba Prefecture) – Shingon (Chisan-ha)
:This temple, founded by Gyōki in 725 CE and dedicated to the Thousand-Armed Avalokiteśvara (Senju Kannon), enshrines an image of Daikokuten claimed to be the work of the Tendai priest Ennin, known as the &#x27; Kaiun Daikokuten&#x27; (朝日開運大黒天) – so named because Ennin is claimed to have carved it in the year 860 after witnessing a vision of the god at daybreak, as the sun was rising.
* Eishin-ji (英信寺) (Shitaya, Taitō City, Tokyo) – Jōdo-shū
:A temple to the buddha Amitabha (Amida Nyorai) established in 1631. A statue of Sanmen Daikokuten attributed to Kūkai is enshrined in the Daikoku-dō beside the temple&#x27;s main hall.
* Gokoku-in (護国院) (Taitō City, Tokyo) – Tendai
:Part of the Ueno Park-Kan&#x27;ei-ji temple complex. Enshrines a painting of Daikokuten attributed to Fujiwara no Nobuzane donated to the temple by Tokugawa Iemitsu.
* Kyōō-ji (経王寺) (Haramachi, Shinjuku City, Tokyo) – Nichiren-shū
:Founded in 1598 by the monk Nichijō, who installed there an image of Daikokuten from Kuon-ji said to have been carved by Nichiren&#x27;s disciple Nippō.
* Daihō-ji (大法寺) (Moto-Azabu, Minato City, Tokyo) – Nichiren-shū
:Founded in 1597. The image of Daikokuten kept in this temple, known as &#x27;Sanshin Gusoku Daikoku-sonten&#x27; (三神具足大黒尊天), features the deity with the attributes of Benzaiten (hairstyle) and Bishamonten (armor).
*Hōju-ji (宝珠寺) – (Onogawamachi, Yonezawa City, Yamagata Prefecture) – Shingon (Daigo-ha)
:Popularly known as Kinoe-ne Daikokuten Honzan (甲子大黒天本山). The image of Daikokuten in this temple is attributed to Kūkai and was originally from Dainichi-ji (大日寺, in modern Nishikawa, Nishimurayama District), one of the four &quot;bettō-ji&quot; (administrative temples) of Mount Yudono, one of the Three Sacred Mountains of Dewa Province (Dewa Sanzan). The statue was transferred to its current location after Dainichi-ji was converted into a Shinto shrine during the Meiji period.

== In popular culture ==
One theory claims that the term &quot;daikoku-bashira&quot; (大黒柱), referring to the central supporting pillar of a traditional Japanese house, originated from Daikokuten&#x27;s name. This word has also come to figuratively refer to the chief breadwinner of a family. The wife of a Buddhist monk was also referred to in popular slang as &quot;Daikoku,&quot; due to Daikokuten&#x27;s association with the kitchen and the household in general.

A traditional art widely performed during the medieval and early modern periods known as &quot;Daikoku-mai&quot; (大黒舞, lit. &quot;dance of Daikoku&quot;) involved performers – usually social outcasts (&quot;hinin&quot;) – costumed as Daikokuten going from door to door to dance and sing in exchange for donations.

Figurines or plaques of his image can be found in shops throughout Japan.

<doc id="857710" wikidata="Q3930278" url="?curid=857710" title="Time–frequency representation">
<text>A time–frequency representation (TFR) is a view of a signal (taken to be a function of time) represented over both time and frequency. Time–frequency analysis means analysis into the time–frequency domain provided by a TFR. This is achieved by using a formulation often called &quot;Time–Frequency Distribution&quot;, abbreviated as TFD.

TFRs are often complex-valued fields over time and frequency, where the modulus of the field represents either amplitude or &quot;energy density&quot; (the concentration of the root mean square over time and frequency), and the argument of the field represents phase.

== Background and motivation ==
A signal, as a function of time, may be considered as a representation with perfect &quot;time resolution&quot;.
In contrast, the magnitude of the Fourier transform (FT) of the signal may be considered as a representation with perfect &quot;spectral resolution&quot; but with no time information because the magnitude of the FT conveys frequency content but it fails to convey when, in time, different events occur in the signal.

TFRs provide a bridge between these two representations in that they provide &quot;some&quot; temporal information and &quot;some&quot; spectral information simultaneously. Thus, TFRs are useful for the representation and analysis of signals containing multiple time-varying frequencies.

== Formulation of TFRs and TFDs ==

One form of TFR (or TFD) can be formulated by the multiplicative comparison of a signal with itself, expanded in different directions about each point in time. Such representations and formulations are known as quadratic or &quot;bilinear&quot; TFRs or TFDs (QTFRs or QTFDs) because the representation is quadratic in the signal (see Bilinear time–frequency distribution). This formulation was first described by Eugene Wigner in 1932 in the context of quantum mechanics and, later, reformulated as a general TFR by Ville in 1948 to form what is now known as the Wigner–Ville distribution, as it was shown in that Wigner&#x27;s formula needed to use the analytic signal defined in Ville&#x27;s paper to be useful as a representation and for a practical analysis. Today, QTFRs include the spectrogram (squared magnitude of short-time Fourier transform), the scaleogram (squared magnitude of Wavelet transform) and the smoothed pseudo-Wigner distribution. 

Although quadratic TFRs offer perfect temporal and spectral resolutions simultaneously, the quadratic nature of the transforms creates cross-terms, also called &quot;interferences&quot;. The cross-terms caused by the bilinear structure of TFDs and TFRs may be useful in some applications such as classification as the cross-terms provide extra detail for the recognition algorithm. However, in some other applications, these cross-terms may plague certain quadratic TFRs and they would need to be reduced. One way to do this is obtained by comparing the signal with a different function. Such resulting representations are known as linear TFRs because the representation is linear in the signal. An example of such a representation is the &quot;windowed Fourier transform&quot; (also known as the short-time Fourier transform) which localises the signal by modulating it with a window function, before performing the Fourier transform to obtain the frequency content of the signal in the region of the window.

== Wavelet transforms ==
Wavelet transforms, in particular the continuous wavelet transform, expand the signal in terms of wavelet functions which are localised in both time and frequency. Thus the wavelet transform of a signal may be represented in terms of both time and frequency. Continuous wavelet transform analysis is very useful for identifying non-stationary signals in time series, such as those related to climate or landslides.

The notions of time, frequency, and amplitude used to generate a TFR from a wavelet transform were originally developed intuitively. In 1992, a quantitative derivation of these relationships was published, based upon a stationary phase approximation.

== Linear canonical transformation ==
Linear canonical transformations are the linear transforms of the time–frequency representation that preserve the symplectic form. These include and generalize the Fourier transform, fractional Fourier transform, and others, thus providing a unified view of these transforms in terms of their action on the time–frequency domain.

<text>Sir W G Armstrong Whitworth &amp; Co Ltd was a major British manufacturing company of the early years of the 20th century. With headquarters in Elswick, Newcastle upon Tyne, Armstrong Whitworth built armaments, ships, locomotives, automobiles and aircraft.

The company was founded by William Armstrong in 1847, becoming Armstrong Mitchell and then Armstrong Whitworth through mergers. In 1927, it merged with Vickers Limited to form Vickers-Armstrongs, with its automobile and aircraft interests purchased by J D Siddeley.

==History==
In 1847, the engineer William George Armstrong founded the Elswick works at Newcastle, to produce hydraulic machinery, cranes and bridges, soon to be followed by artillery, notably the Armstrong breech-loading gun, with which the British Army was re-equipped after the Crimean War. In 1882, it merged with the shipbuilding firm of Charles Mitchell to form Armstrong Mitchell &amp; Company and at the time its works extended for over a mile (about 2 km) along the bank of the River Tyne.
Armstrong Mitchell merged again with the engineering firm of Joseph Whitworth in 1897. The company expanded into the manufacture of cars and trucks in 1902, and created an &quot;aerial department&quot; in 1913, which became the Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft subsidiary in 1920.

In 1927, it merged with Vickers Limited to form Vickers-Armstrongs.

=== Automobiles ===

The Armstrong Whitworth was manufactured from 1904, when the company decided to diversify to compensate for a fall in demand for artillery after the end of the Boer War. It took over construction of the Wilson-Pilcher, designed by Walter Gordon Wilson, and produced cars under the Armstrong Whitworth name until 1919, when the company merged with Siddeley-Deasy and to form Armstrong Siddeley.

The Wilson-Pilcher was an advanced car, originally with a 2.4-litre engine, that had been made in London from 1901 until 1904 when production moved to Newcastle. When Armstrong Whitworth took over production two models were made, a 2.7-litre flat four and a 4.1-litre flat six, the cylinders on both being identical with bore and stroke of 3.75in (95mm). The engines had the flywheel at the front of the engine, and the crankshaft had intermediate bearings between each pair of cylinders. Drive was to the rear wheels via a dual helical epicyclic gears and helical bevel axle. The cars were listed at £735 for the four and £900 for the six. They were still theoretically available until 1907. According to &quot;Automotor&quot; in 1904, &quot;Even the first Wilson-Pilcher car that made its appearance created quite a sensation in automobile circles at the time on account of its remarkably silent and smooth running, and of the almost total absence of vibration&quot;.

The first Armstrong Whitworth car was the &quot;28/36&quot; of 1906 with a water-cooled, four-cylinder side-valve engine of 4.5 litres which unusually had &quot;oversquare&quot; dimensions of bore and stroke. Drive was via a four-speed gearbox and shaft to the rear wheels. A larger car was listed for 1908 with a choice of either 5-litre &quot;30&quot; or 7.6-litre &quot;40&quot; models sharing a bore but with strokes of and respectively. The &quot;40&quot; was listed at £798 in bare chassis form for supplying to coachbuilders. These large cars were joined in 1909 by the 4.3-litre &quot;18/22&quot; and in 1910 by the 3.7-litre &quot;25&quot;, which seems to have shared the same chassis as the &quot;30&quot; and &quot;40&quot;.

In 1911, a new small car appeared in the shape of the 2.4-litre &quot;12/14&quot;, called the &quot;15.9&quot; in 1911, featuring a monobloc engine with pressure lubrication to the crankshaft bearings. This model had an wheelbase compared with the of the &quot;40&quot; range. This was joined by four larger cars ranging from the 2.7-litre &quot;15/20&quot; to the 3.7-litre &quot;25.5&quot;.

The first six-cylinder model, the &quot;30/50&quot; with 5.1-litre bore by stroke engine came in 1912 with the option of electric lighting. This grew to 5.7 litres in 1913.

At the outbreak of war, as well as the 30/50, the range consisted of the 3-litre &quot;17/25&quot; and the 3.8-litre &quot;20/30&quot;.

The cars were usually if not always bodied by external coachbuilders and had a reputation for reliability and solid workmanship. The company maintained a London sales outlet at New Bond Street. When Armstrong Whitworth and Vickers merged, Armstrong Whitworth&#x27;s automotive interests were purchased by J D Siddeley as Armstrong Siddeley, based in Coventry.

An Armstrong Whitworth car is displayed in the Discovery Museum, Newcastle upon Tyne.

=== Aircraft ===
Armstrong Whitworth established an Aerial Department in 1912. This later became the Sir W. G. Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft Company. When Vickers and Armstrong Whitworth merged in 1927 to form Vickers-Armstrongs, Armstrong Whitworth Aircraft was bought out by J. D. Siddeley and became a separate entity.

=== Armaments ===

The Elswick Ordnance Company (sometimes referred to as Elswick Ordnance Works, but usually as &quot;EOC&quot;) was originally created in 1859 to separate William Armstrong&#x27;s armaments business from his other business interests, to avoid a conflict of interest as Armstrong was then Engineer of Rifled Ordnance for the War Office and the company&#x27;s main customer was the British Government. Armstrong held no financial interest in the company until 1864 when he left Government service, and Elswick Ordnance was reunited with the main Armstrong businesses to form Sir W.G. Armstrong &amp; Company. EOC was then the armaments branch of W.G. Armstrong &amp; Company and later of Armstrong Whitworth.

Elswick Ordnance was a major arms developer before and during World War I. The ordnance and ammunition it manufactured for the British Government were stamped EOC, while guns made for export were usually marked &quot;W.G. Armstrong&quot;. The 28 cm howitzer L/10 which played a major role in the Siege of Port Arthur in the Russo-Japanese War was developed by Armstrong.

===Locomotives===
After the Great War, Armstrong Whitworth converted its Scotswood Works to build railway locomotives. From 1919 it rapidly penetrated the locomotive market due to its modern plant. Its two largest contracts were 200 2-8-0s for the Belgian State Railways in 1920 and 327 Black 5 4-6-0s for the LMS in 1935/36.

AW also modified locomotives. In 1926 Palestine Railways sent six of its H class Baldwin 4-6-0 locomotives to AW for conversion into 4-6-2 tank locomotives to work the PR&#x27;s steeply graded branch between Jaffa and Jerusalem. PR also sent another six H Class Baldwins for their defective steel fireboxes to be replaced with copper ones.

AW&#x27;s well-equipped works included its own design department and enabled it to build large locomotives, including an order for 30 engines of three types for the modernisation of the South Australian Railways in 1926. These included ten 500 class 4-8-2 locomotives, which were the largest non-articulated locomotives built in Great Britain, and were based on Alco drawings modified by AW and SAR engineers. They were a sensation in Australia. AW went on to build 20 large three-cylinder &quot;Pacific&quot; type locomotives for the Central Argentine Railway (F.C.C.A) in 1930, with Caprotti valve gear and modern boilers. They were the most powerful locomotives on the F.C.C.A.

AW obtained the UK license for Sulzer diesels from 1919, and by the 1930s was building diesel locomotives and railcars. An early example is the Tanfield Railway&#x27;s 0-4-0 diesel-electric shed pilot, No.2, which was built by AW as works number D22 in 1933. In the same year, the company launched the UK&#x27;s first mainline diesel locomotive, the 800 bhp &quot;Universal&quot;. It was successful in trials, but not repaired after an engine crankcase explosion a year later. A total of 1,464 locomotives were built at Scotswood Works before it was converted back to armaments manufacture in 1937.

===Overseas operations===
After the end of WWI demand for armaments and naval ships all but evaporated, and Armstrong Whitworth had to look into diversifying its business.

The company built a hydroelectric station at Nymboida, New South Wales, near Grafton, Australia in 1923–1924. This is still in use and is substantially original. In 1925 the company tendered unsuccessfully to construct the South Brisbane-Richmond Gap (on the New-South Wales-Queensland border) section of the last stage of the standard gauge railway linking Sydney and Brisbane. This was a heavily engineered railway which includes a long tunnel under the Richmond Range forming the state border and a spiral just south of the border. AW&#x27;s tender price was £1,333,940 compared with Queensland Railway&#x27;s tender price of £1,130,142. In the mid-1920s the company clearly was trying to break into the booming Australian market, but was stymied by a preference for local companies.

The Dominion of Newfoundland, an island country then mostly dependent on its fishery, had plenty of pulpwood but only one paper mill at Grand Falls-Windsor and one pulp mill at Bishop&#x27;s Falls, both built in the 1900s. The owners of the Reid Newfoundland Company convinced AW to invest in building a second paper mill at Corner Brook, to be supplied with hydroelectricity from a generating station 50 km away at Deer Lake. A joint venture, the Newfoundland Power and Paper Company, was founded in 1923. After much fighting between Harry Reid and then-PM of the dominion Richard Squires, the so-called Humber project (after the Humber River) received support from the local government and loan guarantees both from it and the UK; Squires even campaigned on it, making &quot;Hum on the Humber&quot; his slogan for the 1923 Newfoundland general election.

The company was heavily involved with the establishment of the town of Deer Lake. The hydroelectric station there was built between 1922 and 1925, while the canal system used by the hydroelectric station helped to expand the forestry operations in the area. Some of the equipment used in the construction of the Panama Canal was shipped to Newfoundland. The pulp and paper mill in Corner Brook began operations in 1925. Overall, AW spent about £5M (equivalent to £ million in ) on the development, which went significantly over the original budget and led to an overdraft, only to witness a consistent decline in newsprint and pulp prices after 1923, which was caused by overexpansion of the Canadian industry and wasn&#x27;t predicted by either party of the project, both lacking experience in paper trade. Since on a falling paper market longtime players with established customer bases had a clear advantage, shareholders sold their well-working but overleveraged and loss-making business to International Paper &amp; Power Company in 1927. The deal left AW with a loss of £2.8M, and the whole group collapsed.

===Shipbuilding===

Shipbuilding was the major division of the company. From 1879 to 1880 the predecessor shipbuilding company of Charles Mitchell laid down a cruiser for the Chilean Navy at Low Walker Yard. This vessel was later supplied to Japan as the &#x27;Tsukushi&#x27; of 1883; the ship was launched as of Armstrong Mitchell build. Between 1885 and 1918 Armstrong built warships for the Royal Navy, Beiyang Fleet, Imperial Russian Navy, Brazil Navy Imperial Japanese Navy, and the United States Navy. Amongst these were HMS &quot;Glatton&quot; which, due to bodged construction, suffered a magazine explosion in Dover Harbour less than one month after commissioning.

Armstrong Mitchell and later Armstrong Whitworth built many merchant ships, freighters, tank-ships, and dredgers; notable among them was the ice-breaking train ferries in 1897 and in 1900, built to connect the Trans-Siberian Railway across Lake Baikal. The company built the first polar icebreaker in the world: &quot;Yermak&quot; was a Russian and later Soviet icebreaker, having a strengthened hull shaped to ride over and crush pack ice.

==Mergers and demergers==
In 1927, the defence and engineering businesses merged with those of Vickers Limited to create a subsidiary company known as Vickers-Armstrongs. The aircraft and Armstrong Siddeley motors business were bought by J. D. Siddeley and became a separate entity. Production at the Scotswood Works ended in 1979 and the buildings were demolished in 1982.
==Products==
===Hydraulic engineering installations===
The forerunner companies, W. G. Armstrong &amp; Co. and later, from 1883 &quot;Sir WG Armstrong Mitchell &amp; Company&quot;, were heavily involved in the construction of hydraulic engineering installations. Notable examples include:
* Development of the Hydraulic &#x27;Jigger&#x27;, and lifting apparatus, some exhibited at the 1851 Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace, London.
* Hydraulic mains system, Limehouse Basin, London, 1850s
* Swing Bridge, River Tyne, 1873

* A series of nine late-19th century 160-ton capacity hydraulic cranes for naval use. These were erected worldwide, in India (Bombay), Italy (La Spezia, Pozzuoli, Taranto and Venice), Liverpool, Malta and two more in Japan. The sole surviving example is undergoing partial restoration at Venice&#x27;s Arsenale.

===Locomotives===
Armstrong Whitworth built a few railway locomotives between 1847 and 1868, but it was not until 1919 that the company made a concerted effort to enter the railway market.

Contracts were obtained for the construction and supply of steam and diesel locomotives to railway systems in Britain and overseas, including those detailed in the following table.

==Armament==

Cannons and other armament were produced by the Elswick Ordnance Company, the armament division of Armstrong Whitworth. An especially notable example is the Armstrong 100-ton gun.

<doc id="857716" wikidata="Q744584" url="?curid=857716" title="Your Funeral... My Trial">
<text>Your Funeral... My Trial is the fourth studio album by the Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on 3 November 1986 by Mute Records. The album was originally released as a double extended play (EP), while also issued on CD with a different running order and the additional track &quot;Scum&quot;. During this period in his life, Cave was steeped in heroin addiction, perhaps evidenced by the melancholy, desperate mood of this album. 
This was the final Bad Seeds album to feature Barry Adamson until he returned for &quot;Push the Sky Away&quot; (2013).

Cave later said, &quot;That particular record, which is my favourite of the records we&#x27;ve done, is very special to me and a lot of amazing things happened, musically, in the studio. There are some songs on that record that as far as I&#x27;m concerned are just about perfect as we can get really- songs like &quot;The Carny&quot;, &quot;Your Funeral, My Trial&quot;, and &quot;Stranger Than Kindness&quot;, I think are really quite brilliant.&quot; &quot;Your Funeral... My Trial&quot; was the band&#x27;s first album to reach the ARIA Top 100 Albums Chart, where it peaked at number 98, and also reached number one on the UK Independent Albums Chart.

The album was remastered and reissued on 27 April 2009 as a collector&#x27;s edition CD/DVD set. The CD features the original 8-song vinyl double EP&#x27;s track listing and track order, while &quot;Scum&quot; is featured as a bonus audio track on the accompanying DVD.

== Recording ==
Producer Flood said, &quot;I remember Mick Harvey arrived in the studio with the guts of an old grand piano, that was the basis of the sound. It was just the strings, attached to a metal frame. He tuned certain notes, and used a guitar plectrum to pick the notes. It then ended up as &quot;The Carny&quot;. That was the first day of recording &quot;Your Funeral… My Trial&quot;, and that kind of set the tone for the whole record.&quot;

Reflecting on the album in 2020, guitarist Mick Harvey noted: &quot;[The album] gave us the template to go forward with. It was organised rather than rambling. It all felt complete even though it was a disparate set of sounds and styles. It felt like it belonged to us. It sounded like The Bad Seeds.&quot;

== Movies ==
Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds appeared in the Wim Wenders film &quot;Der Himmel über Berlin&quot; (1987), performing &quot;The Carny&quot; (which is heard once before the performance scene) and &quot;From Her to Eternity&quot;. &quot;The Carny&quot; also inspired the animated twelve-minute film &quot;Jo Jo in the Stars&quot; (2003), which won the BAFTA Award for Best Animated Short Film. The film was created and directed by Marc Craste, who said about &quot;The Carny&quot;: &quot;The lyrics read like a short story, it seemed to suggest a film – a straight visual interpretation of the text ...&quot;

<doc id="857719" wikidata="Q643790" url="?curid=857719" title="Anostomidae">
<text>The Anostomidae are a family of ray-finned fishes that belong to the order Characiformes. Closely related to the Chilodontidae and formerly included with them, the Anostomidae contain about 150 described species. Commonly known as anostomids, they are found in freshwater habitats from the Río Atrato in northernmost South America to warm-temperate central Argentina; they are of Amazon origin, with few found west of the Andes (mainly in Colombia and Venezuela). Their scientific name approximately means &quot;mouth on top&quot;, from Ancient Greek &quot;áno-&quot; (ἄνω) &quot;up&quot; (as an adverb) + &quot;stóma&quot; (στόμᾶ) &quot;mouth&quot;, in reference to the arrangement of these fishes&#x27; mouth opening.

==Description==
Anostomids have elongated bodies ranging from in length; their shape varies between and deeper-bodied, but even the latter are only moderately laterally. They have elongated, tapering heads with rather long, straight snouts, and small apical to upturned mouths immediately at or near the snout tip. This family contains many headstanders, which habitually swim with their heads pointing from 45° up to 90° downwards; most feed on plants near the bottom, while others also eat detritus and invertebrates picked up from river- or lakebeds. Adults guard the eggs after spawning. Anostomidae are generally considered edible, and some of the larger species are caught for food on a regular basis, much like large Leuciscinae (which are superficially similar Cypriniformes) are in the temperate Northern Hemisphere.

Their jaws are rather short, with the maxillary bone small and excluded from the mouth opening, while the ascending process of the premaxilla is triangular in overall shape and robustly developed. One row of six or eight curved teeth occur in each jaw, arranged by length in a step-like fashion, with the front teeth being the longest; the pharyngeal teeth are enlarged and have two or more cusps each.

Anostomid gill openings are small, with the gill membranes firmly joined to the isthmus; the ligament between the interopercle and the mouth is elongated and the interopercle is clearly separated from the retroarticular. On the sides of the preopercle is a large, elongated protrusion, where the powerful jaw adductor muscles attach. The third epibranchial gill arch has a curved anterior process which extends medially over the dorsal surface of the fourth infrapharyngobranchial arch. The circumorbital bone series is complete and includes a supraorbital bone, and at least four, often more, of the forward ribs are united by two or more intercostal ligaments.

The lateral line is complete, contains 33-44 perforated scales, and runs along the midline of the body. The dentary bears a short lateral-line canal ending at or shortly behind mid-length, and altogether the lateral-line canals of the head are divided into at least two ossified tubes. All anostomids have an adipose fin; their dorsal fin contains one and 11, the anal fin one and 9, and the pelvic fins one and 8-9 hard and soft rays, respectively.

==Systematics and evolution==

This family is in all probability monotypic as traditionally defined. Several attempts to delimit subfamilies have taken place, and several of the proposed groupings indeed correspond to clades within this family. &quot;Leporellus&quot; has long been recognized as the basal-most living anostomid genus, due to its many plesiomorphies shared with the Chilodontidae and its peculiar apomorphies, and separated as a monotypic subfamily by some. A large clade of &quot;modern&quot; genera was treated as Anostominae by some authors; others considered that subfamily more inclusive.

But the latter view is incorrect, as it includes a large number of lineages that are really basal members of the family and should not be treated as a subfamily (except monotypic ones, but these are generally avoided). Also, the huge assemblage usually treated under &quot;Leporinus&quot; is not monophyletic and in need of thorough study, to see how it is best divided. Depending on the exact relationships of &quot;Anostomoides&quot;, a &quot;Leporinus sensu lato&quot; clade could warrant recognition as another subfamily. Finally, &quot;Rhytiodus&quot; and &quot;Schizodon&quot; would almost certainly qualify as another subfamily, even if only the Anostominae warrant recognition otherwise.

===Evolution and fossil record===
The taxon Anostominae is also used to denote the entire family in outdated treatments, where the name &quot;Anostomidae&quot; is applied to the entire Anostomoidea (and sometimes even more distant relatives). In that respect, agreement is widespread today that the closest living relatives of the Anostomidae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; are the Chilodontidae headstanders, the toothless characins (Curimatidae) and the flannel-mouthed characins (Prochilodontidae).

The origin of the Anostomidae can be quite confidently placed in the Paleogene, and somewhat less securely in late Paleogene, based on various evidence. For one, the biogeography of the family, with some very basal taxa found west of the Andes, indicates it was already well distinct when the northern part of that mountain range uplifted at the end of the Middle Miocene about 12 million years ago (Mya). Then, some scant but highly informative fossil evidence assigned to this family: a premaxillary tooth was found in the Colombian Villavieja Formation and dated to the Laventan age about 13.5-11.5 Mya, while some pharyngeal teeth and other jaw parts found near Cuenca, Ecuador in the Cuenca basin (a structural basin) are about 19 million years old. The fossil remains resemble &quot;Leporinus&quot; and were assigned to the living genus, but given its paraphyly and rather basal position, until more fossils are found the known remains can only be considered fairly basal Anostomidae, &quot;incertae sedis&quot;, but probably close to the &quot;Leporinus&quot; assemblage.&quot;Cyphocharax mosesi&quot;, a fossil toothless characin found in Brazil, lived at the Oligocene-Miocene boundary about 23 Mya. Thus, at that time, the Anostomoidea families must have already been well distinct. Given that the Characiformes originated slightly more than 115 Mya, the Anostomoidea probably diverged from their characiform relatives the Late Cretaceous and diversified thereafter; a Paleogene origin of the Anostomidae is thus most likely, with present-day subfamilies (whatever eventually will be accepted) having diverged by the start of the Neogene. Whether the family originated in Oligocene or already in the Eocene (or perhaps even in the Paleocene) cannot be said until more fossil material is recovered, either to answer this question directly or to provide calibration for molecular phylogenetic studies.
===Genera===
The genera of Anostomidae are:

Basal lineages
* &quot;Abramites&quot; (two species)
* &quot;Anostomoides&quot; (three species)
* &quot;Hypomasticus&quot; (seven species)
* &quot;Leporellus&quot; (four species)
* &quot;Leporinus&quot; (79 species; paraphyletic)
* &quot;Megaleporinus&quot; (10 species)

&quot;Schizodon&quot; clade
* &quot;Rhytiodus&quot; (four species)
* &quot;Schizodon&quot; (16 species)

Anostominae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;
* &quot;Anostomus&quot; (five species)
* &quot;Gnathodolus&quot; (one species)
* &quot;Laemolyta&quot; (9 species)
* &quot;Petulanos&quot; (three species)
* &quot;Pseudanos&quot; (four species; paraphyletic?)
* &quot;Sartor&quot; (three species)
* &quot;Synaptolaemus&quot; (two species)

In Brazil, many species of &quot;Leporinus&quot;, &quot;Rhytiodus&quot;, and &quot;Schizodon&quot; are called aracu.

<text>The Arnold was one of the first motor cars manufactured in the United Kingdom. It was produced in East Peckham, Kent between 1896 and 1898.

==History==
William Arnold &amp; Sons of East Peckham, Kent, was an agricultural engineering company founded in about 1844.

In 1895 they acquired a licence to build Benz cars. As the Arnold Motor Carriage Co. from 1896 to 1898. the firm built twelve cars patterned after the Benz but fitted with their own engines. Two Arnolds were exhibited at Crystal Palace in 1896.

Louise Bazalgette and William Arnold&#x27;s partner, Henry Hewetson, were photographed at the historic &quot;emancipation run&quot; which is the race still celebrated by the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run. This was the first time that cars were allowed to do 14 mph and it was the first meeting of the Automobile Club (for male drivers). Bazalgette was driving an Arnold motor car.

One Arnold from 1896 was fitted with one of the world&#x27;s first self-starters, by electrical engineer Herbert John Dowsing. This was a dynamotor coupled to the flywheel, designed to assist the car on hills and well as starting the engine.

Two Arnold cars survive.

On 28 January 1896 Walter Arnold, of the Arnold (automobile) company of East Peckham, was summonsed for travelling at in a motorised vehicle, thereby exceeding the contemporary speed limit for towns of . He had been caught by a policeman who had given chase on a bicycle. He was fined 1 shilling plus costs, the first speeding fine in England, and thus became the first person to be convicted of speeding in the UK.

In 1902 there was a Chilean car, probably inspired in this one, but that was named Ovalle-Hogdkinson &quot;La Chancha&quot; (&quot;The Pig&quot; because of the sound it did), that was revealed in April 1902, but stored in May of the same year and later dismantled. All components, except for Michelin-imposed tires, were produced by the same Ovalle-Hogdkinson brand

<text>Beaver Lake Park is a 54-acre (220,000 m2) park located on the southwest corner of Beaver Lake in the city of Sammamish, Washington. It offers public access to the lake, fishing areas, a picnic shelter, a baseball field, an off leash dog park, trails, play structures, barbecue grills, and the necessities. (e.g.bathrooms, parking, etc.)

The park is also home to a pavilion and the Lodge at Beaver Lake, which has traditional Native American totem poles and story poles carved by Tsimshian artist David A. Boxley, and hosts weddings, receptions, and dinners.

In October, the park is host to the annual &quot;Nightmare at Beaver Lake,&quot; a huge and elaborate haunted house-type attraction, which benefits charitable projects sponsored by the local Sammamish Rotary which is part of Rotary International Rotary Club.

The park has also hosted the Annual Beaver Lake Triathlon since 1994.

The park used to be owned and maintained by King County, but the park was transferred, effective January 1, 2003, to the City of Sammamish due to county budget shortfalls caused by state tax revolt.

<doc id="857740" wikidata="Q570675" url="?curid=857740" title="The Good Son (album)">
<text>The Good Son is the sixth studio album by the Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on 17 April 1990 by Mute Records.

After two dark and harrowing studio albums with &quot;Your Funeral... My Trial&quot; (1986) and &quot;Tender Prey&quot; (1988), &quot;The Good Son&quot; was a substantial departure with a lighter and generally more uplifting sound. The change of mood was greatly inspired by lead vocalist Nick Cave falling in love with Brazilian journalist Viviane Carneiro, and an apparently salutary spell in rehab which purged much of the despair and squalor reflected in the previous two studio albums. Cave later said, &quot;I guess &quot;The Good Son&quot; is some kind of reflection of the way I felt early on in Brazil. I was quite happy there. I was in love and the first year or two was good. The problem I found was ... in order to survive you have to adopt their attitudes towards everything, which are kind of blinkered.&quot;

== Singles and release history ==
&quot;The Good Son&quot; was preceded by the release of &quot;The Ship Song&quot; single. A different version of &quot;The Weeping Song&quot; was later released as a single, with a different mix from the album version.

The closing track &quot;Lucy&quot; was resurrected in 1993 as a B-side of &quot;What a Wonderful World&quot;, a collaboration of the Bad Seeds and the Pogues&#x27; Shane MacGowan.

The album was remastered and reissued on 29 March 2010 as a collector&#x27;s edition CD/DVD set.

== Track listing ==
== Song details ==
&quot;Foi Na Cruz&quot; is based partly upon the traditional Brazilian Protestant hymn of the same title. The title translates roughly as &quot;It Happened on the Cross&quot;.

&quot;The Good Son&quot; – the opening chant is based loosely upon the African American traditional song &quot;Another Man Done Gone&quot;. A recording of this traditional song, by the American folk singer Odetta, later appeared on &quot;Original Seeds&quot; Vol. 1 (1998), a compilation of material that influenced Cave. The Biblical story of Cain and Abel is an obvious influence on the song, which describes a &quot;a tiller and he has a tiller&#x27;s hand&quot; like Cain, a farmer who feuds with and kills his brother.

&quot;The Witness Song&quot; is based loosely upon the traditional American gospel song &quot;Who Will be a Witness?&quot;.

Four of the songs on the album were left with their working titles (&quot;The Ship Song&quot;, &quot;The Weeping Song&quot;, &quot;The Hammer Song&quot;, &quot;The Witness Song&quot;).

The instrumental B-side &quot;Cocks &#x27;n&#x27; Asses&quot; was retitled &quot;The B-side Song&quot; for the USA release.

<text>The Koolie (also known as the Australian Koolie or by the historic misnomer &quot;German Coolie&quot;) is an Australian dog breed. The Koolie is a working or herding dog which has existed in Australia since the early 19th century when it was bred from imported British working dogs. Robert Kaleski, in an article on Cattle Dogs in the August 1903 issue of the Agricultural Gazette of New South Wales, describes the &quot;Welsh heeler or merle, erroneously known as the German collie,&quot; as a &quot;blue-gray dog about the size and build of a smooth-haired collie, generally with wall eyes.&quot; The British background predominated in the dogs that came to be associated with the &quot;German collie&quot; name.

There is substantial variation in the Koolie population, as Koolies were bred to exhibit different characteristics in different regions. The breed is based on its ability to work rather than on its conformation. However, most Koolie breeders refer to the Koolie as a breed rather than as a type, and assert that it &quot;breeds true&quot;, with various types or strains.

The Koolie is a &quot;herding dog&quot;, one which has a natural instinct to circle widely round sheep and bring them back to their owner. Koolies are known as silent, upright, working dogs. They are used for herding sheep and also for quiet careful work at close quarters at lambing time or for &quot;shedding&quot; (cutting out) sheep.

With the demand for farming dogs no longer being what it was, the Koolie has proven its worth in many other fields where it is renowned for its sensitivity, athleticism and obedience, excelling in agility, tracking, therapy, disability &amp; emotional support service, and as the ultimate outdoor &amp; family companion, providing they are well trained.

==Description==

===Appearance===
The Koolie is as diverse as the country it originates from, Australia. In the north of Queensland and New South Wales they are tall, medium boned and agile, bred for mustering cattle over many miles. In New South Wales, they are thicker set and shorter to flush low lying cattle from the dense bush and gullies. In Victoria, one finds the smallest variety of the Koolie, primarily used for sheep. Koolies are bred to meet the needs of the stockman, grazier and farmer; all agile, all with the same ability to adapt to any situation, all with a strong willingness drive. Male Koolies stand between 17 and 20 inches (43 to 51 cm) tall at the shoulder, while females typically measure slightly smaller, ranging from 16 to 19 inches (41 to 48 cm). Most often, they are seen in the merle coat pattern, but can exhibit any combination of colour and coat lengths. The solid red or black Koolie are often mistaken for Kelpies, and some bi-coloured Koolie have been taken for Border Collies by the general public. As all of these breeds share Collie ancestry, they resemble each other. Their ears are loose and rectangular, but when the dog concentrates, they will stand erect. The Koolie coat comes in a number of variants, short and smooth like the original Scottish blue merle Collies, long like the Border Collie, short like the working Kelpie,  and medium in size like the German Tiger.

===Coat===

The Koolie coat ranges from short/smooth (like that of the original blue merle Collies from Scotland), short (like a working Kelpie), medium and, not common, long (like the show Border Collie). Koolies are typically slightly longer than tall. The majority of owners prefer the short/smooth coats as they do not pick up grass seed, and are very easy to maintain, with the occasional swim to keep the coat glossy and free of parasites.

===Colouring===
Koolie colours are classed as Solid or Merle.

A Solid does not show any Merle pattern, and can come in any colour such as all one colour black, red, chocolate, cream, dilute red (lilac), dilute black (blue), with tan points, black &amp; white, dilute &amp; white or red &amp; white, or &quot;Tri&quot; -solid red or black, with white markings, normally with brown points.

Any of these can then have the Merle pattern i.e. usually with large splashes of darker colourings of red/chocolate for red merles or black/grey for blue merles. Black Koolies will commonly have a black nose with black eyes, or tones of black including blue. Red or chocolate Koolies will commonly have a red or chocolate nose with brown eyes, or tones of brown, including yellow, and there can be combinations of both black or brown with the added blue eye/s.
There are also dilute colours of slate/blue for black Koolies and lilac/fawn for red Koolies.
Yellow/cream can also be displayed when the dog is homozygous recessive on the &quot;E locus.&quot; This recessive red (also known as Australian Red in some breeds) is considered a masking gene in that it prevents the production of black coat pigment (base skin pigment remains unaffected). Because of this, it is considered a masking gene that prevents the expression of the merle gene (and some others).

In 2019, many Koolie breeders took part in the research project to find a DNA test for the Merle gene, as it was believed many non Merle looking dogs could be genetically a Merle and therefore have issues when bred to a Merle.

The breeding of two Merle dogs runs a high risk (in all breeds) of sight and hearing defects in the offspring.

As a “solid” (dog not showing the Merle pattern) may still genetically be a Merle, it is vital to perform a full DNA Merle sequence test to determine the “lengths” of Merle in each dog so that the safest breeding practices are used.

===Temperament===

Graziers, stockmen and dairy farmers across Australia since days long past have typically selected breeds which display the abilities required to meet their working needs. The temperament found in a Koolie is a culmination of these much sought-after abilities. The optimal worker possesses a combination of working skills and bonding temperament.

There are times when an uninitiated dog owner or a new enthusiast mistakes the Koolie as a shy, reserved or even a timid animal. The Koolie&#x27;s temperament needs to be understood in proper context when one seeks an optimal match of skills and demeanour. Koolies are intelligent animals, and the most experienced handlers know well that they need guidance in training. A steady and supportive approach will be productive, proving the Koolie&#x27;s adaptability in diverse situations when given time.

Owners will be rewarded through the Koolie&#x27;s diligence in varied roles such as in work situations, sporting activities, loyal service or the time honoured role of companionship. Known to be patient, temperate, dedicated, with a strong sense of willingness and devotion. They show an untiring enthusiasm for work and an admirable hardiness when the job or circumstance requires.

Given their nature, it is paramount that pups are well trained for obedience and are given both mentally challenging goals as well as physical exercise.

==Health==

The median longevity of Koolies is about 15 years, which is a typical lifespan for this breed. Koolies have a diverse but small gene pool and can suffer from the many genetic problems found in recognised breeds. Many of these problems have genetic tests currently available, but hip and elbow scoring is necessary to reduce the incidence of Hip and Elbow Dysplasia. The merle for which the Koolie is most recognised by can produce blind and/or deaf white pups, if 2 merles are bred together, so merle testing should be performed prior to breeding.

The Australian Koolie Association is the only Koolie breed registry which has mandatory DNA breed ID testing before a dog of unverified breeding can be registered and also requires all stud dogs to be fully health screened by DNA &amp; hip and elbow dysplasia tested.

===Medical research===
*In 2003, DNA testing carried out on 56 individual Koolie bloodlines from Australia by Dr. Mark Neff of the University of California at Davis in the USA cleared those bloodlines tested for the presence of the mutant gene mdr1-1, which causes malfunction in the canine multidrug resistance gene; Collie bloodlines were chosen to be tested because they showed a reaction, even death, to chemicals, such as Ivermectin, used in the treatment of intestinal parasites.
*In 2004, the Koolie Club of Australia in conjunction with Genetic Science Service of Australia launched the collection and processing of Koolie DNA.
*There are several common genetic disorders that are found in the breed but which can be easily managed with safe breeding practices thanks to simple testing. 
*The Australian Koolie Association has distinct sections for both purebreds and part bred Koolies, whereas other registries do not make this distinction.

==Herding technique==

Koolies are much sought-after in rural Australia, and interest is now being shown in America, Canada, Germany, Finland, New Zealand, Switzerland and Holland. According to Geoff Broughton, past president of the Koolie Club of Australia for 7 years, the Koolie will &quot;head&quot; (move to the front or head of the stock to push them back towards you), &quot;heel&quot; or &quot;drive&quot;, (push the stock from behind), &quot;cast&quot; (move out and around the stock), &quot;block&quot; (hold the stock or block them from in front, in three sheep trials this action is called the pick up) and &quot;back&quot; (literally jump onto the backs of their charges to herd them if necessary). Koolies have a reputation for being upright workers with a good eye, who can easily shift their focus from holding the group to casting around a flock or gathering breakaways. They are not known for having &quot;sticky eyes&quot; (focusing on the sheep in front only). Unlike other working breeds, which are noted for their crouched form or style and preference for either yard or field work, Koolies are at ease working in closed surroundings such as yards or trucks and being out in paddocks and droving. As well as working anything from ducks to bulls, like all dogs of their kind they will herd family members and children in the absence of other charges.

Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at non-competitive herding tests. Koolies exhibiting basic herding instincts can be trained to compete in stock dog trials.

==History==

The Koolie&#x27;s ancestors were thought to be the smooth-coated blue merle Collie (imported from Britain in the 19th century) and the Black and Tan Collie from the Highlands of Scotland (black and tan collies are not a breed); but dogs imported by early German settlers are believed to be descended from the &quot;German Tiger&quot;, a European herding dog, however DNA evidence is yet to be found support this. DNA testing has found that the Australian Kelpie is the closest known relative.

During the industrial era some bloodlines were influenced by Kelpie and Border Collie, as explained by one grazier in Western Australia, &quot;You bred from the good workers which were around and Koolies were not always to be found, so you bred to the next best worker that was and this was either the Kelpie or Border depending on the region you lived and the stock you worked&quot;. Many be breeders still out cross both Kelpie and Border Collie lines, which are accepted practices with the Koolie breed registries.

In 2000, the Koolie Club of Australia was formed to preserve and promote the Koolie breed. Later the Working Koolie Association &amp; Australian Koolie Association were formed as well. None of these registries actively work towards bench standard recognition, feeling this would only be detrimental to the breeds working future. As of (2013), no bench standard exists.

In 2004, the Koolie breed was recognised by the Australian Sporting Registrar, judges from the Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) may judge Koolies in all ANKC sanctioned sporting trials. In the states of Victoria, New South Wales, and Queensland, registered Koolies may compete in, herding, obedience, tracking, jumping, gambles and dog agility events through registration on their State&#x27;s Sporting Register as members of the Koolie Club of Australia or the Australian Koolie Association 

In May 2006, the Stockdog Committee of the Australian Shepherd Club of America voted to accept the &quot;Koolie/German Coolie&quot; into their list of recognised and accepted herding breeds, admission was granted June 2006.

In 2006, the American Herding Breed Association accepted the Australian Koolie onto their list of recognised and accepted breeds.

<text>Beaver Lake is a 79-acre (0.3 km) lake completely within the city limits of Sammamish, Washington. The Beaver Lake watershed is 1,043 acres (4.2 km); the mean depth is 21 feet (6.4 m), and the maximum depth is 50 feet (15 m). Beaver Lake is actually a chain of one main and two smaller lakes, with the main lake getting the bulk of the recreation focus.

Beaver Lake is part of a chain of three lakes: Long Lake, Beaver Lake, and a third unnamed lake, East of Lake Sammamish. It is drained by Laughing Jacobs Creek, a tributary of Lake Sammamish.

There is public access via Beaver Lake Park, located at the southwest corner of the lake. Boaters are not allowed to use gasoline motors, but fishing is still a popular recreational activity on the lake. The boat launch site is not located within the Park, but rather via a WDFD water access site. The lake is also used for the swimming leg of the annual Beaver Lake Triathlon, which starts in the park.

==Ecology==
Beaver Lake has been historically a habitat for Beavers, from which it was named. Beaver Lake &quot;may soon need a name change&quot; because flooding of some homeowner&#x27;s docks, has prompted the Sammamish Parks and Recreation Department to obtain an emergency permit from the Washington Department of Ecology to relocate a family of beavers (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) that built a dam on Laughing Jacobs Creek, raising the lake&#x27;s level. Beaver have been shown to increase salmon and trout abundance and size in several ways: their ponds recharge water tables which replenish stream flows in the dry season, provide critical habitat for young salmonids, and remove sediment loads from streams. Contrary to popular myth, most beaver dams do not pose barriers to trout and salmon migration, although they may be restricted seasonally during periods of low stream flows. Insect, invertebrate, fish, mammal, and bird diversity are also expanded. Water levels behind beaver dams can be controlled easily with flow devices such as a Beaver Deceiver. In fact, a 2006 survey found that trapping as a solution to beaver problems had a 79% failure rate within two years due to re-settlement by new beavers.

==Fishing==
Beaver Lake is heavily fished by locals. Many trout are caught from shore, but it is best for any species with a boat. Trout are found mostly in the main and larger sister lake. Bass are caught consistently in Beaver&#x27;s many lily pads and fallen timber areas, and are abundant in the smaller, shallower sister lake. Perch are found all over, and dropping a worm under a dock produces many of them.

<doc id="857744" wikidata="Q4986327" url="?curid=857744" title="Buhriz">
<text>Buhriz () is an Iraqi town of about 35,400 located 25 miles (40 km) north of Baghdad and 6 miles (9.5 km) south of the major city of Baqubah.

==Background==
The town of Buhriz is heavily agricultural, located on fertile land along the Diyala River and engaged in the cultivation of date palms, orange trees, and other crops.

The town has a beautiful old bazar that lies near the small river of Sariah (Khuraisan), it sells all kind of local fruit &amp; vegetables. Close to the bazar are two of the oldest mosques in Diyala province, The Big Mosque and Abu Al Gaith Mosque. Not far from it are 3 very nice local tea bars. or as locals call it (Gahwa), where usually people sit and have a nice cup of tea and chit chat about their days, and also it&#x27;s a place to gather and watch matches of football.

It maintains a rural character despite its proximity to Baqubah and Baghdad, with many residents living in traditional mud huts with some concrete-block houses. The town was known under the regime of Saddam Hussein as the home of many members of the Ba&#x27;ath Party, as well as being particularly conservative with traditional religious and tribal values predominate. Following the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003, Buhriz emerged as a flashpoint for guerrilla fighters opposed to the Coalition troops and their Iraqi allies. It became the scene of repeated battles between U.S. forces and rebels throughout the spring and summer of 2004, essentially falling under guerrilla control. Local leaders blame the detention of over 200 Buhriz residents as provoking further hostility.

Yet in a shocking change of events in April 2007 and after the town was taken by al-Qaeda, the locals of the town had an agreement with the U.S. force in the area; it simply stated that they&#x27;re going to help Americans kill and capture all of those who are associated with Al-Qaeda, in exchange U.S. forces will help them return safely to their homes that were taken by Al-Qaeda; this was the beginning of a great change in the balance of forces that led eventually to the full control over Diyala province by U.S. and Iraqi forces.

==History==
Buhriz may be the site of the medieval city of Bajisra. Its modern name is probably in honor of Mujahid ad-Din Buhriz, the engineer who in made the last serious effort to repair and re-open the nearby Nahrawan Canal in 1140.

<text>Mohand Muhammed Fayiz al-Shehri (, or Alshehri; May 7, 1979September 11, 2001) was a Saudi terrorist who was a member of al-Qaeda. He was one of five al-Qaeda members who hijacked United Airlines Flight 175 and crashed it into the World Trade Center in New York City as part of the September 11 attacks (9/11). 

In early 2000, after dropping out of college in Saudi Arabia, al-Shehri left the country to fight in Chechnya amidst the Second Chechen War. He probably visited al-Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan. After joining al-Qaeda, he was chosen to participate in a series of coordinated terrorist attacks against the United States, which involved 19 men hijacking four American commercial flights to crash them into various targets. In October 2000, al-Shehri obtained a travel visa to be able to enter the U.S., and arrived in the country in May 2001. 

On September 11, 2001, al-Shehri and a team led by Marwan al-Shehhi took control of Flight 175, scheduled to fly from Boston to Los Angeles, and flew it into the South Tower of the World Trade Center complex. The impact caused the tower to collapse, killing hundreds. al-Shehri is not related to Wail al-Shehri or Waleed al-Shehri, hijackers of American Airlines Flight 11 on 9/11.

== History ==
Born 1979, al-Shehri was one of five hijackers to come from the Asir province of Saudi Arabia, the others being Ahmed al-Nami, Abdulaziz al-Omari and Waleed and Wail al-Shehri, two brothers with whom he shared the same tribe, Bani Shehr, although they were not related to him.

According to &quot;Arab News&quot;, Mohand al-Shehri went to fight in Chechnya in early 2000, where he may have met Hamza al-Ghamdi. On October 23, al-Shehri applied for a US B-1/B-2 visa in Jeddah. Other than an error on his school&#x27;s address the application was not suspicious and he was not interviewed before being granted the visa.

Al-Ghamdi and al-Shehri flew together from Iran into Kuwait that October. Three months later the pair rented a post office box in Delray Beach, Florida, where someone with the same name signed up to use the public library&#x27;s computers. According to FBI director Robert Mueller and the 9/11 Commission, however, al-Shehri did not first enter the United States until a London or Dubai flight on May 28 with al-Ghamdi and Abdulaziz al-Omari.

He was one of nine hijackers to open a SunTrust bank account with a cash deposit around June 2001, and on July 2 gained a Florida State ID Card.

Al-Shehri occasionally trained on simulators at the FlightSafety Aviation School in Vero Beach, Florida together with Abdulaziz al-Omari and Saeed al-Ghamdi.

== Attacks ==

Fayez Banihammad purchased both his and al-Shehri&#x27;s one-way first class tickets for United Airlines Flight 175 online on August 27 or 29, charging the $4,464.50 to a Visa card from Mustafa al Hawsawi, listing their addresses both as a Mail Boxes Etc. in Delray Beach. This was not the same postal box used by Hamza and Ahmed al-Ghamdi, who purchased their tickets for the same flight a day later, with another Mailboxes Etc. postal box in Delray Beach, although both groups listed the same phone number.

On September 7, he flew from Fort Lauderdale to Newark, New Jersey with Hamza al-Ghamdi on $139.75 tickets purchased from the Mile High Travel agency in Lauderdale-by-the-Sea.

On September 10, 2001, he shared a room at the Milner Hotel in Boston, Massachusetts with three other terrorists: Fayez Banihammad, Marwan al-Shehhi, who would pilot Flight 175 into the South Tower of the World Trade Center, and Satam al-Suqami, a hijacker of Flight 11.

On September 11, al-Shehri boarded Flight 175 and sat in first class seat 2B, next to Banihammad in 2A. About a half an hour into the flight, the plane was hijacked. It is believed that Banihammad and al-Shehri forcibly entered the cockpit and murdered the pilots while the al-Ghamdi brothers forced the remaining crew and passengers towards the rear of the aircraft, allowing al-Shehhi to take control of the plane. At 9:03 a.m., around 20 minutes after the hijacking began, al-Shehhi flew the plane into the South Tower of the World Trade Center between floors 77 and 85, killing all on board and killing or trapping hundreds of people inside the building. 56 minutes after the crash, at 9:59 a.m., the South Tower collapsed, killing all who were trapped and many more on the ground.

<doc id="857756" wikidata="Q1035357" url="?curid=857756" title="Henry's Dream">
<text>Henry&#x27;s Dream is the seventh studio album by the Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on 27 April 1992 by Mute Records.

It was the first album to feature long-standing members Martyn P. Casey (bass guitar) and Conway Savage (piano, organ, backing vocals), both Australian. Savage also performs a duet with Cave in the chorus of &#x27;When I First Came to Town&#x27;. The album title is a reference to &quot;The Dream Songs&quot; (1969), a long poem by John Berryman.

== Production ==
Nick Cave himself was unhappy with the production by David Briggs. Briggs preferred a &quot;live-in-the-studio&quot; method he had used with Neil Young. This led to Cave and Mick Harvey re-mixing the album, and ultimately to the &quot;Live Seeds&quot; (1993) recordings, as Cave wanted the songs &quot;done justice&quot;. Cave later said, &quot;He was a fucking nightmare, that guy. I know he&#x27;s dead now and all, but, fuck, man. I put a lot of energy into the writing of that record, and then for each day to see it drift away… it was a horrible, horrible experience.&quot; Tony Cohen, who was engineer for the remix, said, &quot;Briggs pushed them to play better, take after take. The performance was everything. But when it came to the mix, Briggs left all the faders in one spot.&quot;

== Songs ==
The lyrics of &quot;Christina the Astonishing&quot; are based on the life of Christina Mirabilis, a 12th-century Christian holy woman, primarily known for her legendary resurrection during her funeral mass, and numerous other miracles attributed to her during her life.

&quot;When I First Came to Town&quot; is based partly on Karen Dalton&#x27;s recording of the traditional song &quot;Katie Cruel&quot;. Dalton&#x27;s version was later issued on &quot;Original Seeds&quot; Vol. 1.

Of &quot;Papa Won&#x27;t Leave You, Henry,&quot; Cave said in 2005, &quot;I like that song a lot. That was another one written in Brazil. It&#x27;s this sprawling, lyrical thing. We were playing that [in 2000] as a very slow ballad on a different chordal structure altogether, which then became &#x27;Darker with the Day&#x27; [from the 2001 studio album &quot;No More Shall We Part&quot;]. It had a different melody, but very slow and it made for a haunting thing. That song was composed over a long period of time and something that I would sing to my little son, Luke. It was kind of a nasty fucked-up lullaby.&quot;

Cave later claimed the album&#x27;s songs were heavily influenced by street beggars he saw in Brazil, where he lived for several years while married to journalist Viviane Carneiro. &quot;They&#x27;d get their acoustic guitars with one or two strings and bang away and make a racket that had no sense whatsoever. It was very violent and seemed to come straight out of the heart. Very unmusical.&quot;

== Release ==
&quot;Henry&#x27;s Dream&quot; was released on 29 April 1992 in the United Kingdom and on 12 May in the United States. The album was released on CD, 12&quot; vinyl and cassette. Although released on Mute Records, international distribution was handled by a number of associated labels. Indisc issued the album in Belgium, Liberation Records in Australia, Alfa Records in Japan, Virgin Records in France and Greece, and Elektra Records in the United States. Australian pressings were available in a box set including with a three-track promo cassette and initial French pressings came with a promo CD including &quot;Papa Won&#x27;t Leave You, Henry,&quot; &quot;Straight to You,&quot; &quot;Brother, My Cup Is Empty&quot; and &quot;Loom of the Land.&quot; Limited editions of other pressings came with an enclosed poster and T-shirt. A second pressing of the album was issued on 13 February 1996 throughout Europe and the United States. On 29 March 2010, &quot;Henry&#x27;s Dream&quot; was reissued as a collector&#x27;s edition CD/DVD set, including the remastered album, a 5.1 surround sound mix, bonus tracks, a short film about the album, the single&#x27;s music videos, and exclusive liner notes.

The album&#x27;s two singles—&quot;Straight to You&quot; and &quot;I Had a Dream, Joe&quot;—were released on 30 March and 31 August, respectively. The singles were a moderate commercial success. Both singles charted in Australia, at number 96 and 75, respectively, and &quot;Straight to You&quot; charted at number 68 in the UK Singles Chart and at number 7 in the Indie Chart in April 1992. &quot;I Had a Dream, Joe&quot; also reached number 10 in the Indie Chart upon its release.

=== Tour ===
Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds promoted the album with an initial tour across Europe, North America, Japan and Australia in 1992. The tour consisted of five legs and fifty-five concerts, and began in Norwich, England on 26 April 1992 and concluded in Brisbane, Australia on 12 December. In 1993, the band continued touring, adding a further two legs and twenty-three concerts in Australia, Europe and Israel, beginning on 24 January 1993 in Melbourne and concluding on 10 June in Düsseldorf, Germany. During the tour, the band performed at several music festivals, including Pukkelpop, the Reading Festival, Livid, Big Day Out and Via-Rock.

Selected recordings from the tour were featured on the band&#x27;s first live album, &quot;Live Seeds&quot; (1993). Video recordings from the band&#x27;s two shows in the Paradiso in Amsterdam on 2 and 3 June 1992 are featured on the live DVD &quot;Live at The Paradiso&quot;, released alongside the band&#x27;s tour documentary &quot;The Road to God Knows Where&quot; (1990) in 2006.

== Critical reception ==

Upon its release, &quot;Henry&#x27;s Dream&quot; received critical acclaim. David Browne of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; said that &quot;Henry&#x27;s Dream&quot; &quot;sets Cave&#x27;s deep, dolorous voice and scab-picking lyrics to windswept, tote-that-barge arrangements&quot; and &quot;may finally demonstrate what the fuss is all about&quot;. Holly George-Warren of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; praised the album as &quot;provocative – albeit harrowing – music&quot;. However, &quot;The Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau, in a negative assessment, wrote that &quot;if this is your idea of great writing, you may be ripe for his cult. Otherwise, forget it—the voice alone definitely won&#x27;t do the trick.&quot; In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Ned Raggett noted that the album &quot;showed the band in fierce and fine fettle once more&quot; and described Cave&#x27;s lyrics as &quot;a series of striking, compelling lyrics again exploring love, lust and death&quot;, adding that the songs &quot;showcase the Seeds&#x27; peerless abilities at fusing older styles with noisy aggression and tension&quot; and citing &quot;Loom of the Land&quot; as &quot;one of Cave&#x27;s best songs ever&quot;.

The remastered edition of &quot;Henry&#x27;s Dream&quot; was also well received. BBC Music reviewer Mike Diver referred to the album, and the remaster of &quot;Tender Prey&quot; (1988), as &quot;anything but poor albums&quot; and said that even without former member Roland Wolf &quot;the instrumentation loses little of its potency, and religious imagery remains prominent in Cave&#x27;s wordplay.&quot; Alexander Tudor of &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; called the album &quot;a masterclass in narrative songwriting&quot; and referred to its songs as &quot;favela-punk&quot;, adding that &quot;the album&#x27;s atmospheric centrepiece conveys the mystery of faith (and the weirdness of folk traditions), rather than just rattling out a pretty tune.&quot;

&quot;Henry&#x27;s Dream&quot; was included in a number of album-of-the-year lists, particularly in the United Kingdom. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; listed it as number 7 on their End of Year Critics List in 1992, &quot;NME&quot; ranked it at number 5 on its end of year list, and &quot;Vox&quot; listed it as number 14 in its Albums of 1992.

<text>Arrol-Johnston (later known as Arrol-Aster) was an early Scottish manufacturer of automobiles, which operated from 1895 to 1931 and produced the first automobile manufactured in Britain. The company also developed the world&#x27;s first &quot;off-road&quot; vehicle for the Egyptian government, and another designed to travel on ice and snow for Ernest Shackleton&#x27;s Nimrod Expedition to the South Pole.

==History==
George Johnston was by training a locomotive engineer from Neilson, Reid and Company Limited of Springburn, Glasgow. Johnston was commissioned by Glasgow Corporation Tramways in 1894 to build an experimental steam-powered tramcar to replace their fleet of horse-drawn trams. 

During a final test before a Corporation committee, it caught fire and work was abandoned. Johnston&#x27;s attention was then turned to a detailed examination of continental makes of motor cars and he came to the conclusion that he could design and make a better vehicle than any of them and, in particular, a better engine. The first British-built motor car was thus conceived and by the end of 1895 was ready for financial backing. In the autumn of that year Johnston was joined by Norman Osborne Fulton and T. Blackwood Murray. Fulton was Johnston&#x27;s cousin and was made responsible for manufacture and assembly, while Murray had electrical engineering experience, having been Works Manager with Mavor and Coulson, makers of mining machinery in Bridgeton. His first task was the development of electrical ignition in place of the incandescent platinum tubes of the Daimler engine.

George Johnston had an experimental vehicle on the roads in November 1895, and there was an account in the Scotsman of a 3 hour journey in it, reputed to be the first Auto-Car to be seen in Scotland. The driving of a horseless carriage in Glasgow resulted in a prosecution under the Locomotive Amendment Act of 1878, where George Johnston conducted his own defence arguing that the vehicle was registered as a carriage and did not fit the definition of locomotive in the act. While he lost his case and was given a nominal fine, there was growing pressure to amend the so called &#x27;red flag acts&#x27; that were holding back British motor vehicle development, and later that year the passing of the Locomotives on Highways Act 1896 allowed motor vehicles to travel at as much as 12mph.

===Mo-Car Syndicate===
In 1895 Johnston formed a joint venture with Sir William Arrol MP, an engineer of the Forth Bridge to form the Mo-Car Syndicate Limited, which was to produce his car. Sir William was Chairman and Johnston was Managing Director, and the Syndicate included a Mr. Archibald Coats with a Mr P M Coats of Paisley, and a Mr. John Millar also of Paisley, while Norman Fulton was Works Manager. Sir William&#x27;s main interest in the business was as the financial backer.

The first Arrol-Johnston car was a six-seater &quot;Dogcart&quot; (a vehicle with two transverse seats placed back to back), which went into production at a factory at Camlachie, in the East End of Glasgow.

The Dogcart was a wood-bodied vehicle powered by a 10 hp 2 cylinder opposed piston engine mounted beneath the floor, which was started by pulling on a rope. The vehicle boasted chain final drive and its high-wheeled, solid-tyred, horse-carriage type of body was retained well into the 1900s. The brakes were arranged in the form of shoes which could be pressed on the back of the solid rear tyres, and the suspension comprised full elliptic leaf springs at the front, and half-elliptics at the rear. Transmission and brake control levers were mounted close to the driver&#x27;s right hand.

The company&#x27;s Camlachie premises were destroyed by fire in 1901, and production was moved to Paisley.

In 1902 William Beardmore took the largest single shareholding in the company, creating a captive customer for his iron and steel components. He later became Chairman when A-J (as it was widely known) became a public company.

A-J was restructured financially in 1903. New finance, mainly from Beardmore, became available, Beardmore wishing to help the firm stave off bankruptcy, and there were important changes in staff, including the arrival of J.S. Napier as Chief Engineer. George Johnston left as a result of a disagreement and founded the All British Car Company, a venture that was to be short-lived. A-J became effectively a wholly owned subsidiary of William Beardmore and Company

===Arrol-Johnston Car Company Ltd.===

In 1905 the company&#x27;s name was changed to the Arrol-Johnston Car Company Ltd. They had a 4.5-acre well-equipped factory in Paisley, and it was said they made everything there for their vehicles excepting a few specialised items such as springs, tyres and lamps - they even made their own magnetos. In the same year, the company introduced a 3023cc &quot;12/15hp&quot; model of more modern appearance; this, however, still used an opposed-piston engine producing 12bhp at 800rpm and 15bhp at 1100rpm. There was also a three-cylinder version of the dogcart; this was an uncouth 16 hp with the centre cylinder being of greater bore than the outer two. A 1905 Dogcart with solid wooden disc wheels still survives in Khartoum, inside the Sudan national museum, where it was supplied as a searchlight tender for the Sirdar of Egypt.

Also announced at the 1905 Olympia show was the new &quot;24/30 hp&quot; vertical four of 4654cc; followed in 1907 by the &quot;38/45 hp&quot; of 8832 cc. 

In 1907 Arrol-Johnston were engaged to produce a car for the British South Polar Expedition, and it did make it to Antarctica, though it was of limited use except on hard ice, so it was restricted to the base camp areas. The car was an alcohol-fuelled air-cooled version of the 12-15hp model.

The &quot;12/15 hp&quot; twin survived in production until 1909. This was the year that T. C. Pullinger (formerly of Darracq, Sunbeam and Humber) joined Arrol-Johnston; he swept out the old range in favour of the new &quot;15·9 hp&quot; of 2835cc. That model featured a dashboard radiator and four-wheel brakes (the latter were dropped in 1911). For 1912 a 1794 cc 11·9 hp, a 3640 cc 20·9 hp and a 3618 cc 23·8 hp were introduced.
In 1913 Arrol Johnston bought land at Heathhall, just outside Dumfries, and commissioned an American firm to build a factory. This is said to be the first factory in Britain to use ferro-concrete (concrete reinforced with metal bars), and was designed by Albert Kahn, architect of the Ford factory at Highland Park, Michigan, where the Model T was produced. A-J contracted to build 50 electric cars for Anderson Electric, maker of the Detroit Electric, at the new plant but it is not certain how many were actually made. Several models of car including the six-cylinder 23/9 were built up to the outbreak of war.

The first post war Arrol-Johnston was the &quot;Victory&quot; model in 1919 designed by G. W. A. Brown which had an ohc 2651 cc 4-cylinder engine of 40 hp. They introduced the model to agents in March 1919 but the first production car was not delivered until August; it was sold to the Prince of Wales. The Victory sadly proved &quot;unsellable and unreliable&quot;, and broke down while on a Royal tour of the West of England, so that the publicity attending its debut was not of the kind it needed. It was soon replaced by a modernized version of the prewar &quot;15·9 hp&quot;; it was cheaper, but this was due to such cost-cutting measures as a black-painted radiator and fixed ignition. The &quot;15·9 hp&quot; was revived as an urgent replacement for the &quot;Victory&quot;. A more modern version, the 20 hp, was introduced alongside the 15.9 hp in 1922.

In 1921 the cheaper Galloway was launched as, in theory, a separate make, from the Tongland works near Kirkcudbright. The car was based on the Fiat 501 and started with the 10/20 with a 1460 cc side-valve engine, in 1925 growing to the 1669 cc &quot;12/20&quot; and &quot;12/30&quot;. Production moved to the main A-J factory in Heathhall in 1922. A short-lived &quot;14 hp&quot; appeared in 1924, only to be replaced the following year by a &quot;12·3 hp&quot; model. There also was a 4-cylinder 3290cc &quot;Empire&quot; model manufactured for the colonies.

===Arrol-Aster===
In 1927 Arrol-Johnston were merged with Aster of Wembley, London to form the combined marque of Arrol-Aster, with directors from both Arrol-Johnston and Aster. The 15.9 hp was retained as were the two current Asters. Both the latter were given Burt-McCollum single sleeve valve engines in the interests of silence, but the 21/60 hp Aster was also available in its original ohv form, renamed the Arrol-Aster. Another completely new Arrol-Aster was the 2.5-litre 6-cylinder 17/50 hp with sleeve valves. The 21/60 hp Arrol-Aster and the 15.9 hp Arrol-Johnston were dropped for 1929, and a straight-8 Arrol-Aster substituted. It had a 3.3-litre sleeve valve engine consisting of the 17/50 unit with two extra cylinders and was available in supercharged form. This was a fast car intended as a sports model, but unlike the French sleeve-valve designs it could not produce high outputs as revolutions were limited.

The company lasted for two years before the company went into receivership. Limited production and sales continued until 1931.

==Football==

Arrol-Johnston ran a works football team. In 1919 the football club was one of three clubs in Dumfries that merged to form Queen of the South F.C. The most notable players at Arrol-Johnston were Dave Halliday and Ian Dickson. Both then played for Queen of the South before going on to top score for their respective clubs in the top division in England. Halliday in particular had a highly successful goal-scoring career. He then became a trophy-winning manager.

<text>In the automotive industry, S.H. Arnolt Inc. of Chicago and Warsaw, Indiana, sold four different manufacturer&#x27;s cars with Bertone bodies during the period 1953 to 1968.

Stanley H. &quot;Wacky&quot; Arnolt was a Chicago industrialist, who began importing foreign cars in the 1950s to the United States. Though sold as American cars, the cars were true hybrids, with British mechanicals, Italian bodywork, and U.S. sales and distribution, as well as in some cases final assembly and body work. S.H. Arnolt Inc. was a licensed automobile manufacturer in the State of Illinois.

A fortuitous meeting with Bertone at the Turin Auto Show in 1952 resulted in four collaborative efforts between Arnolt and Bertone, involving running gear and engines from the British car manufacturers MG, Aston Martin, Bentley, and Bristol.

==Arnolt-MG==
The Arnolt-MG is a four-seater Bertone-bodied car based on the MG TD chassis and XPAG 54hp engine. The car was styled by Giovanni Bertone, his son Nuccio, and Giovanni Michelotti. Of a planned production of 200 cars, 103 have been documented as built between 1953 and 1954 (67 coupés and 36 convertibles). Out of this total, the whereabouts of 36 are unknown and three are known to have been scrapped.

The initial price was $3145. In 1954, MG informed Arnolt that it could no longer supply chassis and engines due to demand for its own complete cars (as well as the replacement of the TD by the TF), so Arnolt began looking for a larger-engined car.

==Arnolt-Aston==

An attempt to build a Bertone-bodied Aston Martin DB2/4 roadster and sell it as an Arnolt-Aston was stopped by Aston Martin after three cars were built. There were three Arnolt-Astons designed by Bertone&#x27;s fresh new designer - Franco Scaglione (chassis numbers LML50/502, LML 50/505 and LML 50/507). All looked very much like Scaglione&#x27;s subsequent Arnolt-Bristol, having sharply creased fender lines, and were open cars without hardtops. There were four additional Bertone Astons that were commissioned at Arnolt&#x27;s request and went through Arnolt&#x27;s hands. These four cars are sometimes mistakenly referred to as Arnolt-Astons, but are not. These were 3 roadsters and 1 coupé. All of the seven Arnolt-Astons still exist. One article refers to a possible eighth car, perhaps destroyed in the Chicago fire at Arnolt&#x27;s factory. The cars were fitted with Aston&#x27;s 125 hp, 2580 cc engine.

==Arnolt-Bentley==

Arnolt also had Bertone design and build a Bentley, which resembles a larger version of the Arnolt-MG Coupé because it was also penned by Giovanni Michelotti who was working for Bertone at the time. This car was commissioned for S.H. Arnolt as a personal car. Bertone built the body on a 1953 R Type Continental chassis. The car was fitted with monogrammed flasks and glasses, and a special cosmetics compartment for Mrs. Arnolt. The car was originally painted gold and fitted with tan hides.

==Arnolt-Bristol==

Arnolt then negotiated with Bristol Cars Ltd in the UK for the purchase of 200 of their 404-series chassis and the 1971 cc, six-cylinder 130 hp engines from the earlier 403 model. Arnolt needed to find a new chassis source to meet his obligation to Bertone, in whom he had invested heavily, after MG proved unable to fill the original order for 200 cars. The chassis Bristol supplied were sent to Carrozzeria Bertone where they received a highly aerodynamic body with a flowing design that allowed the minimal hood height to clear the cars&#x27; three single barrel Solex 32 carburetors. The bodies were designed by Bertone&#x27;s new designer/aerodynamicist, Franco Scaglione (soon to be famous as the designer of the Alfa Romeo B.A.T. concept cars). The very tall Bristol engine created problems for designing a sleek-looking sports car. Franco Scaglione handled these with particular genius - first by incorporating a hood scoop to lower the surrounding sheet metal, and then by incorporating sharply creased fender lines out over the wheels to draw the eye&#x27;s attention away from the unusually tall peak in the hood. A few design changes were requested by S.H. Arnolt.

Arnolt created a racing team for the Sebring 12-hour race, and in 1955, at their first attempt, the special lightweight cars finished first, second and fourth in the Sports 2000 class, winning the Team Trophy, a feat which was replicated in 1956 and 1960. The following year they took second and third in class. In 1957 the team withdrew after Bob Goldich&#x27;s fatal accident on the first lap of his first stint in the car co-driven by Wacky Arnolt, while a privately entered Arnolt Bristol finished fifth in class. 1960 brought a final class win, finishing 1st, 2nd and 3rd in class, and placing 14th, 22d and 39th overall.
The cars were available in four body styles: competition—a stripped road racer; bolide—a slightly better-appointed road racer; deluxe—a better-appointed version of the bolide (side windows and convertible top, instruments mounted in a housing in front of the driver, glove box set in the dash); and coupé, with pop-up headlights. At least one open car was subsequently fitted with a removable hardtop by S.H. Arnolt. Prices as per a 1956 factory letter were $3995 for the competition model, $4245 for the bolide, $4995 for the deluxe and $5995 for the coupé.

Factory options for the Arnolt-Bristol included a front sway bar, remote shifter, 11-inch Alfin drum brakes, convertible top, bumpers, Borrani KO steel wheels (nine sets were sold, and one car was sold with Borrani wire wheels) and several different rear end gear ratios. A special racing fuel tank was installed in some of the race cars but was never offered for sale to the public. Late in 1959 and 60, the 12-inch bell-shaped Bristol drum setup was offered, and in 1961 Bristol front disc brakes were offered to retro fit to the Arnolt-Bristol. The majority of the cars had steel bodies, with aluminum trunk and hood.

The cars came with an owner&#x27;s manual, spares manual and shop workbook, as well as a spare wheel and tire and complete tool kit. Additional items such as Arnolt key fobs, neck ties, ice buckets and Arnolt logo head scarves were available from the company. A wide variety of promotional literature, including brochures and postcards, was also produced.

All of the cars were originally sold with Bristol BS1 MkII six-cylinder engines; some have subsequently been fitted with other engines.

All Arnolt-Bristols were built between January 14, 1953, and December 12, 1959. The majority were built in 1954 and 1959. A total of 142 cars were produced, of which 12 were written off after a factory fire. The fire-damaged cars were used as a source of spares by Arnolt in later years. The total production included six coupés, and two aluminum alloy-bodied cars. One of the cars was originally right hand drive: the rest were all left hand drive. One of the cars never received a body, and was used as a rolling chassis for auto shows. This chassis is still in the possession of the Arnolt family.

Approximately 85 of the cars are still known to be extant, in conditions that vary from needing complete restoration to concours quality.

Despite the racing successes, the cars did not sell well.

Some of the cars did not sell until after 1960, and the last car to be sold, fitted with four headlights, remained unsold until 1968.

===Common Misconceptions regarding the Arnolt-Bristol===

A number of published sources have contained errors on the production numbers of the Arnolt-Bristol. In part, this may be because some authors production or sales figures have been compared to existing copies of the S.H. Arnolt sales ledger. It is important to note that this ledger only records sales of the cars in the United States. As a result, European sales were not included. One result is that several sources claim only three coupés were built, when there were in fact six: one was sold in France and the other two in Spain (the chassis numbers of all of which are recorded in the Bristol Owner&#x27;s Club registry). At the Paris Auto Show in 1955, an up-and-coming actor, Lee Marvin, saw the Arnolt-Bristol coupé and purchased it. In later years, Marvin would win the Oscar for Best Actor, and after his death, his ultra-rare Arnolt-Bristol Coupé (the only Arnolt ever built with the coved front fenders that would also appear on the Corvette later in its C1 production run) sold at auction for $451,000.

A second misconception is that the Arnolt-Bristol cars were originally fitted with any engines other than the Bristol six-cylinder. All Arnolt-Bristols were originally sold with the Bristol engine; S.H. Arnolt did not fit any other engines. In later years, thanks to the spacious engine compartment, a variety of larger engines such as American V8s have been fitted to individual cars.

A third misconception is that S.H. Arnolt built the cars. The Arnolt-Bristol was built in Filton as a powered chassis; the body was fitted by Bertone in Italy, and only final assembly, fitting of options, prep work and (occasionally) paint and upholstery changes were done in Warsaw, Indiana.

<text>The Boatman&#x27;s Call is the tenth studio album by the Australian rock band Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds, released on 3 March 1997 by Mute Records. The album is entirely piano-based, alternately somber and romantic in mood, making it a marked departure from the bulk of the band&#x27;s post-punk catalogue up to that point. &quot;The Boatman&#x27;s Call&quot; remains one of the most critically acclaimed releases of Nick Cave&#x27;s career.

== Background and production ==
Recording for the album began at Sarm West Studios in London, England in mid-1996, with &quot;The Garden Duet&quot;, one of the album&#x27;s outtakes, being the first song recorded. Though the bulk of &quot;The Boatman&#x27;s Call&quot; was recorded at Sarm West, further recordings—including overdubs—were later done at Abbey Road Studios.

Musically, the album&#x27;s tone is considered sombre and minimalist and marks a major departure for Cave and the Bad Seeds. Moving away from full-band arrangements and character-based narratives, the album&#x27;s music and lyrics move towards the more intimate sound of Cave&#x27;s solo voice accompanied by piano or a few other instruments. The tempo is also generally slow, reflecting many of the moods of the songs. Many of the lyrics seem to reflect on Cave&#x27;s personal relationships and spiritual yearnings at the time of writing. Some songs are thought to be directed at either the mother of Cave&#x27;s oldest son Luke, Viviane Carneiro (in &quot;Where Do We Go Now But Nowhere?&quot;) or singer PJ Harvey, with whom he had a brief relationship around that time (as referenced in &quot;West Country Girl&quot;, &quot;Black Hair&quot; and &quot;Green Eyes&quot;). &quot;Green Eyes&quot; includes a line from &quot;Sonnet 18&quot; by the French Renaissance poet Louise Labé (&quot;Kiss me, rekiss me, &amp; kiss me again&quot;).

Cave performed &quot;Into My Arms&quot; at the 1997 funeral of INXS vocalist Michael Hutchence, an old friend from Cave&#x27;s youth, and requested that the TV cameras be shut off for his performance out of respect for Hutchence. The song &quot;People Ain&#x27;t No Good&quot; was also featured in the film &quot;Shrek 2&quot; (2004). The song &quot;There Is a Kingdom&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Zack Snyder&#x27;s Justice League&quot; (2021). In October 2010, the album was listed in the top 30 in the book, &quot;100 Best Australian Albums&quot; (2010).

== Critical reception ==

&quot;The Boatman&#x27;s Call&quot; received almost unanimous critical acclaim upon release with many reviewers citing it as Cave&#x27;s most poignant album. Writing in &quot;NME&quot;, James Oldham concluded that the album is &quot;a stark look at all that he&#x27;s been through, recounted with withering bleakness and arid humour&quot;, noting &quot;Cave&#x27;s magnificent lyrics, riddled with comic misanthropy and New Gospel humanity&quot;, and &quot;their starkly beautiful accompaniments&quot;. The magazine rated it as the 23rd best album of 1997. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot; (2010).

<text>The term annual percentage rate of charge (APR), corresponding sometimes to a nominal APR and sometimes to an effective APR (EAPR), is the interest rate for a whole year (annualized), rather than just a monthly fee/rate, as applied on a loan, mortgage loan, credit card, etc. It is a finance charge expressed as an annual rate. Those terms have formal, legal definitions in some countries or legal jurisdictions, but in the United States:
:* The &quot;nominal APR&quot; is the simple-interest rate (for a year).
:* The &quot;effective APR&quot; is the fee+compound interest rate (calculated across a year).

In some areas, the &quot;annual percentage rate&quot; (APR) is the simplified counterpart to the effective interest rate that the borrower will pay on a loan. In many countries and jurisdictions, lenders (such as banks) are required to disclose the &quot;cost&quot; of borrowing in some standardized way as a form of consumer protection. The (effective) APR has been intended to make it easier to compare lenders and loan options.

==Multiple definitions of effective APR==
The nominal APR is calculated by multiplying the interest rate for a payment period by the number of payment periods in a year. However, the exact legal definition of &quot;effective APR&quot;, or EAR, can vary greatly in each jurisdiction, depending on the type of fees included, such as participation fees, loan origination fees, monthly service charges, or late fees. The effective APR has been called the &quot;mathematically-true&quot; interest rate for each year.

The computation for the effective APR, as the fee + compound interest rate, can also vary depending on whether the up-front fees, such as origination or participation fees, are added to the entire amount, or treated as a short-term loan due in the first payment. When start-up fees are paid as first payment(s), the balance due might accrue more interest, as being delayed by the extra payment period(s).

Effective annual percentage rate can be computed in at least three ways:
* by compounding the interest rate for each year, without considering fees;
* origination fees are added to the balance due, and the total amount is treated as the basis for computing compound interest;
* the origination fees are amortized as a short-term loan. This loan is due in the first payment(s), and the unpaid balance is amortized as a second long-term loan. The extra first payment(s) is dedicated to primarily paying origination fees and interest charges on that portion.

For example, consider a $100 loan which must be repaid after one month, plus 5%, plus a $10 fee. If the fee is not considered, this loan has an effective APR of approximately 80% (1.0512 = 1.7959, which is approximately an 80% increase). If the $10 fee were considered, the monthly interest increases by 10% ($10/$100), and the effective APR becomes approximately 435% (1.1512 = 5.3503, which equals a 435% increase). Hence there are at least two possible &quot;effective APRs&quot;: 80% and 435%. Laws vary as to whether fees must be included in APR calculations.

===United States===
In the United States, the Truth in Lending Act governs the calculation and disclosure of APR, implemented by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) through Regulation Z. In general, APR in the United States is expressed as the periodic (for instance, monthly) interest rate times the number of compounding periods in a year (also known as the nominal interest rate); since the APR must include certain non-interest charges and fees, it requires more detailed calculation. The APR must be disclosed to the borrower within 3 days of applying for a mortgage. This information is typically mailed to the borrower and the APR is found on the truth in lending disclosure statement, which also includes an amortization schedule.

On July 30, 2009, provisions of the Mortgage Disclosure Improvement Act of 2008 (MDIA) came into effect. A specific clause of this act refers directly to APR disclosure on mortgages. It states, if the final annual percentage rate APR is off by more than 0.125% from the initial GFE disclosure, then the lender must re-disclose and wait another three business days before closing on the transaction.

The calculation for &quot;close-ended credit&quot; (such as a home mortgage or auto loan) can be found here. For a fixed-rate mortgage, the APR is thus equal to its internal rate of return (or yield) under an assumption of zero prepayment and zero default. For an adjustable-rate mortgage the APR will also depend on the particular assumption regarding the prospective trajectory of the index rate.

The calculation for &quot;open-ended credit&quot; (such as a credit card, home equity loan or other line of credit) can be found here.

===European Union===
The European Union&#x27;s APR standardization focuses on transparency and consumer rights: «a comprehensible set of information to be given to consumers in good time before the contract is concluded and also as part of the credit agreement [...] every creditor has to use this form when marketing a consumer credit in any Member State» so marketing different figures is not allowed.

The EU regulations were reinforced with directives 2008/48/EC and 2011/90/EU, fully in force in all member states since 2013.
However, in the UK the EU directive has been interpreted as the Representative APR.

A single method of calculating the APR was introduced in 1998 (directive 98/7/EC) and is required to be published for the major part of loans. Using the improved notation of directive 2008/48/EC, the basic equation for calculation of APR in the EU is:
:: formula_1
:where:
:: &quot;M&quot; is the total number of drawdowns paid by the lender
:: &quot;N&quot; is the total number of repayments paid by the borrower
:: &quot;i&quot; is the sequence number of a drawdown paid by the lender
:: &quot;j&quot; is the sequence number of a repayment paid by the borrower
:: &quot;Ci&quot; is the cash flow amount for drawdown number &quot;i&quot;
:: &quot;Dj&quot; is the cash flow amount for repayment number &quot;j&quot;
:: &quot;ti&quot; is the interval, expressed in years and fractions of a year, between the date of the first drawdown* and the date of drawdown &quot;i&quot;
:: &quot;sj&quot; is the interval, expressed in years and fractions of a year, between the date of the first drawdown* and the date of repayment &quot;j&quot;.
* The EU formula uses the natural convention that all time intervals in &quot;ti&quot; and &quot;sj&quot; are measured relative to the date of the first drawdown, hence &quot;t1&quot; = 0. However, any other date could be used without affecting the calculated APR, as long as it is used consistently: an offset applied to all times simply scales both sides of the equation by the same amount, without affecting the solution for APR.

In this equation the left side is the present value of the drawdowns made by the lender and the right side is the present value of the repayments made by the borrower. In both cases the present value is defined given the APR as the interest rate. So the present value of the drawdowns is equal to the present value of the repayments, given the APR as the interest rate.

Note that neither the amounts nor the periods between transactions are necessarily equal. For the purposes of this calculation, a year is presumed to have 365 days (366 days for leap years), 52 weeks or 12 equal months. As per the standard: &quot;An equal month is presumed to have 30.41666 days (i.e. 365/12) regardless of whether or not it is a leap year.&quot; The result is to be expressed to at least one decimal place. This algorithm for APR is required for some but not all forms of consumer debt in the EU. For example, this EU directive is limited to agreements of €50,000 and below and excludes all mortgages.

In the Netherlands the formula above is also used for mortgages. In many cases the mortgage is not always paid back completely at the end of period &quot;N&quot;, but for instance when the borrower sells his house or dies. In addition, there is usually only one payment of the lender to the borrower: in the beginning of the loan. In that case the formula becomes:
:: formula_2
:where:
:: &quot;S&quot; is the borrowed amount or principal amount.
:: &quot;A&quot; is the prepaid onetime fee
:: &quot;R&quot; the rest debt, the amount that remains as an interest-only loan after the last cash flow.

If the length of the periods are equal (monthly payments) then the summations can be simplified using the formula for a geometric series. Either way, the APR can be solved iteratively only from the formulas above, apart from trivial cases such as &quot;N=1&quot;.

===Additional considerations===
* Confusion is possible in that if the word &quot;effective&quot; is used separately as meaning &quot;influential&quot; or having a &quot;long-range effect&quot;, then the term &quot;effective APR&quot; will vary, as it is not a strict legal definition in some countries. The APR is used to find compound and simple interest rates.
* APR is also an abbreviation for &quot;Annual Principal Rate&quot; which is sometimes used in the auto sales in some countries where the interest is calculated based on the &quot;Original Principal&quot; not the &quot;Current Principal Due&quot;, so as the Current Principal Due decreases, the interest due does not.

==Rate format==

An effective annual interest rate of 10% can also be expressed in several ways:
* 0.7974% effective monthly interest rate, because 1.00797412=1.1
* 9.569% annual interest rate compounded monthly, because 12×0.7974=9.569
* 9.091% annual rate in advance, because (1.1-1)÷1.1=0.09091

These rates are all equivalent, but to a consumer who is not trained in the mathematics of finance, this can be confusing. APR helps to standardize how interest rates are compared, so that a 10% loan is not made to look cheaper by calling it a loan at &quot;9.1% annually in advance&quot;.

The APR does not necessarily convey the total amount of interest paid over the course of a year: if one pays part of the interest prior to the end of the year, the total amount of interest paid is less.

In the case of a loan with no fees, the amortization schedule would be worked out by taking the principal left at the end of each month, multiplying by the monthly rate and then subtracting the monthly payment.

This can be expressed mathematically by

:formula_3
:where:
::&quot;p&quot; is the payment made each period
:: &quot;P0&quot; is the initial principal
:: &quot;r&quot; is the percentage rate used each payment
:: &quot;n&quot; is the number of payments

This also explains why a 15-year mortgage and a 30-year mortgage with the same APR would have different monthly payments and a different total amount of interest paid. There are many more periods over which to spread the principal, which makes the payment smaller, but there are just as many periods over which to charge interest at the same rate, which makes the total amount of interest paid much greater. For example, $100,000 mortgaged (without fees, since they add into the calculation in a different way) over 15 years costs a total of $193,429.80 (interest is 93.430% of principal), but over 30 years, costs a total of $315,925.20 (interest is 215.925% of principal).

In addition the APR takes costs into account. Suppose for instance that $100,000 is borrowed with $1000 one-time fees paid in advance. If, in the second case, equal monthly payments are made of $946.01 against 9.569% compounded monthly then it takes 240 months to pay the loan back. If the $1000 one-time fees are taken into account then the yearly interest rate paid is effectively equal to 10.31%.

The APR concept can also be applied to savings accounts: imagine a savings account with 1% costs at each withdrawal and again 9.569% interest compounded monthly. Suppose that the complete amount including the interest is withdrawn after exactly one year. Then, taking this 1% fee into account, the savings effectively earned 8.9% interest that year.

===Money factor===

The APR can also be represented by a money factor (also known as the lease factor, lease rate, or factor). The money factor is usually given as a decimal, for example .0030. To find the equivalent APR, the money factor is multiplied by 2400. A money factor of .0030 is equivalent to a monthly interest rate of 0.6% and an APR of 7.2%.

For a leasing arrangement with an initial capital cost of &quot;C&quot;, a residual value at the end of the lease of &quot;F&quot; and a monthly interest rate of &quot;r&quot;, monthly interest starts at &quot;Cr&quot; and decreases almost linearly during the term of the lease to a final value of &quot;Fr&quot;. The total amount of interest paid over the lease term of &quot;N&quot; months is therefore

:formula_4

and the average interest amount per month is

:formula_5

This amount is called the &quot;monthly finance fee&quot;. The factor &quot;r&quot;/2 is called the &quot;money factor&quot;

==Failings in the United States==
Despite repeated attempts by regulators to establish usable and consistent standards, APR does not represent the total cost of borrowing in some jurisdictions nor does it really create a comparable standard across jurisdictions. Nevertheless, it is considered a reasonable starting point for an &quot;ad hoc&quot; comparison of lenders.

===Nominal APR does not reflect the true cost===
Credit card holders should be aware that most U.S. credit cards are quoted in terms of nominal APR compounded monthly, which is not the same as the effective annual rate (EAR). Despite the word &quot;annual&quot; in APR, it is not necessarily a direct reference for the interest rate paid on a stable balance over one year. The more direct reference for the one-year rate of interest is EAR.
The general conversion factor for APR to EAR is
formula_6,
where &quot;n&quot; represents the number of compounding periods of the APR per EAR period.
As an example, for a common credit card quoted at 12.99% APR compounded monthly, the one year EAR is
formula_7,
or 13.7975%.
For 12.99% APR compounded daily, the EAR paid on a stable balance over one year becomes 13.87% (where the .000049 addition to the 12.99% APR is possible because the new rate does not exceed the advertised APR ). Note that a high U.S. APR of 29.99% compounded monthly carries an effective annual rate of 34.48%.

While the difference between APR and EAR may seem trivial, because of the exponential nature of interest these small differences can have a large effect over the life of a loan. For example, consider a 30-year loan of $200,000 with a stated APR of 10.00%, i.e., 10.0049% APR or the EAR equivalent of 10.4767%. The monthly payments, using APR, would be $1755.87. However, using an EAR of 10.00% the monthly payment would be $1691.78. The difference between the EAR and APR amounts to a difference of $64.09 per month. Over the life of a 30-year loan, this amounts to $23,070.86, which is over 11% of the original loan amount.

===Certain fees are not considered===
Some classes of fees are deliberately not included in the calculation of APR. Because these fees are not included, some consumer advocates claim that the APR does not represent the &quot;total&quot; cost of borrowing. Excluded fees may include:
* routine one-time fees which are paid to someone other than the lender (such as a real estate attorney&#x27;s fee).
* penalties such as late fees or service reinstatement fees without regard for the size of the penalty or the likelihood that it will be imposed.

Lenders argue that the real estate attorney&#x27;s fee, for example, is a pass-through cost, not a cost of the lending. In effect, they are arguing that the attorney&#x27;s fee is a separate transaction and not a part of the loan. Consumer advocates argue that this would be true if the customer is free to select which attorney is used. If the lender insists, however, on using a specific attorney, the cost should be looked at as a component of the total cost of doing business with that lender. This area is made more complicated by the practice of contingency fees – for example, when the lender receives money from the attorney and other agents to be the one used by the lender. Because of this, U.S. regulators require all lenders to produce an affiliated business disclosure form which shows the amounts paid between the lender and the appraisal firms, attorneys, etc.

Lenders argue that including late fees and other conditional charges would require them to make assumptions about the consumer&#x27;s behavior – assumptions which would bias the resulting calculation and create more confusion than clarity.

===Not a comparable standard===
Even beyond the non-included cost components listed above, regulators have been unable to completely define which one-time fees must be included and which excluded from the calculation. This leaves the lender with some discretion to determine which fees will be included (or not) in the calculation.

Consumers can, of course, use the nominal interest rate and any costs on the loan (or savings account) and compute the APR themselves, for instance using one of the calculators on the internet.

In the example of a mortgage loan, the following kinds of fees are:

The discretion that is illustrated in the &quot;sometimes included&quot; column even in the highly regulated U.S. home mortgage environment makes it difficult to simply compare the APRs of two lenders. Note: U.S. regulators generally require a lender to use the same assumptions and definitions in their calculation of APR for each of their products even though they cannot force consistency across lenders.

With respect to items that may be sold with vendor financing, for example, automobile leasing, the notional cost of the good may effectively be hidden and the APR subsequently rendered meaningless. An example is a case where an automobile is leased to a customer based on a &quot;manufacturer&#x27;s suggested retail price&quot; with a low APR: the vendor may be accepting a lower lease rate as a trade-off against a higher sale price. Had the customer self-financed, a discounted sales price may have been accepted by the vendor; in other words, the customer has received cheap financing in exchange for paying a higher purchase price, and the quoted APR understates the true cost of the financing. In this case, the only meaningful way to establish the &quot;true&quot; APR would involve arranging financing through other sources, determining the lowest-acceptable cash price and comparing the financing terms (which may not be feasible in all circumstances). For leases where the lessee has a purchase option at the end of the lease term, the cost of the APR is further complicated by this option. In effect, the lease includes a put option back to the manufacturer (or, alternatively, a call option for the consumer), and the value (or cost) of this option to the consumer is not transparent.

===Dependence on loan period===
APR is dependent on the time period for which the loan is calculated. That is, the APR for a 30-year loan cannot be compared to the APR for a 20-year loan. APR &quot;can&quot; be used to show the relative impact of different payment schedules (such as balloon payments or biweekly payments instead of straight monthly payments), but most standard APR calculators have difficulty with those calculations.

Furthermore, most APR calculators assume that an individual will keep a particular loan until the end of the defined repayment period, resulting in the up-front fixed closing costs being amortized over the full term of the loan. If the consumer pays the loan off early, the effective interest rate achieved will be significantly higher than the APR initially calculated. This is especially problematic for mortgage loans, where typical loan repayment periods are 15 or 30 years but where many borrowers move or refinance before the loan period runs out, which increases the borrower&#x27;s effective cost for any points or other origination fees.

In theory, this factor should not affect any individual consumer&#x27;s ability to compare the APR of the same product (same repayment period and origination fees) across vendors. APR may not, however, be particularly helpful when attempting to compare different products, or similar products with different terms.

====Interest-only loans====
Since the principal loan balance is not paid down during the interest-only term, assuming there are no set up costs, the APR will be the same as the interest rate.

Three lenders with identical information may still calculate different APRs. The calculations can be quite complex and are poorly understood even by most financial professionals. Most users depend on software packages to calculate APR and are therefore dependent on the assumptions in that particular software package. While differences between software packages will not result in large variations, there are several acceptable methods of calculating APR, each of which returns a slightly different result.

==Limitations==
Despite its usefulness in comparing borrowing costs across different loans and credit offers, APR has several limitations that can affect its accuracy and relevance, particularly for certain types of loans.

=== Potential misrepresentation of short-term loan costs ===
There are instances where APR may be misleading or an inaccurate measure of borrowing costs. It is argued that the APR can be misleading when applied to small-dollar loans, such as payday loans, because it does not accurately represent the true cost of borrowing for short-term financial products. While effective for comparing costs of longer-term loans, APR exaggerates the expense associated with short-term, small-dollar loans, thus potentially misleading consumers about the actual costs they will incur.

In a paper by Thomas W. Miller Jr. at the Mercatus Center, it is argued that while interest rate caps are often proposed as a means to combat &quot;predatory&quot; lending practices associated with high APRs on small-dollar loans, such regulatory measures overlook potential adverse effects. The analysis suggests that a 36 percent interest rate cap could lead to a scarcity of available loans, as the caps may cause demand to surpass supply and prompt lenders to redirect capital away from small-dollar lending markets. This shift could effectively result in an implicit prohibition of products like payday loans by rendering them financially unsustainable.

===Inaccuracy in mortgage comparisons===
APR may not accurately reflect the cost of borrowing for certain mortgage types, such as those with non-standard repayment structures. APR calculations, which aim to provide a comprehensive cost measure by including interest rates and other fees, might not capture the complexities or the true costs of mortgages that deviate from traditional, fixed-rate, amortizing loans. This discrepancy arises because APR is designed under the assumption of a standard loan structure, potentially misleading consumers about the financial implications of mortgages with variable rates, interest-only periods, or other unique features.

===Exclusion of junk fees===
APR does not encompass all fees associated with a loan, particularly &quot;junk fees&quot;. These excluded fees can include various types of non-interest charges such as certain closing costs, which are not reflected in the APR calculation. This exclusion can mislead consumers about the true cost of borrowing, as the APR presents a narrower scope of expenses than what the borrower may eventually pay.

<text>Łęczyca (; in full the Royal Town of Łęczyca, ; ; ) is a town of inhabitants in central Poland. Situated in the Łódź Voivodeship, it is the county seat of the Łęczyca County. Łęczyca is a capital of the historical Łęczyca Land.

== Origin of the name ==
The town was probably named after a West Slavic (Lechitic) tribe called Leczanie, which inhabited central Poland in the early Middle Ages. Some scholars however claim that the town was named after an Old Polish word łęg, which means a swampy plain.

In medieval Latin documents, Łęczyca is called Lonsin, Lucic, Lunciz, Lantsiza, Loncizia, Lonsitia and Lunchicia. In the early 12th century, Gallus Anonymus called Łęczyca &quot;Lucic&quot;, and in 1154, Arab geographer Muhammad al-Idrisi named it Nugrada, placing it among other main towns of the Kingdom of Poland, such as Kraków, Sieradz, Gniezno, Wrocław and Santok.

== Location ==
Łęczyca lies in the middle of the county, and has the area of . In the past, the town was the capital of the Łęczyca Land, which was later turned into Łęczyca Voivodeship. In the Second Polish Republic and in 1945 - 1975, Łęczyca belonged to Lodz Voivodeship. In 1975–1998, it was part of Plock Voivodeship. The geometric centre of Poland is located near Łęczyca.

== History ==
Łęczyca is one of the oldest Polish cities, mentioned in the 12th century. It was the place of the first recorded meeting of Sejm, the Polish parliament, in 1180. In 1229, during the period of fragmentation of Poland, it became the capital of the Duchy of Łęczyca, which in 1263 was split into two parts - the Duchy of Łęczyca and the Duchy of Sieradz. In the early 14th century, the Łęczyca Voivodeship was created with Łęczyca serving as its capital. This administrative unit of the Kingdom of Poland was part of the larger Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown and existed until the Partitions of Poland in the late 18th century. It was a royal city of the Polish Crown.

Łęczyca, which lies in the centre of Poland, was for centuries one of the most important cities of the country. It received Magdeburg rights before 1267, and in 1331 the Teutonic Knights sacked the city during one of their repeated incursions into Poland. A considerable number of buildings were burned down, including two churches. A few decades later, on the initiative of Casimir the Great, the city was walled and a Royal Castle built to the southeast of the city.

Łęczyca prospered in the period between the mid-14th and mid-17th centuries. The royal castle, built by Casimir the Great, was located on a small hill, protected by a moat with water from the Bzura river. The complex was made from red brick, set on stone foundations. It was protected by a 10-meter high wall, with a tower located in its southwestern corner. Gate tower was placed in the western wall, in the basement was a prison, and in the courtyard there was a two-storey tenement building. Rooms of that building frequently housed meetings of the Royal Council. In 1964, widespread renovation of the complex began. Another building was added at that time, which now houses the Museum of the Land of Łęczyca.

Soon after its completion in the mid-14th century, the castle was named one of royal residences, and the seat of the Starosta of Łęczyca. In 1406, it was burned by the Teutonic Knights, but the complex was rebuilt so quickly that in 1409, King Władysław II Jagiełło attended here a meeting of his advisors, discussing the oncoming war with the Knights.
Following the Battle of Grunwald (1410), a number of high-ranking Teutonic prisoners was kept here for ransom. Four sessions of the Sejm (Polish parliament) took place here: in 1420, 1448, 1454 and 1462. In 1420, a Bohemian delegation offered here the Czech crown to Jagiełło. In 1433, the Truce of Łęczyca was signed in the city. Furthermore, the castle served as headquarters of King Casimir IV Jagiellon, during the Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–66). The city&#x27;s prominence came to an end with the Swedish invasion of Poland when the castle was overrun and most of the city once again destroyed, and it remained in a state of crisis until the Partitions. One of two main routes connecting Warsaw and Dresden ran through the town in the 18th century and Kings Augustus II the Strong and Augustus III of Poland often traveled that route.

===World War II===
During the German invasion of Poland, which started World War II, the Germans executed 29 Poles, including two families on September 9–10, 1939. Łęczyca was then occupied by Nazi Germany and incorporated into the region known as Reichsgau Wartheland as part of the district (&quot;kreis&quot;) of Lentschütz (Germanized word for &#x27;Łęczyca&#x27;). The Germans expelled 330 Poles from the town in December 1939. Further expulsions of Poles were carried out in 1940. Poles were deported to a transit camp in nearby Ozorków, and afterwards young people were deported from the camp to forced labour in Germany, and children and older people were deported to the General Government (German-occupied central Poland), while their homes, shops and workshops were handed over to German colonists as part of the &quot;Lebensraum&quot; policy. In January 1942 there was a forced labor camp operating in or near the town.

Jews had been an important part of the population of Łęczyca since the late 1400s. At the beginning of the war in 1939, the Jewish population was more than 4000, about 30 percent of the community. The Germans began to terrorize, pillage, and humiliate the Jewish population from the beginning of the occupation. The Germans established a ghetto in late 1939, and later forbade any Jew to leave it on penalty of death. After the ghetto was enclosed, hunger and typhus ravaged the ghetto population. Periodically, hundreds of the community were expelled to other places, while Jews in other locations were brought to Łęczyca. In April 1942, the remaining Jews, about 1700 people, were sent to the Chełmno extermination camp where they were immediately gassed. The local Poles took over their houses and what meager possessions they left behind.

After the war it was reintegrated into the Polish People&#x27;s Republic.

<doc id="857775" wikidata="Q753713" url="?curid=857775" title="Batgirl">
<text>Batgirl is the name of several fictional superheroines appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics, depicted as female counterparts and allies to the superhero Batman. The character Betty Kane was introduced into publication in 1961 by Bill Finger and Sheldon Moldoff as Bat-Girl, and was replaced in 1967 by Barbara Gordon, who became the most iconic Batgirl. The character debuted in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #359 (January 1967) by writer Gardner Fox and artist Carmine Infantino, introduced as the niece/adoptive daughter of police commissioner James Gordon.

Batgirl operates in Gotham City, allying herself with Batman and the original Robin, Dick Grayson, along with other masked vigilantes. The character appeared regularly in &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, &quot;Batman Family&quot;, and several other books produced by DC until 1988. That year, Barbara Gordon appeared in Barbara Kesel&#x27;s &quot;Batgirl Special&quot; #1, in which she retires from crime-fighting. She subsequently appeared in Alan Moore&#x27;s graphic novel &quot;&quot; where, in her civilian identity, she is shot by the Joker and left paraplegic. Although she is reimagined as the computer expert and information broker Oracle by editor Kim Yale and writer John Ostrander the following year, her paralysis sparked debate about the portrayal of women in comics, particularly violence depicted toward female characters.

In the 1999 storyline &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot;, the character Helena Bertinelli, known as Huntress, briefly assumes the role of Batgirl until she is stripped of the identity by Batman for violating his stringent codes. Within the same storyline, the character Cassandra Cain is introduced. Cain is written as the daughter of assassins David Cain and Lady Shiva and takes the mantle of Batgirl under the guidance of Batman and Oracle. In 2000, she became the first Batgirl to star in an eponymous monthly comic book series, in addition to becoming one of the most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comics. The series was canceled in 2006, at which point during the company-wide storyline &quot;One Year Later&quot;, she is established as a villain and head of the League of Assassins. After receiving harsh feedback from readership, she is later restored to her original conception. However, the character Stephanie Brown, originally known as Spoiler and later Robin, succeeds her as Batgirl after Cassandra Cain abandons the role.

Stephanie Brown became the featured character of the &quot;Batgirl&quot; series from 2009 to 2011, prior to DC&#x27;s The New 52 relaunch, which established Barbara Gordon recovering from her paralysis following a surgical procedure and starring as the title character of &quot;Batgirl&quot; once again. Barbara later returned to the Oracle role with Infinite Frontier in 2020, and currently operates as both Batgirl and Oracle, with Cassandra and Stephanie also serving as Batgirls. The Barbara Gordon version of Batgirl has been adapted into various media relating to the Batman franchise, including television, film, animation, video games, and other merchandise. Dan DiDio, co-publisher of DC Comics, expressed that Barbara is the best-known version of the character.

== Publication history ==
===&quot;Detective Comics&quot;, &quot;Batman Family&quot;, and other appearances (1961–1988)===

Following the accusations of a homoerotic subtext in the depiction of the relationship between Batman and Robin as described in Fredric Wertham&#x27;s book &quot;Seduction of the Innocent&quot; (1954), a female character, Kathy Kane the Batwoman, appeared in 1956 as a love interest for Batman. In 1961, DC Comics introduced a second female character as a love interest for Robin. Betty Kane as &quot;Bat-Girl&quot; arrived as the niece of, and Robin-like sidekick to, Batwoman, first appearing in &quot;Batman&quot; #139 (April 1961). The creation of the Batman family, which included Batman and Batwoman depicted as parents, Robin and Bat-Girl depicted as their children, the extraterrestrial imp Bat-Mite and the &quot;family pet&quot; Ace the Bat-Hound, caused the Batman-related comic books to take &quot;a wrong turn, switching from superheroes to situational comedy&quot;.

DC Comics abandoned these characters in 1964 when newly appointed Batman-editor Julius Schwartz judged them too silly and therefore inappropriate. Schwartz had asserted that these characters should be removed, considering the Batman related comic books had steadily declined in sales, and restored the Batman mythology to its original conception of heroic vigilantism. Bat-Girl, along with other characters in the Batman Family, were retconned out of existence following the 1985 limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;. However, even though Bat-Girl did not exist in the Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; continuity, a modified version of the character, Mary Elizabeth &quot;Bette&quot; Kane, introduced as the superhero Flamebird, continues to appear in DC Comics publications.

Schwartz stated that he had been asked to develop a new female character to attract a female viewership to the &quot;Batman&quot; television series of the 1960s. Executive producer William Dozier suggested that the new character would be the daughter of Gotham City&#x27;s Police Commissioner James Gordon, and that she would adopt the identity of Batgirl. When Dozier and producer Howie Horowitz saw rough concept artwork of the new Batgirl by artist Carmine Infantino during a visit to DC offices, they optioned the character in a bid to help sell a third season to the ABC television network. Infantino reflected on the creation of Batgirl, stating &quot;Bob Kane had had a Bat-Girl for about three stories in the ’50s but she had nothing to do with a bat. She was like a pesky girl version of Robin. I knew we could do a lot better, so Julie and I came up with the real Batgirl, who was so popular she almost got her own TV show.&quot; Yvonne Craig portrayed the character in the show&#x27;s third season. Barbara Gordon and her alter ego Batgirl debuted in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #359, &quot;The Million Dollar Debut of Batgirl&quot; (1967). In the debut story, while driving to a costume ball dressed as a female version of Batman, Barbara Gordon intervenes in a kidnapping attempt on Bruce Wayne by the supervillain Killer Moth, attracting Batman&#x27;s attention and leading to a crimefighting career. Although Batman insists she give up crimefighting because of her gender, Batgirl disregards his objections.

In her civilian identity, Dr. Barbara Gordon is a career woman with a doctorate in library science, as well as being head of the Gotham City Public Library, &quot;presumably one of the largest public libraries in the DC Comics version of reality.&quot; She was given a regular back-up slot in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; starting with issue #384 (February 1969), alternating issues with Robin until issue #404, after which she had the back-up slot to herself. Frank Robbins wrote nearly all of these back-ups, which were penciled first by Gil Kane and later by Don Heck. Barbara Gordon&#x27;s Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #417 (1971), stating: &quot;I&#x27;d like to say a few words about the reaction some readers have to Batgirl. These are readers who remember Batwoman and the other Bat-girls from years back ... They were there because romance seemed to be needed in Batman&#x27;s life. But thanks to the big change and a foresighted editor, these hapless females are gone for good. In their place stands a girl who is a capable crime-fighter, a far cry from Batwoman who constantly had to be rescued [by] Batman.&quot;

Batgirl continued to appear in DC Comics publications throughout the late 1960s and 1970s as a supporting character in &quot;Detective Comics&quot;, in addition to guest appearances in various titles such as &quot;Justice League of America&quot;, &quot;World&#x27;s Finest Comics&quot;, 
&quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot;, &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, and &quot;Superman&quot;. 
In the early-1970s, Batgirl reveals her secret identity to her father (who had already discovered it on his own) and serves as a member of the United States House of Representatives. She moves to Washington, D.C., intending to give up her career as Batgirl, and in June 1972 appeared in a story entitled &quot;Batgirl&#x27;s Last Case.&quot; Julius Schwartz brought her back a year later in &quot;Superman&quot; #268 (1973) in which she has a blind date with Clark Kent, establishing their friendship, and fights alongside Superman. Batgirl and Superman team up twice more, in &quot;Superman&quot; #279 and &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #19. Batgirl also guest-starred in other Superman related titles, such as #453 of &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; and in &quot;Superman Family&quot; #171, where she teams up with Supergirl.

The character is given a starring role in DC&#x27;s &quot;Batman Family&quot; comic book which debuted in 1975. The original Robin, Dick Grayson, became her partner in the series, with the two frequently referred to as the &quot;Dynamite Duo: Batgirl &amp; Robin&quot;. Batgirl meets Batwoman in &quot;Batman Family&quot; #10, when the retired superhero briefly returns to crimefighting (before the Bronze Tiger murders Kane). The two fight Killer Moth and the Cavalier, and learn each other&#x27;s secret identities. Batwoman retires once again at the conclusion of the story, leaving Batgirl to continue crimefighting. Although this series ended after three years of publication, Batgirl continued to appear in back-up stories published in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; through issue #519 (October 1982).

&quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, a limited series published in 1985, was written to reduce the complex history of DC Comics to a single continuity. Although Batgirl is a featured character, her role is relatively small—she delivers Supergirl&#x27;s eulogy in issue #7 of the 12-part series. The conclusion of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; changed DC Universe continuity in many ways. Following the reboot, Barbara Gordon is born to Roger and Thelma Gordon, and she is Jim Gordon&#x27;s niece and adopted daughter in post - crisis continuity. Post-&quot;Crisis&quot;, Supergirl does not arrive on Earth until after Gordon has established herself as Oracle, and many of the adventures she shared with Batgirl are retroactively described as having been experienced by Power Girl. In &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (vol. 2) #20 (1987), Barbara Gordon&#x27;s origin is rebooted by author Barbara Randal. Within the storyline, Gordon recounts the series of events that led to her career as Batgirl, including her first encounter with Batman as a child, studying martial arts under the tutelage of a sensei, memorizing maps and blueprints of the city, excelling in academics to skip grades, and pushing herself to become a star athlete.

===&quot;Batgirl Special&quot; #1 and &quot;Batman: The Killing Joke&quot; (1988)===
DC officially retired the hero in the one-shot comic &quot;Batgirl Special&quot; #1 (July 1988), written by Barbara Kesel. Later that year, she appears in Alan Moore&#x27;s &quot;Batman: The Killing Joke&quot;. In this graphic novel, the Joker shoots and paralyzes Barbara Gordon in an attempt to drive her father insane, thereby proving to Batman that anyone can lose their minds after having &quot;one bad day&quot;. She is deployed as a plot device to cement the Joker&#x27;s vendetta against Commissioner Gordon and Batman. In 2006, during an interview with &quot;Wizard&quot;, Moore expressed regret over his treatment of the character, calling it &quot;shallow and ill-conceived&quot;. He stated prior to writing the graphic novel, &quot;I asked DC if they had any problem with me crippling Barbara Gordon—who was Batgirl at the time—and if I remember, I spoke to Len Wein, who was our editor on the project&quot;, and following a discussion with then-Executive Editorial Director Dick Giordano, &quot;Len got back onto the phone and said, ‘Yeah, okay, cripple the bitch.&#x27;&quot;

Although there has been speculation as to whether or not editors at DC specifically intended to have the character&#x27;s paralysis become permanent, Brian Cronin, author of &quot;Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed&quot; (2009) noted that DC had hired Barbara Kesel to write the &quot;Batgirl Special&quot; specifically to retire the character and set her in place for &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;. Gail Simone included the character&#x27;s paralysis in a list of &quot;major female characters that had been killed, mutilated, and depowered&quot;, dubbing the phenomenon &quot;Women in Refrigerators&quot; in reference to a 1994 Green Lantern story where the title character discovers his girlfriend&#x27;s mutilated body in his refrigerator. Following the release of the graphic novel, comic book editor and writer Kim Yale discussed how distasteful she found the treatment of Barbara Gordon with her husband, fellow comic writer John Ostrander. Rather than allow the character to fall into obscurity, the two decided to revive her as a character living with a disability—the information broker called the Oracle.

===&quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (1999)===
Eleven years after the editorial retirement of Barbara Gordon as Batgirl, a new version of the character was introduced in &quot;Batman: Shadow of the Bat&quot; #83 during the multi-title story arc &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; (1999). In &quot;&quot; #120 (1999), the new Batgirl is revealed to be Helena Bertinelli, an established DC comics superhero alternatively known as the Huntress. Bertinelli is eventually forced to abandon the mantle by Batgirl. &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; also marks the introduction of Cassandra Cain in &quot;Batman&quot; #567 (1999). Depicted as a martial arts child prodigy, Cassandra Cain is written as a young woman of partly Asian descent who succeeds Helena Bertinelli as Batgirl, with the approval of both Batman and the Oracle.

===&quot;Batgirl&quot; and other appearances (2000–2011)===

The first &quot;Batgirl&quot; monthly comic was published in 2000, with Cassandra Cain as the title character. Raised by assassin David Cain, Cassandra Cain was not taught spoken language, but instead was taught to &quot;read&quot; physical movement. Subsequently, Cain&#x27;s only form of communication was body language. The parts of the character&#x27;s brain normally used for speech were trained so Cain could read other people&#x27;s body language and predict, with uncanny accuracy, their next move. This also caused her brain to develop learning functions different from most, a form of dyslexia that hampers her abilities to read and write.

Despite Cain&#x27;s disability, author Andersen Gabrych describes the character&#x27;s unique form of language as the key factor in what makes Cain an excellent detective; the ability to walk into a room and &quot;know&quot; something is wrong based on body language. During &quot;Silent Running&quot;, the first arc of the &quot;Batgirl&quot; comic book series, Cassandra Cain encounters a psychic who &quot;reprograms&quot; her brain, enabling her to comprehend verbal language, while simultaneously losing the ability to predict movements. This issue is resolved during the second arc of the series, &quot;A Knight Alone&quot;, when Batgirl encounters the assassin Lady Shiva who agrees to teach her how to predict movement once again. Six years after its debut, DC Comics cancelled the &quot;Batgirl&quot; comic book series with issue #73 (2006), ending with Cain relinquishing her role as Batgirl.

When DC Comics continuity skipped forward one year after the events of the limited series &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Cassandra Cain is revived as the leader of the League of Assassins, having abandoned her previous characterization as an altruist. The character&#x27;s progression from hero to villain angered some of her fans and was accompanied by heavy criticism. Cain reprised her role as Batgirl in the &quot;Titans East&quot; (2007) storyline of &quot;Teen Titans&quot;, where it was discovered that she had been influenced by a mind-altering drug administered by supervillain Deathstroke the Terminator. Following the conclusion of the storyline, DC Comics has restored Cain&#x27;s original characterization as a superhero and the character has been given a supporting role in the comic book series &quot;Batman and the Outsiders&quot;.

Following the events of , Cassandra, acting under her mentor&#x27;s orders in the event of his death, handed over the Batgirl mantle to Stephanie Brown, the former Spoiler and the fourth Robin. After declining an offer from Tim Drake to reclaim the Batgirl mantle from Stephanie, Cassandra rejoined the Batman Family under the new identity of the Blackbat. She currently acts as the Hong Kong representative of Batman Inc.

Stephanie Brown does take the mantle of Batgirl after Cassandra Cain gives Brown her costume under Batman&#x27;s orders. Eventually, Barbara Gordon approves of Brown as her newest successor — and she gives Brown her own Batgirl costume and becomes her mentor for a period. Brown is the fourth in-continuity Batgirl and the second Batgirl to star in her own ongoing &quot;Batgirl&quot; comic book series.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;: &quot;Batgirl&quot;, &quot;Birds of Prey&quot;, and other appearances (2011–2016)===
In September 2011, following the company-wide relaunch, Barbara Gordon stars in a new &quot;Batgirl&quot; series—one of &quot;The New 52&quot; titles featuring the company&#x27;s most iconic characters. The conclusion of the limited series &quot;Flashpoint&quot; (2011) establishes a new continuity within the DC Universe, with all characters regressing to an earlier age and stage in their careers, while remaining in a modern timeline. DC Senior VP of Sales, Bob Wayne, explained that with each of their titles reverting to issue #1, &quot;our creative teams have the ability to take a more modern approach—not only with each character, but with how the characters interact with one another and the universe as a whole, and focus on the earlier part of the careers of each of our iconic characters.&quot; Barbara Gordon is biological daughter of James Gordon and Barbara Eileen Gordon in this continuity. Wayne also stated that &quot;&quot;The Killing Joke&quot; still happened and she was Oracle. Now she will go through physical rehabilitation and become a more seasoned and nuanced character because she had these incredible and diverse experiences. Dan DiDio, Co-Publisher of DC Comics explained the decision by stating that &quot;she&#x27;ll always be the most recognizable [Batgirl].&quot; Series writer Gail Simone stated: &quot;For many years, I got to write the character as Oracle, and there is to this day, no character who means more to me. This is classic Barbara as she was originally conceived, with a few big surprises. It&#x27;s a bit of a shock, to be sure, but we’re doing everything we can to be respectful to this character&#x27;s amazing legacy, while presenting something thrilling that a generation of comics readers will be experiencing for the first time ...Barbara Gordon leaping, fighting, and swinging over Gotham. Now, when citizens of that city look up, they are going to see BATGIRL. And that is absolutely thrilling.&quot;

In the new, revised continuity, the events of &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; took place three years before the current storyline, and while it is established she was paraplegic during that time, Barbara Gordon is written as having regained her mobility after undergoing experimental surgery at a South African clinic. Although she resumes her work as Batgirl one year after her recovery, she continues to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, causing her to hesitate in battle when exposed to gunfire that could result in suffering new spinal damage. The character also exhibits survivor guilt due to the fact she has made a full recovery from her paralysis while others have not. Series writer Gail Simone stated that while the character is &quot;one of the smartest and toughest women in comics ...One thing the book is truly about, is that the after-effects of something like PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder) or other trauma-related syndromes, can strike even very smart, very intellectually tough people, even soldiers and cops&quot;, a subject that is generally overlooked in comic books. She also explained the method of the character&#x27;s recovery is based upon real life experiences in that &quot;some of the best real world work in the field of mobility rehabilitation is coming from South Africa. People have been talking about this as if it&#x27;s some sort of mystical thing like returning from the dead, but there are treatments and surgeries that can restore mobility in some cases. Barbara&#x27;s spine was not severed. That makes her a candidate.&quot;

Prior to its release, &quot;Batgirl&quot; #1 sold out at the distribution level with over 100,000 copies printed in its first run according to Diamond Comic Distributors. Along with &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1, &quot;Justice League&quot; #1, &quot;Batman&quot; #1, &quot;Batman and Robin&quot; #1, &quot;&quot; #1, &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #1, &quot;Flash&quot; #1, &quot;Green Lantern&quot; #1, and &quot;Superman&quot; #1, retailers were required to order a second printing. Calvin Reid of &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; states in a review of the first issue: &quot;The artwork is okay though conventional, while Simone&#x27;s script tries to tie up of the end of the previous Barbara Gordon/Oracle storyline and setup up the new Batgirl. Her formula: murderous villains, blood splattering violence and high flying superheroics mixed with single-white-female bonding ...plus a cliffhanger ending to the first issue that offers a nifty [segue] into the new world of Barbara Gordon and Batgirl.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic George Gene Gustines wrote: &quot;Unlike some of the other DC comics I read this week, Batgirl achieves a deft : a well-shaped reintroduction to a character, an elegant acknowledgement of fundamental history and the establishment of a new status quo. This is a must-buy series.&quot; Earning a B+ rating in a review from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Ken Tucker writes that Simone &quot;[takes] her Birds of Prey storytelling powers and focuses them on the newly revived Barbara Gordon as Batgirl. The result is a burst of exhilaration, as Barbara/Batgirl revels in her new freedom even as she encounters a so-far not-terribly-chilling villain called Mirror.&quot;

Since the series relaunch in September 2011, &quot;Batgirl&quot; has remained within the top 30 of the 300 best-selling monthly comic book publications sold in North America. Monthly estimated sales figures are as follows: &quot;Batgirl&quot; #1 with 81,489 copies (ranked 12th overall), &quot;Batgirl&quot; #2 with 75,227 (ranked 14th), &quot;Batgirl&quot; #3 with 62,974 (ranked 18th), &quot;Batgirl&quot; #4 with 53,975 (ranked 23rd), &quot;Batgirl&quot; #5 with 51,327 (ranked 26th), and &quot;Batgirl&quot; #6 with 47,836 (ranked 30th). The hardcover edition of volume 1, &quot;Batgirl: The Darkest Reflection&quot;, which collects issues #1–6, made &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list, alongside &quot;Animal Man: The Hunt&quot;, &quot;Batman &amp; Robin: Born to Kill&quot;, &quot;Batman: Detective Comics&quot;, &quot;Wonder Woman: Blood&quot;, &quot;Batwoman: Hydrology&quot;, &quot;Green Lantern: Sinestro&quot;.

Additionally, Barbara Gordon makes an appearance in &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; #1, where the Black Canary offers her a spot on the new Birds of Prey roster. She declines the Canary&#x27;s invitation, suggesting that Katana take her place instead. Series writer Duane Swierczynski has stated that Batgirl will join the team in issue #4. He commented that while she &quot;is an essential part of this team&quot;, she is not the focus of the series, as she is hesitant to be associated with the other characters because of their status as outlaws.

In October 2014, the monthly Batgirl title underwent a soft reboot with the new creative team Brenden Fletcher (writer) Cameron Stewart (writer, layouts), Babs Tarr (artist) and Maris Wicks (colors). The first six-issue story explored Barbara Gordon&#x27;s attempt to start a new life as a PhD student in the hip Gotham borough of Burnside. While seemingly light and engaging compared to Gail Simone&#x27;s darker preceding run, the new arc ultimately dealt with Babs&#x27; inability to fully escape her and the villain was revealed as her own brain scans, an algorithm similar to the Pre-&quot;New 52&quot; Oracle. While the reboot was highly praised for its fun, energy, innovative use of social media, and particularly for Tarr&#x27;s art, issue #37 caused controversy with its depiction of a villain named Dagger Type, which some critics saw as a transphobic caricature. In response, the creative team issued a joint apology and revised the issue for the subsequent collected edition, &quot;Batgirl Vol. 1: The Batgirl of Burnside&quot;.

On March 13, 2015, DC Comics released 25 Joker-themed variant covers for its various monthly series for release that June, in celebration of the character&#x27;s 75th anniversary. Among them was a cover to &quot;Batgirl&quot; #41 by artist Rafael Albuquerque that took its inspiration from &quot;The Killing Joke&quot;. The cover depicts the Joker standing next to a tearful Batgirl, who has a red smile painted across her mouth. The Joker has one hand holding a revolver draped over Batgirl&#x27;s shoulder and is pointing to her cheek with the other hand, as if gesturing to shoot her.

The cover quickly drew criticism for highlighting a dark period in the character&#x27;s history, especially when juxtaposed with the youthful, more optimistic direction of the series at the time. The hashtag #changethecover drew dozens of posts on Twitter and Tumblr asking DC to not release the variant. DC ultimately withdrew the cover from publication at the request of Albuquerque, who stated, &quot;My intention was never to hurt or upset anyone through my art...For that reason, I have recommended to DC that the variant cover be pulled.&quot;

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;: &quot;Batgirl&quot; and &quot;Batgirl and the Birds of Prey&quot; (2016–2020)===
In March 2016, DC Comics announced it would be re-launching all of its monthly titles under the &quot;DC Rebirth&quot; event. The relaunch restores elements of the Pre-&quot;Flashpoint&quot; DC continuity while maintaining elements of &quot;The New 52&quot; as well. Among the new titles and creative teams announced, volume 5 of &quot;Batgirl&quot; written by Hope Larson and volume 1 of &quot;Batgirl and the Birds of Prey&quot; written by Julie Benson and Shawna Benson were included. In the critically celebrated fifth volume of &quot;Batgirl&quot;, Barbara Gordon is a student attending Burnside College in the trendy Burnside neighborhood of Gotham City. The comic was praised for its fun, fresh approach to the character and for Batgirl&#x27;s realistic new costume design.

===&quot;Infinite Frontier&quot;: &quot;Batgirls&quot; (2021–present)===
In 2021, DC&#x27;s Infinite Frontier relaunch presented a new status quo, where Barbara has returned to the role of Oracle, suiting up as Batgirl only occasionally. For the most part, she supports Cassandra Cain and Stephanie Brown to operate as Batgirls, sharing the title.

===Alternative versions===
Various alterations of Barbara Gordon as Batgirl have appeared in storylines published in and out of mainstream continuity titles. Variants of the character within continuity often appear in stories which involve time travel, such as the crossover limited series &quot;Zero Hour: Crisis in Time&quot;, a follow-up story preceded by the 1985 limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; which altered mainstream continuity. Notable imprints of DC Comics such as &quot;Elseworlds&quot; and &quot;All Star DC Comics&quot; have also featured alternate versions of the character.

The &quot;Elseworlds&quot; imprint takes the company&#x27;s iconic characters and places them in alternate timelines, places and events making heroes &quot;as familiar as yesterday seem as fresh as tomorrow&quot;. As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon has made several appearances in &quot;Elseworlds&quot; comics since 1997. The character is given starring roles in the noir-style storyline &quot;Thrillkiller&quot; (1997), its sequel &quot;Thrillkiller &#x27;62&quot; (1998), and the one-shot comic &quot;Elseworld&#x27;s Finest: Supergirl &amp; Batgirl&quot; (1998).

In 2005, DC Comics launched its &quot;All Star&quot; imprint—an ongoing series of comics designed to pair the company&#x27;s most iconic characters with the most acclaimed writers and artists in the industry. Similar to &quot;Elseworlds&quot;, &quot;All Star&quot; is not restricted to mainstream continuity and establishes a fresh perspective for the latest generation of readership. According to Dan DiDio, &quot;[t]hese books are created to literally reach the widest audience possible, and not just the comic book audience, but anyone who has ever wanted to read or see anything about Superman or Batman.&quot;

An alternate Barbara Gordon was adapted into Frank Miller&#x27;s &quot;All Star Batman and Robin the Boy Wonder&quot; (2005) as a teenage Batgirl. In addition, another variation of the character had been set to star in an eponymous &quot;All Star Batgirl&quot; title, written by Geoff Johns; however, the series was cancelled prior to publication.

Alternate versions of Batgirl aside from Barbara Gordon have also appeared in publications by DC Comics. In &quot;Batman Beyond Unlimited&quot; #18 (set in the continuity of the animated series &quot;Batman Beyond&quot;), the new Batgirl is a 15-year-old girl named Nissa. In &quot;Batgirl: Future&#x27;s End&quot; #1 (Nov. 2014), set in an alternate future, a trio of Batgirls include Cassandra Cain, Stephanie Brown and newcomer Tiffany Fox—the daughter of Lucius Fox and the first African American character to be portrayed as Batgirl.

In the alternate history &quot;DC Comics Bombshells&quot; universe, there is no singular Batgirl. Instead, there exists a group of young female vigilantes known as &quot;&quot;, whose ranks consist of a Batwoman fan named Harper Row, an African American mechanic named Kathy Duquesne, a young Caucasian girl named Nell Little, and a Singaporean-American dancer named Alysia Yeoh. In Digital Issue #42 (collected in Print Issue #14), Harley Quinn tells Pamela Isley about encountering &quot;the &quot;, who appears to be a vampire version of Batgirl. &quot;DC Comics Bombshells Annual&quot; #1, published on 31 August 2016, reveals that was a French fighter pilot during World War I. After she lost her boyfriend during the war, she traveled to Louisiana and did indeed become a vampire.

In 2021, Barbara Gordon is one of the main protagonists in &quot;Batman &#x27;89&quot;. While working in Gotham&#x27;s police department, she dates Harvey Dent. She assumes the role of Batgirl in the second series, &quot;Echoes&quot;.

In 2022 Daphne Blake from &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; became a temporary Batgirl in &quot;The Batman &amp; Scooby-Doo Mysteries&quot;.

==Characterization==
Batgirl has officially been represented by four different characters – and two claimants – beginning with her introduction in 1961.

===Betty Kane===

During the Silver Age, a female character was introduced as a love interest for Robin. Betty Kane as &quot;Bat-Girl&quot; was depicted as the niece of, and Robin-like sidekick to, the original Batwoman. In 1964, however, editor Julius Schwartz asserted that Bat-Girl and other characters in the Bat-Family should be removed considering the decline in sales and restored the Batman mythology to its original conception of heroic vigilantism. During the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; storyline, Betty Kane was retconned out of existence.
Mary Elizabeth &quot;Bette&quot; Kane is a reinvented version of the Betty Kane character during the Silver Age. As her original characterization was retconned out of existence during the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; storyline, a discrepancy arose where her Bat-Girl character had joined the West Coast version of the Teen Titans, but simply disappeared. The character was reintroduced as Bette Kane and the alias of Flamebird. Following &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, the character&#x27;s past as Batgirl was hinted at as being a part of continuity. However, that reference included a revamped origin of the character and it may or may not have been the current Bette Kane.

===Barbara Gordon===
During the run of the Batman television series, DC editorial was approached about adding a female character back into the Batman family. Revising the character history and motivation, Julius Schwartz created Barbara Gordon. This character held the role of Batgirl from 1967 to 1988 when she was retired by DC editorial decision. The character&#x27;s role was changed to a paraplegic source of information for all members of the Batman family and codenamed the &quot;Oracle&quot;. She was later restored as Batgirl during &quot;The New 52&quot; relaunch of the entire DC publication line in 2011. This was also the case with the DC Rebirth (2016). After the suicide of her psychopathic brother James Gordon Jr., Barbara ponders her role as Batgirl, becomes Oracle and continues to support the Batman family behind the computer screen, with the option to occasionally return to the role of Batgirl. Above all, she takes on the role of mentor for Cassandra Cain and Stephanie Brown, who now share the title of Batgirl.

===Cassandra Cain===

During the &quot;&quot; storyline, Cassandra Cain was given the role of Batgirl under the guidance of Batman and Oracle. Written as the daughter of assassins David Cain and Lady Shiva, she is trained from early childhood to read human body language instead of developing verbal and written communication skills as part of her father&#x27;s conditioning to mold her into the world&#x27;s deadliest assassin. However, after committing her first murder, she vows to never again use her martial-arts prowess to kill. In 2000, she became the first Batgirl to star in an eponymous monthly comic book series, as well as one of the most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comics. The series was cancelled in 2006 and Cassandra Cain abandoned the role of Batgirl shortly thereafter. Years later, Cassandra rejoined the Batman family under the moniker the Blackbat. In &quot;The New 52&quot;, Cassandra reappeared in the comic series &quot;Batman and Robin Eternal&quot; with a slightly different history. Here she is also the murderer of Harper Row&#x27;s mother, an ally of Batman. She called herself Orphan for a while and became part of the Batman family as well as the Outsiders. She later shares the name Batgirl with her friend Stephanie Brown.

===Stephanie Brown===

Stephanie Brown was formerly known as the Spoiler and then as the first in-continuity female Robin until her apparent death in 2006. Following her return to comics in 2009, she assumed the role of Batgirl. She maintained this position until 2011, the relaunch of the DC imprint under &quot;The New 52&quot;. The character reappeared in the DCU in &quot;Batman&quot; (vol. 3) #28, as the Spoiler. Stephanie reappears in the series &quot;Batman Eternal&quot;, where she again goes by Spoiler in an attempt to thwart her father&#x27;s machinations. After &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, she joined Batman&#x27;s new team of vigilantes where she became the girlfriend of Tim Drake aka Red Robin before they break up. Eventually she shares the title Batgirl with her friend Cassandra Cain.

===Claimants===
====Helena Bertinelli====
For a brief time during 1999&#x27;s &quot;No Man&#x27;s Land&quot; storyline, Helena Bertinelli assumed the mantle of Batgirl. After violating Batman&#x27;s code against extreme violence, she was stripped of the mantle and returned to her alias of the Huntress.

====Charlotte &quot;Charlie&quot; Gage-Radcliffe====

After Cassandra Cain abandoned the role, a mystery character appeared as the new Batgirl in the &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; comic. Possessing superpowers, the teen claimed the empty mantle in an attempt to honor the character. However, Barbara Gordon quickly dissuaded the teen from continuing in the role. Charlie Gage-Radcliffe acquiesced, but modified her costume and changed her name to the Misfit.

==Cultural impact==
While Barbara Gordon and Cassandra Cain have both been the subject of academic analysis regarding the portrayal of women in comics, commentary on Barbara Gordon&#x27;s Batgirl has focused on her character&#x27;s connection to the women&#x27;s liberation movement, doctoral degree and career as a librarian, while analysis of Cassandra Cain&#x27;s Batgirl has focused on the character&#x27;s double minority status as a woman and a person of color. Since her debut in DC Comics publication, and fueled by her adaptation into the &quot;Batman&quot; television series in 1967, Barbara Gordon&#x27;s Batgirl has been listed among fictional characters that are regarded as cultural icons. Author Brian Cronin, in &quot;Was Superman A Spy?: And Other Comic Book Legends Revealed&quot; (2009) notes that following her 1967 debut, &quot;Batgirl was soon popular enough to appear regularly over the next two decades and Yvonne Craig certainly made an impression on many viewers with her one season portraying young Ms. Gordon.&quot; In 2011, IGN ranked Barbara Gordon 17th in the Top 100 Comic Books Heroes. Cassandra Cain&#x27;s Batgirl has become one of the most prominent Asian characters to appear in American comic books, and her understated sexuality is notable as being contrary to the common sexual objectification of female characters, especially those of Asian descent.

===Feminist interpretations===

In &quot;The Supergirls: Fashion, Feminism, Fantasy, and the History of Comic Book Heroines&quot; (2009), author Mike Madrid states that what set Barbara Gordon as Batgirl apart from other female characters was her motivation for crime-fighting. Unlike Batwoman who preceded her, &quot;she wears his symbol on her chest, but she is not his girlfriend or faithful handmaiden.&quot; Because of the fact she does not pursue a romantic interest in Batman, &quot;Batgirl is a female Batman can actually regard as a brilliant peer and a partner in the war on crime, the same way he would a male.&quot; Historian Peter Sanderson observed that Barbara Gordon&#x27;s Batgirl reflected the Women&#x27;s liberation movement of the 1960s.

During the 1980s, Barbara Kesel, after writing a complaint to DC Comics over the negative portrayal of female characters, was given the opportunity to write for Barbara Gordon in &quot;Detective Comics&quot;. Robin Anne Reid, in &quot;Women in Science Fiction and Fantasy: Overviews&quot; (2009) wrote that &quot;Kesel&#x27;s version of Batgirl established her as a character separate from Batman and Robin: a woman motivated to do what men do, but alone and in her own way. Her &quot;Secret Origins&quot; (1987) and &quot;Batgirl Special&quot; (1988) countered the victimized and objectified presentation of Barbara Gordon/Batgirl in Alan Moore&#x27;s acclaimed &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; (1988).&quot; She notes that Kesel&#x27;s interpretation of the character emphasized her intelligence, technological skill, and ability to overcome fear.

Gail Simone included the character&#x27;s paralysis in a list of &quot;major female characters that had been killed, mutilated, and depowered&quot;, dubbing the phenomenon &quot;Women in Refrigerators&quot; in reference to a 1994 Green Lantern story where the title character discovers his girlfriend&#x27;s mutilated body in his refrigerator. Simone highlighted the gender difference regarding the treatment of Batman and Batgirl regarding paralysis by stating that &quot;[b]oth had their backs broken [Batman broke his in a dramatic Batcave confrontation with the villain Bane; Batgirl broke hers when she was ambushed in her home and shot in the spine by the Joker, never given a chance to fight]. Less than a year later, Batman was fine. Batgirl—now named Oracle—was in a wheelchair and remained so for many years.&quot;

In &quot;Superheroes and Superegos: Analyzing the Minds Behind the Masks&quot; (2010), author Sharon Packer wrote that &quot;[a]nyone who feels that feminist critics overreacted to [Gordon&#x27;s] accident is advised to consult the source material&quot;, calling the work &quot;sadistic to the core&quot;.

Brian Cronin noted that &quot;[many] readers felt the violence towards Barbara Gordon was too much, and even Moore, in retrospect, has expressed his displeasure with how the story turned out.&quot; Jeffrey A. Brown, author of &quot;Dangerous Curves: Action Heroines, Gender, Fetishism, and Popular Culture&quot; (2011) noted &quot;The Killing Joke&quot; as an example of the &quot;inherent misogyny of the male-dominated comic book industry&quot; in light of the &quot;relatively unequal violence [female characters] are subjected to.&quot; While male characters may be critically injured or killed, they are more than likely to be returned to their original conception, while female characters are more likely to receive permanent damage. Reid states that although speculation behind the editorial decision to allow the paralysis of the character to become permanent included the idea she had become outdated, &quot;if audiences had grown tired of Batgirl, it was not because she was a bad character but because she had been written badly.&quot;

Despite views that present the character&#x27;s Batgirl persona as a symbol of female empowerment, a long-held criticism is that she was originally conceived as an uninspired variation of Batman &quot;rather than standing alone as leader, such as Wonder Woman&quot; who had no pre-existing male counterpart. In analyzing stereotypes in gender, Jackie Marsh noted that male superheroes (such as Batman) are depicted as hyper-masculine and anti-social, &quot;while female superheroes are reduced to a childlike status by their names&quot; such as the Batgirl character.

===Representation for librarians===
In &quot;The Image and Role of the Librarian&quot; (2002), Wendi Arant and Candace R. Benefiel argue that Batgirl&#x27;s portrayal as a librarian is considered to be significant to the profession, in that it is represented as a valuable and honorable career. Even in light of the fact that the character abandons it to run for United States Congress, Barbara Gordon is seen as being given a &quot;career switch that even most librarians would consider a step up.&quot; In the essay &quot;Librarians, Professionalism and Image: Stereotype and Reality&quot; (2007), Abigail Luthmann views the character less favorably, stating that &quot;[t]he unassuming role of librarian is used as a low-visibility disguise for her crime-fighting alter-ego, and while her information-locating skills may have been useful to her extra-curricular activities no direct examples are given.&quot;

===Representation for Asian Americans===

The Cassandra Cain version of Batgirl, depicted as a biracial character (half White and half Chinese), is notable as one of the most prominent characters of Asian descent to appear in American comic books. Jeffrey A. Brown states that while her ethnicity is rarely mentioned in the comic books, Asian women have had a long history in comics of being portrayed as martial artists and are often exploited as sex objects. However, in the case of Batgirl, &quot;Cassandra&#x27;s racial identity is treated more implicitly than explicitly. Her costume design actually conceals her entire body so that while in her guise as Batgirl her ethnicity is completely unapparent.&quot; The fact that her sexuality is also understated represents a shift away from the typical portrayals of women, and Asian women in particular. The most controversial aspect of her character came about during the &quot;One Year Later&quot; event, when she is reintroduced as a villain. The abrupt shift in her character brought about negative criticism from readership. When questioned about the change in characterization, writer Adam Beechen stated: &quot;They didn&#x27;t present me with a rationale as to why Cassandra was going to change, or a motivating factor. That was left for me to come up with and them to approve. And we did that. But as far as to why the editors and writers and whoever else made the decision decided that was a good direction, I honestly couldn&#x27;t answer.&quot;

==In other media==
Portrayed by Yvonne Craig, the character&#x27;s first adaptation outside of comic books took place in the third season of &quot;Batman&quot; (1967), Barbara Gordon having been discussed months earlier by her father and Batman in the second-season episodes &quot;Batman&#x27;s Waterloo&quot; and &quot;The Duo Defy&quot;. Les Daniels, in &quot;Batman: The Complete History&quot; (2004), wrote that the goal of ABC was to &quot;attract new audience members, especially idealistic young girls and less high-minded older men.&quot; According to Craig: &quot;I used to think the reason they hired me was because they knew I could ride my own motorcycle ... I realized they hired me because I had a cartoon voice.&quot; A shared criticism of Batgirl and other female superheroes in television that came later (such as Wonder Woman and the Bionic Woman), is that she was not allowed to engage in hand-to-hand combat on screen. As such, &quot;her fights were choreographed carefully to imitate the moves of a Broadway showgirl through the use of a straight kick to her opponent&#x27;s face rather than the type of kick a martial artist would use.&quot; However, Craig has also stated: &quot;I meet young women who say Batgirl was their role model ... They say it&#x27;s because it was the first time they ever felt girls could do the same things guys could do, and sometimes better. I think that&#x27;s lovely.&quot; During the early 1970s, Craig portrayed Batgirl once again in a public service announcement to advocate equal pay for women.

Since &quot;Batman&quot;, the character has had a long history of appearances in television and other media. As Batgirl, Barbara Gordon plays a supporting role in a string of animated series, voiced by Jane Webb in &quot;The Batman/Superman Hour&quot; (1968), Melendy Britt in &quot;The New Adventures of Batman&quot; (1977), Melissa Gilbert in &quot;&quot; (1992), Tara Strong in &quot;The New Batman Adventures&quot; (1997), Danielle Judovits in &quot;The Batman&quot; (2004), Mae Whitman in &quot;&quot; (2008), and Briana Cuoco in &quot;Harley Quinn&quot; (2019). In 2012, Batgirl starred alongside Supergirl and Wonder Girl in &quot;Super Best Friends Forever&quot;, a series of shorts developed by Lauren Faust for the &quot;DC Nation&quot; block on Cartoon Network.

Barbara Gordon makes two cameo appearances in the first season of the animated series &quot;Young Justice&quot;, and is added as a recurring character in season two where she has adopted her Batgirl persona. Dina Meyer starred as Barbara Gordon in the television series &quot;Birds of Prey&quot; (2002). Although this series focused on her role as the Oracle, the series included flashbacks of the character&#x27;s history as Batgirl.

In the film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot;, Alicia Silverstone played a variation of the character: Barbara Wilson, Alfred Pennyworth&#x27;s niece. She appears in &quot;The Lego Batman Movie&quot; voiced by Rosario Dawson. The character is introduced as Barbara Gordon taking over from her father Jim Gordon to become the new Police Commissioner of Gotham. Towards the end of the film, she dons her cowl and teams up with Batman as Batgirl in addition to her role as Commissioner.

In &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; trilogy, James Gordon&#x27;s wife is named Barbara Gordon, portrayed by Ilyssa Fradin in &quot;Batman Begins&quot; and Melinda McGraw in &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;. This is not a reference to Batgirl Barbara Gordon. It&#x27;s been long established, most notably in the famous Batman: Year One, that the wife of James Gordon is named Barbara.

In addition to live-action television and animation, the character has appeared in a number of video games included in the Batman franchise. She appears in &quot;The Adventures of Batman &amp; Robin&quot; and &quot;&quot; voiced by Tara Strong. She also appears in &quot;Lego Batman&quot; for the PC, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Wii, DS, and PlayStation Portable. In &quot;Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure&quot;, The Barbara Gordon incarnation of Batgirl appears when Maxwell heads to Arkham Asylum to battle the Scarecrow. The other three Batgirls (Bette Kane, Stephanie Brown and Cassandra Cain) also appear as summonable characters. Barbara Gordon has been featured in all four main games of the critically acclaimed , though she is only seen as Batgirl in the &quot;A Matter of Family&quot; DLC for the last game, &quot;&quot; (2015), in which she is playable. Set before the events of the series&#x27; , the DLC&#x27;s plot revolves around Batgirl and Robin attempting to save the former&#x27;s father, along with other police officers, from the Joker at an abandoned amusement park located on an oil rig. Barbara Gordon as Batgirl is one of the four main playable characters in the video game &quot;Gotham Knights&quot; (2022).

A child version of Barbara Gordon made an appearance in the television series &quot;Gotham&quot;. Actor Ben McKenzie teased about seeing Batgirl as a child in the series. Film director Nicolas Winding Refn revealed in an interview with Collider that he would like to direct a Batgirl movie.

Savannah Welch portrays Barbara Gordon in the third season of the 2018 live-action television series &quot;Titans&quot;.

In March 2017, it was announced that Joss Whedon would write, direct and produce a Batgirl film as part of the DC Extended Universe. The film would center on Barbara Gordon as Batgirl, with Gail Simone&#x27;s &quot;The New 52&quot; Batgirl comics used as &quot;a starting point&quot; for the film. In February 2018, it was announced that Whedon would be leaving the project as writer and director, citing that &quot;[he] didn&#x27;t really have a story&quot;. In April 2018, Warner Bros. announced that screenwriter Christina Hodson had been tapped to write the screenplay for Batgirl. After Whedon&#x27;s exit, the studio said that it was actively looking for a female director. In May 2021, it was revealed that Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah had joined the project as co-directors. It was also revealed that the film is going to be an HBO Max Exclusive. In July 2021, actress and singer Leslie Grace was cast as Batgirl. The film was subsequently cancelled in August 2022.

<doc id="857776" wikidata="Q54052" url="?curid=857776" title="Władysław III Spindleshanks">
<text>Władysław III Spindleshanks (; b. 1161/67 – 3 November 1231), of the Piast dynasty, was Duke of Greater Poland (during 1194–1202 over all the land and during 1202–1229 only over the southern part), High Duke of Poland and Duke of Kraków during 1202–1206 and 1228–1231, Duke of Kalisz during 1202–1206, ruler of Lubusz during 1206–1210 and 1218–1225, and ruler over Gniezno during 1216–1217.

He was the fifth son of Mieszko III the Old, Duke of Greater Poland and since 1173 High Duke of Poland, but the third-born from his second marriage with Eudoxia, daughter of Grand Prince Iziaslav II of Kiev.

The nickname &quot;Spindleshanks&quot; (&quot;Laskonogi&quot;) was given to Władysław in the Chronicle of Greater Poland. Jan Długosz assumed that this was in reference to Władysław&#x27;s unusually long and thin legs.

==Under the rule of Mieszko III the Old==
The first appearance of Władysław in contemporary sources was around 1168 in reference to the congress of Jędrzejów where, as a small child, he was a witness in a donation to the local Cistercian monastery.

Between 1177 and 1179 Władysław, his parents and siblings were forced to leave Poland as a result of the rebellion of Casimir II the Just and Odon, Mieszko III&#x27;s eldest son from his first marriage, who resented the clear favoritism showed by his father to the offspring of his second marriage. Władysław returned to his family only in 1181 and, despite being legally an adult, was not given his own district. Around 1186, Władysław married Lucia, daughter of Jaromar I, Prince of Rügen. The union, whose principal purpose was to increase the influence of Mieszko III in Western Pomerania, was childless.

After the death of Władysław&#x27;s half-brother Odon on 20 April 1194, Władysław assumed the control of the Duchy in Southern Greater Poland (the Obra River), as guardian of his minor nephew Władysław Odonic (son of Odon, born ca. 1190).

On 13 September 1195, the death of his only surviving brother Bolesław in the bloody Battle of Mozgawa left Władysław as the sole heir of Mieszko III, and he began trying to restore the lands controlled by his father in the Duchy of Kraków and to assume the overlordship of Poland.

==Duke of Kraków and Greater Poland==
Mieszko III died on 13 March 1202. Władysław could succeed his father without barriers in Kraków, Greater and Lesser Poland, thanks to the support of the powerful voivode Mikołaj Gryfita. However, an opponent soon arose to the throne of Kraków: the eldest son of Casimir II the Just, Leszek I the White, but his candidacy collapsed because he based its rule on the count palatine Goworek, who was a stubborn enemy of the voivode Mikołaj.

==Loss of the Kraków throne==
Władysław&#x27;s rule as Duke of Kraków and High Duke of Poland lasted for four years, until 1206, when, after the death of his principal supporter voivode Mikołaj Gryfita, Leszek I the White returned to the capital. The cause of the rebellion was a tough enforcement of rights against the powerful nobility and the alliance with the Pomeranians. Some historians placed the loss of Kraków by Władysław in an earlier period: a few months after the death of his father in 1202. In the absence of sources for this period, however, this fact is difficult to verify.

==Plans to restore Polish suzerainty over Pomerania==
Interest in the Pomeranian affairs, Władysław was involved in two events. The first was a solemn meeting with King Valdemar II of Denmark, during which attempted to resolve disputes and determine the zone of influence. The second event was a surprising agreement with the Duke of Wrocław, Henry I the Bearded, under which Władysław surrendered the Duchy of Kalisz (part of the patrimony of his nephew Władysław Odonic) in exchange of Lubusz, whereby it was easier to pursue an active policy on the Baltic coast. But in 1209 Władysław lost Lubusz, taken by Conrad II of Landsberg, Margrave of Lusatia (his brother-in-law), who defeated the Duke in the Battle of Lubusz. Eventuality Henry I the Bearded, in the campaign between August 1210 and March 1211 could take Lubusz from the Germans, using the confusion after the death of Conrad II (6 May 1210) and the disputes about his heritage among the members of the House of Wettin.

==Conflicts with Archbishop Henry Kietlicz and Władysław Odonic==
The loss of Kalisz, putting into foreign hands, caused a deep dissatisfaction in Władysław Odonic, who considered this land as part of his patrimony. The young prince (at that time around 16 years) managed to gain the support of the Greater Poland nobles and foremost the Archbishop of Gniezno, Henry Kietlicz, who wanted the opportunity to obtain from Spindleshanks privileges for the local Church and thus limit the power of the ruling house.

However, despite the efforts of both Odonic and Archbishop Kietlicz, the rebellion was short-lived and unsuccessful. Both Kietlicz and Władysław Odonic had to flee to the court of Henry I the Bearded. The excommunication launched by Kietlicz against Spindleshanks was from little help to the insurgents, because of the support given to Mieszko III&#x27;s son by Arnold II, Bishop of Poznań.

Somewhat surprising was the reaction to these events by Henry I the Bearded, who not only accepted the exiles, but also endowed Władysław Odonic with the Duchy of Kalisz, however, with the condition to return to him after he regained his inheritance. At the same time, the Archbishop Kietlicz went to Rome, where he had a personal meeting with Pope Innocent III. The protest made to the Holy See successfully blocked the attempt to appeal the curse made by Spindleshanks. The Pope also instructed the other Polish princes to help the Archbishop of Gniezno in returning to his diocese.

==Congress of Głogów and reconciliation with Archbishop Kietlicz==
Henry I the Bearded became a mediator between the warring parties, and on Christmas Day of 1208 he invited the two Greater Poland Dukes, the Archbishop of Gniezno and the Bishops of Wrocław, Lubusz and Poznań to a meeting in Głogów. After long discussions, a settlement was finally reached between Spindleshanks and the Archbishop Kietlicz, who could return to Gniezno with all his goods restored, in exchange for lifting the anathema against the Duke. However, the conflict between uncle and nephew remained unsolved.

==Congress of Borzykowa==
In 1210 Spindleshanks supported the efforts of Mieszko I Tanglefoot, who wanted the restitution of the Testament of Bolesław III Wrymouth, under which the Silesian branch are the rightful overlords of Poland. At this point, Władysław was probably the immediate oldest member of the Piast dynasty after Mieszko I, and therefore, he certainly expect that after the imminent death of the venerable Duke of Racibórz he could receive the title of High Duke and the Duchy of Kraków. However, according to some historians, Henry I the Bearded was older than Spindleshanks. This was most probable, and was reflected in the bull issued by Pope Innocent III on 9 June 1210, where the Holy See demanded the restitution of all the hereditary rights of the Silesian branch according to Bolesław III&#x27;s testament and also excommunicated Leszek I the White; this edict was made by the request of an anonymous &quot;Duke of Silesia&quot;, which could have only been Henry I the Bearded (because Mieszko I used the title of Duke of Raciborz-Opole). The situation became quite confused, as nobody was sure who held the real power.

In July 1210 Leszek I the White, Henry I the Bearded, Konrad I of Masovia and Władysław Odonic met with the local Bishops at the , with the purpose to solve the problematic and mysterious Papal Bull. Mieszko I Tanglefoot wasn&#x27;t present at the meeting; with an army and thanks to the support of the Gryfici family, he could enter in Kraków and easily took Wawel. However, Archbishop Kietlicz didn&#x27;t intend to accept the existing situation, and having received from the young princes and the local Church hierarchy words of support, began his efforts in Rome to withdraw the fateful Bull. These treatments were successful, and when in May 1211 Mieszko I Tanglefoot died, Leszek I the White was able to return to the throne of Kraków. The intentions of the older generation had failed.

==Early rise of Archbishop Kietlicz and Władysław Odonic==
In 1215 Władysław Spindleshanks&#x27; position was further weakened by the growth of the power of Archbishop Henry Kietlicz, who supported the provisions of IV Lateran Council, and the subsequent congress of the Junior princes in Wolbórz, where Leszek I the White, Konrad I of Mazovia, Władysław Odonic and Casimir I of Opole not only agreed to extend the economic and legal benefits for the Church, but also supported the claims of Odonic to obtain his rightful inheritance. Finally, in 1216, in order to avoid an armed confrontation, Spindleshanks gave Odonic the district who previously belonged to his father (the exact territory was a matter of dispute between historians: some believed that Odonic received Southern Greater Poland with the Obra River as frontier, and others consider that the young prince received the entire district of Poznań together with his castle). The agreement between uncle and nephew was confirmed by a Bull of Pope Honorius III issued on 9 February 1217. There has also been an official reconciliation with the Archbishop Kietlicz, who received the privilege from Spindleshanks to receive the revenues from the cistercian monastery of Łekno.

==Fall of Archbishop Kietlicz and the Treaty with Leszek I the White==
The terms of the reconciliation accorded in 1216 lasted less than a year. The proud and ambitious attitude of Archbishop Kietlicz effectively discouraged his supporters and stopped his meddling in Piast Dukes affairs. His importance suffered a further decline after the defeat of the policies of Pope Honorius III.

In 1217 an unexpected treaty was concluded between the previous antagonists Leszek I the White and Władysław Spindleshanks, under which if one or both rulers died without male issue, the other could inherit all his domains. This agreement clearly affected the interests of the Duke of Kalisz Władysław Odonic, Spindleshanks&#x27; nearest male relative.

==Deposition of Władysław Odonic==
In the same year the Duke of Greater Poland took advantage from the benevolent neutrality of Henry I the Bearded and finally decided to resolve the conflict with Odonic and took the district of his nephew, forcing him to flee the country. The formal alliance between Spindleshanks and Henry I the Bearded (similar to the previous agreement with Leszek I the White) took place at the end of 1217 or early 1218, during an assembly in Sądowel, through the mediation of the Bishops Paweł II of Poznań and Wawrzyniec of Lubusz. For unknown reasons, the content of the arrangements was beneficial only to the Duke of Greater Poland, who not only received the permission to retain Odonic&#x27;s district (which included parts of Kalisz, who under the agreement of 1206, was returned to Silesia), but also obtain the district of Lubusz (captured in 1209 by the Margrave of Lusatia Conrad II but recovered by Henry I the Bearded one year later) during his lifetime. The agreement of Sądowel was ratified by a special papal bull issued on 9 May 1218, which further broke down the power of Archbishop Kietlicz.

The first test of the Triumvirate (Władysław III Spindleshanks, Henry I the Bearded and Leszek I the White) was the death in 1219 of Archbishop Henry Kietlicz and the common choice for the post of Archbishop, the chancellor Wincenty z Niałka, one of Spindleshanks&#x27; closest associates.

==Return of Władysław Odonic==
Despite the many benefits of Władysław Spindleshanks received in the congress of Sądowel he didn&#x27;t participate in a national campaign against the pagan Prussians. The reason for this were the actions of his nephew Władysław Odonic, who, thanks to the hospitality and collaboration of Swantopolk II of Pomerania (probably Odonic&#x27;s brother-in-law) began his struggle against the authority of his uncle. The situation worsened when, in October 1223, Odonic surprisingly attacked and managed to conquer the town of Ujście, and soon afterwards (in 1225) the adjacent district of Nakło.

Spindleshanks&#x27; situation became more complicated after the loss of Lubusz in 1225, captured by Louis IV, Landgrave of Thuringia, who took advantage from the constants fights of the Greater Poland Duke with his nephew and could conquer this important territory.

==New phase in the War against Władysław Odonic. Defeat at Ujście==
The decisive battle between uncle and nephew took place in 1227. Spindleshanks sent an army under the command of the voivode Dobrogost besieged Ujście, but he couldn&#x27;t take the strong local fortress, and on 15 July, Odonic surprisingly attacked the voivode, who was completely defeated and killed. Thanks to this victory, Władysław Odonic was able to take control over almost all Greater Poland; however, Odonic&#x27;s ally Swantopolk II unexpectedly broke the existing treaty, took Nakło and proclaimed himself Duke, ended his homage to Leszek I the White.

==Congress of Gąsawa and murder of Leszek I the White==

The alliance of his nephew with the Pomeranian ruler put Spindleshanks&#x27; rule in jeopardy, and he feared that he could lose the remain of his lands; so, he decided to make a pacific solution to his disputes with Odonic. On St. Martin&#x27;s day (11 November) 1227 a solemn congress of Piast rulers, bishops and nobles in the small Kuyavian district of Gąsawa was convened, where this and others delicate issue were discussed in order to take further steps. In addition to the instigator of the reunion, Leszek I the White, were also present his brother Konrad I of Masovia, Henry I the Bearded, Wladyslaw Odonic (whose assistance is disputed by historians), the entire episcopate and numerous representatives of Polish magnate families. For unknown reasons, Władysław Spindleshanks didn&#x27;t appear in Gąsawa, although is believed that both Archbishop Wincenty of Gniezno and Bishop Paweł II of Poznań watched his interests. Nobody expected the tragedy, which occurred on the morning of 24 November: during a short break between the deliberations in the town of Marcinkowo Górne, a group of Pomeranians attacked both Leszek I the White and Henry I the Bearded; Leszek I was killed and Henry I severely wounded, but did survive.

Contemporary sources and later historiography clearly recognize Swantopolk II as the crime&#x27;s author. However, some historians believed that Władysław Odonic was an accomplice, passing all the plans and conversations to the Pomeranian ruler during the congress (according to the most recent work of Tomasz Jurek). Historians speculated that in 1227 the hostility between the Duke of Pomerania and Odonic suddenly appeared after Swantopolk II took Nakło. According to the proponents of the view that Odonic participated in the Gąsawa crime, believed that the capture of Nakło was only a distraction from the true intentions of Swantopolk II and Odonic. There are also other versions from these events, but because of shortage of resources and ambiguity there are several theories. Some historians believe that Władysław Spindleshanks was involved in Leszek I&#x27;s death, because it was him, and not Swantopolk II, who obtain the greatest benefits from the crime. This is though very unlikely, as Władysław was later entrusted with the protection of Leszek&#x27;s son, Bolesław, and the widow duchess Grzymisława wouldn&#x27;t do such a thing as giving her son to her husband&#x27;s murderer.

==Recovery of the Kraków throne==
After the crime of Gąsawa Władysław Spindleshanks turns directly to the offensive. At the beginning of next year and under unknown circumstances, the Duke of Greater Poland, with the help of Silesian troops, could defeat his nephew Odonic, who was taken prisoner. Spindleshanks then went to Lesser Poland, where he present his claim over the throne of Kraków under the basis of the agreement of mutual succession between him and Leszek I the White signed in 1217. Although the Duke of Kraków leave a one-year-old son, Bolesław V, it was clear that until he reached the proper age, the rule over Kraków had to be taken over by someone else. At the same time, Leszek I&#x27;s brother Konrad I of Masovia appears in Lesser Poland and also put his claim over the Kraków throne.

The formal election of the new High Duke of Poland was made at a meeting in Wiślica on 5 May 1228, where most of the powerful nobles gathered around the Bishop of Kraków, Iwo Odrowąż, the voivode Marek z Brzeźnicy, Governor of Kraków and Pakosław the Old, voivode of Sandomierz. There was rejected the candidacy of Konrad I of Masovia in favor of Spindleshanks.

==Congress of Cienia==
The choice of Władysław Spindleshanks as High Duke wasn&#x27;t unconditional choice, because during an assembly organized in Cienia Pierwsza he was compelled to sign two important documents. In the first, the Duke of Greater Poland ensured several privileges to the Church, and even expanded it. The second was about the infant son of Leszek I the White, Bolesław V: the new High Duke took over his guardianship and making him his general heir. At the same time he promised not introduce any new law without the consent of the nobility and clergy of Lesser Poland. In this way, for the first time, the royal power in Poland was made by election. Spindleshanks assumed the direct rule only over Kraków: the authority over Sandomierz was handed by Bolesław V&#x27;s mother Grzymislawa, although formally, because at the end remained under the control of the High Duke.

==Election of Henry I the Bearded as Governor of Krakow==
Unfortunately, the political situation soon turned against Władysław Spindleshanks. His nephew Władysław Odonic, defeated and imprisoned by him, could escape to Płock and resume the war against him, which made the Duke of Greater Poland unable to prepare for the expected invasion against Konrad I of Masovia (who became now an ally of Odonic). Therefore, he decided with the approval of Kraków citizens (led by the powerful families of Odrowąż and Gryfici), to choose Silesian Duke Henry I the Bearded as ruler of the city, but only with the title of governor. Spindleshanks concession was given probably for the military support that Henry I give to him; in addition, the Silesian Duke obtain the promise of inheritance over Greater Poland, which was indeed a violation of the provisions contained in the Congress of Cienia, where Spindleshanks declared that Bolesław V was his heir.

==War against Konrad I of Masovia and Władysław Odonic==
Konrad I&#x27;s military attack on Lesser Poland took place in the summer of 1228. The expedition, however, didn&#x27;t bring success, because he was surprisingly attacked by Prince Henry, eldest son and heir of Henry I the Bearded, who successfully defeated the Masovian Duke in the Battles of Międzyborzem, Skałą and Wrocieryżem. Konrad didn&#x27;t give up and one year later he again started military operations, this time with better results, especially after the capture and imprisonment of Henry I after a supposed meeting in Spytkowice; this event successfully paralyzed the opponents of his late brother Leszek the White and Konrad managed to control most of Lesser Poland, although he released Henry I from captivity thanks to the efforts of his wife Hedwig of Andechs. Immediately, he deprived his nephew Bolesław V from the Duchy of Sandomierz and invested his own son Bolesław with this land. Shortly thereafter, Konrad I and his ally Odonic began the direct war against Spindleshanks. Konrad I unsuccessfully besieged Kalisz, despite the help of Russian troops. Spindleshanks, too busy in his fight against Odonic in the north, couldn&#x27;t came in time to aid the city; however, the powerful city walls were too much for the Silesian Duke, who was forced to withdraw.

==Defeat and escape==
Spindleshanks was soon defeated by his nephew under unknown circumstances, and forced to flee at the court of Duke Casimir I of Opole in Racibórz. The deposition of young Bolesław V by his uncle was the excuse for Henry I to attack the Masovian Duke. Spindleshanks also took advantage of this, and renewed his alliance with the Silesian Duke, with the formally transfer of all his rights over both Greater and Lesser Poland to Henry I.

==Last attempt to recover Greater Poland==
In the spring of 1231 Henry I made his last expedition with Spindleshanks against Władysław Odonic. Despite initial success, thanks to the help gave by Paweł, Bishop of Poznań, and Greater Poland noble families Nałęczów, Łabędziów and Niałków, ended in failure at the walls of Gniezno.

==Mysterious death and succession==
The expedition against his nephew Odonic was the last political activity of Spindleshanks. Following the information of medieval sources, although not properly confirmed by other sources of information, the demise of the former Duke of Greater Poland was under scandalous circumstances. According to the chronicles from the Cistercian French monk Alberic of Trois-Fontaines the almost seventy-years-old Spindleshanks was murdered in Środa Śląska by a German girl whom he tried to rape. According to some historians the story is not about Władysław Laskonogi, but his nephew Władysław Odonic.

Another source who confirm the unworthy conduct of Spindleshanks came from Jan Długosz, who wrote that in the last year of his life his subjects despised him because of his &quot;fornication with prostitutes&quot;.

The date of death of Władysław III Spindleshanks was generally placed on 3 November 1231 (another proposed date, 18 August, was suggested only by Jan Długosz, wasn&#x27;t confirmed, and is rejected by historians).

It is not known where he was buried. Some researchers, based on the information that the Duke died in exile, believes that Władysław III Spindleshanks was buried in Silesia, perhaps in Racibórz. Others, based on late chroniclers, assumes that he was buried in the Benedictine monastery in Lubiń.

At his death, Henry I the Bearded, by virtue of the inheritance treaty, became the main claimant over both Greater and Lesser Poland, but his rights over this areas where soon contested and he had to fight to conquer both.

<text>Jerónimo Lobo (1595 – 29 January 1678) was a Portuguese Jesuit missionary. He took part in the unsuccessful efforts to convert Ethiopia from the native Ethiopian church to Roman Catholicism until the expulsion of the Jesuits in 1643. Afterwards he wrote an account of his time in Ethiopia, , which is an important source for the history and culture of that country.

== Life ==
He was born in Lisbon the third of at least five sons and six daughters to Francisco Lobo da Gama, the Governor of Portuguese Cape Verde, and Maria Brandão de Vasconcelos. He entered the Order of Jesus at the age of 14. In 1621 he was ordained a priest and was ordered as a missionary to India, and after surviving an attack on the fleet carrying him by English and Dutch ships off Portuguese Mozambique a year later, he arrived at Goa in December 1622.
With the intention of proceeding to Ethiopia, whose &quot;Nəgusä nägäst&quot; Susenyos I had been converted to Roman Catholicism by Pedro Páez, he left India in 1624. He struggled to overcome the difficulty that Ethiopia controlled none of the northern coastline, first disembarking at Pate and attempted to reach his destination along the Jubba River through country controlled by the Oromo, but was forced to return. Then in 1625 he set out again, accompanied by Afonso Mendes, the Catholic Patriarch of Ethiopia, and eight missionaries, landing at Beilul, a port on the coast of the Red Sea controlled by the king of Dankali, vassal to the Emperor of Ethiopia. After a month spent crossing the desert into the Ethiopian highlands, the party reached Fremona, where Lobo assumed the responsibilities of superintendent of the missions in Tigray.

His other activities included recovering the remains of Cristóvão da Gama, who had been captured and executed by Ahmad ibn Ibrihim al-Ghazi in 1542, at the request of his great nephew Francisco da Gama, Conde da Vidigueira and Governor-general of India. He also served as a missionary to the southwest of Lake Tana, where he visited the source of the Blue Nile in 1629.

The abdication of Emperor Susenyos (1632) deprived the Catholics of their protector; his successor, Fasilides, first confined them once again at Fremona, then in 1634 Lobo and his companions were exiled from Ethiopia, who were exposed to robbery, assaults and other indignities by the local population before reaching the Ottoman Naib at Massawa. He sent them to his superior at Suakin, where the Pasha forced the party to pay a ransom before they could proceed to India. Despite settling for a ransom of 4300 patacas (which he borrowed from local Banyan merchants), at the last moment the Pasha insisted on keeping Patriarch Mendes and three other senior priests for further money.

Once Lobo reached Diu, he left for Goa by canoe, arriving at the provincial capital on 8 December 1634. There he attempted to convince viceroy Miguel de Noronha, conde de Linhares to send an armament to the Red Sea to capture Suakin and Massawa, free the patriarch by force, and restore Catholicism to Ethiopia. Although the Viceroy was willing to make a punitive expedition against Suakin to free the Patriarch, he did not want to overextend Portuguese forces and garrison either port. Unwilling to settle for just freeing the patriarch, Lobo embarked for Portugal, and after he had been shipwrecked on the coast of Natal, then captured by pirates, he arrived at Lisbon. Neither at this city, however, nor at Madrid and Rome, was any approval given to Lobo&#x27;s plan.

He accordingly returned to India in 1640, and was elected rector, and afterwards provincial, of the Jesuits at Goa. After some years he returned to his native city, where he died.

==Writings==

A number of Lobo&#x27;s writings have survived. He entered into a correspondence with Henry Oldenburg of the Royal Society concerning the source of the Nile, which likely led to the publication in London of a little book entitled &quot;A Short Relation of the River Nile, of its source and current; of its overflowing the campagnia of Ægypt, until it runs into the Mediterranean and of other curiosities: written by an eye-witnesse, who lived many years in the chief kingdoms of the Abyssine Empire. Translated by Sir Peter Wyche&quot;.

Gabriel Pereira reported in 1903 that he had found three short works in manuscript by Lobo in the library of the Duke of Palmela, and in 1966 Fr. Manuel Gonçalves da Costa discovered in the Ajuda library at Lisbon another short work of Lobo, &quot;Breve Notícia e Relação de Algumas Cousas Certas não vulgares, e dignas de se saberem, escritas e&quot; [sic] &quot;instância de Curiosos&quot;, which repeated the topics of &quot;A Short Relation&quot;.

His best known work is his memoirs of the years 1622-1640, which cover his voyage to India, his experiences in Ethiopia, and his journey back to Portugal; his &quot;Itinerário&quot;, however, was not published during his lifetime. Baltasar Teles made large use of Lobo&#x27;s writing in his &quot;História geral da Ethiópia a Alta&quot; (Coimbra, 1660), often erroneously attributed to Lobo, but incorporated much from Manuel de Almeida&#x27;s manuscript work. Lobo&#x27;s own narrative was translated from a copy owned by the Count of Ericeira by the Abbé Joachim le Grand into French in 1728, under the title of &quot;Voyage historique d&#x27;Abissinie&quot;. An English abridgement of Le Grand&#x27;s edition by Dr. Samuel Johnson was published in 1735 (reprinted 1789).

Fr. da Costa discovered another manuscript of Lobo&#x27;s work in the Biblioteca Pública at Braga in 1947. This was not the same manuscript that le Grand translated; both were copies, with variations, of the original autograph left at the Casa de São Roque at the time of Lobo&#x27;s death. The whole of this manuscript was translated by Donald M. Lockhart, and published with an introduction and notes by C.F. Beckingham by the Hakluyt Society in 1984.

<doc id="857780" wikidata="Q5380783" url="?curid=857780" title="Entropic uncertainty">
<text>In quantum mechanics, information theory, and Fourier analysis, the entropic uncertainty or Hirschman uncertainty is defined as the sum of the temporal and spectral Shannon entropies. It turns out that Heisenberg&#x27;s uncertainty principle can be expressed as a lower bound on the sum of these entropies. This is &quot;stronger&quot; than the usual statement of the uncertainty principle in terms of the product of standard deviations.

In 1957, Hirschman considered a function &quot;f&quot; and its Fourier transform &quot;g&quot; such that
:formula_1
where the &quot;≈&quot; indicates convergence in 2, and normalized so that (by Plancherel&#x27;s theorem),
:formula_2
He showed that for any such functions the sum of the Shannon entropies is non-negative,
:formula_3

A tighter bound,

was conjectured by Hirschman and Everett, proven in 1975 by W. Beckner and in the same year interpreted as a generalized quantum mechanical uncertainty principle by Białynicki-Birula and Mycielski.
The equality holds in the case of Gaussian distributions.
Note, however, that the above entropic uncertainty function is distinctly &quot;different&quot; from the quantum Von Neumann entropy represented in phase space.

==Sketch of proof==
The proof of this tight inequality depends on the so-called (&quot;q&quot;, &quot;p&quot;)-norm of the Fourier transformation. (Establishing this norm is the most difficult part of the proof.)

From this norm, one is able to establish a lower bound on the sum of the (differential) Rényi entropies, , where , which generalize the Shannon entropies. For simplicity, we consider this inequality only in one dimension; the extension to multiple dimensions is straightforward and can be found in the literature cited.

===Babenko–Beckner inequality===
The (&quot;q&quot;, &quot;p&quot;)-norm of the Fourier transform is defined to be

:formula_4 where formula_5   and formula_6

In 1961, Babenko found this norm for &quot;even&quot; integer values of &quot;q&quot;. Finally, in 1975,
using Hermite functions as eigenfunctions of the Fourier transform, Beckner proved that the value of this norm (in one dimension) for all &quot;q&quot; ≥ 2 is
:formula_7
Thus we have the Babenko–Beckner inequality that
:formula_8

===Rényi entropy bound===
From this inequality, an expression of the uncertainty principle in terms of the Rényi entropy can be derived.

Let formula_9 so that formula_10 and formula_11, we have
:formula_12
Squaring both sides and taking the logarithm, we get
:formula_13

We can rewrite the condition on formula_14 as

:formula_15 

Assume formula_16, then we multiply both sides by the negative 
:formula_17 
to get
:formula_18

Rearranging terms yields an inequality in terms of the sum of Rényi entropies,
:formula_19
:formula_20

====Right-hand side====

:formula_21

:formula_22

:formula_23

:formula_24

:formula_25

:formula_26

:formula_27

===Shannon entropy bound===
Taking the limit of this last inequality as formula_28 and the substitutions formula_29 yields the less general Shannon entropy inequality,
:formula_30
valid for any base of logarithm, as long as we choose an appropriate unit of information, bit, nat, etc.

The constant will be different, though, for a different normalization of the Fourier transform, (such as is usually used in physics, with normalizations chosen so that &quot;ħ&quot;=1 ), i.e.,
:formula_31
In this case, the dilation of the Fourier transform absolute squared by a factor of 2 simply adds log(2) to its entropy.

==Entropy versus variance bounds==
The Gaussian or normal probability distribution plays an important role in the relationship between variance and entropy: it is a problem of the calculus of variations to show that this distribution maximizes entropy for a given variance, and at the same time minimizes the variance for a given entropy. In fact, for any probability density function formula_32 on the real line, Shannon&#x27;s entropy inequality specifies:
:formula_33
where &quot;H&quot; is the Shannon entropy and &quot;V&quot; is the variance, an inequality that is saturated only in the case of a normal distribution.

Moreover, the Fourier transform of a Gaussian probability amplitude function is also Gaussian—and the absolute squares of both of these are Gaussian, too. This can then be used to derive the usual Robertson variance uncertainty inequality from the above entropic inequality, enabling &quot;the latter to be tighter than the former&quot;. That is (for &quot;ħ&quot;=1), exponentiating the Hirschman inequality and using Shannon&#x27;s expression above, 
:formula_34

Hirschman explained that entropy—his version of entropy was the negative of Shannon&#x27;s—is a &quot;measure of the concentration of [a probability distribution] in a set of small measure.&quot; Thus &quot;a low or large negative Shannon entropy means that a considerable mass of the probability distribution is confined to a set of small measure&quot;.

Note that this set of small measure need not be contiguous; a probability distribution can have several concentrations of mass in intervals of small measure, and the entropy may still be low no matter how widely scattered those intervals are. This is not the case with the variance: variance measures the concentration of mass about the mean of the distribution, and a low variance means that a considerable mass of the probability distribution is concentrated in a &quot;contiguous interval&quot; of small measure.

To formalize this distinction, we say that two probability density functions formula_35 and formula_36 are equimeasurable if

:formula_37
where is the Lebesgue measure. Any two equimeasurable probability density functions have the same Shannon entropy, and in fact the same Rényi entropy, of any order. The same is not true of variance, however. Any probability density function has a radially decreasing equimeasurable &quot;rearrangement&quot; whose variance is less (up to translation) than any other rearrangement of the function; and there exist rearrangements of arbitrarily high variance, (all having the same entropy.)

<text>The Railway Guarantee Act was introduced in the Parliament of the Province of Canada by Finance Minister Francis Hincks, who was also the President of the Great Western Railway of Canada. The Act encountered little opposition during the course of its passage, despite the prevailing depression.

It empowered the Government to guarantee the interest on loans to be raised by any railway chartered by the Legislature for the construction of any line at least 75 miles long within the Province, provided that:

#the rate of interest guaranteed did not exceed 6%
#the sum on which the interest was guaranteed did not exceed the amount expended before the guarantee was given, and should be sufficient to complete the construction in a fitting manner (provided that no such guarantee would be given until at least half the line was completed)
#the payment of the interest guaranteed would be the first charge on the tolls and profits of the company
#no dividend could be declared so long as any part of the interest remained unpaid
#so long as any of the principal on which interest was guaranteed remained unpaid, no dividend could be declared to the stockholders until an amount equal to 3% of the principal was paid into a sinking fund to be managed by the Province and used for the eventual redemption of the bonds
#the Province held the first charge upon the road, tolls and profits of the company for any sum paid or guaranteed

The Province could demand further conditions with respect to a specific guarantee.

Provision was also made for financial support to be given to plans being discussed for the construction of the future Intercolonial Railway.

In 1851, access to guarantees was restricted to the Main Trunk Line (later to be called Grand Trunk Railway), together with ones already granted to the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad, the Great Western Railway and the Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Railway.

<text>In theoretical physics, the Scherk–Schwarz mechanism (named after Joël Scherk and John Henry Schwarz) for a field φ basically means that φ is a section of a non-trivializable fiber bundle (not necessarily a vector bundle since φ needn&#x27;t be linear) which is fixed by the model. This is called a &quot;twist&quot; by physicists.

Note that this can never occur in a spacetime which is homeomorphic to Rn, which is a contractible space. 
However, for Kaluza–Klein theories, the Scherk–Schwarz mechanism is a possibility which can&#x27;t be neglected.</text><links>

<doc id="857794" wikidata="Q6184482" url="?curid=857794" title="Jerry Stahl">
<text>Jerry Stahl (born September 28, 1953) is an American novelist and screenwriter. His works include the 1995 memoir of addiction &quot;Permanent Midnight&quot;. A 1998 film adaptation followed with Ben Stiller in the lead role.

His works include memoirs, short stories, TV, films, and Novels. He wrote novels including &quot;Bad Sex On Speed&quot; (2013), &quot;Happy Mutant Baby Pills: A Novel&quot; (2013), and a short story &quot;Love Without: Stories&quot; (2007).

Stahl has worked extensively in film and television. He married Zoe Hansen on August 20, 2023.

==Early life==
Stahl grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. His family is Jewish. His father, David Henry Stahl, immigrated to the United States from the Soviet Union; he served a term as Attorney General of Pennsylvania and was later appointed as a federal judge. David had previously worked as a coal miner.

At the age of 16, Stahl was sent to a boarding prep school near Philadelphia. He attended Columbia University. Post-college he traveled, living in Greece—in caves outside of Matala, on Crete, the streets of Paris, then London, where he landed a job as a bartender at an Irish pub. He later returned to America to live in New York City, where he became a writer.

==Career==
Stahl began publishing short fiction, won a Pushcart Prize in 1976 for a story that first appeared in Transatlantic Review, and made a living writing for magazines and doing porn stories for cash. One writing job as humor editor for &quot;Hustler&quot; meant moving to Columbus, Ohio and living at the YMCA until the magazine moved its headquarters to California. Stahl lost his job six months to the day after taking it and ended up on unemployment in California, alongside an escalating heroin dependency, which eventually led to his contracting hepatitis C.

He would go on to become a writer for the 1980s TV series &quot;ALF&quot;, &quot;Thirtysomething&quot;, and &quot;Moonlighting&quot;. In 1990 he would also write an episode each for &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; and &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;; his work on the former was described by series co-creator Mark Frost as &quot;an absolute car wreck... He turned in a completely incomprehensible, unusable, incomplete script a few days late and as I recall there were blood stains on it.&quot; He has also acted in seven films.

&quot;Permanent Midnight&quot;, his 1995 memoir, was adapted by Stahl into a 1998 film of the same name starring Ben Stiller that raised Stahl&#x27;s profile and set the stage for his ongoing work in film. He wrote the screenplay for &quot;Bad Boys II&quot;, which starred Will Smith and Martin Lawrence. His novels &quot;Perv: A Love Story&quot; and &quot;Plainclothes Naked&quot; enjoyed moderate success. &quot;I, Fatty&quot;, a fictional autobiography of legendary movie comedian Roscoe Arbuckle received a favorable review from Thomas Mallon in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and attracted attention from a variety of national media. According to Stahl, Johnny Depp has optioned the film rights for &quot;I, Fatty&quot;. Stahl edited &quot;The Heroin Chronicles&quot; (Akashic Books 2013), a collection of stories by various authors.

Stahl has also written a number of &quot;&quot; episodes which deal with transgressive topics and have been some of the most controversial but also gained some of the highest ratings. He introduced the dominatrix character Lady Heather, who has appeared in a number of episodes, the first of which, &quot;Slaves of Las Vegas&quot;, featured viewer discretion advisory warning, due to nudity and sexual content. Stahl has been criticised for his inaccurate portrayal of furries in &quot;Fur and Loathing&quot;. However, while earlier episodes of CSI had been criticised for the treatment of transgender people, his episode &quot;Ch-Ch-Changes&quot; was highlighted as offering a sensitive portrayal of the topic. It also got the largest audience to date, 31.5 million, with his &quot;&quot; being the second most watched that season. That episode dealt with infantilism and the Parents Television Council declared it was the worst television show of the week.

Stahl and Barbara Turner wrote a screenplay for an HBO film about Ernest Hemingway and his relationship with Martha Gellhorn entitled &quot;Hemingway &amp; Gellhorn&quot; starring Clive Owen and Nicole Kidman. James Gandolfini served as executive producer to the film, which was directed by Philip Kaufman and first aired on HBO on May 28, 2012.

<text>Kenneth Gene Caminiti (April 21, 1963 – October 10, 2004) was an American professional baseball third baseman who spent 15 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Houston Astros (1987–1994, 1999–2000), San Diego Padres (1995–1998), Texas Rangers (2001) and Atlanta Braves (2001).

Caminiti was named the National League Most Valuable Player (NL MVP) with San Diego in 1996, and he was a three-time MLB All-Star. Caminiti is a member of the Astros Hall of Fame and Padres Hall of Fame. He died of a cocaine and heroin (a &quot;speedball&quot;) drug overdose on October 10, 2004.

==Early years==
Caminiti was born in Hanford, California, on April 21, 1963, to Yvonne and Lee Caminiti who had another son, Glenn, and a daughter, Carrie. He starred in football and baseball at Leigh High School in San Jose, California, where he graduated in 1981. In football, he was invited to many all-star games after his senior football season. He attended San Jose State University, where he played baseball for the Spartans in 1983 and 1984.

==Baseball career==

===Minor leagues===
The Houston Astros selected Caminiti in the third round of the 1984 MLB draft. Caminiti played professional baseball for 15 seasons, beginning with the Osceola Astros of the Single-A Florida State League in . He was promoted to the Double-A Columbus Astros in 1986, and batted .300 for the first time in his professional career. He returned to Columbus in 1987, improving to a .325 batting average, hitting 15 home runs over 95 games and making the Southern League All-Star game. He also played third base for the Indios de Mayagüez along with Wally Joyner in the Puerto Rico Winter League.

===Houston Astros (1987–1994)===
Skipping Triple-A, Caminiti was called up and made his major league debut at age 24 with the Houston Astros on July 16, 1987. In his debut, he went 2-for-3 with a home run, a triple, and scored the game-winning run. He immediately received a large role, starting 51 of the Astros&#x27; final 75 games at third base. However, in , Denny Walling, whom Caminiti had largely replaced the previous season, was named the Astros starting third baseman, and Caminiti started the season in the minors, playing with the Triple-A Tucson Toros of the Pacific Coast League. Despite an injury forcing Walling to the disabled list in mid-June, the Astros did not call up Caminiti, instead trading for the veteran Buddy Bell. Further injuries in late July forced the Astros to shift Bell to first base in late July, and Caminiti was brought up to play at third base. However, Caminiti struggled, batting only .176 over three weeks, and was demoted again, only returning for September call-ups, and ended the season with a .181 batting average over 89 plate appearances.

Prior to 1989, the Astros&#x27; new manager Art Howe announced that Caminiti would be the starting third baseman. Despite being plagued with several injuries throughout his tenure in Houston, Caminiti became a constant presence at third base over the next six seasons, averaging .263 with 12 home runs and 69 RBIs from 1989 to 1994. During this time, he formed part of the nucleus of the Astros offense alongside future Hall of Famers Jeff Bagwell and Craig Biggio, plus Steve Finley and Luis Gonzalez (both of whom ended their careers with over 2500 hits and 300 home runs). Caminiti&#x27;s Astros improved their record each year from 1991 to 1994. In the strike-shortened 1994 season, he set a new career high with 18 home runs, and earned his first All Star Game selection.

=== San Diego Padres (1995–1998) ===
After the season, Caminiti was traded by the Astros, in part to cut payroll and get younger, to the San Diego Padres in a 12-player trade (the biggest trade in terms of number of players moved since 1957), along with Steve Finley, Andújar Cedeño, Roberto Petagine, Brian Williams, and a player to be named later (PTBNL), in exchange for Derek Bell, Doug Brocail, Ricky Gutiérrez, Pedro Martínez, Phil Plantier, and Craig Shipley. In 1995, at the age of 32, he reached career highs at the plate by hitting .302 with 26 home runs and 94 RBIs in his first season for the Padres, winning his first of three consecutive Gold Glove Awards. The switch-hitting Caminiti also became the first player to ever have three games with a home run from each side of the plate, remarkably having entirely done so over a single four-game span.

In , Caminiti again set new career highs, batting .326 with 40 home runs and 130 RBIs (which remains the Padres&#x27; single season RBI record). He carried the Padres that year despite a myriad of injuries, such as an abdominal strain, a biceps tendon tear, shoulder and elbow injuries, and pain in his back, hamstring, and groin. One highlight of the season was the August 18 game against the Mets in Monterrey, Mexico, which saw him play with dehydration and diarrhea. With liters of intravenous fluid received alongside a Snickers bar, Caminiti hit two home runs in the victory over the Mets. In spite of Caminiti&#x27;s three home runs, the Padres were swept by the St. Louis Cardinals in three games in the NLDS. Despite playing most of 1996 with a torn right rotator cuff, his performance earned him his second All-Star Game appearance, and he became the fifth player to be unanimously voted the National League Most Valuable Player. He dropped off slightly in 1997, but remained productive, batting .290 with 26 home runs and 90 RBIs, and was voted the National League&#x27;s starting third baseman for the All Star Game. Injuries took their toll, and Caminiti&#x27;s batting average fell to .252 in , though he maintained his power numbers. This season saw Caminiti make the World Series for the only time in his career, where the Padres were swept by a juggernaut New York Yankees team that had won a then-AL record 114 regular season games. He had two hits in the series and batted .143.

=== Return to Astros and end of career (1999–2001) ===
After 1998, the Padres did not attempt to re-sign the free agent eligible Caminiti in a cost-saving move. Despite reportedly being offered more money by the Detroit Tigers, Caminiti returned to Houston on a $9.5 million contract with an option for a third year at $5.5 million. Astros GM Gerry Hunsicker endorsed the signing, describing Caminiti as &quot;the ultimate gamer.&quot; While he remained productive, injuries limited Caminiti to 137 games with the Astros between 1999 and 2000. In the 1999 National League Division Series against Atlanta and batted .471 with three of his eight hits being home runs. He drove in eight of Houston&#x27;s total 15 runs in the four-game series loss to the Braves. His season was ended by a wrist injury in mid-June, and Caminiti left the team in early September to enter a substance abuse rehabilitation center.

Before the season, Caminiti signed for $3.25 million with the Texas Rangers, where he hit just .232 over the first three months of the season. He requested his release from the Rangers, which was granted on July 2. Three days later, he signed with the Atlanta Braves, who moved him across the infield due to the presence of Chipper Jones, and attempted to use Caminiti as a power-hitting first baseman. Over 64 games with the Braves, Caminiti batted only .222 with six home runs.

===Awards===
Caminiti won three Gold Glove Awards while playing for the Padres in , , and , and he was unanimously selected as the National League&#x27;s MVP in 1996. In , 1996, and 1997, he appeared in the All Star Game. Caminiti is the Padres all-time leader in slugging percentage (.540) and OPS (.924).

In 2016, Caminiti was inducted into the San Diego Padres Hall of Fame. He will be inducted into the Houston Astros Hall of Fame in August 2024.

==Post-baseball career==
Following his playing career in baseball, Caminiti was hired by the Padres to be a spring training instructor for his former team. Caminiti entered into a partnership with actor Jason Gedrick and hockey player Mario Lemieux to open a cigar bar called Ashes Cigar Club on Wall Street.

==Personal life==
Caminiti was married to Nancy Smith from November 14, 1987, to December 10, 2002. They had three daughters, Kendall, Lindsey, and Nicole. His cousin, Cam Caminiti, was drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the first round of the 2024 Major League Baseball draft.

==Substance abuse and death==
Caminiti struggled with substance abuse throughout his career, as he had started drinking alcohol in middle school and smoking marijuana in high school. He started using cocaine later on, but his main vice by 1990 was crack cocaine. He admitted in to having a problem with alcoholism and checked himself into a rehabilitation center in . In a &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; cover story in , a year after his retirement, Caminiti admitted that he had used steroids during his 1996 MVP season, and for several seasons afterwards. His admitted steroid abuse was discussed in the 2007 Mitchell Report on steroid abuse in baseball.

Caminiti also had a long struggle with cocaine, having been arrested in March 2001 for possession and sentenced to probation. In February 2003, Caminiti tested positive for cocaine while already on probation for cocaine possession and was ordered to visit a Texas Department of Criminal Justice-operated treatment program. The program was eliminated in May of that year and Caminiti was forced to leave after completing most of the program. Caminiti was also getting mental health therapy from the MLB&#x27;s Employee Assistance Program, owing to childhood trauma from sexual abuse in middle school. He had recounted to others participating in rehab sessions that he believed this abuse was the driving force behind his substance use (serving as a way to try to turn his mind off from the memories).

On October 5, 2004 — just five days prior to his death — he admitted in a Houston court that he had violated his probation. He tested positive for cocaine in September 2004. It was his fourth such violation and he was sentenced to 180 days in jail but given credit for time already served and released.

===Death===
In the early afternoon of October 10, 2004, Caminiti was in the apartment of a friend in the Bronx, New York City. After being in the bathroom to have a speedball of cocaine and heroin, Caminiti came out and collapsed on the floor. At 3:36 pm, a 911 call was made while Caminiti was going into cardiac arrest. Caminiti died at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx at 6:45 pm. Preliminary news reports indicated he died of a heart attack, but the autopsy results stated that &quot;acute intoxication due to the combined effects of cocaine and opiates&quot; caused his death, with coronary artery disease and cardiac hypertrophy (an enlarged heart) as contributing factors.

After final funeral services held in Solana Beach, California, a San Diego suburb, which were attended by many Padres players, past and present, Caminiti&#x27;s remains were cremated and were interred at the Cambo Ranch in Sabinal, Texas, which Caminiti co-owned with former teammate Craig Biggio. Media coverage of Caminiti&#x27;s death was almost completely overshadowed by that of Christopher Reeve, who also died in New York on the same day.

<doc id="857819" wikidata="Q621794" url="?curid=857819" title="Cape Spear">
<text>Cape Spear () is a headland located on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland near St. John&#x27;s in the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador. At a longitude of 52°37&#x27;W, it is the easternmost point in Canada and North America, excluding Greenland.

Cape Spear is within the municipal boundaries of the city of St. John&#x27;s, located about from downtown St. John&#x27;s.

The Portuguese named this location , meaning &quot;cape of hope&quot;, which became in French and finally &quot;Cape Spear&quot;.

Cape Spear is the trailhead/trail end for two components of the East Coast Trail.

==History==
The Cape Spear region was originally inhabited by Beothuk peoples. Additionally, Mi&#x27;kmaq communities practiced a non-sedentary presence in the area, harvesting subsistence resources on a temporary basis prior to permanent residency at settlements such as St. George&#x27;s Bay and Conne River from the nineteenth century onwards. In contrast to European settlers who viewed the cape as a place of significance as the easternmost point in Canada, there is no known archaeological evidence to indicate that Cape Spear was viewed by local Indigenous communities as a place of symbolic geographical importance. According to Fife and Roseman, historically there are &quot;no indications that either the Beothuk or the Mi&#x27;kmaq equated Cape Spear with a &#x27;land&#x27;s end&#x27; that was meaningful to them.&quot;

===World War II===

Because of its proximity to convoy routes during the Second World War, a Canadian-manned gun battery including two Lend-Lease ex-US 10-inch M1888 guns on disappearing carriages was installed at Cape Spear to defend the entrance to St. John&#x27;s harbor. Barracks and underground passages leading to the bunkers were built for the use of troops stationed there. The gun barrels remain in place. The bunkers and gun barrels that are located at the site afford a sheltered view of the ocean.

==Lighthouses==
A lighthouse has operated at Cape Spear since September 1836. The original Cape Spear lighthouse was the second lighthouse built in Newfoundland; the first was built in 1810 at Fort Amherst, at the entrance to St. John&#x27;s Harbour. In 1832, the first legislative assembly for the colony created a lighthouse board. Cape Spear was chosen as the site for a new lighthouse because it was on the rocky eastern coast near the entrance to St. John&#x27;s harbor.

Nicholas Croke and William Parker, two St. John&#x27;s builders, won the contract for the lighthouse and work began in 1834 or early in 1835. The first lighthouse was a square wooden building with a tower in the middle containing the light. A foghorn was added in 1878. The first light used at Cape Spear had already been used since 1815 at a lighthouse on Inchkeith on the east coast of Scotland. The original light used seven Argand burners and curved reflectors. This was later replaced by a dioptric lens system; the light was first lit by oil, then acetylene, and finally electricity in 1930.

A new concrete lighthouse was built in 1955, and the original light was moved to the new building.

===Lightkeepers===
In 1835, dense fog enveloped an approaching warship carrying a VIP visitor to St. John&#x27;s. The Governor sent out several pilot boats, and a young harbour pilot names James Cantwell succeeded in locating the ship and guiding it safely into harbour. Asked what reward he would like, he requested the job of keeper at the Cape Spear lighthouse, then under construction. It had been promised to another man, Emmanuel Warre, but when Warre died ten years later Cantwell became the second keeper. He served for 35 years; his son Dennis, who had been his assistant, later took over and, with two intermissions, the Cantwell family kept the Cape Spear light for over 150 years.

===National Historic Site===
The original Cape Spear lighthouse is the oldest surviving lighthouse in Newfoundland and the location has been designated a National Historic Site of Canada. The original lighthouse building and the lightkeeper&#x27;s residence have been restored to the period of 1839, and are open to the public. The visitor centre includes a gift shop. The lighthouse was designated under the federal &quot;Heritage Lighthouse Protection Act&quot; in June 2016.

Some visitors attracted by the scenery and history have been swept away by the large and unpredictable waves at Cape Spear, prompting Parks Canada to post numerous warning signs in the area.

==Radar Station==
Cape Spear Radar Station (&quot;Prime&quot;) was a United States Army General Surveillance Ground Radar Early Warning Station in the Dominion of Newfoundland. It was built during World War II and responsible for monitoring air traffic from RCAF Torbay and into the Atlantic Ocean. It was closed in 1945.

The site was established in 1942 as a United States Ground Radar Early Warning Station, funded by the United States Army, which stationed the 685th Air Warning Company on the site under operational control of Newfoundland Base Command at Pepperrell Air Force Base. Three officers and 49 enlisted men of the 685th were assigned to Cape Spear. It operated an SCR-271 manned Early-warning radar with information sent to a plotting center at Pepperrell AFB to track aircraft. The station was assigned to Royal Canadian Air Force in November 1944, and was given designation &quot;No 42 RU&quot;. The RCAF operated the station until 20 June, 1945.

<doc id="857820" wikidata="Q3567155" url="?curid=857820" title="Welcome to Sunny Florida">
<text>Welcome to Sunny Florida is the name of a DVD and CD set released by singer-songwriter Tori Amos in 2004. The set features a live concert performance by Amos from her 2002 &quot; On Scarlet&#x27;s Walk&quot; tour, in support of her album Scarlet&#x27;s Walk. It was recorded live at Sound Advice Amphitheatre in West Palm Beach, Florida. The DVD also features photographs and other exclusive material including a full-length interview with Amos. The title is a sarcastic reference to the fact that on September 4, 2003 (the day of filming) there was a rainstorm.

Accompanying the DVD is an EP called &quot;Scarlet&#x27;s Hidden Treasures&quot;, which features six non-LP tracks. The DVD/CD was released in either a double CD jewel case, or in a special DVD case.

Some controversy was sparked when the words &quot;fucker&quot; and &quot;cock&quot; were censored out of the live performance of the song &quot;Professional Widow&quot;. Amos, who is an avid anti-censorship proponent, explained in an interview that she felt it was important not to have a parental advisory sticker on the label so that young people would be able to have access to the DVD, as she touches on many important political issues in her works.

Although not mentioned in the track listing, Amos sings the first four lines of &quot;Muhammad My Friend&quot; as a bridge for &quot;Take to the Sky&quot;.

The set reached UK No. 1 on the Music Videos and DVDs Chart, and No. 2 on the US equivalent, qualifying it as a commercial success.

<doc id="857821" wikidata="Q7551661" url="?curid=857821" title="Socialist Party of Canada (Manitoba)">
<text>The Socialist Party of Manitoba (SPM) was a short-lived social democratic political party launched in 1902 in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The organisation advanced a moderate programme of social reform legislation. In 1904 the SPM became one of the constituent units founding the Socialist Party of Canada, an organisation which continued until 1925.

==Establishment==

The Socialist Party of Manitoba was established in 1902. Although professing a long-term objective of &quot;socialisation of the means of Production, Distribution, and Exchange,&quot; in practice it followed the Fabian agenda of slow, incremental social legislation — a modest programme characterised by one historian as &quot;pure reformist labourism.&quot; In one Winnipeg city election the SPM&#x27;s candidate ran for office as a self-professed &#x27;Labour Candidate&#x27; without so much as mentioning the word &#x27;socialism&#x27; during the duration of the campaign.

Included among the planks of the SPM&#x27;s ameliorative reform programme were demands for universal suffrage, direct legislation, abolition of standing armies, implementation of the 8-hour day, establishment of old age pensions, and implementation of compulsory public education.

Located in a largely rural province, the SPM had a small membership almost entirely contained in the city of Winnipeg.

==Socialist Party of Canada in Manitoba==

The Socialist Party of Canada was a revolutionary Marxist organization, founded in 1904 as a merger of the Socialist Party of British Columbia and related groups in Manitoba and Ontario, Canada. Although strongest in British Columbia, the SPC was also a credible force in Winnipeg. One member of the party was elected to the Manitoba legislature in the 1920 provincial election.

During its early years, the Winnipeg SPC was a rival to larger reformist groups such as Arthur Puttee&#x27;s Winnipeg Labour Party, from which many Socialists members had split. It was active in the local trade unions, and participated in the city&#x27;s elections.

The party ran John Donald Houston in Winnipeg for the federal election of 1908. He finished third, behind the Liberal and Conservative candidates.

In the 1910 provincial election, the SPC ran candidates in three of Winnipeg&#x27;s four ridings. They finished a distant third in all three, but may have been responsible for the defeat of reformist Manitoba Labour Party candidate Fred Dixon in Winnipeg Centre. Dixon&#x27;s loss provoked a backlash against the SPC from Winnipeg&#x27;s labour unions, weakening the party. Many of its members joined the newly formed Social Democratic Party of Canada, which became stronger in Winnipeg than any other city in western Canada.

In the 1914 provincial election, the SPC ran George Armstrong and Bill Hoop for the two Winnipeg Centre seats, but did not challenge the SDP in Winnipeg North. Both SPC candidates finished a distant third in their ridings. Armstrong ran against Dixon, but could not prevent his election as an independent.

The SPC was further marginalized in the 1915 provincial election. Its only candidate was Armstrong, who again placed third against Dixon. Subsequent events, however, would briefly revive the party&#x27;s fortunes in the city.

In 1919, the city of Winnipeg was shaken by a General Strike which pitted unionized and non-unionized workers against the city&#x27;s employers. The strike was suppressed by force, but labour radicalism within the city was greatly increased. There were increased calls for labour unity in the city. For the 1920 provincial election, the SPC, SDP and reformist labour parties forged an electoral alliance to contest Winnipeg&#x27;s ten seats (which were determined by a single transferable ballot). The labour list received more votes than any other party, and elected four candidates to the Legislature. Armstrong was elected, along with three candidates from the other parties.

The 1920 election proved to be the party&#x27;s greatest success in Manitoba. In 1921, the SPC lost many of its members to the newly formed Workers Party (which was the legal wing of the Communist Party of Canada) and ceased to function as a viable organization. Armstrong ran again as an SPC candidate in the 1922 election, and was frequently heckled by Workers Party candidates for his alliance with the reformist Independent Labour Party. Armstrong was defeated, and the party formally dissolved in 1925.

==Recreated Socialist Party of Canada==

Armstrong resurfaced as an SPC candidate in the 1932 provincial election, but fared poorly. The party does not appear to have functioned in the city for long after the election.

In 1945, a recreated SPC ran James Milne in Winnipeg for Manitoba&#x27;s provincial election. Milne claimed that neither the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation nor the Labor-Progressive Party was serious about eroding capitalism and poverty. He was defeated, and the party does not appear to have participated in any further Manitoba elections.

==Candidates of the Socialist Party of Canada in Manitoba==

1910 provincial election:

* W.S. Cummings (Winnipeg Centre) — Cummings was nominated by the SPC as a spoiler candidate in Winnipeg Centre, opposing Fred Dixon who was backed by the Manitoba Liberal Party and the Manitoba Labour Representation Committee. Dixon&#x27;s supporters alleged that the Conservative were assisting his campaign, and historian Ross McCormack has indicated there may have been some truth to this charge. Cummings finished a distant third with 99 votes (2.44%). Conservative candidate Thomas Taylor defeated Dixon by 73 votes. The SPC was blamed for Dixon&#x27;s loss, and became marginalized in Winnipeg&#x27;s labour community until 1919. Little is known of Cummings, aside from the fact that he contested this election.

<text>A snow cone (or snow kone, sno kone, sno-kone, sno cone, or sno-cone) is a variation of shaved ice or ground-up ice desserts commonly served in paper cones or foam cups. The dessert consists of ice shavings that are topped with flavored sugar syrup.

Depending on the region of North America, the terms &quot;snowball&quot;, “ice cone” and &quot;snow cone&quot; may refer to different things. Where the distinction is made, the former refers to a dessert made of finely shaved ice (&quot;like soft fresh snow&quot;), while the latter contains ground-up ice that is coarser and more granular (&quot;crunchy&quot;).

==History==
===Industrial Revolution===
In the 1850s, the American Industrial Revolution made ice commercially available in the United States. Ice houses in New York would commonly sell ice to states like Florida. To transport the ice to Florida, the ice houses would send a wagon with a huge block of ice south. The route to Florida would pass right through Baltimore where children would run up to the wagon and ask for a small scraping of ice. Before long, mothers started to make flavoring in anticipation of their children receiving some ice. The first flavor the women made is still a Baltimore favorite: egg custard. Egg custard was an easy flavor to make as the only ingredients were eggs, vanilla, and sugar.

===Theaters===
By the 1870s, the snow cone&#x27;s popularity had risen to the degree that in the warm summer months, theaters would sell snow cones to keep their patrons cool. Because of this association with the theater, snow cones were thought of as an upper-class commodity. Signs in theaters instructing patrons to finish their snow cones before coming in to the second act are the earliest tangible evidence of snow cones. In the Baltimore theaters at the time, hand shavers were used to shave the ice. In the 1890s, many people started to invent easier ways to make snow cones. In that decade, patents for electric ice shavers were filed.

===Great Depression and World War II=== 
Snow cones became available outside of Baltimore during the Great Depression and the Second World War because they were exceptionally affordable. Their low cost earned them several nicknames including the &quot;Hard Times Sundae&quot; and the &quot;Penny Sunday&quot;. The low cost of producing and selling snow cones created many straightforward opportunities for work. After ice cream became unavailable at the home front, snow cones arose as a nationally popular alternative in America.

<doc id="857830" wikidata="Q3168562" url="?curid=857830" title="Jean-Paul L'Allier">
<text>Jean-Paul L&#x27;Allier (August 12, 1938 – January 5, 2016) was a Quebec politician, a two-term Member of the National Assembly of Quebec (MNA) and the 38th mayor of Quebec City.

==Background==
L&#x27;Allier was born in Hudson, Montérégie in 1938 and received a law degree from the University of Ottawa. He practised law in the Ottawa and Outaouais regions in the 1960s. He worked for the Montreal newspaper Le Devoir in the 1980s. He was a self-proclaimed Liberal, sovereigntist and social democrat.

==Member of the National Assembly==
L&#x27;Allier became a candidate to the National Assembly of Quebec in the district of Deux-Montagnes after Liberal candidate and mayor Guy Léveillée of Saint-Eustache, Laurentides dropped out of the race in the 1970 election. He won the Liberal nomination against two other candidates and subsequently won the election. He was re-elected in the 1973 election.

==Cabinet member==
L&#x27;Allier was appointed to the Cabinet in 1970 and served as Minister of Communications until 1975 and as Minister of Cultural Affairs from 1975 until 1976.

==Political defeat==
L&#x27;Allier was defeated against Parti Québécois (PQ) candidate Pierre de Bellefeuille in the 1976 election. L&#x27;Allier voted &quot;yes&quot; in the Quebec referendum of 1980 and left the Liberals in the same year.

==Mayor of Quebec City==
L&#x27;Allier ran as the &quot;Rassemblement populaire&quot; candidate for Mayor of Quebec City in 1989. He won against &quot;Progrès civique de Québec&quot; candidate Jean-François Bertrand and was sworn in as the 38th Mayor of the city. He was re-elected in 1993 and 1997.

His accomplishments include:

* The revitalization of the Saint-Roch neighborhood;
* The erection of a monument that commemorates the 30th anniversary of French President Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s official visit to Quebec City in 1967;
* The merger of the Quebec City government with twelve other surrounding municipalities, as a part of the municipal reorganization of 2001–02.

L&#x27;Ancienne-Lorette and Saint-Augustin-de-Desmaures eventually demerged.

L&#x27;Allier co-founded the &quot;Renouveau municipal de Québec&quot; and was re-elected as mayor in 2001 against &quot;Action civique de Québec&quot; candidate and former anti-merger crusader Andrée Boucher. On July 13, 2004, he announced that he would not run for re-election in November 2005 and retired from politics.

<text>Clement Burke (born Clement Anthony Bozewski; November 24, 1954) is an American musician who is best known as the drummer for the band Blondie from 1975, shortly after the band formed, throughout the band&#x27;s entire career, and he appeared on every band’s albums, along with two founding members, Debbie Harry and Chris Stein. He also played drums for the Ramones for a brief time in 1987, under the name Elvis Ramone.

==Life and career==

Burke&#x27;s early experiences behind the drum kit began in the late 1960s and early 1970s as one of the founding members of Bayonne, New Jersey&#x27;s premier cover bands, Total Environment and Sweet Willie Jam Band. Burke also gained percussion knowledge from his stint as a drummer in the famed Saint Andrew Bridgmen Drum and Bugle Corps in Bayonne. Recruited by Debbie Harry and Chris Stein when Blondie was first forming in 1974, Burke joined Blondie in early 1975.
He was a key figure in keeping the group together after Stein and Harry considered disbanding, following the departure of original bassist Fred Smith to Television; Burke recruited his friend Gary Valentine to play bass. Burke&#x27;s style of playing was influenced by Hal Blaine, Keith Moon, Ringo Starr, and Earl Palmer.

During the 1980s and 1990s, when Blondie was disbanded, Burke played drums for the Romantics (for whom Burke was the regular drummer between 1990 and 2004), Pete Townshend, Bob Dylan, Eurythmics, Dramarama, the Fleshtones, Iggy Pop, and Joan Jett, amongst others. He went on to record with the line-up of Chequered Past in 1983 with Sex Pistols guitarist Steve Jones, former Blondie bandmate Nigel Harrison, musician Tony Sales and singer/actor Michael Des Barres.

In 1987, he stood in as drummer for the Ramones (under the name &quot;Elvis Ramone&quot;) for two gigs, on August 28 in Providence, Rhode Island, and August 29 in Trenton, New Jersey at the punk club The City Gardens, after the sudden departure of Richie Ramone. On October 8, 2004, he once again played under the name &quot;Elvis Ramone&quot;, when he joined Tommy Ramone, C. J. Ramone, and Daniel Rey in the &quot;Ramones Beat on Cancer&quot; concert. He has recorded and played live with Wanda Jackson and Nancy Sinatra. Burke also played on the Go-Go&#x27;s member Kathy Valentine&#x27;s solo release &quot;Light Years&quot; in 2005. Burke recorded and toured with Dramarama from Wayne, New Jersey and Los Angeles on their 1993 album &quot;Hi-Fi Sci-Fi&quot;.
Burke was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2006 as a member of Blondie.

In 2007, Burke joined Slinky Vagabond with David Bowie guitarist Earl Slick, Glen Matlock, and Keanan Duffty playing their debut concert at the Joey Ramone Birthday Bash in May 2007. He is also a member of Magic Christian (Dirty Water Records), along with Flamin&#x27; Groovies guitarist Cyril Jordan (on guitar) and Plimsouls lead guitarist Eddie Munoz (on bass), and toured several times as drummer with the Hugh Cornwell Band.

Burke played 90-minute sets at 100 concerts in a year and in 2008 it was reported that he had taken part in an 8-year study that analysed the physical and psychological effects of drumming and the stamina required by professional drummers, conducted jointly by the University of Gloucestershire and the University of Chichester. In July 2011, Burke received an honorary doctorate from the University of Gloucestershire, as a result of the drumming project.
In December 2011 he formed the band the International Swingers with Sex Pistols bass player Glen Matlock, guitarist James Stevenson of Generation X and singer Gary Twinn of Supernaut. About the same time he became a founding member of the Split Squad, participating in tours, appearances at SXSW festivals, and in the recording of the album, &quot;Now Hear This...&quot;, released in January 2014.

In April 2013, Burke appeared on the Little Steven song &quot;All I Needed Was You&quot; along with Scott Kempner, Barry Goldberg, Gregg Sutton and Tom Jr Morgan on the Carla Olson album &quot;Have Harmony, Will Travel&quot;. In 2014, Burke was a founding member of the Empty Hearts. The group recorded on 429 Records and his bandmates included the Romantics guitarist and vocalist Wally Palmar, the Chesterfield Kings bassist Andy Babiuk, the Cars guitarist Elliot Easton, and Small Faces and Faces pianist Ian McLagan. The band&#x27;s self-titled first album was released August 5, 2014, and produced by Ed Stasium.

In 2015, via PledgeMusic, the band the International Swingers raised the money to record their first full-length self-titled album, &quot;The International Swingers&quot; (originally under the working title &quot;Whatever Works Now&quot;). The album was recorded at Studio 606 in LA which is owned by the Foo Fighters. It was then mixed by Peter Walsh who has worked with Simple Minds, Pulp and most recently Scott Walker.

In 2017, Burke played dates as a member of L.A.M.F., a Johnny Thunders tribute also featuring Walter Lure, Mike Ness, and Glen Matlock. The reunion shows in New York took place at the Bowery Electric in Manhattan on November 15 and 16 2016 (without Glen Matlock), and were recorded for the release on an album released on Jungle Records in December 2017.

In 2019, Burke played with Blondie tribute act Bootleg Blondie.

In December 2021, Burke filled in on drums for Gina Schock during the Go-Go&#x27;s show at the Whisky a Go Go to celebrate their recent induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

In 2008, Burke founded the Clem Burke Drumming project to investigate the physical and mental-health benefits of drumming.

<text>The Vietnam Air Gallantry Cross () was a military decoration of South Vietnam which was issued during the years of the Vietnam War. The Air Gallantry Cross was awarded for meritorious or heroic conduct while engaged in aerial combat. The decoration was comparable to the United States decoration of the Air Medal.

The Air Gallantry Cross was occasionally awarded to members of foreign militaries, but only if an air combat action was performed which directly benefitted Vietnamese war efforts. Pilots of the United States Air Force were often awarded the Air Gallantry Cross.

Separate decorations, known as the Vietnam Gallantry Cross and Vietnam Navy Gallantry Cross, were also issued for general service and naval achievement. These were separate awards from the Vietnam Air Gallantry Cross which came in three different grades: with gold wings, silver wings, and bronze wings.

== Recipients ==
* Daniel Brandenstein
* Robin Olds

The Air Gallantry Cross was awarded to Naval Aviators operating off aircraft carriers in the Tonkin Gulf and to United States Marine aviators operating from bases in South Vietnam.

<text>In mathematics and numerical analysis, the Ricker wavelet, Mexican hat wavelet, or Marr wavelet (for David Marr) 
:formula_1
is the negative normalized second derivative of a Gaussian function, i.e., up to scale and normalization, the second Hermite function. It is a special case of the family of continuous wavelets (wavelets used in a continuous wavelet transform) known as Hermitian wavelets. The Ricker wavelet is frequently employed to model seismic data, and as a broad-spectrum source term in computational electrodynamics.

:formula_2

The multidimensional generalization of this wavelet is called the Laplacian of Gaussian function. In practice, this wavelet is sometimes approximated by the difference of Gaussians (DoG) function, because the DoG is separable and can therefore save considerable computation time in two or more dimensions. The scale normalized Laplacian (in formula_3-norm) is frequently used as a blob detector and for automatic scale selection in computer vision applications; see Laplacian of Gaussian and scale space. The relation between this Laplacian of the Gaussian operator and the difference-of-Gaussians operator is explained in appendix A in Lindeberg (2015). The Mexican hat wavelet can also be approximated by derivatives of cardinal B-splines.

<text>Hermitian wavelets are a family of discrete and continuous wavelets used in the constant and discrete Hermite wavelet transforms. The formula_1 Hermitian wavelet is defined as the normalized formula_1 derivative of a Gaussian distribution for each positive formula_3:formula_4where formula_5 denotes the formula_1 probabilist&#x27;s Hermite polynomial. Each normalization coefficient formula_7 is given by formula_8 The function formula_9 is said to be an admissible Hermite wavelet if it satisfies the admissibility condition: 

formula_10

where formula_11 are the terms of the Hermite transform of formula_12.

In computer vision and image processing, Gaussian derivative operators of different orders are frequently used as a basis for expressing various types of visual operations; see scale space and N-jet.

==Examples==
The first three derivatives of the Gaussian function with formula_13:formula_14are:formula_15and their formula_16 norms formula_17.

Normalizing the derivatives yields three Hermitian wavelets:formula_18

<text>The D-Day Dodgers were Allied servicemen who fought in Italy during the Second World War. The D-Day Dodgers also inspired a popular wartime soldier&#x27;s song (Roud Folk Song Index no. 10499).

A rumour spread during the war that the term was publicized by Viscountess Astor, a Member of the British Parliament, who supposedly used the expression in public after a disillusioned serviceman in Italy signed a letter to her as being from a &quot;D-Day Dodger&quot;. However, there is no record that she actually said this, in or out of Parliament, and she herself denied ever saying it.

Reference to a &quot;D-Day Dodger&quot; was bitingly sarcastic, given the steady stream of Allied service personnel who were being killed or wounded in combat on the Italian front. A &quot;dodger&quot; is someone who avoids something; the soldiers in Italy felt that their sacrifices were being ignored after the invasion of Normandy, and a &quot;D-Day Dodger&quot; was a reference to someone who was supposedly avoiding real combat by serving in Italy, whereas the reality was anything but - as the numerous allied war cemeteries in locations such as Monte Cassino testify.

==The Ballad of the D-Day Dodgers==
Several versions of a song called &quot;D-Day Dodgers&quot;, set to the tune &quot;Lili Marleen&quot; (a favourite song of all troops in the North African Campaign – the British Eighth Army was a veteran formation from that theatre before landing in Italy), were sung with gusto in the last months of the war, and at post-war reunions.

The song was written in November 1944 by Lance-Sergeant Harry Pynn of the Tank Rescue Section, 19 Army Fire Brigade, who was with the 78th Infantry Division just south of Bologna, Italy. There were many variations on verses and even the chorus, but the song generally and sarcastically referred to how easy their life in Italy was. There was no mention of Lady Astor in the original lyrics. Many Allied personnel in Italy had reason to be bitter, as the bulk of material support for the Allied armies went to Northwest Europe after the invasion of Normandy. They also noted sardonically that they had participated in several &quot;D-days&quot; of their own before the landings in Normandy became popularly known as &quot;D-Day&quot;. The expression was used to refer to the day that any military operation began (with &quot;H-hour&quot; being the specific start time of an operation beginning on D-day), but the popular press turned it into an expression synonymous with the Normandy landings only. Italian campaign veterans noted that they had been in action for eleven months before the Normandy landings, and some of those had served in North Africa even before that.

The numerous Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries across Italy are compelling evidence of the fighting which took place during campaigns such as Operation Avalanche and the subsequent Battle of Monte Cassino.

Although Hamish Henderson did not write the song, he did collect different versions of it and it is attributed to him in the sleeve notes of the Ian Campbell Folk Group&#x27;s &quot;Contemporary Campbells&quot;. Many different variations have been recorded.

<text>Miriam Amanda &quot;Ma&quot; Ferguson (&quot;née&quot; Wallace; June 13, 1875 – June 25, 1961) was an American politician who served two non-consecutive terms as the governor of Texas: from 1925 to 1927, and from 1933 to 1935. She was the first female governor of Texas, and the second woman elected to the governorship of any U.S. state to assume office, after Nellie Tayloe Ross of Wyoming.

==Early life==

Miriam Amanda Wallace Ferguson was born in Bell County, Texas. She studied at Salado College and Baylor Female College. When she was 24, she married James Edward Ferguson, a lawyer, at her father&#x27;s farm near Belton in Bell County, Texas.

Her nickname, &quot;Ma&quot;, came from her initials, &quot;M. A.&quot;, and the fact that her husband was known as &quot;Pa&quot; Ferguson. They had two daughters: Ouida Wallace Ferguson and Dorrace Watt Ferguson.

==Early political career==
Her husband served as Governor of Texas from 1915 to 1917. During his second term, he was investigated by State Attorney General Dan Moody (who would, incidentally, succeed her as Governor in 1927 after her first term) for actions that had been taken against the University of Texas. The Texas State Senate impeached him, convicted him on ten charges, and prohibited him from holding state office in Texas again.

==1924 election and first term==
After her husband&#x27;s impeachment and conviction, Ma Ferguson ran in the primary for the Democratic nomination for governor and was successful, openly supported by her husband, whom she said she would consult for advice. She ran for office in the 1924 general election.

During her campaign, she said that voters would get &quot;two governors for the price of one&quot;. Her speeches at rallies consisted of introducing him and letting him take the platform. A common campaign slogan was, &quot;Me for Ma, and I Ain&#x27;t Got a Durned Thing Against Pa.&quot; Patricia Bernstein of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; stated &quot;There was never a question in anyone&#x27;s mind as to who was really running things when Ma was governor.&quot;

After her victory in the Democratic primary, Ferguson defeated George C. Butte, a prominent lawyer and University of Texas dean who emerged as the strongest Republican gubernatorial nominee in Texas since Reconstruction. Due to the widespread corruption of her husband&#x27;s term, resulting in his impeachment, thousands of voters crossed party lines in the general election to vote for the Republican candidate. Republicans usually took between 11,000 and 30,000 votes for governor, but Butte won nearly 300,000 votes, many of them from women and suffragists. It was still primarily a Democratic state, and Ferguson received 422,563 votes (58.9 percent) to Butte&#x27;s 294,920 (41.1 percent). Butte had been supported in the general election by former governor William P. Hobby, who had succeeded James Ferguson in 1917 and won a full term in 1918.

In 1924, Ma Ferguson became the first elected female chief executive of Texas. She was the second elected female state governor in the United States to assume office, and the first to be elected in a general election. Nellie Tayloe Ross had been sworn in as governor of Wyoming to finish the unexpired term of her late husband two weeks before Ferguson&#x27;s inauguration, though Ross and Ferguson won their respective elections on the same day. Ferguson&#x27;s campaign manager was Homer T. Brannon of Fort Worth, Texas.

In 1926, state attorney general Dan Moody, who had investigated her husband for embezzlement and recovered $1 million for Texas citizens, ran against her in a run-off election. He defeated her to become the next and then-youngest governor of Texas. Suffragist activism provided a major contribution to her defeat, as these women rallied behind Moody and campaigned for him.

==1932 election and second term==

Ferguson ran again in 1932. She narrowly won the Democratic nomination over incumbent Ross S. Sterling, then soundly defeated Republican Orville Bullington in the general election, 521,395 (61.6 percent) to 322,589 (38.1 percent). It was a year of Democratic successes as Franklin D. Roosevelt was elected as President of the United States. Bullington was a cousin of the first wife of John G. Tower, future U.S. Senator from Texas. He fared more strongly than most Texas Republican candidates did in that period, but did not match Butte&#x27;s 1924 showing against Ferguson.

Ferguson&#x27;s second term as governor was less controversial than her first. It was rumored that state highway contracts went only to companies that advertised in the Fergusons&#x27; newspaper, the &quot;Ferguson Forum.&quot; A House committee investigated the rumors, but no charges were ever filed. The Great Depression forced both the federal and state governments to cut down on personnel and funding of their organizations, and the Texas Rangers were no exception. The number of commissioned officers in the law-enforcement agency was reduced to 45, and the only means of transportation afforded to Rangers were free railroad passes, or using their personal horses. The situation worsened for the Rangers when they entangled themselves in politics in 1932 by publicly supporting Governor Ross Sterling in his re-election campaign over &quot;Ma&quot; Ferguson. Immediately after taking office in January 1933, she proceeded to discharge all serving Rangers. The force also saw its salaries and funds slashed by the Texas Legislature, and their numbers reduced further to 32 men. The result was that Texas became a safe hideout for the many Depression-era gangsters escaping from the law, such as Bonnie and Clyde, George &quot;Machine Gun&quot; Kelly, Pretty Boy Floyd and Raymond Hamilton. The hasty appointment of many unqualified Rangers to stop the increasing criminality proved ineffective.

The general disorganization of law enforcement in the state convinced the members of the Legislature that a thorough revision of the public security system was in order, and with that purpose it hired the services of a consulting firm from Chicago. The resulting report yielded many worrying conclusions, but the basic underlying facts were simple: the criminality levels in Texas were extremely high, and the state&#x27;s means to fight them were underfunded, undermanned, loose, disorganized and obsolete. The consultants&#x27; recommendation, besides increasing funding, was to introduce a whole reorganization of state security agencies; especially, to merge the Rangers with the Texas Highway Patrol under a new agency called the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). After deliberating, the Legislature agreed with the suggestion. The resolution that created the new state law enforcement agency was passed in 1935 under the next governor of Texas, James V. Allred, and with an initial budget of $450,000, the DPS became operational on August 10.

In October 1933, Ferguson signed into law Texas House Bill 194, which was instrumental in establishing the University of Houston as a four-year institution.

==Views and policies==

&quot;Fergusonism&quot;, as the Fergusons&#x27; brand of populism was called, remains a controversial subject in Texas. As governor, she tackled some of the tougher issues of the day. Though a teetotaler like her husband, she aligned herself with the &quot;wets&quot; in the battle over prohibition. She opposed the Ku Klux Klan, which was on the decline after 1925 because of a national murder and sex scandal by its president, D. C. Stephenson.

Ferguson has been described as a fiscal conservative but also pushed for a state sales tax and corporate income tax. She is often credited with a quote allegedly referring to bilingualism in Texas schools: &quot;If English was good enough for Jesus Christ, it ought to be good enough for the children of Texas.&quot; Variations of this statement have been dated to 1881, and were often used to ridicule the claimed backwardness of various unnamed Christians. Ferguson did not originate the quote.

Ferguson issued almost 4,000 pardons during her two nonconsecutive terms in office, many of them to free persons who had been convicted of violating prohibition laws. In 1930, between Ferguson&#x27;s terms, the Secretary of State of Texas Jane Y. McCallum published a pamphlet criticizing the former governor&#x27;s numerous pardons of prisoners. Though never proven, rumors persisted that pardons were available in exchange for cash payments to the governor&#x27;s husband. In 1936, voters passed an amendment to the state constitution stripping the governor of the power to issue pardons and granting that power to a politically independent Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles (see Capital punishment in Texas).

A number of labor laws were also passed during Ferguson&#x27;s two terms as governor.

In a 1932 speech, Ferguson&#x27;s husband James E. Ferguson defended the record of &quot;Fergusonism;&quot; listing reforms such as child labor and workmen&#x27;s compensation laws, aid for rural education, a free textbook law, and laws regulating the working hours of women. Miriam Ferguson herself defended “Fergusonism;” citing liberal measures such as a semi-monthly pay day law, an eight-hour law, the establishment of an Industrial Accident Board, and the creation of Lower Colorado and Brazos River Authorities.

==Post-governorship==

Except for an unsuccessful bid to replace Governor W. Lee &quot;Pappy&quot; O&#x27;Daniel in 1940, the Fergusons remained retired from political life after 1935. In the 1940 campaign, Ma Ferguson trailed O&#x27;Daniel&#x27;s principal rival, Ernest O. Thompson of Amarillo, who was Texas Railroad Commissioner.

Her husband, James, died of a stroke in 1944. Miriam Ferguson died from congestive heart failure in 1961 at the age of 86. She was buried in the Texas State Cemetery in Austin.

<doc id="857875" wikidata="Q6938049" url="?curid=857875" title="Murder of Scott Amedure">
<text>The murder of Scott Amedure occurred on March 9, 1995, at his mobile home in Lake Orion, Michigan. The 32-year-old was killed by 24-year-old Jonathan Schmitz, three days after the men appeared as guests for the taping of an episode of the tabloid talk show &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot;. Amedure had publicly revealed in the episode that he had a crush on Schmitz, who claimed that he was straight but flattered by the revelation. On the morning of March 9, Amedure left a sexually suggestive note on Schmitz&#x27;s apartment doorstep. In response, Schmitz purchased a 12-gauge shotgun, confronted Amedure at his home, and fired two shots into Amedure&#x27;s chest. Schmitz called 911 to report the killing and he was subsequently arrested.

Schmitz was charged with first-degree murder. He utilized the gay panic defense, in which he claimed that he killed Amedure over embarrassment about the revelation of a same-sex crush. Schmitz was found guilty of second-degree murder.

The Amedure family sued &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; for wrongful death, although the show was ultimately found to not be liable. Amedure and Schmitz&#x27;s appearance on &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; was shelved, although it was later shown to jurors during the civil trial against &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot;.

==Background==
Scott Bernard Amedure was born on January 26, 1963, the youngest of six children to Frank Amedure and Patricia Graves. Aged seventeen, Amedure dropped out of high school to join the Air Force. He served in the Air Force for four years before he returned to Michigan. Amedure had a history of substance abuse, for which he entered rehabilitation programs twice. He also experienced difficulties with relationships and he had past instances of domestic violence. Amedure worked as a bartender at Club Flamingo, a gay club in Pontiac, Michigan. According to Amedure&#x27;s neighbor Gayle Clinton, he &quot;was a talk-show junkie.&quot;

On March 6, 1995, Amedure was a guest on an episode of &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; titled &quot;Revealing Same Sex Secret Crush&quot;, in which he admitted to being a secret admirer of Jonathan Schmitz, who lived near him in Lake Orion, Michigan. Until the taping, Schmitz did not know who would be revealed as his secret admirer. Schmitz stated that he participated in the show due to curiosity, and he claimed later that the producers implied that his admirer was a woman, although the producers of the show claim that they did tell Schmitz that the admirer could be male or female. During the segment, Amedure was encouraged by Jones to share his fantasies about Schmitz, after which Schmitz was brought onstage. According to &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;[t]he two men exchanged an awkward embrace before the host dropped her bombshell.&quot; In response to Amedure&#x27;s disclosure, Schmitz laughed, then stated that he was &quot;definitely heterosexual&quot;.

==Murder==
According to footage of the murder trial, it was stated later by a friend of Amedure&#x27;s that Amedure and Schmitz went out drinking together the night after the taping and an alleged sexual encounter occurred. According to the testimony at the murder trial, three days after the taping, Amedure left a &quot;suggestive&quot; note at Schmitz&#x27;s house. After finding the note, Schmitz withdrew money from a bank, purchased a shotgun, and then went to Amedure&#x27;s mobile home. He then asked Amedure if he was the one that left the note. According to court documents, Amedure responded with a smile. Schmitz then returned to his car, got his gun, and returned to Amedure&#x27;s trailer. He then shot Amedure twice in the chest, killing him. After killing Amedure, Schmitz left the residence, telephoned 9-1-1, and confessed to the killing.

==Criminal trial==
At trial, defense attorneys argued that Schmitz, who had been diagnosed with manic depression (bipolar disorder) and Graves&#x27; disease, was caused to commit homicide by mental illness and humiliation, by way of the &quot;gay panic defense&quot;. Schmitz was found guilty of second-degree murder in 1996 and sentenced to 25–50 years in prison, but his conviction was overturned on appeal. Upon retrial, he was found guilty of the same charge once again and his sentence was reinstated. Schmitz was released from prison on August 22, 2017, after being granted parole.

==Civil trial==
In 1995, Amedure&#x27;s family filed a negligence lawsuit against &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot;, Telepictures, and Warner Bros. Represented by Geoffrey Fieger, Amedure&#x27;s family alleged that producers of the show &quot;ambushed&quot; Schmitz through the revelation of a same-sex crush and that they should have known the segment would result in violence. In May 1999, the jury awarded the Amedures $29,332,686. Time Warner&#x27;s defense attorney later claimed the verdict would cause a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on the industry. However, this judgment was later overturned by the Michigan Court of Appeals in a 2-to-1 decision. The Michigan Supreme Court declined to hear the case. The court held that &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; were not liable for Schmitz&#x27;s subsequent actions, which they deemed &quot;unforeseeable&quot;.

== Media coverage ==
The controversy was also covered as the first episode in the Netflix series &quot;Trial by Media&quot;. In 2021, the controversy was covered in season 6 of the series &quot;How It Really Happened&quot; on the US TV network HLN in an episode titled &quot;The Jenny Jones Show: Fatal Attraction&quot;. Also in 2021, the incident and a portion of the unaired &quot;The Jenny Jones Show&quot; episode was featured on an episode of VICE TV&#x27;s docuseries &quot;Dark Side of the 90s&quot;.

<text>The Great Lake, officially yingina / Great Lake, is a natural lake and man-made reservoir that is located in the central northern region of Tasmania, Australia.

==Location and features==
Fed by the Pine Rivulet and Breton Rivulet, the original natural freshwater lake, much smaller in size than its current surface area, was expanded as a result of the 1922 construction of Miena Dam #2 at its southern outflow into the Shannon River. This dam is considered to be of high heritage value by Engineers Australia.

Miena Dam #2 created the once-famous &quot;Shannon Rise&quot;, in the 500-metre section of the Shannon River between the dam and Shannon Lagoon. The hatching of thousands of caddis moths in early summer, attracted large numbers of trout and fishermen.

In 1967, a sloping-core rock-fill dam was built just downstream of Miena Dam #2 to increase the maximum-capacity level, destroying the &quot;Shannon Rise&quot;. It was raised a further in 1982, causing Miena Dam #2 to be periodically submerged.

After Lake Pedder, the Great Lake is the state&#x27;s third largest freshwater lake. It is known for its fantastic fly fishing opportunities, particularly after a wet winter or spring when water levels are high, trout can be found &#x27;tailing&#x27; in the shallow, flooded margins of the lake which provides excellent sight fly fishing.

At above sea level, the lake&#x27;s uses include hydro-electric power, fishing, and tourism. Water from the lake flows into Poatina Power Station to generate hydro-electric power.

The nearby towns of Liaweenee and Miena are popular holiday shack destinations for local tourists, despite the area&#x27;s reputation as being one of the coldest places in the generally mild-weathered state. During the winter months, when the weather is hardly conducive to camping, the population of these two small towns drops to two or three hundred. Parts of the lake surface have frozen during July in some years.

The Lake Highway or Highland Lakes Road runs along the west side of the lake and is sometimes snowed under in winter.

<doc id="857877" wikidata="Q13405921" url="?curid=857877" title="Michael Musto">
<text>Michael Musto (born December 3, 1955) is an American journalist who has long been a prevalent presence in entertainment-related publications, as well as on websites and television shows. Best known as a columnist for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, where he wrote the &quot;La Dolce Musto&quot; column of gossip, nightlife, reviews, interviews, and political observations, in 2021, he started writing articles about nightlife, movies, theater, NYC, and LGBTQ politics for the revived &quot;Village Voice&quot;, which returned as a print publication, with accompanying website, and now is web only. 

His books are &quot;Downtown&quot; and &quot;Manhattan on the Rocks&quot;, as well as a compilation of selected columns published as &quot;La Dolce Musto: Writings By The World&#x27;s Most Outrageous Columnist&quot; and a subsequent collection, &quot;Fork on the Left, Knife in the Back&quot;. He currently writes a monthly gossip column called &quot;Read Now, Cry Later&quot; for &quot;Queerty&quot;.

==Early life==
Musto was born in Manhattan to an Italian American family. He was raised in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and graduated from Columbia University in 1976. During his studies, he was a theater critic for the &quot;Columbia Spectator&quot;.

==Career==
Musto is gay and has been published regularly in several LGBT publications, including &quot;Out&quot; and &quot;The Advocate&quot;.

He contributes to HuffPost, has written the weekly, entertainment-related &quot;Musto Unfiltered&quot; column for NewNowNext.com, and has had bylines in &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;W&quot;, and &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;.

Among Musto&#x27;s first journalistic jobs were assignments covering culture for &quot;Circus&quot; magazine, &quot;SoHo Weekly News&quot;, and &quot;After Dark&quot; magazine, as well as becoming the music critic for &quot;Us&quot; magazine in the 1980s. In 1982, he began writing for &quot;Details&quot;, then a downtown style-and-nightlife magazine, and in 1984, Musto began his &quot;Village Voice&quot; column, after having already written features for the publication. Musto&#x27;s breathlessly dishy and opinionated first-person column celebrated nightlife and LGBT personalities, described outlandish New York club fetes, and gave vital early coverage to up-and-coming performers like John Sex, RuPaul, Kiki and Herb, Bridget Everett, Jackie Hoffman, Bianca Del Rio and Peppermint. A 1989 appearance in &quot;Slaves of New York&quot;—based on Tama Janowitz&#x27;s book centered on the New York nightlife scene—was called the film&#x27;s only moment of credibility by critic J. Hoberman of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. Other cameos through the years were made in &quot;Garbo Talks&quot; (1984), &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; (1985), &quot;Jeffrey&quot; (1995), &quot;Death of a Dynasty&quot; (2003), &quot;The Big Gay Musical&quot; (2009), &quot;Violet Tendencies&quot; (2010), and &quot;The Smurfs&quot; (2011). Larger film roles awaited for more recent films like &quot;Vamp Bikers&quot;, &quot;Japanese Borscht&quot;, &quot;The Duke of New York&quot;, and &quot;Mister Sister&quot;.

Musto was a great personal friend of the videographer Nelson Sullivan, who filmed much of the footage that exists of the &quot;Club Kids&quot;, as well as obsessively chronicling Musto&#x27;s exploits and those of RuPaul and Sylvia Miles.

Musto also used his column to lambast homophobia and to demand attention to the growing AIDS crisis, Musto joining the activist group ACT UP and engaging in their highly influential rallies and protests. In 2011, &quot;The Advocate&quot; magazine referred to Musto&#x27;s &quot;legendary gossip column&quot; and said, &quot;Since 1984, shrewd and self-deprecating humorist Michael Musto has written his &#x27;La Dolce Musto&#x27; column, tirelessly chronicling nightlife and celebrity culture. The bridge-burning blogger and baron of blind items has earned a position as both historian and spokesman for the gay community.&quot;

In the 1980s, Musto did nightlife-related segments for MTV, where his un-self-conscious gayness seemed radical. Videotographer Nelson Sullivan chose Musto as one of his favorite subjects and relentlessly followed the writer through clubs, appearances, and family get-togethers, many of the videos later surfacing on YouTube. From 1993 to 2000, he was one of the most prominent columnists on &quot;The Gossip Show&quot;, an E! program which featured colorful reporters relaying celebrity dish, and again, Musto was out and flamboyant on the show. He was featured on the cover of New York magazine in a 1994 &quot;Gossip Mafia&quot; story that spanned New York&#x27;s most influential tattlers, including Richard Johnson, George Rush, and Jeannette Walls. In 1999, he cohosted &quot;New York Central&quot;, a nightly magazine-format show on the Metro Channel.

Musto appeared in drag in a blue dress in the all drag queen music video for Cyndi Lauper&#x27;s remake of her single &quot;(Hey Now) Girls Just Want To Have Fun&quot; (1994). He has also done cameos in videos by TV on the Radio, Sherry Vine, Sharon Needles, Jinkx Monsoon, Larry Tee, and Gorgon City featuring Jennifer Hudson, among many others.

Musto penned several writeups in &quot;The Village Voice&quot; about the 1996 murder of Andre &quot;Angel&quot; Melendez, helping bring national attention to a case that resulted in the trial and conviction of Michael Alig and Robert &quot;Freeze&quot; Riggs. He was the first to report Alig&#x27;s firing from The Limelight club by owner Peter Gatien and to allude to talk about a missing person from Alig&#x27;s sphere. When his blind item describing the buzz on the details of the crime got picked up by &quot;The New York Post&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Page Six&quot; gossip column, the story took on even more prominence. A later Village Voice feature story acknowledged Musto&#x27;s breaking item. The movie &quot;Party Monster&quot; (2003) includes reference to a Musto item, and Musto has appeared in many related documentaries, including &quot;Disco Bloodbath&quot; and A&amp;E&#x27;s &quot;American Justice&quot;, as well as several Geraldo Rivera shows, where he had long been the expert on club kids. Discussing topics like gossip and nightlife, Musto also appeared on daytime talk shows hosted by Sally Jessy Raphael, Joan Rivers, Ricki Lake, Richard Bey, Gordon Elliott, and Mark L. Walberg.

In 2001, Musto appeared in a groundbreaking ad campaign for Fortunoff in which he sported a wedding veil, campily promoting the possibility of same-sex marriage.

In 2010, Musto made a cameo appearance in Erasure&#x27;s re-release of &quot;A Little Respect&quot; (HMI Redux)&#x27;; the proceeds of this release were donated to help students attending the Harvey Milk Institute. Also in 2010, LCD Soundsystem mentioned Musto in the song &quot;Pow Pow&quot; playfully urging him to &quot;Eat it&quot; (wacky retaliation for banter between Musto and the group&#x27;s James Murphy at a Paper Nightlife Awards ceremony). That year, Musto also added &quot;Theater Producer&quot; to his resume, when he coproduced the musical comedy &quot;Perfect Harmony&quot; about the search for truth, love, and high school &quot;a cappella&quot; championship glory, which played Off-Broadway in New York City.

In 2011, Musto was named one of the &quot;Out 100&quot; as one of the country&#x27;s most influential LGBT personalities.

In 2013, he played himself in a scene on the NBC series &quot;Smash&quot;, having also previously figured in a plot line involving his gossip writing.

In May 2013, Musto was laid off from &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, but in 2016, he was back as an entertainment correspondent, writing three cover stories that year. The Village Voice folded, but then it came back in 2021 as a quarterly print publication. Musto was writing for the paper (and the accompanying website) again and now that it&#x27;s web only, he&#x27;s still there.

Musto was a regular commentator on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; where he sardonically skewered the antics of Paris Hilton, Lindsay Lohan, and other scandalous celebrities du jour. Starting in 2015, Musto became a recurring panelist on Logo TV&#x27;s &quot;Cocktails and Classics&quot;, which involved showing well known films and offering campy commentary on them.

He has moderated Broadway talkbacks for shows like &quot;Talk Radio&quot; and &quot;End of the Rainbow&quot;, and in 2016, was the celebrity guest star one night in the off-Broadway production of &quot;Oh, Hello.&quot;

Musto has also dabbled in acting and singing. In 1980, he became lead singer of a Motown cover band called the Must, and once shared a bill with rising star Madonna. He played a lead role and received rave reviews from Eileen Shapiro of &quot;Huffington Post&quot;, for the film &quot;Vamp Bikers Tres&quot; by Eric Rivas, as a head doctor named Hedda Hopper alongside Angel Salazar. The film premiered in 2016 at Anthology Film Archives and in 2018 was released by the Orchard. Musto sang a pop/reggae/dance ditty, &quot;I Got Ur Back&quot;, written and produced by Tyler Stone, based on Musto&#x27;s idea, for Trax Records, released in 2017. A celebrity roast of Musto at Actors Temple on May 22, 2017—kicked off by Rosie O&#x27;Donnell and hosted by Bruce Vilanch-raised significant money for the Callen-Lorde clinic. The roast which was produced by Daniel DeMello and directed by Rachel Klein, featured Bianca Del Rio, Jinkx Monsoon, Judy Gold, Orfeh, Randy Rainbow, and Luann de Lesseps. In addition to doubling the take of the benefit, O&#x27;Donnell—after aiming some barbs at Musto&#x27;s closet-busting mania—thanked him for pulling her into the community; in the 1990s, he&#x27;d urged her and Ellen DeGeneres in print to come out of the closet.

He has won ten Glam Awards for Best Nightlife Writer/Blogger, as well as their Living Legend award. He was named one of &quot;Genre&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;Men We Love&quot; more than once, won a Lifetime Achievement award at the Gay Expo at Javits Center (2015), was named one of &quot;Metrosource&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;People We Love&quot; (2019) and got a special award for his work from the Imperial Court of New York. In 2024, the Jim Owles Liberal Democratic Club honored him with a Human Rights award.

<text>The Labour Representation Committee was a reformist labour organization in Manitoba, Canada, and was the ideological successor to groups such as the Winnipeg Labour Party, the Independent Labour Party and the Manitoba Labour Party. It was founded in late 1912, and was based on a British organization of the same name.

The LRC cooperated with the Social Democratic Party of Canada in the municipal elections of 1913, and the two parties did not compete against each other in the 1914 provincial election. This was a marked contrast to the hostility which had previously existed between reformist labour groups and the Socialist Party of Canada (from which the SDPC had split).

The party&#x27;s candidates in 1914 were W.J. Bartlett (Assiniboia) and R.S. Ward (Elmwood). All of these candidates placed third, behind their Conservative and Liberal opponents. Fred Dixon was not a candidate of the LRC in 1914, but sympathized with most of its goals and was from the same reformist tradition. Unofficially supported by many in the LRC, Dixon was elected as an independent candidate in a Winnipeg constituency.

For the provincial election of 1915, the LRC supported the two SDPC candidates in Winnipeg North (one of whom was successful), and also nominated William Bayley in Assiniboia. Bayley finished ahead of John Thomas Haig, the riding&#x27;s Tory incumbent, and came within 55 votes of defeating Liberal John Wilton. Dixon again ran as an independent.

The candidates nominated by the LRC in 1914-15 officially ran as &quot;Independent Labour&quot;.

This organization dissolved after the election of 1915. Three years later, some of its supporters (including Dixon and Arthur Puttee) started the Dominion Labour Party in Winnipeg.

<doc id="857884" wikidata="Q1859849" url="?curid=857884" title="Saturn S-Series">
<text>The Saturn S-Series is a family of compact cars from the Saturn automobile company of General Motors. Saturn pioneered the brand-wide &quot;no-haggle&quot; sales technique.

Its automobile platform, the Z-body, was developed entirely in-house at Saturn, and it shared very little with the rest of the General Motors model line. It implemented a spaceframe design, used on the Pontiac Fiero during the 1980s, with non-load-carrying side panels made of plastic instead of metal. These polymer panels were dent-resistant, something that remained a selling point for Saturn until just a few years before the Saturn brand was discontinued.

The S-Series was marketed from the fall of 1990 for the 1991 model year through the end of the 2002 model year. Significant design updates were made in 1996, 1997, and 2000 for all cars. Although nearly every year of the S-Series&#x27;s existence brought some minor changes to the architecture of the car, each model kept the same basic body styling throughout its respective production period.

==History==
The S-Series debuted for the 1991 model year with the Sport Coupe (SC) and Sedan Level (SL) models. The SC was only available with the DOHC (Dual Overhead Cam) engine whereas the SLs had an option for the SOHC (Single Overhead Cam) engine (SL1) or the DOHC (SL2).

For the 1993 model year, the SC gained an SOHC option (SC1) in addition to the existing DOHC option (SC2, renamed from SC). The SL &amp; SC families were joined by the SW (Station Wagon) models, in both SW1 and SW2 flavors.

The S-Series all used either the SOHC LK0/L24 or the DOHC LL0 version of the completely original, designed in-house Saturn 1.9L engine. SL1s, SC1s, and SW1s were only offered with the MP2 manual transmission and the MP6 automatic, while SL2, SC2 and SW2 models came with either the MP3 manual or MP7 automatic. The only difference in each case is the selection of gear ratios, with the SOHC-associated transmissions being geared taller for more efficiency, and the DOHC-associated transmissions having shorter, more closely spaced ratios for performance. As a result, it&#x27;s not uncommon for enthusiast-owners to swap a tall-geared MP2 manual into a car equipped with a DOHC engine for better fuel economy on the highway.

Aside from the engine and transmission, the level 2 models also included 15-inch instead of 14-inch wheels, a correspondingly larger tire size, EVO steering, a rear swaybar, the option of rear disc brakes (standard on the 1991–1992 SC), color-matched bumpers and door handles, and more interior options such as power locks, power windows, rear defroster, &amp; a sunroof (SC2 only). Aside from the wheel size, it was almost impossible to tell a 1 from a 2 externally, except for the SC2s which had retractable headlamps throughout the 1996 model year.

A redesign beginning with the 1999 model year gave the SC a small suicide door (more correctly a clamshell door) on the driver&#x27;s side to improve rear-seat access. This type of door had previously been used in extended cab pickup trucks, but was an innovation in coupe design.

The level 1 S-Series equipped with a manual transmission were among the most fuel-efficient cars available in the United States when they were produced, reaching in EPA highway tests at the time (this would likely translate to under current methodologies).

The S-Series was replaced by the Saturn ION for the 2003 model year.

===Export markets===
Taiwan and Japan were the only two Asian countries to import Saturns. From June 1992 to 1996, the first- and second-generation sedans plus the first-generation coupes were sold in Taiwan. Taiwan was selected as a way to test the car&#x27;s competitiveness in what was a small, level market, with most international players present and with no significant domestic brands. From 1997 to 2001, the second-generation versions were sold in right-hand drive in Japan. Some &quot;Toyota Netz&quot; dealerships and former Isuzu dealerships also offered Saturn products until 2001.

Canada imported all available Saturn models from 1992 onward.

==First generation (1991)==
===First generation SL===

The first generation SL was constructed for the 1991 to 1995 model years, with the first Saturn rolling off the assembly line in the Spring Hill, Tennessee factory on July 30, 1990, the same day that then-CEO of GM, Roger Bonham Smith, retired. It was maroon with a tan interior.

From 1991 to 1992, the Saturn SL-series Sedan trim levels consisted of the SL, the SL1, and the SL2.

The base SL model featured the MP2 5-speed manual transmission only, and it had manual steering. On the exterior, the car featured unique hubcaps different from the SL1 and came equipped with only a driver&#x27;s side exterior mirror (a passenger mirror was a popular dealer-installed option). On the inside, the SL featured a standard AM/FM radio with no cassette player and lower-grade cloth material on the seats. Some factory options such as power windows, power locks, or cruise control were not available on the SL but Air-conditioning and an AM/FM/Cassette radio were available on the option sheet. The SL1 trim level added power steering, a passenger mirror, different hubcaps for the 14-inch wheels, an AM/FM cassette player, and softer cloth material on the seats. It featured as standard equipment the same MP2 manual or the MP6 4-speed automatic transmission could be had as an option. The SL1 could be optioned with power windows, power locks, power mirror (passenger side only - driver&#x27;s side retained manual control), cruise control, and air conditioning. Both were offered only with the SOHC 1.9L I4 &quot;LK0&quot; engine that produced , which was rated at 27 mpg (8.7L/100 km/32 mpg) City, 34 mpg (6.9L/100 km; 41 mpg) Highway. The SL2 trim level featured the MP3 5-speed manual transmission, or the MP7 4-speed automatic transmission, both exclusively with the DOHC 1.9L I4 LL0 engine that was rated at , 24 mpg (9.8L/100 km; 29 mpg) City, 34 mpg (6.9L/100 km; 41 mpg) Highway. The SL2 also brought body-color bumpers, 15-inch steel wheels (alloys were optional), and higher spec cloth on the seats (including the seatbacks - on SL and SL1 the seatbacks were vinyl). SL2&#x27;s could be optioned with power windows, locks, mirror (again, pass. side only), cruise control, air conditioning, sunroof, and leather seats. Anti-lock brakes were available as an option as well, which brought along rear disc brakes.

For the 1995 model year, the seatbelts were changed from the power passive restraint type to the conventional 3-point type. The interior of the vehicle was redesigned with a new dashboard and the addition of a front passenger&#x27;s airbag. The center console was updated as well, adding previously absent cup holders. Also for 1995, the SOHC (LK0) engine was given MPFI to create the L24 engine.

The S-Series had a fuel tank, which means that both cars got around on a single tank based on average of . Owners of the base model typically report real-world fuel mileage of about 38–41  mpg-US (6.2–5.7 L/100 km; 46–49 mpg-imp) on the highway with the manual transmission.

===First generation SW===

For the 1993 model year, a station wagon variant of the SL was added to the model lineup. This was offered in SW1 and SW2 trim levels. The station wagon used the same doors as the sedan, but the bodywork behind the C-pillar and the roof differed.

===First generation SC===

The first generation Saturn SC coupes were made from 1990 until 1996. The first generation Saturn SC coupes were originally only available in one trim level which was the SC.

The 1990–1992 Saturn SC featured a DOHC 1.9-liter &quot;LL0&quot; inline-four engine that was rated at . For the 1993 model year, the original regular SC coupe model was renamed as the SC2 and a new SC1 trim level was introduced. For the 1994 model year, the SC1 and the SC2 had both gotten revised power door locks and a recalibrated automatic transmission. The first generation SC2 had received a minor refresh in 1995 in which the lower front bumper and the vehicle&#x27;s taillights were both updated. For the 1995 model year, both the SC1 and the SC2 had gotten a redesigned interior with a new redesigned dashboard with a front passenger&#x27;s airbag.

The first generation SC1 coupe featured a SOHC 1.9-liter &quot;LK0&quot; inline-four engine that was rated at . The SC1&#x27;s engine was later upgraded to the L24 engine for the 1995 model year.

The first generation Saturn SC1 coupes shared the same fixed headlight front fascia as the SL sedans and the SW station wagons, rather than the pop-up headlight design used on the SC2 and the original SC. The SC1 also lacked a rear trunk lid reflector and a rear stabilizer bar.

=== SL3 ===
For the 1994 model year, a highest-trim &quot;SL3&quot; model was reportedly being considered. Saturn owner&#x27;s manuals from this period made mention of the SL3 - it would have featured an SC front end on an SL2 body, with all options as standard.

==Second generation (1996)==
===Second generation SL and SW===

The second generation SL sedans and SW station wagons were made from 1996 to 1999. They both featured a completely redesigned exterior. The interior was mostly the same as on the first generation vehicles, while mechanically they went largely untouched. The redesigned second generation S-Series went on sale in 1995 for the 1996 model year.

A few minor changes were made for the 1998 model year S-Series vehicles. Due to multiple complaints about the noise coming from the vehicle&#x27;s trip odometer that had been in all of the Saturn S-Series since 1995, had replaced with a new type of trip odometer in an effort to correct the problem. For the 1998 model year, a new cluster with a digital trip odometer had been introduced. Rear disc-brakes were no longer available as an option on the S-Series due to high costs for them as well as very little improvement in braking performance over the conventional rear drum-brakes setup.

Beginning with all of the Saturn S-Series vehicles that were made in late 1999 (sometimes referred to as 1999.5 models) had received improvements to both the SOHC and the DOHC engines in the S-Series. These changes included revised pistons, new connecting rods, and new crankshaft counterweights in the engine as well. The Twin Cam cylinder head had now featured a new roller-rocker setup with hydraulic tappets and roller cams replacing the conventional bucket lifter setup of the previous engine in the S-Series.

Also introduced for the 1999 model year S-Series vehicles that were sold in California was a different type of exhaust manifold that housed an upstream catalytic converter (this converter had heated up much faster than the conventional unit, and it had also decreased exhaust emissions faster as well), and it also had provisions for an air-injection reaction system (This had injected fresh air into the exhaust to reduce hydrocarbons during the startup of the vehicle, as it would help the oxygen sensors and catalytic converters reach their operating temperatures faster). These vehicles were made to meet the all-new CARB ULEV standards for the 1999 model year.
===Second generation SC===

The second generation SC coupes were made from 1997 until 1999. The second generation SC coupes had also moved to the longer wheelbase that the SL sedans and the SW station wagons had used, resulting in an equal wheelbase length across all S-Series models. The redesign had resulted in a more curved look for the SC coupes, which gave a slight increase in the vehicle&#x27;s interior room/space, as well as a completely redesigned exterior of the vehicle itself. For the 1999 model year, a front-opening clamshell door was added to the driver&#x27;s side of the vehicle. Even though this door on the driver&#x27;s side of the vehicle had allowed easier access into the vehicle&#x27;s rear seat, the driver&#x27;s seat in the vehicle was also able to slide forward to allow easy access to the vehicle&#x27;s rear seat as well. As a clamshell door, the rear driver&#x27;s side door could not open unless the front door was open, because the door handle was on the inside of the door itself. Like the first generation SC coupes, the SC1 model lacked a rear sway bar.

==Third generation (2000)==
===Third generation SL and SW===
In 1999 for the 2000 model year, the Saturn S-Series had been redesigned for the final time before being discontinued in 2002. This resulted in the third generation Saturn S-Series.

The exterior of the Saturn SL sedans received new body panels from the belt-line down. The rear end of the SL sedans received a redesigned applique on the trunk, and the headlights of the SL sedans had received orange turn signal indicators.

The interior of all the Saturn S-Series models received a completely redesigned dashboard, center console, and steering wheel, but the rest of the interiors were mostly unchanged. The SL2, SW2, and SC2 got the storage compartment with a sliding armrest in the center console as standard, whereas the SL1, SW1, and SC1 did not.

Like the 1999 model year SL sedans and the 1999 model year SW station wagons that were made in late in 1999, the 2000 model year SL sedans and the 2000 model year SW station wagons had also included a digital trip odometer, which did not cause any issues like the analog trip odometers that were used in the 1991-early 1999 model year S-Series vehicles.

The third generation Saturn S-Series was also the first Saturn to use the body control module (BCM), and the powertrain control module (PCM) systems in tandem with each other. In the third generation Saturn S-Series models, the PCM system was used strictly for the vehicle&#x27;s transmission and engine, whereas the BCM system was used strictly for the vehicle&#x27;s interior functions such as the digital trip odometer and speedometer.

Beginning with the 2001 model year, side curtain airbags became available as an optional feature. The optional side curtain airbags were only available on the 2001 to 2002 model Saturn SL1 and SL2 sedans.
===Third generation SC ===

The third generation of Saturn SC continued to be available in SC1 and SC2 models. While retaining the previous generation&#x27;s bodywork, it was facelifted with redesigned fascias front and rear, as well as new headlamps and tail lamps. The front fenders and door panels were also changed, continuing the character line all the way down to the fog light beneath the front bumper. A PCM and BCM were added. A new GT trim package had become available for the Saturn SC coupes for the 2001 model year, along with the option of American Racing Wheels that was only available on the GT version of the Saturn SC coupes. A rear spoiler on the vehicle&#x27;s rear trunk lid was also made available for the 2001 to 2002 model year Saturn SC GT coupes.

==Special edition Saturns==

A special Homecoming edition of the SL2 was released for 1994. It had special Pearl White paint (a &quot;silver-tint&quot; pearl, shared with Cadillac models of this year), black Saturn emblems, spoiler, &quot;teardrop&quot; wheels, anti-lock four-wheel disc brakes, grey leather/cloth interior, rear headrests, fog lamps, and power locks and windows. Options included a sunroof, CD player, and the 4-speed automatic with traction control.

In 1998 and 1999, prospective buyers of a red or white SC2 had the option of purchasing the &quot;Black Top Coupe Package&quot; for $225.00 (US). The models were referred to as the &quot;Red Hot Coupe&quot; or &quot;White Hot Coupe&quot;, based on the exterior color. The package came with a black roof panel, black outside rearview mirrors, black emblems, white face gauges and black accented teardrop wheels. These are extremely rare.

In 1999, a second Homecoming Edition was produced in a special &quot;Mint Color&quot; with tan leather interior, special off-white gauge faceplates, and black Saturn badges to commemorate the second &quot;Homecoming&quot; visit to the Spring Hill, Tennessee manufacturing facility. The 1999 Homecoming Edition also had the same features offered as the 1994 Homecoming Edition.
In 2001, a special yellow SC2 coupé model was also built. The model was officially named &quot;Limited Edition&quot;, but soon became known as the &quot;Bumblebee Edition&quot;. 99 were produced, each with a certificate of authenticity. The &quot;Bumblebee Edition&quot; included embroidered headrests, black leather interior with yellow leather inserts on the seats and door panels, black roof and mirrors, number designation inside the fuel filler door, and a certificate of authenticity. These are not to be confused with the regular issue Yellow Sport Coupe.
For the 2001 model year only, a special edition of the Saturn SL2 sedan that was called the Saturn SL2 10th Anniversary Edition (also known as the Silver Anniversary Edition) was made available. The Saturn SL2 10th Anniversary Edition had included several upscale features that were not available on any other Saturn S-Series vehicles like power windows, leather interior, standard side curtain airbags, and several other upscale features. The Saturn SL2 10th Anniversary Edition also had &quot;Saturn 10th Anniversary&quot; stitched onto the front seat adjustable leather headrests. The Saturn SL2 10th Anniversary Edition had also featured a rear spoiler on the vehicle&#x27;s rear trunk lid.

==Right-hand drive==
In addition to the above-mentioned &quot;Special Edition&quot; Saturns; there was also the 1999–2001 Saturn SWP &quot;Postal&quot; station wagon that were produced (450 in 1999), intended to be marketed to rural route mail carriers. These station wagons were right-hand-drive vehicles.

There were also a limited number of Saturns that were exported to Japan as right-hand-drive vehicles circa between 1997 and 2000 (during the lifetime of the second-generation model). Aside from having the steering wheel on the other side, Japanese market Saturns were also fitted with slightly different light units. The rear lamps had amber turn signals and the front indicators were mounted closer to the corners rather than inboard. The SL and SW&#x27;s engine displacement and dimensions were within the Japanese government&#x27;s dimension regulations and engine tax brackets (as only 1.9-liter engines were offered for the second-generation models), although the SC did not meet the dimension regulations and would have been subjected to annual taxes.

Saturn faced a hard time in Japan, where it played directly into the strengths of the Japanese manufacturers, comparing unfavorably with better-priced and more competent Japanese compact cars. The interior, especially, received criticism. A mere 602 units were sold in Saturn&#x27;s first year in Japan (April to December 1997).

Another problem was that Japanese car dealers have always excelled at customer service; this meant that Saturn&#x27;s main sales argument in the United States was meaningless in the Japanese market. The introduction of Saturn was also ill-timed, as the economy was in the midst of a recession due to the effects of the 1980s &quot;bubble economy&quot;. As the Japanese had less money to spend on &quot;luxury goods&quot;, as imported products are regarded, Saturn found very few buyers.

==Theft==
The 1995 Saturn SL was the most stolen vehicle in 2003, while the 1994 SL took third place in CCC Information Services&#x27;s 2003 most stolen vehicle report. According to the Lynnwood, Washington police department, when use of the key wears on the door and ignition mechanisms, a filed blank key can be used to open the door and start the engine. 

==Racing==
Saturn SCs competed in the SCCA World Challenge in the 1990s, winning several races from 1995 to 1997.
Several S-Series cars have been used as rally race cars. S-Series cars are also popular in dirt oval racing and autocross.

<text>In Vietnamese cuisine, , bánh mỳ or banh mi (, ; , &#x27;bread&#x27; (Hanoi: or Saigon: , (Chữ Nôm: 餅) is a short baguette with thin, crisp crust and a soft, airy texture. It is often split lengthwise and filled with meat and savory ingredients like a submarine sandwich and served as a meal, called . Plain is also eaten as a staple food.

A typical Vietnamese roll or sandwich is a fusion of meats and vegetables from native Vietnamese cuisine such as (Vietnamese sausage), coriander (cilantro), cucumber, pickled carrots, and pickled daikon combined with condiments from French cuisine such as , along with red chili and mayonnaise. However, a variety of popular fillings are used, like (Chinese barbecued pork), xíu mại Vietnamese minced pork, and nem nướng grilled pork sausage, to even ice cream which are more of a dessert. In Vietnam, bread rolls and sandwiches are typically eaten for breakfast, or as a snack.

The baguette was introduced to Vietnam by the French in the mid-19th century, during the Nguyễn dynasty, and became a staple food by the early 20th century. In the 1950s, a distinctly Vietnamese style of sandwich developed in Saigon, becoming a popular street food, also known as (&#x27;Saigon sandwich&#x27; or &#x27;Saigon-style &#x27;). Following the Vietnam War, overseas Vietnamese popularized the sandwich in countries such as Australia, Canada and the United States. In these countries, they are commonly sold in Asian bakeries.

==Terminology==
In Vietnamese, the word &#x27; is derived from &#x27; (which can refer to many kinds of food, primarily baked goods, including bread) and &#x27; (&quot;wheat&quot;). It may also be spelled &#x27; in northern Vietnam. Taken alone, &#x27; means any kind of bread, but it could refer to the Vietnamese baguette or the sandwich made from it. To distinguish the unfilled bread from the sandwich with fillings, the term &#x27; (&quot;plain bread&quot;) can be used. To distinguish Vietnamese-style bread from other kinds of bread, the term &#x27; (&quot;Saigon-style bread&quot;) or &#x27; (&quot;Vietnam-style bread&quot;) can be used.

A folk etymology claims that the word &#x27; is a corruption of the French &#x27;, meaning soft, white bread. However, &quot;&quot; (or its Nôm form, ) has referred to rice cakes and other pastries since as early as the 13th century, long before French contact.

==History==

The word , meaning &quot;bread&quot;, is attested in Vietnamese as early as the 1830s, in Jean-Louis Taberd&#x27;s dictionary &#x27;. The French introduced Vietnam to the baguette, along with other baked goods such as pâté chaud, in the 1860s, at the start of their imperialism in Vietnam. Northern Vietnamese initially called the baguette &#x27;, literally &quot;Western bánh&quot;, while Southern Vietnamese called it , &quot;wheat bánh&quot;. Nguyễn Đình Chiểu mentions the baguette in his 1861 poem &quot;&quot;. Due to the price of imported wheat at the time, French baguettes and sandwiches were considered a luxury. During World War I, an influx of French soldiers and supplies arrived. At the same time, disruptions of wheat imports led bakers to begin mixing in inexpensive rice flour (which also made the bread fluffier). As a result, it became possible for ordinary Vietnamese to enjoy French staples such as bread. Many shops baked twice a day, because bread tends to go stale quickly in the hot, humid climate of Vietnam. Baguettes were mainly eaten for breakfast with some butter and sugar.

Until the 1950s, sandwiches hewed closely to French tastes, typically a &quot;jambon-beurre&quot; moistened with a mayonnaise or liver spread. The 1954 Partition of Vietnam sent over a million migrants from North Vietnam to South Vietnam, transforming Saigon&#x27;s local cuisine. Among the migrants were and , who opened a small bakery named in District 3. In 1958, became one of the first shops to sell &#x27;. Around this time, another migrant from the North began selling sandwiches from a basket on a mobylette, and a stand in Gia Định Province (present-day Phú Nhuận District) began selling sandwiches. Some shops stuffed sandwiches with inexpensive Cheddar cheese, which came from French food aid that migrants from the North had rejected. Vietnamese communities in France also began selling &#x27;.

After the Fall of Saigon in 1975, &quot;&quot; sandwiches became a luxury item once again. During the so-called &quot;subsidy period&quot;, state-owned &quot;phở&quot; eateries often served bread or cold rice as a side dish, leading to the present-day practice of dipping in &quot;phở&quot;. In the 1980s, Đổi Mới market reforms led to a renaissance in , mostly as street food.

Meanwhile, Vietnamese Americans brought &quot;bánh mì&quot; sandwiches to cities across the United States. In Northern California, and his sons are credited with popularizing &quot;&quot; among Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese Americans alike through their food truck services provider and their fast-food chain, Lee&#x27;s Sandwiches, beginning in the 1980s. Sometimes was likened to local sandwiches. In New Orleans, a &quot;Vietnamese po&#x27; boy&quot; recipe won the 2009 award for the best po&#x27; boy at the annual Oak Street Po-Boy Festival. A restaurant in Philadelphia also sells a similar sandwich, marketed as a &quot;Vietnamese hoagie&quot;.
Since the 1970s, Vietnamese refugees from the Vietnam War arrived in London and were hosted at community centers in areas of London such as De Beauvoir Town eventually founding a string of successful Vietnamese-style canteens in Shoreditch where &quot;bánh mì&quot; alongside &quot;phở&quot;, was popularised from the 1990s.

 sandwiches were featured in the 2002 PBS documentary &quot;Sandwiches That You Will Like&quot;. The word was added to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; on 24 March 2011. As of 2017, is included in about 2% of U.S. restaurant sandwich menus, a nearly fivefold increase from 2013. On 24 March 2020, Google celebrated bánh mì with a Google Doodle.

==Ingredients==
===Bread===
A Vietnamese baguette has a thin crust and white, airy crumb. It may consist of both wheat flour and rice flour.

Besides being made into a sandwich, it is eaten alongside meat dishes, such as &quot;bò kho&quot; (a beef stew), curry, and &quot;&quot;. It can also be dipped in condensed milk (see Sữa Ông Thọ).

===Fillings===
A sandwich typically consists of one or more meats, accompanying vegetables, and condiments.

Accompanying vegetables typically include fresh cucumber slices or wedges, leaves of the coriander plant and pickled carrot and daikon in shredded form (). Common condiments include spicy chili sauce, sliced chilis, seasoning sauce, and mayonnaise. These sandwiches can even be filled with seared tofu. 

==Varieties==

Many fillings are used. A typical shop in the United States offers at least 10 varieties.

The most popular variety is &#x27;, &quot;thịt&quot; meaning &quot;meat&quot;. &#x27; (also known as &#x27;, &#x27;, or &quot;special combo&quot;) is made with various Vietnamese cold cuts, such as sliced pork or pork belly, &quot;chả lụa&quot; (Vietnamese sausage), and head cheese, along with the liver &quot;&quot; and vegetables like carrot or cucumbers.

Other varieties include:

* &quot; (shredded pork sandwich) shredded pork or pork skin, doused with fish sauce
* &quot; (pork floss sandwich)
* &quot; (minced pork meatball sandwich) smashed pork meatballs
* &quot; (ham sandwich)
* &quot; (sardine sandwich)
* &#x27; (&#x27; sandwich)
* &#x27; or &#x27; (barbecue pork sandwich)

<text>The Saturn L-Series is a line of automobiles, sedans and station wagons that were made by Saturn Corporation in Wilmington, Delaware.

Poor sales of the L-Series cars caused GM to cancel the line for 2005. The first L-Series car was built in May 1999, and the last one rolled off the Wilmington line on June 17, 2004, after a short run of 2005 models. About 406,300 L-Series cars were built in this period. The plant was then retooled to build the Pontiac Solstice and Saturn Sky roadsters.

The replacement for the L-Series, the Saturn Aura, arrived in August 2006 for the 2007 model-year. The Aura was built on the Epsilon platform, shared with the Pontiac G6, Saab 9-3, and Chevrolet Malibu.

==Model history==
*2000: In May 1999 for the 2000 model year, Saturn Corporation introduced the Saturn L-Series as a lineup of sedan and station wagon vehicle models – three sedan models and two station wagon models. The sedan L-Series models were the four-cylinder LS and LS1, and the six-cylinder LS2. The station wagons were the four-cylinder LW1 and the V6 LW2. The base LS sedan, without a wagon counterpart, came equipped with a 5-speed manual transmission, manual windows and locks, air conditioning, and an AM/FM stereo. The LS1/LW1 added power windows, mirrors and locks with keyless entry, heated mirrors, and other comfort features. The LS2/LW2 featured additional standard amenities including fog lights, as well as the more powerful V6 engine and 4-speed automatic transmission; the latter was optional on the four-cylinder models. Anti-lock brakes with traction control was an option on all models.
*2001: For the 2001 model year, all of the L-Series received new model designations because of a naming dispute with Lincoln (Lexus also used the LS name at this time). The LS was renamed the L100, the LS1 became the L200, and the LS2 became the L300. For the station wagons, the LW1 was renamed the LW200 and the LW2 was renamed LW300. All models received a larger fuel tank () and shoulder belts for the center rear seat position. Head curtain side airbags became available later in the model year, but only on the sedans.

*2002: Anti-lock brakes with traction control were standard this year, along with curtain side airbags (sedans only). A new six-spoke chrome alloy wheel became available, as well as automatic air conditioning and a rear DVD entertainment later in the model year. The Saturn L100 was discontinued after the 2002 model year.
*2003: Sedans were facelifted, front and rear; wagons received the new front along with new taillights. Silver dash trim replaced wood trim, and a new available alloy wheel design (borrowed from Saab) were also both added for the 2003 model year. The L100 sedan was canceled, and anti-lock brakes with traction control were once again made optional.
*2004: Anti-lock brakes and traction control were standard again, the automatic air conditioning was discontinued (leaving all models with the manual air conditioning), and the manual transmission was dropped, leaving all models with a four-speed automatic. The &quot;L200&quot; and &quot;LW200&quot; names were discontinued; all L-Series sedan and wagon models were renamed &quot;L300,&quot; adopting a trim level structure like that of Saturn&#x27;s Ion compact. The previous L200/LW200 were now the L300.1, powered by the 2.2L Ecotec and having no available options. The L300.2 was powered by the 3.0L V6 and had the same range of options as before. The L300.3 got chromed alloy wheels and a standard power driver&#x27;s seat, and was unique in offering the &quot;Premium Choice Package.&quot; This offered the choice between OnStar, rear DVD entertainment, or (on sedans) a power sunroof at no extra charge.
*2005: Wagons were discontinued for this model year and the lineup was trimmed to one model, the L300.2 sedan. The only option was a power moonroof, as all other options were dropped to reduce production complexity. The last L300 rolled off the Wilmington Assembly line on June 17, 2004.

==Quality issues==
The L-Series was troubled early in production by a number of quality issues, often related to engine failures, transmission failures and overall fit and finish issues. Consumers reported repeat problems with tire noise and vibration linked to poorly designed control arm bushings and nonadjustable rear alignments. A retrofit kit was released to address these concerns.

In 2005, a recall was issued pursuant to a defect petition by the North Carolina Consumers Council, a consumer nonprofit advocacy organization, alleging repeat brake and tail light failures. The resulting recall affected more than 300,000 vehicles in the United States and Canada. Later that same year, the North Carolina Consumers Council petitioned for an investigation into timing chain failures and subsequent engine failures across the model lineup for vehicles using the 2.2L engine. The resulting recall affected only a small number of vehicles built in a four-month period in late 2000 and early 2001. The organization reported that complaints of engine failure due to a defective timing chain design persist to this day and requests for recall expansions have largely been ignored. The organization has gone so far as to make its first recommendation against the purchase of a vehicle in its more than forty-year history due in part to this timing chain defect.

<doc id="857893" wikidata="Q966877" url="?curid=857893" title="Saturn Vue">
<text>The Saturn Vue is a compact SUV that was built and marketed by Saturn, and it was Saturn&#x27;s best-selling model. It was the first vehicle to use the GM Theta platform when it was introduced in 2001 for the 2002 model year. The Vue was facelifted for the 2006 model year. A second generation model was launched in 2007 for the 2008 model year as a rebadged Opel Antara. 

Vue production in North America ended as GM discontinued the Saturn brand as part of the 2009 General Motors Chapter 11 reorganization.
==First generation (2002)==
The Vue was designed by Saturn and introduced for the 2002 model year. It was manufactured at the Spring Hill GM plant. Its unibody platform is shared with the Chevrolet Equinox, Pontiac Torrent, and the European Opel Antara. The first generation ran from 2002 through 2007.

The Vue was produced trim levels with a four-cylinder (I4) or V6 gasoline engine and a manual or automatic transmission. A Red Line trim was added starting with the 2004 model year. A Green Line (mild hybrid) was added for the final model year of the first-generation Vue (2007). Front Wheel Drive (FWD) and All Wheel Drive (AWD) were offered.
Four-cylinder Vues use the Ecotec I4. The L81 V6 from the L-Series and five-speed Aisin AF33 automatic transmission were initially offered, but starting in 2004, all six-cylinder Vues were equipped with Honda&#x27;s J35A3 engine and a Honda transmission. The four-cylinder Vue was available with the VTi continuously variable transmission (CVT) until GM canceled it for 2005 due to reliability issues.

The Vue received a facelift for the 2006 model year. Upgrades included a redesigned interior with higher-quality materials, a new bumper and grille, and some minor cosmetic pieces to the exterior. OnStar, cruise control, and automatic headlights became standard. However, GM badges were not added to the side of the vehicle until GM took over production from Saturn for the second generation Vue.

===Model year changes===
* 2003:
The FWD V6 configuration was offered part-way through the model year. This version included the L81 V6 engine with Aisin AF33 five-speed automatic transmission.

===Red Line===

Saturn introduced a high-performance line in 2004 named Red Line. This includes the same Honda J35A3 V6 as the regular model, but with suspension tuning that lowered the body by 1 inch, unique power steering calibration, 18 inch alloy wheels, ground-effect front and rear bumpers, unique rocker panel trim, chrome exhaust tip, special black leather and suede seats (optional for 2005, but standard for 2006 and 2007), footwell lighting (included with leather and suede seat package, not available with optional full-leather (heated front) seats), and a special gauge cluster. It also includes some interior features such as a higher quality audio system.

===Green Line===
The high-performance Vue Red Line was joined in 2007 by the Green Line model. The Green Line was a mild hybrid, or &quot;assist hybrid&quot;, using GM&#x27;s belt alternator starter (BAS) system. An electric motor connected to the crankshaft via a special accessory drive belt and the Green Line included a modified automatic transmission.

The start-stop system automatically stops the engine when the vehicle halts and instantly restarts it when the brake pedal is released. The electric motor assists somewhat during initial launch, providing torque smoothing, and during heavy acceleration. A 36-volt nickel metal hydride (NiMH) battery pack, located under the load floor, powers the BAS and also stores electricity from regenerative braking. The regenerative brake charging and electric motor assist functions are shown to the driver via an analog gauge on the dashboard, and real-time fuel-economy feedback is accomplished via an &quot;eco&quot; light that glows when the instantaneous fuel economy exceeds the published window sticker fuel economy rating.

The fuel savings are 20% up from the base vehicle&#x27;s / city/highway EPA sticker to /, the highest highway fuel economy of any 2007 model SUV sold in the U.S. market. In Canada, according to Saturn, the Vue achieved an estimated city and highway.

The Green Line has a 2.4 L Ecotec DOHC-phaser engine which replaced the standard 2.2 L I4 engine. The acceleration time was improved by 1.0 second. Pricing for the hybrid was about more than a similarly equipped Vue, and debuted in production form on January 8, 2006, at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit. The Green Line went on sale in the third quarter of 2006.

===Engines===
===Transmissions (first generation)===
===Safety===
In Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) crash tests the Vue receives a &quot;good&quot; overall rating in the frontal offset crash test. In 2008, models came equipped with standard front and rear head side curtain airbags and front seat-mounted torso airbags. These models were given an &quot;acceptable&quot; overall rating in side impacts. Models without side airbags were given an overall &quot;poor&quot; rating.

==Second generation (2008)==

Saturn introduced the second generation Vue in 2007 for the 2008 model year, manufactured at Ramos Arizpe Assembly in Mexico as a rebranded version of the German-designed Opel Antara. The front end featured a large chrome trim on the grille with &quot;teardrop-shaped&quot; headlights. The roof sloped downward to an angled rear hatch. GM badges were featured on the front doors.

; 2008:
The 2008 Vue was available in four trim levels: base XE, midgrade XR, top-of-the-line Red Line, and a Green Line hybrid. The XE included 16-inch wheels, body-colored door handles, and side mirrors, while the XR added chrome door handles, chrome-tipped dual exhaust, and 17-inch alloy wheels.

Engine options included a 2.4 L I4, hybrid 2.4 L I4, 3.5 L V6, or a 3.6 L V6. The V6 versions of the Vue come with conventional hydraulic power steering, replacing the previous electric assist; however, the I4-powered cars continued with electric power.

The Mexican-manufactured Vue was also marketed in Mexico and South America as the Chevrolet Captiva Sport, with only badges changed and a new grille insert.

; 2009:
Three trim levels: base XE, midgrade XR, and Red Line. The XE included 16-inch alloy wheels, keyless entry, a tilt steering wheel with audio controls and cruise control, a height-adjustable driver seat, and a CD/MP3 stereo with satellite radio. The XR added 17-inch alloy wheels, luggage rack rails, automatic climate control, a power driver seat, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, Bluetooth, and heated side mirrors. The Red Line featured 18-inch alloy wheels, a lowered suspension, a roof-mounted spoiler, chrome exhaust tips, and heated front seats with leather and suede upholstery.

; 2010:
2010 Saturn Vue was available in two trims, the base XE and the XR. Both were available with a I4 or a V6 engine, as well as front-wheel drive or all-wheel drive. The Vue Hybrid was equipped similarly to the XE Preferred package and available only with front-wheel drive powered by the 2.4 L I4 gas/electric engine with a 4-speed automatic transmission.

==Discontinuation==

Following the end of the Saturn brand in 2009 for the 2010 model year, the Vue was discontinued. However, GM continued to produce the Chevrolet Captiva Sport for the Mexican and South American markets until 2015. For the U.S. market, the Chevrolet Captiva Sport was imported from Ramos Arizpe and sold to commercial and fleet customers starting from late 2011 (for the 2012 model year) until U.S. imports ended in 2014.

<doc id="857894" wikidata="Q1968408" url="?curid=857894" title="Saturn Ion">
<text>The Saturn Ion is a compact car sold by Saturn between the 2003 and 2007 model years. Based on the GM Delta platform, the Ion replaced the Saturn S-Series in 2002,
and was replaced by the new Saturn Astra in 2008. Production of the Ion ended on March 29, 2007. The Ion was the last Saturn passenger car built at the Spring Hill, Tennessee plant which was originally linked to the company&#x27;s branding, with Saturn owners attending &quot;homecoming&quot; events at the plant.

== Trim levels ==

The Saturn Ion was offered in three trim &quot;Levels&quot;: Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3, as well as a &quot;Red Line&quot; trim (in later model years).

The Level 1 trim, only offered as a four-door sedan, was the entry-level Ion trim. It included features such as cloth seating surfaces, 14&quot; tires and steel wheels with plastic wheel covers, manual windows and door locks, an AM/FM stereo radio with a four-speaker audio system, a heater (no standard air conditioning), a 2.2L dual overhead cam (DOHC) inline four-cylinder (I4) gasoline engine, and a five-speed manual transmission. The Level 1 trim was discontinued in later model years of the Ion.

The Level 2 trim was the entry-level Quad Coupe trim, and the upgraded trim for the four-door sedan. It included features such as upgraded 15&quot; tires and steel wheels and plastic wheel covers, air conditioning, and an AM/FM stereo with a single-disc CD player (which also included an auxiliary audio input jack in later model years).

The Level 3 was the top-of-the-line trim for both the Quad Coupe and the four-door sedan. It added more convenience items such as power windows and door locks, keyless entry, 16&quot; tires and aluminum-alloy wheels, upgraded cloth seating surfaces, and an AM/FM stereo with both cassette and single-disc CD players (later, an AM/FM stereo with satellite option, a single-disc CD/MP3 player, and an auxiliary audio input jack).

The Red Line was the performance-oriented trim of the Ion, only available as a Quad Coupe. It featured a 2.0L supercharged I4 gasoline engine, a unique body kit and front grille, unique aluminum-alloy wheels, unique cloth seating surfaces, and a rear spoiler.

==History==

===2003–2004===
The 2003 Saturn Ion quad coupe production car first appeared at the 2002 New York International Auto Show. The 2003 Ion came standard with a 2.2 L DOHC Ecotec I4 engine. The Ion sedan went on sale in mid-October 2002, and the quad coupe went on sale in early 2003. The Ion&#x27;s instrument panel was mounted on the top center of the dashboard, rather than behind the steering wheel. The Ion is also available in sedan level 1, 2, or 3; level three signified a more user friendly setup with power windows and power locks, while lower levels included crank windows and plastic wheel covers. Other extras included fog lights, sunroof, and spoiler. The Saturn Ion Quad Coupe has half-sized rear clamshell doors while the sedan has conventionally hinged doors.

A Getrag F23 5-speed manual or an Aisin AF33 5-speed automatic transmission were available. The compact 5-speed automatic had several unique characteristics. The transmission lacked an overdrive, allowing for five forward gears to be packaged in the size of a typical four-speed manual gearbox, both providing close gear ratios for better acceleration and fuel efficiency while eliminating the heat and parasitic loss generated by the additional planetary gearset. The unit was also &quot;fill-for-life,&quot; meaning that it was not intended to be serviced for the life of the vehicle. The 2003 and 2004 Ion Coupes were available with the VTi continuously variable transmission or a Getrag F23 5-speed manual.

For 2004, Saturn also re-calibrated the electric power steering, as well as upgraded interior materials, and offered new sound systems.

===2005–2006===

In 2005, the Aisin 5-speed automatic transmission was discontinued. The VTi CVT used in the quad-coupes between 2002 and 2004 was also discontinued. GM&#x27;s 4-speed 4T45-E replaced both transmissions, becoming the only available automatic transmission option. The 2005 Ion sedan models also received a new steering wheel, the same one used in the 2004 Ion coupe models. In the middle of the 2005 model year, the seats in the base Ion1 model received upgraded fabrics and a height adjustment feature. &quot;Quiet Steel&quot; multilaminate sound-reduction technology was also introduced in 2005. Cosmetic changes included an upgraded fascia with a larger grille opening (2005-2007 Ion sedan models) and redesigned wheel covers and redesigned alloy wheel offerings. Under the hood, an acoustic engine cover was added to the engine bay to reduce noise emissions.

The Level 2 and Level 3 models were offered with GM&#x27;s new standard radio, featuring MP3 playback.

2006 saw the , torque, 2.4 L straight-four engine with variable valve timing become available for the Ion 3. The Ion went on to be discontinued after the 2007 model year.

===2007===
The 2.2-liter Ecotec engine in the 2007 Saturn Ion was improved over the previous year&#x27;s model: power output increased from to at 5600 rpm, and torque output increased from to at 4200 rpm. The new engine was fitted with the ECU from the 2.4-liter engine.

The 2.4-liter Ecotec received a similar upgrade: power increased by five horsepower to at 6500 rpm, and torque increased from to at 4800 rpm.

An &quot;Appearance Package&quot; was offered for the 2007 Ion 3 Quad Coupe, including redesigned front and rear bumpers, side moldings, elliptical fog lamps, and a chrome exhaust tip. The Recaro seats in the Red Line version were replaced with black leather-appointed seats, which featured a passenger-sensing system.

The Ion was discontinued after the 2007 model year, and replaced in Saturn&#x27;s lineup by the Saturn Astra hatchback, a rebadged Opel Astra H imported from Belgium.

The 2007 Ion was the last Saturn built at the Spring Hill, Tennessee plant.

=== Red Line Edition ===
In production from 2004 through the 2007 Model Year, Saturn produced the Red Line Sport Compact This engine/powertrain combination is also shared with the Chevy Cobalt SS Supercharged Edition, which did not start production until the 2005 model year. The Ion Red Line features most interior features from the standard Ion Coupe, including its rear clamshell doors, to allow accessibility to the rear seat.

Introduced for the 2005 model year was the optional Competition Package. Included in the Competition Package were 17&quot; Gunmetal Painted Alloy Rims, Ladder Tachometer w/ shift lights, a Limited Slip Differential, and Optional Projector-beam Fog Lamps. In mid-2006, GM released two Engine Kit upgrades for both the Ion Red Line and the Cobalt SS. The Stage 1 Kit retailed for around US$500, and included higher-flow fuel injectors and a recalibration to the ECU to increase the horsepower by to and of torque, up from the stock and . The Stage 2 Kit retailed for around $750 and opens up the middle of the power curve to more power than the Stage 1 Kit alone. In addition to everything that the Stage 1 Kit comes with, the Stage 2 Kit includes a smaller drive belt and pulley for the supercharger, bringing the engine up to and of torque. GM did release a Stage 1 to Stage 2 Upgrade kit that retailed for $400. This Upgrade Kit is for a Red Line with the Stage 1 kit already installed. This Upgrade Kit adds the Stage 2 elements and increases the horsepower from to .

On October 17, 2003 at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah, the Saturn Ion Red Line, piloted by the GM Performance Division&#x27;s &quot;Saturn Land Speed Record Project&quot; set a new land-speed record in the &quot;G/Blown Fuel Altered&quot; Class at 212.684 mph. This exceeded the previous record of 183.086 mph that was set in 2001.

Below are the production numbers for the Ion Red Line from 2004 to 2007.
===Discontinuation===

General Motors decided to discontinue the Ion after the 2007 model year. It was replaced by the 2008 Astra.

The Astra shares the Delta platform with the Ion, but is a captive import from Opel. While Opel offered the Astra in multiple body types, and with other performance options, Saturn did not import any of them – the Astra was only offered with a single base engine, and in 3-door and 5-door hatchback bodystyles only, in two trim levels. The Ion was the last Saturn to have brand-specific design cues originating with the S-Series such as plastic body panels.

==Safety==

===Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS)===

IIHS only tested the 4-door sedan version. It did not test coupe versions of the Ion.

===NHTSA===

===Recall===
In February 2014, the Ion was added to a list of General Motors cars recalled due to a faulty ignition switch. 13 deaths were found to have been caused by the defect in Chevrolet Cobalt models, prompting the recall of the Ion and other related GM vehicles.

<text>In applied mathematics, the complex Mexican hat wavelet is a low-oscillation, complex-valued, wavelet for the continuous wavelet transform. This wavelet is formulated in terms of its Fourier transform as the Hilbert analytic signal of the conventional Mexican hat wavelet:

:formula_1

Temporally, this wavelet can be expressed in terms of the error function,
as:

:formula_2

This wavelet has formula_3 asymptotic temporal decay in formula_4,
dominated by the discontinuity of the second derivative of formula_5 at formula_6.

This wavelet was proposed in 2002 by Addison &quot;et al.&quot; for applications requiring high temporal precision time-frequency analysis.

<text>In signal processing, time–frequency analysis comprises those techniques that study a signal in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously, using various time–frequency representations. Rather than viewing a 1-dimensional signal (a function, real or complex-valued, whose domain is the real line) and some transform (another function whose domain is the real line, obtained from the original via some transform), time–frequency analysis studies a two-dimensional signal – a function whose domain is the two-dimensional real plane, obtained from the signal via a time–frequency transform.

The mathematical motivation for this study is that functions and their transform representation are tightly connected, and they can be understood better by studying them jointly, as a two-dimensional object, rather than separately. A simple example is that the 4-fold periodicity of the Fourier transform – and the fact that two-fold Fourier transform reverses direction – can be interpreted by considering the Fourier transform as a 90° rotation in the associated time–frequency plane: 4 such rotations yield the identity, and 2 such rotations simply reverse direction (reflection through the origin).

The practical motivation for time–frequency analysis is that classical Fourier analysis assumes that signals are infinite in time or periodic, while many signals in practice are of short duration, and change substantially over their duration. For example, traditional musical instruments do not produce infinite duration sinusoids, but instead begin with an attack, then gradually decay. This is poorly represented by traditional methods, which motivates time–frequency analysis.

One of the most basic forms of time–frequency analysis is the short-time Fourier transform (STFT), but more sophisticated techniques have been developed, notably wavelets and least-squares spectral analysis methods for unevenly spaced data.

==Motivation==

In signal processing, time–frequency analysis is a body of techniques and methods used for characterizing and manipulating signals whose statistics vary in time, such as transient signals.

It is a generalization and refinement of Fourier analysis, for the case when the signal frequency characteristics are varying with time. Since many signals of interest – such as speech, music, images, and medical signals – have changing frequency characteristics, time–frequency analysis has broad scope of applications.

Whereas the technique of the Fourier transform can be extended to obtain the frequency spectrum of any slowly growing locally integrable signal, this approach requires a complete description of the signal&#x27;s behavior over all time. Indeed, one can think of points in the (spectral) frequency domain as smearing together information from across the entire time domain. While mathematically elegant, such a technique is not appropriate for analyzing a signal with indeterminate future behavior. For instance, one must presuppose some degree of indeterminate future behavior in any telecommunications systems to achieve non-zero entropy (if one already knows what the other person will say one cannot learn anything).

To harness the power of a frequency representation without the need of a complete characterization in the time domain, one first obtains a time–frequency distribution of the signal, which represents the signal in both the time and frequency domains simultaneously. In such a representation the frequency domain will only reflect the behavior of a temporally localized version of the signal. This enables one to talk sensibly about signals whose component frequencies vary in time.

For instance rather than using tempered distributions to globally transform the following function into the frequency domain one could instead use these methods to describe it as a signal with a time varying frequency.

: formula_1


Once such a representation has been generated other techniques in time–frequency analysis may then be applied to the signal in order to extract information from the signal, to separate the signal from noise or interfering signals, etc.

==Time–frequency distribution functions==
===Formulations===

There are several different ways to formulate a valid time–frequency distribution function, resulting in several well-known time–frequency distributions, such as:

*Short-time Fourier transform (including the Gabor transform),
*Wavelet transform,
*Bilinear time–frequency distribution function (Wigner distribution function, or WDF),
*Modified Wigner distribution function, Gabor–Wigner distribution function, and so on (see Gabor–Wigner transform).
*Hilbert–Huang transform

More information about the history and the motivation of development of time–frequency distribution can be found in the entry Time–frequency representation.

===Ideal TF distribution function===

A time–frequency distribution function ideally has the following properties:

#High resolution in both time and frequency, to make it easier to be analyzed and interpreted.
#No cross-term to avoid confusing real components from artifacts or noise.
#A list of desirable mathematical properties to ensure such methods benefit real-life application.
#Lower computational complexity to ensure the time needed to represent and process a signal on a time–frequency plane allows real-time implementations.

Below is a brief comparison of some selected time–frequency distribution functions.
To analyze the signals well, choosing an appropriate time–frequency distribution function is important. Which time–frequency distribution function should be used depends on the application being considered, as shown by reviewing a list of applications. The high clarity of the Wigner distribution function (WDF) obtained for some signals is due to the auto-correlation function inherent in its formulation; however, the latter also causes the cross-term problem. Therefore, if we want to analyze a single-term signal, using the WDF may be the best approach; if the signal is composed of multiple components, some other methods like the Gabor transform, Gabor-Wigner distribution or Modified B-Distribution functions may be better choices.

As an illustration, magnitudes from non-localized Fourier analysis cannot distinguish the signals:

: formula_2

: formula_3

But time–frequency analysis can.

== TF analysis and random processes ==
For a random process x(t), we cannot find the explicit value of x(t).

The value of x(t) is expressed as a probability function.

=== General random processes ===

* Auto-covariance function (ACF) formula_4
:formula_5 
:In usual, we suppose that formula_6 for any t,

:formula_7
:formula_8
:(alternative definition of the auto-covariance function)
:formula_9
* Power spectral density (PSD) formula_10
:formula_11
* Relation between the WDF (Wigner Distribution Function) and the PSD
:formula_12
:::::formula_13formula_14
* Relation between the ambiguity function and the ACF
:formula_15
:::::formula_16

=== Stationary random processes ===
* Stationary random process: the statistical properties do not change with t. Its auto-covariance function:
formula_17 for any formula_18, Therefore,
formula_19
formula_20PSD,
formula_21 White noise:
formula_22 , where formula_23 is some constant.
* When x(t) is stationary,
formula_24 , (invariant with formula_18)

formula_26
formula_27formula_28 , (nonzero only when formula_29) 

=== Additive white noise ===
* For additive white noise (AWN),
:formula_30
:formula_31

* Filter Design for a signal in additive white noise


formula_32: energy of the signal

formula_33 : area of the time frequency distribution of the signal

The PSD of the white noise is formula_34
formula_35

formula_36

=== Non-stationary random processes ===
* If formula_37 varies with formula_18 and formula_39 is nonzero when formula_29, then formula_41 is a non-stationary random process.
* If 
*# formula_42
*# formula_43&#x27;s have zero mean for all formula_18&#x27;s
*# formula_43&#x27;s are mutually independent for all formula_18&#x27;s and formula_47&#x27;s
:then:
::formula_48 

* if formula_49, then

::formula_50
::formula_51

=== Short-time Fourier transform ===
* Random process for STFT (Short Time Fourier Transform)
formula_52 should be satisfied. Otherwise, 
formula_53
formula_54for zero-mean random process, formula_55

* Decompose by the AF and the FRFT. Any non-stationary random process can be expressed as a summation of the fractional Fourier transform (or chirp multiplication) of stationary random process.

==Applications==

The following applications need not only the time–frequency distribution functions but also some operations to the signal. The Linear canonical transform (LCT) is really helpful. By LCTs, the shape and location on the time–frequency plane of a signal can be in the arbitrary form that we want it to be. For example, the LCTs can shift the time–frequency distribution to any location, dilate it in the horizontal and vertical direction without changing its area on the plane, shear (or twist) it, and rotate it (Fractional Fourier transform). This powerful operation, LCT, make it more flexible to analyze and apply the time–frequency distributions. The time-frequency analysis have been applied in various applications like, disease detection from biomedical signals and images, vital sign extraction from physiological signals, brain-computer interface from brain signals, machinery fault diagnosis from vibration signals, interference mitigation in spread spectrum communication systems.

===Instantaneous frequency estimation===

The definition of instantaneous frequency is the time rate of change of phase, or

: formula_56

where formula_57 is the instantaneous phase of a signal. We can know the instantaneous frequency from the time–frequency plane directly if the image is clear enough. Because the high clarity is critical, we often use WDF to analyze it.

===TF filtering and signal decomposition===

The goal of filter design is to remove the undesired component of a signal. Conventionally, we can just filter in the time domain or in the frequency domain individually as shown below.

The filtering methods mentioned above can’t work well for every signal which may overlap in the time domain or in the frequency domain. By using the time–frequency distribution function, we can filter in the Euclidean time–frequency domain or in the fractional domain by employing the fractional Fourier transform. An example is shown below.

Filter design in time–frequency analysis always deals with signals composed of multiple components, so one cannot use WDF due to cross-term. The Gabor transform, Gabor–Wigner distribution function, or Cohen&#x27;s class distribution function may be better choices.

The concept of signal decomposition relates to the need to separate one component from the others in a signal; this can be achieved through a filtering operation which require a filter design stage. Such filtering is traditionally done in the time domain or in the frequency domain; however, this may not be possible in the case of non-stationary signals that are multicomponent as such components could overlap in both the time domain and also in the frequency domain; as a consequence, the only possible way to achieve component separation and therefore a signal decomposition is to implement a time–frequency filter.

===Sampling theory===

By the Nyquist–Shannon sampling theorem, we can conclude that the minimum number of sampling points without aliasing is equivalent to the area of the time–frequency distribution of a signal. (This is actually just an approximation, because the TF area of any signal is infinite.) Below is an example before and after we combine the sampling theory with the time–frequency distribution:

It is noticeable that the number of sampling points decreases after we apply the time–frequency distribution.

When we use the WDF, there might be the cross-term problem (also called interference). On the other hand, using Gabor transform causes an improvement in the clarity and readability of the representation, therefore improving its interpretation and application to practical problems.

Consequently, when the signal we tend to sample is composed of single component, we use the WDF; however, if the signal consists of more than one component, using the Gabor transform, Gabor-Wigner distribution function, or other reduced interference TFDs may achieve better results.

The Balian–Low theorem formalizes this, and provides a bound on the minimum number of time–frequency samples needed.

===Modulation and multiplexing===

Conventionally, the operation of modulation and multiplexing concentrates in time or in frequency, separately. By taking advantage of the time–frequency distribution, we can make it more efficient to modulate and multiplex. All we have to do is to fill up the time–frequency plane. We present an example as below.
As illustrated in the upper example, using the WDF is not smart since the serious cross-term problem make it difficult to multiplex and modulate.

===Electromagnetic wave propagation===

We can represent an electromagnetic wave in the form of a 2 by 1 matrix

: formula_58

which is similar to the time–frequency plane. When electromagnetic wave propagates through free-space, the Fresnel diffraction occurs. We can operate with the 2 by 1 matrix

: formula_59

by LCT with parameter matrix

: formula_60

where &quot;z&quot; is the propagation distance and formula_61 is the wavelength. When electromagnetic wave pass through a spherical lens or be reflected by a disk, the parameter matrix should be

: formula_62

and

: formula_63

respectively, where ƒ is the focal length of the lens and &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the disk. These corresponding results can be obtained from

: formula_64

===Optics, acoustics, and biomedicine===
Light is an electromagnetic wave, so time–frequency analysis applies to optics in the same way as for general electromagnetic wave propagation. 

Similarly, it is a characteristic of acoustic signals, that their frequency components undergo abrupt variations in time and would hence be not well represented by a single frequency component analysis covering their entire durations.

As acoustic signals are used as speech in communication between the human-sender and -receiver, their undelayedly transmission in technical communication systems is crucial, which makes the use of simpler TFDs, such as the Gabor transform, suitable to analyze these signals in real-time by reducing computational complexity. 

If frequency analysis speed is not a limitation, a detailed feature comparison with well defined criteria should be made before selecting a particular TFD. Another approach is to define a signal dependent TFD that is adapted to the data.
In biomedicine, one can use time–frequency distribution to analyze the electromyography (EMG), electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiogram (ECG) or otoacoustic emissions (OAEs).

==History==
Early work in time–frequency analysis can be seen in the Haar wavelets (1909) of Alfréd Haar, though these were not significantly applied to signal processing. More substantial work was undertaken by Dennis Gabor, such as Gabor atoms (1947), an early form of wavelets, and the Gabor transform, a modified short-time Fourier transform. The Wigner–Ville distribution (Ville 1948, in a signal processing context) was another foundational step.

Particularly in the 1930s and 1940s, early time–frequency analysis developed in concert with quantum mechanics (Wigner developed the Wigner–Ville distribution in 1932 in quantum mechanics, and Gabor was influenced by quantum mechanics – see Gabor atom); this is reflected in the shared mathematics of the position-momentum plane and the time–frequency plane – as in the Heisenberg uncertainty principle (quantum mechanics) and the Gabor limit (time–frequency analysis), ultimately both reflecting a symplectic structure.

An early practical motivation for time–frequency analysis was the development of radar – see ambiguity function.

<doc id="857898" wikidata="Q2555029" url="?curid=857898" title="No Exit (Blondie album)">
<text>No Exit is the seventh studio album by American rock band Blondie, released on February 15, 1999, by Beyond Music. It was the band&#x27;s first album in 17 years and features the UK number-one single &quot;Maria&quot;. As of March 2006, the album had sold two million copies worldwide.

==Overview==
As was customary for a Blondie album, &quot;No Exit&quot; dabbled in many genres, including pop, reggae, country, and hip hop. Mike Chapman, who had produced all but the first two of Blondie&#x27;s previous albums, produced some of the early demos for the album, though final production of the album fell to Craig Leon.

A cover of the Shangri-Las&#x27; 1965 song &quot;Out in the Streets&quot; was included on the album. It was originally recorded by the band in 1975 while they were trying to get a record deal. The demo version was first issued on EMI&#x27;s 1994 anthology &quot;The Platinum Collection&quot; and was later included on the 2001 remastered version of the band&#x27;s eponymous debut studio album.

A comeback promotional tour, the No Exit Tour, was launched preceding the release of the album, which spanned 13 months and visited Europe, North America and Oceania.

==Release and reception==
&quot;No Exit&quot; reached number three on the UK Albums Chart, and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) for sales in excess of 100,000 copies. It was preceded by the single &quot;Maria&quot;, which became Blondie&#x27;s sixth UK number one, exactly 20 years after the band&#x27;s first number one, &quot;Heart of Glass&quot;, making them the first American band to have chart-topping UK singles in three different decades: 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. A second single, &quot;Nothing Is Real but the Girl&quot;, peaked at number 26 on the UK Singles Chart. The title track, &quot;No Exit&quot;, was released as a limited-edition third single in Europe, and is a fusion of classical, hip hop and rock, and featured raps by Mobb Deep, Coolio, U-God, and Inspectah Deck. &quot;Screaming Skin&quot; was released as a promo single in the US in late 1999.

The album was released in several editions in different countries with various bonus tracks, mainly live versions of songs recorded during the band&#x27;s No Exit Tour. The album was also reissued in 2001 along with all of Blondie&#x27;s other studio albums.

Chris Stein commented on the title of the album in a 2004 interview: &quot;The title was taken from a Sartre play, which says there&#x27;s no madness in individuals, it&#x27;s all in groups. I think that&#x27;s probably what all these reality TV shows are about. Maybe we were a reality TV show before there was reality TV.&quot;

The album was not available on streaming platforms or digital music stores for several years, most likely because of a possible dispute in licensing or distribution rights, although the song &quot;Maria&quot; from the album could still be found on these platforms and stores on compilation albums. &quot;No Exit&quot; and its follower &quot;The Curse of Blondie&quot; (2003) were added to all streaming platforms on November 16, 2023.

<doc id="857899" wikidata="Q7653622" url="?curid=857899" title="Swanndri">
<text>Swanndri is a trade name for a range of popular New Zealand outdoor clothing, and also used informally to refer to their original long heavy bush shirt.

The classic &quot;swanny&quot; or bush shirt is a heavy, hooded, woollen garment with a lace up section at the neck. Although a wide range of colours and patterns are available, the traditional swanny pattern is a dark tartan which could be described as a &#x27;reverse gingham&#x27;, with thick criss-crossing stripes of either blue or red over a black base. The item was widely worn by farmers, but in recent years its popularity has spread and it has become something of a fashion item.

The Swanndri company also now produces a range of more urban-focussed garments.

==History==

The Swanndri, or &quot;swanny&quot; as it has been dubbed, was designed by William Broome (1873–1942). Since he registered Swanndri as a trademark on 23 December 1913, it has become an iconic New Zealand garment, and the term &quot;swanny&quot; has, to some extent at least, become a genericised trademark for heavy bush shirts within New Zealand.

Broome, born in Staffordshire, England, emigrated to New Zealand at age 21. A tailor by trade, he established a clothier and outfitters business, &quot;The Palatine&quot;, which was located on Devon Street, New Plymouth. Part of his business involved sewing woollen fabric from mills in Wanganui, Kaiapoi and Wellington, into the Swanndri garments. The characteristics of the &quot;swanny&quot; design include its heavy dark fabric, often in a tartan pattern, hood and laced neck closure. In more recent designs, a zip has replaced the lace-up neck.

The original design was short sleeved, long in the back, and would be worn on top of work clothes for warmth and shower proofing. During production, these garments were dipped into a secret mixture and then dried. It is not known if Broome had been taught the method for shower proofing the fabric he used or whether he developed the formula himself. The mixture caused the garments to shrink unevenly so were sold as one size fits all.

In 1938, Broome transferred the business to his wife, Ivy. Broome himself died four years later aged 69 years. In 1952, Ivy sold the business and trademark to John McKendrick, who operated a clothing factory at Waitara. McKendrick began purchasing fabric that was closely woven and pre-shrunk which enabled him to make different pattern sizes and garments. He sourced his cloth from South Island-based Alliance Textiles, and the business expanded with factories in Waitara and Ōpunake. Alliance Textiles bought the Swanndri trademark in 1975 and later the whole company in 1990, moving production from their factories in Timaru. In 1994, Swanndri New Zealand Ltd purchased the brand from Alliance Textiles.

According to Swanndri&#x27;s corporate history, Broome&#x27;s design began after he was frustrated by the persistently rainy New Zealand weather. The name Swanndri was named by Broome because the rain would literally run off the back of the garment as it does on a swan. Although new colours and features have been incorporated into the Swanndri, Broom&#x27;s original design influence can still be seen in New Zealand and among other producers around the world.

==Recent history==
Swanndri has been outsourcing its production to China since 2005. While the packaging and postage reinforces the NZ connection, the labelling says &quot;Final construction in China to Swanndri NZ standards&quot;. Thus, the manufacturer no longer qualifies for Buy NZ Made.

<text>Hardware stores (in a number of countries, &quot;shops&quot;), sometimes known as [[Do it yourself|DIY]] stores, sell household hardware for home improvement including: fasteners, building materials, hand tools, power tools, keys, locks, hinges, chains, plumbing supplies, electrical supplies, cleaning products, housewares, tools, utensils, paint, and lawn and garden products directly to consumers for use at home or for business. Many hardware stores have specialty departments unique to its region or its owner&#x27;s interests. These departments include hunting and fishing supplies, plants and nursery products, marine and boating supplies, pet food and supplies, farm and ranch supplies including animal feed, swimming pool chemicals, homebrewing supplies and canning supplies.

== Australia and New Zealand ==

In Australia hardware stores specialise in home décor and include large selections of paint. There are three major hardware companies in Australia: Bunnings, Mitre 10 and Home Hardware. Home Hardware is a retailers&#x27; co-operative and has many banners which store owners trade under.

Since the acquisition of Bunnings by Wesfarmers in 1994, the big-box store concept has changed how new hardware stores are built. In 2004, Mitre 10 built its first supercentre Mitre 10 MEGA with an average store size of 13,500 m2. These were later either closed or turned into large-concept Mitre 10 stores. In 2011 Masters Home Improvement entered the market and opened more than 49 stores, with an average footprint of 13,500 m2. Masters Home Improvement, which was the second-largest hardware chain in Australia, closed in December 2016.

Bunnings also operates in New Zealand, competing against Mitre 10 New Zealand and Hammer Hardware. The Australian Bunnings and Mitre 10 Mega format have also been introduced to New Zealand.

==Canada==
Home Hardware, Rona, Canac, BMR Group and Réno-Dépôt are Canadian hardware retailers. Aikenhead&#x27;s Hardware became the Canadian unit of The Home Depot in 1994. Canadian Tire, Central, Kent Building Supplies, Lowe&#x27;s and many smaller chains also sell hardware in Canada.

==China==
Most hardware stores in China, whether in the city or rural areas, are small, family-owned, non-franchise companies. They provide similar products to Western hardware stores, including plumbing and electrical supplies, tools, and some housewares. They do not normally carry lumber, fishing supplies, gardening products, or boating supplies. Some rural hardware stores supply animal feed, such as chicken feed.

Common to most non-Western countries, China has specialty hardware stores, dedicated to selling products in a particular category. These stores are usually grouped together in a shopping district. Examples are groups of stores that specialize in:
*Chain, carrying different sizes of chain, couplings, lifting hooks, cutters, etc.
*Generators and compressors, selling parts, hoses, plus products and tools related the maintenance and repair of generators and compressors.
*Tubing and metal rods of various sizes and materials.
*Large power tools, with accessories.
*Electrical wire and wire rope, electrical switches, fuse boxes, wire rope sockets, clamps, and thimbles.

==United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom, hardware stores can be known as ironmongers, DIY stores and home improvement stores. British retail chains include B&amp;Q, Homebase, and Wickes. Australian hardware chain Bunnings opened their first shop in St Albans in February 2017 and planned to convert several other Homebase shops into pilot Bunnings shops after acquiring them in February 2016.

==United States==
Larger hardware stores may also sell building supplies including lumber, flooring, roofing materials and fencing. Such stores are often referred to as home-improvement centers or home centers.

There may be fewer hardware stores in the US now than in the past, but according to the US Census Bureau, there were still 14,300 hardware stores in the US in 2005, employing on average 10 employees each. Despite competition from large chain stores (commonly referred to as big-box or destination hardware stores, e.g., The Home Depot, Lowe&#x27;s and Menards) new hardware stores in the US continue to open.

There are four major nationwide wholesale suppliers to hardware stores. All four report more than US$1 billion in annual sales. Two of them operate as retailers&#x27; cooperatives: Do It Best Corp, from Fort Wayne Indiana, and Ace Hardware from Oakbrook Illinois. Hardware store owners purchase stock in these suppliers and may choose to include the name of the cooperative in the advertised name of the store.

Hardware stores also purchase from a variety of regional wholesalers and specialty manufacturers. Some hardware stores operate rental businesses which can offer equipment from construction tools to inflatable playhouses. The major hardware cooperatives provide brand name rental advertising and support for hardware store owners including Just Ask Rental, Party Central, Grand Rental Station and Taylor Rental, all four of which are brands owned by the True Value Company.

Elwood Adams Hardware of Worcester, Massachusetts claims to be the oldest operating hardware store in the US, having begun business in 1782.

===Unique services in hardware stores===
Part of the popularity of American hardware stores is the range of services they provide. Most retail outlets only sell goods, while some hardware stores custom-make or repair a large variety of household items. It is common for a hardware store in the US to repair broken windows and screens, repair power equipment such as lawn mowers, re-key entry locks, make copies of house keys and car keys, re-wire lamps and vacuum cleaners, sharpen knives and cutting tools, make minor repairs to faucet and shower parts, repair kerosene heaters and cut and thread plumbing pipe.

===Hardware industry trade association===
The North American Retail Hardware Association (NRHA) is a membership organization that provides training and resources for hardware store owners and publishes a trade magazine in print and online.

==Europe and the Middle East==

European-based stores include:

* Arabesque / BudMax / Mathaus
* Bauhaus
* Biltema
* Brico
* Brico Dépôt
* Bricorama
* Bricostore
* Castorama
* Clas Ohlson
* Dedeman
* EpiCentre K
* Formido
* Gamma
* Hornbach
* Hubo Belgium
* Hubo Netherlands
* Karwei
* Leroy Merlin
* Mr. Bricolage
* Obi
* Praktiker
* Praxis
* Puuilo
* SACO Hardware


==India==

In India hardware stores are mostly small businesses, with no major store chains that carry a large selection of products. Stores lack ample floor space compared to their Western counterparts, but are usually stocked with a wide variety of items.

Indian hardware stores are similar to hardware stores around the world, offering products from several categories such as plumbing, machinery, household, gardening, manufacturing, cobbler, carpenter, and electrical.

== Pakistan ==
Hardware stores in Pakistan vary from small family-owned shops to large wholesale markets. Major cities like Karachi, Lahore, and Islamabad have well-established hardware markets catering to contractors, electricians, and DIY enthusiasts.

Some of the well-known hardware markets in Pakistan include:

* Lighthouse Market (Karachi) – Specialises in electrical supplies, plumbing, and tools.
* Hall Road (Lahore) – A hub for electronic and hardware supplies.
* Rawalpindi Saddar Market – Offers a wide range of construction and industrial hardware.

Many stores import tools and materials from China, the UAE, and Europe, while local manufacturers also contribute to the supply chain. The rise of e-commerce platforms like Daraz and OLX Pakistan has also enabled online hardware sales.

<doc id="857907" wikidata="Q5599180" url="?curid=857907" title="Great Fire of 1892">
<text>The Great Fire of 8 July 1892 in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador is remembered as the worst disaster ever to befall that city. Previous &quot;Great Fires&quot; had occurred in St. John&#x27;s, during 1819 and 1846.

==Timeline==
At approximately 4:45 in the afternoon of July 8, 1892, a dropped pipe in Timothy O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s stable, atop Carter&#x27;s Hill on Freshwater Road, began what would become the worst fire in the history of St. John&#x27;s. Initially, the fire did not cause any widespread panic; however, a series of catastrophic coincidences caused the fire to spread and devour virtually all of the east end of the city, including much of its major commercial area, before being extinguished.

Rev. Moses Harvey witnessed the initial stages of the fire, and remarked to his friend that it &quot;was a bad day for a fire.&quot; A high wind from the northwest was blowing, hurling the sparks far and wide on the roofs of the clusters of wooden houses. For a month previous, hardly any rain had fallen, and the shingled roofs were as dry as tinder.&quot; The situation was exacerbated because of work completed earlier in the day on the water mains. Although water flow was re-established by 3 p.m., two hours before the fire began, water pressure was insufficient to force water up into the higher sections of the city where the fire began. W.J. Kent remarked that the &quot;flames therefore made headway before water was procurable and, as a very high westerly wind was furiously fanning the fire, it began to spread rapidly.&quot;

An hour into the blaze, the people of St. John&#x27;s realized that the fire could not be contained in the area of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s farm. Because locals believed stone walls would withstand the flames, residents moved valuables into numerous stone buildings in the city. One of the most common refuge areas was the Anglican Cathedral of St. John the Baptist. The nave and transepts of the church were filled with valuable property belonging to numerous families, including that of the Anglican bishop Lleweyn Jones. The cathedral and much of this property were also destroyed by the ravenous fire. Kent described the burning of the cathedral as follows:

The fire was far from finished; the wind caused offshoots of the main fire to consume new sections of the city while the main fire continued its destructive trek towards the city&#x27;s commercial centre, Water Street. The businesses that lined Water Street and Duckworth Street were destroyed as the fire spread throughout the downtown area.

Rev. Harvey said, 
&quot;The beautiful shops, full of valuable goods; the stores behind, containing thousands of barrels of flour and provisions of all kinds; the fish stores; the wharves, which it had cost immense sums to erect, -- disappeared one by one into the maw of the destroyer...the whole of Water Street, on both sides, was &#x27;swept with the besom of destruction.&#x27;&quot;

The fire continued to burn into the night and the early hours of the next morning. Rev. Harvey&#x27;s description of the restless night said that &quot;the terror-stricken inhabitants flying before the destroyer,… the cries of weeping women hurrying with their children to places of safety -- all constituted a scene which not even the pen of Dante could describe.&quot;

Similarly, Kent said of that night,

Daybreak on the morning of July 9, 1892 revealed the full extent of the fire&#x27;s devastation. Kent described the sight of local residents viewing the desolation:

Rev. Harvey presents a similar description:

Less than $5,000,000 of the total estimated losses of $13,000,000 were covered by insurance. A large influx of financial aid from Britain, Canada and the United States helped the city recover from its devastating losses.

Many of the present-day registered heritage structures were either built or re-built in the reconstruction period after the 1892 fire. The most prominent architect of this era in St. John&#x27;s was John Thomas Southcott. He designed numerous Second Empire-styled buildings that had distinctive mansard roofs with bonnet-topped dormers protruding from the concave-curved roof surface. Southcott was so prolific that the term the &quot;Southcott style&quot; became associated with the architecture in the re-built city. Each year in Southcott&#x27;s honour, the Newfoundland Historic Trust presents the Southcott Award for excellence in the restoration of heritage structures.

Because of the devastation of the fire, the city of St. John&#x27;s reorganized its fire department. It had previously relied only on volunteer brigades. By the end of 1895, the city had hired 22 paid firefighters and established three new fire stations throughout the city. Control of the fire department was placed under Newfoundland Constabulary’s Inspector-General.

<text>Lake Goodwin is a lake in Snohomish County, Washington, United States. The surrounding census district of Lake Goodwin, Washington is named after the lake.

The lake is the largest and by far the most popular of the &quot;Seven Lakes&quot; area northwest of Marysville, Washington. Wenberg County Park is the main public access to the lake. In 1996, Snohomish County bought a formerly privately owned resort on the north tip of the lake, and is working on developing it into a park.

<text>Josiah Pugh Wilbarger (September 10, 1801 – April 11, 1845) was an early Texan who lived for twelve years after being scalped by Comanche Indians.

==Early life==
He was born in Rockingham County, Virginia, and moved to Kentucky in 1818. Wilbarger moved to Pike County, Missouri, in 1823 and married Margaret Barker in September 1827. They left for Texas soon after the wedding and reached what is now Matagorda County on December 26. Wilbarger was a teacher at Matagorda for a year before moving to La Grange, where he taught and surveyed until he settled in Stephen F. Austin&#x27;s colony in a bend of the Colorado River, some ten miles above the site of present Bastrop, Texas.

==The scalping==
In August 1833, Wilbarger was a member of a surveying party that was attacked by the Comanche about four miles east of the site of present Austin, Texas. Josiah and another man were struck by bullets and arrows and scalped by the Comanches. The third member managed to flee. A rescue party found Wilbarger, who had been left for dead, the next day.

<doc id="857918" wikidata="Q1172084" url="?curid=857918" title="Saliva (album)">
<text>Saliva is the debut studio album by American nu-metal band Saliva. The album was recorded during several sessions between January and July 1997 at Rockingchair Recording Studios in Memphis, Tennessee, and released on Rockingchair Records on August 26, 1997. It is their only album to feature original drummer Todd Poole, who would leave in 1999 and was replaced by Paul Crosby.

==Re-Issue (2003)==
Following the major record label success of the band, after the release of &quot;Every Six Seconds&quot; (2001) and &quot;Back Into Your System&quot; (2002), Rockingchair Records made a manufacturing and distribution deal with Diamond Productions and RED Distribution imprint RUMM (RED Urban Music Marketing). The re-issue came out in 2003 with identical audio content but featured updated artwork. The front cover was completely redesigned and features a woman&#x27;s face with her eyes closed, playing off the artwork of &quot;Every Six Seconds&quot;. The CD face was also altered from an all-black background on the original to a crackled texture on the re-issue. The booklet and back cover remained mostly identical with few exceptions; a different font was used for the text, the alignment was improved, the contact information was changed and there is a slight color shade difference: while the original issue had a more blue-ish gray tone, the re-issue has a more green-ish gray tone. The re-issue version&#x27;s artwork was also designed and updated by Brandon Seavers, who had by this time bought out the multi-media company Audio MasterWorks with Mark Yoshida and renamed it AudioGraphic MasterWorks.

==Appearances==
Four songs originally recorded for &quot;Saliva&quot; were later re-recorded with producer Bob Marlette and mixed by John Goodmanson and Steve Thompson as part of the band&#x27;s major record label Island Records debut &quot;Every Six Seconds&quot; in 2000. The four songs were &quot;Beg&quot;, &quot;Greater Than Less Than&quot;, &quot;Pin Cushion&quot; and &quot;800&quot;. &quot;Beg&quot; and &quot;Greater Than Less Than&quot; appeared on &quot;Every Six Seconds&quot;, however &quot;Pin Cushion&quot; and &quot;800&quot; were cut from the album and kept as b-sides. The re-recording of &quot;Pin Cushion&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the Canadian werewolf horror film &quot;Ginger Snaps&quot; in 2000, while &quot;800&quot; appeared on the soundtrack to the American horror film &quot;Resident Evil&quot; in 2002.

When Saliva released its greatest hits compilation &quot;Moving Forward in Reverse: Greatest Hits&quot; in 2010, &quot;Saliva&quot; was the only release not to be showcased.

<text>Yelena Nikolayevna Baturina (; born 8 March 1963) is an international billionaire businesswoman and a philanthropist of Russian origin. She is based in Austria. She was married to Yury Luzhkov, mayor of Moscow (from 1992 to 2010), until his death in 2019.

In 1991, she founded Inteco, an investment and construction company. According to &quot;Forbes&quot;, with a fortune of $1.2 billion, she was the richest woman in Russia, until Tatyana Bakalchuk overtook her spot in February 2020 with $1.4 billion.

==Biography==
Baturina is a Moscow native who began working as a design-technician at the (where her parents worked) after graduating from high school.

* 1980–1982: the Frazer plant, technician-designer, then senior design engineer of the Chief Technologist Department;
* 1982–1989: Institute of Integrated Economic Development of Moscow, researcher; Russian Union of United Cooperatives, head of the Secretariat; the Mosgorispolkom Commission on cooperative activity, senior specialist.
* since 1989 engaged in private business activities;
* 1991–1994: LLP &quot;Inteco&quot;, director;
* 1994–2011: CJSC &quot;Inteco&quot;, president;
* 2006–2011: deputy head of the interdepartmental working group on the priority national project &quot;Affordable and Comfortable Housing to Russian citizens&quot;, a member of the commission on the development of affordable housing under the President of the Russian Federation on the implementation of priority national projects and demographic policy.

Baturina met her future husband, Yury Luzhkov, in 1987 when they were both serving at Mosgorispolkom, a Soviet-era municipal commission. At the period of their co-working the relationships were purely professional. In one of her interviews Baturina remembers: &quot;We never even thought about anything like that when we were working together, it all happened much later&quot;. Baturina and Luzhkov married in 1991. The next year, he became mayor of Moscow. In 2010, he was dismissed by President Dmitry Medvedev amidst still unproven accusations of corruption and mismanagement voiced on state run television.

After her husband&#x27;s dismissal, Baturina moved to London. She explains the choice of the city by the fact that her two daughters decided to study in London

In November 2010, Luzhkov gave an interview to the Telegraph newspaper stating that the couple was sending their daughters to study in London to protect them from possible persecution from the Russian authorities. He also said that a house had been rented in the west of the city for them and that he and his wife intend to visit them regularly. Luzhkov also claimed that the Russian authorities were planning to break up Baturina&#x27;s business empire and that the couple would fight the attempt: &quot;We will not give up. My wife will battle for her business and for her honour and self-worth. That is for sure&quot;.

In September 2009, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; erroneously stated that Witanhurst, a large house in Highgate, North London, had been bought by Baturina, via an offshore front company. Baturina sued the papers owners, Times Newspapers, a subsidiary of News International. Times Newspapers apologized for the story and paid damages to her in October 2011.

==Career==

=== Inteco ===
In 1989, Baturina launched her first enterprise with her elder brother Victor, primarily dealing with computer software and hardware. In 1991 Baturina founded her company, Inteco (&quot;Inteko&quot; (Интеко) in Russian), which focused on construction though it began as a plastics business. In 1994, Inteco purchased a plastic factory. In 1998, the company won the contract for producing 85,000 seats for Luzhniki Stadium, Moscow&#x27;s largest stadium. The critics claimed that the decision was affected by Luzhkov as Mayor of Moscow, though Inteco stated that their price was 50% less than their nearest competitor&#x27;s.

In the middle of 1990s, Inteco entered the construction business focusing on development of advanced materials and technologies for facade work, cement, brick and poured concrete construction, architectural design and real estate business.

In 2001, Inteco acquired from a private person the controlling stake in one of the leading housebuilding factories in Moscow DSK-3. Following modernization the construction plant provided 500,000 square meters of housing per year. This acquisition, according to Baturina&#x27;s interviews, became the starting point for the company&#x27;s major construction activity. &quot;DSK-3 is my first real step into construction. I had been viewing the market for a long time. I saw how quickly and dynamically it was developing, how many opportunities it was offering. Still the deal took place sort of accidentally. The lawyers of the former main owner&#x27;s widow came to me and said that some unfriendly entities were questioning her property rights and trying to simply rob her of her stake. And the frightened woman had decided to sell all the shares to Inteco on the condition that we defend her rights in court. We have successfully managed that and just like that, almost by accident, became the owners of the plant.&quot;

At one point, Inteco was said to control 20% of construction in the capital. However, according to experts, quoted by media, from 2000 to 2010 of construction activities Inteco&#x27;s share in the state order was no more than 2%. While the main contractors for the implementation of the Moscow government orders were construction companies MFS-6 (24.5%) Glavmosstroy (20.7%), SU-155 (13.7%) and MSM-5 (12.2%). In 2002, Inteco created a subsidiary &quot;Strategy Construction Company&quot;, whose main objective was the construction of monolithic buildings. Such cement plants as &quot;Podgorensky cementnik&quot; and &quot;Oskolcement&quot;, one of the largest cement producers in the central Russia, were also bought at that time.

In 2005, Inteco sold its cement works for estimated US$800 000 to Eurocement Group in order to consolidate financial and administrative recourses that the company needed for the implementation of perspective construction programs.

In 2006, Baturina was appointed Deputy Head for the inter-ministerial group under the national project &quot;Affordable and Comfortable Housing for Russian citizens&quot;.

Shortly afterwards, Inteco sold DSK-3, a producer of prefabricated buildings, as well and fully concentrated on the construction of monolithic housing and commercial real estate.

Part of the proceeds from the sale of these assets were directed by Baturina to buying some high-yield &quot;blue chips&quot; of the largest Russian companies such as Gazprom and Sberbank. This step allowed the visionary businesswoman to later sell the shares in the crisis year of 2009 at a significant profit and return Inteco&#x27;s earlier business development bank loans ahead of schedule, which allowed to keep the businesses afloat. The interest rate on loans at that time sprang up from 10.8 to 18 percent, which led to the ruin of a significant number of Russian developers.

At the same time, as part of a new cement project, Inteco purchased Verkhnebakansky Cement Plant and the Atakaytsement cement factory located in the Krasnodar region.

As of 2007, the company owned such entities as Inteko Plast (55%), Bistro Plast (50%), construction firms SK DSK-3 (100%), Styre (100%), Inteco CENTER (100%), Inteco Chess (Elista, 100%), Intekostroy (70%). The company also owned enterprises in the city of Sochi - Park (100%), The Matrix (100%), Sochi AO (75.58%), Horizont (50%), Selectioner (Belgorod region., 100%) and Uspensky Agromashplast (Moscow reg., Uspensky, 38%). Inteco Group also included Russian Zemelny Bank and trading house Moscow River involved in the supply of grain.

In 2007, the company&#x27;s revenue, according to its own data, amounted to $1 billion.

At the end of 2008, along with Gazprom and Russian Railways, Inteco was included into the list of 295 strategic enterprises of the country.

In 2009, the company begins cooperating with an outstanding Spanish architect Ricardo Bofill as part of the programme aimed at creating fundamentally new systems for mass housing in Russia.

In 2010, Inteco launched the construction of the second academic building for the Moscow State University named after Lomonosov.

In 2010, Baturina was named one of the largest taxpayers in Russia, the taxes to the state budget for 2009 amounted to 4 billion rubles. As of 2009, 99% of the company is owned by Baturina, 1% is on the balance sheet of the Company itself. The project development portfolio is more than 7,000,000 square meters, the cement capacities exceed 0.6 million tons per year.

At the end of 2010, Baturina sold its Russian Zemelny Bank (RZB) to foreign investors.

The most significant completed projects of Inteco in Moscow (in the period of company Baturina&#x27;s ownership) are: the residential quarter &quot;Shuvalov&quot; (270,000 square meters), the residential quarter &quot;Grand Park&quot; (400,000 square meters), the residential site &quot;Volga&quot; (400,000 square meters), the multifunctional complex &quot;Fusion Park&quot; with the &quot;Autoville&quot; - museum of unique cars from private collections (100,000 square meters), the Fundamental Library (60,000 square feet), and the academic building for Humanities (100,000 square meters) of the Moscow State University.

After her husband&#x27;s resignation, Baturina started selling her assets in Russia. The best offer was filed by Mikail Shishkhanov and Sberbank Investments. They bought the 95% and 5% shares of Inteco correspondingly. The exact amount of the transaction was never disclosed, but the report of Sberbank stated that according to the experts that participated in the preparation of the deal, the market value of Inteco, its projects and structures was around 1.2 billion dollars. The deal did not include the cement plants of Inteco. One of them was later sold to Lev Kvetnoy for estimated 17 billion rubles.

===Hotel business===
The first development in the new hotel chain was the five-star Grand Tirolia Golf &amp; Ski Resort, located in the heart of the Eichenheim golf club in Kitzbühel, Austria. Construction, which was completed in 2009, cost in the region of €35–40 million. The hotel is located in the center of the golf club Eichenheim, together they make Grand Tirolia Golf &amp; Ski Resort. In 2009, the hotel achieved honorary status as the &quot;Home of Laureus&quot; in Austria, and became the official venue for the annual ceremony of the prestigious international award that those in the field call the &quot;Oscar&quot; of sports journalism. In 2018, the hotel was sold to the Austrian investor, presumably for €45 million.

In 2010, Baturina opened the New Peterhof Hotel in Saint Petersburg, which received a number of architectural awards. In 2012, following major reconstruction work, Baturina opened the Quisisana Palace in Karlovy Vary, Czech Republic. Housed in a late 19th century building, the hotel combines elements of Neo-Renaissance and Neo-Gothic styles. The restoration of the historic building required significant investment. The hotel is a member of the Small Luxury Hotels of the World association. In 2013, Baturina opened the Morrison Hotel in Dublin, Ireland. She bought it from NAMA in early 2012 for €22 million. The 138-room hotel on Dublin&#x27;s Lower Ormond Quay has undergone a €7 million refurbishment. It was sold in 2022 to Zetland Capital for €65 million.

Baturina has announced her intentions to the press to continue to expand her hotel chain. &quot;In the future, we think of making up hotel clusters in those regions where we are already present. These are Ireland - United Kingdom, Northern Italy - Austria - Germany, the Baltic States - Russia - Kazakhstan,&quot; Baturina said in her interview to &quot;Sobesednik&quot;.

===Development business===
In late 2015, Baturina set up an office in New York to oversee her US$10 million investment into commercial buildings she acquired in central Brooklyn, and look into the prospects of developing a construction project: “The company is considering transferring the land they are located on to a category suitable for residential construction, so that a large-scale development project can be realised.”

In November 2016, Baturina&#x27;s structures launched a construction and development project in Europe. Her company acquired a land plot on the coastline of Limassol, Cyprus. The construction of high-end apartment building Symbol Residence was launched in 2019, the overall investment into the project has exceeded EUR 40 million, and the completion of the construction was planned for 2021.

=== Membrane Construction ===
In autumn 2015, Baturina&#x27;s structures became a strategic investor of Hightex GmbH, a global membrane construction company based in Rimsting, Germany.

=== Renewable energy ===
Since 2014, Baturina&#x27;s Investment Group has been developing a project to generate, use and market renewable energy in Europe. In 2018, Baturina&#x27;s enterprise has launched the first ESCO (Energy Services Company) project in Cyprus.

===Brother===
In 2007, Viktor Baturin, Baturina&#x27;s brother, with whom she founded Inteco, sued Inteco for US$120 million for wrongful dismissal.

The court dismissed all the claims later that year.

After that, in 2011 he was found guilty by the Presnensky Court of Moscow in a real-estate fraud case and got a 3 years suspended sentence.

In 2013, the Nikulinsky Court of Moscow sentenced him for attempting to cash in forged Inteco promissory notes worth more than 5 billion rubles. He was released in January 2016, with the unserved time of his sentence replaced with a fine.

In 2017, another case was initiated against Viktor Baturin for attempted fraud of a large scale and two counts of evidence falsification in a civil case. In 2021 he was formally accused and arrested. In 2022, Viktor Baturin pleaded guilty to fraud and falsification of evidence and in November 2023, found guilty by the Simonovsky court of Moscow and sentenced to six years imprisonment and a fine of 500 thousand rubles.&lt;ref name=&quot;RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allegations of criminal links ===
According to leaked diplomatic cables, the US ambassador to Russia, John Beyrle, reported allegations that Baturina had links to major criminal groups, particularly Solntsevskaya Bratva. The full text of the cable makes clear that Mr Beyrle is simply repeating gossip and allegations conveyed to him by journalist Sergei Kanev. Beyrle writes, &#x27;Kanev told us that Luzhkov&#x27;s wife, Yelena Baturina, definitely has links to the criminal world, and particularly to the Solntsevo criminal group&#x27;. Beyrle stated that her husband Yury Luzhkov sat on top of a &quot;pyramid of corruption&quot;. &quot;Luzhkov oversees a system in which it appears that almost everyone at every level is involved in some form of corruption or criminal behaviour,&quot; wrote Beyrle. &quot;Analysts identify a three-tiered structure in Moscow&#x27;s criminal world. Luzhkov is at the top. The FSB, MVD and militia are at the second level. Finally ordinary criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level.&quot; Beyrle also suggested that much of Luzhkov&#x27;s business empire had been acquired using municipal finances to invest in &quot;less than transparent&quot; projects with former Soviet republics. The couple denied the accusations as &quot;total rubbish&quot;.

BE OPEN is a cultural and social initiative set up in 2012, and funded by Elena Baturina with the “aim to harness the brainpower of creative leaders through a system of conferences, competitions, exhibitions, master classes and art events.”

“A long-term, international, multidisciplinary, multi-faceted project, BE OPEN is committed to becoming a bridge between the great minds of our time – philosophers, sociologists, designers, architects, artists, publishers, writers, businessmen and opinion leaders — and the promising new minds of the next generation. It also strives to help leading contemporary thinkers and creatives meet up with those in the media and business, discuss their ideas and visions and ultimately make change happen.”

The foundation was launched at Milan Design Week 2012. Working in collaboration with leading design publication Interni, the foundation had significant presence at the Fuori Salone.

BE OPEN revisited Milan Design Week in 2013 with a multi-sensory experience, with a focus on synaesthesia, exploring the overlap between colour and taste, smell and sight represented in the House of the Senses, designed by French architect Christophe Pillet and in 2015 with a mesmerizing Garden of Wonders exposition dedicated to redesigning defunct perfume brands.

In 2014, with support from the Government and ministries of India, BE OPEN created an important exhibition of works by promising local designers in Delhi to encourage artisans to explore alternative ways of using traditional skills and keeping them alive. “Made in…India” became an important milestone for many of the participating designers.

== Personal life ==
In 1991, Baturina married Yury Luzhkov. In 1992 their first daughter, Elena, was born, followed in 1994 by Olga. In November 2010, Luzhkov gave an interview to the &quot;Telegraph&quot; newspaper stating that the couple were sending their daughters to study in London to protect them from possible persecution by the Russian authorities. Elena Baturina owns a house in Aurach, Austria, and spends a lot of her time there.

It is understood that the family owns a home in the affluent Kensington area of London, purchased in 2013 through an offshore company domiciled in Gibraltar. The property, near Holland Park, was reported in 2018 to be worth at least £25 million. In her interviews Baturina often said that she and Luzhkov were very lucky, as they still loved each other. She enjoys cooking his favourite dish, borscht, and claims that a traditional &quot;Soviet upbringing&quot; made a good housewife of her.

Baturina has had no contacts with her brother since a public conflict on business issues that occurred in 2007.

She was involved in a libel case against a former financial director for her brother. After failing to appear before a court in December 2019, the court declared Baturina a &quot;fugitive&quot;. The subpoena was rescinded in late January by Elista City Court. Allegedly, the subpoena was issued under instruction from the A1 investment company as part of its financial claim to Elena Baturina. In May 2021, Viktor Baturin, his financial director and his representatives have lost their final case in a series of litigations in the Tverskoy District Court of Moscow. As of today, Viktor Baturin is in a detention facility in Moscow, he was detained for a suspected attempt at fraud and admitted committing the crime.

In 2017, another case was initiated against Viktor Baturin for attempted fraud of a large scale and two counts of evidence falsification in a civil case. In 2021 he was formally accused and arrested. In 2022, Viktor Baturin pleaded guilty to fraud and falsification of evidence and in November 2023, found guilty by the Simonovsky court of Moscow and sentenced to six years imprisonment and a fine of 500 thousand rubles.

In 2020, Forbes announced that Baturina&#x27;s position as the richest woman in Russia was overtaken by Tatyana Bakalchuk, the founder of Wildberries, with a net worth of $1.4 billion.

According to Forbes, Baturina&#x27;s net worth was US$4.2 billion in 2008, up from US$3.1 billion in 2007, US$2.3 billion in 2006 and US$1.1 billion in 2004. According to magazine Finans, her wealth fell during the credit crunch to just US$1 billion in February 2009, causing her to ask the Russian government for a bailout for Inteko. Her wealth, as of 2012, was listed as US$1.1 billion.

Up to early 2010s, she owned the &quot;Veedern&quot; horse breeding estate founded in the 18th century. In 2020, Alexander Luzhkov, Yury Luzhkov&#x27;s son from his previous marriage, became the sole owner of the estate. After a major reconstruction the estate is now successfully breeding Hanoverian and Trakehner horses.

In 2011, Baturina won a lawsuit against the British newspaper &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, which attributed to the Russian businesswoman the acquisition of Witanhurst estate in London, which is the second value after Buckingham Palace. As a result, the newspaper published a retraction and apologized.

<doc id="857929" wikidata="Q3655843" url="?curid=857929" title="Fyodor Matyushkin">
<text>Fyodor Fyodorovich Matyushkin (; - ) was a Russian navigator, Admiral (1867), and a close friend of Aleksandr Pushkin, who studied with him at the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum. 

Matyushkin graduated from Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum in 1817. After having volunteered for the navy, he participated in Vassili Golovnin&#x27;s world cruise on the ship &quot;Kamchatka&quot; in 1817–1819.

In 1820–1824, Matyushkin took part in Ferdinand Wrangel&#x27;s Arctic expedition to the East Siberian Sea and the Chukchi Sea. They explored and mapped Chetyrekhstolbovoy Island, the southernmost of the Medvyezhi Islands, then an almost unknown island group. Following this survey Matyushkin explored on his own a vast tundra area east of the Kolyma river and collected valuable ethnographic data.

In 1825–1827, he joined Ferdinand von Wrangel in his world cruise on the ship &quot;Krotky&quot;. In 1828–1829, Matyushkin took part in the Russo-Turkish war, commanding different military vessels. In 1835, he served in the Black Sea Fleet, in 1850—1851 — in the Baltic Fleet. Starting from 1852, Matyushkin worked in the Department of the Navy as an admiral. In 1858, he was appointed Chairman of the Naval Scientific Committee. In 1861, Matyushkin became a senator.

In 1825, before Matyushkin&#x27;s second round-the-world voyage, Pushkin addressed him in his poem &quot;October 19th&quot;.

<text>When the [[Social Democratic Party of Canada]] broke away from the Socialist Party of Canada in 1911, many Winnipeg SPC members joined the new organization. The new party&#x27;s platform was written by three residents of the city (Richard Rigg, Herman Saltzman and Jacob Penner), and it has been estimated that nearly 20% of the SDPC&#x27;s total membership lived in Winnipeg during the early 1910s.

The party was more pragmatic than the SPC, and cooperated with reformist labour groups. It benefited from the relative weakness of the SPC in Winnipeg following the provincial election of 1910. The SPC had contributed to reformist Fred Dixon&#x27;s defeat in this election, and was shunned by many in the city&#x27;s trade union movement as such.

In the provincial election of 1914, the SDPC ran Arthur Beech and Herman Saltzman as candidate&#x27;s for Winnipeg North&#x27;s two ridings. Both candidates were defeated, due in part to the SDPC&#x27;s insistence that further immigration to the city be curtailed in a time of high unemployment (Winnipeg North was home to many recent immigrants).

The party fared better in the election of 1915, when Richard Rigg was elected for Winnipeg North&#x27;s second seat. Rigg had defended the city&#x27;s immigrant population in the past, and was elected despite strong SPC opposition. Beech finished a close second in the other Winnipeg North seat. Both of the SDPC&#x27;s candidates were also endorsed by the Labour Representation Committee, a reformist organization.

Rigg did not remain in parliament long, resigning in 1917 to contest Winnipeg North at the federal level. This time, he was endorsed by reformist labourites and Liberal supporters of Wilfrid Laurier because of his opposition to conscription. Support for the war was strong in western Canada, however, and Rigg was defeated by a supporter of Robert Borden&#x27;s Union government.

Labour radicalism in Winnipeg increased after the General Strike in 1919. In the following year&#x27;s provincial election, the Dominion Labour Party, SPC and SDPC were able to present a united slate of candidates in Winnipeg, running a combined total of ten candidates for the city&#x27;s ten seats (which were determined by preferential balloting). John Queen was the sole Social Democrat on the ballot, and was declared elected to the legislature.

The SPDC joined the Federated Labour Party in 1920. Queen was re-elected as an &quot;Independent Workers&quot; candidate in 1922, and became leader of the province&#x27;s Independent Labour Party caucus the following year.

<doc id="857948" wikidata="Q4357610" url="?curid=857948" title="Generalized other">
<text>The generalized other is a concept introduced by George Herbert Mead into the social sciences, and used especially in the field of symbolic interactionism. It is the general notion that a person has of the common expectations that others may have about actions and thoughts within a particular society, and thus serves to clarify their relation to the other as a representative member of a shared social system.

Any time that an actor tries to imagine what is expected of them, they are taking on the perspective of the generalized other.

An alternative name of the mentally constructed idea of who an audience is without real or complete insight is imagined audience.

==Precursors==

Mead&#x27;s concept of the generalised other has been linked to Adam Smith&#x27;s notion of the impartial spectator – itself rooted in the earlier thinking of Addison and Epictectus.

Adam Smith wrote: &quot;We Conceive ourselves as acting in the presence of a person quite candid and equitable, of one who...is meerly a man in general, an impartial Spectator who considers our conduct with the same indifference with which we regard that of other people&quot;.

==Role-play and games==

Mead began by contrasting the experience of role-play and pretence in early childhood, in which one role simply gives way to a different one without any continuity, with that of the organised game: &quot;in the latter&quot;, he stated, &quot;the child must have the attitude of all the others involved in that game&quot;. He saw the organised game as vital for the formation of a mature sense of self, which can only be achieved by learning to respond to, and take on board, the others&#x27; attitudes toward the (changing) common undertakings they are involved in: i.e. the generalized other.

Mead argued that &quot;in the game we get an organized other, a generalized other, which is found in the nature of the child itself...in the case of such a social group as a ball team, the team is the generalized other in so far as it enters – as an organized process or social activity – into the experience of any one of the individual members of it&quot;.

By seeing things from an anonymous perspective, that of the other, the child may eventually be able to visualize the intentions and expectations of others, and see him/herself from the point of view of groups of others – the viewpoint of the generalized other.

The attitude of the generalized other is the attitude of the larger community. According to Mead, the generalized other is the vehicle by which we are linked to society.

==Multiple generalized others==

Arguably, a modern differentiated society contains as many generalized others as there are social groupings: as Mead put it, &quot;every individual member of any given human society, of course, belongs to a large number of such different functional groups&quot;. The result is that everybody will articulate aspects of the range of socio-cultural values in their own way, taking on the perspectives of a set of generalized others in a unique synthesis.

With rising levels of socialisation and individuation, more and more people, and more and more aspects of the self come into play in the dialectic of self and generalized other.

==Psychoanalytic equivalents==

As a concept, the generalised other is roughly equivalent to the idea of the Freudian superego. It has also been compared to Lacan&#x27;s use of the Name of the Father, as the third party created by the presence of social convention, law, and language in all human interaction. It is also similar to Bakhtin&#x27;s (Superaddressee) &quot;superaddressee&quot; presumed to receive and understand human communication.

== Imagined Audiences in Social Media ==
Specifically referencing modern social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, Eden Litt and Eszter Hargittai explain that the imagined audience refers to a mental construct people form of their audience without real insight into who is actually consuming their online content.

This disconnect between a user&#x27;s imagined audience and actual audience is affected by social norms and context, and could play a large role on impression management — if a user believes their audience is composed of certain people, they may curate their social media feed and image to reflect this belief. Notably, academic scholar Jacqueline Vickery found in a study that her informants attempted to dissociate themselves from peers they considered &quot;ghetto.&quot; Since her informants were aware that Facebook friend connections are visible to everyone, those who were worried about associating with certain people then needed to maintain online distance by declining those friend requests.

Scholar danah boyd argues that the &quot;imagined audience ... resembles the concept of the White audience inherent to respectability politics; namely, that one must be able to successfully perform a White-defined bourgeois self to achieve upward mobility.&quot; The relationship between the dominant, acceptable social norms and intersections of class, gender, racial, or ethnic norms creates tension when managing impressions for both the imagined audience and the invisible audience.

As sharing on social media continues to become more commonplace, the imagined audience will continue to play a role in how people choose to represent themselves on different platforms. For instance, a study on impression management in online dating found that participants had to navigate mediating conflict between the pressures of impression management and their desire to present an authentic sense of self. Other similar studies have also found that there are significant instances of misrepresentation in online dating: 86% of participants in one study felt that other members of their dating sites misrepresented their physical appearance. Misrepresentation, particularly on sites where participants are looking for companionship and love, could be explained by the idea of the imagined audience — as participants form the idea of who is actually viewing their profiles, they may cater their own online representation to be more appealing.

<doc id="857960" wikidata="Q4998807" url="?curid=857960" title="Burial vault (enclosure)">
<text>A burial vault (also known as a burial liner, grave vault, and grave liner) is a container, formerly made of wood or brick but more often today made of metal or concrete, that encloses a coffin to help prevent a grave from sinking. Wooden coffins (or caskets) decompose, and often the weight of earth on top of the coffin, or the passage of heavy cemetery maintenance equipment over it, can cause the casket to collapse and the soil above it to settle.

==Description and usage==

The burial vault or burial liner is designed to prevent the weight of earth or heavy cemetery maintenance equipment from collapsing the coffin beneath. Coffin collapse will cause the ground to sink and settle, marring the appearance of the cemetery and making it harder to maintain. Burial vaults originally emerged as a means of ensuring that grave robbers could not easily access a coffin and remove valuables, clothing, or even bodies from the coffin. Early vaults were made of wood (the &quot;rough box&quot;), although by the middle of the 1800s brick, iron and later steel vaults were used. By the late 1800s, the fashion of burying the deceased with jewelry lost favor. However, the value of burial vaults in ensuring that the ground did not settle over graves was seen, and burial vaults began to be more widely used. By the early part of the 20th century, concrete (and, later, reinforced concrete) vaults became more common.

The burial vault was largely unknown until the 1880s when the L.G. Haase Manufacturing Co., which owned a cemetery in Illinois, conceived the burial vault as a means of adding a product line to their funerary sales. As late as 1915, only 5 to 10 percent of funerals in the United States used a burial vault or liner. In the 1930s, company owner Wilbert Haase, who had an interest in Egyptian mummification, began promoting the sealed (or &quot;waterproof&quot;) vault as a means of allegedly protecting the body from water, microbes, and vermin. The Haase company later purchased several plastics companies, and began manufacturing plastic burial vaults as well. The company dominates the American burial vault market today, with about 12 percent of all vault and liner sales.

A burial vault encloses a coffin on all four sides, the top, and the bottom. Modern burial vaults are lowered into the grave, and the coffin lowered into the vault. A lid is then lowered to cover the coffin and seal the vault. Modern burial vaults may be made of concrete, metal, or plastic. Because the sides of the burial vault are attached to the bottom of the vault, the burial vault is generally stronger than a burial liner. Some burial vaults reverse the construction, so that only a base is placed beneath the coffin. The lid consists of the four sides and the top. These types of burial vaults allow a better seal between the lid and base.

A burial liner is similar to a burial vault, but does not have a bottom. With a burial liner, the coffin is lowered directly onto the earth. The burial liner is then lowered over the coffin. Modern burial liners may also be made of concrete, metal, or plastic. Many come in a wide array of colors, even stripes.

Burial vaults do not prevent the decomposition of the human remains within. Vaults which are installed incorrectly and too tightly sealed may not allow gases generated by the decomposing body to escape. Pressure then builds up within the vault until the vault ruptures, causing the vault to fail. Although some manufacturers of burial vaults claim that their vaults are &quot;green&quot; (environmentally friendly) and prevent the toxic chemicals used in embalming from leaching into the surrounding soil, such claims are uniformly false since the vault cannot be hermetically sealed without causing it to rupture from the pressure of decomposing gases. A truly &quot;green&quot; or natural burial does not use embalming fluids, and does not attempt to protect the body from the soil and rapid decomposition.

Modern burial vaults often come in a variety of styles, which can greatly increase the cost. Modern vaults and liners sometimes are lined on the inside with bronze, copper, fiberglass, or stainless steel sheeting, and some vaults and liners are inscribed on the outer surface with words, scenes, or other images.

Some jurisdictions require the use of a burial vault or burial liner. For example, several U.S. states require them. In some cases, cemeteries require the use of a burial vault or liner, although it is not a legal requirement.

==World usage==
Data on the use of burial vaults and liners outside the United States is very difficult to come by, and usage rates are not known. Burial vaults and liners are almost unheard of in China and Japan. Cremation is required in China, and is used in 90 percent of burials in Japan. They are also uncommon in Italy. In modern Italy, burial plots (either below-ground or in wall loculi) are re-used after a period of years, usually 10 to 25. At that time, most of the soft body parts have decomposed, and the bones are removed to an ossuary.

In the United States, the use of burial vaults is also decreasing, caused by a sharp rise in the number of cremations. Whereas 36 percent of all deceased were cremated in the United States in 2008, the National Association of Funeral Directors forecast this to rise to 46 percent by 2015 and 59 percent by 2025.

Jewish law does not bar the use of burial vaults or liners, and their use is permitted where law or a cemetery requires them. But Morrison David Bial argues that burial vaults are antithetical to traditional Judaism, in part because they deny the reality of death (e.g., inhibit decomposition of the body) and in part because they are ostentatious and undercut the equality of all people at death.

Islamic law requires only that the body be washed, anointed, and wrapped in linen for burial. Funerals must be kept simple, and no ostentation is allowed. Preferably, the body should be buried without coffin or burial vault, although such is permitted if required by law. Generally, Muslims prefer to have separate cemeteries due to the specific preference for burial without coffin or vault.

==Criticisms==
Burial vaults and liners do not decompose, and have been criticized as being environmentally unfriendly. Burial vaults and liners consumed more than of steel and more than of reinforced concrete in 2009.

A burial vault or liner is not the only solution to settling earth over the grave. Traditional burials with a casket leave a larger void and thus create more settlement when the casket decomposes or collapses. Natural or &quot;green&quot; burials do not use a casket, which means only minimal settling. In either case, the cemetery can remedy sunken graves by filling in the settled area.

<text>The Vietnam Navy Gallantry Cross () was a military decoration of South Vietnam which was issued during the years of the Vietnam War. The Navy Gallantry Cross was awarded to any member of the military who displayed meritorious or heroic combat while engaged in naval operations to benefit South Vietnam. The medal was awarded both for combat and non-combat service and was the equivalent of the United States Legion of Merit.

The Navy Gallantry Cross was also awarded to members of foreign military forces, provided that such service members were engaged in direct operational support of Vietnam and that such naval actions benefitted the Vietnamese military. Officers of the United States Navy were frequently awarded the Navy Gallantry Cross.

Similar decorations existed for general service and air service, and were known as the Vietnam Gallantry Cross and Vietnam Air Gallantry Cross. These were separate decorations from the Vietnam Navy Gallantry Cross which came in three different grades: with gold anchor, silver anchor, and bronze anchor.

<text>The Dominion Labour Party (DLP) was formed in Canada in 1918 in opposition to Canadian participation in World War I. The party enjoyed its greatest success in the province of Manitoba.

In March 1918, Arthur Puttee and members of the Winnipeg Trades and Labour Congress (TLC) created the first branch of the Dominion Labour Party in Canada. The DLP was an ideological successor to various other reformist labour groups in Winnipeg, but was more explicitly socialist and actively cooperated with members of the Social Democratic Party of Canada. The Winnipeg local included such figures as Harry Veitch, Fred Tipping, and Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) Fred Dixon. In the years after its formation, the DLP would set up other branches in cities throughout the Canadian prairies. It never had a strong central organization, and was more of a network than an organized movement.

The Winnipeg General Strike of 1919 radicalized labour politics in Manitoba, and the DLP soon emerged as a much stronger force than the province&#x27;s earlier labour parties had been. In the provincial election of 1920, the party formed an electoral alliance with the Socialist Party of Canada, the Social Democrats and a party representing returning ex-soldiers. Dixon easily topped the polled in Winnipeg, and eight other Labour MLAs were elected throughout the province (along with one Socialist and one Social Democrat).

Among the new Labour MLAs were William Ivens, then serving a prison sentence, and A. E. Smith, who later joined Communist Party of Canada. Strictly speaking, not all of these figures were elected as Dominion Labour Party candidates: Smith, though a member of the DLP, campaigned under the banner of the &quot;Brandon Labour Party&quot;. The DLP, however, provided the basic framework around which the provincial campaign was based. Dixon was the unquestioned leader of the labour group in the legislature.

Late in 1920, the DLP split between followers of the American Federation of Labor and the One Big Union. When AFL supporters nominated an opponent of the General Strike as a DLP municipal candidate in Winnipeg, many others walked out and formed the rival Independent Labour Party. Dixon, who had previously been neutral, was the leader of the late 1920 walkout. Most other labour parliamentarians also left the DLP for the ILP, with Smith as the only prominent exception.

The ILP subsequently became the dominant labour party in Manitoba. The DLP aligned itself with the new Canadian Labour Party, and soon ceased to exist in the province as an independent organization.

<text>Sergei Kuzhugetovich Shoigu (born 21 May 1955) is a Russian politician and military officer who has served as secretary of the Security Council since 2024. He served as Minister of Defence of Russia from 2012 to 2024. Shoigu has served as the chairman of the Council of Ministers of Defense of the Commonwealth of Independent States since 2012.

Shoigu was the Minister of Emergency Situations from 1991 to 2012. He briefly served as the governor of Moscow Oblast in 2012. A close confidant and ally of Vladimir Putin, Shoigu belongs to the &quot;siloviki&quot; of Putin&#x27;s inner circle. He was entrusted with the task of supervising the invasion of Ukraine since 2022. A feud between Shoigu and Yevgeny Prigozhin led to a mutiny by the Wagner Group in June 2023. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Shoigu on charges of alleged war crimes during the invasion of Ukraine.

In May 2024, Putin replaced Shoigu with Andrey Belousov as defense minister, appointing the former to be the secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation.

== Early life and education ==
Shoigu was born on 21 May 1955 in Chadan, Tuvan Autonomous Oblast, to an ethnic Tuvan father, newspaper editor Kuzhuget Shoigu (1921–2010) and a Ukrainian-born Russian mother, Alexandra Yakovlevna Shoigu (1924–2011). Alexandra Shoigu grew up in the Donbas town of Kadiivka and had traumatizing experiences while under detention of the German occupation forces during World War II. Later in her career she became a member of the Tuva Regional Council of People&#x27;s Deputies. Kuzhuget Shoigu rose to secretary of the Tuvan Regional Committee of the Communist Party, becoming a major figure in the Communist power structure of the republic.

After graduating from Kyzyl Number 1 School in the Tuvan ASSR, Shoigu studied at the Krasnoyarsk Polytechnic Institute. Shoigu graduated in 1977 with a degree in civil engineering.

== Early career and first steps in CPSU ==
Shoigu worked in construction projects nationwide for the next decade, advancing from low levels to become an executive. In 1988, Shoigu became a minor functionary in the Abakan branch of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, and then in the Komsomol for a few years. In 1990, Shoigu moved to Moscow from Siberia, and was appointed deputy chairman of the State Architecture and Construction Committee of the Russian Federation, assisted by his father&#x27;s connections. Future president Boris Yeltsin had held a similar position in the Construction Committee, and had also come from a civil engineering and party background, so Shoigu gained Yeltsin&#x27;s trust.

== Minister of Emergency Situations (1991–2012) ==
In 1991, Yeltsin appointed him head of the newly established Russian Rescue Corps, responsible for the rescue and disaster response system. The Rescue Corps replaced the previous Soviet civil defense system and soon absorbed the 20,000-strong militarized Civil Defense Troops of the Ministry of Defense, with Shoigu being appointed chairman of the State Committee of the Russian Federation for Civil Defense, Emergency Situations, and Disaster Response. Civil Defense remained a quasi-military organization in continuation of Soviet practice and Shoigu was politically involved, such as an unsuccessful attempt to evacuate Russian-backed Afghan president Mohammad Najibullah in 1992 and the intended distribution of weapons from the Civil Defense stocks to Yeltsin supporters during the October 1993 coup. In keeping with the militarized nature of Russian civil defense, Shoigu received the rank of major general in 1993, and was promoted swiftly to lieutenant general in 1995, colonel general in 1998, and to army general, in practice the highest Russian military rank, in 2003. The committee was renamed the Ministry of Emergency Situations (&quot;MChS&quot;) in 1994, making Shoigu a government minister. He became popular because of his hands-on management style and high visibility during emergency situations, such as floods, earthquakes and acts of terrorism. Under Shoigu, the responsibilities of the ministry were expanded to take over the Russian State Fire Service in 2002, making the &quot;MChS&quot; Russia&#x27;s third-largest force structure.

In 1999 he became one of the leaders of the Russian pro-government party Unity, created by the Kremlin in opposition to the anti-Yeltsin elites of the Fatherland – All Russia alliance. Unity allowed for the rise of Vladimir Putin to president and in 2001 was combined into the ruling United Russia party, although Shoigu was the only delegate to vote against the merger. In 1999, Shoigu was awarded Russia&#x27;s most prestigious state award: Hero of the Russian Federation.

In March 2009, he proposed a law that would criminalize criticism of Soviet military tactics during World War II, which resulted in large numbers of Soviet casualties.

== Governor of Moscow Oblast (2012) ==
With over twenty years of service as Minister of Emergency Situations, Shoigu established a close relationship with Vladimir Putin, and was rewarded by being appointed Governor of Moscow Oblast in 2012, taking office on 11 May of that year.

== Minister of Defence (2012–2024) ==

On 6 November 2012, Shoigu was appointed Minister of Defence by Putin, succeeding Anatoly Serdyukov, who had implemented sweeping reforms of the Russian Armed Forces in response to performance in the Russo-Georgian War. According to expert Sergey Smirnov, the so called &quot;Petersburg group&quot; of siloviki (Sergei Ivanov, Sergey Chemezov and Viktor Ivanov) had wanted one of its associates to succeed Serdyukov, but Putin was reluctant to strengthen the clan and opted for the neutral Shoigu. As defence minister, Shoigu on multiple occasions accompanied Putin during weekend breaks that the pair would spend at undisclosed locations in the Siberian countryside.

Serdyukov was unpopular with senior military leaders and seen by them as a civilian with no military background, something that Shoigu attempted to address by symbolically tying himself to the military through wearing an army general&#x27;s uniform, reviving historical units dissolved under the reforms, and reinstating officials dismissed by Serdyukov. Furthermore, Shoigu appealed for support for reform within the army rather than taking a confrontational stance, appointed deputy ministers of defense from the military, and removed Serdyukov-appointed civilian tax service officials from the top echelons of the Ministry of Defense.

As defence minister, Shoigu continued aspects of Serdyukov&#x27;s attempts at modernizing the Russian Armed Forces through reform. This included the creation of the Special Operations Forces Command to facilitate rapid intervention in conflicts within the perceived Russian sphere of influence and counterterrorism efforts. Serdyukov&#x27;s goals of increasing the share of the Russian Armed Forces made up of professional contract servicemen rather than conscripts continued under Shoigu. However, the demographic challenge of a decreasing pool of military-aged and -eligible males forced him to increase national conscription quotas in early 2013, including even North Caucasians perceived as a security risk by authorities such as Chechens. This followed on from Serdyukov&#x27;s initiatives of reducing available draft exemptions.

In November 2012, Shoigu decided to resurrect the tradition of Suvorov and Nakhimov cadets participating in the 9 May parade.

In July 2013 Shoigu ordered commanders to begin every morning in the barracks with a rendition of the Russian anthem, to compile an obligatory military-patriotic book reading list and to take responsibility for the preparation of demobilization albums (a type of memento scrapbook, which in Russian military tradition is given to conscripts upon completion of their service). In August 2013 he ordered all Defense Ministry civilian workers, other staff and management employees to wear uniforms.

In February 2014, Shoigu said Russia was planning to sign agreements with Vietnam, Cuba, Venezuela, Nicaragua, the Seychelles, Singapore, and several other countries either to house permanent military bases and/or to house airplane refueling stations in those countries. Over the next year, only an agreement with Vietnam was effectively signed.

=== Activities related to treaties and military exercises ===

From early 2013 the Shoigu ministry made use of snap exercises as a means to ensure combat readiness of the Eastern Military District, the Western Military District, and the Central Military District. Already in 2015 western observers mentioned the Vienna Document while they spoke of &quot;the deteriorating European security environment.. producing an action-reaction cycle involving Russia, NATO and other European countries, all seeking to demonstrate the readiness of their armed forces.&quot;

In March 2015 Russia under Shoigu&#x27;s defence ministry halted all activities related to the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.

In October 2016 Shoigu hosted 56 representatives from 31 different OSCE nations, with Shoigu stating that the observers &quot;had a chance to see with their own eyes that Russia had fully implemented its obligations on ensuring confidence and security in Europe&quot;. The observers were also shown new weapons deployed to the Russian Aerospace Force, Ground and Airborne Forces. The previous visit of the OSCE observers took place in 2011.

=== Activities related to the revolution in Ukraine ===

In July 2014, Ukraine opened a criminal case against Shoigu. He was accused of helping to form &quot;illegal military groups&quot; in Eastern Ukraine who at the time fought against the Ukrainian army. The Ukrainian authorities alleged that Shoigu coordinated all of DPR Supreme Commander Igor Girkin&#x27;s actions, supplying him and &quot;other terrorist leaders&quot; with &quot;the most destructive weapons&quot; since May and instructing him directly, with Putin&#x27;s approval.

In July 2016 Shoigu said that he had &quot;deployed more air defense systems in the southwest [of Russia]&quot; and &quot;also deployed a &#x27;self-sufficient&#x27; contingent of troops in Crimea&quot;, adding &quot;Since 2013 ... we have formed four divisions, nine brigades and 22 regiments. They include two missile brigades armed with Iskander missile complexes, which has allowed to boost fire power to destroy the potential adversary.&quot;

In July 2018 Shoigu warned that the Poroshenko administration of Ukraine was not fulfilling the Minsk agreements which were signed in order to end the war in Donbas.

=== Activities related to Syria ===

On 30 September 2015, Russia began a military operation in Syria. The operation was carried out by the Russian Aerospace Forces, with the support of the Russian Navy and Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s Syrian Armed Forces.

On 16 December 2015, speaking to the members of the State Duma behind closed doors, Shoigu mentioned the possibility of the Russian forces &quot;reaching the Euphrates&quot; in Syria.

In June 2016, Russia Today, while reporting minister Shoigu&#x27;s visit to Hmeymim air base, showed RBK-500 ZAB-2.5SM incendiary cluster bombs being loaded onto Russian airplanes. After this information was discovered to be inconsistent with official Russian statements, the video was removed. It was later reinstated. An editorial note below the video made no mention of the weapon, saying a frame in the video has caused &quot;concern for personnel safety&quot; because of a pilot&#x27;s close-up. &quot;Upon re-evaluation it was deemed that the frame did not pose any risks; it had since been restored and the video is up in its original cut&quot;, the RT statement said.

On 11 December 2017, days after declaring Syria had been &quot;completely liberated&quot; from ISIL and with the campaign liberating the western bank of the Euphrates in its final days, Putin visited the Russian base in Syria, where he announced that he had ordered the partial withdrawal of the forces deployed to Syria. Several hours later, Shoigu said the troops had already begun to return.

On 26 December 2017, Shoigu said that Russia had set about &quot;forming a permanent grouping&quot; at the Tartus naval facility and the Hmeymim airbase, after Putin approved their structure and personnel strength. On the same day, the upper chamber of parliament approved the ratification of an agreement between Russia and Syria on expanding the Tartus naval facility, which envisages turning it into a full-fledged naval base.

On 17 September 2018, during multiple missile strikes by Israeli F-16 jets at targets in western Syria, Russia&#x27;s Il-20 ELINT reconnaissance plane returning to Khmeimim Air Base, with 15 Russian servicemen on board, was inadvertently downed by a Syrian S-200 surface-to-air missile. Russia&#x27;s defence minister the following day blamed Israel&#x27;s military for the accident and re-affirmed its stance in a minute-by-minute report presented on 23 September. Early on 20 September, Russia&#x27;s government-run news agency reported Russia had announced multiple areas of eastern Mediterranean near Syria, Lebanon, and Cyprus&quot; shut for air and sea traffic until 26 September, due to the Russian Navy&#x27;s drills in the area. Following the shoot down incident, Shoigu on 24 September said that within two weeks, the Syrian army would receive S-300 air-defense missile systems to strengthen Syria&#x27;s combat air defence capabilities; a series of other military measures were announced such as radio-electronic jamming of &quot;satellite navigation, onboard radars and communications systems used by military aircraft attacking targets in Syrian territory&quot;, in the areas of the Mediterranean off the Syrian coast.

Shoigu said in August 2021 that Russia had tested 320 new weapons over the course of its campaign in Syria.

=== In Medvedev government ===
Shoigu was reappointed as defence minister in 2018 in the Medvedev second government.

=== In Mishustin government ===

Shoigu was reappointed as defence minister in 2020 in the Mishustin government.

In an August 2021 &quot;Solovyov Live&quot; YouTube channel interview, Shoigu said referring to his tenure in the Ministry that &quot;The requirements for fulfilling the defense procurement plan have risen dramatically. Over the past nine years, we have received 15,500 weapon systems for the ground forces. In 1999–2002, we had gotten 10 or 19 aircraft at best, that is, fixed- and rotary-wing aircraft all together. That&#x27;s why now that we receive 140–150 aircraft annually, this is quite a different story.&quot;

In August 2021, Shoigu praised military cooperation between Russia and China.

=== Activities related to 2022 invasion of Ukraine ===
On 29 August 2021, Shoigu was recorded as saying that &quot;Russia doesn&#x27;t consider Ukraine as threat&quot;, while he expressed the hope that the situation in Ukraine would ultimately change and the &quot;nationalist mayhem&quot; would be stopped. Shoigu said that the Ukrainians &quot;are not just our neighbors, we are a single people&quot;.

On 11 February 2022, Shoigu met UK Defense Secretary Ben Wallace. Shoigu denied that Russia was planning an invasion of Ukraine. Wallace agreed at the meeting which also included General Valery Gerasimov that it was important to implement the Minsk agreements &quot;as a clear way forward&quot;.
On 24 February 2022, Russia launched a large-scale military invasion of Ukraine. Shoigu said the purpose of the invasion &quot;is to protect the Russian Federation from the military threat posed by Western countries, who are trying to use the Ukrainian people in the fight against our country&quot;. The sources say the decision to invade Ukraine was made by Putin and a small group of war hawks in Putin&#x27;s inner circle, including Sergei Shoigu and Putin&#x27;s national security adviser Nikolai Patrushev. In a 11 March video conference with Putin, Shoigu claimed that &quot;everything is going to plan&quot;.

On 24 April, Putin decided to broadcast with English subtitles an 11-minute long Siege of Mariupol situation report meeting with Shoigu.

On 13 May, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin initiated a telephone conversation with Shoigu, the first call since 18 February. The call lasted about an hour with Austin urging an immediate ceasefire in Ukraine.

Also on 13 May, former FSB officer and former DPR Supreme Commander Igor Girkin harshly criticized Shoigu, accusing him of &quot;criminal negligence&quot; in conducting the invasion.

On 16 August, Shoigu said that Russia does not need to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, as &quot;its main purpose is to deter a nuclear attack. Its use is limited to extraordinary circumstances.&quot;

At the 10th Moscow Conference on International Security in August 2022, Shoigu hosted 35 defense ministers from Asia, Africa and Latin America. He described South Africa as a &quot;friendly state&quot; and that South Africa&#x27;s support has helped counter NATO pressure on Russia.

Shoigu and Putin attended the military exercise in the Russian Far East. Beyond Russian troops, the exercises also included military forces from China, India, Mongolia and several post-Soviet states, among others.

After large Ukrainian counteroffensives in September 2022, Igor Girkin said that Shoigu should be executed by firing squad. The Russia-installed governor of Ukraine&#x27;s Kherson region Kirill Stremousov said in a video shared on social media that &quot;Many are saying that the Defense Minister – who allowed things to come to this – should simply shoot himself like a [real] officer.&quot;

On 21 September 2022, Shoigu said in a televised speech that Russia was not so much at war with Ukraine and the Ukrainian army as with the &quot;collective West&quot; and NATO.

In September 2022, Shoigu claimed that 5,397 Russian soldiers had been killed in the war in Ukraine. He said that the 2022 Russian mobilization is being carried out to control &quot;already liberated territories&quot; in Ukraine. According to Shoigu, it is planned to mobilize 300,000 reservists. Shoigu said the mobilized people could only be sent to combat zones after &quot;training and combat coordination&quot;. However, some of the mobilized Russian men were killed less than two weeks after being drafted, meaning conscripted civilians are being sent to a combat zone without basic military training. On 28 October, Shoigu said that 82,000 mobilized reservists had already been deployed in the combat zone.
On 12 October 2022, the independent Russian media project iStories reported that more than 90,000 Russian soldiers had been killed, seriously wounded or gone missing in Ukraine, citing sources close to the Kremlin.

On 23 October 2022, Shoigu said, without providing evidence, that Ukraine could escalate the war with a dirty bomb—or an explosive that contains radioactive waste material. The UK, US and French governments rejected what they called &quot;Russia&#x27;s transparently false allegations&quot; against Ukraine, adding: &quot;The world would see through any attempt to use this allegation as a pretext for escalation.&quot;

On 1 November 2022, Shoigu admitted that the Russian military was destroying Ukrainian energy facilities. On 6 December 2022, he said that Russian forces are &quot;inflicting massive strikes&quot; on Ukraine.

On 21 December 2022, Shoigu said that the war in Ukraine would continue in 2023 &quot;until the tasks are completed&quot;. He declared that victory was &quot;inevitable&quot; and claimed that Russian troops were fighting what he called &quot;neo-Nazism and terrorism&quot;.

On 18 April 2023, Shoigu met with Chinese Defence Minister Li Shangfu in Moscow. Shoigu said that their countries&#x27; military cooperation was a &quot;stabilising&quot; force in the world. They discussed expanding military cooperation.

On 28 April 2023, he met with Indian Minister of Defence Rajnath Singh as part of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation defence ministers&#x27; meeting in New Delhi, India.
On 6 June 2023, Shoigu said that Ukrainian &quot;offensive attempts were thwarted, the enemy was stopped, Russian soldiers and officers showed courage and heroism in the battles&quot;, while claiming Ukraine had suffered &quot;significant and incomparable casualties&quot;. On 20 June 2023, Shoigu stated that the Ukrainian counteroffensive began on June 4, and since then Ukraine had launched 263 attacks on Russian positions, all of which have been unsuccessful, and that Russian forces had lost no territory or settlements. The statement, which is directly contradictory to publicly available information, has been assessed by the ISW as &quot;even-keeled&quot; and an adaption to Russian command strategy following the chaos in the Russian information space during the Kharkiv and Kherson counteroffensives of 2022.

In July 2023, the UK Ministry of Defense reported that Russia had suffered an average of around 400 casualties per day for 17 months. As of July 2023, the Russian Ministry of Defense was still keeping secret the actual number of casualties.

In July 2023, Shoigu and a Chinese delegation led by Communist Party Politburo member Li Hongzhong arrived in North Korea for the 70th anniversary of the end of the Korean War. He met with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un and North Korean Defense Minister Kang Sun-nam.

On 23 April 2024, Shoigu’s deputy Timur Ivanov was arrested for taking bribes.

=== Falling out with Wagner ===
On 5 May 2023, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin blamed Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov for &quot;tens of thousands&quot; of Wagner casualties, saying &quot;Shoigu, Gerasimov, where ... is the ammunition? They came here as volunteers and are dying so you can sit like fat cats in your luxury offices.&quot;

In a video released on 23 June 2023 at the start of the Wagner Group rebellion, Prigozhin said that Russian government justifications for the Russian invasion of Ukraine were based on lies. He accused the Russian Defense Ministry under Shoigu of &quot;trying to deceive society and the president and tell us how there was crazy aggression from Ukraine and that they were planning to attack us with the whole of NATO&quot;. According to Prigozhin, &quot;Shoigu killed thousands of the most combat-ready Russian soldiers in the first days of the war. The mentally ill scumbags decided &#x27;It&#x27;s okay, we&#x27;ll throw in a few thousand more Russian men as &#x27;cannon fodder&#x27;. &#x27;They&#x27;ll die under artillery fire, but we&#x27;ll get what we want&#x27;.&quot;

Despite being the target of Prigozhin&#x27;s ire, Shoigu made no public appearances during the incident, leading Russian media to speculate that he had lost Putin&#x27;s confidence and that his removal had been a condition of the agreement that ended the rebellion on 24 June. However, on 26 June, the Russian Ministry of Defence published a video allegedly showing Shoigu meeting Russian officers in Ukraine.

==Secretary of the Security Council==

On 12 May 2024, soon after Putin&#x27;s re-election, Shoigu replaced Nikolai Patrushev as Secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation. According to analysts, the replacement of Sergei Shoigu by Andrey Belousov as defense minister signals that Putin is preparing for a long war of attrition against Ukraine.

On 25 June 2024, the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Shoigu on charges of alleged war crimes for missile strikes against Ukrainian energy infrastructure.

On 5 August 2024 Shoigu visited Tehran for high-level meetings with the new Pezeshkian government, the General Staff of Iran and members of Iran&#x27;s Supreme National Security Council.

== Sanctions ==

On 23 February 2022, the European Union considered Shoigu responsible for actively supporting and implementing actions and policies that undermine and threaten the territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence of Ukraine as well as the stability or security in Ukraine. Therefore the European Union added Shoigu to the list of natural and legal persons, entities and bodies set out in Annex I to Regulation (EU) No 269/2014.

On 25 February 2022, following Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine, the United States added Shoigu to the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List.

Shoigu was sanctioned by the UK government in 2022 in relation to the Russo-Ukrainian War.

On 28 February 2022, the Government of Canada &quot;further amended its Special Economic Measures (Russia) Regulations to add eighteen members of the Security Council of the Russian Federation responsible for&quot; Russian actions in Ukraine, &quot;including President Vladimir Putin, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu, Minister of Justice Konstantin Chuychenko, and Finance Minister Anton Siluanov&quot;.

== Personal life ==

According to &quot;The Siberian Times&quot;, Shoigu is a polyglot who is known to speak eight languages other than Russian fluently, including English, Japanese, Chinese, Tuvan, and Turkish.

=== Family ===

Sergei Shoigu was born to Kuzhuget Sereevich Shoigu (1921–2010) and Alexandra Yakovlevna Shoigu (née Kudryavtseva, 1924–2011). His father was born Shoigu Seree oglu Kuzhuget. His name order was changed because of a passport error, according to the Tuva official line. More likely, he Russified the name from Turkic &quot;oglu&quot; &#x27;son of...&#x27;. Kuzhuget was an editor of a regional newspaper. He later worked in the Communist Party and for the Soviet authorities. He was the secretary of the Tuva Party Committee. He retired with the rank of first deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Tuva ASSR.

Shoigu&#x27;s father led the Tuvan State Archives. He spent six years as the editor of the newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot;. He wrote the novels &quot;Time and People&quot;, &quot;Feather of the Black Vulture&quot; (2001), &quot;Tannu Tuva: the Country of Lakes and Blue Rivers&quot; (2004).

Shoigu&#x27;s mother Alexandra was born in the village of Yakovlev in the Oryol Oblast. From there, shortly before the Great Patriotic War, her family moved to Kadiivka in the Luhansk Oblast, Ukraine. A zootechnician, Alexandra was an Honored Worker of Agriculture of the Republic of Tuva. From 1979 she was the head of the Planning Department of the Ministry of Agriculture of the Republic. She was repeatedly elected deputy of the Supreme Soviet (parliament) of the Tuva ASSR. Sergei&#x27;s great uncle, Seren Kuzhuget, was the commander of the Tuvan People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army from 1929 to 1938.

Sergei has two sisters: Larisa Kuzhugetovna Shoigu (1953–2021), who was a deputy of the State Duma; and Irina Zakharova (born 1960), a psychiatrist.

Shoigu married Irina Alexandrovna Shoigu (née Antipina). She is president of the business tourism company Expo-EM. They have two daughters, Yulia (1977) and Kseniya (1991). According to Alexei Navalny, Kseniya is suspected to be a figurehead of her father in the ownership of a palace in the outskirts of Moscow, valued at about £12 million. In 2012, the estate was transferred to the formal ownership of Yelena Antipina. Following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Kseniya posted a video on social media of her daughter and herself wearing the colours of the Ukrainian flag. According to the US Department of the Treasury, Kseniya Shoigu &quot;made tens of millions of dollars on state construction projects and has business interests directly tied to the Ministry of Defence&quot;. In May 2023, Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin condemned the luxurious lifestyle of the children of Russia&#x27;s top officials and in particular singled out Shoigu&#x27;s son-in-law for not joining the Russian army. In August 2023, it was announced that Shoigu&#x27;s daughter and her husband Stolyarov had separated, allegedly at the instigation of Shoigu and Putin.

Shoigu is alleged to have an affair with Elena Shebunova from the early 2000s until 2017. According to similar sources, allegedly Shoigu and Shebunova have three children: Danila (2001), Dasha (2008), and Stepan (2011). Danila is pursuing a music career under the stage-name Sheba (or Sheba Singer).

=== Hobbies ===

Shoigu enjoys studying the history of Russia, especially Peter the Great&#x27;s time and the era between 1812 and 1825 (which includes the French invasion of Russia and the Decembrist revolt).

Shoigu collects Indian, Chinese, and Japanese swords and daggers. He enjoys bard songs and plays the guitar. He does water color paintings and graphics. He enjoys carpentry, and has shown some of his work to Putin.

=== Religion ===
Shoigu stated in 2008 that he was baptized in the Russian Orthodox Church at the age of five, rebutting rumors that he was a practitioner of shamanism or Buddhism like many Tuvans.

<text>El Jadida (, ) is a major port city on the Atlantic coast of Morocco, located south of the city of Casablanca, in the province of El Jadida and the region of Casablanca-Settat. It has a population of 170,956 as of 2023.

The fortified city, built by the Portuguese at the beginning of the 16th century and named Mazagan (&quot;Mazagão&quot; in Portuguese), was given up by the Portuguese in 1769 and incorporated into Morocco. El Jadida&#x27;s old city sea walls are one of the Seven Wonders of Portuguese Origin in the World. The &quot;Portuguese Fortified City of Mazagan&quot; was registered as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2004, on the basis of its status as an &quot;outstanding example of the interchange of influences between European and Moroccan cultures&quot; and as an &quot;early example of the realisation of the Renaissance ideals integrated with Portuguese construction technology&quot;. According to UNESCO, the most important buildings from the Portuguese period are the cistern and the Church of the Assumption, both in a Manueline style.

The city is a popular resort and destination for both Moroccan and international tourists. An important industrial complex, Jorf Lasfar, lies 20 kilometres to the south.

== Names ==
El Jadida&#x27;s other names and nicknames in other languages were: Cap Soleis, Portus Rutilis, Rusibis, Mazighen (), al-Breyja (), Mazagão, al-Mahdouma () and Mazagan. The city was renamed &quot;al-Jadida&quot; in 1820, meaning &#x27;The New&#x27;.

==History==
El Jadida traces its origins to the 5th century BC, when it was founded and settled by the Phoenicians.

Prior to the arrival of the Portuguese in the 16th century, an anchorage used by boats appears to have existed at the current site of El Jadida throughout the Middle Ages and in ancient times. The name &quot;Mazighan&quot; was first documented by the 11th-century Arab geographer al-Bakri. In 1502 a Portuguese captain, Jorge de Mello, landed at this location, allegedly driven here by a storm. He and his crew took refuge in an abandoned tower, called &quot;al-Briya&quot; or &quot;al-Burayja,&quot; to defend themselves against any potential attack by the locals. After returning to Portugal, he obtained permission from the Portuguese king, Dom Manuel, to found a fortress here in 1505, but evidence indicates that he did not carry this out, as when the Portuguese army passed here on their way to conquer Azemmour in 1513 they found nothing but the old tower.

As Azemmour was difficult to access, the Portuguese returned and built a citadel at the more accessible Mazighan in the summer of 1514. This citadel was a rectangular building with four towers, one of which was the old tower that already stood here. The architects were two brothers, Diogo and Francisco de Arruda. The location then became known in the Portuguese language as &quot;Mazagão&quot;. During the next few decades the Sa&#x27;dids rose to power and began expelling the Portuguese from their coastal fortresses, with the most significant event being their expulsion from Santa Cruz (present-day Agadir) in 1541. In response, King João III of Portugal ordered the evacuation of Portuguese positions at Azemmour and Safi and concentrated on building a more defensible position at Mazagão instead. As a result, the Portuguese fortification was expanded into the larger walled fortress we see today in 1541.

The Kingdom of Portugal would continue to control the city until 1769, when they abandoned Mazagão, their last territory in Morocco. Upon their forced departure, the Portuguese destroyed the Governor&#x27;s Bastion. Most of the Portuguese inhabitants were sent to the colony of Brazil, where they founded a new settlement called &quot;Nova Mazagão&quot; (the present Mazagão in the state of Amapá). The city was then taken over by Sultan Mohammed ben Abdallah in 1769 and remained largely uninhabited, having been dubbed &quot;al-Mahdouma&quot; (&#x27;The Ruined&#x27;). Eventually, Sultan Abd al-Rahman (r. 1822–1859) ordered that a mosque be built, and the destroyed portions of the city were rebuilt during his reign in the early nineteenth-century. In 1820 the city was renamed &quot;al-Jadida&quot;, meaning &#x27;The New&#x27;. The town underwent a revival and soon outgrew Azemmour as the most important city in the area. Alongside the Muslim population was also a community of Jews, who participated in the city&#x27;s revival.

At the beginning of the French Protectorate in Morocco (established in 1912), the city was developed as a tourist resort, one of the earliest initiatives to develop modern tourism in Morocco. By the 1930s it had a casino which was popular with European tourists and colonists. The importance of the city&#x27;s port, however, declined as Casablanca grew into the major port and urban center of the country during this period. In the 1980s a large industrial complex, Jorf Lasfar, was developed some 20 kilometres to the south. Aided by its UNESCO World Heritage Site designation since 2004, the city continues to be a tourist destination today.

During the September 2023 earthquake that struck southern Morocco, the historic Portuguese church in the old city was damaged. As of 13 September, cracks were observed in the church&#x27;s tower and there was a risk of structural collapse.

==Landmarks==
===Fortress of Mazagan===
The design of the Fortress of Mazagan is a response to the development of modern artillery in the Renaissance. The star form of the fortress measures &quot;c&quot; 250m by 300m. The slightly inclined, massive walls are &quot;c&quot; 8m high on average, with a thickness of 10m, enclosing a patrolling peripheral walkway 2m wide. At the present time the fortification has four bastions: the Angel Bastion in the east, St Sebastian in the north, St Antoine in the west, and the Holy Ghost Bastion in the south. The fifth, the Governor&#x27;s Bastion at the main entrance, is in ruins, having been destroyed by the Portuguese in 1769. Numerous colonial-era Portuguese cannons are still positioned on top of the bastions.

The fort had three gates: the Seagate, forming a small port with the north-east rampart, the Bull Gate in the north-west rampart, and the main entrance with a double arch in the centre of the south rampart, originally connected to land via a drawbridge. A ditch, &quot;c&quot; 20m wide and 3m deep, formerly filled with seawater, surrounded the fort. During the time of the French Protectorate the ditch was filled in with earth and a new entrance gate was opened leading to the main street, the Rua da Carreira, and to the Seagate. Along this street are situated the best preserved historic buildings, including the Catholic Church of the Assumption and the Portuguese cistern.

==== The Citadel ====

The Citadel, located at the heart of the walled city, was the first permanent Portuguese construction on this site in 1514. It is a building with a rectangular floor plan measuring about , with three major rooms around a central space and four towers (one at each corner). The southern El-Briya Tower (originally known as &quot;al-Burayja&quot;) was of local, pre-Portuguese origin and it was here that the Portuguese first took refuge when they arrived in 1502. One of the northern towers was later re-purposed as the base of a 19th-century minaret built for the nearby mosque. The cistern is located beneath the Citadel.

==== Portuguese cistern ====
The semi-subterranean chamber has a roughly square plan measuring around per side, was constructed with five rows of five stone pillars and columns. The chamber is built in a late Gothic style known as Manueline, with a vaulted ceiling of brick masonry and stone ribs. Its original function is not clear. It may have been an armory, barracks, or granary, but it is recorded as having been converted into a cistern in 1541. It was designed by an architect named Miguel de Arruda but the construction work was delegated to João de Castilho. A round opening in the center of the chamber served to collect rainwater. The cistern is famous especially for the thin layer of water that covers the floor and creates fine and ever-changing reflections in the otherwise dark vaulted chamber. Its visual qualities are such that several movies have been filmed within the cavernous space, of which Orson Welles&#x27; &quot;Othello&quot; is the best known internationally.

==== Churches ====

The Church of Our Lady of the Assumption, a prominent building located south of the Citadel, was the main parish church of the Portuguese settlement. It was constructed or begun when the fortress was expanded in 1541. It has a nave, a choir, a sacristy, and a square-shafted bell tower. At least three other churches existed, though generally only partial remains of them are still present today. Two small churches were adjoined to some of the bastions of the fortress. Another, the Church of Mercy (&quot;Misericórdia&quot;) was part of the Citadel.

==== Synagogues ====

A number of synagogues also existed inside the old city, attesting to the importance of the Jewish community here in the 19th and 20th centuries. One prominently visible example is the Bensimon Synagogue, inaugurated in 1926 and attached to earlier structures in the northern corner of the former fortress. Its construction was sponsored by four brothers of the Bensimon family: Nessim, Messaoud, Abraham, and Mordechai.

=== Museum of Resistance and Independence ===
Located near the beach south of the old city and the port, this museum and exhibition space is dedicated to the memory of Moroccan soldiers and resistance to the French Protectorate regime. It is housed in a 20th-century colonial era building constructed in a &quot;Mauresque&quot; style.

==Climate==
El Jadida has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Csa&quot;). In winter there is more rainfall than in summer. The average annual temperature in El Jadida is . About of precipitation falls annually.

== Economy ==
The city is a significant tourism destination thanks in part to its UNESCO-recognized historic heritage. A large five-star resort, the Mazagan Beach Resort, was opened in 2009 besides the nearby town of Azemmour, named in reference to the historic Portuguese fort. The resort was part of a wider strategy launched in 2001 by King Mohammed VI to boost tourism in Morocco by creating, with the help of foreign investors, large coastal resorts in El Jadida, Essaouira, Saïdia, and other cities on the Moroccan coast. The city is also a popular summer holiday resort for Moroccan families.

Since the 1980s the city&#x27;s economy has benefited from the large industrial complex at Jorf Lasfar, located some 20 kilometres to the south. The complex, managed by the &quot;Office Chérifien du Phosphore&quot;, is the main processing center for the region&#x27;s phosphate reserves and its port is used for exporting its related products. It also serves as a base for other industries.

<text>The  (&quot;goes like blazes&quot; in French) was a French automobile manufactured by Larroumet and Lagarde of Agen, Lot-et-Garonne, between 1904 and 1914. The company had originally been founded in 1891 as a bicycle maker.

The two-seater, three-wheeler featured an iron chassis, wheel steering, and a single-cylinder 6 hp engine of either their own make or at extra cost from De Dion. A two-speed epicyclic gearbox was fitted to early cars, but later ones used a more conventional unit, and final drive was by a choice of belt or chain. A differential was fitted from 1907.

Between 50 and 100 are believed to have been built, with the last ones made around 1910 but possibly still on sale as late as 1914.
