<text>Vampyr () is a 1932 gothic horror film directed by Danish director Carl Theodor Dreyer. It was written by Dreyer and Christen Jul based on elements from Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s 1872 collection of supernatural stories &quot;In a Glass Darkly&quot;. The film was funded by Baron Nicolas de Gunzburg, who (credited as Julian West) also played the starring role of Allan Gray, a student of the occult who wanders into the French village of Courtempierre, which is under the curse of a vampire. Most of the other members of the cast were also non-professional actors.

The film presented a number of technical challenges for Dreyer, as it was his first sound film and was recorded in three languages. To simplify matters, he decided to use very little dialogue in the film, and much of the story is told with title cards, like a silent film. The film was shot entirely on location, and to enhance the atmospheric content, Dreyer opted for a washed out, soft focus photographic technique. The soundtrack was created in Berlin, where the characters&#x27; voices, the sound effects, and the score were recorded.

After having its release delayed by nine months, allegedly so the American films &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931) and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931) could be released first, &quot;Vampyr&quot; was released in Germany, where it opened to a generally negative reception from both audiences and critics. Dreyer edited the film after its German premiere, and it opened to more mixed reviews in France. The film was long considered a low point in Dreyer&#x27;s career, but modern critical reception has been much more favorable, with critics praising the film&#x27;s disorienting visual effects and atmosphere.

== Plot ==
Late one evening, Allan Gray, a wandering student of the occult, arrives at an inn close to the village of Courtempierre, France, and rents a room. He is awakened from his sleep by an old man, who enters the locked room and leaves a small rectangular package on the table with &quot;To be opened upon my death&quot; written on the wrapping paper. Feeling drawn to investigate, Gray takes the package and leaves the inn.

Gray follows the shadow of a soldier with a peg leg to a disused factory, where he sees the shadow reunite with its body, and witnesses other shadows dancing. He also sees an old woman who seems to hold sway over the shadows, and encounters an old man with a mustache, who shows Gray the door.

Following some more shadows to a manor house, Gray looks through one of the windows and sees the lord of the manor, who is the man who gave him the package, get shot by the shadow of the soldier. Gray gets the attention of an old servant, and they rush to the lord of the manor, but it is too late to save him. Giséle, the lord of the manor&#x27;s younger daughter, is there when he dies, but her sister, Léone, does not leave her bed, as she is gravely ill. A coachman is sent to get the police, and the old servant&#x27;s wife invites Gray to stay the night.

In the library, Gray opens the package and finds a book inside about horrific demons called vampires. As he begins to read about how the creatures suck blood and gain control over the living and dead, Giséle says she sees Léone walking outside. They follow her, and, when they catch up, see the old woman from the factory bent over Léone&#x27;s unconscious body. The old woman slinks away, and Léone, who is discovered to have fresh bite wounds, is carried back to bed. The carriage returns, but the coachman is dead.

The village doctor visits Léone at the manor, and Gray recognizes him as the old man with a mustache that he saw in the factory. The doctor tells Gray that Léone needs a blood transfusion, and Gray agrees to donate his blood. Exhausted from blood loss, Gray falls asleep. Meanwhile, the old servant has noticed the book and begun to read it. He learns that a vampire can be defeated by opening its grave at dawn and driving an iron bar through its heart, and that there are rumors that a vampire was really behind a previous epidemic in Courtempierre, with a woman named Marguerite Chopin being the prime suspect.

Gray wakes up sensing danger and rushes to Léone&#x27;s bedside, where he stops her from drinking poison that the old woman had the doctor bring to the manor. The doctor flees, kidnapping Giséle, and Gray follows. Just outside the factory, Gray trips and has an out-of-body experience, in which he sees himself dead, sealed in a coffin with a window, and carried away to be buried. After his spirit returns to his body, he notices the old servant heading to Marguerite Chopin&#x27;s grave. They open the grave and find the old woman perfectly preserved, until they hammer a large metal bar through her heart, at which point she becomes a skeleton. The curse of the vampire is lifted, and, back at the manor, Léone suddenly recovers.

The ghost of the lord of the manor appears to the doctor, causing him to run away and the soldier to fall to his death down a flight of stairs. Using information he gathered during his out-of-body experience, Gray finds and unties Giséle. The doctor tries to hide in an old mill, but the old servant, seemingly aided by an unseen force, locks the doctor in a chamber where flour sacks are filled and activates the mill&#x27;s machinery, which fills the chamber with flour and suffocates the doctor. Giséle and Gray cross a foggy river in a boat and find themselves in a bright clearing.

== Production ==
=== Development ===
Carl Theodor Dreyer began planning &quot;Vampyr&quot; in late 1929, a year after the release of his previous film, &quot;The Passion of Joan of Arc&quot;. The production company behind &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; had plans to make another film with Dreyer, but that project was dropped, which led Dreyer to decide to go outside the studio system to make his next film.

&quot;Vampyr&quot; was made under difficult circumstances, as the arrival of sound to film had put the European film industry in turmoil. The French film studios lagged behind technologically, and the first French sound films were shot on sound stages in England. As &quot;Vampyr&quot; was Dreyer&#x27;s first sound film, he went to England to study the new technology, and, while there, he got together with Danish writer Christen Jul, who was living in London at the time.

Wanting to create a story based on the supernatural, Dreyer read over thirty mystery stories. He found a number of re-occurring elements, such as doors opening mysteriously and door handles moving with no one knowing why, which helped him feel that, &quot;We can jolly well make this stuff too&quot;. The success of the stage version of &quot;Dracula&quot; in London and New York in 1927 contributed to Dreyer&#x27;s assessment that vampires were &quot;fashionable things at the time&quot;, and he Jul created a story based on elements from Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s &quot;In a Glass Darkly&quot;, a collection of five stories first published in 1872; &quot;Vampyr&quot; draws from two stories in the collection: &quot;Carmilla&quot;, a lesbian vampire story, and &quot;The Room in the Dragon Volant&quot;, which is about a live burial.

Dreyer found it difficult to decide on a title for the film. Early titles may have included &quot;Destiny&quot; and &quot;Shadows of Hell&quot;, and, when the film was presented in the March 1931 issue of the film journal &quot;Close Up&quot;, it was referred to as &quot;The Strange Adventure of David Gray&quot;.

=== Pre-production ===
Dreyer returned to France to begin casting and location scouting. At that time, in France there was a small movement of artistic independently financed films, including Luis Buñuel&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Âge d&#x27;Or&quot; and Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;The Blood of a Poet&quot; which were both produced in 1930. Through Valentine Hugo, Dreyer met Nicolas de Gunzburg, an aristocrat who agreed to finance Dreyer&#x27;s next film in return for playing the lead role in it. Gunzberg had arguments with his family about becoming an actor, so he created the pseudonym &quot;Julian West&quot;, a name that would be the same in all three languages in which the film was going to be shot.
Most members of the cast of &quot;Vampyr&quot; were not professional actors. Jan Hieronimko, who plays the village doctor, was found on a late night metro train in Paris. When approached to act in the film, Hieronimko reportedly stared blankly and did not reply, but he later contacted Dreyer&#x27;s crew and agreed to join the film. Many of the other non-professional actors in the film were found in similar fashion in shops and cafés. The only professional actors in the film were Maurice Schutz, who plays the lord of the manor, and Sybille Schmitz, who plays his daughter Léone.

Many of the film&#x27;s crew members had worked with Dreyer on &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, cinematographer Rudolph Maté and art director Hermann Warm among them. Dreyer and Maté contributed to the location scouting for &quot;Vampyr&quot;, but Dreyer left most of the scouting to an assistant, who he instructed to find, among other locations, &quot;a factory in ruins, a chopped up phantom, worthy of the imagination of Edgar Allan Poe. Somewhere in Paris. We can&#x27;t travel far.&quot;

In the original script, the village doctor was intended to flee the village and get trapped in a swamp. Dreyer later related that, while looking for a suitable mire, he and his team passed a house where &quot;strange white shadows danced around the windows and doors&quot;. They discovered it was a plaster mill, and, wanting to try to capture the same effect of air full of white powder in the film, decided to change the film&#x27;s ending to take place in a flour mill.

=== Filming ===
&quot;Vampyr&quot; was filmed between 1930 and 1931. The entire film was shot on location, with many scenes shot in Courtempierre, France. Dreyer felt shooting on location would lend the film the feel of a dream-like ghost world, as well as save money. The scenes in the manor house were shot in April and May 1930. The manor house also served as housing for the cast and crew during the filming, but life there was unpleasant, as it was cold and infested with rats. The scene in the churchyard was shot in August 1930. The church was really a barn with a number of tombstones placed around it by art director Warm.

Dreyer originally wanted &quot;Vampyr&quot; to be a silent film, and, indeed, no sound was captured during filming and it uses many techniques from the silent era, such as title cards to explain the story. Dialogue was kept to a minimum in the film, both for this reason, and because three different versions of the film were planned, so the scenes with dialogue had to be filmed with the actors mouthing their lines in German, French, and English during separate takes so that their lip movements would correspond to the voices that were going to be recorded in post-production.

Critic and writer Kim Newman described the style of &quot;Vampyr&quot; as being more like that of experimental features such as &quot;Un Chien Andalou&quot; (1929), than &quot;quickie horror film[s]&quot; made after the release of &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931). Dreyer originally was going to film &quot;Vampyr&quot; in what he described as a &quot;heavy style&quot;, but changed direction after cinematographer Maté showed him a shot that came out fuzzy and blurred. This washed-out look was an effect Dreyer desired, and he had Maté shoot the rest of the film through a piece of gauze held three feet (.9 m) away from the camera to re-create it. For other visuals in the film, Dreyer found inspiration in the fine arts. Actress Rena Mandel, who plays Giséle, said Dreyer showed her reproductions of paintings by Francisco Goya during filming. In Denmark, Henry Hellsen, a journalist and friend of Dreyer, wrote in detail about the film and the artworks that it appeared to draw from.

=== Post-production ===

Dreyer shot and edited the film in France, then moved to Berlin, where it was post-synchronized in both German and French; there is no record of the planned English version of the film being completed. The audio work was done at Universum Film AG, as they had the best sound equipment available to Dreyer at the time. The only actors who dubbed their own voices are Gunzburg as Gray and Sybille Schmitz as Léone. The sounds of dogs, parrots, and other animals in the film were created by professional human animal imitators. Wolfgang Zeller composed the film&#x27;s score, working with Dreyer to develop the music.

When asked about his intention with the film at the Berlin premiere, Dreyer replied that he &quot;had not any particular intention. I just wanted to make a film different from all other films. I wanted, if you will, to break new ground for the cinema. That is all.&quot; Asked if he succeeded, he replied:&quot;Yes, I have broken new ground&quot;.

There are scenes that were included in the script and shot that do not exist in any current prints of &quot;Vampyr&quot;. These scenes include: the vampire in the factory recoiling from a cross formed by the shadow of a window frame, the vampire exerting her control over a pack of dogs, and the ferryman guiding Gray and Giséle across the river by getting young children to build a fire and sing a hymn. Additionally, there are differences between the German and French versions of the film. The character of &quot;David Gray&quot; was renamed &quot;Allan Gray&quot; for the German version, which Dreyer attributed to a mistake, and the German censors ordered cuts to the film that still exist today in some prints. The scenes that had to be toned down for the German version include the vampire&#x27;s death from the stake and the doctor&#x27;s death under the milled flour.

Dreyer also prepared a Danish version of the film, based on the German version, but with Danish title cards and subtitles. The distributor could not afford to have the title cards for this version to be done in the same manner as they appear in the German version, so they were done in a simpler style, but Dreyer would not allow the pages from the book shown in the film to be presented as plain title cards in the Danish version, saying: &quot;Don&#x27;t you understand that the old book is not a text in the ordinary, stupid sense, but an actor just as much as the others?&quot;

== Release ==
The premiere of &quot;Vampyr&quot; in Germany was delayed by UFA for approximately nine months, as the studio wanted the American films &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931) and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; (1931) to be released first, but the film was still a financial failure. When it finally premiered in Berlin on 6 May 1932, the audience booed the film, and Dreyer reportedly removed several scenes following the first showing. At a showing of the film in Vienna, audiences demanded their money back. When this was denied, a riot broke out, and police restored order with night sticks.

The Paris premiere of the film took place in September 1932, as the opening attraction of a new cinema on the Boulevard Raspail. Société Générale de Cinema, which had previously distributed Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;, distributed the film in France.

When the film premiered in Copenhagen in March 1933, Dreyer did not attend, as he had suffered a nervous breakdown and was in a mental hospital in France.

In the United States, the film premiered with English subtitles under the title &quot;Not Against the Flesh&quot;. &quot;Castle of Doom&quot;, an English-dubbed version edited severely as to both the film continuity and the music track, appeared a few years later on the roadshow circuit.

=== Critical reception ===
Reviews of the film at the time of its initial release in Europe ranged from mixed to negative. The press in Germany did not like the film. After the Berlin premiere, a film critic from &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote: &quot;Whatever you think of the director Charles [sic] Theodor Dreyer, there is no denying that he is &#x27;different&#x27;. He does things that make people talk about him. You may find his films ridiculous—but you won&#x27;t forget them...Although in many ways [&quot;Vampyr&quot;] was one of the worst films I have ever attended, there were some scenes in it that gripped with brutal directness&quot;. Critical reaction to the film in Paris was mixed. Reporter Herbert Matthews of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;Vampyr&quot; &quot;a hallucinating film&quot;, that &quot;either held the spectators spellbound as in a long nightmare or else moved them to hysterical laughter&quot;. For many years after the initial release of the film, it was viewed by critics as one of Dreyer&#x27;s weaker works.

More modern reception for &quot;Vampyr&quot; has been more positive. On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes 98% of 45 critics&#x27; reviews of the film are positive, with an average rating of 8.7/10; the site&#x27;s &quot;critics consensus&quot; reads: &quot;Full of disorienting visual effects, Carl Theodor Dreyer&#x27;s &quot;Vampyr&quot; is as theoretically unsettling as it is conceptually disturbing.&quot; Todd Kristel of the online film database AllMovie gave the film four and a half stars out of five, writing that it &quot;isn&#x27;t the easiest classic film to enjoy, even if you are a fan of 1930s horror movies&quot;, but, &quot;If you&#x27;re patient with the slow pacing and ambiguous story line of &quot;Vampyr&quot;, you&#x27;ll find that this film offers many striking images&quot;, and saying that, although it is &quot;not exciting in terms of pacing, it&#x27;s a good choice if you want to see a film that establishes a compelling mood&quot;. Jonathan Rosenbaum of the &quot;Chicago Reader&quot; wrote: &quot;The greatness of Carl Dreyer&#x27;s [&quot;Vampyr&quot;] derives partly from its handling of the vampire theme in terms of sexuality and eroticism and partly from its highly distinctive, dreamy look, but it also has something to do with Dreyer&#x27;s radical recasting of narrative form&quot;. J. Hoberman of the &quot;Village Voice&quot; wrote that &quot;&quot;Vampyr&quot; is Dreyer&#x27;s most radical film—maybe one of my dozen favorite movies by any director&quot;. Anton Bitel of Channel 4 awarded the film four and a half stars out of five, calling it &quot;lesser known (but in many ways superior)&quot; to the 1922 silent vampire film &quot;Nosferatu&quot;, and writing: &quot;a triumph of the irrational, Dreyer&#x27;s eerie memento mori never allows either protagonist or viewer fully to wake up from its surreal nightmare&quot;.

In the early 2010s, the London edition of &quot;Time Out&quot; polled several authors, directors, actors, and critics who have worked within the horror genre about the best horror films, and &quot;Vampyr&quot; placed 50th out of 100. Andrei Tarkovsky considered the film a masterpiece and named it one of the 77 essential works of cinema.

=== Home media ===
&quot;Vampyr&quot; has been released with imperfect image and sound, as the original German and French film and sound negatives are lost. Prints of the French and German versions of the film exist, but most are either incomplete or damaged. It has been released in the United States under the titles of &quot;The Vampire&quot; and &quot;Castle of Doom&quot;, and in the United Kingdom under the title of &quot;The Strange Adventures of David Gray&quot;, but many of these prints are severely cut, such as the re-dubbed English-language &quot;Castle of Doom&quot; print, which runs 60-minutes.

The film was originally released on DVD on 13 May 1998 by Image Entertainment, which had an abridged 72-minute running time. Image&#x27;s release of &quot;Vampyr&quot; is a straight port of the Laserdisc that film restorer David Shepard produced in 1991. The subtitles are large and ingrained, due to the source print having Danish subtitles that have been blacked out and covered. This DVD includes Ladislas Starevich&#x27;s 1933 stop motion animated short film &quot;The Mascot&quot; as a bonus feature.

The Criterion Collection released a two-disc DVD edition of &quot;Vampyr&quot; on 22 July 2008. This release includes the original German version of the film sourced from an HD digital transfer of the 1998 restoration, numerous special features, and a book featuring Dreyer and Christen Jul&#x27;s original screenplay and Sheridan Le Fanu&#x27;s 1872 story &quot;Carmilla&quot;. Criterion released this package on Blu-ray in October 2017.

A Region 2 DVD of the film was released by Eureka Video as part of its Masters of Cinema series on 25 August 2008. The Eureka release contains the same bonus material as the Criterion Collection discs, but also includes two deleted scenes and an audio commentary by director Guillermo del Toro. A 2022 Blu-ray release from Eureka Video made from a new 2K restoration of the film done by the Danish Film Institute contains two audio tracks, one restored and the other unrestored, and the same extras as their 2008 DVD release.

<doc id="859656" wikidata="Q1622354" url="?curid=859656" title="Judy Lewis">
<text>Judy Lewis (born Judith Young; November 6, 1935 – November 25, 2011) was an American actress, writer, producer, and therapist. She was the secret biological daughter of actors Loretta Young and Clark Gable.

== Early life ==
Lewis was born on November 6, 1935, in Venice, California. She was conceived while her birth parents, Loretta Young and Clark Gable, were working on the film &quot;Call of the Wild&quot;. Gable was married at the time of Lewis&#x27;s conception, and Young concealed her pregnancy to avoid scandal. Young was aware that if Twentieth Century Pictures became aware of her pregnancy, the company might pressure her to have an abortion; a devout Catholic, Young considered abortion a mortal sin. Weeks after her birth, Lewis was placed in an orphanage. Lewis would spend the next 19 months in various &quot;hideaways and orphanages&quot; before being reunited with her mother. Young then claimed that she had adopted Lewis. When Lewis was four years old, Young married radio producer Tom Lewis, and Judy took his last name. Young and Lewis went on to have two sons, Christopher Lewis and Peter Lewis.

Lewis bore a striking resemblance to Gable; like Gable, she had ears that stuck out. When Lewis was seven years old, Young had her undergo a painful operation to pin her ears back in another attempt to hide her real parentage. In 1950, when Lewis was fifteen, her mother made another film with Gable, &quot;Key to the City&quot;. During this time, Gable came to her mother&#x27;s house to visit her briefly. Gable asked Lewis about her life and then, upon leaving, kissed her on her forehead. It was the only time that Lewis ever spoke to Gable, and at the time, she had no idea that he was her father. As an adult, Lewis spoke of the confusion, isolation and alienation she felt within her own family while growing up.

==Career==
Lewis&#x27; acting credits include appearances on TV serials such as &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;Kitty Foyle&quot;, and &quot;The Doctors&quot;. Lewis played the role of Susan Ames on &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; for several seasons. She also produced the short-lived &quot;Another World&quot; spin-off, &quot;Texas&quot; and was a script writer for NBC Daytime&#x27;s &quot;Search for Tomorrow.&quot; 

In 1958, Lewis guest-starred in &quot;Attack&quot;, an episode of &quot;Mackenzie&#x27;s Raiders.&quot; In 1960, Lewis appeared in an episode of &quot;The Blue Angels&quot; entitled &quot;Tiger Blood&quot;. In the 1961–1962 television season, she appeared as Connie Masters in &quot;Outlaws&quot;. In 1975, she guest-starred on &quot;Three for the Road&quot;. 

In 1985, Lewis shared a Writers Guild of America award for several episodes of CBS&#x27;s &quot;Search For Tomorrow&quot;.

Lewis obtained bachelor&#x27;s and master&#x27;s degrees in clinical psychology from Antioch University in Los Angeles, became a licensed family and child counselor in 1992, and worked as a psychotherapist with a specialty in foster care and marriage therapy.

==Personal life, death, and aftermath==
Lewis was the niece of actresses Polly Ann Young, Sally Blane, and Georgiana Young. She was also the paternal half-sister of John Clark Gable (Clark Gable&#x27;s son with his fifth wife, Kay Williams) and the maternal half-sister of Christopher Lewis and Peter Lewis (Loretta&#x27;s biological sons). Musician David Lindley was her maternal cousin.

After Lewis became engaged to Joseph Tinney at age twenty-three, he told her it was common knowledge that Gable was her biological father. Lewis was stunned. Lewis married Tinney in 1958. She and Tinney had one child together: a daughter named Maria. The couple divorced in 1972.

After Gable&#x27;s death, Lewis, at age 31, confronted her mother about the mystery behind her parentage. Her mother said, &quot;YES you are my sin.&quot; Young became nauseated, but acknowledged that she and Gable were Lewis&#x27;s biological parents. In 1994, Lewis published a book about her life entitled &quot;Uncommon Knowledge&quot; in which she stated that Gable was her father; Young refused to speak with her for three years after the book was published. Loretta Young died on August 12, 2000, at age 87; her autobiography, published posthumously, confirmed that Gable was indeed Lewis&#x27;s father.

Lewis died of cancer at age 76 on November 25, 2011, in Gladwyne, Pennsylvania and is interred at Mount Vernon Cemetery in Philadelphia.

In 2015, Linda Lewis, the wife of Loretta Young&#x27;s son Christopher, publicly stated that Young had said at age 85 that Judy was conceived in an act of date rape:

&quot;Young loved to watch &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, which is most likely what prompted her to first ask her friend, frequent houseguest, and would-be biographer, Edward Funk, and then her daughter-in-law, Linda Lewis, to explain the term “date rape.” As Lewis recalled from her Jensen Beach, Florida, home this April, sitting next to her husband, Chris — Young&#x27;s second born — and flanked by Young&#x27;s Oscar and Golden Globe, it took tact to explain, in language that an 85-year-old could understand, what “date rape” meant. “I did the best I could to make her understand,” Lewis said. “You have to remember, this was a very proper lady.”&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;When Lewis was finished describing the act, Young&#x27;s response was a revelation: &#x27;That&#x27;s what happened between me and Clark.&#x27; &quot;

The family remained silent about Young&#x27;s claim until Young and Lewis were both deceased. According to Edward Funk, before learning of the concept of date rape, Young had believed it was a woman&#x27;s job to fend off men&#x27;s amorous advances. Thus, she had perceived her inability to thwart Gable&#x27;s attack as a moral failing on her part.

<doc id="859662" wikidata="Q2729481" url="?curid=859662" title="Liberal Democratic Party (Kenya)">
<text>The Liberal Democratic Party was a political party in Kenya. It was established by Denise A.O Kodhe and members of the National Rainbow Coalition in 2002.

In the general election held on 27 December 2002, the party was a partner in the National Rainbow Coalition, which won 56.1% of the popular vote and 125 out of 212 elected seats. The party itself took 59 of these seats. In the presidential election held on the same day, the party supported Mwai Kibaki, who won 62.2% of the vote and was elected.

Before 2002 the party had been an insignifanct splinter group which was joined by a large number of former KANU members after the nomination of Uhuru Kenyatta to be KANU&#x27;s presidential candidate. Members of the former National Democratic Party NDP of Raila Odinga which had joined KANU only in summer 2001 left the then ruling party together with KANU politicians who were opposed to what they perceived as imposition of Kenyatta as candidate by the then president Moi. After leaving KANU, they did not take the risk of attempting to register a new party under a government controlled by Moi but instead opted to join the existing LDP which offered them a space.

LDP then teamed up with the National Alliance Party of Kenya (NAK) of Mwai Kibaki to form NARC which won the 2003 election with Kibaki as its presidential candidate.

Tensions developed soon as Kibaki did not honour a memorandum of understandíng signed between the partners in NARC and which envisaged a share of 50% of cabinet posts for LDP plus a new constitution which would curtail the power of the president and create the post of a prime minister which was to go to Odinga.

After the Kenyan constitutional referendum in 2005 LPD left the NARC-government. Instead, LDP and KANU formed a coalition known as &quot;Orange Democratic Movement&quot;, later registered as a political party, &quot;ODM-Kenya&quot;. KANU later left the coalition only to join Party of National Unity, a new coalition led by President Mwai Kibaki. Consequently, some KANU politicians including William Ruto and Musalia Mudavadi left KANU to stay with ODM-Kenya. ODM-Kenya, on the other hand, split into two parties, Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) and ODM-Kenya. The former is led by Raila Odinga and the latter by Kalonzo Musyoka.

Thus LDP did not participate the 2007 general elections as most of its members had either joined ODM, while some joined ODM-Kenya. Following the enforcing of the Political Parties act in December 2008, LDP ceased to be a registered political party.

LDP was an observer party at the Liberal International.

<doc id="859663" wikidata="Q695809" url="?curid=859663" title="Arnold Mindell">
<text>Arnold Mindell (January 1, 1940 – June 10, 2024) was an American author, therapist, and teacher in the fields of transpersonal psychology, body psychotherapy, social change, and spirituality. He is known for extending Jungian dream analysis to body symptoms, promoting ideas of &#x27;deep democracy,&#x27;
 and interpreting concepts from physics and mathematics in psychological terms. Mindell is the founder of process oriented psychology, or process work, a development of Jungian psychology influenced by Taoism, shamanism, and physics.

==Biography==
Arnold Mindell was born in Schenectady, New York. He studied applied physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and then at the ETH Zürich, Switzerland. Mindell was introduced to Jungian psychology in Switzerland following a chance encounter with Franz Niklaus Riklin, then president of the C.G. Jung Institute.
Mindell subsequently entered analysis with Riklin and Marie-Louise von Franz and trained as a Jungian analyst at the Jung Institute. He had a Ph.D. in psychology from the Union Institute.

Mindell received the Jungian analyst diploma in 1970 and worked at the C. G. Jung Institute as a teacher and training analyst until he left in 1985. In the early 1980s, Mindell and colleagues began the first training program for process oriented psychology, in Zürich; and in 1982 founded what is now known as the Institute for Process Work (Institut für Prozessarbeit IPA), an accredited training institute for psychotherapy in Switzerland.

In the late 1980s, Mindell and his wife, Amy Mindell, moved back to the United States from Switzerland, causing some controversy in the small coastal town of Yachats, Oregon, with plans to build a seminar venue. In 1990, Mindell and colleagues established a center for teaching process oriented psychology in Portland, Oregon, now known as the Process Work Institute, which in 2001 was the subject of a controversial ethics complaint. The Mindells settled in Oregon, and in 2013 were invited by the Yachats Academy of Arts and Sciences to present a lecture on their conflict resolution and open forum work around the world.

Mindell features prominently in Micah Toub&#x27;s 2010 memoir &quot;Growing Up Jung&quot;. Toub represents Mindell as a charismatic, unconventional post-Jungian teacher and psychotherapist who was a &quot;a guru-like figure&quot; for Toub&#x27;s parents.

Arnold Mindell died on June 10, 2024, at the age of 84.

==Work==

===Overview===
Mindell founded and developed process oriented psychology, or process work. Core ideas include his &#x27;dreambody&#x27; concept and the application of psychology to social issues and conflict resolution in large groups, known as &#x27;worldwork&#x27; and the principle of &#x27;deep democracy.&#x27;
Mindell&#x27;s first book, &quot;Dreambody: The Body&#x27;s Role in Revealing the Self&quot; (1982), linked &#x27;the mind&#x27;s dreaming process with illness and physical symptoms as well as with disciplines such as yoga and tai chi.&#x27; Mindell is known for suggesting that &#x27;symptoms are dreams trying to come true.&#x27;

Stanislav Grof has described Mindell as one of the &#x27;pioneers of transpersonal psychology.&#x27; In 2012, Mindell was one of five people recognized with a Pioneer Award from the US Association of Body Psychotherapy. He is a holder of the World Certificate for Psychotherapy awarded by the World Council for Psychotherapy.

In the 2017 critical exploration of the relationship between African Americans and C.G. Jung&#x27;s analytical psychology, Fanny Brewster describes Mindell&#x27;s dreambody work and his linking of body symptoms and psychological development. Brewster finds that Mindell&#x27;s development of Jungian ideas are aligned with traditional African concepts of healing which link mind and body: 
: &#x27;I believe that Mindell&#x27;s approach to dreamwork with its emphasis on body healing mirrors the African system of healing&#x27;s inclusiveness of body and mind in the process.&#x27;

Mindell has been described as &#x27;a natural interculturalist who excels at building relationships across cultural boundaries.&#x27; Mindell&#x27;s intercultural skills include a focus on the importance of nonverbal elements of communication and the &#x27;ability to switch viewpoints and join the other&#x27;s reality.&#x27;

Mindell has been the subject of two Thinking Allowed programs, the independent television series hosted by Jeffrey Mishlove.
He has been interviewed on Shrink Rap Radio (2008), New Dimensions Radio (2009, 1995) and Somatic Perspectives on Psychotherapy (2009).

===Criticism===

Mindell has been criticised for teaching New Age concepts and practices that are unclear and unknown within the mainstream of psychology; and it is noted that he is not licensed as a clinical psychologist in Oregon. Mindell&#x27;s dreambody work has been criticized as a form of &#x27;metaphysical healthcare&#x27;; while another commentator referred to process oriented psychology as an example of a transpersonal psychology with the potential, he claimed, to be misused as a form of &#x27;mind control.&#x27;

===Key ideas===
The &#x27;dreambody&#x27; concept was developed in the 1970s while Mindell was a practicing Jungian analyst, derived from his observation of connections between people&#x27;s dreams and their body symptoms and published in &quot;Dreambody: the Body&#x27;s Role in Revealing the Self&quot; (Routledge, 1982). Mindell&#x27;s therapeutic technique has been compared to Fritz Perls: &quot;The most striking difference, at least from Perls himself, is one of mood – Mindell&#x27;s work is playful, supportive and permissive rather than confrontational.&quot; Another commentator writes: &quot;Mindell … exemplifies both the good and bad of contemporary dreamwork. On the first score: there is a bit of flim-flam about Mindell. And he conspicuously overemploys the first person singular while extolling non-ego functions. Also, he interprets disease processes so positively that they begin to lose their catagogic authenticity. But on the second score: he is inventive, creative, intuitive, holistic, and affirmative. He breaks down prevailing categories and finds authentic meanings where our culture traditionally does not. And he helps people.&quot;

In 1995, Mindell extended the dreambody concept to a theory and practice of working with people in coma and near death states; this work inspired a UK theatre production by Improbable theatre. In his 1988 book, &quot;City Shadows: Psychological Interventions in Psychiatry,&quot; Mindell presented his approach to psychiatric disorders, drug addiction and mental retardation. The book provides verbatim case studies describing interventions focused on the meaning of the patient&#x27;s unusual communication, including non-verbal signals.

Mindell&#x27;s 1990 book, &quot;Working on Yourself Alone: Inner Dreambody Work,&quot; presents a meditation practice that focuses attention on subtle body experiences and amplifies them to reveal unexpected information and meaning for the meditator. It provides a model for creative spiritual practice involving inner reflection and personal development. In the 2002 work, &quot;Dreaming while Awake: Techniques for 24-hour Lucid Dreaming&quot;, Mindell built on ideas of lucid dreaming, indigenous traditions and Zen Buddhism to create an awareness practice for daily life: paying attention to thoughts and perceptions that are normally dismissed, which he calls &#x27;flirts&#x27; from the &#x27;Dreaming.&#x27;

Mindell also published books dealing with large group conflict resolution and leadership, notably &quot;The Leader as Martial Artist: An Introduction to Deep Democracy&quot; (1992) and &quot;Sitting in the fire: Large Group Transformation Using Conflict and Diversity&quot; (1995). Mindell advances a concept and principle he calls &#x27;deep democracy&#x27; and the approach has been compared to the work of Danaan Parry. Mindell&#x27;s group conflict work has been reported within a business setting and within large community forums working with racism and other social tensions. Mindell&#x27;s concept of &#x27;rank,&#x27; published in his book &quot;Sitting in the Fire&quot;, has been used to support greater gender awareness in mediation training.

Mindell&#x27;s work is known for proposing analogies between the concepts of mathematics, classical and quantum physics and psychological experiences; his books include simple exercises to guide the reader to explore their own experience of these ideas.

<text>The Little Pigeon River is a river located entirely within Sevier County, Tennessee. It rises from a series of streams which flow together on the dividing ridge between the states of Tennessee and North Carolina, with most of the flow from inside the boundary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. The river has three main forks or prongs, East, Middle, and West.

The East and Middle prongs are less notable divisions of the river, with the Middle Prong emerging from the Greenbrier area of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park and paralleled for most of its remaining length by State Route 416 up to its confluence with the East Fork near U.S. Route 411. The East Fork is the only division in which the main stem does not emerge from the national park, formed by a series of small streams in the foothills of English Mountain draining large portions of the Camp Hollow, Pearl Valley, Ball Hollow, and Jones Cove valleys and running along State Road 339. The Harrisburg Covered Bridge is a landmark structure from the 1800s that crosses the East Fork. The West Fork is far better known because it drains the major tourist towns of Gatlinburg and Pigeon Forge. The Old Mill of Pigeon Forge, a working grist mill constructed in 1830 by Isaac Love on a milldam impoundment of the West Fork in downtown Pigeon Forge, is one of the best examples of 19th century hydropower technology, as well as being one of the most photographed mills in America. The confluence of the West and East forks is at Sevierville at Forks of the River. From there the stream continues to flow northward, paralleled by State Route 66, until its confluence with the French Broad River just downstream from Douglas Dam.

Despite its name, it is not a tributary of the nearby Pigeon River, which flows into the French Broad well above Douglas Dam and the resultant reservoir.

<doc id="859683" wikidata="Q74561" url="?curid=859683" title="International Terrestrial Reference System and Frame">
<text>The International Terrestrial Reference System (ITRS) describes procedures for creating reference frames suitable for use with measurements on or near the Earth&#x27;s surface. This is done in much the same way that a physical standard might be described as a set of procedures for creating a &quot;realization&quot; of that standard. The ITRS defines a geocentric system of coordinates using the SI system of measurement.

An International Terrestrial Reference Frame (ITRF) is a realization of the ITRS. Its origin is at the center of mass of the whole earth including the oceans and atmosphere. New ITRF solutions are produced every few years, using the latest mathematical and surveying techniques to attempt to realize the ITRS as precisely as possible. Due to experimental error, any given ITRF will differ very slightly from any other realization of the ITRF. The difference between the latest as of 2006 WGS 84 (frame realisation G1150) and the latest ITRF2000 is only a few centimeters and RMS difference of one centimeter per component.

The ITRS and ITRF solutions are maintained by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS). Practical navigation systems are in general referenced to a specific ITRF solution, or to their own coordinate systems which are then referenced to an ITRF solution. For example, the &quot;Galileo Terrestrial Reference Frame&quot; (&quot;GTRF&quot;) is used for the Galileo navigation system; currently defined as ITRF2005 by the European Space Agency.

== Versions ==

The ITRF realizations developed from the ITRS since 1991 include the following versions:

== Users ==
GNSS systems:
* Galileo Terrestrial Reference Frame (GTRF), ITRF2005; own implementation using IGS sites.
* GPS just uses WGS 84, ITRF2020 since January 2024 (but used many versions of WGS 84 before), a little modified with International GNSS Service (IGS) implementation, IGS20.
* BeiDou Coordinate System, China Terrestrial Reference Frame (CTRF) 2000 = ITRF97 at epoch 2000.0; own implementation.
* GLONASS PZ-90.11 is nominally its own system, but is quite close to ITRF and uses many of the same techniques.

National systems:
* United States: WGS 84 (see above); domestic use is mainly based on NAD 83 instead.
* China: CTRF 2000 per above.
The GPS reference epoch was moved from 2000.0 to 2001.0 in G1150 due to the magnitude 7.9 Denali Fault earthquake in Alaska in November 2002. Still in 2022 ITRF2020 was released, yet GPS was only using G2139 in its antennas, which was aligned to ITRF2014 (IGb14) (though at epoch 2016.0, not reference epoch 2010.0). On 7 January 2024 move to IGS20 happened, so WGS 84 is now aligned with ITRF2020, including PSD (post-seismic deformation), also called G2296.

On the other hand GLONASS is using PZ-90.11, which is close to ITRF2008 at epoch 2011.0 and is using 2010.0 epoch (that means when you use reference transformation to PZ-90.11 you will get January 2010 date).

<doc id="859684" wikidata="Q900848" url="?curid=859684" title="Bothrops atrox">
<text>Bothrops atrox — also known as the common lancehead, fer-de-lance, barba amarilla, and mapepire balsain — is a highly venomous pit viper species found in the tropical lowlands of northern South America east of the Andes, as well as the Caribbean island of Trinidad. No subspecies are currently recognized.

==Taxonomy==
The common lancehead was one of the many reptile and amphibian species described by Carl Linnaeus in the landmark 1758 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, where it was given the binomial name &quot;Coluber atrox&quot;. The taxonomy of this species is controversial; it may include &quot;B. leucurus&quot; and &quot;B. moojeni&quot;, and some of its populations are sometimes said to be separate species. &quot;B. asper&quot; was formerly included in this species, but most authorities now consider it distinct.

==Names==
Common names include lancehead, &quot;fer-de-lance&quot;, &quot;barba amarilla&quot;, and &quot;mapepire balsain&quot;, among others.

The Spanish common name &quot;barba amarilla&quot; (yellow beard), an allusion to the pale-yellow chin color, is also used in English. In Venezuela, it is called &quot;mapanare&quot;. In Colombia, it is known as &quot;mapaná &quot; (Llanos of Vichada) and &quot;talla equis&quot;. In Guyana and Suriname, it is called &quot;labaria&quot; or &quot;labarria&quot;. In Peru, it is called &quot;aroani&quot; (Yagua), &quot;cascabel&quot; (juveniles), &quot;ihdóni&quot; (Bora), &quot;jergón&quot;, &quot;jergona&quot;, &quot;jergón de la selva&quot;, &quot;macánchi&quot; (Alto Marañón), &quot;machacú&quot;, &quot;marashar&quot; and &quot;nashipkit&quot; (Aguaruna names). The name &quot;jergón&quot; is an allusion to the X-like markings of the color pattern. In Ecuador and Panama, these markings have led to the snake simply being referred to as &quot;equis&quot; (the Spanish name of the letter &#x27;x&#x27;). In Trinidad, it is known as &quot;mapepire balsain&quot;. In Bolivia, it is called &quot;Yoperojobobo&quot;. In Brazil, the common names are &quot;jararaca&quot; or &quot;Jararaca-do-norte&quot;. The name &quot;fer-de-lance&quot; comes from French, meaning, &quot;head of a lance&quot;, &quot;spearhead&quot;, or literally &quot;lance iron&quot;.

==Description==
A terrestrial species, adults usually grow to a total length 75–125 cm (about 30-50 inches) and are moderately heavy-bodied. Reports of the maximum size are not clear, as this species is often confused with &quot;B. asper&quot;. Soini (1974) mentioned of a series of 80 specimens collected in northeastern Peru, the largest was a female of . The largest specimen measured by Campbell and Lamar (2004) was a female with a total length of .

The scalation includes 23-29 (usually 23-25) rows of dorsal scales at midbody, 169-214 and 177-214 ventral scales in males and females, respectively, 52-86 (usually 75 or fewer) subcaudal scales in males, which are usually divided, and 47-72 subcaudals in females. On the head, the rostral scale is about as high, or slightly higher, than it is wide. There are three to 11 (usually five to 9) keeled intersupraocular scales, seven to 13 (usually eight to 11) sublabial scales and six to 9 (usually seven) supralabial scales, the second of which is fused with the prelacunal to form a lacunolabial.
The color pattern is highly variable, including a ground color that may be olive, brown, tan, gray, yellow, or (rarely) rusty. The body markings are highly variable, as is the degree of contrast; in some specimens, the pattern is very well defined, while in others, it may be virtually absent. In general, however, the body pattern consists of a series of dorsolateral blotches, rectangular or trapezoidal in shape, which extend from the first scale row to the middle of the back. These blotches may oppose or alternate across the midline, often fusing to form bands. They also have pale borders, which in some cases may be prominent, and may be invaded from below by tan or gray pigment, occasionally dividing them into pairs of ventrolateral spots. The belly may be white, cream, or yellowish gray, with an increasing amount of gray to black mottling posteriorly that may fade again under the tail. The head usually does not have any markings other than a moderately wide postocular stripe that runs from behind the eye back to the angle of the mouth. The irises are gold or bronze, with varying amounts of black reticulation, while the tongue is black.

==Distribution and habitat==
This species is found in the tropical lowlands of South America east of the Andes, including southeastern Colombia, southern and eastern Venezuela, the island of Trinidad (although some confusion exists regarding the taxonomical systematics of this population), Guyana, Suriname, French Guiana, eastern Ecuador, eastern Peru, Panama, northern Bolivia, and the northern half of Brazil. The type locality is listed as &quot;Asia&quot;, which is obviously a mistake. Schmidt and Walker (1943:295) proposed this be corrected to &quot;Surinam&quot;.

Despite the vast destruction of rain forests, it is among the most numerous and common of pit vipers and is not endangered. In Trinidad, it prefers wet forests from sea level to . Along with &quot;Bothrops caribbaeus&quot; and &quot;B. lanceolatus&quot;, it is one of three &quot;Bothrops&quot; species found in the West Indies.

==Behavior==
Although generally terrestrial, it is also an excellent swimmer and even climbs trees when necessary to reach prey. Generally nocturnal, it may forage at any time of the day, though, if necessary. These snakes are also easily agitated.

==Feeding==
Their main diet includes mostly small mammals (such as rodents and opossums) and birds, but also frogs, lizards, smaller snakes, fish, centipedes, and tarantulas. Larger prey is struck and released, after which it is tracked down by its scent trail.

==Reproduction==
&quot;Bothrops atrox&quot; can give live birth to up to 80 offspring at once. Adults breed year-round. After mating, females with developing embryos travel in and out of sunlight to keep themselves and the embryos at a constant temperature. In equatorial regions, the gestation period is about three to four months, with an average of 60 young per litter. At birth, the young are about in total length, more brightly colored than adults, and have yellow or beige tails.

Three species of the Neotropical pit viper &quot;Bothrops atrox&quot; group were confirmed to undergo facultative parthenogenesis on the basis of captivity information and by the use of molecular markers (heterologous microsatellites). Infertile eggs, non-viable ova and malformed offspring were frequent in those cases.

==Venom==
These snakes are known to search for rodents in coffee and banana plantations. Workers there are often bitten by the snakes, which can lie camouflaged for hours, nearly undetectable, and strike with high speed.

Their venom is hemorrhagic, damaging the vascular endothelium and consuming coagulation factors in a mechanism known as venom-induced consumption coagulopathy. As a result, clotting assays such as prothrombin time and aPTT will be highly disturbed. Spontaneous recovery from coagulopathy is seen 14 to 30 hours after bite according to a study performed in French Guiana. A Mexican polyvalent antivenom was tested, but had no effect on it. &quot;B. atrox&quot; venom can result in several systemic and local symptoms, such as severe bleeding, kidney failure, abnormal clotting, blisters, and necrosis. The bite can also result in hemorrhage in the central nervous system, which leads to sequelae and even death. In a case reported in the Brazilian Amazon, symptoms such as pain and ecchymoses, headaches, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, hypertension, and blood incoagulability were reported, the patient died of stroke, even after administration of the antivenom. The common lancehead has an LD50 of 1.1 to 4.9 mg/kg; the venom of juveniles is more inflammatory, lethal, and hemorrhagic, and kills more quickly than that of adults. People bitten by neonates are more likely to develop coagulopathy.

Venom yield averages , although it may be as much as . The enzyme reptilase (batroxobin), derived from this snake&#x27;s venom, is used in modern medical laboratories to measure fibrinogen levels and blood coagulation capability. The test is considered to be a replacement for thrombin time, and is used when heparin is present in the sample. The enzyme is unaffected by heparin.

<text>In mathematics, a supercommutative (associative) algebra is a superalgebra (i.e. a Z2-graded algebra) such that for any two homogeneous elements &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; we have

:formula_1

where |&quot;x&quot;| denotes the grade of the element and is 0 or 1 (in Z) according to whether the grade is even or odd, respectively.

Equivalently, it is a superalgebra where the supercommutator

:formula_2

always vanishes. Algebraic structures which supercommute in the above sense are sometimes referred to as skew-commutative associative algebras to emphasize the anti-commutation, or, to emphasize the grading, graded-commutative or, if the supercommutativity is understood, simply commutative.

Any commutative algebra is a supercommutative algebra if given the trivial gradation (i.e. all elements are even). Grassmann algebras (also known as exterior algebras) are the most common examples of nontrivial supercommutative algebras. The supercenter of any superalgebra is the set of elements that supercommute with all elements, and is a supercommutative algebra.

The even subalgebra of a supercommutative algebra is always a commutative algebra. That is, even elements always commute. Odd elements, on the other hand, always anticommute. That is,
:formula_3
for odd &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. In particular, the square of any odd element &quot;x&quot; vanishes whenever 2 is invertible:
:formula_4
Thus a commutative superalgebra (with 2 invertible and nonzero degree one component) always contains nilpotent elements.

A Z-graded anticommutative algebra with the property that for every element &quot;x&quot; of odd grade (irrespective of whether 2 is invertible) is called an alternating algebra.

<doc id="859687" wikidata="Q2421031" url="?curid=859687" title="Neo-noir">
<text>Neo-noir is a film genre that adapts the visual style and themes of 1940s and 1950s American film noir for contemporary audiences, often with more graphic depictions of violence and sexuality. During the late 1970s and the early 1980s, the term &quot;neo-noir&quot; surged in popularity, fueled by movies such as Sydney Pollack&#x27;s &quot;Absence of Malice&quot;, Brian De Palma&#x27;s &quot;Blow Out&quot;, and Martin Scorsese&#x27;s &quot;After Hours&quot;. The French term &quot;film noir&quot; translates literally to English as &quot;black film&quot;, indicating sinister stories often presented in a shadowy cinematographic style. Neo-noir has a similar style but with updated themes, content, style, and visual elements.

==Definition==
The neologism neo-noir, using the Greek prefix for the word &quot;new&quot;, is defined by Mark Conard as &quot;any film coming after the classic noir period that contains noir themes and noir sensibility&quot;. Another definition describes it as later noir that often synthesizes diverse genres while foregrounding the scaffolding of &quot;film noir&quot;.

==History==

&quot;Film noir&quot; was coined by critic Nino Frank in 1946 and popularized by French critics Raymond Borde and Etienne Chaumeton in 1955. The term revived in general use beginning in the 1980s, with a revival of the style.

The classic &quot;film noir&quot; era is usually dated from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. The films were often adaptations of American crime novels, which were also described as &quot;hardboiled&quot;. Some authors resisted these terms. For example, James M. Cain, author of &quot;The Postman Always Rings Twice&quot; (1934) and &quot;Double Indemnity&quot; (1944), is considered to be one of the defining authors of hard-boiled fiction. Both novels were adapted as crime films, the former more than once. Cain is quoted as saying, &quot;I belong to no school, hard-boiled or otherwise, and I believe these so-called schools exist mainly in the imagination of critics, and have little correspondence in reality anywhere else.&quot;

==Characteristics==
Neo-noir film directors refer to &#x27;classic noir&#x27; in the use of Dutch angles, interplay of light and shadows, unbalanced framing; blurring of the lines between good and bad and right and wrong, and thematic motifs including revenge, paranoia, and alienation.

Typically American crime dramas or psychological thrillers, films noir had common themes and plot devices, and many distinctive visual elements. Characters were often conflicted antiheroes, trapped in a difficult situation and making choices out of desperation or nihilistic moral systems. Visual elements included low-key lighting, striking use of light and shadow, and unusual camera placement. Sound effects helped create the noir mood of paranoia and nostalgia.

Few major films in the classic &quot;film noir&quot; genre have been made since the early 1960s. These films usually incorporated both thematic and visual elements reminiscent of &quot;film noir&quot;. Both classic and neo-noir films are often produced as independent features.

After 1970, film critics took note of &quot;neo-noir&quot; films as a separate genre. Noir and post-noir terminology (such as &quot;hard-boiled&quot;, &quot;neo-classic&quot; and the like) are often rejected by both critics and practitioners.

Robert Arnett stated, &quot;Neo-noir has become so amorphous as a genre/movement, any film featuring a detective or crime qualifies.&quot; Screenwriter and director Larry Gross identifies Jean-Luc Godard&#x27;s &quot;Alphaville&quot;, alongside John Boorman&#x27;s &quot;Point Blank&quot; (1967) and Robert Altman&#x27;s &quot;The Long Goodbye&quot; (1973), based on Raymond Chandler&#x27;s 1953 novel, as neo-noir films. Gross believes that they deviate from classic noir in having more of a sociological than a psychological focus. Neo noir features characters who commit violent crimes, but without the motivations and narrative patterns found in &quot;film noir&quot;.

Neo noir assumed global character and impact when filmmakers began drawing elements from films in the global market. For instance, Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s works have been influenced by Ringo Lam&#x27;s 1987 classic &quot;City on Fire&quot;. This was particularly the case for the noir-inflected &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, which was instrumental in establishing Tarantino in October 1992.

<text>Aspidelaps is a genus of venomous elapid snakes endemic to Africa. Species in the genus &quot;Aspidelaps&quot; are commonly called shield-nosed cobras, African coral snakes or coral cobras after their cobra hoods and enlarged rostral (nose) scales. However, the hood is not nearly as well developed in &quot;Aspidelaps&quot; as it is in the true cobras of the genus &quot;Naja&quot;.

==Species==
==Venom==
&quot;Aspidelaps&quot; venom is neurotoxic, and &quot;Aspidelaps&quot; bites have caused human deaths in a few cases.

<doc id="859703" wikidata="Q7954904" url="?curid=859703" title="WRBU">
<text>WRBU (channel 46) is a television station licensed to East St. Louis, Illinois, United States, broadcasting the Ion Television network to the St. Louis, Missouri, area. Owned and operated by the Ion Media subsidiary of the E. W. Scripps Company, the station has offices on Richardson Road in Arnold, Missouri, and its transmitter is located near Missouri Route 21 and East Four Ridge Road in House Springs.

==History==
===Early history===
The station first signed on the air on September 11, 1989, as WHSL, originally operating as a full simulcast of the Home Shopping Network (HSN). Unlike most full-time HSN affiliates of the period, it was not founded by the network&#x27;s broadcasting arm, Silver King Communications; instead, it was originally owned by St. Louis-based Roberts Broadcasting, a family-owned firm owned by African American businessmen Steven, Mike and Mark Roberts. WHSL was the first full-power television station to sign on in the St. Louis market since KNLC (channel 24) debuted in September 1982.

What was a placid relationship between HSN and Roberts for the station&#x27;s first seven years on air soured in 1996, when HSN sued the station for breach of contract; Roberts sought to air more infomercials and fewer hours of home shopping. The move came after HSN reduced the number of local commercial minutes per hour from 5 to 2 and after Roberts considered leasing the station&#x27;s airtime to River City Broadcasting (owners of KDNL-TV) or Koplar Communications, which owned KPLR-TV. A judge found in favor of HSN in the dispute. With few exceptions, Roberts was thus locked into airing HSN&#x27;s programs in an arrangement that did not expire until 2003.

===From HSN to UPN===
In June 2001, Roberts announced that it had signed an agreement to become an affiliate of UPN, a move that would give the network its first primary affiliate in St. Louis and end the market&#x27;s status as the largest U.S. city by market size that did not have a full-time affiliate of the network. The deal would begin in 2003, when the HSN contract expired. Despite the fact that St. Louis was large enough to support exclusive affiliations with all six major broadcast networks that were in operation after January 1995, WHSL&#x27;s commitment to HSN prevented UPN from having a stable exclusive affiliate in the market. When the network launched, it had no affiliate in St. Louis. It finally found one in KDNL-TV, by then an ABC affiliate, which aired its programming in late night time slots from August 1995 until January 1998. When KDNL-TV opted to focus on ABC programming, it was another 16 months until UPN reached an agreement with religious independent station KNLC—which ended after just a year and with KNLC refusing to clear three-fourths of UPN&#x27;s shows as inconsistent with its programming philosophy. KPLR-TV took on a part-time affiliation with UPN—although delaying its prime time shows until after the station&#x27;s 9 p.m. newscast—in September 2000.

In July 2002, KPLR decided to disaffiliate from UPN and exclusively align with The WB, a move which would have affected fans of two of the network&#x27;s most popular series of the period, &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Enterprise&quot;, forcing them to watch both shows either through UPN-affiliated superstations offered by Dish Network or by way of tape trading. Roberts management sought to remedy this by obtaining permission from HSN to allow WHSL to preempt two hours a week of programming during prime time to carry both shows starting in September 2002.

On January 17, 2003, the station changed its call sign to WRBU (a partial reference to its corporate parent). The remainder of the UPN programming lineup moved to channel 46 three months later on April 1. On that date, WRBU replaced the HSN programming with a lineup of syndicated programs to fill out the schedule, consisting of a mix of sitcoms, drama series and first-run syndicated talk, court and reality shows.

In February 2003, Roberts Broadcasting sold a 50% interest in WRBU to the TeleFutura subsidiary of Univision Communications, under the joint venture licensee St. Louis/Denver LLC; under the terms of the deal, Roberts continued to operate the station through a time brokerage agreement and was given right of first refusal on appointees for the directors of WRBU&#x27;s licensee. Through its involvement in the venture, Roberts in turn transferred operational responsibilities for its station in Denver, KTVJ (now KTFD-TV), to Univision, which converted that station into a TeleFutura affiliate. Roberts Broadcasting would eventually acquire other television stations in the Midwestern and Southeastern U.S., signing on two UPN-affiliated stations (WRBJ-TV in Jackson, Mississippi, in 2005 and WZRB in Columbia, South Carolina, in 2006) and acquiring WB affiliate WAZE-TV in Evansville, Indiana, from South Central Communications in 2006.

===As a MyNetworkTV affiliate===
On January 24, 2006, the respective parent companies of UPN and The WB, CBS Corporation and the Warner Bros. Entertainment division of Time Warner, announced that they would dissolve the two networks to create The CW Television Network, a joint venture between the two media companies that initially featured programs from its two predecessor networks as well as new series specifically produced for The CW. On that date, The CW also signed a ten-year affiliation agreement with Tribune Broadcasting, under which sixteen of the group&#x27;s eighteen WB-affiliated stations would serve as the network&#x27;s charter stations. One of the stations included in the agreement was KPLR-TV, which was announced as the network&#x27;s St. Louis affiliate over WRBU; although, since the network chose its affiliates based on which television station among The WB and UPN&#x27;s respective affiliate bodies was the highest-rated in each market, it is likely that KPLR would have been chosen over WRBU in any event, as channel 11 had been the higher-rated of the two stations even before it became a network affiliate upon joining The WB in January 1995 and had been one of The WB&#x27;s strongest affiliates for the near entirety of that network&#x27;s eleven-year existence.

Subsequently, on February 22, 2006, News Corporation announced the launch of MyNetworkTV, a network operated by Fox Television Stations and its syndication division Twentieth Television that was created to primarily to provide network programming to UPN and WB stations with which The CW decided against affiliating based on their local viewership standing in comparison to the outlet that the network ultimately chose, allowing these stations another option besides converting to independent stations. On March 9, in a joint announcement by the network and Roberts Broadcasting, WRBU was confirmed as the charter MyNetworkTV affiliate for St. Louis.

Channel 46 became a MyNetworkTV affiliate when that network launched on September 5, and concurrently rebranded as &quot;My 46&quot;; like other UPN-affiliated stations that were committed to join MyNetworkTV, WRBU ceased carrying UPN&#x27;s prime time programming, resulting in the network&#x27;s final two weeks of programming—which largely consisted of repeats of network shows aired during the 2005–06 television season—not being carried in St. Louis. KPLR, meanwhile, remained a WB affiliate until September 17, and officially affiliated with The CW when that network debuted the following day on September 18. As a MyNetworkTV affiliate, the station began serving as a backup NBC affiliate during occasions when KSDK (channel 5) was forced to preempt programs from that network due to commitments to air St. Louis Cardinals baseball games, the &quot;Jerry Lewis MDA Labor Day Telethon&quot; or locally produced specials, or because of preemptions necessitated to provide breaking news or severe weather coverage. In March 2010, Roberts Broadcasting and Univision Communications filed to formally dissolve the St. Louis/Denver LLC venture, under which Roberts acquired full ownership of WRBU in exchange for selling its interest in KTFD to Univision as compensation for buying out the latter&#x27;s share in WRBU.

===Bankruptcy and sale===
By 2010, the Roberts brothers had begun facing serious financial trouble with their various businesses. The Roberts&#x27; broadcasting unit, in particular, had become the subject of lawsuits by Warner Bros. Television, 20th Television and CBS Television Distribution over its failure to make fee payments for syndicated programs that it acquired for its CW- and MyNetworkTV-affiliated stations (Warner Bros. and CBS would win their court disputes against Roberts, which also later reached a settlement with 20th Television); the company also was unable to fund the construction of Evansville CW affiliate WAZE-TV&#x27;s digital transmitter facilities, an issue that led the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to cancel that station&#x27;s full-power license in March 2011 (WAZE continued to operate through its three analog-only low-power translators until their shutdown in January 2013). This culminated in Roberts Broadcasting filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on October 7, 2011. The group cited the cause of its financial downturn on the loss of the UPN affiliations on WRBU, WZRB and WRBJ-TV, on the basis that much of UPN&#x27;s programming slate at the time of its shutdown consisted of shows aimed at African Americans and other minority audiences that Roberts felt were compatible with the core viewership of the stations.

On February 20, 2012, Roberts announced that the company was exploring the sale of one or all four of its television stations in order to raise sufficient funding to pay off its creditors; the company would eventually sell WRBJ to the Trinity Broadcasting Network in October 2012 and WZRB to Tri-State Christian Television subsidiary Radiant Light Ministries on December 2, 2013, leaving WRBU as the last station that Roberts had yet to cut a divestiture deal.

On December 4, 2013, Roberts filed to sell WRBU to Tri-State Christian Television directly for $5.5 million; however, on December 11, a U.S. Bankruptcy Court hearing gave initial approval for a plan by Roberts&#x27; creditors to instead transfer WRBU and its sister stations, WZRB and former WAZE-TV translator WAZE-LP, to a trust overseen by Gary Chapman with Ion Media Networks—a creditor in Roberts&#x27; bankruptcy proceedings—as its beneficiary. The attorney representing Roberts subsequently stated that Ion Media would purchase the three stations outright. The FCC approved the deal on February 2, 2014.

===As an Ion affiliate-turned-O&amp;O===
WRBU became an Ion Television affiliate on February 10, 2014, marking the network&#x27;s resumption of an over-the-air presence in the St. Louis market. Mount Vernon, Illinois–based WPXS (channel 13, now a Daystar owned-and-operated station) operated as an affiliate of Ion predecessors Pax TV and i: Independent Television during two separate tenures from 1998 to 2004 and 2005 to 2008 (Paxson Communications—which evolved into Ion Media following its 2005 reorganization—owned WPXS during the first tenure; Equity Media Holdings owned the station during its tenure as an i/Ion affiliate following a one-year affiliation deferral to Daystar preceding Paxson&#x27;s sale of WPXS). The network had also been available in St. Louis proper through low-power repeater KUMO-LP (channel 51), which covered portions of the St. Louis metropolitan area that had inadequate reception of the WPXS signal but had sparse cable coverage in most of the market. After WPXS dropped Ion to become a Retro Television Network affiliate in 2008, most St. Louis viewers could only receive Ion programming via cable and satellite from the network&#x27;s national feed.

The sale to the Ion trust resulted in the company voiding WRBU&#x27;s agreements with syndication distributors and with Fox Entertainment Group for the MyNetworkTV affiliation, with the network switch causing St. Louis to become the largest American television market at that time without a MyNetworkTV affiliate. The network would eventually return to the market when CBS affiliate KMOV (channel 4) relaunched its DT3 subchannel on November 17, 2014, acquiring both the MyNetworkTV affiliation and many syndicated shows formerly carried by WRBU that had lost local distribution in St. Louis because of the switch (through St. Louis&#x27; status as a top-25 market, KMOV-DT3 became the largest subchannel-only MyNetworkTV affiliate).

On January 29, 2015, Cedar Creek Broadcasting (a company controlled by Brian Brady, who also owns several other broadcasting companies operating as &quot;de facto&quot; arms of his flagship group, Northwest Broadcasting) agreed to purchase WRBU and WZRB from the trust for $6 million; Ion would have provided services to the stations, which would remain Ion affiliates. On May 9, 2017, the Broadcast Trust informed the FCC that the sale to Cedar Creek Broadcasting had been terminated. One month after the Cedar Creek purchase&#x27;s termination (and with the FCC restoring the UHF discount), on June 20, 2017, Ion Media announced that it would purchase WRBU from the Chapman-owned/Ion-managed trust, in a two-station deal with Columbia sister station WZRB, for an undisclosed amount. The sale was completed on October 19, 2017.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
The station&#x27;s signal is multiplexed:
Until May 2014, WRBU transmitted its primary digital channel in 480i standard definition, making it one of the few network-affiliated stations in the United States that did not transmit an HD feed through its digital signal (internal promotions for the station&#x27;s website and Facebook page that were produced during its MyNetworkTV affiliation were downconverted from 16:9 to a letterboxed 4:3 format when aired on the station). On March 10, 2014, exactly one month after the Chapman/Ion trust took ownership of the station, WRBU began carrying all five subchannel services carried by Ion Media on its Ion Television owned-and-operated stations; it also resulted in WRBU reuniting with HSN&#x27;s over-the-air service, which Ion has carried on the DT5 feed of its stations since November 2013. On May 1, 2014, WRBU began transmitting its main feed in high definition in the network&#x27;s standard 720p format.

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
WRBU shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 46, on January 21, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal continued to broadcasts on its pre-transition UHF channel 47, using virtual channel 46.

<doc id="859717" wikidata="Q1389464" url="?curid=859717" title="Keith Levene">
<text>Julian Keith Levene (18 July 1957 – 11 November 2022) was an English musician who was a founding member of both the Clash and Public Image Ltd (PiL). While Levene was in PiL, their 1978 debut album &quot;Public Image: First Issue&quot; reached No. 22 on the UK album charts, and its lead track &quot;Public Image&quot; broke the top 10 UK singles chart.

Levene was born and raised in London, and although initially influenced by progressive rock, his musical taste changed after meeting fellow Clash founder Mick Jones. His punk and post-punk guitar sounds have been described as &quot;both melodic and discordant, sonorous and violent&quot;.

==Early years and success==
Levene was born in Muswell Hill, London on 18 July 1957. His father was Jewish. He was an early fan of ska, The Beatles and progressive rock; at fifteen he worked as a roadie for Yes on their &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; tour, &quot;cleaning Alan White&#x27;s cymbals&quot; amongst other mundane duties.

He became a founding member of the Flowers of Romance and notably the Clash, when in 1976, he helped persuade Joe Strummer to leave the pub rock band the 101ers and join the Clash. Although he left the band before their first studio recordings, he co-wrote &quot;What&#x27;s My Name&quot;, which appeared on their first album. Levene would later document his time with the Clash in his autobiography &quot;I Was a Teen Guitarist 4 the Clash!&quot; When interviewed about &quot;I Was a Teenage Guitarist 4 the Clash, Levene recalled &quot;I was a kid, I was into all sorts of music, The Beatles, reggae, and at the time, prog rock. I’d just finished a tour with Yes as a roadie, which is another story also explained in the book. So basically you’re hanging out with me from when I was about 15 when I got a job with Yes, and then I didn’t get kicked off the tour, but I kinda got told not to come back on another one. It was amazing for me and then, unplanned I started making this migration to West London and I tell you what happened, I take you there. Like when I met Mick Jones and how I talk about the scene that was emerging...&quot;

After the late 1970s British punk group the Sex Pistols disbanded, Levene and their lead singer John Lydon co-founded Public Image Ltd (PiL) in May 1978. He played on Travis Bean metal-neck guitars. He was involved in the writing, performing and producing of PiL&#x27;s early albums: &quot;First Issue&quot;, &quot;Metal Box&quot; and &quot;Flowers of Romance&quot;. While playing with PiL, their 1978 debut album &quot;Public Image: First Issue&quot; reached No 22 in the UK album charts, while the lead track &quot;Public Image&quot;, broke the top 10 single chart.

Levene left PiL in 1983 due to creative differences over what would eventually become the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;This Is What You Want... This Is What You Get&quot;. In 1984, he released the original versions of the songs on his own label under the title &quot;Commercial Zone&quot;; the original working title of the album. In 1985, he moved to Los Angeles where he formed a company with his second wife, journalist Shelly da Cunha.

==Later years==
In the early 1980s, Levene played guitar and keyboards on roots reggae vocal and dub discomix releases from Bim Sherman, Jah Woosh, Singers and Players, Prince Far I and Style Scott&#x27;s Dub Syndicate. Levene recorded &quot;Devious Woman&quot; with Bim Sherman and Singers &amp; Players, which also featured on the soundtrack of Richard Hell&#x27;s Smithereens (film), and in 1982, the dub version of the track was released by New Age Steppers and Creation Rebel on the &quot;Threat to Creation&quot; album. In mid-1986, Levene was asked to produce demos for the album &quot;The Uplift Mofo Party Plan&quot; by the Red Hot Chili Peppers at Master Control in Burbank with engineers Steve Catania and Dan Nebenzal. Also in 1986, Levene worked with DJ Matt Dike, experimenting with sampling techniques and hip-hop for Ice-T and Tone Loc on their early recordings for Delicious. In 1989, he released his first solo release, &quot;Violent Opposition&quot;, on which members of the Red Hot Chili Peppers performed.

At an impromptu appearance at the Musicport Festival in Bridlington Spa on 24 October 2010, where they were joined by vocalist Nathan Maverick, Levene returned with former PiL bassist Jah Wobble. In 2011 Levene contributed to three tracks on the album &quot;Psychic Life&quot;, a collaboration between Wobble and Lonelady.

In early 2012, after some planned Japan gigs were cancelled because of visa issues, Levene and Wobble played various venues in England, Wales and Germany as &quot;Metal Box in Dub&quot;, followed by the release of a four-song EP, &quot;Yin &amp; Yang&quot;. In 2014, Levene travelled to Prague to record the album &quot;Commercial Zone 2014&quot;, funded by a crowdsourcing campaign at Indiegogo. Tim Peacock of &quot;Record Collector&quot; noted that it was &quot;recorded in isolation at Prague&#x27;s Faust Studios&quot;, and that the album is in actuality an offering of new material. Peacock stated: &quot;It&#x27;s primarily instrumental in design, veering from the chilled, scene-stealing Behind the Law to the synth-heavy Kraftwerk-ian noir of They Came to Dance.&quot;

In a 2014 interview from Prague regarding &quot;Commercial Zone 2014&quot;, Levene stated:

&quot;People kept asking &#x27;when are you doing an autobiography?&#x27; I said &#x27;I’m not, why would I do one?&#x27; Well, that all changed and I started doing a ton of interviews with Kathy DiTondo, talking about the times, the people, the places and it was quite fucking heavy therapy. She’d be asking me questions and some of it would be the same old story, and I’d think I’ve told this story a million times, boring, but I’m telling her because she wants to know genuinely and she thinks its important. Then I’m realising, fuck – this is heavy duty, this hurts. So what it evolved into was quite good for me. We were doing &quot;Diary of a Non-Punk Rocker&quot;, we were zooming in on areas of my life... We didn’t plan it this way, it fell into place this way. We were doing this &quot;Commercial Zone 2014&quot; campaign, and offered previews from Diary. Kathy DiTondo came up with &#x27;I was A Teenage Guitarist 4 The Clash&#x27; and I said &#x27;fucking good&#x27;. Then I said “let’s do it &quot;Commercial Zone&quot; style” hand made and with the covers and so on.&quot;

==Death==
Levene died from complications of liver cancer at his home in Norfolk on 11 November 2022, aged 65.

==Personal life==
Levene married his first wife, Lori Montana, an American musician. The two had a son named Kirk and later divorced. Keith&#x27;s second marriage was to Shelly da Cunha, though it also ended in divorce. He later lived with his partner, Kate Ransford.

==Influences and style==
Levene cited guitarist Steve Howe of Yes as one of his main influences and &quot;the greatest fucking guitarist in the world&quot;, and prog rock as a genre he particularly liked.

Describing the evolution of his style, he said in a 2001 interview that &quot;once I got good enough to know the rules, I didn&#x27;t want to be like any other guitarist. I didn&#x27;t go out of my way to be different. I just had an ear for what was wrong. So if I did something that was wrong, i.e. made a mistake or did something that wasn&#x27;t in key, I was open-minded enough to listen to it again.&quot;

==Legacy==
According to John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Levene&#x27;s style was &quot;spectacular... [and he]...explored the possibilities of what you can do with the guitar&quot;. Upon his death, Massive Attack described Levene as an &quot;artist, architect and re-inventor of punk rock&quot;. Andy Bell of Ride and Mike Scott of the Waterboys also paid tribute to him on social media.

<text>Theophilus Riesinger, OFMCap, born Francis Xavier Riesinger (February 27, 1868 - November 9, 1941) was a German-American Capuchin friar and priest, who became widely known as an exorcist in the United States.

==Life==
Riesinger was born in Germany. He later moved to the United States where he entered the Capuchin Order. He was ordained on 29 June 1899. In the summer of 1928, due to his previous experience in dealing with possessions, he was requested by the Bishop of Des Moines to conduct the rite of exorcism on a Anna Ecklund, a 46-year-old woman who was suspected of being possessed. While preaching at a parish mission in St. Joseph Parish in Earling, Iowa, he asked the permission of the pastor to conduct the ceremony in the parish. Receiving this, he chose a convent of Franciscan Sisters on the outskirts of the town for its privacy.

After 23 days of performing the exorcism, Riesinger was exhausted. Two days before Christmas of that year, he claimed the demons were driven out, and the woman cried &quot;My Jesus! Mercy! Praised be Jesus Christ!&quot;

Reverend Pastor Joseph Steiger, who oversaw the exorcism, gave his account to Reverend Carl Vogl in Germany, who published it as a pamphlet. This piece made it back to German-speaking Catholics in the United States and was translated into English in 1935 as &quot;Begone Satan&quot; by Celestine Kapsner, a Benedictine monk of Saint John&#x27;s Abbey in Minnesota. Soon after, in February of 1936, &quot;Time&quot; published an article covering the pamphlet. Riesinger’s account of the exorcism was recorded by acquaintance Federick J. Bunse in 1934. It was titled &quot;The Earling possession case: An exposition of the exorcism of &#x27;Mary&#x27;, a demoniac.&quot; The church did not give approval for its publication. It remained unpublished until 2020, when it was included in Joseph P. Laycock’s &quot;The Penguin Book of Exorcisms&quot;.

Riesinger died on November 9, 1941. A necrology of Riesinger was placed on the Internet as part of the Capuchin Heritage Series.

<doc id="859729" wikidata="Q688308" url="?curid=859729" title="Swedish War of Liberation">
<text>The Swedish War of Liberation (1521–1523; ), also known as Gustav Vasa&#x27;s Rebellion and the Swedish War of Secession, was a significant historical event in Sweden. Gustav Vasa, a nobleman, led a rebellion and civil war against King Christian II. The war resulted in the deposition of King Christian II from the throne of Sweden, effectively ending the Kalmar Union that had united Sweden, Norway, and Denmark. This conflict played a crucial role in shaping Sweden&#x27;s national identity and history.

== Background ==
King Christian II, along with his ally, Swedish Archbishop Gustav Trolle, attempted to suppress the separatist Sture party within the Swedish nobility by executing numerous members during the Stockholm Bloodbath. The King faced discontent due to his imposition of high taxes on the peasantry. Furthermore, the presence of German and Danish nobles and commoners in most Swedish castles further fueled the anger of native Swedish nobility.

=== Economics ===
In the background was an economic power struggle over the mining and metal industry in Bergslagen, Sweden&#x27;s main mining region in the 16th century. This struggle significantly increased the financial resources available to the military, while also exacerbating existing conflicts over the Kalmar Union. The key players in this economic competition were:
* Jakob Fugger, an early and immensely wealthy industrialist in the mining and metal industries on the continent, who sought to execute a hostile business takeover of Bergslagen. He formed alliances with Pope Leo X and the Swedish Archbishop Gustav Trolle, both of whom depended on him economically, as well as with the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I and Christian II of Denmark/Norway, who asserted his claim to the throne of the Union, including Sweden. His marriage to Isabella of Austria in 1515 strengthened this alliance.
* The Hanseatic League, represented by the Free City of Lübeck, which had a virtual monopoly on trade with Sweden and Bergslagen. The League was allied with the Swedish regents Sten Sture the Younger and later Gustav Vasa, creating a strong dependence on the League.

Christian II&#x27;s planned invasion of Sweden, coupled with Fugger&#x27;s intended takeover of the industry in Bergslagen, was financed both by the substantial dowry of Christian II&#x27;s wife and by Fugger himself. However, Fugger withdrew from the battle in 1521 after being defeated by Gustav Vasa at the Battle of Västerås, relinquishing control of shipping from Bergslagen. As a result, Christian II lost both the resources needed to win the war against Gustav Vasa and the means to maintain his position in Denmark against his uncle, Frederick I of Denmark, by 1523.

The significant increase in funding and financial dependence allowed the parties to at times afford larger numbers of expensive hired mercenaries, leading to fluctuations in power and abrupt shifts in the dynamics of the war. The costs were considerable, and after Christian III&#x27;s victory alongside Gustav Vasa&#x27;s Sweden in the Count&#x27;s Feud in Skåne and Denmark, the funds were exhausted by 1536, marking the end of the influence of the Catholic Church and the Hanseatic League in the Nordic countries.

== Rebellion 1521 ==
The war began in January 1521, when Gustav Vasa was appointed &quot;hövitsman&quot; (commander) over Dalarna by representatives of the people in the northern part of the province. After Gustav Vasa captured the copper mine at Stora Kopparberget and the town of Västerås, more men joined his army. In 1522, the Hanseatic city of Lübeck formed an alliance with the Swedish rebels. After the capture of Stockholm in June 1523, the rebels effectively ruled Sweden, and on 6 June, Gustav Vasa was elected King of Sweden in the town of Strängnäs. By September, Gustav Vasa&#x27;s supporters also controlled Swedish Finland. The Treaty of Malmö, signed on 1 September 1524, formalized Sweden&#x27;s secession from the Kalmar Union.

Initially, Gustav&#x27;s role in the war against Christian II was as one of several rebel leaders, each active in different parts of the country. The war that eventually led to his coronation was only partially instigated and led by him. The term &quot;Gustav Vasa&#x27;s War of Liberation&quot;, often used in historiography, derives primarily from the war&#x27;s outcome—Gustav Vasa&#x27;s ascension to the throne of an independent Sweden—rather than its initial impetus and course. Contemporary research also indicates that Gustav himself did not directly oversee any military operations, delegating such responsibilities to associates with greater military experience.

=== Dalarna ===
The details of Gustav Vasa&#x27;s activities in Dalarna in 1520 remain largely unknown due to the scarcity of sources. The most comprehensive account available was written during Gustav&#x27;s reign by his close associate, Bishop Peder Andreæ Swart of Västerås, which some historians speculate was heavily influenced by Gustav himself.

In 1520, Gustav Vasa traveled to the Swedish province of Dalarna, disguised as a peasant to avoid detection by King Christian&#x27;s scouts. Arriving in the city of Mora in December, he sought the peasants&#x27; help in his uprising against Christian II. When he was rebuffed, Gustav Vasa decided to travel north in search of supporters for his cause. A couple of refugees arrived in Mora and told of the atrocities committed by Christian II and his troops. Moved by these accounts, the people of Mora decided to locate Gustav Vasa and join his rebellion, sending two skilled skiers for the task. They eventually intercepted him in Sälen. (The , a ski race, commemorates this remarkable escape from Christian II&#x27;s soldiers in the winter of 1520–1521, but follows the reverse route from Sälen back to Mora. Legend has it that he fled on skis).

Upon his return to Mora, on New Year&#x27;s Eve 1521, Gustav Vasa was appointed by emissaries from all the parishes of northern Dalarna.

In March, Gustav Vasa left Mora with about 100 men and plundered Kopparberg. Soon after, the peasants of Bergslagen rallied to the cause, swelling Gustav Vasa&#x27;s forces to over 1,000 men.

=== Battle of Brunnbäck Ferry ===
When news of the Swedish uprising reached Christian II, he sent a contingent of Landknechten to put down the rebellion. In April 1521, the Union forces clashed with Gustav Vasa&#x27;s followers at Brunnbäck Ferry, resulting in the decisive defeat of the king&#x27;s army. This triumph greatly boosted the morale of the Swedish rebels.

An emergency mint was set up in Dalarna to produce the copper coins needed to finance the war effort.

=== Battle of Västerås ===
The rebel army advanced south to Västerås, which they captured and plundered in the Battle of Västerås 29 April 1521. Upon hearing of Gustav Vasa&#x27;s triumph, supporters of the Sture family decided to join the rebellion. Västerås marked a pivotal moment in Gustav Vasa&#x27;s fortunes, as the rebels gained control of the shipping routes from Bergslagen and Fugger stopped funding Christian II.

In April, Gustav Trolle had been sent to Hälsingland, but when his two hundred cavalry encountered the thousand strong peasant army, they fled south. By the end of April 1521, Gustav Vasa had secured supremacy in Dalarna, with support from Gästrikland, Västmanland, and Närke, but without the fortresses.

On July 15, 1521, the Riksdag met in Stockholm and offered Gustav Vasa a free lease on Stockholm with forgiveness for all transgressions. As a gesture of goodwill, Gustav Trolle had Didrik Slagheck imprisoned, and was promised substantial supplies of malt and hops. Gustav Vasa hesitated and waited for developments. The rebellion soon reached Brunkeberg, although the peasants found it impossible to besiege the town.

The summer of 1521 brought relative peace. Many returned to their farms to help with the harvest.

==After Västerås – Professional armies==
The importance of peasant armies diminished in the conflict, and the war was fought primarily by German mercenaries and recruited Swedish soldiers, supplemented by cavalry from the Swedish nobility.

=== 1521 – Gustav Vasa becomes head of state ===
Lars Siggesson Sparre, who had previously been a hostage of Christian II but had defected to the king&#x27;s side, now sided with Gustav Vasa. Hans Brask and Ture Jönsson Tre Rosor also switched allegiance to Gustav Vasa, and in the second half of August he was recognized as the leader of Sweden by the provinces of Gotland at a meeting in Vadstena. At the same time, the government appointed by Christian II withdrew from Swedish territory.

The assembly in Vadstena in 1521, which declared Gustav as head of state, consisted of a relatively small group of prominent individuals, mainly from the southern provinces. The peasants and other supporters who had propelled him forward in the earlier stages of the uprising were not represented. In addition, most of the nobility in Östergötland, Sörmland, and Uppland remained loyal to King Christian of the Union. However, the continued expansion of the rebellion and the election of the nobleman Gustav as head of state caused many to switch sides or flee to Denmark to avoid reprisals.

=== 1522 – The Hansa joins ===
Just before Christmas in 1521, Berend von Melen, the commander of Stegeborg in Östergötland, transferred control to Gustav Eriksson, resulting in the castle&#x27;s capture by the rebel army. With Berend&#x27;s help, Gustav gained a valuable ally with considerable military experience and strong connections to the Hanseatic League in Lübeck.

The castles of Örebro and Västerås were besieged and taken in early 1522. However, the most important fortresses remained strong. Gustav and his allies realized that these fortresses could not be taken without warships and heavy artillery.

Negotiations began with Lübeck, which had its own interest in unimpeded trade, free from the restrictions imposed by the Danish king. In exchange for aid in the form of ships, soldiers, cannons and other essential supplies, Lübeck was promised exemption from customs duties in Sweden. From May, Lübeck took an active part in the conflict, and in the fall it intensified the siege of the Danish strongholds of Stockholm and Kalmar. At the same time, Gustav, Berend von Melen, and Lübeck strategized an operation to conquer Skåne and other regions in eastern Denmark. A naval battle near Stockholm cut off vital supplies to the Danish garrison stationed there.

=== 1523 – Gustav Vasa becomes king ===
The campaign against Skåne was planned for January 1523, but was not carried out. Instead, Blekinge and parts of Norwegian Bohuslän were taken. In March, Christian II was deposed by a Danish uprising and Frederick I was elected King of Denmark. As a result, Lübeck&#x27;s interest in cooperating with Gustav in the conquest of Scania waned, and the campaign was halted.

Kalmar fell on 27 May 1523. Gustav Eriksson (Vasa) was proclaimed King of Sweden at the Riksdag in Strängnäs on 6 June 1523.

Stockholm was taken on June 17, and on Midsummer&#x27;s Eve, June 23, 1523, the newly crowned King Gustav entered the capital. Throughout the summer and fall, the remaining fortresses in the Finnish part of the country surrendered, and in late fall Gustav launched an unsuccessful attempt to capture Gotland from Denmark.

=== 1523 – Change of power in Denmark ===
The events in Sweden raised questions about the regime of Christian II in Denmark. After the executions during the Stockholm bloodbath, his relationship with the Church, both in Rome and in Denmark, became strained. In a failed attempt to create a scapegoat, he executed his advisor Didrik Slagheck, whom he had recently appointed Archbishop of Lund, in January 1522. Christian also enforced a new national land law that limited the power of the nobility and established hereditary royal power. In response, the bishops and councilors of Jutland called for an uprising against Christian. After unsuccessful negotiations, Christian left Denmark in April 1523 and sailed for the Netherlands with his family and his unpopular advisor, Sigbrit Willoms. The rebels&#x27; candidate for the royal crown was Christian&#x27;s uncle, Frederik av Gottorp, who was crowned King Frederick I of Denmark on 7 August 1524.

Christian had attempted to limit the power of Lübeck and the Hanseatic League and to make Copenhagen a free staple city and trading center. However, with Frederik&#x27;s accession to power, which effectively took place in April 1523, this policy changed. Lübeck, which had supported the Danish rebellion, was promised freedom from tariffs not only in Denmark and Norway, but also in Sweden. Initially, Frederick had plans to assert his authority as king in Sweden as well, but he abandoned these plans when Lübeck did not provide the support he expected. Lübeck had no interest in a revived Nordic Union, preferring to maintain good political relations and trade terms with all the Nordic countries.

== 1524 – Peace ==
Gustav Vasa and Frederik I met in Malmö in August 1524, mediated by Lübeck. Shortly thereafter, a peace treaty was negotiated that gave Lübeck and the Hanseatic League responsibility for determining the long-term status of the eastern Danish provinces. This agreement, known as the Malmö Recess, was finalized on 1 September 1524. The result was that Blekinge, Skåne, and Gotland would remain under Danish control, while Sweden ceded its conquest of northern Bohuslän to Norway.

== Aftermath ==
=== Count&#x27;s Feud in Denmark 1536 – The Catholic Church and the Hanseatic League runs out of money===
The Swedish War of Liberation ended with the Count&#x27;s Feud in Skåne and Denmark in 1536, resulting in the victory of Christian III with the support of Gustav Vasa&#x27;s Sweden.

The financial resources of the Catholic Church and the Hanseatic League were exhausted, leading to the end of their influence in the Nordic countries. This period also marked the beginning of the Lutheran Reformation in Sweden, coinciding with similar reforms in Denmark. The once powerful and influential Hanseatic League, which had held sway for centuries, gradually receded from the political landscape and found itself on the wrong side of history in the final stages of the war.

=== New Baltic competition emerges ===
The resolution of old issues was finally achieved through the understanding between Gustav Vasa and Christian III, which led to a 25-year period of peace during their reigns.

After the deaths of Christian III and Gustav Vasa in 1559 and 1560, respectively, Sweden and Denmark-Norway were ruled by young and assertive monarchs: Eric XIV of Sweden and Frederick II of Denmark–Norway. Frederick II sought to revive the Kalmar Union under Danish leadership, while Eric sought to diminish Denmark–Norway&#x27;s dominant position.

By 1563, during the Northern Seven Years&#x27; War, Sweden and Denmark–Norway emerged as competitors for political and economic control of the Baltic region. In 1561, when a significant portion of the Order&#x27;s northern Baltic states were secularized by Grand Master Gotthard Kettler, both Denmark–Norway and Sweden were drawn into the Livonian War, marking the beginning of a competition that would continue through five major conflicts between the two countries until the Scanian War in 1679.

=== Lutheran Reformation ===
The dependencies were strong and the pope was firm, which resulted in Sweden being under papal interdict for fifteen years. As a result, the Lutheran Reformation took root in Sweden. The regent was presented with an irresistible proposal by the Lutherans: a state church in which the clergy would serve as the king&#x27;s civil servants, thereby severing ties with the Catholic Church indefinitely. The nationalization of the Catholic Church&#x27;s assets provided funds for the new ruler&#x27;s regime.

=== Sovereign Swedish state===

Five centuries later, it remains a significant national &quot;paradigm shift&quot;.

The war freed Sweden from international economic and political dependencies, as well as the influence of outspoken enemies. This independence has lasted for 500 years, marked by local security and peace since 1523, with foreign armies absent from its soil except in border areas. There has also been general peace for over 200 years since 1814. The War of Liberation is widely revered by Swedes as the catalyst for their political and economic independence, shaping the structure and organization of their society today. Swedes see it as a national &quot;paradigm shift&quot;, marking a radical change in social perspectives that still underpins the foundations of their society.

<text>Robert Klark Graham (June 9, 1906 – February 13, 1997) was an American eugenicist and businessman who made millions by developing shatterproof plastic eyeglass lenses and who later founded the Repository for Germinal Choice, a sperm bank for geniuses, in the hope of implementing a eugenics program.

Graham created his &quot;Nobel sperm bank&quot; in 1980. Initially, his intent was to obtain sperm only from Nobel laureates, but the scarcity of donors and the low viability of their sperm (because of age) forced Graham to develop a looser set of criteria.

These criteria were numerous and exacting: for example, sperm recipients were required to be married and to have extremely high IQ, though the bank later relaxed this policy so it could recruit athletes for donors as well as scholars.

By 1983, Graham&#x27;s sperm bank was reputed to have 19 genius repeat donors, including William Bradford Shockley (recipient of the 1956 Nobel Prize in Physics and proponent of eugenics) and two anonymous Nobel Prize in Science winners.

The bank closed in 1999, two years after the death of its founder. A total of 218 children had been born under its auspices.

Graham&#x27;s overriding goals were the genetic betterment of the human population and the nurture of newly conceived geniuses. This was a form of &quot;positive&quot; eugenics, meant to increase the number of designated &quot;fit&quot; individuals in a population through selective breeding. However, Graham&#x27;s &quot;genius sperm bank&quot; was highly controversial.

However, due to lack of proper screening techniques, donors and recipients were not always those who met Graham&#x27;s selective criteria.

In 1991 Graham was awarded the first Ig Nobel prize in biology for his &quot;pioneering development of the Repository for Germinal Choice&quot;

<text>Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade is a 1994 short film written by Billy Bob Thornton, directed by George Hickenlooper and starring Thornton, Molly Ringwald, and J. T. Walsh.

It was adapted into the 1996 feature film &quot;Sling Blade&quot;, also starring Thornton, which won Thornton the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay, as well as a nomination for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

==Overview== 
Thornton plays Karl Childers, an intellectually disabled man who has been in a mental hospital for the past 25 years for murdering his mother and her lover. On the day of his release, he is interviewed by a reporter, Theresa Tatum (Molly Ringwald), who is writing an article with the intent of examining whether criminals judged to be insane should be released. Before the interview, Tatum is of the opinion that criminals like Childers should never be released. During the interview, however, Tatum must question her previous beliefs.

The title of the film comes from Childers&#x27;s description of the murders. He admits to committing murder with a kaiser blade: &quot;Some folks call it a sling blade, I call it a Kaiser blade.&quot;

<text>Reverend Father Celestine Kapsner O.S.B. (April 29, 1892 – January 1973), was a Catholic priest and exorcist who was stationed at St. John&#x27;s Abbey at Collegeville, Minnesota, in the early 1960s.

==Biography==
Father Kapsner began working with St. John&#x27;s parish mission in 1928. Among other duties and activities, Kapsner was in charge of the garden. Kapsner was known to have taken part in exorcisms. He translated a 1928 account of an exorcism by Father Theophilus Riesinger from a German magazine article, and published it, in 1935, in pamphlet form as &quot;Begone Satan!&quot;.

Father Kapsner died in Minnesota in January 1973. His pamphlet was important because it brought a detailed account of an American exorcism to a large audience for the first time in the United States.

<text>Dunnet Head () is a headland in Highland, on the north coast of Scotland. Dunnet Head includes the most northerly point of both mainland Scotland and the island of Great Britain.

Caithness is the historic county that Dunnet Head was within, the county town was Wick.

==Geography==

The point, also known as Easter Head, is at grid reference , about west-northwest of John o&#x27; Groats and about from Duncansby Head. Dunnet Head can be seen also as the western limit of the Pentland Firth on the firth&#x27;s southern, or Caithness, side (Duncansby Head is the eastern limit). Although Easter Head is the most northerly point on the Scottish mainland, the northernmost point of Scotland lies in the Shetland islands, approximately further north.
The headland&#x27;s boundary with the rest of the Scottish mainland can be defined as a north–south line running from Little Clett () to the mouth of Dunnet Burn () in Dunnet Bay. This line is followed along most of its route by a single track road, the B855, which links Brough with the village of Dunnet, making this the most northerly road on mainland Britain. From this line, the headland projects westward and northward into the Atlantic Ocean and the Pentland Firth and shelters the more southerly waters of Dunnet Bay.

The peninsula is north-east of the burgh of Thurso, and on a clear day, it affords views of the islands of Stroma to the east, and Hoy and the Orkney Mainland, 15 km (9 miles) away to the north, across the Pentland Firth.

==Military use==

Near the Dunnet Head lighthouse are minor fortifications built during World War II to protect the naval base at Scapa Flow, including a Chain Home Low radar station and a bunker used by the Royal Observer Corps during the Cold War. Burifa Hill on Dunnet Head was the site of the master station and a monitoring station of the northern GEE chain of radio navigation stations during World War II. There was also an artillery range on Dunnet Head during World War II.

==Angling==

Dunnet Head lochs are restocked every two years with brown trout fry; fishing by permit is between 1 April and early October.

==Bird watching==

Dunnet Head has a viewing platform where visitors can watch birds in the neighbouring cliffs. Depending on the season, birds may include fulmars, guillemots, kittiwakes, puffins, great skuas, arctic skuas, razorbills, and - at sea - gannets and herring gulls.

==Geodesy==

Dunnet Head was the central meridian of the and 1:2500 Ordnance Survey maps of Caithness.

==Ptolemaic Record==

Dunnet Head is recorded as Virvedrum in Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd-century Geography.

<text>The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment (&quot;Te Kaitiaki Taiao a Te Whare Pāremata&quot; in Māori) is an independent Officer of the New Zealand Parliament appointed by the Governor-General on the recommendation of the House of Representatives for a five-year term under the Environment Act 1986. The Parliamentary Commissioner for the Environment replaced the Commission for the Environment, a Government agency which was formed in 1972.

==Role==
The Commissioner is one of three officers of Parliament (the Ombudsmen and the controller and auditor general) who are independent of the executive and who may review activities of the executive government and report directly to Parliament.

The Commissioner&#x27;s role is to review and provide advice on environmental issues and the system of agencies and processes established by the Government to manage the environment. The primary objective of the office is to contribute to maintaining and improving the quality of the environment in New Zealand through advice given to Parliament, local councils, business, tangata whenua, communities and other public agencies.

The Commissioner may:
* investigate any matter where the environment may be, or has been adversely affected;
* assess the capability, performance and effectiveness of the New Zealand system of environmental management; and
* provide advice and information that will assist people to maintain and improve the quality of the environment.

<doc id="859747" wikidata="Q2628518" url="?curid=859747" title="Great ape language">
<text>Great ape language research historically involved attempts to teach chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas and orangutans to communicate using imitative human speech, sign language, physical tokens and computerized lexigrams. These studies were controversial, with debate focused on the definition of language, the welfare of test subjects, and the anthropocentric nature of this line of inquiry.

The consensus among linguists remains that language is unique to humans.

Contemporary research has steered away from attempting to teach apes human language and focuses instead on observing apes&#x27; intraspecies communication in zoos and natural habitats. This includes gestures, facial expressions, and vocalizations.

==1890s: Richard L. Garner==

Richard Lynch Garner was the first researcher to explore in depth the communication skills of nonhuman primates. He began in 1884 studying monkeys in American zoos and later travelled to Africa to study gorillas and chimpanzees. He wrote frequently for popular journals and newspapers and ultimately had three books published on the subject, &quot;The Speech of Monkeys&quot; (1892), &quot;Gorillas &amp; Chimpanzees&quot; (1896), and &quot;Apes and Monkeys: Their Life and Language&quot; (1900).

Garner argued that nonhuman primates have their own forms of speech. He claimed to be able to talk to the animals and act as their interpreter. His methods and conclusions were not scientific by any modern definition, but his work was nonetheless significant. For one thing, Garner studied the animals&#x27; intraspecies vocalizations, in some cases in their natural habitats. He went to great length to do so, even living inside of a cage himself to observe gorillas in Africa. This was in contrast to later language studies, which separated apes from their conspecifics (peers) and placed them in alien — human — habitats. Second, Garner pioneered the use of recording primate vocalizations and playing them back later for experimental purposes.

==1930s: Cross-fostering and efforts to teach speaking==

The next line of research came out of cross-fostering studies, where chimpanzees were raised in human homes as children. Primatologist Robert Yerkes launched one such project. He recruited Luella and Winthrop Niles Kellogg, scientists at Indiana University, to raise a chimp named Gua alongside their human child, Donald. In &quot;The Ape and the Child&quot;, the Kelloggs wrote that &quot;it was very clear during the first few months that the ape was considerably superior to the child in responding to human words. She began to react distinctively to separate vocal stimuli within a few weeks after she had entered the human environment.&quot;

The Kelloggs noted that Gua made several distinct vocalizations to communicate different needs, and, accordingly, tried to teach her to speak English words. The Kelloggs were building on Yerkes&#x27; assertion:It seemingly is well established that the motor mechanism of voice in this ape is adequate not only to the production of a considerable variety of sounds, but also to definite articulations similar to those of man. But Gua did not communicate using human words. Instead of the chimp copying the humans, the Kelloggs&#x27; son Donald started copying the chimp, adopting Gua&#x27;s vocalizations. Donald would use food grunts, for example, when hungry. Shortly after the Kelloggs made this observation, the experiment was discontinued. (Yerkes disapproved of Winthrop&#x27;s book about the Gua experiment and had records of the project stricken from his Orange Park hub.)

After the Kellogg study, there were four similar research projects into cross-fostering. The most notable of these was conducted by Keith and Catherine Hayes with their chimpanzee Viki. Viki would lead people to places she wanted to go as well as move the hands of people onto objects she wanted them to manipulate. She would rarely point to objects that she wanted; instead she would make gestures. For example, when she wanted to help with ironing, she would move her hand back and forth above the ironing board. This experiment with Viki would inspire other researchers to conduct similar experiments. But when it came to teaching Viki to speak, the Hayes&#x27; efforts were only marginally more effective than others who tried to teach chimps to talk. After nearly seven years of intensive exposure to English, Viki spoke only four words, &quot;mama&quot;, &quot;papa&quot;, &quot;cup&quot;, and &quot;up&quot;.

==1960s–1980s: Sign language==
=== Washoe and the Gardners ===
In 1966, the husband-and-wife research team of Beatrix T. Gardner and Robert Allen Gardner initiated a new generation of language research. After the failed efforts of teaching apes to speak, the Gardners wondered whether the issue was a motor deficiency rather than cognitive inability. The couple had been watching film of Viki, the chimp involved in the early speech study, and noticed that she was intelligible without sound; she was making gestures with her hands as she tried to pronounce words. The Gardners decided to test a chimpanzee&#x27;s abilities with a gestural language, American Sign Language (ASL). They were not the first scientists to come up with this idea. Pepys advocated teaching sign language to chimps in the 17th century; de la Mettrie and Monboddo suggested the same in the 18th; and William Wundt in the early 20th century. But the Gardners were the first to conduct formal research into the matter.

The Gardners secured a 10-month-old chimpanzee they named Washoe in June 1966. Up the age 5, Washoe lived in a trailer in the backyard of the Gardner&#x27;s home in Reno, Nevada. The Gardners hired graduate students to work with Washoe, most notably Roger Fouts, who later became Washoe&#x27;s primary caregiver. No one around Washoe was allowed to speak; instead, they were instructed to use signs from American Sign Language (ASL) exclusively. Washoe&#x27;s primary caregivers were not fluent in ASL. The Gardners&#x27; employed native ASL speakers on subsequent chimp projects.

The Gardners tried to anticipate criticism of their work from the start. A word would not be counted as part of Washoe&#x27;s vocabulary until she had used it appropriately and spontaneously at least once a day for 15 consecutive days. (Penny Patterson used this framework for her studies with gorilla Koko as well, at least initially.) It proved to be a difficult benchmark to meet, especially when it came to the vocabulary involving things not typically encountered daily (horse, pipe, hankie).

In addition, the Gardners set up a double-blind testing apparatus for Washoe and subsequent chimp language projects. The chimp was seated in front of a screen that was sheltered from human view. One person would flash random slides for the ape to see, another person (who could not see the slides) would record the ape&#x27;s response, and a third person viewing from a one-way mirror in a separate room would independently record the chimp&#x27;s response. Two persons were employed to separately interpret Washoe because of the inherent ambiguity of reading an ape&#x27;s signs: chimp hands and body are different than humans&#x27;, and the meaning of ASL signs is shaped by their position and movement in space regarding one&#x27;s body. When the two interpretations were found to match each other as well as the picture that had been shown, the sign was accepted as correct. Anything else was recorded as an error. (In his book, &quot;Next of Kin&quot;, Roger Fouts wrote that he sometimes found the errors more illuminating than correct responses.)

The double-blind testing apparatus was set up to avoid unconscious bias, particularly a Clever Hans effect, in which humans unwittingly tip off their animal subjects through body language, facial expressions, or other means.

Tests showed Washoe reliably used 85 signs singly and in combination with other words by her third year with the Gardners. (The number of reliable signs rose to 132 later.). According to Eugene Linden, an independent journalist who focused on ape language research, she asked questions and used negatives (&quot;no&quot; in combination with another word).

When Washoe was five, the Gardners arranged to send her to the University of Oklahoma&#x27;s Institute of Primate Studies in Norman, Oklahoma, with Roger Fouts and Deborah Fouts. The Gardners continued to conduct sign-language research on infant chimpanzees, using Moja, Pili, Tatu, and Dar in subsequent studies. With these later projects, the couple sought to improve on the methodology of Project Washoe by securing chimps immediately after birth, employing fluent ASL speakers, providing the chimps with chimp &quot;siblings&quot;; and iterating upon their language training techniques.

===Washoe and Roger Fouts===
The Gardners were scientists schooled in behaviorism. Roger Fouts came to the chimp language studies as an animal lover pursuing a career in Child Development. These differing backgrounds corresponded with differing approaches. The Gardners initially wanted Fouts and other grad students to strictly use methods of operant conditioning — rewards and punishment — to teach Washoe, but Fouts believed that teaching a language was not the same as teaching a lab rat tricks. He recalled: According to behaviorism, the combination of a hungry chimp and ready-to-dispense food should be the perfect opportunity for reinforcement and learning. But the hungrier Washoe was, the quicker her signing deteriorated into pure repetition and finally outright begging.Fouts believed that chimpanzees needed room to learn in manner similar to human children, on their own timeline. He considered direct instruction ineffective, as it was often met with resistance. The child, not the parent, drives the learning process, argued Fouts:If you try to impose a rigid discipline while teaching a child or a chimp, you are working against the boundless curiosity and need for relaxed play that make learning possible.Though the Gardners instituted Skinnerian protocols in Washoe&#x27;s first year, they began to see advantages to Fouts&#x27; approach, acknowledging, &quot;Young chimpanzees and young children have a limited tolerance for school.&quot; But the issue exposed a key tension behind Project Washoe and similar language research to follow. On one hand, researchers needed a strict, repetitive process with clinical double-blind testing for their work to be accepted as science. Without such rigor, the body of work became vulnerable to criticism. On the other hand, researchers need to recognize the apes&#x27; emotional needs or they faced a different suite of problems. The Gardners fit more comfortably in the first camp, focused on scientific rigor; Roger Fouts and his wife Deborah fit more in the latter, later becoming advocates for animal rights and welfare. But the tension proved unavoidable.

=== Nim Chimpsky ===
In 1973, Herbert S. Terrace of Columbia University set out to improve upon the Washoe research using a chimp he named Nim Chimpsky (a pun on linguist Noam Chomsky). Over the course of Project Nim, the infant chimp was shuttled between locations and a revolving group of roughly 60 caregivers, mostly students and volunteers, few of whom were proficient in sign language.

Before he was 1 year old, Nim began fighting for dominance by biting his caregivers. The project was initially intended to last roughly 10 years. But after four years of research, Nim had become too difficult to manage and was returned to the Institute for Primate Studies in Oklahoma.

Nim&#x27;s chaotic upbringing, documented in Elizabeth Hess&#x27;s biography &quot;Nim Chimpsky: The Chimp Who Would Be Human&quot;, negatively impacted not only his behavior but his performance on language-related tasks. Even Terrace acknowledged this problem, noting that Nim&#x27;s &quot;emotional turmoil&quot; was a &quot;major obstacle&quot; in his progress.

After sending Nim back to Oklahoma, Terrace reviewed his data and concluded that Nim copied signs from his teachers to get a reward. Terrace argued that Nim did not initiate conversation or create sentences. Terrace said that he had not noticed this throughout the duration of the study but only upon reviewing video tape. Terrace ultimately became a popularly cited critic of ape language studies.

=== Koko ===

In 1972, Francine &quot;Penny&quot; Patterson, inspired by a lecture she attended by Allen and Beatrix Gardner, began a program to teach sign language to a lowlands gorilla named Koko. Unlike the Gardners, she did not limit her English speech around Koko. Koko mastered approximately 1,000 signs before her death in 2018. But her well-publicized achievements ignited significant controversy among scientists, who questioned whether she was truly using a &quot;language&quot; or simply responding to Patterson&#x27;s prompts. It is generally accepted that Koko did not demonstrate the use of syntax or grammar, key characteristics of language.

== Plastic tokens ==

Sarah and two other chimpanzees, Elizabeth and Peony, in the research programs of David Premack, demonstrated the ability to produce grammatical messages of token selections. The selections came from a vocabulary of several dozen plastic tokens; it took each of the chimpanzees hundreds of trials to reliably associate a token with a referent, such as an apple or banana. The tokens were chosen to be completely different in appearance from the referents. After learning these protocols, Sarah was then able to associate other tokens with consistent behaviors, such as negation, name-of, and if-then. The plastic tokens were placed on a magnetic slate, within a rectangular frame in a line. The tokens had to be selected and placed in a consistent order (a grammar) in order for the trainers to reward the chimpanzees.

One other chimpanzee, Gussie, was trained along with Sarah but failed to learn a single word. Other chimpanzees in the projects were not trained in the use of the tokens. All nine of the chimpanzees could understand gestures, such as supplication when asking for food; similarly, all nine could point to indicate some object, a gesture which is not seen in the wild. The supplication is seen in the wild, as a form of communication with other chimpanzees.

A juvenile Sumatran orangutan Aazk (named after the American Association of Zookeepers) who lived at the Roeding Park Zoo (Fresno, California) was taught by Gary L. Shapiro from 1973 to 1975 how to &quot;read &amp; write&quot; with plastic children&#x27;s letters, following the training techniques of David Premack. The technique of conditional discrimination was used such that the orangutan could eventually distinguish plastic letter (symbols) as representations of referents (e.g., object, actions) and &quot;read&quot; an increasingly longer series of symbols to obtain a referent (e.g., fruit) or &quot;write&quot; an increasingly longer series of symbols to request or describe a referent. While no claim of linguistic competence was made, Aazk&#x27;s performance demonstrated design features of language, many similar to those demonstrated by Premack&#x27;s chimpanzee, Sarah.

=== Kanzi ===
Kanzi, a bonobo, learned to communicate with a lexigram board at first by eavesdropping on the lessons researcher Sue Savage-Rumbaugh was giving to his adoptive mother. Kanzi used the lexigram board by pushing symbols that stand for words. The board was wired to a computer and symbols were vocalized out loud once pressed.

One day, Rumbaugh used the computer to say to Kanzi, &quot;Can you make the dog bite the snake?&quot; It is believed Kanzi had never heard this sentence before. In answering the question, Kanzi searched among the objects present until he found a toy dog and a toy snake, put the snake in the dog&#x27;s mouth, and used his thumb and finger to close the dog&#x27;s mouth over the snake. In 2001, Alexander Fiske-Harrison, writing in the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, observed that Kanzi was &quot;asked by an invisible interrogator through head-phones (to avoid cueing) to identify 35 different items in 180 trials. His success rate was 93 percent.&quot; In further testing, beginning when he was years old, Kanzi was asked 416 complex questions, responding correctly over 74% of the time. Kanzi has been observed verbalizing a meaningful noun to his sister.

Kanzi relies highly on the lexigrams for communication, and frequently uses them to specify where he wants to go, or an item he wants to have. He does this by expressing his goal (location or object) first, and his action (go, chase, carry, give, etc.) last. This notified researchers that Kanzi&#x27;s way of communicating was different from that of spoken English, especially because Kanzi would communicate many of his action words using simple gestures. In addition, Kanzi is frequently seen linking two action words together using the lexigrams, like &quot;I Tickle&quot;, &quot;Chase Hide&quot;, or &quot;Chase Bite&quot;. These word combinations are not necessarily structured in a way that humans would use spoken English, but they closely resemble lists, consisting of preferred actions, in preferred order of Kanzi&#x27;s social play. Because of this inconsistency of Kanzi&#x27;s use of language with the spoken English language, many question whether Kanzi&#x27;s understanding of English &quot;crosses the boundary with true language&quot;.

== Criticism and controversy ==

=== Language abilities ===
Controversy in the 1970s and early 1980s centered on different understandings of language. The Gardners, Roger Fouts and Penny Patterson — all psychologists — operated from a lay person&#x27;s understanding of language as simply a means of communication (as in the popular term &quot;body language&quot;). They succeeded in teaching apes a number of signs, but doing so lead to inflated claims about &quot;talking apes&quot; in the mainstream media.

Linguists understood language as a complex, structured system of communication defined by several key characteristics. Teaching apes to use isolated signs was, from this perspective, nothing to do with language. Many argued (in line with Terrace) that the apes merely demonstrated a form of operant conditioning, similar to pigeons trained to peck buttons in a specific order. So, when the psychologists trumpeted apes&#x27; acquisition of speech or language, other scholars— especially linguists — criticized these claims and pointed out problems with them. The most significant and enduring criticism regarded the lack of evidence supporting great apes&#x27; use of syntax and grammatical sentence structure. Without demonstrating the use of sentences, the apes could not be said to have acquired language.

The Gardners did not set out to focus on sentence creation. Terrace, however, did. The Nim Chimpsky study had been designed to test a chimp&#x27;s ability to create sentences. Its report of negative results came as a shock to the field. A critic of the ape language research organized a &quot;Clever Hans&quot; conference in 1980 trumpeting the Nim study and suggesting that scientists working on animal language were charlatans. To Irene Pepperburg, a research associate who had been working with a parrot named Alex, the conference came as a wakeup call, pushing her to avoid claims about &quot;language&quot; and sticking to &quot;vocal communication.&quot; As a result of the Terrace study and the subsequent conference, funding for ape language research abruptly evaporated.

With their funding gone, researchers turned to new projects. Some, feeling responsible to maintain care of their animal subjects, largely abandoned science. Penny Patterson, for example, turned to PR work and children&#x27;s media to raise funds to care for Koko and gorilla Michael. Roger Fouts struggled to show results for an NIH grant tied to Washoe teaching her foster baby signs. (Fouts was accused by a one of his staff of faking data; another former grad student, Sue Savage-Rumbaugh, criticized him for over-interpretation.) Ultimately, Fouts proved more concerned with animals rights and welfare than scientific research. In the 1980s, he partnered with Jane Goodall on a campaign to improve conditions for chimpanzees in NIH-funded labs, an effort that effectively alienated him from fellow scientists.

The Gardners, unlike Fouts and Patterson, seemed to show little concern for the chimps&#x27; welfare after their studies ended. The Gardners were seen as the most data-driven and rigorous of the sign-language researchers. In 1989, they edited a volume that incorporated new data and addressed earlier criticisms of their work. &quot;Teaching Sign Language to Chimpanzees&quot; described &quot;the continuity between human behavior and the rest of animal animal&quot; and found &quot;no barriers to be broken, no chasms to be bridged, only unknown territory to be charted.&quot; In contrast to earlier studies, the book was favorably reviewed by scholars.

=== Ethics ===
The 2011 documentary Project Nim drew public attention to the plight of apes used in human language studies. In its aftermath, a new critique gained favor.

This critique argued that isolating apes from their species and drilling them in the communication method of another (&quot;Homo sapiens&quot;) was a misguided effort to sate human curiosity, not science. The apes involved, largely isolated from their species, showed recognizable signs of trauma. Every ape subject refused to participate in language lessons to some degree. Making assumptions about ape&#x27;s abilities with involuntary subjects forced to live in highly unnatural conditions was seen as not only unscientific but ethically wrong.

A 2024 report from &quot;Nature&quot; about chimpanzee vocal communication drew upon both scientific and ethical critiques. It called for a reevaluation of ape communication skills, noting that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence — particularly when based on a few untrustworthy representatives (untrustworthy due to the &quot;neglect and cruelty&quot; inflicted on the apes).

==Contemporary research==
Among primates, autonomous behaviors such as body posture, facial expressions, vocalizations and scent production have been observed to convey information to other animals, revealing emotions or alerts about potential danger. Affiliative behaviors like grooming are used to promote group cohesion and individual status, while displays of aggression create divisions among groups. Humans, by contrast, have developed a reliance on verbal language. Primatologist Tetsuro Matsuzawa proposes in his cognitive tradeoff hypothesis that humans exchanged short-term and working memory for better language skills over their evolution.

==Question asking==

David and Anne Premack observed that their enculturated apes successfully learned to answer complex questions and requests (including the question words &quot;who&quot;, &quot;what&quot;, &quot;when&quot;, &quot;where&quot;, and &quot;why&quot;) but did not ask questions themselves: &quot;Though she [Sarah] understood the question, she did not herself ask any questions – unlike the child who asks interminable questions, such as What that? Who making noise? When Daddy come home? Me go Granny&#x27;s house?&quot;

Chantek, an orangutan, is said to have asked his caregiver, anthropologist Lyn Miles, &quot;What is that?&quot; while pointing at an especially bright moon one night. Other researchers in primate cognition have found evidence of ape inquiries while noting that the structure of their queries may not look exactly like human question-asking. For example, researcher Cat Hobaiter said that &quot;If a chimpanzee looks its handler in the eyes and points to a banana, it may be interpreted that the ape is asking to have the banana.&quot;

<text>Matthews Aurora Funeral Solutions (formerly the Aurora Casket Company) is one of the largest manufacturers of caskets and funerary urns in the United States, selling over 38% of the country&#x27;s caskets . The Aurora, Indiana–based company is a subsidiary of Pittsburgh-based Matthews International. The company makes both wooden and metal caskets and urns for holding cremated remains. It also provides supplies and consulting services for funeral homes.

== History ==
The company traces its roots back to 1890, when John Backman began making wooden caskets by hand. At the time, the Aurora Casket Company employed 20 people. In the 1920s, John&#x27;s son William Backman and his son-in-law William Barrott joined the company. For decades, the company was controlled by the Backman and Barrott families.

In 2012, the Aurora Casket Company was acquired by private equity firm Kohlberg &amp; Co. By 2014, the company had about 850 employees and was one of the Cincinnati metropolitan area&#x27;s largest private companies. In June 2015, it was acquired by Matthews International and renamed Matthews Aurora Funeral Solutions.

<text>Cameron University is a public university in Lawton, Oklahoma. It offers more than 50 degrees through both undergraduate and graduate programs. The degree programs emphasize the liberal arts, science and technology, and graduate and professional studies. It was founded in 1908, soon after Oklahoma was admitted as a state, as one of six agricultural high schools in the largely rural region.

==History==
The Oklahoma Legislature created six agricultural high schools in each judicial district in 1908, a year after statehood. Lawton was chosen over Anadarko in April 1909 to receive a high school; the town had already set aside a portion of land to develop a higher educational institution. The University Improvement Association, under the auspices of the Lawton Chamber of Commerce, organized the effort to acquire of land two miles (three kilometers) west of the town. Its original goal was to secure a private Baptist college. Arrangements with the Baptists fell through in the summer of 1908. The Catholic Church approached the Association with an offer to found an all-male institution on the site. This plan was rejected by the town leaders, who were predominantly Protestant.

What was known as the Cameron State School of Agriculture was named for Rev. Evan Dhu Cameron, a Baptist minister and Oklahoma&#x27;s first State Superintendent of Schools. The first classes were held on Statehood Day, November 16, 1909, in the basement of a bank building, while a new campus building was being constructed.

In 1927 Cameron added junior college-level classes to the school&#x27;s offerings, when local higher education needs exceeded what was available in southwest Oklahoma. With this expansion, the institution was renamed as Cameron State Agricultural College. By 1941, the high school preparatory classes were dropped. Cameron was classified solely as a junior college that year, when the Oklahoma State System of Higher Education was formed and joined the group of institutions governed by the Board of Regents of Oklahoma A&amp;M Colleges.

Based on additional development of programs and curriculum, in 1966 the Legislature passed a bill authorizing the Oklahoma State Regents for Higher Education to allow the college to award Baccalaureate degrees. The institution&#x27;s name was shortened to Cameron College in 1971 and, with more program expansion, changed to Cameron University in 1974. As the 1970s continued, Cameron demonstrated its dedication to expanded academic offerings through the construction of a fine arts facility designed to serve students in theatre, music, broadcasting, and speech communication.

Dr. Donald J. Owen served as Cameron&#x27;s president from 1969 to 1980. A Cameron graduate, Owen worked to build academic programs and develop relationships with the Lawton community, as well as the Oklahoma State University system, under which CU fell during his tenure. Cameron&#x27;s sports teams, particularly football and basketball, excelled during that time. A new President&#x27;s residence was constructed on Gore Boulevard, west of the campus.

In 1988, State Regents expanded Cameron&#x27;s functions to include graduate offerings at the master&#x27;s degree level. This was the first change granted to an Oklahoma institution since Cameron was given the authority to offer bachelor&#x27;s degrees more than 20 years earlier. In the 1990s, Cameron University came under the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma.

Don Davis was President of Cameron University from 1980 to 2002. His father, Clarence L. Davis, was President of Cameron from 1957 to 1960. As a child, Davis lived in the President&#x27;s house on campus with his parents and sister. As a former legislator from Lawton, Davis was able to secure funding for Cameron that supported it in developing as the premier institute for higher education in southwestern Oklahoma. Also during Davis&#x27; tenure, a classical radio station, KCCU 89.3, was founded. Numerous renowned scholars, including Richard Leakey and Cornel West, have spoken at Cameron&#x27;s annual Academic Festival.

In May 2004, Cameron took over the Duncan Higher Education Center in Duncan, Oklahoma. It was renamed as Cameron University - Duncan.

<text>Minsk (), also known as M1NSK, is a Belarusian brand of motorcycles, scooters, ATVs and snowmobiles, produced by the Minsk Motorcycle and Bicycle Plant (MMVZ). The first M1A motorcycle was released in 1951. Since 2007, the company is a private enterprise. More than 6.5 million Minsk motorcycles have been sold worldwide.

M1NSK also builds bicycles branded as Aist.

==The beginning==

After World War II the documentation and equipment of the German DKW factory in Zschopau were taken to the Soviet Union as war reparations. Production of the RT 125 model began in Moscow under the M1A brand. By the Order No.494 of the Ministry of automotive industry of the Soviet Union dated 12 July 1951 the production of M1A was transferred from Moscow to the Minsk Motorcycle and Bicycle Plant (MMVZ, then Motovelo). This model was imported into the United Kingdom by Neval Motorcycles, marketed as Neval.

==MMVZ==

The new models code name system was introduced in 1973 with the new Minsk MMVZ-3.111.

Reliability and simplicity made Minsk motorcycles a cult brand in Vietnam, which was the most extensive export market. Minsk motorcycles were among the Soviet motorcycles that were distributed by SATRA, UK, under the Minsk Saturn 125 and Cossack brand names from 1973 to 1979.

==M1NSK==

In 2007 Motovelo became a private company. Motorcycles sold under &quot;M1NSK&quot; brand are rebadged Chinese products. For example, M1nsk TRX 300i is a Zongshen RX3.

<text>Santa Maria da Feira () is a city and a municipality in Aveiro District in Portugal, 23 km from central Porto. The population in 2011 was 139,309, in an area of 215.88 km².

==History ==

Santa Maria is located in area that allowed it to be a crossroads of various peoples. Ancient Roman roadways connected Porto, Viseu, Lisbon and Braga and intersected the region, and was used until the 19th century. In addition, pre-Roman castros dotted the territory.

The Castle of Santa Maria da Feira is the fulcrum of the history of the region, and an important point in the Reconquista. In 868, Alfonso III of León created the administrative and military region, that he called &quot;Terra de Santa Maria&quot;, he laid its defences in the military fortress that existed there, in Civitas Sanctae Mariae.
Since 1117, Feira was the location of one of the most important fairs in Portugal, which, over time, gave the town its name. The fair was established in the shadow of the castle.

In the time of king Denis of Portugal, Feira already was the see of a &quot;julgado&quot; (old administrative division). This is testified by an ancient document called &quot;Foral Velho&quot;. It was awarded a new foral in 1514, when Manuel I of Portugal was the King of Portugal.

== Art ==
Danonaselo is a sculpture created by San Damon at the very beginning of the creation of Oniroscopism in 2004 and even before. It is part of the S.O.G. series (Geometric Oniroscopic Sculpture). Danonaselo is a very specific proper name given by San Damon to this sculpture. All the difficulty comes from the fact that Damon had to move from 2D drawing to 3D sculpture with the particular twists and angles that emerge from the strange character. Indeed, the night lighting surrounding the Danonaselo and the daylight that illuminates it, and in particular the presence of the sun that revolves around it, makes us see a totally different character. Shadows are thrown to the ground and angles are projected on the facades. The Danonaselo is placed for life in a public square in Portugal, in Fiães in the entity of Santa Maria da Feira and is part of the Portuguese heritage. The work is three metres high and looks out, as San Damon wanted, towards the ocean through the lands of Mozelos, Lourosa, São Paio de Oleiros, etc. The roundabout on which the Danonaselo is placed is decorated with certain flowers in harmony with the work. A plaque on the base explains the meaning of the work and a poem written by San Damon encloses it.

The seat of the municipality is Feira, famous for its medieval castle which was the residence of Portugal&#x27;s first king, Afonso Henriques, for a short period of time. The castle, located at the top of a hill, was of considerable strategic importance during its time.

==Culture==
The municipal holiday is January 20. It&#x27;s the day when the whole municipality celebrates the &quot;Fogaceiras&quot;. The &quot;Fogaceiras&quot; is a special local holiday. During the Middle Ages, the lands of &quot;Santa Maria&quot; (as it was known back then) were infested by the dark plague.

<text>The Olympic Hymn (, ), also known as the Olympic Anthem, is a choral cantata by opera composer Spyridon Samaras (1861–1917), with Demotic Greek lyrics by Greek poet Kostis Palamas. Both poet and composer were the choice of the Greek Demetrius Vikelas, who was the first President of the International Olympic Committee.

==History==
The anthem was performed for the first time for the ceremony of opening of the first edition at the 1896 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece. In the following years, every hosting nation commissioned to various musicians the composition of a specific Olympic hymn for their own edition of the games.

The anthem by Samaras and Palamas was declared the official Olympic Anthem by the International Olympic Committee in 1958 at the 54th Session of the IOC in Tokyo, Japan. The anthem was performed in English at the 1960 Winter Olympics in Squaw Valley and since then it has been played at each Olympic Games: during the opening ceremony when the Olympic flag is hoisted, and during the closing ceremony when the Olympic flag is lowered.

The Olympic Hymn was also used, along with the Olympic flag, to represent the Unified Team of former Soviet states at the 1992 Winter Olympics and the 1992 Summer Olympics.

==Lyrics==
==List of performances at the Olympics==
Before 2016, the anthem had been recorded and performed in many different languages, usually as a result of the hosting of either form of the Games in various countries. However, in the 2008 Olympic opening and closing ceremonies, in Beijing, China, Greek was sung instead of the host country&#x27;s official language, Mandarin. Also in the 2016 Olympic opening and closing ceremonies in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, English was sung instead of host country&#x27;s official language, Brazilian Portuguese. Since 2018, the IOC requires that the anthem be performed in either English, Greek or instrumentally (although this is optional depending on the organizer of an Olympics).

<text>Frans Suell (9 June 1744 – 15 November 1817) was a Swedish businessman.

==Life==
His grandfather Franz Suell immigrated to Malmö from Holstein in the mid 18th century. Frans grew up working in his father Niclas&#x27; shop selling mostly provisions; after studying two years at Lund University, he entered the tobacco importing trade, in which he was successful.

Suell&#x27;s career coincided with the American Revolution, a period of political disorder in the chief tobacco-growing regions of North America. These events broke the power of the &quot;tobacco lairds&quot; based in Glasgow and other British port cities, and made it possible for Suell to import tobacco directly from North America. He prospered, and beginning in 1775 led a consortium of local shippers in the successful public works project of dredging and embanking the Malmö harbour. It is for this work that he is remembered in Malmö today.

Suell also acquired interests in many other industries connected with the spread of the Industrial Revolution to Sweden, such as textiles, the smelting of iron, and the refining of beet sugar.

==Legacy==
Two ships have been named in his honour: MT &quot;Frans Suell&quot; (1958) and MS &quot;Frans Suell&quot; (1992)</text><links>

<text>IEEE 1284, also known as the Centronics port, is a standard that defines bi-directional parallel communications between computers and other devices. It was originally developed in the 1970s by Centronics before its IEEE standardization.

== History ==
In the 1970s, Centronics developed the now-familiar printer parallel port that soon became a &quot;de facto&quot; standard. Centronics had introduced the first successful low-cost seven-wire print head, which used a series of solenoids to pull the individual metal pins to strike a ribbon and the paper.

A dot matrix print head consists of a series of metal pins arranged in a vertical row. Each pin is attached to some sort of actuator, a solenoid in the case of Centronics, which can pull the pin forward to strike a ribbon and the paper. The entire print head is moved horizontally in order to print a line of text, striking the paper several times to produce a matrix for each character. Character sets on early printers normally used 7 by 5 &quot;pixels&quot; to produce 80-column text.

The complexity of printing a character as a sequence of columns of dots is managed by the printer electronics, which receives character encodings from the computer one at a time, with the bits transferred serially or in parallel. As printers grew in sophistication, and the cost of memory dropped, printers began adding increasing amounts of buffer memory, initially a line or two, but then whole pages and then documents.

The original port design was send-only, allowing &quot;data&quot; to be sent from the host computer to the printer. Separate pins in the port allow status information to be sent back to the computer. This was a serious limitation as printers became &quot;smarter&quot; and a richer set of status codes were desired. This led to an early expansion of the system introduced by HP, the &quot;Bitronics&quot; implementation released in 1992. This used the status pins of the original port to form a 4-bit parallel port for sending arbitrary data back to the host.

A further modification, &quot;Bi-Directional&quot;, used the status pins to indicate the direction of data flow on the 8-bit main data bus; by indicating there was data to send to the host on one of the pins, all eight data pins became available for use. This proved adaptable, and led to the &quot;Enhanced Parallel Port&quot; standard, which worked like Bi-Directional mode but greatly increased the signalling speeds to 2 MB/s, and later the &quot;Extended Capability Port&quot; version increased this to 2.5 MB/s.

In 1991 the Network Printing Alliance was formed to develop a new standard. In March 1994, the IEEE 1284 specification was released. 1284 included all of these modes, and allowed operation in any of them.

== Characteristics ==
The IEEE 1284 standard allows for faster throughput and bidirectional data flow with a theoretical maximum throughput of 4 MB/s; actual throughput is around 2 MB/s depending on hardware. In the printer venue, this allows for faster printing and back-channel status and management. Since the new standard allowed the peripheral to send large amounts of data back to the host, devices that had previously used SCSI interfaces could be produced at a much lower cost. This included scanners, tape drives, hard disks, computer networks connected directly via parallel interface, network adapters and other devices. No longer was the consumer required to purchase an expensive SCSI card—they could simply use their built-in parallel interface.

The parallel interface has since been mostly displaced by local area network interfaces and USB 2.0.

== Modes ==
IEEE 1284 can operate in five modes:

* Compatibility Mode, also known as Centronics standard or Standard Parallel Port (SPP), is a uni-directional implementation with only a few differences from the original Centronics design. This mode is almost exclusively used for printers. The only signals that the printer can send back to the host are some fixed-meaning status lines that signal common error conditions, such as the printer running out of paper.
* Nibble Mode is an interface that allows the device to transmit data four bits (a nibble) at a time, (re)using four of the status lines of Compatibility Mode for data. This is the Bi-tronics mode introduced by HP and is generally used for enhanced printer status. Although never officially supported with these, Nibble Mode works with most of the pre-IEEE-1284 Centronics interfaces as well.
* Byte Mode, also known as &quot;Bi-Directional&quot; (although all modes except Compatibility Mode are in fact bi-directional), is a half-duplex mode that allows the device to transmit eight bits at a time using the same data lines that are used for the other direction. This mode is supported on a minority of pre-IEEE-1284 interfaces as well, such as those built into the IBM PS/2 computers; because of this, it is sometimes unofficially called the PS/2 mode.
* Enhanced Parallel Port (EPP) is a half-duplex bi-directional interface designed to allow devices like printers, scanners, or storage devices to transmit large amounts of data while quickly being able to switch channel direction. EPP can provide up to 2 MB/s bandwidth, approximately 15 times the speed achieved with normal parallel-port communication with far less CPU overhead.
* Extended Capability Port (ECP) is a half-duplex bi-directional interface similar to EPP, except that PC implementations use direct memory access (usually ISA DMA on channel 3) to provide even faster data transfer than EPP by having the ISA DMA hardware and the parallel port interface hardware handle the work of transferring the data instead of letting the CPU do this work. Many devices that interface using this mode support RLE compression. ECP can provide up to 2.5 MB/s of bandwidth, which is the natural limit of 8-bit ISA DMA. An ECP interface on a PC can improve transfers to pre-IEEE-1284 printers as well, by reducing the CPU load during the transfer; however, the transfer in that case is unidirectional.

Most recent computers that include a parallel port can operate the port in ECP or EPP mode, or both simultaneously.

IEEE-1284 requires that bi-directional device communication is always initiated in Nibble Mode. If the host receives no reply in this mode, it will assume that the device is a legacy printer, and enter Compatibility Mode. Otherwise, the best mode that is supported on both sides of the connection is negotiated between the host and client devices by exchanging standardized Nibble Mode messages.

== Connectors and cables ==

An IEEE-compliant cable must meet several standards of wiring and quality. Three types of connectors are defined:

* Type A: DB-25 25 pin, for the host connection.
* Type B: Centronics (officially called &quot;Micro Ribbon&quot;) 36-pin, for the printer or device connection.
* Type C: Mini-Centronics (MDR36 or HPCN36) 36-pin, a half-pitch, smaller alternative for the device connection that has not proven popular.

There are two kinds of IEEE 1284 cables:

* IEEE 1284-I: uses IEEE 1284-A and IEEE 1284-B connectors.
* IEEE 1284-II: uses IEEE 1284-C connectors.

In IEEE 1284 Daisy Chain Specification, up to eight devices can be connected to a single parallel port.

All modes use TTL voltage logic levels, which limits the possible cable length to a few meters unless expensive special cables are used.

== Standards ==
* IEEE 1284-2000: Standard Signaling Method for a Bi-directional Parallel Peripheral Interface for Personal Computers
* IEEE 1284.1-1997: Transport Independent Printer/System Interface- a protocol for returning printer configuration and status
* IEEE 1284.2: Standard for Test, Measurement and Conformance to IEEE 1284 (not approved)
* IEEE 1284.3-2000: Interface and Protocol Extensions to IEEE 1284-Compliant Peripherals and Host Adapters- a protocol to allow sharing of the parallel port by multiple peripherals (daisy chaining)
* IEEE 1284.4-2000: Data Delivery and Logical Channels for IEEE 1284 Interfaces- allows a device to carry on multiple, concurrent exchanges of data

<text>São João da Madeira (), is a city and a municipality in northwestern region of the Portuguese Norte region. It&#x27;s part of the larger Porto Metropolitan Area, located 30 km from central Porto. The population in 2011 was 21,713. With an area of 7.94 km2, it is the smallest municipality in Portugal. In 2010, the city was distinguished in Portuguese quality of life studies as the &quot;Best Municipality to Live In&quot;.

São João da Madeira stood out also recently by introducing in 2011 the Industrial Tourism in Portugal and, in 2012, becoming the first Portuguese municipality to offer almost integral wireless coverage in its municipal area.
São João da madeira is also known as the capital city of the shoes , this was due to the fact that there is the so-called shoe museum there.

==History==

The origins of São João da Madeira extend back to the consecutive settlements by Celt, Roman, Moors and Visigoths. Yet, historically the first mention of São João occurred in 1088: the first reference was the phrase &quot;Uilla de Sancto Ioanne de Mateira&quot;, that appeared in the sale of lands in the territory. The designation of &quot;Madeira&quot; that appeared was in reference to the abundance of trees and forest, that continued to exist in the region.

In the 19th century, São João da Madeira registered an intense growth, the fruit of commercial and industrial development linked to the manufacture of hats and dairy industry. J. Gomes de Pinho was the first empressario to establish a hat factory in 1802, but it was António José de Oliveira Júnior, an ex-functionary who would drive the local industry with his establishment in 1892 of the first fur hat factory. It would eventually become one of the major symbols of São João da Madeira&#x27;s new economy, the &quot;Empresa Industrial de Chapelaria Lda.&quot; Totally mechanized by the early 19th century, it would become the largest factory in the Iberian Peninsula by the end of the 19th century. Oliveira Júnior was recognized by the national government, who issued him a diploma of Industrial and Agricultural Merit, its citizens later honouring him with a bust and the naming of one of its roads. The prosperity that developed, also supported by the nacscent growth of the footwear industry, allowed the growth of a dynamic centre that attracted more inhabitants with the possibility of work.

With progress and modernization there was a radical alteration in the architecture of the community. The primitive church was demolished in 1883, and the following year the new temple was blessed and inaugurated (11 July 1888).

In 1908 King Manuel II of Portugal inaugurated the &quot;Caminho de Ferro do Vale do Vouga&quot; (&quot;Vouga Valley Railline&quot;) which, along with the construction of new streets and roads allowed the parallel growth of the region. With the construction of the local hospital, the introduction of electricity into the region was finally concluded, while at the same time the cultural arena was enhanced with the establishment of the &quot;Grupo Patriótico Sanjoanense&quot; a philharmonic band and cultural centre (led by the Jesuit priest and histographer ).

It was not until 11 October 1926 that the region achieved both economic and political autonomy as a full municipality, a fact that was seen by locals as enviable due to its inferior status administratively (until then it was a civil parish of the neighbouring municipality of Oliveira de Azeméis). Its independence was recorded in the local newspaper &quot;O Regional&quot; as born &quot;of a group of young people with blood that boiled in their veins and anxious for the constant progress of São João da Madeira&quot;. At that time, the Portuguese government considered São João da Madeira one of the most important regional industrial centres with its progress suffocated by its inferior status. São João da Madeira became a city at 28 June 1984, by the law n.º 13/84.

By the second World War, the felt industry grew in Portugal, and during the 1940s the production of fur and felt production was centralized in the factories of the municipality, with the establishment of the &quot;Cortadoria Nacional do Pêlo&quot;, which was nationalized in 1945. In 1946, 1775 people worked in the hat-making industrial in Portugal, while 1212 were located in São João da Madeira. The activity of this industry was later immortalized by João da Silva Correia, in his romance &quot;Unhas Negras&quot;, a pejorative reference to the works who worked the open cauldrons that darken and destroyed their fingernails (&quot;unhas negras&quot; literally means &quot;darken/blacken fingernails&quot;). The term was later generally used to identify the citizenry of the municipality. The use of the word &quot;Labor&quot;, on the coat-of-arms of the municipality, was intended to signify the importance of these workers in the development of the region. Regardless, the hat-making industries slowly declined in the following decades, with the decline in the use of hats, and the shoe-making industry grew in importance, resulting in its reference as the &quot;Capital of Footwear&quot; in Portugal ().

==Geography==
 
The municipality of São João da Madeira is situated in the extreme north of the district of Aveiro, in the historical region of Beira Litoral, occupying a position central in the subregion of Entre Douro e Vouga. It is approximately 18 kilometres from the Portuguese Atlantic coast, 32 kilometres from the regional capital of Porto, 40 kilometres from Aveiro and 275 kilometres from the national capital. It straddles the a hilltop portion of the geomorphological massif that extends from 50 to 400 metres above sea level. It is crossed at its farthest limit by the River Ul, which runs north to south.

The climate in this region is maritime in character, with heavy winter rainfall countered by short dry summers.

It is limited in the north by the civil parish of Milheirós de Poiares and west by Arrifana (both in the municipality of Santa Maria da Feira), while its southern border aligns with the civil parishes of Cucujães and São Roque and eastern frontier with Nogueira do Cravo and Macieira de Sarnes (in the municipality of Oliveira de Azeméis).

São João da Madeira is a rare example of a municipality with only one civil parish (). Apart from its small dimensions, São João da Madeira is the second largest city in the district of Aveiro and the largest in the Entre Douro e Vouga subregion.

==Economy==
Its economy is based on services and industry, employing 62% in secondary and 38% in tertiary sectors. In 2007, there were 3660 registered companies dominated by micro and small businesses and employing 74% of the workers. São João da Madeira&#x27;s motto, translated as &quot;Labor, City of Work&quot;, appeals to its industrial history.

In 2007, there were 3660 companies in São João da Madeira: despite being the smallest municipality in size in Portugal, it is the twentieth in economic turnover. It is the head of shoe industry in Portugal, an important industrial activity in Portugal, having the seat of the Shoe Technological Centre. Beyond that, the city is developing a Science Park and main &quot;Centro Empresarial e Tecnológico&quot; (&quot;Business and Technology Centre&quot;), as well as important commercial, financial and service centre of the region, having its largest Shopping Mall and largest concentration of banks. Inaugurated in 2008 by President Aníbal Cavaco Silva the centre is a modern project by architect Filipe Oliveira Dias, that services as an incubator for high technology businesses in order to diversify the local market. It is actually the first of ten buildings in the zone, of a planned 80,000 square metre technological park, including the &quot;Núcleo de Investigação e Desenvolvimento&quot; (&quot;Investigation and Development Nucleus&quot;). In 2009, a series of protocols of understanding were signed to establish a regional network of &quot;Innovation and Competitivity&quot; between business and education, in order to foster technological innovation.

Shoe manufacturing has been one of the city&#x27;s main economic industries, and regularly, the city has been referred to as &quot;a Capital do Calçado&quot; (&quot;the Capital of Footwear&quot;); many of Portugal&#x27;s shoe manufacturers and ancillary businesses, including the &quot;Centro Tecnológico do Calçado&quot; (&quot;Footwear Technology Centre&quot;) and &quot;Centro de Formação Profissional da Indústria do Calçado&quot; (&quot;Footwear Industry Centre for Professional Learning&quot;) are based in São João da Madeira. Similarly, regional industries have been responsible for the production of 20% the world&#x27;s felt hats and continues to be the major national producer. The quality of São João da Madeira&#x27;s head apparel has, at one time, been recognized internationally, and incorporated in fashion house (such as Hermès). In addition, the movie industry was responsible for supporting this industry, with headwear produced for films such as &quot;Public Enemies&quot;,&quot;Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull&quot; (Indiana Jones&#x27; hat, for example) and the Mad Hatter&#x27;s famous hat in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;. Other secondary industries in the economy include automobile components, industrial textiles, mattresses, glues and tubing manufacturing, which are concentrated in four industrial zones: Travessas, Orreiro, Devesa-Velha e Oliva.

Its central place within the urban hierarchy has slowly consolidated many of the main services of the Entre Douro e Vouga subregion; along with Santa Maria da Feira it has contributed to the policentralizism of Greater Porto basin. São João da Madeira is an important banking and financial centre; in 2007, there were 1288 employed in the banking sector, equivalent to the same number in Aveiro.

==Tourism==
Industrial tourism has increased, and S. João da Madeira was the first city in the country to introduce this tourism.

The routes include the only pencil factory in operation in Portugal, the shoe and headwear industry.

A Vocational Training Centre of the Footwear Industry and the Portuguese Technological Footwear Centre are part of this industrial tourism route, as well as the Hat Museum, one symbol of the city and unique in the Iberian Peninsula.

<doc id="859769" wikidata="Q3746329" url="?curid=859769" title="Scourge of the Underworld">
<text>The Scourge of the Underworld is the name of a series of fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

Writer/editor Mark Gruenwald originally created the Scourge in 1985 as a plot device intended to thin the criminal population of the Marvel Universe, in particular eliminating those supervillain characters he deemed to be too minor, redundant, or ill-conceived. Numerous other characters have used the name, often with differing motives and loyalties.

==Organization==
The Scourge is originally depicted as an individual vigilante dedicated to the assassination of criminals. This person, whose true name has never been revealed, is seen over the course of several months murdering known supervillains. The Scourge approaches a supervillain in disguise, shoots him or her with an explosive-tipped bullet, shouts his catchphrase &quot;Justice is served!&quot; and disappears. This first iteration&#x27;s killing spree reaches its apex in &quot;Captain America&quot; #319, where he guns down eighteen such criminals at an underworld meeting held to devise a way of countering the menace of the Scourge. The Scourge disguises himself as the bartender, whom nobody thinks to search. When Captain America captures the Scourge in the following issue, the character claims to be the brother of the Enforcer, whom Scourge killed because his criminal activities shamed their father. He claims that this crime led to him creating the Scourge persona with help from a private investigator only identified as &quot;Domino&quot;, who provides him detailed information on the supervillain community. Immediately after making this confession, the Scourge is himself shot and killed by an unseen assailant, who cries &quot;Justice is served!&quot; in the fashion of the Scourge&#x27;s other killings.

Following this story the Scourge of the Underworld went dormant for a few years, with only a series of imposters and holographic illusions serving to keep the character&#x27;s name and image present in published comics. &quot;Captain America&quot; writer Mark Gruenwald explained that while he did want to resolve the mystery of the Scourge sooner rather than later, he feared that if he brought the Scourge back too soon he would run out of low-tier villains for him to kill and would have to either start killing off mid-tier villains or create new villains for the sole purpose of being victims of the Scourge.

In &quot;Captain America&quot; #326, Captain America is confronted by a hologram of the Scourge, operated by Doctor Faustus, to try to kill Captain America via having him confront &quot;ghosts&quot; of villains who had recently died in battle against him. In &quot;Captain America&quot; #347, Albert Malik, the communist villain who assumed the Red Skull identity during the 1950s, is broken out of prison by a mercenary. After killing Malik, the mercenary shouts the Scourge&#x27;s catchphrase. In &quot;Captain America&quot; #350, a Scourge is part of an assembly of villains working for the Red Skull. The Red Skull gloats of having created the Scourge organization as part of a massive network of criminal organizations. The Scourge presented is killed by John Walker, who had recently assumed the Captain America identity.

In &quot;Captain America&quot; #351, the Commission on Super-Hero Affairs had an agent impersonate the Scourge of the Underworld to &quot;kill&quot; Captain America due to Walker&#x27;s identity having been made public and whose parents had been killed as a result of retaliation by the Watchdog organization. This story featured the first in-story appearance of the Scourge&#x27;s official costume (see Appearances below).

A new Scourge appears in &quot;Captain America&quot; #358-362, and attempts to kill the criminal super-scientist &quot;The Power Broker&quot;. This version appears to be operating independently of the Red Skull, claiming to want the Power Broker dead due to the fact that his treatment to give people super-powers left his brother horribly deformed. USAgent (John Walker) and former Captain America ally Vagabond stop the Scourge, who is then shot by a hidden gunman who screams &quot;Justice Is Served&quot;. Walker allows him to die from his wound in order to try to find the gunman.

In &quot;Captain America&quot; #394, after a failed attempt by the German government to arrest and try Red Skull for crimes against humanity ends in Red Skull escaping, Skull went into hiding and left three clone corpses, of himself and his associates Crossbones and Mother Night, by a message &quot;Justice is served!&quot; to fake their deaths. During a later meeting of his various terrorist groups, a man identified as the Scourge is executed via the Red Dust of Death after lying about several failed attempts on lives of super-villains Red Skull had marked for death. He accuses his henchman of &quot;ruining the good name of the Scourge of the Underworld&quot; with his failures. Mother Night later uses her illusion casting power to create an illusion of the Scourge, to allow additional henchmen of the Red Skull to avoid capture by Captain America.

In 1993, Mark Gruenwald, who created the Scourge of the Underworld and wrote all of the appearances of the character in &quot;Captain America&quot;, wrote a four-part &quot;USAgent&quot; mini-series, in order to resolve the looming mysteries involving the character and his various forms and masters.

The mini-series revealed that the Scourge of the Underworld was created by Thomas Holloway, the former Golden Age superhero known as Angel, who ran the organization with help from Domino and two henchmen known as Caprice and Bloodstain. Holloway had initially gone into retirement after a battle with a villain resulted in the death of a civilian. When the second Age of Heroes came about decades later, Halloway vowed to eliminate the newer generation of supervillains through any means necessary to protect the people, and therefore established the Scourge organization. The mini-series also confirmed the existence of female Scourge of the Underworld agents, as one of the villain&#x27;s previous kills (Titania by a Scourge impersonating fellow villain Gold Digger in a women&#x27;s locker room) had left unanswered questions to whether or not the murder of Titania was done by a female Scourge, since the villain would not be able to pass as a woman in such an intimate setting as a women&#x27;s locker room.

The series has Vagabond trying to join the group and is sent on her first mission. Unfortunately she finds her first victim, a former Daredevil villain known as the Matador, to now be a single father who has served his time and abandoned his criminal lifestyle, who begs Vagabond to spare him for his son&#x27;s sake. Marked for death for failing to do her assignment, Vagabond recruits USAgent to help bring down the organization. During the ensuing fight, the Scourge sent to kill Vagabond and USAgent is captured but killed as USAgent is taken before Bloodstain, who attempts to brainwash USAgent into joining the Scourges. Bloodstain reveals himself to be USAgent&#x27;s deceased brother Mike Walker, though it&#x27;s never revealed if this is true or just a disguise designed to manipulate USAgent, with Walker himself denying the idea that his brother would be part of such an organisation. Walker is informed of Halloway&#x27;s role in running the organization and in the ensuing final battle, Domino and Bloodstain are killed while a large angel-shaped gravestone falls on the invalid Halloway. Though the &quot;USAgent&quot; mini-series implies the statue killed him, &quot;Captain America&quot; #440 reveals that Halloway survived and managed to avoid arrest due to his army of lawyers and had gone back into seclusion.

Later entries for the Scourge in various &quot;Official Marvel Handbook&quot; specials, would clarify the Red Skull connection, which the &quot;USAgent&quot; mini-series never outright addressed. These entries ultimately state that the Red Skull learned of the existence of the Scourge of the Underworld organization and managed to convince several of Halloway&#x27;s agents to switch sides and work for him.

===Appearance===
The Scourge mainly appeared in disguise, though for the final battle with Captain America in &quot;Captain America&quot; #320, he dressed in an all-black commando costume, which his hologram self later is seen wearing in &quot;Captain America&quot; #326. For his entry in the &quot;Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Deluxe Edition&quot;, a new costume was designed for the character: white skull mask, opera hat, and a white buttoned-up trenchcoat and white gloves. This costume was used sporadically in later stories.

==&quot;The Deadly Foes of Spider-Man&quot;==
The Scourge plays a major role in several storylines involving the Shocker in the early 1990s. The mini-series &quot;The Deadly Foes of Spider-Man&quot;, Shocker showed that the Spider-Man villain had become obsessively paranoid and convinced the Scourge was out to get him. During the climax of the storyline, the Kingpin employs an unseen Scourge imposter to fake an attempt on the Shocker&#x27;s life, which prevents him from killing Spider-Man and causes him to flee the scene, all in order to avoid attention being drawn near a location that the Kingpin wants to rob.

In &quot;Amazing Spider-Man&quot; #364, Shocker attempts to rob several research centers in order to gain technology to enhance his suit&#x27;s weapons, so as to increase his chances in battle against the Scourge.

==Later versions==
In the pages of &quot;Thunderbolts&quot;, a new version appears; this iteration assassinates the Thunderbolts members Jolt, Helmut Zemo and Techno, as well as a pair of civilians (Gayle Rogers and Roberta Haggerty) who investigate Jolt&#x27;s death. This Scourge is actually Jack Monroe who is being mentally controlled by the superhuman-hating government agent Henry Peter Gyrich who himself was being manipulated by Baron Strucker. Monroe is defeated and freed from Gyrich&#x27;s control by the Thunderbolts and their allies, the Redeemers. He then, apparently, abandons the Scourge equipment and identity after the battle. As Scourge, Monroe had access to a wide array of technology based on equipment confiscated from super-villains. Some are installed in the costume, while several others are miniaturized using Pym particles and stored in one of the costume&#x27;s gauntlets; all are accessible by a voice-coded system. Specific items used include versions of the Green Goblin&#x27;s glider, the Unicorn&#x27;s helmet-installed energy projector, and Stilt-Man&#x27;s telescoping stilts, as well as various unspecified weaponry, including a metal quarterstaff. He could also access his gauntlet&#x27;s Pym particles to alter the size of himself or others, though excessive use of this ability on Atlas forced him to abandon much of his weapon stores when his Pym particles supply was spent.

Five characters bearing the names of the Scourge&#x27;s previous victims – Hellrazor, Caprice, Mindwave (minus the hyphen), Mirage and Bluestreak appear in the &quot;Caged Angels&quot; storyline in &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; #116-121. All five villains are telepaths, who allow themselves to be captured so they can be taken into custody at the Thunderbolts&#x27;s headquarters. Once there, they use their combined powers to drive several members of the Thunderbolts into homicidal rages in order to force the team to destroy each other. They are only stopped in doing so, by Bullseye who had been recovering from injuries and not factored into their plan and murders them in their cells before they could use their powers on him.

The Punisher impersonates the Scourge again in an attempt to take down the Kingpin.

During the &quot;Dark Reign&quot; storyline, Norman Osborn asks the Hood to hunt the Punisher in retaliation for a failed assassination attempt. The Hood is granted the Dark Dimension&#x27;s powers by his master Dormammu to revive eighteen murdered criminals (Basilisk, Bird-Man, Black Abbott, Blue Streak, Cheetah, Cyclone, Death Adder, Firebrand, Hijacker, Human Fly, Letha, Megatak, Mind-Wave, Miracle Man, Mirage, Titania, Turner D. Century and Wraith) to help take down the Punisher. Scourge tells the villains that if they fail, they will be returned to their previous states of death and rot. The Hood tells these criminals that the Scourge of the Underworld is actually Frank Castle and by killing him they would be avenging their previous deaths and prolonging their new lives. When Microchip asks if he thinks any of them believed the story, the Hood replies &quot;Sure they did&quot;. Several of these villains (including Firebrand, Wraith. Cheetah, Cyclone, and Mirage) are killed again while confronting the Punisher, but ultimately Basilisk and Death Adder subdue the vigilante, and the terms of the Hood&#x27;s agreement are apparently fulfilled.

The original version of Scourge of the Underworld is among the various people in Erebus when Hercules travels to the Underworld. He is later seen in Pluto&#x27;s jury (alongside Abomination, Armless Tiger Man, Artume, Heinrich Zemo, Commander Kraken, Iron Monger, Jack O&#x27;Lantern, Kyknos, Nessus, Orka and Veranke) at Zeus&#x27;s trial.

Another person christened with identity is assigned to the Thunderbolts by Osborn. His first mission is to eliminate Songbird. This character is later revealed to be Frank Simpson with a new identity.

Another iteration joins up with Villains for Hire, the villain counterpart of Heroes for Hire. This character was in fact Paladin in disguise as part of a massive con to take down the Purple Man.

Another new version is shown to be using a list of the locations of supervillains who have been relocated via the witness protection program and killing them, most recently Viper, member of the Serpent Squad. In the battle, he severely injures the hero (and former villain) Diamondback who recognizes his voice. He is then shown to be working for Henry Gyrich, revealed to be under the influence of Hydra. Encountering the villain the Rattler, whom Scourge subdues and kills after a short but brutal fight, he pulls off his damaged mask, shattered from the fight, and reveals he is Dennis Dunphy.

<text>Frederick John (Fred) Dixon (January 20, 1881 – March 18, 1931) was a Manitoba politician, and was for several years the dominant figure in the province&#x27;s mainstream labour and Henry George Single Tax Georgist movements. A proponent of proportional representation, he also served as an MLA in the Manitoba Legislature from 1914 to 1923.

==Biography==
Born in 1881 at Englefield in the English county of Berkshire, Dixon was influenced by the reformist labour politics of his home country, and also favoured the single tax ideas of Henry George.

He apprenticed as a gardener in England.

Dixon arrived in Manitoba in 1903, settling in Winnipeg. He apprenticed as a draftsman and worked as an engraver.

He became a member of the Independent Labour Party. However, he opposed the efforts of some party members to declare the party as socialist and endorse widespread nationalization. The controversy led to the disintegration of the ILP in 1908. Dixon also wrote a weekly column in the Winnipeg labour weekly, &quot;The Voice&quot;.

Dixon and his friend, Seymour Farmer, who was later mayor of Winnipeg, became involved with the League for Taxation of Land Values (the Single Tax programme) and the League for Direct Legislation, under which people would have the right of referendum, initiative and recall.

Dixon first ran for the provincial legislature in the 1910 provincial election as a candidate of the Manitoba Labour Party in Winnipeg Centre. He was also supported by the provincial Liberal Party, whose platform he generally supported. Dixon&#x27;s centrist labourism brought about opposition from the Socialist Party of Canada, which ran a spoiler candidate against him. Dixon lost to Conservative Thomas Taylor by 73 votes; the SPC polled 99.

After the defeat, he again devoted himself to the cause of Direct Legislation. A respected speaker for the Direct Legislation League, he moved to Moose Jaw and worked for the Saskatchewan Direct Legislation League.

In 1914, he married Winona Margaret Flett, a suffragist.

The SPC&#x27;s actions provoked a backlash among Winnipeg trade unionists. That and his high profile among farmers due to his Direct Legislation League work increased his popularity. He ran as an independent in the provincial election of 1914, in one of the two separate elections held in Winnipeg Centre. He received support from both the Liberals and the Labour Representation Committee (a successor to the MLP). His platform included home rule for Winnipeg, women&#x27;s suffrage, public ownership of utilities, removal of subsidies for private enterprise (including lowering the tariff walls to imported manufactured goods) and a referendum on temperance. Despite SPC and Conservative opposition, he took a majority of the votes and was elected for Winnipeg Centre &quot;B&quot;.

In the Legislative Assembly, Dixon helped force an investigation into corruption associated with the construction of new Manitoba legislative buildings. This led to the downfall of the Robson government in 1915.

He was re-elected in the 1915 election, as an Independent Progressive.

During World War I, Dixon emerged as one of the leading anti-conscriptionists in Winnipeg, and he defended the rights of conscientious objectors to the war effort. These efforts placed him in conflict with the Manitoba Liberals, who generally supported the conscription policies of Robert Borden&#x27;s Unionist government.

In March 1918, Dixon helped to found the first branch of the Dominion Labour Party in Winnipeg and served as its first president. It was never a strong or centralized party but did pioneer the way to more developed leftist parties such as the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. The DLP subsequently branched out to other cities in the Canadian prairies.

Dixon supported the strikers during the Winnipeg General Strike of 1919. He undoubtedly played an important role in legitimizing their efforts among the city&#x27;s reformist labourites. After the editors of the &quot;Strike Bulletin&quot; were arrested, he published the &quot;Western Star and Enlightener&quot;. Dixon was subsequently arrested and charged with seditious libel for his statements in those publications. He ably defended himself at the trial, which became a &quot;cause célèbre,&quot; and was acquitted.

In the provincial election of 1920, Dixon headed a united labour list in the city of Winnipeg, which had been re-designed as a single constituency with ten members elected by single transferable voting. He easily topped the poll with 11,586 votes, almost 7,000 more than his nearest Liberal competitor. There can be little doubt that Dixon was the most popular politician in the city at the time. His vote total was more than the quota required to win a seat and he was the first to be declared elected, his surplus votes then being transferred to other candidates.

In Winnipeg, Dixon and another DLP candidate, Rev. William Ivens, were elected alongside four Liberals, two Conservatives, a Social Democratic Party candidate and a Socialist Party of Canada candidate.

Nine DLP MLAs, along with one member apiece from the SPC and SDPC, were elected to the Manitoba legislature in 1920. Dixon was the unquestioned leader of the labour parliamentary caucus. He cooperated with more left-wing figures, and kept the group reasonably united through to the election of 1922, although having to establish a new party to do so.

In late 1920, the DLP in Winnipeg was taken over by rightist labourites who had opposed the General Strike. Dixon led a walkout of DLP members, and was involved in founding the province&#x27;s new Independent Labour Party. The ILP became the primary voice of the parliamentary left in Manitoba, and later become part of the Cooperative Commonwealth Federation.

Dixon again topped the Winnipeg list in 1922, albeit by the reduced margin of almost 4,000 votes over the nearest Liberal. The total labour caucus was reduced to six members, although Ivens and Dixon were both re-elected.

In 1923, Dixon resigned as a Member of the Legislative Assembly following the death of his wife and two of his children; he was also diagnosed with cancer. John Queen, formerly of the SDPC, became ILP leader in his place.

As his health problems grew more serious, Dixon spent the next few years working as a part-time insurance salesman.

In 1927, he was appointed to a provincial commission investigating the causes of unemployment, in which capacity he co-authored the report, &quot;Seasonal Unemployment in Manitoba.&quot;

Fred Dixon died of cancer on March 18, 1931. His close friend J.S. Woodsworth gave the eulogy at his funeral.

<text>The Bishop Rock () is a skerry off the British coast in the northern Atlantic Ocean known for its lighthouse. It is in the westernmost part of the Isles of Scilly, an archipelago off the southwestern tip of the Cornish peninsula of Great Britain. The &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; lists it as the world&#x27;s smallest island with a building on it.

The original iron lighthouse was begun in 1847 but was washed away before it could be completed. The present building was completed in 1858 and was first lit on 1September that year. Before the installation of the helipad, visitors to the lighthouse would rappel from the top (with winches installed at the lamp level and at the base below) to boats waiting away from the lighthouse.

Bishop Rock is also at the eastern end of the North Atlantic shipping route used by ocean liners in the first half of the 20th century; the western end being the entrance to Lower New York Bay. This was the route that ocean liners took when competing for the transatlantic speed record, known as the Blue Riband.

==History==
In the late 13th century, when the Isles of Scilly were under the jurisdiction of John de Allet and his wife Isabella, anyone convicted of felony &quot;ought to be taken to a certain rock in the sea, with two barley loaves and a pitcher of water and left until the sea swallowed him up&quot;. The rock was originally recorded as &quot;Maen Escop&quot; in 1284 and &quot;Maenenescop&quot; in 1302. In Cornish, &quot;Men Eskop&quot; means &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Stone&quot;, whilst &quot;Men an Eskop&quot; means &quot;the Stone of the Bishop&quot;. The outer rocks to the west of St Agnes also used to be known as the Bishop and Clerk, but exactly how they acquired these similar names is not known for certain. A possible explanation is that the shape of the rock is similar to a bishop&#x27;s mitre.

East of Bishop Rock are the Western Rocks and the Gilstone Reef, where Admiral Shovell&#x27;s flagship HMS &quot;Association&quot; was wrecked in the great naval disaster of 1707. Shovell&#x27;s remains were repatriated to England by order of Queen Anne shortly after their initial burial in the Isles of Scilly. A commonly circulated story holds that a crew member on board the &quot;Association&quot; told Admiral Shovell that the fleet was close by Scilly, but Shovell ignored this and hanged the man for insubordination, There is, however, no evidence for this incident, which is most likely apocryphal. In fact, the fleet had been blown off course by stormy weather, having been carried further north than their dead reckoning suggested, whilst the position of Scilly on nautical charts of the time was far from accurate, the islands often being marked as much further north than they are.

The earliest recorded wreck on the rock itself was in 1839, when the brig &quot;Theodorick&quot; struck in rough misty weather on 4September. She was sailing from Mogodore to London carrying a general cargo. In the early hours of , the 600-tonne paddle steamer &quot;Brigand&quot;, a packet boat, which was en route from Liverpool to St Petersburg, struck the rock with such force that it stove in two large bow plates. The rocks then acted as a pivot, and she swung round and heeled into the rock port side, crushing the paddle wheel and box to such an extent that it penetrated the engine room. She drifted over seven miles in two hours, before sinking in . All the crew were saved. In 1901 a barque named &quot;Falkland&quot; struck the rock, her main yard hitting the lighthouse itself.

==Lighthouse==

An 1818 report by the Surveyor-General of the Duchy of Cornwall on the dangers to shipping in Cornwall proposed that a lighthouse be built, similar to the Eddystone Lighthouse, upon Bishop Rock, given its location as the westernmost rock of the Isles of Scilly. The plan was considered by the government and building was expected soon, as the engineer John Rennie the Elder made an offer to build it. The government did not take up the offer; but Trinity House surveyed Bishop Rock in 1843 with a view to building a lighthouse, and under their Engineer-in-Chief, James Walker, construction work began in 1847.

===Walker&#x27;s first tower===

Walker had decided on a design consisting of accommodation and a light on top of iron legs. The light was never lit, since on (before the lantern and lighting equipment had been fitted) a storm washed the tower away. (A few years later, the lantern that had been intended for this tower was installed instead on another Walker-designed tower, Godrevy Lighthouse in St Ives Bay in Cornwall.)

===Walker&#x27;s second tower===
In the second attempt, James Walker began building a stone structure in 1851. The site presented a number of difficulties: the paucity of available land area and the slope of the rock meant that the lowest stone had to be laid below the low water level of the lowest spring tides. The resident engineer was Nicholas Douglass assisted by his sons (first James and then William). Despite multiple problems over the seven-year period of construction, the tower was completed without loss of life. It was fitted with a 4-wick oil lamp by Wilkins &amp; Son and a large (first order) fixed catadioptric optic by Henry Lépaute, and shone its light for the first time on . The total cost of the lighthouse was £34,559.

====Keepers&#x27; dwellings====

As the lighthouse was nearing completion, a set of dwellings were constructed on St Mary&#x27;s to accommodate keepers&#x27; families (and the keepers themselves when they were not on station). The light at the time was manned by a team of four: at any one time, three would be on station in the lighthouse, and the fourth on leave on St Mary&#x27;s.

====Exposed to the elements====
Faced with the full force of the Atlantic, Walker&#x27;s lighthouse proved vulnerable: in heavy weather the tower regularly shook, the vibrations being powerful enough to cause objects to fall from shelves, and even causing the optical apparatus to fracture. The lighthouse had initially been provided with a fog bell; however this was washed away during a storm in January1860. (It was replaced with a larger bell, but not until 1864; the bell was sounded once every ten seconds). Over the years that followed various expediencies were tried to mitigate the effects of heavy weather upon the lighthouse.

During an especially heavy storm in April 1874 the tower was severely and repeatedly shaken by a succession of waves, which shattered the reinforced glass of the lantern and sent cascades of water down through the living quarters. Later that year James Douglass (who had succeeded Walker as Engineer-in-chief at Trinity House) returned to Bishop Rock with a team of men to reinforce the lower section of the tower using broad iron bands, which were bolted through the stonework.

In the winter of 1881 a further series of storms battered the lighthouse, wrenching sizeable blocks of granite away from the structure just above the high water mark. James Douglass was again sent to inspect the tower and he reported that its structural safety had been seriously affected. He began drawing up designs to reinforce the structure by laying massive granite blocks into the rock and dove-tailing them onto the lighthouse.

===Douglass&#x27;s &#x27;strengthening and improvement&#x27;===

Ultimately, Douglass&#x27;s plan of renovation for the lighthouse would amount to a near complete rebuilding: it involved fully encasing Walker&#x27;s tower within new external courses of granite, then removing the old lantern storey and existing internal floors before increasing the strengthened tower&#x27;s height by a further . At the same time, he sought to diminish the impact of waves upon the tower by making the base section cylindrical, rather than conical. The work began in 1883 under the supervision of Sir James&#x27;s eldest surviving son, William Tregarthen Douglass; use was made of construction equipment which had become available following completion of the new Eddystone lighthouse (which had also been designed by Douglass) the previous year. The stones were cut and dressed off site, to precise dimensions, before being conveyed to the rock by steamer and then individually winched ashore. It took until 1886 for the time-consuming work of integrating the new stonework with the old to be completed, up to the height of the existing structure. Thereafter things moved more swiftly and the tower as a whole was finished in 1887.

====New optical and other equipment====

Douglass topped his rebuilt tower with a double-height lantern storey, designed to contain a &#x27;biform&#x27; optical system designed and built by Chance Brothers (consisting of two identical lamps and lens arrays, one mounted above the other). Each tier consisted of an eight-wick paraffin burner set within a revolving array of extra large hyperradiant Fresnel lenses (consisting, on each level, of five pairs of lens panels, displaying two white flashes every minute). In clear weather the lower tier alone was used, with its lamp on half power; in limited visibility (as judged by the clarity of the light visible from St Agnes&#x27;s Lighthouse, away) both tiers were used with the lamps at full power. The new improved light had a range of ; it was first lit on 25 October 1887. (The old dioptric apparatus was removed and later re-used: at Hurst Point and in the low light at Nash Point.)

The heavy new optic was turned by a small air engine placed in the pedestal; compressed air was provided from a set of tanks, located in the room below along with a pair of Davey &#x27;Safety&#x27; Engines, which drove the compressors. The compressed air could also be used, by day, to drive a small gallery-mounted winch for landing stores.

As part of the new installation, the lighthouse was equipped with an explosive fog signal: in foggy weather the keepers regularly had to attach a guncotton charge together with a detonator to a jib-type apparatus on the lantern gallery; from inside the lantern they would then raise the jib and fire the charge electrically. The explosive signal remained in use until 1976.

====Later developments====

In 1902 a new clockwork mechanism was installed to turn the lenses; by this time the optic had been modified to float in an annular mercury bath, which enabled it to turn much more freely. Two years later incandescent oil burners replaced the old multi-wick burners; they were upgraded with the installation of &#x27;Hood&#x27; incandescent burners in 1922. These remained in service until 1945, when they were replaced with electric lamps (powered by Stuart Turner diesel engined generating sets). A separate small Petter-engined generator provided electricity for the keepers&#x27; domestic use from 1955; it replaced a petrol-driven machine which had been installed during the war to power a radiotelephone (enabling direct verbal communication with ships, the shore and other nearby lighthouses). The electric installation was upgraded (with the provision of Lister diesel generator sets) in 1973.

Difficulty reaching the lighthouse by boat led Trinity House to build a helipad on top of the lighthouse in 1976. That same year a supertyfon fog horn was installed with sounders arranged around the gallery.

On 15 December 1992 the tower became fully automated; the lower half of the biform optic remained in use following automation whilst the top half was removed and put on display (it is currently in the National Maritime Museum Cornwall). An electric fog signal replaced the supertyfon at this time, sounding a long followed by a short tone every 90seconds; its use was discontinued in 2007.

On the 144th anniversary of the destruction of James Walker&#x27;s original iron tower (), a storm caused severe damage to the gunmetal entry doors, which had to be replaced; they too became an exhibit at the National Maritime Museum in Falmouth.

===Structure===

Bishop Lighthouse is often referred to as &quot;King of the lighthouses&quot;. With a height of the lighthouse is the tallest in England, together with Eddystone Lighthouse.

Expenditure on the lighthouses at Bishop Rock include:
The first iron lighthouse: £12,500 
The second granite lighthouse: £34,559 (equivalent to £ in ) 
The third improved lighthouse: £64,889 (equivalent to £ in ) 
Total cost: £111,948 

The interior of the light house consists of the following (as described in 1911): Below and inside the lighthouse are 10floors with spiral staircase to the 2nd floor with a door (made from gun metal (likely bronze) and installed in 1887) that leads down an external metal (likely bronze) ladder to climb down to the large exterior base. From the base another metal ladder provides access to a stone staircase to the waterline.

Prior to automation, the floors of the lighthouse were occupied as follows in 1911 &quot;(with later changes of use noted in italics)&quot;:
* 1st floor – Water tank (providing fresh water for lighthouse keepers)
* 2nd floor – Entrance room with metal door leading to exterior ladder to base below
* 3rd floor – Store room, with window &quot;(later contained fuel tanks for the generators)&quot;
* 4th floor – First oil room, with oil tanks formerly used to light the lamp &quot;(later the engine room)&quot;
* 5th floor – Second oil room, with window &quot;(later the &#x27;amenity room&#x27;)&quot;
* 6th floor – Living room for lighthouse keepers, with window &quot;(later the kitchen)&quot;
* 7th floor – Bedroom for lighthouse keepers, with window 
* 8th floor – Store room &quot;(later the living room)&quot;
* 9th floor – Service room
* 10th floor – Lantern

==Culture and media==
In December 1946 the BBC sent two radio reporters, Edward Ward and Stanley Coombs, to Bishop Rock as part of a programme of round-the-world Christmas messages, a format that had already been used before the Second World War. Gale-force winds and heavy seas prevented their return for almost a month, and food supplies for the five men in the lighthouse began to run out. A lifeboat finally reached the lighthouse on 16 January 1947 and the two reporters were lowered into the boat by rope while the sea was still rough.

The rock is the subject of a short orchestral descriptive work by the late Doreen Carwithen (Mary Alwyn), which was recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Richard Hickox.

The lighthouse was used as a filming location for one of the BBC One &#x27;Circle&#x27; idents, and was also featured in the last segment of the documentary series &quot;Three Men in More Than One Boat&quot;. The lighthouse was also featured in the 2010 BBC documentary &quot;Islands of Britain&quot;, presented by Martin Clunes.

The lighthouse featured in BBC TV children&#x27;s programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in 1975, when presenter Lesley Judd visited. &quot;Disaster nearly struck as she travelled by rope to the lighthouse from a boat. Her harness support dropped to her ankles, leaving Lesley with no support should she lose her grip on the rope.&quot;

The lighthouse also features in the short story &quot;Keeper of the Bishop&quot; by A. E. W. Mason.

<text>Atlas Fútbol Club is a Mexican professional football club based in Guadalajara, Jalisco, that currently plays in Liga MX, the top division of Mexican football. The club was founded in 1916, it plays home matches at Estadio Jalisco.

Atlas has won three league titles and four domestic cups. &quot;Los Roginegros&quot; had their golden era in the 1950s and 60s, but recently they became one of the few &quot;bicampeones&quot; (back-to-back champions) of Mexican football.

Atlas has a rivalry with city rivals Chivas called &quot;Clasico Tapatio&quot;.

==History==
Atlas was founded in a bar in Guadalajara, Mexico, where a few friends recalled their friends experience while studying at the Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire, England. In August 1916, Alfonso and Juan José &quot;Lico&quot; Cortina, Pedro &quot;Perico&quot; and Carlos Fernández del Valle, the three Orendain brothers and Federico Collignon (who had studied in Berlin) finally decided to set up a football team. They chose the name &quot;Atlas&quot; based on the Titan of Greek mythology of the same name, and chose red and black as the club&#x27;s colours to mimic those of Ampleforth College whose patron saint, St Lawrence, was also chosen as the patron saint of Atlas. The red signifies the blood of St Lawrence and the black signifies his martyrdom. Occasionally the crest of Ampleforth College is seen hanging from a banner in the stadium.

The first title for the club was the Copa MX in 1945–46, where they beat Atlante in the final. That same year, they won the supercup (league vs. cup champion) against Veracruz 3–2. Four years later, Atlas won their second Copa MX, in the 1949–50 season. The following year, in the 1950–51 Mexican Primera División season, Atlas won its first league title, with twelve wins in 22 matches. However, just two years later, Atlas was relegated for the first time after losing 4–0 against Tampico. But the following season, Atlas made an immediate return to the top flight.

Atlas had a golden age in the late 1990s under the management of Ricardo La Volpe, with promising players such as Rafael Márquez, Daniel Osorno, Juan Pablo Rodriguez, Pavel Pardo, Mario Méndez, Omar Briceño, and Miguel Zepeda, but even though they had a team with enormous talent and reached the Verano 1999 final, they couldn&#x27;t conquer the title and lost against Deportivo Toluca in a match defined by penalties after a 5–5 draw on aggregate and with extra time.

In 2000, Atlas participated in the Copa Libertadores for the first time. They began their campaign in a round-robin preliminary stage where they played against Club America, Deportivo Táchira, and Deportivo Italchacao. Their first match was a 2–0 loss to America, followed by draws against Tachira and Italchacao. However they would recover and finish top of the group after beating America 6–3 and then beating Tachira, followed by a draw against Italchacao. As a result, Atlas gained entry into the proper competition in group 4 alongside River Plate, U. de Chile and Atletico Nacional. The Guadalajara-based club&#x27;s first match was on 23 February, a 1–1 draw against River. Their next match was a 3–2 win against Atletico Nacional in Medellín. The club then drew against U. de Chile and lost to River, followed by a 5–1 rout of Colombian champions Nacional, but a loss in their final match against U. de Chile in Santiago. Although Atlas finished level with U. de Chile on points, a better goal difference would see them go through. In the round of 16, the Mexican club defeated Colombian club Atlético Junior 5–1 on aggregate and were through to the quarter-finals, where their run would end after losing twice to eventual runner-up Palmeiras and being eliminated 5–2 on aggregate.

In 2008, Atlas made their second appearance in the Copa Libertadores. Their campaign started with a qualifying tournament called InterLiga where they faced Toluca, Morelia, and America. At the end of the InterLiga they were tied on points and goal difference with Toluca, so a coin toss decided who would advance to the next round. Atlas won the coin toss and advanced to the first stage, where they defeated Bolivian club La Paz 2–1 on aggregate. In the group stage with Boca Juniors, Colo-Colo, and Maracaibo, Atlas finished first with eleven points, including notable victories against Boca Juniors and Colo-Colo. In the round of 16 they would eliminate Lanus 3–2 on aggregate. In the quarter-finals, they were matched up with Boca Juniors again. In the first leg, played in Buenos Aires, Atlas secured a 2–2 draw, but in the second leg in Guadalajara, Boca won 3–0 and eliminated the club.

Atlas qualified for the 2015 Copa Libertadores after finishing second on the table in the 2014 Apertura. The team was led by Tomás Boy and was matched up in the group stage with Independiente Santa Fe, Atletico Mineiro, and Colo-Colo. In their first match they lost 1–0 to Santa Fe, but in the second match they had a historic 1–0 victory against Atletico Mineiro in Brazil, which ended a 37-year undefeated home streak for the club in the Copa Libertadores. Atlas later beat Atletico again at home, but exited the competition with a last-placed finish in the group and a loss to Santa Fe in Bogotá.

On 12 December 2021, Atlas ended a 70-year title drought when they defeated Club León at the Estadio Jalisco via penalties 4–3 and won their second league title.
On 5 March 2022, during a match between Atlas and Querétaro at Querétaro&#x27;s stadium, a riot broke out between fans attending the match. Videos posted on social media showed groups of men beating, kicking, dragging and stripping victims. According to the Querétaro state civil protection agency, at least 22 men were injured. The Liga MX sanctioned Queretaro by banning Queretaro-affiliated &quot;barras&quot; from attending home matches for up to six months in response to the riots. Atlas were awarded a 0-3 win for the game which was abandoned at 0-1.

Atlas won its third league championship on 29 May 2022 against Pachuca. In the first leg on 26 May, Atlas defeated Pachuca at Estadio Jalisco 2–0, and although they lost the second leg 2–1, they won 3–2 on aggregate to become only the third team in league history to win back to back titles.

==Youth Academy==
Atlas are renowned for having a successful youth academy setup. In the last few decades, Atlas have developed many players who have gone on to have professional careers domestically and internationally. Many young players enter the Atlas youth academy knowing that they&#x27;ll have a strong possibility to play with the first team due to the club philosophy of allowing youth players the opportunity to be promoted to the first team. Although Atlas has only won the league championship three times, their academy has been famous for developing players for the Mexico national football team in the past few decades like Jared Borgetti, Daniel Osorno, José de Jesús Corona, Pável Pardo, Oswaldo Sánchez, Rafael Márquez, Juan Carlos Medina, Jorge Hernández, Mario Méndez, Miguel Zepeda, Juan Pablo Rodriguez, Juan Pablo Garcia, Joel Herrera, Jorge Torres Nilo, Edgar Ivan Pacheco, Andrés Guardado, Jeremy Márquez, Diego Barbosa and many more. The club&#x27;s lower youth divisions have achieved many titles domestically as well as internationally.

==Estadio Jalisco==
Atlas currently plays in the Estadio Jalisco, which is the third largest stadium in Mexico and was constructed on 31 January 1960. It is a venue that has played host to historic matches and teams including Pelé&#x27;s Brazil in 1970. In total, It was host for 8 games in the 1970 FIFA World Cup, 6 of which were from group stage matches, and two were quarter and semi-finals. Subsequently, the stadium was again host for 9 games in the 1986 FIFA World Cup, 6 of which were group stage matches, 1 was round of sixteen and the last 2 were quarter and semi-finals.

==Supporters and rivalry==
Atlas fans are as a whole collectively known as (The Faithful), while is the main organized supporter group. La Barra 51&#x27;s name recalls Atlas&#x27; first championship in the Primera División de México in 1951. Through the team&#x27;s struggling performance has earned its name, supporting the team for 70 years without any major accomplishments.

Atlas also has notable supporters such as Guadalajara natives Canelo Álvarez, Peso Pluma, and Alejandro Fernández.

===Clásico Tapatío===
Atlas&#x27; fierce rivals are Guadalajara city-rivals C.D. Guadalajara, known as &quot;Chivas&quot;. The derby is known as the Clásico Tapatío and is said to be the oldest football derby in Mexico, dating back to 1916. The first match between the two sides was a friendly that took place shortly after Atlas were founded, the game ended 0–0. The first competitive match between the two sides came in the 1917 &quot;Torneo de Primavera&quot;, which translates into English as the &quot;Tournament of Spring&quot;. Atlas were victorious this time round, winning 2–1. The game sparked controversy, however, when complaints of a bad refereeing performance were put forward by Chivas. Chivas were so angered by the result, that they refused to play in the next &quot;Liga Amateur de Jalisco&quot; tournament of 1917–18, unless the president of refereeing, Justo García Godoy, resigned from his position; when Godoy failed to do so, Chivas refused to join the tournament.

Chivas are the most victorious in Guadalajara derbies, however, winning 16 of 35 competitive fixtures the two sides have played. Atlas have only won 9 and the sides have drawn 8 times.

<text>In road bicycle racing (e.g. Grand Tour stage races), the green jersey is a distinctive racing jersey worn by the most consistent highest finisher in the competition.

While the overall race leader in the Tour de France will wear the yellow jersey, or &quot;maillot jaune&quot;, the green jersey (&quot;maillot vert&quot;) will be worn by the leader in the points competition. Since 2009, the Vuelta a España has also used the green jersey to signify the leader of the points competition. In the Giro d&#x27;Italia, the green jersey was, from 1974 to 2011, worn by the King of the Mountains, the leader in the competition for climbing specialists.

== Classification guide ==
The following events use the &quot;green jersey&quot; to signify the current leader and/or final winner of the overall classification by points (often known as the sprinters&#x27; competition):

* Tour de France (known as the &quot;maillot vert&quot;) (see also Points classification in the Tour de France)
* Vuelta a España
* Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré
* Tour de l&#x27;Avenir
* Tour de Georgia
* Tour de Romandie
* Tour of Ireland
* Tour of California (known as the &quot;sprints classification&quot;)

== Mountains competition leader ==
The following events have used the &quot;green jersey&quot; to signify the current leader and/or final winner of the overall classification of the best climber (often known as the King of the Mountains competition):

* Giro d&#x27;Italia (&quot;Italian&quot;: known as the &quot;maglia verde&quot;: 1974 to 2011) (see also Mountains classification in the Giro d&#x27;Italia)
* Tour de Pologne (&quot;Polish&quot;: known as the &quot;najlepszy góral&quot; or &quot;Klasyfikacja Górska&quot;)
* Vuelta a España (prior to 2008)

As of 2009, no major race uses the &quot;green jersey&quot; to signify the current leader and/or final winner of the overall classification of sprinter where the polka dot jersey represents the king of the mountain.

<text>Stephen Sherlock Ross, Baron Ross of Newport (6 July 1926 – 10 May 1993) often known as Steve Ross was a Liberal politician in the United Kingdom.

Ross came from a Scottish background, his family being in shipping in Liverpool. His mother died when he was a baby and he was brought up by his father, who held the MC, in London.

Educated at Bedford School, he went into the Royal Navy aged 18 in 1944 and served four years on the lower decks, which he claimed was the best thing that ever happened to him. In 1948 he joined his uncle&#x27;s firm in Kidderminster, which was an auction and cattle market. He qualified as a chartered surveyor and land agent. He went to the Isle of Wight in 1953 to secure a better job, and in 1958 tried to join the Liberal Party but &#x27;no one wanted to know&#x27;. He finally joined in 1961 and in the 1964 election worked for an elderly lady candidate &#x27;who was slightly muddled about who was Prime Minister&#x27;. He decided things could not go on like that and fought the 1966 election himself with his wife, Brenda, and a few friends, covering the island by Land Rover. He did the same in 1970, by which time he had become a county councillor. Ross was Leader of Isle of Wight County Council 1973-74 and 1981-83.

He was elected as Member of Parliament for the Isle of Wight at the February 1974 general election; this was the one surprising Liberal win at this election, outside areas where the Liberals had been traditionally strong. He was re-elected in October 1974, 1979 and 1983 until his retirement from the House of Commons in 1987. In the Commons he was successively party spokesman on housing and local government, the environment, transport and Northern Ireland, but his main legislative imprint remains to this day in the Housing (Homeless Persons) Act of 1977 which he promoted successfully as a Private Member&#x27;s Bill.

Shortly after he chose to not stand for a fourth term, he was elevated to the House of Lords, being created a life peer on 4 November 1987 taking the title Baron Ross of Newport, &quot;of Newport in the County of the Isle of Wight&quot;, where he spoke on local government

As an MP in his constituency he enjoyed a popular following, and reports that he received support from others who would normally have voted for candidates from other parties were often cited. On his departure from the Commons, the Conservative candidate Barry Field was elected and held onto the seat for two terms until 1997 when the seat was temporarily regained for one term by the successors to the Liberals, the Liberal Democrats.

<doc id="859784" wikidata="Q3748888" url="?curid=859784" title="Labour power">
<text>Labour power (; ) is the capacity to work, a key concept used by Karl Marx in his critique of capitalist political economy. Marx distinguished between the capacity to do the work, i.e. labour power, and the physical act of working, i.e. labour. Human labour power exists in any kind of society, but on what terms it is traded or combined with means of production to produce goods and services has historically varied greatly. 

The general idea of labour-power had existed previously in classical political economy. Adam Smith&#x27;s &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot; and David Ricardo&#x27;s &quot;On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation&quot; already referred to the &quot;productive powers of labour&quot;. However, Marx made the concept much more precise, critically examining the functions of labour-power in production, how labour-power is used, organized and exploited, and how it is typically valued and priced in bourgeois society.

Under capitalism, according to Marx, the &quot;productive powers of labour&quot; appear as the &quot;creative power of capital&quot;. Indeed, &quot;labour power at work&quot; becomes a component of capital, it functions as working capital. Work becomes just work, workers become an abstract labour force, labour becomes an economic input or a factor of production, and the control over work becomes mainly a management prerogative.

==Definition==
Karl Marx introduces the concept in chapter 6 of the first volume of &quot;Capital&quot;, as follows: 
:&quot;By labour-power or capacity for labour is to be understood the aggregate of those mental and physical capabilities existing in a human being, which he exercises whenever he produces a use-value of any description.&quot;
He adds further on that:
:&quot;Labour-power, however, becomes a reality only by its exercise; it sets itself in action only by working. But thereby a definite quantity of human muscle, nerve. brain, &amp;c., is wasted, and these require to be restored.&quot;

Another explanation of labour-power can be found in the introduction and second chapter of Marx&#x27;s &quot;Wage Labour and Capital&quot; (1847). Marx also provided a short exposition of labour power in &quot;Value, Price and Profit&quot; (1865).

==Labour power and labour==
For Marx, &quot;Arbeitskraft&quot;, which he sometimes instead refers to as &quot;Arbeitsvermögen&quot; (&quot;labour-ability&quot; or &quot;labour-capacity&quot;) refers to a &quot;force of nature&quot;: the physical &quot;ability&quot; of human beings and other living things to perform work, including mental labour and skills such as manual dexterity, in addition to sheer physical exertion. Labour power is, in this sense, also the aspect of labour that becomes a commodity within capitalist society and is alienated from labourers when it is sold to capitalists.

By contrast, &quot;labour&quot; may refer to all or any activity by humans (and other living creatures) that is concerned with producing goods or services (or what Marx calls use-values). In this sense, the usage of labour (&quot;per se&quot;) in Marxian economics is somewhat similar to the later concept, in neoclassical economics, of &quot;labour services&quot;.

The distinction between labour and labour-power, according to Marx, helped to solve a problem that David Ricardo had failed to solve, i.e. explaining why the surplus value resulting from profit normally arises out of the process of production itself—rather than in the investment of capital (e.g. the advance of money-capital in the form of wages) in labour-power (acquired from labourers).

Acccording to Marx,

Marx&#x27;s concept of labour power is sometimes compared to that of human capital. However, Marx himself would most likely have considered a concept such as &quot;human capital&quot; to be a reification, the purpose of which was to suggest that workers were really capitalist investors. In &quot;Capital, Vol. 2&quot;, Marx writes sarcastically: 

==Labour power as commodity==

Under capitalism, according to Marx, labour-power becomes a commodity – it is sold and bought on the market. A worker tries to sell his or her labour-power to an employer, in exchange for a wage or salary. If successful (the only alternative being unemployment), this exchange involves submitting to the authority of the capitalist for a specific period of time.

During that time, the worker does actual labour, producing goods and services. The capitalist can then sell these and obtain surplus value; since the wages paid to the workers are lower than the value of the goods or services they produce for the capitalist.

Labour power can also be sold by the worker on &quot;own account&quot;, in which case he is self-employed, or it can be sold by an intermediary, such as a hiring agency. In principle a &quot;group&quot; of workers can also sell their labour-power as an independent contracting party. Some labour contracts are very complex, involving a number of different intermediaries.

Normally, the worker is legally the owner of his labour power, and can sell it freely according to his own wishes. However, most often the trade in labour power is regulated by legislation, and the sale may not be truly &quot;free&quot;—it may be a forced sale for one reason or another, and indeed it may be bought and sold against the real wishes of the worker even although he owns his own labour power. Various gradations of freedom and unfreedom are possible, and free wage labour can combine with slave labour or semi-slavery.

The concept of labour power as a commodity was first explicitly stated by Friedrich Engels in &quot;The Principles of Communism&quot; (1847): 

Marx considered the sale and purchase of labour-power &quot;the absolute foundation of capitalist production&quot;; the reason was that &quot;[m]aterial wealth transforms itself into capital simply and solely because the worker sells his labour-power in order to live.&quot;

==The value of labor power==
Labour power is a peculiar commodity, because it is an attribute of living persons, who own it themselves in their living bodies. Because they &quot;own&quot; it within themselves, they cannot &quot;permanently&quot; sell it to someone else; in that case, they would be a slave, and a slave does not own himself. Yet, although workers can hire themselves out, they cannot &quot;hire out&quot; or &quot;lease&quot; their labour, since they cannot reclaim or repossess the labour at some point after the work is done, in the same way as rental equipment is returned to the owner. Once labour has been expended, it is gone, and the only remaining issue is who benefits from the results, and by how much.

Labour power can become a marketable object, sold for a specific period, only if the owners are constituted in law as legal subjects who are free to sell it, and can enter into labour contracts. Once actualised and consumed through working, the capacity to work is exhausted, and must be replenished and restored.

In general, Marx argues that in capitalism the value of labour power (as distinct from fluctuating market prices for work effort) is equal to its &quot;normal or average (re-)production cost&quot;, i.e. the cost of meeting the established human needs which must be satisfied in order for the worker to turn up for work each day, fit to work. This involves goods and services representing a quantity of labour equal to necessary labour or the necessary product. It represents an average cost of living, an average living standard.

The general concept of the &quot;value of labour power&quot; is necessary because both the conditions of the sale of labour power, and the conditions under which goods and services are purchased by the worker with money from a salary, can be affected by numerous circumstances. If, for example, the state imposes a tax on consumer goods and services (an indirect tax or consumption tax such as value-added tax or goods and services tax), then what the worker can buy with his wage-money is reduced. Or, if price inflation increases, then again the worker can buy less with his wage money. The point is that this can occur quite &quot;independently&quot; of how much a worker is actually paid. Therefore, the &quot;standard of living&quot; of a worker can rise or fall quite independently of how much he is paid—simply because goods and services become more expensive or cheaper to buy, or because he is blocked from access to goods and services.

Included in the value of labour power is both a &quot;physical&quot; component (the minimum physical requirements for a healthy worker) and a &quot;moral-historical&quot; component (the satisfaction of needs beyond the physical minimum which have become an established part of the lifestyle of the average worker). The value of labour power is thus a &quot;historical norm&quot;, which is the outcome of a combination of factors: productivity; the supply and demand for labour; the assertion of human needs; the costs of acquiring skills; state laws stipulating minimum or maximum wages, the balance of power between social classes, etc.

Buying labour power usually becomes a &quot;commercially&quot; interesting proposition only if it can yield more value than it costs to buy, i.e. employing it yields a net positive return on capital invested. However, in Marx&#x27;s theory, the value-creating function of labour power is not its &quot;only&quot; function; it also importantly &quot;conserves&quot; and &quot;transfers&quot; capital value. If labour is withdrawn from the workplace for any reason, typically the value of capital assets deteriorates; it takes a continual stream of work effort to maintain and preserve their value. When materials are used to make new products, part of the value of materials is also transferred to the new products.

Consequently, labour power may be hired not &quot;because it creates more value than it costs to buy&quot;, but simply because it &quot;conserves the value of a capital asset&quot; which, if this labour did not occur, would decline in value by an even greater amount than the labour cost involved in maintaining its value; or because it is a necessary expense which &quot;transfers the value of a capital asset&quot; from one owner to another. Marx regards such labour as &quot;unproductive&quot; in the sense that it creates no new net addition to total capital value, but it may be essential and indispensable labour, because without it a capital value would reduce or disappear. The larger the stock of assets which is neither an input nor an output to real production, and the wealthier society&#x27;s elite becomes, the more labour is devoted only to &quot;maintaining&quot; the mass of capital assets rather than increasing its value.

==Wages and labour costs==
Marx regards money-wages and salaries as the &quot;price&quot; of labour power (though workers can also be paid &quot;in kind&quot;), normally related to hours worked or output produced. That price may contingently be higher or lower than the value of labour power, depending on market forces of supply and demand, on skill monopolies, legal rules, the ability of negotiate, etc. Normally, unless government action prevents it, high unemployment will lower wages, and full employment will raise wages, in accordance with the laws of supply and demand. But wages can also be reduced through high price inflation and consumer taxes. Therefore, a distinction must always be drawn between &quot;nominal gross wages&quot; and &quot;real wages&quot; adjusted for tax and price inflation, and indirect tax imposts must be considered.

The labour-costs of an employer are not the same as the real buying power a worker acquires through working. An employer usually also has to pay taxes &amp; levies to the government in respect of workers hired, which may include social security contributions or superannuation benefits. In addition there are often also administrative costs. So, in the United States for example, out of the &quot;total&quot; expenditure on labour by employers, the workers get about 60% as take-home pay, but about 40% consists of taxes, benefits and ancillary costs. Employers may be able to claim back part of the surcharge on labour by means of various tax credits, or because the tax on business income is lowered.

There is typically a constant conflict over the level of wages between employers and employees, since employers seek to limit or reduce wage-costs, while workers seek to increase their wages, or at least maintain them. How the level of wages develops depends on the demand for labour, the level of unemployment, and the ability of workers and employers to organise and take action with regard to pay claims.

Marx regarded wages as the &quot;external form&quot; of the value of labour power. The compensation of workers in capitalist society could take all kinds of different forms, but there was always both a paid and unpaid component of labour performed. The &quot;ideal&quot; form of wages for capitalism, he argued, were &quot;piece wages&quot; because in that case the capitalist paid only for labour which directly created those outputs adding value to his capital. It was the most efficient form of exploitation of labour power.

==Workers&#x27; consumption==
When labour power has been purchased and an employment contract signed, normally it is not yet paid for. First, labour power must be put to work in the production process. The employment contract is only a condition for uniting labour power with the means of production. From that point on, Marx argues, labour power at work is &quot;transformed into capital&quot;, specifically variable capital which accomplishes the valorisation process.

Functioning as variable capital, living labour creates both use values and new value, conserves the value of constant capital assets, and transfers part of the value of materials and equipment used to the new products. The result aimed for is the valorisation of invested capital, i.e. other things being equal, the value of capital is maintained and has also increased through the activity of living labour.

At the end of the working day, labour power has been more or less consumed, and must be restored through rest, eating and drinking, and recreation.

Medical estimates of the average holiday time necessary for fulltime workers to fully recuperate in a physiological and psychological sense from work stress during the year differ from country to country; but as an approximate gauge, three weeks continuous holiday is physiologically optimal for the average worker.

ILO statistics show a wide range of average hours worked and average holidays for different countries; for example, Korean workers work the most hours per year, and Americans have fewer formal holidays than West Europeans.

Several researchers have questioned however to what extent additional hours worked really increase the marginal productivity of labour; particularly in services, the work that gets done in five days could often also be done in four. The most difficult aspect to measure is the &quot;intensity&quot; of work, though some argue the incidence of work accidents are a reliable yardstick. If workers are laid off by an organization, but the organization continues to produce the same amount of output or services as before, or even more, with the same technology, we can often conclude that the intensity of work must have increased.

==The reproduction of workers==

Marx himself argued that:
This understanding, however, only captures the sense in which the reproduction of labour power comes at no cost to capitalists, like the reproduction of ecological conditions, but unlike the reproduction of, say, machine bolts and plastic wrap. Elites and governments have always sought to actively intervene or mediate in the process of the reproduction of labour power, through family legislation, laws regulating sexual conduct, medical provisions, education policies, and housing policies. Such interventions always carry an economic cost, but that cost can be socialized or forced upon workers themselves, especially women. In these areas of civil society, there has been a constant battle between conservatives, social reformists and radicals.

Marxist-Feminists have argued that in reality, household (domestic) labour by housewives which forms, maintains and restores the capacity to work is a large &quot;free gift&quot; to the capitalist economy. Time use surveys show that formally unpaid and voluntary labour is a very large part of the total hours worked in a society. Markets depend on that unpaid labour to function at all. Some feminists have therefore demanded that the government pay &quot;wages for housework&quot;. This demand conflicts with the legal framework of the government in capitalist society, which usually assumes a financial responsibility only for the upkeep of &quot;citizens&quot; and &quot;families&quot; lacking other sources of income or subsistence. 

Other social scientists have tackled this issue from a supercapitalist perspective. Economist Shirley P. Burggraf&#x27;s parental dividend concept proposes the replacement of existing government payments to the elderly based on an individual&#x27;s payroll tax contributions (e.g. US Social Security), with a new system granting retirement benefits proportional to the income of one&#x27;s own children. Such a system could theoretically introduce a return on investment for reproductive labor, thereby incentivizing the care and rearing of children.

==State management of labour relations==

The state can influence both the value and price of labour-power in numerous different ways, and normally it regulates wages and working conditions in the labour market to a greater or lesser extent. It can do so for example by:

*Stipulating minimum and maximum wage rates for work.
*Stipulating maximum and minimum working hours, and the retirement age.
*Stipulating minimum requirements for working conditions, workplace health and safety issues and the like.
*Stipulating requirements for labour contracts, trade union organization and wage bargaining.
*Legally defining the civil rights and entitlements of the workers.
*Adjusting direct and indirect tax rates, levies and tariffs for wage earners and employers in various ways.
*Adjusting social insurance policies, pension charges/claims and the like.
*Instituting and adjusting unemployment benefits and other social benefits.
*Subsidizing workers or their employers in various ways through eligibility to various benefits or supplements to salary.

*Influencing the general price level, by means of fiscal policy and monetary policy, or by instituting price controls for consumer goods and services.
*Regulating the consumption of goods and services by workers.
*Policing workers on the job and off-work, and prosecuting criminal activity with respect to workers&#x27; lives.
*Requiring military service from young workers at fixed pay rates.
*Creating additional jobs and employment by means of various policies, or, permitting unemployment to grow.
*Encouraging or preventing labour mobility and job mobility.
*Permitting or preventing the inflow of immigrant workers, or the emigration of workers.
*Stipulating legal requirements relating to the accommodation, health, sex life, family situation and pregnancy of workers.
*Organizing training schemes for workers.
Marx was very aware of this and in provides many illustrations, often taken from the Blue Books and factory inspector&#x27;s reports. Part of the role of the state is to secure those general (collective) conditions for the reproduction and maintenance of workers which individuals and private enterprise cannot secure by themselves for one reason or another—for example, because:

*providing those conditions practically requires an authority which stands above &quot;competing&quot; interests.
*meeting the conditions is too &quot;costly&quot; for private agencies, requiring investment funds not available to them.
*it is &quot;technically&quot; not possible to privatize those conditions.
*the conditions that have to be supplied are not sufficiently &quot;profitable&quot;, or &quot;too risky&quot; for private agencies.
*there is a specific &quot;political&quot; or &quot;moral&quot; reason why the state should intervene.

However, Marx did not provide a general theory of the state and the labour market. He intended to write a separate book on the subject of wages and the labour market (see &quot;Capital Vol. 1&quot;, Penguin edition, p. 683), but did not accomplish it, mainly because of bad health. Nevertheless, Marx made quite clear his belief that capitalism &quot;overturns all the legal or traditional barriers that would prevent it from buying this or that kind of labour-power as it sees fit, or from appropriating this or that kind of labour&quot; (&quot;Ibid&quot;., p. 1013). It is possible—apart from bad health—that he did not write a general critique of the state, because he lived himself as an exile in Britain, and therefore, he might have got into major trouble personally, if he had criticized the state publicly in his writings in ways not acceptable to the British state.

In modern times, the fact that the state has a big effect on wages and the value of labour power has given rise to the concepts of the social wage and collective consumption. If the state claims just as much money from workers through taxes and levies as it pays out to them, then it is of course doubtful whether the state really &quot;pays a social wage&quot;. However, more often the state &quot;redistributes&quot; income from one group or workers to another, reducing the income of some and increasing that of others.

==Quotation by Marx on the value of labour power and classical political economy==

==Labour market flexibilisation==
The commercial value of human labour power is strongly linked to the assertion of human needs by workers as citizens. It is not simply a question of supply and demand here, but of human needs which must be met. Therefore, labour costs have &quot;never&quot; been simply an &quot;economic&quot; or &quot;commercial&quot; matter, but also a moral, cultural and political issue.

In turn, this has meant that governments have typically strongly regulated the sale of labour power with laws and rules for labour contracts. These laws and rules affect e.g. the minimum wage, wage bargaining, the operation of trade unions, the obligations of employers in respect of employees, hiring and firing procedures, labour taxes, and unemployment benefits.

This has led to repeated criticism from employers that labour markets are over-regulated, and that the costs and obligations of hiring labour weigh too heavily on employers. Moreover, it is argued that over-regulation prevents the free movement of labour to where it is really necessary. If labour markets were deregulated by removing excessive legal restrictions, it is argued that costs to business would be reduced and more labour could be hired, thereby increasing employment opportunities and economic growth.

However, trade union representatives often argue that the real effect of deregulation is to reduce wages and conditions for workers, with the effect of reducing market demand for products.
In turn, the effect would be lower economic growth and a decline in living standards, with increased casualisation of labour and more &quot;contingent labour&quot;.
It is argued that, because the positions of employees and employers in the market are unequal (it is usually easier for an employer to loose an employee than an employee to loose an employer), employees must be legally protected against undue exploitation.
Otherwise employers will simply hire workers as and when it suits them, without regard for their needs as citizens.
A further twist in some countries is that unions are part of the political establishment, and not interested in collecting complaints and suggestions from individual employees, employing staff in proportion to dues received, backing employees&#x27; legal cases, or rocking the boat in their public statements. For example, in China some workers are in prison for criticising the official unions.

Often the demand for &quot;labour market flexibility&quot; is combined with the demand for strong immigration controls, to block any movement of labour which would be only a burden for capital accumulation. The term &quot;flexibility&quot; is used because, while capital must be able to move freely around the globe, the movement of labour must be strictly controlled. If that control does not exist, it is argued, it could mean additional costs to employers and taxpayers.

==Criticism==
It has been argued by Ian Steedman that Marx&#x27;s own concept of labour power was in truth very &quot;similar&quot; to that of David Ricardo and Adam Smith and, therefore, that Marx was not saying anything really new. However, Marx&#x27;s interpretation is (as he himself said) &quot;different&quot; from the &quot;natural price of labour&quot; of the classical political economists, because the &quot;free play of market forces&quot; does not gravitate spontaneously and automatically toward the &quot;natural price&quot; (the value) of labour power. Precisely because labour power is a unique and peculiar commodity, being lodged in the living worker, it does &quot;not&quot; conform to all the same laws as other kinds of commodities. Depending on social conditions, labour power may &quot;durably&quot; trade at prices well above, or below, its real value. Marx only assumed that labour power traded at its value, in order to show that even if that was the case, the worker was still economically exploited. But he was well aware that often labour power did not trade at its value, either because of unfavourable wage-bargaining conditions or because of labour scarcity.

A recent criticism by Prof. Marcel van der Linden is as follows: &quot;Marx&#x27;s thesis is based on two dubious assumptions, namely that labour needs to be offered for sale by the person who is the actual bearer and owner of such labour, and that the person who sells the labour sells nothing else. Why does this have to be the case? Why can labour not be sold by a party other than the bearer? What prevents the person who provides labour (his or her own or that of somebody else) from offering packages combining the labour with labour means? And why can a slave not perform wage labour for his master at the estate of some third party?&quot; This difficulty was first noted in research conducted during the 1980s by Tom Brass, gathered together in his 1999 book. 

The buying and selling of human work effort can and has taken many more different forms than Marx acknowledges—especially in the area of services. A modern information society makes possible all kinds of new forms of hustling.
Marx said himself that &quot;Above all [capitalism] overturns all the legal or traditional barriers that would prevent it from buying this or that kind of labour-power as it sees fit, or from appropriating this or that kind of labour&quot;. The concept of the value of labour power referred to the &quot;underlying economic relationship&quot;, not to be confused with the formalities of all the kinds of labour contracts which are possible.

<text>Lester Lowry Mays (July 24, 1935 – September 12, 2022) was an American businessman. He was the founder and chairman of Clear Channel Communications.

== Early years ==
Mays was born in Houston on July 24, 1935. His father, Lester T. Mays, was an executive in the steel industry and died in a car accident when Mays was twelve; his mother, Mary Virginia Lowry, became a real estate agent after her husband&#x27;s death. Mays was raised in University Park in suburban Dallas, where he attended Highland Park High School. He then studied at the A&amp;M College of Texas (now Texas A&amp;M University), where he received a Bachelor of Science in petroleum engineering.

After graduating in 1957, Mays joined the Air Force, where he served as an officer. Upon his discharge from the Air Force, Mays obtained a Master of Business Administration from Harvard University. He became an investment banker, rising to Vice President of Corporate Finance during his ten years at Russ &amp; Company.

== Clear Channel Communications ==
In 1972, Mays founded the San Antonio Broadcasting Company, which became Clear Channel Communications. The company purchased its first radio station, KEEZ-FM in San Antonio in 1972. He and his business partner Red McCombs bought a second San Antonio Station, WOAI, in 1975. This station was considered a &quot;clear channel&quot; station because no other station operated on its frequency and its 50,000-watt signal could be heard hundreds or even thousands of miles away on a clear night. Over the next several years, the company bought ten more struggling radio stations and turned them profitable, usually by switching their formats to religious or talk programming. Their first non–San Antonio acquisition was 1250 KPAC and 98.5 KPAC-FM in Port Arthur, bought from the then Port Arthur College, now Lamar-Port Arthur. KPAC-FM was upgraded by Clear Channel in the early 1980s to be their first &quot;Houston&quot; station when the company built a 2,000-ft tower near Devers, Texas, hoping to cover Houston. The effort failed to meet expectations and the station was sold after Clear Channel bought radio stations with in-town Houston signals. The company went public in 1984. Four years later, the company bought its first television station.

By the mid-90s, Clear Channel Communications owned 43 radio and 16 television stations. After the Telecommunications Act of 1996 significantly deregulated the broadcast industry, Mays and his company purchased 49 radio stations and an interest in New Zealand&#x27;s largest radio group. A merger with Jacor Communications, based in Covington, Kentucky (which had bought the former broadcast side of Nationwide Insurance a year earlier), brought the operation of 450 stations to the Clear Channel portfolio. Within eight years, and with an influx of capital investment from the private-equity Griffith Family, Clear Channel had accumulated ownership of over 1,200 radio stations and 41 television stations in the United States, one of the nation&#x27;s leading live entertainment companies, and over 750,000 outdoor advertising displays.

In 2003, Mays testified before the US Senate that the deregulation of the telecommunications industry had not hurt the public. However, in an interview that same year with &quot;Fortune&quot; magazine, he remarked, &quot;We&#x27;re not in the business of providing news and information. We&#x27;re not in the business of providing well-researched music. We&#x27;re simply in the business of selling our customers&#x27; products.&quot;

Mays was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 2004. After suffering a stroke the following year, Mays relinquished his position as a CEO of the company to his son, Mark Mays.

== Texas A&amp;M University ==
Mays served on the Texas A&amp;M Board of Regents from 1985 to 1991. He was reappointed to the Board of Regents in 2001 and served as chairman of the Board of Regents from 2003 to 2005. He was also a chair of the Presidential Library Committee and a member of the Committee on Buildings and Physical Plant and was the Board&#x27;s special liaison to the Texas A&amp;M Foundation. His final term on the Board of Regents expired on February 1, 2007.

Mays donated a substantial amount of money to the school to improve the business department. In 1996, A&amp;M rewarded him by renaming their business school, now Mays Business School, in his honor.

== Personal life and death ==
Mays served as a chairman of the United Way of San Antonio. He was also a member of the Associates Board at Harvard Business School. He was inducted into the Texas Business Hall of Fame in 1999.

Mays was married to Peggy Pitman from 1959 until her death in November 2020. Together, they had four children, Kathy, Mark, Linda, and Randall Mays. They lived in San Antonio, Texas, where they oversaw the operations and giving of the Mays Family Foundation. His son-in-law, Michael McCaul, is a Republican congressman from Texas&#x27;s 10th congressional district.

Mays died in San Antonio on September 12, 2022, at age 87.

<doc id="859787" wikidata="Q65122127" url="?curid=859787" title="Waitomo">
<text>Waitomo is a rural community in the King Country region of New Zealand&#x27;s North Island. There are several solutional cave systems in the area around the village, which are popular tourist attractions. Restaurants and accommodation are centred in the village to serve visiting tourists.

The word &quot;Waitomo&quot; comes from the Māori language: &quot;wai&quot; meaning water and &quot;tomo&quot; meaning a doline or sinkhole; it can thus be translated to be &quot;water passing through a hole&quot;. The caves are formed in Oligocene limestone.

The historic Waitomo Caves Hotel is located in Waitomo Caves village.

== History ==
The village Waitomo Caves is named for the hundreds of caves present in the spectacular karst landscape.

The limestone landscape of the Waitomo District area has been the centre of increasingly popular commercial caving tourism since before 1900. Initially mostly consisting of impromptu trips guided by local Māori, a large cave system near Waitomo Caves were nationalised by the Crown and managed as a (relatively genteel) tourism attraction from 1904 onwards. A 1915 guide said, &quot;It is reached by railway to Hangatiki, thence 6 miles by coach along a good road&quot;.

A visit to Waitomo Caves made number 14 amongst a list of 101 &quot;Kiwi must-do&#x27;s&quot; in a New Zealand Automobile Association poll of over 20,000 motorists published 2007, and in 2004, around 400,000 visitors entered caves in the area.

The Waitomo Caves Museum provides information about the karst landscape, caves and caving and the history of the area.

== Tourist caves ==

Companies specialise in leading tourists through the caves of the area, from easily accessible areas with hundreds of tourists per hour in the peak season, to extreme sports, like crawls into cave systems, which are only seen by a few tourists each day.

The caves are noted for their stalactite and stalagmite displays, and (in the caves with streams running through) for the presence of glowworms (the fungus gnat &quot;Arachnocampa luminosa&quot;).

== Walks ==

The Waitomo Walkway runs through the valley of the Waitomo Stream (a tributary of the Waipā River) for from the village to the Ruakuri Scenic Reserve. At the reserve the Ruakuri Walk leads through short caves to the Ruakuri Natural Bridge.

Te Araroa, a national long distance walkway, passes through Waitomo. The section from Mt Pirongia joins the Waitomo Walkway to enter the village. The section to Te Kuiti goes over Mangapu River suspension bridge and through Pehitawa kahikatea forest.

<text>Vasily Mikhailovich Golovnin (Russian: Василий Михайлович Головнин; , Gulyniki, Ryazan Oblast – , Saint Petersburg) was a Russian navigator, Vice Admiral, and corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences (1818).

==Early life and career==
Vasily Mikhailovich Golovnin was born in April 1776, in the village of Gulyniki in Ryazan Oblast, on his father&#x27;s country estate. Both his father and grandfather had served in the Russian military as officers in the elite Preobrazhensky Lifeguard regiment. Golovnin appeared set to continue the family tradition, but his father died while he was still a child, and at the age of twelve he was enrolled in the Russian Naval College as a cadet. He graduated four years later in 1792.

Golovnin entered active service as a midshipman in May and June 1790, participating in several naval battles against the Swedes. He served in several foreign campaigns between 1793 and 1798. From 1798 to 1800 he served as adjutant and interpreter to Vice Admiral M. K. Makarov, commander of a Russian squadron operating jointly with the British fleet in the North Sea.

On the orders of Tsar Alexander I, Golovnin was sent, along with several other Russian officers, to obtain further training aboard British ships. He served three years (1802–1805) with the British fleet under Admirals Nelson, Collingwood, and Cornwallis. During this period, war was once again declared between the British and French, and Golovnin saw action while serving under Admiral Nelson.
He returned to Russia in 1806, and began compiling a code of naval signals on the English pattern, which remained in use by the Russian fleet for more than twenty years.

==&quot;Diana&quot;″s voyage==

Golovnin was given command of the sloop &quot;Diana&quot; in 1806, and made his first voyage around the world (1807—1809), with the object of conducting a survey of the northern Pacific, and transporting supplies to Okhotsk.

&quot;Diana&quot; set sail from Kronstadt on 7 July 1807. A severe storm in April 1808 prevented &quot;Diana&quot; from sailing around Cape Horn, and Golovnin decided to set sail for the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, to restock the ship&#x27;s supplies. He anchored in the nearby port of Simon&#x27;s Town on 3 May 1808. Golovnin, having been at sea for ten months, was unaware that Russian relations with Britain had deteriorated, and Russia had allied herself with the French. &quot;Diana&quot; was immediately detained as an enemy vessel by a British naval squadron, pending receipt of appropriate instructions from London. Golovnin and his crew spent more than a year detained aboard &quot;Diana&quot; at Simon&#x27;s Town awaiting a decision from British authorities. When it became increasingly clear that a decision might never come, Golovnin began to plot their escape. On 28 May 1809, perfect conditions presented themselves - a fair wind and poor visibility. The crew severed the anchor cables, and managed successfully to sail out of the bay, passing directly in front of several British warships. Once the British discovered that they had escaped, they set off in pursuit, but failed to overtake &quot;Diana&quot;, which sailed safely to Kamchatka in 1810, and news of &quot;Diana&quot;″s &quot;audacious escape&quot; quickly spread throughout the world.
Golovnin left Kamchatka in 1810, sailing to Baranof Island, a recently settled outpost of the Russian-American Company.

In 1819, he published an account of their voyage, detention and escape, titled &quot;Journey of the Russian Emperor’s sloop Diana from Kronstadt to Kamchatka&quot;.

==Captivity in Japan==

In 1811, Golovnin described and mapped the Kuril Islands from the Strait of Hope to the eastern shores of Iturup Island (Etorofu in Japanese).
While exploring Kunashir Island (Kunashiri in Japanese), he was lured ashore, taken prisoner, charged with violating Sakoku (a Japanese policy prohibiting foreigners from entering Japan), and held captive for two years by the Japanese on the island of Hokkaido. Golovnin was said to possess a &quot;superior education and fascination with foreign cultures.&quot; After making one failed attempt to escape his captors, Golovnin decided to utilize his time in detainment to master the Japanese language, and familiarize himself with Japanese culture and traditions.

Golovnin was released in 1813, returned to Russia, and published an account of his years in captivity. His book, &quot;Captivity in Japan During the Years 1811, 1812, 1813&quot;, became an instant classic. It was hailed in Russia as an authoritative volume on Japanese culture, and helped shape an entire generation&#x27;s view of Japan. Golovnin clearly respected the Japanese, portraying them &quot;as intelligent, as patriotic, and as worthy rivals&quot; of the Russians in the Pacific. His representation of Japanese religious practices also became influential in Europe; he claimed that the Japanese practiced a form of Hinduism or Indian religion but a minority followed a distant, indigenous form of Christianity, influencing later scholars&#x27; claims about Japanese religion well into the 19th century. The captivity of Golovnin almost led to war between Russia and Japan in what became known as the Golovnin Incident.

==Around the world on the Kamchatka==
On 7 September 1817, Golovnin set out on a second voyage around the world aboard the frigate &quot;Kamchatka.&quot; Serving under him were three future Russian explorers of prominence - Fyodor Litke, Fyodor Matyushkin, and Ferdinand von Wrangel. After sailing around Cape Horn, the objective was to deliver supplies to Kamchatka, and survey previously unexplored islands along what is now the northwestern coast of Alaska. Golovnin was also tasked with compiling a report detailing relations between the Kodiak Islanders and employees of the Russian-American Company.

He arrived in Kamchatka the following May, then returned to Europe via the Cape of Good Hope, completing his circumnavigation by landing at St Petersburg on 17 September 1819. After the journey, Golovnin published &quot;Around the World on the Kamchatka&quot;, describing his voyage, and his encounters with the native Kodiak and Sandwich Islanders. Though the journey had &quot;achieved little in the way of new discoveries,&quot; Golovnin returned with &quot;a vast store of scientific and astronomical information&quot; to share with Russian scientists.

In the book &quot;The Lost Pianos of Siberia&quot; by Sophy Roberts, it is mentioned that Golovnin was &quot;busted&quot; out of his Japanese captivity by Pyotr Rikord, the newly appointed chief of Kamchatka. As a &quot;thank you&quot; Golovnin rewarded Rikord&#x27;s wife Lyudmila, a keen pianist, with a piano shipped all the way from St Petersburg, which took eight months and eight days to deliver.

==Later career and death==
In 1821, Golovnin was appointed assistant director of the Russian Naval College, and later, in 1823, General Quartermaster of the Fleet.
A talented administrator, Golovnin successfully managed the activities of the shipbuilding, commissariat, and artillery departments. Under his supervision, over two hundred ships were built, including the first Russian steamships. Golovnin also served as a mentor to numerous Russian navigators, including the aforementioned Fyodor Litke and Ferdinand von Wrangel.

Golovnin died of cholera during an epidemic that swept through the city of Saint Petersburg in 1831.

==Legacy and honors==

Golovnin was awarded many honors during his life, including the Order of St. Vladimir and the Order of Saint George, serving as commander of the latter. 
According to one historian, his literary works detailing his adventures at sea and on shore remain notable due to his &quot;respect for historical detail...[his] critical ability, literary skill, and lively curiosity.&quot; A complete edition was published at St Petersburg in five volumes in 1864, with maps and charts, and a biography of the author.

The village of Golovin, Alaska, Cape Golovnin, as well as Golovnin Bay and Golovnin Lagoon, are all named in honor of Vasily Golovnin. A strait between two of the Kuril Islands, Golovnin volcano on Kunashir Island, capes on Novaya Zemlya and Franz Josef Land, are among other landmarks bearing his name. The cape of Point Hope in Alaska was also originally named in Golovnin&#x27;s honor.

==Family==
Golovnin married the daughter of a Tver landowner and retired army officer, Evdokiya Stepanovna Lutkovskaya (1795–1884). All four of Evdokiya&#x27;s brothers served in the Russian Navy; two of them, Peter and Feopemt Lutkovsky, became Admirals, and rose to great prominence.

Admiral Feopemt Lutkovsky (1803–1852) served under Golovnin during his voyage aboard the &quot;Kamchatka&quot; (1817–1819). Feopemt was described as &quot;free thinking&quot;, and according to testimony given by individuals involved in the Decembrist Uprising, he was in close communication with several members of their society. He avoided prosecution for treason due to the intervention of Fyodor Litke. Evdokiya&#x27;s sister Ekaterina also married a naval officer, Rear Admiral Maksim Maksimovich Genning.

Golovnin&#x27;s son, Alexander Vasilyevich Golovnin (1821–1886), initially followed in his father&#x27;s footsteps, serving in the Russian Navy.
A close friend and associate of Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich, Alexander retired from the Navy, and served as Minister of Education (1861–1866) under Tsar Alexander II. In addition to his work as a naval officer and bureaucrat, Alexander served as director of the journal &quot;Morskoi Sbornik,&quot; and was actively involved in the Zemstvo. It was Alexander who preserved, collected, and eventually published his father&#x27;s works under the title &quot;Works and Translations&quot; (&quot;Sochineniia i Perevody&quot;).

<text>Norman Cyril Jackson VC (8 April 1919 – 26 March 1994) was a sergeant in the Royal Air Force (RAF) who earned the Victoria Cross during a Second World War bombing raid on Schweinfurt, Germany in April 1944.

==Early life==
Born in Ealing, Middlesex, Jackson was adopted as a one-week-old baby by Mr. and Mrs. Edwin Gunter. The Gunters also adopted Geoffrey Oliver Hartley, who in 1951 was awarded the George Medal as a Federation of Malaya police lieutenant for protecting his party, which included three children, from bandits. Upon this occasion, Mrs. Gunter said, &quot;We adopted two of the finest sons any parents could wish for.&quot;

Jackson qualified as a fitter and turner. Although he was married and in a reserved occupation at the outbreak of the Second World War, he enlisted in the RAF.

==Military career==
He joined the RAF Volunteer Reserve in 1939 and originally served as a Classified Fitter IIE (engines). In January 1941, he was assigned to a Sunderland flying boat squadron based in Freetown, Sierra Leone. He applied for retraining as a flight engineer and returned to England in September 1942.

On 28 July 1943, he joined No. 106 Squadron which operated Avro Lancaster bombers. Jackson completed his tour of 30 missions on 24 April 1944, but, as he had flown one sortie with a different crew, he chose to fly once more so that he and his original aircrew could finish their tour together. Jackson&#x27;s 31st mission was a raid on the German ball bearing factories at Schweinfurt on the night of 26–27 April.

Having bombed the target, Jackson&#x27;s Lancaster (serial ME669) was attacked by a German night fighter and a fuel tank in the starboard wing caught fire. Jackson, already wounded from shell splinters, strapped on a parachute and equipped himself with a fire extinguisher before climbing out of the aircraft and onto the wing, whilst the aeroplane was flying at , in order to put out the fire. He gripped the air intake on the leading edge of the wing with one hand, and fought the fire with the other. The flames seared his hands, face, and clothes. The fighter returned and hit the bomber with a burst of gunfire that sent two bullets into his legs. The burst also swept him off the wing.

He fell , but his smouldering and holed parachute worked well enough to save his life. He suffered further injuries upon landing, including a broken ankle, but managed to crawl to a nearby German village the next morning, where he was paraded through the street.

He spent 10 months recovering in hospital before being transferred to Stalag IX-C prisoner-of-war camp. He made two escape attempts, the second of which was successful as he made contact with a unit of the US Third Army.

Jackson&#x27;s exploit became known when the surviving crewmen of his bomber were released from German captivity at the end of the war. He was promoted to warrant officer and his Victoria Cross (VC) award was gazetted on 26 October 1945. When he went to Buckingham Palace to receive his VC from King George VI, he was accompanied by Leonard Cheshire, who was also due to receive his on that day. Group Captain Cheshire insisted that, despite the difference in rank, they should approach the King together. Jackson remembers that Cheshire said to the King, &quot;This chap stuck his neck out more than I did – he should get his VC first! Of course the King had to keep to protocol but I will never forget what Cheshire said.&quot;

===The crew members===
* Pilot – Flying Officer Frederick Manuel Mifflin – killed in action on April 27, 1944.
* Navigator – Flight Sergeant Frank Lewis Higgins – imprisoned in Stalag 357 Kopernikus prisoner-of-war camp.
* Bombardier – Flight Sergeant Maurice Harry Toft – imprisoned in Stalag 357 Kopernikus prisoner-of-war camp.
* Weapon systems officer – Flight Sergeant Ernest &quot;Sandy&quot; Sandelands – imprisoned in Stalag 357 Kopernikus prisoner-of-war camp.
* Air Gunner – Flight Sergeant Walter &quot;Smudger&quot; Smith – imprisoned in Stalag 357 Kopernikus prisoner-of-war camp.
* Air Gunner – Flight Sergeant Norman Hugh Johnson – killed in action on April 27, 1944.

===Victoria Cross citation===
Extract from Fourth Supplement, &quot;The London Gazette&quot; No 37324 of Friday 26 October 1945:

==Postwar and personal life==
After the war, he worked as a travelling salesman of Haig whisky.

He and his wife Alma had seven children. Jackson died on 26 March 1994 at Hampton Hill, in the London Borough of Richmond upon Thames, and is buried in Twickenham Cemetery.

==Legacy==

In April 2004, Jackson&#x27;s VC medal was sold at auction to Lord Ashcroft for £235,250 (GBP) against a pre-auction estimate of £130,000. His family were upset because the medal went to a private bidder rather than the RAF museum at Hendon. They had planned to give their father&#x27;s medals to the museum, but found they could not do so under the terms of their mother&#x27;s will and the museum was outbid. His VC is now on display in the Lord Ashcroft Gallery at the Imperial War Museum, London.

Norman Jackson&#x27;s son appeared in the episode on his father&#x27;s crew in Lord Ashcroft&#x27;s documentary series &quot;Heroes of the Skies&quot; (broadcast on Channel Five on 4 October 2012), as well as the Discovery Channel&#x27;s &quot;Air Aces&quot; (premiering October 2013), and &quot;Air Aces:Full Throttle&quot; (premiering 17 March 2014).
On Nov. 16 2024, the YouTube channel &quot;Yarnhub&quot; published an animated dramatization of this spectacular flight.

<doc id="859798" wikidata="Q8539331" url="?curid=859798" title="Bottled gas">
<text>Bottled gas is a term used for substances which are gaseous at standard temperature and pressure (STP) and have been compressed and stored in carbon steel, stainless steel, aluminum, or composite containers known as gas cylinders.

==Gas state in cylinders==
There are four cases: either the substance remains a gas at standard temperature but increased pressure, the substance liquefies at standard temperature but increased pressure, the substance is dissolved in a solvent, or the substance is liquefied at reduced temperature and increased pressure. In the last case the bottle is constructed with an inner and outer shell separated by a vacuum (dewar flask) so that the low temperature can be maintained by evaporative cooling.

===Case I===
The substance remains a &quot;gas&quot; at &quot;standard temperature&quot; and &quot;increased pressure&quot;, its critical temperature being below standard temperature. Examples include:
* air
* argon
* fluorine
* helium
* hydrogen
* krypton
* nitrogen
* oxygen

===Case II===
The substance &quot;liquefies&quot; at &quot;standard temperature&quot; but &quot;increased pressure&quot;. Examples include:
* ammonia
* butane
* carbon dioxide (also packaged as a cryogenic gas, Case IV)
* chlorine
* nitrous oxide
* propane
* sulfur dioxide

===Case III===
The substance is &quot;dissolved&quot; at &quot;standard temperature&quot; in a solvent. Examples include:
* carbon dioxide in the form of a soft drink
* sulfur trioxide in the form of fuming sulfuric acid
* nitrogen dioxide in the form of red-fuming nitric acid
* hydrogen chloride in the form of muriatic acid
** Note: these four are most often found in containers other than metal bottles, and at low pressure, e.g. .
* acetylene
** Note: Acetylene cylinders contain an inert packing material, which may be agamassan, and are filled with a solvent such as acetone or dimethylformamide. The acetylene is pumped into the cylinder and it dissolves in the solvent. When the cylinder is opened the acetylene comes back out of solution, much like a carbonated beverage bubbles when opened. This is a workaround to acetylene&#x27;s propensity to explode when pressurized above 200 kPa or liquified.

===Case IV===
The substance is &quot;liquefied&quot; at &quot;reduced temperature&quot; and &quot;increased pressure&quot;. These are also referred to as cryogenic gases. Examples include:
* liquid nitrogen (LN2)
* liquid hydrogen (LH2)
* liquid oxygen (LOX)
* carbon dioxide (also packaged as a liquefied gas, Case II)

:Note: cryogenic gases are typically equipped with some type of &#x27;bleed&#x27; device to prevent overpressure from rupturing the bottle and to allow evaporative cooling to continue.

==Expansion and volume==
The general rule is that one unit volume of liquid will expand to approximately 800 unit volumes of gas at standard temperature and pressure with some variation due to intermolecular force and molecule size compared to an ideal gas. Normal high pressure gas cylinders will hold gas at pressures from . An ideal gas pressurised to 200 bar in a cylinder would contain 200 times as much as the volume of the cylinder at atmospheric pressure, but real gases will contain less than that by a few percent. At higher pressures, the shortfall is greater.

==Special handling considerations==
Because the contents are under high pressure and are sometimes hazardous, there are special safety regulations for handling bottled gases. These include chaining bottles to prevent falling and breaking, proper ventilation to prevent injury or death in case of leaks and signage to indicate the potential hazards.

In the United States, the Compressed Gas Association (CGA) sells a number of booklets and pamphlets on safe handling and use of bottled gases. (Members of the CGA can get the pamphlets for free.) The European Industrial Gases Association and the British Compressed Gases Association provide similar facilities in Europe and the United Kingdom.

==Nomenclature differences==
In the United States, &#x27;bottled gas&#x27; typically refers to liquefied petroleum gas. &#x27;Bottled gas&#x27; is sometimes used in medical supply, especially for portable oxygen tanks. Packaged industrial gases are frequently called &#x27;cylinder gas&#x27;, though &#x27;bottled gas&#x27; is sometimes used.

The United Kingdom and other parts of Europe more commonly refer to &#x27;bottled gas&#x27; when discussing any usage whether industrial, medical or liquefied petroleum. However, in contrast, what the United States calls liquefied petroleum gas is known generically in the United Kingdom as &#x27;LPG&#x27;; and it may be ordered using by one of several Trade names, or specifically as butane or propane depending on the required heat output.

==Colour coding==
Different countries have different gas colour codes but attempts are being made to standardise the colours of cylinder shoulders:
* Colours of cylinders for Medical gases are covered by an International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standard, ISO 32; but not all countries use this standard.
* Within Europe gas cylinders colours are being standardised according to EN 1089-3, the standard colours applying to the cylinder shoulder only; i.e., the top of the cylinder close to the pillar valve.
* In the United States, colour-coding is not regulated by law.

The user should not rely on the colour of a cylinder to indicate what it contains. The label or decal should always be checked for product identification.

===European cylinder colours===
The colours below are specific shades, defined in the European Standard in terms of RAL coordinates. The requirements are based on a combination of a few named gases, otherwise on the primary hazard associated with the gas contents:

====Specific gases====
====Based on gas properties====
====Gas mixtures, mostly for diving====
Diving cylinders are left unpainted (for aluminium), or painted to prevent corrosion (for steel), often in bright colors, most often fluorescent yellow, to increase visibility. This should not be confused with industrial gases, where a yellow shoulder means chlorine.

<text>The candar corps () was the name given to palace guards in Turkish and Islamic states in the Middle Ages. Also in Persian and in some Arab states, certain soldier classes were also called &quot;candar&quot;. They were especially assigned to guard palaces and the heads of state. 

In the Great Seljuq Empire, the candar corps consisted of specially trained Turkish and foreign slaves. The head of the candar corps was called &quot;Emir-i Candar&quot; and he was included in the governing body. After the breakup of the empire, some members of this corps went to the Turkoman beyliks in Anatolia, Shiraz, Khorasan, and through the Mamluks to Yemen and Maghreb states to take up being palace guards. 

In Anatolian Seljuqs (Sultanate of Rûm), candars guarded the palace and the head of state and his headquarters, together with the &quot;Hassa&quot; soldiers. They were cavalrymen, and they would use swords, bows and carry shields. One of these candars who actually was in the Seljuq court, Demir Yaman Candar, founded his own Jandarid principality, near Kastamonu, Turkey.

In the Mamluk palace, the candar corps was as large as a regiment, and was divided into smaller units called &quot;nevbe&quot;. They had wider authorities and responsibilities, such as accompanying those who would enter the court, accompanying the monarch himself at campaigns to protect him, performing arrests and executions, as well as guarding the prison allocated to political insurgents. 

The Ottoman Turks did not have candars at their courts; instead they had set up a different institution to take up their position.

<text>Charles Moffett (September 6, 1929 – February 14, 1997) was an American free jazz drummer.

== Biography ==
Moffett was born in Fort Worth, Texas, where he attended I.M. Terrell High School with Ornette Coleman. Before switching to drums, Moffett began his musical career as a trumpeter. At the age of 13, he played trumpet with Jimmy Witherspoon, and later formed a band, the Jam Jivers, with fellow students Coleman and Prince Lasha. After switching to drums, Moffett briefly performed with Little Richard.

Moffett served in the United States Navy, after which he pursued boxing before studying music at Huston-Tillotson College in Austin. Moffett married in 1953 (Coleman was best man, and performed at the wedding), then began teaching music at a public school in Rosenberg, Texas

In 1961, Moffett moved to New York City to work with Ornette Coleman, but the saxophonist soon went into a brief retirement period. Moffett worked with Sonny Rollins, appeared on Archie Shepp&#x27;s album &quot;Four for Trane&quot;, and led a group that included Pharoah Sanders and Carla Bley. When Coleman returned to performing in 1964, he formed a trio with Moffett and bassist David Izenzon. Moffett also performed on vibraphone.

Moffett began teaching music at New York Public Schools as a way to make ends meet when Coleman made only sporadic performances. Moffett taught at P.S. 58 (Carrol School) in Brooklyn and at P.S. 177 M (under the Manhattan Bridge and now defunct). He also taught at a Brooklyn High School. Moffett moved to Oakland, California, where he served as the city&#x27;s music director, and was later the principal of the alternative &quot;Odyssey&quot; public school in Berkeley in the mid-1970s. The title of his first solo album &quot;The Gift&quot; is a reference to his love of teaching music. His then seven-year-old son Codaryl played drums on that album. Moffett later returned to Brooklyn, New York, and taught at P.S. 142 Stranahan Junior High School (Closed in 2006) and at P.S. 58 Carroll School.

His children are double bassist Charnett Moffett, drummer Codaryl &quot;Cody&quot; Moffett, vocalist Charisse Moffett, trumpeter Mondre Moffett, and saxophonist Charles Moffett, Jr.

<text>Ivan Morton Niven (October 25, 1915 May 9, 1999) was a Canadian-American number theorist best remembered for his work on Waring&#x27;s problem. He worked for many years as a professor at the University of Oregon, and was president of the Mathematical Association of America. He wrote several books on mathematics.

==Life==
Niven was born in Vancouver. He did his undergraduate studies at the University of British Columbia and was awarded his doctorate in 1938 from the University of Chicago. He was a member of the University of Oregon faculty from 1947 to his retirement in 1981. He was president of the Mathematical Association of America (MAA) from 1983 to 1984.

He died in 1999 in Eugene, Oregon.

==Research==
Niven completed the solution of most of Waring&#x27;s problem in 1944. This problem, based on a 1770 conjecture by Edward Waring, consists of finding the smallest number formula_1 such that every positive integer is the sum of at most formula_1 formula_3-th powers of positive integers. David Hilbert had proved the existence of such a formula_1 in 1909; Niven&#x27;s work established the value of formula_1 for all but finitely many values of formula_3.

Niven gave an elementary proof that formula_7 is irrational in 1947. 

Niven numbers, Niven&#x27;s constant, and Niven&#x27;s theorem are named for Niven.

He has an Erdős number of 1 because he coauthored a paper with Paul Erdős, on partial sums of the harmonic series.

==Recognition==
Niven received the University of Oregon&#x27;s Charles E. Johnson Award in 1981. He received the MAA Distinguished Service Award in 1989.

He won a Lester R. Ford Award in 1970. In 2000, the asteroid 12513 Niven, discovered in 1998, was named after him.

<text>The Lunar Precursor Robotic Program (LPRP) is a NASA program that uses robotic spacecraft to prepare for future crewed missions to the Moon. The program gathers data such as lunar radiation, surface imaging, areas of scientific interest, temperature and lighting conditions, and potential resource identification.

Two LPRP missions, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) and the Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS), were launched in June 2009. The lift-off above Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida on June 18, 2009, was successful. The uncrewed Atlas V rocket launched the two space probes towards the Moon, where they will provide a 3D map and search for water in conjunction with the Hubble Space Telescope, launching on June 17, 2009.

This lunar program marked the first United States mission to the Moon in over ten years. Neil Armstrong&#x27;s first step on the Moon occurred on July 20, 1969, and this launch was 32 days before its 40th anniversary. The LRO entered a low orbit around the Moon, while the LCROSS mission performed a &quot;swing-by&quot; and entered a different orbit to set up a collision with the Moon&#x27;s surface several months later. The projected lunar impact of the Centaur and LCROSS spacecraft was on October 9, 2009, at 11:30 UT (7:30 a.m. EDT, 4:30 a.m. PDT), ± 30 minutes. The plume from the Centaur impact was predicted by NASA to be visible through telescopes with apertures as small as 10 to .

== Program history ==

Initially, the LPRP program was a part of the Science Mission Directorate of NASA (SMD) and was called the Robotic Lunar Exploration Program (RLEP). Management of the RLEP program was assigned to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in February 2004. At that time, the Program&#x27;s goal was to &quot;...initiate a series of robotic missions to the Moon to prepare for and support future human exploration activities.&quot;

In 2005, responsibility for RLEP was moved to NASA&#x27;s Exploration Systems Mission Directorate (ESMD) and management was assigned to the Ames Research Center (ARC). In 2006, the program was renamed the Lunar Precursor Robotic Program and management responsibility was reassigned to the Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC). The US$583 million space mission comes equipped with a $504 million LRO space probe and a $79 million LCROSS satellite.

=== LRO ===

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) is the first mission of the LPRP program. Management of the LRO was assigned to Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) in 2004. The LRO launched on an Atlas V 401 rocket from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on June 18, 2009, at 5:32 p.m. EDT (2132 GMT). The planned liftoff at 5:12 p.m. EDT (2112 GMT) was delayed by 20 minutes due to thunderstorms. The LRO was scheduled to orbit the Moon for one year, gathering high-resolution images of the lunar surface that would allow the creation of detailed maps. The LRO&#x27;s goals included finding safe landing sites for human visits to the Moon, identifying lunar resources, studying the lunar radiation environment, and providing a 3D map of the Moon&#x27;s surface to allow astronauts to return to the Moon by 2020. The LRO carried seven main instruments, including the Cosmic Ray Telescope for the Effects of Radiation (CRaTER), the Diviner Lunar Radiometer Experiment (DLRE), the Lyman-Alpha Mapping Project (LAMP), the Lunar Exploration Neutron Detector (LEND), the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA), the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), and the Miniature Radio Frequency radar (Mini-RF).

=== LCROSS ===

The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) mission is to be launched with the LRO. It was selected as a secondary payload in 2006, and management of the program was assigned to Ames Research Center (ARC). The mission will explore a permanently shadowed region of a lunar pole by crashing the spent Centaur rocket upper stage of the Atlas V launch vehicle into a dark crater. The composition of the ejecta plume will be observed by a shepherding spacecraft, which will itself crash-land 4 minutes later, creating a second plume. NASA expects the impact velocity will be over 9,000 km/h (5,600 mph). The ejecta plume will weigh in the order of 350 tons (317 metric tons) and rise from the surface.

===LADEE===

The Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) launched on September 7, 2013. LADEE studied the lunar exosphere and dust in the Moon&#x27;s vicinity.

==Future projects==
For a hypothetical International Lunar Network, NASA and international partners planned to land two stations on the lunar surface. Their objective was to establish a robotic set of geophysical monitoring stations on the surface and, eventually, in lunar orbit as well.

==Data processing==
The Lunar Mapping and Modeling project is using the obtained data to develop detailed topographic maps of the lunar surface that support lunar science, exploration, commercial, educational, and public outreach activities. In addition, solar radiation levels will be mapped and modelled. These integrated data will be used by NASA to make decisions about, for example, lunar outpost designs.

<doc id="859821" wikidata="Q7870073" url="?curid=859821" title="USS Hazelwood (DD-531)">
<text>USS &quot;Hazelwood&quot; (DD-531) was a World War II-era in the service of the United States Navy. The ship was the second named for Commodore John Hazelwood; a naval leader in the American Continental Navy.

== World War II ==

&quot;Hazelwood&quot; was laid down 11 April 1942 by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., San Francisco, California; launched 20 November 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Harold J. Fosdick; and commissioned 18 June 1943.

After shakedown, &quot;Hazelwood&quot; departed the West Coast 5 September. Reaching Pearl Harbor 9 September, she sailed 2 days later with a fast carrier strike force under Rear Admiral C. A. Pownall in &quot;Lexington&quot; to launch carrier-based air strikes against Tarawa, Gilbert Islands. &quot;Hazelwood&quot; next joined a second fast carrier force—6 carriers, 7 cruisers, and 24 destroyers under Rear Admiral Alfred E. Montgomery—for strikes against Wake Island 5 October and 6 October.

Returning to Pearl Harbor 11 October, the destroyer took part in intensive training to prepare for the giant amphibious drive to Japan. She joined Task Force 53 under Vice Admiral Raymond A. Spruance at Havannah Harbor, New Hebrides, 5 November. Departing 13 November, she took part in invasion of the Gilbert Islands 20 November. In one of the bitterest struggles during the fleet&#x27;s push across the Pacific, she served on antisubmarine patrol and as standby fighter-director ship. &quot;Hazelwood&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor 7 December 1943 to prepare for the next operation.

As the war in the Pacific gained momentum, &quot;Hazelwood&quot; sortied from Pearl Harbor 22 January 1944 as part of Task Force 52 under Admiral Spruance for the invasion of Kwajalein and Majuro Atolls in the Marshall Islands. After troops stormed ashore 31 January, she anchored in Kwajalein Harbor as primary fighter-director ship and also patrolled against enemy submarines. This objective secured, she departed Kwajalein 15 February for several months of patrol and escort duty through the Solomons and Marshalls. She also bombarded Japanese shore positions at Ungalabu Harbor and a tank farm on New Ireland.

===Palau===
&quot;Hazelwood&quot; next participated in the invasion of the Palaus. As the 1st Marine Division landed on Peleliu, Palau Islands, 15 September, she pounded enemy shore positions with gunfire to lessen Japanese opposition. She remained off Peleliu on patrol until 3 October, when she sailed to Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island. There the never-resting veteran joined Vice Admiral Kinkaid&#x27;s naval forces for the invasion and liberation of the Philippines. As troops landed under naval cover on Leyte 20 October, &quot;Hazelwood&quot; came under heavy Japanese air attacks.

The next week brought constant enemy air raids and a succession of far reaching fleet moves as the Imperial Navy made one final but futile effort to drive America out of the Philippines and regain some measure of control over the seas. In this struggle, known to history as the Battle of Leyte Gulf, the Japanese Navy was all but annihilated. Three enemy battleships, four carriers, six heavy cruisers, four light cruisers, nine destroyers, and a host of planes were destroyed. &quot;Hazelwood&quot; herself accounted for at least two kamikazes destroyed.

===Leyte Gulf===
&quot;Hazelwood&quot; engaged in patrols off Leyte Gulf and gunnery and training exercises out of Ulithi during December. She then joined Vice Admiral McCain&#x27;s fast carrier strike force and sailed 30 December. Carrying the war home to the enemy, the carriers launched heavy air raids against Japanese positions in the Ryukyu Islands, Taiwan, Okinawa, and along the China coast 3–7 January 1945. These devastating strikes also diverted Japanese attention from the Philippines, where landings were made at Lingayen Gulf 9 January. After further strikes on Japanese positions in Indochina, the hard-hitting force returned to Ulithi 26 January.

===Japan and Iwo Jima===
Joining another fast and mobile carrier task force, &quot;Hazelwood&quot; sortied 11 February to protect carriers as they launched heavy air strikes against the Japanese home islands 16 and 17 February. Swiftly shifting positions as only sea-based power can, the fleet then sped south to provide support for the landings on Iwo Jima, begun 19 February. Although under constant attack from kamikazes as well as fighters and dive-bombers, &quot;Hazelwood&quot; came through the invasion untouched and on the night of 25 February sank two small enemy freighters with her guns.

===Okinawa===
Returning to Ulithi 1 March, the battle-tried destroyer sailed again for action 14 March with a fast carrier force to provide air cover and shore bombardment for the invasion of Okinawa, last step before invasion of the Japanese home islands. After the invasion 1 April, &quot;Hazelwood&quot; operated off Okinawa on radar picket and escort patrols through intense Japanese air attacks. On 29 April, the carrier group she was shepherding was attacked by kamikazes who dove out of low cloud cover.

&quot;Hazelwood&quot;, all guns blazing, maneuvered to avoid two of the Zeros. A third screamed out of the clouds from astern. Although hit by &quot;Hazelwood&quot;’s fire, the enemy plane careened past the superstructure. It hit #2 stack on the port side, smashed into the bridge, and exploded. Flaming gasoline spilled over the decks and bulkheads as the mast toppled and the forward guns were put out of action. Ten officers and 67 men were killed, including the Commanding Officer, Cmdr. V. P. Douw, and 36 were missing. &quot;Hazelwood&quot;’s engineering officer, Lt. (j.g.) C. M. Locke, took command and directed her crew in fighting the damage and aiding wounded. Proceeding by tow and part way under her own power, the gallant ship reached Ulithi 5 May for temporary repairs, then sailed to Mare Island Naval Shipyard via Pearl Harbor 14 June for permanent repairs. &quot;Hazelwood&quot; decommissioned 18 January 1946 and entered the Pacific Reserve Fleet at San Diego, California.

==Post War service==

&quot;Hazelwood&quot; recommissioned at San Diego 12 September 1951 to participate in the Korean War. After shakedown she departed San Diego 4 January 1952, and reached Newport, Rhode Island, 21 January to join Destroyer Forces, Atlantic Fleet. Operations and exercises along the East Coast and in the Caribbean, as well as hunter-killer training with carrier groups, occupied &quot;Hazelwood&quot; until she departed Newport for the Far East 7 December 1953.

She reached Tokyo 12 January 1954, via Pearl Harbor and spent the next few months operating with a fast carrier task force and patrolling along the Korean coast to enforce an uneasy armistice. The far-ranging destroyer returned to the States the long way, departing Hong Kong 28 May 1954 and sailing through the Suez Canal to reach Newport 17 July.

During the next few years, &quot;Hazelwood&quot; maintained a pattern of training and readiness operations along the East Coast and in the Caribbean interspersed with deployments to the Mediterranean. During the Suez Crisis in the fall of 1956 she served with the mighty 6th Fleet, patrolling the eastern Mediterranean and helping to stabilize a tense international situation.

In 1958, &quot;Hazelwood&quot; began extensive testing of helicopters for antisubmarine warfare both in Narragansett Bay and out of the Naval Ordnance Laboratory in Maryland. Assigned to the Destroyer Development Division, she participated in tests on equipment used with radar and electronic counter-measure systems. Her primary research and development work involved the testing of the Drone Anti-Submarine Helicopter (DASH). &quot;Hazelwood&quot; provided on board testing facilities, and helped make possible the perfection of DASH, an advanced and vital ASW weapons system. In August 1963 alone, the drone helicopter made 1,000 landings on the versatile destroyer&#x27;s flight deck.

In addition to experimental developments, &quot;Hazelwood&quot; continued to engage in the many duties assigned to a destroyer. As America confronted Russia over the introduction of offensive missiles into Cuba in October 1962, she steamed again to the troubled Caribbean for antisubmarine and surveillance patrols. &quot;Hazelwood&quot; arrived Guantanamo Naval Base 5 November, just after the quarantine of Cuba had gone into effect and remained on guard during the crisis, serving as a Gun Fire Support Ship for Task Force 84. When the nuclear submarine &quot;Thresher&quot; failed to surface 10 April 1963, &quot;Hazelwood&quot; immediately deployed to the scene of the tragedy with scientists from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution to begin a systematic search for the missing ship.

&quot;Hazelwood&quot; resumed testing of DASH during June and later in the year conducted on board trials of the Shipboard Landing Assist Device (SLAD). She continued both developmental and tactical operations along the East Coast during the next year. She decommissioned 19 March 1965, and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. &quot;Hazelwood&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register 1 December 1974 and sold 14 April 1976.

==Honors==
&quot;Hazelwood&quot; received 10 battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Wilson Boit Kipketer (born 6 October 1973 in Kenya) is a middle and long distance athlete most widely known for running the 3000 m steeplechase. On 13 August 1997, at the Weltklasse Zürich, he set the world record in the steeplechase at 7:59.08, the third of three world records set in a 70-minute period of time. He was second individual after Moses Kiptanui to run under eight minutes. Boit Kipketer&#x27;s record only stood for 11 days before it was crushed by Bernard Barmasai who took almost seconds off the mark. A week earlier, Boit Kipketer led a Kenyan sweep of the same race in the 1997 World Championships, edging out Barmasai and then world record holder, three-time defending champion Kiptanui. He came back two years later to claim a silver medal in the 1999 World Championships and the following year in the 2000 Olympics.

He was born into a large family, one of twelve children.

In 2003, during an immigration clampdown by the Swedish authorities, Boit Kipketer was refused permission to run in Stockholm where the event organisers had lined him up as one of the main attractions, because he did not have the required visa.

He planned to debut in marathon at the Düsseldorf Marathon on 6 May 2007.

He is not related to Wilson Kipketer, the 800 m runner who represented Denmark and was also part of the three world records set in 70 minutes in Zurich. Both attended St. Patrick&#x27;s High School at the same time.

==Politics==
After his competitive career, Kipketer went into local politics as a member of the county assembly of the Kabiemit Ward.

<text>Eduard Čech (; 29 June 1893 – 15 March 1960) was a Czech mathematician. His research interests included projective differential geometry and topology. He is especially known for the technique known as Stone–Čech compactification (in topology) and the notion of Čech cohomology. He was the first to publish a proof of Tychonoff&#x27;s theorem in 1937.

==Biography==
He was born in Stračov, then in Bohemia, Austria-Hungary, now in the Czech Republic. His father was Čeněk Čech, a policeman, and his mother was Anna Kleplová.

After attending the gymnasium in Hradec Králové, Čech was admitted to the Philosophy Faculty of Charles University of Prague in 1912. In 1915 he was drafted into the Austro-Hungarian Army and participated in World War I, after which he completed his undergraduate degree in 1918. He received his doctoral degree in 1920 at Charles University; his thesis, titled &quot;On Curves and Plane Elements of the Third Order&quot;, was written under the direction of Karel Petr. In 1921–1922 he collaborated with Guido Fubini in Turin, Italy. He taught at Masaryk University in Brno and at Charles University. Ivo Babuška, Vlastimil Dlab, Zdeněk Frolík, Věra Trnková, and Petr Vopěnka have been doctoral students of Čech.

He attended the First International Topological Conference held in Moscow 4–10 September 1935. He made two presentations there: &quot;Accessibility and homology&quot; and &quot;Betti groups with different coefficient groups&quot;.

He died in Prague in 1960.

<doc id="859838" wikidata="Q6016713" url="?curid=859838" title="Independent Labour Party (Manitoba, 1920)">
<text>The Independent Labour Party was the leading social-democratic party in the Canadian province of Manitoba prior to the emergence of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation. Several of its candidates were elected to the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba and it counted federal Members of Parliament J. S. Woodsworth and A. A. Heaps among its members.

The ILP was founded in December 1920 by disgruntled members of the Dominion Labour Party, who left that organization when it was taken over by rightist elements. Like the DLP, the ILP was a reformist labour group, and often had hostile relations with parties further to the left. In the provincial election of 1920, the combined efforts of reformist labourites and socialists resulted in eleven leftists being elected to the Manitoba legislature. Most of these Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs), including parliamentary leader Fred Dixon, were part of the exodus from the DLP to the ILP later in the year.

The ILP took six seats in the election of 1922, and Dixon resigned from the legislature in 1923 following a family tragedy. He was replaced as party leader by John Queen, formerly of the Social Democratic Party of Canada. Support for left-wing and labour parties declined throughout Canada in the late 1920s. Queen led the ILP through the elections of 1927, winning three seats.

The party&#x27;s fortunes improved during the Depression, and the ILP took five seats in 1932. Seymour Farmer became leader of the ILP in 1935.

The ILP never affiliated with the Canadian Labour Party. Initially, this was because the rightist DLP leadership had affiliated itself with the CLP soon after the exodus of ILP members. There were attempts at a compromise, but divisions between DLP and ILP members were too strong to overcome and the ILP refused to join the &quot;national&quot; organization as such. Later, the ILP would remain out of the CLP due to the large number of communists who joined the latter group in the 1920s. (The CLP was, in any case, a fairly weak organization in Manitoba, and the ILP leaders had little incentive to merge with their smaller rival.)

The ILP had a complicated relationship with the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) in the 1930s. The CCF was formed in 1932 to expand the parliamentary left&#x27;s support base beyond the urban working class, and many in the ILP were suspicious of this. The parties nevertheless became aligned in 1933, at a time when the CCF organization in the province was weak. In three years, the CCF had developed its own identity and was less willing to support the ILP&#x27;s demands for autonomy.

The party was referred to as &quot;ILP-CCF&quot; during the provincial election of 1936, against the opposition of some traditional ILP supporters. Following the election (in which the party won seven seats), a group of disgruntled ILP members succeeded in temporarily disaffiliating the parties. Pressure from David Lewis and J. S. Woodsworth brought about a realignment, but the ILP&#x27;s relationship with the CCF remained shakey until the early 1940s, when CCF loyalists took over the ILP&#x27;s internal organization. These divisions were especially noticeable at the start of the Second World War: the ILP supported an all-out war effort, whereas the CCF favoured conscription of &quot;wealth before men&quot;.

The ILP organization officially disbanded in 1943. It had been superseded by the CCF some time earlier.

==Party leaders==

# Fred Dixon 1921–1923
# John Queen 1923–1935
# Seymour Farmer 1935–1943

All leaders were selected by party caucus, seemingly without opposition.

<text>Chaponost () is a commune in the Rhône department in eastern France.

It is known for its Roman aqueducts.

==Monuments==

The Roman aqueduct of the Gier, estimated to be 75 km long, was built under Hadrian&#x27;s reign during the second century CE to enable water supply of the Roman city of Lugdunum (Lyon) from Mont Pilat (source of the river Gier). Arches of the aqueducts (around 92 arches on 550 m) are located on the territory of the commune, at the site of &quot;Le Plat de l&#x27;Air&quot;.

<text>The BAC Jet Provost is a British jet trainer aircraft that was in use with the Royal Air Force (RAF) from 1955 to 1993. It was originally developed by Hunting Percival from the earlier piston engine-powered Percival Provost basic trainer, and later produced by the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC). In addition to the multiple RAF orders, the Jet Provost, sometimes with light armament, was exported to many air forces worldwide. The design was also further developed into a more heavily armed ground attack variant under the name BAC Strikemaster.

== Development ==
===Origins===
In early 1951, Hunting Percival began work on the design studies that would ultimately lead to the Jet Provost. At the time, the company was in the process of establishing mass production for the earlier piston-engined Percival Provost basic trainer, but had anticipated that demand for a jet-powered trainer aircraft would be on the horizon. The design team aimed to produce an aircraft capable of equalling the handling characteristics of operational jet fighters of the era while also possessing modest approach and stall speeds and remaining simple to handle, as opposed to aiming to obtain maximum performance.
During the early design process, a series of increasingly frequent liaisons with RAF Flying Training Command took place, helping to gauge the considerations required to succeed in aspects of the proposed aircraft&#x27;s design, such as instructional processes and maintenance requirements. During development, Hunting Percival had intentionally reused as many existing components and subsystems of the Percival Provost as possible, including the tail surfaces, main planes and main undercarriage legs, to speed development through to the prototype stage. The initial design work was performed as a private venture, independent of any service requirement; in March 1953, sponsorship from the British Government to support the development was made available as a result of interest from the Ministry of Supply. That same month, an order for service-test quantity of Jet Provosts was received.

===Prototypes and evaluation===
On 26 June 1954, the prototype &quot;XD674&quot; conducted its maiden flight from the factory at Luton Airport, flown by Dick Wheldon. A series of seven flights were flown in quick succession over the following three days. By early November 1954, a total of 123 flying hours had been accumulated by the prototype during Hunting Percival&#x27;s own flight test program, after which the prototype was submitted for official trials at RAF Boscombe Down. While testing proved the overall performance of the Jet Provost to be satisfactory, refinements were made, such as shortening the legs of the landing gear for a smoother ride when deployed at semi-prepared airstrips.

On 19 February 1955, the first of ten pre-production aircraft, designated as the &quot;Jet Provost T1&quot;, performed its first flight. In May 1955, three of the pre-production aircraft were assigned for the first stage of service trials with the Central Flying School (CFS) of the RAF to determine the value of the Jet Provost in the &quot;ab initio&quot; training role and to develop a syllabus for the training program. During the second stage of CFS trials using the same three aircraft, actual students were introduced to the type for practical evaluation purposes, which was performed at RAF Hullavington until the successful completion of trials on 2 July 1956. According to feedback from CFS examiners, the Jet Provost had noticeably improved the performance of students during its trial deployment.

===Further development===
As a result of the results and responses produced from the trials performed using the pre-production aircraft, Hunting Percival proceeded to develop and incorporate several different improvements upon the design. Amongst the changes made was an overall smoothing of the fuselage lines, hydraulic systems being substituted for pneumatic counterparts, and the addition of a dorsal fillet; the new model was designated as the &quot;Jet Provost T2&quot;. On 1 September 1955, the first Jet Provost T2 made its first flight. This variant was used only for development work; in addition to seeing use at Hullavington, three Jet Provost T2s were dispatched overseas for winterization trials in Scandinavia and a series of sales tours across Europe, Canada, the United States of America, and Latin America.
In June 1957, a production order was placed for the first 40 of the developed &quot;Jet Provost T3&quot;, featuring a more powerful Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engine, ejector seats, a redesign of the airframe, and a shortened and strengthened version of the retractable tricycle undercarriage. Percival built a single example, which was used purely for structural tests throughout the development stages, giving the designers valuable research into what could be achieved with the basic design. On 22 June 1958, the first Jet Provost T.3 conducted its first flight. In total, 201 T3s were delivered between 1958 and 1962.

The &quot;T4&quot; followed in 1960, fitted with a more powerful variant of the Viper engine and first flown on 15 July, and this was followed by the pressurised &quot;T5&quot; in 1967. The &quot;T51&quot; was an armed export version, sold to Ceylon (present day Sri Lanka), Kuwait and Sudan. It was armed with two 7.7-mm (0.303-inch) machine guns. The &quot;T52&quot; was another export version sold to Iraq, South Yemen, Sudan and Venezuela, with the same armament as the T51. The &quot;T55&quot; was the final armed export version which was sold to Sudan. A more heavily armed variant of the airframe was developed as the BAC Strikemaster.

==Design==
The BAC Jet Provost is a dedicated jet-powered trainer aircraft; according to aviation publication &quot;Flight International&quot;, it has the distinction of being the first &quot;ab initio&quot; jet trainer to be standardised by any air force. As designed, it was intended for the Jet Provost to replace, rather than accompany, the use of piston-engine trainer aircraft. The Jet Provost incorporates numerous features to support students during training. The aerodynamic design deliberately avoids speed, instead focusing on favourable handling characteristics and ease of recovery from stall and spin conditions. An emphasis was placed on flexibility, enabling use of the type throughout a range of training operations.

The cockpit of the Jet Provost, and much of the operational equipment fittings, is essentially identical to that of the preceding Percival Provost. It features a side-by-side seating arrangement, both positions being fitted with duplicated flight controls and instrumentation, which is well suited to the pupil-instructor pairing. The dual flight controls employs conventional manually-controlled flight control surfaces via a cable-and-tie rod arrangement. A key feature for the era amongst the fittings in the cockpit is the Centralized Warning Panel, which alerts the pilots in the event of a number of unfavourable or hazardous conditions being detected, such as icing conditions, fire, and oxygen failure. The high-flying capabilities of the Jet Provost necessitated the addition of an oxygen system in the cockpit, which was unpressurised on early production aircraft.

The Jet Provost has an uncomplicated structure, the airframe being based on the Percival Provost, albeit being strengthened in key areas such as the main wing spar and featuring a substantially different undercarriage arrangement. It possesses an all-metal stressed-skin fuselage built in two sections, the forward section stretching from the rear of the engine bay to the nose comprises a double-frame to absorb the wing and engine loads, while the rear fuselage section uses an orthodox semi-monocoque structure. Major loads across the fuselage are supported by a combination of four longerons and a single longitudinal beam across the upper-center line. The ailerons, elevators, and rudder are all attached to the airframe via two inset hinges each. The nose contains a hinged metal assembly, housing the radio, batteries, and other electronic equipment, and is easily serviceable by ground crew. All fuel tankage is housed within the wings. Where possible, all components used were designed to maximized interchangeability and to conform with international standardisation; a total of 49 service panels across the aircraft&#x27;s exterior provides access for maintenance and servicing.

The Jet Provost is equipped with a single Armstrong Siddeley Viper 101 turbojet engine, which is mounted behind the cockpit in a roomy stainless steel-lined engine bay upon a secondary steel-tube structure. Air is fed to the engine by a pair of ram-air intakes set on either side of the aircraft&#x27;s forward fuselage connected via sharply-curving ducts to converge just forward of the engine itself. As supplied, each engine is delivered as a compact engine-change unit, comprising the engine itself, accessories, and oil tank. Both the hydraulic and electrical systems were driven via a fuselage-mounted accessories gearbox connected to the Viper engine by a telescopic drive. One particularly favourable aspect of the Viper engine is the low maintenance demands imposed for the era. Engine ignition is achieved via an electric starter system, the engine controls have been described as being of a conventional nature.

== Operational service ==

The Jet Provost proved to be a capable trainer, being used in the &quot;ab initio&quot; Basic Trainer role from the outset (pilots progressed to the de Havilland Vampire and later the Folland Gnat for Advanced Jet Training).

After successful acceptance trials of the T1 during late 1955 at No. 2 Flying Training School at RAF Hullavington, the RAF formally accepted the type in 1957. The first production version was the T3, powered by the Viper 102, and this entered service with No. 2 FTS, located at RAF Syerston, during June 1959, when deliveries commenced from the Hunting Aircraft factory at Luton airport. The T3 was also operated by Central Flying School at RAF Little Rissington; the Royal Air Force College at RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire; by No. 1 Flying Training School at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, Yorkshire; 3FTS at RAF Leeming, Yorkshire; 6FTS at RAF Acklington, Northumberland; and 7FTS at RAF Church Fenton, Yorkshire. The twin-seated side by side variant was also used at RAF Brawdy in Wales to train Forward Air Controllers.

The later T4 was fitted with the more powerful Viper A.S.V. 11 of 2,500 lbs static thrust and first flew on 15 July 1960. It quickly entered service with the units listed above.

The T5 variant was fitted with the Viper 201 and cockpit pressurisation. These developments encouraged the RAF to utilise the Jet Provost in a number of different roles besides basic training. With a top speed of 440 mph, excellent maneuverability, mechanical reliability and low operating costs, the Jet Provost was utilized as an aerobatic aircraft, air warfare and tactical weapons training as well as advanced training. The first T5 made its maiden flight on 28 February 1967 and deliveries from BAC″s Warton factory commenced on 3 September 1969. Operators of the T5 included the RAFs Central Flying School and No. 1, No. 3 and No. 6 Flying Training Schools.
Besides service with the RAF, the Jet Provost found success in export markets. A single Jet Provost T2 was exported to Australia and was operated by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) to evaluate the type for the purpose of providing &#x27;all-through&#x27; jet-based training. Following a six-month evaluation period, the RAAF ultimately decided to retain the de Havilland Vampire to fulfill its requirements for a jet-powered trainer, and later replaced its Vampires with the Italian-built Aermacchi MB-326 during the late 1960s instead. The sole aircraft itself was retained, being presented to the Sydney Technical College for use as an instructional airframe, and was later preserved.

Ceylon ordered 12 Jet Provost T51, these went into operational service in early 1960, one crashed in February 1960 following a flame out. The Provost were meant for pilot conversions for jets and intended as a stepping stone to introduce jet fighters to the Royal Ceylon Air Force (RCyAF). However these plans were scrapped due to defense cuts following the attempted coup in 1962 and by the late 1960s the remaining Provosts were mothballed. With the outbreak of the 1971 JVP insurrection in April 1971, the RCyAF took out its mothballed Provosts and started a crash program to bring these to operational readiness in three days. These Provost carried out ground attack sorties on insurgent targets, vectored in by helicopters that used smoke bombs to mark targets for Provosts. One Provost crashed returning from a sortie and its pilot killed.

Nigeria acquired two ex-Sudan Air Force Jet Provost T.51s in 1967, using them for training and ground attack purposes against Biafra during the Nigerian Civil War. Flown both by Nigeran and mercenary pilots, they proved effective as in both roles, but efforts to obtain more Jet Provosts directly from Britain failed.
The Jet Provost was withdrawn from RAF service during the early 1990s, having been replaced by the newer turboprop-powered Short Tucano. &quot;Ab initio&quot; training had reverted to piston-engined aircraft in the early 1970s, using the Scottish Aviation Bulldog.

The Jet Provost remains popular among private operators and enthusiasts; being an inexpensive jet, many have been acquired and maintained in a flightworthy condition by collectors and private individuals. Some are flown at airshows, whilst roughly equal numbers are maintained in ground-runnable condition at various locations, many of these being in the United Kingdom.

<text>G-8 was a heroic aviator and spy during World War I in pulp fiction. He starred in his own title &quot;G-8 and His Battle Aces&quot;, published by Popular Publications. All stories were written by Robert J. Hogan, under his own name. The title lasted 110 issues, from October 1933 to June 1944. Many of the novels have been reprinted by a wide range of publishers including comic books.

While not as dramatic a pulp character as Doc Savage or the Shadow, his stories were often outlandish, with many supernatural or science fiction elements. G-8&#x27;s true identity was never revealed. He had a girlfriend, a nurse who aided his group, and her name as well was never revealed. His English manservant was named Battle. His wing-men were the short Nippy Weston, who flew an aircraft numbered 13, and the tall and muscular but superstitious Bull Martin, whose aircraft was numbered 7. Both of them were Americans. His adventures entailed fighting against the lethal super technology that was constantly created by the Kaiser&#x27;s mad scientists. Reoccurring villains included Herr Doktor Krueger, the Steel Mask, and Grun.

A character based on G-8 made two appearances in the comic book &quot;Planetary&quot; alongside many other pulp analogues as part of a society for the betterment of humankind.

==Reprints==

During the craze for hero pulp reprints in the 1970s started by the success of Doc Savage reprints, Berkley Books reprinted 8 G-8 novels. The first 3 had covers by Jim Steranko and a logo inspired by Doc Savage&#x27;s. After that, the covers reprinted the original pulp covers.

In more recent years, some G-8 novels were reprinted by small presses like Adventure House. Adventure House recently started a reprint series of G-8 in similar size to the original pulps, including covers and interior artwork. So far, they have reprinted over 40 issues.

<doc id="859845" wikidata="Q1123896" url="?curid=859845" title="True Love (video game)">
<text>, better known simply as True Love, is a Japanese erotic visual novel dating simulation game developed by Software House Parsley and published by CD Bros., released on June 9, 1995, for the PC-98 and on December 6, 1996, for Windows. It was localized in Europe by Otaku Publishing and distributed in North America by JAST USA in January 1999.

==Gameplay==

Unlike traditional, even modern visual novels, which are characteristically uninvolved beyond the periodic decision to make, &quot;True Love&quot; incorporates elements reminiscent of a role-playing game.

The game is played through a series of virtual days, consecutively spanning three months. At the start of each morning, players designate an activity to pursue for evening, night, and in the case of weekends or vacation, daytime: studying, practicing art, exercising, grooming, recreation, taking a break, going to work, shopping or fulfilling a promise. Each choice affects the overall being of the player at the conclusion of the day, and points are distributed among stats for passion, appearance, fatigue, scholarship, strength and art. Depending on the level of these stats, and the order of schedules made during particular days, the player will shift their romantic focus and possibly trigger nonlinear events and encounters over time. In addition, working generates income and shopping allows the player to voluntarily spend their money on items for themselves or to give as gifts.

==Plot==

The main character is a single, nineteen-year-old Japanese college senior living in the fictional city of Meiai, forced out by his parents at the idea that independence may attract him a partner. On top of his quest to find a girlfriend, he is also indecisive about what direction to go in his academics. The player can choose any name for the character (the default name is Daisuke).

==Characters==

;Mikae Morikawa
:The player&#x27;s childhood friend who met him in kindergarten; now an adolescent co-ed attending the same college as him with a less than platonic eye. Although she can be meddlesome, Mikae is the most down-to-earth, well-rounded of girls to court with no overall preferences.

;Kazuhiko Miyoshi
:The player&#x27;s closest if not best friend. He enjoys video games and is quite knowledgeable, especially about the girls who populate the college. He has a younger sister named Arisa.

;Chiemi Fujimoto
:The second girl to encounter. She is the captain of the girls swim team. Athletic to the core, Chiemi is a robust, competitive, steadfast character with a love for exercise and a fear of caterpillars.

;Yumi Matsumiya
:One of the college&#x27;s professors, principally the player&#x27;s. With a history for low grades and procrastination, she takes deep concern for his academic development in her classes, counseling him to maintain his studies and do his homework. Single, and much to her confusion, she takes a more than comfortable attraction to him.

;Mayumi Kamijo
:A temperamental schoolmate the player bumps into on his way to campus and several times thereafter. Their beginning acquaintances are initially bitter and fierce but they gradually warm up to each other and become friends. Mayumi can be a handful with her habitually spitfire personality, however she is kind and sensitive. In spite of her alibis and defense, she can often be found wandering around sex shops downtown.

;Remi Himekawa
:The vice-president of the student council, often regarded as the most intellectually gifted of school. As the daughter of a multimillionaire business magnate, Remi carries herself with the utmost sophistication, spending most of her time studying in school or at the public library. She takes a genuine interest in the player when his intelligence rises and comes to find that she thoroughly enjoys being around him; a change from the otherwise posh lifestyle she&#x27;s grown bored of.

;Miyuki Tanaka
:A shy, soft-spoken girl who enjoys drawing, painting, and is a member of the art club. She is formally introduced to the player through Mikae and takes an interest in him when his concentration in art increases. Though anemic, feeble and sheltered, Miyuki comes to show a much more lecherous, unseen side to herself.

;Misako Sayama
:A voluptuous and enticing woman who is often found walking around the downtown city area at night. She is a nursing student living off-campus. Her first impression of the player is an endearing one, however frequent workouts and visits to her ultimately get her attention. Her father, a physician, operates the clinic at the player&#x27;s college and even visits as a fill-in nurse.

;Ryoko Shimazaki
:A renowned singer-songwriter known by the stage name Sonoko Takahashi. She transfers to Meiai later in the game and joins the player&#x27;s class, disguised with eyeglasses and new hairstyle, seeking to graduate from college and abandon her much popularized life. An orphan by extension of her parents death at childhood, Ryoko&#x27;s brother Tadaaki has since become her promoter and manager.

;Arisa Miyoshi
:Kazuhiko&#x27;s peppy younger sister, who at a year younger than him, does not look her age. She attends an all-girl&#x27;s college and takes a deep admiration for the player when he rescues her from drowning.

;Anze
:At first encounter, she seems like no more than an ordinary schoolgirl. It is revealed later on, however, that she is actually an angel from Heaven, sent down to Earth by God to retrieve a relic she dropped and lost. As part of her punishment, Anze transforms into a cat after ten days of searching, though this can be stagnated if the player finds the item himself.

;Akane
: A hidden character who was a girl from another dating simulation game by the same developer (Software House Parsley) called Venus from 1994. (One year prior to True Love&#x27;s debut)
==Reception==

&quot;True Love&quot;, by most accounts of the game&#x27;s history, was met with lackluster response in Japan. One reason cited for this is that &quot;True Love&quot; was the fourteenth release by Parsley, a company that had become known for mediocre quality titles at the time of release.

He starts working as a waiter in a membership restaurant, Platinum, where all the female employees wear Playboy bunny suits. Soon he finds out that the other waitresses, including his own cousin Sae Ishigami, have very unusual sexual tendencies.

The game features the original Japanese voices along with an English translation and is uncensored.

A sequel, &quot;Do You Like Horny Bunnies? 2&quot;, which is set in another branch of Platinum with cameos from the original&#x27;s characters, was also released in 2002.

==Gameplay==
At the beginning of the game, the player learns about Yukari Fujisawa&#x27;s life. If the player selects options that do not lead the protagonist to a specific possibility too many times, Yukari will get fired, and the player will be forced back to the title screen.

Sae Ishigami: Yukari&#x27;s cousin. In their childhood, they were inseparable, but they grew distant as the years went on. They are later reunited at Platinum. Sae is an exhibitionist and therefore enjoys being watched while performing sexual acts.

Hiromi Yanagi: Sae&#x27;s best pal appears to be probable to work in a bunny suit. She dresses complete with a pair of glasses and a stylish appearance. Luckily for her, she easily opens up to Yukari.

Ryo Kugenuma: Despite the fact that she is the youngest of the team, she is by far the most mature. Her serious attitude comes from her parents. Although she would seem more fitting as an executive of a major company and not a waitress in a bunny suit, she is still proud of her work at Platinum. Ryo enjoys consuming the sperm of her partner.

Chimaki Hase: The eldest of the bunnies at Platinum, despite looking young and immature. She has no shame in meeting Yukari. It is shown that Chimaki is addicted to Yukari.

<text>André Ouellet (), (born April 6, 1939) is a former longtime Liberal federal politician and Cabinet member in Canada. Following his political career, he served as chairman of Canada Post.

First elected to the House of Commons of Canada in a 1967 by-election, Ouellet served in a number of different positions in the cabinets of Prime Ministers Pierre Trudeau and Jean Chrétien. In his capacity as Registrar General of Canada, he was one of the four signatories of the (along with Queen Elizabeth II, Prime Minister Trudeau, and Justice Minister Jean Chrétien). Ouellet represented the safe Liberal seat of Papineau in Montreal for almost thirty years. His hold on the seat was only seriously threatened when the Liberals were crushed by the Progressive Conservative Party in the election of 1984, when he retained his seat by only 500 votes. In opposition, Ouellet became the Liberal&#x27;s leading figure in the constitutional negotiations that led to the Charlottetown Accord, and was a strong advocate for the constitutional reform proposal, which was rejected in a 1992 referendum.

With the return to power of the Liberals after the 1993 election, Ouellet was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs by the new prime minister, Jean Chrétien. Ouellet was seen as lacking experience in international relations but was a principled and pragmatic Minister of Foreign Affairs. Despite his experience, Ouellet was not popular in Quebec, and the lasting legacy of the Charlottetown Accord hurt him. After the close result of the 1995 Quebec referendum, Chrétien wanted to present a new face of his government in Quebec. In 1996, Chrétien appointed Ouellet to head the Canada Post Corporation. Ouellet&#x27;s seat in the House of Commons of Canada was taken by Pierre Pettigrew in a by-election later that year.

As cabinet minister, Ouellet had served as Postmaster General. As chairman of Canada Post, he implemented reform that led to record profits in the corporation. In 2004, controversy surrounded Ouellet as Canada Post was one of the organizations embroiled in the Sponsorship Scandal. As a result, Ouellet was suspended from his position at Canada Post in February 2004 by Prime Minister Paul Martin. He resigned as chairman of Canada Post on August 12, 2004, after it was revealed he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on personal expenses and that he handed out an untendered contract.

<text>Sarah Joy Brown, sometimes credited simply as Sarah Brown (born February 18, 1975), is an American actress. She is perhaps best known for originating the role of Carly Corinthos on the American daytime drama &quot;General Hospital&quot; from 1996 to 2001. For the role, she won three Daytime Emmy Awards. In 2008, she returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; in a different role, Claudia Zacchara. She exited &quot;General Hospital&quot; once again in 2009 and began appearing on &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot; in the newly created role of Aggie Jones.

Brown appeared as Madison James on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; from October 2011 until the character&#x27;s death in August 2012.

==Early life and career==
Brown was born in Eureka, California to parents David and Pamela Brown. She attended the Los Angeles County High School for the Arts as a theatre major. Her acting career began at the age of 19, when she was cast as Kaitlin Star on Saban&#x27;s syndicated action adventure science fantasy series &quot;VR Troopers&quot;. 

In 1996, she made a guest appearance in a 3-part episode of &quot;Power Rangers Zeo&quot; playing Heather Thompson, a girl who has a crush on the Red Ranger&#x27;s secret identity, Tommy Oliver, but it never led anywhere. An article in FOX Kids Magazine claimed a member of the &quot;VR Troopers&quot; cast would be quitting the series to become a part of the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; cast; however, the aforementioned &quot;Zeo&quot; three-parter and Brad Hawkins voicing the Gold Ranger prior to the return of Austin St. John as Jason Lee Scott is the closest anything like this ever came to happening.

In April 1996, Brown originated the role Carly Corinthos on the American ABC soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot;. 

Brown &quot;quickly became an overnight sensation&quot; and received three Daytime Emmy Awards for her portrayal of Carly. She won for Outstanding Younger Actress in 1997 and 1998, was nominated in 1999, and won again for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 2000. 

In 2010, she received her first Daytime Emmy nomination in the Lead Actress category for her work as Claudia Zacchara. Brown appeared on the cover of &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; 19 times during her run in the role, and won two &quot;Soap Opera Digest&quot; Awards in 1998 (Younger Lead Actress) and 2000 (Favorite Actress). She departed the series in April 2001.

After leaving &quot;General Hospital&quot;, Brown guest-starred on several television series, including &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;, &quot;Strong Medicine&quot; and &quot;Without a Trace&quot;. She returned to daytime in the role of Julia Morrisey Larrabee on &quot;As the World Turns&quot; from August 2004 to March 2005, in which she appeared in 109 episodes. In 2004, Brown played the lead role of Kate Vignatti in the fact-based television movie &quot;The Perfect Husband: The Laci Peterson Story&quot;. She became a regular on the popular CBS crime drama &quot;Cold Case&quot; in the fall of 2005 but was let go after only a few months (she appeared in five episodes) with the series. In 2006, she starred in her first feature film, the comedy, &quot;Big Momma&#x27;s House 2&quot; and appeared in an episode of &quot;Monk&quot; the same year. Brown was also seen in the third season episode 12 of &quot;The Closer&quot; and on a 2007 episode of the Fox police drama &quot;K-Ville&quot;.

Brown returned to &quot;General Hospital&quot; on January 31, 2008, in the role of Claudia Zacchara. She announced on her Twitter September 16, 2009 that she would be leaving &quot;General Hospital&quot; in mid October 2009. Brown also announced on her Twitter account that she would be making an appearance on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Castle&quot;.

In 2011, she had a supporting role in a Tracy J Trost film entitled &quot;The Lamp (All Things are Possible If You Just Believe)&quot;. It is based on a novel by Jim Stovall. In July 2011, numerous soap outlets confirmed that Brown would join the cast of &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot; as Madison James, a successful business woman. Her first appearance was October 4, 2011. In April 2012, it was announced that Brown had been let go from the series along with many other cast members.

In 2014, Brown played Massachusetts State Representative Katherine &quot;Kate&quot; Wesley in the soap opera web series &quot;Beacon Hill&quot;. She was nominated for a 2015 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Performer in a New Approaches Drama Series, and won a 2015 Indie Series Award for Best Lead Actress (Drama) for the role.

==Personal life==
Brown is a practicing convert to Judaism. She has one daughter, Jordan Alexandra Judith Levy (b. July 20, 1998), whose father is Brown&#x27;s ex-fiancé, Israeli composer Shuki Levy (a former executive producer on &quot;VR Troopers&quot; and the &quot;Power Rangers&quot; franchise).

Brown has been diagnosed with Coeliac disease.

<text>Gavriil Loginovich Pribylov (; first name also spelled Gavriel, Gerasim or Gerassim, last name also spelled Pribilof) (died 1796) was a Russian navigator who discovered the Bering Sea islands of St. George Island and St. Paul Island in 1786 and 1787. The islands, and surrounding small islets, now bear his name, being known as the Pribilof Islands.

Pribylov was commander of the Russian American Company ship &quot;St. George&quot; (&quot;Sv. Georgii Pobedonosets&quot;), a sloop or galiot, when he discovered St. George Island on June 25, 1786, by following the sounds of barking northern fur seals. Pribylov&#x27;s discovery successfully ended an active three-year search for the lucrative breeding grounds of fur seals by Siberian merchants. His expedition was funded jointly by Grigory Shelikhov and Pavel Lebedev-Lastochkin. Shelikhov controlled a monopoly on Aleutian fur-trading activities granted by Empress Catherine II of Russia, but often took on partners to help fund his activities; the two men would later become rivals.

More than 20 of Pribylov&#x27;s crew, which was of mixed Russian and Aleut descent, were left on St. George Island to hunt the seals. Both Russians and Aleuts stayed behind for the hunt. This played a key role in establishing the international hunting of northern fur seals, which continued in various forms until banned by international treaty in 1911, after nearly forcing the seals to extinction.

A year later in 1787, Pribylov discovered St. Paul Island, approximately 50 miles to the north of St. George.

In truth, Pribylov did not actually discover the islands, as he was directed to their approximate location by the son of an Aleut chief. The then-uninhabited islands, known to the Aleuts as &quot;Amiq&quot;, were a fabled hunting ground in Aleut oral tradition.

<doc id="859874" wikidata="Q3517863" url="?curid=859874" title="Knightmare Chess">
<text>Knightmare Chess is a fantasy chess variant published by Steve Jackson Games (SJG) in 1996. It is a translation of a French game Tempête sur l&#x27;échiquier (Storm on the Chessboard), designed by Pierre Cléquin and Bruno Faidutti. A stand-alone 80 card expansion called &quot;Series 2&quot; was scheduled for a December 1997 release.

==Overview==

&quot;Knightmare Chess&quot; is played with cards that change the default rules of chess. The cards might change how a piece moves, move opponent&#x27;s pieces, create special squares on the board or otherwise alter the game. For example, a card called Demotion says:

:Replace one of your opponent&#x27;s pieces (except a King or Queen) with one of his captured Pawns.
:&quot;Play this card on your turn, instead of making a regular move.&quot;

There are two sets of cards sold separately, each consisting of 80 cards. The sets are known as &quot;Knightmare Chess 1&quot; and &quot;Knightmare Chess 2&quot;; a single 160 card deck can be created by shuffling both decks together. SJG also sells blank cards, that can be customized by the player, in packs of 20.

The graphics in the English version of the &quot;Knightmare Chess&quot; cards are dark fantasy style, nightmarish (hence the pun &quot;Knightmare&quot;) color paintings by Brazilian artist Rogerio Vilela. The French original version had a cartoonish tone, unlike the English version, and the cards in the French original version are also different from the English version.

Another innovation of the American version is to include rules for &quot;dueling deck&quot; play, where each player has their own customized deck, possibly built from multiple copies of the set if desired. In SJG&#x27;s version, each card is marked with a point cost. The total chaotic power of one&#x27;s personal deck can be measured in the sum of the points of all cards in the deck. For a balanced game each player uses the same point total, or a stronger player can use a lower point total as a handicap. Cards which are too powerful to appear more than once per side are marked with an asterisk, indicating that a player can only put one copy of that specific card in their deck.

==Critical reaction==
Peter Sarrett of &quot;The Game Report&quot; called the game &quot;outstanding&quot;, remarking that it &quot;result[s] [in] an unpredictable game which removes the tedium of standard chess while preserving plenty of scope for strategic play,&quot; and praising the &quot;gorgeous&quot; paintings by Rogerio Vilela. Sarrett&#x27;s only complaints concerned the printing of the cards themselves, as he found the wording occasionally confusing and the text &quot;rather small, which makes it difficult for players with poorer eyesight to play the game.&quot;

Ken Tidwell of &quot;The Game Cabinet&quot; praised the game for including &quot;elements from both the strategic/predictable side of gaming and the wild/disorderly side&quot; and found the artwork &quot;striking&quot; and &quot;succeed[ing] in creating an air of comic horror.&quot; He concluded, &quot;If I had to find a fault with the game it is that there is no attempt to reconcile the strategic game with the chaotic game and the contrast is a bit jarring. Even so, at the end of the day it is a good game and one well worth checking out.&quot;

Conversely, Steve Darlington of &quot;RPGnet&quot;, while finding the artwork &quot;absolutely gorgeous&quot; and that &quot;in terms of sheer presentation ... [&quot;Knightmare Chess&quot;] is streets ahead of anything I&#x27;ve seen in years&quot;, felt that while the game itself &quot;might make for an interesting game or two, it&#x27;s not something you&#x27;ll be playing an awful lot.&quot; He said &quot;the dark design only conflicts with the abstract nature of the game, and ends up being more humorous than dramatic&quot; and that it &quot;ultimately doesn&#x27;t hold your attention for too long.&quot;

In Issue 11 of &quot;Arcane&quot;, Andy Butcher rated the game 7 out of 10, calling it &quot;an utterly bonkers game that&#x27;s best played every now and then. as a change from &quot;&quot;, roleplaying or whatever else you normally do.&quot;

<text>Methven is a small town in the Canterbury region of the South Island of New Zealand. It is located near the western edge of the Canterbury Plains, north of Ashburton and west of Christchurch, and at an elevation of . The town is a service centre for agriculture in the surrounding area, and is a base for skiing at the nearby Mount Hutt skifield. The town slogan is &quot;Amazing Space&quot;.
== History ==
In 1869, Robert Patton purchased a farm property and called it &quot;Methven&quot;, after the name of his old home town in Perthshire, Scotland. The name of the farm subsequently became the name of the town and surrounding district. Sections in the township were offered for sale by public auction on 24 June 1878 at South Rakaia, and sold for between 20 and 95 pounds.

In 1879, Robert Patton applied to the Ashburton Licensing Court for a license to operate a new house at Methven to be called the Methven Hotel. A hotel was built in 1880. In 1882, Patton applied to the Licensing District of Mount Hutt for a publican&#x27;s license for the 24 room Methven hotel. The Methven Branch railway line from Rakaia to Methven was completed in 1880. The terminus of the railway line was at the junction of six roads, in the centre of the town as it stands today. By 1882–83, further sections of land were sold around the area that would subsequently become the town of Methven. By the time that Robert Patton died on 20 October 1889, Methven had a butcher, baker, grocer, draper and a blacksmiths, in addition to the hotel. 

The Methven School was opened on 7 February 1882, with an opening school roll of 41. The Chairman of the School Committee was Robert Patton. The school remained as a Primary school, until secondary schooling was established in Methven in 1925.

A notable early farmer in the Methven district was Duncan Cameron. He was initially the manager of a large property called &quot;Springfield,&quot; employing 100 men through the year, and 200 during harvesting. Cameron became the owner of the &quot;Springfield&quot; property in 1890. He had in crops most years, and in one year had 5,500 acres in wheat. He was an early pioneer of irrigation in the district. By 1876, he had constructed of water races at &quot;Springfield&quot;, and this grew to by 1880. His use of irrigation enabled cropping and increased stock-carrying, and led the way for later investments in irrigation in the district. Cameron was also a pioneer for the frozen meat export industry. 

The Mount Hutt Road Board office was completed in 1879.  Despite the depression of the 1880s and 1890s, the Methven library was built in 1883. The Anglican church was built in 1880 and the Catholic church in 1888. The population of Methven town was 300 people in 1902. Methven contributed troops to the First World War with 69 of them losing their lives. In the 1920s Methven slowly changed from having livery stables and smithies to garages and engineering firms to service cars and farm machinery. The 1920s also saw the arrival in Methven of companies such as Dalgety&#x27;s and Wright Stevenson and Co. Trucking firms also aimed to compete with the railways to ship farm goods such as wool to the ports. Electricity also arrived around this time. The farm labourers who working on the local farms often resided in Methven or came to Methven to socialize after work. Farm labourers frequented the grocery stores, clothing retailer, pubs, billiard halls, brothels, and boarding houses that were present in Methven in the early days of the town. The Methven branch railway line closed in 1976.

For the first 100 years of Methven&#x27;s existence, its primary role was that of servicing the needs of farmers and farm labour.

Methven expanded dramatically in 2021 with over three hundred residential sections sold. This is expected to lead to an increase in the population to 2411 people by 2023. The population was expected to climb to this number in the year 2048 according to Ashburton District Council projections.

== Rural services centre ==

Methven is a rural service town that supports the local region. Dairy farming, sharecropping, sheep farming and seed production and distribution are major players in the farming industry around Methven. 

The Mount Hutt Memorial Hall (160 Main Street, Methven) contains the New Zealand Alpine &amp; Agriculture Encounter. It aims to provide an understanding of farming in the area.

Methven has an annual A &amp; P Show each year at the A &amp; P Show grounds in Methven. The 2020 A &amp; P show was cancelled due to the Covid-19 Lockdown in New Zealand.

== Ski town ==
In 1971, the Methven Lions Club studied whether Mount Hutt could be developed into a ski field. The study suggested that this was possible and it led to the opening of a skifield in 1973. Mount Hutt skifield is around half an hour away from Methven. Although the majority of skiers usually made the journey to Mount Hutt from Christchurch on a daily basis, some would stay the weekend in Methven and need accommodation, dinner and services. This led to the establishment of a number of hotels, motels, restaurants and other tourist activities being developed. The town centre was redeveloped with 14 new shops built in 1975. Development continued and by 1989 Methven had five hotels, three motels, twenty ski lodges, two camping grounds and nine restaurants.

During winter, Methven undergoes a significant transformation. A number of cafes, bars, and restaurants lie relatively dormant over the summer months, but become busy during the ski season. Similarly, the town&#x27;s accommodation providers have a strongly seasonal trade. The New Zealand Ski Heritage Museum was established in 2000. It is located in the Mount Hutt Memorial Hall (160 Main Street, Methven). It includes ski fashions, antique ski equipment and Winter Olympic memorabilia. Methven is also a base for heliskiing in the Arrowsmith range of mountains. The annual Peak to Pub race starts at the top of Mount Hutt where competitors ski two kilometres ski down the mountain to the car park. This is followed by an 18km mountain bike ride down the ski road, followed by a 12km run into Methven.

Methven tourism businesses have struggled in 2020 due to the Covid-19 virus. The Methven Resort Hotel, was placed into liquidation in June 2020. The hotel had a 100-seat restaurant, a large swimming pool and multiple spa pools.

== Other sport and recreation ==

In addition to skiing, horse riding is popular and there are a number of companies that offer horse treks in and around Methven. Hot air ballooning is also possible to do in Methven. The Methven i-SITE Visitor Centre is located at 160 Main Street, Methven. The Methven skatepark was opened in 2020. It sits in the centre of town in the reserve at Bank and McMillan Streets. Significant local fundraising efforts were required to make the skatepark a reality.

=== Walking and tramping ===
Walking and tramping in the hills and mountains surrounding Methven is a popular pastime. Local walks include:

==== Rakaia Gorge Walkway ====

<doc id="859878" wikidata="Q1808761" url="?curid=859878" title="Panharmonicon">
<text>The Panharmonicon was a musical instrument invented in 1805 by Johann Nepomuk Mälzel, a contemporary and friend of Beethoven. Beethoven composed his piece &quot;Wellington&#x27;s Victory&quot; (Op. 91) to be played on Mälzel&#x27;s mechanical orchestral organ and also to commemorate Arthur Wellesley&#x27;s victory over the French at the Battle of Vitoria in 1813. It was one of the first automatic playing machines, similar to the later Orchestrion.

The Panharmonicon could imitate many orchestral instruments as well as sounds like gunfire and cannon shots. One instrument was destroyed in the Landesgewerbemuseum in Stuttgart during an air raid in World War II. Friedrich Kaufmann copied this automatic playing machine in 1808, and his family produced Orchestrions from that time on.

One of Mälzel&#x27;s Panharmonicons was sent to Boston 1811 and was exhibited there and then in New York City and other cities.
Mälzel toured with this instrument in the United States from 7 February 1826, until his death in 1838.

In 1817 Flight &amp; Robson in London built a similar automatic instrument called Apollonicon, advised by the blind organist John Purkis, who had previously written and arranged music for the Panharmonicon. 
In 1821 Dietrich Nikolaus Winkel copied some features of the Panharmonicon in Amsterdam for his instrument, the Componium, which was also capable of aleatoric composition.
In 1823, William M. Goodrich copied Mälzel&#x27;s Panharmonicon in Boston, MA.

<text>Neville Southall (born 16 September 1958) is a Welsh football manager and former international footballer. He has been described as one of the best goalkeepers of his generation and won the FWA Footballer of the Year award in 1985.

He joined Bury from Winsford United for a £6,000 fee in 1980. He turned professional in his early 20s after several years as a semi-professional and amateur player. During his teenage years, he worked as a binman, waiter and hod carrier. He moved on to Everton for £150,000 in 1981 and established himself as the club&#x27;s first-choice goalkeeper by the 1983–84 season. He went on to make a club record 578 appearances in the English Football League and Premier League (750 in all competitions); his honours with the club consist of a European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup medal in 1985, a First Division championship medal in 1984–85 and 1986–87, an FA Cup winners medal in 1984 and 1995, and an FA Charity Shield winners medal in 1984, 1985, and 1995. He also played in the 1985 and 1989 FA Cup finals, the League Cup final in 1984, and helped Everton to a second place in the league in 1985–86. After leaving Everton in 1998, he became Torquay United&#x27;s regular goalkeeper for two years. He also made a handful of appearances for numerous other clubs.

Southall played internationally for Wales, winning 92 caps between 1982 and 1998, though he did not feature in any major international competitions. As an individual, he was named on the PFA Team of the Year four consecutive times. He was listed as one of the world&#x27;s top ten goalkeepers by the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics on four occasions. He is a member of the Gwladys Street&#x27;s Hall of Fame. He has been named as one of the 100 &#x27;Greatest Players of the 20th Century&#x27; by &quot;World Soccer&quot; magazine. In the 1996 Birthday Honours, he was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his services to football.

Since his retirement as a player, Southall has briefly managed Dover Athletic, Hastings United and Margate, and has coached at numerous clubs as well as the Welsh national youth teams. He has also worked extensively with disadvantaged children and established his own educational consultancy. In addition, Southall is also known for his political activism; he is an international officer for his branch of the UNISON trade union, endorsed Jeremy Corbyn for the 2017 UK general election, endorses LGBT rights, and has spoken at multiple events advocating for Welsh independence.

== Club career ==

=== Early years ===
Born and raised in Llandudno to Fred and Rose Southall, he was the middle child of three boys. Southall played youth football for his school team and the Llandudno Swifts, where he played alongside Joey Jones. He was educated at Ysgol John Bright, though left without any qualifications at age 16. At age 14, he toured Germany with the Llandudno Swifts and was offered a chance to play for the youth team of Bundesliga club Fortuna Düsseldorf, but decided against the move to Germany. The Swifts were a poor side that were regularly beaten heavily, though the near-constant barrage of shots he faced enabled Southall to improve on his shot-stopping skills.

As a teenager, Southall had unsuccessful trials at Wrexham, Crewe Alexandra and Bolton Wanderers. He aspired to be a postman, and never believed that he would make a living playing football. He then worked as a binman, waiter and hod carrier and therefore entered the game relatively late. He played for Llandudno Town at age 15, before joining Northern Premier League side Bangor City on £10 a week as a semi-professional the following year. Bangor manager Dave Elliott regularly selected veteran goalkeeper Peter Eales ahead of Southall. Everton asked Elliot permission to take Southall on trial, but Elliot left the club shortly after and no trial took place. With Bangor in financial trouble the paid playing staff began to leave the club, and Southall left Bangor and went on to accept an offer of £3 a week to play for Conwy United. He moved on to Cheshire County League club Winsford United at the age of 20. The club won the Cheshire Senior Cup in 1980, and Southall was voted the club&#x27;s Player of the Year.

=== Bury ===
Southall&#x27;s performances attracted the attention of Bury and Wigan Athletic, and he was convinced to sign with Bury after he was personally approached by manager Dave Connor. Bury paid Winsford £6,000 and would later pay another £25,000 after he was sold on. However, he never played for Connor as he was replaced by Jim Iley before the start of the 1980–81 season; despite this managerial change he was still seen as the future replacement to club stalwart John Forrest. He received specialist goalkeeping coaching from Wilf McGuinness. He made his first-team debut against Wigan Athletic on 20 September, in a 2–1 victory. The &quot;Shakers&quot; had an indifferent league campaign in the Fourth Division, though they managed to reach the Third Round of the FA Cup and beat Newcastle United in the League Cup. Southall kept 15 clean sheets after conceding 50 goals in his 44 domestic appearances, and was named as Bury&#x27;s Player of the Year and Young Player of the Year.

=== Everton ===
Southall was bought by Everton manager Howard Kendall for £150,000 in the summer of 1981. To win a first-team place he had to compete with Jim McDonagh (a Gordon Lee signing who would soon leave the club), Jim Arnold (also a new signing), and Martin Hodge (who was injured throughout his time at Everton). He made his debut in a 2–1 win over Ipswich Town in October after Arnold picked up an injury. He returned to the first-team in December, and he kept a clean sheet against Aston Villa and remained an ever-present throughout the rest of the 1981–82 season.

Kendall described Southall as the best goalkeeper in the First Division &quot;outside the big three&quot; of Ray Clemence, Peter Shilton and Joe Corrigan. However, he began to suffer from ulcerated toes, which gave him severely swollen feet and caused him pain and discomfort throughout matches. On 6 November 1982, he conceded five goals in a 5–0 defeat to Mersey rivals Liverpool at Goodison Park. Kendall then dropped Southall as part of a shake-up at the club. He spent January and February on loan at John McGrath&#x27;s Port Vale, and played nine Fourth Division games. McGrath was impressed and tried to take Southall to Vale Park permanently, but was rebuffed by Kendall. Back at Everton, he played the last four games of the 1982–83 season after Arnold picked up an injury.

Arnold was the preferred choice in goal at the start of the 1983–84 season before Southall was recalled on 1 October against Notts County. Everton had a poor start to the league campaign but excelled in cup competitions, reaching the final of both the League Cup and the FA Cup. Southall&#x27;s first appearance at Wembley was in the League Cup final against Liverpool, and he kept a clean sheet in a goalless draw. The replay was held at Maine Road, and Liverpool won the tie 1–0 with a Graeme Souness goal. He was rarely called into action in the 1984 FA Cup final and kept a clean sheet as Everton claimed the trophy with a 2–0 victory over Watford.

Southall kept a clean sheet at Wembley in the 1984 FA Charity Shield, as Everton beat Liverpool 1–0 to take home the first silverware of the 1984–85 season. They then lost the opening two league games of the season before losing only three of their next 37 league games to win the First Division title by a 13-point margin. Throughout the season, they beat Liverpool both at Anfield and at Goodison and recorded a 5–0 win over Manchester United. Southall made one particularly crucial save from a point-blank Mark Falco header in a 2–1 win over title chasers Tottenham Hotspur at White Hart Lane on 3 April. In the European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup, Everton beat UCD (Ireland), Inter Bratislava (Czechoslovakia), Fortuna Sittard (Netherlands), and Bayern Munich (Germany) in two-legged encounters. Southall conceded just one goal (from Dieter Hoeneß) throughout all eight matches. They then beat Austrian club Rapid Wien 3–1 in the final at De Kuip to win the first European title in the club&#x27;s history. Three days later, Everton played in the 1985 FA Cup final, but lost 1–0 to Manchester United after a Norman Whiteside goal in extra time. At the end of the season, Southall was named as the FWA Footballer of the Year, becoming the first Everton player, second Welshman and fourth goalkeeper to win the award.

Though Everton had won a place in the European Cup, English clubs were banned from European competitions following the Heysel Stadium disaster. Southall remained bitter, blaming UEFA for the tragedy and stating that the ban was a convenient way to break up English dominance of European competitions. Limited to domestic competitions, Everton won the FA Charity Shield with a 2–0 win over Manchester United; during the celebrations, Southall wore a T-shirt saying &quot;I Love My Wife&quot; as a symbolic gesture following tabloid stories of an alleged affair. After getting sent off against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in October, Kendall criticised Southall in the press by saying he &quot;let the lads down&quot;. Despite this setback, he agreed to sign a six-year contract in December, which was then the longest contract the club had ever issued. However, he twisted his ankle ligaments on international duty with ten league games left to play. In his absence, his deputy Bobby Mimms took his place, and Everton lost both the league title and the 1986 FA Cup final to Liverpool.

Sidelined through injury at the start of the 1986–87 season, he returned to the first-team against Watford in October. He was the club&#x27;s Player of the Month in February and won man of the match awards in wins over Arsenal and Chelsea as Everton claimed another league title. Comparing the two title wins (1985 and 1987), Southall said that the latter success was &quot;more rewarding and satisfying&quot; as it had proved to be &quot;more of a struggle&quot; compared to the ease in which the title was won in the former campaign.

After Kendall left Merseyside to coach Athletic Bilbao, his assistant Colin Harvey took charge at Goodison; Southall responded well to the change, as he believed Harvey &quot;understood my obsessive and relentless desire to be the best&quot;. Everton finished fourth in 1987–88, conceding a club record low of 27 goals in 40 league games, and reached the semi-finals of the League Cup. Southall had missed the opening stages of the season after undergoing knee surgery.

Harvey had failed to replace some of Everton&#x27;s departing star players adequately, and Southall noted how &quot;the mediocrity became habitual&quot; as the club coasted to an eighth-place finish in the 1988–89 season. He kept goal in the final of the Full Members Cup (a largely unsuccessful tournament inspired by the ban on European football), as Everton were beaten 4–3 by Nottingham Forest. More significantly, he kept goal against Liverpool in the 1989 FA Cup final after conceding only two goals in the seven games en route to the final. In an emotional match in the aftermath of the Hillsborough disaster in the semi-final encounter with Nottingham Forest, Liverpool won the cup with a 3–2 extra-time victory.

Everton were leading the division at the start of the 1989–90 season, but their title challenge fell away after a televised 6–2 defeat to Aston Villa. Southall was later told he needed surgery that would keep him out of action for eight months, but he instead sought out a back specialist who told him he had a &quot;bad back&quot; and found that the problem corrected itself.

Southall requested a transfer before the start of the 1990–91 season. He famously sat down during a &quot;sulking session&quot; against a goalpost at half-time of the season opener whilst his teammates were still in the changing rooms while two goals down to newly-promoted Leeds United (a game Everton eventually lost 3–2); Southall was fined two weeks wages despite denying it was a protest and that he did it to clear his head. He then received a phone call from Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. Still, Southall&#x27;s hostile phone manner put Ferguson off the idea of signing him, and Ferguson instead bought Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel. Howard Kendall returned as Everton manager in November, with Colin Harvey being demoted to his assistant, and led the club out of relegation trouble to secure a ninth-place finish. They also reached the final of the Full Members Cup at Wembley, losing 4–1 to Crystal Palace, though Southall refused to collect his runners-up medal as he did not value the competition.

Everton were a declining force and finished 12th in the league in 1991–92 whilst exiting both the FA Cup and League Cup in the Fourth Round. They then finished 13th in the 1992–93 season in the newly created Premier League, just four points above the relegation zone. Kendall resigned mid-way through the 1993–94 campaign and was replaced by Mike Walker – Southall later described Walker as a man who loved his suntan more than football. Walker oversaw a run of bad results, and Everton only escaped relegation with a final day victory over Wimbledon, winning 3–2 after turning round a 2–0 deficit. Southall saw that his teammates were reluctant to take a penalty in the match and so took the ball himself before Graham Stuart plucked up the courage to take the ball from him and convert the penalty.

Everton picked up four points from their opening 12 league games of the 1994–95 season. Southall received death threats after being confronted by an Everton fan during a match at Goodison Park. Walker was sacked and replaced by Joe Royle, who led the club to a 2–0 win over Liverpool in his first match in charge – this game also marked a record 35th Merseyside derby appearance for Southall. It was also the second match of seven consecutive games Everton went without conceding a goal – another club record. Southall then conceded just one goal (a penalty) in five games en route to the 1995 FA Cup final against Manchester United. Everton won the game 1–0, with Southall making a double save from Paul Scholes; the victory left Southall as the most decorated Everton player in the club&#x27;s history.

In the summer of 1995, Southall was given a testimonial match against Celtic as well as an MBE – during the ceremony the Queen asked Southall &quot;what will you do now that you&#x27;re retired?&quot;. He went on to keep a clean sheet in the 1995 FA Charity Shield, as Everton beat Blackburn Rovers 1–0. He remained an ever-present in the 1995–96 season, though Royle then tried to sign Crystal Palace goalkeeper Nigel Martyn. He tried to sell Southall to Wolverhampton Wanderers, but cancelled the deal after becoming concerned over the pre-season form of touted replacement Paul Gerrard, and instead doubled Southall&#x27;s wages to £6,000 a week with a new two-year contract. Despite this, Royle dedicated an entire chapter of his 2005 autobiography to decrying Southall as a &quot;potential weak link&quot;.

After a promising start to the 1996–97, Everton were beaten six times after Christmas. Southall resorted to ringing up a phone-in radio show to defend manager Joe Royle from unhappy supporters. Royle dropped Southall from the team despite the show of support, though he rejected a transfer offer from Chelsea, who were prepared to double Southall&#x27;s wages. Caretaker-manager Dave Watson restored Southall to the starting line-up after Royle&#x27;s resignation, and steered the club away from relegation.

Howard Kendall returned to manage Everton for the 1997–98 season and initially dropped Southall. However, Southall regained his place and had a memorable match playing against Coventry City on 25 October; Southall was &quot;in inspired form&quot; and kept a clean sheet. Southall played in the Everton goal for the final time on 29 November in a 2–0 defeat at home to Tottenham Hotspur. Thomas Myhre took his place in goal, and Southall rejected a coaching role at the club to search for first-team football elsewhere.

In December 1997, Southall went to Alvin Martin&#x27;s Southend United of the Second Division on loan. He made 9 appearances in a brief stay at Roots Hall. He joined Chris Kamara&#x27;s First Division Stoke City in February 1998. Kamara resigned two months later, and caretaker manager Alan Durban pulled Southall aside on his first day in charge to say &quot;I&#x27;ll let you manage the reserves, so long as you keep your head down, do whatever I tell you, and I won&#x27;t tell everybody you&#x27;re a bad influence&quot;. Southall was shocked by Durban&#x27;s words and could not explain his attitude. Both Southend and Stoke would end the season bottom of their respective divisions and Everton only avoided relegation on the last day of the season. He left the Britannia Stadium in the summer and later said, &quot;one of the worst episodes of my life had drawn to a close&quot;.

=== Later years ===
Former teammate Ian Snodin invited him to join Conference side Doncaster Rovers on a short-term deal at the start of the 1997–98 season. He signed with Wes Saunders&#x27;s Torquay United of the Third Division in December 1998. He saved a penalty on his debut at Plainmoor in a 2–0 win over Hull City and signed a contract lasting until the end of the 1998–99 campaign. He was named Torquay&#x27;s Player of the Year at the end of the season. However, on 29 January 2000, he picked up a concussion in a 2–1 defeat to Chester City at the Deva Stadium, and was substituted. Though he recovered from his injury after the match, he left the club not long afterwards.

Southall made a return to the Premier League by signing with Bradford City as a player-coach, helping to coach Aidan Davison, Matt Clarke and Gary Walsh. All three goalkeepers picked up injuries, leaving manager Paul Jewell no choice but to play Southall at Valley Parade on 12 March 2000, against Leeds United. At the age of 41 years and 178 days he became the fourth oldest player in Premier League history. Leeds won 2–1, and Southall was criticised in the media for being too overweight to play professionally. He left Bradford at the end of the 2000–01 season after falling out with new boss Jim Jefferies.

== International career ==
Wales manager Mike England preferred Dai Davies in goal as Southall began to play first-team football at Everton. Southall only got a run of games once Davies retired. His first cap came against Northern Ireland at the Racecourse Ground, Wrexham on 27 May 1982 in the 1982 British Home Championship, Wales won 3–0.

Wales came close to qualifying for the 1986 FIFA World Cup despite losing their opening qualifying games away to Iceland and Spain. Wales then beat Iceland at Ninian Park, before recording a surprise 1–0 win over Scotland at Hampden Park with a single Ian Rush goal. A 3–0 win over Spain at the Racecourse Ground meant that Wales could secure qualification by beating Scotland in their final qualification game at Ninian Park. However, a draw would not be enough. The game ended in a 1–1 draw after a late Davie Cooper penalty cancelled out Mark Hughes&#x27;s opener; Southall got a hand to the penalty, but could not keep it out. However, the result of the game was put into perspective when Scotland manager Jock Stein suffered a heart attack at the end of the game and died shortly afterwards.

Wales came close to qualifying for UEFA Euro 1988, which would have been the first UEFA European Football Championship in the nation&#x27;s history. Going into the final two qualifying games, Wales led their group. Southall was injured and so missed the match against Denmark in Copenhagen, which ended in a 1–0 defeat with Eddie Niedzwiecki in goal. Southall returned to play the final game, a 2–0 defeat to Czechoslovakia in Prague which left Wales two points short of group winners Denmark. Manager Mike England was then replaced by Terry Yorath, who also made Southall a virtual ever-present in the Wales goal.

In qualifying for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, Wales faced Netherlands, West Germany and Finland. They failed to win a game and finished bottom of the group, though Southall did get the chance to play against some of the world&#x27;s best players in Ruud Gullit, Marco van Basten, Frank Rijkaard, Rudi Völler, Andreas Möller, Andreas Brehme, and Jürgen Klinsmann.

In qualifying for UEFA Euro 1992, Wales were placed in the same group as World Champions Germany and finished just one point behind the Germans after conceding just six goals in their six games. Wales beat Germany 1–0 at the Cardiff Arms Park on 5 June 1991, and three months later beat Brazil in a friendly by the same scoreline. The game which settled the qualifying group came in Nuremberg on 16 October 1991. Wales lost 4–1 to the Germans, ending Southall&#x27;s Wales record run of 385 minutes without conceding an international goal.

Wales were seen to have their best chance of reaching a major tournament after their group was selected for qualification for the 1994 FIFA World Cup. However, a Gheorghe Hagi-inspired Romania defeated Wales 5–1 in Bucharest to open the Wales campaign. Victories over the Faroe Islands and Belgium and two draws with the Representation of Czechs and Slovaks put Wales back on track, and a victory over Romania in Cardiff in the last game of the tournament would be enough to secure a place in the World Cup. However, Southall allowed a strike from Hagi slip under his body and into the net and was nutmegged by Florin Răducioiu as Wales were beaten 2–1. Once again a death put Welsh footballing hopes into perspective, as Southall attended the funeral of retired postman John Hill, who was killed after being struck by a flare released at the end of the match.

Manager Terry Yorath was replaced by John Toshack, who stuck with Southall but resigned after just 48 days after falling out with the Football Association of Wales. Results went badly under the new boss Mike Smith, despite a 2–0 victory over Albania in the first game of qualifying for UEFA Euro 1996. An embarrassing 3–2 defeat to Moldova was followed by a heavy 5–0 loss to Georgia. Two defeats to Bulgaria ended faint hopes of qualification and cost Smith his job.

Southall applied for the vacant position, but Bobby Gould was chosen instead, who named Southall and Ian Rush his assistants. He tried Danny Coyne, Andy Marriott and Tony Roberts in goal in friendly games, but selected Southall for the World Cup qualifying wins over San Marino. A month away from his 39th birthday, he won his final cap against Turkey on 20 August 1997; the Turks won 6–4. Southall only played the first half as Gould blamed him for the three goals he conceded – his replacement Paul Jones went on to concede three himself in the second half. Southall&#x27;s 92 Welsh caps were a national record until surpassed by Chris Gunter in November 2018. Southall conceded 126 goals, an average of 1.34 per match. The 1958 FIFA World Cup was the only time until the end of his career that Wales qualified for a major tournament, and the British Home Championship was played for the final time in 1984, therefore the majority of Southall&#x27;s caps came in friendlies or qualifying games.

== Style of play ==
Southall was renowned for his shot-stopping ability, particularly in dealing with one-on-one situations, quickly coming off his line to intimidate the onrushing forward and relying on his instinctive reactions to save the ball. He would spend hours reading books about boxing and golf to improve his balance and spring, and would focus on improving minor pieces of kit and behaviour, saying that &quot;If I changed 100 things and got 1% better because of one of them, then it was worth it&quot;.

== Coaching and management career ==
Southall was appointed caretaker manager of Wales, alongside Mark Hughes, following the resignation of Bobby Gould after a 4–0 defeat against Italy on 5 June 1999. In his only game in charge, Wales lost 2–0 to Denmark at Anfield on 9 June 1999, and Mark Hughes was appointed as manager on a full-time basis. During his time playing for Torquay United he also worked as a goalkeeping coach at Huddersfield Town and Tranmere Rovers. He later became a player-coach at York City, Rhyl, Shrewsbury Town and Dagenham &amp; Redbridge.

He was appointed manager of Conference club Dover Athletic in December 2001. His managing stint at the Kent club was short, and he was sacked in March 2002, after only a few months in charge, after the club&#x27;s new owners decided to promote his assistant Clive Walker. He later made cameo appearances as a player at Canvey Island, where he was also a goalkeeping coach from 2002 to 2004. He also began teaching young people from deprived backgrounds how to coach in a community scheme called &quot;Soccer Skills&quot;, and later worked in the special education sector. He set up his own educational consultancy that specialised in working with NEETs, in partnership with Brooklands College.

He had spells as coach with all youth Wales national teams from U16 to U19, but quit his post from Wales U19 in November 2004, claiming he was treated with &quot;a total lack of respect&quot; and that the coaching was compromised because &quot;...as always, it&#x27;s about money.&quot; FAW management committee chairman Ken Tucker issued a rebuke, saying: &quot;Nev is making comments on things he knows little about. It is sad when people make comments without any knowledge of the finances of the FAW.&quot;

A month after resigning from the national scene, Southall returned to management with Hastings United. However, just one year on he was sacked, with the Hastings chairman saying that &quot;there have recently been an increasing number of issues on which Neville and I have disagreed and it had got to the point where our working relationship had broken down, beyond the point of repair, as far as I was concerned&quot;.

In November 2008, Margate manager Terry Yorath appointed Southall as his assistant in the Isthmian League. In September 2009, he became the caretaker manager after Yorath resigned as manager.

== Personal life ==
Southall married Eryl Williams in June 1980. The couple had a daughter, Samantha, in 1987. He admitted to having affairs throughout the 18-year marriage and left Eryl for another woman, an aromatherapist named Emma in 1998. In addition to the daughter from his first marriage, he and his second wife also act as foster parents: a 2018 interview reported that they were looking after two children.

Southall is a teetotaller; this fact, coupled with his shy personality and dedication to football, gave him a reputation as a loner. In August 2012, his autobiography &quot;The Binman Chronicles&quot; was released. It was the sixth best-selling football book of 2012.

In 2014, Southall started working as a teaching assistant at Canolfan Yr Afon, the Pupil Referral Unit for Blaenau Gwent, based in Ebbw Vale, helping pupils with their job-seeking and soft skills, and liaising with local businesses to arrange work placements. He had previously worked in a similar role in London.

=== Political activism ===
He is a member of the trade union UNISON and serves as international officer for his branch.

In May 2017, Southall endorsed Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 UK general election. He was impressed by Labour&#x27;s plans to commit 5% of Premier League football&#x27;s £8.3 billion broadcasting revenue back into the grassroots game, among other reasons. He subsequently said the following year: &quot;Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s done all right. Whether you like him or hate him, he sticks to what he says.&quot;

He is active on social media as a supporter of various charitable causes and LGBT rights, and has handed over his Twitter account to people from marginalised groups and organisations that work to support them, in order to give them a platform to answer questions from the public, including members of the LGBT community, a drugs helpline, a suicide bereavement charity, and a sex workers&#x27; collective.

Southall is a prominent supporter of Welsh independence and has spoken at multiple events advocating for it.

<text>The Short Tucano is a two-seat turboprop basic trainer built by Short Brothers in Belfast, Northern Ireland. It is a licence-built version of the Brazilian Embraer EMB 312 Tucano.

On 14 February 1986, the prototype conducted its maiden flight in Brazil before being delivered to Shorts to be used as a pattern aircraft and modified to meet Royal Air Force (RAF) requirements and used for trials and demonstrations. The first Short-assembled aircraft flew on 30 December 1986; deliveries to the RAF commenced during June 1988. The final example of the type was completed in 1995. Maintenance and support of the RAF&#x27;s Tucano fleet was typically outsourced to several private companies.

The RAF was the Tucano&#x27;s primary operator, although export sales have been achieved with the nations of Kenya and Kuwait. A handful have also been purchased and piloted by private individuals. On 25 October 2019, the Tucano was withdrawn from RAF service and was replaced by the Beechcraft T-6Cs.

==Design and development==
===Origins===
Development of the Short Tucano commenced in May 1984, following an agreement between Brazilian aircraft manufacturer Embraer and Northern Ireland aviation firm Short Brothers to collaborate on a response to an outstanding British requirement, which sought a replacement for the aging BAC Jet Provost basic trainer for the Royal Air Force (RAF). For this purpose, the RAF had issued Air Staff Target 412, defining the performance criteria it desired for a new high-performance turboprop-powered basic trainer. A short list was compiled of various aircraft that had been submitted in response; other than the Tucano, the types considered were the Swiss Pilatus PC-9, the British NDN-1T Turbo-Firecracker and the Australian Aircraft Consortium&#x27;s (AAC) A.20 Wamira II.

During 1984, Embraer dispatched the seventh EMB-312 airframe off the production line to Shorts, where it received numerous modifications in order to meet the AST-412 requirements. During September 1984, this same aircraft was displayed at the Farnborough Airshow; by this point, it had been equipped with an uprated PT6A-25C2 engine and a ventral air brake, which reportedly enabled the Tucano to achieve the required stall speed of 60 kn. However, tests undertaken at MOD Boscombe Down later on that year indicated the need to re-engine the aircraft in order to satisfy the RAF&#x27;s requirement for time to height; accordingly, the Garrett TPE331 was selected.

On 21 March 1985, the Short Tucano proposal was declared the winner of the AST.412, receiving a contract worth £126 million for the provision of 130 aircraft, along with an option for a further 15; this option was never taken up. The first flight of the prototype EMB-312G2, which was furnished with a four-bladed Hartzell propeller and the Garrett TPE331-10 engine, took place in Brazil on 14 February of the following year. Shortly afterwards, this aircraft was disassembled and airlifted to Short&#x27;s Belfast facility on 29 March 1986, where it was reassembled and returned to the skies just ten days later. During June of that year, the TPE331-10 engine was replaced by the improved TPE331-12B, with a major difference being the integration of an Electronic Engine Controller (EEC) system.

===Production===
On 30 December 1986, the first standard production model Tucano T.Mk 1 was flown; its official rollout took place on 20 January 1987. On 10 March 1987, the second aircraft made its first flight, and, by April, a third Tucano had joined the test fleet for clearance and final testing, which was largely undertaken at MOD Boscombe Down. The fourth aircraft to be built was the first delivered to the RAF on 16 June 1988 at the Central Flying School. Deliveries would continue to the RAF for another five years, the final aircraft arriving on 25 January 1993.

In addition to the sizable order for the RAF, multiple export customers emerged for the Shorts-produced Tucanos. The Kenyan Air Force ordered a total of 12 units while a further 16 Tucanos were exported to Kuwait. Those Tucanos delivered to the Kuwait Air Force were suitable furnished to be combat-capable; they were armed for the purposes of both weapons training and light attack duties; such aircraft are fitted with four hard points, each capable of mounting various rocket pods, cannons, bombs, and external fuel tanks.

Due to its Garrett engine, the Short Tucano is more responsive to thrust changes and is somewhat noisier than the original Tucano. In addition to the revised engine, the major differences of the Short Tucano are a strengthened airframe for an improved fatigue life, a cockpit layout similar to the RAF&#x27;s Hawk advanced trainer, a revised oxygen system, a flight data recorder, a four-bladed propeller, ventral airbrake and restyled wingtips. Two Martin-Baker MB 8LC ejection seats are used and the canopy was modified to meet the RAF&#x27;s bird strike requirements. During its production run, Shorts commonly promoted the airframe as being &quot;100% British-built&quot;. In order to meet RAF requirements, the EMB-312 has some 900 modifications, which reduces its commonality with the original aircraft to roughly 50% of its content.

==Operational history==
During June 1988, the first Tucano deliveries were made to the RAF; induction of the type commenced thereafter. The type has been principally operated by No. 1 Flying Training School, based at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, where it has been used to provide basic fast-jet flying training to RAF and RN student pilots, on 72 (Reserve) Squadron. Typically, student pilots would fly around 130 hours during their training course on the Tucano before progressing to the jet-powered Hawk T2 aircraft, based at RAF Valley.
The Short Tucano succeeded the BAC Jet Provost as the basic trainer for the RAF, preparing the student pilots for progression to the Hawk T1 advanced trainer aircraft. Following its introduction, the Tucano had reportedly proven to be roughly 70% cheaper to operate than its predecessor. The Tucano&#x27;s accident record has also been remarkably better than other ab-initio training aircraft, with only five aircraft written off with no fatalities in over 20 years.

In March 2007, while discussing the British military contribution to the War in Afghanistan, the British Parliament discussed the concept of replacing the region&#x27;s detachment of RAF Harriers and Tornados, which were being used to provide close air support to Allied forces, with a number of armed Short Tucanos, which would be re-roled as a dedicated counter-insurgency asset. Such use would have required extensive modifications to the RAF aircraft, as they were not fitted with underwing hard points for mounting armaments and equipment upon. Air Chief Marshal Stephen Dalton was dismissive of this suggested use of the Tucano, stating that it would cost lives amongst those on the ground and damage Britain&#x27;s credibility and influence within the coalition forces in Afghanistan, and criticising its lack of operational flexibility.

The RAF&#x27;s Tucanos have been typically maintained by private companies, defence firm VT Group operated one such support contract during the early 2010s. During July 2008, the Tucano&#x27;s envisioned retirement date was moved from 2010 to around 2012, although further extension seemed likely. At one point, Marshall Aerospace were championing the concept of upgrading the Tucano fleet as an inexpensive means of meeting the RAF&#x27;s future basic trainer requirements; the prospective upgrade would have been largely based around cockpit instrumentation improvements as the airframes reportedly had around 8,000 flying hours remaining; some aerodynamic refinements had also been mooted but were dismissed as not being cost-effective.

By 2010, the Tucano fleet was scheduled to be withdrawn from RAF service in 2015, at which point it was to have been replaced by the winner of the UK Military Flying Training System (UKMFTS) programme. However, the type&#x27;s out of service date was put back by several years; the last of the Beechcraft T-6Cs, the Tucano&#x27;s direct replacement, was delivered to RAF Valley on 3 December 2018.

On 25 October 2019, the Tucano was withdrawn from RAF service; to mark the type&#x27;s retirement, an aerial display was performed at RAF Linton-on-Ouse, North Yorkshire, which was also set for closure.

==Accidents and incidents==
On 22 Feb 1990, the first export Tucano Mk 51 &quot;ZH203&quot; (destined for Kenya) crashed near Rathlin Island due to tailplane flutter in high speed weapons carriage trials, killing Shorts Chief Test Pilot Allan Deacon who ejected but drowned.

The RAF lost 5 aircraft in service, all non-fatal (four involved ejections): &quot;ZF316&quot; on 12 May 1992, &quot;ZF270&quot; on 13 May 1996, &quot;ZF293&quot; on 22 Aug 2000, &quot;ZF344&quot; on 12 Mar 2009 and &quot;ZF349&quot; on 8 Jan 2013.

On 22 June 2015, movie soundtrack composer James Horner died when the Tucano he was piloting crashed in central California in a remote region of the Los Padres National Forest about 60 miles (97 km) north of Santa Barbara. Horner was the sole occupant of the plane.

<text>Wilhelm Oswald Lohse (13 February 1845 – 14 May 1915) was a German astronomer. He first worked at the private Bothkamp Observatory, and starting in 1874 at the Potsdam Astrophysical Observatory, being its Chief Astronomer at the time of his death.

 His main work involved the investigation of the surface features of Mars and Jupiter. After this he explored binary stars, and finally worked on the spectroscopy of stars, which included laboratory experiments regarding the spectra of metals.
Craters on Mars and on the Moon were named in his honor.

<text>Square One Television (sometimes referred to as Square One or Square One TV) is an American children&#x27;s television program produced by the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (now known as Sesame Workshop) to teach mathematics and new abstract mathematical concepts to young viewers.

Created and broadcast by PBS in the United States from January 26, 1987 to November 6, 1992, the show was intended to address the math crisis among American schoolchildren. After the last episode aired, the show went into reruns until October 7, 1994. The show was revived for the 1995–96 PBS season as a teacher instruction program, &quot;Square One TV Math Talk&quot;.

From 1999 to 2003, &quot;Square One&quot; was also shown on Noggin, a cable channel co-founded by Sesame Workshop.

==Format==
===Sketches===
&quot;Square One&quot; comprised short sketches that introduced and applied concepts in mathematics such as counting, combinatorics, simple fractions, estimation, probability, and geometry. The sketches featured regular characters and were mainly parodies of pop culture icons, popular television commercials or popular television shows. Sketches were presented in various formats, including music videos featuring a particular subject in mathematics and taught the subject through song (e.g., Roman numerals, obtuse and acute angles, percentages, negative numbers, etc.) or comedic sketches (e.g., &quot;General Mathpital&quot;, a parody of &quot;General Hospital&quot;; &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Inn&quot;, a parody of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;; &quot;Late Afternoon with David Numberman&quot;, a parody of &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;I Love Lupy&quot;, a parody of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Phoneymooners&quot;, a parody of &quot;The Honeymooners&quot;; etc.). &quot;Patterns&quot;, a polka about patterns that can be detected in daily life, was performed by &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic. Since Yankovic did not write this song, it is unavailable on any of his records, though bootleg versions have circulated. The Judds appeared on &quot;Square One Television&quot; many times, as they performed various songs.

&quot;Mathcourt&quot; was a regular segment that parodied television shows of the day set in courtrooms, presided by Judge Sandra Day O&#x27;Crater (played by Cynthia Darlow), who showed zero tolerance for unacceptable behavior from the audiences (and the announcer, with the judge sometimes not knowing who it was), frequently telling the gallery she&#x27;d have them do time or punish them in another extreme way if they didn&#x27;t shut up and stop the interruptions (she even threatened to have them all hanged on one occasion). In all cases, a district attorney was prosecuting a defendant for a math crime the defendant did not commit. The judge was sometimes quick to issue a verdict, but in the end always ruled the defendant innocent after the defendant was able to prove it, leaving the district attorney very embarrassed.

&quot;Mathman&quot; was a regular segment as a parody of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. The skit helped viewers learn to recognize common mistakes while solving math problems, such as forgetting to carry a digit, or making errors with negative numbers. A blue tornado character named &quot;Mr. Glitch&quot;, a parody of the Ghosts, was Mathman&#x27;s enemy and would eat him if he got the wrong answers.

&quot;Pauline&#x27;s Perilous Pyramid&quot; was another sketch that spoofed arcade games. The heroine Pauline would jump around a pyramid similar to the one used in the game Q*bert. Each square had either a positive or negative number on it. Her objective was to get to the very top of the pyramid, keeping the total of the squares she landed on between 25 and -25.

&quot;Backstage with Blackstone&quot; featured math-related magic tricks and performances by Harry Blackstone, Jr. Each segment involved two cast members at a time (either Larry Cedar and Cynthia Darlow, Cris Franco and Luisa Leschin or Arthur Howard and Beverly Mickins; Reg E. Cathey portrayed Blackstone&#x27;s assistant). After performing a trick, Blackstone explained how the trick worked.

Other animated segments included &quot;The Further Adventures of Zook &amp; Alison&quot;; and &quot;Fax Headful&quot;, a parody of Max Headroom.

===Game shows===
Several segments featured child contestants competing to win prizes.
* &quot;But Who&#x27;s Adding?/But Who&#x27;s Multiplying?&quot;: the show&#x27;s first original game, hosted by Larry Cedar. Two players captured spaces on a gameboard by adding or multiplying two digits at a time, trying to be the first to complete a row/column/diagonal of three squares in their assigned color.
* &quot;But Who&#x27;s Counting?&quot;: hosted by Monty Carlo (played by Arthur Howard), with Reg E. Cathey as announcer. Two pairs of players (mainly Cynthia Darlow and Cris Franco vs. Larry Cedar and Luisa Leschin, except for one episode in which real kids were the contestants; season 1)/two players (seasons 3-4) (played by the cast members) tried to make the smallest/largest five-digit number possible (seasons 1 and 3), smallest/largest pair of fractions in season 4, placing one digit at a time as it was spun on a carnival wheel. Also in season 1, Beverly Mickins played assistant Amber Jeannette. 
* &quot;Piece of the Pie&quot; (Introduced in season 2, lasted until season 4): a survey-based game similar to &quot;Family Feud&quot;, using pie charts and teaching percentages. The game was hosted by Cris Franco in seasons 2 and 3, (with Arthur Howard as co-host in season 2) who was replaced by Beverly Mickins in season 4. The set was designed like a hole-in-the-wall pie shop for Season 2, and in Seasons 3 and 4, it was designed like a diner.
* &quot;Close Call&quot;: a game about estimation, using &quot;how many beans are in this big jar&quot;-type of questions, and bearing a similarity to &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;. Arthur Howard was the original host, replaced at the beginning of Season 4 by Luisa Leschin (who was co-host the previous season). Leschin&#x27;s co-host was Reg E. Cathey. The game was originally played as a direct-knockout tournament; it was later changed to a game played for points.
* &quot;Triple Play&quot;: players spun wheels to choose two digits, then had to add/multiply them in order to match numbers on the gameboard, trying to complete a triangle. The game was hosted by Cynthia Darlow, and only lasted one season (Season 2).
* &quot;Square One Squares&quot;: a tic-tac-toe game similar to &quot;Hollywood Squares&quot; and &quot;To Tell the Truth&quot;. The game was later replaced by &quot;Square One Challenge,&quot; which was played for points, but kept the correct/bluffing elements of Hollywood Squares and To Tell the Truth. Both were hosted by Larry Cedar.

All game shows featured Reg E. Cathey as announcer, except for &quot;But Who&#x27;s Adding/But Who&#x27;s Multiplying?&quot;, which had Cynthia Darlow announcing.

Season 5 did not feature any game show segments.

==&quot;Mathman&quot;==
&quot;Mathman&quot; is a video game segment on &quot;Square One TV&quot;.

===Segment format===
A parody of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;, &quot;Mathman&quot; was a fictional arcade game starring a character of the same name. &quot;Mathman&quot;&#x27;s objective was to run around a &quot;Pac-Man&quot;-like maze board (the traditional dots were replaced with + and - signs) and eventually encounter a number or polygon. He would then have until the count of three to determine if that number/polygon was consistent with a given category (see examples below), and if so, eat it. If he made a mistake, his enemy Mr. Glitch (a parody of the multi-colored Ghost enemies of &quot;Pac-Man&quot;) would eat him, ending the game.

If Mathman was able to eat all the correct numbers/polygons, he was awarded a free game. However, Mathman accomplished this feat only a handful of times (i.e., &quot;Multiples of 3,&quot; &quot;Factors of 24,&quot; &quot;Symmetrical Polygons,&quot; &quot;Rectangles&quot; and &quot;Fractions Greater than 1&quot;). On at least one such occasion, a giant Mr. Glitch ate Mathman as soon as the free game began.

During season 4, the format of the game was changed so that Mathman would have to decide if a certain statement (read aloud by the game&#x27;s announcer) was true or false, and then eat the letter T or F. He would then have until the count of seven to make his decision. These were usually general-knowledge statements about math (e.g., &quot;True or False? Mathematics and arithmetic are the same thing&quot;) rather than questions that required actual problem-solving skills. He had until the count of seven to make a decision in this version, but sometimes lost because he wasted too much time explaining his rationale for his decision before making it. Usually two or three correct answers would win a free game.

Occasionally, Mathman did not play the game himself, making Mr. Glitch the contestant. If he answered incorrectly, he would be eaten by Mathman (or on one occasion, Mathman&#x27;s dog Mathdog). On one occasion, Mr. Glitch got away with an incorrect answer, but on the &quot;second&quot; incorrect answer, he was eaten by a giant Mathman.

====Common categories====
*Polygons (e.g., symmetrical polygons, pentagons, etc.)
*Multiples or factors of a certain number
*Inequalities (involving either numbers or formulae)
*Even numbers or odd numbers
*True or false questions

===Characters===

====Mathman====
Mathman was a green, Pac-Man-like character with a big mouth, a winged football helmet (patterned after that of the University of Michigan Wolverines, as a significant number of the show&#x27;s staff were U-M alumni), and a single foot on which he walked around the game maze. When he moved around the maze, he would repeat the phrase &quot;Mathman, Mathman, Mathman,&quot; similar to Pac-Man&#x27;s familiar &quot;wakka-wakka-wakka&quot;. In a few episodes, Mathman was delayed arriving at the beginning so The Announcer gave the mission to Mr. Glitch. Mathman arrived later in Mr. Glitch&#x27;s role as the nemesis.

====Mathdog====
Mathdog was Mathman&#x27;s flatulent pet dog and wore a football helmet like that of Mathman. When he went around the maze, he would say &quot;Mathdog, Mathdog, Mathdog.&quot;

====Mr. Glitch====
Mathman&#x27;s nemesis was Mr. Glitch, a cranky tornado who was always described with a different negative adjective. He was a parody of the multi-colored Ghost enemies of &quot;Pac-Man&quot; and would appear whenever Mathman had to make a decision. If Mathman ate an incorrect number or polygon, answered a question incorrectly, or used up too much time, Mr. Glitch would &quot;power up&quot; (with lightning bolts and thunder crashing), chase after Mathman, and then eat him. He won this right the majority of the times the game was played, only being defeated a handful of times. Mr. Glitch took over Mathman&#x27;s role in a few episodes when Mathman was delayed arriving at the beginning.

====The Announcer====
At the beginning of each sketch, an off-screen voice told either Mathman or Mr. Glitch what his mission would be. Then, a warning was issued to the playing character stating &quot;He will eat you if you are wrong.&quot; He also congratulated Mathman and awarded him a free game if he finished the game perfectly.

==Dirk Niblick of the Math Brigade==

The &quot;Dirk Niblick of the Math Brigade&quot; segment was an animated cartoon.

The title character, Lt. Dirk Niblick, is tasked in each segment with helping friends through practical dilemmas through the use of mathematics. Episodes frequently center on outsmarting scam artists who use deceptive language to attempt to trick the protagonists out of money or property. Most episodes also feature Dirk having one or more telephone conversations with his mother. Supporting characters on the show include Dirk&#x27;s two young friends, the brother-and-sister pair Fluff and Fold Noodleman, and Dirk&#x27;s neighbor, Mr. Beasley. The Dirk Niblick segments are similar in appearance to the 1965 cartoon &quot;Roger Ramjet&quot;; Fred Crippen animated for both, and Gary Owens voiced both title characters.

===Cast===

* Gary Owens – Dirk Niblick
* Bob Arbogast – Mr. Wallace C. Beasley, additional voices
* Joan Gerber – Fluff Noodleman, additional voices
* Gene Moss – Fold Noodleman, additional voices
* Jim Thurman – additional voices

==Music videos==
&quot;Square One Television&quot; featured at least one music video per episode. They were original songs and featured popular artists such as &quot;Kid &#x27;n Play&quot; and &quot;The Fat Boys&quot;. The series reran over 20 videos over 7 seasons.

==Mathnet==

Each episode featured a closing segment titled Mathnet, starring Joe Howard as George Frankly and Beverly Leech as Kate Monday. A parody of &quot;Dragnet&quot;, the storyline of each skit featured the detectives attempting to solve a crime by using math. Each &quot;Mathnet&quot; story line spanned five episodes, or one complete broadcast week (Monday through Friday). Originally set in Los Angeles, the skit was later moved to New York City.

Leech left the show after the third season; she was replaced by Toni DiBuono, playing Pat Tuesday.

<doc id="859906" wikidata="Q732567" url="?curid=859906" title="Cordillera Huayhuash">
<text>Huayhuash (possibly from Quechua &quot;waywash&quot;, weasel&quot;,&quot; or &quot;waywashi&quot;, squirrel) is a mountain range within the Andes of Peru, in the boundaries of the regions of Ancash, Lima and Huánuco. Since 2002 it is protected within the Cordillera Huayhuash Reserved Zone.

==Geography==

The Huayhuash range is 30 km long north to south and includes seven peaks over 6000 m including Yerupajá, which, at , is the second highest peak in Peru. Another notable peak, Siula (6,344 m) was made famous by mountaineer Joe Simpson in his book &quot;Touching the Void&quot;. Compared to the neighboring Cordillera Blanca, Huayhuash possesses narrower valleys and higher mountain passes. There are many lesser peaks surrounding those covered by ice, and several passes exceeding 5,000 m. It is necessary to travel a considerable distance from the central range to find ground lower than 3,000 m, even on valley floors, and the range is often taken to include this much larger area. The vegetated areas of the range are part of the Central Andean wet puna ecoregion.
The area is scarcely populated, containing only small settlements generally found below 4000 m (the snowline is found at approximately 4,800 m). The nearest villages are Chiquián (3,400 m) and Cajatambo (3,375 m). Some mining takes place in the area, so to the north of the mountains there is an unsurfaced road leading up to as high as 4750 m. In 2002, the Peruvian Ministry of Agriculture declared the Huayhuash mountain range a &quot;reserved zone&quot; and prohibited certain economic activities, including any future mining.

=== Peaks ===

A selection of the highest peaks of the Huayhuash range is listed below.

* Yerupajá, 
* Siula, 
* Sarapo, 
* Jirishanca, 
* Yerupaja Chico,

==Trekking==
The range has become noted for trekking in the form of the &quot;Huayhuash Circuit&quot;, which is considered a challenge trail and is undoubtedly far more demanding than the famous Inca Trail in the south of Peru. Fewer people trek the Cordillera Huayhuash than the nearby Cordillera Blanca. The full circuit is about 130 km long and generally takes between ten and fourteen days, depending on the variant taken.

Most of the walking and most of the campsites are above the 4,000 m tree line, so the landscape appears rugged and mountainous, affording views over very wide areas. The area is noted for its spectacular glacial lakes. Hot springs can also be found in the area, at Viconga Campsite precisely. Condors, llamas, alpacas and viscachas can be seen. Trekking is almost always undertaken in the dry winter months of May to September, and the cities Huaraz and Caraz over 100 &amp; 167 km away are the usual choice for organizing and hiring camping a/o logistical support. Chiquián was the &quot;Gateway to the Huayhuash&quot; for a long time. But nowadays, daily buses (locally called &quot;colectivos&quot;) go deep into the mountains to the village Llamaq (3,300 m) and with private transport, as far as &quot;Cuartelwain&quot; camp, reached both by road built in the late 90s and 2000s, becoming now the new trail heads for starting/ending.

More challenging yet is the Alpine Circuit, which encircles the peaks at closer proximity. The Alpine Circuit involves some rock climbing and glacier travel, and takes 8–10 days to complete.

There are several lakes like Solteracoha (or Solterococha), Siula, Jahuacocha, Carhuacocha and Sarapococha.

== Geology ==
The region is primarily composed of limestone, accompanied by sandstone and slate. These sedimentary rocks originated as deposits on the ocean floor and were subsequently uplifted and folded due to tectonic plate convergence. Over time, these rocks have eroded and developed cracks. Marine fossils, such as bivalves and ammonites, can occasionally be found embedded in the rock. 

==Safety==

Until the group&#x27;s effective defeat in 1992, the Huayhuash range was used as a remote base by the Shining Path communist guerrilla. On July 28, 1988, a group of Canadian and Peruvian climbers were held hostage for 12 hours after a failed assassination attempt on a group of military police. None of the climbers or police were hurt, though one Senderista was killed. In the late 1980s a party of European trekkers were robbed and ordered to return to Huaraz with the message that future intruders would be killed. The remains of a guerrilla camp can be seen near the lake Viconga.

Two foreign trekkers are known to have been murdered in Cajatambo in August 2002, though this is thought to have been motivated by robbery. In 2004, four hikers who resisted armed robbery were shot, one of which died of blood loss before they could be rescued.
Since this last incident, the local communities began to charge a &quot;protection&quot; fee for passing in the private properties. Since then, the area is considered generally safe.

Near the north shore of the lake Viconga, the remains of an old Shining Path base camp can be still visited, including a shooting range, barracks and a training field.

== Biodiversity ==
The area preserves high elevation Andean grasslands and patches of forest. Some of the native tree species present in the area are the Andean alder and trees of the genus Polylepis.

Animals that can be found in the area include: the giant conebill, the tit-like dacnis, the torrent duck, the Andean mountain cat, the taruca, the Andean condor, the peregrine falcon, the giant coot, etc.

<text>MTV News was the news production division of MTV. The service was available in the US with localized versions on MTV&#x27;s global network and an online news team. In 2016, MTV refreshed the MTV News brand to compete with the likes of BuzzFeed and &quot;Vice&quot;, but by mid-2017 MTV News was significantly downsized due to cutbacks.

MTV News content was available from respective MTV websites, Apps, YouTube and on-air.

In November 2018, MTV News began producing daily updates on Twitter titled &quot;MTV News: You Need to Know&quot;. Later titled &quot;MTV News Need to Know&quot;, the show has evolved to a digital series that covers trending topics from pop culture to social justice issues to electoral politics and beyond.

On , it was announced that the division would close. The associated website shut down on June 24, 2024.

==History==

MTV News began in 1987 with the program &quot;The Week in Rock&quot;, hosted by long time &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; writer/music critic Kurt Loder, the first official MTV News correspondent. Beginning in 1990, the opening riff to Megadeth&#x27;s &quot;Peace Sells&quot; was the main opening theme for &quot;The Week in Rock&quot;.

It first began covering political news in the 1992 American presidential elections, through its &quot;Choose or Lose&quot; campaign. MTV continued to run &quot;Choose or Lose&quot; for other presidential elections in the United States. For the 2008 election, Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton appeared on an MTV special to discuss the Iraq war.

Throughout the 2000s, MTV News began publishing digital editorial content via their website, Twitter feed, YouTube channel and Facebook page, offering information about MTV programming and music/pop-culture news aggregation. In November 2015, MTV introduced a new direction for its news department and hired Dan Fierman, former editorial director of Grantland, as MTV&#x27;s editorial director and announced it would produce long-form journalism, think pieces and diversify its staff. However, in June 2017, MTV decided to restructure its news division with a greater focus on video, laying off much of their editorial staff. Later years saw a dramatic decrease in content produced by the outlet for its website or other avenues.

The division faced downsizing in the late 2000s and throughout the 2010s, and was shut down in May 2023. In June 2024, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that &quot;more than two decades&#x27; worth of content published on MTVNews.com is no longer available after MTV appears to have fully pulled down the site and its related content&quot;. In response to the archives being removed, Michael Alex, the founding editor of MTV News&#x27; digital organization from 1994 until 2007, stated:
But if history has taught us one thing, it&#x27;s that archives are valuable – for decades, recording studios threw away priceless master tapes left behind by everyone from the Rolling Stones to James Brown… until they started appearing on bootlegs and the artists and labels began spending thousands to get them back. In their way, the archives of MTV News and countless other news and entertainment organizations have a similar value: They&#x27;re a living record of entertainment history as it happened. [...] History needs stewards, not owners. Whoever legally owns the archive does not legally own the history, even if they own the creative work of thousands of writers, editors, producers and more. This archive – of MTV News, where you heard it first – needs to be available to public.
A Paramount spokesperson stated that &quot;all MTV News content is being preserved in an archive&quot; and the removal was &quot;part of broader website changes across Paramount&quot;; &quot;Variety&quot; noted that this archive is not publicly accessible. &quot;Deadline&quot; reported that, per sources, &quot;no content has been deleted and the company is exploring how to make this important content available in a more efficient way&quot;. In July 2024, the Internet Archive launched an independent &quot;searchable index of 460,575 web pages previously published at mtv.com/news&quot; dating back to 1997 on the Wayback Machine. However, the collection is incomplete as some articles and article images were not archived.

== MTV News in the U.S. ==

=== Current and former correspondents ===
== MTV News International ==

When MTV launched in Europe it used a variation of MTV News US reports with localized European reporting. Upon regionalization of MTV channels in 1997, MTV begun to localize presenters and reporting depending on the MTV region. Its flagship programming in Europe consisted of a daily news update MTV News Update and a weekly highlights show called MTV News Weekend Edition; these ceased airing in the early 2000s. With the move of MTV towards more reality based programming MTV News bulletins became a short news bulletin on the hours between 16:00 to 22:00 Monday to Friday on some MTV channels.

As of July 2013, Viacom International Media Networks has launched a new news bulletin which utilises the existing MTV News UK broadcasts. These MTV News International bulletins air on the majority of MTV channels (with exception to MTV US, MTV Canada, MTV Italy, MTV Brazil, MTV Japan, MTV China and MTV Latin America) in the English language which are either dubbed or subtitled. During MTV News broadcasts viewers are directed to mtvnews.co.uk for further news updates. The news bulletins are presented by MTV UK presenters.

MTV Networks confirmed it would relaunch the MTV Brand and its content in mid-2016, MTV have yet to confirm whether this will impact on news broadcasts outside the US.

By 2016, MTV News International was significantly reduced with news reports confined to social media and some localized MTV websites in the UK, the Benelux, Australia and New Zealand.

<doc id="859910" wikidata="Q1118654" url="?curid=859910" title="Institutional economics">
<text>Institutional economics focuses on understanding the role of the evolutionary process and the role of institutions in shaping economic behavior. Its original focus lay in Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s instinct-oriented dichotomy between technology on the one side and the &quot;ceremonial&quot; sphere of society on the other. Its name and core elements trace back to a 1919 &quot;American Economic Review&quot; article by Walton H. Hamilton. Institutional economics emphasizes a broader study of institutions and views markets as a result of the complex interaction of these various institutions (e.g. individuals, firms, states, social norms). The earlier tradition continues today as a leading heterodox approach to economics.

&quot;Traditional&quot; institutionalism rejects the &quot;reduction&quot; of institutions to simply tastes, technology, and nature (see naturalistic fallacy). Tastes, along with expectations of the future, habits, and motivations, not only determine the nature of institutions but are limited and shaped by them. If people live and work in institutions on a regular basis, it shapes their world views. Fundamentally, this traditional institutionalism (and its modern counterpart institutionalist political economy) emphasizes the legal foundations of an economy (see John R. Commons) and the evolutionary, habituated, and volitional processes by which institutions are erected and then changed (see John Dewey, Thorstein Veblen, and Daniel Bromley). Institutional economics focuses on learning, bounded rationality, and evolution (rather than assuming stable preferences, rationality and equilibrium). It was a central part of American economics in the first part of the 20th century, including such famous but diverse economists as Thorstein Veblen, Wesley Mitchell, and John R. Commons. Some institutionalists see Karl Marx as belonging to the institutionalist tradition, because he described capitalism as a historically bounded social system; other institutionalist economists disagree with Marx&#x27;s definition of capitalism, instead seeing defining features such as markets, money and the private ownership of production as indeed evolving over time, but as a result of the purposive actions of individuals.

A significant variant is the new institutional economics from the later 20th century, which integrates later developments of neoclassical economics into the analysis. Law and economics has been a major theme since the publication of the &quot;Legal Foundations of Capitalism&quot; by John R. Commons in 1924. Since then, there has been heated debate on the role of law (a formal institution) on economic growth. Behavioral economics is another hallmark of institutional economics based on what is known about psychology and cognitive science, rather than simple assumptions of economic behavior.

Some of the authors associated with this school include Daron Acemoglu, Robert H. Frank, Warren Samuels, Marc Tool, Geoffrey Hodgson, Daniel Bromley, Jonathan Nitzan, Shimshon Bichler, Elinor Ostrom, Anne Mayhew, John Kenneth Galbraith and Gunnar Myrdal, but even the sociologist C. Wright Mills was highly influenced by the institutionalist approach in his major studies.

==Thorstein Veblen==

Thorstein Veblen (1857–1929) wrote his first and most influential book while he was at the University of Chicago, on &quot;The Theory of the Leisure Class&quot; (1899). In it he analyzed the motivation in capitalism for people to conspicuously consume their riches as a way of demonstrating success. Conspicuous leisure was another focus of Veblen&#x27;s critique.

In &quot;The Theory of Business Enterprise&quot; (1904), Veblen distinguished the motivations of industrial production for people to use things from business motivations that used, or misused, industrial infrastructure for profit, arguing that the former is often hindered because businesses pursue the latter. Output and technological advance are restricted by business practices and the creation of monopolies. Businesses protect their existing capital investments and employ excessive credit, leading to depressions and increasing military expenditure and war through business control of political power. These two books, focusing on criticism first of consumerism, and second of profiteering, did not advocate change.

Through the 1920s and after the Wall Street Crash of 1929 Thorstein Veblen&#x27;s warnings of the tendency for wasteful consumption and the necessity of creating sound financial institutions seemed to ring true.

Thorstein Veblen wrote in 1898 an article entitled &quot;Why is Economics Not an Evolutionary Science?&quot; and he became the precursor of current evolutionary economics.

==John R. Commons==
John R. Commons (1862–1945) also came from mid-Western America. Underlying his ideas, consolidated in &quot;Institutional Economics&quot; (1934) was the concept that the economy is a web of relationships between people with diverging interests. There are monopolies, large corporations, labour disputes and fluctuating business cycles. They do however have an interest in resolving these disputes.

Commons thought that government should be the mediator between the conflicting groups. Commons himself devoted much of his time to advisory and mediation work on government boards and industrial commissions.

==Wesley Mitchell==
Wesley Clair Mitchell (1874–1948) was an American economist known for his empirical work on business cycles and for guiding the National Bureau of Economic Research in its first decades. Mitchell&#x27;s teachers included economists Thorstein Veblen and J. L. Laughlin and philosopher John Dewey.

==Clarence Ayres==

Clarence Ayres (1891–1972) was the principal thinker of what some have called the Texas school of institutional economics. Ayres developed on the ideas of Thorstein Veblen with a dichotomy of &quot;technology&quot; and &quot;institutions&quot; to separate the inventive from the inherited aspects of economic structures. He claimed that technology was always one step ahead of the socio-cultural institutions.

Ayres was heavily influenced by the philosophy of John Dewey. Dewey and Ayres both utilized the instrumental theory of value to analyze problems and propose solutions. According to this theory, something has value if it enhances or furthers the life process of mankind. Therefore, this should become the criterion to be utilized in determining the future courses of action.

It can be argued that Ayres was not an &quot;institutionalist&quot; in any normal sense of the term, since he identified institutions with sentiments and superstition and in consequence institutions only played a kind of residual role in this theory of development which core center was that of technology. Ayres was under strong influence of Hegel and institutions for Ayres had the same function as &quot;Schein&quot; (with the connotation of deception, and illusion) for Hegel. A more appropriate name for Ayres&#x27; position would be that of a &quot;techno-behaviorist&quot; rather than an institutionalist.

==Adolf Berle==

Adolf A. Berle (1895–1971) was one of the first authors to combine legal and economic analysis, and his work stands as a founding pillar of thought in modern corporate governance. Like Keynes, Berle was at the Paris Peace Conference, 1919, but subsequently resigned from his diplomatic job dissatisfied with the Versailles Treaty terms. In his book with Gardiner C. Means, &quot;The Modern Corporation and Private Property&quot; (1932), he detailed the evolution in the contemporary economy of big business, and argued that those who controlled big firms should be better held to account.

Directors of companies are held to account to the shareholders of companies, or not, by the rules found in company law statutes. This might include rights to elect and fire the management, require for regular general meetings, accounting standards, and so on. In 1930s America, the typical company laws (e.g. in Delaware) did not clearly mandate such rights. Berle argued that the unaccountable directors of companies were therefore apt to funnel the fruits of enterprise profits into their own pockets, as well as manage in their own interests. The ability to do this was supported by the fact that the majority of shareholders in big public companies were single individuals, with scant means of communication, in short, divided and conquered.

Berle served in President Franklin Delano Roosevelt&#x27;s administration through the depression, and was a key member of the so-called &quot;Brain trust&quot; developing many of the New Deal policies. In 1967, Berle and Means issued a revised edition of their work, in which the preface added a new dimension. It was not only the separation of controllers of companies from the owners as shareholders at stake. They posed the question of what the corporate structure was really meant to achieve.

Stockholders toil not, neither do they spin, to earn [dividends and share price increases]. They are beneficiaries by position only. Justification for their inheritance... can be founded only upon social grounds... that justification turns on the distribution as well as the existence of wealth. Its force exists only in direct ratio to the number of individuals who hold such wealth. Justification for the stockholder&#x27;s existence thus depends on increasing distribution within the American population. Ideally the stockholder&#x27;s position will be impregnable only when every American family has its fragment of that position and of the wealth by which the opportunity to develop individuality becomes fully actualized.

==John Kenneth Galbraith==
John Kenneth Galbraith (1908–2006) worked in the New Deal administration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Although he wrote later, and was more developed than the earlier institutional economists, Galbraith was critical of orthodox economics throughout the late twentieth century. In &quot;The Affluent Society&quot; (1958), Galbraith argues voters reaching a certain material wealth begin to vote against the common good. He uses the term &quot;conventional wisdom&quot; to refer to the orthodox ideas that underpin the resulting conservative consensus.

In an age of big business, it is unrealistic to think only of markets of the classical kind. Big businesses set their own terms in the marketplace, and use their combined resources for advertising programmes to support demand for their own products. As a result, individual preferences actually reflect the preferences of entrenched corporations, a &quot;dependence effect&quot;, and the economy as a whole is geared to irrational goals.

In &quot;The New Industrial State&quot; Galbraith argues that economic decisions are planned by a private bureaucracy, a technostructure of experts who manipulate marketing and public relations channels. This hierarchy is self-serving, profits are no longer the prime motivator, and even managers are not in control. Because they are the new planners, corporations detest risk, requiring steady economic and stable markets. They recruit governments to serve their interests with fiscal and monetary policy.

While the goals of an affluent society and complicit government serve the irrational technostructure, public space is simultaneously impoverished. Galbraith paints the picture of stepping from penthouse villas on to unpaved streets, from landscaped gardens to unkempt public parks. In &quot;Economics and the Public Purpose&quot; (1973) Galbraith advocates a &quot;new socialism&quot; (social democracy) as the solution, with nationalization of military production and public services such as health care, plus disciplined salary and price controls to reduce inequality and hamper inflation.

==New institutional economics==
With the new developments in the economic theory of organizations, information, property rights, and transaction costs, an attempt was made to integrate institutionalism into more recent developments in mainstream economics, under the title new institutional economics.

==Criticism==
Critics of institutionalism have maintained that the concept of &quot;institution&quot; is so central for all social science that it is senseless to use it as a buzzword for a particular theoretical school. And as a consequence, the elusive meaning of the concept of &quot;institution&quot; has resulted in a bewildering and never-ending dispute about which scholars are &quot;institutionalists&quot; or not—and a similar confusion about what is supposed to be the core of the theory. In other words, institutional economics has become so popular because it means all things to all people, which in the end of the day is the meaning of nothing.

Indeed, it can be argued that the term &quot;institutionalists&quot; was misplaced from the very beginning, since Veblen, Hamilton and Ayres were preoccupied with the evolutionary (and &quot;objectifying&quot;) forces of technology and institutions had a secondary place within their theories. Institutions were almost a kind of &quot;anti-stuff&quot;; their key concern was on technology and not on institutions. Rather than being &quot;institutional,&quot; Veblen, Hamilton and Ayres’ position is anti-institutional.

==Response==
According to Thaler and Sunstein, a person is not generally best described as an Econ, a person with mainly self-interest in mind, but rather as a Human. Institutional economics, consistent with Thaler and Sunstein, sees humans as social and part of a community, which has been extracted from neoclassical economics. The Metaeconomics Frame and Dual Interest Theory argues that it is essential to integrate institutional and neoclassical economics.

<text>(alternately KEYBOARD MANIA, and abbreviated KBM) is a rhythm video game created by the Bemani division of Konami. In this game up to two players use 24-key keyboards to play the piano or keyboard part of a selected song. Notes are represented on-screen by small bars that scroll downward above an image of the keyboard itself. The goal is to play the matching key when a note bar descends to the red play point line. The arcade cabinet has two screens - one for each player.

There is also a simulator called &quot;DoReMi Mania&quot;, which uses *.pms files, but the players can use a MIDI-to-pms converter to simplify editing.

==Arcade release==
&quot;Keyboardmania&quot; has three Japanese arcade releases: 
* Keyboardmania (February 6, 2000)
* Keyboardmania 2ndMIX (October 6, 2000)
* Keyboardmania 3rdMIX (March 15, 2001)

==Super linking session==
Keyboardmania 3rdMIX has a linking feature with Drummania 4thMIX/GUITARFREAKS 5thMIX and Drummania 5thMIX/GUITARFREAKS 6thMIX with a dozen songs.

==Home version==
&quot;Keyboardmania&quot; has 2 home versions for PlayStation 2:
* Keyboardmania (September 21, 2000)
* Keyboardmania II (2ndMIX &amp; 3rdMIX) (February 28, 2002)

The home version of the game has modified controller similar to the arcade keys.

One other notable version is for Windows PCs and is shipped with the Yamaha EZ-250i Keyboard, which is used to play:
* Keyboardmania Yamaha Edition (July 23, 2003)

==Song lists==
&quot;The list is incomplete&quot;

===Keyboardmania===
===&quot;Keyboardmania 2ndMix&quot;===
===&quot;Keyboardmania 3rdMix&quot;===
==Notable songs==
These songs were later featured in &quot;Dance Dance Revolution Extreme&quot; and every subsequent &quot;Dance Dance Revolution&quot; arcade release, excluding &quot;Dancing Stage Fusion&quot;:
* Frozen Ray - also in &quot;Beatmania IIDX 6th Style&quot;
* Pink Rose - also in &quot;Pop&#x27;n music 5&quot; (for the Japanese PlayStation) and &quot;Beatmania IIDX 12.HAPPY SKY&quot;
* The Least 100sec - one of the dozen songs that can be played in the Super linking Session. This song also appears in &quot;Pop&#x27;n music&quot; and the Beatmania series, including &quot;III&quot; and &quot;IIDX&quot;.

==Trivia==
* Since there are 24 keys, the range is C3-B4.

<text>Sensory neurons, also known as afferent neurons, are neurons in the nervous system, that convert a specific type of stimulus, via their receptors, into action potentials or graded receptor potentials. This process is called sensory transduction. The cell bodies of the sensory neurons are located in the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord.

The sensory information travels on the afferent nerve fibers in a sensory nerve, to the brain via the spinal cord. Spinal nerves transmit external sensations via sensory nerves to the brain through the spinal cord. The stimulus can come from exteroreceptors outside the body, for example those that detect light and sound, or from interoreceptors inside the body, for example those that are responsive to blood pressure or the sense of body position.
== Types and function ==
Sensory neurons in vertebrates are predominantly pseudounipolar or bipolar, and different types of sensory neurons have different sensory receptors that respond to different kinds of stimuli. There are at least six external and two internal sensory receptors:

=== External receptors===

External receptors that respond to stimuli from outside the body are called exteroreceptors. Exteroreceptors include chemoreceptors such as olfactory receptors (smell) and taste receptors, photoreceptors (vision), thermoreceptors (temperature), nociceptors (pain), hair cells (hearing and balance), and a number of other different mechanoreceptors for touch and proprioception (stretch, distortion and stress).

==== Smell ====
The sensory neurons involved in smell are called olfactory sensory neurons. These neurons contain receptors, called olfactory receptors, that are activated by odor molecules in the air. The molecules in the air are detected by enlarged cilia and microvilli. These sensory neurons produce action potentials. Their axons form the olfactory nerve, and they synapse directly onto neurons in the cerebral cortex (olfactory bulb). They do not use the same route as other sensory systems, bypassing the brain stem and the thalamus. The neurons in the olfactory bulb that receive direct sensory nerve input, have connections to other parts of the olfactory system and many parts of the limbic system. 9.

==== Taste ====
Taste sensation is facilitated by specialized sensory neurons located in the taste buds of the tongue and other parts of the mouth and throat. These sensory neurons are responsible for detecting different taste qualities, such as sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and savory. When you eat or drink something, chemicals in the food or liquid interact with receptors on these sensory neurons, triggering signals that are sent to the brain. The brain then processes these signals and interprets them as specific taste sensations, allowing you to perceive and enjoy the flavors of the foods you consume. When taste receptor cells are stimulated by the binding of these chemical compounds (tastants), it can lead to changes in the flow of ions, such as sodium (Na+), calcium (Ca2+), and potassium (K+), across the cell membrane. In response to tastant binding, ion channels on the taste receptor cell membrane can open or close. This can lead to depolarization of the cell membrane, creating an electrical signal.

Similar to olfactory receptors, taste receptors (gustatory receptors) in taste buds interact with chemicals in food to produce an action potential.

==== Vision ====
Photoreceptor cells are capable of phototransduction, a process which converts light (electromagnetic radiation) into electrical signals. These signals are refined and controlled by the interactions with other types of neurons in the retina. The five basic classes of neurons within the retina are photoreceptor cells, bipolar cells, ganglion cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells. The basic circuitry of the retina incorporates a three-neuron chain consisting of the photoreceptor (either a rod or cone), bipolar cell, and the ganglion cell. The first action potential occurs in the retinal ganglion cell. This pathway is the most direct way for transmitting visual information to the brain. There are three primary types of photoreceptors: Cones are photoreceptors that respond significantly to color. In humans the three different types of cones correspond with a primary response to short wavelength (blue), medium wavelength (green), and long wavelength (yellow/red). Rods are photoreceptors that are very sensitive to the intensity of light, allowing for vision in dim lighting. The concentrations and ratio of rods to cones is strongly correlated with whether an animal is diurnal or nocturnal. In humans, rods outnumber cones by approximately 20:1, while in nocturnal animals, such as the tawny owl, the ratio is closer to 1000:1. Retinal ganglion cells are involved in the sympathetic response. Of the ~1.3 million ganglion cells present in the retina, 1-2% are believed to be photosensitive.

Issues and decay of sensory neurons associated with vision lead to disorders such as:
# Macular degeneration – degeneration of the central visual field due to either cellular debris or blood vessels accumulating between the retina and the choroid, thereby disturbing and/or destroying the complex interplay of neurons that are present there.
# Glaucoma – loss of retinal ganglion cells which causes some loss of vision to blindness.
# Diabetic retinopathy – poor blood sugar control due to diabetes damages the tiny blood vessels in the retina.

==== Auditory ====
The auditory system is responsible for converting pressure waves generated by vibrating air molecules or sound into signals that can be interpreted by the brain.

This mechanoelectrical transduction is mediated with hair cells within the ear. Depending on the movement, the hair cell can either hyperpolarize or depolarize. When the movement is towards the tallest stereocilia, the Na+ cation channels open allowing Na+ to flow into cell and the resulting depolarization causes the Ca++ channels to open, thus releasing its neurotransmitter into the afferent auditory nerve. There are two types of hair cells: inner and outer. The inner hair cells are the sensory receptors .

Problems with sensory neurons associated with the auditory system leads to disorders such as:
# Auditory processing disorder – Auditory information in the brain is processed in an abnormal way. Patients with auditory processing disorder can usually gain the information normally, but their brain cannot process it properly, leading to hearing disability.
# Auditory verbal agnosia – Comprehension of speech is lost but hearing, speaking, reading, and writing ability is retained. This is caused by damage to the posterior superior temporal lobes, again not allowing the brain to process auditory input correctly.

==== Temperature ====
Thermoreceptors are sensory receptors, which respond to varying temperatures. While the mechanisms through which these receptors operate is unclear, recent discoveries have shown that mammals have at least two distinct types of thermoreceptors.
The bulboid corpuscle, is a cutaneous receptor a &quot;cold-sensitive&quot; receptor, that detects cold temperatures. The other type is a warmth-sensitive receptor.

==== Mechanoreceptors ====

Mechanoreceptors are sensory receptors which respond to mechanical forces, such as pressure or distortion.

Specialized sensory receptor cells called mechanoreceptors often encapsulate afferent fibers to help tune the afferent fibers to the different types of somatic stimulation. Mechanoreceptors also help lower thresholds for action potential generation in afferent fibers and thus make them more likely to fire in the presence of sensory stimulation.

Some types of mechanoreceptors fire action potentials when their membranes are physically stretched.

Proprioceptors are another type of mechanoreceptors which literally means &quot;receptors for self&quot;. These receptors provide spatial information about limbs and other body parts.

Nociceptors are responsible for processing pain and temperature changes. The burning pain and irritation experienced after eating a chili pepper (due to its main ingredient, capsaicin), the cold sensation experienced after ingesting a chemical such as menthol or icillin, as well as the common sensation of pain are all a result of neurons with these receptors.

Problems with mechanoreceptors lead to disorders such as:
# Neuropathic pain - a severe pain condition resulting from a damaged sensory nerve 
# Hyperalgesia - an increased sensitivity to pain caused by sensory ion channel, TRPM8, which is typically responds to temperatures between 23 and 26 degrees, and provides the cooling sensation associated with menthol and icillin 
# Phantom limb syndrome - a sensory system disorder where pain or movement is experienced in a limb that does not exist 

=== Internal receptors===
Internal receptors that respond to changes inside the body are known as interoceptors.

==== Blood ====
The aortic bodies and carotid bodies contain clusters of glomus cells – peripheral chemoreceptors that detect changes in chemical properties in the blood such as oxygen concentration. These receptors are polymodal responding to a number of different stimuli.

==== Nociceptors ====
Nociceptors respond to potentially damaging stimuli by sending signals to the spinal cord and brain. This process, called nociception, usually causes the perception of pain. They are found in internal organs as well as on the surface of the body to &quot;detect and protect&quot;. Nociceptors detect different kinds of noxious stimuli indicating potential for damage, then initiate neural responses to withdraw from the stimulus. 
# &quot;Thermal&quot; nociceptors are activated by noxious heat or cold at various temperatures. 
# &quot;Mechanical&quot; nociceptors respond to excess pressure or mechanical deformation, such as a pinch.
# &quot;Chemical&quot; nociceptors respond to a wide variety of chemicals, some of which signal a response. They are involved in the detection of some spices in food, such as the pungent ingredients in Brassica and Allium plants, which target the sensory neural receptor to produce acute pain and subsequent pain hypersensitivity.

== Connection with the central nervous system ==
Information coming from the sensory neurons in the head enters the central nervous system (CNS) through cranial nerves. Information from the sensory neurons below the head enters the spinal cord and passes towards the brain through the 31 spinal nerves. The sensory information traveling through the spinal cord follows well-defined pathways. The nervous system codes the differences among the sensations in terms of which cells are active.

== Classification ==

=== Adequate stimulus ===
A sensory receptor&#x27;s adequate stimulus is the stimulus modality for which it possesses the adequate sensory transduction apparatus. Adequate stimulus can be used to classify sensory receptors:
# Baroreceptors respond to pressure in blood vessels
# Chemoreceptors respond to chemical stimuli
# Electromagnetic radiation receptors respond to electromagnetic radiation
## Infrared receptors respond to infrared radiation
## Photoreceptors respond to visible light
## Ultraviolet receptors respond to ultraviolet radiation 
# Electroreceptors respond to electric fields
## Ampullae of Lorenzini respond to electric fields, salinity, and to temperature, but function primarily as electroreceptors
# Hydroreceptors respond to changes in humidity
# Magnetoreceptors respond to magnetic fields
# Mechanoreceptors respond to mechanical stress or mechanical strain
# Nociceptors respond to damage, or threat of damage, to body tissues, leading (often but not always) to pain perception
# Osmoreceptors respond to the osmolarity of fluids (such as in the hypothalamus)
# Proprioceptors provide the sense of position
# Thermoreceptors respond to temperature, either heat, cold or both

=== Location ===
Sensory receptors can be classified by location:
# Cutaneous receptors are sensory receptors found in the dermis or epidermis.
# Muscle spindles contain mechanoreceptors that detect stretch in muscles.

=== Morphology ===
Somatic sensory receptors near the surface of the skin can usually be divided into two groups based on morphology:
# Free nerve endings characterize the nociceptors and thermoreceptors and are called thus because the terminal branches of the neuron are unmyelinated and spread throughout the dermis and epidermis.
# Encapsulated receptors consist of the remaining types of cutaneous receptors. Encapsulation exists for specialized functioning.

=== Rate of adaptation ===
# A tonic receptor is a sensory receptor that adapts slowly to a stimulus and continues to produce action potentials over the duration of the stimulus. In this way it conveys information about the duration of the stimulus. Some tonic receptors are permanently active and indicate a background level. Examples of such tonic receptors are pain receptors, joint capsule, and muscle spindle.
# A phasic receptor is a sensory receptor that adapts rapidly to a stimulus. The response of the cell diminishes very quickly and then stops. It does not provide information on the duration of the stimulus; instead some of them convey information on rapid changes in stimulus intensity and rate. An example of a phasic receptor is the Pacinian corpuscle.

==Drugs==
There are many drugs currently on the market that are used to manipulate or treat sensory system disorders. For instance, gabapentin is a drug that is used to treat neuropathic pain by interacting with one of the voltage-dependent calcium channels present on non-receptive neurons. Some drugs may be used to combat other health problems, but can have unintended side effects on the sensory system. Dysfunction in the hair cell mechanotransduction complex, along with the potential loss of specialized ribbon synapses, can lead to hair cell death, often caused by ototoxic drugs like aminoglycoside antibiotics poisoning the cochlea. Through the use of these toxins, the K+ pumping hair cells cease their function. Thus, the energy generated by the endocochlear potential which drives the auditory signal transduction process is lost, leading to hearing loss.

==Neuroplasticity==
Ever since scientists observed cortical remapping in the brain of Taub&#x27;s Silver Spring monkeys, there has been a large amount of research into sensory system plasticity. Huge strides have been made in treating disorders of the sensory system. Techniques such as constraint-induced movement therapy developed by Taub have helped patients with paralyzed limbs regain use of their limbs by forcing the sensory system to grow new neural pathways. Phantom limb syndrome is a sensory system disorder in which amputees perceive that their amputated limb still exists and they may still be experiencing pain in it. The mirror box developed by V.S. Ramachandran, has enabled patients with phantom limb syndrome to relieve the perception of paralyzed or painful phantom limbs. It is a simple device which uses a mirror in a box to create an illusion in which the sensory system perceives that it is seeing two hands instead of one, therefore allowing the sensory system to control the &quot;phantom limb&quot;. By doing this, the sensory system can gradually get acclimated to the amputated limb, and thus alleviate this syndrome.

<text>The red-tailed sportive lemur (Lepilemur ruficaudatus), or red-tailed weasel lemur, is native to Madagascar like all lemurs. It is a nocturnal species feeding largely on leaves, though they also eat some fruit. Individuals weigh around , and there is little sexual dimorphism. In general they live in mated pairs, with a home range of about 10,000 square metres. Both members of the pair use the same home range, and there is little overlap between the home ranges of neighbouring pairs. Travel distances each night are between and 1 km (0.6 mi), making this a relatively inactive species. This species can be found in the Madagascar dry deciduous forests.

Red-tailed sportive lemurs travel in these pairs because it can be difficult for a male to produce roaming strategies and move farther away from the homeland. Therefore, they typically pair up with only one female for reproduction, hence their “partner.” Additionally, these Lemurs don&#x27;t typically have a strong early warning system, making it difficult for them to warn others or send a signal. Instead, they have grown to develop strong escape mechanisms for them to flee danger. Many studies and experiments have been conducted to produce this information.

<text>Lier (; ) is a municipality located in the Belgian province of Antwerp. It is composed of the city of Lier proper and the village of Koningshooikt. The city centre is surrounded by the river &quot;Nete&quot;, around which it grew. In 2018, Lier had a total population of 35,712. The total area is 49.70 km making a population density (PD) of 720 per km. Lier is known for its beers (which include Caves), its patron saint St. Gummarus and &quot;Lierse vlaaikes&quot; cake. It is also home to the world headquarters of Van Hool, a global bus and coach manufacturer. Lier&#x27;s two principal football clubs are K. Lyra-Lierse and Lierse Kempenzonen (formerly known as KFC Oosterzonen, which moved to Lier in 2018).

==Etymology==
The etymology of the name &quot;Lier&quot; is still under debate. It most likely refers to the river &quot;Nete&quot; and the muddy soils that surround it. The Latin name of Lier is &quot;Lyra&quot;, the suffix of which (-ara) is probably derived from the Germanic or Celtic reference to &quot;river&quot;. Alternatively, the origin might be the Germanic words &quot;Ledo&quot; or &quot;Ledi&quot;, which both refer to a location near the confluence of rivers (in this case the &quot;Minor and Major Nete&quot;). Other explanations include the old Dutch word &quot;laar&quot; (clearance in the woods) or the word &quot;liere&quot; (parapet). There is also a resemblance to the Swedish word &quot;leira&quot;, which means &quot;muddy shore&quot;, or the Icelandic word &quot;leir&quot;, which means &quot;clay&quot;. An all together different explanation is the Germanic word &quot;hieura&quot;, which refers to a hillock type of country.

==History==
There is scant record of Lier predating the 7th century. Saint Gummarus himself was born in the 7th century and died on 11 October 714. He was canonised in 754. In 1194 Lier was given oppidum status and in 1212 granted municipal rights. The Lier beguinage was founded in 1258 and in 1998 was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as part of the Flemish Béguinages site. The last surviving beguine died in 1994.

In the 14th century, Duke Jan II wished to reward the City of Lier for joining his fight against the City of Mechelen. He offered the city the choice of either hosting a university or a livestock market. The city notoriously selected the livestock market option, upon which the Duke is reported to have sighed: &quot;Oh, those wretched &quot;sheep heads&quot;&quot;. Today, a herd of bronze sheep near the Zimmer tower serves as a reminder to this fateful decision. The university was eventually seeded in the city of Leuven, in 1425, as one of Europe&#x27;s first and today most prominent universities. The nickname &quot;Schapekoppen&quot; (which translates to &quot;Sheep Heads&quot;) is still used in Flanders to refer to inhabitants of Lier.

In 1496, Lier was the scene of the marriage between Philip the Handsome, son of Maximilian of Austria, and Joanna of Castile. This marriage was pivotal to the history of Europe, for Charles V, who was born to this marriage (Ghent, 1500), would go on to rule both the Holy Roman Empire and the Spanish Empire.

King Christian II of Denmark, accompanied by his spouse Isabella (sister to Charles V and known as &quot;Queen Elisabeth&quot;), lived in Lier until 1523, after having been expelled from Denmark by the local nobility while waiting in vain for military support from his brother in law. He attempted again to regain the Danish and Norwegian throne, but was taken prisoner and spent the rest of his life detained in the Danish castles of Sønderborg and Kalundborg. Isabella died in 1526 at the Castle of Zwijnaarde.
A conspicuous feature of the market square is a headstone (witches-stone, placed in 1974) that marks the spot where Lier&#x27;s last witchcraft-related execution is traditionally believed to have taken place.

In 1860, a skeleton of a mammoth was unearthed at the site of the current city hall buildings. It was the first mammoth skeleton to be discovered in western Europe.

At the start of the WWI, King Albert and his Chiefs of Staff were temporarily headquartered in Lier, before retreating to Temse as German lines advanced. Being part of the redoubt of Antwerp, the city suffered heavily under German artillery fire, leaving much of its medieval structures damaged beyond repair. Most medieval-style structures that exist today (including the town hall and its belfry) are therefore replicas, built shortly after the War.

Lier is routinely referred to with the rhyme &quot;Lierke Plezierke&quot; (which roughly translates as &quot;fun in Lier&quot;). This expression originates from a booklet Felix Timmermans wrote in 1928, in celebration of the 50th wedding anniversary of a neighbouring couple.

The strong ties Lier had developed with the Belgian military ever since in 1888 artillery barracks were built, continued after the World Wars. From 1955 to 1997 the barracks housed the Royal School of Cadets (cadet school for the Belgian army). A prominent alumnus of this school is Belgian astronaut Frank De Winne. The site was vacated by the army in 1998, acquired by the city, and now houses city hall and the police department. Two artillery pieces are on display on the city hall&#x27;s patio, as a reminder of the building&#x27;s past. The city of Lier is also patron city to the Belgian Army&#x27;s &quot;Second Artillery Regiment&quot; (now termed the &quot;Artillery Battalion&quot;).

== Geography ==

Some might argue that Lier is a part of the Antwerp suburban area, making it a district on itself, but generally, Lier is divided into five main districts: Leuvensepoort, Mechelpoort, Lisp, the city centre and Koningshooikt. The last is a historic village that was administratively joined to the town as a sub-municipality in 1977.
