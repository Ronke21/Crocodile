<text>Anadol was Turkey&#x27;s first domestic mass-production passenger vehicle company. Its first model, Anadol A1 (1966–1975) was the second Turkish car after the ill-fated Devrim sedan of 1961. Anadol cars and pick-ups were manufactured by Otosan Otomobil Sanayii in Istanbul between 1966 and 1991.

Seven Anadol models were produced: A1 (1966–1975), A2 (1970–1981), STC-16 (1973–1975), SV-1600 (1973–1982), Böcek (1975–1977), A8-16 (1981–1984) and Otosan P2 500 pick-up (1971–1991).

Production of the Anadol passenger cars was discontinued in 1986, while the production of the Otosan 500 Pick-Up continued until 1991. At present, Otosan builds Ford Motor Company&#x27;s passenger cars and commercial vehicles, which are exported to numerous countries in the world, particularly to the European Union member states.
== Anadol A1 (1966–1975) ==
The Anadol A1, code named FW5 by Reliant which developed the prototype upon Anadol&#x27;s request, went into production on 19 December 1966. The styling of the A1 was by Tom Karen of Ogle Design. In 1967, a New Zealand entrepreneur, Alan Gibbs, announced that he intended to also produce the car in his country as the Anziel Nova. This project never proceeded beyond the initial announcement and prototype.

Production of the A1 started at Otosan&#x27;s new eastside Istanbul plant on 16 December 1966 with the 1200 cc Cortina engine, but in October 1968, it was replaced with the stronger 1300 cc Kent engine. In 1969, the dashboard gauges were updated with a new design and their positions were changed, while the ergonomic design of the steering wheel was improved. In 1970, the two round headlamps at the front were replaced with oval headlamps, a new transmission system was introduced, and the bumpers were changed. In 1971, the interior of the roof was covered with vinyl, in accordance with the fashion of that period. The design essentially remained this way until April 1972.
In 1971, a special model of the A1 was developed in dedication to the Mediterranean Games in İzmir, called the &quot;Akdeniz&quot; (Mediterranean). Anadol Akdeniz was like a prelude of the new model which arrived in 1972, and had bumpers which were integrated into the shape of the bodywork, a different front grille, rectangular headlamps with white signal lamps, and different rear lights. The interior of the car was also completely changed, with a new dashboard, new seats and new finishing materials. Starting from 1972, this model became the standard coupé of Anadol until its production was stopped in 1975.

The five-seat body was built from fibre glass and affixed to a h-frame chassis. The Anadol was originally only available as a coupé, but in late 1973 was joined by a saloon (sedan) and an estate version. The chassis had independent front suspension utilising coil springs and leaf springs on a live axle for the rear. Brakes were disc in the front and drum in the rear. The steering system used a recirculating ball mechanism.

Anadol A1 was also the first Turkish rally car, and &quot;Anadol Ralli Takımı (ART)&quot; became the first Turkish rally team. The first official rally in Turkey, the 1968 Trakya (Thrace) Rally, was won by the famous duo of Anadol A1 pilots, Renç Koçibey and Demir Bükey. Other famous Anadol A1 rally pilots included Romolo Marcopoli, İskender Atakan, Claude (Klod) Nahum, Mete Oktar, Şükrü Okçu and Serdar Bostancı.

Still in 1968, another Turkish driver, İskender Aruoba, participated in the 30,000 km Africa-Asia-Europe Tour, which lasted 8 months, with his Anadol A1.

== Anadol A2 (1970–1981) ==

Anadol A2 was both Anadol&#x27;s first four-door model, and the first fiberglass bodied four-door sedan in the world.

Its prototype was prepared in 1969 and the car was introduced to the market in 1970.

Apart from having four doors and a single wide front bench seat for both the driver and the passenger, the first versions of the A2 shared the same technical specifications with the A1. Starting from April 1972, the front part of the A2 received the same changes that the A1 received that year (including the new nose, front grille and headlamps) and this design went on until the end of 1975.

In 1976, a new version of the A2, the SL, was introduced. The biggest changes in the exterior appearance of the car were made in the front and the back, with new lamps. Particularly, the rear lamps had a completely new appearance. The interior was also completely changed, with a new steering wheel, new dashboard and new finishing materials.

The A2 was also the first Anadol model which received extensive crash tests in order to improve the safety of the car.

Since the A2 was primarily designed as a family sedan, and was also suitable for commercial uses (usually as a taxi), it became the best-selling Anadol passenger car, with a total of 35,668 units sold. The A2 was replaced by the A8-16 in 1981.

== Anadol P2 500 / 600 (1971–1991) ==
In trying to fill a need for light transport, the first prototype pickup truck (on A1 basis) was developed by Bernar Nahum in 1970. Serial production began the following year, equipped with the 1.3-liter Ford Crossflow engine also used in saloons. The P2 also received the new nose of the facelifted A1. In the 1980s, this was upgraded to the 1.6-liter Ford Pinto, as seen in other Anadols as well. After 1983, the 600D version was released, with a 1.9-liter diesel engine, which necessitated a slight bulge in the hood. Always high in demand, and used extensively by the Turkish Post (PTT), the pickup continued to be in production until 1991, when 36,892 had been built. Many saloons have also been converted to pickup trucks.

== Anadol STC-16 (1973–1975) ==
A sports model, the STC-16, was produced between 1973 and 1975. The first prototype was introduced in 1972.

Designed by Eralp Noyan, the STC-16 was the first Turkish sports car. It was also the second completely Turkish-designed car after Devrim, which was produced in 1961 as the first Turkish designed and built automobile.

In 1971, Erdoğan Gönül, the General Manager of Otosan and the son-in-law of Vehbi Koç, convinced the latter on the production of a sports car. The car was aimed at the upper segment of the Turkish market and would participate in international rallies, thus bringing prestige to the Anadol brand. The creation works of the STC-16 were assigned to Turkish designer Eralp Noyan, who had graduated from the Royal Fine Arts Academy in Belgium. The STC-16 was a completely new Anadol and looked nothing like the previous models of the brand, although it had similarities with other sports car models of that period, such as the Datsun 240Z and Ginetta G21.

The car&#x27;s name, &quot;STC-16&quot;, was originally an acronym for &quot;Sports Turkish Car 1600&quot;, but as it was also intended for international markets, STC was alternatively named as the &quot;Sports Touring Coupé&quot;. Among the Turkish youth, however, STC was popularly interpreted as &quot;Süper Türk Canavarı&quot; (Super Turkish Monster).

The STC-16 used a shortened and modified Anadol chassis and suspension system, while using a 1600 cc Ford Mexico engine. The transmission system, on the other hand, was the one that was used by some high performance Cortina and Capri models in Britain. The STC-16 had all the typical dashboard gauges and indicators which the British and Italian sports cars of that period had. Apart from the speed and rpm indicators, a resettable cruise distance indicator (something new for that period) as well as a Lucas ampermeter and Smiths oil, fuel and engine temperature indicators were installed on the dashboard.

Following an initial development period of 11 months, the first three prototypes of the STC-16 became ready for road tests, which took place at the Cengiz Topel Naval Air Station along the D.100 highway (back then known as the E-5 highway), in the town of Köseköy within Kocaeli Province. The first crash tests of the STC-16 were also performed in this period. Afterwards, the STC-16 was taken to England by Nihat Atasagun, Otosan&#x27;s Production Manager, who tested the car at the MIRA circuit. The car received great attention at the streets and highways of England, where most people thought it was the prototype of a new British sports car. Several traffic police officers stopped the car in England, which had a special testing licence plate, &quot;320-E&quot;, interested in finding out more information about the new model. The STC-16 was tested by British drivers at the circuit, and modifications were made according to their suggestions, following which the car&#x27;s performance and safety characteristics were improved. Finally, at the beginning of April 1973, the first STC-16 rolled out of the Otosan factory in Istanbul and went into the showroom.

The global oil crisis of 1973 meant bad news for the STC-16. Not only car fuel became more expensive, but the cost of building fiberglass (which is a petrochemical product) car bodies such as that of the STC-16 also skyrocketed. The rear-wheel drive STC-16 had a relatively high fuel consumption, and the sports coupé market in Turkey appealed to a very small segment, particularly to the young members of high-income families. Unlike other Anadol models of that period which were sold for 50,000 to 55,000 Turkish Liras, the STC-16 had a price tag of more than 70,000 Turkish Liras. When all these factors came together, the primary customers of the STC-16 remained the rally drivers, sports car enthusiasts and young celebrities.

A total of 176 Anadol STC-16s have been produced between 1973 and 1975, the majority of them in 1973, until the global oil crisis in that year reduced demand and slowed down production. Most of the STC-16s were painted in &quot;Alanya Yellow&quot;, which became synonymous with the car. Some of them were red with white racing stripes, and some white with blue racing stripes, as it was fashionable with the sports cars of that period.

=== Anadol STC-16 in motorsports ===
Instead of the heavy steel chassis of the road version STC-16, the rally version had a lightweight FRP chassis, combined with a modified engine.

The STC-16 became synonymous with its era in the memory of that period&#x27;s Turkish youth, and the upgraded motorsports version of the car won numerous victories in rally competitions in Turkey and Europe. Famous Anadol rally drivers in the 1970s included Renç Koçibey, Demir Bükey, Romolo Marcopoli, İskender Aruoba, Cihat Gürkan, Ali Furgaç, Şevki Gökerman and Serdar Bostancı.

== Anadol SV–1600 (1973–1982) ==
The SV–1600, which headed to the showrooms at the end of 1973, was the world&#x27;s first fiberglass-bodied 5-door station wagon (estate) car. It had a completely different design and appearance than the 4-door Anadol models, and was inspired by Reliant&#x27;s Scimitar sports-station coupé.

Several details of the car bore similarities with the station wagon designs of Bertone and Pininfarina in that period. The first examples of the SV–1600 had single-colour paint, while the front hood had a spoiler, which was something new for station cars.

After some time, a more luxurious version was produced, and bi-colour paint was applied, while new interiors were introduced. Starting from 1976, the SV-1600 received aluminium wheels, a new steering wheel, new side mirrors, and a single-colour paint with a black-and-white stripe on the sides. The car also had retractable seats for further enlarging the trunk space.

Production of the SV–1600 continued until 1982.

== Anadol Böcek (1975–1977) ==

The &quot;Böcek&quot; (Bug) was designed by Jan Nahum, who worked at Otosan&#x27;s Design and Development Department in this period. Later in his career, Nahum became the General Manager of major companies like Otokar and Tofaş, the Head of International Business Development at FIAT, and later yet the CEO of Petrol Ofisi. Jan Nahum&#x27;s father, Bernar Nahum, played an important role in the establishment of the Anadol factory and the development of the Anadol A1. Another close family relative, Claude (Klod) Nahum, was an Anadol A1 rally racer, as well as the developer of the Otosan Anadol Wankel engine. He is currently a founding partner of the KIRAÇA Group of Companies, which also includes KARSAN Automotive Industries.

Böcek made it to the showrooms in 1975. The vehicle, similar in appearance to a fiberglass dune buggy but different in design concept and characteristics, was developed upon request for a similar vehicle by the Turkish Armed Forces. Otosan also predicted that the rising popularity of Turkey&#x27;s tourism and beach resorts would guarantee a certain level of demand for a civilian-use version of such a vehicle. The Böcek&#x27;s roof could be opened, it didn&#x27;t have any doors, and its windshield had the same inclination as the hood. The futuristic front panel and gauges of the Böcek were ahead of their time, and were used many years later by future passenger vehicles in Europe.

The Böcek had a 1298 cc Ford engine, which provided very good performance given the vehicle&#x27;s small dimensions. In line with the pop-art designs of that period, the Böcek had asymmetrical front and rear ends. The front grille was asymmetrical, while in the rear, there were 3 lights at the left and 2 at the right. The rearview mirror, which was formed of five differently angled mirrors which provided a telescopic view, was mounted on top of the windshield. The front tyres were 225*55*13 in dimension, while the seats were fiberglass covered with vinyl.

Several different versions of the Böcek (Bug) were designed for institutional and civilian use. There was a version with gull-wing doors, a version for the Turkish Radio and Television Corporation (TRT) which was optimized for using film and video cameras, an off road version, a tractor/trailer version, and a military version.

The Böcek was a design concept that was ahead of its time, but just like the STC-16, it was not a great seller due to the economic situation in Turkey and the rest of the world in that period, caused mostly by the 1973 oil crisis. Only 203 examples of the Böcek were produced between 1975 and 1977.

== Anadol A8-16/16 SL (1981–1984) ==
Production of the 4-door, 5-seat A8-16 series began in 1981. The design concept of the A8-16 was largely inspired by the Volvo and Saab models of the 1970s, including the groundbreaking Volvo VESC (1972) safety concept car and the first generation Saab 900 (1978), with futuristic details such as the large headlamps, inclined nose and the high-positioned rear trunk. However, it also had details that appeared obsolete in 1981, such as the rear lights which originally belonged to Böcek, but didn&#x27;t look good on the A8-16. The interior design and the materials used also did not please the traditional Anadol customers. Many of the design characteristics, especially the door windows and frames, were borrowed from older Anadol models such as the SV-1600 which was designed in 1973, and most potential customers saw this car as a hotchpotch of old Anadol spare parts, mixed with some new ideas. The new body still sat on a box-type perimeter frame with crossmembers, with independent coil sprung front suspension and a live, leafsprung rear axle. Steering is rack and pinion, transmission by the way of a four-speed manual.

Even the higher performance 1.6 Pinto E-Max engine, which was used in the first A8-16s that were produced between 1981 and 1982, could not improve the popularity of these cars. As a result, in order to reduce production costs, this engine was no longer used in the A8-16 SL models of 1983–1984 which reverted to the older 1.6 engine. Only 1,013 examples of the A8-16 were produced between 1981 and 1984.

== Anadol prototypes (1977–1986) ==


=== Wankel engine ===
Otosan Design and Development Department employed many talented engineers, such as Claude (Klod) Nahum, who led the group which developed a Wankel engine that could produce more than despite its small size. But due to its high development costs and the well-known problematic character of Wankel engines, this engine was not used in Anadol&#x27;s models. Today, one of these Wankel engines is displayed at the Rahmi M. Koç Museum in Istanbul.

=== FW 11 ===

In 1977 Marcello Gandini designed the &quot;FW 11&quot; for Anadol and Reliant, the latter naming it as the &quot;Scimitar SE 7&quot;. Four prototypes of this car were produced, two of which remained in England with Reliant badging, and two other examples, one of them white and the other one blue, were sent to Turkey with the Anadol badge. The car, which had a modern design and &quot;luxuries&quot; for that period&#x27;s European cars such as electric windows, was deemed too expensive to produce profitably by Anadol and the project was shelved. The two Anadol prototypes were held in Koç Holding&#x27;s (which owns Otosan) depot in Istanbul&#x27;s Acıbadem district for nearly 25 years. Since 2004 one of them is occasionally displayed at the Rahmi M. Koç Museum in Istanbul.

One of the other prototypes, the &quot;Reliant Scimitar SE 7&quot;, is currently displayed in England. Following Anadol&#x27;s decision not to build the FW 11, Reliant exhibited the Scimitar SE 7 at its stand as a prototype during the Birmingham Motor Show.

The FW 11&#x27;s overall design themes were recycled by Gandini for the Citroën BX, premiered in 1982.

=== Çağdaş ===
During the late 1970s, Jan Nahum developed several prototypes and worked on new Anadol designs. Many of these new prototypes, which even included full-scale models, however, could not be mass-produced.

Otosan, in that period, aimed at creating modern cars, in line with the developments of the automotive industry worldwide, while reducing the amount of fiberglass which it used for building the body parts of its vehicles. To meet this demand, Jan Nahum designed and built two different prototypes of the Anadol &quot;Çağdaş&quot; (meaning &quot;Contemporary&quot;). The bodywork of Çağdaş was made of fiberglass parts fitted on a steel skeleton. The Wankel engine developed by Claude (Klod) Nahum was installed on it.

&quot;Çağdaş&quot; won the top prize of the Turkish State Fine Arts Academy in Istanbul in the industrial design category, and Jan Nahum received the award from Prof. Dr. Önder Küçükerman.

Turkish newspapers made detailed coverage of the car, stating that production would begin either in 1980 or 1981. However, due to the political, social and economic instability in the country, the project could never be realized.

A single prototype of Çağdaş is today displayed at the Rahmi M. Koç Museum in Istanbul.

=== A9 ===
The A9, designed by Bertone, was the last prototype of Anadol. It was a 4-door sedan with a very modern design for the early 1980s. The rear parts of the car resembled the future Peugeot 405, while the overall form resembled the Volvo sedans of the mid-1980s.

A new and more contemporary-looking Anadol logo was developed for the A9.

The design of the wheels were also characteristic of the European cars of the mid to late 1980s.

However, the A9 couldn&#x27;t make it to full mass-production and the prototype was destroyed.

Anadol subsequently ceased to exist as a car brand in 1986, as the Otosan factory began producing Ford Motor Company&#x27;s passenger car models.

<doc id="854951" wikidata="Q1150498" url="?curid=854951" title="SuicideGirls">
<text>SuicideGirls is an online community website that revolves around pin-up photography models known as the Suicide Girls.

The website was founded in 2001 by Selena Mooney (&quot;Missy Suicide&quot;) and Sean Suhl (&quot;Spooky&quot;).

Most of the site is accessible only to paying members. It offers members access to images provided by models and photographers worldwide, as well as personal profiles, blogging platforms, and the option to join numerous groups based upon different interests. There is also an online merchandise store offering a range of clothing, books, and DVDs.

Suicide Girls have appeared in a variety of media outlets including television shows and music videos. They have also been portrayed by actresses in others, such as the character Dani California on the TV show &quot;Californication&quot;.

== History ==
In 2001, Mooney returned to Portland, Oregon, to study photography after working as director of technology at Ticketmaster. Inspired by Bunny Yeager, Mooney began photographing her friends in the pinup style and wanted to create a website that featured her photographs as well as message boards and blog posts from the models. Mooney&#x27;s friend Sean Suhl joined her and they founded the website. SuicideGirls was originally based in Portland, but relocated to Los Angeles, California, in 2003 to be closer to its distributor, label and publisher. That same year, 70 models from the website appeared in a music video for the band Probot.

Mooney has said that the site&#x27;s purpose is to give women control over how their sexuality is depicted. The site is privately co-owned. According to Missy, the term &quot;Suicide Girl&quot; comes from Chuck Palahniuk&#x27;s novel &quot;Survivor&quot; (1999), in which a character talks about masturbating to the troubles of young girls who look up to him: 
 Missy also said the name describes girls who commit &quot;social suicide&quot; by breaking away from societal norms, and created the site &quot;as a place to celebrate beautiful women who choose not to fit into the norm and as a corner of the where outsiders could congregate and be appreciated for being themselves&quot;.

In September 2005, SuicideGirls announced that it would remove a large number of images from its pages in an effort to collaborate with the U.S. Department of Justice standards at the time. The images involved depicted bondage, weapons, or simulated blood. The Department of Justice indicated that images of that type might be the subject of obscenity prosecutions. Although SuicideGirls was not mentioned as a target, they removed the images until the furor passed. In January 2007, the images were made visible again. In 2006, some of the Suicide Girls were featured in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Oedipus Hex&quot;.

In 2015, it was reported that the website had 5 million monthly visitors, 51 percent of them female. SuicideGirls&#x27; 15th anniversary was celebrated at its Peek-A-Boo burlesque show, which is a regular act at Pour Vous nightclub in Los Angeles, and was featured on the website of &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine. In 2017, SuicideGirls released a line of marijuana vape pens and cartridges called Chill Hustle Zero.

== Website features ==
The website is an online community, formed around pin-up photosets of Suicide Girls.

=== Photosets ===
Photosets are a collection of images ranging from fully clothed to fully nude that must share a theme or concept and take place in the same setting. Each photoset contains 40 to 60 images and is created by the model and photographer to portray images of &quot;alternative&quot; beauty, showcasing each model&#x27;s ideas regarding her own beauty.

As of May 2015, there were nearly 8 million images live on the site. Each day, a &quot;Set of the Day&quot; is bought and featured on the front page, marking official Suicide Girl status. The photographs are intended both as an homage to classic pin-up art and a portrayal of alternative beauty.

The site has staff photographers, but anyone can submit photosets. Actress Paget Brewster has photographed models for the site, as have guitarist Dave Navarro and singer Mike Doughty.

== Media ==

=== Comic books ===
SuicideGirls were featured in &quot;Hack/Slash&quot;: Annual Vol. 1 in 2008, released by Devil&#x27;s Due Publishing.

A SuicideGirls comic book miniseries was released in 2011 by IDW Publishing, containing four issues. The comic books feature pin-up drawings of actual SuicideGirls by artist Cameron Stewart, as well as a historical story by Steve Niles. Shortly after, a German edition of the combined miniseries was released.

=== Magazines ===
SuicideGirls has published three issues of its magazine, otherwise known as the &quot;periodical art book&quot; or &quot;pin-up anthology&quot;. Issues 1 and 2 were self-published in 2007 and the third issue was released in 2014 by Ammo Books.

=== Live events ===
==== Blackheart Burlesque ====
The SuicideGirls Blackheart Burlesque group first toured in 2003 and opened for Guns N&#x27; Roses and Courtney Love, before the tour was suspended for nearly a decade. The show returned in 2013 and toured across the US, Canada and Australia, selling out numerous shows in each country. The show also visited the UK and Chile. Its high-energy mix of classic and new burlesque dancing was choreographed by Manwe Sauls-Addison.

The Blackheart Burlesque hosts a show of cult-classic numbers including performances based on &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;The Rocky Horror Picture Show&quot; and pop culture references like &quot;Game of Thrones&quot; and &quot;Fifty Shades of Grey&quot;. As of 2016, the show is hosted by Sunny Suicide and Katherine Suicide and features a changing lineup of dancers. The shows have an element of audience participation and guests are encouraged to take photos of the performers and share them on social media.

==== Ballroom Blitz ====
The SuicideGirls Ballroom Blitz is a monthly rock and metal club night in the UK, taking place at Camden&#x27;s Electric Ballroom. It boasts various stage performances including fire performance, pole dancing and classic burlesque, alongside cage dancing and rock, metal and alternative music. Performances come from UK Suicide Girls and Suicide Girl Hopefuls, guest DJs and guest acts from dance and fire performance groups.

== Controversies ==

=== Censorship ===
In 2005, a number of the paid models were reported to have resigned from the site or had their memberships revoked in connection with allegations of censorship and mistreatment of the models by the site&#x27;s owners. Many members reported that their journals and message board posts were removed because of bullying other members. This practice of deleting either objectionable content, disagreeable content, or membership altogether is called &quot;zotting&quot; by SuicideGirls staffers and is implemented by the site&#x27;s owners when members slander or abuse other members.

=== Exclusivity agreement and lawsuits ===
A primary issue in the past has been SuicideGirls&#x27; modeling contract, which prevented its models (including past models, for a time) from working for competing sites or agencies (specifically those dealing in nude photography or erotica). In response, SuicideGirls stated that only models &quot;who have chosen to be involved in special projects&quot; signed an exclusivity agreement in addition to their standard modeling contract barring them from working with direct competitors for a certain amount of time. SG replaced the contract with a model release in 2006. Many models have received mainstream modeling jobs from the exposure gained through SuicideGirls.

Many of the models involved in the 2005 dispute are now involved with the competing sites GodsGirls and Deviant Nation. GodsGirls has been sued by SuicideGirls for hiring models who were allegedly still under contract with SuicideGirls and for allegedly violating SuicideGirls trademarks. Several former models were also threatened with legal action. In November 2006, SuicideGirls fired one of its main photographers, Philip Warner (aka Lithium Picnic) for acting as the primary photographer for the website of former SuicideGirl Apnea. The termination was followed in February 2007 by a lawsuit by SuicideGirls against Warner. According to a press release by Warner and Apnea, as of February 2007, none of SuicideGirls LLC&#x27;s lawsuits or threatened actions against former models or competing sites resulted in victory for the plaintiff, but the legal expenses in the lawsuits have been costly and time-consuming for the defendants. In June 2008, Lithium Picnic and Apnea issued a press release stating, &quot;We all sat down together and worked out an agreement that is really fair to everyone. [...] We want to make it clear that we 100% have no hostilities towards SuicideGirls in any way anymore, we all came to a really fair agreement over this dispute, and there were no bad people here, just mistakes and misunderstandings.&quot;

=== Reselling photo sets of models to hardcore and pirate sites ===
In 2006, models discovered that SuicideGirls appeared to have begun reselling SG sets to sites models viewed as hardcore or pirate or at least not what they thought they were agreeing to.

=== Criticism by models ===
In a 2005 article, &quot;The Boston Phoenix&quot; reported on former models&#x27; dissatisfaction with company practices. Models interviewed called SuicideGirls president Sean Suhl &quot;verbally abusive&quot; and an &quot;active misogynist&quot;, and the site a &quot;slap in the face to feminism&quot;.

Other allegations surrounding the SuicideGirls&#x27; administration have appeared in a number of publications, including &quot;New York Press&quot; and &quot;Wired&quot; magazine.

According to statistics released by the website, in July 2005 one model left, followed by 11 in August, 25 in September, and 11 in October. According to former models interviewed in a feature piece by Silicon Valley&#x27;s magazine &quot;Metro Active&quot;, this was, in their opinion, due to the general homogenization of the site, &quot;a process that alternative subcultures are unfortunately used to&quot;.

=== Job loss ===
Olivia Black, a recent addition to the crew of Las Vegas&#x27;s Gold &amp; Silver Pawn Shop, and thus the History Channel TV series &quot;Pawn Stars&quot;, was fired from the show on December 19, 2012, when her previous work as a Suicide Girl was revealed.

===Richard Prince===
In 2015, American artist Richard Prince took images from the SuicideGirls&#x27; Instagram, printed them on canvas, and added remarks into comment threads. The works were displayed at the Frieze Art Fair and one image sold for $90,000. In response, the SuicideGirls sold prints of the images for $90 apiece with the proceeds going to charity.

<doc id="854952" wikidata="Q5254744" url="?curid=854952" title="Delta Sigma Pi">
<text>Delta Sigma Pi () (officially the International Fraternity of Delta Sigma Pi, Inc.) is a coeducational professional business fraternity and one of the largest in the United States. Delta Sigma Pi was founded on November 7, 1907, at the School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance of New York University (NYU) in New York, New York and is currently headquartered in Oxford, Ohio. The Fraternity has 218 active collegiate chapters, 9 startup groups, 48 franchised alumni chapters, and over 300,000 initiated members.

==History==
Delta Sigma Pi was established on at New York University&#x27;s School of Commerce, Accounts and Finance. Its founders were:
* Alexander F. Makay
* H. Albert Tienken
* Harold V. Jacobs
* Alfred Moysello
Delta Sigma Pi was established to foster the study of business at the university level. Its goals include: 
* to encourage social activity among business students, 
* to build relationships with the commercial world, 
* to promote strong ethical standards, and 
* to enhance the civic and commercial welfare of the community.
The second chapter was founded at Northwestern School of Commerce. National meetings, called the Grand Chapter Congress, became a regular tradition and to this day the national fraternity meets every other year to conduct business and elect its national leaders.

After rapid expansion in the early 1920s, the fraternity opened its national headquarters in Chicago, Illinois in 1924. In 1957, the central office moved to Oxford, Ohio adjacent to the campus of Miami University. 

The biggest change in the history of the Fraternity took place in 1975, as the Board of Directors mandated that chapters were allowed to initiate female business students, to conform with Title IX.

== Symbols ==
The badge of Delta Sigma Pi is a skull and crossbones, superimposed on a wreath of leaves. The letters &#x27;, &#x27;, and are inscribed on the skull, set with amethyst eyes, a crown on top highlighted in red lacquer, often enhanced with surrounding pearls.

The colors of Delta Sigma Pi are old gold and royal purple. The red rose was adopted as the flower of Deltasig at the first Board of Directors meeting in 1921. It was primarily the gift given to the wives and courted women of Deltasig brothers (which at the time was still all male). One of the founding members, Harold V. Jacobs, suggested a rose as the official fraternity flower because his wife loved roses and it was also her first name (Rose Jacobs). Five years later, in 1926, Jacobs also suggested that the song currently sung at LEAD schools and Grand Chapter Congress events, &quot;Rose of Deltasig&quot; be adopted as the official song of the fraternity.

In 1911 the fraternity published its first newsletter, which soon would be named &quot;The Deltasig&quot;.

==Chapters==

===Collegiate chapters===
Since its inception in 1907, Delta Sigma Pi has installed 305 chapters, of which 218 are currently active. In addition to these chapters, Delta Sigma Pi currently has active startup groups at 9 universities.

The organization is distinctly separate from U.S. social fraternities with similar names, including Delta Sigma Phi and Sigma Pi.

===Alumni chapters===
Delta Sigma Pi has 48 franchised Alumni Chapters on its roll for the 2023-2024 year in the United States, and over 40 more locations worldwide have Brothers with an interest in starting a new Alumni Chapter.

<text>Clément-Bayard, also known as Bayard-Clément, was a French manufacturer of automobiles, aeroplanes and airships founded in 1903 by entrepreneur Gustave Adolphe Clément. Clément obtained consent from the Conseil d&#x27;Etat to change his name to that of his business in 1909. The extra name celebrated the Chevalier Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard who saved the town of Mézières in 1521. A statue of the Chevalier stood in front of Clément&#x27;s Mézières factory, and the image was incorporated into the company logo.

From 1903 Clément-Bayard automobiles were built in a modern factory at Mézières, known as &quot;La Macérienne&quot;, which Clément had designed in 1894 mainly for building bicycles.

The company entered the field of aviation in 1908, announcing the construction of Louis Capazza&#x27;s &#x27;planeur&#x27;, a lenticular airship, in &quot;L&#x27;Aérophile&quot; in May 1908.: however it was never built. Adolphe Clément also built Alberto Santos-Dumont&#x27;s &quot;Demoiselle No 19&quot; monoplane that he had designed to compete for the &quot;Coupe d&#x27;Aviation Ernest Archdeacon&quot; prize from the Aéro-Club de France. It was the world&#x27;s first series production aircraft and by 1909 Clement-Bayard had the license to manufacture Wright engines alongside their own design.

In 1908 &#x27;Astra Clément-Bayard&#x27; began manufacturing airships at a new factory in La Motte-Breuil.

In 1914 the factory &quot;La Macérienne&quot; at Mézières was seized by the advancing German army and automobile production in Levallois-Perret, Paris, was suspended as the factory was turned over to war production, military equipment and military vehicles, aero engines, airships and planes.

In 1922 the company was broken up and the factory in Paris was taken over by Citroën.

Circa 1909 Adolphe Clément received permission from the Conseil d&#x27;État to change his name to &quot;Adolphe Clément-Bayard&quot;.

==Motor manufacturing==


In 1896 Adolphe Clément who held the extremely profitable manufacturing rights for Dunlop tyres in France joined with a syndicate led by Dunlop&#x27;s founder Harvey Du Cros to buy out the Gladiator Cycle Company and they merged it into a major bicycle manufacturing conglomerate of Clément, Gladiator &amp; Humber &amp; Co Limited. The range was expanded, and in 1902 a motorised bicycle led to cars and motorcycles.(See Clément Gladiator cycles for further details)

Clément chose the name Bayard in commemoration of the Chevalier Pierre Terrail, seigneur de Bayard who saved the town of Mézières in 1521. A statue of the Chevalier stood in front of the Mézières factory, and the image was incorporated into the company logo. After the split both marques built very similar cars, but the specifications gradually diverged. Initially, Clément-Bayard cars were imported to Britain under the Talbot brand.

=== Models ===
The initial model range comprised three models (9Hp, 12Hp, 16Hp) and was enhanced in 1904 with a 6Hp single-cylinder, a 7Hp twin-cylinder, and 14Hp, 20Hp &amp; 27Hp 4-cylinders.

From 1904 Clément-Bayard production at Levallois-Perret increased from 1,800 cars per annum to 3,000 in 1907, employing up to 4,000 workers. The range included several models, all luxurious and high quality, from a small two-seater twin-cylinder 8-10 hp to a big four-cylinder 50-60 hp model that could exceed 60 km/h.

In 1907 the 10/12 hp model was introduced with a unitary gearbox and a dashboard radiator.

In 1910 Clément-Bayard started to manufacture a stylish, low cost, small, two-seater roadster, with a 4-cylinder 10/12 hp, and a heater for the driver and passenger. It was very popular and production continued until the outbreak of war in 1914.

By 1913 the factories of Levallois and Mezieres were focused on the production of a wide range of products including car chassis, car bodies, cars, trucks, airships, airplanes, motors, canoes, bicycles, engines and generators.

On the front page of the 15 November 1913 edition of the &quot;Revue de l’industrie automobile et aéronautique&quot; (&quot;Review for Automotive and Aerospace Industry&quot;) Clément-Bayard announced a new 4-cylinder 30-40 Hp motor.

By early 1914 Clément-Bayard had a complete range of twelve models, from two to six seats, equipped with engines ranging from a small 7 hp twin-cylinder for less than 7000 francs to a big 6-cylinder 30 Hp unit. Additionally there was a 20 Hp four-cylinder &#x27;valveless&#x27; (sleeve-valve) Knight engine which was licensed from Panhard et Levassor.

In 1914 the factory &quot;La Macérienne&quot; at Mézières was seized by the advancing German army and automobile manufacture in Levallois-Perret, Paris, was suspended as the factory was turned over to war production: military equipment; military vehicles; aero engines; airships; and planes.

After World War I motor production resumed with an 8 hp (6 kW) and a 17.6 hp (13.1 kW) model.

===Models : 1904, 1907, 1909, 1910===


==Motor racing==

Clément-Bayard started building automobiles in 1903 and then started building racing cars in 1904. The racing team included Albert Clément, Jacques Guders, Rene Hanriot, Marc-Philippe Villemain, &#x27;Carlès&#x27;, &quot;De la Touloubre&quot; and A. Villemain, and Pierre Garcets.

=== 1904 season ===
Albert Clément finished 10th at the &quot;I Eliminatoires Françaises de la Coupe Internationale&quot;, held at the Forest of Argonne on 20 May 1904. This was an eliminating contest for the French entry into the &quot;Coupe Internationale&quot; (&quot;Gordon Bennett Race&quot;) where only three cars were allowed per country. Clement finished the 6 lap, 532.79 km event in 7 hours 10 minutes 52.8 seconds. His team-mates Jacques Guders and Rene Hanriot failed to complete a single lap.

Albert Clément won the &quot;II Circuit des Ardennes des Voiturettes&quot; on 24 July 1904 at Bastogne. He completed the 5 lap 240.010 km race in 4h 26m 52.6seconds at an average speed of 53.91 km/h in an 18Hp Clement -(Bayard?) (car no 5). He also set the fastest lap of the race at 45minutes 02seconds (63.89 km/h).

Clément drove his Clement-Bayard into third place at the &quot;III Circuit des Ardennes&quot; race at Bastogne, on 25 July 1904. He completed the 5 lap, 591.255 km event in 6 hours 34 minutes 43.2 seconds. His team-mates Jacques Guders and Rene Hanriot both abandoned after four laps.

Clément finished second at the 1904 &quot;I.W.K. Vanderbilt Cup Race&quot; on Long Island on 8 October 1904. He led lap 8 of the ten lap race and finished the 457.686 km event in 5 hours 28 minutes 13 seconds.

=== 1905 season ===
Albert Clément retired his Clement-Bayard with overheating after 1 lap of the &quot;II Eliminatoires Françaises de la Coupe Internationale&quot; at the Auvergne on 16 June. This was a qualifier for the &quot;Coupe Internationale&quot; (&quot;Gordon Bennett Race&quot;). Clement&#x27;s team-mate Rene Hanriot finished tenth in 8 hours 23 minutes 39.6s but failed to qualify, whilst Marc-Philippe Villemain retired after three laps.

At the 1905 Vanderbilt cup on Long Island Clément drove an 80 hp Clément-Bayard (France #12) but suffered reliability problems.

Clément retired his Clement-Bayard after the first 166 km lap of the &quot;II Coppa Florio&quot; at Brescia Italy on 4 September 1905. His team-mate &#x27;Carlès&#x27; retired after 2 laps.

=== 1906 season ===
Clément-Bayard entered 3 cars for the inaugural 1906 French Grand Prix at Le Mans where Clément finished third in his 100Hp machine. He completed the 1,238 km event in 12 hours 49 minutes 46.2seconds. Clément led the race at the end of laps 2 and 5 on the second day. Punctures were common and tyre manufacturer Michelin introduced a detachable rim with a tyre already affixed, which could be swapped in about 4 minutes, saving 11 minutes over manually replacing the tyre. These wheels were used by Felice Nazzaro on his FIAT enabling him to wrest second place from Clément on the second day. His father Adolphe was the owner of Dunlop France. Clement&#x27;s team-mates &quot;De la Touloubre&quot; and A. Villemain retired their 100Hp models after 3 and 5 laps respectively.

Clément finished 6th in the &quot;V Circuit des Ardennes&quot; on 13 August 1906 at Bastogne. He completed the 7-lap 961 km race in 6 hours 2 minutes 55.2 seconds in a 100Hp Clement-Bayard. His team-mates A. Villemain and Pierre Garcet finished 11th and 12th.

At the 1906 Vanderbilt cup Clément finished 4th driving a Clément-Bayard (France #15) and completing the ten laps averaging .

=== 1907 season ===
Albert Clément died while practising for the 1907 French Grand Prix on 17 May. Of the 3 other Clément-Bayard entries, Pierre Garcet and Elliott Shepard, finished 7th and eighth respectively. Clément&#x27;s car was entered by &#x27;Alezy&#x27; who retired after 4 laps.

=== 1908 season ===
The company entered 3 cars for the 1908 French Grand Prix which had 13,963 cc (155 x 185 mm) 4-cylinder overhead camshaft, and Victor Rigal finished 4th. Fernand Gabriel came 12th and Lucien Hautvast with riding mechanic Jean Chassagne retired.
=== Other events ===
In 1905 Clément-Bayard won the &quot;Coupe de Calais&quot; and &#x27;finished well&#x27; at the &quot;Course de Dourdan&quot;. In both 1907 and 1908 Clément Bayard won the &quot;Coupe de l’Automobile-Club de Cannes&quot;, and in 1908 it also won the &quot;Tour de France Automobile&quot;.

==Aeroplane manufacture==

Clément-Bayard was an early French manufacturer of aircraft engines and lighter-than-air vehicles, with the earliest flights occurring in 1908. Clément-Bayard manufactured the world&#x27;s first series production aircraft.

The company worked with Louis Capazza to produce the &#x27;planeur (glider) Bayard-Clément&#x27; which was unveiled in &quot;L&#x27;Aérophile&quot; on 15 May 1908.

The company also started working with Alberto Santos-Dumont in 1908 to build his &quot;Demoiselle No 19&quot; monoplane that he had designed to compete for the &quot;Coupe d&#x27;Aviation Ernest Archdeacon&quot; prize from the Aéro-Club de France. The plane was small and stable, but they planned a production run of 100 units, built 50 and sold only 15 for 7,500 francs for each airframe. It was the world&#x27;s first series production aircraft. By 1909 it was offered with a choice of 3 engines, Clement 20 hp; Wright 4-cyl 30 hp (Clement-Bayard had the license to manufacture Wright engines); and Clement-Bayard 40 hp designed by Pierre Clerget. It achieved 120 km/h.

Pierre Clerget designed a range of Clement-Bayard aircraft engines including a 7-cylinder supercharged radial, the 4-cyl 40 hp used on the &quot;Demoiselle&quot;, a 4-cyl 100 hp used on &#x27;Hanriot Etrich&#x27; monoplanes, and a V8 200 hp airship engine.
In 1910 the Clement-Bayard Monoplane No. 1 was introduced at the Paris show. Jean Chassagne who was working on the development and testing, participating successfully in variety of early aviation challenges winning endurance, altitude and speed prizes.

By 1912 Clément-Bayard built a biplane plus three different models of horizontally opposed aircraft engines.

In November 1912 the Clement-Bayard Monoplane No. 5 was introduced. It was powered by a Gnome 7-cylinder rotary engine producing . The pilot sat in an aluminium-and-leather tub.

In 1913 a three-seater biplane was introduced as part of the military project, the Clement-Bayard No. 6. It was configured for two observers in front of the pilot, and was powered by either a 4-cyl Clement-Bayard or 4-cylinder Gnome engine.

In 1914 Clément-Bayard produced a steel scouting monoplane powered by either an motor or a Gnome et Rhône engine. The nickel steel armour was designed for protection against rifle fire.
==Airship manufacture==
In 1908 &#x27;Astra Clément-Bayard&#x27; began manufacturing airships at a new factory in La Motte-Breuil in response to a French Army decision to commence airship operations.

The Clément-Bayard No.1 airship was offered to the French government but was too expensive so it was bought by Tsar Nicholas II for the Russian army.

In 1910 the &quot;Clément-Bayard No.2&quot;, piloted by Maurice Clément, was the first airship to cross the Channel, travelling over 380 km in 6 hours. The army ordered 3 copies.

The airship hangar in La Motte-Breuil is still maintained by Clément-Talbot Ltd.

===Clément-Bayard dirigibles===
Seven Clément-Bayard airships were completed.

==Factories used by Clément-Bayard==

* In 1894 he started construction work on a former military site in the Faubourg Saint-Julien at Mézières, to build a new factory, which would become known as &quot;La Macérienne&quot;. Clément personally supervised the work remotely using photographs taken every day and visiting the site once a week. By 1897 it was producing components and spokes for the Gladiator Cycle Company. It covered 15,000 m2 and using a hydraulic turbine power plant, a steam room, large machine hall, a foundry, a workshop for the nickel processing, the operation with the manufacturing of nuts and spokes on a bike. The factory building still exists but in the spring of 2006 it was transformed into a cultural center.
* Clement-Bayard Automobiles was situated at the Boulevard de la Saussaye 57 in Neuilly in west Paris. Between 1899 and 1922, three wheelers and cars were built there.
* Shortly after the purchase of Gladiator cycles in 1896 Adolfe Clément began to build the new factory at Levallois-Perret in north west Paris. This produced cycles and various cars from 1898, (Clément-Panhard, Clément-Gladiator from 1901, Clément-Bayard from 1903), and went on to build various Citroën models including the Citroën 2CV for nearly forty years from 1948 to 1988. From August 1914 it was dedicated to wartime production.
* In 1908 &#x27;Astra Clément-Bayard&#x27; began manufacturing airships at a new factory in La Motte-Breuil.

==War activity==
Adolphe Clément ceded control of Clément-Bayard to his son Maurice in early 1914, but the consequences of World War I for the company were disastrous. The &quot;La Macérienne&quot; factory at Mézières was lost to the Germans, the machinery was shipped back to Germany, and the forges, foundries and smelter were destroyed. The gutted building was used as an indoor riding school for German officers.

Automobile production at Levallois-Perret in Paris was suspended in August 1914 and the factory was turned over to war production, military equipment and military vehicles, aero engines, airships and planes.

==Demise==
In 1922 the Clément-Bayard automobile company was sold to André Citroën, in whom Adolphe Clément also invested financially, and the factory at Levallois-Perret became the centre of 2CV manufacturing for the next 40 years.

<text>The Medium is a short (one-hour-long) two-act dramatic opera with words and music by Gian Carlo Menotti. Commissioned by the Alice M. Ditson Fund at Columbia University, its first performance was there on 8 May 1946, with Claramae Turner as Madame Flora. The opera&#x27;s first professional production was presented on a double bill with Menotti&#x27;s &quot;The Telephone&quot; at the Heckscher Theater, New York City, February 18–20, 1947 by the Ballet Society. The Broadway production took place on May 1, 1947, at the Ethel Barrymore Theater with the same cast.

In 1951, Menotti directed, with the help of filmmaker Alexander Hammid, a film version made to resemble film noir, and starring Marie Powers as Madame Flora and Anna Maria Alberghetti as Monica. A live television production starring Marie Powers took place on 12 December 1948 on the TV series &quot;Studio One&quot; and on 14 February, 1959 on &quot;Omnibus&quot;, starring Claramae Turner. 
It was also filmed for Australian TV in 1960.

==Synopsis==

===Act 1===
&quot;The medium&#x27;s parlor&quot;

Monica, Madame Flora&#x27;s daughter, and Toby, a mute servant boy rescued from &quot;the streets of Budapest&quot; play dress-up. When Madame Flora, or &quot;Baba&quot; as they call her, arrives home drunk, she violently chastises them for not preparing for that night&#x27;s seance. Soon the guests arrive, Mr. and Mrs. Gobineau, regulars, and the widow Mrs. Nolan who is attending for the first time. With Madame Flora in a trance in her chair, a fake seance is held where Mrs. Nolan speaks with what she thinks is her deceased sixteen-year-old daughter but is really Monica behind a screen. As Monica disappears, Mrs. Nolan rushes toward the figure and is restrained by the Gobineaus. When order is restored, Mr. and Mrs. Gobineau &quot;communicate&quot; with their deceased two-year-old son Mickey, who, having never learned to speak, only laughs. After they say goodbye to him, Madame Flora &quot;suddenly, with a loud gasp... clutches at her throat with both hands.&quot; She feels a phantom hand clutching her throat and is &quot;terror-stricken.&quot; After demanding that the guests leave, she calls for Monica and tells her what she felt, eventually blaming Toby who was in the other room the whole time. In an effort to calm Baba&#x27;s drunken rage toward Toby, Monica sings her the dark lullaby &quot;The Black Swan&quot; which is interrupted by a voice that Baba hears causing her to fly into a terrified rage at Toby for not telling her where the voice is coming from. The act ends with Monica again singing the lullaby while Baba recites her Hail Marys.

===Act 2===
&quot;A few days later&quot;

Toby is giving a puppet show for Monica. Their mutual love becomes more obvious. When Baba comes home, she resumes her accusations on Toby, sure that he knows what went on that night. The guests again arrive, expecting another seance but are driven away by Madame Flora who tries to convince them that the whole thing was a sham by revealing all the tricks that she and Monica used. But the guests are not convinced and leave claiming that while she might have thought she was cheating them, she in fact was not. Once the guests are gone, she drives Toby out despite Monica&#x27;s pleas on his behalf. With everyone gone, and Monica in her room, Baba pours herself another drink and questions her own sanity, becoming wild with drink and eventually passing out. Once she has fallen asleep, Toby sneaks back in and tries to get into Monica&#x27;s room, but finds it locked and eventually goes to the trunk to find his tambourine. While searching, he knocks the lid of the trunk down waking Baba. Toby quickly hides in the puppet theater. As Baba tries to see where the noise came from and fetches a revolver from a drawer in the table. &quot;Hysterically&quot; she shouts out &quot;Who is it? Speak or I&#x27;ll Shoot!&quot; and the puppet theater curtain moves. Baba screams and fires at it several times. As Toby&#x27;s bloody body collapses grasping the curtain, Baba says &quot;I&#x27;ve killed the ghost! I&#x27;ve killed the ghost!&quot; Monica, hearing the gunshots, enters, sees Toby&#x27;s lifeless body and runs for help. As the final curtain falls very slowly Baba asks, in a hoarse whisper, &quot;Was it you?&quot;

<text>The Anasagasti was the first automobile to be built in Argentina; it was manufactured by Horacio Anasagasti of Buenos Aires from 1912 to 1914. 

== History ==
Horacio Anasagasti was a student of Argentine engineer Otto Krause. Shortly after creating his own workshop, he founded the Anasagasti company in 1909, where he repaired automobile, aviation and agricultural engines. In 1910 he presented his first prototype at the Exposición Internacional de Ferrocarriles y Transportes Terrestres (International Exhibition of Railways and Land Transportation): a 4-cylinder in-line engine and a 4-speed gearbox and recoil, which won the Grand Prize Diploma of the exhibition.

After a trip to Europe to find suppliers, in 1911 he finally created his first vehicle, a 15 horsepower (11 kW) Ballot-engined car, with a French engine and Argentine body, being presented on September 17 in the Rosario-Córdoba-Rosario race. It began selling in 1912 for $ 6500. The first versions were equipped with the French engine of 2125 cm3 and were offered with double phaeton bodies and a single door on the left side.

In 1912-13 he entered cars built to his design in Europe. He sent three cars to Europe to participate in different races: a team of the cars competed in the 1912 Tour de France, while a lone Picker-engined racer was entered in the 1913 Coupe de l&#x27;Auto. The &quot;Anasagasti&quot; was winner of the 1515 km Paris-Madrid race.

Anasagasti then returned home to Argentina, where he is believed to have built about 50 touring models. With the outbreak of World War I it was very difficult to get supplies and the company closed in 1915. At the close of Anasagasti &amp; Cia there were approximately 50 units, most of which continued to work as a taxi in Buenos Aires.

== Survivors ==
An example of a 1914 Anasagasti car, previously used by the Argentine Air Force, is preserved at the Museo Nacional de Aeronáutica de Argentina, located at Morón, Buenos Aires. This vehicle was personally donated by Anasagasti to his friend Engineer Jorge Newbery on September 8, 1912. Newbery used it to transport mail to the Aeroparque. Another one is held and used by the &quot;Club de Automóviles Clásicos de la República Argentina&quot; CAC.

<doc id="854963" wikidata="Q1734710" url="?curid=854963" title="Paper Dolls">
<text>Paper Dolls is an American primetime television soap opera that aired for 14 episodes on ABC from September 23 to December 25, 1984. Set in New York&#x27;s fashion industry, the show centered on top modeling agency owner Racine (Morgan Fairchild), her conflicts with the family of cosmetics tycoon Grant Harper (Lloyd Bridges), and the careers of two teenaged models (Terry Farrell and Nicollette Sheridan). The series was based on a 1982 television film of the same name. The show suffered in the ratings, despite positive reviews, and was cancelled midway through the first season.

==Overview==

===1982 television film===
&quot;Paper Dolls&quot; first aired on May 24, 1982 as an ABC Monday Night Movie, which revolved around the lives of two teenage models, Taryn and Laurie, and their strong-willed mothers. The cast included Joan Hackett as Julia Blake, Jennifer Warren as Dinah Caswell, Daryl Hannah as Julia&#x27;s daughter Taryn, Marc Singer as Wesley Myles, Antonio Fargas as photographer Oliver, Barry Primus as Alan (credited as &quot;also starring&quot;), Alexandra Paul as Dinah&#x27;s daughter Laurie (in her first role, credited as &quot;introducing&quot;) and Craig T. Nelson as husband Michael. Joan Collins appeared as Racine, the conniving owner of Taryn and Laurie&#x27;s modelling agency, credited in the opening as a &quot;special guest star&quot;. Eric Stoltz, William Brian Curran, Jeffrey Richman and Lillibet Stern appeared in co-starring roles. The film was directed by Edward Zwick and written by Casey T. Mitchell and Leah Markus, with a theme song written by Mark Snow and performed by Brock Walsh. It garnered 20.5 million viewers.

===1984 television series===

In 1984, MGM decided to produce a weekly series based on the original film. Jennifer Warren and Jeffrey Richman (in the minor role of Conrad) were the only actors to reprise their roles, with Hackett (who died unexpectedly before production), Hannah, Paul, Nelson and Collins replaced by Brenda Vaccaro, Nicollette Sheridan, Terry Farrell, John Bennett Perry and Morgan Fairchild respectively.

New characters included Grant Harper (Lloyd Bridges), the manipulative chairman of the conglomerate Harper World Wide, who was frequently at odds with Racine (Fairchild); his second wife Marjorie (Nancy Olson); his son Wesley (Dack Rambo), chief executive of Harper Cosmetics, who allied with Racine against his father, blaming him for the accidental death of his mother, Virginia, Grant&#x27;s first wife; his daughter, Blair Harper Fenton (Mimi Rogers), Racine&#x27;s top model; and Blair&#x27;s husband David Fenton (Richard Beymer), head of Tempus Sportswear, a business rival to Grant.

During the series, Blair is 30 years old, pregnant and fearing the end of her modelling career. Despite health problems, she was determined to carry her baby to full term. David is too proud to accept financial assistance, and resorts to accepting money from loan sharks to fund his upcoming collection, putting him and Blair in danger. Eventually, he is forced to ask his father in-law for help, resulting in Tempus being brought under the Harper World Wide banner, paying off the loan in full, and also the interest.

Meanwhile, Racine struggles to manage Taryn Blake (Sheridan), the top teen model in the business, who has problems with drugs and alcohol, and a sensationalized romance with 1980s pop star John Waite (playing himself in a recurring role). To keep Taryn and her demanding mother Julia (Vaccaro) in line, Racine decides to promote a new fresh teen face, a young woman named Laurie Caswell (Farrell). The naive and innocent Laurie still attends public school in Stonehurst in Long Island and is not prepared for the fast life, despite her mother Dinah Anderson Caswell&#x27;s (Warren) best efforts to keep her grounded. Dinah, a former model herself, focuses too much time on her daughter&#x27;s career, putting a strain on her marriage to Michael Caswell (Perry), Laurie&#x27;s stepfather.

Despite their vast differences, Taryn and Laurie become good friends, while the rivalry between their two mothers, Julia and Dinah, intensifies. The vindictive and mean-spirited Julia sees her daughter as a meal ticket, and dreads the day Taryn that turns 17 and becomes more financially independent. Rounding out the cast is Blair&#x27;s friend Sara Frank (Anne Schedeen), a sensible lawyer, who is involved with Mark Bailey (Roscoe Born in a recurring role), a reporter doing a story on the fashion industry. Mark becomes enamored with Racine, much to the horror of Sara, who despite agreeing that she&#x27;s &quot;done well for a girl named off of a map of Wisconsin&quot;, warns that Racine has &quot;been in more beds than a hotel breakfast tray!&quot;

==Episodes==

&quot;Note&quot;:
==Syndication and international broadcast==
Reruns of the series have been shown on the SOAPnet cable channel in the United States. The series was also shown in the United Kingdom by the ITV network in the mid-1980s, though schedules varied per region. It was also shown in Italy on Canale 5 under the name &quot;Il profumo del successo&quot; (&quot;The Taste of Success&quot;), and in Germany under the title &quot;Karussell der Puppen&quot; (&quot;Doll Carousel&quot;). In South America and Spain, it was broadcast as &quot;Muñecas de Papel&quot;. In Sweden, it was broadcast 1986 on TV2 under the name &quot;Modedockorna&quot; (&quot;The Fashion Dolls&quot;).

==Reception==
The series attempted to ride the wave of popular glossy nighttime soaps, such as &quot;Dallas&quot; and &quot;Dynasty&quot;. When &quot;Paper Dolls&quot; premiered in September 1984, the first episode achieved an 18.4 rating, and featured the requisite stock pleasures of the genre, such as big business, glamour, intrigue, catfights and verbal spats (particularly between Racine and the other cast members). In one scene, Mark enters Racine&#x27;s office while she is getting a massage, asking &quot;Do you want me to wait outside until you&#x27;re decent?&quot; Racine responds &quot;How much time do you have?&quot; In another scene, an irate Julia, brandishing a Barbie-style fashion doll of her daughter, storms into Racine&#x27;s office. &quot;This will not be the new Taryn Blake doll!&quot; she barks. &quot;The eyes are brown!&quot; Coolly, Racine quips, &quot;I guess they couldn&#x27;t quite match that bloodshot tone.&quot;

Even with a series of rave reviews in &quot;People&quot; urging viewers to give the show a chance, ratings were low and the series was not able to find an audience, due in large part because it had been pre-empted on some weeks by the baseball playoffs. The final episode of the series found David on the verge of failure after an influential fashion critic is blackmailed by Wesley and Racine to pan his new sportswear collection; Marjorie is feared dead in a plane crash; and Racine receives a call from Mark intimating that his digging into her secretive past and had uncovered something very interesting. The cliffhangers were left unresolved.

On the occasions of a draw, a sudden death &quot;final fall&quot; may be requested by either side, with the other able to accept or decline, or an authority can order the match to go into overtime in the case of any championship match.

==Rules==
Iron man matches generally operate under the same rules as any other professional wrestling bout, but instead of the match having to be over before a time limit is up, the iron man match goes the full length of the allotted time, with each wrestler attempting to score as many falls in that time as possible. The wrestler who has the most decisions at the end of the match is declared the winner. Iron Man matches can also be contested with specific win conditions. Kurt Angle and Chris Benoit competed in a 30-minute Iron Man match at Backlash 2001 where only submissions were counted, which was termed an &quot;Ultimate Submission match&quot;.

Some iron man matches have an interval between falls. In 2009, a match between John Cena and Randy Orton had a 30-second rest period after each fall, in part due to that match being billed as &quot;anything goes&quot; (only pinfalls and submissions counted as falls, which can also be done outside the ring, but not count outs or disqualifications). The 2003 match between Kurt Angle and Brock Lesnar had a 15-second rest period after each fall, regardless of how it occurred.

Should the match result in a tie, sudden death overtime may be requested by either wrestler as a plot device, and it is accepted or rejected by either an opponent or an authority figure. After Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle tied 2–2 in a 30-minute iron man match, Michaels begged Angle to go sudden death, but Angle walked off.

Sudden deaths are especially common in title matches. This is because, in the event of a draw, the champion will always retain the title. Commissioner Gorilla Monsoon ordered sudden death (after onscreen president &quot;Rowdy&quot; Roddy Piper had stated that there &quot;must be a winner&quot;) after Shawn Michaels and Bret Hart failed to score a decision at WrestleMania XII, and Christopher Daniels requested sudden death against A.J. Styles at TNA&#x27;s Against All Odds in February 2005.

==Iron man match history==

===World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE)===
Several iron man matches have taken place at house shows. The Rockers faced off against The Fabulous Rougeaus twice in 1989. Bret Hart wrestled one in 1993 against Ric Flair and four in 1994 against his brother, Owen Hart. John Cena and Seth Rollins faced off in a 30-Minute Iron Man match for the WWE United States Championship at a house show in October 2015.

<text>The Anchor Buggy Company was an American buggy manufacturer in Cincinnati, Ohio from 1886 to 1917. After 1917, it operated as the Anchor Top and Body Company till 1927.

The Anchor Carriage Company also had a short-lived automotive branch called the Anchor Motor Car Company (1910—1911).

== History ==

=== Anchor Buggy Co. ===

The Anchor Buggy Co. was founded between 1886 and 1887 by Alfred F. Klausmeyer and Anthony G. Brunsman.

Herman H. Uckotter was an inventor for the company, who invented a steering device called &quot;the fifth wheel&quot;. The company had successfully applied a new principle in fifth wheels and attachments for carriages, with the gear being known to the trade as the &quot;patent anchor fifth wheel and king-bolt&quot;.

Anchor was one of the largest carriage building companies in the region, and at its peak in 1897, manufactured 125 buggies, surreys and phaetons a day.

In later years, Anchor shared its production line with the Lion Buggy Co.; the combined firm was one of the first carriage manufacturers to set up a production line with each worker performing only one task. The firm is also credited with being the first to develop a process for painting wheels using centrifugal force.

==== Advertising ====
An 1890 advertisement for the Anchor Buggy Company featured the &quot;My Wife and My Mother-in-Law&quot; optical illusion; when viewed one way the image looked like a young woman, when viewed another way the image looked like an old woman.

In the late 1890s, Anchor built, what was claimed to be, the “Largest Buggy in the World”, to advertise their buggies at various fair and expositions across the Mid-West.

=== Anchor Motor Car Company ===

In 1910, Anchor was formally incorporated as a stock company, and the Anchor Motor Car Company was set up as an independent automobile division.

The first automobile made by the company was &quot;Anchor-35&quot;, a 5-passenger &quot;touring car of modern design&quot;, with a 35—40 hp (28 tax hp) 4-cylinder engine, and a price tag of $1850.

But in 1911, after the death of Anchor&#x27;s co-founder and president Anthony G. Brunsman, the series production of the automobile was shelved. While the automobiles were manufactured only from 1910 to 1911, they continued to be sold till at least 1916.

=== Anchor Top &amp; Body Co. ===
In 1917, as buggy sales declined, Anchor began selling tops with windshields for Ford cars, and later for Dodge, Olds, Buick, and Oakland.

The company remained in business as the Anchor Top &amp; Body Co. till 1927.

=== Anchor Buggy and Carriage Company ===
In 1958, Samuel W. Levinson, founder of the Stuart Manufacturing Company– that made children&#x27;s night lights and toys– retired from his company, and established another one called the Anchor Buggy and Carriage Company.

From 1958 to 1964, the company created exact miniature plastic carriage models based on the carriages and buggies made by the original Anchor Buggy Company. Levinson had acquired permission from Anchor in 1935 to use their name.

<doc id="854967" wikidata="Q2409010" url="?curid=854967" title="Thanatos (band)">
<text>Thanatos is a Dutch extreme metal band. With a history dating back to 1984, they are the oldest death metal band from the Netherlands. Their second album, &quot;Realm of Ecstasy&quot; (some album covers show &quot;Realm of &quot;), received positive marks from Dutch music magazine Oor and various international magazines for its solid compositions and challenging arrangements. After enduring constantly changing line-ups and problems with distribution, promotion, and even ownership of the rights to the second album, Thanatos folded in 1992, the final straw being the cancellation of a tour with Cannibal Corpse and Exhorder.

In 1999, founding member Stephan Gebédi revived the band, which signs with Hammerheart Records. After re-releasing the first two albums with demo and live tracks, the band&#x27;s third full album, &quot;Angelic Encounters&quot;, emerged in 2000. In 2002 a mini-CD with original songs as well as covers from Celtic Frost and Possessed was released by Baphomet. After a few shows in Greece and a short tour with Pungent Stench, the band recorded their fourth album, &quot;Undead. Unholy. Divine&quot;, described as a solid return to 1980s metal (in the style of Slayer, Possessed) with the addition of blast beats. Release of a fifth album, &quot;Justified Genocide&quot;, was postponed when the band&#x27;s label at the time, Black Lotus Records, went bankrupt; Dan Swano finished the mix for the CD. To celebrate more than twenty years of Dutch death metal, Thanatos released (on Chinese label AreaDeath Productions) a limited-edition box containing &quot;Emerging From The Netherworlds&quot;, &quot;Realm Of Ecstasy&quot;, and &quot;Angelic Encounters&quot;, besides 56 bonus tracks and 19 videos.

In February 2009, the band issued an update containing details about their upcoming album &quot;Justified Genocide&quot;. It was released on March 15 in Europe and April 6 in the UK and Ireland.

Century Media Records signed the band in 2012. The initial plan was to re-release the five studio albums of the band in 2012 and 2013, but the label offered the band a new recording contract which resulted in a new studio album from Thanatos in 2014, entitled &quot;Global Purification&quot;. This coincided with the band&#x27;s 30th anniversary in that year. In 2019, Thanatos celebrated their 35th anniversary with a double-CD compilation album, a 7 inch vinyl EP and a special show in their hometown Rotterdam featuring a lot of former band members. Later that year Thanatos signed a new record deal with French label Listenable Records and started recording their seventh studio album. The album, &quot;Violent Death Rituals&quot;, had a March 2020 release.

<text>The Anderheggen was a Dutch automobile; the short-lived light 4hp four-seater &quot;vis-à-vis&quot;, powered by a water-cooled Abeille engine, was manufactured in Amsterdam from 1899 to 1902. Its transmission was a flat belt from the engine to a system of fast and loose pulleys giving two speeds. Total production was fewer than 10 cars.

The car was built by Ferdinant Anderheggen, a former cyclist, who later worked for Konings. Negotiations with a French manufacturer in Swalmen, Limburg, (probably Abeille) didn&#x27;t work out.

<doc id="854978" wikidata="Q4723980" url="?curid=854978" title="Algebra representation">
<text>In abstract algebra, a representation of an [[associative algebra]] is a module for that algebra. Here an associative algebra is a (not necessarily unital) ring. If the algebra is not unital, it may be made so in a standard way (see the adjoint functors page); there is no essential difference between modules for the resulting unital ring, in which the identity acts by the identity mapping, and representations of the algebra.

== Examples ==
=== Linear complex structure ===

One of the simplest non-trivial examples is a linear complex structure, which is a representation of the complex numbers C, thought of as an associative algebra over the real numbers R. This algebra is realized concretely as formula_1 which corresponds to . Then a representation of C is a real vector space &quot;V&quot;, together with an action of C on &quot;V&quot; (a map formula_2). Concretely, this is just an action of  , as this generates the algebra, and the operator representing (the image of in End(&quot;V&quot;)) is denoted &quot;J&quot; to avoid confusion with the identity matrix &quot;I&quot;.

=== Polynomial algebras ===
Another important basic class of examples are representations of polynomial algebras, the free commutative algebras – these form a central object of study in commutative algebra and its geometric counterpart, algebraic geometry. A representation of a polynomial algebra in variables over the field &quot;K&quot; is concretely a &quot;K&quot;-vector space with commuting operators, and is often denoted formula_3 meaning the representation of the abstract algebra formula_4 where formula_5

A basic result about such representations is that, over an algebraically closed field, the representing matrices are simultaneously triangularisable.

Even the case of representations of the polynomial algebra in a single variable are of interest – this is denoted by formula_6 and is used in understanding the structure of a single linear operator on a finite-dimensional vector space. Specifically, applying the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain to this algebra yields as corollaries the various canonical forms of matrices, such as Jordan canonical form.

In some approaches to noncommutative geometry, the free noncommutative algebra (polynomials in non-commuting variables) plays a similar role, but the analysis is much more difficult.

==Weights==

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors can be generalized to algebra representations.

The generalization of an eigenvalue of an algebra representation is, rather than a single scalar, a one-dimensional representation formula_7 (i.e., an algebra homomorphism from the algebra to its underlying ring: a linear functional that is also multiplicative). This is known as a weight, and the analog of an eigenvector and eigenspace are called &quot;weight vector&quot; and &quot;weight space&quot;.

The case of the eigenvalue of a single operator corresponds to the algebra formula_8 and a map of algebras formula_9 is determined by which scalar it maps the generator &quot;T&quot; to. A weight vector for an algebra representation is a vector such that any element of the algebra maps this vector to a multiple of itself – a one-dimensional submodule (subrepresentation). As the pairing formula_10 is bilinear, &quot;which multiple&quot; is an &quot;A&quot;-linear functional of &quot;A&quot; (an algebra map &quot;A&quot; → &quot;R&quot;), namely the weight. In symbols, a weight vector is a vector formula_11 such that formula_12 for all elements formula_13 for some linear functional formula_14 – note that on the left, multiplication is the algebra action, while on the right, multiplication is scalar multiplication.

Because a weight is a map to a commutative ring, the map factors through the abelianization of the algebra formula_15 – equivalently, it vanishes on the derived algebra – in terms of matrices, if formula_16 is a common eigenvector of operators formula_17 and formula_18, then formula_19 (because in both cases it is just multiplication by scalars), so common eigenvectors of an algebra must be in the set on which the algebra acts commutatively (which is annihilated by the derived algebra). Thus of central interest are the free commutative algebras, namely the polynomial algebras. In this particularly simple and important case of the polynomial algebra formula_20 in a set of commuting matrices, a weight vector of this algebra is a simultaneous eigenvector of the matrices, while a weight of this algebra is simply a formula_21-tuple of scalars formula_22 corresponding to the eigenvalue of each matrix, and hence geometrically to a point in formula_21-space. These weights – in particularly their geometry – are of central importance in understanding the representation theory of Lie algebras, specifically the finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras.

As an application of this geometry, given an algebra that is a quotient of a polynomial algebra on formula_21 generators, it corresponds geometrically to an algebraic variety in formula_21-dimensional space, and the weight must fall on the variety – i.e., it satisfies the defining equations for the variety. This generalizes the fact that eigenvalues satisfy the characteristic polynomial of a matrix in one variable.

<doc id="854979" wikidata="Q4754017" url="?curid=854979" title="Anderson (automobile)">
<text>The Anderson was a United States automobile; considered the most successful automobile ever built in the Southern United States, it was manufactured by a carriage works from 1916 to 1925 in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Started by John Gary Anderson, the company sold cars through a national dealer network. The company used Continental 7R flathead six engines in its vehicles, which were noted for their attractive body styles and color combinations. Andersons were the first cars to be built with headlight foot dimmers and powered convertible tops. Production reached nearly 2,000 units in 1923 and in all 7,000 vehicles were produced during the life of the company.

There are a number of reasons why the Anderson Automobile Co. failed. According to Edward Lee, who wrote the 2007 book &quot;John Gary Anderson and His Maverick Motor Company: The Rise and Fall of Henry Ford&#x27;s Rock Hill Rival,&quot; the vehicle suffered from a defective engine. Anderson bought most of the components from other manufacturers. During the later years of production, Anderson used a Continental engine with an aluminum head and it warped at high temperatures.

Price was also an issue, Lee believes. Model T Fords were selling for as little as $290 in the 1920s, making the cars affordable to the majority of Americans. Andersons cost about $1,650 for a five-passenger touring car and $2,550 for a sedan. Anderson&#x27;s slogan was a &quot;A little Higher in Price but made in Dixie.&quot; Anderson&#x27;s strategy was to invest in the opulence of his vehicles, hoping that consumers would be willing to pay a higher price in return. The strategy failed because customers were more price-sensitive than Anderson anticipated.

In addition, by the early 1920s, the economy of South Carolina and other Southern states were already declining, well ahead of the Great Depression, because of plummeting cotton prices following World War I. The Anderson Automobile Co. was liquidated in 1926. Later in life, John Gary Anderson criticized the city of Rock Hill for failing to give his company financial assistance.

Today, there are just 13 remaining examples of Anderson vehicles in existence. Of those Anderson cars known to exist, four are owned by the Anderson family, one is at the South Carolina State Museum in Columbia and one is in the possession of the Museum of York County, where Rock Hill is located.

<doc id="854981" wikidata="Q1921364" url="?curid=854981" title="Elimination Chamber">
<text>The Elimination Chamber is a professional wrestling elimination-based match held in the WWE. The match was created by Triple H, and introduced by Eric Bischoff in November 2002. It features a large chain-linked circular steel structure which encloses the ring. The chamber&#x27;s floor is platformed over the ringside area which elevates it to ring level. Within the chamber are four inner enclosures outside each ring corner. 

While similar in profile and nature to WWE&#x27;s original large scale steel-structured match Hell in a Cell, the Elimination Chamber match is a multiple participant match wherein two participants begin the match in the ring as the remaining four are held within each inner enclosure and are released into the match at five-minute intervals (in the event of a seven-person Chamber match, three participants begin, and in the event of a tag team Chamber match, two teams begin for a total of four participants starting). The objective is to eliminate each opponent from the match via pinfall or submission. The winner is the last remaining participant (or team) after all others have been eliminated. As in the Hell in a Cell match, disqualifications do not apply. The original structure was high, in diameter, weighed over and comprised and of chain. 

Before the establishment of the yearly Elimination Chamber pay-per-view (PPV) in 2010, the match was contested at other PPV events. There have been 34 Elimination Chamber matches in WWE since the concept&#x27;s inception in November 2002. Every Elimination chamber match has had a stipulation that the winner would win a championship or a future match for a championship (usually at WrestleMania, though one time the championship match occurred immediately after the elimination chamber match).

== History ==
=== Origin ===
Before the introduction of the Elimination Chamber match, WWE only promoted two matches in a caged environment, namely the steel cage and Hell in a Cell matches. The steel cage was the first type of cage-based match in professional wrestling and consisted of four fenced walls of steel surrounding the ring apron while the Hell in a Cell was a taller roofed version that surrounded the ring and ringside area on the ground rather than the apron. In 2002, WWE announced the creation of the Elimination Chamber, a match that combined elements of WWE&#x27;s Hell in a Cell matches, Royal Rumble match, Survivor Series match, and World Championship Wrestling&#x27;s (WCW) WarGames matches, such as the countdown timer and time intervals from the Royal Rumble and War Games matches, the large enclosed cage format of both Hell in a Cell and WarGames and the elimination process from the Survivor Series contest and the Royal Rumble.

=== Brand and pay-per-view designation ===

To exploit additional on-screen talent after buying World Championship Wrestling (WCW) in March 2001, the following year WWE began a brand extension that divided the roster between the two brands of WWE, namely Raw and SmackDown. Former WCW President and then Raw General Manager Eric Bischoff formally announced the creation of the chamber during the October 21 episode of &quot;Raw&quot; and scheduled the match to feature participants from the Raw brand roster at the Survivor Series in November 2002. The match was exclusive to the Raw brand for the first four matches and at joint-branded pay-per-view events, but upon the creation of the ECW brand in 2006 the match was instead promoted for the newly created brand at December to Dismember. Beginning in 2008, the match became exclusive to the No Way Out event and two Elimination Chamber matches were featured annually for two years among the three brands. In 2010, WWE replaced their No Way Out event with the self-titled Elimination Chamber, a new event which continued the tradition of its predecessor. From 2008 to 2014, the match had been featured in February events only. An Elimination Chamber event took place on May 31, 2015 exclusively on the WWE Network. After the second brand extension in 2016, it was announced that the brands would return to having separate events. In late 2016, it was announced that Elimination Chamber would return as a SmackDown-exclusive event in February 2017, but it switched to being Raw-exclusive in February 2018, which was the last brand-exclusive Elimination Chamber event, as following WrestleMania 34 that year, brand-exclusive pay-per-views were discontinued.

=== Injuries ===

Triple H suffered an injury during the 2002 Survivor Series match with swelling on the inside of his throat which put pressure on his esophagus and trachea. This was caused after Rob Van Dam performed the Five Star Frog Splash off the top of one of the chambers. Triple H also expressed concern that he might have broken his wrist and noted anything could have caused it. Sheamus reportedly suffered a concussion during the Raw Elimination Chamber match in 2010. Also in 2010, The Undertaker was involved in a pyrotechnics accident during his ring entrance. He was temporarily engulfed in flames on three occasions when the pyrotechnics were mistimed and his jacket briefly caught on fire. He suffered first and second-degree burns to his neck and chest and according to a WWE spokesperson the injury &quot;looked like a bad sunburn&quot;. He was only allowed to participate in the match after being cleared by a ringside doctor and was given bottles of water throughout the match to douse himself with to alleviate the discomfort. Acknowledging the concern, WWE now had padded the steel floor of the chamber.

=== Rules ===
The Elimination Chamber match is a variation of elimination-based matches which draws elements from steel cage and Hell in a Cell matches in that the wrestling ring is surrounded by a large steel-fenced cage supported by girders. Originally, its design was a circular-like chain-linked structure, but since 2017 it is now square and encloses the ring. Its floor is platformed over the ringside area around the ring which elevates and levels it with the ring mat. Within the Elimination Chamber, four enclosures, referred to as inner chambers or pods, are encased in plexiglass and face the outside of each ring post. The match is contested by six or seven participants: two or three starting in the ring, while the other four are held within each inner chamber. The Elimination Chamber in February 2018 featured a seven-man chamber match in which three participants began. At regular intervals, one of the four participants within an inner chamber enters the match. This continues until all four have been released. The entrance intervals are typically five minutes, though four and three minute gaps have also been used.

The objective of the match is to eliminate each opponent from the match by scoring a pinfall or a submission. These can occur in the ring or on the chamber&#x27;s elevated floor, but starting with the 2010 event all pinfalls and submissions must take place within the ring. Disqualifications and count-outs do not apply in the process of elimination. The winner of the match is the last remaining participant after all others have been eliminated (or after all members of the opposing tag team are eliminated in either the tag team matches or the twelve-on-twelve tornado tag team elimination matches). The same rules apply when the match involves six tag teams, where two teams start in the ring and a new team leaves the pod and enters the ring at regular intervals.

=== Structure ===

According to a &quot;WWE Magazine&quot; article in 2009 by WWE&#x27;s production designer Jason Robinson, who co-designed the structure, several designs for the Elimination Chamber were considered. The structure was manufactured in Colorado Springs, Colorado and took six to eight weeks to make from design blueprints. It cost US$ 250,000 to construct.

The structure is made of black-painted steel with an outer structure of 16 frames, each weighing . The chamber is high and in diameter and weighs a total of , 10 of which consists of steel. Each inner chamber consists of three large steel framed sheets of plexiglass, costing US$225 per sheet. The chains that surround the chamber stretch long and weigh .

A flatbed truck is needed to transport the chamber. Assembly in the arena takes eight hours to complete and eight motors are used to suspend the structure over the ring before each event. When not in use, the structure is stored at a dock in Newark, New Jersey. Unlike standard steel cage matches and Hell in a Cell matches, Elimination Chamber matches cannot be held at several arenas due to the structure&#x27;s massive size and weight, similar to how WarGames matches could only be held at certain arenas. This would play a factor in WWE dropping the annual Elimination Chamber event.

In 2017, the Elimination Chamber event returned (2017&#x27;s event was SmackDown-exclusive while 2018&#x27;s was Raw-exclusive). In addition, the chamber structure was redesigned, becoming square instead of circular. The pods were also changed from circular to square and feature sliding doors that referees slide open from outside the chamber. At the top of the chamber at its center which is now tall is a large cutout of the WWE logo. The steel grates between the ring and the cage were also replaced with padding. LED lights also line the corners of the structure. The redesign was for practical purposes due to certain venues only being able to house the previous structure, allowing most venues to host the Chamber.

=== Variations ===
The fifth match, held by the ECW brand at December to Dismember, was a slight variation called the Extreme Elimination Chamber. In this variation, each chamber had one of four weapons for the competitors locked inside to hold on to. When each competitor&#x27;s chamber opened, their weapon entered the match with them. The four weapons used in the match were a crowbar, a table, a steel folding chair, and a barbed wire-wrapped baseball bat.

The 2015 Elimination Chamber event saw another slight variation of the match, namely the tag team chamber match. Both team members were inside of their respective pods, for a total of six tag teams in the match. Two teams, totaling four individual participants, started the match. This match was for the WWE Tag Team Championship. This variation was repeated in 2019, but for women and to determine the inaugural holders of the WWE Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship. Another tag team chamber match happened in 2020 for the WWE SmackDown Tag Team Championship.

The 2018 Elimination Chamber featured the first seven-man chamber match. Due to the extra person, three competitors started the match instead of two. The 2018 event also featured the first women&#x27;s chamber match, but there were no variations in the rules.

=== Interference ===
Despite the structure, interference has become common inside the Elimination Chamber. At New Year&#x27;s Revolution in January 2005, Ric Flair distracted guest referee Shawn Michaels allowing Batista (who had been eliminated) to attack Randy Orton so Triple H could win the match. At No Way Out in February 2009, Edge attacked Kofi Kingston during his entrance and locked himself in one of the pods becoming a participant in the match for the World Heavyweight Championship after losing the WWE Championship earlier in the night. At Elimination Chamber in February 2010, Cody Rhodes passed Ted DiBiase Jr. a metal pipe which he used to eliminate Randy Orton in the match for the WWE Championship. Later in the night, Shawn Michaels broke into the chamber to cost The Undertaker his World Heavyweight Championship to Chris Jericho. At the Elimination Chamber event in February 2013, Mark Henry took out the remaining participants in the chamber for a World Heavyweight Championship match at WrestleMania 29 after being eliminated until SmackDown General Manager Booker T broke it up. At the Elimination Chamber for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship in February 2014, The Wyatt Family interfered by attacking John Cena, leading to his eventual elimination by Randy Orton. Kane would then come out to help escort The Wyatt Family out of the chamber, but would then interfere to cost Daniel Bryan the match to Orton. At the Elimination Chamber event in February 2023, Logan Paul interfered by sneaking into the chamber and attacking Seth &quot;Freakin&quot; Rollins, which subsequently allowed Austin Theory to retain the WWE United States Championship.

=== Match history ===
The Elimination Chamber debuted at WWE&#x27;s event Survivor Series at Madison Square Garden in November 2002. Since the inaugural match, there have been 33 other matches (34 overall) as of Elimination Chamber in February 2024. The Raw brand has been featured the most with 19 matches, including four joint-branded matches with SmackDown. ECW has been featured in two matches, including its joint-branded match with SmackDown. The SmackDown brand has been featured in 12 matches, including the joint-branded matches with both ECW and Raw. The Elimination Chamber event has featured more Elimination Chamber matches than any other WWE pay-per-view event, with 25 matches being held. Triple H has the most victories with 4. Randy Orton holds the distinction of being involved in the most Elimination Chamber matches to date with 9. Chris Jericho has eliminated the most wrestlers with 10. Braun Strowman and Shayna Baszler have the most eliminations in a single Elimination Chamber match (5); Baszler is also the only winner to eliminate all other opponents in a single match (Strowman&#x27;s five eliminations occurred during the seven-man Chamber match).

The majority of matches have been contested for a top-tier championship with the WWE Championship (once as the WWE World Heavyweight Championship) being contested for the most in nine matches. The original World Heavyweight Championship was contested the second-most in seven matches, while the ECW World Championship, WWE Tag Team Championship, SmackDown Tag Team Championship, Intercontinental Championship, Raw Women&#x27;s Championship, and United States Championship were contested in one match each. Ten matches (two in 2008, one in 2011, 2013, 2018, 2020, 2022, and 2023, and two in 2024) have awarded the winners the number-one contendership for the WWE Championship, original World Heavyweight Championship, WWE Universal Championship, Raw Women&#x27;s Championship, current World Heavyweight Championship, and Women&#x27;s World Championship, respectively, at those years&#x27; WrestleMania; in 2021, SmackDown&#x27;s Chamber match awarded the winner the number-one contendership for the Universal Championship that same night, which happened immediately after the Chamber match itself.

The Elimination Chamber match has been contested only in indoor arenas in the United States and once each in Puerto Rico, Saudi Arabia, and Canada, with the 2024 event in Australia being the first to be held in an outdoor venue. From 2008 to 2014, the match had been featured in February pay-per-view events only. An Elimination Chamber pay-per-view event took place on May 31, 2015, exclusively on the WWE Network and would also mark the first time the Chamber was used for a match that was not for a world championship or a future world championship match (although it would include the first ever tag team Elimination Chamber match). The Elimination Chamber in February 2018 featured the first seven-man Elimination Chamber match as well as the first Elimination Chamber match for women with the Raw Women&#x27;s Championship contested. The Elimination Chamber in February 2019 featured a tag team Elimination Chamber match, the second overall tag team chamber match, but this time for women to determine the inaugural holders of the WWE Women&#x27;s Tag Team Championship.

=== Compilation release ===
In July 2010, WWE released &quot;Satan&#x27;s Prison: The Anthology of the Elimination Chamber&quot;, a DVD featuring every Elimination Chamber match as of the 2010 Elimination Chamber. The European release of the DVD is titled &quot;Iron Will&quot;, primarily over the name change of the structure, match type and pay-per-view in Germany to avoid a brand blunder with the Elimination Chamber name as it may create imagery of gas chambers during The Holocaust (the Elimination Chamber pay-per-view, structure and match are called No Escape in Germany).

<text>A greengrocer is a person who owns or operates a shop selling primarily fruit and vegetables. The term may also be used to refer to a shop selling primarily produce. It is used predominantly in the United Kingdom and Australia.

In the United States, the terms &quot;produce store&quot; or &quot;produce shop&quot; are used. By the 1940s, produce sales (measured in tonnage) made at grocery stores had surpassed those made at produce stores.

While once common in the United Kingdom and Australia, the increase in popularity of supermarkets caused greengrocer shops to become rarer, though they may still be found in smaller towns and villages. Today, greengrocers can also be found in street markets, malls, and supermarket produce departments.

== Greengrocers&#x27; apostrophe ==
Because of its common misuse on greengrocers&#x27; signs (e.g &quot;apple&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;orange&#x27;s&quot;, or &quot;banana&#x27;s&quot;), an apostrophe used incorrectly to form a plural is known as a greengrocers&#x27; apostrophe.

<text>André was a lightweight English two-seater sports car manufactured from 1933 to 1934 in London W11 by T. B. André.

==The cars==
Only six of the automobiles, called the V6, which confusingly used a V-twin ohv JAP engine of 728cc, were ever built. Drive to the rear wheels was via a four speed gearbox. The floor pan acted also as the chassis and the suspension was by transverse leaf spring at the front and cantilevered springs at the rear. The car weighed 1170 pounds (531 kg) and was said to be able to achieve with an economy of .

==T. B. André==
Theodore Bernard André had previously been involved in the manufacture of the Marlborough car produced by Malicet et Blin between 1909 and 1926, having taken over the UK dealership in 1909. He was also involved in the manufacture of &quot;Silent-bloc&quot; rubber bushed bearings; &quot;Hartford&quot; shock absorbers; &quot;Len Brake Co&quot; brake shoes; plus the Marlborough-Thomas from 1923-24.

<doc id="854991" wikidata="Q242466" url="?curid=854991" title="Lucilla">
<text>Annia Aurelia Galeria Lucilla or Lucilla (7 March 148 or 150 – 182) was the second daughter of Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius and Roman empress Faustina the Younger. She was the wife of her father&#x27;s co-ruler and adoptive brother Lucius Verus and an elder sister to later emperor Commodus. Commodus ordered Lucilla&#x27;s execution after a failed assassination and coup attempt when she was about 33 years old.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Rome into the empire&#x27;s ruling family, Lucilla was a younger twin with her elder brother Gemellus Lucillae, who died around 150. Lucilla&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Roman emperor Antoninus Pius and Roman empress Faustina the Elder and her paternal grandparents were Domitia Lucilla and praetor Marcus Annius Verus.

==Marriages and ascension to Empress==

In 161, when she was between 11 and 13 years old, Lucilla&#x27;s father arranged a marriage for her with his co-ruler Lucius Verus. Verus, 18 years her senior, became her husband three years later in Ephesus in 164. At this marriage, she received her title of &quot;Augusta&quot; and became a Roman empress. At the same time, Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus were fighting a Parthian war in Syria.

Lucilla and Lucius Verus had three children: 
* Aurelia Lucilla was born in 165 in Antioch
* Lucilla Plautia
* Lucius Verus

Aurelia and Lucius died young.

Lucilla was an influential and respectable woman and she enjoyed her status. She spent much time in Rome, while Verus was away from Rome much of the time, fulfilling his duties as a co-ruler. Lucius Verus died around 168/169 while returning from the war theater in the Danube region, and as a result, Lucilla lost her status as empress.
As an unattached link to Emperor Aurelius and to the late co-emperor Verus and because of her royal-born offspring, Lucilla was not destined for a long widowhood. A short time later, in 169, her father arranged a second marriage for her with Tiberius Claudius Pompeianus Quintianus from Antioch. He was a Syrian Roman who was twice consul and a political ally to her father, but Lucilla and her mother were against the marriage as a less than ideal match, partly because Quintianus was at least twice Lucilla&#x27;s age, but also because he was not of her own Roman &quot;nobilis&quot; social rank though he was descended from rulers in the East. They married nonetheless and, about a year later, in 170, Lucilla bore him a son named Pompeianus.

==Rise of Commodus==
In 172, Lucilla and Quintianus accompanied Marcus Aurelius to Vindobona (now Vienna) in support of the Danube military campaign and were with him on 17 March 180, when Aurelius died and Commodus became the new emperor. The change ended any hope of Lucilla becoming empress again and she and Quintianus returned to Rome.

Lucilla was not happy living the quiet life of a private citizen in Rome, and hated her sister-in-law Bruttia Crispina. Over time, Lucilla became very concerned with her brother Commodus&#x27; erratic behaviour and its resulting effect on the stability of the empire.

==Plot to assassinate Commodus==
In light of her brother&#x27;s unstable rule, in 182 Lucilla became involved in a plot to assassinate Commodus and replace him with her husband and herself as the new rulers of Rome. Her co-conspirators included Publius Tarrutenius Paternus the Praetorian prefect, her daughter Plautia from her first marriage, a nephew of Quintianus also called Quintianus, and her paternal cousins, the former consul Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus and his sister Ummidia Cornificia Faustina.

Quintianus&#x27; nephew, brandishing a dagger or sword, bungled the assassination attempt. As he burst forth from his hiding place to commit the deed, he boasted to Commodus &quot;Here is what the Senate sends to you&quot;, giving away his intentions before he had the chance to act. Commodus&#x27;s guards were faster than Quintianus and the would-be assassin was overpowered and disarmed without injuring the emperor.

Commodus ordered the deaths of Quintianus&#x27; nephew and of Marcus Ummidius Quadratus Annianus, and banished Lucilla, her daughter, and Ummidia Cornificia Faustina to the Italian island of Capri. He sent a centurion there to execute them later that year. Her son Pompeianus was later murdered by Caracalla.

==In popular culture==
* In the 1964 film &quot;The Fall of the Roman Empire&quot;, Lucilla is played by Sophia Loren, her part in the film&#x27;s plot bearing only a very loose relation to Lucilla&#x27;s real life.
* In the 2000 film &quot;Gladiator&quot; and its 2024 sequel&quot;,&quot; Lucilla is played by Connie Nielsen.
* In the 2016 six-part docuseries &quot;Roman Empire: Reign of Blood,&quot; Lucilla is played by Tai Berdinner-Blades.

<doc id="854993" wikidata="Q1063471" url="?curid=854993" title="Jefferson disk">
<text>The Jefferson disk, also called the Bazeries cylinder or wheel cypher, was a cipher system commonly attributed to Thomas Jefferson that uses a set of wheels or disks, each with letters of the alphabet arranged around their edge in an order, which is different for each disk and is usually ordered randomly.

Each disk is marked with a unique number, and a hole in the center of the disks allows them to be stacked on an axle. The disks are removable and can be mounted on the axle in any order desired. The order of the disks is the cipher key, and both sender and receiver must arrange the disks in the same predefined order. Jefferson&#x27;s device had 36 disks while Bazeries&#x27; system had 20.

Once the disks have been placed on the axle in the agreed order, the sender rotates each disk up and down until a desired message is spelled out in one row. Then, the sender can copy down any row of text on the disks other than the one that contains the plaintext message. The recipient has to arrange the disks in the agreed-upon order, rotate the disks so they spell out the encrypted message on one row, and then look around the rows until they see the plaintext.

== History ==
In the late 18th century combination locks, known in Europe since 15th century, were popularized by Edmé Régnier L&#x27;Aîné, and versions of them with letters have been suggested to be the origin of cipher machines.

The first prototype resembling the Jefferson disk was invented by Swedish baron F. Gripenstierna in 1786, but it operated on a different principle: rather than substitute letters with letters, it used 57 disks to substitute letters entered by a cleared official on the one side of device with numbers on the other side of device visible to a clerk.

At some point in the 1790s (exact date is not clear) Thomas Jefferson described the device now named after him, with 26 letters on a wheel and estimated 36 to 48 wheels, and its operation in a manuscript. It&#x27;s commonly claimed that he invented it himself but it is not backed by any evidence, and Jefferson himself didn&#x27;t imply so in the text. The manuscript was apparently forgotten until it was discovered in 1922 (a year after M-94 entered service, see below) by historian Edmund C. Burnett studying the Continental Congress. It doesn&#x27;t appear that the device was ever fabricated, and Jefferson abandoned the idea after receiving a description of columnar transposition cipher from Robert Patterson in 1803, which he found more practical.

In the early 1980s NSA acquired for its museum a large incomplete device of Jefferson&#x27;s type (picture 1 of this article) with 35 remnant disks (out of 40 originally) and 42 characters, including French letters, on each. It was dated to the second quarter of the 19th century and it&#x27;s not clear if it is related to Jefferson despite originating from West Virginia.

When in 1854 Bristol dentist John H. B. Thwaites submitted a &quot;new&quot; cipher (which was in fact just a variant of the Vigenère cipher) to the &quot;Journal of the Society of the Arts&quot;, Charles Babbage mentioned in his response that he likes to use &quot;rings of box-wood placed side by side on a cylinder, and having the twenty-six letters on the circumference of each&quot;. However, it&#x27;s not clear from this description whether the letters were in alphabetic or random order.

=== Basis for later military ciphers ===
A device mechanically similar to Jefferson&#x27;s but somewhat improved was independently re-invented in 1891 by Commandant Etienne Bazeries, but did not become well known until he broke the Great Cipher, of Rossignols. In 1893, French mathematician Arthur Joseph Hermann (better known for founding Éditions Hermann) redesigned the device to use 18 flat wooden or cardboard strips. Cryptologists in other countries also considered similar devices.

The Bazeries cylinder was the basis for the US &quot;M-94&quot; cipher machine, which was introduced in 1922 and remained in service until 1942. In 1914, Parker Hitt experimented with the Bazeries device, building one prototype using slides on a wooden frame, with the cipher alphabets printed twice consecutively on the slides, and then another using disks of wood. He forwarded his experiments up the Signal Corps chain of command, and in 1917 Joseph Mauborgne refined the scheme, with the final result being the M-94.

The M-94 used 25 aluminium disks on a spindle. It was used by the Army, Coast Guard, and the Radio Intelligence Division of the Federal Communications Commission until early in World War II. The Army changed back to Hitt&#x27;s original slide scheme with the &quot;M-138-A&quot; cipher machine, which was introduced in the 1930s and was used by the US Navy and US State Department through World War II. The M-138-A featured 100 strips, with 30 selected for use in any one cipher session. It was an improvement in security for the State Department, which during the interwar years had used insecure codes, even in one case a standard commercial telegraph code.

== Example of operation ==

To encrypt a message, the encrypter rotates the disks to produce the plaintext message along one &quot;row&quot; of the stack of disks, and then selects another row as the ciphertext. To decrypt the message, the decrypter rotates the disks on his cylinder to produce the ciphertext along a row. Decryption is easier if both the encrypter and the decrypter know the offset of the row, but not necessary since the decrypter can look around the cylinder to find a row that makes sense.

For example, a simplified &quot;toy&quot; Bazeries cylinder using only ten disks might be organized as shown below, with each disk &quot;unwrapped&quot; into a line and each marked with a designating number:

If the &quot;key&quot;, the sequence of disks, for this Bazeries cylinder is 
and the encrypter wants to send the message &quot;&quot; to the decrypter, the encrypter rearranges the disks as per the key and rotates each disk to obtain the plaintext, which is shown at the left, with spacing added for clarity:

The encrypter then selects the ciphertext from the sixth row of the cylinder up from the plaintext. This ciphertext is also highlighted above with spacing, and gives: . When the decrypter gets the ciphertext, they rearrange the disks on their cylinder to the key arrangement, rotate the disks to give the ciphertext, and then read the plaintext six rows down from the ciphertext, or look over the cylinder for a row that makes sense.

== Cryptanalysis ==

The Bazeries cylinder was a relatively strong system at the time (compared to many other systems in use), and Etienne Bazeries, a French military cryptanalyst, is said to have regarded it as indecipherable. The &quot;Pers Z S&quot; code-breaking group of the German Foreign Office cracked the M-138-A in 1944. However, by that time the Americans had more sophisticated cipher systems in operation.

The French cryptographer Gaetan de Viaris (a.k.a. Marquis Gaetan Henri Leon Viarizio di Lesegno), who is famous for one of the first printing cipher devices (1874), solved the Bazeries cylinder in 1893.

One major weakness of the Bazeries cylinder is that the offset from the plaintext letter to the ciphertext letter for the cipher alphabet on each disk will be exactly the same. In the example shown above, this offset is six letters.

For example, if a cryptanalyst found a message encrypted on the ten-disk Bazeries cylinder described in the example above and has captured their own cylinder, they could decipher the message by entering it on their cylinder and rotating it until they found the message. Still, the number of possible permutations of the disks of the example Bazeries cylinder is . Due to the large size of this number, trial and error testing of the arrangement of the disks is difficult to perform by hand.

<text>Anglada was a Spanish automobile manufactured in Puerto de Santa María in Cádiz, Andalucia from 1902 to 1905.
The company named &quot; Anglada. Fábrica de bicicletas y automóviles&quot; was founded by &quot;Francisco Anglada y Gallardo&quot;. Anglada made expensive cars by individual order. The cars were either one- or four-cylinder models ranging from 6 to 36 cv. 
Anglada is notable today, if at all, for producing the first Spanish car purchased by Alfonso XIII; the King bought a four from the company in 1904. Although the Spanish aristocrats bought some cars, due to financial problems, Francisco Anglada soon gave up production. He opened an automobile repair shop in Madrid. Francisco Anglada died in 1917.

<doc id="855002" wikidata="Q337343" url="?curid=855002" title="Alfredo Casella">
<text>Alfredo Casella (25 July 18835 March 1947) was an Italian composer, pianist and conductor.

== Life and career ==
Casella was born in Turin, the son of Maria (née Bordino) and Carlo Casella. His family included many musicians: his grandfather, a friend of Paganini, was first cello in the San Carlo Theatre in Lisbon and eventually became soloist in the Royal Chapel in Turin. Alfredo&#x27;s father, Carlo, was also a professional cellist, as were Carlo&#x27;s brothers Cesare and Gioacchino; his mother was a pianist, who gave the boy his first music lessons.

Alfredo entered the Conservatoire de Paris in 1896 to study piano under Louis Diémer and composition under Gabriel Fauré; in these classes, Lazare Lévy, George Enescu and Maurice Ravel were among his fellow students. During his Parisian period, Claude Debussy, Igor Stravinsky and Manuel de Falla were acquaintances, and he was also in contact with Ferruccio Busoni, Gustav Mahler and Richard Strauss.

Casella developed a deep admiration for Debussy&#x27;s output after hearing &quot;Prélude à l&#x27;après-midi d&#x27;un faune&quot; in 1898, but pursued a more romantic vein (stemming from Strauss and Mahler) in his own writing of this period, rather than turning to impressionism. His first symphony of 1905 is from this time, and it is with this work that Casella made his debut as a conductor when he led the symphony&#x27;s premiere in Monte Carlo in 1908.

Back in Italy during World War I, he began teaching piano at the Conservatorio Santa Cecilia in Rome. From 1927 to 1929 Casella was the principal conductor of the Boston Pops, where he was succeeded by Arthur Fiedler. He was one of the best-known Italian piano virtuosos of his generation and together with Arturo Bonucci (cello) and Alberto Poltronieri (violin) he formed the Trio Italiano in 1930. This group played to great acclaim in Europe and America. His stature as a pianist and his work with the trio gave rise to some of his best-known compositions, including &quot;A Notte Alta&quot;, the Sonatina, &quot;Nove Pezzi&quot;, and the Six Studies, Op. 70, for piano. For the trio to play on tour, he wrote the &quot;Sonata a Tre&quot; and the Triple Concerto.

Casella had his biggest success with the ballet &quot;La Giara&quot;, set to a scenario by Luigi Pirandello; other notable works include &quot;Italia&quot;, the &quot;Concerto Romano&quot; (commissioned by Rodman Wanamaker and premiered at the Wanamaker Auditorium in New York with the organ and Wanamaker collection of rare string instruments), &quot;Partita&quot; and &quot;Scarlattiana&quot; for piano and orchestra, the Violin and Cello Concerti, &quot;Paganiniana&quot;, and the Concerto for Piano, Strings, Timpani and Percussion. Amongst his chamber works, both Cello Sonatas are played with some frequency, as is the very beautiful late Harp Sonata, and the music for flute and piano. Casella also made live-recording player piano music rolls for the Aeolian Duo-Art system, all of which survive today and can be heard. In 1923, together with Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio and Gian Francesco Malipiero from Venice, he founded an association to promote the spread of modern Italian music, the &quot;Corporation of the New Music&quot;.

The resurrection of Antonio Vivaldi&#x27;s works in the 20th century is mostly thanks to the efforts of Casella, who in 1939 organised the now historic &quot;Vivaldi Week&quot;, in which the poet Ezra Pound was also involved. Since then Vivaldi&#x27;s compositions have enjoyed almost universal success and the advent of historically informed performance has only strengthened his position. In 1947 the Venetian businessman Antonio Fanna founded the Istituto Italiano Antonio Vivaldi, with the composer Malipiero as its artistic director, to promote Vivaldi&#x27;s music and put out new editions of his works. Casella&#x27;s work on behalf of his Italian Baroque musical ancestors put him at the centre of the early 20th-century Neoclassical revival in music and influenced his own compositions profoundly. His editions of Johann Sebastian Bach and Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s piano works, along with many others, proved extremely influential on the musical taste and performance style of Italian players in the following generations.

The &quot;generazione dell&#x27;ottanta&quot; (&quot;generation of the &#x27;80s&quot;), including Casella himself, Malipiero, Respighi, Pizzetti, and Alfano—all composers born around 1880, the post-Puccini generation—concentrated on writing instrumental works, rather than operas, which Puccini and his musical forebears had specialised in. Members of this generation were the dominant figures in Italian music after Puccini&#x27;s death in 1924; they had their counterparts in Italian literature and painting.

Casella, who was especially passionate about painting, accumulated an important collection of art and sculptures. He was perhaps the most &quot;international&quot; in outlook and stylistic influences of the &quot;generazione dell&#x27;ottanta&quot;, owing at least in part to his early musical training in Paris and the circle in which he lived and worked while there. He died in Rome.

Casella&#x27;s students included Clotilde Coulombe, Stefan Bardas, Maria Curcio, Francesco Mander, Branka Musulin, Maurice Ohana, Robin Orr, Primož Ramovš, Nino Rota, Maria Tipo, Gaetano Giuffrè, Camillo Togni, and Bruna Monestiroli.

===Marriage===
He was married in Paris in 1921 to Yvonne Müller (Paris 1892 – Rome 1977). Their granddaughter is actress Daria Nicolodi and their great-granddaughter is actress Asia Argento.

Casella, who identified for many years with the Fascist regime in Italy, found himself in conflict with it after the legislation of the Italian racial laws of 1938, his wife being Jewish of French origin. From 1943 he lived in constant fear of being torn from his wife and their daughter, who were subject to arrest and deportation. One evening, having been tipped off about a raid on their flat, the family split up and hid in the homes of friends, not to reassemble until the &#x27;Jew hunt&#x27; had ended.

<text>The Anglo-Dane was a Danish automobile manufactured by H. C. Fredriksen of Copenhagen from 1902 to 1917. Fredriksen began by building bicycles in the 1890s; for these, he used British parts - hence the hyphenated name.

The first cars were light trucks with single-cylinder Belgian Kelecom engines. Later cars were produced with their own design single-cylinder 4-5 hp engines; these featured friction drive using double discs to give an equivalent 12-speed transmission. A few passenger cars were also built with twin-cylinder engines before the company merged with automobile makers Jan and Thrige, which made Triangel commercial vehicles until 1945. About 70 Anglo-Danes were made.

<doc id="855005" wikidata="Q5154443" url="?curid=855005" title="Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists">
<text>Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists (CPRM) is a political party based in the Darjeeling District and Kalimpong District of the Indian state of West Bengal. CPRM was formed in 1996 by Communist Party of India (Marxist) dissidents (a major group of the local CPI(M) leadership in Darjeeling) like former State Minister and Rajya Sabha MP Tamang Dawa Lama, Lok Sabha MP R.B. Rai and others, who were dissatisfied with the peace settlement the Left-Front government signed with the Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF). CRPM participates in the Confederation of Indian Communists and Democratic Socialists. The youth organization of CPRM is called Democratic Revolutionary Youth Federation (DRYF).

CPRM struggles for a separate Gorkhaland state to be formed within India. It contested the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council election in 1999 but won no seat. Before 1999, one CPRM member, Padam Lama, was a member of the DGHC. Ahead of the 1999 DGHC elections, CPRM was part of the United Front, an alliance consisting of CPRM, Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League (ABGL), Indian National Congress, Bharatiya Gorkha Janashakti, Communist Party of India, Bharatiya Nepali Bir Gorkha and Sikkim Rashtriya Mukti Morcha.

Since the failure of the United Front, CPRM formed the People&#x27;s Democratic Front, as a united opposition to GNLF in the Darjeeling hills, together with Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League, Indian National Congress, Gorkha National Liberation Front (C.K. Pradhan) and Bharatiya Janata Party.

CPRM is currently part of the Democratic Front, an alliance of the CPRM, ABGL, BJP and other parties. CPRM had earlier supported the Gorkha Janmukti Morcha (GJM), but when GJM agreed to the setting up of an Interim Setup in Darjeeling instead of a full-fledged state of Gorkhaland, CPRM became opposed to it.

After unsuccessfully trying to put up consensus candidates in the three constituencies of Darjeeling with other parties, CPRM decided not to filed any candidates of its own after the other parties - GJM and ABGL - decided to fight the elections independently. In 2009, 2014 and 2019 general elections, they supported the Bharatiya Janata Party candidates for the Darjeeling constituency.

<doc id="855009" wikidata="Q234086" url="?curid=855009" title="Linda Gray">
<text>Linda Ann Gray (born September 12, 1940) is an American film, stage and television actress, director, producer and former model, best known for her role as Sue Ellen Ewing, the long-suffering wife of Larry Hagman&#x27;s character J.R. Ewing on the CBS television drama series &quot;Dallas&quot; (1978–1989, 1991, 2012–2014). The role also earned her a nomination for the 1981 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series as well as two Golden Globe Awards nominations.

Gray began her career in the 1960s in television commercials. In the 1970s, she appeared in numerous TV series before landing the role of Sue Ellen Ewing in 1978. After leaving &quot;Dallas&quot; in 1989, she appeared opposite Sylvester Stallone in the 1991 film &quot;Oscar&quot;. From 1994 to 1995, she played a leading role in the Fox drama series &quot;Models Inc.&quot;, and also starred in TV movies, including &quot;Moment of Truth: Why My Daughter?&quot; (1993) and &quot;Accidental Meeting&quot; (1994). She went on to reprise the role of Sue Ellen in &quot;&quot; (1996), &quot;&quot; (1998), and in the TNT series &quot;Dallas&quot; (2012–2014), which continued the original series.

On stage, Gray starred as Mrs. Robinson in &quot;The Graduate&quot; in the West End of London in 2001, then on Broadway the following year. In 2007, she starred as Aurora Greenaway in the world premiere production of &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot; at the Theatre Royal, York and stayed with the production when it toured the United Kingdom. After the second &quot;Dallas&quot; was cancelled in 2014, Gray again took to the stage, this time in the role of the Fairy Godmother in a London production of &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

==Early life ==
Linda Gray was born in 1940 in Santa Monica, California. She grew up in Culver City, California, where her father, Leslie, who was a watchmaker, had a shop.

Before acting, Gray worked as a model in the 1960s and began her acting career in television commercials, nearly 400 of them—and also made brief appearances in feature films, such as &quot;Under the Yum Yum Tree&quot; and &quot;Palm Springs Weekend&quot; in 1963.
==Career==
Gray began her professional acting career in the 1970s with guest roles on many television series such as &quot;Marcus Welby, M.D.&quot;, &quot;McCloud&quot;, and &quot;Switch&quot;, prior to signing with Universal Studios in 1974. She also appeared in the films &quot;The Big Rip-Off&quot; (1975) and &quot;Dogs&quot; (1976). In 1977, she was cast as fashion model Linda Murkland, the first transgender series regular on American television, in the television series &quot;All That Glitters&quot;. The show, a spoof of the soap-opera format, was cancelled after just 13 weeks. Gray was then cast as suspicious wife Carla Cord in the 1977 television movie &quot;Murder in Peyton Place&quot;.

===&quot;Dallas&quot;===

Gray achieved stardom for her role as Sue Ellen Ewing, J.R.&#x27;s long-suffering alcoholic wife, in the CBS drama series &quot;Dallas&quot; (1978–1989, 1991). Initially a recurring guest role for the five episodes (credited as the first season) in the original series, Gray became a series regular in 
the second season (1978-1979) and remained with the show until her departure in 1989. Her character was well-received by television critics. &quot;The Biography Channel&quot; stated &quot;Who could ever forget &quot;Dallas&quot; with the vodka-swilling Sue Ellen Ewing, replete with shoulder pads long before &quot;Dynasty&quot;, staggering around Southfork Ranch with a permanently tearful expression as she suffered the brunt of J.R. Ewing’s evil ways?&quot; &quot;The Boulevard&quot; stated &quot;It may be 2009 and seventeen years since the primetime drama &quot;Dallas&quot; went off the air, but memories of the Ewing family still linger. Corruption and betrayal, lies, greed, affairs and scandal—all were just part of another day at the Southfork Ranch. At the center of it all was one of our favorite Ewings, the person we couldn&#x27;t help but root for each week as she drank and slept her way through one ordeal after another. This, of course, was the tortured and (sometimes) villainous Sue Ellen Shepard Ewing, former Texas beauty queen and trophy wife of the womanizing rogue J.R. Ewing, played to perfection by actress Linda Gray.&quot; Gray was nominated for two Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama and Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series for her performance on &quot;Dallas&quot;. She also received numerous international awards including Germany&#x27;s Bambi Award, Italy&#x27;s Il Gato and she was named Woman of the Year by the Hollywood Radio &amp; Television Society in 1982.
===After &quot;Dallas&quot;===
After &quot;Dallas&quot;, Gray starred in the 1991 comedy film, &quot;Oscar&quot; with Sylvester Stallone and then made guest appearances in British drama &quot;Lovejoy&quot; (starring her co-star and love interest from her final season on &quot;Dallas&quot;, Ian McShane). She also starred in several made-for-TV movies, including 1991&#x27;s &quot;The Entertainers&quot; (with Bob Newhart), &quot;&quot; (1993), &quot;Moment of Truth: Why My Daughter&quot; (1993), and &quot;Accidental Meeting&quot; (1994). 
In 1994, she made several guest appearances on the Fox prime time soap opera &quot;Melrose Place&quot;, starring as Hillary Michaels, the mother of Amanda Woodward (Heather Locklear). She continued the role in the &quot;Melrose Place&quot; spin-off &quot;Models Inc.&quot;, where her character Hillary ran a modelling agency, but the show was cancelled after one season.
Gray appeared in the &quot;Dallas&quot; reunion television movies &quot;&quot; (1996) and &quot;&quot; (1998), but in the following years did not appear in movies or on television.

In 2001, Gray portrayed Mrs. Robinson in the West End theatre production of Charles Webb&#x27;s &quot;The Graduate&quot;. This brought her full circle, as her legs (not Anne Bancroft&#x27;s) had appeared in the poster for the 1967 film version of &quot;The Graduate&quot;, showing Mrs. Robinson&#x27;s legs being admired by Dustin Hoffman. She also briefly played the role in the Broadway production, when she filled-in for Kathleen Turner in September 2002. Gray made her theater directing debut with the play &quot;Murder in the First&quot;, and other stage acting work includes: &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;, &quot;The Vagina Monologues&quot;, &quot;Agnes of God&quot; and &quot;Love Letters&quot;.

===Recent years===
Gray returned to television in 2004 as a guest star in five episodes of the daytime soap opera &quot;The Bold and the Beautiful&quot;, playing Priscilla Kelly.
Gray starred in several independent films, including the award-winning drama &quot;Reflections of a Life&quot; (2006), where she played the best friend of a woman undergoing treatment for breast cancer; &quot;Expecting Mary&quot; (2010); &quot;The Flight of the Swan&quot; (2011); and &quot;Hidden Moon&quot; (2012).

In 2008, Gray appeared in The CW series &quot;90210&quot;, which, like &quot;Melrose Place&quot; and &quot;Models Inc.&quot; before it, is a spin-off from the original &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;. Gray has now appeared in three of the five series in the franchise, though her role in &quot;90210&quot; was not Hillary Michaels, the character she played on &quot;Melrose Place&quot; (1992) and &quot;Models Inc.&quot;

In 2012, Gray reprised her role as Sue Ellen Ewing in the TNT drama series &quot;Dallas&quot;, a continuation of the original series. In 2013, she was listed as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s by the &quot;Guardian&quot;. In April 2013, she was listed in &quot;People&quot; magazine&#x27;s annual Most Beautiful Woman list.

Over Christmas 2014, she performed in pantomime in London, playing the Fairy Godmother in &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

<text>Talbot-Lago was a French automobile manufacturer based in Suresnes, Hauts de Seine, outside Paris. The company was owned and managed by Antonio Lago, an Italian engineer that acquired rights to the Talbot brand name after the demise of Darracq London&#x27;s subsidiary Automobiles Talbot France in 1936.

Under Lago&#x27;s managing, the company produced a range of automobiles that included sport and racing cars, in some cases designed by coachbuild company Figoni et Falaschi. until the Talbot-Lago demise in 1959, when company&#x27;s financial problems forced Lago to sell it to Simca.

== Predecessors ==

===Alexandre Darracq===

The Suresnes factory had been built by Alexandre Darracq for his pioneering car manufacturing business begun in 1896, which he named A. Darracq &amp; Cie. It was very profitable. Alexandre Darracq built racing as well as &quot;pleasure&quot; cars and Darracq rapidly became famous for its motor racing successes. Darracq sold his remaining portion of his business in 1912.

===Talbot France===

New owners renamed the Darracq business Automobiles Talbot in 1922. However, though its ordinary production cars were badged as Talbots, the new owners continued incorporating the Darracq name in Talbot-Darracq for their competition cars.

Owing to the simultaneous existence of British Talbot cars, French products when sold in Britain were badged Darracq-Talbot or Talbot-Darracq, or even simply Darracq.

===Antonio Lago===
In 1932, after the onset of the Great Depression, Italo-British businessman Antonio Lago was appointed managing director in the hope that he might revive Automobiles Talbot&#x27;s business. Lago began this process, but the owners were unable to stave off receivership beyond the end of 1934. The receiver did not immediately close Automobiles Talbot, and in 1936 Antonio Lago managed to complete a management buy-out from the receiver.

== Reorganisation under Tony Lago ==
For 1935, the existing range continued in production but from 1936 these were steadily replaced with cars designed by Walter Becchia, featuring transverse leaf-sprung independent suspension. These included the 4-cylinder 2323 cc (13CV) Talbot Type T4 &quot;Minor&quot;, a surprise introduction at the 1937 Paris Motor Show, and the 6-cylinder 2,696 cc (15CV) Talbot &quot;Cadette-15&quot;, along with and the 6-cylinder 2,996 cc or 3,996 cc (17 or 23CV) Talbot &quot;Major&quot; and its long-wheelbase version, the Talbot &quot;Master&quot;: these were classified as Touring cars (&quot;voitures de tourisme&quot;).

There was also in the second half of the 1930s a range of Sporting cars (&quot;voitures de sport&quot;) which started with the Talbot &quot;Baby-15&quot;, mechanically the same as the &quot;Cadette-15&quot; but using a shorter slightly lighter chassis. The Sporting Cars range centred on the 6-cylinder 2,996 cc or 3,996 cc (17 or 23CV) Talbot &quot;Baby&quot; and also included the 3,996 cc (23CV) 23 and sporting Lago-Spéciale and Lago-SS models, respectively with two and three carburettors, and corresponding increases in power and performance. The most frequently specified body for the Lago-SS was built by Figoni et Falaschi, and featured a particularly eye-catching aerodynamic form.

Lago was an excellent engineer who developed the existing six-cylinder engine into a high-performance 4-litre one. The sporting six-cylinder models had a great racing history. The bodies—such as of the T150 coupé—were made by excellent coachbuilders such as Figoni et Falaschi or Saoutchik.

===Talbot-Lago models 1935–1940===
Although the proliferation of cars types and model names that followed Lago&#x27;s acquisition of the business is at first glance bewildering, it actually involved only four standard chassis lengths as follows:

: Short Châssis ( wheelbase):
:: Minor T4 (4 cylinders, 2323 cc)
:: Junior 11
:: Baby-15 (6 cylinders, 2696 cc)
:: Baby 3 litres (6 cylinders, 2996 cc)
:: T150 3 litres (6 cylinders, 2996 cc)
:: Baby 4 litres (6 cylinders, 3996 cc)
:: Lago Spécial (6 cylinders, 3996 cc with twin or triple carbs)
: Extra short Châssis ( wheelbase):
:: Lago SS (6 cylinders, 3996 cc with triple carbs)
: Normal Châssis ( wheelbase):
:: Cadette-15 (6 cylinders, 2696 cc)
:: Major 3 litres (6 cylinders, 2996 cc)
:: Major 4 litres (6 cylinders, 3996 cc)
: Long (7-seater) Châssis ( wheelbase):
:: Master 3 litres (6 cylinders, 2996 cc)
:: Master 4 litres (6 cylinders, 3996 cc)

During the early years of the war Walter Becchia left Talbot to work for Citroen, but Lago was joined in 1942 by another exceptional engineer, Carlo Machetti, and from then the two of them were working on the twin camshaft 4483 cc six-cylinder unit that would lie at the heart of the 1946 Talbot T26.

==After World War II==
After the war, the company continued to be known both for successful high-performance racing cars and for large luxurious passenger cars, with extensive sharing of chassis and engine components between the two. Nevertheless, the period was one of economic stagnation and financial stringency. The company had difficulty finding customers, and its finances were stretched.

In 1946, the company began production of a new engine design, based on earlier units but with a new cylinder head featuring twin in-block camshafts. This engine, designed under the leadership of Carlo Marchetti, was in many respects a new engine. A 4483 cc six-cylinder in-line engine was developed for the Talbot Lago Record (1946–1952) and for the Talbot Grand Sport 26CV (1947–1954). These cars were priced against large luxurious cars from the likes of Delahaye, Delage, Hotchkiss and Salmson. Talbot would remain in the auto-making business for longer than any of these others, and the Talbot name was resurrected in the early 1980s.

===Talbot Lago Record T26===
The &quot;Talbot Lago Record T26&quot; was a large car with a fiscal horsepower of 26 CV and a claimed actual power output of 170 hp, delivered to the rear wheels via a four-speed manual gear box, with the option at extra cost of a Wilson pre-selector gear box, and supporting a claimed top speed of 170 km/h (105 mph). The car was commonly sold as a stylish four-door sedan, but a two-door cabriolet was also offered. There were also coachbuilt specials with bodywork by traditionalist firms such as Graber.

===Talbot Lago Grand Sport T26===

The &quot;T26 Grand Sport (GS)&quot; was first displayed in public in October 1947 as a shortened chassis, and only 12 were made during 1948 which was the models&#x27;s first full year of production. The car was noted for its speed. The engine which produced 170 hp in the Lago Record was adapted to provide or, later, in the GS, and a top speed of around 200 km/h (124 mph) was claimed, depending on the body that was fitted. The car was built for either racing or luxury and benefited directly from Talbot&#x27;s successful T26C Grand Prix car. As such it was expensive, rare and helped Louis Rosier with his son to win the LeMans 24 Hour race in 1950. The GS replaced the Lago-Record chassis which was named for its remarkable top speed. The GS was one of the world&#x27;s most powerful production cars at the time. It had several special features from the T26 Grand Prix cars, such as a 4.5-litre inline-6 aluminum cylinder head, a hollowed camshaft, multiport exhaust system and triple carburetors. Chassis details were similar to the Grand Prix cars, but it was longer and wider. It came it two wheelbase lengths -104 and .

Almost all the Talbots sold during the late 1940s came with Talbot bodies, constructed in the manufacturer&#x27;s extensive workshops. The T26 Grand Sport (GS) was the exception, however, and cars were delivered only as bare chassis, requiring customers to choose bespoke bodywork from a specialist coachbuilder. The GS was a star turn in a dull world and coachbuilders such as Saoutchik, Franay, Oblin, and Figoni et Falaschi competed to trump Talbot&#x27;s own designers with elaborately elegant bodies.

===Talbot Lago Baby===

The Talbot Lago Baby (1948–1951) marked the return of a pre-war Talbot model name and was the third model presented by the company during the 1940s. The car was commonly sold as a four-door sedan, but a two-door cabriolet was also offered. Its engine comprised only four cylinders, but the twin overhead camshaft with cylinder valves on both sides of the engine block was again featured: at 2690 cc the engine capacity equated to a fiscal horsepower of 15 CV, which was enough to attract the punitive levels of car tax applied by the French government to large cars. The power output was initially , which in 1949 was increased to . Although the postwar Baby sedan closely resembled the more powerful Record on a brief glance, the Baby&#x27;s 2,950 mm wheelbase was slightly shorter than the 3130 mm wheelbase of the Record, and the overall length was correspondingly 200 mm shorter, reflecting the shortened 4-cylinder engine block. Additionally, the cheaper car sat on a simplified suspension set-up. Baby customers could specify as an option a Wilson pre-selector gear box.

Talbot Lago manufactured three special made seven-seater presidential cars; one for the President of France, one for the President of Tunisia and one for the royal family in Saudi Arabia.

===Talbot-Lago T26C===
The Talbot-Lago T26C is an open-wheel formula race car, designed and developed by French manufacturer Talbot-Lago, and built to the new Formula One racing rules and regulations, in 1948.

===New bodies for 1952===
In 1951, as rumours of the company&#x27;s financial difficulties intensified, a new Ponton format body appeared for the Talbot Baby and Record. The wheelbases were carried over from the earlier models. Although in many ways strikingly modern, the new car featured a two piece front windscreen in place of the single flat screen of its predecessor, presumably reflecting the difficulties at the time of combining the strength of a windscreen with curved glass at an acceptable price and quality. The new car&#x27;s large rear window was itself replaced by a larger three-piece &quot;panoramic&quot; wrap around back window as part of the car&#x27;s first face-lift, which took place in time for the 1952 Paris Motor Show. The engine specification of the four-cylinder unit was unchanged as was the claimed performance even though the new body was some 100 kg heavier than the old. A new development with the Ponton-bodied cars body was the availability of the larger six-cylinder unit from the Talbot Record in the top-of-the-line Talbot Baby, which in this form was called the Talbot Baby/6 Luxe, and had the slightly longer wheel-base and overall length enforced by the greater length of the six-cylinder engine.

===T14 LS engine / Talbot Lago Sport===
At the 1954 Salon de L&#x27;Automobile de Paris, Talbot-Lago presented their last new engine: the new four-cylinder still had the typical twin laterally mounted camshafts, although it was upgraded to five main bearings. The new 2,491 cc engine was called the T14 LS, but it did not have a car to go in until May 1955 when the Talbot-Lago 2500 Coupé T14 LS was finally presented. The first car had all-aluminium bodywork, but later cars used more steel. Fifty-four of these coupés were built, but they proved hard to sell - the stylish bodywork couldn&#x27;t quite hide the thirties&#x27; underpinnings, and the rough engine offered little elasticity nor longevity.

Lacking the resources to engineer the necessary improvements, for 1957 Talbot-Lago had to resort to buying in an engine. They chose the V8 2580 cc made available by BMW, albeit with the bore diameter slightly reduced, to 72.5 mm, which gave rise to a 2476 cc engine displacement, positioning the car (just) within the 14CV car tax band. Reflecting the company&#x27;s export plans, Talbot now rebranded the car as the &quot;Talbot Lago America&quot; and (finally) came into line with other French automakers by placing the driver on the left side of the car. However, market response remained lukewarm, and only about a dozen of the BMW powered Talbot Lago Americas were produced. In the early summer of 1958, Tony Lago decided to accept an offer from Simca president, Henri Pigozzi, for the sale of the Talbot brand to Simca. The sale of the business went ahead in 1959.

With the sale of the business to Simca, the new owners found themselves with a handful of the final Talbot Lago Americas which were awaiting engines. There was now no question of Simca being permitted, or wishing, to produce cars with BMW engines, and the only solution available was to fit the last batch of cars with Simca&#x27;s own 2351 cc V8. This engine had its roots in 1930s Detroit, and was originally provided by Ford to give the (then) Ford Vedette produced by their French subsidiary a flavor of the driving experience offered by an unstressed US style V8 sedan. It was by no stretch of the imagination an engine for a sports car, and even with a second carburetor produced only , as against the of the BMW-engined cars from the previous year&#x27;s production. Claimed top speed was now 165 km/h (103 mph) in place of the 200 km/h (124 mph) listed the previous year. At the 1959 Paris Motor Show a stand had been booked for what was by now the Simca-Talbot brand, but a late decision was taken not to exhibit a Lago America and the stand was instead given up to a hastily constructed &quot;motor show special&quot; prototype of which, after the motor show, nothing more would be heard.

==Commercial and financial==
Sales data by model were kept confidential, possibly in connection with the company&#x27;s financial difficulties, but the overall totals for the early 1950s tell a dire story. The Suresnes plant produced 155 cars in 1947, an output which increased by 23 in 1948. 433 cars were produced in 1950, but this then fell to 80 in 1951 and to 34 in 1952. In 1953 it is thought that the company turned out just 13 of the 26CV Record model and 4 of the 15 CV Babys. During the rest of the decade volumes did not recover significantly; no more than 54 of the T14 LS were built in 1955 and 1956.

As the company&#x27;s commercial trajectory implies, the years following the end of the war were marked by the slow financial collapse of Anthony Lago&#x27;s Talbot company. Other luxury automakers whose glory years had been the 1930s fared no better in the 1940s and 1950s than Talbot, with Delage, Delahaye, Hotchkiss and Bugatti disappearing from the car business while Panhard, nimbly if slightly improbably, reinvented itself as a manufacturer of small fuel efficient cars. Customers with enough money to spend on a luxury car were hard to find, and even among those with sufficient funds, in a country where well into the 1950s the Communists, buoyed by the heroic role played by some of their leaders during the years of Resistance, regularly polled 25% of the vote in national elections, there was little of the &quot;live for today: pay later&quot; spirit that had supported extravagant spending patterns in the 1930s. Government policy supported the austerity by creating a post-war tax regime that savagely penalised owners of cars with engines above two litres in size, and an Economic Plan, the Pons Plan, which bestowed government favour (and allocations of materials still in short supply such as steel) on just five automakers, these being the businesses that became France&#x27;s big five automakers in the 1950s and early 60s. For France&#x27;s other luxury automakers, meanwhile, including Talbot, the tide had simply gone out.

The money ran out, and Anthony Lago was obliged to seek court protection from his creditors, under a procedure known at that time as a ”Dépôt de bilan”. On 6 March 1951 the court agreed a debt moratorium which permitted a limited restart to production at the company&#x27;s Suresnes plant, but the affair provided unwelcome publicity for Talbot&#x27;s cash flow problems, and the company now experienced increased difficulty in obtaining credit. Production was also limited by the extent to which it had been necessary to cut the workforce, and by the reputational damage caused by reports of the whole process.

The business staggered on till 1959, but never had the financial strength to support the development and production of its last model, the Talbot-Lago 2500 Coupé T14 LS, launched after a lengthy gestation in May 1955. In 1958 Lago decided to throw in the sponge and put the business up for sale. An offer was received from Henri Pigozzi under the terms of which the remains of the Talbot business would become part of Simca. In order to avoid bankruptcy, Lago agreed to sell the business on the terms proposed by the Simca president-director, a fellow Italian expatriate. Talbot-Lago was transferred to Simca in 1959. Despite the sorry state of the Talbot business during the preceding ten years, commentators suggest that Pigozzi got a good bargain, receiving at Suresnes an industrial site and buildings worth many times the amount paid, along with a brand name that still resonated strongly with anyone old enough to remember the glory days of Talbot.

Tony Lago died in 1960.

==Today==
Talbot-Lagos have become a top-prized car at various auctions. A Figoni et Falaschi-bodied T150C SS Teardrop Coupe, owned by Brooks Stevens, would sell for US$3,535,000 at Christie&#x27;s Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance auction on 18 August 2005, another for US$3,905,000 at the Palm Beach International Concours d&#x27;Elegance Gooding &amp; Company auction on 22 January 2006, where it was unanimously voted &quot;Best in Show&quot;, and another for US$4,620,000 at the Pebble Beach Concours d&#x27;Elegance RM Auctions Sports &amp; Classics of Monterey auction on 14 August 2010. A T150 C SS with a Pourtout Aerocoupé body, designed by Georges Paulin, sold for US$4,847,000 at the 2008 Bonhams &amp; Butterfields Sale of Exceptional Motorcars and Automobilia at Quail Lodge.

An unrestored 1948 T26 Grand Sport, with coachwork by Oblin and chassis #110106, is a part of the permanent collection of the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia, PA, USA.

A 1949 Talbot-Lago T26 Grand Sport Coupé by Saoutchik
from the Baillon Collection sold for €1,450,000 at the Artcurial auction in February 2015.

Even Talbot-Lagos with factory bodies, rather than custom coachwork, are highly valued; a factory-bodied 1939 T150 C SS selling in 2013 for US$418,000 at the Gooding &amp; Company Scottsdale auction.

<doc id="855016" wikidata="Q1165867" url="?curid=855016" title="Save Ferris">
<text>Save Ferris is an American ska punk band formed circa 1995 in Orange County, California, United States. Their name is a reference to the 1986 film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. In 1995, the band began to perform underground venues in Southern California. In 1996, the band won a Grammy showcase award for best unsigned band and a contract with Epic Records. Their album &quot;It Means Everything&quot; from 1997 was their first full-length album. By 1999, the band moved from ska-pop into pop-punk. After a hiatus, in 2017, Save Ferris released the &quot;Checkered Past&quot; EP.

The band is best remembered for their 1997 cover of &quot;Come On Eileen&quot;, originally by the British new wave band Dexys Midnight Runners.

==History==
===1995–1996: Early years and &quot;Introducing Save Ferris&quot; EP===
The band came together after the dissolution of a number of Orange County, California bands. With the band working together under their own “Starpool” label, they began to book shows around Southern California to a great underground response.

The band released their debut EP &quot;Introducing Save Ferris&quot; on their own label, Starpool Records in 1996, and ended up selling close to 20,000 copies of their EP “out of the trunks of their cars.” That year, Monique Powell provided vocals on the Reel Big Fish song &quot;She Has A Girlfriend Now&quot; from their album &quot;Turn the Radio Off&quot; (Mojo), which is considered one of RBF&#x27;s most requested songs to date.

Riding a wave of support from fans all over Southern California, Save Ferris became favorites of KROQ radio&#x27;s legendary “Rodney on the Rock”, which resulted in regular airplay on LA&#x27;s world-famous KROQ radio station, possibly being the first unsigned band to do this in LA alternative radio history. Later that year, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences gave the band a Grammy showcase award for best-unsigned band, earning them a recording contract with Epic Records (SONY).

===1997: &quot;It Means Everything&quot; and mainstream success===
Save Ferris eventually released their debut full-length album, &quot;It Means Everything&quot;, through Epic, in 1997. The album features several re-recorded tracks from their EP, several new songs, as well as a cover of Dexys Midnight Runners&#x27; &quot;Come On Eileen&quot;, the 1982 hit which became Save Ferris&#x27; most iconic single to-date. &quot;It Means Everything&quot;&#x27;s opening track is the single &quot;The World is New,&quot; which was featured in the 1998 film &quot;The Big Hit&quot; (starring Mark Wahlberg), and was also later featured in the trailers for &quot;Senseless&quot; (1998) and &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot; (2000), as well as an episode of the TV series &quot;7th Heaven&quot;.

Save Ferris toured extensively in support of &quot;It Means Everything&quot;, opening for bands such as Sugar Ray, The Offspring, Goldfinger and Reel Big Fish, as well as two mainstage spots on the Vans &quot;Warped Tour&quot; in 1998 and 2000, respectively. In April 1998, the band made their television debut on HBO&#x27;s music series &quot;Reverb&quot; before making an on-screen appearance in the teen film &quot;10 Things I Hate About You&quot; (1999). Their debut album sold over 400,000 copies, and spawned three Top 10 hits in Japan and Mexico. With two singles charting in the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and full rotation on alternative radio globally, &quot;It Means Everything&quot; was able to achieve platinum certification as per the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).

===1998–1999: &quot;Modified&quot; era===
After the departure of the band&#x27;s first drummer, Marc Harismendy, in 1998, Save Ferris regrouped and released their appropriately titled sophomore album for Epic records, &quot;Modified&quot;, in October 1999. The album saw the band moving away from their ska-pop roots and into pop-punk territory. The album also spawned three Top Ten hits in both Japan and Mexico. The song &quot;The Only Way to Be&quot; was used in 2000 film Scary Movie.

Save Ferris supported Modified on tour throughout the next several years including a trek with Lit in the U.S. and a headlining tour of the UK.

===2000–2003: Hiatus, and &quot;For the Fans&quot; tour===
Save Ferris performed at the 2002 Winter Olympics between the qualifiers and the finals of the Men&#x27;s Halfpipe at the competition venue in Park City.

Throughout the years, Save Ferris experienced a number of changes in their lineup, most notably the departure of Brian Mashburn, the band&#x27;s main songwriter, who quit in 2002. Soon to follow Mashburn were Eric Zamora and Bill Uechi, departing to start a new band. Save Ferris announced their breakup in October 2002.

Soon after the departure of Mashburn, Powell self-financed what she called the &quot;For the Fans&quot;, a US tour in 2003, which included a mainstage performance at &quot;Ska Summit&quot; in Las Vegas for over 10,000 fans.

===2004–2012: Post-breakup===
From 2004 to 2008, Powell appeared on albums by The Used, Lostprophets, Hilary Duff, Goldfinger and others. She also started a now defunct band called The Mojo Wire in 2008, and toured in the LA area.

In 2003, Bill Uechi, Brian Mashburn, T-Bone Willy, Eric Zamora, and Oliver Zavala started the band Starpool with Alan Meade original member of No Doubt on vocals and Phil Hanson on drums.

===2013–present: Revival===
Save Ferris, now led by Powell, went on indefinite hiatus from 2003 until the spring of 2013, at which time Powell once again regrouped the band (with new musicians) and headlined the Pacific Amphitheatre in Costa Mesa, California, to a sold-out crowd of over 7,000 fans, with another sold-out show at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles.

The Costa Mesa gig resulted in a lawsuit being filed against Powell by the former members of Save Ferris over use of the band&#x27;s name, stating that she had not contacted nor invited her former bandmates to perform at the show, although she stated that that was not the case. Powell thus responded with her own countersuit in 2015. Ultimately, Powell won the rights to the band&#x27;s name, branding, and social media. She was also awarded writing credits on several songs she had previously not been credited on. In October 2015, a public message indicating that the lawsuits between the members had been amicably resolved was posted to the band&#x27;s official website; this message has since been removed.

Additionally, in 2015, ASCAP songwriting records were updated, crediting Powell as co-writer on a number of Save Ferris songs for which her name had not previously been listed.

In 2016, Save Ferris ran a successful PledgeMusic campaign to raise money for what would be their first new album in over 15 years. The financial goal was achieved in only a couple of weeks, fully funded by the fans. The band co-headlined Mexico City &quot;Ska Fest&quot; 2016 with the Mighty Mighty Bosstones.

On February 10, 2017, Save Ferris released the &quot;Checkered Past&quot; EP, their first release in 18 years. The EP was produced by Oingo Boingo bassist John Avila and features a guest appearance by Neville Staple of The Specials on the EP&#x27;s first single, &quot;New Sound&quot;. The band toured for the album in 2017, and took part in the Vans &quot;Warped&quot; Tour that summer.

Save Ferris released their first Christmas single, as well as their first single in six years, &quot;Xmas Blue&quot;, to their official YouTube channel on December 14, 2023. Another single, &quot;Lights Out in The Reptile House&quot;, was released on July 19, 2024.

<text>Bharatiya Gorkha Janashakti (BGJ or BGJS; &#x27;Indian Gorkha People&#x27;s Power&#x27;) is a political party in the Darjeeling District of the Indian state of West Bengal. BGJS was launched in 1998, anticipating the 1999 Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) elections. BGJS was part of the United Front launched by Communist Party of Revolutionary Marxists and Akhil Bharatiya Gorkha League.

BGJS demanded that the Gorkhas should be included as Scheduled Tribes (giving access to quotas and reservations) and that the area of DGHC should be reorganized.

In 2003, BGJS was revived, anticipating the DGHC elections the following year which eventually was not held.

The president of BGJS is C.R. Rai. In 2001, members of the Gorkha National Liberation Front supporting a bandh stoned Rai&#x27;s house and set two of his three cars on fire.

<text>The Angus-Sanderson was an English automobile manufactured from 1919 to 1927 by Sir William Angus, Sanderson &amp; Company Ltd.

==History==
In concept it was something like the Bean and Cubitt; the idea was that one model would be mass-produced, as Ford had done so successfully. The car was an assembly of proprietary parts, as it contained a 2.3-litre side-valve engine from Tylor, a 3 speed gearbox and rear axle by Wrigley, Woodhead springs, and Goodyear wheels. One distinctive feature were disc wheels with a wavy pattern. Indeed, the company made fewer of its own parts than any other British car company at the time. Approximately 3000 cars were produced but the car was expensive at £575.

&quot;It came on the market in 1919 and by 1921 the impact of the Morris at undercut prices killed it off, although not before cars had been supplied to the Princess Royal and to S.F. Edge.&quot;

The company was refinanced as Angus Sanderson (1921) Ltd and moved production from Birtley, County Durham to the Grahame-White aircraft factory in Hendon, Middlesex in 1921 and toyed with the idea of building a smaller 8 hp car in 1925 but few, if any were built. Neither of these actions nor a price reduction to £365 staved off the inevitable, and the company folded for good in 1927.

<text>The Villa Giulia is a villa in Rome, Italy. It is named after Pope Julius III, who had it built in 1551–1553 on what was then the edge of the city. Today it is publicly owned, and houses the Museo Nazionale Etrusco, a collection of Etruscan art and artifacts.

==History==
===Location===
The villa was built in an area of Rome known as the &#x27;Vigna Vecchia&#x27; (which was once against the city walls), lying on the slopes of &quot;Monte Parioli&quot;, as a &#x27;Villa Suburbana&#x27; and a place of repose.

===Design===
The pope, a highly literate connoisseur of the arts, assigned the initial design of the building to Giacomo Barozzi da Vignola in 1551–1553. The nymphaeum and other garden structures, however, were designed by Bartolomeo Ammanati, all under the supervision of Giorgio Vasari. Michelangelo also worked there. Pope Julius took a direct interest in the villa&#x27;s design and decor and spent vast amounts of money on enhancing its beauties. Villa Giulia became one of the most delicate examples of Mannerist architecture.

Only a small part of the original property has survived intact, comprising three vineyards which extended down to the Tiber, and to which the pope traveled often by boat. The villa, as was customary, had an urban entrance (on the Roman Via Flaminia) and a formal but rural garden entrance. The villa itself was on the threshold between two worlds, that of the city and that of the country, an essentially Roman concept. A medal struck in 1935 shows the villa as substantially complete, but with a pair of cupolas which were never executed.

Vignola&#x27;s urban front of the building is a somber two-story facade with each story being given equal value. It has at its centre the triple rhythm of a richly detailed rusticated triumphal arch flanked by symmetrical wings of two bays only. The facade is terminated at each end by Doric pilasters. In this facade of the Villa Giulia is the genesis of the seven-bay 18th century Georgian villa, which was reproduced as far away as the Tidewater region of Virginia.
The rear of the building has Vignola&#x27;s large hemispherical loggia overlooking the first of three courtyards, laid out as a simple parterre.

At its rear the visitor passes through the &quot;casina&quot;, which again has a hemispherical rear facade, enclosing paired flights of re-entrant marble steps that give access to the heart of the villa complex: a two-story Nympheum for alfresco dining during the heat of the summer. This three-levelled structure of covered loggias, decorated with marble statuary, reclining river gods in niches, and balustrading, is constructed around a central fountain. Here in this cool environment, sheltered from the blazing sun, day-long picnics would be held. The central fountain, &quot;Fontana dell&#x27;Acqua Vergine&quot;, was designed and sculpted by Vasari and Ammannati: it depicts river gods and caryatids. The fountain&#x27;s source, the Acqua Vergine, also supplies the Trevi Fountain in Rome.

The &quot;Casino della Vigna&quot; (&quot;little house in the vineyard&quot;), as it was sometimes known, and its gardens were set in the midst of vineyards, which could be viewed from shaded arcades on the outsides of the garden walls. Papal parties embarked on boats at the gates of the Vatican and were transported up the Tiber to the villa&#x27;s long-gone private landing stage.

===Later history===
Following Pope Julius&#x27; death, his successor Pope Paul IV confiscated all the properties he had assembled; the villa was divided, and the main building and part of the gardens became the property of the Camera apostolica. The Villa was reserved for the use of the new pope&#x27;s Borromeo nephews. It was restored in 1769 on the initiative of Pope Clement XIV, confiscated by the new state of Italy in 1870, and given over to the National Etruscan Museum in the early 20th century.

==In popular culture==

In the third season of &quot;Medici&quot;, it is the site of the first meeting between Clarice Orsini, wife of Lorenzo Medici, and Caterina Sforza&#x27;s wife of Girolamo Riario, that takes place in what would appear to be the palace of a fictitious “Cardinal Bianco.” The meeting scene is filmed in the courtyard of the hemicycle of Villa Giulia in Rome (now home to the National Etruscan Museum).

<doc id="855030" wikidata="Q5178235" url="?curid=855030" title="Court History of David">
<text>The Court History of David (frequently called simply the Court History) is one of the two hypothetical main source documents of the Books of Samuel, the other being the Accession History. The text is believed to cover most of 2 Samuel, except for the first few chapters and a few more minor parts. The Court History includes several stories with a distinctly negative attitude towards King David (e.g., the story of his adultery with Bathsheba).

German theologian described the history of David&#x27;s family in and as a &quot;Succession Document&quot; aiming to justify Solomon&#x27;s succession to the throne of the United Monarchy after the death of David. American theologian James Flanagan later argued that behind this Succession Document lay an earlier work, a &quot;Court History&quot;, which sought to legitimate David&#x27;s rule over the kingdoms of Judah and Israel.

Richard Elliott Friedman suggested in his book &quot;The Hidden Book in the Bible&quot; (1999) that the Court History and the Accession History were originally part of a single historical epic written by the Yahwist author covering the history of the Israelite world until the time of David and Solomon. 

Friedman&#x27;s thesis in &quot;The Hidden Book in the Bible&quot; is that the Yahwist author wrote many of the most familiar stories in the Hebrew Bible, including the stories of Adam and Eve, Abraham, Moses, and David, as one unified text. The Hidden Book analyses the punctuation patterns, word choice, sentence structure and allusions used in the biblical stories; and reconstructs what Friedman says is the original, foundational text at the heart of the Bible.

<text>The Seven Islands of Bombay (Portuguese: &quot;Ilhas de Bom Baim&quot;) were 16th-century Portuguese colonial possessions lying off the Konkan region by the mid-west coast of India.

==History==
They were partly handed over to England under this title as part of the dowry of Catherine Braganza when she married Charles II in 1661. The isles and islets had earlier been part of indigenous polities like the Silhara dynasty and the Gujarat Sultanate before they were captured by the Portuguese Armadas in 1534. After acquiring them as through a royal dowry from the Kingdom of Portugal, Charles II leased Bombay and adjacent islets to the East India Company in 1668 for £10 per year (receiving a loan of £50,000 at 6% interest in return for the favor).

By 1845, the islands had been merged into one landmass by means of multiple land reclamation projects. The resulting island of Bombay was later merged with the nearby islands of Trombay and Salsette that lay to its north-east and north respectively to form Greater Bombay. These islands now constitute the southern part of the city of Bombay (Mumbai).

The original seven islands handed over to England were as follows:

* Colaba
* Old Woman&#x27;s Island (Little Colaba)
* Isle of Bombay
* Mazagaon
* Parel
* Worli
* Mahim

There also are several smaller islands that lie to the east of the main seven islands:

* Butcher Island
* Cross Island
* East Ground
* Elephanta Island, also Known as Gharapuri
* Middle Ground
* Oyster Rock

<doc id="855040" wikidata="Q4803761" url="?curid=855040" title="Hermann Hauser">
<text>Hermann Maria Hauser (born 1948) is an Austrian entrepreneur, venture capitalist and inventor who is primarily associated with the Cambridge technology community in England.

==Education and early life==
When Hauser was 16 he went to the United Kingdom to learn English at a language school in Cambridge. After a master&#x27;s degree in physics from Vienna University, he returned to King&#x27;s College, Cambridge to do a PhD in physics at the Cavendish Laboratory.

==Career==
Hauser is probably best known for his part in setting up Acorn Computers with Chris Curry in 1978. When Olivetti took control of Acorn in 1985 he became vice-president for research at Olivetti, in charge of laboratories in the US and Europe. In 1986, Hauser co-founded the Olivetti Research Laboratory (ORL) in Cambridge with Andy Hopper, who became the laboratory&#x27;s director. Hauser&#x27;s role in Acorn was portrayed by Edward Baker-Duly in the BBC drama &quot;Micro Men&quot;.

In 1988, Hauser left Olivetti to start the Active Book Company, investing £1 million of his own money. The company sought to develop a portable ARM-based microcomputer &quot;the size of a paperback book&quot;, featuring a screen and stylus for interaction and employing a &quot;book&quot; metaphor known as Hyperpage. The company planned to launch its first product after Christmas 1990, featuring an approximately A5-sized reflective display, automatic recognition of printed, as opposed to cursive, characters, and employing a multipurpose chip called Hercules featuring a static, low-power ARM core. A licensing agreement had been signed with Acorn for access to that company&#x27;s hardware and software technology, and the company was seeking application developers for the platform. The Active Book was intended to cost around $2,000, provide eight to ten hours of battery life, and was to run the Helios operating system. Not wanting to repeat the mistakes made by Acorn, which had kept its technology to itself, he demonstrated the Active Book to as many large companies as he could. AT&amp;T Corporation acquired Active Book in July 1991 and incorporated it into their EO Personal Communicator, which was released in April 1993. Hauser became chief technical officer and chairman of EO Europe. Sales did not meet expectations, and AT&amp;T&#x27;s EO subsidiary folded on 29 July 1994.

In 1990, Hauser was involved in spinning out Advanced RISC Machines (ARM) from Acorn.

In 1993, Hauser set up Advanced Telecommunication Modules Ltd with Andy Hopper. The company was acquired by Conexant Systems on 1 March 2004. He founded NetChannel Ltd in June 1996 as a holding company to begin work on marketing the NetStation. NetChannel was sold to AOL in 1996. He claimed in the 1990s that the networking technology used for AppleTalk was based on the (unpatented) Cambridge Ring.

In 1997 he co-founded Amadeus Capital Partners Ltd, a venture capital company, and in 1998 he co-founded Cambridge Network with David Cleevely and Alec Broers.

In 2000, Plastic Logic was founded, with Hauser as chairman.

On 14 June 2001, the Hauser-Raspe Foundation was registered as a charity to advance education, by Hauser and his wife Pamela Raspe.

In August 2004, Amadeus Capital Partners led the Series B venture capital financing of Solexa, and Hauser joined its board of directors. Solexa developed a next-generation DNA sequencing technology which became the market leader; the company was sold to Illumina, Inc of San Diego in January 2007 for over $US600 million. In 2009, Hauser was announced as the first customer of the Illumina Personal Genome Sequencing service.

As of 2009, Hauser is the head of the East Anglia Stem Cell research network.

Hauser is a non-executive director of Cambridge Display Technology, a non-executive director of XMOS Ltd and a member of the board of Red-M (Communications) Ltd. He holds honorary doctorates from the Universities of Bath and Loughborough and from Anglia Ruskin University. He is a member of the advisory board on the Higher Education Innovation Fund, and of the UK&#x27;s Council for Science and Technology.

Hauser was commissioned by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to write a report on technology and innovation in the UK. Publication of the report in 2010 led to the establishment of Catapult centres with £200 million of government funding.

He was co-founder of ARM Holdings, the Cambridge-based microchip manufacturer that was bought in 2016 by Japan&#x27;s SoftBank.

Since 2015, he is actively supporting Austrian start-ups and technology companies. In particular, he has invested in 2017 in the MEMS-speaker start-up &quot;USound&quot; and in eyeson, a cloud based Unified Communications solution nominated by Gartner Inc. as &quot;Cool Vendor in Unified Communications, 2017&quot;.

In 2022, he invested in the Munich based quantum computing startup planqc, a spin-off from the renowned Max Planck Institute for Quantum Optics, and joined the advisory board.

==Awards and honours==
Hauser was voted the UK&#x27;s &quot;Computer Personality of the Year&quot; of 1984. In 2010, &quot;Eureka&quot;, in its &quot;100 most important scientists&quot;, placed Hauser at 51. He became patron of The Centre for Computing History in December 2011, 30 years after the launch of the BBC Micro.

In 2001, Hauser became an Honorary Doctor at Anglia Ruskin University. On 8 July 2002, Hauser was elected a Fellow of the Institute of Physics (FInstP) and an International Fellow of the Royal Academy of Engineering (FREng). In May 2004 he presented the prestigious IEE Pinkerton Lecture. In 2005, Hauser received a Lifetime Achievement Award for his work as a venture capitalist and entrepreneur. The award was presented at the annual European Electronics Industry Awards in London. Hauser was awarded an Honorary CBE for &quot;innovative service to the UK enterprise sector&quot; in 2001. In 1998, Hauser was elected into an honorary fellowship of Hughes Hall, Cambridge, and he was also elected into an honorary fellowship of King&#x27;s College, Cambridge with effect from 1 January 2000. In the same year he was awarded the Mountbatten Medal.

Hauser was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 2012. His nomination reads: 

Hauser was elected a Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (DFBCS) in 2013 recognising his contribution to computing science in the UK.

<doc id="855042" wikidata="Q743556" url="?curid=855042" title="R. A. Schwaller de Lubicz">
<text>René Adolphe Schwaller de Lubicz (born René Adolphe Schwaller December 30, 1887 – December 7, 1961), was a French Egyptologist and mystic who popularized the idea of sacred geometry in ancient Egypt during his study of the art and architecture of the Temple of Luxor in Egypt, and his subsequent book &quot;The Temple In Man&quot;. Many of de Lubiscz&#x27;s claims have been rejected by mainstream Egyptologists, but embraced by promoters of &quot;alternative Egyptology&quot;.

==Early life==
René Schwaller was born in Alsace-Lorraine and left home at the age of eighteen after having completed an apprenticeship with his father in pharmaceutical chemistry. Moving to Paris from Alsace to study modern chemistry and physics, he developed an interest in Alchemy, reading every alchemical text he could find including those by Paracelsus and Ramon Llull. He also developed an interest in painting and became the student of Matisse.

He was given the title &quot;de Lubicz&quot; in 1919 by the Lithuanian writer, mystic and diplomat Oscar Vladislas de Lubicz Milosz.

He also wrote under the mystical name &#x27;Aor&#x27;, signifying &quot;Light of the Higher Mind&quot;.

He may have become a student of Theosophy and Syncretism, as those two concepts are extensively tackled in his books.

==Les Veilleurs==
Schwaller de Lubicz was the founder in 1919, with other members of the Theosophical Society, of the esoteric right-wing French group called &quot;Affranchis&quot;, that published a journal &quot;L&#x27;Affranchi-Hiérarchie, Fraternité, Liberté, a monthly journal of art and philosophy&quot;, dealing with a spiritual and social renewal within the framework of a mystical political philosophy. Its president was René Bruyez. On 23 July 1919 the group dissolved and another group was formed in its place: &quot;Les Veilleurs&quot; (&quot;the Vigilants&quot;), to which (at least according to the historian Pierre Mariel) the young Rudolf Hess belonged. Its uniform consisted of a dark shirt, high-boots and riding-breeches, akin to the &quot;Sturmabteilung&quot;.

&quot;Les Veilleurs&quot; delivered its manifesto in December 1919, its politics conveyed through a series of letters called &quot;Appeals&quot; and signed by its members. The letter signed by &quot;Aor&quot; was addressed &quot;To the Jews&quot;, where he advised all Jews to &quot;go back home&quot;. The first issue of its journal, &quot;Veilleur&quot;, contained an anonymous antisemitic article that first appeared in a Masonic journal from 1898.

The artist André Vanden Broeck in his memoirs and biography of Schwaller de Lubicz described him as antisemitic, and Joscelyn Godwin commented &quot;Schwaller de Lubicz was not sufficiently vindictive to persist in the course of action followed by Hess and Hitler, but nor was he sufficiently humane, it would seem, to regret his contribution to the currents of the time.&quot;

In his biography of Schwaller de Lubicz, &quot;La Vie et l&#x27;œuvre de Rene Schwaller de Lubicz&quot;, Érik Sablé writes, &quot;The feigned Nazi connections of de Lubicz, some purportedly claim, are spurious, unfounded, and totally without merit; which only exposes the shallow nature of those authors who succumb to the victor’s stories.&quot;

==Suhalia==
During the 1920s with his wife Isha, Schwaller de Lubicz established in Switzerland the &quot;Station Scientifique Suhalia&quot;, a research centre consisting of &quot;laboratories for physics, chemistry, micro-photography and the manufacture of homeopathic tinctures was set up, along with an astronomical observatory, a machine shop, workshops for woodworking, blacksmithing, printing, weaving, rugmaking and glassmaking and a theater.&quot;
While there, Schwaller de Lubicz brought to a total whole his philosophical vision and in 1926 published his book &quot;L&#x27;Appel du Feu&quot;, where his &quot;inspiration and higher intelligence is personified as &#x27;Aor&#x27; (Hebrew for &#x27;intellectual light&#x27;).&quot; Suhalia became the location where he began to &quot;elaborate his philosophy of the evolution of consciousness.&quot;

In Suhalia, between 1926 and 1927 Schwaller created an Egyptian Tarot Game consisting of 25 cards (originally in black and white), partly copied and partly inspired by Egyptian gods paintings. The Italian painter and musician Elmiro Celli and Lucie Lamy, daughter of Isha, are supposed to have contributed to the realization of this &quot;game of life&quot;; but the active participation of Isha in planning is not to be excluded, being a passionate Egyptologist and scholar of comparative religions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism and Taoism).

==Egypt==
Schwaller de Lubicz lived in Egypt for twelve years, studying the temples of Thebes in detail. He, with the French Egypologist Alexandre Varille, developed the symbolist approach to ancient Egypt. He argued that Egyptian temples were used for mystical initiations, and that their design incorporated symbolism expressing a belief system that combined religion, philosophy, art, and science. He believed, for instance, that the Egyptians were aware of astronomical concepts like axial precession, which was reflected in their religious beliefs. He linked the astrological age of Gemini with the development of the dualistic themes in Egyptian religion, the age of Taurus with the bull god Apis, and the age of Aries with the god Amun, who was depicted as a ram. He also argued that the human form was the basis for ancient Egyptian architecture, and he equated parts of the temples with parts of the human body. His three-volume work &quot;The Temple in Man&quot; includes a drawing that compares the plan of Luxor Temple to the shape of a human skeleton. Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince argue that these ideas were influenced by Schwaller de Lubicz&#x27;s existing beliefs, such as Syncretism and Theosophy. Like many other esotericist figures, he believed that Egyptian civilization dated back much farther than conventional Egyptian chronology allows.

Mainstream Egyptologists have largely ignored his claims or viewed them with hostility, although Erik Hornung points out that his survey of Luxor Temple contains information useful to anyone studying the temple today. 
He is an influential figure among the advocates of theories about ancient Egypt that challenge the conclusions of mainstream Egyptology—theories that are sometimes labeled &quot;alternative Egyptology&quot;. Many adherents of George Gurdjieff&#x27;s Fourth Way find parallels in Schwaller de Lubicz&#x27;s writings, and he has been an inspiration to authors like John Anthony West, whose claims about the great age of the Great Sphinx of Giza are inspired by those of Schwaller de Lubicz, and Naomi Ozaniec.

<text>The Ansaldo was an Italian automobile manufactured by the armaments concern Gio. Ansaldo &amp; C. from 1921 to 1931 based in Torino. The company entered car manufacture with an OHC inline-four engine model which could develop at 3600 rpm. A sports version with engine was offered, as was a six-cylinder version of 1991 cc; later six-cylinders were offered with engines of 2179 cc.

Among the company&#x27;s last cars was an OHV straight-8 of . Ansaldos were generally of good quality and modern design, and competed in many races. When Wikov began manufacture in Czechoslovakia in 1928, they built the Ansaldo Tipo 10.

In 1928 the company manufactured their first commercial chassis for omnibus and ambulance with front engine rear axle configuration powered by a two liter petrol inline four engine producing 35hp of power. Supporting was a four speed manual transmission which helped the vehicle achieve 38mph and with a 63 liter fuel tank capacity. Next year the manufacturer also started to manufacture commercial taxi cars which were not much different than their standard parts.

<doc id="855047" wikidata="Q7252323" url="?curid=855047" title="Provel cheese">
<text>Provel ( ) is a white processed cheese prominent in St. Louis cuisine. A combination of cheddar, Swiss, provolone, and liquid smoke, Provel has a low melting point, a gooey texture, and a buttery flavor. 

Provel cheese is the traditional topping for St. Louis–style pizza. It is also used in pasta sauces, cheese soup, salads, and sandwiches such as the Gerber sandwich.

Provel is rarely used or sold outside of St. Louis. Provel can be purchased at St. Louis-area grocery stores such as Schnucks or Dierbergs Markets, and Hy-Vee grocery stores across the Midwest.

== History ==
Provel was purportedly invented for St. Louis–style pizza in the 1940s by Costa Grocery (now Roma Grocery on the Hill), in collaboration with Hoffman Dairy of Wisconsin (now part of Kraft Foods), according to &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; food writer Joe Bonwich. Provel was developed to meet demand for a pizza cheese with a clean bite, melting well while breaking off nicely when cut or bitten. Imo&#x27;s Pizza founder Ed Imo claims credit for popularizing Provel through his chain.

Neither Kraft Foods nor Roma Grocery has a definitive answer for the origin of the name, although one popular theory is that it is a portmanteau of the words provolone and mozzarella, two of the cheeses for which it is substituted.

=== Trademark ===
The Provel name trademark was first used in 1947 and held by the Churny Company, Inc. of Glenview, Illinois. Churny later became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kraft Foods after it was closed in 2012.

In 2021, Lactalis acquired Hoffman Dairy from Kraft. As of 2024, Lactalis holds the Provel name trademark, but does not appear to be using this name: Hoffman&#x27;s Pizza Cheese is simply known as &quot;2/5 LB St. Louis Style Pizza Cheese&quot; in the Lactalis Culinary catalogue.

=== Distribution ===
Imo&#x27;s Pizza acquired Costa&#x27;s Grocery, which had the sole rights to sell Provel in St. Louis, some time between 1964 and 1985. Imo&#x27;s continues to package and sell shredded Provel cheese to end customers, as of 2024.

<doc id="855050" wikidata="Q2720788" url="?curid=855050" title="Gorkha National Liberation Front">
<text>Gorkha National Liberation Front (GNLF) is a political party in the Darjeeling District of West Bengal, India. It was formed in 1980 by Subhash Ghisingh with the objective of demanding a Gorkhaland state within India.

==Early history==
Part of the desire for independence stems from the notion that the Gurkhas are ethnically and culturally diverse from the rest of the population of West Bengal due to their roots within Gorkhali history. R. B. Rai describes the Darjeeling region as &quot;social, political, and symbolic center&quot; for all Indian Gorkhas, leading the movement to include the Nepali Language in the Indian constitution. Other ethnic identities in the region such as the Lepchas,  the indigenous population of the area, and the Bhutias are looked at by Gorkhas as holding minority status. Language is one of the main distinguishing factors between Gorkhas and others in the Darjeeling district as out of a total of around one million people living in the hills of Darjeeling, 90 percent speak Nepali. It is also important to note that the Nepali spoken in the Darjeeling district is distinct from that spoken outside of the Darjeeling region as it emerged as a combination of several different “kura” or “Gorkhali” dialects. The British went even further in helping establish Gorkhas as a distinct ethnic identity as they institutionalized their racial classification through military policy. Over time this led to an even stronger sense of ethnic identity. A sense of otherness for Indian born Nepali speakers may also have been a strong contributing factor for some in their motivation to  gain independence from India. Indian born Nepali speakers were not considered Nepalis by other Nepali speakers, but were also looked at as foreigners by Indians. Some members of the Indian government such as ex-Prime Minister Morarji Desai who stated that if Indians wanted to speak Nepali that they should “Go to Nepal” clearly share this stance on the Nepali language. The tie between ethnic heritage and the Gorkha National Liberation Front is clearly represented in the flag’s use of the traditional sword of the Gorkha’s, the Kukri.

A contributing factor to the push for an independent Gorkhaland beyond ethnic identity was an economic downturn brought on by corruption and mismanagement of resources in the Darjeeling region by the Indian government during post colonial rule. Although the region was recognized as having several valuable resources such as tea, lumber and tourism, misappropriation led to long periods of economic hardship. These circumstances of economic uncertainty mixed with ethnic identity conflicts made the region a potential site for unrest. Other political parties have also supported actions or conflicts by Gorkhaland movement members like the GNLF, such as the Kamtapur Progressive Party. The instability also leads to uncertainty pertaining to potential conflict between people living in the Hills and people living in the Plains. This uncertainty is especially relevant when considering the differences in language and ethic orientation in those separate spaces. 

During the 1980s, the GNLF led an intensive and often violent campaign for the creation of a separate Gorkhaland state in the Nepali-speaking areas of northern West Bengal (Darjeeling, Dooars and Terai). The movement reached its peak around 1985–1986. On 22 August 1988, the GNLF, under Subhash Ghisingh, signed the &quot;Darjeeling Hill Accord&quot;, which created the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC) in exchange for the GNLF giving up its demand for Gorkhaland.

==Electoral history==
===State assembly===
GNLF boycotted the West Bengal state assembly elections in 1991. In the assembly elections in 1996, 2001, and 2006, GNLF won three assembly seats, one each from Darjeeling, Kalimpong and Kurseong.

===Lok Sabha===
In 1989, GNLF candidate Inderjeet Khuller, a former journalist covering the Gorkhaland agitation and a close friend of Subhash Ghisingh, won the Darjeeling (Lok Sabha constituency) elections. GNLF supported Inderjeet as the Indian National Congress candidate in 1991, who won the Lok Sabha elections riding on GNLF support. GNLF boycotted the Lok Sabha elections in 1996, 1998, and 1999, which were won by CPI(M) candidates. Ahead of the 2004 Lok Sabha elections, the GNLF supported the Congress party candidate Dawa Narbula, who won with a big margin from the Darjeeling constituency. In the 2009 elections, GNLF was out of power in the hills and did not field any candidate or support any party and the Lok Sabha seat was won by Jaswant Singh of BJP with the support from GJMM.

==Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council==
The GNLF administered the DGHC with Subhash Ghisingh as the chairman of the council from 1988 to 2004 for three successive terms. Subhash Ghisingh was appointed the sole caretaker of the DGHC from 2005 to 2008 as no election for the DGHC was held.

==Sixth Schedule==
A &quot;Memorandum of Settlement&quot; (MoS) was signed between the Central Government, the State Government and the GNLF for the establishment of a Sixth Schedule tribal council called the &quot;Gorkha Hill Council&quot; in the DGHC area on 6 December 2005. After some initial support, there was widespread opposition to the Sixth Schedule council, led by leaders like Madan Tamang of ABGL.

==Downfall==
The DGHC elections were due in 2004. However, the government decided not to hold elections and instead made Subhash Ghisingh the sole caretaker of the DGHC till the Sixth Schedule council was established. Resentment among the former councillors of DGHC grew rapidly. Among them, Bimal Gurung, once the trusted aide of Ghising, decided to break away from the GNLF. Riding on a mass support for Prashant Tamang, an Indian Idol contestant from Darjeeling, Bimal quickly capitalised on the public support he received for supporting Prashant, and was able to overthrow Ghisingh from the seat of power. Ghising decided to shift residence to Jalpaiguri and GNLF lost most of its support and cadres to Gorkha Janmukti Morcha, a new party headed by Bimal Gurung.

==West Bengal Legislative Assembly elections 2011==
After lying in political hibernation for three years, GNLF chief Subhash Ghisingh announced that his party would contest the West Bengal Legislative Assembly elections in 2011. Subhash Ghisingh returned to Darjeeling on 8 April 2011 ahead of the assembly elections after three years of &quot;exile&quot;. All the three GNLF candidates, Bhim Subba from Darjeeling, Prakash Dahal from Kalimpong and Pemu Chettri from Kurseong lost the elections held on 18 April 2011.

==Splinter group==
Gorkha National Liberation Front (C.K. Pradhan) or GNLF(C) is a splinter group of Gorkha National Liberation Front in Darjeeling district of West Bengal, India. GNLF(C) was formed in 2002 after the murder of GNLF leader C.K. Pradhan. 

Pradhan&#x27;s widow Sheila Pradhan claimed that he was killed by GNLF since he was about to break away from the main party. After the assassination, Sheila and others floated GNLF(C). The party is led by (Retd) Col. D.K. Pradhan of Kalimpong who is C.K. Pradhan&#x27;s brother. GNLF(C) was a member of the Democratic Front, an alliance of parties such as CPRM and ABGL in the Darjeeling area. It a member of the Gorkhaland Task Force, an alliance of political parties and social organisations formed to demand a separate state of Gorkhaland.

<doc id="855054" wikidata="Q2983297" url="?curid=855054" title="Berar Province">
<text>Berar Province, also known as the Hyderabad Assigned Districts, was a province of Hyderabad. After 1853, it was administered by the British, although the Nizam retained formal sovereignty over the province. Azam Jah, the eldest son of the 7th Nizam, held the title of Mirza-Baig (&quot;Prince&quot;) of Berar.

In 1881, the population of Berar was 2,672,673. The total area of the territory was . 

After 1 October 1903, the administration of the province was placed under the Commissioner-General for the Central Provinces, as the Berar Division. In 1936, the territory was renamed as the Central Provinces and Berar, and its legislative assembly was established. 

The successor to Berar, with changed boundaries, is Amravati Division in the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra.

==History==

===Background===

Before the Mughal occupation, Berar was a part of the Nizam Shahi Sultanate of Ahmadnagar. It was ceded to Emperor Akbar by Chand Bibi in 1596, who was unable to stand against the imperial forces led by Prince Mirza Murad. After this initial victory, Prince Mirza Murad settled in Berar, with Balapur as his headquarters. Near Balapur, he founded a new city named Shahpur and constructed a beautiful palace for himself. As his relationship was deteriorating with Abdur Rahim Khan-i-Khanan, the commander of the army, Akbar recalled Khan-i-Khanan and sent his trusted friend Abul Fazl to help him. Mirza Murad died in 1598. After his death, Mirza Daniyal was given the charge as governor of Berar, Ahmadnagar, and Khandesh, and Khan-i-Khanan was sent along with Mirza Daniyal. Akbar died in 1605.

In 1611, the southern provinces of Ahmadnagar, Berar, and Khandesh defied Mughal sovereignty under Malik Ambar. Jahangir sent Man Singh and others to crush the revolt. Man Singh died a natural death on 6 July 1614 at Ellichpur. During Jahangir&#x27;s rule, Malik Ambar, till his death in 1626, recovered a substantial part of the Deccan from the Mughals including Berar. In 1628, the first year of the reign of Shah Jahan (Mirza Khurram), Berar again came under the Mughal sway.

In 1636, the Mughal possessions in Dakhin (Deccan) were divided into 4 Subahs. Berar Subah was one of them, with Ellichpur as its capital, and Gavilgad as its main fort. Aurangzeb was appointed Viceroy of the four Deccan Subahs for the first time, and he occupied the post for eight years (till 1644). He was again appointed viceroy for the second time in 1653, and he remained in that post till 1657. During Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign, Mirza Azam was appointed at Berar, and then Amir Qamaruddin Nizam (I) became the Viceroy of Berar. Berar was successively overrun by the Mughals after the Mughals appointed the Maratha Senapati Sawai Shri Shriman Santaji Bhonsle Seena Sahib-e-Subah because Santaji was the father-in-law of Mirza Bedarbakht, son of Mirza Azam, and grandson of Aurangzeb. 

In 1720, Maratha Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath had the right to collect chauth and sardeshmukhi from Berar.

===Nizam and Maratha period===
In 1724, the &quot;Nizam-ul-Mulk&quot; Asif Jah established the independent line of the Nizams of Hyderabad, and thenceforth the latter claimed to be &quot;de jure&quot; sovereigns of Berar, with exception of certain districts (Mehkar, Pusad, etc.) ceded to the Maratha Peshwa in 1760 and 1795. The claim was contested by the Maratha Bhonsla rajas of Nagpur, and for more than half a century the country was devastated by wars between the two.

This condition of things was ended by Wellesley&#x27;s victories at Assaye and Argaon (1803), which forced the Bhonsla raja to cede his territories south of Gawilgarh and Narnala Fort and east of the Wardha River. The forts of Gavilgad and Narnala remained subject to the Bhosale raja of Nagpur.

By the partition treaty of Hyderabad (1804) between Nizam and the British, these ceded territories in Berar were transferred in perpetual sovereignty to the Nizam, together with some tracts about Sindkhed and Jalna, which had been held by Sindhia. The treaty of 1822 extinguished Maratha&#x27;s right to levy tribute (&quot;chauth&quot;), the Wardha River was fixed as the eastern boundary of Berar, the Melghat and adjoining districts in the plains being assigned to the Nizam, in exchange for the districts east of the Wardha held by the Peshwa.

When Berar was no longer protected by its Maratha taskmasters, it remained long prey to the turbulent elements let loose by the sudden cessation of the wars. From time to time bands of soldiers, whom the government was powerless to control, scoured the country, and rebellion upon rebellion till 1859, when the last fight against open rebels took place at Chichamba near Risod.

===British Raj===

At last, the British government intervened, and in 1853, a new treaty was signed with the Nizam, under which the Hyderabad contingent was to be maintained by the British government, while the pay of this force and in satisfaction of other claims, certain districts were assigned to the British East India Company. It was these &quot;Hyderabad Assigned Districts&quot; that were popularly supposed to form the province of Berar. In 1860, by a new treaty modified in Nizam&#x27;s favour of 1853, it was agreed that Berar should be held in trust by the British government for the purposes specified in the treaty of 1853.

After 1865, the American Civil War gave an immense stimulus to Berar&#x27;s cotton trade, as did the laying of a railway line across the province.

Building Berar&#x27;s prosperity on cotton, however, came with a price. During the famine of 1900, for example, nearly 8.5% of the population died, &quot;with the greatest number of deaths&quot;, according to the historian Sven Beckert, &quot;occurring in districts most specialized in cotton production&quot;.

Through an agreement signed on 5 November 1902, 6th Nizam Nawab Mir Mahbub Ali Khan leased Berar permanently to the British against an annual payment of 25 lakhs Rupees. Lord Curzon decided to merge Berar with the Central Provinces, and this was proclaimed on 17 September 1903. Thus the Central Provinces and Berar was born by a Residency Order, dated 30 September 1903, and the administration of Berar was placed under the Chief Commissioner of the Central Provinces.

On 1 October 1903, Berar was placed under the administration of the British Commissioner–General of the Central Provinces. In 1936, with the establishment of the legislative assembly of the &quot;Central Provinces and Berar&quot;, the territory was renamed as the Central Provinces and Berar. Berar became known as Berar Division.

====Administration====
In 1853, after the administration of the province was assigned to the British East India Company by the Nizam following a treaty, it was divided into two districts, South Berar with its headquarters at Hingoli, and North Berar with its headquarters at Buldana. Both were placed under a deputy commissioner. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, Hingoli and its adjoining areas were restored to the Nizam and the province was reconstituted into two districts, East Berar with its headquarters at Amraoti, and West Berar with its headquarters at Akola.

In 1864, East Berar was divided into two districts: Amraoti and Southeast Berar (which was first renamed as Wun district and then in 1905, Yeotmal district), with headquarters at Yeotmal. In 1867, Ellichpur District was also carved out of Amraoti. In 1864, the talukas of Malkapur, Chikhli, and Mehkar were separated from the West Berar District, and a new district, Southwest Berar District, was formed, which was renamed Mehkar District in 1865. In 1867, Buldana was selected as the district&#x27;s headquarters, and later the district was renamed as Buldana district. In 1868, Basim district was formed.

Berar consisted of one Division with a Commissioner and six districts viz. Amraoti, Ellichpur, Wun, Akola, Buldana, and Basim in 1905. It was rearranged into four Amraoti, Yeotmal, Akola, and Buldana districts. In 1869, municipal administrations were introduced at Amraoti, Akola, Ellichpur, Basim, Yavatmal, and Khamgaon. Later, Shegaon (1881), Akot (1884), and by 1904, four more, became municipal towns.

<doc id="855055" wikidata="Q1063550" url="?curid=855055" title="Creational pattern">
<text>In software engineering, creational design patterns are design patterns that deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation. The basic form of object creation could result in design problems or in added complexity to the design due to inflexibility in the creation procedures. Creational design patterns solve this problem by somehow controlling this object creation.

==Overview==
Creational design patterns are composed of two dominant ideas. One is encapsulating knowledge about which concrete classes the system uses. Another is hiding how instances of these concrete classes are created and combined.

Creational design patterns are further categorized into object-creational patterns and class-creational patterns, where object-creational patterns deal with object creation and class-creational patterns deal with class-instantiation. In greater details, object-creational patterns defer part of its object creation to another object, while class-creational patterns defer its object creation to subclasses.

Five well-known design patterns that are parts of creational patterns are the
* abstract factory pattern, which provides an interface for creating related or dependent objects without specifying the objects&#x27; concrete classes.
* builder pattern, which separates the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations.
* factory method pattern, which allows a class to defer instantiation to subclasses.
* prototype pattern, which specifies the kind of object to create using a prototypical instance, and creates new objects by cloning this prototype.
* singleton pattern, which ensures that a class only has one instance, and provides a global point of access to it.

==Definition==
The creational patterns aim to separate a system from how its objects are created, composed, and represented. They increase the system&#x27;s flexibility in terms of the what, who, how, and when of object creation.
==Usage==
As modern software engineering depends more on object composition than class inheritance, emphasis shifts away from hard-coding behaviors toward defining a smaller set of basic behaviors that can be composed into more complex ones. Hard-coding behaviors are inflexible because they require overriding or re-implementing the whole thing in order to change parts of the design. Additionally, hard-coding does not promote reuse and makes it difficult to keep track of errors. For these reasons, creational patterns are more useful than hard-coding behaviors. Creational patterns make design become more flexible. They provide different ways to remove explicit references in the concrete classes from the code that needs to instantiate them. In other words, they create independency for objects and classes.

Consider applying creational patterns when: 
* A system should be independent of how its objects and products are created.
* A set of related objects is designed to be used together.
* Hiding the implementations of a class library or product, revealing only their interfaces.
* Constructing different representation of independent complex objects.
* A class wants its subclass to implement the object it creates.
* The class instantiations are specified at run-time.
* There must be a single instance and client can access this instance at all times.
* Instance should be extensible without being modified.

==Structure==

Below is a simple class diagram that most creational patterns have in common. Note that different creational patterns require additional and different participated classes.

Participants: 
* Creator: Declares object interface. Returns object.
* ConcreteCreator: Implements object&#x27;s interface.

==Examples==
Some examples of creational design patterns include:

* Abstract Factory pattern: a class requests the objects it requires from a factory object instead of creating the objects directly
* Factory method pattern: centralize creation of an object of a specific type choosing one of several implementations
* Builder pattern: separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations
* Dependency Injection pattern: a class accepts the objects it requires from an injector instead of creating the objects directly
* Lazy initialization pattern: tactic of delaying the creation of an object, the calculation of a value, or some other expensive process until the first time it is needed
* Object pool pattern: avoid expensive acquisition and release of resources by recycling objects that are no longer in use
* Prototype pattern: used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects
* Singleton pattern: restrict instantiation of a class to one object

<doc id="855056" wikidata="Q2357011" url="?curid=855056" title="Forward osmosis">
<text>Forward osmosis (FO) is an osmotic process that, like reverse osmosis (RO), uses a semi-permeable membrane to effect separation of water from dissolved solutes. The driving force for this separation is an osmotic pressure gradient, such that a &quot;draw&quot; solution of high concentration (relative to that of the feed solution), is used to induce a net flow of water through the membrane into the draw solution, thus effectively separating the feed water from its solutes. In contrast, the reverse osmosis process uses hydraulic pressure as the driving force for separation, which serves to counteract the osmotic pressure gradient that would otherwise favor water flux from the permeate to the feed. Hence significantly more energy is required for reverse osmosis compared to forward osmosis.

The simplest equation describing the relationship between osmotic and hydraulic pressures and water (solvent) flux is:

where formula_1 is water flux, A is the hydraulic permeability of the membrane, Δπ is the difference in osmotic pressures on the two sides of the membrane, and ΔP is the difference in hydrostatic pressure (negative values of formula_1 indicating reverse osmotic flow). The modeling of these relationships is in practice more complex than this equation indicates, with flux depending on the membrane, feed, and draw solution characteristics, as well as the fluid dynamics within the process itself.

Tsolute flux (formula_3) for each individual solute can be modelled by Fick&#x27;s law

Where formula_4 is the solute permeability coefficient and formula_5 is the trans-membrane concentration differential for the solute. It is clear from this governing equation that a solute will diffuse from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration if solutes can diffuse across a membrane. This is well known in reverse osmosis where solutes from the feedwater diffuse to the product water, however in the case of forward osmosis the situation can be far more complicated.

In FO processes we may have solute diffusion in both directions depending on the composition of the draw solution, type of membrane used and feed water characteristics. Reverse solute flux (formula_3) does two things; the draw solution solutes may diffuse to the feed solution and the feed solution solutes may diffuse to the draw solution. Clearly these phenomena have consequences in terms of the selection of the draw solution for any particular FO process. For instance the loss of draw solution may affect the feed solution perhaps due to environmental issues or contamination of the feed stream, such as in osmotic membrane bioreactors.

An additional distinction between the reverse osmosis (RO) and forward osmosis (FO) processes is that the permeate water resulting from an RO process is in most cases fresh water ready for use. In FO, an additional process is required to separate fresh water from a diluted draw solution. Types of processes used are reverse osmosis, solvent extraction, magnetic and thermolytic. Depending on the concentration of solutes in the feed (which dictates the necessary concentration of solutes in the draw) and the intended use of the product of the FO process, the addition of a separation step may not be required. The membrane separation of the FO process in effect results in a &quot;trade&quot; between the solutes of the feed solution and the draw solution.

The forward osmosis process is also known as osmosis or in the case of a number of companies who have coined their own terminology &#x27;engineered osmosis&#x27; and &#x27;manipulated osmosis&#x27;.

==Applications==

===Emergency drinks===

One example of an application of this type may be found in &quot;hydration bags&quot;, which use an ingestible draw solute and are intended for separation of water from dilute feeds. This allows, for example, the ingestion of water from surface waters (streams, ponds, puddles, etc.) that may be expected to contain pathogens or toxins that are readily rejected by the FO membrane. With sufficient contact time, such water will permeate the membrane bag into the draw solution, leaving the undesirable feed constituents behind. The diluted draw solution may then be ingested directly. Typically, the draw solutes are sugars such as glucose or fructose, which provide the additional benefit of nutrition to the user of the FO device. A point of additional interest with such bags is that they may be readily used to recycle urine, greatly extending the ability of a backpacker or soldier to survive in arid environments. This process may also, in principle, be employed with highly concentrated saline feedwater sources such as seawater, as one of the first intended uses of FO with ingestible solutes was for survival in life rafts at sea.

===Desalination===
Desalinated water can be produced from the diluted draw / osmotic agent solution, using a second process. This may be by membrane separation, thermal method, physical separation or a combination of these processes. The process has the feature of inherently low fouling because of the forward osmosis first step, unlike conventional reverse osmosis desalination plants where fouling is often a problem. Modern Water has deployed forward osmosis based desalination plants in Gibraltar and Oman.
In March 2010, National Geographic magazine cited forward osmosis as one of three technologies that promised to reduce the energy requirements of desalination.

===Evaporative cooling tower – make-up water===
One other application developed, where only the forward osmosis step is used, is in evaporative cooling make-up water. In this case the cooling water is the draw solution and the water lost by evaporation is simply replaced using water produced by forward osmosis from a suitable source, such as seawater, brackish water, treated sewage effluent or industrial waste water. Thus in comparison with other ‘desalination’ processes that may be used for make-up water the energy consumption is a fraction of these with the added advantage of the low fouling propensity of a forward osmosis process.

===Landfill leachate treatment===
In the case where the desired product is fresh water that does not contain draw solutes, a second separation step is required. The first separation step of FO, driven by an osmotic pressure gradient, does not require a significant energy input (only unpressurized stirring or pumping of the solutions involved). The second separation step, however does typically require energy input. One method used for the second separation step is to employ RO. This approach has been used, for instance, in the treatment of landfill leachate. An FO membrane separation is used to draw water from the leachate feed into a saline (NaCl) brine. The diluted brine is then passed through a RO process to produce fresh water and a reusable brine concentrate. The advantage of this method is not a savings in energy, but rather in the fact that the FO process is more resistant to fouling from the leachate feed than a RO process alone would be. A similar FO/RO hybrid has been used for the concentration of food products, such as fruit juice.

===Brine concentration===

Brine concentration using forward osmosis may be achieved using a high osmotic pressure draw solution with a means to recover and regenerate it. One such process uses the ammonia-carbon dioxide (NH3/CO2) forward osmosis process invented at Yale University by Rob McGinnis, who subsequently founded Oasys Water to commercialize the technology. Because ammonia and carbon dioxide readily dissociate into gases using heat, the draw solutes can effectively be recovered and reused in a closed loop system, achieving separation through the conversion between thermal energy and osmotic pressure. NH3/CO2 FO brine concentration was initially demonstrated in the oil and gas industry to treat produced water in the Permian Basin area of Texas, and is currently being used in power and manufacturing plants in China.

===Feed water &#x27;softening&#x27; / pre-treatment for thermal desalination===

One unexploited application is to &#x27;soften&#x27; or pre-treat the feedwater to multi stage flash (MSF) or multiple effect distillation (MED) plants by osmotically diluting the recirculating brine with the cooling water. This reduces the concentrations of scale forming calcium carbonate and calcium sulphate compared to the normal process, thus allowing an increase in top brine temperature (TBT), output and gained output ratio (GOR). Darwish et al. showed that the TBT could be raised from 110 °C to 135 °C whilst maintaining the same scaling index for calcium sulphate.

=== Food Processing ===
Although osmotic treatment of food products (e.g., preserved fruits and meats) is very common in the food industry, FO treatment for concentration of beverages and liquid foods has been studied at laboratory-scale only. FO has several advantages as a process for concentrating beverages and liquid foods, including operation at low temperatures and low pressures that promote high retention of sensory (e.g., taste, aroma, color) and nutritional (e.g., vitamin) value, high rejection, and potentially low membrane fouling compared to pressure-driven membrane processes.

===Osmotic power===

In 1954 Pattle suggested that there was an untapped source of power when a river mixes with the sea, in terms of the lost osmotic pressure, however it was not until the mid ‘70s where a practical method of exploiting it using selectively permeable membranes by Loeb and independently by Jellinek was outlined. This process was referred by Loeb as pressure retarded osmosis (PRO) and one simplistic implementation is shown opposite. Some situations that may be envisaged to exploit it are using the differential osmotic pressure between a low brackish river flowing into the sea, or brine and seawater. The worldwide theoretical potential for osmotic power has been estimated at 1,650 TWh / year.

In more recent times a significant amount of research and development work has been undertaken and funded by Statkraft, the Norwegian state energy company. A prototype plant was built in Norway generating a gross output between 2 – 4 kW; see Statkraft osmotic power prototype in Hurum. A much larger plant with an output of 1 – 2 MW at Sunndalsøra, 400 km north of Oslo was considered but was subsequently dropped. The New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation (NEDO) in Japan is funding work on osmotic power.

==Industrial usage==

===Advantages===
Forward osmosis (FO) has many positive aspects in the treating of industrial effluents containing many different kinds of contaminants and also in the treating of salty waters. When these draw effluents have moderate to low concentrations of removable agents, the FO membranes are really efficient and have the flexibility of adapting the membrane depending on the quality desired for the product water. 
FO systems are also really useful when using them combined with other kinds of treatment systems as they compensate the deficiencies that the other systems may have. This is also helpful in processes where the recovery of a certain product is essential to minimize costs or to improve efficiency such as biogas production processes.

===Disadvantages===
The main disadvantage of the FO processes is the high fouling factor that they may experience. This occurs when treating a high saturated draw effluent, resulting in the membrane getting obtruded and no longer making its function. This implies that the process has to be stopped and the membrane cleaned. This issue happens less in other kind of membrane treatments as they have artificial pressure forcing to trespass the membrane reducing the fouling effect.
Also there&#x27;s an issue with the yet to be developed membranes technology. This affects to the FO processes as the membranes used are expensive and not highly efficient or ideal for the desired function. This means that many times other cheaper and simpler systems are used rather than membranes.

===Industrial market and future===
Currently the industry uses few FO membranes processes (and membranes technologies in general) as they&#x27;re complex processes which are also expensive and require a lot of cleaning procedures and that sometimes only work under certain conditions that in industry can&#x27;t always be ensured. For that reason the focus for the future in membranes is to improve the technology so it&#x27;s more flexible and suitable for general industrial usage. This will be done by investing in research and by slowly getting these developments into the market so the production cost is lowered as more membranes are produced.
Keeping with the current development it can be ensured that in few years from now, membranes will be spread-used in many different industrial processes (not only water treatments) and that there will appear many fields where FO processes can be used.

==Research==
An area of current research in FO involves direct removal of draw solutes, in this case by means of a magnetic field. Small (nanoscale) magnetic particles are suspended in solution creating osmotic pressures sufficient for the separation of water from a dilute feed. Once the draw solution containing these particles has been diluted by the FO water flux, they may be separated from that solution by use of a magnet (either against the side of a hydration bag, or around a pipe in-line in a steady state process).

<text>Robert John &quot;Bob&quot; Essery (22 November 1930 – 23 November 2021) was a British railway modeller and historian with a particular interest in the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) and one of its principal constituents, the Midland Railway (MR).

Essery was one of the founding members of the LMS Society in 1963, and particularly with David Jenkinson has authored many books. He worked in his early working years as a fireman on the LMS. Essery also established the historical journals &quot;Midland Record&quot; and &quot;LMS Journal&quot;. From 1999 in collaboration with the National Railway Museum, Essery with others have produced monographs on individual locomotive classes.

<text>Girolamo Diruta (c. 1546 – 1624 or 1625) was an Italian organist, music theorist, and composer. He was famous as a teacher, for his treatise &quot;Il Transilvano&quot; (Venice, 1st part 1593; 2nd part 1609-10) on counterpoint, and for his part in the development of keyboard technique, particularly on the organ. He was born in Deruta, near Perugia.

==Biography==
Diruta was born in Deruta in 1546 c. He became a friar minor conventual in the convent Perugia in 1566; later, from 1569 to 1574, he was in the convent of Correggio. Around 1578 he moved to Venice, where he met Claudio Merulo, Gioseffo Zarlino and Costanzo Porta (who was also a friar minor conventual), and he probably studied with each of them. Merulo mentioned Diruta in a prefatory letter to the &quot;Transilvano&quot; (1593), as one of his finest students.&lt;br&gt;
From 1580 until 1585 he was organist at the Gubbio cathedral. He returned in Venice at the Frari convent, where he was organist from 1586 until 1589. By 1593 he was organist at Chioggia cathedral. In these year he dedicated the first part of his treatise Il Transilvano to Sigismund Bathory, prince of Transylvania. &lt;br&gt;
Later he returned to live in Umbria. He was again organist at the Gubbio cathedral from 1604 to 1610.&lt;br&gt;
In 1610 from Gubbio he dedicated the second part of his treatise &quot;Il Transilvano&quot; to Leonora Orsini Sforza, niece of Grand Duke Ferdinand I of Tuscany.&lt;br&gt;
He died in Deruta in 1624 or 1625.

His nephew Agostino Diruta (c. 1595 – c. 1647) was also a composer, and his pupil.

==Works==
Diruta&#x27;s major work is a treatise in two parts on organ playing, counterpoint, and composition, entitled &quot;Il Transilvano&quot; (The Transylvanian) published for the first time in 1593; it is in the form of a dialog with Istvan de Josíka, a diplomat from Transylvania whom Diruta met during one of Josíka&#x27;s missions to Italy. It is one of the first practical discussions of organ technique which differentiates organ technique from keyboard technique on other instruments. His fingerings largely follow the usual ones of his times: for example, his fingering for a C major scale never includes the thumb, and crosses the middle finger over the ring finger: his work is one of the earliest attempts in Italy to establish consistency in keyboard fingering.

As a contrapuntist, Diruta anticipates Fux in describing the different &quot;species&quot; of counterpoint: note against note, two notes against one, suspensions, four notes against one, and so forth. Unlike Fux, he defines a less-rigorous kind of counterpoint that was adequate for improvisation; for example it neither requires contrary motion nor prohibits successive perfect consonances. It describes contemporary keyboard practice well, as can be observed from the contemporary toccatas and canzonas of composers such as Merulo.

Diruta included many of his own compositions in &quot;Il Transilvano&quot;, and they are mostly didactic in nature, showing different kinds of figuration, and presenting different kinds of performance problems. These four &quot;toccate&quot; are among the earliest examples of the etude.

The &quot;Prima parte&quot; also includes toccatas by other composers of the time, chosen for their musical and didactic value: Claudio Merulo, Andrea Gabrieli, Giovanni Gabrieli, Luzzasco Luzzaschi, Antonio Romanini, Paolo Quagliati, Vincenzo Bellavere and Gioseffo Guami. The &quot;Seconda parte&quot; includes ricercares by Luzzaschi, Gabriele Fattorini and Adriano Banchieri.

<text>In software engineering, structural design patterns are design patterns that ease the design by identifying a simple way to realize relationships among entities.

Examples of Structural Patterns include:

* Adapter pattern: &#x27;adapts&#x27; one interface for a class into one that a client expects
** Adapter pipeline: Use multiple adapters for debugging purposes.
** Retrofit Interface Pattern: An adapter used as a new interface for multiple classes at the same time.
* Aggregate pattern: a version of the Composite pattern with methods for aggregation of children
* Bridge pattern: decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently
** Tombstone: An intermediate &quot;lookup&quot; object contains the real location of an object.
* Composite pattern: a tree structure of objects where every object has the same interface
* Decorator pattern: add additional functionality to an object at runtime where subclassing would result in an exponential rise of new classes
* Extensibility pattern: a.k.a. Framework - hide complex code behind a simple interface
* Facade pattern: create a simplified interface of an existing interface to ease usage for common tasks
* Flyweight pattern: a large quantity of objects share a common properties object to save space
* Marker pattern: an empty interface to associate metadata with a class.
* Pipes and filters: a chain of processes where the output of each process is the input of the next
* Opaque pointer: a pointer to an undeclared or private type, to hide implementation details
* Proxy pattern: a class functioning as an interface to another thing

<text>In software engineering, behavioral design patterns are design patterns that identify common communication patterns among objects. By doing so, these patterns increase flexibility in carrying out communication.

== Design patterns ==
Examples of this type of design pattern include:

;Blackboard design pattern
: Provides a computational framework for the design and implementation of systems that integrate large and diverse specialized modules, and implement complex, non-deterministic control strategies
;Chain-of-responsibility pattern
: Command objects are handled or passed on to other objects by logic-containing processing objects
;Command pattern
: Command objects encapsulate an action and its parameters
;&quot;Externalize the stack&quot;
: Turn a recursive function into an iterative function that uses a stack
;Interpreter pattern
: Implement a specialized computer language to rapidly solve a specific set of problems
;Iterator pattern
: Iterators are used to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation
;Mediator pattern
: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem
;Memento pattern
: Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state (rollback)
;Null object pattern
: Designed to act as a default value of an object

;Protocol stack
: Communications are handled by multiple layers, which form an encapsulation hierarchy
;Scheduled-task pattern
: A task is scheduled to be performed at a particular interval or clock time (used in real-time computing)
;Single-serving visitor pattern
: Optimise the implementation of a visitor that is allocated, used only once, and then deleted
;Specification pattern
: Recombinable business logic in a boolean fashion
;State pattern
: A clean way for an object to partially change its type at runtime
;Strategy pattern
: Algorithms can be selected on the fly, using composition
;Template method pattern
: Describes the skeleton of a program; algorithms can be selected on the fly, using inheritance
;Visitor pattern
: A way to separate an algorithm from an object

<text>Costanzo Porta (1528 or 1529 – 19 May 1601) was an Italian composer of the Renaissance, and a representative of what is known today as the Venetian School. He was highly praised throughout his life both as a composer and a teacher, and had a reputation especially as an expert contrapuntist.

==Biography==
Porta was born in Cremona. Details of his early life are slim, but he probably was educated at the Convent Porta San Luca in Cremona. Around 1550 he is thought to have studied with Adrian Willaert, who was &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at St. Mark&#x27;s in Venice; while he was there he met Claudio Merulo, who was also a student; they remained close friends throughout their lives. In 1552 Porta became &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at Osimo Cathedral; in 1565 he took a position in Padua briefly, but took a more important position in Ravenna the next year, where he was hired to build an entirely new music practice at the cathedral. By 1580 his services were much in demand, and there was competition for him; he declined an offer from Milan, moving instead between positions in several cities. In addition he had become a renowned teacher by this time, and numerous composers of the next generation learned their contrapuntal skills from Porta. His last years were spent in Padua, and they were clearly difficult. Musical standards there began to decline, and he faced in addition the burden of ill health and the jealousy of the man who was eventually to replace him. He died in Padua. He is buried in the Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua.

==Style==

Most of Porta&#x27;s output is sacred music, especially motets. He published at least eight books of motets, one of which is known to be lost, as well as books of masses, introits, and a huge cycle of hymns for Vespers.

Porta&#x27;s music is even more polyphonic than that of Gombert, and he showed a liking for academic, even severe contrapuntal devices, although they are used so skillfully that the text can always be clearly understood. Often his music uses strict canons; one motet from his book of 52 motets from 1580, in seven voices, has no less than four of the voices entirely derived canonically. Another motet from this same book is a mensuration canon, that most difficult of all contrapuntal forms to carry off. While many composers were reacting to the strictures of the Council of Trent against excessive polyphonic practice, Porta evidently felt unobliged to follow them; perhaps he had sufficient confidence in his skill in conveying the text. His music is as carefully controlled as that of Palestrina, with cautious use of dissonance and chromaticism, while displaying polyphonic virtuosity to a degree uncommon in other composers of sacred music at the end of the 16th century.

Some of the later motets use polychoral writing extensively. Although Porta was not in Venice in the late part of the century, where this style had become famous (see Venetian polychoral style), he had spent years there as a student studying with Willaert, and the influence clearly lasted throughout his life. Most likely he was familiar with the current practice in Venice, and adopted some of the innovations which worked best with his highly learned style.

Porta also wrote madrigals. Many of these were clearly intended for specific occasions, such as weddings and large social events in the families of his employers; they are in a much simpler style than his sacred works, much in keeping with contemporary practice.

<text>USS &quot;Morris&quot; (DD-417), a World War II-era &quot;Sims&quot;-class destroyer in the service of the United States Navy, was named after Commodore Charles Morris. She was among the most decorated US Naval vessels of World War II.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Morris&quot; was laid down at the Norfolk Navy Yard, Portsmouth, Virginia, on 7 June 1938; launched on 1 June 1939, sponsored by Mrs. Charles R. Nutter, great-granddaughter of Commodore Morris; and commissioned on 5 March 1940, with Commander Harry B. Jarrett in command.

==Service history==
&quot;Morris&quot;, flagship of Destroyer Squadron 2 (DesRon 2), followed her shakedown with routine training schedules until the summer of 1941 when she joined the North Atlantic Patrol. With the entry of the United States into World War II, she entered Charleston Navy Yard, where she was equipped with the first fire control radar for a destroyer. By 3 January 1942, she was underway for Pearl Harbor, rejoining her squadron there at the end of February.

Attached to Task Force 17 (TF 17), the destroyer sailed on 16 March for Noumea, and into her first major enemy engagement, the Battle of the Coral Sea. Prior to the battle, she guarded the carriers of the task force as their planes struck at enemy shipping in Tulagi Harbor and in the Louisiade Archipelago. From 4–8 May, she splashed one enemy plane and damaged two while screening and , and when the latter was heavily damaged, pulled alongside to rescue some 500 survivors. Damage received during the rescue forced her back to Pearl Harbor where hurried repairs put her back into condition for the Battle of Midway a month later. In that action she again pulled alongside &quot;Yorktown&quot; to rescue over 500 survivors.

&quot;Morris&quot;″s next action came in late August, when she joined TF 61 in support of the Guadalcanal Campaign. For the next 2 months, she screened carriers and patrolled among the Solomon Islands. On 25 October, following a 3-day independent sweep through the Gilbert Islands, she rejoined TF 17 and took part in the Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. During the action, she destroyed six aircraft and once more came to the rescue of , from which she took on 550 survivors. As in other rescue operations her superstructure was damaged, but, after repairs at Espiritu Santo, she was back in the Guadalcanal area, first operating with and then as supply unit escort to .

In May 1943, &quot;Morris&quot; departed the southern Pacific and sailed north to support the capture and occupation of Attu Island and Kiska, the Aleutian end of the Japanese ribbon defense. Then she returned to San Francisco, California for a 7-week overhaul. In November, she again joined an air support group escorting , , and in the Gilberts offensive, during which she went to aid &quot;Liscome Bay&quot;. As the task forces pressed further into the central Pacific, &quot;Morris&quot; sailed with them into the Marshall Islands. On 30 January 1944, she led a column of warships in a shore bombardment mission against Wotje Atoll. Thence she steamed to Kwajalein Atoll, where, while providing close fire support off Namur, she wiped out a Japanese counterattack force from an adjacent island. In mid-February she departed Kwajalein and moved with TG 51.11 to support the seizure and occupation of Eniwetok. Arriving on 17 February, she continued carrier operations until 24 February, when she sailed for Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Morris&quot; returned to combat in April 1944, when as a unit of the 7th Fleet she took part in all the western New Guinea landings, beginning with Hollandia. In May and June she give fire support in the Toem-Wakde-Sarmi areas and then during the Biak Island operation. In July, she went against enemy guns on Noemfoor Island and then at Cape Sansapor. In August, she participated in operations against Halmahera and Morotai and then began preparations for the initial invasion of the Philippines.

On 16 October, with TG 8.6, she got underway for Leyte Gulf. Safely delivering her charges, transports with the first reinforcement groups aboard, on the 21st, she took up anti-aircraft station and, for several days, experienced meetings with the newest Japanese tactics: the &quot;kamikaze&quot;. Throughout the next month she continued to escort troops and supplies to Leyte. With the dawn of the new year, 1945, she was en route north for the Luzon operations. Arriving within the week she participated in pre-invasion bombardment and then provided fire support during the landings on 9 January. For 18 days she patrolled, bombarded shore positions, and fought off &quot;kamikazes&quot;.

Detached from the 7th Fleet after Luzon, &quot;Morris&quot; rejoined the 5th Fleet and prepared for Okinawa. On 1 April, she arrived off Kerama Retto with TG 51.11. For the next 5 days, she escorted transports and oilers and cruised in various assigned sectors on antiaircraft and antisubmarine patrols. On 6 April, while patrolling station A-11, a Nakajima B5N &quot;Kate&quot;, carrying either a heavy bomb or torpedo, closed in on her. &quot;Morris&quot;″s guns scored hits and set the plane afire, but could not stop it. Shortly after 1815, it crashed into the ship on the portside, between the Nos. 1 and 2 guns. Fires caused by the explosions spread quickly. Two hours were needed to bring them under control with another 30 minutes to extinguish them. &quot;Morris&quot; then returned to Kerama Retto where temporary repairs somewhat corrected her demolished bow and subsequent draft of 18 feet 3 inches, her large protrusion of plating on the starboard side, and her damaged steering. The ship suffered 13 dead, 45 wounded.

On 22 May, she started out across the Pacific, and on 18 June entered the San Francisco Naval Shipyard. Declared neither seaworthy nor habitable, she was decommissioned on 9 November. Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 28 November, she was stripped of gear and sold to Franklin Shipwrecking on 2 August 1947, then resold to the National Metal and Steel Corporation in Los Angeles, California on 17 July 1949, where she was scrapped.

==Awards==
&quot;Morris&quot; received 15 battle stars for her action in World War II, placing her among the most decorated US Naval vessels of World War II.

<text>The Ansted was an American automobile; successor to the Lexington and the Ansted-Lexington, it was manufactured from 1926 to 1927. Following the sale of the Lexington plant in Connersville, Indiana to Auburn, the company marketed its last cars as Ansteds. They were the same as Lexingtons, differing only in their radiators, emblems, and hubcaps.

<text>Claudio Merulo (; 8 April 1533 – 4 May 1604) was an Italian composer, publisher and organist of the late Renaissance period, most famous for his innovative keyboard music and his ensemble music composed in the Venetian polychoral style. He was born in Correggio and died in Parma. Born Claudio Merlotti, he Latinised his surname (meaning little blackbird) when he became famous in Venetian cultural clubs.

==Life==
Little is known about his early life except that he studied in Correggio with Tuttovale Menon, a famous madrigalist who also worked in the Ferrara court; he also studied with Girolamo Diruta, an organist. It is likely that he studied with Zarlino at St. Mark&#x27;s in Venice. While in Venice he became close friends with Costanzo Porta, a friendship which was to endure for his entire life. On 21 October 1556, he was appointed organist at Old Cathedral of Brescia (Duomo Vecchio), and his skill as an organist must have been impressive, because he became organist at St. Mark&#x27;s, one of the most prestigious positions for an organist in Italy, in 1557; he was selected over a list of candidates that included Andrea Gabrieli. This was the first important event of his career, and he was considered to be the finest organist in Italy.

It is important to note that in St. Mark&#x27;s there were two organs, and two separate organists were appointed to play them: in 1557 Merulo was appointed to the second, smaller organ, while Annibale Padovano remained at the post of first organist.

After Padovano&#x27;s hurried departure from Venice in 1566, Merulo was appointed to the first organ, and Andrea Gabrieli became the second organist. He was appointed as ambassador of Venetian Republic at the marriage of Franceso de’ Medici and Bianca Cappello in 1579 and wrote music of celebration for Henry III of France, who visited Venice in 1574.

In 1584, he suddenly left this position in Venice. The reasons for this are unclear, and somewhat surprising; in Venice he was well-paid, and had a very good reputation; and St. Mark&#x27;s was one of the most important places for an organist. However, in December 1584 his name appears in payment register of Farnesia Court of Parma.

In 1587 he was appointed as organist in Parma Cathedral and from 1591 also in Church of Santa Maria della Steccata. While here, he requested improvements to the organ, carried out by Costanzo Antegnati, the last heir of the great Brescian family of organ makers. We can deduce that Merulo used the Steccata&#x27;s organ for his proofs of new composition, based on his Venetian experience, and continued to compose in this style.

He lived in Parma until his death. During this period, he made several trips in Venice and Rome, where he published his famous two volume &quot;Toccate per organo&quot;.

Merulo died in Parma on 4 May 1604 and was buried in Parma Cathedral near to the tomb of Cipriano de Rore. He left a daughter and his wife Amabilia Banzola.

==Music and influence==
Merulo is famous for his keyboard music. His Toccatas, in particular, are innovative; he was the first to contrast sections of contrapuntal writing with passageworks; often he inserts sections which could be called ricercars into pieces which otherwise are labelled toccatas or canzonas. (In the late 16th century, these terms are only approximately descriptive; different composers clearly had different ideas of what they meant). Often his keyboard pieces begin as though they are to be a transcription of vocal polyphony, but then gradually add embellishment and elaboration until they reach a climactic passage of considerable virtuosity. Sometimes, especially in his later music, he develops ornaments which acquire the status of a motif, which is then used developmentally; this anticipates a principal generative technique in the Baroque era. Often Merulo casually ignores the &quot;rules&quot; of voice-leading, giving the music an expressive intensity more associated with the late school of madrigalists than with keyboard music of the time. His keyboard music was hugely influential, and his ideas can be seen in the music of Sweelinck, Frescobaldi and others; because of the immense influence of Sweelinck as a teacher, much of the virtuoso keyboard technique of the north German organ school, culminating in Johann Sebastian Bach, can claim to be descended from the innovations of Merulo.

Even though the fame of his instrumental music has overshadowed much of his a cappella vocal output, Merulo was also a madrigalist. Since he was a member of what is known today as the Venetian School, he also wrote motets for double choir in the manner of Andrea and Giovanni Gabrieli. He published two books of Madrigali a 5 voices (1566 and 1604), one of Madrigali a 4 (1579) and a 3 (1580).

The famous essay of keyboard technique &quot;Il Transilvano&quot; (1593), by Girolamo Diruta, was dedicated to Merulo, indicating his status as one of the most important keyboard players of the Italian Renaissance.

<doc id="855077" wikidata="Q209494" url="?curid=855077" title="2.4 Metre">
<text>The International 2.4mR is a one-person keelboat. The class is a development class governed by the 2.4mR rule. The rule controlled by World Sailing (formerly known as ISAF) is one of the few classes designated as an International Class. The International 2.4mR Class rule is closely related to the International 12mR class rule that was used at the America&#x27;s Cup.

While there is a small but active group of amateur or professional designers and builders around the world, around 90% of the 2.4mR boats are the commercially produced Norlin Mark III designed by Swedish yacht designer Peter Norlin. Over the years, new 2.4mR designs such as the Stradivari III, the Proton and the Super 3 have come into production.

The 2.4mR boats are primarily used for racing and the class holds highly competitive national events in many countries. World and European championships can attract as many as 100 boats at a time.

The 2.4mR is ideal for adaptive sailing since the sailor barely moves in the boat, and all settings can be adjusted from a facing forward seated position. Both hand-steering and foot-steering are possible. The boat is sailed without a spinnaker, but it is equipped with a whisker-pole that is extending outward to hold the shape of the jib when sailing downwind. The boat&#x27;s capability as a truly inclusive sailing boat has been demonstrated over many years at multiple Open World Championships.

==History==
After the 1980 America&#x27;s Cup, people in the Newport, RI area started sailing boats called Mini-12s. They were named after the 12-Metre yachts that were used at the America&#x27;s Cup. As the fleet started to grow, the word spread to Sweden, home of the yacht designer Peter Norlin. Peter Norlin refined the original designs, and along with other naval architects, they collectively initiated the International 2.4mR Class that we know today. Although the 2.4mR is a development class, Peter Norlin has become the dominant designer, and the class is therefore often mistaken as a one-design class.

==One-design==
In recent years attempts have been made to develop a one-design class based on the 2.4 Norlin Mark III. This was primarily because the competition within the Paralympics was meant to be more about the sailors&#x27; competitiveness and less about the equipment. This led to the introduction of Appendix K to the Class rules and a group of individuals started to work on a set of stand-alone one-design rules. This is still at the early stages but this effort is likely to lead to the emergence of a new one-design 2.4mR class alongside the existing development 2.4mR class.

==Rating formula==
As an open class rather than a one-design, all boat designs must meet the following formula.

:formula_1

(all measurements in mm)
* L = the &quot;corrected&quot; length of the hull (see rule D.6.3)
* d = the midship girth difference (see rule D.6.4)
* F = the average freeboard height (see rule D.6.5)
* S = the total rated area of the mainsail and jib combined.

==Events==

===Open World Championships===
===Para World Sailing Championships===

The 2.4 metre has been used a number of times as equipment for the One-Person Technical Disabled discipline which holds an annual World Championships.
===Paralympics===

From 2000 to 2016, the 2.4 Metre was the official single-crew class boat for sailing at the Summer Paralympics although it was used in a more one-design form utilising the Norlin Mk3 design.

<text>The Cray Operating System (COS) is a Cray Research operating system for its now-discontinued Cray-1 (1976) and Cray X-MP supercomputers. It succeeded the Chippewa Operating System (shipped with earlier Control Data Corporation CDC 6000 series and 7600 computer systems), and was the Cray main OS until replaced by UNICOS in the late 1980s. COS was delivered with Cray Assembly Language (CAL), Cray FORTRAN (CFT), and Pascal.

==Design==
As COS was written by ex-Control Data employees, its command language and internal organization bore strong resemblance to the CDC SCOPE operating system on the CDC 7600 and before that EXEC*8 from CDC&#x27;s earlier ERA/Univac pedigree. User jobs were submitted to COS via front-end computers via a high-speed channel interface, and so-called &quot;station software&quot;. Front end stations were typically large IBM or Control Data mainframes. However the DEC VAX was also a very popular front-end. Interactive use of COS was possible through the stations, but most users simply submitted batch jobs.

Disk-resident datasets used by a user program were &#x27;local&#x27; to the individual job. Once a job completed, its local datasets would be released and space reclaimed. In order to retain the data between jobs, datasets had to be explicitly made &#x27;permanent&#x27;. Magnetic tape datasets were also supported on Cray systems which were equipped with an I/O Subsystem.

COS also provided job scheduling and checkpoint/restart facilities to manage large workloads, even across system downtimes (both scheduled and unscheduled.)

Internally, COS was divided into a very small message-passing EXEC, and a number of System Task Processors (STP tasks). Each STP task was similar in nature to the peripheral processor programs in earlier Control Data operating systems, but since the Cray machines did not have peripheral processors, the main central processor executed the operating system code.

===List of STP tasks===

<text>The Europe is a one-person dinghy designed in Belgium in 1960 by Alois Roland as a class legal Moth dinghy. The design later changed into its own one-design class.

The dinghy is ideal for sailors weighing 50–85 kilos. The hull is made of fibre glass and weighs 45 kg, fully rigged 60 kg. The dinghy is tapering in the stem and round in the bottom. The sail is made of dacron. The mast is made of carbon fibre and specially designed to the sailor. A soft mast is best for light sailors, while heavier sailors use stiffer masts. Sails are also specially designed according to mast stiffness and crew weight.

The Europe was introduced as an Olympic class in the 1992 Summer Olympics as the women&#x27;s single-handed dinghy. It was replaced by the Laser Radial in the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Since 2008 the Europe is one of the Vintage Yachting Classes at the Vintage Yachting Games.

<text>Curtis Frye (born October 20, 1951, in Vass, North Carolina) is the head coach for the University of South Carolina Track and Field teams. He served as an assistant coach for the United States women&#x27;s track and field team at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.

Fry&#x27;s coaching specialties are the hurdling events, sprints, and relays. These are also his areas of responsibility on the US Women&#x27;s Olympic team.

Before coming to South Carolina, Frye was an assistant coach at East Carolina University, the University of Florida, North Carolina State University, and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

At Florida he coached Dennis Mitchell, who went on to win the bronze medal in the 100 meter dash at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

At North Carolina, he coached athletes such as Marion Jones and Allen Johnson. Johnson still trains with Frye in Columbia, South Carolina and is a volunteer assistant coach for the Gamecocks.

At South Carolina, some of his most successful athletes include Terrence Trammell, Demetria Washington, Miki and Lisa Barber, Otis Harris, Aleen Bailey, Lashinda Demus, Natasha Hastings and Tiffany Ross-Williams.

His teams have consistently finished high in the four NCAA championship events and the women team won the national title in the 2002 NCAA Women&#x27;s Outdoor Track and Field Championship, the school&#x27;s first NCAA Championship title. That year he was named the national coach of the year.

Frye also formed the Speed Elite, a group of high quality athletes like Johnson and Monique Hennagan, that have the goal to compete in and win national and international competitions.

Curtis Frye puts a high value on education and ensures that all of his student athletes graduate from college. Of the almost 200 individuals he has coached at the University of South Carolina, all but one have finished their undergraduate work and earned a degree from the school.

In 2015, Frye was investigated by South Carolina for allegations of assault by one of his players. He was given a light reprimand, and the player was allowed to sit out the next season without losing her scholarship.

On June 15, 2023, Frye announced that he was retiring, effective June 30 of that year.

<doc id="855090" wikidata="Q1854757" url="?curid=855090" title="Antoinette (manufacturer)">
<text>Antoinette was a French manufacturer of light petrol engines. Antoinette also became a pioneer-era builder of aeroplanes before World War I, most notably the record-breaking monoplanes flown by Hubert Latham and René Labouchère. Based in Puteaux, the Antoinette concern was in operation between 1903 and 1912. The company operated a flying school at Chalons for which it built one of the earliest flight simulators.

==Private engine-building venture==
Antoinette began as a private venture led by the engineer Léon Levavasseur and financed by Jules Gastambide, who owned an electricity generating station in Algeria. While on holiday with Gastambide and his family in 1902, Levavasseur expressed his interest in the emerging field of aviation and proposed the development of light, powerful engines for use in aircraft. Levavasseur then suggested to Gastambide&#x27;s daughter, Antoinette, that the engines should be named after her. Gastambide financed the venture. Levavasseur patented the V8 engine configuration that year. By 1904, most of the prize-winning speedboats in Europe were powered with Antoinette engines. During this time, he designed engines of various configurations of up to thirty-two cylinders.

==Antoinette incorporates==
La Société Antoinette was incorporated in 1906, with Gastambide as president and Levavasseur as technical director. Aviation pioneer Louis Blériot was the vice-president.

Antoinette displayed an automobile with a , V8 engine in the 1906 Paris Salon de l&#x27;Automobile of that year.

The company&#x27;s primary business was the sale of engines to aircraft builders. Their engines were used in the Santos-Dumont 14-bis of 1906, Paul Cornu&#x27;s rudimentary helicopter of 1907, the Voisin biplane that was modified and piloted by Henri Farman who used it to complete Europe&#x27;s first 1 kilometer circular flight in January 1908, and other significant pioneer aircraft.

The Farman-Voisin biplane was powered by a water-cooled Antoinette V8 engine which developed at 1,400 rpm. It used an early form of manifold injection and weighed only 190 pounds in working order, including the water-filled cooling system. The engine block was cast aluminium, holding removable steel cylinders. Levavasseur&#x27;s Antoinette engines often included advanced features, including then called &quot;direct petrol injection&quot; manifold injection, and evaporative engine cooling.

==Aircraft manufacture==
Levavasseur experimented with the construction of aircraft and in 1906 the Antoinette company was contracted to build an aircraft for Captain Ferdinand Ferber. In 1908 Blériot tried to dissuade the directors of Antoinette from becoming aircraft manufacturers, fearing that they would begin competing against him for customers. Blériot left the company when his advice was ignored.

===Flying school at Châlons===
In early 1909, the Antoinette company worked with the French Army at Camp Châlons near Mourmelon-le-Grand to establish the first military aircraft trials, a flight school and a workshop. The school included the Antoinette Trainer – a rudimentary flight simulator that comprised a half-barrel mounted on a universal joint, with flight controls, pulleys, and stub-wings (poles) to allow the pilot to maintain balance while instructors applied external forces.

One of their earliest pupils was the adventurer Hubert Latham. Within months of learning to fly Latham became the company&#x27;s principal instructor. His pupils in 1909 included Marie Marvingt, who became the first woman to fly combat missions as a bomber pilot and established air ambulance services throughout the world, and Infante Alfonso, Duke of Galliera, cousin of King Alfonso XIII of Spain and the first Spanish military pilot.

===Aircraft promotion with Latham===
In the spring of 1909, Latham made several impressive flights. This convinced Levavasseur that Latham could cross the English Channel in an Antoinette aircraft and win the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; prize for doing so. Latham made two attempts to cross the English Channel in July 1909, both of which were unsuccessful due to engine failure while over the Channel. Between Latham&#x27;s attempts, former Antoinette vice-president Blériot successfully crossed the Channel in his own aircraft using a simpler and more reliable air-cooled Anzani W3 engine and a more efficient Lucien Chauvière &quot;Integrale&quot; propeller.

Latham&#x27;s efforts to promote Antoinette products were more successful at the &quot;Grande Semaine d&#x27;Aviation de la Champagne&quot; on 22–29 August 1909 at Reims, France, where he won the altitude prize, finished second in the speed competition, took third place in the Gordon Bennett Cup for aeroplanes, and, in the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; event, trying to fly the longest distance around the circuit in a single uninterrupted flight, he won second prize in one aircraft (an Antoinette IV) and fifth prize in another (an Antoinette VII).

At the 1910 Gordon Bennett Trophy race at Belmont Park in the United States, Latham flew an Antoinette VII with a V16 engine.

===Aircraft built by Antoinette===

==Turbulent times and the end of Antoinette==

Levavasseur left the Antoinette company in November 1909, shortly after Gastambide. Gastambide and Levavasseur returned to the company in March 1910, Gastambide as president of the board and managing director and Lavavasseur as technical director. After Levavasseur&#x27;s return, he designed the Antoinette military monoplane, a streamlined monoplane with cantilever wings, which was ultimately rejected by the military. The Antoinette company went bankrupt shortly afterward.

<text>Jeanne-Marie Bouvier de La Motte Guyon (commonly known as Madame Guyon, ; 13 April 1648 – 9 June 1717) was a French Christian accused of advocating Quietism, which was considered heretical by the Roman Catholic Church. Madame Guyon was imprisoned from 1695 to 1703 after publishing the book &quot;A Short and Very Easy Method of Prayer&quot;.

==Personal life==
Guyon was the daughter of &quot;Claude Bouvier&quot;, a procurator of the tribunal of Montargis, 110 kilometers south of Paris and 70 kilometers east of Orléans. She was sickly in her childhood, and her education was neglected. Her childhood was spent between the convent, and the home of her affluent parents, moving nine times in ten years. Guyon&#x27;s parents were very religious, thus they gave her an especially pious upbringing. Other important impressions from her youth came from reading the works of St. Francis de Sales, and being educated by nuns. Prior to her marriage, she had wanted to become a nun, but this desire did not last long.

In 1664, when she was 15 years old, after turning down many other marriage proposals, she was forced into an arranged marriage to a wealthy gentleman of Montargis, Jacques Guyon, aged thirty eight. During their marriage, Guyon suffered at the hands of her mother-in-law and maidservant. Adding to her misery were the deaths of her half-sister, followed by her mother, and her son. Her daughter and father then died within days of each other in July 1672. She bore another son and daughter shortly before her husband&#x27;s death in 1676. After twelve years of being unhappily married and after the birth of five children, of whom three survived, Madame Guyon became a widow at the age of 28.

=== Date of birth ===

There is controversy surrounding the date of birth of Madame Guyon, but 18 April 1648 given in the (highly condensed) English translation of Madame Guyon&#x27;s autobiography, published by Moody Press, appears to be a typographical error—all French editions of the autobiography from the earliest one on, published in 1720, state 13 April 1648 as her birthday. Her date of birth, however, nonetheless remains unclear since Madame Guyon writes &quot;Je naquis, à ce que disent quelques uns, la veille de Pâques, le 13. d&#x27;Avril [...] de l&#x27;année 1648&quot; (&quot;I was born, as some say, on the Eve of Easter [...], the 13th of April of the year 1648&quot;). The 13th of April 1648 was, however, the Monday after Easter of that year, and Holy Saturday did not fall on 13 April in the years around 1648 either.

Given that births in France were recorded only in the parish registers &quot;(registres paroissiaux)&quot; until 1792, it is possible that Madame Guyon was born on 11 April 1648 (Holy Saturday), but that her birth was not recorded in the parish register until 13 April (the Monday after Easter, which was established as a holiday only under Napoleon), and that the date of the entry (13 April 1648) was then handed down. It is, of course, also possible that those making the claims were mistaken, or that there were other reasons for naming the Eve of Easter as her birthday.

==Career==

Already during her marriage, Guyon retained belief in God&#x27;s perfect plan, fiercely believing that she would be blessed in suffering. This became true especially after being introduced to mysticism by Fr. François Lacombe, the superior of the Barnabite house in Thonon in Savoy. After her husband&#x27;s death, Madame Guyon initially lived quietly as a wealthy widow in Montargis, before re-establishing contact with François Lacombe in 1679.

After three mystical experiences, Madame Guyon felt drawn to Geneva. The Bishop of Geneva, Jean d’Arenthon d’Alex, persuaded her to use her money to set up a house for &quot;new Catholics&quot; in Gex, in Savoy, as part of broader plans to convert Protestants in the region. In July 1680, Madame Guyon left Montargis with her young daughter and travelled to Gex.

The project was problematic, however, and Guyon clashed with the sisters who were in charge of the house. The Bishop of Geneva sent Father Lacombe to intervene. At this point, Guyon introduced Lacombe to a mysticism of interiority. While her daughter was in an Ursuline convent in Thonon as a pensioner, Madame Guyon continued in Gex, experiencing illness and great difficulties, including opposition from her family. She gave over guardianship of her two sons to her mother-in-law and took leave of her personal possessions, although keeping a sizeable annuity for herself.

Because of Guyon&#x27;s ideas on mysticism, the Bishop of Geneva, who had at first viewed her coming with pleasure, asked her to leave his diocese, and at the same time he expelled Father Lacombe, who then went to Vercelli.

Madame Guyon followed her director to Turin, then returned to France and stayed at Grenoble, where she spread her religious convictions more widely with the publication of &quot;Moyen court et facile de faire oraison&quot; in January 1685. The Bishop of Grenoble, Cardinal Le Camus, was perturbed by the appeal her ideas aroused and she left the city at his request, rejoining Lacombe at Vercelli. In July of the following year, the pair returned to Paris, where Madame Guyon set about to gain adherents for her mystical vision. The timing was ill-chosen; Louis XIV, who had recently been exerting himself to have the Quietism of Molinos condemned at Rome, was by no means pleased to it see gaining ground, even in his own capital, a form of mysticism which, to him, resembled that of Molinos in many of its aspects. By his order Lacombe was imprisoned in the Bastille, and afterwards in the castles of Oloron and of Lourdes. The arrest of Madame Guyon, delayed by illness, followed on 29 January 1688, brought about, she claimed, by Father de La Motte, her brother and a Barnabite.

She was not released until seven months later, after she had placed in the hands of the theologians, who had examined her book, a retraction of the propositions which it contained. Some days later she met, at Beyne, in the Duchess de Béthune-Charrost&#x27;s country house, her cousin, François Fénelon, who was to be the most famous of her supporters. Fénelon was deeply impressed by her piety.

Through Fenelon, the influence of Madame Guyon reached and influenced religious circles powerful at court—the Beauvilliers, the Chevreuses, and the Montemarts—who followed his spiritual guidance. Madame de Maintenon and, through her, the young ladies of Saint-Cyr, were soon won over to the new mysticism. This was at the height of Madame Guyon&#x27;s influence, most of all when Fénelon was appointed on 18 August 1688 to be the tutor to the Duke of Burgundy, the king&#x27;s grandson. Before long, however, Paul Godet des Marais, Bishop of Chartres, in whose diocese Saint-Cyr was located, took alarm at the spiritual ideas which were spreading there. Warned by him, Madame de Maintenon sought the advice of persons whose piety and wisdom she valued, and these advisers were unanimous in their rejection of Madame Guyon&#x27;s ideas. Madame Guyon then asked for an examination of her conduct and her writings by civil and ecclesiastical judges. The king consented that her writings should be submitted to the judgment of Bossuet, Louis-Antoine, Cardinal de Noailles, and of Tronson, superior of the Society of Saint-Sulpice.

After a number of secret conferences held at Issy, where Tronson was detained by a sickness, the commissioners presented in thirty-four articles the principles of Catholic teaching as to spirituality and the interior life (four of these articles were suggested by Fénelon, who in February had been nominated to the Archbishopric of Cambrai). But on 10 October 1694 François de Harlay de Champvallon, the Archbishop of Paris, who had been excluded from the conferences at Issy, anticipated their results by condemning the published works of Madame Guyon. She, fearing another arrest, took refuge for some months at Meaux, with the permission of Bossuet who was the presiding bishop there. After placing in his hands her signed submission to the thirty-four articles of Issy, she returned secretly to Paris. At Paris, the police, however, arrested her on 24 December 1695 and imprisoned her, first at Vincennes, then in a convent at Vaugirard, and then in the Bastille, where on 23 August 1699 she again signed a retraction of her theories and promised to refrain from spreading them further. From that time on she took no part, personally, in public discussions, but the controversy about her ideas only grew all the more heated between Bossuet and Fénelon.

Madame Guyon remained imprisoned in the Bastille until 21 March 1703, when after more than seven years of her final captivity, she went to live with her son in a village in the Diocese of Blois. There she passed some fifteen years surrounded by a stream of pilgrims, many from England and Scotland, and spending her time writing volumes of correspondence and poetry. She continued to be revered by the Beauvilliers, the Chevreuses, and Fénelon, who communicated with her when safe and discreet intermediaries were available. Among the pilgrims, Milord Chewinkle stayed in Blois with Guyon for 7 years. One visitor, Pierre Poiret, went on to publish many of Guyon&#x27;s works.

One of her greatest works, published in 1717 by Pierre Poiret—&quot;Ame Amante de son Dieu, representée dans les emblems de Hermannus Hugo sur ses pieux desirs—&quot;features her poetry written in response to the striking and popular emblem images of the Jesuit Herman Hugo and the Flemish master Otto von Veen. Guyon herself states that she took these emblems into the Bastille.

=== Beliefs about prayer ===
Guyon believed that one should pray at all times and devote all of one&#x27;s time to God. &quot;Prayer is the key of perfection and of sovereign happiness; it is the efficacious means of getting rid of all vices and of acquiring all virtues; for the way to become perfect is to live in the presence of God. He tells us this Himself: &#x27;walk before Me and be blameless&#x27; Genesis 17:1. Prayer alone can bring you into His presence, and keep you there continually.&quot; As she wrote in one of her poems: &quot;There was a period when I chose a time and place for prayer. ... But now I seek that constant prayer, in inward stillness known ...&quot;

=== Grace vs. works ===
In the Christian dispute regarding grace and works, Guyon defended the belief that salvation is the result of grace rather than works. Like St. Augustine, St. Thomas Aquinas, Calvin, and Martin Luther, she thought that a person&#x27;s deliverance can only come from God as an outside source, never from within the person himself or herself. As a result of His own free will, God bestows his favour as a gift. In her autobiography, for example, Madame Guyon criticized self–righteous people who try to gain heaven through their works. She praised lowly sinners who merely submitted themselves to God&#x27;s will. Of the so-called righteous, she wrote: &quot;the righteous person, supported by the great number of works of righteousness he presumes to have done, seems to hold his salvation in his own hands, and regards heaven as the recompense due to his merits... His Saviour is, for him, almost useless. &quot;These &#x27;righteous persons&#x27; expect God to save them as a reward for their good works.&quot; In contrast to the self-sufficient, &quot;righteous&quot; egoists, the sinners who have selflessly submitted to God &quot;are carried swiftly by the wings of love and confidence into the arms of their Saviour, who gives them gratuitously what He has infinitely merited for them.&quot; God&#x27;s &quot;bounties are effects of His will, and not the fruits of our merits.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
In 1704, her works were published in the Netherlands, becoming popular. Englishmen and Germans visited her at Blois, among them Johann Wettstein and Lord Forbes. She spent the remainder of her life in retirement with her daughter, the Marquise de Blois, at Blois, where she died at the age of 69, believing that she had died submissive to the Catholic Church, from which she had never had any intention of separating herself.

Her published works, the &quot;Moyen Court&quot; and the &quot;Règles des associées à l&#x27;Enfance de Jésus&quot;, were both placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum in 1688. Fénelon&#x27;s &quot;Maximes des saints&quot; was also condemned by both the Pope and the bishops of France.

An anonymous 18th-century manuscript, hand-written in French, entitled &quot;Supplement to the life of Madame Guyon&quot; exists in the Bodleian Library at Oxford University, which sets forth many fresh details about the Great Conflict which surrounded Madame Guyon.

<text>Olivetti S.p.A. is an Italian manufacturer of computers, tablets, smartphones, printers and other such business products as calculators and fax machines. Headquartered in Ivrea, in the Metropolitan City of Turin, the company is owned by TIM S.p.A. since 2003.

The company is known for innovative product design, ranging from the 1950s Lettera 22 portable typewriter, to some of the first commercial programmable desktop calculators, such as the 1964 Programma 101, as well as the pop-art inspired Valentine typewriter of 1969. Between 1954 and 2001, Italy&#x27;s Association of Industrial Design (ADI) awarded 16 Compasso d&#x27;Oro prizes to Olivetti products and designs – more than any other company or designer. At one point in the 1980s, Olivetti was the world&#x27;s third largest personal computer manufacturer and remained the largest such European manufacturer during the 1990s.

== History ==
=== Founding ===
The company was founded as a typewriter manufacturer by Camillo Olivetti in 1908 in the Turin commune of Ivrea, Italy. The firm was mainly developed by his son Adriano Olivetti.

Olivetti opened its first overseas manufacturing plant in 1930, and its Divisumma electric calculator was launched in 1948. Olivetti produced Italy&#x27;s first electronic computer, the transistorised Elea 9003, in 1959, and purchased the Underwood Typewriter Company that year. In 1964 the company sold its electronics division to the American company General Electric. In order to qualify for new loans, bankers made it a condition that the company&#x27;s electronic division be sold to General Electric. It continued to develop new computing products on its own; one of these was Programma 101, one of the first commercially produced programmable calculators. In the 1970s and 1980s, they were the biggest manufacturer for office machines in Europe and 2nd biggest PC vendor behind IBM in Europe. Olivetti also inspired Thomas J. Watson Jr. to change IBM&#x27;s approach to industrial design beginning in the 1950s.

In 1980, Olivetti began distributing in Indonesia through Dragon Computer &amp; Communication.

In 1981, Olivetti installed the electronic voting systems for the European Parliament in Strasburg and Luxembourg.

In 1986, the company acquired Triumph-Adler, a major office equipment manufacturer based in Germany that also produced typewriters, from Litton Industries of the United States. With this acquisition, Olivetti grabbed 50 percent of the European typewriter market.

In September 1994, the company launched Olivetti Telemedia chaired by Elserino Piol.

Since 2003, Olivetti has been part of the Telecom Italia Group through a merger.

=== Design ===


Olivetti became famous for the meticulous attention it paid to the design of its products, through collaborations with notable architects and designers, over a nearly 60-year period starting in the late 1930s. An early example is the portable 1932 Olivetti MP1 (Modello Portatile in Italian).

From the 1940s to the 1960s, Olivetti industrial design was led by Marcello Nizzoli, who was responsible for the Lexicon 80 and the portable Lettera 22 typewriters, which were released in 1948 and 1950 respectively. The architect and designer Ettore Sottsass began consulting for Olivetti in the late 1950s and designed a series of products including the Tekne 3 typewriter in 1958, the Elea 9003 computer in 1959, and later, the Praxis 48 typewriter in 1964 and the Valentine portable typewriter in 1969.

In 1954, Mario Tchou joined Olivetti and was in put in charge of a team responsible for creating a commercial computer. In 1957, the team created the Elea 9001. Tchou went on to lead a team of 500 engineers, and decided to include transistors in the Elea 9003.

Mario Bellini joined Sottsass at Olivetti in 1963. He designed the Programma 101 (1965), the Divisumma 18 (1973), and the Logos 68 (1973) calculators, and in 1966 the TCV-250 video display terminal. Mario Bellini and Ettore Sottsass, who by then directed design for Olivetti, hired designers such as George Sowden and James Irvine. Sowden worked for Olivetti from 1970 until 1990 and designed the company&#x27;s first desktop computer, the Olivetti L1, in 1978 (following ergonomic research lasting two years). In 1991, Sowden&#x27;s design for the Olivetti fax OFX420 won the ADI Compasso d&#x27;Oro Award. In 1999 Michele De Lucchi designed the Art Jet 10 inkjet printer, which was also awarded the Compasso d&#x27;Oro, and in 2001, the Gioconda calculator.

In 1952, the Museum of Modern Art in New York (MoMA) held an exhibit titled &quot;Olivetti: Design in Industry&quot; Another exhibit was mounted by the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris in 1969 and later toured five other cities. Many Olivetti products and archival material related to design are held in museum collections including the MoMA design collection, the Cooper Hewitt in New York, and the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Between 1954 and 2001, Olivetti won 16 Compasso d&#x27;Oro awards for design. In May 2022, ADI Design Museum in Milan paid tribute to this achievement with an exhibition titled Podium 16.

Olivetti paid attention to more than product design. Graphic design and architectural design was also considered pivotal to the company, which engaged architects and designers such as Gae Aulenti, , BBPR, Egon Eiermann, , Ignazio Gardella, Louis Kahn, Le Corbusier, Carlo Scarpa, Giovanni Pintori, Bob Noorda, and Lella and Massimo Vignelli to design factories, office buildings, showrooms, and publicity materials.

Giovanni Pintori was hired by Adriano Olivetti in 1936 to work in the publicity department. Pintori was the creator of the Olivetti logo and many promotional posters used to advertise the company and its products. During his activity as Art Director from 1950, Olivetti&#x27;s graphic design obtained several international awards, and he designed works that created the Olivetti image and became emblematic Italian reference in the history of 20th-century design.

Those designers also created the Olivetti Synthesis office furniture series which mainly were used to be installed in the firm&#x27;s own headquarters, worldwide branch offices and showrooms. Olivetti also produced some industrial production machinery, including metalworking machines of the Horizon series.

=== Typewriters ===
Olivetti began with mechanical typewriters when the company was founded in 1909, and produced them until the mid-1990s. Until the mid-1960s, they were fully mechanical, and models such as the portable Olivetti Valentine were designed by Ettore Sottsass.

With the Tekne/Editor series and Praxis 48, some of the first electromechanical typewriters were introduced. The Editor series was used for speed typing championship competition. The Editor 5 from 1969 was the top model of that series, with proportional spacing and the ability to support justified text borders. In 1972 the electromechanical typeball machines of the Lexicon 90 to 94C series were introduced, as competitors to the IBM Selectric typewriters, the top model 94c supported proportional spacing and justified text borders like the Editor 5, as well as lift-off correction.

In 1978 Olivetti was one of the first manufacturers to introduce electronic daisywheel printer-based word processing machines, called TES 401 and TES 501. Later the ET series typewriters without (or with) LCD and different levels of text editing capabilities were popular in offices. Models in that line were ET 121, ET 201, ET 221, ET 225, ET 231, ET 351, ET 109, ET 110, ET 111, ET 112, ET 115, ET 116, ET 2000, ET 2100, ET 2200, ET 2250, ET 2300, Et 2400 and ET 2500. For home users in 1982 the Praxis 35, Praxis 40 and 45D were some of the first portable electronic typewriters. Later, Olivetti added the Praxis 20, ET Compact 50, ET Compact 60, ET Compact 70, ET Compact 65/66, the ET Personal series and Linea 101. The top models were 8 lines LCD based portables like Top 100 and Studio 801, with the possibility to save the text to a 3.5-inch floppy disk.

The professional line was upgraded with the ETV series video typewriters based on CP/M operating system, ETV 240, ETV 250, ETV 300, ETV 350 and later MS-DOS operating system based ETV 260, ETV 500, ETV 2700, ETV 2900, ETV 4000s word processing systems having floppy drives or hard disks. Some of them (ETV 300, 350, 500, 2900) were external boxes that could be connected through an optional serial interface to many of the ET series office typewriters, the others were fully integrated with an external monitor which could be installed on a holder over the desk. Most of the ET/ETV/Praxis series electronic typewriters were designed by Marion Bellini.

By the 1970s and 1980s, the typewriter market had matured under the market dominance of large companies from Europe and the United States. Before the advent of dailywheel and electronic machines (and subsequently the personal computers and word processing software) — Olivetti and the other major manufacturers faced strong competition from typewriters from Asia, including Brother Industries and Silver Seiko Ltd. of Japan.

By 1994, Olivetti stopped production of typewriters, as most users had transitioned to personal computers.
=== Computers ===
Between 1955 and 1964 Olivetti developed some of the first transistorized mainframe computer systems, such as the Elea 9003. Although 40 large commercial 9003 and over 100 smaller 6001 scientific machines were completed and leased to customers to 1964, low sales, loss of two key managers and financial instability caused Olivetti to withdraw from the field in 1964.

In 1965 Olivetti released the Programma 101, considered one of the first commercial desktop programmable calculators. It was saved from the sale of the computer division to GE thanks to an employee, Gastone Garziera, who spent successive nights changing the internal categorization of the product from &quot;computer&quot; to &quot;calculator&quot;, so leaving the small team in Olivetti and creating some awkward situations in the office, since that space was now owned by GE. 
In 1974 the firm released the TC800, an intelligent terminal designed to be attached to a mainframe and used in the finance sector. It was followed in 1977 by the TC1800.

During the 1970s Olivetti also manufactured and sold two ranges of minicomputers. The &#x27;A&#x27; series started with the typewriter-sized A4 through to the large A8, and the desk-sized DE500 and DE700 series.

Olivetti&#x27;s first modern personal computer, the M20, featuring a Zilog Z8000 CPU, was released in 1982.
The M20 was followed in 1983 by the M24, a clone of the IBM PC using DOS and the Intel 8086 processor (at 8 MHz) instead of the Intel 8088 used by IBM (at 4.77 MHz). The M24 was sold in North America as the AT&amp;T 6300. Olivetti also manufactured the AT&amp;T 6300 Plus, which could run both DOS and Unix. The M24 in the US also was sold as Xerox 6060. The Olivetti M28 was the firm&#x27;s first PC to have the Intel 80286 processor.
The same year Olivetti produced its M10 laptop computer, an 8085-based workalike of the successful Radio Shack TRS-80 Model 100, which it marketed in Europe. These were the first laptops to sell in million-unit quantities, though the itself only attained sales figures in the tens of thousands and went out of production within two years.

During the 1980s and 1990s Olivetti continued to release PC compatible machines, facing mounting competition from other brands. It turned to laptops, introducing in 1991 the D33, a laptop in a carry case, and continuing with the M111, M211, S20, D33, Philos and Echos series. A very interesting subnotebook was the Quaderno, about the same size as an A5 paper – it was the grandfather of the netbooks introduced 20 years later.

Olivetti did attempt to recover its position by introducing the Envision in 1995, a full multimedia PC, to be used in the living room; this project was a failure. Gateway also introduced a similar product in the U.S., called the Destination 2000, around the same period, to a similarly mixed commercial reception.

The company continued to develop personal computers until it sold its PC business in 1997.

== End of Olivetti as a separate company ==
In the 1990s, Olivetti&#x27;s computer businesses were in great difficulty, reportedly because of the competition from US vendors and new cheap manufacturers for PC components in Taiwan like ASUS, MSI, Gigabyte and others from which local system builders profited much to offer cheaper PCs than Olivetti did with their own designs. It was on the brink of collapse and had needed government support to stay afloat.

In 1992, Digital Equipment Corporation announced its intention to invest in Olivetti, approximating to a 10% stake valued at around , amidst a wave of investment in European companies by their US counterparts. Digital were already reselling Olivetti personal computer models in Europe, and the investment presented an opportunity for the adoption of Digital&#x27;s Alpha processor in Olivetti&#x27;s workstation products. The investment programme was to be conducted in two steps over an 18-month period, augmented by additional share purchases. The partnership between the companies, regarded as a way of supporting Olivetti whilst cementing a development relationship around Digital&#x27;s Alpha platform, developed in the following two years, although the balance of revenue from selling products to each other was reported as being strongly in Olivetti&#x27;s favour, it having generated lire from Digital in 1993, but with Digital only selling products worth lire to Olivetti. Digital remained a significant purchaser of laser printers and laptops from Olivetti, but had begun to manufacture its own personal computers and planned to produce its own laptop products. Meanwhile, Olivetti had been slow to introduce Alpha-based products, eventually shipping models based on Digital&#x27;s own products. With Digital&#x27;s finances under pressure, posting quarterly losses and incurring costs around redundancies, the company sold its stake – noted as amounting to 7.8% – for .

A company in transition, it had moved out of the typewriter business into personal computers before embracing telecoms between 1997 and 1999, spinning off its personal computer business in 1997 and divesting its computer services business in 1998. In the process it had lost around three-quarters of its staff.

In 1999, The Luxembourg-based company Bell S.A. acquired a controlling stake in Olivetti, but sold it to a consortium including the Pirelli and Benetton groups two years later. Olivetti then launched a hostile bid for Telecom Italia in February 1999, despite being less than a seventh of the size of its target. In a take-over battle against Deutsche Telekom and other potential bidders that initially seem to have been settled in Deutsche Telecom&#x27;s favour, with an merger reportedly agreed in April 1999, Olivetti won out and controlled 52.12% of former monopoly Telecom Italia, Italy&#x27;s #1 fixed-line and mobile phone operator. However, the ownership structure of the merged Olivetti / Telecom Italia was complex and multi-layered with Olivetti took on around $16 billion of extra debt. It was then referred to as the &quot;Olivetti/Telecom Italia affair&quot; because of the unpleasant secret affairs behind.

After a 2003 reorganization, Olivetti became the office equipment and systems services subsidiary of Telecom Italia. In 2003 Olivetti was absorbed into the Telecom Italia Group, maintaining a separate identity as Olivetti Tecnost.

==Rebirth and resumption of computer production==
In 2005, Telecom Italia relaunched the company in the information technology sector, investing €200 million, at first restoring the original Olivetti brand, then replacing it with Olivetti Tecnost in 2003. In 2007, Olivetti launched the &quot;LINEA_OFFICE&quot;, designed by Jasper Morrison for Olivetti; a new line of PCs, notebooks, printers, fax machines and calculators. Olivetti today operates in Italy and Switzerland, and has sales associates in 83 countries. Research and development are located in Agliè, Carsoli and Scarmagno in Italy, and Yverdon, Switzerland.

In March 2011 Olivetti began producing the OliPad, its first tablet computer, featuring a ten-inch screen, 3G, WiFi, Bluetooth connectivity, Nvidia Tegra 2, Android 2.2.2 and a 1024 x 600 display. It also features an application store, with apps specifically designed by Olivetti for &#x27;business &amp; government&#x27;. In 2014 the R&amp;D department in Arnad was sold to SICPA.

==Smartphones==
In 2013, Olivetti launched a series of smartphones called &quot;Oliphone&quot;:

<text>Presley O&#x27;Bannon (c. 1776 – September 12, 1850) was a first lieutenant in the United States Marine Corps, famous for his exploits in the First Barbary War (1801–1805). In recognition of his bravery, he was presented a sword for his part in attempting to restore Prince Hamet Karamanli to his throne as the Bey of Tripoli. This sword became the model for the Mameluke Sword, adopted in 1825 for Marine Corps officers, which is part of the formal uniform today.

==Biography==
Presley Neville O&#x27;Bannon was born in Fauquier County, Virginia, to William O&#x27;Bannon, a captain of the Continental Army in the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), and Anne Neville, a sister of General John Neville, commander of Fort Pitt (formerly French Fort Duquesne, later Pittsburgh in western Pennsylvania) during the Revolution. O&#x27;Bannon was probably named after Neville&#x27;s son Presley, who was aide-de-camp to the Marquis de Lafayette.

O&#x27;Bannon entered the Marine Corps on January 18, 1801. As a first lieutenant assigned to , he commanded a detachment of seven Marines and two Navy midshipmen in diplomatic Consul General William Eaton&#x27;s (1764–1811) small army during the Tripoli campaign of the First Barbary War (1801–1805). In the combined operations with the U.S. Navy, he led the successful attack at the Battle of Derna, a coastal town in eastern modern Libya on April 27, 1805, giving the Marines&#x27; Hymn its line &quot;to the shores of Tripoli.&quot; Lieutenant O&#x27;Bannon became the first man to raise a United States flag over foreign soil in time of war; O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s superior, William Eaton (1764–1811), a former Army officer, had raised the American flag several months earlier while traveling on the Nile River from Alexandria to Cairo, but it had not been in a time of war. According to Marine Corps legend, Hamet Karamanli was so impressed with O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s bravery that he gave him a Mameluke sword as a gesture of respect.

O&#x27;Bannon resigned from the Marine Corps on March 6, 1807. He moved to Logan County, Kentucky, making his home in Russellville. He served in the Kentucky State Legislature in 1812, 1817, and 1820–21, and in the Kentucky State Senate from 1824 to 1826.

Some time before 1826, he married Matilda Heard, daughter of Major James Heard and Nancy Morgan, a daughter of American Revolutionary War general Daniel Morgan, commander at the Battle of Cowpens in South Carolina in 1781.

O&#x27;Bannon died in 1850 at age 74 in Pleasureville, Kentucky, where his daughter and nephew lived. In 1919, his remains were moved to the Frankfort Cemetery in Kentucky&#x27;s state capital.

==Mameluke sword==
Because of O&#x27;Bannon&#x27;s distinguished record during the Derna campaign, Marine Corps Commandant Archibald Henderson in 1825 adopted the Mameluke sword for wear by all Marine Corps commissioned officers. Since the initial distribution in 1826, the Mameluke sword has been worn except for the years 1859–1875, when regulations temporarily required Marine officers to wear the model U.S. Army M1850 foot officers&#x27; sword. Mameluke swords are worn by Marine Corps officers as prescribed with all uniforms except the evening dress and utility uniform.

==Namesakes==
Three Navy ships have been named USS &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; in his honor: 
* , a which was launched in 1919 and struck in 1936; 
*, a which was launched in 1942 and struck in 1970; USS O&#x27;Bannon(DD-450) in service during WWII and according to legend attacked a Japanese submarine with potatoes. 
*, a , which was launched in 1978 and struck in 2005.

O&#x27;Bannon Hall, at the Basic School in Quantico, Virginia is named in honor of Presley O&#x27;Bannon.

<text>Anzani was an engine manufacturer founded by the Italian Alessandro Anzani (1877–1956), which produced proprietary engines for aircraft, cars, boats, and motorcycles in factories in Britain, France and Italy.

==Overview==
From his native Italy, Anzani moved to France where he became involved in cycle racing. He moved on to motorcycles and designed and built a record-breaking lightweight engine. In 1907, he set up a small workshop in Paris with three staff and while they were building his engines, he designed a hydrofoil powered by one of his engines and propellers.

==Aircraft engines==
He supplied one of his engines to Enrico Forlanini and developed it further into a three-cylinder, air-cooled, radial engine ideal for the new aeroplanes. One of the early engines, the 25 hp Anzani W-3 or Fan type, was supplied to Louis Blériot who used it on his successful first aircraft crossing of the English Channel in 1909.

==New factories==
Demand for the engines continued to grow and the original Paris workshop was replaced by a new factory at Courbevoie, Paris, and one in London was also added as well as licensed production by other makers. Another factory at Monza, Italy was added in 1914.

==Motor racing==
In 1920, Anzani turned to motor racing and built a small car with one of his 750 cc two-cylinder engines, air-cooled of course, which won several competitions. They also made a 1098 cc cyclecar between 1923 and 1924, as used in the T.B. Sports cyclecar.

==Sale of factories==
On his 50th birthday in 1927, Anzani decided to sell his factories in Paris and London, keeping only the Monza works for sentimental reasons, and managed by Natale Baccanti.

==British Anzani==
In the UK, British Anzani outsourced the manufacture of their engines to Coventry Ordnance Works Ltd. In the 1920s, it was refinanced as British Vulpine Engine Company, and then again as British Anzani Engineering Company, concentrating on small engines and car and motorcycle powerplants. They supplied AC Cars with the 1496cc side-valve four-cylinder (that would become AC&#x27;s famous 2-litre motor), Frazer-Nash with a 1496cc side valve engine, (latterly supercharged) Morgan Motor Company with a V-twin, and Squire with the R1 twin cam engine. Berkeley Cars used small Anzani motorcycle engines in some models. British Anzani&#x27;s best known products were motorcycle, lawnmower and outboard engines. Cotton, Tandon and Greeves motorcycles used Anzani motors.

In later years, the company diversified. In the years after World War II, the company&#x27;s main product was the &#x27;Iron Horse&#x27; - a two-wheeled pedestrian-controlled ploughing engine and light tractor. In time, four-wheeled versions with the driver sitting on the front of the vehicle were produced. The company became the British Anzani Group, and was trading under that name when it went into liquidation in 1980.

The trademark &#x27;British Anzani&#x27; was re-registered in 2003 and the company, Anzani Ltd, in 2006. The company is supplying classic spares through Dolphin Engines of Launceston (Cornwall, UK) and is planning a return to the automotive, marine and transport industries, with products designed by Bo Zolland.

<text>William I (; 27 September 178125 June 1864) was King of Württemberg from 30 October 1816 until his death.

Upon William&#x27;s accession, Württemberg was suffering crop failures and famine in the &quot;Year Without a Summer&quot;, in 1816. After taking office, he initiated sweeping reforms, resulting in the approval of the Estates of Württemberg to a constitution on 25 September 1819. In his 48-year reign, the kingdom moved from one that was created from different denominational principalities and a heterogeneous agricultural country, into a constitutional state with a common identity and a well-organised management.

In addition to his successful domestic policy, he pursued throughout his reign an ambition focused on German and European foreign policy. Alongside the great powers of Prussia and Austria, he imagined a third major German power in the form of Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover and Württemberg. Although this plan never succeeded, it ensured a consistent, coherent and targeted policy during his reign.

William was the only German monarch who was forced to recognise the Frankfurt Constitution of 1848. After the failure of the March Revolution of 1848, he pursued reactionary policies that counteracted his liberal image from before the revolution. He died in 1864 at Rosenstein Castle in Bad Cannstatt and is buried in the Württemberg Mausoleum.

==Life==

===Youth===

Born at Lüben (after 1945 Lubin, Poland) on 27 September 1781, Frederick William (known as &quot;Fritz&quot; until the beginning of his reign) was the son of Duke Frederick William Charles of Württemberg (1754–1816) and his wife, Augusta of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1764–1788). 

The relationship between his mother and father was one of strife and discord. His father had entered the Prussian Army in 1774, then moved shortly after William&#x27;s birth to the service of the Russian Empress, Catherine the Great, who appointed him Governor of Eastern Finland. Although William&#x27;s mother gave birth in 1783 to his sister Catharina Frederica, then later that year to Sophia Dorothea, and Paul in 1785, the relationship between the parents continued to deteriorate. Augusta sought sanctuary from her abusive marriage and asked the Empress for protection in 1786. Catherine forced Frederick and his children to leave Russia and placed Augusta in the custody of a former royal huntsman, Reinhold Wilhelm von Pohlmann, by whom she allegedly later became pregnant. In the exhumation ordered by William himself, several years after, this was proven wrong. She died in 1788. In 1790, Frederick and his two sons moved to Ludwigsburg Palace. He made sure that his sons&#x27; educators were from Württemberg and their education, at the behest of their father, was regulated and very strict.

Charles Eugene, Duke of Württemberg died on 24 October 1793. He had ruled for 56 years and as he had no legitimate offspring, the duchy passed to his brothers, Louis Eugene in 1793, then two years later to Frederick II Eugene, who was Frederick William&#x27;s grandfather. Frederick William&#x27;s father thus became Hereditary Prince (Erbprinz) in 1795, then duke on 23 December 1797. In 1797, Duke Frederick&#x27;s father married Charlotte, Princess Royal, the daughter of King George III of Great Britain. They then began to look for a wife for Frederick William and potential brides included the Holy Roman Emperor&#x27;s sister, Archduchess Maria Amalia, and the Grand Duchesses Alexandra Pavlovna and Maria Pavlovna.

Duke Frederick&#x27;s relationship with his son also deteriorated. Frederick William often rebelled against his upbringing and his father. In 1799, Frederick William&#x27;s escape plans were discovered and his father had him temporarily arrested. After his release, Frederick William began studying at the University of Tübingen. After the War of the Second Coalition erupted and France marched under Napoleon in the spring of 1800, Frederick William, who had joined as a volunteer in the Austrian army, participated in the Battle of Hohenlinden in December 1800. In 1803 he attained the rank of Imperial Major General. Contemporaries have credited him with profound military knowledge, courage and bravery. 

After returning to Württemberg in 1801, Frederick William and his brother Paul began liaisons with the daughters of the landscape architect, Konradin von Abel. Frederick William fell in love with Therese von Abel, four years his senior. At that time there were clashes between Duke Frederick and the Estates of Württemberg (the Landstände) on domestic and foreign policy issues. Konradin von Abel represented the foreign policy interests of the estates and was supported by Frederick William, who moved against the interests of his father&#x27;s policies. In 1803 Frederick William fled Württemberg to Paris, Vienna, Schaffhausen and Saarburg. In Saarburg, Therese gave birth to twins, who died shortly after birth. Now Elector of Württemberg, Frederick wanted to bring his son back to Württemberg. Frederick William went in October to Paris, where he was received on 14 October by Napoleon. Elector Frederick prevented the planned marriage of his son with Therese von Abel through diplomatic interventions, though separating the two did not happen until the autumn of 1804. During his time in Paris, Frederick William received financial support from the Landstände and later from Napoleon.

===Heir to the throne===
On 11 September 1805 Frederick William left Paris and returned (after a visit to his grandparents, the Duke and Duchess of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel in Brunswick) to Stuttgart, where in November he met his father for the first time in a few years. His return was mainly due to the change in the political climate. The United Kingdom, which had been at war with Napoleon since 1803, formed an alliance with Russia and Austria. Napoleon had Württemberg&#x27;s neighbours of Baden and Bavaria on his side, so Württemberg was forced, after some hesitation, to yield to French pressure and also enter into an alliance with Napoleon. The French Foreign Minister Talleyrand suggested a coup against Elector Frederick, in which his son was to replace him, but Frederick William opposed the suggestion. This act is regarded as the main reason for William&#x27;s subsequent aversion to Napoleon. Frederick refused to involve his son in the affairs of state, but gave him his own court headed by his friend, Ernst von Pfuel-Riepurr, who had accompanied him in his time out of the country. Frederick William took the time to further his education, including acquiring a knowledge of agriculture.

From 1 January 1806, the territorial gains as a result of the German mediatization enlarged the Electorate of Württemberg and it became a kingdom upon the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1806, Prussia joined the coalition against Napoleon and was defeated and occupied within a few weeks. Napoleon wanted Württemberg to be bound to him closer by marriage. On 13 August 1807 Frederick William&#x27;s sister, Catherine, married Napoleon&#x27;s brother Jérôme, the king of the newly created Kingdom of Westphalia. In order to prevent Napoleon arranging a marriage for him, Frederick William sought permission from his father to marry Charlotte (later Caroline) Augusta, the daughter of the Bavarian King Maximilian I Joseph. After lengthy negotiations took place, the pair were married on 8 June 1808 in Munich. Since it was purely a marriage of convenience and Frederick William had no interest in a deeper relationship with his wife, Charlotte became increasingly lonely in Stuttgart. Frederick often stayed in Kassel at the court of his brother-in-law, Jérôme. Here he met Jérôme&#x27;s former lover, Blanche La Flèche, Baroness of Keudelstein. He began an affair with her, which he later continued as king.

In 1809, Napoléon had Württemberg commit troops for his war against Austria, while safeguarding its own eastern borders. Frederick William received the command of the troops deployed for border defence. During Napoleon&#x27;s Russian campaign, Frederick William was again in command of troops. The campaign was devastating for the Army of Württemberg. Of the 15,800 soldiers, only a few hundred returned to Württemberg. After the Battle of Leipzig from 16 to 19 October 1813, Württemberg moved to the side of the coalition against Napoleon. Frederick William then took over the command of the Army of Württemberg, which was reinforced by Austrian troops in November. On 30 December the army crossed the Rhine at Hüningen.

Despite having suffered heavy losses in 1812 and 1813 fighting as an ally of France, Württemberg agreed to raise an army for the Allies of 12,250 regular infantry, 2,900 cavalry and 12,250 militia. By strenuous efforts this quota was filled. At first, the Württemberger contingent was designated the German VI Corps, but in a subsequent reorganization it became the IV Corps in the main Allied army of Austrian Field Marshal Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. It marched to war with 14,000 men and 24 artillery pieces. Frederick William directed his corps in the First Battle of Bar-sur-Aube on 24 January 1814. One source asserted that IV Corps suffered 900 casualties in this combat while their Austrian allies lost 837. French losses were about 1,200. The IV Corps participated in the Allied victory over Napoleon at the Battle of La Rothière on 1 February.

On 18 February 1814, Schwarzenberg ordered Frederick William to hold Montereau until evening. Accordingly, the Crown Prince placed 8,500 foot soldiers, 1,000 horsemen and 26 artillery pieces on the north bank of the Seine River. The defending force included an Austrian brigade. The first French attacks in the morning were driven off, but by the mid-afternoon Napoleon was on the scene with 30,000 troops and 70 cannons. Frederick William ordered a retreat, but the movement quickly degenerated into a mad dash for safety across the single bridge with French cavalry in hot pursuit. The Allies lost 2,600 killed and wounded, plus 3,400 soldiers and 15 field pieces captured. The French lost 2,000 but captured the vital bridge intact. The Württembergers reported 806 killed and wounded, not counting prisoners. 

On 25 March, the main Allied army came upon a 19,000-man French corps by surprise in the Battle of Fère-Champenoise. Leading the advance, Frederick William decided not to wait for his infantry to catch up but to attack with his cavalry alone. The result was a crushing Allied victory as the French corps suffered losses of 2,000 killed and wounded while losing 4,000 prisoners, 45 cannons and 100 ammunition wagons. A nearby 4,300-strong French division with 16 cannons was also caught and completely wiped out. The Allies sustained 2,000 casualties out of 28,000 men and 80 guns engaged. At the Battle of Paris on 30 March, 6,500 Württembergers fought, losing 160 killed, wounded and captured.

With the fall of Napoleon, Frederick William took the opportunity to begin divorce proceedings from his wife. He had been in the United Kingdom in June 1814 with his cousin Grand Duchess Catherine of Russia, the widow of Duke George of Oldenburg, and the two were in love. After Charlotte, King Frederick and King Maximilian Joseph had agreed to the divorce, a divorce court was convened by King Frederick on 31 August 1814. Both parties had indicated that the marriage was not consummated because of animosity. Annulment by Pope Pius VII, which was necessary because Charlotte was Catholic, did not take place until over a year later on 12 January 1816, shortly before the wedding of Frederick William and Catherine. Charlotte then married on 10 November 1816, the Austrian Emperor Francis I.

Frederick William and Catherine also attended the Congress of Vienna from September 1814, where diplomats drew up a new Europe following Napoleon&#x27;s downfall. After the return of Napoleon and the subsequent war in 1815, Frederick William commanded the Austrian III Corps which in one of the minor campaigns invaded France and besieged General Jean Rapp in Strasbourg. He was the only member of the ruling German royal families who participated actively as a military commander in the wars of 1814 and 1815. Wilhelm Hauff celebrated this in his poem &quot;Prinz Wilhelm&quot;.

On 24 January 1816, Frederick William married Catherine in St. Petersburg. The newly-weds stayed in Russia for a few months and arrived in Stuttgart on 13 April 1816.

===Early reign===

====Accession====

King Frederick died on 30 October 1816, at 1:30 am. On the same day, Catherine, who already had two sons from her first marriage, gave birth to their daughter Marie Friederike Charlotte. Although in King Frederick&#x27;s declining years, he and his son no longer had any political and personal conflicts, Frederick William was eager to display a new era of political change and power. As such, he did away with his first name of Frederick and chose his second name of Wilhelm (William) as his regnal name. He reduced the monarchical titles to simply &quot;Wilhelm, by the Grace of God, King of Württemberg&quot;. The national coat of arms was also simplified and he reduced the colours of the state flag of black, red and gold, to simply black and red. He also announced an amnesty for civil and military prisoners. William dismissed most of the ministers of state, made the Privy Council his government and gave new senior positions at court and in the civil service.

====Measures against economic hardship====

William&#x27;s accession to the throne fell into a time of great economic hardship. In April 1815, Mount Tambora erupted in the Dutch East Indies, which led to a long-term deterioration of global weather conditions. In the spring and summer of 1816 there was nowhere in Europe without a storm, rain or hail. In October the first snow fell in Württemberg. The year 1816 became known as the Year Without A Summer. In Württemberg, there were crop failures which gave rise to food prices. In the winter of 1816/1817, famine broke out. To alleviate the plight, the government fixed maximum prices for food, made exporting difficult and later banned it. Large amounts of grain were brought from outside the country. The famine was alleviated by the King and Queen, whose policies were aimed at long-term improvement in the economic situation of all social classes. William implemented agricultural reforms, while Catherine devoted her care to the poor. On 20 November 1818 William set up an Agricultural Academy in Hohenheim to radically improve general nutrition in the kingdom through teaching, experimentation and demonstration and, in so doing, laid the foundation for the University of Hohenheim. To help people to help themselves, the government planted alleys of fruit-trees. (Dienstbarkeit on private ground near streets). The tree farms from William, also the Moravian Church delivered for free. 

In the same year he set up the Cannstatter Volksfest, which was to take place annually on 28 September, a day after the king&#x27;s birthday. William bought cattle and sheep from abroad for farmers to raise them in Württemberg and he was known for his Arabian stallions that formed part of the Marbach stud. Around the country, Catherine set up charities, which were controlled by a national charity in Stuttgart. Donations were received from the private property of the royal couple, by Catherine&#x27;s mother the Tsarina, and by other members of the royal family. The Württembergische Landessparkasse (Wurttemberg State Savings Bank) was established on 12 May 1818 on Catherine&#x27;s initiative. At the same time, a poor relief authority was set up in the Ministry of Interior. The completion of the Katharinenhospital in 1828 was initiated via a donation by Catherine in 1817. The Mohrenköpfle is a breed of pig. On the orders of King William I, these &quot;masked&quot; pigs were imported from Central China in 1820/21, in order to improve pig breeding in the Kingdom of Württemberg. Cross-breeding local breeds with these &quot;Chinese pigs&quot; was particularly successful within stocks of domestic pigs in the Hohenlohe region and the area around the town of Schwäbisch Hall.

====Death of Queen Catherine====

Catherine and William&#x27;s second daughter Sophie, who later became Queen of the Netherlands, was born on 17 June 1818. Despite the outwardly harmonious marriage of William and Catherine, William had extramarital affairs. He took to his former lover Blanche La Flèche again. Eduard von Kallee, born on 26 February 1818 is thought to have been his illegitimate son. When Catherine found her husband in Scharnhausen on 3 January 1819, with a lover (presumably Blanche La Fleche), she travelled back to Stuttgart. She died of complications from pneumonia on 9 January. William had the Württemberg Mausoleum constructed for her on Württemberg Hill and she was buried in 1824. To cover up the circumstances of her death he tried to obtain her letters, which he suspected contained information about his love affairs. The main political reason for this was so Württemberg&#x27;s relationship with Russia would not be strained. William wrote in a letter that he was considering abdication. He wanted his brother Paul to renounce his claim to the throne, in favour of Paul&#x27;s son, Frederick. After their mother&#x27;s death, Catherine&#x27;s sons by her first marriage went to live with their grandfather, Peter, the-then regent and later Grand Duke of Oldenburg.

===Period of consolidation===

====Family and private life====

Soon after the death of Queen Catherine, William sought a new marriage. He looked again to a cousin, Pauline (1800–1873) who was the daughter of his uncle Louis and 19 years his junior. The wedding took place on 19 April 1820 at Stuttgart. Pauline tended to be rather pious and was a prude. For example, when her daughter was to be painted naked as a baby, Pauline refused it. The beginning of the marriage was outwardly harmonious and the royal couple undertook official duties and many activities together. On 24 August 1821 their first daughter Catherine was born. The birth of the heir Charles on 6 March 1823 was received by the people and the royal family with great joy. Their third child Augusta was born on 4 October 1826.

William continued to maintain extramarital relationships with other women. When travelling to Italy, he continued to meet with Blanche La Flèche. In the late 1820s, the royal couple became increasingly alienated. William began a relationship with the actress Amalie of Stubenrauch. Born in 1803, she started her acting career in 1823 at the Munich Court Theatre. After a stint in March 1827, in the autumn of 1828 she became permanent at the Stuttgart Court Theatre, where William soon became aware of her. William and Amelia would keep up their relationship until William&#x27;s death in 1864.

====Politics====
In October 1820 a manuscript entitled &quot;Manuskript aus Süddeutschland&quot; (&quot;Manuscript from Southern Germany&quot;) was published in London. The book contained a review of the historical development and the political situation in Germany. It called for a further mediatisation of small countries in Germany to the four central states of Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover and Württemberg, which together should form a counterweight to the great powers of Prussia and Austria. It was suggested Württemberg should gain Baden, the principalities of Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, as well as Alsace. Soon it became known that the published name of the author and editor of the book were fake. The real author was Friedrich Ludwig Lindner (1772–1845), who was somewhat of a personal assistant to William. It was assumed that William was behind this idea and that Lindner acted as his ghostwriter. The manuscript caused diplomatic tensions between Prussia and Austria on one side and Württemberg on the other. At the Congress of Verona in 1822, the great powers of Austria, Prussia and Russia launched an isolation on Württemberg. In the spring of 1823, diplomatic relations were broken off, the foreign minister, Count Wintzingerode, and the Bundestag envoy, Freiherr von Wangenheim, resigned. The popularity of William rose in liberal circles. Reprisals, however, meant that William had to give in. In November 1824 Württemberg agreed to an extension of the anti-liberal Carlsbad Decrees.

After the successful French July Revolution of 1830, the Liberals were buoyant in most of Europe, as well as in Württemberg. The November Uprising in Congress Poland against Russia in 1830/1831 reinforced this trend. In December 1831, the Liberals won the elections to the second chamber of the Württemberg Landtag. At the Hambach Festival on 27 May 1832, in which Hambach Castle in the Rhineland-Palatinate was a backdrop for liberal and democratic rallies, the call for banned political gatherings was answered. William moved to convene the parliament elected in 1831 for over a year until 15 January 1833. After the dissolution of parliament on 22 March, elections were held in April, and Friedrich Römer&#x27;s liberals again emerged victorious.

Diplomatic relations between Württemberg and Prussia and Austria were also limited at this time. From 1836 William tried to better relations with Prussia. In September 1836 Prince William, later German Emperor, visited Stuttgart. 1838 saw a return visit by King William to Berlin, where he and cousin, the Tsar Nicholas I met. From this point, a Prussian envoy in Württemberg was established. At various times William was interested in forming a &quot;Third Germany&quot; of smaller states outside the control of Vienna and Berlin, but this never took form.
One area of co-operation with Prussia was the Zollverein customs union. William signed a Bavaria–Württemberg Customs Union (BWCU) in 1828, with mixed results. In 1828–34 the BWCU signed commercial agreements and then became full members of the German Customs Union. Seen now as a precursor of German unity under Prussia in 1871, at the time it was hoped that stronger local economies would preserve the independence of the smaller states such as Württemberg.

The 1830s were characterised by an economic boom in Württemberg. Agriculture, trade and crafts flourished and debt and taxes were down. Shipping on the Neckar via the Wilhelmskanal had become possible in 1821, and the road network was expanded. Plans were produced for the construction of the first railways. William was very interested in the emerging industrialisation and visited, in 1837, the United Kingdom, the birthplace of the Industrial Revolution. For his Silver Jubilee in 1841, the kingdom was in excellent financial shape. On 27 September 1841 William celebrated his 60th birthday. On 28 September, a procession took place in Stuttgart with 10,390 participants, including 640 riders and 23 horses and wagons with teams of oxen from the entire kingdom. 200,000 spectators had come to the capital, which had 40,000 inhabitants. On the Schlossplatz a solid wooden column was built, which was replaced two years later by the central stone &quot;Jubiläumssäule&quot; (Jubilee Pillar). The whole town was decorated, fireworks were set off in the evening and bonfires were made all around the country. William was celebrated by patriotic poems and songs in the newspapers. The celebrations and participation around the country expressed how the country had become unified and connected under William&#x27;s reign.

===Revolution of 1848/1849===
In 1846 and 1847, poor harvests in Württemberg gave rise to famine and increased emigration. The relatively satisfied mood of the population became sour. Liberal and democratic demands were expressed more forcefully. In January 1848 a protest in Stuttgart called for an all-German Federal Parliament, freedom of the press, freedom of association and assembly, introduction of jury trials and arming of the people. In February, a revolution broke out again in France. When Louis Philippe I abdicated and fled into exile to England, William recognised the urgency of the situation and tried the stop the revolution through concessions to the liberals and democrats. On 1 March he reinstated the liberal press law of 1817, which had been overturned previously by the Carlsbad Decrees in 1819. He tried to replace the Privy Council under the conservative Joseph von Linden, but this failed on 6 March as a result of further protests. William then agreed to forming a liberal government under Friedrich Römer. On 18 March 1848 the Württemberg army was sworn not to the king but to the Constitution. Although Römer never had the confidence of William, he made sure that during the revolution in Württemberg, a majority for the abolition of the monarchy was never formed. In April, the Württemberg army was involved in the crackdown on the Baden Revolution of Friedrich Hecker and Gustav von Struve in Baden. In June 1848, a new parliament was selected in which Römer&#x27;s liberals again received the majority in the upper chamber. William visited Frankfurt in July 1848, where since 18 May that year the Frankfurt Parliament met and on 29 June 1848 and had chosen Archduke John of Austria to be regent. The parliament proposed, on 8 March 1849, that Frederick William of Prussia should be elected Emperor of Germany. Römer advised William to accept this choice, but if Frederick William refused, Römer advised William he had a good chance of being elected emperor himself. This flattery increased, however, only the mistrust of William against Römer.

On 20 April 1849 the Chamber of Deputies voted in the Landtag with only two dissenting votes in favour of recognising the constitution drafted by the Frankfurt Parliament on 28 March 1849. William refused to do so and justified his refusal in a supplement to the &quot;Schwäbischer Merkur&quot; (&quot;Swabian Mercury&quot;) with a circulation of 12,000 copies. Given the tricky situation of Stuttgart, he moved his court to the garrison city of Ludwigsburg. On 25 April, William decided to accept the constitution. But he felt it was imposed humiliation, which was multiplied when he realized that he was the only ruler of a larger German state who had accepted the Constitution.

After the Frankfurt Parliament had failed with the rejection of the German imperial crown by Frederick William IV of Prussia, on 30 May 1849 the remaining members decided to relocate the parliament to Stuttgart. Derisively known as the &quot;Rumpfparlament&quot; (&quot;rump parliament&quot;), on 6 June 1849, the remaining 154 deputies met initially under President Wilhelm Loewe in Stuttgart. Following its view of itself as the legitimate German parliament, the rump parliament called for tax resistance and military resistance against those states that did not accept the Paulskirche Constitution. Since this view also diminished the autonomy of Württemberg, and the Prussian army was successfully crushing the rebellions in the nearby Baden and the Palatinate, the Württemberg government rapidly distanced itself from the rump parliament.

On 17 June the president of the parliament was informed that the Württemberg government was no longer in a position to tolerate the meetings that had moved to its territory, nor the activities of the regency elected on the 6th, anywhere in Stuttgart or Württemberg. At this point, the rump parliament had only 99 deputies and did not reach a quorum according to its own rules. On 18 June the Württemberg army occupied the parliamentary chamber before the session started. The deputies reacted by organising an impromptu protest march which was promptly squashed by the soldiers without bloodshed. Those deputies that were not from Württemberg were expelled.

On 2 July William returned to Stuttgart. In August 1849 elections were held for a Constituent Assembly in which the democrats reached the majority against the moderate liberals. While the liberals called for the right to an income level and assets, the democrats demanded universal, equal and direct suffrage for all adult men. At the end of October 1849 the king dismissed the government under Friedrich Römer. On 7 December 1849 the principalities of Hohenzollern-Hechingen and Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen were incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. William&#x27;s objective of mediatising these states into Württemberg therefore failed. The-then shattered relationship with Prussia was not normalised until 1852 with the resumption of diplomatic relations.

From 1850 William led a reactionary policy. His experience in the revolution led him to reject generally representative governments. He wanted the people to be &quot;free from the periodic fever of elections&quot;. On 2 July 1850 he set up a new government with the conservative Joseph von Linden as Minister of the Interior. He was a more compliant rubber stamp for William&#x27;s restoration policy. The old constitution was re-enacted, the army was sworn in again on the king rather than the Constitution, corporal punishment was reintroduced in 1852 and the death penalty in 1853. Linden&#x27;s conservative cabinet remained until shortly after William&#x27;s death in office.

===Later years and death===

In the 1850s, the polarity between Prussia and Austria came to a head in Germany. William pursued a foreign policy strategy shifting alliances and agreements with the major European powers. In the Crimean War between Russia on one hand and the Ottoman Empire, France and Great Britain on the other, he pushed for a neutrality of the German Confederation. This strengthened the position of the Württemberg ally of Russia. After the Crimean War, William tried to normalise his country&#x27;s relations with France. The French emperor since 1852, Napoléon III, was the nephew of his brother-in-law, Jérôme Bonaparte.

The Holy Alliance between Russia, Austria and Prussia had ended on the outbreak of the Crimean War. On 27 September 1857 a meeting organised by William was held in Stuttgart between Napoléon III and Tsar Alexander II. The emperors agreed that Russia would not intervene in any war that France would have in assisting Sardinia in a war against Austria (later to become the Second Italian War of Independence). Especially in his old age, European princes often sought his advice. His biographer Paul Sauer therefore referred to him as &quot;Nestor among the princes of Europe&quot;.
William&#x27;s marriage looked happy to outsiders, but in actuality was completely shattered. He was constantly accompanied by his mistress, Amalie, on private visits. He did not trust his son, Prince Charles, to takeover governmental functions; Charles&#x27;s homosexual inclinations troubled him. He was very fond of his daughter-in-law and niece, Crown Princess Olga. She often had to mediate between her husband and her father-in-law, which over long periods led to a tense relationship between her and William. His daughters from his marriage to Catherine both had marital disputes with their husbands, Alfred von Neipperg and William III of the Netherlands.

King William became increasingly hard of hearing with age and underwent frequent treatment from the 1850s. In the autumn of 1863, his condition deteriorated. He had little contact with his family, whereas his mistress Amalie was constantly with him. He was often visited by the writer Friedrich Wilhelm Hackländer. Before his death, he had his private letters and records destroyed.

William died at 5:10 on the morning of 25 June 1864 at Rosenstein Palace in the presence of his personal physician, Dr. Karl Alsatian, and a valet. On the morning of 30 June, in the presence of his son and successor, King Charles and his stepson Peter of Oldenburg, he was buried alongside his second wife Catherine in the Württemberg Mausoleum. A few hours later, a memorial service was held there in which his widow Queen Pauline, his daughter-in-law Queen Olga, his daughters Queen Sophie of the Netherlands, Princess Catherine and Princess Augusta of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, his nephew Grand Duke Constantine of Russia and his stepson Peter of Oldenburg, were present.

While William did not mention his wife Pauline in his will, he made sure that his former mistresses Therese of Abel and Blanche La Flèche received pensions. Queen Pauline and King Charles insisted Amalie of Stubenrauch left court and she moved to an estate in Tegernsee, located next to the Villa Arco, which they had acquired in 1862. She died there on 14 April 1876 and was buried in Tegernsee.

** King Charles I of Württemberg (born 1823–1891), who succeeded his father as king of Württemberg. A homosexual, he married Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia, the daughter of Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, and leaving no issue was succeeded by his nephew King William II of Württemberg (born 1848–1921);
** Princess Augusta of Württemberg (1826–1898) who married Prince Hermann of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach (1825–1901). One of her daughters, Pauline of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, married Charles Augustus, Hereditary Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach.

===1st Cannstatter Volksfest 1818–2018===

On 28 September 1818, one day after the king&#x27;s 36th birthday, a big agricultural festival with horse races and prize-giving for outstanding cattle-breeding achievements was celebrated on the so-called Cannstatter Wasen site. Named the &quot;Landwirtschaftliche Fest zu Kannstadt&quot; (Kannstadt Agricultural Festival), it was therefore the 1st Cannstatter Volksfest.
200 years later Cannstatter Volksfest and the 100th Landwirtschaftliches Hauptfest are celebrated with a historical Volksfest on Stuttgart&#x27;s Schlossplatz square. Cannstatter Volksfest and the 100th Landwirtschaftliches Hauptfest (an agricultural show)—the founding of the biggest festival in &quot;Ländle&quot;, as the state of Baden-Württemberg is affectionately known, by King William I and his wife Katharina will be remembered in the heart of Stuttgart on the Schlossplatz square from 26 September to 3 October 2018.
 At the Historical Volksfest 2018 with King William I and his wife Katharina (actors) will be dressed in historical costumes dating back to 1818.
===Sequoiadendron giganteum===
In order to cultivate them for their wood, the King had some 5,000 Giant Sequoia (&quot;Sequoiadendron giganteum&quot;) grown from seed in 1865. He had the seeds sent from California. Today, after years, the remaining examples have reached a height of over . Their older Californian relatives, with a height of and a trunk circumference of more than , are the largest living organisms on our planet. Of the original 5,000 trees, 123 of the Giant Sequoia remain as memorials of King William.

<text>Apal is a small-scale automobile company originally from Belgium.

==Phase 1 -APAL - s.à.r.l. Application Polyester Armé de Liège (1961–1998)==

Glass-fibre specialist &quot;Edmond Pery&quot; founded this small automobile manufacturing company in Blegny-Trembleur, Liège Province, Belgium in 1961. Pery presented his first model, a GT coupé with gull-wing doors, propelled by Volkswagen or Porsche engines at the Brussels &quot;Autosalon&quot; (or &quot;Salon auto de Bruxelles&quot;) in 1962.

In 1965, Apal started producing a Formule V single-seater. The Apal Horizon GT was a mid-engined sports car and was made in a limited number in 1968 and 1969.

Between 1968 and 1981, about 5,000 glass-fibre bodies were produced for different buggy models such as Apal Buggy, Apal Rancho, Apal Jet, Apal Auki, and the Apal Corsa (a sporty version with gull-wing doors). The Jet was a copy of a buggy originally developed by Glassco Inc. of USA. This set of molds then made its way to England, where PABC/Eresbug built it in London, with the Four Seasons Buggy Company manufacturing it from 1971 on and finally GP Projects from 1975 until 1976. Apal traded the Auki buggy molds for the Jet molds and modified them, adding a T-bar and side skirts and replacing the curved Ford Anglia windshield (not as easy to acquire in continental Europe) with a flat unit.

The Apal 1200 Saloon was an attractive car based on Volkswagen beetle floorplan. It had a thrust-forward nose with a divided front bumper and a well-sloped curved one-piece windshield. The rear-mounted engine was air-cooled, with cooling air exhausting through a grille in the rounded tail, which also sported a divided rear bumper.


The company&#x27;s most successful model was called the Apal Speedster and is a replica of the Porsche 356 Speedster, built on a VW Beetle floorplan. Altogether 700 were completed between 1981 and 1994.

In 1984 Apal also developed a two-seater sports coupé using Mercedes-Benz W201 underpinnings, called the Francorchamps after the Belgian racetrack. This was developed together with an American company with the aim of selling the car in the United States, but with the dollar rapidly losing value the project became untenable and only two copies were built. The company&#x27;s last model, named the Apal Sport One, based on the Pontiac Fiero, appeared in 1992.

Edmond Pery also designed an all-road prototype for DAF in 1974 and another prototype for Volkswagen in 1992. The small firm produced and sold all models in limited numbers.

==Phase 2 - Apal Gmbh, Germany (1998- to date)==
The original Belgian company closed in 1998. A German company, under the name Apal Gmbh and based in Ostercappeln (Lower Saxony), bought all the spare parts and restarted production of the Apal Speedster.

As of 2006 the company has stopped production of ready-built cars and only sold kits and spare parts.

As of 2017, the Apal Automobiles brand is the exclusive propriety of Belgian businessman Charles-Antoine Masquelin.

<text>Yang Kaihui (; courtesy name: Yunjin ; 6 November 1901 – 14 November 1930) was the second wife of Mao Zedong, whom he married in 1920. She had three children with Mao Zedong: Mao Anying, Mao Anqing and Mao Anlong. Her father was Yang Changji, the head of the Hunan First Normal School and one of Mao&#x27;s favorite teachers. She was a distant cousin to Yang Youlin, another instrumental member of the Chinese Communist Party.

==Early life==
Yang Kaihui was born in the small village of Bancang in Changsha, Hunan Province, on 6 November 1901. Her name meant &quot;Opening Wisdom&quot;, although she came to be nicknamed &quot;Xia&quot;, meaning &quot;Little Dawn.&quot; Her father was Yang Changji, a teacher and leftist intellectual, her mother was Xiang Zhenxi, while she had a brother three years older than her, Yang Kaizhi. Through his teaching of ethics at the First Normal School of Changsha, Changji had become a father figure to a pupil named Mao Zedong, later writing in his journal that &quot;it is truly difficult to imagine someone so intelligent and handsome&quot; as him. A friendship developing, in summer 1916, Mao was invited to spend several days at Yang&#x27;s Bancang home, walking twenty miles in straw sandals in order to get there. On this occasion, he did not talk to either Zhenxi or Kaizhi, instead bowing his head to them as a mark of respect.

Yang Changji gained a professorship at Peking University and had moved his family to the city when Mao came to Peking in September 1918 with several like-minded friends from Hunan. Upon arrival, they stayed in the Yangs&#x27; small house in the north of the city. Here, Mao met Kaihui again, and the two discovered a mutual attraction. A friend who knew Kaihui at the time described her as &quot;small in stature and round-faced, with deep-set eyes and pale white skin&quot;, and her appearance impressed both Mao and his friends. Kaihui later related that she had &quot;fallen madly in love with him already when I heard about his numerous accomplishments&quot; but did not make her feelings immediately known. She kept &quot;hoping and dreaming&quot; that he shared her feelings and decided that she would never marry anyone but him.

Their relationship did not develop swiftly, as Mao was shy and lacked sufficient funds to court her, living in cramped rented accommodation with other Hunanese students in Peking&#x27;s Three-Eyed Well district. Changji secured Mao a job at the university library as assistant to the librarian Li Dazhao, an early Chinese communist.

In January 1920, Yang Changji died. Mao was in Peking ostensibly on business, though biographer Stuart Schram suspected his presence was partly due to his desire to comfort Kaihui. Yang Kaihui and her mother returned to Changsha with her father&#x27;s remains, and she soon entered the Fusiang Girls’ School. At the missionary school, her exposure to revolutionary ideas got her labeled a &#x27;rebel&#x27;, who refused to pray and cut her hair short in defiance of convention.

Mao had gone from Peking to Shanghai, where he worked in a laundry and joined a Communist group for the first time. Following the overthrow of Hunanese warlord Zhang Jingyao by generals favourable to Mao, he returned to Changsha in July 1920. Mao opened a bookstore and publishing house. Now possessing social status and financial security, Mao was able to marry Kaihui.

==Revolutionary experience==
Yang joined the Chinese Socialism Youth League (CYLC) in the second half of 1920 as one of the first members in Hunan. She married Mao Zedong that winter, without any wedding ceremony or other celebrations. Yang joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in the beginning of 1922. 

By the 1920s, the Communist movement in China used a labor and peasant organizing strategy that combined workplace advocacy with women&#x27;s rights advocacy. The Communists would lead union organizing efforts among male workers while simultaneously working in nearby peasant communities on women&#x27;s rights issues, including literacy for women. Yang and Mao were among the most effective Communist political organizers using this method, using it in the Anyuan mines and nearby peasant communities.

In April 1923, Mao went to the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party in Shanghai to work as the Organization Department Minister. In the following year, Yang, together with her two children, Mao Anying and Mao Anqing, joined her husband in Shanghai and organized an evening school at a cotton mill. In 1925, accompanied by Mao, Yang Kaihui went to Shaoshan to organize peasant movements, while caring for her husband and educating their children. At the same time, she continued to teach peasant evening schools and contracted with other comrades. In the beginning of 1927, Mao inspected the peasant movement in Hunan. Yang Kaihui sorted through the large amount of investigation materials and neatly copied them down. Mao&#x27;s &quot;Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan&quot; including Yang&#x27;s contributions, was published in March of that year. During this period Yang organized many movements among peasants, labor, women, and students.

After the National Revolution failed, Yang returned alone to Bancang to organize underground revolutions and lead fights against the Kuomintang (KMT) in Changsha, Pingjiang, and the borders of Xiangyin. Amid the great difficulties and dangers, Yang wrote many letters to her cousin Yang Kaiming, asking him to take good care of her children and mother if she met a sudden death. Because of the great distance and spare communication with Mao over the next three years, Yang often only saw news about her husband in the KMT&#x27;s newspapers and worried greatly about his safety.

In early 1928, Mao began a relationship with He Zizhen without ending his marriage with Yang Kaihui.

== Death ==
In October 1930, the local KMT warlord He Jian captured Yang Kaihui and her son Mao Anying. Her captors wanted her to publicly renounce Mao Zedong and the CCP, but she refused to do so. Even under torture, she is reputed to have told her captors, &quot;You could kill me as you like, you would never get anything from my mouth... Chopping off the head is like the passing of wind, death could frighten cowards, rather than our Communists... Even if the seas run dry and the rocks crumble, I would never break off relations with Mao Zedong ... I prefer to die for the success of Mao&#x27;s revolutionary career.&quot;

Yang was executed in Changsha on 14 November 1930 at the age of 29. Her children with Mao Zedong were effectively orphaned, and were rediscovered years later. Mao Anying later died early in the Korean War, and Mao Anqing became a translator for the CCP Central Committee.

===Influence of Yang Kaihui&#x27;s death on Mao===
Although he would have relationships with other women, Mao mourned Kaihui for the rest of his life.
In summer 1937, he conversed with the American reporter Agnes Smedley, reciting to her a poem that he had written in memory of Kaihui.

In spring 1957, Li Shuyi, a friend and comrade of Mao and Yang&#x27;s, wrote a poem in memory of her own husband, Liu Chih-hsün, a member of the Red Army who had been killed in 1933. Sending her poem to Mao, he responded by composing his own poem commemorating both Liu and Kaihui, titled &quot;The Immortals&quot;, which he would subsequently publish:

The allusion to poplar trees is a reference to Yang, whose surname meant &quot;poplar&quot;, while that to willows alludes to Liu&#x27;s surname, which meant &quot;willow&quot;.

==Poetry==
Yang wrote poems to express her loneliness and her longing for Mao. One of them, &quot;偶感 [Ǒu Gǎn]&quot; (&quot;Occasional Feeling&quot;), was written in October 1928, two years before her death, and discovered when her former residence was being repaired about 50 years later:

<doc id="855138" wikidata="Q3198879" url="?curid=855138" title="Line element">
<text>In geometry, the line element or length element can be informally thought of as a line segment associated with an infinitesimal displacement vector in a metric space. The length of the line element, which may be thought of as a differential arc length, is a function of the metric tensor and is denoted by &quot;formula_1&quot;.

Line elements are used in physics, especially in theories of gravitation (most notably general relativity) where spacetime is modelled as a curved Pseudo-Riemannian manifold with an appropriate metric tensor.

==General formulation==

===Definition of the line element and arc length===

The coordinate-independent definition of the square of the line element &quot;ds&quot; in an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Riemannian or Pseudo Riemannian manifold (in physics usually a Lorentzian manifold) is the &quot;square of the length&quot; of an infinitesimal displacement formula_2 (in pseudo Riemannian manifolds possibly negative) whose square root should be used for computing curve length: 
formula_3 
where &quot;g&quot; is the metric tensor, · denotes inner product, and &quot;d&quot;q an infinitesimal displacement on the (pseudo) Riemannian manifold. By parametrizing a curve formula_4, we can define the arc length of the curve length of the curve between formula_5, and formula_6 as the integral:
formula_7

To compute a sensible length of curves in pseudo Riemannian manifolds, it is best to assume that the infinitesimal displacements have the same sign everywhere. E.g. in physics the square of a line element along a timeline curve would (in the formula_8 signature convention) be negative and the negative square root of the square of the line element along the curve would measure the proper time passing for an observer moving along the curve.
From this point of view, the metric also defines in addition to line element the surface and volume elements etc.

===Identification of the square of the line element with the metric tensor===
Since formula_2 is an arbitrary &quot;square of the arc length&quot;, formula_10 completely defines the metric, and it is therefore usually best to consider the expression for formula_10 as a definition of the metric tensor itself, written in a suggestive but non tensorial notation:
formula_12 
This identification of the square of arc length formula_10 with the metric is even more easy to see in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional general curvilinear coordinates , where it is written as a symmetric rank 2 tensor coinciding with the metric tensor:
formula_14

Here the indices &quot;i&quot; and &quot;j&quot; take values 1, 2, 3, ..., &quot;n&quot; and Einstein summation convention is used. Common examples of (pseudo) Riemannian spaces include three-dimensional space (no inclusion of time coordinates), and indeed four-dimensional spacetime.

==Line elements in Euclidean space==


Following are examples of how the line elements are found from the metric.

===Cartesian coordinates===

The simplest line element is in Cartesian coordinates - in which case the metric is just the Kronecker delta:
formula_15
(here &quot;i, j&quot; = 1, 2, 3 for space) or in matrix form (&quot;i&quot; denotes row, &quot;j&quot; denotes column):
formula_16

The general curvilinear coordinates reduce to Cartesian coordinates:
formula_17
so
formula_18

===Orthogonal curvilinear coordinates===

For all orthogonal coordinates the metric is given by:
formula_19
where
formula_20

for &quot;i&quot; = 1, 2, 3 are scale factors, so the square of the line element is:
formula_21

Some examples of line elements in these coordinates are below.

==General curvilinear coordinates==

Given an arbitrary basis formula_22 of a space of dimension formula_23, the metric is defined as the inner product of the basis vectors.
formula_24

Where formula_25 and the inner product is with respect to the ambient space (usually its formula_26)

In a coordinate basis formula_27

The coordinate basis is a special type of basis that is regularly used in differential geometry.

==Line elements in 4d spacetime==

===Minkowski spacetime===

The Minkowski metric is:
formula_28
where one sign or the other is chosen, both conventions are used. This applies only for flat spacetime. The coordinates are given by the 4-position:
formula_29

so the line element is:
formula_30

===Schwarzschild coordinates===

In Schwarzschild coordinates coordinates are formula_31, being the general metric of the form:
formula_32

(note the similitudes with the metric in 3D spherical polar coordinates).

so the line element is:
formula_33

===General spacetime===

The coordinate-independent definition of the square of the line element d&quot;s&quot; in spacetime is:
formula_34 

In terms of coordinates:
formula_35
where for this case the indices and run over 0, 1, 2, 3 for spacetime.

This is the spacetime interval - the measure of separation between two arbitrarily close events in spacetime. In special relativity it is invariant under Lorentz transformations. In general relativity it is invariant under arbitrary invertible differentiable coordinate transformations.

<text>&quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; is an American folk song that first gained popularity in the 19th century. Early versions of the song were titled &quot;Zip Coon&quot;, which were first published around 1834 and performed in minstrel shows, with different people claiming authorship of the song. The melody of &quot;Zip Coon&quot; later became known as &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot;; a song titled &quot;Turkey in de Straw&quot; with different music and lyrics was published in 1861 together with the wordless music of &quot;Zip Coon&quot; added at the end, and the title &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; then became linked to the tune of &quot;Zip Coon&quot;.

The song is related to a number of tunes of the 19th century and the origin of these songs has been widely debated. Links to older Irish/Scottish/English ballads have been proposed, such as &quot;The Old Rose Tree&quot;. The song became highly popular and many variations of the song exist. It was also frequently adapted and used in popular media.

==Origin==
&quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; is thought to be originally a tune from 19th century minstrel shows, &quot;Zip Coon&quot; or &quot;Old Zip Coon&quot;, published around 1834. The authorship of the song has been claimed by George Washington Dixon who popularized the song, as well as Bob Farrell and George Nicholls. &quot;Zip Coon&quot; in turn has been linked to a number of 19th century folk songs believed to have older antecedents in Irish/Scottish/English folk songs. Songs proposed it has links to include &quot;Natchez Under the Hill&quot;, &quot;The Old Bog Hole&quot;, &quot;The Rose Tree&quot;, &quot;Sugar in the Gourd&quot;, &quot;The Black Eagle&quot;, &quot;Glasgow Hornpipe&quot;, &quot;Haymaker&#x27;s Dance&quot;, &quot;The Post Office&quot;, &quot;Old Mother Oxford&quot;, &quot;Kinnegad Slasher&quot; and others.

Eloise Hubbard Linscott believes the first part of the song is a contrafactum of the ballad &quot;My Grandmother Lived on Yonder Little Green&quot;, published in 1857 by Horace Waters, which is in turn said to be a contrafactum of the Irish/Scottish/English ballad &quot;The Old Rose Tree&quot; published by at least 1795 in Great Britain. The link to &quot;The Old Rose Tree&quot; has been questioned, but a number of musicologists suggest that it may be a composite of &quot;The Rose Tree&quot; and &quot;The (Bonny) Black Eagle&quot;. Similar tune was popular with fiddle players as early as 1820, and the tune of &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot;/&quot;Zip Coon&quot; may have come from the fiddle tune &quot;Natchez Under the Hill&quot; believed to have been derived from &quot;Rose Tree&quot;.

The title &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; later became associated with the tune of &quot;Zip Coon&quot; in an unusual way. According to James J. Fuld, Dan Bryant copyrighted a song with new lyrics and music titled &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; on July 12, 1861, but with the wordless music of &quot;Zip Coon&quot; (titled &quot;Old Melody&quot;) attached at the end. The tune of &quot;Zip Coon&quot; then became known as &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot;.

There are versions from the American Civil War, versions about fishing and one with nonsense verses. Folklorists have documented folk versions with obscene lyrics from the 19th century.

In 1942, a soundie titled, &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; was created by Freddie Fisher and The Schnickelfritz Band (directed by Sam Coslow and produced by Josef Berne). There are two versions to the chorus that are sung. The first goes:

== &quot;Zip Coon&quot; ==

The title of &quot;Zip Coon&quot; or &quot;Old Zip Coon&quot; was used to signify a dandified free black man in northern United States. &quot;Zip&quot; was a diminutive of &quot;Scipio&quot;, a name commonly used for slaves. According to Stuart Flexner, &quot;coon&quot; was short for &quot;raccoon&quot; and by 1832 meant a frontier rustic and by 1840 also a Whig who had adopted coonskin cap as a symbol of white rural people. Although the song &quot;Zip Coon&quot; was published 1830, at that time, &quot;coon&quot; was typically used to refer to someone white, it was only in 1848 when a clear use of the word &quot;coon&quot; to refer to a black person in a derogative sense appeared. It is possible that the negative racial connotation of the word evolved from &quot;Zip Coon&quot; and the common use of the word &quot;coon&quot; in minstrel shows. Another suggested derivation of the word meaning a black person is &quot;barracoon&quot;, an enclosure for slaves in transit that was increasingly used in the years before American Civil War. However, on the stage, &quot;coon&quot; could have been used much earlier as a black character was named Raccoon in a 1767 colonial comic opera.

The song was first performed by Bob Farrell, and popularized by George Washington Dixon in the 1830s. This version was first published between 1829 and 1834 in either New York or Baltimore. Dixon, and Bob Farrell and George Nicholls had separately claimed to have written the song, and the dispute has not been not resolved. Ohio songwriter Daniel Decatur Emmett is sometimes erroneously credited as the song&#x27;s author.

The song gave rise to the blackface minstrel show character Zip Coon.

===Music and lyrics===
&quot;Zip Coon&quot; has a vocal range of an octave and a minor sixth. Both the verse and the chorus end on the tonic, and both begin a major third above the tonic. In the verse, the highest note is a fifth above the tonic and the lowest is a minor sixth below. In the chorus, the highest note is an octave above the last note, and the lowest is the last note itself. The song stays in key throughout.

&quot;Zip Coon&quot; has many different lyrical versions. Thomas Birch published a version in 1834, while George Washington Dixon published a version called &quot;Ole Zip Coon&quot; with different lyrics circa 1835. Both Birch&#x27;s and Dixon&#x27;s versions keep the same chorus and the first four stanzas:

: Chorus


: Chorus
: Chorus
In subsequent stanzas, both lyricists talk about events in the life of Andrew Jackson, Birch of President Jackson&#x27;s battle with the Second Bank of the United States and Dixon of General Jackson at the Battle of New Orleans. When the Mexican–American War began, Dixon published a new version of &quot;Zip Coon&quot; with updated lyrics pertaining to the war:

The chorus &quot;Zip a duden duden duden zip a duden day&quot; likely influenced the song &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; in Walt Disney&#x27;s 1946 adaptation of Joel Chandler Harris&#x27; Uncle Remus tales, &quot;Song of the South&quot;.

Another version of &quot;Old Zip Coon&quot; with new self-referencing lyrics by David K. Stevens (1860–1946) was published in the &quot;Boy Scout Song Book&quot; (1920). Stevens&#x27; lyrics contain no direct racial references other than the title of the song itself:
== &quot;Nigger Love a Watermelon, Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot;==

&quot;Nigger Love a Watermelon, Ha! Ha! Ha!&quot; is a 1916 adaptation of &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot;, performed by Harry C. Browne and produced by Columbia Records. It has since been named the most racist song title in the United States for its use of watermelon stereotypes.

The song was released in March 1916. It was performed by the silent movie actor Harry C. Browne. It was released with &quot;Old Dan Tucker&quot; as a B-side. The music for it was based upon &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; and performed with Browne singing baritone whilst playing a banjo with orchestral accompaniment. A contemporary review in July 1916 called it: &quot;... a treat to tickle the musical palates of those who love to listen to the old-time slave-day river songs&quot;. Columbia Records continued to promote it up to 1925. The song used racist stereotypes in it with Browne describing watermelons as &quot;colored man&#x27;s ice-cream&quot;.

Radio DJ Dr. Demento, who had played older songs with racial overtones on the radio, refused to ever play this song because he felt that the title showed it was always intended to be hateful. In 2014, Dr. Theodore R. Johnson asserted that the jingle used by many ice cream trucks in the United States was based upon this song. It has been argued that this allegation is incorrect, as the &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; tune had been used long before this song was created. Nevertheless, because of the association, a number of American ice cream truck companies ceased to use the &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot; melody for their jingles.

==Performance history==
* In 1928, this was used as the base melody in the famous early Mickey Mouse cartoon &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;. The rendering of the tune in the cartoon is noted for being one of the first instances of successful synchronization in animated films. The tune became prominent in Disney&#x27;s animated series and was used in many subsequent cartoons in the 1920s and 1930s, including the first Mickey Mouse cartoon in color, &quot;The Band Concert&quot;, in which Donald Duck annoys an orchestra by repeatedly playing the tune over their efforts at &quot;The William Tell Overture&quot;.

<text>Baracoa, whose full original name is: Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Baracoa (&quot;Our Lady of the Assumption of Baracoa&quot;), is a municipality and city in Guantánamo Province near the eastern tip of Cuba. It was visited by Admiral Christopher Columbus on November 27, 1492, and then founded by the first governor of Cuba, the Spanish conquistador Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar on August 15, 1511. It is the oldest Spanish settlement in Cuba and was its first capital (the basis for its nickname Ciudad Primada, &quot;First City&quot;).

==Geography==
Baracoa is located on the spot where Christopher Columbus landed in Cuba on his first voyage. It is thought that the name stems from the indigenous Taíno language word meaning &quot;the presence of the sea&quot;.

Baracoa lies on the Bay of Honey (&quot;Bahía de Miel&quot;) and is surrounded by a wide mountain range (including the Sierra del Purial), which causes it to be quite isolated, apart from a single mountain road built in the 1960s.The Baracoa mountain range is covered with Cuban moist forests and Cuban pine forests.

The municipality includes the villages of Barigua, Boca de Yumurí, Cabacú, Cayogüín, Jamal, Jaragua, Los Hoyos, Mabujabo, Mosquitero, Nibujón, Paso Cuba, Sabanilla, Santa María, Vega de Taco, and other minor localities.

Baracoa has a tropical rainforest climate (&quot;Af&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification with high temperatures and rainfall throughout the year. Although there are no true wet or dry seasons, there is a noticeably wetter stretch from October to December.

==History==
The original inhabitants of the island were Taíno. They were almost eradicated by European diseases throughout the island. A local hero is Hatuey, who fled from the Spanish in Hispaniola and raised a Taíno army to fight the Spanish in Cuba. According to the story Hatuey was betrayed by a member of his group and sentenced to burn at the stake. It is said that just before he died a Catholic priest tried to convert him so he would attain salvation; Hatuey asked the priest if Heaven was the place where the dead Spanish go. When he received an answer in the affirmative he told the priest that he would rather go to Hell.

Christopher Columbus landed in Cuba in a place he named Porto Santo. It is generally assumed from his description that this was Baracoa, although there are also claims it was Gibara. But Columbus also described a nearby table mountain, which is almost certainly nearby El Yunque. He wrote in his logbook &quot;the most beautiful place in the world ...I heard the birds sing that they will never ever leave this place...&quot;. According to tradition, Columbus put a cross called Cruz de la Parra in the sands of what would later become Baracoa harbor.

Around 15 August 1511 (the official foundation day) Diego Velázquez de Cuéllar was appointed the first governor of Cuba and built a villa here and named the place &#x27;Nuestra Señora de la Asunción de Baracoa&#x27;, thus making Baracoa the first capital of Cuba. In 1518 it received the title of city and the first Cuban bishop was appointed here. As a result, several remains of the Spanish occupation can still be seen here, such as the fortifications El Castillo, Matachín and La Punta and the cemetery.

During the 17th and 18th centuries, its isolated location made Baracoa a haven for illegal trade with French and British merchants. During the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear, Luis de Unzaga, an officer in the newly organized Fixed Regiment of Havana, was appointed as chief commander of Baracoa in 1744 and managed thanks to a network of confidants, Irish merchants and French military personnel to be warned of possible British attacks. This allowed Baracoa a certain peace and commercial prosperity between Saint-Domingue and Cuba despite the time of conflict. At the beginning of the 19th century many Saint Dominicans fled here from the Haitian Revolution, who started growing coffee and cocoa.

From the middle of the 19th century many expeditions of independence fighters landed here (including Antonio Maceo and José Martí) which greatly helped the independence from Spain in 1902. 

Before the Cuban Revolution the only access was by sea, but in the 1960s a road from Guantánamo named La Farola was built through the mountains, which was one of the showcases of the revolution. The road had already been planned by the Batista government, but never got built. The highest point of the road is at over 600 m and it passes over 11 bridges.

==Economy==
The main products in the region are banana, coconut and cacao. It is Cuba&#x27;s main chocolate manufacturing area.&quot;Theobroma cacao&quot; trees are cultivated under groves of Royal palm on the banks of the Río Miel, Río Duaba, Río Toa and Río Yumuri.
Ecotourism and birdwatching are important in Baracoa due to the Cuban moist forests.

===Tourism===


The remote location at the eastern end of the Cuban island has kept the influence of mass tourism quite low, despite the idyllic location. Baracoa can be reached by bus from Santiago de Cuba (four hours) or by plane from Havana (two hours).

To the east the Fuerte Matachín (built in 1802) is still standing and contains houses and museums. To the west the Fuerte La Punta (built in 1803) houses a restaurant; there is a small beach next to the fort. The third fort, El Castillo, which sits on a steep hill with a commanding view of the town and both bays, is now Hotel El Castillo. The other hotels in Baracoa are Hotel Porto Santo, Hotel La Rusa, Hostal La Habanera and Villa Maguana. There are also a few casas particulares. The Catedral Nuestra Señora de la Asunción houses the earrings of the Cruz de la Parra, a cross that Cali is supposed to have brought from Spain. Although it has been carbon dated to approximately that period, it is made from a local type of wood, which means at least part of the story is not correct.

There are two music venues near the central Parque Independencia, the touristy Flan de Queso and the more traditional Casa de la Flana.

Nearby are the rivers Miel and Toa, the latter of which has many waterfalls, the best known of which is &#x27;el Saltadero&#x27;, which is 17 m high.

The table mountain el Yunque (the anvil) is 10 km to the west of Baracoa. It is a remnant of a plateau and because of its isolation it houses several unique species of ferns and palms. The only official and easiest approach to climb it starts at campismo El Yunque (simple lodgings for Cubans only), where a guide is obligatory (about 15 euro).

From Baracoa, it is possible to visit the Parque Nacional Alejandro de Humboldt located about 20 kilometers north.

Salto Fino is the highest waterfall in the Caribbean, located in this municipality, is produced by a sudden drop in the Arroyo del Infierno (Hell&#x27;s stream), a tributary of the Quibijan river. That river, along with 71 others, flows into the Toa river, which is the largest river in Cuba. The 305-meter-high Salto Fino waterfall is recorded as the 20th-highest water chute in the world.

===Gastronomy===
Baracoa has typical dishes, such as cucurucho, a mix of coconut and much sugar and other ingredients like orange, guava and pineapple and wrapped in a palm leaf. Another is Bacán, which is made from bananas and wrapped in a banana leaf. And of course there is much chocolate in this cocoa-producing region.

==Demographics==
In 2022, the municipality of Baracoa had a population of 78,056. With a total area of , it has a population density of .

==Transport==
Baracoa is the eastern end of Carretera Central, a highway spanning the length of the island of Cuba for 1,435 km, that ends in the village of La Fé, Pinar del Río Province.

===Airport===
Gustavo Rizo Airport is a regional airport that serves this town. This is a small airport that usually operates with national flights. Located west of the bay near the Hotel Porto Santo and about 4 km ( miles) NNW of Baracoa. Although flights are infrequent, Cubana de Aviación flies here from Santiago de Cuba and Havana.

==Notable residents==
Cuban artist Pablo Borges Delgado was born in Baracoa.

Cuban composer Eduardo Davidson was born in Baracoa.

<doc id="855148" wikidata="Q333855" url="?curid=855148" title="Herbert Austin, 1st Baron Austin">
<text>Herbert Austin, 1st Baron Austin (8 November 186623 May 1941) was an English automobile designer and builder who founded the Austin Motor Company. For the majority of his career he was known as Sir Herbert Austin, and the Northfield bypass is called &quot;Sir Herbert Austin Way&quot; after him.

==Background and early life==

The son of a farmer, he was born in Little Missenden, Buckinghamshire in South East England, but the family moved to Wentworth Woodhouse, near Rotherham, Yorkshire in 1870 when his father was appointed farm bailiff. Herbert Austin first went to the village school, later continuing his education at Rotherham Grammar School.

In 1884, he emigrated to Australia, travelling with a maternal uncle, who lived in Melbourne but had recently returned to England on a family visit. They travelled to Australia by ship, via the Cape.

==Life in Melbourne==
He started work with his uncle who was the works manager at a general engineering firm, Mephan Ferguson, in North Melbourne. Two years later he joined Alex. Cowan &amp; Sons, a Scottish paper business which had an agency for printing equipment and Crossley gas engines. Later he worked for the Langlands Foundry Company Limited in Yarra Bank, Melbourne, which made locomotive boilers, wheels and gold mining equipment.

To develop his drawing skills, Austin attended Hotham School of Art in North Melbourne, outside working hours. During this time, he submitted a design for a swing bridge over the Yarra River at Spencer Street, Melbourne, for a competition organised by the Government of Victoria, but did not win.

In December 1887, Austin took up his new appointment as manager of an engineering workshop owned by Richard Pickup Park, who was developing a new sheep-shearing machine for Frederick York Wolseley.

On the strength of this new managership, he married Helen Dron in Melbourne on 26 December 1887. Born in Melbourne on 23 October 1866, she was the seventh daughter of Scottish parents. They were to have two daughters, Irene (born in 1891, later Mrs. Waite) and Zeta (later to become Mrs Lambert). Their only son, Vernon James Austin, was killed in action in France during the First World War on 26 January 1915.

After Austin spent three months improving the sheep-shearing machine, he was asked to join The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company, in Sydney. Shortly after joining, he was sent to a sheep station at Avoca, Victoria to study the machines in use. Austin patented in his own name the improvements he made to the sheep-shearing machines and later sold the patents to the Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company on 10 March 1893 in exchange for shares.

==Motor cars==

Frederick Wolseley wound up the Sydney-registered company in 1889 and transferred ownership of the business to a new company registered in London but all operations remained in Australia. Difficulties with suppliers persuaded the Wolseley board to move assembly to England in 1893. Frederick Wolseley and Herbert Austin left John Howard in charge of the Australian operation and returned to England in November 1893. Austin set up a factory in Broad Street, Birmingham. Fredrick Wolseley resigned from the company in 1894. The Broad Street factory was not large enough, so Austin bought a bigger premises in Aston, Birmingham. Shearing machinery sales were highly seasonal, thus during slack periods in the year they built bicycles.

Looking for other products to even out the workload, Herbert Austin became interested in motor cars and built two different types of three-wheelers in his own time. A version of one of these was taken up by the Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company and listed for sale in 1900, but the Wolseley board could see no profitable future for a motor industry. In 1901, Vickers bought Wolseley&#x27;s car interests, taking Austin too, and naming the new business Wolseley Tool &amp; Motor Company setting it up in Adderley Park, Birmingham. Herbert Austin retained his interest and ties with The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company. He was chairman of their board from 1911 to 1933, when he retired shortly before his death.

In 1905, still under an unexpired five-year contract, Austin resigned from the Wolseley Tool &amp; Motor Company, taking some of the senior staff with him. His brother Harry also joined him in this new venture, having worked with him at Wolseley in Birmingham. Austin raised capital of £37,000 (£4,369,468.69 adjusted for inflation in 2018) and embarked on a search for a factory that could accommodate his idea for a new car manufacturer. He took over an old print works, still outside Birmingham, in Longbridge, which was then in the County of Worcestershire; Longbridge did not become a suburb of Birmingham until 1911 when the city&#x27;s boundaries were expanded. The Austin car works at Longbridge was later to become one of the greatest car manufacturers in the world (also see Longbridge plant).

Austin was producing seventeen different models by 1908. During the First World War Austin produced munitions and built Austin Village in Turves Green for his workers. The car business was difficult after World War I; the Austin company was threatened with bankruptcy in 1921 and a receiver was appointed. The &quot;Baby Austin&quot; was launched in 1922 and offered for sale at £225 (£12,417.65 in 2018); putting it within the budget of customers who had never owned a car before. Its output reached 25,000 annually by 1925; the price was lowered each year. In 1931, the Austin 12/6 was introduced, followed by the Austin 12/4 in 1933.

==Military production==
The company turned its resources to the war effort in 1914 and, in 1917, Austin was knighted for his services and also received the Belgium Order of the Crown of Leopold II, for the employment of 3,000 Belgian refugees at Longbridge.

During World War II, the company specialised in making aircraft; Horsa glider fuselages; specialist army vehicles; hydraulic motors for gun turrets; ammunition boxes, magazines for machine guns, tommy guns, Oerlikon anti-aircraft guns; marine engines for ships lifeboats; and pressings for jerrycans.

===British shadow factories===

Up until 1938, the Air Ministry had been headed by Lord Swinton, who at that point had been forced to resign his position by Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain due to a lack of progress in re-arming the Royal Air Force. New minister Sir Kingsley Wood implemented a new plan to treble British aircraft production in the run up to the Second World War in two parts:
*Development of nine new factories
*Extension and extensions to existing factory complexes to allow either easier switching to aircraft industry capability, or production capacity expansion
Underneath the plan, there was government funding for the building of these new production facilities, in the form of grants and loans. Key to the plan were the products and plans of Rolls-Royce Limited, whose Merlin engine powered many of the key aircraft being developed by the Air Ministry. Austin was placed in charge of implementing the scheme on the producers&#x27; side, who were mainly motor vehicle manufacturers; while technical liaison with the aircraft industry was placed with Charles Bruce-Gardner.

==Parliamentary career==
From 1918 to 1924, Austin served as the Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Birmingham King&#x27;s Norton but never made a speech in the House of Commons. In 1936, he was created &quot;Baron Austin, of Longbridge in the City of Birmingham&quot;. In 1937, he received a Doctor of Laws (LL.D.) from the University of Birmingham.

Lord Austin died from a heart attack and a bout of pneumonia. His only son Vernon had been killed in action in France in 1915 and the peerage became extinct upon his death. He and his wife also had two daughters, Irene (later to become Mrs. Waite) and Zeta (later to become Mrs. Lambert).

He was buried with his wife Helen, Lady Austin in the churchyard of Holy Trinity Church, Lickey, near his former home at Lickey Grange and the factory at Longbridge, close to both Bromsgrove and Birmingham.

<doc id="855150" wikidata="Q4085623" url="?curid=855150" title="Infinite divisibility">
<text>Infinite divisibility arises in different ways in philosophy, physics, economics, order theory (a branch of mathematics), and probability theory (also a branch of mathematics). One may speak of infinite divisibility, or the lack thereof, of matter, space, time, money, or abstract mathematical objects such as the continuum.

== In philosophy ==

The origin of the idea in the Western tradition can be traced to the 5th century BCE starting with the Ancient Greek pre-Socratic philosopher Democritus and his teacher Leucippus, who theorized matter&#x27;s divisibility beyond what can be perceived by the senses until ultimately ending at an indivisible atom. The Indian philosopher, Maharshi Kanada also proposed an atomistic theory, however there is ambiguity around when this philosopher lived, ranging from sometime between the 6th century to 2nd century BCE. Around 500 BC, he postulated that if we go on dividing matter (&quot;padarth&quot;), we shall get smaller and smaller particles. Ultimately, a time will come when we shall come across the smallest particles beyond which further division will not be possible. He named these particles &quot;Parmanu&quot;. Another Indian philosopher, Pakudha Katyayama, elaborated this doctrine and said that these particles normally exist in a combined form which gives us various forms of matter.

Atomism is explored in Plato&#x27;s dialogue Timaeus. Aristotle proves that both length and time are infinitely divisible, refuting atomism. Andrew Pyle gives a lucid account of infinite divisibility in the first few pages of his &quot;Atomism and its Critics&quot;. There he shows how infinite divisibility involves the idea that there is some extended item, such as an apple, which can be divided infinitely many times, where one never divides down to point, or to atoms of any sort. Many philosophers claim that infinite divisibility involves either a collection of &quot;an infinite number of items&quot; (since there are infinite divisions, there must be an infinite collection of objects), or (more rarely), &quot;point-sized items&quot;, or both. Pyle states that the mathematics of infinitely divisible extensions involve neither of these — that there are infinite divisions, but only finite collections of objects and they never are divided down to point extension-less items.

In Zeno&#x27;s arrow paradox, Zeno questioned how an arrow can move if at one moment it is here and motionless and at a later moment be somewhere else and motionless.

In reference to Zeno&#x27;s paradox of the arrow in flight, Alfred North Whitehead writes that &quot;an infinite number of acts of becoming may take place in a finite time if each subsequent act is smaller in a convergent series&quot;:
==In quantum physics==

Until the discovery of quantum mechanics, no distinction was made between the question of whether matter is infinitely divisible and the question of whether matter can be &quot;cut&quot; into smaller parts ad infinitum.

As a result, the Greek word &quot;átomos&quot; (&quot;ἄτομος&quot;), which literally means &quot;uncuttable&quot;, is usually translated as &quot;indivisible&quot;. Whereas the modern atom is indeed divisible, it actually is uncuttable: there is no partition of space such that its parts correspond to material parts of the atom. In other words, the quantum-mechanical description of matter no longer conforms to the cookie cutter paradigm. This casts fresh light on the ancient conundrum of the divisibility of matter. The multiplicity of a material object—the number of its parts—depends on the existence, not of delimiting surfaces, but of internal spatial relations (relative positions between parts), and these lack determinate values. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, the particles that make up an atom—quarks and electrons—are point particles: they do not take up space. What makes an atom nevertheless take up space is &quot;not&quot; any spatially extended &quot;stuff&quot; that &quot;occupies space&quot;, and that might be cut into smaller and smaller pieces, &quot;but&quot; the indeterminacy of its internal spatial relations.

Physical space is often regarded as infinitely divisible: it is thought that any region in space, no matter how small, could be further split. Time is similarly considered as infinitely divisible.

However, according to the best currently accepted theory in physics, the Standard Model, there is a distance (called the Planck length, 1.616229(38)×10−35 metres, named after one of the fathers of Quantum Theory, Max Planck) and therefore a time interval (the amount of time which light takes to traverse that distance in a vacuum, 5.39116(13) × 10−44 seconds, known as the Planck time) at which the Standard Model is expected to break down – effectively making this the smallest physical scale about which meaningful statements can be currently made. To predict the physical behaviour of space-time and fundamental particles at smaller distances requires a new theory of Quantum Gravity, which unifies the hitherto incompatible theories of Quantum Mechanics and General Relativity. 

==In economics==

One dollar, or one euro, is divided into 100 cents; one can only pay in increments of a cent. It is quite commonplace for prices of some commodities such as gasoline to be in increments of a tenth of a cent per gallon or per litre. If gasoline costs $3.979 per gallon and one buys 10 gallons, then the &quot;extra&quot; 9/10 of a cent comes to ten times that: an &quot;extra&quot; 9 cents, so the cent in that case gets paid. Money is infinitely divisible in the sense that it is based upon the real number system. However, modern day coins are not divisible (in the past some coins were weighed with each transaction, and were considered divisible with no particular limit in mind). There is a point of precision in each transaction that is useless because such small amounts of money are insignificant to humans. The more the price is multiplied the more the precision could matter. For example, when buying a million shares of stock, the buyer and seller might be interested in a tenth of a cent price difference, but it&#x27;s only a choice. Everything else in business measurement and choice is similarly divisible to the degree that the parties are interested. For example, financial reports may be reported annually, quarterly, or monthly. Some business managers run cash-flow reports more than once per day.

Although time may be infinitely divisible, data on securities prices are reported at discrete times. For example, if one looks at records of stock prices in the 1920s, one may find the prices at the end of each day, but perhaps not at three-hundredths of a second after 12:47 PM. A new method, however, theoretically, could report at double the rate, which would not prevent further increases of velocity of reporting. Perhaps paradoxically, technical mathematics applied to financial markets is often simpler if infinitely divisible time is used as an approximation. Even in those cases, a precision is chosen with which to work, and measurements are rounded to that approximation. In terms of human interaction, money and time are divisible, but only to the point where further division is not of value, which point cannot be determined exactly.

==In order theory==

To say that the field of rational numbers is infinitely divisible (i.e. order theoretically dense) means that between any two rational numbers there is another rational number. By contrast, the ring of integers is not infinitely divisible.

Infinite divisibility does not imply gaplessness: the rationals do not enjoy the least upper bound property. That means that if one were to partition the rationals into two non-empty sets &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; where &quot;A&quot; contains all rationals less than some irrational number (&quot;π&quot;, say) and &quot;B&quot; all rationals greater than it, then &quot;A&quot; has no largest member and &quot;B&quot; has no smallest member. The field of real numbers, by contrast, is both infinitely divisible and gapless. Any linearly ordered set that is infinitely divisible and gapless, and has more than one member, is uncountably infinite. For a proof, see Cantor&#x27;s first uncountability proof. Infinite divisibility alone implies infiniteness but not uncountability, as the rational numbers exemplify.

==In probability distributions==

To say that a probability distribution &quot;F&quot; on the real line is infinitely divisible means that if &quot;X&quot; is any random variable whose distribution is &quot;F&quot;, then for every positive integer &quot;n&quot; there exist &quot;n&quot; independent identically distributed random variables &quot;X&quot;1, ..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; whose sum is equal in distribution to &quot;X&quot; (those &quot;n&quot; other random variables do not usually have the same probability distribution as &quot;X&quot;).

The Poisson distribution, the stuttering Poisson distribution, the negative binomial distribution, and the Gamma distribution are examples of infinitely divisible distributions — as are the normal distribution, Cauchy distribution and all other members of the stable distribution family. The skew-normal distribution is an example of a non-infinitely divisible distribution. (See Domínguez-Molina and Rocha-Arteaga (2007).)

Every infinitely divisible probability distribution corresponds in a natural way to a Lévy process, i.e., a stochastic process { &quot;Xt&quot; : &quot;t&quot; ≥ 0 } with stationary independent increments (&quot;stationary&quot; means that for &quot;s&quot; &lt; &quot;t&quot;, the probability distribution of &quot;X&quot;&quot;t&quot; − &quot;X&quot;&quot;s&quot; depends only on &quot;t&quot; − &quot;s&quot;; &quot;independent increments&quot; means that that difference is independent of the corresponding difference on any interval not overlapping with [&quot;s&quot;, &quot;t&quot;], and similarly for any finite number of intervals).

This concept of infinite divisibility of probability distributions was introduced in 1929 by Bruno de Finetti.

<text>The Jones Point Light is a small river lighthouse located on the Potomac River in Alexandria, Virginia. It was built in 1855.

==Lighthouse==
It is a small, one-story house with a lantern on top and served primarily as a warning light for naval ships approaching the Washington Navy Yard. The lighthouse was discontinued in 1926, replaced by a small steel skeletal tower located nearby; this smaller tower was in use for ten years before being discontinued. After being dark for more than half a century, Jones Point Light was relit by a private concern in 1995, however, it was eventually put out again after ownership switched from the Daughters of the American Revolution Foundation to the National Park Service. Certain local efforts have called for the structure to be relit, but as of 2017, the only working lighthouse on the Potomac River is the Fort Washington Point Lighthouse, located five miles downriver.

The lighthouse is located on Jones Point in Alexandria, and is part of Jones Point Park. Visitors can approach the lighthouse, but it is currently impossible to enter the building.

The lighthouse is immediately north of the confluence of Hunting Creek and the Potomac River. The 1791-1792 survey of the boundaries of the District of Columbia began at a spot that was then at the tip of a cape at the Point. The south cornerstone from the boundary survey remains in the seawall adjacent to the lighthouse.

In 1980, the lighthouse and the cornerstone were listed in the National Register of Historic Places as reference #80000352. The lighthouse is also listed in the Library of Congress Historic American Buildings Survey as survey number VA-641. The listing shows lighthouse drawings and several black-and-white photos of the lighthouse prior to restoration.

<text>Jones Point is a geographic point on the Potomac River within the city of Alexandria, Virginia, United States. The Jones Point Light and Jones Point Park are located at the point, which is immediately North of the confluence of Hunting Creek and the Potomac River. 

==History==
The 1791–1792 survey of the original boundaries of the District of Columbia began at a spot that was then at the tip of a cape at the Point. The south cornerstone from the boundary survey remains in a seawall several yards south of the lighthouse (see: History of Washington, D.C., and Boundary markers of the original District of Columbia).

During World War I, Jones Point was home to a private shipyard owned by the Virginia Shipbuilding Corporation that was intended to produce cargo ships for the war effort. However, the first ship produced at the yard, SS &quot;Gunston Hall&quot;, was not completed until after the war&#x27;s end. The shipyard was idled in 1921 following accusations of fraud against the owners and most equipment was auctioned off in 1922. In 1923, the property was leased to the Western Marine and Salvage Company to dismantle surplus wood ships. After that company relocated to Maryland, the remaining property at the shipyard was auctioned off in 1928 and the former shipyard facilities were largely demolished.

==Description==
The Woodrow Wilson Bridge crosses the park, most of which is under the jurisdiction of the National Park Service. The Mount Vernon Trail travels through the park.

The City of Alexandria had hosted many anniversary celebrations, starting in the 1980s, centered around its anniversary on July 10, at Jones Point, including its 250th in 1999, and often featuring a fireworks display. Beginning in 2002, they have been largely held at Oronoco Bay Park, located further north along the Potomac.

Jones Point underwent a major renovation, completed in 2012, which included National Park Service placards along walking and biking trails highlighting its history. Other improvements include larger parking lots, a basketball court, a playground, a concession stand, restrooms, new walking and bike paths, small fishing/sightseeing piers, and easy access to the Jones Point lighthouse. The National Park Service and others have erected in and near the park a number of markers that relate the history of Jones Point and its surroundings. One of the few visible remnants of the shipyard is the fitting-out dock, next to which is a grass lawn bound by a concrete retaining wall representing the length and width of SS &quot;Gunston Hall&quot;″s hull.

<doc id="855163" wikidata="Q2483568" url="?curid=855163" title="15017 Cuppy">
<text>15017 Cuppy, provisional designation , is a Florian asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, approximately 2 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 22 September 1998, by the Lowell Observatory Near-Earth-Object Search (LONEOS) at its Anderson Mesa Station, Arizona, United States. The asteroid was named for American humorist Will Cuppy.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Cuppy&quot; orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.0–2.7 AU once every 3 years and 7 months (1,296 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.16 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. The body&#x27;s observation arc begins 7 years prior to its official discovery observation, with a precovery taken at Palomar Observatory in October 1991.

== Physical characteristics ==

According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, &quot;Cuppy&quot; measures 1.8 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.50. This is in line with a generic absolute magnitude-to-diameter conversion, which gives a diameter of approximately 2 kilometers for an absolute magnitude of 15.6 and an assumed albedo of 0.2 to 0.25, which is typical for stony asteroids of the inner asteroid belt. As of 2017, &quot;Cuppy&quot;″s composition, rotation period and shape remain unknown.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named in memory of American literary critic and humorist, Will Cuppy (1884–1949). He is known for his satirical books &quot;The Decline and Fall of Practically Everybody&quot;, &quot;How to Attract the Wombat&quot;, &quot;How to Become Extinct&quot; and &quot;How to Tell Your Friends from the Apes&quot;. The name was proposed by M. Walter. The approved naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 10 September 2003 ().

<text>The Cray Y-MP was a supercomputer sold by Cray Research from 1988, and the successor to the company&#x27;s X-MP. The Y-MP retained software compatibility with the X-MP, but extended the address registers from 24 to 32 bits. High-density VLSI ECL technology was used and a new liquid-cooling system was devised. The Y-MP ran the Cray UNICOS operating system.

The Y-MP could be equipped with two, four or eight vector processors, with two functional units each and a clock cycle time of 6 ns (167 MHz). Peak performance was thus 333 megaflops per processor. Main memory comprised 256, 512, or 1024 MB of SRAM. (Memory was measured and allocated in 64 bit words, and offered in 32, 64, or 128 MWords).

The original Y-MP (otherwise known as the Y-MP Model D) was housed in a chassis similar to the horseshoe-shaped X-MP, but with an extra rectangular cabinet added in the middle (containing the CPU boards), thus forming a &quot;Y&quot; shape in plan view. The system could be configured with one or two &quot;Model D&quot; IOSs (Input/Output Subsystems) and an optional Solid State Disk (SSD) of 256 MB to 4GB capacity. The Y-MP had a measured GFLOPS of 2.144 and a peak GFLOPS of 2.667 in both 1988 and 1989.

The Model D Y-MP was superseded in 1990 by the Y-MP Model E, which replaced IOS Model D with IOS &quot;Model E&quot;, providing twice the I/O throughput. The Y-shaped chassis was dropped in favor of one or two rectangular cabinets (each with a separate connected cabinet containing the liquid-cooling system), depending on configuration. Maximum RAM was increased to 2 GB and up to eight IOSs were possible. Model E variants included the Y-MP 2E, Y-MP 4E, Y-MP 8E and Y-MP 8I, the latter being a single-cabinet (&quot;I&quot; for &quot;Integrated&quot;) version of the two-cabinet 8E. The 2E and 4E were later available with optional secondary air cooling.

The Y-MP M90 was a large-memory variant of the Y-MP Model E introduced in 1992. This replaced the SRAM of the Y-MP with up to 32 GB of slower, but physically smaller DRAM devices. The Y-MP M90 was also available in variants with up to two, four or eight processors (M92, M94 and M98 respectively). Later, the model name was abbreviated to the Cray M90 series.
The [[Cray C90|Y-MP C90]] series is described separately.

== Y-MP EL ==
In 1992, Cray launched the cheaper Y-MP EL (&quot;Entry Level&quot;) model. This was a reimplementation of the Y-MP architecture in CMOS technology, based on the S-2 design acquired by Cray from Supertek Computers in 1990. The EL was an air-cooled system with a completely different VMEbus-based IOS. EL configurations with up to four processors (each with a peak performance of 133 megaflops) and 32 MB to 1 GB of DRAM were available. The Y-MP EL was later developed into the Cray EL90 series (EL92, EL94 and EL98). 
The Y-MP EL came in a cabinet much smaller than the traditional room-filling Cray 2010×1270×810 mm (height × width × depth) and 635 kg in weight—and could be powered from regular mains power.
== In popular culture ==
In the 1992 film &quot;Sneakers&quot;, whose story is centered around extremely high-level cryptography, two lead characters have an important discussion while sitting on a Cray Y-MP.

In an episode of the television dramedy &quot;Northern Exposure&quot; titled &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Perfect&quot;, 
a character expresses her excitement at having finally gained access to a &quot;CRAY Y-MP3&quot; supercomputer.

<text>A Touch of Class (often shortened in initials as ATC) were an international Eurodance group based in Germany, although the four members each came from different countries—Joseph &quot;Joey&quot; Murray from New Zealand, Sarah Egglestone from Australia, Livio Salvi from Italy, and Tracey Elizabeth Packham from England. The pop group was active from 1997 and their most successful release was &quot;Around the World (La La La La La)&quot;, released in 2000. The group disbanded at the end of 2003. Murray and Salvi would later form a cover band Démodé Trio with Yvette Robinson in 2016.

==Career==
The four met together in Hamburg, Germany as cast members of the international Broadway theatre German production of the stage musical &quot;Cats&quot; from October 1997 to April 1998. Sarah Egglestone played Bombalurina, Livio Salvi played Mungojerrie, Tracey Packham played Syllabub, and Joey Murray played as Munkustrap/swing dancer. The four quickly became friends and decided to form a dance group. Egglestone noted, &quot;We were there sitting watching television one day, seeing groups and saying &#x27;there&#x27;s no reason [...] why we can&#x27;t do this.&#x27;&quot; The group first met with producers Alex Christensen and Thomas M. Stein in 1999 and began working on material under the name ATC. The group experimented with merging male and female vocals together. &quot;Producers don&#x27;t seem to want to mix the voices so often [...] that helps give us that little bit of an edge,&quot; Murray remarked.

Their first single, &quot;Around the World (La La La La La)&quot; (which was an English cover of the song &quot;Pesenka&quot; by the Russian group Ruki Vverh!) was first released on 1 April 2000 and went number one in Germany for six weeks in summer 2000. It was later an only Top 40 hit in the United Kingdom and United States.

Their debut album &quot;Planet Pop&quot;, featuring songs from Alex Christensen and Clyde Ward, was released on 6 February 2001 by Sony BMG Music Entertainment and Republic Records, for which they were awarded an ECHO for Best Dance Act.

In 2001, the group released the single &quot;I&#x27;m In Heaven (When You Kiss Me)&quot;, which was moderately successful in parts of Europe. In 2002, &quot;Set Me Free&quot; was released as a single but was not successful. In 2003, the DJ and producer ATB successfully took the band&#x27;s record label to court, and the band was forced to formally drop the ATC initials. Following the name change, the group released a final single, &quot;New York City&quot;, and their second album, &quot;Touch the Sky&quot; in 2003, but they did not match the success of their previous records and the group disbanded as the members decided to go their separate ways.

<doc id="855176" wikidata="Q357077" url="?curid=855176" title="Adiemus (albums)">
<text>Adiemus is a series of new-age music albums by Welsh composer Karl Jenkins. It is also the title of the opening track on the first album of the series, &quot;&quot;, recorded in 1994 and released the next year.

==Concept and origins==
Each &quot;Adiemus&quot; album is a collection of song-length pieces featuring harmonised vocal melody against an orchestra background.

The vocal parts are not written in an actual language, despite some of the lyrics bearing a passing similarity to Latin. The &#x27;words&#x27; were written phonetically by Jenkins to match the orchestral parts, with the intention being to have the voices act purely as another instrument.

The word &quot;adiemus&quot; itself resembles the Latin word &quot;adeamus&quot;, meaning &quot;let us approach&quot; (or &quot;let us submit a cause to a referee&quot;), or is sometimes regarded as the future tense of the same verb, meaning &quot;we shall approach&quot; or &quot;we shall take possession&quot;. The title also resembles two forms of the Latin verb &quot;audire&quot; (&quot;to hear&quot;): &quot;audiemus&quot; (&quot;we shall hear&quot;) and &quot;audiamus&quot; (&quot;let us hear&quot;), although Jenkins has said he was unaware of any connections to real Latin words.

The titular piece on &quot;Adiemus – Songs of Sanctuary&quot; was originally composed for a Delta Air Lines TV commercial. The piece gained significant popularity as a result, and Jenkins then decided to expand it into a full work.

==Instrumentation and performers==
;Scoring for &quot;Songs of Sanctuary&quot;: recorder, 8 percussion, 4 tom-toms, congas, cymbals, claves, floor tom, bass drum, mark tree, bass bell in C, cabasa, wood block, triangle, strings
;Scoring for &quot;Cantata Mundi&quot;:2 flutes (1 doubling on piccolo), 2 oboes (1 doubling on English horn), 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 6 horns, 3 trumpets, 4 trombones, tuba, timpani, claves, cowbell, güiro, 2 cabasas, triangle, chenchen, Egyptian tabla, duhulla, tom-tom, cymbals, shekere, xylophone, glockenspiel, bass marimba, bongos, rek, udu pot, tablas, sticks, pandeiro, timbales, surdo, bass drum, tamtam, suspended cymbals, tambourine, recorder, strings (featuring on album are also the violin, electro-acoustic percussion and gemshorn)
; Scoring for &quot;Dances of Time&quot;:7 singers, 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 2 bassoons, 6 horns, 3 trumpets, 4 trombones, tuba, timpani, 8 percussionists: bass drum, bongos, cowbell, shekere, chocalho, cymbals, claves, congas, cabasa, castanets, dholak, güiro, 5 low drums, low chekere, marimba, rainmaker, rek, snare drum, shaker, surdo, tom-tom, tabla, tamborim, tambourine, triangle, udo, wood block, xylophone, recorder, strings (featuring on album are also the electro-acoustic percussion and gemshorn)
; Scoring for &quot;The Eternal Knot&quot;: recorder, accordion, percussion, harp, strings (on album also the acoustic guitar, Uilleann pipes)
; Scoring for &quot;Vocalise&quot;: for voices and orchestra

Session singer Miriam Stockley performed the vocal parts on the first four albums. Stockley was described by Jenkins as central to the &quot;Adiemus&quot; project due to her range and intonation; however, she was not re-engaged for &quot;Vocalise&quot;. Additional vocals were provided by Mary Carewe on all but &quot;Dances of Time&quot;, which saw the introduction of the Finnish Adiemus Singers (who would later appear on &quot;Vocalise&quot;). Extra vocals and the chorus effects were created by overdubbing multitracked recordings of the singers (in some cases up to 40 times) and varying the speed of the tape.

The &quot;Songs of Sanctuary&quot; orchestra consisted of a string section augmented by various ethnic percussion instruments, with occasional further additions such as bells, a recorder and a quena. Mike Ratledge, with whom Jenkins had played in Soft Machine, contributed to the first album as well. Jenkins added brass and woodwind for &quot;Cantata Mundi&quot;, and continued to add more diverse instruments such as acoustic guitar on later albums. From &quot;Songs of Sanctuary&quot; to &quot;Dances of Time&quot;, the London Philharmonic Orchestra was used; Jenkins later formed his own Adiemus Orchestra to perform on &quot;The Eternal Knot&quot; recordings, returning to the London Philharmonic for &quot;Vocalise&quot;.

==Musical style==
The musical language of &quot;Adiemus&quot; draws heavily on classical and world music. Jenkins follows conventions of tonality up to a point—his harmony is derived from gospel and African music, decorated with functional dissonances such as suspensions and with greater freedom of movement between loosely related key areas. He avoids the most common time signatures, such as 2/4, 3/4 and 4/4, with a slow 3/2 and 6/8, 9/8 and 5/8 (&quot;Cantus Inaequalis&quot; from &quot;Songs of Sanctuary&quot;). &quot;Free time&quot; is also prominent, in this as well as the majority of new age projects. The percussion section, when used prominently, gives the pieces an upbeat, tribal-like rhythm.

The sound of &quot;Adiemus&quot; is generally identified with new-age or Celtic music; &quot;The Eternal Knot&quot; is an explicitly Celtic-themed album that formed the sound-track for the S4C documentary &quot;The Celts&quot;.

==Audience==

&quot;&quot; was a commercial success, topping classical album charts. Though none of its successors has achieved the same critical acclaim, &quot;Adiemus&quot; acquired a cult following and maintained a place in mainstream consciousness through its use in TV commercials, in particular the track &quot;Adiemus&quot; in a Delta Air Lines commercial (for which the project began); &quot;Cantilena&quot;, from &quot;Cantata Mundi&quot;, in a Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester TV commercial and &quot;Chorale VI (Sol–Fa) Cantus Song of Aeolus&quot;, in a Toyota Prius PHV TV commercial. &quot;Adiemus&quot; was also the eighth feature track of the original 1997 &quot;Pure Moods&quot; album. It was used at the beginning and end of James Brandon&#x27;s magic show &quot;Imagine&quot; which played at the Luxor Las Vegas in the late 1990s and continues to be used as the soundtrack behind the &quot;Kubla Khan&quot; pillar show at the end of the Rotunda cave tour in Kartchner Caverns State Park in Arizona. &quot;Adiemus&quot; was used in the trailer to the &quot;Invisible Children&quot; documentary film and featured in the titles of the 1996 BBC children&#x27;s series &quot;&quot;. That same year, it was used in the &quot;Baywatch&quot; episode &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;. &quot;Tintinnabulum&quot; was sampled in Solarstone&#x27;s 1999 Ibiza trance anthem &quot;Seven Cities&quot;.

As is common with Adiemus albums, the cover art of releases in certain regions may be different. The cover of the United States release features a silhouetted persons reminiscent of the cover art for &quot;&quot; in that region as well as the cover for &quot;Diamond Music&quot;. European releases depict an insect hive in various shades of reds and yellows within an abstracted mechanical clock. A special edition release in Europe shows a winged figure ascending into the sky. Other releases use dolphins which are characteristic of Adiemus albums in some markets.

===&quot;Adiemus III: Dances of Time&quot;===
Released in 1998, this album is a tribute to the interrelationship between music and dance throughout history. As such, most tracks are composed in a traditional style of dance, including meter.

In addition to the multitracked vocals used in the previous Adiemus recordings, Jenkins introduces the Finnish Adiemus Singers to perform the chorus to Miriam Stockley&#x27;s lead.

In addition to rich string orchestrations and vocals borrowing from world musical styles common to Adiemus, Jenkins adds the accompaniment of ethnic instruments such as the Uilleann pipes and Carnyx.

====Alternate versions of &quot;Adiemus IV&quot;====
The theme from &quot;Salm O &#x27;Dewi Sant&#x27;&quot; is derived from &quot;Psalm 27&quot; of Jenkins&#x27;s &quot;Dewi Sant&quot;. The theme from &quot;The Dagda&quot; was borrowed from &quot;Lacus Pereverantiae&quot; from Jenkins&#x27;s earlier work &quot;Imagined Oceans&quot;. The theme for &quot;Isle of the Mystic Lake&quot; is that of &quot;Palus Nebularum&quot; also from &quot;Imagined Oceans&quot;. &quot;The Eternal Knot&quot; went on to become the theme for &quot;Benedictus&quot; from Jenkins&#x27;s mass &quot;The Armed Man&quot;.

As is often the case with albums in the Adiemus project, releases in different regions may have different cover art. The cover Japanese release of &quot;Adieums IV: The Eternal Knot&quot; Has gold text and designs, including a dolphin, over a green background whereas other releases have white text over a Celtic knot on a bluish-green background.

===&quot;Adiemus V: Vocalise&quot;===
Released in 2003. In contrast to Jenkins&#x27;s past Adiemus compositions, several of the tracks in this album are arrangements or variations on existing classical works. Additionally, the lyrics for some tracks are borrowed from religious texts or even the title of the piece rather than the invented phonetic language used exclusively in the preceding Adiemus albums. &quot;Adiemus V: Vocalise&quot; features the broadest range in musical styles and instrumentation of the series.

<text>William Joseph Kennedy (born January 16, 1928) is an American writer and journalist who won the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for his 1983 novel &quot;Ironweed&quot;.

Kennedy&#x27;s other works include &quot;The Ink Truck&quot; (1969), &quot;Legs&quot; (1975), &quot;Billy Phelan&#x27;s Greatest Game&quot; (1978), &quot;Roscoe&quot; (2002) and &quot;Changó&#x27;s Beads and Two-Tone Shoes&quot; (2011). Many of his novels have featured the interactions of members of the fictional Irish-American Phelan family in Albany, New York. 

Kennedy has also published a non-fiction book entitled &quot;O Albany!: Improbable City of Political Wizards, Fearless Ethnics, Spectacular Aristocrats, Splendid Nobodies, and Underrated Scoundrels&quot; (1983).

==Early life, family, and education==
William Joseph Kennedy was born January 16, 1928, in Albany, New York to William and Mary Kennedy. He is an only child. Kennedy&#x27;s parents were working-class Irish-Americans. Kennedy was raised Catholic and grew up in the North Albany neighborhood. He attended Public School 20 and Christian Brothers Academy. Kennedy studied at Siena College in Loudonville, New York, from which he graduated in 1949.

==Career==
Kennedy began pursuing a career in journalism after college by joining the &quot;Post Star&quot; in Glens Falls as a sports reporter. He was drafted in 1950 and served in the U.S. Army, where he worked for an Army newspaper in Europe. After his discharge, Kennedy joined the Albany &quot;Times Union&quot; as a reporter. He then relocated to Puerto Rico in 1956 and became managing editor of the &quot;San Juan Star&quot;, a new English language newspaper. While living in San Juan, he befriended the journalist and author Hunter S. Thompson.

Kennedy, who had been eager to leave Albany, returned to his hometown in 1963. He worked for the &quot;Times Union&quot; as an investigative journalist, writing stories exposing activities of Daniel P. O&#x27;Connell and his political cronies in the dominant Democratic Party. He was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize in 1965 for a series of articles on ghettos.

Kennedy published his first novel, &quot;The Ink Truck&quot;, in 1969. The novel&#x27;s main character is a columnist who leads a strike at his newspaper in Albany.

Kennedy lectured in creative writing and journalism from 1974 to 1982 at the University at Albany, becoming a full professor in 1983. He taught writing as a visiting professor at Cornell University during the 1982–1983 academic year.

Kennedy published &quot;Legs&quot; (about Jack (“Legs”) Diamond, a gangster killed in Albany in 1931) in 1975 and &quot;Billy Phelan’s Greatest Game&quot; (about a fictional Albany hustler) in 1978. While both novels were well received by critics, they did not sell well. Kennedy and his family experienced financial difficulties.

Kennedy&#x27;s next novel, &quot;Ironweed&quot; (1983), was rejected by publishers 13 times. However, author Saul Bellow urged Viking Press to reconsider. Viking Press published the novel. The novel was commercially successful, and it won Kennedy a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Critics Circle Award. The novel was adapted into a 1987 film of the same name for which Kennedy wrote the screenplay.

Kennedy also published a nonfiction book entitled &quot;O Albany!: Improbable City of Political Wizards, Fearless Ethnics, Spectacular Aristocrats, Splendid Nobodies, and Underrated Scoundrels&quot; (1983).

Kennedy&#x27;s other novels include &quot;Quinn’s Book&quot; (1988), &quot;Very Old Bones&quot; (1992), &quot;The Flaming Corsage&quot; (1996), &quot;Roscoe&quot; (2002), and &quot;Changó’s Beads and Two-Tone Shoes&quot; (2011). He has also authored plays and screenplays, and co-authored two children&#x27;s books with his son, Brendan Kennedy.

Kennedy&#x27;s use of Albany as the setting for eight of his novels was described in 2011 by book critic Jonathan Yardley as painting &quot;a portrait of a single city perhaps unique in American fiction&quot;.

==Awards==
Kennedy received the 1984 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction for his novel &quot;Ironweed&quot;. He also won the National Book Critics Circle Award.

==Personal life==
Kennedy met Dana (born Ana) Daisy Segarra, a Broadway dancer who went by the stage name Dana Sosa, in her native Puerto Rico. They married in 1957 and had three children. In 1963, they moved from Puerto Rico to Averill Park, New York, where she would die on September 29, 2023.

<doc id="855178" wikidata="Q287639" url="?curid=855178" title="Lauren Hutton">
<text>Lauren Hutton (born Mary Laurence Hutton; November 17, 1943) is an American model and actress. Born and raised in the southern United States, Hutton relocated to New York City in her early adulthood to begin a modeling career. Though she was initially dismissed by agents for a signature gap in her teeth, Hutton signed a modeling contract with Revlon in 1973, which at the time was the biggest contract in the history of the modeling industry. 

Over her career, Hutton has worked both as a model and an actress, making her film debut in the sports drama &quot;Paper Lion&quot; in 1968, opposite Alan Alda. She also played central roles in &quot;The Gambler&quot; (1974) and &quot;American Gigolo&quot; (1980), and later appeared on television in the network series &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;, &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;, &quot;Central Park West&quot; and &quot;Nip/Tuck&quot;.

Hutton has continued to model into her seventies, appearing in numerous advertising campaigns for H&amp;M, Lord and Taylor, and Alexander Wang, and performed on the runway for Tom Ford&#x27;s spring 2012 collection, as well as for Bottega Veneta at the 2016 New York Fashion Week.

==Early life==
Hutton was born Mary Laurence Hutton on November 17, 1943, in Charleston, South Carolina, to Lawrence Bryan Hutton and Minnie (Behrens) Hutton. Her father was a native of Mississippi, where he grew up next-door to William Faulkner, and was stationed in England, during World War II when Lauren was born. 

After the war, Hutton&#x27;s mother divorced her father in 1945, and she relocated to Miami, and later, Tampa, Florida. Hutton spent the remainder of her early life in Tampa, not knowing her father, who died June 24, 1956, from a heart attack at age 37. He was working as a Farm Editor for &quot;The Cotton Trade Journal&quot;, living in Shelby, Tennessee with his second wife, Mary Elizabeth (Everette) Hutton. He is buried at Oxford Memorial Cemetery, in Oxford, Mississippi. &quot;Never meeting my father was the most painful thing in my life,&quot; Hutton said in 1996. &quot;I look just like him and I&#x27;m named for him, but all I have are these two books of his letters and drawings from the war. The day of my birth he wrote and told me about our ancestors, what he thought was important in the world, what books I should read and what he wanted for me.&quot;

After her mother remarried, Hutton took the surname &quot;Hall&quot;, although her stepfather never formally adopted her. She graduated from Chamberlain High School in Tampa in 1961 and was among the first students to attend the University of South Florida in 1961. Hutton later relocated with former Tampa disc jockey Pat Chamburs, a war veteran 19 years her senior who had lost a leg in a kamikaze attack, to New York City, where she worked as a &quot;Bunny&quot; waitress at the Playboy Club, at which time she made her first appearance on camera as a decoy contestant on To Tell The Truth in 1963. The pair lived in Europe, the Bahamas and later moved to New Orleans, where she attended Newcomb College, then a coordinate college within Tulane University, and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1964.

==Career==
===1964–2007: Early work and Revlon===

Hutton returned to New York by herself in the mid 1960s, changed her name to &quot;Lauren Hutton&quot; and embarked on a career as a model. She was advised by agents to hide the gap in her teeth and tried using morticians&#x27; wax to cover the gap; she later used a cap to hide it, which she would often swallow, laugh out, or misplace. Hutton eventually retained this &quot;imperfection&quot; and the &quot;All Movie Guide&quot; stated that it &quot;gave her on-camera persona a down-home sensibility that other, more ethereal models lacked.&quot; She continued to book modeling jobs, and appeared in a Chanel advertisement in 1968, photographed by Richard Avedon.

In 1973, Hutton signed a contract with Revlon cosmetics, worth US$250,000 a year for 20 days&#x27; work (), a professional relationship that lasted for 10 years. At the time, it was the biggest contract in the history of the modeling industry. Hutton&#x27;s initial contract with Revlon involved representation of the Ultima II brand. Twenty years later, she signed a new contract with Revlon to be the spokeswoman for Results, a collection of corrective moisturizing treatments. Her contract with Revlon garnered Hutton further modeling work, and she became a &quot;cover girl,&quot; appearing on the front cover of &quot;Vogue&quot; a record 26 times. 

In 1982, Hutton appeared in two Pepsi Light commercials, one where she strips down to her one-piece swimsuit and dives into a swimming pool and one where she gets all wet when the shower turns on by itself.

In 1988, she appeared in a campaign for Barneys New York, and in 1993, performed as a runway model for designer Calvin Klein, to which &quot;The New York Times&quot; responded by publishing an article stating that Hutton was &quot;just as good as the current flock of fledglings.&quot; In 1997, Hutton became a brand ambassador and appeared in multiple advertising campaigns for the Australian department store David Jones; in 2001, she was replaced by Megan Gale.

Hutton was presented on the November 1999 Millennium cover of American &quot;Vogue&quot; as one of the &quot;Modern Muses&quot;. Following her recovery from a motorcycle accident in 2000, she became the spokeswoman for her own signature brand of cosmetics, &quot;Lauren Hutton&#x27;s Good Stuff&quot;, a line of cosmetic products for mature women. The brand was sold primarily in the USA, but was also available through secondary distribution channels throughout Europe and South America.

In October 2005, Hutton was interviewed on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; program in relation to the future release of an edition of &quot;Big&quot; magazine that was entirely dedicated to Hutton&#x27;s career and included eight pages of nude photos. Hutton agreed to pose nude for the feature, titled &quot;Lauren Hutton: The Beautiful Persists&quot;, when she was 61 years old, and explained to &quot;GMA&quot;:
I want them [women] not to be ashamed of who they are when they&#x27;re in bed. Society has told us to be ashamed ... The really important [thing] is that women understand not to listen to a 2,000-year-old patriarchal society.

Hutton, who is supposedly one of four women offered US$1 million by Larry Flynt to pose nude, also explained that she first sought permission from her 14 godchildren, who told her the photographs would be &quot;inspirational&quot;.

===2008–2021: Runway and campaigns===
In 2008, Hutton accepted an offer from Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen to appear in the lookbook for their clothing line The Row, and explained in 2010: &quot;I saw the clothes, and they were wonderful, real simple, minimalist designs... Ash had a place on the beach, so we did it at her place... And they would dance on the deck, and I would do what they were doing. And it was good.&quot; During the same year, retailer Mango launched a fashion collection inspired by Hutton&#x27;s personal style, and she also appeared in Lord &amp; Taylor&#x27;s fall/winter and spring collections. The following year, she was featured in a campaign by Badgley Mischka.

Alongside celebrity models such as Iman and Paulina Porizkova, Hutton was one of the panel members in a roundtable discussion for the &quot;Model as Muse: Embodying Fashion&quot; , an annual event organized by the Metropolitan Museum&#x27;s Costume Institute. Held in May 2009, the discussion occurred at New York&#x27;s Minetta Tavern. Photographs of Hutton were also displayed as part of the exhibition &quot;The Model as Muse: Embodying Fashion&quot; that was taking place at The Met and acknowledged the significance of fashion models.

A third-party licensing brand of the Jim Henson Company, Henson Independent Properties (HIP), entered into an agreement with Hutton in November 2010 to act as the global licensing agent for her merchandising program. Targeted at women over 40 years of age, the brand launched products such as eyewear, handbags, and luggage, and home décor, globally in 2012. HIP&#x27;s senior vice president at the time referred to Hutton as a &quot;trailblazer&quot; in the press release. Hutton was also a guest judge on the fashion designer reality television show &quot;Project Runway&quot; in 2010, also appearing in advertisements for J.Crew the same year.

In 2011, Hutton walked the runway for Tom Ford&#x27;s spring 2012 collection, and was selected as the house model for the Alexis Bittar jewelry brand. Designer Alexis Bittar, a recipient of the CFDA Accessory Designer of the Year award, personally selected Hutton after choosing Joan Collins for the previous year. Hutton stated that Bittar&#x27;s jewelry is &quot;like art and still doesn&#x27;t look like anything I have ever seen.&quot; Her photos for the campaign were shot by Jack Pierson. Hutton then appeared alongside people such as actress Shuya Chang and Annie Lennox&#x27;s daughter Tali Lennox in the spring 2011 ad campaign for the Club Monaco retail brand. The lookbook was photographed by Ryan McGinley, the youngest photographer to be featured in the Whitney Museum of American Art at the time of the Club Monaco shoot. 

She appeared in a campaign title &quot;Do Something&quot; by designer Alexander Wang, alongside Rod Stewart and Kate Moss in 2015, and was featured in Tod&#x27;s &quot;Timeless Icons&quot; retrospective in 2016. She was also featured in H&amp;M&#x27;s fall 2016 video campaign alongside Hari Nef. In 2016 for Milan Fashion Week, Hutton walked the runway for Bottega Veneta&#x27;s Spring 2017 show.

==Film and television career==

Before becoming an established model, Hutton made her film debut in &quot;Paper Lion&quot; (1968), and later notices for her performances in James Toback&#x27;s &quot;The Gambler&quot; (1974), opposite James Caan. 

She also starred in John Carpenter&#x27;s TV movie &quot;Someone&#x27;s Watching Me!&quot; (1978) and played the female lead in &quot;American Gigolo&quot; (1980). She went on to appear in &quot;Lassiter&quot; (1984), &quot;Once Bitten&quot; (1985), a modest hit, and &quot;Guilty as Charged&quot; (1992). She also made an uncredited cameo appearance as a celebrity party guest in the 1985 film &quot;Perfect&quot;.

In 1984, Hutton joined the cast of the short-lived primetime soap drama, &quot;Paper Dolls&quot;, which co-starred Lloyd Bridges and Morgan Fairchild. In 1986, she co-starred in the lavish TV miniseries &quot;Sins&quot;, which starred Joan Collins, and also starred opposite Stacy Keach in &quot;The Return of Mike Hammer&quot; TV movie. In the spring of 1987, Hutton had a starring role opposite William Devane in a sci-fi themed CBS Movie of the Week titled &quot;Timestalkers&quot;, and later that year guest-starred in the primetime soap drama &quot;Falcon Crest&quot; for several episodes.

In 1995, Hutton was cast in the CBS soap opera &quot;Central Park West,&quot; playing the wealthy socialite Linda Fairchild until the show was canceled the following year.

The following year, Hutton&#x27;s late-night talk show for Turner Original Production, &quot;Lauren Hutton and...,&quot; debuted and ran until 1997. Hutton&#x27;s partner at the time, Luca Babini, was the director, set designer and post-production supervisor of the talk show, and the couple founded Lula Productions as part of their arrangement with the Turner media company.

Hutton appeared in her first feature film in two decades with the 2009 release of &quot;The Joneses&quot;, in which she starred alongside David Duchovny and Demi Moore. When asked about her decision to play the head of a marketing company, Hutton explained:
I thought it was an extraordinary script, and a great idea, this stealth marketing. My character had worked with Demi [Moore] when Demi was an 18-year-old, having her sitting on bar stools at expensive bars and ordering certain champagnes and certain cigarettes. And now she has little pods of these families all over the country, and she&#x27;s got them in rented houses for a year at a whack to heist all the neighbors. And I thought that capitalism could be as vicious as anything they ever came up with in the U.S.S.R. And certainly to some degree, we do seem to be involved in that, don&#x27;t we? All these people who do double jobs of acting were on red carpets wearing diamonds and $20,000 dresses, and that&#x27;s a full-time job. I never did that.

== Personal life ==
Hutton was involved in a 27-year-long relationship with her manager Bob Williamson, who died in 1997. Williamson squandered some US$13 million of her money. Hutton later explained that he had saved her life on five occasions and made sure that she &quot;didn&#x27;t get seduced by the work.&quot; She spoke of a void that Williamson filled:
I didn&#x27;t have a father, and I wanted to be a child with a protector. I&#x27;d never seen a shrink, and there was a psychological situation that clearly needed to be addressed. But, you know, I wanted to see the world and how people lived and think about who are we, how are we, why is the world? And Bob did that for me.

Hutton met Luca Babini on a film set in 1991 and he said of the relationship&#x27;s development in 1996: &quot;I was coming out of a divorce, and she became like a sister to me. Then I fell in love with her. And I loved her feet, which say so much about a person.&quot; Babini also referred to Hutton as &quot;accessible and down to earth,&quot; and described her as a person with &quot;very clear opinions&quot; that she was willing to express.

In October 2000, Hutton joined a motorbike group, which included actors Dennis Hopper, Laurence Fishburne and Jeremy Irons, to celebrate &quot;The Art of the Motorcycle&quot; exhibit at the Hermitage-Guggenheim museum in Las Vegas, Nevada. Prior to the journey, Hutton informed the &quot;Las Vegas Review-Journal&quot;: &quot;I love the feeling of being a naked egg atop that throbbing steel. You feel vulnerable—but so alive.&quot; En route, while going over per hour, Hutton crashed near Hoover Dam, on the border between the US states of Arizona and Nevada, and suffered multiple leg fractures, a fractured arm, broken ribs and sternum, and a punctured lung. Hopper later recalled from before the start of the ride: &quot;She had on a little helmet, sort of tied under her chin. It was cute. And Jeremy [Irons] came up to her and said, &#x27;You got to be kidding.&#x27; He took it off her and gave her a proper helmet.&quot;

Hutton is the original vice-president of the Guggenheim Museum Motorcycle Club, and, in 2003, was a board member of the National Museum of Women in Arts in Washington, D.C., US.

In July 2013, Hutton revealed that she was in the process of writing her memoir, which may be titled &quot;Smile&quot;, and also explained the value of traveling and exploration in her life thus far: &quot;whenever I came back from Africa or the Antarctic, head swelling with the beauty of it all, I found I was loving life again. You look different because of everything that has gone on inside of you...&quot; 

She has lived in NoHo in Manhattan in New York City. As of 2004, Hutton resided mainly in Taos, New Mexico, where she owns a prefab steel home.

==Scuba diving==
Hutton was inducted into the Women Divers Hall of Fame in 2007 as a conservationist and scuba advocate. She started scuba diving in the 1960s, and has dived worldwide. She used her status as a celebrity to promote marine conservation, particularly of sharks, and supports the Shark Research Institute. She has also supported the recreational activity of scuba diving in interviews, articles and personal appearances at dive shows.

<doc id="855185" wikidata="Q2018608" url="?curid=855185" title="Oldehove (tower)">
<text>The Oldehove ( ) is a leaning and unfinished church tower in the medieval centre of the Dutch city of Leeuwarden.

Oldehove is also the name of an artificial mound (terp) on which in the late 9th century a (Catholic) church dedicated to Saint Vitus was built. Construction of the adjoining Late Gothic tower began in 1529, after the citizens of Leeuwarden demanded a tower taller than the one in the city of Groningen, the Martinitoren. In charge were Jacob van Aken (or Aaken) and, after his death, Cornelis Frederiksz.

The tower&#x27;s tilt began during construction. The builders tried to compensate for the tilt, but the project was stopped in 1532 (1533 according to another source). In 1595–1596, the then derelict church was demolished, but the tower remains. It consists mostly of brick, but the builders also used so-called Bentheim sandstone. There are two bells. A bell cast in 1633 by Hans Falck and a bell cast in 1637 by Jacob Noteman, weight . It is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 24331.

The height of the tower is . The tower has 183 steps. The top of the tower is displaced horizontally from the centre. The original plan included attaching a new church to the tower, which would replace the old saint vitus church, but this was never realized. Custodian of the tower is Historisch Centrum Leeuwarden.

<doc id="855186" wikidata="Q8203794" url="?curid=855186" title="Golden Arches">
<text>The Golden Arches are the symbol of McDonald&#x27;s, the global fast-food restaurant chain. Originally, real arches were part of the restaurant design. They were incorporated into the chain&#x27;s logo in 1962, which resembled a stylized restaurant, and in the current Golden Arches logo, introduced 1968, resembling an &quot;M&quot; for &quot;McDonald&#x27;s&quot;. They are widely regarded to be one of the most recognizable logos in the world.

==History==
In 1952, brothers Richard and Maurice McDonald decided they needed a new building to house their hamburger restaurant in San Bernardino, California. They wanted this building to have an entirely new design which would achieve two goals: even greater efficiency, and an eye-catching appearance. They interviewed at least four architects altogether, finally choosing Stanley Clark Meston, an architect practicing in nearby Fontana, in late 1952. The arches had a direct bearing on the interviewing process and their choice of Meston: the first architect they interviewed objected to the arches the brothers wanted; a second wanted to change the arches; a third, prominent Los Angeles architect Douglas Honnold, said that if the brothers were going to tell him what to do they would be better off doing it themselves.

Along with their practical knowledge, the brothers brought Meston a rough sketch of two half-circle arches drawn by Richard. The idea of an arch had struck Richard as a memorable shape to make their stand more visible. After considering one arch parallel to the front of the building, he had sketched two half-circles on either side of the stand. Meston, together with his assistant Charles Fish, responded with a design which included two yellow sheet-metal arches trimmed in neon, called &quot;golden arches&quot; even at the design stage. His design also included a third, smaller arch sign at the roadside with a pudgy character in a chef&#x27;s hat, known as Speedee, striding across the top, trimmed in animated neon.

According to architectural historian Alan Hess, &quot;Meston and Fish turned the crude half-circle suggested by Richard McDonald&#x27;s sketch into a tapered, sophisticated parabola, with tense, springing lines conveying movement and energy.&quot; In the same article Hess added this footnote: &quot;Who first suggested the parabola is unclear. Richard McDonald and George Dexter, the sign contractor who fabricated the first arches, recalled that Dexter came up with the idea and added them to the plans. Charles Fish, who did the working drawings and aided Meston in the design, attributes the idea to his familiarity with the form from a school project in which he used structural parabolas for a hangar. The form was one of many advanced engineering solutions, including folded plate roofs, that were in common currency.&quot;

The first franchised outlet bearing Meston&#x27;s design opened in May 1953 in Phoenix, Arizona. Subsequent franchisees of the McDonald brothers were also required to use Meston&#x27;s design, although Meston adapted the plans for each to the conditions and building codes of each site.

In 1962, seeking to upgrade its image, the company sought a new logo. Fred Turner sketched a stylized &quot;V&quot;, but the company&#x27;s head of engineering and design, Jim Schindler, extended the &quot;V&quot; into an &quot;M&quot; resembling a McDonald&#x27;s store viewed from an angle, with a red isosceles trapezoid &quot;roof&quot; serving as background for lettering.

While McDonald&#x27;s dropped the physical arches from nearly all of its restaurants in the 1960s, the Golden Arches have remained in the logo, and as a commonly understood term for the company. This was partially due to Louis Cheskin&#x27;s argument that the arches, which he likened to &quot;mother McDonald&#x27;s breasts&quot;, had &quot;Freudian applications to the subconscious mind of the consumer and were great assets in marketing McDonald&#x27;s food&quot;.

Alan Hess summarized the arch&#x27;s origin in Googie architecture and ultimate significance as follows:

==Variations==

All restaurants operated by McDonald&#x27;s Canada use a variation of the Golden Arches, which features a maple leaf inserted into the centre of the Golden Arches; subsuming a Canadian national symbol into its corporate symbol.

The McDonald&#x27;s arches in Sedona, Arizona, were made turquoise when the yellow color had been deemed by government officials to be contrasting too much against the scenic red rock.

As of 2019, seven McDonald&#x27;s signs only have one arch, including locations in Magnolia, New Jersey; Winter Haven, Florida; Montrose, Colorado; and the McDonald&#x27;s sign in Pine Bluff, Arkansas.

The McDonald&#x27;s restaurant at 610 Del Monte Ave., Monterey, California, has black arches.

The McDonald&#x27;s in North Scottsdale, Arizona, on 18241 N Pima Rd also has black arches.

The McDonald&#x27;s restaurant at 2172 Sunset Blvd. in Rocklin, California, has dark red arches.

The restaurant at Champs-Elysées in Paris, France, includes a neon McDonald&#x27;s sign with white arches. Also, a recently built McDonald&#x27;s in Bruges, Belgium, has white arches.

In 2017, McDonald&#x27;s China Division was renamed to Golden Arches while keeping the restaurant&#x27;s name as McDonald&#x27;s. McDonald&#x27;s spokesperson explained that the rename was due to McDonald&#x27;s Corporation sold bulk of its China Division to CITIC Group and Carlyle Capital.

In 2018 and again in 2019, McDonald&#x27;s turned the arches upside down on its social media accounts in celebration of International Women&#x27;s Day, changing the &quot;M&quot; to a &quot;W&quot;. A McDonald&#x27;s franchise operated by Patricial Williams in Lynwood, California, also flipped the arches on its sign. This prompted a mild backlash, with some arguing that the move was hypocritical due to the chain&#x27;s underpaying of employees, and others observing that the &quot;M&quot; in the logo could just as easily stand for &quot;men&quot; as it could for &quot;McDonald&#x27;s&quot;.

==Influence==

The term &quot;Golden Arches&quot; is sometimes used as metonym, symbolizing capitalism and globalization. In phrases such as the &quot;Golden Arches Theory of Conflict Prevention&quot;, it is asserted, &quot;No two countries that both have a McDonald&#x27;s have ever fought a war against each other.&quot; The Golden Arches are used as McDonald&#x27;s is one of the more prominent American corporations that have become global in their reach (along with Coca-Cola and Nike).

The shape and color of the prominent space frame trusses used in the heavy-lift ship &quot;VB-10,000&quot; have led some to nickname it the &quot;Golden Arches&quot;.

<doc id="855198" wikidata="Q1493279" url="?curid=855198" title="Colombian necktie">
<text>A Colombian necktie () or tie-cut () is a form of execution or post-mortem mutilation in which the victim&#x27;s tongue is pulled through a deep cut beneath the jaw and left dangling on the neck. It first appeared in Colombia during the period known as &quot;La Violencia&quot; (1948–1958) as a method of psychological warfare designed to scare and intimidate. It was one of several documented types of public mutilation in the conflict used to terrorize people away from their land. Others included killing a pregnant woman, extracting the fetus and placing it on her body and replacing it with a rooster; stuffing the genitals of dead men into their mouths; and the &quot;flower-vase-cut&quot; where the victim&#x27;s limbs were cut off and stuffed into their torso. The methods served to dehumanize victims, as can be seen in terms used by perpetrators such as &quot;bocachiquear&quot; and &quot;picar para tamal&quot;, which refer respectively to the preparation of fish and tamales.

Its invention is sometimes erroneously attributed to drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. During the murder trial of O. J. Simpson, defense lawyers claimed that hitmen hired by drug dealers gave Nicole Brown Simpson a Colombian necktie, but this was barred from testimony due to a lack of supporting evidence.

<doc id="855199" wikidata="Q231908" url="?curid=855199" title="Two-tier healthcare">
<text>Two-tier healthcare is a situation in which a basic government-provided healthcare system provides basic care, and a secondary tier of care exists for those who can pay for additional, better quality or faster access.
Most countries have both publicly and privately funded healthcare, but the degree to which it creates a quality differential depends on the way the two systems are managed, funded, and regulated.

Some publicly funded universal healthcare systems deliver excellent service and the private system tends to be small and not highly differentiated. In other, typically poorer countries, the public health system is underfunded and overstretched, offering opportunities for private companies to deliver better-quality, albeit more expensive coverage.

==Canada==

In Canada, patients have freedom with regard to which doctors and facilities they use. Under Canada&#x27;s single-payer system, all Canadian citizens have the right to access healthcare services governed by provincial and territorial authorities. Within a person&#x27;s province of residence, where they pay taxes, they are able to access any doctor they choose for most basic and essential healthcare services free of charge. Both referrals to specialists and hospital visits are covered.

The decentralized, universal, publicly-funded health system is called Canadian Medicare. The federal government distributes funds to the provinces for healthcare, providing that the provinces have designed their systems to meet certain criteria, which they all do at present. Most people receiving care in Canada do not pay for their care apart from prescriptions and certain procedures that are not covered, such as visits to dentists, optometrists, and some others. The healthcare system is financed primarily through tax revenue. Canadians can choose to purchase health insurance to cover some or all of the healthcare services that are not covered by the government. Medical providers are generally paid fixed fees depending on the type of visit. The average doctor is paid $258,049 a year for the care provided. In situations where a doctor is being paid by their respective provincial healthcare system, the law bans the medical provider from charging patients to supplement their income from Medicare.

Canada technically does not have a two-tiered healthcare system. However, some services in Canada are covered not by government provided healthcare, but instead by the private sector (dentistry, laser eye surgery, most cosmetic plastic surgeries), while most basic essential services are provided by the public healthcare systems, which are primarily administered by the country&#x27;s 13 provinces and territories. Each province and territory has their own insurance plan receiving federal funding on a per-capita basis. About 70% of Canada&#x27;s healthcare spending is via the public system. The other 30% comes from private funding, divided approximately equally between out-of-pocket funding and private insurance, which may be complementary (meeting costs not covered by the public system such as the cost of prescription medicines, dental treatments, and copayments) or supplementary (adding more choice of provider or providing faster access to care). Financial disincentives are in place to make private medicine for services that are covered by Medicare less economical.

Six of Canada&#x27;s ten provinces used to ban private insurance for publicly insured services to inhibit queue jumping and so preserve fairness in the health care system. In 2005, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that in Quebec, such bans are unconstitutional if the waiting period for care is excessively long. However, this ruling only applies within the Province of Quebec. A second court challenge to determine whether the prohibition of private parallel health care violates the patients&#x27; right to life, liberty, and security under Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms was defeated by the Supreme Court of British Columbia in 2020.

Some private hospitals operating at the time the national healthcare plan was being instituted (for example, the Shouldice Hernia Centre in Thornhill, Ontario) continue to operate, but they may not bill additional charges for medical procedures. The Shouldice Hospital, however, has mandatory additional room charges not covered by public health insurance. That effectively places it in the &quot;upper tier&quot; of a two-tier system. Welfare recipients, for example, cannot be referred there, as they would not be able to afford the extra costs.

Clinics are usually private operations but may not bill additional charges. Private healthcare may also be supplied, both in uncovered fields and to foreigners.

==Denmark==
Healthcare in Denmark, although primarily subsidised by the government at the county and the national levels health, is supported by complementary insurance plans to cover elective services not covered by the public system; they also help cover copayments.

==France==
Healthcare in France is a system of private and public physicians, who largely draw their income from the government. There are public as well as private hospitals.

Patients pay a small copayment for certain aspects of care, but many people choose to cover the costs by taking out supplemental health insurance for which a small premium is payable each year.

Thus, France also has a mixed delivery system with complete patient freedom of supplier choice. There is a two-tier funding arrangement, with compulsory funding of core medical services from taxation, with optional private insurance for the cost of copayments.

==Germany==
Healthcare in Germany has multiple sickness funds, either publicly owned or not-for-profit mutuals. Membership of a sickness fund is compulsory for everyone except certain people, who opt out of the insurance system altogether. Doctors are usually self-employed, and hospitals may be publicly owned, privately owned or not for profit.

==Ireland==
Healthcare in the Republic of Ireland is financed mainly by the state. However, all citizens have the option of buying additional private health insurance, provided by four companies. They include VHI, a large publicly owned insurer, operating, like all other insurers, community rating; people are insured at the same basic rate regardless of health status. The other insurers are Glo Healthcare, LAYA and Avivia. Also, much smaller restricted membership companies provide benefits for certain professions, such as police officers.

There are public as well as private hospitals. Private patients are often treated in public hospitals, as all privately insured patients have an entitlement to use the publicly funded system.

==Netherlands==
Healthcare in the Netherlands is essentially single tier, with all persons accessing a common system of private and public providers with complete freedom of choice between providers. Insurers are all private companies. It is heavily subsidized from tax revenues and heavily regulated, with a common, regulated standard insurance policy coverage set nationwide for all providers and a more flexible top up insurance, which is less regulated and set by each company as it chooses.

Insurers set a standard price for each adult for the year throughout the country and must insure all people who apply for insurance at that price regardless of the age or health status of the applicant. An equalization fund, which is essentially a national sickness fund funded from a form of income tax on employers and employees, is used to pay for the health care of all children and to compensate insurers if they have more high risk profile clients than the other insurers.

Thus, Dutch insurers welcome the sick and the elderly because they are fully compensated for the higher-risk profile of these clients. People living in more expensive areas of the country have to pay higher premiums, since they get less compensation from the government because they can afford to pay more but the elderly and the sick pay the same premiums as everyone else in that region. Social insurance covers the insurance costs of those with limited incomes, such as the unemployed and the permanently disabled.

==Singapore==
Healthcare in Singapore uses a true two-tier system for both the provider network and the insurance funds. A government-sponsored and subsidized system of hospitals accepts all patients, with a guaranteed list of services. A parallel system of private hospitals provides services not available in public hospitals or available with extra amenities (such as private rooms and other boutique services).

Singapore uses a universal insurance fund in which all citizens are required to participate, as a baseline. Seniors and certain groups are subsidised in their membership in the universal basic insurance fund.

Optional additional supplementary insurance funds are available for purchase for elective coverage, such as for plastic surgery or for extra amenities in hospital.

==Spain==
Private insurance, private hospitals and private management of public hospitals exist in Spain, and coexist with hospitals completely run by the government. Public insurance guarantees universal coverage, with no expenditure from patients other than a fraction of prescription drug cost. Some private hospitals are only accessible with private insurance. The system is regularly ranked amongst the world&#x27;s best.

==Switzerland==
Private health insurance is compulsory for all persons residing in Switzerland. Insurance companies are required to sell the compulsory basic health insurance at cost, and individuals who cannot afford the premium (based on a premium-to-income ratio) are provided with public cash subsidies. Public hospitals are subsidised, but there are also private hospitals that provide additional services, such as elective services.

In addition to the compulsory basic health insurance, optional complementary and supplementary private insurance plans are available for purchase.

==United Kingdom==
The National Health Service (or NHS) provides universal coverage to all residents of the United Kingdom.

Private healthcare has continued parallel to the NHS, paid for largely by private insurance, and is used by about 11% of the population, generally as an add-on to NHS services and mostly obtained by employer funded insurance schemes. That is a taxable benefit to the employee, the value imputed by the tax authorities as income to the beneficiary. Because NHS services are so comprehensive, there are many areas in which the private sector usually does not compete and private insurers almost always refuse to fund. Childbirth and perinatal services are good examples.

Conversely, there are some areas where the NHS does not offer free treatment (cosmetic surgery for vanity purposes, for example) and so the private sector offers a pay-for-service alternative.

Historically, avoiding waiting lists was the main reason that patients opted out of NHS treatment and into private care. Queues of many months are common. NHS Consultants, who can run both NHS and private services during their NHS contracts, used to be in charge of waiting lists and had a financial incentive to keep the public waiting list long, to ensure a stream of private income to the private business.

Since the Blair government reforms of the NHS, strict rules apply to waiting lists (see hospital choice in the NHS). That and the allocation of better funding in hospitals both reduced waiting times significantly. Most hospital patients are in fact not admitted from a list at all, and those that do, on average, wait less than 9 weeks. Nobody should wait more than 18 weeks. The 18 weeks is not dead time because it includes the time taken to book a first appointment, to conduct all the tests, for the doctor and patient to agree on the desired treatment, and to book and execute an operation or commence the treatment regime. A patient not seen in the 18-week period without just cause has the legal right to go private at the NHS&#x27;s expense. As of August 2020, 53.6% of patients were waiting for more than 18 weeks.

As a result of these improvements, long waiting times reduced, and the private healthcare sector now sells its surplus capacity to the NHS. Dentistry is an area where many practitioners prefer to work privately (because they can set their own fees). NHS dentistry can then be patchy, and some people may find that private dentistry is the only practical option open to them in their locality.

There has always been a degree of private medicine conducted within NHS hospitals, with private work being done in those hospitals and the patient being accommodated in segregated accommodation. Until recently, few NHS patients were ever treated in private hospitals. In the English NHS, however, there has been greater willingness to outsource some work to the private sector, and so some NHS patients do sometimes gain access to private health care facilities at public expense. The equivalent NHS operations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland do not often fund treatment outside of their own facilities.

Whether the NHS funds treatment in a private hospital is a decision for the local commissioning health authority based on formal service contracts.

==United States==

The United States has a two-tier health system, but most of the population cannot gain access to the public provision tiers. Healthcare provided directly by the government is limited to military and veteran families and to certain Native American tribes. Certain cities and towns also provide free care directly but only to those who cannot afford to pay. Medicare, Medicaid, and the State Children&#x27;s Health Insurance Program pay for health care obtained at private facilities but only for the elderly, disabled, and children in poor families. Since enacting the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in 2010, Medicaid has been substantially expanded, and federal subsidies are available for low- to middle-income individuals and families to purchase private health insurance.

The debate over healthcare reform in the United States has included a proposal for a public option or Medicare for all, a government-run insurance program, available to all US citizens, to compete with or replace private insurance plans.

<doc id="855207" wikidata="Q7869490" url="?curid=855207" title="USS Franks">
<text>USS &quot;Franks&quot; (DD-554), a World War II-era in the service of the United States Navy, was named after Medal of Honor recipient Acting Master&#x27;s Mate William Joseph Franks.

&quot;Franks&quot; was launched on 7 December 1942 by Seattle-Tacoma Shipbuilding Corporation, Seattle, Washington; sponsored by Mrs. Martha F. W. Carr, a cousin of Acting Master&#x27;s Mate Franks, and commissioned on 30 July 1943.

==History==
&quot;Franks&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor 25 October 1943 to prepare for the invasion of the Gilbert Islands, for which she sortied 10 November. She screened escort carriers providing air cover for the Tarawa landings, then patrolled off Betio until 27 December, returning then to Pearl Harbor for a brief repair period. The destroyer was underway once more 22 January 1944 with the Southern Attack Force for the invasion of Kwajalein, during which she patrolled against submarines, as well as closing Ebeye Island for reconnaissance and bombardment. Again she replenished at Pearl Harbor, between 18 February and 4 March, then sailed for convoy and patrol duty in the Solomon Islands, arriving at Purvis Bay 15 March.

Targets for &quot;Franks&quot;&#x27; reconnaissance and bombardment missions in March and April 1944 included Mussau, north of New Ireland; Kapingamaringi; and Bougainville. In May, screening minelayers in Buka Passage, &quot;Franks&quot; and contacted, attacked, and sank the on 16 May. Returning to the central Pacific the next month, &quot;Franks&quot; joined in the preinvasion bombardment of Guam from 12 July, and gave fire support to the assault troops who landed there 21 July. After replenishing at Eniwetok, &quot;Franks&quot; sailed back to the South Pacific to prepare for the invasion of the Palaus, off which she arrived 15 September. She served as screen and fighter-director ship, then covered the occupation of Ulithi 23 September.

On 1 October 1944, &quot;Franks&quot; sailed from Manus, beginning a month and a half of operations in the Philippines screening escort carriers. She took part in the preinvasion strikes on Leyte and the landings there, then fought gallantly to protect the escort carriers in the Battle off Samar phase of the Battle of Leyte Gulf, coming under the pounding fire of Japanese battleships 25 October. After replenishing at Manus, she returned to Leyte late in November, and in December joined the fast carrier task force to cover the landings on Mindoro, and to conduct strikes in preparation for the Luzon assault of January 1945.

Still screening the fast carriers, &quot;Franks&quot; took part in strikes on the Japanese home islands on 16 and 17 February 1945 on the eve of the invasion of Iwo Jima, then sailed from Ulithi 14 March for strikes on Kyūshū and the Nansei Shoto in preparation for the Okinawa operation. On 18 March her task force came under heavy enemy air attack, and &quot;Franks&quot; claimed one of the attacking aircraft, joining in the fire which brought several others down. Joining the battleship group, &quot;Franks&quot; closed the southern coast of Okinawa on 24 March for a preinvasion bombardment, which hid the intention to land at Hagushi on the western coast. &quot;Franks&quot; cruised off Okinawa, serving as plane guard for carriers covering the landings 1 April, until 2 April, when she was badly damaged and her commanding officer was fatally injured in a collision with the battleship . She sailed at once for temporary repairs at Ulithi, from which she departed 13 April for overhaul at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

&quot;Franks&quot; returned to the western Pacific on 17 August 1945 at Eniwetok, and on 3 September rendezvoused with the fast carrier task force for air-sea rescue and weather station duty for flights between Okinawa and Honshū. She entered Tokyo Bay 13 September, and on 1 October sailed for the west coast. &quot;Franks&quot; was placed out of commission in reserve at San Pedro, California 31 May 1946, and sold for scrapping on 1 August 1973.

==Honors==
&quot;Franks&quot; received nine battle stars for World War II service. Credited with the first swimming rescue of downed Navy aviators, Mel Collins radar man and first SEAL rescue diver. (Murphy, B 1st navy seals)

<doc id="855209" wikidata="Q11614663" url="?curid=855209" title="Hope Cooke">
<text>Hope Cooke (born June 24, 1940) was the Gyalmo (; Queen Consort) of the 12th and last Chogyal (King) of Sikkim, Palden Thondup Namgyal. Their wedding took place in March 1963. She was termed &quot;Her Highness The Crown Princess of Sikkim&quot; and became the &quot;Gyalmo of Sikkim&quot; at Palden Thondup Namgyal&#x27;s coronation in 1965. She is the first American-born Queen Consort.

In 1975 Namgyal was deposed and Sikkim merged into India as a result of internal turmoil, Indian military intervention and a referendum. Five months later, Cooke returned to the United States with her two children and stepdaughter to enroll them in schools in New York City. Cooke and her husband divorced in 1980. Namgyal died of cancer in New York City in 1982.

Cooke wrote an autobiography, &quot;Time Change&quot; (Simon &amp; Schuster 1981) and began a career as a lecturer, book critic, and magazine contributor, later becoming an urban historian. In her new life as a student of New York City, Cooke published &quot;Seeing New York&quot; (Temple University Press 1995); worked as a newspaper columnist (&quot;Daily News&quot;); and taught at Yale University, Sarah Lawrence College, and Birch Wathen, a New York City private school.

According to BBC report Hope Cooke&#x27;s tenure as queen of Sikkim was marked by controversy, with allegations of her being an agent of the CIA, advocating for American interests and opposing Sikkim&#x27;s integration with India.

== Early life and family ==
Cooke was born in San Francisco to John J. Cooke, a flight instructor, and Hope Noyes, an amateur pilot. She was raised in the Episcopal Church. Her mother, Hope Noyes, died in January 1942 at age 25 when the plane she was flying solo crashed.

After her mother&#x27;s death, Cooke and her half-sister, Harriet Townsend, moved to a New York City apartment across the hall from their maternal grandparents, Helen (Humpstone) and Winchester Noyes, the president of J.H. Winchester &amp; Co., an international shipping brokerage firm. They were raised by a succession of governesses. Her grandfather died when she was 12 and her grandmother died three years later. Cooke became the ward of her aunt and uncle, Mary Paul (Noyes) and Selden Chapin, a former US Ambassador to Iran and Peru. She studied at the Chapin School in New York and attended the Madeira School for three years before finishing high school in Iran.

== Marriage to the Crown Prince of Sikkim ==

In 1959, Cooke was a freshman majoring in Asian Studies at Sarah Lawrence College and sharing an apartment with actress Jane Alexander. She went on a summer trip to India and met Palden Thondup Namgyal, Crown Prince of Sikkim, in the lounge of the Windamere Hotel in Darjeeling, India. He was a 36 year-old recent widower with two sons and a daughter. They were drawn to each other by the similar isolation of their childhoods. Two years later, in 1961, their engagement was announced, but the wedding was put off for more than a year because astrologers in both Sikkim and India warned that 1962 was an inauspicious year for marriages.

On March 20, 1963, Cooke married Namgyal in a Buddhist monastery in a ceremony performed by fourteen lamas. Wedding guests included members of Indian royalty, Indian and Sikkimese generals, and the US Ambassador to India, John Kenneth Galbraith. Cooke renounced her United States citizenship as required by Sikkim&#x27;s laws and also as a demonstration to the people of Sikkim that she was not an &quot;American arm&quot; in the Himalayas. She was dropped from the &quot;Social Register&quot; but the marriage was reported in &quot;National Geographic&quot; magazine. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; followed the royal couple on one of their yearly trips to the United States. Although her husband was Buddhist, Cooke did not officially convert from Christianity to Buddhism though she had practiced Buddhism from an early age (Henry Kissinger once remarked &quot;she has become more Buddhist than the population&quot;). Namgyal was crowned monarch of Sikkim on April 4, 1965. However, their marriage faced strains, and both had affairs: he with a married Belgian woman, and she with an American friend.

At the same time, Sikkim was under strain due to annexation pressures from India. Crowds marched on the palace against the monarchy. Cooke&#x27;s husband was deposed on April 10, 1975 and confined to his palace under house arrest. The couple soon separated. Cooke returned to Manhattan, where she raised her children, Palden Gyurmed and Hope Leezum.

In May 1975, Representative James W. Symington (D-MO) and Senator Mike Mansfield (D-MT) sponsored private bills to restore her citizenship; however, after the bill passed the Senate, several members of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration objected, and the bill had to be amended to grant her only U.S. permanent resident status before it could gain their support and pass Congress. President Gerald Ford signed the bill into law on June 16, 1976. By 1981, she still had not been able to regain U.S. citizenship. The royal couple divorced in 1980, and Namgyal died of cancer in 1982 in New York City.

== Later life ==
With child support from Namgyal and an inheritance from her grandparents, Cooke rented an apartment in the Yorkville area of New York City. This time around, she felt &quot;profoundly displaced&quot; in the city and started going on walking tours and then creating her own. She studied Dutch journals, old church sermons, and newspaper articles to acquaint herself with the city and lectured on the social history of New York. She wrote a weekly column, &quot;Undiscovered Manhattan&quot;, for the &quot;Daily News&quot;. Her books include an award-winning memoir of her life in Sikkim, &quot;Time Change: An Autobiography&quot; (1981), an off-the-beaten-path guide to New York, &quot;Seeing New York&quot;, developed from her walking tours, and, with Jacques d&#x27;Amboise, she published &quot;Teaching the Magic of Dance&quot;.

Cooke remarried in 1983 to Mike Wallace, a Pulitzer Prize–winning historian and Distinguished Professor of History at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. They later divorced. Her son, Prince Palden, a New York banker and financial advisor, married Kesang Deki Tashi and has a son and three daughters. Cooke&#x27;s daughter, Princess Hope, graduated from Milton Academy and Georgetown University, and married (and later divorced) Thomas Gwyn Reich, Jr., a US Foreign Service officer; she later remarried, to Yep Wangyal Tobden.

Cooke lived in London for a few years before returning to the United States, where she now lives in Brooklyn and currently works as a writer, historian, and lecturer. She was a consultant for PBS&#x27;s &quot;New York: A Documentary Film&quot; (1999–2001). Cooke has contributed to book reviews and magazines and lectured widely.

==Controversies==
Cooke faced controversy during her tenure as queen due to allegations of being an agent of the CIA, purportedly promoting American interests and opposing Sikkim&#x27;s merger with India. Her American background fueled suspicions of CIA influence in Sikkim&#x27;s affairs.

<doc id="855210" wikidata="Q2095057" url="?curid=855210" title="Lead ship">
<text>The lead ship, name ship, or class leader is the first of a series or class of ships that are all constructed according to the same general design. The term is applicable to naval ships and large civilian vessels.

Large ships are very complex and may take five to ten years to build. Improvements based on experience with building and operating the lead ship are likely to be incorporated into the design or construction of later ships in the class, so it is rare to have vessels that are identical.

The second and later ships are often started before the first one is completed, launched and tested. Nevertheless, building copies is still more efficient and cost effective than building prototypes, and the lead ship will usually be followed by copies with some improvements rather than radically different versions. The improvements will sometimes be retrofitted to the lead ship. Occasionally, the lead ship will be launched and commissioned for shakedown testing before following ships are completed, making the lead ship a combination of template and prototype, rather than expending resources on a prototype that will never see actual use.

==Naming==
Ship classes are typically named in one of two ways; echoing the name of the lead ship, such as the s, whose lead ship was , and the , whose lead ship was , or defining a theme by which vessels in the class are named, as in the Royal Navy&#x27;s s, named after tribes of the world, such as . If a ship class is produced for another navy, the first active unit will become the lead ship for that navy; for example, the s are known as the in Royal Australian Navy service.

<doc id="855214" wikidata="Q650736" url="?curid=855214" title="Beach ball">
<text>A beach ball is an inflatable ball for beach and water games. Their large size and light weight require little effort to propel them.

They became popular in the beach-themed films of the 1960s starring Annette Funicello and Frankie Avalon. These movies include &quot;Beach Party&quot;, &quot;Muscle Beach Party&quot;, &quot;Beach Blanket Bingo&quot; and &quot;How to Stuff a Wild Bikini&quot;.

==Design==
Beach balls range from hand-sized to over across or larger. They generally have a set of soft plastic panels, with two circular end panels, one with an oral inflation valve, intended to be inflated by lung power or pump. A common design is vertical solid colored stripes alternating with white stripes. There are also other designs, including beach balls in a single solid colour, promotional beach balls with advertisements or company slogans, as globes or as Emojis.

Some manufacturers specify the size of their beach balls (which is often confused with the diameter) as the tip-to-tip length of a deflated ball (approximately half the circumference), or even the length of the panels before they have their ends cut and joined into a beach ball. Thus the actual diameter may be about formula_1 (≈ 0.6366...) of the nominal size.

Other sizes of beach balls exist, ranging from smaller to larger ones. There are beach balls that have a diameter of or even .

The world&#x27;s largest beach ball was made in London, England on May 30, 2017. It was carried by a barge on River Thames. It had a diameter of with the word &quot;Baywatch&quot; written all over it. It was produced by Paramount Pictures to promote the 2017 movie &quot;Baywatch&quot;. The record was registered by Guinness and the certificates were given to the members of the film&#x27;s cast.

==Uses==

Beach ball sports include water polo and volleyball. While they are much less expensive than the balls used in professional sports, they are also much less durable, as most of them are made of soft plastic. Giant beach balls may be tossed between crowd members at concerts, festivals, and sporting events. Many graduates use beach balls as a prank during ceremonies, hitting them around the crowd. They are bounced around crowds at cricket, baseball and football games, but are frequently confiscated and popped by security. Some security personnel at these events might inspect the ball&#x27;s interior after tearing it, most likely searching for illegal items (e.g. narcotics) that might be transported inside the beach ball. Guards may also do this so that the ball cannot enter the field and obstruct or distract players. This happened in August 1999, in a baseball game between the Cleveland Guardians and the Los Angeles Angels, where the distraction caused by a beach ball on the field resulted in the Angels&#x27; defeat.

Their light weight and stability make beach balls ideal for trained seals to balance on their noses, which has become an iconic scene. Beach balls are also a popular prop used in swimsuit photography and to promote or represent beach-themed events or locations. Popular games using the beach ball include, volleyball, beach ball, and ball.

Some more basic uses of beach balls include a game&#x27;s tool, a toy, or just a decoration in certain events. Another basic use of them is simply for sitting, sizes ranging from 24&quot; to 42&quot; are commonly used. Some examples regarding to the use of sitting are for seats in certain parties (i.e. birthday parties, pool parties, house parties, etc.). However, they are not as reinforced as exercise balls. Excessive sitting and bouncing can slowly damage the beach ball, which may cause it to eventually leak or even pop.

<doc id="855216" wikidata="Q91818" url="?curid=855216" title="Dun (fortification)">
<text>A dun is an ancient or medieval fort. In Great Britain and Ireland it is mainly a kind of hillfort and also a kind of Atlantic roundhouse.

== Etymology ==
The term comes from Irish &quot;dún&quot; or Scottish Gaelic &quot;dùn&quot; (meaning &quot;fort&quot;), and is cognate with Old Welsh &quot;din&quot; (whence Welsh &quot;dinas&quot; &quot;city&quot; comes).

In certain instances, place-names containing &quot;Dun-&quot; or similar in Northern England and Southern Scotland, may be derived from a Brittonic cognate of the Welsh form &quot;din&quot;. In this region, substitution of the Brittonic form by the Gaelic equivalent may have been widespread in toponyms.

The Dacian dava (hill fort) is probably etymologically cognate.

== Details ==
In some areas duns were built on any suitable crag or hillock, particularly south of the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. There are many duns on the west coast of Ireland and they feature in Irish mythology. For example, the tale of the &quot;Táin Bó Flidhais&quot; features Dún Chiortáin and Dún Chaocháin.

Duns seem to have arrived with the Celts in about the 7th century BC. Early duns had near vertical ramparts made of stone and timber. There were two walls, an inner wall and the outside one. Vitrified forts are the remains of duns that have been set on fire and where stones have been partly melted. Use of duns continued in some parts into the Middle Ages.

Duns are similar to brochs, but are smaller and probably would not have been capable of supporting a very tall structure. Good examples of this kind of dun can be found in the Outer Hebrides of Scotland, on artificial islands in small lakes.

== Toponymy ==
The word &quot;dun&quot; is, along with like-sounding cognate forms, an element frequently found in Celtic toponymy; especially that of Ireland and Scotland. It can include fortifications of all sizes and kinds:

=== Ireland ===
* Donegal
* Doneraile
* Down
* Dún Laoghaire
* Dún an Ri (Kingscourt), County Cavan
* Dundalk
* Dundonald
* Dundrum, County Down
* Dundrum, Dublin
* Dungannon
* Dungarvan
* Dunmurry
* Portadown

=== Scotland ===
Many settlement and geographical names in Scotland are named with Gaelic &quot;dun&quot; (&quot;fort&quot;), as well as cognates in Brittonic languages such as Cumbric and Pictish.

* Drumpellier, Lanarkshire
* Dumbarton, Dunbartonshire
* Dumfries, Dumfriesshire – possibly Brittonic &quot;din-pres&quot; (&quot;thicket fort&quot;).
* Dundee, Angus
* Dunearn, Nairnshire 
* Dunearn, Fife – possibly dùn-Èirinn (&quot;fort of Ireland&quot;).
* Dunfermline, Fife
* Duniface, Fife – possibly Pictish equivalent of Welsh &quot;din-y-faes&quot; (&quot;fort of the field&quot;).
* Dunimarle, Fife
* Dunino, Fife
* Dunipace, Stirlingshire - Brittonic equivalent of Welsh &quot;din-y-bas&quot; (&quot;fort of the shallow&quot;).
* Dunlop, Ayrshire
* Dunoon, Argyll and Bute
* Duns, Berwickshire
* Duntarvie, West Lothian
* Tantallon, East Lothian
* Edinburgh, - Name in Scottish Gaelic is &quot;Dun Eideann&quot;.

=== England ===
Some place-names in England are derived from Brittonic cognates of Welsh &quot;din&quot; (c.f. Cornish &quot;dyn&quot;, Cumbric &quot;*din&quot;), and fewer perhaps from the Gaelic form. 

* Din Guoaroy, Northumberland – obsolete name for Bamburgh. Equivalent to Welsh &quot;din-gwarae&quot; (&quot;fort of the play&quot;).
* Dinckley, Lancashire - equivalent to Welsh &quot;din&quot; (&quot;fort&quot;) + &quot;coed&quot; (&quot;wood&quot;) (+ English, &quot;-ley&quot;).
* Dinder, Somerset - formerly &quot;Dinre&quot;, compare Welsh &quot;dinbre&quot; (&quot;hill with a fort&quot;).
* Dinedor, Herefordshire - formerly &quot;Dunre&quot;, Welsh &quot;dinbre&quot;; compare Dinder above.
* Dunmallard Hill, Cumberland
* Durham - &quot;Dunelm&quot;
* Glendinning Rigg, Cumberland
* Londesborough, Yorkshire – &quot;Lugudunum&quot;, &quot;*lọ:co-&quot; + &quot;duno&quot; (&quot;shining fort&quot;).
* Temon, Cumberland - possibly equivalent to Welsh &quot;din&quot; (&quot;fort&quot;) + &quot;maen&quot; (&quot;rock&quot;).
* Tintagel, Cornwall

Roman-era toponyms ending in &quot;-dunum&quot; may represent an ancient Brittonic &quot;*duno&quot;.
* Cambodunum, Yorkshire
* Rigodunum, Lancashire
* Segedunum, Northumberland 
* Uxelodunum, Cumberland – c.f. Welsh &quot;ucheldin&quot; (&quot;high fort&quot;).

London has been etymologised as Brittonic &quot;*lin-&quot; + &quot;dun-&quot; (&quot;lake fort&quot;). Coates has rejected such an etymology as &quot;incompatible with early forms&quot;.

=== Wales ===
* Carmarthen, Carmarthenshire – &quot;Moridunum&quot; (&quot;sea fort&quot;).
* Denbigh, Denbighshire – from &quot;dinbych&quot; (&quot;small fort&quot;)
* Tintern, Monmouthshire

=== Italy ===
* Belluno, Veneto
* Duno
* Induno Olona
* Verduno

=== France and Switzerland ===

The Proto-Celtic form is &quot;*Dūno-&quot;, yielding Greek δοῦνον. It is ultimately cognate to English &quot;town&quot;. The Gaulish term survives in many toponyms in France and Switzerland:
* Autun - &quot;Augustodūnon&quot; fort of Augustus
* Lyon – &quot;Lugudūnon&quot; &quot;Lugus&#x27; fort&quot;
* Nevers – &quot;Nouiodūnon&quot; &quot;new fort&quot;
* Olten – &quot;Ol(l)odūnonm&quot; &quot;fort on the Olon river&quot;
* Thun – &quot;Dūnon&quot; 
* Verdun – &quot;Uerodūnon&quot; &quot;strong fort&quot;
* Yverdon-les-Bains – &quot;Eburodūnon&quot; &quot;yew fort&quot;

=== Germany ===
* Kempten, Bavaria – &quot;Cambodunum&quot;

=== Bulgaria and Serbia ===
* Dunonia
* Singidunum

=== Romania ===
* Noviodunum - Ancient Latin name of the town Isaccea in Dobruja, Romania

=== Elsewhere in the world ===
* Dunedin, New Zealand – from &quot;Dùn Èideann&quot;, the Gaelic name for Edinburgh.
* Dunedin, Florida, USA – see Dunedin, New Zealand.

<text>The Minneapolis Public Library (MPL) was a library system that served the residents of Minneapolis, Minnesota in the United States. It was founded in 1885 with the establishment of the Minneapolis Library Board by an amendment to the Minneapolis City Charter. Lumber baron and philanthropist T. B. Walker and other city leaders such as Thomas Lowry were members of the first library board. In 2008, after some financial difficulties, the library was merged into the Hennepin County Library system. At the time of its merger, the library included Central Library in downtown Minneapolis and fourteen branch libraries. Its collection numbered about 3.1 million items with about 2.2 million of these housed in the central library.

==Central Library==


The predecessor of Minneapolis&#x27;s public library was a private library called the Minneapolis Athenæum. It was organized by Minneapolis businessmen in 1859 as a subscription library, and its shares were traded on the local stock market. After T. B. Walker moved to Minneapolis he bought shares in the Athenæum and gave away memberships to it, promoting the idea of a free public library for the city. Other stock holders raised objections, but the technique worked and soon the city financed a free library for the public with a one mill property tax. When the Minneapolis Public Library was established in 1885 the Athenæum became a partner of it and still exists as a separate nonprofit organization sharing space with the library.

Three central libraries have been built in Minneapolis, each replacing the last with a bigger and more up-to-date building. The first opened in 1889, the second in 1961 and the third and current building in 2006.

On November 7, 2000, Minneapolis voters approved a $140 million package to improve library services, including funding a new Central Library building. The building was designed by Cesar Pelli, along with the Minneapolis firm Architectural Alliance, It opened to the public on May 20, 2006. At a cost of $250 per square foot, the library features a host of energy-efficient measures, including a roof garden and substantial daylight. While the building was under construction, most services were provided at the interim Central Library Marquette location, on two floors in Marquette Plaza (formerly the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis). Cost of providing an interim site while the old library was demolished and rebuilt exceeded $10 million.

Until the 2002 closure and demolition of the old central library, the Minneapolis Planetarium found its home there, possessing a projector machine literally older than the space age itself (originally delivered and installed in 1954, three years before the launch of Sputnik I). In 2005, the Minnesota Legislature apportioned funding for a new planetarium, then planned to be on the roof of the new Central Library building. Instead, the planetarium became part of the new Bell Museum of Natural History on the University of Minnesota Saint Paul campus.

==Community libraries==

The first two branches of the Minneapolis Public Library opened in 1890, one each on the north and south sides of Minneapolis. A branch in the basement of North High School opened on February 27, 1890, and one at 17th and Franklin Ave on April 23. By 2002 there were fourteen branches or community libraries. Each library had a staff member who was assigned to local schools to discuss the services available at the library.

The 2002 referendum also included funds to renovate community libraries, supplementing an existing program. The community libraries and their renovation status are:

* East Lake Community Library, built 1976, renovated 2007
* Franklin Community Library, built 1914, renovated 2005
* Hosmer Community Library, built 1916, renovated 1997
* Linden Hills Community Library, built 1931, renovated 2002
* Nokomis Community Library, built 1968, renovated 2009–2011
* North Regional Community Library, built 1971, renovated 2007
* Northeast Community Library, built 1973, reopened after renovation in 2011
* Pierre Bottineau Community Library, built 2003 in the Grain Belt Brewery complex to replace an older storefront library
* Roosevelt Community Library, built 1927, renovated and expanded 2013 
* Southeast Community Library, built 1963
* Sumner Community Library, built 1915, renovated 2005
* Walker Community Library, first built in 1915 (original building now privately owned), a replacement was built in 1981, which was demolished and replaced by a building that opened in 2014
* Washburn Community Library, built 1970, expanded 1992, renovated 2014
* Webber Park Community Library, built 1980, razed in 2013. Now in a new building on 4440 Humboldt Avenue that opened in May 2017

==Historic buildings==

Many of the buildings built by the Minneapolis Public Library system are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In some cases, the libraries have been demolished and moved to new, more modern buildings.
* East Lake Community Library, original building at 2916 East Lake Street (since moved to 2727 East Lake Street). The building now houses a liberal political products store.
* Franklin Community Library, current building at 1314 East Franklin Ave.
* Linden Hills Branch Library, current building at 2900 W. 43rd St.
* Minneapolis Public Library, North Branch, original building at 1834 Emerson Ave. N. The North branch was closed not long after the much larger North Regional Library opened at 1315 Lowry Ave. N. about a mile away.
* Roosevelt Community Library, current building at 4026 28th Ave. S.
* Sumner Branch Library, current building at 611 Emerson Ave. N.
* Thirty-sixth Street Branch Library, current building at 347 E. 36th. St., since renamed to Hosmer Community Library
* Walker Branch Library, original building at 2901 Hennepin Ave. S. (since moved across the street to 2880 Hennepin Avenue) Some had suggested that the Walker library be moved back to its original building as it was vacant and the new underground facility has been dogged by maintenance issues; however the original library building is still privately owned.
Of this list, all but the North Branch library were built under the leadership of the city&#x27;s head librarian, Gratia Countryman. Franklin, Sumner, and Thirty-Sixth Street were built with funds from Andrew Carnegie.

==Cataloging==
Unusually for a public library, the Minneapolis Public Library used the Library of Congress Classification. Prior to 1969 it used the Dewey Decimal System, although around 1890, the library switched to the early and short-lived Putnam Classification System, developed by Minneapolis librarian Herbert Putnam. He later became Librarian of Congress, and revised his Putnam system into the current Library of Congress classification system.

==Events: 2000–2008==

===2000 referendum===
In 2000 Minneapolis voters approved a $140 million package to fund a new $110 million Central Library building, and spend $30 million on improvements to community libraries. The referendum began as a framework for discussion called &quot;Outlook Twenty Ten: A Discussion Plan to Improve All Minneapolis Community Libraries&quot;, submitted to the Minneapolis Public Library Board in July 1999, and drafted in anticipation of voters approving the referendum. The framework was submitted to the board by Amy Ryan, Chief of Community Libraries. When the referendum was approved, the Library Board turned to the plan which contained a profile of each of the fourteen community libraries, including highlights of patron surveys. It also contained at least three suggestions for every community library, entitled Options &#x27;A&#x27;, &#x27;B&#x27;, &#x27;C&#x27; and onward. An update on the plan came out in 2004.

===&quot;Adamson v. Minneapolis Public Library&quot;===
&quot;Adamson v. Minneapolis Public Library&quot; was a civil complaint of 23 March 2003 by a dozen librarians against the library&#x27;s management for a claimed failure to prevent sexual harassment over many years by library patrons having unlimited use of library computers for accessing pornography. The case followed an EEOC determination on 23 May 2001 that &quot;the Respondent did subject the Charging Party to sexually hostile work environment. This is in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.&quot; The case settled when the library agreed to pay the plaintiffs $435,000 and to take corrective action to prevent further harassment.

===Funding crisis and merger===
Despite city funding and some private support, the library had suffered from reduced funding from external sources, including the federal government and Local Government Aid (LGA) from the State of Minnesota. In the recession of the 2000s following the Dot-com bubble, hours were drastically cut and money for acquisitions sharply declined. Because Minnesota library card holders could borrow from other systems in the state, MPL also duplicated services offered by Hennepin County Library (HCL), which saw shared use by MPL patrons. This was especially apparent on Mondays, when Minneapolis libraries were closed.

In 2007, the Minneapolis Library Board agreed to pursue a merger with the county system. The Minneapolis Library Board and Minneapolis City Council approved the merger in March 2007, the Hennepin County Board approved the merger in April 2007, and on May 19, 2007 the Minnesota State Legislature approved a bill merging the systems during 2008. The merged system is the Hennepin County Library with 41 locations. On January 1, 2008, the library was merged into the Hennepin County Library. The last meeting of the Minneapolis Public Library Board of Trustees took place on December 19, 2007.

<doc id="855221" wikidata="Q1192725" url="?curid=855221" title="Unreal (video game series)">
<text>Unreal is a series of first-person shooter video games developed by Epic Games. The series is known for its exhibition of the namesake Unreal Engine that powers the games and is available for other developers to license.

Publishing rights for the series have changed hands several times. GT Interactive was the original publisher and would be later succeeded by Infogrames, Atari, and Midway Games.

== Games ==
=== Anthologies ===
* &quot;Unreal Anthology&quot; (2006) contains &quot;Unreal Gold&quot;, &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;, &quot;Unreal II&quot;, &quot;Unreal Tournament 2004&quot;, and a bonus soundtrack CD. Missing from &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot; are the improved S3TC textures which came with the original release of the game. Also, the internet connectivity of &quot;Unreal&quot; in this collection is isolated by having a master server different from that of the original game.

==Reception==
Guinness World Records awarded the series with three world records. These records include, &quot;First Console Game to Receive a Downloadable Patch&quot;, &quot;First Console Game to Support Player Modifications&quot; and &quot;First Game to be Created Using the Unreal Engine&quot;.

<doc id="855226" wikidata="Q224644" url="?curid=855226" title="Joe Kubert">
<text>Joseph Kubert (; September 18, 1926 – August 12, 2012) was a Polish-born American comic book artist, art teacher, and founder of The Kubert School. He is best known for his work on the DC Comics characters Sgt. Rock and Hawkman. He is also known for working on his own creations, such as Tor, Son of Sinbad, and the Viking Prince, and, with writer Robin Moore, the comic strip &quot;Tales of the Green Beret&quot;.

Two of Kubert&#x27;s sons, Andy Kubert and Adam Kubert, themselves became recognized comic book artists, as did Andy&#x27;s daughter Emma Kubert and many of Kubert&#x27;s former students, including Stephen R. Bissette, Amanda Conner, Rick Veitch, Eric Shanower, Steve Lieber, and Scott Kolins. Kubert&#x27;s other grand-daughter, Katie Kubert, became an editor for both DC and Marvel Comics.

Kubert was inducted into the Harvey Awards&#x27; Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1997, and the Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1998.

==Early life==
Kubert was born September 18, 1926 to a Jewish family in Jezierzany in southeast Poland (now Ozeriany in Ukraine). He was the son of Etta (née Reisenberg) and Jacob Kubert. He immigrated to Brooklyn, New York City, United States, at age two months with his parents and his two-and-a-half-year-old sister Ida. Raised in the East New York neighborhood, the son of a kosher butcher, Kubert started drawing at an early age, encouraged by his parents.

In his introduction to his graphic novel &quot;Yossel&quot;, Kubert wrote, &quot;I got my first paying job as a cartoonist for comic books when I was eleven-and-a-half or twelve years old. Five dollars a page. In 1938, that was a lot of money&quot;. Another source, utilizing quotes from Kubert, says in 1938, a school friend who was related to Louis Silberkleit, a principal of MLJ Studios (the future Archie Comics), urged Kubert to visit the company, where he began an unofficial apprenticeship and at age 12 &quot;was allowed to ink a rush job, the pencils of Bob Montana&#x27;s [teen-humor feature] &quot;Archie&quot;&quot;. Author David Hajdu, who interviewed Kubert and other comics professionals for a 2008 book, reported, however, that, &quot;Kubert has told varying versions of the story of his introduction to the comics business at age ten, sometimes setting it at the comics shop run by Harry &quot;A&quot; Chesler, sometimes at MLJ; however, MLJ did not start operation until 1939, when Kubert was thirteen&quot;.

Kubert attended Manhattan&#x27;s High School of Music and Art. During this time he and classmate Norman Maurer, a future collaborator, would sometimes skip school in order to see publishers. Kubert began honing his craft at the Chesler studio, one of the comic-book packagers that had sprung up in the medium&#x27;s early days to supply outsourced comics to publishers.

==Career==
===Early career===
Kubert&#x27;s first known professional job was penciling and inking the six-page story &quot;Black-Out&quot;, starring the character Volton, in Holyoke Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Catman Comics&quot; #8 (March 1942; also listed as vol. 2, #13). He would continue drawing the feature for the next three issues, and was soon doing similar work for Fox Comics&#x27; &quot;Blue Beetle&quot;. Branching into additional art skills, he began coloring the Quality Comics reprints of future industry legend Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit&quot;, a seven-page comics feature that originally ran as part of a newspaper Sunday supplement.

===1940s and 1950s===
Kubert&#x27;s first work for DC Comics, where he would spend much of his career and produce some of his most notable art. Throughout the decade, Kubert&#x27;s art would appear in comics from Fiction House, Avon, and Harvey Comics, but he worked primarily for All-American and DC. Kubert&#x27;s long association with the Hawkman character began with the story &quot;A Hot Time in the Old Town&quot; in &quot;The Big All-American Comic Book&quot; (1944). Kubert drew several Hawkman stories in that title as well as in &quot;All Star Comics&quot;. He and Irwin Hasen drew the debut of the Injustice Society in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; #37 (Oct. 1947) in a tale written by Robert Kanigher. The Kanigher/Kubert team created the Thorn in &quot;Flash Comics&quot; #89 (Nov. 1947).

In the 1950s, he became managing editor of St. John Publications, where he, his old classmate Norman Maurer, and Norman&#x27;s brother, Leonard Maurer, produced the first 3-D comic books, starting with &quot;Three Dimension Comics&quot; #1 (Sept. 1953 oversize format, Oct. 1953 standard-size reprint), featuring Mighty Mouse. According to Kubert, it sold a remarkable 1.2 million copies at 25 cents apiece at a time when comics cost a dime.

At St. John, writer Norman Maurer and artist Kubert created the enduring character Tor, a prehistoric-human protagonist who debuted in the comic &quot;1,000,000 Years Ago&quot; (Sept. 1953). Tor immediately went on to star in &quot;3-D Comics&quot; #2-3 (Oct.-Nov. 1953), followed by a titular, traditionally 2-D comic-book series, written and drawn by Joe Kubert, that premiered with issue #3 (May 1954). The character has since appeared in series from Eclipse Comics, Marvel Comics&#x27; Epic imprint, and DC Comics through at least the 1990s. Kubert in the late 1950s unsuccessfully attempted to sell &quot;Tor&quot; as a newspaper comic strip. The &quot;Tor&quot; samples consisted of 12 daily strips, reprinted in six pages in &quot;Alter Ego&quot; vol. 3 #10 and later expanded to 16 pages in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;Tor&quot; #1. He contributed work to Avon Periodicals, where he did science-fiction stories for &quot;Strange Worlds&quot; and other titles.

For EC Comics, Kubert drew a few stories for Harvey Kurtzman&#x27;s &quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot; alongside EC stalwarts Wally Wood, Jack Davis, and John Severin.

===DC Comics and Sgt. Rock===
Beginning with &quot;Our Army at War&quot; #32 (March 1955), Kubert began to freelance again for DC Comics, in addition to Lev Gleason Publications and Atlas Comics, the 1950s iteration of Marvel Comics. By the end of the year he was drawing for DC exclusively. DC editor Julius Schwartz assigned Kubert, Robert Kanigher, and Carmine Infantino to the company&#x27;s first attempt at reviving superheroes: an updated version of the Flash that would appear in &quot;Showcase&quot; #4 (Oct. 1956). The eventual success of the new, science fiction-oriented Flash heralded the wholesale return of superheroes, and the beginning of what fans and historians call the Silver Age of Comic Books. In the coming years, Kubert would work on such characters as the medieval adventurer the Viking Prince and features starring Sgt. Rock and The Haunted Tank in the war comic &quot;G.I. Combat&quot;. He and writer Gardner Fox created a new version of Hawkman in &quot;The Brave and the Bold&quot; #34 (Feb.–March 1961) with the character receiving his own title three years later. Kubert&#x27;s work on Hawkman and Sgt. Rock would become known as his signature efforts. Kubert&#x27;s main collaborator on the war comics was writer/editor Kanigher. Their work together on Sgt. Rock is considered a memorable contribution to the comics medium. They introduced Enemy Ace in &quot;Our Army at War&quot; #151 (Feb. 1965).

From 1965 through 1967 he collaborated with author Robin Moore on the syndicated daily comic strip &quot;Tales of the Green Beret&quot; for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

Kubert served as DC Comics&#x27; director of publications from 1967 to 1976. He made the Unknown Soldier the lead feature of &quot;Star Spangled War Stories&quot; with issue #151 (June–July 1970) and initiated titles based on such Edgar Rice Burroughs properties as &quot;Tarzan&quot; and &quot;Korak&quot;. Comics historian Les Daniels noted that Kubert&#x27;s &quot;scripts and artwork ranked among the most authentic and effective ever seen.&quot; DC Comics writer and executive Paul Levitz stated in 2010 that &quot;Joe Kubert produced an adaptation that Burroughs aficionados could respect.&quot; Kubert edited a number of comic books for DC, including taking over as editor of &quot;Sgt. Rock&quot; and other military titles and editing &quot;Tarzan&quot; and other books based on Burroughs&#x27; characters. While performing supervisory duties he continued to draw for some books, notably &quot;Tarzan&quot; from 1972 to 1975 and drew covers and layouts for &quot;Rima the Jungle Girl&quot; from 1974 to 1975. He edited &quot;Limited Collectors&#x27; Edition&quot; #C–36 which features stories from the Book of Genesis adapted by writer Sheldon Mayer and artist Nestor Redondo. Kubert and Kanigher created Ragman in the first issue (Aug.–Sept. 1976) of that character&#x27;s short-lived ongoing series.

===The Kubert School===
The Joe Kubert School of Cartoon and Graphic Art was founded in September 1976 by Kubert and his wife Muriel in Dover, New Jersey&#x27;s old Baker mansion on 45 Lehigh Street; then, from 1984, in the former Dover high school, whose tall windows offered optimal lighting. Its first graduating class of 1978 included Stephen R. Bissette, Thomas Yeates, and Rick Veitch. Kubert taught a number of students who later became notable professionals, including Amanda Conner, Eric Shanower, Steve Lieber, and Scott Kolins.

In addition to The Kubert School, in the late 1990s, Kubert was offering &quot;Joe Kubert&#x27;s World of Cartooning&quot; correspondence courses to prospective students.

===Later career===
Kubert provided art for several anniversary issues of key DC titles. He and writer Paul Levitz crafted a Hawkman story in &quot;Detective Comics&quot; #500 (March 1981). Kubert was one of the artists on the double-sized &quot;Justice League of America&quot; #200 (March 1982) as well as &quot;Batman&quot; #400 (Oct. 1986).

He wrote and drew a collection of faith-based comic strips beginning in the late 1980s for Tzivos Hashem, the Lubavitch children&#x27;s organization, and &quot;Moshiach Times&quot; magazine. The stories, &quot;The Adventures of Yaakov and Isaac&quot;, were based on biblical references but were not Bible stories.

Kubert made a return to writing and drawing in 1991 with the Abraham Stone graphic novel &quot;Country Mouse, City Rat&quot; for Malibu Comics&#x27; Platinum Editions. He returned to the character for two more stories, &quot;Radix Malorum&quot; and &quot;The Revolution&quot; published by Epic Comics in 1995.

Also for Epic Comics, he delivered the four-issue &quot;Tor&quot; miniseries in 1993. &quot;Fax from Sarajevo&quot;, initially released as a 207-page hardcover book in 1996 and two years later as a 224-page trade paperback was published by Dark Horse Comics. The non-fiction book originated as a series of faxes from European comics agent Ervin Rustemagić during the Serbian siege of Sarajevo. Rustemagić and his family, whose home and possessions in suburban Dobrinja were destroyed, spent two-and-a-half years in a ruined building, communicating with the outside world via fax when they could. Friend and client Kubert was one recipient. Collaborating long-distance, they collected Rustemagić&#x27;s account of life during wartime, with Kubert and editor Bob Cooper turning the raw faxes into a somber comics tale.

Kubert drew the first issue of Stan Lee&#x27;s &quot;Just Imagine...&quot; limited series (2001) and two pencil-illustrated graphic novels, &quot;Yossel: April 19, 1943&quot; (2003) and &quot;Jew Gangster&quot; (2005), for IBooks. In 2003, Kubert returned to the Sgt. Rock character, illustrating &quot;Sgt. Rock: Between Hell and a Hard Place&quot;, a hardcover graphic novel written by Brian Azzarello. Kubert drew &quot;Tex, The Lonesome Rider&quot;, written by Claudio Nizzi and published by SAF Comics in 2005, and then wrote and drew &quot;Sgt. Rock: The Prophecy&quot;, a six-issue miniseries in 2006.
