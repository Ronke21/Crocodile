<text>Troilus and Criseyde () is an epic poem by Geoffrey Chaucer which re-tells in Middle English the tragic story of the lovers Troilus and Criseyde set against a backdrop of war during the siege of Troy. It was written in &quot;rime royale&quot; and probably completed during the mid-1380s. Many Chaucer scholars regard it as the poet&#x27;s finest work. As a finished long poem, it is more self-contained than the better known but ultimately unfinished &quot;The Canterbury Tales&quot;. This poem is often considered the source of the phrase: &quot;all good things must come to an end&quot; (3.615).

Although Troilus is a character from Ancient Greek literature, the expanded story of him as a lover was of Medieval origin. The first known version is from Benoît de Sainte-Maure&#x27;s poem &quot;Roman de Troie&quot;, but Chaucer&#x27;s principal source appears to have been Boccaccio, who re-wrote the tale in his &quot;Il Filostrato&quot;. Chaucer attributes the story to a &quot;Lollius&quot; (whom he also mentions in &quot;The House of Fame&quot;), although no writer with this name is known. Chaucer&#x27;s version can be said to reflect a less cynical and less misogynistic world-view than Boccaccio&#x27;s, casting Criseyde as fearful and sincere rather than simply fickle and having been led astray by the eloquent and perfidious Pandarus. It also inflects the sorrow of the story with humour.

The poem had an important legacy for later writers. Robert Henryson&#x27;s Scots poem &quot;The Testament of Cresseid&quot; imagined a rambunctious fate for Criseyde not given by Chaucer. In historical editions of the English &quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot;, Henryson&#x27;s distinct and separate work was sometimes included without accreditation as an &quot;epilogue&quot; to Chaucer&#x27;s tale. Other texts, for example, John Metham&#x27;s &quot;Amoryus and Cleopes&quot; (c. 1449), adapt language and authorship strategies from the famous predecessor poem. Shakespeare&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot;, although much darker in tone, was also based in part on the material.

&quot;Troilus and Criseyde&quot; are usually considered to be a courtly romance, although the generic classification is an area of significant debate in most Middle English literature. It is part of the Matter of Rome cycle, a fact which Chaucer emphasizes.

==Synopsis==
Calchas, a soothsayer, foresees the fall of Troy and abandons the city in favour of the Greeks; his daughter, Criseyde, receives some ill will on account of her father&#x27;s betrayal. Troilus, a warrior of Troy, publicly mocks love and is punished by the God of Love by being struck with irreconcilable desire for Criseyde, whom he sees passing through the temple. With the help of sly Pandarus, Criseyde&#x27;s uncle, Troilus and Criseyde begin to exchange letters. Eventually, Pandarus develops a plan to urge the two into bed together; Troilus swoons when he thinks the plan is going amiss, but Pandarus and Criseyde revive him. Pandarus leaves, and Troilus and Criseyde spend a night of bliss together.

Calchas eventually persuades the Greeks to exchange a prisoner of war, Antenor, for his daughter Criseyde. Hector, of Troy, objects; as does Troilus, although he does not voice his concern. Troilus speaks to Criseyde and suggests they elope but she offers a logical argument as to why it would not be practical. Criseyde promises to deceive her father and return to Troy after ten days; Troilus leaves her with a sense of foreboding. Upon arriving in the Greek camp, Criseyde realizes the unlikeliness of her being able to keep her promise to Troilus. She writes dismissively in response to his letters and on the tenth day accepts a meeting with Diomede, and listens to him speak of love. Later, she accepts him as a lover. Pandarus and Troilus wait for Criseyde: Pandarus sees that she will not return and eventually Troilus realizes this as well. Troilus curses Fortune, even more so because he still loves Criseyde; Pandarus offers some condolences. The narrator, with an apology for giving women a bad name, bids farewell to his book, and briefly recounts Troilus&#x27;s death in battle and his ascent to the eighth sphere, draws a moral about the transience of earthly joys and the inadequacy of paganism, dedicates his poem to John Gower and Strode, asks the protection of the Trinity, and prays that we be worthy of Christ&#x27;s mercy.

==Inspiration==
The &quot;Canticus Troili&quot; is a translation of Petrarch&#x27;s Sonnet 132 from &quot;Il Canzoniere&quot;.

Troilus&#x27; philosophical monologue in Book IV is from Boethius&#x27; &quot;Consolation of Philosophy&quot;, a book that was extremely influential to Chaucer.

<text>Turtle Bay is a neighborhood in New York City, on the east side of Midtown Manhattan. It extends from roughly 43rd Street to 53rd Street, and eastward from Lexington Avenue to the East River&#x27;s western branch (facing Roosevelt Island). The neighborhood is the site of the headquarters of the United Nations and the Chrysler Building. The Tudor City apartment complex is next to the southeast corner of Turtle Bay.

Turtle Bay is named after a former cove of the East River. The neighborhood was originally settled as a Dutch farm in the 17th century, and was subsequently developed with tenements, power plants, and slaughterhouses in the 19th century. These industrial structures were largely demolished in the 1940s and 1950s to make way for the United Nations headquarters. Today, Turtle Bay contains multiple missions and consulates to the nearby United Nations headquarters.

Turtle Bay is part of Manhattan Community District 6, and its primary ZIP Codes are 10017 and 10022. It is patrolled by the 17th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==History==
===Colonial days===
Turtle Bay, a cove of the East River, was between what is now 45th and 48th Streets and was fed by a stream that ran from the present-day intersection of Second Avenue and 48th Street. It was probably named after the turtles found in the area. Historical records from the 17th century described an abundance of turtles nearby, with local residents partaking in a &quot;turtle feast&quot;. 

The Turtle Bay neighborhood was originally a land grant given to two Englishmen by the Dutch colonial governor of New Amsterdam in 1639 and named &quot;Turtle Bay Farm&quot;. The farm extended roughly from what is now 40th to 49th Streets and from Third Avenue to the river. By 1712, &quot;Turtle Bay&quot; was frequently used in property documents for the area.

On a knoll overlooking the cove, near 41st Street, the farmhouse was purchased as a summer retreat by Francis Bayard, and in the early 19th century remained the summer villa of Francis Bayard Winthrop. Turtle Creek, or DeVoor&#x27;s Mill Creek as it was known, emptied into the cove at what is now 47th Street. To the south lay Kip&#x27;s Bay farm; to the north, on a bluff, stood James Beekman&#x27;s &quot;Mount Pleasant&quot;, the first of a series of houses and villas with water views stretching away up the shoreline. After the street grid system was initiated in Manhattan, the hilly landscape of the Turtle Bay Farm was graded to create cross-streets and the land was subdivided for residential development.

===Late 19th century===

An army enrollment office was established at Third Avenue and 46th Street, after the first Draft Act was passed during the American Civil War. On July 13, 1863, an angry mob burned the office to the ground and proceeded to riot through the surrounding neighborhood, destroying entire blocks. The New York Draft Riots continued for three days before army troops managed to contain the mob, which had burned and looted much of the city. The cove was filled in after the Civil War, serving as a valuable shelter from the often harsh weather on the river, and became a thriving site for shipbuilding.

After the war ended, the formerly pastoral neighborhood was developed with brownstones. By 1868 the bay had been entirely filled in by commercial overdevelopment, packed with breweries, gasworks, slaughterhouses, cattle pens, coal yards, and railroad piers. By the early 20th century, Turtle Bay was &quot;a riverside back yard&quot; for the city, as the &quot;WPA Guide to New York City&quot; (1939) described it: &quot;huge industrial enterprises—breweries, laundries, abattoirs, power plants—along the water front face squalid tenements not far away from new apartment dwellings attracted to the section by its river view and its central position. The numerous plants shower this district with the heaviest sootfall in the city—150 tons to the square mile annually&quot;.

The huge Waterside Station, a power plant operated by the Consolidated Edison Company, producing 367,000 kilowatts of electricity in its coal-fired plant, marked the southern boundary of the neighborhood. There were also of slaughterhouses along First Avenue. With an infusion of poor immigrants having had come in the later part of the 19th century, and the opening of the elevated train lines along Second and Third Avenues, the neighborhood went into decay with crumbling tenement buildings.

===20th and 21st centuries===
Many tenements were restored in the 1920s, and a large communal garden was established. Charlotte Hunnewell Sorchan saw promise in the run-down rowhouses of Turtle Bay. In 1918 she purchased twenty houses on 48th and 49th Streets between Second and Third Avenues; within two years she had renovated the enclave called Turtle Bay Gardens. An area between First and Second Avenues, and 41st and 43rd Streets was known as &quot;Goat Hill&quot;—goats and squatters ruled the area—and later renamed &quot;Prospect Hill&quot;. Prospect Hill developed into a shanty Irish community known as &quot;Corcoran&#x27;s Roost&quot;, founded by Jimmy Corcoran, in the 1850s, and later became known as a community with a high rate of violent crime and a haven for waterfront thieves such as the Rag Gang, during the late 19th century. From 1927 to 1932, the 2,800-unit Tudor City was built on this site, which was in 1988 named a historic district.

The clearing of the slaughterhouses for the construction of the UN headquarters in 1948, largely completed by 1952, and the removal of the elevated trains opened the neighborhood up for high-rise office buildings and condominiums. Concurrent with the UN headquarters&#x27; construction, the Ralph Bunche Park staircase was constructed, connecting Tudor City to the rest of Turtle Bay. Until the Third Avenue El was demolished in 1956, it was characterized by a blighted stretch of sooty darkness that had separated the neighborhood from Midtown Manhattan.

After the UN headquarters&#x27; expansion plan was originally announced in 2000, it was opposed by some Turtle Bay residents over concerns about the loss of the current Robert Moses Playground in order to build a long-sought new UN building on the site. In October 2011, city and state officials announced an agreement in which the UN would be allowed to build the tower adjacent to the existing campus on the current playground. In exchange, the United Nations would allow the construction of an esplanade along the East River that would complete the East River Greenway, a waterfront pedestrian and bicycle pathway. While host nation authorities have agreed to the provisions of the plan, it needs the approval of the United Nations in order to be implemented. The plan is similar in concept to an earlier proposal that had been announced in 2000 but did not move forward.

==Demographics==
For census purposes, the New York City government classifies Turtle Bay as part of a larger neighborhood tabulation area called Turtle Bay-East Midtown. Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Turtle Bay-East Midtown was 51,231, a change of 1,494 (2.9%) from the 49,737 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of . The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 77.1% (39,475) White, 2.1% (1,071) African American, 0% (23) Native American, 13% (6,655) Asian, 0% (21) Pacific Islander, 0.4% (184) from other races, and 1.6% (845) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.8% (2,957) of the population.

The entirety of Community District 6, which comprises Turtle Bay and Stuyvesant Town, had 53,120 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 84.8 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are adults: a plurality (45%) are between the ages of 25–44, while 22% are between 45–64, and 13% are 65 or older. The ratio of youth and college-aged residents was lower, at 7% and 12% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 6 was $112,383, though the median income in Turtle Bay individually was $135,360 In 2018, an estimated 10% of Turtle Bay and Stuyvesant Town residents lived in poverty, compared to 14% in all of Manhattan and 20% in all of New York City. One in twenty-five residents (4%) were unemployed, compared to 7% in Manhattan and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 42% in Turtle Bay and Stuyvesant Town, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 45% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Turtle Bay and Stuyvesant Town are considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying.

==Community==
To the north of Turtle Bay is Sutton Place, to the west is Midtown, and to the south are Tudor City and Murray Hill.

===Turtle Bay Association===
The Turtle Bay Association, a neighborhood non-profit 501(c)3 organization, was founded in 1957 by James Amster to protest, successfully, the widening of East 49th Street. It now serves as an advocate for residents of Turtle Bay, and maintains the neighborhood&#x27;s quality of life. The Association&#x27;s efforts have resulted in more park and landscaping development, creating the neighborhood&#x27;s tree-lined and relatively quiet atmosphere.

Aside from the main series, Kyo appears in several crossovers and spinoffs with other games. He is also the central title character of the manga &quot;The King of Fighters: Kyo&quot; and video game adaptation with the same name, which center around his daily life.

Kyo was created by Yuichiro Hiraki and Shinichi Morioka as a young hero who would fight the main characters from other SNK franchises, such as &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; with inspirations from several rebelious heroes, most notably the late singer Yutaka Ozaki. His debut in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; received a large positive response by fans, making Kyo return in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot;, where he was originally not available in early versions. His outfit was redesigned throughout the series; since his original appearance, featuring a high school uniform, became popular with fans, designers created clones of his original costume in later games. The same occurred with his moves, changing from a standard fighting character to mixed martial arts featuring his flames and a personal style of kenpō.

Video game journalists have praised Kyo&#x27;s design and fighting style as among the best of the series and in fighting games in general. His constant changes od designs and moves were praised and has stood out as one of the protagonists from the series. The character&#x27;s redesign in &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; earned mixed responses because of the differences from previous incarnations. Kyo&#x27;s role in printed media and other adaptations of the series has often been criticized, most notably in the live-action film. A variety of Kyo collectibles, including key chains and figurines, have been created.

==Conception and creation==
===Origin and influences===
In the making of the game &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot;, director Masanori Kuwasashi expressed pressure about creating a young lead who would clash with SNK veteran fighters but after talking producer Takashi Nishiyama, he thought it would be beneficial for sales. Kyo Kusanagi was created by SNK employee Yuichiro Hiraki and designed by artist Shinichi Morioka. When designing characters for the first &quot;King of Fighters&quot; game, developers wanted a new, &quot;snazzy&quot; hero who would fight against characters from two other SNK series, &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;. Through most of his development, Kyo was named and was dressed in martial arts clothing common in fighting games of the time. His design was inspired by the main character of Katsuhiro Otomo&#x27;s manga and film &quot;Akira&quot;, Shotaro Kaneda. Joe Yabuki from Ikki Kajiwara&#x27;s &quot;Ashita no Joe&quot; and Akira Fudo from Nagai&#x27;s &quot;Devilman&quot; manga series were influences in creating the character. Artist Nona said he found it difficult to design Kyo as a heroic character due to his dark traits, noting the character was also inspired by the darker Akira Fudo. Late in production, his name was changed to Kyo Kusanagi, as a means of relating the character to the &quot;Yamata no Orochi&quot; legend, which was the basis of the story arc of the series. The name Syo would later be used for Kyo&#x27;s Another Striker in &quot;The King of Fighters 2000&quot;. Another planned name before Syo was , but no design was elaborated from it. However, in the end, SNK chose the name Kyo as they felt it more fitting. Kyo&#x27;s pixel art was created by Hiraki, who, despite leaving SNK to work on another project a few years later, was asked by Capcom&#x27;s Kaname Fujioka to once again work on Kyo&#x27;s design for the crossover game &quot;Capcom vs. SNK: Millennium Fight 2000&quot;.

While in charge of designing the character, Hiraki sought to contrast Kyo with &quot;Street Fighter&quot; character Ryu, as he believed the latter was a popular character in international markets and that Kyo&#x27;s characterization and design could benefit from appealing to as broad a demographic as possible. Despite Kyo originally being depicted as a lazy young adult, he shows a notable character arc across the games: he develops a new fighting style on his own, which contrasts with his original concept of being born with talent. In contrast to Terry and Ryo, Kyo was given a natural life in his debut. However, the death of his father Saisyu at the hands of Rugal Bernstein was executed to make him more tragic and serious when it came to his training, leaving Japan in his ending to become stronger in future battles. The inclusion of the rival Iori Yagami and the revived Saisyu in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;95&quot; wree meant to give Kyo a more coherent story as the first game was written as a more all-star game. While Kyo&#x27;s girlfriend Yuki was also created by Morioka out of jealousy, Kuwasashi was against using her in a romantic scene, believing it would not fit the narrative. 

Kyo&#x27;s repeated appearances in every game in the series, at the insistence of SNK executives for marketing purposes, made story planning for each title challenging. Kyo and Iori were supposed to be removed due to business reasons after &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;98&quot;, but in the end, they have continued to appear ever since due to fans&#x27; demands. In the NESTS arc, Kyo is then involved in the story to some extent, but not Iori, in terms of the connections with the new protagonist K&#x27;. The developers of the series for &quot;The King of Fighters 2001&quot;, Eolith, noted that Kyo and Iori were also popular in their country, which led to their immediate inclusion in their game when compared with the two previous installments where they had no official teams and were hidden. In the &quot;Ash Saga&quot;, Kyo, Iori, and Chizuru&#x27;s Three Sacred Treasures play a major role in the story. The Miera brothers were the main focus of the &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; spin-offs, relegating Kyo and Iori to minor characters. Both the Ash arc and &quot;Maximum Impact&quot; games were developed at the same time, which resulted in Kyo and Iori still playing a major role in the &quot;Another Day&quot; original video animation that promotes &quot;Maximum Impact 2&quot;.

===Portrayal===

Kyo Kusanagi is introduced as a 19-year-old teenager who passes a year in high school in the next game. Unlike &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, time in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; never passes, resulting in Kyo always repeating a grade due to insufficient attendance in the Orochi arc. This is often referenced in game dialogue for comic relief, most notably in &quot;Maximum Impact&quot;. In his introduction, Kyo debuted as a slightly hot-blooded and somewhat egocentric character, but then the outline of the character gradually develops with the introduction of new protagonists that make him act more calm in comparison. By &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot;, Ureshino refers to Kyo and Shun&#x27;ei as the most mature protagonists in &quot;KOF&quot; history, which makes their interactions feel natural, especially because the former is looking after his successors. The theme song &quot;Esaka&quot;, often used in the franchise, was noted to reflect the character&#x27;s personality with revisions such as his cocky and upbeat side, while &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot; gives him another unique theme, &quot;Tears&quot;, meant to represent his depressed state in the NESTS arc due to having been kidnapped and cloned by the title antagonists. While Kyo and Benimaru&#x27;s relationship was initially that of rivals, it eventually became like that of siblings, with Benimaru acting as the older one as he was heavily overshadowed by Iori. The romance between Kyo and Yuki remains stable across the franchise, leading Ureshino to call them a married couple in &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot;.

The rivalry between Kyo and Iori resulted in game designer Eisuke Ogura claiming despite having the two characters having differences, they still have respect for each other, making their team-ups with fellow Sacred Treasure Team member Chizuru Kagura to defeat a common enemy feel natural. Ureshino noted the rivalry between Kyo and Iori stood out early in the 1990s because it was weird to see characters interacting before a fight started. &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot; added a subtext of happiness of the two rivals meeting again, believing they had died when fighting Orochi. Their exchanges in &quot;The King of Fighters XI&quot;, where they remained in a far more experienced relationship, are as if the two now teammates seek fighting to kill their boredom. However, Ureshino does not see the idea of Iori developing his social skills as it would ruin the appeal he has with Kyo as well as the charm he has on his own.

Kyo&#x27;s Japanese voice actor Masahiro Nonaka was first called to work in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;94&quot; after meeting sound designer Yasumasa Yamada. When first reading of the game, Nonaka had poor impressions of his work, as he believed it would not be as appealing as other SNK IPs. Nonaka was inspired by rock singer Yutaka Ozaki, as he was impressed by his rebellious personality, who appealed to Japanese people by writing inspiring lyrics for his songs. Seeing the similarities between Ozaki and Kyo&#x27;s personalities, Nonaka wanted the latter to be like Ozaki. Despite the actor&#x27;s early negative impressions, Nonaka&#x27;s performance was notoriously well received, as he recalls having several fanletters involving several lines he made the character say, to the point Kyo became a more popular character than those from &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; and &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;. Nonaka related to his character as being young and reckless until he &quot;grew up&quot; in his later appearances. He then expressed some difficulty accepting Kyo on the same level. Nonaka befriended Iori&#x27;s actor Kunihiko Yasui and both noted that despite fans wanting their characters to become friendlier with each other, it did not appear to happen with Nonaka claiming that seems to be more common in action anime.

Tomoaki Maeno replaced Nonaka for &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; and said he was putting in all his efforts and expected the fandom to enjoy his work as the new voice of Kyo. Maeno noted the impact of Kyo was challenging as he was the main character from a famous series of fighting games. He often played the demo of &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; as Kyo in order to fully appreciate the character. For &quot;The King of Fighters for Girls&quot;, Maeno was careful with his performance as he understood how beloved his character is. He was careful in his songs and took a liking to the catchphrase &quot;Moetaro?&quot; (Got burned?). Yuichi Nakamura portrayed Kyo in a commercial promoting the cellphone game &quot;The King of Fighters All Stars&quot;.

===Designs===

Several of the series&#x27; designers said Kyo is one of the most difficult characters to illustrate because of his popularity. Artist Falcoon states that Kyo has a strong attitude, making him one of the hardest characters to illustrate. As the &quot;face&quot; of &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, Kyo&#x27;s sprites were made by Toyohisa Tanabe, who aimed to be careful in designing him. In contrast to the other fighting game characters featured in &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;, Kyo was given a more realistic and stylish look, as Tanabe found the others too cartoony. Artist Hiroaki Hashimoto expressed a desire for his work to live up to Shinkiro&#x27;s, which he said left a great impression on him.

In his first appearances, Kyo wears a modified version of his school uniform with a sun mark that represents his heritage of the Kusanagi. For the NESTS story arc starting in &quot;KOF &#x27;99&quot;, Kyo wears a new outfit said to be made by the character himself in an attempt to be more casual, though Neo Freak writers claim he stole it from the same cartel that kidnapped him. The staff claimed fans enjoyed the design for how fashionable it was and how distinctive Kyo was still without his school uniform. In contrast to the fashionable designs, in &quot; Shinsetsu Samurai Spirits Bushidō Retsuden&quot;, Kyo wears his father&#x27;s green-themed traditional martial artist outfit with prayer beads around his neck while keeping his original bandana with the Kusanagi crest. Falcoon redesigned Kyo&#x27;s clothes for the spin-off game &quot;&quot;; his jacket was redesigned while keeping the appeal of the original costume. His &quot;Normal Color F&quot; attire is similar to his father&#x27;s martial arts clothing. The outfit called &quot;Color G&quot; is reminiscent of the costume design of Yuki, the popular protagonist of &quot;NeoGeo Battle Coliseum&quot;. 

&quot;The King of Fighters 2003&quot; sees Kyo sporting a new outfit with a focus on belts and classical gloves. The Kusanagi Sun sign still remains in Kyo&#x27;s leather jacket. In &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot; and &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;, Iori and Kyo were meant to wear new outfits that emphasized their sexual appeal, but due to time constraints, they were removed. As a result, they sport similar outfits to the ones seen in the Ash ars. While Kyo often wears different outfits for each game&#x27;s story mode, he was given a more masculine appearance for &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot; while staying true to his &quot;2003&quot; outfit. Artist Ogura expressed pressure when designing this incarnation of the character, saying it had to live up to an enduring reputation. A design similar to his classic one labeled &quot;Another Style&quot; was featured in &quot;KOF Chronicles&quot; set before &quot;KOF &#x27;94&quot; but without the bandana for mobile games. However, the character was noteworthy for showing a new, unique technique.

With designers believing he had become a more traditional fighter, they gave him a simpler, more modern appearance for &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;. Character designer Nobuyuki Kuroki said the staff wanted to captivate new fans with Kyo&#x27;s larger design regardless of negative backlash. Producer Yasuyuki Oda noted that while researching new characters for &quot;KOF XIV&quot;, Kyo&#x27;s moves avoided stereotypes like Japanese sumo wrestlers to produce more variety within the cast. His appearance in &quot;KOF XV&quot; was altered to resemble his previous appearance while altering other parts of his design, like his jacket and gloves.

===Fighting style===
The game&#x27;s developers decided Kyo&#x27;s main abilities would be fire-based, inspired by the manga and anime &quot;Getter Robo&quot; Go Nagai and Ken Ishikawa. The elements and the personalities were also a homage to a Japanese phrase about giving birth to fire: &quot;lightning strikes the earth which sparks the flame&quot;. In his debut, Kyo fights with the , attacking opponents using flames and several hits from his limbs. This was developed by animator Mitsuo Kodama. Kyo was created originally as an all-rounder with a projectile, , an easily used anti-air move, being SNK&#x27;s answer to Ryu&#x27;s Hadoken among other famous projectile techniques seen in fighting games. Several other moves were renamed during game development coming from simple styles to more elaborated. Kyo&#x27;s signature Desperation Move is the , a massive slash of fire he creates with one hand. The staff worked to incorporate this move into the game carefully, trying to make it as realistic as possible while using enhanced special effects. The Orochinagi was conceptualized as the move Kyo would use to defeat the demon known as Yamata no Orochi. This was given a mid-air variation for &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;; designers kept in mind the concept of coolness and the small difficulty in performing it.

Starting in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot;, Kyo has mixed martial artists involving the Kusanagi style and a personal style of kenpō. This was changed as part of the series&#x27; overhaul to make Kyo&#x27;s character more unique, removing his projectile in favor of hand-to-hand combat. He was also given a new move known as the , where he grabs an enemy with his hands and releases flames to knock them out. SNK specifically gave Kyo this move to note the protagonist&#x27;s constant training to reveal that Kyo likes training despite his claims of hating effort. Kyo&#x27;s gameplay was modified again for &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot; onwards with Kyo doing variations of his father&#x27;s moves again like the flaming punches.

In &quot;The King of Fighters XII&quot;, Kyo&#x27;s moves were modified to those from the first two games of the series to rely on his projectile. Kyo&#x27;s Neo Max from &quot;XIII&quot; technique, the , in which he covers the enemies with walls of fire, was the first move of this category to be made for &quot;KOF XIII&quot;. The DLC &quot;NESTS Kyo&quot; focuses on his kenpō. SNK ensured neither Kyo version would be superior to the other. Besides retaining the Orochinagi, NESTS Kyo has the , a move where he consecutively punches the enemy while adding increasing flame damage to each strike originally used in &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot;. His Neo Max is a new technique named , which covers the entire screen in flames. For &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot;, Oda wanted to keep his gameplay intact in order to avoid fan backlash, using hand-to-hand combat.

====In &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;====
Kyo is the head of the Kusanagi clan who can create fire. Several years before the games, the Kusanagi and Yasakani clans were allies, but the latter&#x27;s jealousy over the former&#x27;s fame led the Yasakani to make a pact with the snake demon Orochi. Since then, the clans have had a generation-long grudge with casualties on both sides. Kyo&#x27;s rivalry with the Yasakani descendant Iori Yagami is one of mutual hatred rather than history. In the first &quot;King of Fighters&quot; video game, Kyo stars in the famous fighting tournament as the leader of the Japan Team with Benimaru Nikaido and Goro Daimon. They become champions and defeat the host, Rugal Bernstein, who has killed Kyo&#x27;s father, Saisyu. Kyo goes on a training quest in the aftermath. In the next title, the Japan Team faces Rugal again, who has revived and brainwashed Saisyu in revenge.

For &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;96&quot;, Kyo trains alone to defeat the follower of Orochi, Goenitz, who defeated him. The tournament&#x27;s host, Chizuru Kagura, wants Kyo and Iori on her team to help defeat Orochi, eventually taking down its follower Goenitz together. In &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot;, Kyo faces Orochi&#x27;s remaining followers, the New Faces Team, who aim to revive Orochi by sacrificing Kyo&#x27;s girlfriend, Yuki.

If the player has accrued enough points, Kyo can be faced in a bonus fight, swearing revenge against NESTS. He continues his fight alone in &quot;The King of Fighters 2000&quot;, but in the next game, he reunites with his old teammates and his self-proclaimed student Shingo Yabuki to make a comeback on the Japan Team.

In &quot;The King of Fighters 2003&quot;, Kyo and Iori join Chizuru&#x27;s to investigate Orochi seal but it is revealed the latter is being manipulated by agents Botan and Mukai from Those From The Past who seek the demon&#x27;s power. Following Mukai&#x27;s group escape, Chizuru is ambushed by the fighter Ash Crimson, who steals her powers enraging her teammates. In &quot;The King of Fighters XI&quot;, Kyo and Iori again form a team with Shingo to avenge Chizuru but Ash steals Iori&#x27;s power when he goes out of control. The PlayStation 2 port added an alternative version of Kyo that has his NESTS saga moves. In &quot;King of Fighters XII&quot;, Kyo is a playable character, but he does not have a team. Kyo reunites with the original members of the Esaka Team in &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot;.

Additionally, an alternative version of himself with different moves called &quot;NESTS Style Kyo&quot; is available as downloadable content. Kyo returns in &quot;The King of Fighters XIV&quot; with his old comrades. at Saisyu&#x27;s request of his father to meet Tung Fu Rue&#x27;s students who need help controlling their supernatural powers, and resealing a weak revived Orochi in the aftermath. Chizuru once again reunites the rivals in &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot; to protect the seal and eventually taking different paths with Kyo reuniting with Yuki.

Kyo appears in multiple spin-offs like &quot;The King of Fighters: Kyo&quot;, in which he travels around the world to prepare for the King of Fighters tournament until the events of &quot;KOF &#x27;97&quot;. This game reveals events of Kyo&#x27;s personal life, like his life with Yuki how he replaces his cousin Souji as the Kusanagi representative after he was cursed by Orochi&#x27;s blue flames in a fight with Iori. &quot;The King of Fighters R-1&quot; again reprises the events of &quot;KOF &#x27;97&quot;.

===In other media===
Aside from the main series, Kyo has appeared in other media from &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; series. In the anime &quot;The King of Fighters: Another Day&quot;, he is featured prominently in the fourth chapter as Ash Crimson stages a fight against Alba Miera, both of whom are stopped by Iori. A number of image songs and audio dramas featuring Kyo, including the contents of his own character-image album consisting of a number of his theme songs, have been released.

Kyo also appears in printed adaptations like manhua and light novels. Andy Seto also wrote a prequel that shows how Kyo turned into a fighter, met his girlfriend Yuki, and befriended Benimaru and Daemon. &quot;The King of Fighters: Zillion&quot; created by Andy Seto tells Kyo and Iori&#x27;s story between their fight against Orochi until the one against NESTS with the Hakkeshu reviving to have a man named Jean become the Orochi vessel, only to be defeated by the duo.

==Reception==
===Promotion and merchandise===
In 2020, SNK held the pop-up shop event &quot;Kyo Kusanagi Exhibition&quot;, hosted by Indoor Co., Ltd. in Akihabara, which presented to the audience with merchandising featuring the image of the character. Two scale figures based on Kyo&#x27;s original form and his &quot;XIV&quot; look have also been released by Gantaku. In November 2024, Tanita made an official collaboration with SNK, which involved merchandising and studying the bodies of Kyo, among other characters from the series. Kyo also gained appeal thanks to the &quot;Capcom vs. SNK&quot; series, which helped to make a striking rivalry between him and Ryu from &quot;Street Fighter&quot;. This led to his image being used for &quot;Capcom VS SNK 2&quot; on a cross-platform in a Japanese printed ad for that alongside Ryu. Although Kyo&#x27;s story arc ends with &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;97&quot;, he has remained a more popular hero than his successors like Ash Crimson in Western regions, which led to Ignition Entertainment promoting &quot;KOF XII&quot; using him.

===Critical response===
Kyo Kusanagi has received major praise ever since his introduction. In the book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;, Kyo is regarded as the most iconic character from &quot;The King of Fighters&quot;. Although the first &quot;King of Fighters&quot; game promoted the possibility of fights between &quot;Fatal Fury&quot; and &quot;Art of Fighting&quot; characters, &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Hobby Consolas&quot; regarded Kyo as the most popular character from the game, calling him the &quot;best star&quot; in the franchise. Joan Arnedo Moreno and Jordi Duch Gavaldà from Universitat Oberta de Catalunya said Kyo was one of the biggest figures in gaming next to Terry, Ryu, and Goku which inspired a fictional Cadillac for a video game titled &quot;CarOut!&quot;. &quot;Den of Geek&quot; said that while Kyo was introduced as a weak main character, as a result of the pressure of the series also using Terry Bogard and Ryo Sakazaki—heroes from other SNK&#x27;s series—by the climax of the Orochi arc he becomes more appealing due to his role in this part and his new movesets. When it comes to the narrative, the formation of the new Sacred Treasure Team was noted to be a proper conclusion to the Orochi story arc and the character. In &quot;Futabanet&quot;, Kyo&#x27;s character was given as one of the reasons &quot;The King of Fighters&quot; became listed as the fifth best fighting game franchise in Japan, standing out far more than popular recurring fighters &quot;Fatal Fury&quot;, &quot;Art of Fighting&quot;, and &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot;, among others. Similarly, &quot;Anime UK News&quot; preferred him more than the next lead, Shun&#x27;ei. In retrospect, while &quot;Kotaku&quot; recalls Kyo as the most heroic character in the series considering his role in the Orochi arc where he faces enemies with both the Hero Team and Sacred Treasures, him being replaced by other new protagonists was found to be coherent according to &quot;Kotaku&quot; and &quot;Polygon&quot;, as noted by how future story arcs tend to use other leads in the games&#x27; covers.

In &quot;Big Movements or Small Motions: Controlling Digital Avatars with Single-Camera Motion Capture&quot;, Kyo&#x27;s performance in &quot;The King of Fighters XIII&quot; was picked as a digital avatar to control for people due to his iconic popularity, as players controlling him were given immersion in the fighting game. Successfully recreating Kyo&#x27;s special moves, or the Desperation Move Orochinagi, was noted to leave a sense of satisfaction in the players. However, there are still several complex tactics the character is given that might result in stress to the player despite retaining a notable challenge factor. Critics liked his special moves enough to be one of the most dominant, most notably his &quot;Orochinagi&quot;, whereas others preferred his kenpō moves over his original projectile style. 

&quot;The Daily Star&quot; noted that although Kyo and Iori begin as enemies, they become allies in later games, leading to their popularity with The Gaemr referring to them as one of the greatest rivalries in gaming.. On the other hand, Kyo and Iori&#x27;s initial relationship, as shown in the visual novel &quot;The King of Fighters: Kyo&quot;, was seen as meanspirited by &quot;HardcoreGaming&quot;, as the latter stalked every one of the former&#x27;s allies, which could ruin the player&#x27;s improvements if Kyo fails to defeat Iori in the visual novel. Meanwhile, though Yuki and Shingo Yabuki accompany Kyo in his journey, the website writer, Kurt Kalata, lamented that Yuki does not provide much content to the story despite being Kyo&#x27;s girlfriend. When it comes to Kyo&#x27;s and Iori&#x27;s alliance in &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot;, &quot;DualShockers&quot; praised their team up as the Sacred Treasure Team for bringing further depths to their characterizations seen originally in the Orochi arc. &quot;ItMedia&quot; noted that Kyo&#x27;s original personality was changed from rude to formal in the &quot;SNK All-Stars&quot;, even when addressing his teammate Goro Daimon, with whom he has been a close friend ever since the first game. This was further reflected in the gamer&#x27;s point of view, something which the website could be a poor translation from the original mobile game.

There was commentary about Kyo&#x27;s design, with SNK artist Falcoon saying he believes Kyo appealed to gamers in the 1990s because of his appearance and fashion style. The character is notorious for his cool personality and looks that helped to promote the otome game &quot;The King of Fighters For Girls&quot;, according to &quot;AnimeAnime&quot;. The book &quot;Gaming Cultures and Place in Asia-Pacific&quot; noting his popularity in Hong Kong from the mid-1990s onwards as his outfit resulted in several cosplayers. This was especially notable as the character outshined &quot;Street Fighter&quot; characters who are instead more popular in Western regions. The character&#x27;s next designs were praised with RPGFan acclaiming &quot;The King of Fighters &#x27;99&quot; as one of the best from the year of its debut, and his &quot;King of Fighters 2003&quot; outfit also received a similar response. On the other hand, Kyo received a negative response for his &quot;King of Fighters XIV&quot; design, as it was not faithful to the original. In response to the negative feedback, artist Hiroaki Hashimoto said that while Kyo&#x27;s and Iori&#x27;s original designs in the Orochi arc were so appealing, it was hard for SNK to keep coming up with quality with &quot;XIV&quot;. As a result, his more nostalgic version in &quot;The King of Fighters XV&quot; was met with a better response from the media.

&quot;Anime News Network&quot; expressed disappointment that Kyo was not picked as a SNK representative character in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, as he had few guest appearances in comparison to Terry Bogard. Dexerto wanted him &quot;Smash&quot; due to his gameplay being able to properly match other video game icons. IGN enjoyed the character enough to want him playable in Namco&#x27;s fighting game &quot;Tekken 8&quot; based on fellow character Geese Howard&#x27;s inclusion in the previous game &quot;Tekken 7&quot;. Kyo&#x27;s live-action portrayal was the subject of negative focus due to the incorrect heritage Sean Faris has.

<text>The Colonial Life Arena is a multi-purpose arena in Columbia, South Carolina, primarily home to the University of South Carolina men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. Opened as a replacement for the Carolina Coliseum with the name Carolina Center in 2002, the 18,000-seat arena is also host to various events, including conferences, concerts, and graduation ceremonies. It is the largest arena in the state of South Carolina and the eighth largest campus college arena.

The naming rights were acquired in 2003 by Unum, a Portland, Maine–based insurance company, and it was renamed to the Colonial Center after the Colonial Life &amp; Accident Insurance Company, a Unum subsidiary headquartered in Columbia. On July 22, 2008, the USC board approved renaming the building to the Colonial Life Arena as part of the rebranding by Unum (which by then had moved to Chattanooga, Tennessee) of Colonial Life &amp; Accident as Colonial Life.

==History and use==

The arena first opened on November 22, 2002, with the season opener of the South Carolina women&#x27;s basketball team. A near sell-out crowd of 17,712 fans saw the 72–58 Gamecocks victory over in-state rival Clemson, with a $1 admission charge, at that time commonly used by the women&#x27;s basketball team to promote major games. The official grand opening took place December 2, 2002. The men&#x27;s basketball team defeated Temple 66–47. On January 26, 2010 South Carolina defeated #1 ranked and undefeated Kentucky 68–62 in the arena, one of the biggest wins in South Carolina history.

On January 18, 2021, as part of the university&#x27;s observance of Martin Luther King Day, the university dedicated a statue of Gamecocks great and 2020 WNBA MVP A&#x27;ja Wilson near the arena&#x27;s main entrance.

Aside from Gamecock basketball, the Colonial Life Arena also hosts the South Carolina High School Basketball Championships each year. The facility is built to also host ice hockey games, and was intended to be the new home of the ECHL&#x27;s Columbia Inferno. However, due to legal issues with the funding for the facility, the Inferno never played there. The franchise suspended operations in 2008, but after plans for a new arena in neighboring Lexington County fell through, the franchise was finally canceled in 2014.

The Colonial Life Arena was ranked 22nd in the world in ticket sales in 2003. It was also ranked the #1 arena in the Carolinas and was the #2 rated university arena in the world in 2005, based on ticket sales for touring shows.

It is managed by Spectra (formerly Global Spectrum), the facilities management subsidiary of Comcast Spectacor. The NBA&#x27;s Philadelphia 76ers, then owned by Comcast Spectacor, played an exhibition game in the venue in October 2005.

In 2007, it was home to the Columbia Stingers of the National Indoor Football League. The arena has hosted the Charlotte Bobcats and New York Knicks in the past.

Originally, the venue, like all Comcast-Spectator managed facilities, had its own ticketing policy, and therefore concerts were not controlled by the major ticketing industry firms.

Ticketing was provided by New Era Tickets, and tickets could be purchased through the Arena&#x27;s website.

Ticketing for events at the arena is now provided through Ticketmaster.

<doc id="855283" wikidata="Q5265711" url="?curid=855283" title="Dossie Easton">
<text>Dorothy &quot;Dossie&quot; Easton (born February 26, 1944), who has also written under the name Scarlet Woman, is an American author and family therapist based in San Francisco, California.

==Education and career==
Easton is a non-fiction author and poet. She has been a plenary or keynote speaker at many conferences, including conferences of the American Association of Sex Educators, Counselors and Therapists (AASECT), the Society for the Scientific Study of Sex, and the University of Hamburg.

Easton has given presentations at many colleges and universities, including University of California, Santa Cruz; Bryn Mawr College; University of California, Berkeley; Mills College; Pomona College; and San Francisco State University.

Her B.A. is from New College of California, 1975; MA in Education and Counseling from University of San Francisco, 1989; Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist, 1991, USF. Her bachelor&#x27;s thesis was titled &quot;Sex is Nice and Pleasure is Good for You.&quot; She worked at the Haight Ashbury Free Clinic Psych Annex in 1968 as a psychedelic crisis guide, and she worked with San Francisco Sex Information for several years, beginning in 1972. She had a radio show on sexuality on KPOO San Francisco from 1973 to 1975 called &quot;Get in Touch&quot;, as Mandy Jenkins. She has worked in battered women&#x27;s centers and mental health clinics in Santa Cruz, Sunnyvale, and San Francisco.

She was a member of the first board of directors of the Society of Janus in 1974, and is a life member. She is an inductee of the Society of Janus Hall of Fame. She also is or has been a member of other well-known BDSM organizations such as The Outcasts, Exiles, and Black Leather Wings, a radical faerie group.

In 1969, Easton made the decision never to enter into a monogamous relationship again. Her books have been cited as fundamental to the polyamory movement.

Dossie Easton has been a dedicated provider of authentic, compassionate, and respectful psychotherapy and relationship counseling for individuals exploring non-traditional lifestyles since 1962. In a 2023 talk on love, sex, polyamory, and kink, Easton said that ‘those people who live in a world of limitations and fears are missing out on so much that is possible’. The statement emphasizes the idea that there is so much more to life than what can be perceived within the confines of fear and self-imposed limitations. It encourages individuals to challenge their fears and embrace a mindset that embraces possibilities and personal expansion.

==Personal life==
Easton is polyamorous and lives in West Marin, California.

<text>The Little Duck River is a tributary of the Duck River of Tennessee in the United States. Via the Duck, Tennessee, and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. It rises in a poorly drained, swampy area southeast of Manchester, Tennessee and winds through the town.

Its significance is primarily in its spectacular confluence with the main Duck River, just northwest of downtown Manchester in Old Stone Fort State Park. Both streams descend over a series of dramatic cascades just prior to the confluence, which occurs at the base of a table land which they surround on three sides. The perimeter of this table land is surrounded by a low stone wall generally in height.

<doc id="855296" wikidata="Q822279" url="?curid=855296" title="Nuer people">
<text>The Nuer people are a Nilotic ethnic group concentrated in the Greater Upper Nile region of South Sudan. They also live in the Ethiopian region of Gambella. The Nuer speak the Nuer language, which belongs to the Nilotic language family. They are the second-largest ethnic group in South Sudan and the largest ethnic group in Gambella, Ethiopia. The Nuer people are pastoralists who herd cattle for a living. Their cattle serve as companions and define their lifestyle. The Nuer call themselves &quot;Naath&quot;.

==Overview==

The Nuer people have historically been undercounted because of the semi-nomadic lifestyle. They also have a culture of counting only older members of the family. For example, the Nuer believe that counting the number of cattle one has could result in misfortune and prefer to report fewer children than they have. Their South Sudan counterparts are the Horn peninsula&#x27;s westernmost Horners.

==History==
The Nuer people are said to have originally been a section of the Dinka people that migrated out of the Gezira south into a barren dry land that they called &quot;Kwer Kwong&quot;, which was in southern Kordofan. Centuries of isolation and influence from Luo peoples caused them to be a distinct ethnic group from the Naath. The arrival of the Baggara and their subsequent slave raids in the late 1700s caused the Nuer to migrate from southern Kordofan into what is now Bentiu. In around 1850, further slave raids as well as flooding and overpopulation caused them to migrate even further out of Bentiu and eastwards all the way into the western fringes of Ethiopia, displacing and absorbing many Dinka, Anyuak and Burun in the process.

British colonial expansion in the region during the 19th century greatly halted the Nuers&#x27; aggressive territorial expansion against the Dinka and Anyuak.

There are different accounts of the origin of the conflict between the Nuer and the Dinka, South Sudan&#x27;s two largest ethnic groups. Anthropologist Peter J. Newcomer suggests that the Nuer and Dinka are actually similar. He argues that hundreds of years of population growth created expansion, which eventually led to raids and wars.

In 2006 the Nuer and Murle were the tribes that resisted disarmament most strongly; members of the Nuer White Army, a group of armed youths often autonomous from tribal elders&#x27; authority, refused to lay down their weapons, which led SPLA soldiers to confiscate Nuer cattle, destroying their economy. The White Army was finally put down in mid-2006, though a successor organization self-styling itself as a White Army formed in 2011 to fight the Murle tribe (see 2011–2012 South Sudan tribal clashes), as well as the Dinka and UNMISS.

==Culture==
Cattle have historically been of the highest symbolic, religious and economic value to the Nuer. Sharon Hutchinson writes that &quot;among Nuer people the difference between people and cattle was continually underplayed.&quot; Cattle are particularly important in their role as bride wealth, where they are given by a husband&#x27;s lineage to his wife&#x27;s lineage. This exchange of cattle ensures that the children will be considered to belong to the husband&#x27;s lineage. The classical Nuer institution of ghost marriage, in which a man can &quot;father&quot; children after his death, is based on this definition of relations of kinship and descent by cattle exchange. In their turn, cattle given over to the wife&#x27;s patrilineage enable the male children of that patrilineage to marry and thereby ensure the continuity of her patrilineage. An infertile woman can even take a wife of her own, whose children, biologically fathered by men from other unions, then become members of her patrilineage, and she is legally and culturally their father, allowing her to metaphorically participate in reproduction.

=== Cattle ===
Nuer life revolves around cattle, which has made them pastoralist, but they are known to sometimes resort to horticulture as well, especially when their cattle are threatened by disease. Due to seasonal harsh weather, the Nuer move around to ensure that their livelihood is safe. They tend to travel when heavy seasons of rainfall come to protect the cattle from hoof disease, and when resources for the cattle are scarce. British anthropologist E. E. Evans-Pritchard wrote, &quot;They depend on the herds for their very existence...Cattle are the thread that runs through Nuer institutions, language, rites of passage, politics, economy, and allegiances.&quot;

The Nuer are able to structure their entire culture around cattle and still have what they need. Before development, the Nuer used every single piece of cattle to their advantage. According to Evans-Pritchard, cattle helped evolve the Nuer culture into what it is today. They shaped the Nuer&#x27;s daily duties, as they dedicate themselves to protecting the cattle. For example, each month they blow air into their cattle&#x27;s rectums to relieve or prevent constipation. Cattle are no good to the Nuer if constipated because they are restricted from producing primary resources that families need to survive. Evans-Pritchard wrote, &quot;The importance of cattle in Nuer life and thought is further exemplified in personal names.&quot; They form their children&#x27;s names from the biological features of the cattle.

Evans-Pritchard wrote, &quot;I have already indicated that this obsession—for such it seems to an outsider is due not only to the great economic value of cattle but also to the fact that they are links in numerous social relationships.&quot; All their raw materials come from cattle, including drums, rugs, clothing, spears, shields, containers, and leather goods. Even daily essentials like toothpaste and mouthwash are created from the cattle&#x27;s dung and urine. The dung is chopped into pieces and left out to harden, then used for containers, toothpaste, or even to protect the cattle themselves by burning it to produce more smoke, keeping insects away to prevent disease.

The Nuer people never eat cattle just because they want to. Cattle are very sacred to them, therefore when they do eat cattle they honor its ghost. They typically just eat the cattle that are up in age or dying because of sickness. But even if they do so, they all gather together to perform rituals, dances, or songs before and after they slaughter the cattle. Never do they just kill cattle for the fun of it. &quot;Never do Nuer slaughter animals solely because of the desire to eat meat. There is the danger of the ox’s spirit visiting a curse on any individual who would slaughter it without ritual intent, aiming only to use it for food. Any animal that dies of natural causes is eaten&quot;. Many times it may not even just be cattle that they consume, it could be any animal they have scavenged upon that has died because of natural causes. There are a few other food sources that are available for the Nuer to consume. The Nuer diet primarily consists of fish and millet. &quot;Their staple crop is millet.&quot; Millet is formally consumed as porridge or beer. The Nuer turn to this staple product in seasons of rainfall when they move their cattle up to the higher ground. They might also turn to millet when the cattle are performing well enough to support their family.

In the 1990s, Sharon Hutchinson returned to Nuerland to update Evans-Pritchard&#x27;s account. She found that the Nuer had placed strict limits on the convertibility of money and cattle in order to preserve the special status of cattle as objects of bride wealth exchange and as mediators to the divine. She also found that as a result of endemic warfare with the Sudanese state, guns had acquired much of the symbolic and ritual importance previously held by cattle.

=== Kinship ===

To a Nuer individual, his parents and siblings are not considered mar (blood relatives) kin. He doesn&#x27;t refer to them as kin. To him they are considered gol which is far more intimate and significant. There are kinship categories in the Nuer society. Those categories depend on the payment to them. There is a balance between the mother and father&#x27;s side that is acknowledged through particular formal occasions such as marriage.

Nuer girls usually marry at 17 or 18. If a young girl gets engaged at an early age, the wedding and consummation ceremonies are essentially delayed. Women generally give birth to their first children when they are mature enough to bear them. As long as a girl marries a man with cattle, she is able to freely choose her husband, however her parents may choose a spouse for her.

==== Kinship roles ====

Kinship among the Nuer is very important to them, they refer to their blood relatives as &quot;gol&quot;. Kinship within the Nuer is formed off of one&#x27;s neighbors or their entire culture. During E. E. Evans-Pritchard&#x27;s ethnographic observation, he described the role of kinship as: &quot;Kinship obligations include caring for the children of one’s kin and neighbors. He also observed that, &quot;The network of kinship ties which links members of local communities is brought about by the operation of exogamous rules, often stated in terms of cattle.&quot; This is never thought to be the sole responsibility of the child&#x27;s parents.&quot; Cattle are judged by how much milk they can produce which is a necessity in their culture. If possible they create the excess of milk into cheese. But if a family’s herd cannot produce the amount of milk a family needs then they turn to others around them to give them what they need. It’s seen as their responsibility to step in and help the family since it’s not really their fault on how much their cattle can produce. The entire Nuer society is basically watching after each other, for example, as Evans-Pritchard noted that, &quot;When one household has a surplus, it is shared with neighbors. Amassing wealth is not an aim. Although a man who owns a large herd of cattle may be envied, his possession of numerous animals does not garner him any special privilege or treatment&quot;. In this tribe there is no special treatment for how one is treated because of their abundance in cattle. Just because one might have more cattle than another doesn&#x27;t mean they have a higher prestige. If one might have more than enough to provide for themselves then they also provide that to other kin that are in need, as it is a part of their role in kinship.

Conflict over pastures and cattle raids have been happening between Nuer and Dinka as they battle for grazing ground for their animals. According to Jared Diamond, &quot;...the Nuer observe few restrictions in their treatment of neighboring Dinka tribes: they regularly raid the Dinka, steal Dinka livestock, kill Dinka men, and take home some Dinka women and children as captives while killing the others. But Nuer hostilities against other Nuer tribes consist only of sporadic cattle raids, killing of just a few men, and no killing or kidnapping of women and children.&quot;

=== Religion ===
E. E. Evans-Pritchard studied the Nuer and made very detailed accounts of his interactions. He also describes Nuer cosmology and religion in his books.

Nuer Online indicates that, &quot;Nuer (Nuäär) believes that God is the spirit of the sky or the spirit who is in the sky&quot; Kuoth Nhial&quot; (God in Heaven) the creator, but Nuer believe in the coming of God through rain, lightning and thunder, and that the rainbow is the necklace of God. The sun and the moon as well as other material entities are also manifestation or sign of God, who after all is a spirit.

The spirits of the air above are believed to be the most powerful of the lesser spirits, while there are also spirits associated with clan-spears names such as WiW, a spirit of war, associated with thunder. Nuer believe that when a man or a woman dies, the flesh, the life and the soul separate. The flesh is committed to the earth, while the breath or life goes back to God (Kuoth). The soul that signifies the human individuality and personality remains alive as a shadow or a reflection, and departs together with the ox sacrificed, to the place of the ghosts.&quot;.

In the 1940s, missionaries began to attempt to evangelize the Nuer. The book of Genesis was translated and published in 1954, with the whole New Testament following in 1968. By the 1970s, there were nearly 200 Nuer congregations established. However, reporting indicates that only around 1% of Nuer identify as Christian.

=== Language ===
The people speak the Nuer language / Thoknath which belongs to the Nilo-Saharan language phylum.

=== Ritual ===

The Nuer receive facial markings (called &quot;gaar&quot;) as part of their initiation into adulthood.
The pattern of Nuer scarification varies within specific subgroups. The most common initiation pattern among males consists of six parallel horizontal lines which are cut across the forehead with a razor, often with a dip in the lines above the nose. Dotted patterns are also common (especially among the Bul Nuer and among females).

Some Nuer have begun practicing circumcision after being assimilated or partially assimilated in other ethnic groups. The Nuer are not historically known to circumcise, but sometimes circumcise people who have engaged in incest.

Typical foods eaten by the Nuer tribe include beef, goat, cow&#x27;s milk, mangos, and sorghum in one of three forms: &quot;ko̱p&quot; finely ground, handled until balled and boiled, &quot;walwal&quot; ground, lightly balled and boiled to a solid porridge, and injera / Yɔtyɔt, a large, pancake-like yeast-risen flatbread.

In the early 1990s about 25,000 African refugees were resettled in the United States throughout different locations such as South Dakota, Tennessee and Minnesota. In particular, 4,288 refugees from Sudan were resettled among 36 different states between 1990 and 1997 with the highest number in Texas at 17 percent of the refugee population from Sudan.

The Nuer refugees in the United States and those in Africa continue to observe their social obligations to one another. They use different means ranging from letters to new technologically advanced communication methods in order to stay connected to their families in Africa. Nuer in the United States provide assistance for family members&#x27; paperwork to help their migration process to the United States. Furthermore, Nuer in the United States observe family obligations by sending money for those still in Africa.

== Nuer military and political leaders ==
Some important Nuer politicians were, Böth Diew who was the first Nuer, and South Sudan Politician from 1947 followed by Gai Tut. In the Military is Bol Nyawan who fought against the Khartoum government in Bentiu; he was killed in 1985 by the current president of Sudan. Commander Ruai and Liah Diu Deng were responsible for the attack that forced Chevron to suspend activities in the oil field around 1982.

==Naming conventions==
* &quot;(Nya) Nyadä meaning my daughter &quot;And all females name begin with (Nya) of&quot;&quot;, is the standard prefix used for female names. &quot;Gat&quot;, meaning &quot; baby of&quot;, is a common prefix for male and female gender form as gatnyal(baby girl) and gatdhöl
* Children are commonly given names to mark historical events (&quot;Dɔmaac&quot; meaning &quot;bullet&quot;, or &quot;Mac&quot; meaning &quot;fire or gun&quot; given to a child born during times of war or from another man in the name of the deceased father who legally married the mother ). 
* &quot;Nhial&quot; means &quot;sky&quot;, and is a common name for males and females.
*Many Nuer have been exposed to missionaries and carry a Christian first name. Their second name is a given name and always in Nuer. The father&#x27;s given name follows the child&#x27;s given name, which is then followed by the grandfather&#x27;s name, and so on. Many Nuer can easily recount ten generations of paternal lineage because they carry those names themselves.
*When a Nuer comes to the Western world, which wants a first and last name, it is their custom to give their name as their first name followed by their father&#x27;s name as their middle name and their grandfather&#x27;s name as their last name.
* After the civil war, the Nuer began accepting cash currency into their economy, changing the dynamics of their cattle and how they were viewed. Each type of cattle is titled according to how they are acquired such as: &quot;the cattle of money&quot; (purchased with cash currency) and &quot;the cattle of girls/daughters&quot; (bridewealth).

Most Nuer people are nicknamed after their cattle. The boys usually chose the name of their favorite cattle based on the form and color of the ox. The girls are named after the cows that they milk. Sometimes the cow names are passed down.

==Oil==
Oil exploration and drilling began in 1975 and 1976 by companies such as Chevron. In 1979 the first oil production took place in the southern regions of Darfur. In the early 1980s when the north–south war was happening, Chevron was interested in the reserves in the south. In 1984 guerrillas of SPLA (Sudan People&#x27;s Liberation Army) attacked the drilling site of the north at Bentiu. In return, Chevron cleared Nuer and Dinka people in the oil fields area to ensure security for their operations.

The Nuer-Dinka struggle in oil fields continued in late 1990s into the early 2000s. The struggle for oil production was not only manifested in north–south fight, but also in Nuer-Dinka and many internal conflicts among Nuer.

As part of Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), 50 percent of net revenues of southern oil fields were given to the government of southern Sudan as a solution to one of the sources of decades of civil conflict.

<text>Pest control is the regulation or management of a species defined as a pest; such as any animal, plant or fungus that impacts adversely on human activities or environment. The human response depends on the importance of the damage done and will range from tolerance, through deterrence and management, to attempts to completely eradicate the pest. Pest control measures may be performed as part of an integrated pest management strategy.

In agriculture, pests are kept at bay by mechanical, cultural, chemical and biological means. Ploughing and cultivation of the soil before sowing mitigate the pest burden, and crop rotation helps to reduce the build-up of a certain pest species. Concern about environment means limiting the use of pesticides in favour of other methods. This can be achieved by monitoring the crop, only applying pesticides when necessary, and by growing varieties and crops which are resistant to pests. Where possible, biological means are used, encouraging the natural enemies of the pests and introducing suitable predators or parasites.

In homes and urban environments, the pests are the rodents, birds, insects and other organisms that share the habitat with humans, and that feed on or spoil possessions. Control of these pests is attempted through exclusion or quarantine, repulsion, physical removal or chemical means. Alternatively, various methods of biological control can be used including sterilisation programmes.

==History==
Pest control is at least as old as agriculture, as there has always been a need to keep crops free from pests. As long ago as 3000 BC in Egypt, cats were used to control pests of grain stores such as rodents. Ferrets were domesticated by 1500 BC in Europe for use as mousers. Mongooses were introduced into homes to control rodents and snakes, probably by the ancient Egyptians.

The conventional approach was probably the first to be employed, since it is comparatively easy to destroy weeds by burning them or ploughing them under, and to kill larger competing herbivores. Techniques such as crop rotation, companion planting (also known as intercropping or mixed cropping), and the selective breeding of pest-resistant cultivars have a long history.

Chemical pesticides were first used around 2500 BC, when the Sumerians used sulphur compounds as insecticides. Modern pest control was stimulated by the spread across the United States of the Colorado potato beetle. After much discussion, arsenical compounds were used to control the beetle and the predicted poisoning of the human population did not occur. This led the way to a widespread acceptance of insecticides across the continent. With the industrialisation and mechanization of agriculture in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the introduction of the insecticides pyrethrum and derris, chemical pest control became widespread. In the 20th century, the discovery of several synthetic insecticides, such as DDT, and herbicides boosted this development.

The harmful side effect of pesticides on humans has now resulted in the development of newer approaches, such as the use of biological control to eliminate the ability of pests to reproduce or to modify their behavior to make them less troublesome. Biological control is first recorded around 300 AD in China, when colonies of weaver ants, &quot;Oecophylla smaragdina&quot;, were intentionally placed in citrus plantations to control beetles and caterpillars. Also around 4000 BC in China, ducks were used in paddy fields to consume pests, as illustrated in ancient cave art. In 1762, an Indian mynah was brought to Mauritius to control locusts, and about the same time, citrus trees in Burma were connected by bamboos to allow ants to pass between them and help control caterpillars. In the 1880s, ladybirds were used in citrus plantations in California to control scale insects, and other biological control experiments followed. The introduction of DDT, a cheap and effective compound, put an effective stop to biological control experiments. By the 1960s, problems of resistance to chemicals and damage to the environment began to emerge, and biological control had a renaissance. Chemical pest control is still the predominant type of pest control today, although a renewed interest in traditional and biological pest control developed towards the end of the 20th century and continues to this day.
==In agriculture==
===Control methods===
====Biological pest control====

Biological pest control is a method of controlling pests such as insects and mites by using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory, parasitody or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. Classical biological control involves the introduction of natural enemies of the pest that are bred in the laboratory and released into the environment. An alternative approach is to augment the natural enemies that occur in a particular area by releasing more, either in small, repeated batches, or in a single large-scale release. Ideally, the released organism will breed and survive, and provide long-term control. Biological control can be an important component of an integrated pest management programme.

For example: mosquitoes are often controlled by putting &quot;Bt Bacillus thuringiensis&quot; ssp. &quot;israelensis&quot;, a bacterium that infects and kills mosquito larvae, in local water sources. 

====Cultural control====

Mechanical pest control is the use of hands-on techniques as well as simple equipment and devices, that provides a protective barrier between plants and insects. This is referred to as tillage and is one of the oldest methods of weed control as well as being useful for pest control; wireworms, the larvae of the common click beetle, are very destructive pests of newly ploughed grassland, and repeated cultivation exposes them to the birds and other predators that feed on them.

Crop rotation can help to control pests by depriving them of their host plants. It is a major tactic in the control of corn rootworm, and has reduced early season incidence of Colorado potato beetle by as much as 95%.

====Trap cropping====

A trap crop is a crop of a plant that attracts pests, diverting them from nearby crops. Pests aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, without the use of pesticides, possibly due to the pests&#x27; ability to disperse back into the main field.

====Pesticides====


Pesticides are substances applied to crops to control pests, they include herbicides to kill weeds, fungicides to kill fungi and insecticides to kill insects. They can be applied as sprays by hand, tractors, or aircraft or as seed dressings. To be effective, the correct substance must be applied at the correct time and the method of application is important to ensure adequate coverage and retention on the crop. The killing of natural enemies of the target pest should be minimized. This is particularly important in countries where there are natural reservoirs of pests and their enemies in the countryside surrounding plantation crops, and these co-exist in a delicate balance. Often in less-developed countries, the crops are well adapted to the local situation and no pesticides are needed. Where progressive farmers are using fertilizers to grow improved crop varieties, these are often more susceptible to pest damage, but the indiscriminate application of pesticides may be detrimental in the longer term.
The efficacy of chemical pesticides tends to diminish over time. This is because any organism that manages to survive the initial application will pass on its genes to its offspring and a resistant strain will be developed. In this way, some of the most serious pests have developed resistance and are no longer killed by pesticides that used to kill their ancestors. This necessitates higher concentrations of chemical, more frequent applications and a movement to more expensive formulations.

Pesticides are intended to kill pests, but many have detrimental effects on non-target species; of particular concern is the damage done to honey-bees, solitary bees and other pollinating insects and in this regard, the time of day when the spray is applied can be important. The widely used neonicotinoids have been banned on flowering crops in some countries because of their effects on bees. Some pesticides may cause cancer and other health problems in humans, as well as being harmful to wildlife. There can be acute effects immediately after exposure or chronic effects after continuous low-level, or occasional exposure. Maximum residue limits for pesticides in foodstuffs and animal feed are set by many nations.

====Genetics====
Using crops with inheritable resistance to pests is referred to as host-plant resistance and reduces the need for pesticide use. These crops can harm or even kill pests, repel feeding, prevent colonization, or tolerate the presence of a pest without significantly impacting yield. Resistance can also occur through genetic engineering to have traits with resistance to insects, such as with Bt corn, or papaya resistance to ringspot virus. When farmers are purchasing seed, variety information often includes resistance to selected pests in addition to other traits.

====Hunting====
Pest control can also be achieved via culling the pest animals — generally small- to medium-sized wild or feral mammals or birds that inhabit the ecological niches near farms, pastures or other human settlements — by employing human hunters or trappers to physically track down, kill and remove them from the area. The culled animals, known as vermin, may be targeted because they are deemed harmful to agricultural crops, livestock or facilities; serve as hosts or vectors that transmit pathogens across species or to humans; or for population control as a mean of protecting other vulnerable species and ecosystems.

Pest control via hunting, like all forms of harvest, has imposed an artificial selective pressure on the organisms being targeted. While varmint hunting is potentially selecting for desired behavioural and demographic changes (e.g. animals avoiding human populated areas, crops and livestock), it can also result in unpredicted outcomes such as the targeted animal adapting for faster reproductive cycles.

===Forestry===
Forest pests present a significant problem because it is not easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry pests such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of pests or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, the spruce budworm, a destructive pest of spruce and balsam fir, has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades. In some regions, such as New Brunswick, areas of forest are sprayed with pesticide to control the budworm population and prevent the damage caused during outbreaks.

==In homes and cities==

Many unwelcome animals visit or make their home in residential buildings, industrial sites and urban areas. Some contaminate foodstuffs, damage structural timbers, chew through fabrics or infest stored dry goods. Some inflict great economic loss, others carry diseases or cause fire hazards, and some are just a nuisance. Control of these pests has been attempted by improving sanitation and garbage control, modifying the habitat, and using repellents, growth regulators, traps, baits and pesticides.

===General methods===
====Physical pest control====

Physical pest control involves trapping or killing pests such as insects and rodents. Historically, local people or paid rat-catchers caught and killed rodents using dogs and traps. On a domestic scale, sticky flypapers are used to trap flies. In larger buildings, insects may be trapped using such means as pheromones, synthetic volatile chemicals or ultraviolet light to attract the insects; some have a sticky base or an electrically charged grid to kill them. Glueboards are sometimes used for monitoring cockroaches and to catch rodents. Rodents can be killed by suitably baited spring traps and can be caught in cage traps for relocation. Talcum powder or &quot;tracking powder&quot; can be used to establish routes used by rodents inside buildings and acoustic devices can be used for detecting beetles in structural timbers.

Historically, firearms have been one of the primary methods used for pest control. &quot;Garden Guns&quot; are smooth bore shotguns specifically made to fire .22 caliber snake shot or 9mm Flobert, and are commonly used by gardeners and farmers for snakes, rodents, birds, and other pest. Garden Guns are short-range weapons that can do little harm past 15 to 20 yards, and they&#x27;re relatively quiet when fired with snake shot, compared to standard ammunition. These guns are especially effective inside of barns and sheds, as the snake shot will not shoot holes in the roof or walls, or more importantly, injure livestock with a ricochet. They are also used for pest control at airports, warehouses, stockyards, etc.

The most common shot cartridge is .22 Long Rifle loaded with #12 shot. At a distance of about , which is about the maximum effective range, the pattern is about in diameter from a standard rifle. Special smoothbore shotguns, such as the Marlin Model 25MG can produce effective patterns out to 15 or 20 yards using .22 WMR shotshells, which hold 1/8 oz. of #12 shot contained in a plastic capsule.

====Poisoned bait====
Poisoned bait is a common method for controlling rats, mice, birds, slugs, snails, ants, cockroaches, and other pests. The basic granules, or other formulation, contains a food attractant for the target species and a suitable poison. For ants, a slow-acting toxin is needed so that the workers have time to carry the substance back to the colony, and for flies, a quick-acting substance to prevent further egg-laying and nuisance. Baits for slugs and snails often contain the molluscide metaldehyde, dangerous to children and household pets.

An article in Scientific American in 1885 described effective elimination of a cockroach infestation using fresh cucumber peels.

Warfarin has traditionally been used to kill rodents, but many populations have developed resistance to this anticoagulant, and difenacoum may be substituted. These are cumulative poisons, requiring bait stations to be topped up regularly. Poisoned meat has been used for centuries to kill animals such as wolves and birds of prey. Poisoned carcasses however kill a wide range of carrion feeders, not only the targeted species. Raptors in Israel were nearly wiped out following a period of intense poisoning of rats and other crop pests.

====Fumigation====

Fumigation is the treatment of a structure to kill pests such as wood-boring beetles by sealing it or surrounding it with an airtight cover such as a tent, and fogging with liquid insecticide for an extended period, typically of 24–72 hours. This is costly and inconvenient as the structure cannot be used during the treatment, but it targets all life stages of pests.

An alternative, space treatment, is fogging or misting to disperse a liquid insecticide in the atmosphere within a building without evacuation or airtight sealing, allowing most work within the building to continue, at the cost of reduced penetration. Contact insecticides are generally used to minimize long-lasting residual effects.

====Sterilization====

Populations of pest insects can sometimes be dramatically reduced by the release of sterile individuals. This involves the mass rearing of a pest, sterilising it by means of X-rays or some other means, and releasing it into a wild population. It is particularly useful where a female only mates once and where the insect does not disperse widely. This technique has been successfully used against the New World screw-worm fly, some species of tsetse fly, tropical fruit flies, the pink bollworm and the codling moth, among others.

To chemically sterilize pests using chemosterilants, laboratory studies conducted using U-5897 (3-chloro-1,2-propanediol) attempted in the early 1970s for rat control, although these proved unsuccessful. In 2013, New York City tested sterilization traps, demonstrating a 43% reduction in rat populations. The product ContraPest was approved for the sterilization of rodents by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in August 2016 as a chemosterilant.

====Insulation====
Boron, a known pesticide can be impregnated into the paper fibers of cellulose insulation at certain levels to achieve a mechanical kill factor for self-grooming insects such as ants, cockroaches, termites, and more. The addition of insulation into the attic and walls of a structure can provide control of common pests in addition to known insulation benefits such a robust thermal envelope and acoustic noise-canceling properties. The EPA regulates this type of general-use pesticide within the United States allowing it to only be sold and installed by licensed pest management professionals as part of an integrated pest management program. Simply adding Boron or an EPA-registered pesticide to an insulation does not qualify it as a pesticide. The dosage and method must be carefully controlled and monitored.

===Methods for specific pests===
====Rodent control====
=====Urban rodent control=====
Rodent control is vital in cities. New York City and cities across the state dramatically reduced their rodent populations in the early 1970s. Rio de Janeiro claims a reduction of 80% over only 2 years shortly thereafter. To better target efforts, London began scientifically surveying populations in 1972 and this was so useful that all Local Authorities in England and Wales soon followed.

=====Natural rodent control=====
Several wildlife rehabilitation organizations encourage natural form of rodent control through exclusion and predator support and preventing secondary poisoning altogether. The United States Environmental Protection Agency notes in its Proposed Risk Mitigation Decision for Nine Rodenticides that &quot;without habitat modification to make areas less attractive to commensal rodents, even eradication will not prevent new populations from recolonizing the habitat.&quot; The United States Environmental Protection Agency has prescribed guidelines for natural rodent control and for safe trapping in residential areas with subsequent release to the wild. People sometimes attempt to limit rodent damage using repellents. Balsam fir oil from the tree &quot;Abies balsamea&quot; is an EPA approved non-toxic rodent repellent. &quot;Acacia polyacantha&quot; subsp. &quot;campylacantha&quot; root emits chemical compounds that repel animals including rats.

====Pantry pests====
Insect pests including the Mediterranean flour moth, the Indian mealmoth, the cigarette beetle, the drugstore beetle, the confused flour beetle, the red flour beetle, the merchant grain beetle, the sawtoothed grain beetle, the wheat weevil, the maize weevil and the rice weevil infest stored dry foods such as flour, cereals and pasta.

In the home, foodstuffs found to be infested are usually discarded, and storing such products in sealed containers should prevent the problem from reoccurring. The eggs of these insects are likely to go unnoticed, with the larvae being the destructive life stage, and the adult the most noticeable stage. Since pesticides are not safe to use near food, alternative treatments such as freezing for four days at or baking for half an hour at should kill any insects present.

====Clothes moths====

The larvae of clothes moths (mainly &quot;Tineola bisselliella&quot; and &quot;Tinea pellionella&quot;) feed on fabrics and carpets, particularly those that are stored or soiled. The adult females lay batches of eggs on natural fibres, including wool, silk, and fur, as well as cotton and linen in blends. The developing larvae spin protective webbing and chew into the fabric, creating holes and specks of excrement. Damage is often concentrated in concealed locations, under collars and near seams of clothing, in folds and crevices in upholstery and round the edges of carpets as well as under furniture. Methods of control include using airtight containers for storage, periodic laundering of garments, trapping, freezing, heating and the use of chemicals; mothballs contain volatile insect repellents such as 1,4-Dichlorobenzene which deter adults, but to kill the larvae, permethrin, pyrethroids or other insecticides may need to be used.

====Carpet beetles====
Carpet beetles are members of the family Dermestidae, and while the adult beetles feed on nectar and pollen, the larvae are destructive pests in homes, warehouses, and museums. They feed on animal products including wool, silk, leather, fur, the bristles of hair brushes, pet hair, feathers, and museum specimens. They tend to infest hidden locations and may feed on larger areas of fabrics than do clothes moths, leaving behind specks of excrement and brown, hollow, bristly-looking cast skins. Management of infestations is difficult and is based on exclusion and sanitation where possible, resorting to pesticides when necessary. The beetles can fly in from outdoors and the larvae can survive on lint fragments, dust, and inside the bags of vacuum cleaners. In warehouses and museums, sticky traps baited with suitable pheromones can be used to identify problems, and heating, freezing, spraying the surface with insecticide, and fumigation will kill the insects when suitably applied. Susceptible items can be protected from attack by keeping them in clean airtight containers.

====Bookworms====
Books are sometimes attacked by cockroaches, silverfish, book mites, booklice, and various beetles which feed on the covers, paper, bindings and glue. They leave behind physical damage in the form of tiny holes as well as staining from their faeces. Book pests include the larder beetle, and the larvae of the black carpet beetle and the drugstore beetle which attack leather-bound books, while the common clothes moth and the brown house moth attack cloth bindings. These attacks are largely a problem with historic books, because modern bookbinding materials are less susceptible to this type of damage.

Evidence of attack may be found in the form of tiny piles of book-dust and specks of frass. Damage may be concentrated in the spine, the projecting edges of pages and the cover. Prevention of attack relies on keeping books in cool, clean, dry positions with low humidity, and occasional inspections should be made. Treatment can be by freezing for lengthy periods, but some insect eggs are very resistant and can survive for long periods at low temperatures.

====Beetles====
Various beetles in the Bostrichoidea superfamily attack the dry, seasoned wood used as structural timber in houses and to make furniture. In most cases, it is the larvae that do the damage; these are invisible from the outside of the timber but are chewing away at the wood in the interior of the item. Examples of these are the powderpost beetles, which attack the sapwood of hardwoods, and the furniture beetles, which attacks softwoods, including plywood. The damage has already been done by the time the adult beetles bore their way out, leaving neat round holes behind them. The first that a householder knows about the beetle damage is often when a chair leg breaks off or a piece of structural timber caves in. Prevention is possible through chemical treatment of the timber prior to its use in construction or in furniture manufacturing.

====Termites====
Termites with colonies in close proximity to houses can extend their galleries underground and make mud tubes to enter homes. The insects keep out of sight and chew their way through structural and decorative timbers, leaving the surface layers intact, as well as through cardboard, plastic and insulation materials. Their presence may become apparent when winged insects appear and swarm in the home in spring. Regular inspection of structures by a trained professional may help detect termite activity before the damage becomes substantial.; Inspection and monitoring of termites is important because termite alates (winged reproductives) may not always swarm inside a structure. Control and extermination is a professional job involving trying to exclude the insects from the building and trying to kill those already present. Soil-applied liquid termiticides provide a chemical barrier that prevents termites from entering buildings, and lethal baits can be used; these are eaten by foraging insects, and carried back to the nest and shared with other members of the colony, which goes into slow decline.

====Mosquitoes====

Mosquitoes are midge-like flies in the family Culicidae. Females of most species feed on blood and some act as vectors for malaria and other diseases. Historically they have been controlled by use of DDT and other chemical means, but since the adverse environmental effects of these insecticides have been realized, other means of control have been attempted. The insects rely on water in which to breed and the first line of control is to reduce possible breeding locations by draining marshes and reducing accumulations of standing water. Other approaches include biological control of larvae by the use of fish or other predators, genetic control, the introduction of pathogens, growth-regulating hormones, the release of pheromones and mosquito trapping.

==On airfields==

Birds are a significant hazard to aircraft, but it is difficult to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have been explored. Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.

<text>Kommunity FK is an American post-punk/gothic rock band which formed in 1978. The band helped establish what came to be known as the deathrock scene in Los Angeles.

==History==
The band was formed in 1978 by singer Patrick Mata, who was influenced by musicians Throbbing Gristle, David Bowie and Joy Division as well as other artistic inspirations like Dadaism, anti-art, noise, musique concrète and the Brion Gysin/William Burroughs cut-up technique.

Though initially named &quot;Kommunity Fuck&quot;, after a piece of paste-up art created by Mata, the moniker was soon shortened. Mata has stated that the name was inspired by the cold shoulder given him by unimaginative local media venue talent buyers as well as industry powers.

Kommunity FK&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Vision and the Voice&quot;, was released in 1983 by Independent Project Records, featuring a lineup of Mata, drummer Matt Chaikin and bassist CE CE.

The follow-up, 1985&#x27;s &quot;Close One Sad Eye&quot;, garnered significant attention when a video clip for the song &quot;Something Inside Me Has Died&quot; received significant play on MTV. By this time, Mata and Chaikin had been joined by bassist Kevin Kipnis and keyboardist Margaret Arana.

After departing the band, Chaikin drummed for an early lineup of Jane&#x27;s Addiction.

Later Kommunity FK lineups included bassists Cam Campbell (A II Z, Sex Gang Children), Eddie Branch (UK Decay, Furyo, Peter Murphy) and Dave Roberts (Sex Gang Children, Carcrash International.

In 2008, Kommunity FK returned with their third effort, the collection &quot;Abandoned Here... Planet Ruled By Bastards&quot;, issued on the Invisible Records label. Now a duo of Mata and guitarist/keyboardist Sherry Rubber, they followed it up with &quot;La Santisima Muerte&quot; (2010) on KommunityPM Rekords and &quot;Thee Image &amp; Thee Myth&quot; (2015) on Crysella Records.

During a Kommunity FK hiatus in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Mata led the band Sativa Luvbox, who released two albums: &quot;The Bad Sleep Well&quot; (1989, Splat-Co Records) and &quot;Beloved Satellite&quot; (1993, Gasoline Alley Records). Mata had earlier issued a 1979 single, &quot;The Queen of Beverly Hills,&quot; under his own name. Using the name Texylvania, he also covered songs on several tribute albums.

The first Apollo was called the &quot;Mobbel&quot;, and featured an air-cooled 624 cc single-cylinder IOE engine. The company also offered air-cooled 1608 cc in-line fours and a 1575 cc V-4. Four separate cylinders inline powered the model &quot;E&quot; (1770 cc). The model &quot;B&quot;, designed by racing driver , had an OHV 960 cc four-cylinder engine. Another of his creations had an OHV 2040 cc engine. Other Apollos had sidevalve four-cylinder engines of up to 3440 cc; some post-1920 models featured wishbone suspension. The last cars produced by the company had OHV 1200 cc four-cylinder engines; some had sidevalve 1551 cc Steudel four-cylinder power units instead. The designer of two-stroke engines, , was the factory founder&#x27;s son; in 1920 Apollo took over his air-cooled MAF cars.

<text>Quake is a series of first-person shooter video games, developed by id Software and, as of 2010, published by Bethesda Softworks. The series is composed of &quot;Quake&quot; and its nonlinear, standalone sequels, which vary in setting and plot.

&quot;Quake&quot; was created as a successor franchise to id&#x27;s highly successful &quot;Doom&quot; series, which had begun in 1993. As a new series, it built upon the fast-paced gameplay, game engine, and 3D graphics capabilities of &quot;Doom&quot;. It also expanded upon the multiplayer capabilities of &quot;Doom&quot; by introducing online multiplayer over the internet. This contributed to the popularity of the &quot;Quake&quot; series and characterized it as a figurehead in online gaming.

==Games==

Every game in the &quot;Quake&quot; franchise shares a basis in first-person shooter gameplay. However, the series lacks a singular narrative across all of its entries. Two major storylines exist within the franchise, as well as the &quot;Arena&quot; series, which focuses primarily on multiplayer gameplay.

=== Original storyline ===
The game&#x27;s original plot focused on the player character, later known as &quot;Ranger&quot; in &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, who travels across alternate dimensions to stop an enemy code-named &quot;Quake&quot;. The game takes place in a Lovecraftian setting with a mixture of dark fantasy, pseudo-medieval, and science fiction elements.

*&quot;Quake&quot; (1996)
**&quot;Quake Mission Pack No. 1: Scourge of Armagon&quot; (1997)
**&quot;Quake Mission Pack No. 2: Dissolution of Eternity&quot; (1997)
**&quot;&quot; (2016; chronologically set between &quot;Quake&quot; and its two expansions)
**&quot;&quot; (2021)

=== &quot;Quake II&quot; storyline ===
Shifting the series to a science fiction theme, &quot;Quake II&quot; and its sequels chronicle the war between humanity and the cybernetic alien race known as the Strogg.

*&quot;Quake II&quot; (1997)
**&quot;Quake II Mission Pack: The Reckoning&quot; (1998)
**&quot;Quake II Mission Pack: Ground Zero&quot; (1998)
**&quot;Call of the Machine&quot; (2023; expansion created by MachineGames for the enhanced edition of Quake II)
*&quot;Quake 4&quot; (2005)
*&quot;Enemy Territory: Quake Wars&quot; (2007; a spin-off of the series and a successor to &quot;&quot;, with a storyline set before the events of &quot;Quake II&quot;)

=== &quot;Arena&quot; series ===
&quot;Quake III Arena&quot; and its successors focus on competitive multiplayer rather than a single-player experience. These games de-emphasized the setting of the first two installments while still retaining continuity with them and crossing over with id&#x27;s &quot;Doom&quot; franchise. &quot;Quake Champions&quot;, in particular, is heavily influenced by the mythology of the original game.
*&quot;Quake III Arena&quot; (1999)
**&quot;Quake III: Team Arena&quot; (2000)
**&quot;Quake Live&quot; (2010; an updated version of &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; originally designed as a free-to-play game launched via a web plug-in)
*&quot;Quake Champions&quot; (2017)

==Reception==

Since its first release, the series has received mostly positive reviews.

&quot;Quake&quot;, &quot;Quake II&quot;, and &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; have all been considered by various video game journalists and magazines to be among the greatest video games of all time.

=== Controversy ===
Like &quot;Doom&quot;, the &quot;Quake&quot; series initially received controversy due to containing high amounts of graphic violence. Public and media outcry over &quot;Quake&quot; and other violent video games peaked after the Columbine High School massacre occurred on April 20, 1999, and it became known that perpetrators Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were avid players of both &quot;Doom&quot; and &quot;Quake&quot;. This finding prompted claims from media outlets that violent video games caused negative psychological effects on children that made them more aggressive and accepting of violence.

id Software co-founder John Romero later stated in a 2013 interview that the company and its developers had never intended to &quot;offend people or shock people&quot; with their games.&#x27;

<doc id="855313" wikidata="Q619110" url="?curid=855313" title="Apollo GT">
<text>The Apollo GT is an Italian-American sports car, initially marketed from 1962 to 1964 by International Motor Cars in Oakland, California.

Engineered by Milt Brown and designed by Ron Plescia, it featured handmade Italian bodywork and chassis by Intermeccanica, with a choice between two-seater convertible or fastback styles. Power came from a or Buick engine mated to a 4-speed manual.

The initial company completed assembly of 42 cars before suspending production while seeking new financing. IMC allowed the sale of Intermeccanica body/chassis units to Vanguard Motors in Dallas, Texas, to produce cars under the Vetta Ventura name. These were made until 1966 as a stop-gap measure to keep body producer Intermeccanica in business until new backers were found. Other production arrangements followed, assembling cars not completed by International.

A total of 88 cars have been produced to date by all entities.

== History ==

Frank Reisner, a former chemical engineer born in Hungary, raised in Canada and educated in America, established a company that later produced complete bodies—painted and trimmed—for the Apollo as well as the Texas-built Vetta Ventura (which was the same car with a different name). Reisner, on holiday in Italy in 1959, decided that he loved Turin and set up shop there as Intermeccanica producing tuning kits for Renaults, Peugeots, and Simcas.

The Apollo project was the dream of a young California engineer, Milt Brown, who desired to build an American answer to European GTs, such as the Aston Martin DB4 and Ferrari coupes. Brown, who was looking for a coachbuilder, met Reisner at the Monaco Grand Prix in 1960. A deal was made and the first Apollos were built by early 1963 by Brown&#x27;s International Motor Cars. Intermeccanica hand formed and trimmed the bodies in Turin, Italy, and then shipped them by sea to Oakland, California, where the drive train was installed. The prototype&#x27;s design was by Milt Brown&#x27;s friend, Ron Plescia, but the nose was too long and the rear vision limited, so Reisner commissioned former Bertone stylist Franco Scaglione to revise it. The prototypes featured all aluminum bodies, but the production versions were mainly steel with aluminum hoods and doors.

The finished car, sold by Brown&#x27;s International Motorcars of Oakland, was well received and had famous owners such as Pat Boone. The base price was $6000 and the top speed was claimed to be 150 mph (240 km/h).

A prototype 2 + 2 was shown in New York in 1965. It was shown again in 1966 as the Griffith GT.

International Motor Cars sold 42 cars (40 coupes and one spyder, including the prototype) before production stopped in mid-1964 due to lack of financing. IMC then made a contract with Reisner (to keep his operation going) allowing Intermeccanica to supply body/chassis units to Fred Ricketts, owner of Vanguard Industries, an aftermarket supplier of auto air conditioners in Dallas, Texas. Vanguard sold it as the Vetta Ventura. The intent was to give IMC time to find new financing as well as keep Intermeccanica alive.

Vanguard built only 11 cars, with shop foreman Tom Johnson purchasing the leftover 11 body/chassis units and completing them as late as 1971.

A third attempt to produce the Apollo was by attorney Robert Stevens. His Apollo International company of Pasadena, California completed only 14 cars, with foreman Otto Becker finishing another six. Four body chassis/units were never claimed by Apollo International and were sold by US Customs to Ken Dumiere.

A pair of Apollo 3500 GTs were used to portray the Thorndyke Special race car which was featured in &quot;The Love Bug&quot;, a 1968 Disney movie. One of the pair has been fully restored.

Following this venture, Intermeccanica decided to move all production in-house, rather than exporting rolling chassis&#x27; for completion. Reisner later developed projects such as the Griffith, the Murena GT, and the Italia by Intermeccanica. Intermeccanica went on to produce the Veltro 1500, the Griffin (which was a version of the prototype Apollo 2+2), the Phoenix, and the Omega among others.

<doc id="855314" wikidata="Q1544633" url="?curid=855314" title="Green River (Tennessee)">
<text>The Green River is a tributary of the Buffalo River in Tennessee. By the Buffalo River and the Duck River it is a tributary of the Tennessee River. The Green River is one of the main streams of Wayne County. Situated in the southwestern corner of Middle Tennessee along the Alabama line, Wayne County is one of the state&#x27;s largest counties in area but is very sparsely populated. Most of the county is located on the Southern Highland Rim, an area of hills, ridges, and narrow stream valleys that is largely underlain by Paleozoic limestone.

The Green River rises about southeast of the Wayne County seat of Waynesboro and flows northwest into that town, which is almost bisected by it, and then flows generally almost due north, albeit by a fairly meandering course, to its confluence with the Buffalo River just south of the Wayne County - Perry County line. It is the source of the Waynesboro municipal water supply. The river lives up to its name, often showing a deep bluish-green color, especially in its downstream reaches.

This Green River should not be confused with the Green River in Kentucky, which is a tributary of the Ohio River and has a very small portion of its drainage basin in north-central Tennessee.

<doc id="855322" wikidata="Q9213592" url="?curid=855322" title="Dismissal (employment)">
<text>Dismissal (colloquially called firing or sacking) is the termination of employment by an employer against the will of the employee. Though such a decision can be made by an employer for a variety of reasons, ranging from an economic downturn to performance-related problems on the part of the employee, being fired has a strong stigma in some cultures.

To be dismissed, as opposed to quitting voluntarily (or being laid off), is often perceived as being the employee&#x27;s fault. Finding new employment may often be difficult after being fired, particularly if there is a history of being terminated from a previous job, if the reason for firing is for some serious infraction, or the employee did not keep the job very long. Job seekers will often not mention jobs that they were fired from on their resumes; accordingly, unexplained gaps in employment are often regarded as a red flag.

==Usage==
While the main formal term for ending someone&#x27;s employment is &quot;dismissal&quot;, there are a number of colloquial or euphemistic expressions for the same action.

&quot;Firing&quot; is a common colloquial term in the English language (particularly used in the U.S. and Canada), which may have originated in the 1910s at the National Cash Register Company. Other terms for dismissal are being &quot;canned&quot;, &quot;let go&quot;, &quot;ran-off&quot;, &quot;axed&quot;, being given walking papers, the pink slip or one&#x27;s cards, (or P45 in the UK), &quot;boned&quot;, or &quot;shown the door&quot;. Other terms, more often used in Commonwealth countries, include &quot;to get the boot&quot;, &quot;to get the sack&quot;, or simply to be &quot;sacked&quot;.

==Reasons==
Most US states have adopted the at-will employment contract that allows the employer to dismiss employees without having to provide a justified reason for firing, although the variety of court cases that have come out of &quot;at-will&quot; dismissals have made such at-will contracts ambiguous. Often, an at-will termination is handled as a &quot;layoff&quot;. Sometimes, an employee will be dismissed if an employer can find better employees than the incumbent, even if the fired employee has not technically broken any rules. This is common with probationary employees who were recently hired, but who cannot adjust to the environment of the workplace, or those who have been around for a long time, but can be replaced with a less experienced employee who can be paid a lower salary. In contrast, a dismissal in France is subjected to a just cause and a formal procedure.

Some examples include conflict of interest, where the employee has done nothing wrong, but the presence of the employee on the employer&#x27;s payroll may be harmful to the employer. For example: 
* A close relative (spouse, sibling, child or parent) of a member of the executive management of a company might not be able to work for a competitor where they could know trade secrets or where they themselves are part of the other company&#x27;s executive management due to requirements for competition or antitrust prohibitions.
* This may be the case when two members of the same family become employed by the firm. 
* In other cases, those who report wrongdoing in the workplace, known as whistleblowers, put their job at risk because they might be retaliated against.

More common reasons for firing include attendance problems, insubordination (talking back to a manager or supervisor), drinking alcoholic beverages or doing illegal drugs at work, or consuming the same substances before work and showing up to work while intoxicated or &quot;high&quot; (an especially serious problem in jobs where the worker drives a vehicle, boat or aircraft or operates heavy machinery) or off job-site conduct.

==Additional consequences==
Some fired employees may face additional consequences besides their dismissal. This may occur when the reason for the termination is a violation of criminal law, or if serious damages are caused to the employer as a result of the employee&#x27;s actions. Such ex-employees may face criminal prosecution, a civil lawsuit, or a reporting to a database of those who have engaged in serious misconduct in such a position, so that the chances of ever obtaining a similar position with another employer are less likely (blacklisting). Some examples are a caregiver who engages in abuse, a bank teller who has stolen money from the cash drawer, or a member of law enforcement who has committed police brutality.

For the most serious violations, especially when the employer&#x27;s security may be at risk from the employee in question, a guard or officer may escort a fired employee from the workplace to the parking lot upon their dismissal. Such actions are often taken by government offices or large corporations that contain sensitive materials, and where the risk exists that the terminated employee may remove some of these materials or otherwise steal trade secrets in order to retaliate against the employer or use it to the advantage of a competing enterprise.

==Discriminatory and retaliatory termination==
In some cases, the firing of an employee is a discriminatory act. Although an employer may often claim the dismissal was for &quot;just cause&quot;, these discriminatory acts are often because of the employee&#x27;s legally protected characteristics, which vary from place to place. They may include physical or mental disability, age, race, religion, gender, HIV status or sexual orientation. Other unjust firings may result from a workplace manager or supervisor wanting to retaliate against an employee. Often, this is because the worker reported wrongdoing (often, but not always sexual harassment or other misconduct) on the part of the supervisor. Such terminations are often illegal. Many successful lawsuits have resulted from discriminatory or retaliatory termination.

Under US law, workers are entitled to workplace decisions that do not discriminate against their membership in a protected group such as national origin, but they are not entitled to overall fairness. It is legal for an American employee to be fired for things such as disagreeing with the employer or not getting along well with others, even if the employee is correct. 

Discriminatory or retaliatory termination by a supervisor can take the form of administrative process. In this form the rules of the institution are used as the basis for termination. For example, if a place of employment has a rule that prohibits personal phone calls, receiving or making personal calls can be the grounds for termination even though it may be a common practice within the organization.

==Changes of conditions==
Employers who wish for an employee to exit of their own accord, but do not wish to pursue firing or forced resignation, may degrade the employee&#x27;s working conditions, hoping that he or she will leave &quot;voluntarily&quot;. The employee may be moved to a different geographical location, assigned to an undesirable shift, given too few hours if part-time, demoted (or relegated to a menial task), or assigned to work in uncomfortable conditions. Other forms of manipulation may be used, such as being unfairly hostile to the employee, and punishing them for things that are deliberately overlooked with other employees. Such tactics may amount to constructive dismissal, which is illegal in some jurisdictions.

==Rehire following termination==
Depending on the circumstances, a person whose employment has been terminated may not be eligible for being rehired by the same employer. If the decision to terminate was the employee&#x27;s, the willingness of the employer to rehire is often contingent upon the relationship the employee had with the employer, the amount of notice given by the employee prior to departure, and the needs of the employer. In some cases, when an employee departed on good terms, they may be given special priority by the employer when seeking rehire. 

An employee may be terminated without prejudice, meaning the fired employee may be rehired for the same job in the future. This is usually true in the case of layoff. Conversely, a person can be terminated with prejudice, meaning an employer will not rehire the former employee for the same job in the future. This can be for many reasons: incompetence, misconduct (such as dishonesty or &quot;zero tolerance&quot; violations), policy violation, insubordination or &quot;attitude&quot; (personality clashes with peers or bosses). Termination forms (&quot;pink slips&quot; in the U.S. and Canada) routinely include a set of check boxes where a supervisor can indicate &quot;with prejudice&quot; or &quot;without prejudice&quot;. During the Vietnam War, the CIA used this terminology with regard to its locally hired operatives. In the case of severe misconduct, it is alleged that the CIA would assassinate them or &quot;terminate with extreme prejudice&quot;.

<text>The turn (symbol tr or pla) is a unit of plane angle measurement that is the measure of a complete angle—the angle subtended by a complete circle at its center. One turn is equal to  radians, 360 degrees or 400 gradians. As an angular unit, one turn also corresponds to one cycle (symbol cyc or c) or to one revolution (symbol rev or r). Common related units of frequency are &quot;cycles per second&quot; (cps) and &quot;revolutions per minute&quot; (rpm). The angular unit of the turn is useful in connection with, among other things, electromagnetic coils (e.g., transformers), rotating objects, and the winding number of curves. 
Divisions of a turn include the half-turn and quarter-turn, spanning a straight angle and a right angle, respectively; metric prefixes can also be used as in, e.g., centiturns (ctr), milliturns (mtr), etc.

Because one turn is formula_1 radians, some have proposed representing with a single letter. In 2010, Michael Hartl proposed using the Greek letter formula_2 (tau), equal to the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its radius (formula_1) and corresponding to one turn, for greater conceptual simplicity when stating angles in radians. This proposal did not initially gain widespread acceptance in the mathematical community, but the constant has become more widespread, having been added to several major programming languages and calculators.

In the ISQ, an arbitrary &quot;number of turns&quot; (also known as &quot;number of revolutions&quot; or &quot;number of cycles&quot;) is formalized as a dimensionless quantity called rotation, defined as the ratio of a given angle and a full turn. It is represented by the symbol &quot;N&quot;. 

== Unit symbols ==

There are several unit symbols for the turn.

=== EU and Switzerland ===
The German standard DIN 1315 (March 1974) proposed the unit symbol &quot;pla&quot; (from Latin: &#x27;full angle&#x27;) for turns. Covered in (October 2010), the so-called (&#x27;full angle&#x27;) is not an SI unit. However, it is a legal unit of measurement in the EU and Switzerland.

=== Calculators ===
The scientific calculators HP 39gII and HP Prime support the unit symbol &quot;tr&quot; for turns since 2011 and 2013, respectively. Support for &quot;tr&quot; was also added to newRPL for the HP 50g in 2016, and for the hp 39g+, HP 49g+, HP 39gs, and HP 40gs in 2017. An angular mode TURN was suggested for the WP 43S as well, but the calculator instead implements &quot;MUL&quot; (&quot;multiples of&quot;) as mode and unit since 2019.

== Divisions ==
Many angle units are defined as a division of the turn. For example, the degree is defined such that one turn is 360 degrees. 

Using metric prefixes, the turn can be divided in 100 centiturns or milliturns, with each milliturn corresponding to an angle of 0.36°, which can also be written as 21′ 36″. A protractor divided in centiturns is normally called a &quot;percentage protractor&quot;. While percentage protractors have existed since 1922, the terms centiturns, milliturns and microturns were introduced much later by the British astronomer Fred Hoyle in 1962. Some measurement devices for artillery and satellite watching carry milliturn scales.

Binary fractions of a turn are also used. Sailors have traditionally divided a turn into 32 compass points, which implicitly have an angular separation of 1/32 turn. The &quot;binary degree&quot;, also known as the &quot;binary radian&quot; (or &quot;brad&quot;), is  turn. The binary degree is used in computing so that an angle can be represented to the maximum possible precision in a single byte. Other measures of angle used in computing may be based on dividing one whole turn into equal parts for other values of .

== Proposals for a single letter to represent 2&quot;π&quot; ==


The number (approximately 6.28) is the ratio of a circle&#x27;s circumference to its radius, and the number of radians in one turn.

The meaning of the symbol formula_4 was not originally fixed to the ratio of the circumference and the diameter. In 1697, David Gregory used (pi over rho) to denote the perimeter of a circle (i.e., the circumference) divided by its radius. However, earlier in 1647, William Oughtred had used (delta over pi) for the ratio of the diameter to perimeter. The first use of the symbol on its own with its present meaning (of perimeter divided by diameter) was in 1706 by the Welsh mathematician William Jones.

The first known usage of a single letter to denote the 6.28... constant was in Leonhard Euler&#x27;s 1727 &quot;Essay Explaining the Properties of Air&quot;, where it was denoted by the letter . Euler would later use the letter for the 3.14... constant in his 1736 &quot;Mechanica&quot; and 1748 &quot;Introductio in analysin infinitorum,&quot; though defined as half the circumference of a circle of radius 1—a unit circle—rather than the ratio of circumference to diameter. Elsewhere in &quot;Mechanica&quot;, Euler instead used the letter for one-fourth of the circumference of a unit circle, or 1.57... . Usage of the letter , sometimes for 3.14... and other times for 6.28..., became widespread, with the definition varying as late as 1761; afterward, was standardized as being equal to 3.14... .

Several people have independently proposed using , including:

* Joseph Lindenburg ( 1990)
* John Fisher (2004)
* Peter Harremoës (2010)
* Michael Hartl (2010)

In 2001, Robert Palais proposed using the number of radians in a turn as the fundamental circle constant instead of , which amounts to the number of radians in half a turn, in order to make mathematics simpler and more intuitive. His proposal used a &quot;π with three legs&quot; symbol to denote the constant (formula_5).

In 2008, Robert P. Crease proposed the idea of defining a constant as the ratio of circumference to radius, a proposal supported by John Horton Conway. Crease used the Greek letter psi: formula_6.

The same year, Thomas Colignatus proposed the uppercase Greek letter theta, Θ, to represent 2.
The Greek letter theta derives from the Phoenician and Hebrew letter teth, 𐤈 or ט, and it has been observed that the older version of the symbol, which means wheel, resembles a wheel with four spokes. It has also been proposed to use the wheel symbol, teth, to represent the value 2, and more recently a connection has been made among other ancient cultures on the existence of a wheel, sun, circle, or disk symbol—i.e. other variations of teth—as representation for 2.

In 2010, Michael Hartl proposed to use the Greek letter tau to represent the circle constant: . He offered several reasons for the choice of constant, primarily that it allows fractions of a turn to be expressed more directly: for instance, a  turn would be represented as  rad instead of  rad. As for the choice of notation, he offered two reasons. First, is the number of radians in one &quot;turn&quot;, and both and &quot;turn&quot; begin with a sound. Second, visually resembles , whose association with the circle constant is unavoidable. Hartl&#x27;s &quot;Tau Manifesto&quot; gives many examples of formulas that are asserted to be clearer where is used instead of . For example, Hartl asserts that replacing Euler&#x27;s identity by (which Hartl also calls &quot;Euler&#x27;s identity&quot;) is more fundamental and meaningful. He also claims that the formula for circular area in terms of , , contains a natural factor of arising from integration.

Initially, this proposal did not receive significant acceptance by the mathematical and scientific communities. However, the use of has become more widespread.

The following table shows how various identities appear when is used instead of . For a more complete list, see &quot;List of formulae involving&quot;.

=== In culture ===

 has made numerous appearances in culture. It is celebrated annually on June 28, known as Tau Day. has been covered in videos by Vi Hart, &quot;Numberphile&quot;, &quot;SciShow&quot;, Steve Mould, Khan Academy, and 3Blue1Brown, and it has appeared in the comics &quot;xkcd&quot;, &quot;Saturday Morning Breakfast Cereal&quot;, and &quot;Sally Forth&quot;. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology usually announces admissions on March 14 at 6:28p.m., which is on Pi Day at Tau Time.

== Unit conversion ==
One turn is equal to (≈ ) radians, 360 degrees, or 400 gradians.


== In the ISQ/SI ==

In the International System of Quantities (ISQ), rotation (symbol N) is a physical quantity defined as number of revolutions:

&quot;N&quot; is the number (not necessarily an integer) of revolutions, for example, of a rotating body about a given axis. Its value is given by:
: formula_7
where denotes the measure of rotational displacement.

The above definition is part of the ISQ, formalized in the international standard ISO 80000-3 (Space and time), and adopted in the International System of Units (SI). 

Rotation count or number of revolutions is a quantity of dimension one, resulting from a ratio of angular displacement.
It can be negative and also greater than 1 in modulus.
The relationship between quantity rotation, &quot;N&quot;, and unit turns, tr, can be expressed as:
: formula_8
where {}tr is the numerical value of the angle in units of turns (see &quot;&quot;).

In the ISQ/SI, rotation is used to derive rotational frequency (the rate of change of rotation with respect to time), denoted by :
: formula_9

The SI unit of rotational frequency is the reciprocal second (s−1). Common related units of frequency are &quot;hertz&quot; (Hz), &quot;cycles per second&quot; (cps), and &quot;revolutions per minute&quot; (rpm).


The superseded version ISO 80000-3:2006 defined &quot;revolution&quot; as a special name for the dimensionless unit &quot;one&quot;,
which also received other special names, such as the radian.
Despite their dimensional homogeneity, these two specially named dimensionless units are applicable for non-comparable kinds of quantity: rotation and angle, respectively.
&quot;Cycle&quot; is also mentioned in ISO 80000-3, in the definition of &quot;period&quot;.

== In programming languages ==

The following table documents various programming languages that have implemented the circle constant for converting between turns and radians. All of the languages below support the name &quot;Tau&quot; in some casing, but Processing also supports &quot;TWO_PI&quot; and Raku also supports the symbol &quot;τ&quot; for accessing the same value.

<text>Iris Luella DeMent (born January 5, 1961) is an American singer-songwriter and musician. DeMent&#x27;s musical style includes elements of folk, country and gospel. She has been nominated for a Grammy Award twice.

==Early life==
DeMent was born in Paragould, Arkansas, the 14th and youngest child of Pat DeMent (1910–1992) and wife Flora Mae (1918–2011). Iris&#x27;s mother had harbored dreams of going to Nashville and starting a singing career. Although she put those plans on hold to get married, her singing voice was an inspiration and influence for her youngest daughter Iris. DeMent was raised in a Pentecostal household. Her family moved from Arkansas to the Los Angeles area when she was three. While growing up, she was exposed to and influenced by country and gospel music. Singing at age five as one of &quot;the little DeMent sisters&quot;, Iris had a bad experience when she forgot her words during her first performance, which caused her to avoid performing in public for some time.

DeMent left high school in the tenth grade to work full time at a Kmart store. Her parents required her to get a GED high school diploma. She later went with a boyfriend to Topeka, Kansas, where she attended Washburn University. There she started writing after receiving positive feedback from her English composition professor.

==Music and career==
DeMent was inspired to write her first song, &quot;Our Town,&quot; at age 25 by a drive through a boarded-up Midwest town. The song lyrics came to her &quot;exactly as it is now,&quot; with no need for re-writing, and she realized then that songwriting was her calling. &quot;Our Town&quot; was played during the closing scene for the final episode (July 26, 1995) of CBS&#x27;s television series &quot;Northern Exposure&quot;. The song has been recorded by Kate Rusby, Kate Brislin &amp; Jody Stecher and Trampled by Turtles.

Her first album, &quot;Infamous Angel&quot;, was released in 1992 on the Rounder-Philo label and explored such themes as religious skepticism, small-town life, and human frailty. &quot;Let the Mystery Be&quot; has been covered by a number of artists, including 10,000 Maniacs (whose &#x27;Unplugged&#x27; version featured Talking Heads&#x27; David Byrne), as well as Alice Stuart. It was also used in the opening scenes of the film &quot;Little Buddha&quot;. In the fall of 2015, a version of &quot;Let the Mystery Be&quot; from the Transatlantic Sessions became the musical theme for the opening credits of the HBO series &quot;The Leftovers&quot;, replacing the original &quot;Main Title Theme&quot; composed by Max Richter, and it would once again serve as the opening theme for the series finale.

In her second album, &quot;My Life&quot;, released in 1994, she continued the personal and introspective approach. The record is dedicated to her father, who died two years earlier. &quot;My Life&quot; was nominated for a Grammy Award in the Best Contemporary Folk Album category.

DeMent&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Way I Should&quot;, was released in 1996. Featuring the protest song &quot;Wasteland of the Free&quot;, it is DeMent&#x27;s most political work. It covers topics such as sexual abuse, religion, government policy, and Vietnam.

DeMent sang the duet &quot;Bell Bottomed Tear&quot; as part of The Beautiful South&#x27;s Much &quot;Later with Jools&quot; live special in 1997.

In 1998, the song &quot;Iris&quot; by the rock band Goo Goo Dolls was named after her. Singer and songwriter John Rzeznik had already written the lyrics to the song but was having a problem naming it. He opened up the &quot;LA Weekly&quot; and noticed that DeMent was playing in town and thought her name was beautiful and then decided to name it after her.

She sang four duets with John Prine on his 1999 album &quot;In Spite of Ourselves&quot;, including the title track. She appeared in the 2000 film &quot;Songcatcher&quot;, playing the character Rose Gentry and singing on the soundtrack as well. Her duet with Ralph Stanley on &quot;Ridin&#x27; That Midnight Train&quot; was the opening track on his 2001 album, &quot;Clinch Mountain Sweethearts: Ralph Stanley &amp; Friends&quot;.

In 2004 she released &quot;Lifeline&quot;, an album of gospel songs. It included 12 covers and one original composition (&quot;He Reached Down&quot;). It was the first album she released on Flariella Records, a label she started herself and named after her mother. A shortened version of her rendition of &quot;Leaning on the Everlasting Arms&quot; was later used in the closing credits of the Coen brothers&#x27; film &quot;True Grit&quot;. On October 2, 2012, DeMent released her first album of original songs in 16 years, &quot;Sing the Delta&quot;.

DeMent has sung duets with Steve Earle and Emmylou Harris and is featured on the albums of many other performers. She sang the Merle Haggard song &quot;Big City&quot; on &quot;Tulare Dust: A Songwriters&#x27; Tribute to Merle Haggard&quot;. She has made frequent appearances on Garrison Keillor&#x27;s radio show &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot;. DeMent contributed harmony vocals to &quot;Pallbearer&quot;, a song from country artist Josh Turner&#x27;s 2012 album &quot;Punching Bag&quot;.

In 2015, DeMent released &quot;The Trackless Woods&quot;, an album based upon and inspired by the words of Russian poet Anna Akhmatova, on her own Flariella record label. She reunited with John Prine in 2016 for his second duets album &quot;For Better, or Worse&quot; and performed on two tracks. DeMent received the Americana Trailblazer Award at the 2017 Americana Music Honors &amp; Awards.

DeMent&#x27;s 2023 album Workin&#x27; on a World was No. 4 on Robert Christgau&#x27;s Dean&#x27;s List for that year.

==Personal life==
DeMent was married to Elmer McCall in 1991. The marriage ended in divorce in 1999.

She married singer-songwriter Greg Brown on November 21, 2002. They live in rural southeast Iowa with their daughter, whom they adopted at the age of six in 2005 from Russia.

<text>The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran (, &quot;Qanun-e Asasi-ye Jomhuri-ye Eslâmi-ye Iran&quot;) is the supreme law of Iran. It was adopted by referendum on 2 and 3 December 1979, and went into force replacing the Constitution of 1906. It has been amended once, on 28 July 1989. The constitution was originally made up of 175 articles in 12 chapters, but amended in 1989 to 177 articles in 14 chapters.

It has been called a hybrid regime of theocratic and democratic elements. Articles One and Two vest sovereignty in God, and Article Six &quot;mandates popular elections for the presidency and the Majlis, or parliament.&quot; Main democratic procedures and rights are subordinate to the Guardian Council and the Supreme Leader, whose powers are spelled out in Chapter Eight (Articles 107–112).

==History==

Over the course of the year 1978 Iran was subject to worsening cycles of &quot;provocation, repression, and polarization&quot; in political unrest. It became more and more clear that the Pahlavi regime was likely to fall and that the leader of the revolution taking his regime down was Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Work began on a constitution for the new Islamic state that would follow the revolution. A preliminary draft was (according to Asghar Schirazi) begun in Paris by one Hassan Habibi while Khomeini was still in exile there. It was structured like the 1958 constitution of the French Fifth Republic with separation of powers among the executive, judicial and parliamentary branches. An outline was presented to Khomeini in January 1979 and he brought it with him when he returned to Iran. After being reworked by two different commissions, it was published on 14 June 1979 by the provisional government of Mehdi Bazargan as the official preliminary draft of the constitution.

The preliminary draft differed from the final version of the constitution in a number of ways. It made no reference to &quot;velayat-e faqih&quot;, and did not &quot;reserve any special posts for Islamic jurists&quot; except on the guardian council where they made up a minority and were to be approved by the parliament from a list drawn up by the &quot;highest religious authorities&quot;.

Despite this, Khomeini made &quot;only two small changes (in part to bar women from the presidency and judgeships)&quot;, in the draft, and publicly stated his approval of the draft &quot;on more than one occasion&quot;, declaring at one point that it &quot;must be approved quickly&quot;. 
The Council of the Islamic Revolution approved of it unanimously after examination and &quot;declared it to be the official preliminary draft of the Revolutionary Council&quot;.

What happened next is disputed. The revolutionaries&#x27; original plan was to have a Constituent Assembly of hundreds of people write the new constitution, but with this broad support for the preliminary draft, there now seemed to be a consensus in favor of a much more streamlined completion. An &quot;Assembly of Experts&quot; of only a few dozen members would go over the text and &quot;present it for final ratification in a national referendum&quot;.

But Baqer Moin writes of contradictions in statements by Khomeini and questions about the election of the Experts. At the same time Ayatollah was publicly declaring the draft to be `correct`, he &quot;had already started to denounce the supporters of a `Democratic Islamic Republic,` whose ideas were enshrined in the draft&quot;, and who included the man he had appointed president, Bazargan, as `enemies of Islam.` Also dismaying Bazargan and his colleagues, was the decision by the clerical members of the Revolutionary Council, without consulting them, to have the constitution finalized by a much smaller body—an `Assembly of Experts` with 70 members, which alarmed them because with much larger constituencies and fewer candidates &quot;it would be easier to rig the elections&quot;. If Khomeini&#x27;s network succeeded in doing so, &quot;the likelihood of dissenting voices in the Assembly could be reduced to almost nothing&quot;.

During a joint summit between the members of the provisional government and the Superieur Council of Revolution with the presence of Khomeini in Qom, it was decided that an Assembly for the Final Review of the Constitution was to be established for a final evaluation of the constitution of Iran.

===Assembly of Experts===
The assembly members were voted on in the summer of 1979. Out of the &quot;72 delegates whose election was officially recognized, 55 were clerics&quot;, almost all of them following &quot;the line of the Imam&quot;, i.e. Khomeini loyalists. (Other delegates were from different minorities of religions, scientists, Athletes.)

Schirazi writes that Khomeini then announced that the job of &quot;determining whether or not&quot; the constitution was &quot;in conformity with Islamic requirements&quot; was &quot;exclusively reserved for revered jurists&quot;, to the surprise of those outside his network. Also at odds with previous statements was that instead of quickly approving the draft, the Assembly for the Final Review of the Constitution (dominated by Khomeini supporters) rewrote it, adding a Guardian Jurist (&quot;wali-e faqih&quot;) leader with powers over other branches of government, and significantly increasing the power of the Council of Guardians. (The offices of the President and the Prime Minister were retained for the executive branch of government from the French model.)

A different version of events comes from Shaul Bakhash, who writes that Khomeini and his supporters accepted the preliminary draft but were provoked by an &quot;opposition determined to establish a secular state&quot;. 
A secularist group calling itself a &quot;Seminar on the People&#x27;s Expectations from the Constitution&quot;, called for changes in the draft: &quot;a ceremonial president, supremacy of parliament, independent judiciary, individual rights, and equal rights for women, proposed making the universal declaration of Human Rights part of the constitution, more decentralization, and `democratization` of the army&quot;. This led &quot;Khomeini to spur the Islamic groups to counterattack&#x27;, telling his supporters that the determination of whether articles of the constitution meet Islamic criteria `lies within the exclusive jurisdiction of the leading Islamic jurists,` and non-jurists should not get involved.
&quot;It quickly became clear to Khomeini and his lieutenants that there existed considerable support and no mass opposition to the doctrine and that the constitution could serve to institutionalize both the supremacy of the faqih and clerical rule.&quot; The idea that Khomeini &quot;should be entrusted with supreme authority under the constitution&quot; was brought up by provincial clerics in the Assembly and was quickly embraced by the Assembly.

The assembly worked for sixty-seven sessions and in four rounds. The first round was considered with a preliminary evaluating of principles. The second round considered with providing principles in groups. The third round dealt with approbation of principles and the fourth round with investigation of all collection of principles.

According to a legal bill of council of revolution, the draft was put to a vote through a referendum, with voters given the option of voting yes or no. On 2–3 December 1979 Iranians voted, and the official result was over 99% in favor. (The vote was boycotted by some secular, leftist and Kurdish groups; and total of 15,578,956 votes was almost 5 million less than the earlier referendum for an Islamic Republic.)

===1989 Amendments===

On 24 April 1989, Ayatollah Khomeini issued a decree convening an Assembly for Revising the Constitution. It made several changes in the constitution, in Articles 5, 107, 109, 111, eliminating the need for the Supreme Leader to be a Marja&#x27; chosen by popular acclaim. It made permanent the Expediency Discernment Council to work out disagreements between the Parliament and Council of Guardians, and eliminated the post of Prime Minister. The amendment concerning qualifications for the Supreme Leader is thought to have been introduced and approved because no marja&#x27; had given strong support for Khomeini&#x27;s policies. The amendments were approved by the voting public on 28 July 1989 (in same election as Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani was elected to the first of two terms as President of Iran).

==Islamic principles==
===Velayat-e Faqih===
While liberal and leftist values are present in the constitution, the overriding both are &quot;the values, principles and institutions of an ideal Islamic society&quot;, The Ayatollah Khomeini&#x27;s concept of &quot;Velayat-e Faqih&quot;, i.e. Guardianship or rule of the Islamic Jurist, is enshrined in several places in the constitution. One example is the section &quot;Method of Governance in Islam&quot; in the preamble, where it is stated In case the term ‘righteous’ is ambiguous, a later section of the Preamble (Guardianship of the Jurist) states
Article 109, stipulates that the Leader must possess the &quot;scholarship, as required for performing the functions of mufti in different fields of fiqh&quot;, i.e. only a high level cleric of Islamic law may be the Leader. Article 113 states the Leader is the highest public official in Islamic Republic of Iran. The Head of Judiciary, who has considerable power (Establishing the organizational structure of the Judiciary, Drafting judiciary bills for parliament, hiring, dismissing, transferring judges) must be an Islamic legal cleric (&quot;mujtahid&quot;); as must be the President of the Supreme Court, the Attorney General (Article 162), and six out of the twelve members of the
Guardian Council who are appointed by the Leader (Article 91) and have the power to veto legislation from the parliament that they believe does not conform to sharia (Article 96).

===Sharia===
Hassan Vakilian cites Article 4:
 as evidence &quot;Sharia laws and principles&quot; (&quot;Islamic criteria&quot; in the article above) &quot;must be considered as a main source of the legal order&quot; in the constitution. Sharia is referred to numerous times in the constitution but often by another terms (as it is above): 
*In the Preamble: &quot;Islamic principles&quot;, &quot;Islamic rules&quot;, &quot;Islamic standards&quot;, &quot;Islamic program&quot;, &quot;Rules of Islamic codes&quot;, &quot;Islamic ordinances and regulations&quot;;
*In articles 110, 147, 151, 167, 171, 175 and 177 &quot;Islamic criteria&quot;. 
*Other terms used are &quot;Islamic law&quot; (Article 45), &quot;Islamic ordinances&quot; (Article 91), &quot;Islamic regulations&quot; (Article 107), &quot;Norms and principles of Islamic justice&quot; (Article 14), &quot;Principles and commandments of official religion&quot; (Article 85), &quot;Principles of Sharia&quot; (Article 112), &quot;Criteria of Fiqh&quot; (Article 163), &quot;Islamic sources and authentic fatwa&quot; (Article 167).

==Preamble==
The preamble or introduction of the constitution touches on (its version of) events leading up to the revolution and on key features of the new Islamic regime:

How the &quot;anti-despotic movement for constitutional government [1906–1911], and anti-colonialist movement for the nationalization of petroleum&quot; in the 1950s failed &quot;due to departure from genuine Islamic positions&quot;; a matter rectified by the &quot;authentically Islamic and ideological line&quot; under the leadership pursued under the leadership of Grand Ayatollah Khomeini.

How the movement dawned in June 1963 with &quot;the devastating protest by Imam Khomeini against the American conspiracy known as the &#x27;White Revolution&#x27;&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
The plan of Islamic government set forth by Imam Khomeini known as &quot;governance of the faqih&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
The fury of the Iranian people at a January 7, 1978 newspaper article insulting Imam Khomeini.&lt;br&gt;
The &quot;watering&quot; of the &quot;sapling&quot; of the revolution &quot;by the blood of 60,000 martyrs&quot;.&lt;br&gt; How 98.2% of voters approved of Iran becoming an Islamic Republic.

Our nation &quot;intends to establish the ideal and model society&quot; with the final goal of &quot;movement toward God&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
Governance by the &quot;just faqih&quot; will prevent deviation of the government from essential Islamic duties.&lt;br&gt;
The economy in Islam will be &quot;a means not an end&quot;, providing work, &quot;suitable opportunities&quot;, &quot;essential needs&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
The family is &quot;the fundamental unit of society&quot; within which women will recover their &quot;precious function of motherhood&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
The Army and Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps are responsible not only for guarding the country but for &quot;fulfilling the ideological mission of jihad in God&#x27;s path&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
The judicial system will be based on Islamic justice.
The executive branch will implement &quot;the laws and ordinances of Islam&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
&quot;Mass communications media&quot; will diffuse Islamic culture and refrain from anti-Islamic &quot;qualities&quot;.

The &quot;central axis&quot; of the theocracy shall be Quran and hadith, and as framed by the Assembly of Experts for Constitution, who hope that &quot;this century will witness the establishment of a universal holy government and the downfall of all others.&quot; (See also: Mahdi and Mohammed al-Mahdi)

==Chapter I [Article 1 to 14]: General principles==
Some of the more important articles of the constitution are described below:

===Article 1 (Form of government)===
The form of Government in Iran is that of an Islamic Republic following the Islamic revolution led by Grand Ayatollah Khomeini, affirmed by the referendum of Farvardin 9 and 10.

===Article 2 (Foundation)===
The Islamic Republic is a system based on the belief in:
# One God (as stated in the phrase &quot;There is no god except Allah&quot;), who has exclusive sovereignty and right to legislate, and whose commands must be submitted to;
# the fundamental role of divine revelation in setting forth the laws;
# the return to Allah after death and resurrection, and the constructive role of this belief has in the course of man&#x27;s ascent toward Allah;
# the justice of Allah in creation and legislation;
# continuous leadership and perpetual guidance, and its fundamental role in ensuring the uninterrupted process of the revolution of Islam;
# the exalted dignity and value of man, and his freedom coupled with responsibility before God; in which equity, justice, political, economic, social, and cultural independence, and national solidarity are secured by recourse to:
::# continuous Ijtihad of Islamic jurists possessing necessary qualifications, exercised on the basis of the Quran and the Sunnah of the prophet Muhammad;
::# sciences and arts and the most advanced results of human experience, together with the effort to advance them further;
::# negation of all forms of oppression, both the infliction of and the submission to it, and of dominance, both its imposition and its acceptance.

===Article 3 (State goals)===
The duty of the Islamic Republic is to direct all of its resources to a number of goals. 
# Support of faith and piety and struggle against vice and corruption
# Raising of public awareness through the proper use of the mass media and press
# Free education
# Free physical training
# Strengthening advanced scientific research
# The elimination of imperialism and foreign influence
# The elimination of despotism, autocracy and monopoly
# Ensure social and political freedoms within the law
# The end to all forms of undesirable discrimination
# The elimination of unnecessary governmental organizations
# Universal military training
These goals were designed to emphasize positive liberty.

Some of the goals are put in context of the requirements of Islam. For example:
:# The planning of a correct and just economic system
:# The expansion of Islamic brotherhood among all peoples
:# The creation of the government&#x27;s foreign policy

===Article 4 (Islamic Principle)===
All laws and regulations &quot;absolutely and generally&quot; must be based on Islamic criteria. Enforcing this will be the Islamic jurists (fuqaha&#x27;) and the Council of Guardians.

====Constitution compared to traditional Islam====
Olivier Roy points out that traditionally sharia was the &quot;sole foundation for the judicial norm&quot;, not constitutions which were secular. Khomeini himself specifically affirmed the preeminence of the Islamic state over sharia in January 1989 when he publicly dressed down the future Supreme Leader Ali Khamanei, pronouncing the opposite.
===Article 5 (Religious leader&#x27;s office)===
During the occultation of the Twelfth Imam, the &quot;Ummah&quot; (Islamic community) must be led by a just and pious, courageous, resourceful &quot;faqih&quot; (Islamic jurist) knowledgeable about affairs of the day, in accordance with Article 107.

===Article 12 (Official religion)===
&quot;The official religion of Iran is Islam&quot;—specifically of the Twelver Shi&#x27;ism in Usul al-Dîn and of the Ja&#x27;farî school in fiqh, -- &quot;and this principle will remain eternally immutable.&quot;

===Article 13 (Recognized religious minorities)===

The Leader elected by the Experts shall assume the Wilayat-ul Amr and all the responsibilities arising from it. The leader shall be equal before the law to the rest of the people of the country.

====Background and comments====
Before the 1989 amendments to the constitution, Article 107 called for the leader to be someone who was &quot;accepted as a marja&#x27; and Leader by a decisive majority of the people&quot;, and if such a person could not be found, to appoint a &quot;leadership council&quot; made up of marja&#x27; In his book &quot;Islamic Government: Guardianship of the Jurist&quot;, Khomeini had argued that &quot;only the most senior religious jurists -- not just any cleric -- had the scholastic expertise and the educational training to fully comprehend the intricacies of Islamic jurisprudence.&quot; According to historian Ervand Abrahamian, the original constitution also declared that &quot;the leadership clauses, especially those stipulating that ultimate authority resides in the senior religious jurists [marja&#x27;], were to endure until the Mahdi, the Lord of the Age, reappears on earth.&quot;

They were amended nonetheless because the Assembly of Experts that would choose the next leader knew &quot;well that the senior jurists distrusted their version of Islam&quot;, i.e. Khomeini and his supporters interpretation of Islam. Abrahamian argues that this &quot;unwittingly undermined the intellectual foundations&quot; of the jurist&#x27;s roll as guardian. Another scholar (Olivier Roy) called the change &quot;an end to the logic of the Islamic revolution&quot; for the same reason.

===Article 108===
During the first term, the law specifying the number and qualifications of the Experts and the manner of their election, as well as the Internal Statute regulating their meetings, shall be prepared and ratified by the majority of votes of the fuqaha of the first Shura-ye Negahban, and then approved by the Leader of the Revolution.

<text>Flumazenil (also known as flumazepil, code name [[List of pharmaceutical compound number prefixes|Ro]] 15-1788) is a selective GABAA receptor antagonist administered via injection, otic insertion, or intranasally. Therapeutically, it acts as both an antagonist and antidote to benzodiazepines (particularly in cases of overdose), through competitive inhibition.

It was first characterized in 1981, and was first marketed in 1987 by Hoffmann-La Roche under the trade name Anexate. However, it did not receive FDA approval until December 20, 1991. The developer lost its exclusive patent rights in 2008; so at present, generic formulations of this drug are available. Intravenous flumazenil is primarily used to treat benzodiazepine overdoses and to help reverse anesthesia. Administration of flumazenil by sublingual lozenge and topical cream has also been tested.

==Medical uses==
Flumazenil benefits patients who become excessively drowsy after use of benzodiazepines for either diagnostic or therapeutic procedures.

The drug has been used as an antidote in the treatment of benzodiazepine overdoses. It reverses the effects of benzodiazepines by competitive inhibition at the benzodiazepine (BZ) recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. There are many complications that must be taken into consideration when used in the acute care setting. These include lowered seizure threshold, agitation, and anxiousness. Flumazenil&#x27;s short half-life requires multiple doses. Because of the potential risks of withdrawal symptoms and the drug&#x27;s short half-life, patients must be carefully monitored to prevent recurrence of overdose symptoms or adverse side effects.

Flumazenil is also sometimes used after surgery to reverse the sedative effects of benzodiazepines. This is similar to naloxone&#x27;s application to reverse the effect of opiates and opioids following surgery. Administration of the drug requires careful monitoring by an anesthesiologist due to potential side effects and serious risks associated with over-administeration. Likewise, post-surgical monitoring is also necessary because flumazenil can mask the apparent metabolization (&quot;wearing off&quot;) of the drug after removal of patient life-support and monitoring equipment.

Flumazenil has been effectively used to treat overdoses of non-benzodiazepine hypnotics, such as zolpidem, zaleplon and zopiclone (also known as the &quot;Z-drugs&quot;).

It may also be effective in reducing excessive daytime sleepiness while improving vigilance in primary hypersomnias, such as idiopathic hypersomnia.

The drug has also been used in hepatic encephalopathy. It may have beneficial short‐term effects in people with cirrhosis, but there is no evidence for long-term benefits.

The onset of action is rapid, and effects are usually seen within one to two minutes. The peak effect is seen at six to ten minutes. The recommended dose for adults is 200 μg every 1–2 minutes until the effect is seen, up to a maximum of 3 mg per hour. It is available as a clear, colourless solution for intravenous injection, containing 500 μg in 5 mL. Additional doses may be needed within 20 to 30 minutes if evidence of oversedation reappears.

Many benzodiazepines (including midazolam) have longer half-lives than flumazenil. Therefore, in cases of overdose, repeated doses of flumazenil may be required to prevent recurrent symptoms once the initial dose of flumazenil wears off.

It is hepatically metabolised to inactive compounds which are excreted in the urine. Individuals who are physically dependent on benzodiazepines may experience benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, upon rapid administration of flumazenil.

It is not recommended for routine use in those with a decreased level of consciousness.

In terms of drug enforcement initiatives, diversion control programs and required post-marketing surveillance of adverse events, orders for flumazenil may trigger a prescription audit to the search for benzodiazepine misuse and for clinically significant adverse reactions related to their use.

===PET radioligand===
Radiolabeled with the radioactive isotope carbon-11, flumazenil may be used as a radioligand in neuroimaging with positron emission tomography to visualize the distribution of GABAA receptors in the human brain.

===Treatment for benzodiazepine dependence &amp; tolerance===
Epileptic patients who have become tolerant to the anti-seizure effects of the benzodiazepine clonazepam became seizure-free for several days after treatment with 1.5 mg of flumazenil. Similarly, patients who were dependent on high doses of benzodiazepines (median dosage 333 mg diazepam-equivalent) were able to be stabilised on a low dose of clonazepam after 7–8 days of treatment with flumazenil.

Flumazenil has been tested against placebo in benzodiazepine-dependent subjects. Results showed that typical benzodiazepine withdrawal effects were reversed with few to no symptoms. Flumazenil was also shown to produce significantly fewer withdrawal symptoms than saline in a randomized, placebo-controlled study with benzodiazepine-dependent subjects. Additionally, relapse rates were much lower during subsequent follow-up.

In vitro studies of tissue cultured cell lines have shown that chronic treatment with flumazenil enhanced the benzodiazepine binding site where such receptors have become more numerous and uncoupling/down-regulation of GABAA has been reversed. After long-term exposure to benzodiazepines, GABAA receptors become down-regulated and uncoupled. Growth of new receptors and recoupling after prolonged flumazenil exposure has also been observed. It is thought this may be due to increased synthesis of receptor proteins.

Flumazenil was found to be more effective than placebo in reducing feelings of hostility and aggression in patients who had been free of benzodiazepines for 4–266 weeks. This may suggest a role for flumazenil in treating protracted benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms.

Low-dose, slow subcutaneous flumazenil administration is a safe procedure for patients withdrawing from long-term, high-dose benzodiazepine dependency. It has a low risk of seizures even amongst those who have experienced convulsions when previously attempting benzodiazepine withdrawal.

In Italy, the gold standard for treatment of high-dose benzodiazepine dependency is 8–10 days of low-dose, slowly infused flumazenil. One addiction treatment centre in Italy has used flumazenil to treat over 300 patients who were dependent on high doses of benzodiazepines (up to 70 times higher than conventionally prescribed) with physicians being among the clinic&#x27;s most common patients.

==Pharmacology==
Flumazenil, an imidazobenzodiazepine derivative, antagonizes the actions of benzodiazepines on the central nervous system. Flumazenil competitively inhibits the activity at the benzodiazepine recognition site on the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex. It also exhibits weak partial agonism of GABAA receptor complexes that contain α6-type monomers; the clinical relevance of this is unknown.

Flumazenil does not antagonize all of the central nervous system effects of drugs affecting GABA-ergic neurons by means other than the benzodiazepine receptor (including ethanol, barbiturates, and most anesthetics) and does not reverse the effects of opioids. It will however antagonize the action of non-benzodiazepine z-drugs, such as zolpidem and zopiclone, because they act via the benzodiazepine site of the GABA receptor - it has been used to successfully treat z-drug overdose.

===Pharmacodynamics===
Intravenous flumazenil has been shown to antagonize sedation, impairment of recall, psychomotor impairment and ventilatory depression produced by benzodiazepines in healthy human volunteers.

The duration and degree of reversal of sedative benzodiazepine effects are related to the dose and plasma concentrations of flumazenil.

== Availability ==
Flumazenil is sold under a wide variety of brand names worldwide like Anexate, Lanexat, Mazicon, Romazicon. In India it is manufactured by Roche Bangladesh Pharmaceuticals and USAN Pharmaceuticals.

<doc id="855343" wikidata="Q1188918" url="?curid=855343" title="Siam Shade">
<text>Siam Shade (stylized as SIAM SHADE) was a five-piece Japanese rock band, formed in Tokyo in 1991. The classic line-up of Hideki on vocals, Natchin on bass, Kazuma and Daita on guitar, and Jun-ji on drums broke onto the visual kei scene alongside a multitude of other artists in the early 1990s and enjoyed a decade of relative popularity. After disbanding in early 2002, the members have reunited several times since 2007 for one-off concerts and short tours. &quot;OK Music&quot; described the band&#x27;s sound as melodic hard rock with flashy twin guitar riffs, and wrote that their greatest strength lies in the interplay between &quot;sweet vocals&quot; and &quot;colorful metal sounds&quot;. Outside Japan, Siam Shade is best known for &quot;1/3 no Junjō na Kanjō&quot;, which was the sixth ending theme of the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; anime. Daita&#x27;s work on their song &quot;Triptych&quot; was named the 83rd best guitar instrumental by &quot;Young Guitar Magazine&quot; in 2019.

==History==

===1989–2002: Formation and career===
In March 1989, high school friends Hideki (then known as &quot;Chack&quot;) and Natchin (then spelled &quot;Natin&quot;) formed a band called Power. They won the Summer Grand Prix Award at that year&#x27;s Yokohama High School Hot Wave Festival. However, due to many member changes, including the brief enrollment of guitarist Daita, Power disbanded. After befriending guitarist Ataru, singer Hideki and bassist Natchin formed a new band with him called Atæru in 1991.

In 1992, the members met Love Jets vocalist Kazuma at a talent show, and later recruited him as guitarist. Drummer A completed the lineup and Atæru began touring, playing small clubs and local venues. They changed their name in 1993, settling on Siam Shade. The band released a free demo tape on May 1, shortly after which Ataru left. In July, Hideki and Natchin called on their former schoolmate and one-time band member Daita to fill in the lead guitar slot. The group distributed the single &quot;Doll&quot; in December 1993. The band became close with Luna Sea, with Ryuichi Kawamura promoting Siam Shade in 1994 by playing their demo tape on his radio show.

Siam Shade had another small lineup change in 1994 when A left the band and was replaced by Jun-ji in May, solidifying the group&#x27;s final lineup. Jun-ji was a roadie for Luna Sea drummer Shinya Yamada. At the end of the year, the band released their first self-titled album. In 2004, it was named one of the top albums from 1989-1998 in an issue of the music magazine &quot;Band Yarouze&quot;.

In August 1995, the band performed a solo concert at Shibuya Public Hall. Two months later, Siam Shade released their major label debut single &quot;Rain&quot; on Sony Music Entertainment Japan. Their second album &quot;Siam Shade II&quot; followed in November. For its follow-up, October 1996&#x27;s &quot;Siam Shade III&quot;, the band worked with David Bianco as mixing engineer. According to &quot;OK Music&quot;, the album brought aggressive guitar to the forefront of their sound and successfully combines 1980s L.A. metal and &quot;kayōkyoku&quot;-like melodies. The band burst into the mainstream in late 1997 when &quot;1/3 no Junjō na Kanjō&quot;, a single from their latest album &quot;Siam Shade IV&quot;, was selected as an ending theme for the &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; anime series. The song&#x27;s popularity led to increased ticket sales, concert DVDs, and television appearances.

The band continued to release albums and DVDs throughout the decade. On December 28, 2001, they performed at the Nippon Budokan for the first time. However, just one month later, the band announced that they would be disbanding. Siam Shade&#x27;s ten-year career came to an end with a Nippon Budokan concert on March 11, 2002. Later that month, they released the box set &quot;Siam Shade X&quot;, which compiles all of their previous major label releases.

===Post-Siam Shade activities===
After the disbandment Hideki quickly begin his solo career. In 2003, he joined the band Acid, before leaving in 2006 to focus on his solo career again. However, in 2007 he formed Detrox with KAZ (Sads) and they released a large amount of material before going on hiatus after their show on April 18, 2012.

Kazuma also started his solo career after the disbanding. In 2003, he performed a duet with Vivian Hsu, &quot;Moment&quot;, which was used as the second opening theme to the anime &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;. He has also played support guitar for Anna Tsuchiya and Damijaw (solo project of Janne Da Arc member Ka-yu).

Daita started a solo career, wrote the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Volcano High&quot;, and played support guitar for Kyosuke Himuro. In 2005 he formed the band Binecks. In 2012, he formed the American-based band Broken Arrow with vocalist Nik Frost, who sang on the Siam Shade Tribute album.

Natin, now going by the stage-name &quot;Natchin&quot;, has a solo career and in 2008 formed the band Big Bites with Anchang (Sex Machineguns) and Annie (The Yellow Monkey).

Junji has a solo career, was support drummer for Takanori Nishikawa a.k.a. TM Revolution, and in 2008 formed the band Bull Zeichen 88. He is also a regular support member for Acid Black Cherry.

===2007–present: Reunions===
Siam Shade held a reunion concert, titled Heart of Rock, on November 18, 2007 at the Nippon Budokan, in honor of their manager who died the previous April. The band stated that the reunion was a one-off event, and would not pave the way for a new single or album release.

On October 27, 2010 a tribute album to Siam Shade was released, &quot;Siam Shade Tribute&quot;. It is composed entirely of Western artists such as Sebastian Bach, Richie Kotzen, Mike Vescera and George Lynch. Siam Shade&#x27;s song &quot;1/3 no Junjō na Kanjō&quot; was covered by Nogod on the compilation &quot;Crush! -90&#x27;s V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-&quot;, which was released on January 26, 2011 and features current visual kei bands covering songs from bands that were important to the &#x27;90s visual kei movement. &quot;Glacial Love&quot; was covered by Guild on its sequel, &quot;Crush! 2 -90&#x27;s V-Rock Best Hit Cover Songs-&quot;, that was released on November 23, 2011.

On April 29, 2011, Siam Shade announced on their new website, which went online on the same day, that they would reunite once again. This time for a free concert on July 17 at Zepp Sendai, entitled Siam Shade Spirits ~Return The Favor~, &quot;to bring hope&quot; to the victims of the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami. A second concert was held on October 21 at Saitama Super Arena. The band released the album &quot;Siam Shade Spirits 1993&quot; on April 14, 2012, which includes their entire first album, the new &quot;opening&quot; track called &quot;Light For Closed Your Eyes&quot; and two previously unreleased songs from their indie years.

The group released their first new song in 12 years &quot;Still We Go&quot; digitally on September 18, 2013, with a limited physical release following the next month. Siam Shade performed their first nationwide tour in 12 years at the end of 2013, titled Heart of Rock 7. The three date tour began on October 27 at Saitama Super Arena and went to Zepp Nagoya on November 11, before ending on November 12 at Zepp Namba.
Siam Shade performed at the first night of Luna Sea&#x27;s Lunatic Fest at Makuhari Messe on June 27, 2015. In celebration of the 20th anniversary since their major label debut, the group held The Abiding Belief concert at Saitama Super Arena on October 18, 2015. The six date The Ultimate Fight Series tour continued the celebration and took place in February 2016 at various Zepp venues. The anniversary celebration ended with three Final Road Last Sanctuary concerts in October 2016; the Osaka International Convention Center on the tenth, the Nakano Sun Plaza Hall on the fifteenth, and the last taking place on the twentieth at the Nippon Budokan.

On November 4, 2024, a message was posted on Natchin&#x27;s official website that revealed he, Hideaki, Kazuma and Jun-ji had amicably settled a lawsuit they filed against Daita in 2019. It further stated that although all five will officially be members of Siam Shade, it would become common for the four of them to perform without Daita. Two weeks later, it was announced that Siam Shade would hold a joint live with Sophia to commemorate the 30th anniversary of their debuts; both bands made their major label debuts in October 1995. It was held at Osaka-jō Hall on February 9, 2025, under the title 1995 Siam Sophia-G, with the &quot;G&quot; referring to Garage Sale; a comedy duo who also debuted the same year and who served as hosts of the event. The concert garnered an audience of 8,000, and saw the four-member lineup of Siam Shade supported by Vivid guitarist Reno.

<text>The black imported fire ant (&quot;Solenopsis richteri&quot;), or simply BIFA, is a species of ant in the genus &quot;Solenopsis&quot; (fire ants). It was long thought to either be a subspecies or a color variation of &quot;Solenopsis invicta&quot; (the red imported fire ant, or simply RIFA), but is now recognized as its own species with a demonstratively different range and living habits. BIFA seem to be more tolerant of cold and a less dominant species than RIFA. Due to the BIFA higher body content of water than the RIFA conclusions demonstrate the certain factor plays a role in their differences of living regions.  

The species is native to South America, but has been introduced to North America. In the United States, the official assessment is that BIFA are limited to extreme northeastern Mississippi, northwestern Alabama and a few southern counties in Tennessee, though this may reflect underestimation of their range. As of April 2013 their range has been found as far north as the tidewater area of Virginia, and as of July 2016 they have been reported near coastal South Carolina. Since the 2013 records, this species has been collected in NE Arkansas in several Craighead County localities. These collections are presumably the result of recent landscaping of new construction projects.

All stings of imported fire ants will produce a sterile pustule that is helpful in distinguishing them from the stings or bites of other insects. Pustules are surrounded by reddened swelling (wheal) with the redness (erythema) extending beyond (flare). The extent of reaction to imported fire ant stings is variable depending on the quantity of allergic (IgE) antibodies an individual has already formed. There may also be differences in the venom from the two species that result in more pronounced wheal and flare formation after stings from BIFA.

<doc id="855350" wikidata="Q6545520" url="?curid=855350" title="Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous">
<text>Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous is an American television series that aired in syndication from 1984 to 1995. The show featured the extravagant lifestyles of wealthy entertainers, athletes, socialites and magnates.

== Cast and crew ==
The show was hosted by Robin Leach for the majority of its run. Leach was joined by Shari Belafonte in 1994. At her request, in order to &quot;bring the show into the &#x27;90&#x27;s&quot;, the show was renamed Lifestyles with Robin Leach and Shari Belafonte. After Belafonte left in 1995, the show was simply retitled &quot;Lifestyles.&quot;

Voice-over artist David Greenspan (aka David Perry) provided narration for most of the segments during the bulk of the show&#x27;s run and could be heard whenever Leach did not appear on camera. Upon Greenspan&#x27;s death in 1991, various voice-over artists took over narration duties, including Les Marshak and Charlie O&#x27;Donnell. 

The theme song, titled &quot;Come with Me Now&quot; and performed by Bill Conti, is from a 1978 film called &quot;Five Days from Home&quot;.

==Synopsis==
&quot;Lifestyles&quot; was created by Al Masini (also credited with Solid Gold, Entertainment Tonight, and Star Search)&quot;.&quot; It was one of the first shows to feature the lives of the wealthy, largely intended to be an insight into the opulent residences and the glamorous lifestyles of those it profiled. However, many of the geographic areas it covered were also ideal destinations for vacations, and in his on-camera appearances, Leach indirectly made references to resorts and tourist attractions. Greenspan, as narrator, made more direct references to such resorts and such tourist attractions. 

Leach ended each episode with a wish for his viewers that became his signature catchphrase, &quot;champagne wishes and caviar dreams.&quot; 

&quot;Lifestyles&quot; originally aired in syndication from 1984-1995. ABC aired re-edited segments of the show, along with some new footage, at 11:00 A.M. (EST) during its daytime schedule from April 7 to June 13, 1986, and from June 30 to September 5, 1986. It was replaced on the daytime schedule by its spinoff, &quot;Fame, Fortune and Romance&quot;, which ran until May 1987.

&quot;Lifestyles&quot; was Emmy nominated for &quot;Outstanding Informational Special&quot; in 1984.

==Spinoff==
&quot;Lifestyles&quot; had two companion spinoff series. One was &quot;Runaway with the Rich and Famous&quot;, also hosted by Leach. &quot;Runaway&quot; focused on taking viewers on vacations with celebrities to exotic foreign locations. The series also aired in first-run syndication, from 1986 to 1994. There was also &quot;Fame, Fortune and Romance&quot;, broadcast on ABC from 1986 to 1987.

==Rebooted ==
In 2013, the Style Network was going to reboot &quot;Lifestyles of The Rich and Famous&quot; but did not move forward when the network was later rebranded the Esquire Network. In 2014, a source said that a new version of &quot;Lifestyles&quot; would be remade for NBC, hosted by Nick Cannon. Unlike the original, this version would have mostly focused on Cannon&#x27;s point of view as well as featured profiles of the mega-rich. This version would also have featured tech billionaires, who were quickly becoming the new face of wealth; it was said that philanthropic efforts would also be covered. Cannon said that &quot;Robin Leach passed the torch to me, now I&#x27;m producing and hosting the new &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;&quot;; he also said &quot;You know what? I think rich and famous people take themselves too seriously, I&#x27;m gonna be just like I am on this show &quot;America&#x27;s Got Talent&quot;. I&#x27;ll be like, what the hell? Gold toilet seats? Let&#x27;s pop bottles!&quot; The idea was later scrapped.

==Merchandise==
A board game called &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous: The Game&quot; was released by Pressman Toy Corporation in 1987.

A video slot machine was made by IGT in 2002.

==Parodies==

* An episode of the second season of &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot; titled &quot;Lifestyles of the Fat and Furry&quot; had Garfield winning the lottery and being featured on the titular program. At the end though, Garfield loses his fortune because he was underage (he was 11 years old at the time the episode aired), and the winnings are given to the Robin Leach look-alike (played by Robin Leach himself), who is thrilled that he can now &quot;stop hosting this stupid program and talking in this stupid voice!&quot;
* In several episodes of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, the &quot;Lifestyles&quot; program would be spoofed a few times by Harry Shearer as Robin Leach in &quot;Lifestyles of the Relatives of the Rich and Famous&quot;. Another more exaggerated parody of Leach would be made a few years on SNL by Dana Carvey where his Leach character would exclaim &quot;I&#x27;m yelling and I don&#x27;t know why!&quot;
*Sergio Aragones often parodied the show in his cartoon drawings, namely in MAD Magazine (other &quot;MAD&quot; artists and writers targeted Leach and the show as well), but Aragones, like Antonio Prohias, managed to do so without words. One such Aragones cartoon showed a live taping of &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot; suddenly interrupted by a homeless woman and children requesting food and clothing, much to the surprise of the shocked camera men.
*Cryptic Slaughter&#x27;s song &quot;Death styles of the Poor &amp; Lowly&quot;, from the 1990 album &quot;Speak Your Peace&quot;, criticized the show and included a mocking imitation of Robin Leach.
*Rapper Big L titled his 1995 debut album &quot;Lifestylez ov da Poor &amp; Dangerous&quot;.
*Rapper Ice-T included a song called &quot;Lifestyles Of the Rich and Infamous&quot; on his 1991 album O.G. Original Gangster.
*Genie (voiced by Robin Williams) featured a parody of the show in the beginning of &quot;Aladdin and the King of Thieves&quot;, calling it &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Magical&quot;.
* This line is included in the song Piece Of Me by Britney Spears, where she sings &quot;I&#x27;m Mrs. Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot; in the chorus
* Rap group Lost Boyz had the hit &quot; Lifestyles of the Rich and Shameless&quot;
* The cartoon &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; parodized the show as &quot;Lifestyles of the Pink and Famous&quot;, in the episode &quot;This Little Piggy Went to Hollywood&quot;.
* The TV series &quot;Dinosaurs&quot; parodized the show as &quot;Lifestyles of Those We Envy&quot;.
* The TV series &quot;Sesame Street&quot; parodized the show in a sketch called &quot;Lifestyles of the Big and Little&quot; with host, Dicky Tick.
* The cartoon &quot;Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog&quot; had a show-in-episode entitled &quot;Lifestyles of the Sick and Twisted&quot;.
* An episode of the cartoon &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; featured Babs and Buster Bunny as presenters of a show called &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Rotten&quot;. They were supposed to interview Montana Max, but he had snubbed them, so they mainly used the show as a way to torment him.
* A song by Tracy Byrd titled &quot;Lifestyles of the Not So Rich and Famous&quot;.

<text>The Little Harpeth River is a tributary of the Harpeth River in Tennessee, just south of Nashville. Via the Harpeth, Cumberland, and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed.

The Little Harpeth rises in Williamson County, Tennessee near the community of Clovercroft. From there it flows north-northwest, entering and largely draining the Nashville suburb of Brentwood, where it crosses the golf course belonging to the local country club. The Brentwood area marks where the stream begins a largely west-northwest course. Crossing into Davidson County, it passes Edwin Warner Park, one of the largest municipal parks in the Southern United States, and provides a lovely setting for some of the picnic areas. From there, it flows into the main Harpeth River (colloquially called the &quot;Big Harpeth&quot;) near the Bellevue area of Nashville. Its major tributaries are Beech Creek and Otter Creek, which is impounded several miles above its confluence with the Little Harpeth to form Radnor Lake, the focal point of Radnor Lake State Natural Area.

<text>The false stag beetles (Diphyllostoma) are a group of three species of rare beetles known only from California. Almost nothing is known of their life history beyond that the adults are diurnal and females are flightless; larvae have not been observed.

Their length ranges from 5 to 9 mm; bodies are elongate, with a generally dull brown to reddish-brown color. Both body and legs are covered with longish hairs.

Originally classed with the Lucanidae, &quot;Diphyllostoma&quot; have a number of characteristics not shared with any other type of stag beetle, and so in 1972 Holloway proposed a separate family Diphyllostomatidae, which has since been accepted.

A possible close relative has been reported from mid-Cretaceous aged Burmese amber in Myanmar, dating to around 100 million years ago.

<doc id="855364" wikidata="Q2514214" url="?curid=855364" title="Cheating in online games">
<text>On online games, cheating subverts the rules or mechanics of the games to gain an unfair advantage over other players, generally with the use of third-party software. What constitutes cheating is dependent on the game in question, its rules, and consensus opinion as to whether a particular activity is considered to be cheating.

Cheating is present in most multiplayer online games, but it is difficult to measure. Various methods of cheating in online games can take the form of software assistance, such as scripts and bots, and various forms of unsporting play taking advantage of exploits within the game. The Internet and darknets can provide players with the methodology necessary to cheat in online games, with software often available for purchase.

As methods of cheating have advanced, video game publishers have similarly increased methods of anti-cheating, but are still limited in their effectiveness. Punishments for cheaters also have various forms, with legal measures also being taken against those who create or use cheats. While some countries include laws that prohibit and punish cheating, video game companies have a history of citing copyright infringement in lawsuits against cheaters.

==Bots and software assistance==
===Aimbots and triggerbots===
An aimbot or autoaim is a type of computer game bot most commonly used in first-person shooter games to provide varying levels of automated target acquisition and calibration to the player. They are sometimes used along with a triggerbot, which automatically shoots when an opponent appears within the field-of-view or aiming reticule of the player.

Aimbotting relies on each player&#x27;s client computer receiving information about all other players, whether they are visible from the player&#x27;s position or not. Targeting is a matter of determining the location of any opponent relative to the player&#x27;s location and pointing the player&#x27;s weapon at the target. This targeting works regardless of whether the opponent is behind walls or too far away to be seen directly.

Some servers allow inactive players to spectate, watching the game from the viewpoints of the active players. Recording of gameplay actions is also often possible. If someone was using a targeting aimbot, the bot would be obvious to the spectator as unnatural exact position tracking. Some aimbots and triggerbots attempt to hide from spectators the fact they are being used through a number of methods, such as delaying firing to hide the fact it shoots the instant an opponent is in the cheater&#x27;s crosshair. Some triggerbot programs can be easily toggled on and off using the mouse or keyboard.

Cheat suites may incorporate these in addition to other features, including adjustments to extrasensory perception, move speed, ammo count, and player radar. Neophytes may colloquially define these suites as aimbot programs.

===Artificial lag/lag switch===
In the peer-to-peer gaming model, lagging is what happens when the stream of data between one or more players gets slowed or interrupted, causing movement to stutter and making opponents appear to behave erratically. By using a lag switch, a player is able to disrupt uploads from the client to the server, while their own client queues up the actions performed. The goal is to gain advantage over another player without reciprocation; opponents slow down or stop moving, allowing the lag switch user to easily outmaneuver them. From the opponent&#x27;s perspective, the player using the device may appear to be teleporting, invisible or invincible, while the opponents suffer delayed animations and fast-forwarded game play, delivered in bursts. Some gaming communities refer to this method as &quot;tapping&quot; which refers to the users &quot;tapping&quot; on and off their internet connection to create the lag.

The term &quot;lag switch&quot; encompasses many methods of disrupting the network communication between a client and its server. One method is by attaching a physical device, called a hardware lag switch, to a standard Ethernet cable. By flipping the switch on and off, the physical connection between the client and the server is disrupted. The designers of video game console hardware have started to introduce built-in protection against lag switches in the form of voltage detectors, which detect a change in voltage when the switch is flipped. Some manufacturers have taken counter measures to bypass or trick this detector. This can also be achieved by simply unplugging the Ethernet cord going to the client, causing a disruption in the player&#x27;s internet connection. Other methods, called a software or wireless lag switch, involve using a computer program. In this method, the cheater runs an application on a computer connected to the same network as the client. The application hogs the network bandwidth, disrupting the communication between the client and its server. However, one cannot do this for an unlimited amount of time. At some point, if no traffic is being received, most game clients and/or game servers will decide that the connection has been lost and will remove the player from the game. In some P2P games, it can result in all players lagging or being disconnected from the game.

Simpler methods are firewall or router rules that apply bandwidth shaping and network latency, a cheat is able to adjust limits on both bandwidth and latency to stay relevant to a P2P network yet have considerable advantage over other players.

===Look-ahead===
Look-ahead cheating is a method of cheating within a peer-to-peer multiplayer gaming architecture where the cheating client gains an unfair advantage by delaying their actions to see what other players do before announcing its own action.

A client can cheat using this method by acting as if it is suffering from high latency; the outgoing packet is forged by attaching a time-stamp that is prior to the actual moment the packet is sent, thereby fooling other clients into thinking that the action was sent at the correct time, but was delayed in arrival. A partial solution is the lockstep protocol.

===World-hacking===
World-hacking is a method or third-party program that enables a user to exploit bugs and to view more of a level than intended by the developer.

A common aspect of real-time strategy games is the player&#x27;s partial limitation or complete inability to see beyond the visibility range of individual game objects that are under their ownership (typically units and structures); this concept is controlled by a mechanism known as the fog of war. World-hacking usually enables the user to bypass this mechanism, either by removing it entirely and/or by rendering objects through the fog that would not normally be visible. In multiplayer modes, this allows for a distinct advantage against the other players who are subject to the intended settings. The advantage gained can be substantial, especially for the average real-time strategy games that rely on the rock paper scissors dynamic to balance out individual objects&#x27; varying strengths and weaknesses.
World-hacking may also allow a player to see through solid or opaque objects and/or manipulate or remove textures, to know in advance when an opponent is about to come into targeting range from an occluded area. This can be done by making wall textures transparent, or modifying the game maps to insert polygonal holes into otherwise solid walls. This variation is commonly known as a &quot;wallhack&quot; since it basically allows to the player to see enemies through walls.

World-hacking relies on the fact that an FPS server usually sends raw positional information for all players in the game, and leaves it up to the client&#x27;s 3D renderer to hide opponents behind walls, in plant foliage, or in dark shadows. If the game map rendering could be turned off completely, all players could be seen moving around in what appears to be empty space. Complete map hiding offers no advantage to a cheater as they would be unable to navigate the invisible map pathways and obstacles. However, if only certain surfaces are made transparent or removed, this leaves just enough of an outline of the world to allow the cheater still to navigate it easily.

Asus released wireframe display drivers in 2001 that enabled players to use wallhacks, announcing the settings as &quot;special weapons&quot; that users could employ in multiplayer games. In a poll by the Online Gamers Association, 90% of its members were against the release of the drivers.

==Unsporting play==

===Boosting / Win trading===

Players will set up multiple accounts to play against each other. Usually, the primary account will be allowed to win through a deliberate lack of resistance from the secondary account(s) due to those accounts being unplayed or those players agreeing to lose. Some players will reverse roles between games, giving each account an equal win–loss record.

===Disconnecting===
In games where wins and losses are recorded on a player&#x27;s account, a player may disconnect when they are about to lose in order to prevent that loss from being recorded. This is usually done by activating known in-game glitches or through third-party sources via &quot;IP booting&quot; (a feature of firewall software). Some players do this if they feel their opponent is being unfair.
Some games implement a disconnection penalty, usually by recording the disconnect as a loss, a deduction of experience, or even Elo points. Certain games also have a &#x27;disconnect delay&#x27; period before the player can disconnect that can last 10–30 seconds. This prevents a player from instantly disconnecting if they are about to die or lose. In some games, if a player disconnects they can receive a warning or even get locked out of online play for a short period.

===Rapid Fire Modifications (Macros)===
In many games, weapons can be fired in burst fire or single shot fire modes. Modifying a controller or keyboard/mouse to gain the advantage of having a faster firing weapon than the standard player can be considered a method of cheating. These modifications can create an imbalance within the game. In addition to modifying a console or its controller, it is possible to achieve a similar effect on the PC by binding the firing button to the scroll wheel of a mouse, or by using a macro setting that will simulate rapid key presses automatically. However, most games limit the rate at which weapons can be fired, regardless of how fast a player presses the button, in order to limit this form of cheating.

===Exploits===

Exploiting is the application of an unintended feature or bug that gives the player an advantage not intended by the game design. Exploiting is generally considered cheating by the gaming community at large due to the unfair advantage usually gained by the exploiter. Most software developers of online games prohibit exploiting in their terms of service and often issue sanctions against players found to be exploiting. There is some contention by exploiters that exploiting should not be considered cheating as it is merely taking advantage of actions allowed by the software. Some players view exploiting as a skill because certain exploits take a significant amount of time to find, or dexterity and timing to use.

===Farming===
The term farming may refer to the practice of garnering achievements or virtual property for the purpose of real-money-trading. With rare exception, this has no direct effect on the gaming experience of other players; instead, it is a violation of most EULAs and could devalue the virtual property being farmed.

===Twinking===

Twinking is the act of transferring gear intended for higher level characters to lower level characters that would be incapable of obtaining the gear on their own. Twinked characters have a huge advantage over non-twinked characters, as well as the rest of the game world. This is usually used by players who wish to create a new character, either to help them level more rapidly or to gain an unfair advantage in PvP (&quot;i.e.&quot; player versus player, a type of multiplayer interactive conflict). Most MMORPGs tolerate it, provided that the twinked character is not used in PvP combat against non-twinked characters. Often limits on twinking are placed into the game, usually through strict level or stat requirements to equip the item. Circumventing these level requirements would then be further cheating.

===Ghosting===
Most games allow other participants to observe the game as it is played from a variety of perspectives; depending on the game, perspectives allow an observer a map overview or attach a &quot;camera&quot; to the movement of a specific player. In doing so, the observer can communicate with an accomplice using a secondary communication methodology (in-game private message, third party communication, or even off-line) to inform friendly players of traps or the position of opponents. An observer can be an active player, using a separate computer, connection and account.

Some systems prevent inactive players from observing the game if they are on the same IP address as an active player, on the grounds that they are probably in close physical proximity; when all players from a single IP address are no longer active participants, they are all allowed to observe. However, this restriction can be easily evaded if there are multiple IP addresses available at one location (a common feature of broadband subscriptions), or if the observer installs remote desktop software on their computer, thus enabling their computer screen to be viewed by select other players in real time.

Additionally, this may be used against players livestreaming to platforms like Twitch to observe the player and their team&#x27;s position and stats. This is often referred to as stream sniping.

===Stacking===
Stacking involves altering game settings or team lineups to give one or more teams an unfair advantage over others. One example includes arranging a team composed of skilled or professional players against a team with members of lesser skill. Less ethical rigging involves weighting the game by providing a player or team with an advantage by outfitting them with better (or more familiar) weapons or equipment, or creating a play field that caters to a certain player, team or playing style. Many games prevent this by preventing players from joining a team with more players than the opposing side, forcing newcomers to balance the teams.

===Scripting===
Scripting is the use of a program or game feature to automate certain actions or behaviors. The use of scripts may or may not be considered cheating, depending on the behavior involved, and whether said behaviour is replicable without the use of such script. A script may give the user unusually fast firing rate, unobtainable otherwise, or may perform seemingly trivial tasks such as reloading. Some scripts can also tamper with other players&#x27; systems by spoofing commands.

==Implementation of cheats==
In the client–server model, the server is responsible for information security and enforcing game rules. (See &quot;Anti-cheating methods and limitations&quot; below for drawbacks.) In the peer-to-peer gaming model, clients run equal code but are still subject to most of the same type of cheats found in the client–server multiplayer model; however, the peer-to-peer multiplayer model has been deprecated in favor of the client–server model with the wider adoption of high-speed networks.

&quot;Never trust the client&quot; is a maxim among game developers (as well as other developers) that summarizes the model of client–server game design. It means that no information sent from a client should be accepted by a server if it breaks the game rules or the basic mechanics of the game, and that no information should be sent to a client unless it is &quot;need-to-know.&quot; For example, a server with no rule enforcement or data integrity checking will synchronize all of the clients with all of the information about all of the other clients. The server will be very fast, but any wallhack program will reveal where all the players in the game are, what team they are on, and what state they are in — health, weapon, ammo etc. At the same time, altered and erroneous data from a client will allow a player to break the game rules, manipulate the server, and even manipulate other clients.

===Game code modification===
Many cheats are implemented by modifying game software, despite EULAs which forbid modification. While game software distributed in binary-only versions makes it harder to modify code, reverse engineering is possible. Also game data files can be edited separately from the main program and thereby circumvent protections implemented in software.

===System software modification===
Rather than modifying the game code (which the game itself or a 3rd-party protection system may detect), some cheats modify underlying system components. An example of this is graphics driver modifications that ignore depth checking and draw all objects on the screen—a primitive wallhack. System or driver modification is harder to detect, as there are a large number of system drivers that differ from user to user.

===Packet interception and manipulation===
The security of game software can be circumvented by intercepting and/or manipulating data (divided into &quot;packets&quot;) in real-time while in transit from the client to the server or vice versa (i.e. a man-in-the-middle attack). Interception can be passive or result in active manipulation; either method can be performed on the client machine itself or via an external communication proxy; some aimbots incorporate this method.

=== Third-party hardware peripherals ===
Some computer and console devices sold under the guise of &quot;accessibility peripherals&quot; have been used to gain unfair advantages over other players of games, such as eliminating recoil completely and boosting aim assistance, and some may even include additionally downloadable macros.

Some games use different pools for matchmaking purposes, for instance, PC players are matched with other PC players, and console players are matched with other console players. A console peripheral allowing the use of mouse and keyboard can be used to trick the console system to provide additional aim assistance provided to controllers.

==Anti-cheating methods and limitations==
There are many facets of cheating in online games which make the creation of a system to stop cheating very difficult; however, game developers and third-party software developers have created or are developing technologies that attempt to prevent cheating. Such countermeasures are commonly used in video games, with notable anti-cheat software being BattlEye, GameGuard, PunkBuster, Valve Anti-Cheat (specifically used on games on the Steam platform), and EasyAntiCheat.

Exploits of bugs are usually resolved/removed via a patch to the game; however, not all companies force the patches/updates on users, leaving the actual resolution to individual users.

===Authoritative and mirrored server design===
Generally, the better the server is at enforcing the rules, the less of a problem cheating will be in the game. In this approach all client functionality either runs purely on the game server or alternatively the game server mirrors the client gameplay and continuously validates the game state. In many mobile games, it is a common practice to run the client game sessions synchronously on the server, using exactly the same user input. The client session is reset when the game sessions become unsynced, thereby preventing cheating.

Server-side game code makes a trade-off between calculating and sending results for display on a just-in-time basis or trusting the client to calculate and display the results in appropriate sequence as a player progresses. It can do this by sending the parts of the world state needed for immediate display, which can result in client &quot;lag&quot; under bandwidth constraints, or sending the player the entire world state, which results in faster display for the player under the same bandwidth constraints, but exposes that data to interception or manipulation—a trade-off between security and efficiency.

When game servers were restricted by limited available resources such as storage, memory, internal bandwidth, and computational capacity due to the technologies available and the cost of the hardware, coupled with internet connections that were slow, it was believed to be necessary to compromise on security for optimization to minimize the impact on the end-user. Today however, with the increased speed and power of multi-core computers, lower-priced hardware, and the increased availability of broadband internet, this has become less of an issue.

===Software obfuscation===
Additionally to storing data in non-standard formats, some games also utilize runtime protection through software protectors. The key target is to keep attackers from directly inspecting or modifying compiled software. Protectors utilize any of three methods to protect software.

Encryption solutions will encrypt the code instructions and typically use a multi–layered defense mechanism against any reversing or tampering attempts that target the decryption code directly. Most protection systems in this category encrypt the code and then decrypt it at the application&#x27;s startup or during runtime. This is the moment at which an attacker will breakpoint, reverse, and inject custom code. Runtime decryption may also add significant processing overhead and lower the game&#x27;s framerate. Alternatively, some solutions focus on obfuscating the code by inserting jump statements and seemingly random instruction paths. The final and strongest alternative is virtualization. In this approach the encrypted code runs on a virtual CPU that can be markedly different from generic x86 and x64 CPUs as the command set can be unique for each protected file.

The shared weakness of protectors and virtualizers is that they impact performance, either by requiring decryption or by introducing unnecessary CPU instructions. To reduce the overhead code virtualizers are often only used to secure the critical parts of the code base, such as those interfacing with the game state and rendering.

===Player supervision===
Spectator functionality can allow server administrators to monitor individual players and thereby determine whether or not a cheat is in place. One risk of the spectator mode is that in competitive matches the spectator could abuse the mode for spying on specific players and communicating player positions and tactics to the opposing team. Some games get around this limitation by not allowing spectator mode at all, or by delaying the video feed.

Some games have systemized player supervision by allowing the community to review reports of disruptive behavior, determine whether those reports are valid, and apply temporary bans if appropriate. Reports can include data such as screenshots, videos, and chatlogs.

===Anomaly detection===
Anomalies in player behavior can be detected by statistically analyzing game events sent by the client to the server. The benefit is that this anti–cheat method is non–intrusive to the player&#x27;s privacy and guaranteed to work on all end–user system configurations. The restriction of this method is that it cannot always be clear whether or not a player is cheating. Highly skilled players can for example develop such a map sense that they may end up being flagged for the use of a wallhack and/or aimbot. On the other hand, players may also cheat in a way that is under the detection thresholds and remain uncaught.

To reduce the amount of false positives, statistical detection systems are often combined with a supervision system that either is community driven or managed by a professional administrator team. In such implementations unusual player behavior can trigger a client-side component to create and upload reports for review.

===Pattern detection===
Pattern detection systems scan the player&#x27;s hard drives and system memory for known cheat code or programs. Compared to statistical detection the key advantage is that also the subtle cheaters are detected. Other than this, a pure pattern detection approach generally has few advantages. Experience has shown that keeping detection-based systems up to date is relatively slow and labor-intensive as one needs to constantly track down cheats and update detection patterns. End–users may also be concerned with privacy issues, such as has been the case with VAC (Valve Anti-Cheat) accessing browsing history.

===Sandboxing===
Sandboxing a software process can protect against potentially malicious actions such as code injection and memory modifications that would otherwise tamper with the game. One of the key benefits of sandboxing is that it can effectively prevent the underlying cheat mechanisms from working, and thereby can avoid the need for banning game community members as cheats simply do not work. Additionally, strong prevention mechanisms can stop many game hackers from targeting the game because of elevated skill requirements. Compared to pattern detection systems, sandboxing is generally not privacy invasive, as the approach requires no data to be uploaded to foreign back-end systems.

===System incompatibility===
Anti-cheat software commonly use low-level system interfaces not intended by the OS vendor for public use. As a result, they are a common source of incompatibilities with newer versions of operating systems and security measures as well as alternative OS API implementations such as Wine. For example, Windows enables Hypervisor-protected Code Integrity (HVCI) by default in every market except Chinese and Korean installations due to anti-cheat compatibility issues.

=== Third-party hardware detection ===
With the additional scrutiny directed towards the rising popularity of the third-party peripherals being used to gain unfair advantages in competitive games, game developers such as Bungie and Activision started cracking down on the users of these peripherals, with Activision updating its RICOCHET cheat detection software to detect such devices, while Bungie has just announced that while they are fine with using peripherals for the sake of genuine accessibility, they are ready to take countermeasures if they detect players using these devices to gain unfair advantages. 

==Penalties for cheating==
Game publishers can implement a wide array of consequences for cheating players.

===Banning players===
Some game publishers may decide to try to permanently ban players who are persistent in cheating and ruining the game community. Such bans are typically placed based on hardware ID or IP address. Consequently, cheaters may develop ways of getting around these bans, by either playing through proxy or VPN servers, or spoofing or changing their hardware configuration.

Some companies and leagues ban suspected cheaters by blacklisting specific installation or serial keys, or user accounts, meaning that the player is effectively prevented from playing the game online. Certain games are known to identify cheaters and &quot;shadow ban&quot; them by placing them in matchmaking with other cheaters only, so as not to let the cheaters know that they have been identified.

While game publishers are known to ban players employing cheats, the actual number of players banned is usually not revealed. Exceptions to this include Blizzard Entertainment, Nexon, and CipSoft, known for banning cheaters in batches, and publicising the number of banned accounts, presumably in order to discourage others from cheating.

===Suspension===
In some cases a ban may not be permanent and will expire after a certain period of time. Suspensions are commonly used as a punitive measure for abuse of game glitches, harassing players, or benefiting from hacks. Temporary bans may also be utilized in case a violation cannot be fully proven, as is common with anti-cheating methods based on supervision or statistical detection.

===In-game kick===
In general kicking is perceived as a mild punishment, serving as a warning for the player in question. Some anti-cheat systems may decide to kick players out of a game server when the system integrity cannot be enforced nor be determined with certainty. Other anti-cheat methods may also utilize kicks as an instant punishment for presumably unfair game play behavior.

Some games may also provide the community with the option of voting for particular players to be kicked. Such a system provides the power to self-regulate and effectively get rid of abusive players without depending on supervision or other anti-cheat methods. Even though vote kicking brings many benefits, it may also serve as a tool for trolling or griefing by allowing for legitimate players to be removed out of the game through the voting process.

===Demotion===
When a violation is the result of farming or stat-padding, it may be too severe of a punishment to suspend or ban players. Some games, therefore, implement a system of demotion in which the offender is moved to a lower rank (demoting), the opposite of a promotion.

===Progress-removal===
In several games where points are used, if a player is caught cheating they will get their score reset to the base value that is applied when a new player joins the server.

==Legal measures==
In recent years, countries including South Korea and China have criminalized the sale or use of cheats in video games. In South Korea, cheaters could be punished with up to 5 years in jail or fines exceeding $40,000. The presence of cheaters in online games may push away the legitimate playerbase and reduce overall profits in the industry, leading to game developers working with legislative bodies or enforcement agencies.

Historically, some game companies have also taken legal measures against individuals that have created and sold cheating tools in video games as a means to curb their use. Anti-cheat experts have argued that it is particularly important to take legal steps against entities who profit from making and selling cheats. In April 2013, coder DrUnKeN ChEeTaH was sued by Nexon America for operating GameAnarchy, a popular subscription based cheat provider for &quot;Combat Arms&quot;, and lost, Nexon being awarded $1.4M in damages. In January 2017, Riot Games successfully sued the LeagueSharp service, which offered a subscription-based hacking service for Riot&#x27;s &quot;League of Legends&quot;, with a $10 million award to be paid to Riot. Blizzard Entertainment sued Bossland GMBH for distributing software hacks for several of its games, and was awarded $8.5 million in damages. Epic Games, producers of the battle royale game &quot;Fortnite&quot; have sued two cheaters partnered with AddictedCheats, who offer cheating services for a variety of online games. Bungie had sued AimJunkies for cheats related to &quot;Destiny 2&quot;. Parts of their claims were settled via arbitration with Bungie being awarded $4.3 million, but a jury trial found for Bungie on copyright infringement claims, and while Bungie was awarded around $60,000 based on revenue made by AimJunkies, it was the first time that a jury trial had ruled on cheat software for video games, potentially setting future case law for further challenges.

Often, game company lawsuits against cheaters or cheat providers cite copyright infringement as the reason for the lawsuit. While some argue against the merit of this claim, grounds for copyright infringement include damaging the company&#x27;s intellectual property, affecting the experience of other users, and circumventing the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), which could be applied to video games.

<text>The Little Emory River rises in Morgan County, Tennessee near the town of Coalfield. It is one of the major tributaries to the Emory River. It crosses into Roane County, where it soon becomes an embayment of Watts Bar Lake several miles upstream of its mouth into the Emory. (Watts Bar Lake is a relatively deep reservoir and causes &quot;slack water&quot; conditions many miles up several Tennessee River tributaries, not just the main stream.)

<doc id="855374" wikidata="Q61453" url="?curid=855374" title="Kurd Lasswitz">
<text>Kurd Lasswitz (; 20 April 1848 – 17 October 1910) was a German author, scientist, and philosopher. He has been called &quot;the father of German science fiction&quot;. He sometimes used the pseudonym &quot;Velatus&quot;.

== Biography ==
Lasswitz studied mathematics and physics at the University of Breslau and the University of Berlin, and earned his doctorate in 1873. He spent most of his career as a teacher at the Ernestine Gymnasium in Gotha (1876–1908).

== Works ==
His first published science fiction story was (&quot;To the Zero Point of Existence&quot;, 1871), depicting life in 2371, but he earned his reputation with his 1897 novel , which describes an encounter between humans and a Martian civilization that is older and more advanced. The book has the Martian race running out of water, eating synthetic foods, travelling by rolling roads, and utilising space stations. His spaceships use anti-gravity, but travel realistic orbital trajectories, and use occasional mid-course corrections in travelling between Mars and the Earth; the book depicted the technically correct transit between the orbits of two planets, something poorly understood by other early science fiction writers. It influenced Walter Hohmann and . The book was not translated into English until 1971 (as &quot;Two Planets&quot;), and the translation is incomplete. was his most successful novel. A story from Lasswitz&#x27;s served as the basis for &quot;The Library of Babel&quot;, a short story by Jorge Luis Borges.

His last book was (&quot;Star Dew: the Plant of Neptune&#x27;s Moon&quot;, 1909). He is also known for his 1896 biography of Gustav Fechner.

For his writing (totalling around 420 works including non-fiction), Lasswitz has been called &quot;the first utopistic-scientific writer in Germany&quot; or even &quot;a German Jules Verne&quot;.

A crater on Mars was named in his honour, as was the asteroid 46514 Lasswitz.

There also is the , an award for German-speaking as well as foreign authors of science fiction since 1981.

<doc id="855375" wikidata="Q3251415" url="?curid=855375" title="List of Major League Baseball mascots">
<text>This is a list of current and former Major League Baseball mascots, sorted alphabetically.

The tradition in the Major League Baseball mascot began with Mr. Met, introduced for the New York Mets when Shea Stadium opened in 1964. Although some mascots came and went over time, the popularity of mascots increased when the San Diego Chicken started independently making appearances at San Diego Padres games in 1977. Philadelphia Phillies management felt they needed a mascot similar to the Chicken, so they debuted the Phillie Phanatic in 1978.

All but three major-league teams have &quot;official&quot; mascots (Dodgers, Yankees, and Angels). Seven team mascots – Sluggerrr (Kansas City Royals), the San Diego Chicken, the Phillie Phanatic, Mr. Met, the Oriole Bird, Slider (Cleveland Guardians), Southpaw (Chicago White Sox), and most recently, Orbit (Houston Astros) – have been inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame. Several others have been nominated since the Hall&#x27;s creation in 2005.

Mascots in MLB are often used to help market the team and league to young children.

== Current mascots ==
=== Ace (Toronto Blue Jays) ===
Ace is the official mascot of the Toronto Blue Jays. He, along with his female counterpart, &quot;Diamond&quot; replaced former mascot BJ Birdie before the 2002 season as a mascot duo. Like his predecessor, Ace is a large anthropomorphic blue jay. The mascot&#x27;s name is baseball slang for a team&#x27;s top starting pitcher (the &quot;ace&quot; of the staff, such as former Blue Jays pitcher Roy Halladay).

In 2004, Ace became the sole mascot of the team after Diamond was removed by the Blue Jays prior to the start of the season. In 2011, Blue Jays fans were introduced to his younger brother Junior (see below).

=== Barrelman (Milwaukee Brewers) ===
Barrelman (aka &quot;Owgust&quot; and &quot;Beer Barrel Man&quot;), is an auxiliary mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers. He originated from a logo used by the original minor league Milwaukee Brewers of the American Association from the 1940s to 1952. He was resurrected and upgraded to be a costumed performing character in 2015. Before then, he was only used as an official logo image, and, since 1977, only appearing on special materials.

=== Baxter the Bobcat (Arizona Diamondbacks) ===
Baxter the Bobcat is the mascot of the Arizona Diamondbacks. His full name is D. Baxter the Bobcat, and he became the mascot in 2000. The mascot was created by Brantley Bell, the son of Jay Bell, one of the players on the Diamondbacks 1998 inaugural season roster. Brantley came up with the name from two sources. &quot;D. Baxter&quot; comes from the team&#x27;s nickname, &quot;the D-Backs&quot;. The bobcat is from the original name of the stadium where the Diamondbacks play. Today called Chase Field, it was once called Bank One Ballpark, or informally as &quot;BOB&quot; for short. The bobcat is a wild cat native to Arizona.

=== Bernie Brewer (Milwaukee Brewers) ===
Bernie Brewer is the official mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers. The Bernie Brewer character became the team&#x27;s mascot in 1973, appearing as a cheerful man with a big mustache. A beer-barreled chalet was built for him inside the stadium where he led the crowd cheering. Following each home run and every victory by the Brewers, he would slide down and plunge himself into a huge beer mug in celebration. He was joined by a companion Bonnie Brewer, who would playfully swat at the backside of the opposing team&#x27;s third base coach with a broom as the field crew swept the base paths.
Bernie Brewer was a fixture at Brewers home games until 1984, when the Brewers re-built the bleachers at Milwaukee County Stadium, replacing the chalet with a sound tower and sending Bernie into retirement. By popular demand, Bernie Brewer came out of his retirement in 1993, when the fans voted for his return. Bernie was brought back not as just a mustachioed man in lederhosen, but a full-body costume of a man, including large foam head. The chalet was then rebuilt (it had been in storage on the third base side under the box seats) above the left-center field bleachers. The original beer mug that Bernie used to slide into is still in Milwaukee, Wisconsin as part of the Lakefront Brewery, Inc. tour.

In 2001, Bernie moved to American Family Field, and today the old chalet has become known as &quot;Bernie&#x27;s Dugout&quot;, stationed above the left field bleachers, where he cheers on for the team during home games. Currently he slides down a plastic yellow slide, no longer into a vat of beer but onto a platform in the shape of home plate when a Brewer hits a home run, while a sign tower with Bob Uecker&#x27;s trademark home run call (&quot;Get up, get up, get outta here, GONE!!&quot;) lights up above the Dugout, and he waves the team flag after landing in the bottom platform. When American Family Insurance bought the naming rights of the stadium, the dugout became &quot;Bernie&#x27;s Chalet&quot;, which pays homage to the old Milwaukee County Stadium chalet.

=== Billy The Marlin (Miami Marlins) ===
Billy The Marlin is the official mascot of the Miami Marlins. Resembling a marlin with limbs, he can be seen at every Marlins home game. He competes in a waterboat race, which is an animated video shown on the screen, during each game. The name, picked by original team owner Wayne Huizenga, is derived from the fact that a marlin is a billfish, and Huizenga wanted a name that was different from the baseball type names of other mascots (like Slider and Sluggerrr) and one that children could remember more easily. On Mother&#x27;s Day and Father&#x27;s Day, Billy is joined by his parents, Bill Sr. and Betty the Marlin. Billy is also seen at games dancing with kids on the field in between innings and making special appearances in the Fan Zone.

On Opening Day of 1997, the year the Marlins won their first World Series Championship, a Navy SEAL who was parachuting into Hard Rock Stadium (then known as Pro Player Stadium) as Billy, lost the head in mid-air. While the crowd was unaware of the problem, media outlets had been alerted to Billy&#x27;s parachute entrance. When he did not arrive, the media ran with the story, getting national attention and leading to ESPN&#x27;s Dan Patrick&#x27;s nightly quote, &quot;Bring me the head of Billy the Marlin!&quot;

The original Billy The Marlin was John Routh, who spent 10 years (1993–2002) entertaining Marlins fans. Routh previously portrayed the University of Miami mascots, Sebastian the Ibis and The Miami Maniac from 1983 to 1993, and prior to that, Cocky for the University of South Carolina Gamecocks.

=== Blooper (Atlanta Braves) ===

Since opening day 2018, Blooper has served as the current official mascot of the Atlanta Braves. He, too, has a Twitter account and is present in community events in the Atlanta area and around all of Georgia. Usually wearing a Braves jersey, he is unique for wearing goggles with the uniform and the hat.

=== Clark (Chicago Cubs) ===
On January 13, 2014, the Chicago Cubs announced that Clark, a &quot;young, friendly Cub&quot;, would become the team&#x27;s first official mascot in modern history. Clark was named after Clark Street, since the Cubs home field, Wrigley Field, is famously located at &quot;Clark and Addison&quot;.

=== D-backs Luchador (Arizona Diamondbacks) ===
The D-backs Luchador is the second mascot of the Arizona Diamondbacks. After a giveaway of masks in June 2012 proved popular, the team introduced the Luchador as a permanent character in July 2013. He wears a black cape, red pants, and a mask patterned after the team&#x27;s logo. Meant to represent the team&#x27;s Hispanic fans, the Luchador also wrestles with Club Deportivo Coloseo at the Glendale Park and Swap.

=== Dinger (Colorado Rockies) ===

Dinger is the official mascot of the Colorado Rockies. He is an anthropomorphic purple triceratops. The choice of a dinosaur, specifically this type, was inspired by the discovery of some fossilized bone fragments which were found during the construction of the Rockies stadium Coors Field. The fossils included part of a rib, believed to be from a triceratops. His name &quot;Dinger&quot; is one of many slang terms for a home run.

Dinger is often seen on the field before and after the game and roaming around the stadium during the game. When Rockies hitters are at bat in the late innings of a game, he often dances in the seats immediately behind home plate in an effort to distract opposing pitchers, sitting down only immediately before the beginning motion of each pitch.

Dinger works year-round promoting physical fitness and literacy for thousands of elementary school students in the Rocky Mountain Region. He acts out his own Dinger Story for the kids. He also makes appearances at Children&#x27;s Hospital Colorado and Denver Health. He makes appearances at Rockies events including the 5K Home Run, and the Rockies Rookies Kids Fan Club. He is a purple dinosaur with a Rockies jersey on with black sneakers and a Rockies cap.

=== DJ Kitty (Tampa Bay Rays) ===
DJ Kitty is one of three mascots for the Tampa Bay Rays. DJ Kitty comes from the Internet sensation of a kitty playing a DJ System and dancing to the music. The black and white cat wears a Tampa Bay Rays ring, wears chains, and wears his Rays hat backwards. DJ Kitty became an official mascot for the Rays in 2012. The Tampa Bay Rays&#x27; other official mascots are Raymond and Stinger.

=== Fredbird (St. Louis Cardinals) ===

Fredbird is the official mascot for the St. Louis Cardinals. He is an anthropomorphic cardinal wearing the team&#x27;s uniform. A person dressed up as Fredbird can often be found entertaining young children during baseball games at Busch Stadium. His name is derived from &quot;Redbird&quot;, a synonym for the cardinal bird and for the Cardinals themselves.

Fredbird was introduced in 1979 by the Cardinals, then owned by Anheuser-Busch, to entertain younger fans at the games. He quickly became popular with fans for his dancing, habit of &quot;beaking&quot; the heads of supporters, and for throwing T-shirts into the stands. In later years, he has been joined by &quot;Team Fredbird&quot;, a group of young women employed by the club who help him with his T-shirt toss and occasionally in other duties.

=== Gapper (Cincinnati Reds) ===
Gapper is one of the current mascots for the Cincinnati Reds. He was first introduced as the furry companion to Mr. Red, the long-time mascot in the winter of 2002 as the franchise was preparing to move to their new home, Great American Ball Park. The mascot was created by David Raymond&#x27;s Raymond Entertainment Group, the founder being the man inside the Phillie Phanatic costume from 1973 to 1993. A young fan won two season tickets for submitting the winning name; he is named after the &quot;gap&quot; in the stands in the seats of Great American, which provides a view into and out of the stadium. The term &quot;gapper&quot; is also a slang phrase for a batted ball which falls into the &quot;gap&quot; between outfielders (generally a ball hit to either left-center or right-center field which rolls to the fence). According to a recent Cincinnati.com poll of the Red&#x27;s four mascots, he is the least popular amongst fans. He received 6% of the voting, Mr. Red received 23%, Rosie Red received 34%, and Mr. Redlegs received 47%. Like his fellow mascots he wears a Reds jersey, but with a backwards cap.

=== Junior (Toronto Blue Jays) ===
Junior is the younger brother of Ace. He made his mascot debut in 2011. He is half the size of Ace and wears the number 1/2. He only appears on Jr. Jays Sundays (formerly on Saturdays, prior to the 2018 season).

=== Lou Seal (San Francisco Giants) ===

Lou Seal is the official mascot of the San Francisco Giants. &quot;Born&quot; on July 25, 1996, Luigi Francisco Seal has been a regular part of all Giants home games, as well as numerous events in San Francisco and around the United States, ever since. Although his name (a play on the name &quot;Lucille&quot;) is a bit ambiguous, he is indeed &quot;officially&quot; male and the person inside the costume is a man. Lou Seal is also a reference to the San Francisco Seals, the baseball club that was a mainstay of the Pacific Coast League from 1903 until 1957.

In a contest held by the Giants where fans were asked for ideas, six people submitted the name &quot;Lou Seal&quot;. These lucky fans were then invited to a game that season where they sat in a luxury box and got to meet the newly named mascot, and one of them was randomly chosen to throw out the first pitch. He has had 1,150 consecutive home-game appearances, and is one of the four subjects followed in the second season of the Hulu series &quot;Behind the Mask&quot;. He primarily wears the team&#x27;s main or orange alternate jersey at home games with the team cap but has varied his clothing and accessories to mark special occasions. For example, he wore a floating costume to swim after Barry Bonds&#x27; splash-hit home runs in San Francisco Bay&#x27;s McCovey Cove and donned a giraffe hat in honor of Brandon Belt&#x27;s nickname &quot;Baby Giraffe&quot;.

Lou Seal also made occasional appearances at the Giants&#x27; High-A minor league team, the San Jose Giants. This practice ended in 2006 when the San Jose Giants introduced their own mascot named Gigante.

In 2013, Lou Seal participated in one of the most memorable and elaborate events staged by the Make-A-Wish Foundation. As part of the finale to a daylong event in San Francisco surrounding &quot;Batkid&quot; Miles Scott in 2013, Lou Seal was kidnapped by The Penguin and taken to the Giants&#x27; stadium, pursued by Batkid and Batman. After completing an obstacle course, Batman captured the Penguin while Batkid freed a grateful Lou Seal, who thanked him with a hug.

Lou Seal became part of the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2024.

=== Mariner Moose (Seattle Mariners) ===
The Mariner Moose is the mascot of the Seattle Mariners. In 1990, a contest for children 14 and under was held to select a mascot, after 2,500 entries the club chose the &quot;Mariner Moose&quot; The Moose made his debut on April 13, 1990 dancing on the field at the Kingdome.
During the 1995 American League Division Series between the Mariners and the New York Yankees, the Moose gained national attention when he broke his ankle crashing into the outfield wall at the Kingdome while being towed on inline skates behind an ATV in the outfield. Inline skating behind an ATV would continue to be a fan favorite until 1999, when the team moved to T-Mobile Park and a natural grass playing surface. Since then, the Moose has become quite adept at driving his own ATV around T-Mobile Park&#x27;s warning track while performing various tricks and having water coolers emptied on him by bullpen pitchers.

The Moose makes several hundred appearances in the community each year in addition to Mariners home games, at everything from hospitals to wedding receptions. The Mariner Moose was featured on the ballot for the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2006 and 2007. He also nearly ran over Coco Crisp with his ATV in 2007, raising the ire of Red Sox pitching coach John Farrell.

=== Mr. Red (Cincinnati Reds) ===

Mr. Red (or The Running Man) was the first mascot of the Cincinnati Reds baseball team. He is a humanoid figure dressed in a Reds uniform, with an oversized baseball for a head.

Mr. Red made his first appearance on a Reds uniform as a sleeve patch in 1955. The patch featured Mr. Red&#x27;s head, clad in an old-fashioned white pillbox baseball cap with red stripes. The following season, 1956, saw the Reds adopt sleeveless jerseys, and Mr. Red was eliminated from the home uniform. He was moved to the left breast of the road uniform, and remained there for one season before being eliminated. In 1999, the Reds re-designed their uniform and &quot;Mr. Red&quot; was reintroduced as a sleeve patch on the undershirt.
A human version of the mascot did not appear until the early 1980s. The costumed mascot disappeared in the late 1980s but was reintroduced in 1997. The humanoid Mr. Red retired in 2007 leaving Gapper, Rosie Red and Mr. Redlegs to take his place. A new version of Mr. Red was unveiled at Redsfest 2012; the new mascot will be on the field with Mr. Redlegs, Gapper and Rosie Red.

=== Mr. Redlegs (Cincinnati Reds) ===

Mr. Redlegs appeared as a patch on the Reds&#x27; uniforms for two seasons in the 1950s (the team briefly assumed the nickname as a response to the second red scare). In 2008, Mr. Redlegs gained national notoriety by falling off of an ATV during pre-game antics. This caused the large, baseball-shaped head to fall off of the Mr. Redlegs costume, exposing the head of the person inside the costume. He was seen a few days later wearing a neck brace as a joke. Unlike Mr. Red, he wears a kepi.

=== Orbit (Houston Astros) ===

Orbit is the mascot of the Houston Astros. Orbit represents a green space alien with antennae, in keeping with the Space City theme of the city of Houston. Originally serving as team mascot from 1990 until 1999, he was replaced by a new mascot, Junction Jack.

However, in 2011 and 2016, Paws&#x27; number changed to 00, since the Tigers retired No. 11 and No. 16 in honor of Sparky Anderson and Hal Newhouser, respectively. His dress changes during Comerica Park theme nights such as a Santa Claus outfit during &quot;Christmas in July&quot; night, or an Elvis Presley-inspired costume for Elvis Night. He &quot;resides&quot; in Comerica Park to this day.
=== Phillie Phanatic (Philadelphia Phillies) ===
Phillie Phanatic is the official mascot of the Philadelphia Phillies. He is a large, furry, green bi-pedal creature with a cylindrical beak containing a tongue that sticks out. He was created by Harrison/Erickson, who thought that the team needed a mascot similar to The San Diego Chicken. The character is named for the fanatical fans of the team and, according to former team owner Bill Giles, was to bring more families to Veterans Stadium, the Phillies&#x27; ballpark at the time, which had become noted for rowdiness and even violence at times. He can be seen riding around on an ATV at home games. In 2008, Forbes named the Phanatic the best mascot in sports.

The contestants in this race include Jalapeño Hannah (green hat), Cheese Chester (yellow), Sauerkraut Saul (red), Oliver Onion (purple), Bacon Burt (orange), Potato Pete (blue), and Pizza Penny (Red and White checkered). The Great Pierogi Race was inspired by the Milwaukee Brewers&#x27; Sausage Race.

=== Pirate Parrot (Pittsburgh Pirates) ===
The Pirate Parrot is the mascot of the Pittsburgh Pirates, debuting in 1979. He is a large green parrot who wears a Pirates jersey and cap. The character of a parrot was derived from the classic story &quot;Treasure Island&quot; by Robert Louis Stevenson, most notably the one owned by Long John Silver named &quot;Captain Flint&quot;. He is often seen dancing on the dugouts and shooting hot-dogs from a cannon, during team home wins he can be seen celebrating waving a Jolly Roger flag.

=== The Racing Presidents (Washington Nationals) ===
The Washington Nationals have a President&#x27;s Race during their games. The race debuted in 2006, and the four presidents on Mount Rushmore – George Washington (&quot;George&quot;), Thomas Jefferson (&quot;Tom&quot;), Abraham Lincoln (&quot;Abe&quot;), and Theodore Roosevelt (&quot;Teddy&quot;) – have raced in every season since. In 2013, a fifth permanent contestant – William Howard Taft (&quot;Will&quot;) – was added. A sixth contestant was added in 2015 as part of a three-year marketing deal with the White House Historical Association, with the sixth slot changing annually based on the president featured by the association on its annual Christmas ornament. Calvin Coolidge (&quot;Cal&quot;) was the first to fill the sixth slot, making his debut in July 2015. Herbert Hoover (&quot;Herbie&quot;) replaced Coolidge for 2016. Each president has a uniform number corresponding to his place in the order in which they held the office (George – 1; Tom – 3; Abe – 16; Teddy – 26; Bill – 27; Cal – 30; Herbie – 31).

The Racing Presidents became an instant success upon their 2006 debut and make multiple public appearances every year. Notably, Abraham Lincoln appeared on the Illinois float for President Barack Obama&#x27;s first inauguration parade on January 20, 2009.

A running gag with the Racing presidents from 2006 to 2012 was that Teddy could never win a race, although he came close in 2012, after apparently defeating the other three presidents: While he was &quot;Tebowing&quot; near the finish line, George drove up in a car and whacked him in the back of the head with a baseball bat, knocking him out before he could finish the race. In October 2012, however, just before the regular season ended and shortly before the Nationals&#x27; first postseason run began, Teddy finally won his first race, and he then went on to win four straight.

The Nationals scrapped plans to replace Herbie in 2017 with the president to be featured on that year&#x27;s White House Historical Association Christmas ornament. Instead, they announced before the 2017 season that Bill, Cal, and Herbie all had retired to Florida, where in 2017 they began a new series of presidents Races among themselves during Nationals spring training games at FITTEAM Ballpark of the Palm Beaches in West Palm Beach. Meanwhile, the presidents Race at Nationals Park returned in 2017 to its original format of 2006–2012, featuring only George, Tom, Abe, and Teddy.

=== Rally Squirrel (St. Louis Cardinals) ===
Rally Squirrel is a secondary mascot for the St. Louis Cardinals. He is an anthropomorphic squirrel wearing the team&#x27;s uniform with a number 11 (presumably for the 2011 postseason), and was introduced not long after an actual squirrel appeared on the field at Busch Stadium during the fifth inning of Game 4 of the 2011 National League Division Series. The squirrel ran across home plate as Philadelphia Phillies pitcher Roy Oswalt was delivering a pitch to Skip Schumaker, causing Oswalt to complain to the umpire that he was distracted by the squirrel. The video of the incident became very popular, and several local businesses in the St. Louis area began creating items to capitalize on the phenomenon.

A performer dressed up as Rally Squirrel took part in Cardinals fan rallies beginning with Game 3 of the 2011 National League Championship Series, and was a companion of the existing Cardinals mascot Fredbird during the remainder of the postseason, assisting Fredbird and Team Fredbird with their duties entertaining the Cardinals fans at Busch Stadium.
=== Rangers Captain (Texas Rangers) ===

Rangers Captain is the mascot for the Texas Rangers. Introduced in 2002, he is a palomino horse, dressed in the team&#x27;s uniform and cap. He wears the uniform number &quot;72&quot; in honor of 1972, the year the Rangers relocated to the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex, on the back.

Rangers Captain has multiple uniforms to match each of the variants the team has; his chosen uniform for the game matches the uniform choice made by the team for that particular game. However, his outfit sometimes matches a theme the team is promoting; as an example, on April 24, 2010, he dressed up like Elvis Presley as part of an Elvis theme promotional night.

=== Raymond (Tampa Bay Rays) ===

Raymond is the original team mascot of the Tampa Bay Rays and one of the team&#x27;s three official mascots.

=== Rosie Red (Cincinnati Reds) ===

Rosie Red is the female mascot of the Cincinnati Reds. She was introduced in August 2008 as the new companion of Gapper and Mr. Redlegs, and her name comes from a female fan, Rosie Janis, who became famous in 1940 for cheering for the team, and is also derived from a female fan group founded to prevent the team from moving from Cincinnati in 1963 and is a philanthropic group associated with the team. The official group name comes from the acronym of &quot;Rooters Organized to Stimulate Interest and Enthuiasm in the Cincinnati Reds&quot;. Rosie wears the jersey and cap similar to her partners, but with the skirt.

=== The Salmon Run (Seattle Mariners) ===
During Opening Day 2024, the Seattle Mariners unveiled their first mascot race, The Salmon Run, presented by Microsoft. This race consists of four species of salmon - King, Sockeye, Silver, and Humpy.

=== The Sausages (Milwaukee Brewers) ===
The sausages are unofficial mascots of the Milwaukee Brewers. They are stylized in the appearance of sausages from around the world. When they were debuted in the mid-1990s there were only three: The German Bratwurst, The Polish Kielbasa, and The Italian Sausage. In the late 1990s The Hot Dog became a racer.

=== Screech (Washington Nationals) ===

Screech is the mascot of the Washington Nationals. He is a bald eagle who wears the home cap and jersey of the team. He was &quot;hatched&quot; on April 17, 2005 at the &quot;Kids Opening Day&quot; promotion at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium. A nine-year-old fourth grade student in Washington, Glenda Gutierrez, designed the mascot and won a contest sponsored by the team, explaining that it was &quot;strong and eats almost everything&quot;. A new &quot;matured&quot; edition of the mascot was unveiled March 2, 2009. The Springfield Falcons, which played in the American Hockey League until they moved to Tucson in 2016, also had a mascot named Screech.

=== Slider (Cleveland Guardians) ===

He was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame in 2008.

=== Sluggerrr (Kansas City Royals) ===

Sluggerrr is the official mascot of the Kansas City Royals. The 6&#x27;9&quot; King of the Jungle, created by character designer Tom Sapp of Real Characters, Inc., made his debut on April 5, 1996. His name is based on the word slugger, which refers to a powerful batter with a high percentage of extra base hits. Sluggerrr is one of few mascots that has Facebook and Twitter accounts, both clearly marked on his homepage.

In 2009, a spectator was injured by a hot dog thrown into the stands by Sluggerrr as part of a between-innings promotion. The spectator sued the Royals organization, claiming that they had been negligent. A jury found for the team under the Baseball Rule, which limits spectators&#x27; ability to sue teams for injuries arising from gameplay, but the Missouri Supreme Court reversed that decision, holding that a mascot&#x27;s hot dog toss is not an essential part of baseball. On retrial, a new jury found that neither the team nor the fan were at fault, and awarded no damages.

In 2017, Sluggerrr was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame.

=== Southpaw (Chicago White Sox) ===

Southpaw is the mascot of the Chicago White Sox. His name is a reference to a left-hand pitcher and is also a reference to Chicago&#x27;s South Side, where the team plays. He was on a float for Illinois at Barack Obama&#x27;s inauguration, along with the Washington Nationals racing president representation of Abraham Lincoln. Wearing the team&#x27;s classic or regular uniforms with the cap, he is present in activities within southern Chicago primarily and in other parts of the city.

=== Stomper (Athletics) ===
Stomper is the mascot of the Athletics. Created in 1997, he is an elephant who wears an A&#x27;s uniform adorned with the number 00. Stomper has performed at several All-Star Games and has appeared in a public service announcement discouraging the use of chewing tobacco.

The use of an elephant to symbolize the A&#x27;s dates back to the early years of the franchise, when a group of Philadelphia businessmen, headed by sporting goods executive Benjamin Shibe, became the team&#x27;s first owners. When asked to comment, John McGraw, manager of the New York Giants of the rival National League, said something to the effect that &quot;Shibe had bought himself a white elephant.&quot; In response, A&#x27;s manager (and future owner) Connie Mack selected the elephant as the team symbol and mascot. From time to time an illustration of an elephant has been featured on the Athletics uniform, from 1988 until 2024.

=== Swinging Friar (San Diego Padres) ===

The Swinging Friar is the mascot of the San Diego Padres.

The Swinging Friar has been a mascot with the team as early as 1958, when the Padres were still a member of the Pacific Coast League, a Minor League Baseball organization. He was named after the Spanish Franciscan friars, who founded Mission San Diego de Alcalá, around which the city of San Diego began to emerge in the 18th century. The Padres joined Major League Baseball in 1969 and kept the popular mascot. He was even on the team emblem until 1984. Wanting a more &quot;professional&quot; image, the owners introduced a more corporate logo. In 1996, he was brought back as a sleeve patch for the club&#x27;s blue alternate jerseys, and though the team has changed its logo and colors since then, the Friar remains there to this day.

The Swinging Friar is a cartoon-like character, pudgy, balding, and always smiling. He is dressed as a friar with a tonsure, sandals, a dark hooded cloak, and a rope around the waist. He swings a baseball bat; but reportedly, in some years he swings left-handed, in other years he swings right-handed, he may be ambidextrous, or even a switch hitter. On home game Sundays, the Friar wears a special camouflage cloak as the team honors the military background of San Diego with similar uniforms. The Friar also rings a mission bell at home games immediately after a win.

Originally, The Swinging Friar was represented at the ballpark as a real man wearing a friar outfit. Since his return, the character has been a full mascot costume.

Some in the past have confused the San Diego Chicken as the mascot of the Padres. Although he does make appearances occasionally at San Diego sporting events, he has never been the official mascot of any San Diego sports team.

, the Friar is also active with his own Twitter account, which debuted just days after the team&#x27;s decision to readopt the classic brown and gold uniform colors for 2020 and beyond.
=== T. C. Bear (Minnesota Twins) ===

T. C. is the mascot for the Minnesota Twins. He was first introduced to Minnesota on April 3, 2000. T. C. is loosely modeled after the Hamm&#x27;s Beer Bear, a mascot used in advertisements for Hamm&#x27;s Brewery, an early sponsor for the Twins. The &quot;T. C.&quot; stands for the &quot;Twin Cities&quot;, Minneapolis and St. Paul. Prior to T.C., the mascot for the Minnesota Twins 1980–81 was a loon named &quot;Twinkie&quot;. T.C. can be seen wearing the team home main or alternate uniform with the TC mark on his cap, just like the rest of the team.

=== Wally the Green Monster and Tessie (Boston Red Sox) ===

Wally the Green Monster is the official mascot for the Boston Red Sox. His name is derived from the Green Monster nickname of the wall in left field at Fenway Park. Wally debuted in 1997 to the chagrin of many older Red Sox fans, despite his popularity with children.

According to the Red Sox promotions department, Wally was a huge Red Sox fan who, in 1947, decided to move inside the left field wall of Fenway Park, since it &quot;eats up&quot; hits that would easily be home runs at other parks. Apparently, he was very shy and lived the life of a hermit for 50 years. In 1997, on the 50th anniversary of the Green Monster being painted green, he came out of the manual scoreboard and has been interacting with players and fans ever since.

When the team began to grow out their beards as a trademark during their 2013 World Series run, Wally was given a long beard as well.

In January 2016, the Red Sox unveiled a new mascot named Tessie, Wally the Green Monster&#x27;s little sister. Tessie is named after the song &quot;Tessie&quot;, which has long been associated with the Red Sox. Tessie wears a blue shirt with the large letter B in red - the symbol utilized in the team&#x27;s caps, which they both wear.

== Former mascots ==
This is a list of former Major League Baseball mascots. Some of these mascots may still be used, but are not considered &quot;official&quot; mascots.

=== Astrojack and Astrodillo ===
Astrojack, an anthropomorphic rabbit, and Astrodillo, an anthropomorphic armadillo, were mascots for the Houston Astros in the 1980s. They wore the Astros&#x27; &quot;rainbow&quot; uniforms of that time, and were also the team&#x27;s first mascots to circulate through the crowd. Before games and during breaks between innings, they would also race around the field on three-wheelers and perform skits with the Astrodome&#x27;s house band, The Astronuts. The creator of Astrojack and Astrodillo, Logan Goodson, would go on to create a later Astros mascot, Junction Jack, who initially replaced the current Astros mascot, Orbit.

=== BJ Birdy ===

BJ Birdy served as the official mascot for the Toronto Blue Jays from 1979 to 1999. He was ejected from a game in 1993 for &quot;showing up&quot; the umpire, after making gestures the umpire found offensive. He was replaced in 1999 with Ace and Diamond. BJ was created and played by the same person, Kevin Shanahan, for his entire 20-year career as the Jays&#x27; mascot. Shanahan lost three toes on his left foot in an automobile accident during the 1991 off season, but managed to return as the Jays mascot, missing only the first home game of the season.

=== Bleacher Creature ===

The Bleacher Creature was a mascot for the Atlanta Braves major league baseball team during the late 1970s. It featured green shaggy fur with a Braves cap and logo on top. The word Braves was written across its chest in big red letters. It had a permanent toothless smile. The mascot usually roamed the stands from time to time during home games and was intended more for the entertainment of younger fans.

The mascot was costumed by Alan Stensland, then a student at Georgia Tech. Stensland was working as an usher at Atlanta Fulton County Stadium when he was approached to wear the costume. The outfit required someone who was 5&quot;8&quot; to 5&#x27;10&quot; tall, and Alen met the height and shoe size requirements. Alen recalls having one of his costume&#x27;s eyes removed by a youngster on his first night out. They also attempted to bust his kneecaps on bat night. During the 1977 season, the mascot made some 250 appearances at games, parties, and parades.

Stensland was only 18 at the time he first donned the costume. The most intense problem he had was the heat. With the added humidity, a really &quot;funky smell&quot; permeated the inside of the costume. Once Stensland graduated, he left the Braves organization, and the mascot was discontinued. The other Braves mascot, Chief Noc-A-Homa, continued on for several more years until Homer the Brave took its spot. Starting in 2018, Blooper took over the current mascot of the Braves.

=== Bluepper ===
Bluepper was a former mascot for the San Diego Padres from 1992 to 1994, He was a dark blue dog-like character with a baseball nose and a sun visor, he was later retired in 1994 because of his unpopularity. The Swinging Friar serves as the current mascot of the Padres.

=== Bonnie Brewer ===
Bonnie Brewer is a former official mascot for the Milwaukee Brewers, appearing at Milwaukee County Stadium from 1973 to 1979. Bonnie was portrayed as a young blonde woman in a gold blouse and short blue lederhosen, wearing a baseball cap and frequently carrying a blue-and-gold broom which she would use to sweep the bases.

Bonnie was first introduced as the female companion to the Brewers&#x27; mascot Bernie Brewer. Bernie and Bonnie were created by then-team vice president Dick Hackett as part of an effort to create a lively atmosphere at County Stadium, which also included hiring organist Frank Charles to play a Wurlitzer during the games. As Hackett remembers it, Bernie and Bonnie were added over the objections of team owner Bud Selig.

Bonnie was noted mainly for her colorful antics during the seventh-inning stretch. As the grounds crew swept the infield, Bonnie wielded her signature broom, sweeping off each base in turn. After sweeping third base, she would playfully swat the opposing team&#x27;s third-base coach on the backside with her broom, following it up with a kiss on his cheek.

Bonnie was discontinued after the 1979 season, although no clear reason has ever been given for her &quot;firing&quot;. Bernie Brewer was discontinued as a mascot in 1984, although he was brought back as a costumed mascot in 1993, complete with full-body costume and large foam head. Bonnie Brewer returned as part of the nostalgia-heavy final home stand at County Stadium, September 18–28, 2000. , Bonnie is part of the Brewers&#x27; &quot;Retro Fridays&quot; promotions at Miller Park, incorporating the traditional base sweeping as well as dancing with Bernie on Bernie&#x27;s Dugout during the fans&#x27; singing of the &quot;Beer Barrel Polka&quot; in the seventh inning stretch.

=== The Buccaneer ===

The Buccaneer was a secondary mascot used by the Pittsburgh Pirates baseball club during their 1995 season. While the team&#x27;s primary mascot, the Pirate Parrot, wore an elaborate costume with a prosthetic head and molded frame, the Buccaneer was simply a man in pirate&#x27;s garb who led the crowd in organized cheers. After an audition involving 30 prospective mascots, 23-year-old Tim Beggy was chosen to portray the Buccaneer.

Beggy was arrested along with a woman in July 1995, while skinny dipping after hours in a closed public swimming pool. Beggy and the woman both reached a plea agreement, under which they each paid a $100 fine and court costs in exchange for more serious charges of &quot;open lewdness&quot; being dropped. Beggy&#x27;s arrest attracted national attention, including jokes on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, and the Pirates subsequently discontinued the use of the character in the wake of the negative publicity.

=== Charlie-O ===

Charlie-O the Mule was the mascot used by the Kansas City Athletics and Oakland A&#x27;s from 1963 to 1976. The mule was named after their colorful owner at that time, Charles O. Finley.

When the A&#x27;s moved to Missouri, where the official state animal is the mule, Warren Hearnes gave a mule to Finley for his barnyard menagerie at Municipal Stadium which also include sheep and goats that scampered up the hill behind right field. The Municipal Stadium menagerie also included Warpaint, the horse mascot of the Kansas City Chiefs. As questions swirled about whether Finley would be loyal to Missouri, he embraced the mule and removed the elephant from the A&#x27;s logo and changed the A&#x27;s colors from blue, red and white to green, gold, and white.

Finley took the sorrel mule around the country, walking him into cocktail parties and hotel lobbies, and on one occasion even into the press room after a large feeding to annoy reporters.

=== Chester Charge ===
In April 1977 the Houston Astros introduced their very first mascot, Chester Charge. Chester Charge was a 45-pound costume of a cartoon Texas cavalry soldier on a horse. Chester appeared on the field at the beginning of each home game, during the seventh inning stretch and then ran around the bases at the conclusion of each win. At the blast of a bugle, the scoreboard would light up and the audience would yell, &quot;Charge!&quot; The first Chester Charge was played by Steve Ross who was then an 18-year-old Senior High School student. The creation of Chester Charge and the (incredible for its day) scoreboard graphics were created by Ed Henderson.

=== Chief Noc-A-Homa ===
Chief Noc-A-Homa was the original mascot of the Atlanta Braves from the 1950s until 1986. The name was used for the &quot;laughing Indian&quot; sleeve patch worn on Braves jerseys. From at least the early 1960s, while still in Milwaukee County Stadium, until the early 1980s at Atlanta&#x27;s Fulton County Stadium, this mascot &quot;lived&quot; in a teepee in an unoccupied section of the bleacher seats.

The teepee was involved in a bit of controversy in 1982 when the Braves, who were in first place in the National League West at the time, elected to remove the chief&#x27;s home to provide more seating for the fans. The team dropped out of first when they lost 19 of 21 games after the removal. The teepee was returned to its spot and the team won the division.

Opposition to Native American mascots caused the Braves to retire Chief Noc-A-Homa and eventually replace him with Homer the Brave, who was eventually replaced with Blooper in 2018.

=== Crazy Crab ===
The Crazy Crab was a mascot of the San Francisco Giants for the 1984 season. As opposed to other mascots, Crazy Crab was meant as an &quot;anti-mascot&quot;, satirizing the mascot craze occurring at the time. Fans were encouraged to boo the mascot, played by actor Wayne Doba, and manager Frank Robinson appeared in a commercial with the crustacean where Robinson was restrained from attacking him. This encouragement perhaps led to animosity toward the mascot, as Giants fans regularly threw various dangerous objects at Crazy Crab, including beer bottles and batteries, and Crazy Crab&#x27;s suit had to be reinforced with a fiberglass shell for protection. Additionally, players on both the Giants and opposing teams would throw rosin bags and other objects at the mascot. Doba sued the San Diego Padres after two of their players, Kurt Bevacqua and future Giants manager Bruce Bochy, tackled him, causing injuries. The mascot lasted only one year and the Giants would not have another mascot until Lou Seal in 1996. The crab returned in 1999 for the Giants&#x27; final game at Candlestick Park, and a bobblehead with its likeness was given away on July 18, 2008, in celebration of the franchise&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary in the Bay Area. A website called &quot;Rehab the Crab&quot; is devoted to bringing back Crazy Crab, and a Crazy Crab sandwich is sold at Oracle Park, the Giants&#x27; current stadium. In 2014, Colin Hanks directed &quot;The Anti-Mascot&quot;, an ESPN &quot;30 for 30&quot; short about Crazy Crab. On July 7, 2018, Crazy Crab made an appearance at Oracle Park in honor of the Giants&#x27; Crazy Crab scarf giveaway.

=== Dandy ===

Dandy was a short-lived mascot of the New York Yankees. He was a large pinstriped cartoon mascot that sported a Yankees hat. He had a mustache that gave him an appearance similar to that of former Yankee pitcher Sparky Lyle or Thurman Munson. His name was a play on the classic American folk song &quot;Yankee Doodle Dandy&quot;. He appeared at the start of the 1980 season and was so unpopular that he was quickly canceled. Dandy was beaten up by fans who did not want a mascot, and quit, leading to the elimination of the character as the Yankees chose not to replace him.

Along with this experiment, the Yankees briefly had mascots resembling ballpark food (plus Yankees hats on top) during the mid-1990s. Outside of these two occasions, the Yankees have not had an official mascot or cheerleading squad roam the stands or perform on the field, although the late Freddy Schuman has served as an unofficial promoter in the stands for decades, and a squirrel appearing on the field has brought inspiration as a mascot for the team. In 2021, Bronxie the Rally Turtle served as the Yankees&#x27; unofficial mascot.

=== Diamond ===
Diamond was a secondary mascot of the Toronto Blue Jays alongside Ace. She and Ace replaced BJ Birdy in 2000. However, Diamond never gained enough appeal with fans to last, and was removed by the Blue Jays at the end of the 2003 season, leaving Ace the sole mascot of the team.

=== General Admission ===
General Admission (a pun on the unreserved $4 seating section of the Astrodome) was a mascot for the Houston Astros in the mid-to-late 1990s. He was played by Michael Kenny, who is now the Senior Director of Guest Relations for the Houston Astros, and wore a traditional U.S. Cavalry uniform complete with gold stars he would affix to his uniform for every Astros home run hit in the dome. Whenever an Astro hit a home run, General Admission would fire a cannon from his outfield platform (that would often scare those seated near him). He was &quot;killed off&quot; at the end of the 1999 season when the Astros main mascot, Orbit, had him zapped by an alien ray gun on the penultimate game of the regular season.

=== Harry Elephante ===
Harry Elephante was the Oakland Athletics original costumed mascot who debuted sometime in 1980s and was quickly replaced with Trunk, who was eventually replaced with Stomper. His name is a play on Harry Belafonte.

=== Homer ===
Homer was the mascot of the Atlanta Braves. He had a baseball shaped head, and looked a little like Mr. Met. Before having the baseball head however, Homer was the personification of the old &quot;Screaming Warrior&quot; logo the Braves used before dropping it in 1988.

Homer&#x27;s full name was Homer the Brave. This was meant to sound like &quot;home of the brave&quot;, the last words of the national anthem. Incidentally, &quot;homer&quot; was also the longtime nickname for a home run.

Homer retired in 2018 after Blooper was introduced.

=== Homer the Beagle ===
Homer the Beagle was the mascot of the New York Mets in their inaugural year. He was a live beagle puppy.

=== Junction Jack ===
Junction Jack was the mascot character for the Houston Astros from 2000 until 2012. He was a rabbit dressed as a railroad engineer. His &quot;relatives&quot; were Junction Julie and Junction Jesse, although they were not certified official mascots by the Astros.

Junction Jack replaced Orbit when the team moved from the Astrodome to Minute Maid Park. The new stadium was originally called &quot;The Ballpark at Union Station&quot; because it was built on the site of the historic railway station in downtown Houston. In keeping with this new theme for the Astros, Orbit was replaced by the engineer. The character was designed by Logan Goodson and named by Duone Byars, both former Astros employees.

After the 2012 season, Junction Jack, Julie, and Jesse were retired, with Orbit returning to his former place as the Astros mascot on November 2, 2012. Orbit&#x27;s return coincided with the Astros&#x27; move to the American League West as well as their new uniforms, caps, and logo.

=== Larry ===
Larry, a Bull Terrier, was the mascot for the Cleveland Naps in the 1910s, cared for by player Jack Graney.

=== Lefty and Righty (Boston Red Sox) ===
Before their retirement in 2014, Lefty and Righty were each a large, red sock with arms, and before Tessie the Green Monster&#x27;s introduction in 2016, were the alternate mascot characters for the Boston Red Sox through the 2014 MLB season, joining Wally the Green Monster. They were seen on large outings with Wally such as the 2007 World Series Parade as well as weekend afternoon games at Fenway Park.
=== Mettle the Mule ===
Mettle the Mule was a mascot of the New York Mets for a short time starting in 1976. Originally named Arthur, Mettle was renamed as a result of a fan contest. Mettle was kept in a pen near the Mets&#x27; bullpen in the right field of Shea Stadium.

=== Mr. Oriole ===
Mr. Oriole was the original Baltimore Orioles mascot in 1954. Commissioned by Orioles Public Relations Director Dick Armstrong to &quot;replicate the expression and appearance of Mr. Oriole&quot; designed by Baltimore Sun cartoonist Jim Hartzell, a costumed mascot was created &quot;so that a three-dimension version of the bird could cavort on the field and in the stands during the games.&quot; Mr. Oriole holds the distinction of being the first costumed mascot in Major League Baseball.

=== Philadelphia Phil and Philadelphia Phillis ===
Philadelphia Phil and Philadelphia Phillis served as mascots for the Phillies during the 1970s (1971–1979). Their costumes invoked the city&#x27;s revolutionary spirit from 1776. The pair reappeared with their replacement—the Phanatic—as the Phillies celebrated their final year at Veterans Stadium in 2003, including the final opening day and final game.

=== Rally ===

Rally was one of the Atlanta Braves mascots. He was a Red and Blue Muppet-like mascot with a Blue Mowhawk, he first appeared during the 1985–1986 season, and would often be seen hanging out with Homer. He soon disappeared sometime in the early 2000&#x27;s, leaving Homer the only mascot until Blooper arrived in 2018.

=== Ribbie and Roobarb ===
Ribbie and Roobarb were a pair of mascots used by the Chicago White Sox from 1981 to 1988 at Comiskey Park. After the Sox were sold in 1981 by Bill Veeck to an ownership group headed by Jerry Reinsdorf and Eddie Einhorn, the new owners, who were eager to draw on the 1970s popularity of such mascots as The San Diego Chicken, hired the design firm responsible for creating the Phillie Phanatic to create a new mascot for the Sox.

They debuted the pair of furry mascots in September 1981, but the fans never accepted the two, ridiculing them throughout their tenure with the team—both because of their ludicrous appearance, which had no apparent connection with the team, and also because they were seen as an attempt to eliminate Andy the Clown, who had performed unofficially at Sox games since 1960. &quot;Rhubarb&quot; is longtime baseball slang for a heated on-field argument; Ribbie comes from the acronym RBI, for runs batted in. Often reports will say ribbie instead of RBI to describe it.

After another failed mascot in the early 1990s was Waldo the White Sox Wolf. The White Sox introduced a new mascot, Southpaw, in 2004.

=== Ribbie and Southpaw===
Ribbie and Southpaw were a pair of bear mascots created by the Los Angeles Angels in 1993, but they were replaced by Scoop and Clutch in the mid 1990s.

=== Rootin&#x27; Tootin&#x27; Ranger ===

Rootin&#x27; Tootin&#x27; Ranger was the mascot of the Texas Rangers in the late 1970s. Since 2002, Rangers Captain serves as the team&#x27;s mascot.

=== Schottzie ===
Schottzie was a live St. Bernard mascot used by the Cincinnati Reds from 1982 until his death in 1991, he was later replaced by another St. Bernard named Schottzie (02), who was mascot from 1992 until 1999.

=== Scoop and Clutch ===
Scoop and Clutch were mascots for the Anaheim Angels in the 1990s. The pair were bears wearing Angels uniforms complete with halos and wings for some time. They disappeared and were effectively replaced by the Rally Monkey in the 2002 season.

=== Souki ===
Souki was the mascot of the Montreal Expos, for only one season (1978), a figure in an Expos uniform with a giant baseball for a head. It was a variation of the popular mascot of the New York Mets called Mr. Met, but with one difference. The Expos&#x27; Mr. Met, called Souki, had odd antennas sticking out the sides of his head. He looked like something from outer space and the kids were afraid of him. During a game in late fall, a father attacked Souki after his child was afraid of him (and after a loss). Starting the following year in 1979, Youppi! took over as the official mascot of the Expos until the team&#x27;s relocation to Washington, D.C. in 2004, where he was replaced with Screech the following year.

=== Spacey the Needle ===

Spacey was the winner of the 1979 mascot competition held by the Seattle Mariners and became the team mascot for a few games. The Mariners replaced him with the Mariner Moose in 1990.

=== The Baseball Bug ===
The Baseball Bug was the former mascot of the Cleveland Indians from 1980 to 1981. He was a large red creature with a long nose and a baseball cap with eyes and antennas sticking out. He was retired and replaced with Slider after the 1981 season. He came out of retirement in 2024 to join the Cleveland Guardians’ High-A Midwest League affiliate, the Lake County Captains. 

=== Trunk ===
Trunk was the former mascot of the Oakland Athletics from 1994 to 1996. he was an elephant similar to Stomper, but was skinnier and wore black sunglasses similar to the alternate logo used from 1994 to 2002. He was replaced by Stomper later on in the 1997 season.

=== Twinkie the Loon ===
Twinkie was used by the Minnesota Twins for two seasons 1980 and 1981. T.C. replaced him in 2000.

=== Waldo the White Sox Wolf ===
Waldo the White Sox Wolf was a short-lived mascot of the Chicago White Sox in the 1990s before Southpaw&#x27;s debut in 2004.

=== Youppi! ===
Youppi! was the mascot of the Montreal Expos, before the franchise moved to Washington as the Washington Nationals. He is an orange furry creature with a white face originally leased in 1979 and designed by Bonnie Erickson, formerly a designer for some of Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppets characters. Youppi! was so named resembling the phrase &quot;Yippee!&quot; or &quot;Hooray!&quot; in French. Youppi! was the first mascot to be thrown out of a Major League Baseball game: on August 23, 1989, in the 11th inning, while atop the visitors&#x27; dugout, Youppi! took a running leap, landing hard and noisily on its roof, and then sneaked into a front row seat. Los Angeles Dodgers manager Tommy Lasorda complained to the umpires and Youppi! was ejected, though he later returned, confined to the home team&#x27;s dugout roof. Youppi! was abandoned as a mascot and replaced with Screech after the Expos franchise moved to Washington in 2005, but was adopted by the NHL&#x27;s Montreal Canadiens team on September 16, 2005, as potentially the first sports mascot to switch their allegiance from one sport to another, while remaining in the same city.

Youppi! was voted to the Mascot Hall of Fame in December 2019, and was inducted in June 2020. Youppi! is the first mascot of a Canadian team to receive the honor.

== Teams without a mascot ==
The following MLB teams do not currently have an official mascot:

* New York Yankees
* Los Angeles Dodgers
* Los Angeles Angels

== Mascot store in various ballparks ==
The &quot;Build-A-Bear Workshop&quot; Make-Your-Own-Phanatic store, at Citizens Bank Park, was the first store of its kind in sports. Fans are invited to buy and stuff a Phillie Phanatic doll and dress it up. Following the 2010 season, the Build-A- Bear in Philadelphia was discontinued. Similar shops have since been set up in Cincinnati (Great American Ball Park), Cleveland (Progressive Field), St. Louis (Busch Stadium), San Francisco (Oracle Park), and Washington, D.C. (Nationals Park). The Milwaukee Brewers also have in their main team store at Miller Park a whole section of their store consisting entirely of merchandise featuring the Racing Sausages, called The Meat Locker.

<doc id="855377" wikidata="Q1741922" url="?curid=855377" title="Pediatric urology">
<text>Pediatric urology is a surgical subspecialty of medicine dealing with the disorders of children&#x27;s genitourinary systems. Pediatric urologists provide care for both boys and girls ranging from birth to early adult age. The most common problems are those involving disorders of urination, reproductive organs and testes.

==Focus areas==
Some of the problems they deal with are: 
*Bladder control problems such as bedwetting and daytime urinary incontinence
*Undescended testes (cryptorchidism)
*Hypospadias
* Epispadias
*Urolithiasis (bladder and kidney stones)
*Chordee and other minor malformations of the penis
*Phimosis
*Urinary obstruction and vesicoureteral reflux
*Neurogenic bladder (e.g., associated with spina bifida)
* Antenatal hydronephrosis
*Tumors and cancers of the kidneys
*Repair of genitourinary trauma
*Genitourinary malformations and birth defects
**Prune belly syndrome
**Cloacal exstrophy, bladder exstrophy, and epispadias
**Ambiguous genitalia and intersex conditions

==Pediatric urologists==
In North America, most pediatric urologists are associated with children&#x27;s hospitals. Training for board certification in pediatric urology typically consists of a surgery internship as part of a urology residency followed by subspecialty training in pediatric urology at a major children&#x27;s hospital. In India, Pediatric Urology is practiced by Pediatric Surgeons with a special interest/ training in pediatric urology as well as by adult urologists who get trained in Pediatric Urology.

<doc id="855381" wikidata="Q7195633" url="?curid=855381" title="Piney River (Middle Tennessee)">
<text>The Piney River is a tributary of the Duck River in Middle Tennessee in the United States. Via the Duck River, the Tennessee River, and the Ohio River, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. The headwater tributaries of the Piney River rise in Dickson County, Tennessee, near the city of Dickson. Dickson is located on the &quot;Tennessee Valley Divide&quot;, which corresponds for some distance with the downtown&#x27;s Main Street. The western part of the town, the part in the Tennessee Valley (as opposed to the Cumberland Valley), is drained by the East Piney River, a tributary to the Piney.

The city lakes, formerly a water supply source and the site of an early electrical power plant even before this, are on a Piney River tributary, as was a former city sewer plant, which was closed when a larger water intake was built further down on the Piney. The upper reaches of the Piney were inadequate for the area&#x27;s needs, and a pipeline to the Cumberland River in the north end of the county has now been completed, relieving the Piney of the burden of supplying the water needs to a growing community that threatened soon to exhaust it.

The West and East Piney rivers flow together near the community of Mount Sinai; this confluence marks the true head of the stream. The stream flows from this point south-southeast into Hickman County, where it meets the waters of the Duck River a few miles west-northwest of Centerville. The Piney&#x27;s major tributary in Hickman County is Mill Creek, a scenic stream which is frequently stocked with trout by the Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency.

In August 2021 a rain system produced up to of rain in the area within 24 hours. The resulting flash flooding was responsible for more than twenty deaths.

<doc id="855382" wikidata="Q4938475" url="?curid=855382" title="Boise greenbelt">
<text>The Boise River Greenbelt is a recreational and alternate transportation trail along the banks of the Boise River through Boise, Idaho, United States. The Boise Greenbelt is more of a greenway than a green belt since its character is linear. It extends more than 20 miles (32 km) beginning at Lucky Peak Dam in the east to a short distance beyond Eagle Road (Idaho State Highway 55) in the west in Eagle, Idaho. Taking into account both sides of the river and other parallel trails and spurs, the total Greenbelt trail system measures more than 30 miles (48 km).

The Greenbelt connects Boise&#x27;s riverside parks and connects Boise with neighboring municipalities. The majority of the Greenbelt is paved with asphalt or concrete on both sides of the river. However some sections are unpaved and bicycles may be prohibited on some unpaved sections. Where this occurs, bicycles have alternate routes on residential streets or dedicated bike paths. Motorized vehicles are prohibited on all parts of the Greenbelt. Segways are allowed on the Greenbelt in the City of Boise providing a special permit has been obtained.

==History==
In 1962, the City of Boise hired a consultant, Atkinson &amp; Associates, to create Boise&#x27;s first comprehensive plan. The plan suggested the city should acquire land along the Boise River to create a continuous &quot;green belt&quot; of public lands stretching the entire length of the community. A local grassroots effort to clean up the waterway and create public access to the river corridor began to take hold. This vision caught on, and by 1967 three small parcels of land were donated to the city to launch the &quot;green belt.&quot;

In 1968, with public interest and support growing, the first Greenbelt Plan and Guidelines were adopted by the Board of Parks Commissioners. A Greenbelt and Pathways Committee was appointed in 1969 to guide the City of Boise as it worked to develop the Greenbelt, and in 1971 the first Greenbelt Ordinance was adopted which required a minimum setback of for all structures and parking areas. The City of Boise continued to slowly piece together a patchwork of land along the corridor using several methods of acquisition including purchase, exchange, leasing and receiving donations of property by individuals, civic groups and corporations.

Approximately west of Veterans Memorial Parkway the north bank trail ends. However, two pedestrian bridges carry traffic to the south bank trail via an area known as Plantation Island. The north bank trail resumes at the Glenwood Street bridge approximately west of the first Plantation Island pedestrian bridge.

Also on the north bank, approximately 1/4 mile west of Glenwood Bridge the greenbelt becomes a bicycle dismount zone at the Riverside Village residential development. The bicycle dismount zone continues approximately westward. As of April 2008 Garden City has made it a misdemeanor to ride a bicycle on the greenbelt through Riverside Village. However, there is a roughly parallel signed bicycle route which allows bicyclists to continue westward on residential streets to the City of Eagle greenbelt without having to ride on busy State Street (State Highway 44).

===South Bank, from east to west===
* Barber Park
* Bown Crossing, A New Urbanism style district
* Parkcenter Blvd. residential area
* Baybrook Court Footbridge
* Boise State University
* Ann Morrison Park
* Kathryn Albertson Park
* Joe&#x27;s Crab Shack Restaurant
* Riverside Hotel
* Garden City Boys and Girls Club
* Plantation Island
* Expo Idaho
* Glenwood Street bridge
* Garden City Library

In the Parkcenter Boulevard area bicycling is prohibited on a section which is unpaved and follows the river bank for approximately from Barber Park to East River Run Drive. Bicyclists are routed on a circuitous route on residential neighborhood streets.

A more significant gap in the south bank trail is at the west end of Ann Morrison Park where there is a gap from the Americana Boulevard bridge westward to the Main Street bridge. At the downstream side of the Main Street bridge the south bank trail resumes to approximately east of the Western Idaho Fairgrounds at East 52nd Street. A brief detour via East 52nd Street, Alworth Street and Remington Street returns users to the south bank Greenbelt and continues westward approximately west of the Glenwood Street Bridge.

==Boise River Greenbelt DOTS==
DOTS is an acronym for Distance &amp; Orientation Trail System. Serving as mileposts, there are over 100 white dots 18 inches (45 cm) in diameter painted on the greenbelt. The purpose of the DOTS is to aid people in locating their position on the greenbelt relative to the downtown Boise central point. The central point, mile 0, is located near the intersection of 8th Street and River Street in downtown Boise. The DOTS are spaced at increments. For example, if one is on the north bank west of the central point one would see a DOT with the inscription NW 1.0. If one is on the south bank east of the central point, one would see the inscription SE 5.3.

== Riverside Village Controversy ==
A stretch of greenbelt west of Glenwood Street in Garden City on the north side has been closed in varying degrees over the last three decades. The former Idaho state land was offered on condition that &quot;...they shall construct certain improvements on the State land consisting of a bike path, lakes, pedestrian bridges (where the latter are required to assure a continuous linkage of greenbelt next to the Boise River for the length of the Riverside Village project)...&quot;, but these terms have never been met. At one point a stretch even had a sign posted stating &quot;Private Property. No Trespassing. This is not part of the Boise Greenbelt. Violators will be prosecuted.&quot; In 2007, a ban on bicycles through this stretch was approved by Garden City Mayor John Evans. Evans oversaw construction of the Riverside Village neighborhood as the development manager for Idaho Forest Industries (IFI) and Evans Brothers Construction.

<text>A dik-dik is the name for any of four species of small antelope in the genus Madoqua, which live in the bushlands of eastern and southern Africa.

Dik-diks stand about at the shoulder, are long, weigh and can live for up to 10 years. Dik-diks are named for the alarm calls of the females. In addition to the females&#x27; alarm call, both the male and female make a shrill, whistling sound. These calls may alert other animals to predators.

== Name ==
The name &quot;dik-dik&quot; comes from an onomatopoeia of the repetitive &quot;dik&quot; sound female dik-diks whistle through their long, tubular snouts when they feel threatened.

== Physical characteristics ==
Female dik-diks are somewhat larger than males. The males have horns, which are small (about ), slanted backwards and longitudinally grooved. The hair on the crown forms an upright tuft that sometimes partially conceals the short, ribbed horns of the male. The upper body is gray-brown, while the lower parts of the body, including the legs, belly, crest, and flanks, are tan. A bare black spot below the inside corner of each eye contains a preorbital gland that produces a dark, sticky secretion. Dik-diks insert grass stems and twigs into the gland to scent-mark their territories.

Perhaps to prevent overheating, dik-diks (especially Guenther&#x27;s dik-diks) have elongated snouts with bellows-like muscles through which blood is pumped. Airflow and subsequent evaporation cools this blood before it is recirculated to the body. However, this panting is only implemented in extreme conditions; dik-diks can tolerate air temperatures of up to .

== Adaptations for desert environments ==
Dik-diks have special physiological adaptations to help them survive in arid environments. For instance, dik-diks have a lower density of sweat glands compared to other animals such as cattle. Similarly, in more arid environments, dik-diks can concentrate their urine. These adaptations help dik-diks preserve body water. Because of their small body size, dik-diks are predicted to have among the highest metabolic rates and highest energy requirement per kilogram of all ruminants. However, dik-diks have a lower metabolic rate than would be predicted for their size as a physiological adaptation to heat and aridity.

== Habitat ==
Dik-diks live in shrublands and savannas of eastern Africa. Dik-diks seek habitats with a plentiful supply of edible plants such as shrubs. Dik-diks may live in places as varied as dense forest or open plain, but they require good cover and not too much tall grass. They usually live in pairs in territories of about . The territories are often in low, shrubby bushes (sometimes along dry, rocky streambeds) with plenty of cover. Dik-diks, with their dusty colored coat, are able to blend in with their surroundings. Dik-diks have an established series of runways through and around the borders of their territories that are used when they feel threatened.

== Diet ==


Dik-diks are herbivores. Their diet mainly consists of foliage, shoots, fruit and berries, but little or no grass. They receive sufficient amounts of water from their food, which makes drinking unnecessary. Like all even-toed ungulates, they digest their food with the aid of micro-organisms in their four-chambered stomachs. After initial digestion, the food is repeatedly eructated and rechewed, a process known also as rumination, or &#x27;chewing the cud&#x27;. Dik-diks&#x27; tapering heads may help them eat the leaves between the spines on acacia trees, and feed while still keeping their head high to detect predators.

== Reproduction ==
Dik-diks are monogamous, and conflicts between territorial neighbors are rare. When they occur, the males from each territory dash at each other, either stop short or make head-to-head contact, then back off for another round, with head crests erected. Males mark their territories with dung piles, and cover the females&#x27; dung with their own. One suggestion for monogamy in dik-diks is that it may be an evolutionary response to predation; surrounded by predators, it is dangerous to explore, looking for new partners. Pairs spend about 64% of their time together. Males, but not females, will attempt to initiate extra-pair mating if an opportunity arises.

Females are sexually mature at six months and males at 12 months. The female gestates for 169 to 174 days and bears a single calf. This happens up to twice a year (at the start and finish of the rainy season). Unlike other ruminants which are born forefeet first, the dik-dik is born nose first, with its forelegs laid back alongside its body. Females weigh about at birth, while males weigh . The mother lactates for six weeks, feeding her calf for no longer than a few minutes at a time. The survival rate for young dik-diks is 50%. The young stay concealed for a time after birth, but grow quickly and reach full size by seven months. At that age, the young are forced to leave their parents&#x27; territory. The fathers run the sons off the territory and the mothers run off the daughters.

== Predators ==

Dik-diks are hunted by leopards, caracals, lions, hyenas, wild dogs and humans. Other predators include monitor lizards, cheetahs, jackals, baboons, eagles, hawks and pythons. Dik-diks&#x27; adaptations to predation include excellent eyesight, the ability to reach speeds up to , and high birth rates.

== Species ==
The four species of dik-dik are:

* &quot;Madoqua guntheri&quot; – Günther&#x27;s dik-dik
* &quot;M. kirkii&quot; – Kirk&#x27;s dik-dik
* &quot;M. piacentinii&quot; – Silver dik-dik
* &quot;M. saltiana&quot; – Salt&#x27;s dik-dik

<text>Hallmark Media (formerly Crown Media Holdings) is an American media production company with corporate headquarters located in Studio City, California, and is a subsidiary of Hallmark Cards.

Hallmark Media consists of Crown Media Productions and its Hallmark Hall of Fame, and its &quot;Family Networks&quot;—including Hallmark Channel, Hallmark Movies &amp; More, Hallmark Mystery, Hallmark Family, and streaming service Hallmark+.

==History==

=== Precursors ===

Since 1951, Hallmark Cards has owned the Hallmark Hall of Fame anthology movie series and later its corresponding production company, Hallmark Hall of Fame Productions. From 1990 to 1996, Republic Pictures Home Video distributed Hallmark Hall of Fame films to home video market. From 1987 to 1992, Hallmark was involved in ownership of the Spanish language Univision broadcast network, along with their owned-and-operated stations. In 1989, it partnered with Jones Intercable to create the Jones Crown Partners partnership, which owned ten Wisconsin cable systems.

In February 1992, Hallmark Cards had formed Signboard Hill Productions as a production company for the Hall of Fame series and other projects for theaters or TV under president Brad Moore. Also in April of that year, Hallmark Cards purchased RHI Entertainment for $378 million plus $50 million in debt getting a 1,800-plus hours film library.

Crown Media Inc. was formed in 1991 by Hallmark as a vehicle for investments into cable operators. The division&#x27;s CEO James Hoak—a cable television executive who was formerly chairman of Heritage Communications—held a 2% minority stake in the company. Crown initially aimed to serve at least 500,000 customers in three geographic groups by the end of 1994. Crown initially purchased Jones Crown Partners, another system from Jones Intercable, and later St. Louis-based Cencom, which owned systems with 160,000 subscribers, and managed systems with 390,000 subscribers.

With a planned move of Cencom&#x27;s headquarters to Dallas in January 1993, its top executives left to form Charter Communications. After re-evaluating the business, Hallmark pulled out of cablesystem ownership, and sold its holdings—which served over 800,000 customers—to Charter Communications and Marcus Cable for $900 million.

===Hallmark Entertainment===
In 1994, Hallmark brought RHI Entertainment and Signboard Hill Productions under the new division Hallmark Entertainment, under RHI&#x27;s president and CEO Robert Halmi Jr. In January 1995, Hallmark Entertainment acquired the library of animation studio Filmation from Paravision, and established the home media division Hallmark Home Entertainment. Hallmark also purchased a 9.9% stake in British media company Flextech. It would partner with Hallmark on a proposed pay television service, Hallmark Entertainment Network, which first launched in the Benelux region.

After partnering on the 1996 miniseries &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;, Hallmark Entertainment began a joint venture with The Jim Henson Company to launch Kermit Channel—a chain of family-oriented pay television channels in Asia that would be devoted to carrying the libraries of Jim Henson (including the Muppets franchise) and Hallmark Entertainment, as well as preschool programming provided by Children&#x27;s Television Workshop.

In 1998, Hallmark Entertainment and Jim Henson acquired major stakes in Odyssey Network, an American religious cable network. Liberty Media, who was a partner in the channel alongside the National Interfaith Cable Coalition, had discouraged Hallmark from attempting to launch a cable network in the U.S. After the purchase, the two companies relaunched the channel in 1999 with a larger focus on family entertainment programming.

===Crown Media Holdings===
In 2000, Odyssey&#x27;s ownership group was re-organized into Crown Media Holdings, with Hallmark, Chase Equity Associates, Liberty Media, and the National Interfaith Cable Coalition transferring their shares in Odyssey to the company, and plans for an IPO. Hallmark received all of Crown Media&#x27;s class B shares, which were worth ten votes each, thus giving it control of Crown Media. After The Jim Henson Company was sold to German company EM.TV &amp; Merchandising in February 2000, it withdrew from the Kermit Channel partnership with Crown Media, and sold its remaining stake in Odyssey the following month in exchange for 8% of Crown Media&#x27;s stock.

The company went public in May 2000, selling 10 million shares at $14 per share for about $140 million. Hallmark president and CEO Robert Halmi, Jr. became chairman of Crown Media, and David Evans became president and CEO of Crown Media Holdings. While its channels had 50 million subscribers at the IPO, the company had not turned a profit; Hallmark Entertainment Network lost $35.5 million in 1998 on revenue of $23.7 million, and in 1999 it lost $56.7 million on revenue of $31.9 million. A digital media subsidiary, Crown Interactive, was established in 2001, which attempted to launch a video on-demand platform in Singapore.

In April 2001, Crown Media purchased 700 titles from Hallmark Entertainment Distribution, a subsidiary of Hallmark Entertainment, for its cable channels and Crown Interactive. In payment for the titles, Crown Media took on $220 million in debt and granted over 30 million shares of stock to Hallmark Entertainment. Hallmark&#x27;s stake in the company was then about 65% of the company&#x27;s outstanding common stock and completed on October 1, 2001. After reaching agreements to distribute a religious digital cable network, among other concessions, Odyssey was relaunched by Crown Media as the Hallmark Channel in August 2001, with plans for expansions to original programming. At the end of her contract, Loesch stepped down as the president and CEO of Crown Media US in November 2001.

In January 2004, the company established Hallmark Movie Channel as a sister outlet to Hallmark Channel. The new channel was on track in 2005 to have 9 million subscribers by the end of 2006. In March 2004, Hallmark Entertainment sold the Filmation library to Entertainment Rights for $20 million (£11 million).

In 2005, Hallmark Entertainment put the Hallmark Channel up for sale, but withdrew it from the market after receiving insufficient offers. Losing $233 million in 2005, Hallmark got a tax-sharing agreement allowing Crown&#x27;s losses to applied against Hallmark Card&#x27;s gains. Crown Media had $750 million in loans from Hallmark Cards out of a total of $800 million total loans against $1 billion in equity. While minority investors, Liberty Media International Inc. and JPMorgan Chase, might have sold, company management move to clean up the balance sheet and acquire new programming. Hallmark Channels in international markets were sold for about $242 million in 2005 to Sparrowhawk Media, a private equity group backed by Providence Equity Partners and 3i. In December 2005, Crown Media sold off its production arm to an investor group led by RHI founder Robert Halmi Sr. and renamed back to RHI Entertainment. Crown moved to reduce staff by 20% to reduce $13–14 million or more from the balance sheet in 2006. In June 2006, David Evans resigned as CEO then joined RHI as head of global new-media operations and channel. Crown Media had a 3,000-hour library worth $375 million by mid-2006. Crown Media then sold to RHI Enterprises, LLC its media library in November 2006.

In October 2006, Henry Schleiff was hired as CEO from Court TV to prepare it for sale and deal with cable carriage deals expiring (as the channel was at the time in 70 million homes). He would receive a bonus if the channel was sold.

Schleiff left as CEO in May 2009. He was replaced by Bill Abbott, previous ad sales head. Crown Media had about $1.1 million in debt thus is attempting to increase revenue and expected to refinance its debt in 2010. Schleiff left to attempt to help other small cable channel to become a major channel like he did with Court TV. He also increase the reach of Hallmark to 86 million homes at the time he left.

Abbott moved most movies to Hallmark Movies while attempt to move to a lifestyle focus similar to such as Scripps Networks Interactive channels. After two content deals for the Hallmark Channel in March 2010, Crown Media and Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia were in discussion about launch a joint venture channel, Hallmark Home. The potential partners were considering bringing in a private equity partner and talk to distributors.

Crown Media had placed an animated series based on Hallmark&#x27;s e-card characters Hoops and Yoyo into development in March 2010. Classic Media took charged of worldwide distribution of the &quot;Hoops &amp; Yoyo Ruin Christmas&quot; holiday special which is pick up by CBS for a November 2011 debut.

In March 2011, Crown Media renamed its Hallmark Channels unit to Crown Media Networks. Hallmark Movie Channel was re-branded as Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries in 2014&#x27;s fourth quarter. Crown Media Holdings formed Crown Media Productions in March 2015 under programming executive vice president Michelle Vicary to fund six telefilms for 2015 and double that in 2016. In February 2016, Crown Media had taken over ownership of Hallmark Hall of Fame division from Hallmark Cards placing under Crown Media Productions.

On March 9, 2016, Hallmark Cards announced it was buying the remaining less than 10% of Crown Media Holdings traded publicly and taking the company private. Hallmark did so via Delaware&#x27;s short form merger, which allows a parent company owning over 90% to bypass the subsidiary&#x27;s board of directors and shareholders in approving the purchase/merger. The privatization was completed later that year.

NBC Universal agreed to purchased Sparrowhawk Media, international operator of Hallmark Channel, in August 2007. With Hallmark trademark rights reverting in July 2011, Universal Networks International switched over the international Hallmark channels to either Diva Universal, 13th Street Universal, Studio Universal, Universal Channel, or shut them down.

In October 2017, Crown Media launched the new channel Hallmark Drama, and the new subscription streaming service Hallmark Movies Now. The company also indicated a publishing division was in the works.

In October 2018, Crown Media announced an output deal with Canadian broadcaster Corus Entertainment for exclusive distribution rights to Hallmark Channel original productions, which would air on its domestic cable channel W Network. The company also partnered with SiriusXM on the satellite radio channel &quot;Hallmark Channel Radio&quot; as a tie-in for that year&#x27;s &quot;Countdown to Christmas&quot; lineup.

On March 14, 2019, Crown Media announced that it was cutting ties with popular Hallmark Channel actress Lori Loughlin, following her arrest as part of a high-profile federal sting operation relating to college admissions irregularities. In June 2020, after previous CEO Bill Abbott abruptly stepped down in January, Wonya Lucas was named Crown Media&#x27;s new CEO.

=== Hallmark Media ===
On August 10, 2022, it was announced that Crown Media would be renamed Hallmark Media.

In October 2022, Hallmark Media announced a subscription video on demand agreement with NBCUniversal&#x27;s streaming service Peacock, which saw a Hallmark content hub with live and on-demand content from Hallmark Channel, Hallmark Movies &amp; Mysteries, and Hallmark Drama added to the platform for Premium subscribers. 

In July 2024, Hallmark announced that Hallmark Movies Now would rebrand as Hallmark+ in September 2024, with plans for new original series and movies, as well as rewards tied to Hallmark Cards and its retail offerings.

===Hallmark Home Entertainment===
Hallmark Home Entertainment was a home video distribution company which was sold to Live Entertainment, a predecessor company of Lionsgate.

Hallmark Home Entertainment was formed by Hallmark Cards in January 1995 to distribute films to the home video market. With Hallmark Hall of Fame and RHI films owned films in home video market deals until 1996 with their primary distributors, Republic Pictures and Cabin Fever Entertainment respectively, the division had to acquire films to distribute from other production companies. The Samuel Goldwyn Company was first to sign with Hallmark Home a four-year deal for new material in January 1995 with expectations to go exclusively with Hallmark as its library rights revert. By June 30, 1995, October Films had also signed a home video distribution deal with the company. Its first two released, &quot;Eat Drink Man Woman&quot; and David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Oleanna&quot;, were in the week of June 30. 1995. Another Hallmark Card production subsidiary, Signboard Hill Productions, was not expect to have films available to the unit until 1996. Later on, in 1995, Hallmark Home Entertainment launched its own sublabel, which is Evergreen Entertainment. In 1997, Hallmark Home Entertainment worked with Binney &amp; Smith and their board of educators in developing two Crayola branded kids lines, Crayola Kids Adventures, for ages 6 and up, and Crayola Presents Animated Tales, for ages 2 and up, both a series of three direct-to-video adaptations of famous children&#x27;s novels. In December 1997, Live Entertainment agreed to purchase Hallmark Home Entertainment. Hallmark Home meanwhile completed its purchase of Cabin Fever Entertainment, distributor of RHI films, in March 1998 from UST, Inc., former US Tobacco. Hallmark Home Entertainment, along with Cabin Fever, purchase was completed in 1998.

===Hallmark Publishing===
Hallmark Publishing is the publishing division of Crown Media Holdings started in 2017 and is headed by executive editor Stacey Donovan (the legal name of author Bryn Donovan).

The publishing division began releasing ebooks on October 17, 2017, beginning with their telefilm adaptation &quot;Journey Back to Christmas.&quot; The division also started accepting submissions, which could be adapted into TV films. Starting March 20, 2018, Hallmark Publishing made their book available in trade paperback. On July 26, 2018, at the bi-annual Television Critics Association Summer Press Tour, Crown Media announced its first set of original novels. On January 16, 2019, Hallmark Publishing partnered with Dreamscape Media and began publishing audiobooks. On February 24, 2020, Hallmark Publishing partnered with Walmart on a mass market paperback program. On October 1, 2020, Simon &amp; Schuster became the distributor for eBooks and print editions from Hallmark Publishing. Two Hallmark Publishing books have been adapted into Hallmark movies: &quot;The Secret Ingredient&quot; by Nancy Naigle, and &quot;A Timeless Christmas&quot; by Alexis Stanton (original treatment by Stacey Donovan.) In 2019 and 2020, two Hallmark Publishing titles—&quot;Wrapped Up in Christmas&quot; by Janice Lynn, and &quot;Country Hearts&quot; by Cindi Madsen—hit the &quot;USA Today&quot; bestseller list. &quot;Christmas Charms&quot; by Teri Wilson was named one of the &quot;Best Romance Novels of 2020&quot; by &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine.

===Signboard Hill Productions===
Signboard Hill Productions, Inc. was a production company owned by Hallmark Entertainment.

The subsidiary was started in February 1992 by Hallmark Cards for the Hall of Fame series and to leverage Hall of Fame production expertise towards additional projects for theaters or TV under president Brad Moore (continuing as division vice president for advertising and television programming) and Hallmark Cards executive vice president Robert L. Stark as Signboard chairman. Richard Welsh Company was retained to assist Signboard Hill in developing projects as it had since 1982 for the Hall of Fame.

With RHI, Signboard co-produced &quot;Blind Spot&quot;, the 177th Hall of Fame presentation starring Joanne Woodward, to have been shown in 1993. The company started filming its first solo production in June 1993 called &quot;Breathing Lessons&quot; for the Hall of Fame film in Pittsburgh with James Garner and Joanne Woodward. In July 1993, Signboard Hill Productions signed a production agreement with ABC for 10 two-hour TV movies. These movies would be co-produced with RHI to be broadcast on Saturday evenings during the 1994–95 season.

<text>Lutrochidae is a family of water beetles with a single genus Lutrochus sometimes known as &quot;Travertine beetles&quot;. There are around 21 species native to the Americas from the southern United States to Brazil.

They are distinguished by their ovate bodies, 2–6 mm long and yellowish in color, and short antennae in which the first two antennomeres are longer than the others. The larvae are elongate, 4–10 mm in length, with short but well-developed legs.

The adults have a bubble of air held in place by hairs.

The adults and larvae are associated with submerged old and rotting wood found in shallow, fast flowing streams.

<text>Sevenoaks School is a long established public school, in the traditional English understanding. It is now co-educational, a private boarding and day school, located in Sevenoaks, Kent, England. 

Established in 1432, it is the second oldest non-denominational school in the United Kingdom, only behind Oswestry (1407). It is among the UK&#x27;s leading schools, and has annual boarding fees in excess of £42,000, making it one of the most expensive schools in the country. It is a registered charity. 

As of 2025, it is among the top 5 International Baccalaureate schools in the United Kingdom, and top 15 in the world. 

Around 1,200 day pupils and boarders attend, ranging in age from 11 to 18 years. There are approximately equal numbers of boys and girls. In 2006 it became the first major UK school to switch entirely from A level exams to the International Baccalaureate.

==History==
Founded as a grammar school by William Sevenoke in 1432 as a part of his last will and testament, the school was intended to give a classical education to boys in the area on free of charge and free of church constrictions. Sevenoke’s will also provided for almshouses for poor men and women. Sevenoaks School is one of the oldest lay foundations in England. Sevenoke was Mayor of London and, as a friend of Henry V, may have been influenced by the MP for Shropshire and King&#x27;s pleader, David Holbache, who founded Oswestry in 1407. According to William Lambarde and Richard Johnson (&quot;Nine Worthies of London&quot;), Sevenoke was a foundling, whose decision to establish the school and almshouses may have been inspired by his early history.
In 1560, in response to a petition by Ralph Bosville and Sevenoaks parishioners, Elizabeth I issued letters patent incorporating the school, giving it the right to use her name, and changing its governance. A seal was issued bearing Bosville&#x27;s initials and the motto &quot;Servire Deo Regnari Est&quot;. Ralph Bosville was Clerk of the Court of Wards and Liveries, a JP and owner of the Manor of Bradbourne near Sevenoaks, and under the conditions of the letters patent, he and his heirs were to serve on the governing body as long as they lived in Kent. He has been described as the school&#x27;s &#x27;second founder&#x27;. Supporting the letters patent, statues and ordinances were issued in 1574 and a private act of Parliament, the (39 Eliz. 1. c. &quot;13&quot; ) passed in February 1598. The school also received a number of bequests during the sixteenth century and during this period was brought to wider attention by William Lambarde&#x27;s &quot;A Perambulation of Kent&quot; (1576).

The school is thought to have been initially housed in small buildings near the present site, before an official school house was built. Rebuilding took place in 1631, under the supervision of Thomas Pett. It was again rebuilt in 1724, to the designs of Lord Burlington, a friend of the headmaster of the time, Elijah Fenton. Building work was completed in 1732. During this period the Master and scholars were housed outside the town.

The school remained small until the late 19th century. School records show that between 1716 and 1748, under the headmastership of the Revd Simpson, school numbers dropped from &#x27;a great many scholars&#x27; to only four boys. Simpson resigned and was replaced by Edward Holme, a distant relative of Sir Richard Burton. By 1778 there were around 60 pupils, and the same is indicated in the School Inquiry Commission of 1868.

In 1884 the governors appointed Daniel Birkett as headmaster. It was Birkett&#x27;s vision to elevate the school&#x27;s status to that of a First Grade Classical School. He started this revolution, reducing the number of free places to the townfolk and expanding boarding. When he resigned in the 1890s the school had over 100 boys. Birkett&#x27;s revolution was continued by George Heslop who increased the size to a peak of 134 boys, although numbers dropped towards the end of the First World War (during which 350 Old Sennockians enlisted). Geoffrey Garrod followed Heslop in 1919. In the same year, the headmaster&#x27;s wife, Mrs Garrod, started a new school for younger boys; Sevenoaks Prep School started with six pupils in the school Cottage Block. An element of selection entered the admissions process in the early 1920s.

James Higgs-Walker succeeded Garrod in 1924. Higgs-Walker introduced day houses, expanded school sports and extracurricular activities and expanded the school with the help of the school&#x27;s benefactor, Charles Plumptre Johnson, who was a governor from 1913 to 1923 and chairman from 1923 to his death in 1938. Johnson donated many gifts to the school with his brother, Edward: *The Flagpole, 1924, *Thornhill, 1924 (Johnson&#x27;s House), *Johnson&#x27;s Hall, 1936 (Now Johnson&#x27;s Library), *The Sanitorium, 1938, *Park Grange and the surrounding estate, 1946.

Higgs-Walker led the school until 1956 when he was succeeded by Kim Taylor. During Taylor&#x27;s headship the school became more prominent nationally through Taylor&#x27;s introduction of a number of innovative teaching methodologies, &quot;Mr. Taylor, the Headmaster, has built so successfully on the work of his predecessor that in the ten years he has been at Sevenoaks it has changed from an old-established minor public school ... into an experimental outpost of the Headmasters&#x27; Conference.&quot;

The school was a pioneer in the introduction of &#x27;The New Maths&#x27;, an approach to teaching the subject which made it less abstract, and more engaging for pupils. The school adopted the textbooks and examination regime of the School Mathematics Project (SMP) which had been pioneered at a number of other private schools.

The final period of every Wednesday was set aside for the sixth form to attend lectures, usually with a current affairs theme. Speakers have included public figures such as trade union leaders Ray Buckton (ASLEF) and Hugh Scanlon (AEU), boxer Henry Cooper, philosopher A. J. Ayer and astronomer Patrick Moore.

In 1968, Taylor was succeeded by Michael Hinton who was himself succeeded by Alan Tammadge in 1971.

In 1976, the school first admitted girls and moved from being a single-sex school to a co-educational one.

In 2012, the independent review of A level and IB results, based on government issued statistics, ranked Sevenoaks School first in the UK, ahead of Westminster (17th), St Paul&#x27;s (22nd), Harrow (34th), Winchester (73rd) and Eton (80th).

In 2025, Sevenoaks School merged with Solefield School, a local co-educational prep school, providing an education for pupils aged from three to 18. While keeping their respective uniforms and leadership teams, the schools share expertise in areas such as teaching, pastoral care and facilities.

The Sevenoaks School is a former member of the G20 Schools group.

==Academic==
IB results: 

In 2023 the average IB Diploma score at Sevenoaks School was 39 points (eight points above the world average). 57 per cent of students earned 40 points or more, with 73 students earning 42 points or more. Five students achieved the maximum Diploma score of 45 points, among just 25 students in the UK to do so in 2023. 

GCSE results: 

In 2023, 86.1 per cent of all GCSEs were graded 9/8/7 or A*/A, in line with 2019 pre-pandemic results. 43 per cent of all examinations were graded 9. 85 students gained 10 or more 9/8/7 or A*/A grades, and of those, 13 gained 10 or more top grades of 9 (or A*).

==Facilities==
Three buildings were constructed for the school prior to the 20th century – Old School (formerly School House, which was built with the Almshouses in the early 18th century in the Palladian style and designed by Lord Burlington), the old Assembly Hall (1890) now part of the Swanzy Block, and the Cottage Block (late 19th century). Additional early buildings, previously private houses, include Park Grange (mid-19th century), Girls International House (1700), Claridge House (18th century), Manor House (late 18th century) and Temple House (1884).

In April 2010, a new 13-million pound performing arts centre, The Space, was opened on the school campus. The Space was designed by Tim Ronalds Architects with Price &amp; Myers acting as consulting engineers and has won several awards: the Commercial &amp; Public Access category in the 2010 Wood Awards, Best Education Building in the 2010 Brick Awards, and an RIBA Award (South East Region) in 2011. It was also nominated for Best Public Building award of the 2012 Kent Design Awards.

In 2018, the school opened a new Science and Technology Centre, also designed by Tim Ronalds Architects. The building was awarded a RIBA South East Award 2019, RIBA South East Client of the Year Award 2019 and RIBA National Award 2019. It houses laboratories, the Technology department, Sixth Form Common room and a large multi-purpose space. The RIBA Jury described it as “... great cathedral of a space, full of life and light”
The school has a sports centre, the Sennocke Centre, which includes a swimming pool, tennis centre, climbing wall, squash courts, gym and dance studio.

==Controversies==

===Fee-fixing cartel===

Between 2001 and 2004, Sevenoaks School orchestrated the &#x27;private school fee fixing scandal&#x27;, a fee-fixing cartel involving fifty prominent independent schools in the United Kingdom. It was subsequently found guilty of operating a fee-fixing cartel by the Office of Fair Trading. The Independent Schools Council – a lobby group funded by the independent schools in question – said that the investigation had been &quot;a scandalous waste of public money&quot;.

===Inflation of predicted grades===

In June 2020, The &quot;Guardian&quot; reported that, as formally codified as a school policy in the staff handbook, Sevenoaks School had for &#x27;many years&#x27; exaggerated the predicted exam results of &#x27;1 in 12&#x27; of its students (20 per year).

This policy was outlined in full in July 2020 by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, which revealed that &#x27;in around 20 cases a year&#x27; the school inflated predicted grades &#x27;to facilitate the application&#x27; of the student to university. Mary Curnock Cook commented that it was &#x27;embarrassing for Sevenoaks that deliberately overpredicting students’ grades is in writing in their guidelines&#x27;.

The Charity Commission stated that it had engaged with the school over &#x27;a broad set of concerns including predictions&#x27; and &#x27;governance concerns&#x27;, with which investigation the school said it was &#x27;cooperating fully&#x27;. UCAS confirmed that it had already sent the school a reminder of its guidelines, and the Department for Education warned that &#x27;Schools should not be inflating predicted grades&#x27;. The school &#x27;refuted any suggestion that we would unfairly exaggerate UCAS predictions&#x27; and then announced that it would edit the staff handbook to &#x27;ensure there is no confusion&#x27;. Furthermore, after initially stating that its accuracy in predicting grades &#x27;significantly outperformed the national average&#x27;, the school clarified that its predictions did not outperform the national average. The International Baccalaureate stated that the last five years of predictions were &#x27;in line with&#x27; results. Robert Sackville-West, 7th Baron Sackville, who sits on the UK board of the International Baccalaureate, was Chair of Trustees at the school from 2002 until 2008, and since 2012 has been Chair of the Trustees of the Sevenoaks School Foundation, a charity that acts as the fundraising arm of the school.

On 25 June 2020, Shadow Education Secretary Mike Watson, Baron Watson of Invergowrie posed a written question to the Conservative Party in the House of Lords, asking &#x27;what discussions they have had with Sevenoaks School&#x27;. Elizabeth Berridge, Baroness Berridge, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of the Department for Education, replied that &#x27;the school has been reminded about [UCAS] guidelines&#x27; and that &#x27;Schools should not be inflating predicted grades.&#x27;

<text>CheddarU was an American closed-circuit network available on 650 U.S. college campuses owned by Cheddar, as part of internally originated cable systems that are a part of on-campus housing or college closed-circuit television systems. In 2018, Cheddar acquired MTV Networks on Campus, a former division of Viacom, to launch the channel. Cheddar also acquired RateMyProfessors.com, which was part of the MTVU division since 2007, in October 2018.

==History==

MTV Networks&#x27; proposal for a channel targeting college students, tentatively called MTV University, became public in February 2002. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the channel was seeking to compete with Burly Bear Network, which was available to 450 campuses and had been attracting nearly a million viewers a week, along with College Television Network (CTN) and the most recent entrant at the time, Zilo.

Seven months later, after CTN ended up in financial trouble and as National Lampoon had just acquired the defunct Burly Bear, MTV Networks acquired CTN for $15 million.

In February 2008, MTV Networks discontinued VH1 Uno, a sparsely viewed Spanish language music video channel, and replaced it with MTVU, to expand the channel into traditional cable distribution.

In May 2018, Cheddar TV acquired Viacom&#x27;s MTV Networks on Campus; outlets associated with that service will be converted to carry CheddarU, a new secondary feed which will stream content from the flagship financial-news streaming service and segments from Cheddar Big News to 9 million students on more than 600 campuses; universities which previously screened MTV Networks on Campus will continue to receive CheddarU at no cost in exchange for access to the campus. MTVU continues to be available to linear TV platforms via Viacom. Universities that qualify, can receive the CheddarU service for free. CheddarU is part of the ChedNet division of Cheddar, a division focusing on bringing the service to public screens such as gyms, bars, airports, hotels and other public venues. CheddarU officially launched in over 650 campuses on July 26, 2018, and was rolled out to all campuses by August 1, 2018. It is unclear when it shut down. In February 2024, it was announced that CheddarU’s college network screens were acquired by Trooh Media.

<text>Beit Alfa (; also Beit Alpha, Bet Alpha and Bet Alfa) is a kibbutz in the Northern District of Israel, founded in 1922 by immigrants from Poland. Located at the base of the Gilboa ridge, it falls under the jurisdiction of Gilboa Regional Council. As of its population was .

==Geography==
The kibbutz was founded near a depopulated Arab village, Khirbet Bait Ilfa, at the bottom of the northern steep slopes of Mount Gilboa, on the eastern edge of the Harod Valley, between the Jezreel Valley and the Beit She&#x27;an Valley in the Lower Galilee. The Gilboa mountain range stretches to its west, with the closest peaks Har (mount) Barkan (497 m) and Har Gefet (318 m). The area north and east of the kibbutz is flat, but falls to the east towards the Jordan Rift Valley. To the north of the kibbutz flows the Harod Stream, whose waters are used to fill numerous ponds. Adjacent to the kibbutz to the west is kibbutz Heftziba and Beit Alfa Synagogue National Park; Gan HaShlosha National Park is directly to its east; and kibbutz Ma&#x27;ale Gilboa sits on top of Mount Gilboa directly to the south. Other notable locations in the vicinity are kibbutzim Reshafim, Sde Nahum, and Nir David, Shita prison, and in the West Bank to the south, on the other side of the Israeli West Bank barrier, is the Palestinian village Faqqua.

==History==
A 6th century Jewish settlement–of which the Beit Alfa Synagogue formed a part–survived into Islamic times as Beit Ilfa. On 4 November 1922, Hashomer Hatzair settlers from Poland established the modern kibbutz, Beit Alpha, naming it after the nearby abandoned Arab village, Khirbet Beit Ilfa.

The founding members gained their first experience in 1921, when they participated in the establishment of kibbutz Geva. At first, the settlers suffered from very severe operating conditions in the swamps and malaria was widespread. In April 1927 the kibbutz was visited by the Czechoslovak president Tomáš Masaryk. In 1928 the members of the adjacent kibbutz Heftziba discovered on their grounds the remains of the Beth Alpha synagogue, dating back to the Byzantine period. During the Arab riots of 1929 the kibbutz was attacked and its fields destroyed. When in April 1936 the Arab uprising broke out, the Arabs again set fire to the surrounding fields.

In 1940 some of the members, affiliated with Hashomer Hatzair, moved to kibbutz Ramat Yohanan, in exchange for supporters of Mapai from Ramat Yohanan. According to the Jewish National Fund, this move was prompted by an ideological split. In subsequent years the kibbutz was one of the centers used by the Jewish paramilitary organization Haganah.

On 1 April 1948 the kibbutz was attacked by Arab mortar fire. The Arabs withdrew as a platoon from the 1st parachute battalion of the British 6th Airborne Division approached.
After the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the Gilboa Educational Institute was established in the northern part of the kibbutz. The institute, which served as a school for the surrounding area, offered boarding and had an array of sports facilities and workshops enabling professional training. At the end of 2003 the institute was closed and the complex of buildings has since been used for various educational courses. During the 2006 Lebanon War, the kibbutz took in evacuees from the border villages that had been under rocket attack by Hezbollah militants from southern Lebanon. After the war an absorption center for Ethiopian immigrants was set up here. Some 600 people are offered boarding, Hebrew language courses, and are prepared for integration in the Israeli society.
Meir Har-Zion built a farm and house, &quot;Ahuzat Shoshana&quot;, on a hilltop just north and in sight of Beit Alfa, right next to the ruins of the Crusader castle of Belvoir. The farm is named after his sister and her name is written on the gate to the farm.

== Economy==
Dairy: The kibbutz dairy was the first in Israel to use robotic milking technology.

Poultry: Beit Alfa operates three poultry houses in which the eggs are collected centrally on an egg conveyor belt.

Furniture: Beit Alfa Home Furniture builds custom furniture for homes and offices. It is a recognized supplier for Israel&#x27;s Ministry of Defense.

Special Purpose Vehicles: BAT (Beit Alfa Technologies) began making fire trucks in 1966. Today it manufactures vehicles for rapid airport intervention that eject foam, water, and dry powder. BAT manufacturers Water Restraint Systems for non-lethal crowd control of dangerous inmates and correctional facilities. BAT also expanded to become an international designer and manufacturer of special purpose vehicles for the military, law enforcement, and government and private sectors. BAT has sold riot control vehicles to more than 30 countries. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, BAT &quot;developed a profitable industry selling anti-riot vehicles&quot; to the apartheid regime in South Africa &quot;for use against protesters in the black townships&quot;. BAT&#x27;s vehicles have also been used as riot control vehicles in Burundi to suppress protests against the unconstitutional extension of President Nkurunziza&#x27;s presidency.

Guest Houses: The kibbutz runs a guesthouse with 37 units, five of them with wheelchair access.

===Beit Alpha Cucumber===
Since the 1930s a kibbutz member, Hanka Lazarson, was engaged in vegetable breeding; including: cucumber, onion, garlic, aubergine and cauliflower. Between 1931 and 1936 she developed a breed of cucumbers that came to be known as the &quot;Beit Alpha Cucumber&quot; (or &quot;Beth Alpha Cucumber&quot;). The breed became highly popular worldwide due to its excellent taste and high yield. The vegetable breeding program in Beit Alpha continued successfully over the next 30 years; constantly improving various varieties.

==Archaeology==
When irrigation canals were being dug in 1928, an ancient mosaic was unearthed on Jewish National Fund land on the grounds of Kibbutz Hefzibah. The government of Palestine&#x27;s Department of Antiquities granted permission for excavation to the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. The excavations, led by Eleazar Sukenik, revealed a synagogue and a mosaic floor from the fifth century.

The Beit Alfa Synagogue National Park established at the site contains an ancient Byzantine-era synagogue, with a mosaic floor depicting the lunar Hebrew months as they correspond to the signs of the zodiac.

== Notable people==
While serving as Israel&#x27;s (12th) Chief of Staff and after retiring from the army, Moshe Levi lived in Beit Alfa. In his later years, he was the founding chairperson of the supervisory board of Highway 6, also known as the Trans-Israel Highway. Levi died from a stroke in 2008 and was buried at the kibbutz, with eight generals carrying his body, top government officials, and hundreds who knew and worked with him in attendance.

Actor, writer, producer, comedian Seth Rogen&#x27;s parents met in Beit Alfa.

Gabriel &quot;Gavrush&quot; Rapoport (1924–2001) was a Palmach and IDF combat veteran, who helped create Israel&#x27;s famed heavy equipment rescue unit that has saved lives around the world. Gavrush was one of the first children born on the kibbutz. According to Haaretz, Israeli poet and writer Haim Gouri, a friend of Rapoport, said: &quot;When Gavrush was born, the midwife fainted. Never before had an infant come out of the womb holding a revolver in one hand, and an adjustable wrench in the other&quot;.

Israeli novelist Naomi Frankel (1918–2009) joined the kibbutz in her teens and left it in 1970. Although she later changed her political ideology from left to right, she asked to be buried on the kibbutz beside her first husband. Frankel rose to fame with the publication of her trilogy &quot;Shaul ve-Yohannah&quot; (Saul and Joanna, 1956–1967), which depicted Jewish life in prewar Germany.

Songwriter and composer Nachum Heiman, an Israel Prize laureate, moved to the kibbutz with his second wife, and their two daughters were born there, one of them singer Si Heiman.

Israel Zamir (1929–2014), son of Jewish-American author Isaac Bashevis Singer, lived on the kibbutz for 77 years until his death in 2014. After his passing, he was buried at the kibbutz. Like his father, he was also a writer.

Israeli cartoonist Maya Devir was born in Beit Alfa.

==In Israeli Culture==
Beit Alfa is repeatedly mentioned in the Natan Alterman-penned lyrics to the classic 1934 song, &quot;Shir HaEmek&quot; (Song of the Valley), about the Jezreel Valley.

<text>Ronald Milner (May 29, 1938 – July 9, 2004) was an American playwright. His play &quot;Checkmates&quot;, starring Paul Winfield and Denzel Washington, ran on Broadway in 1988. Milner also taught creative writing at the University of Southern California, Wayne State University, and Michigan State University.

==Early life==
Ronald Milner was born on May 29, 1938, in Detroit, Michigan, where he grew up on Hastings Street, also known as &quot;Black Bottom&quot;. It had &quot;muslims on corner, hustlers and pimps on another, winos on one, and Aretha Franklin singing from her father&#x27;s church on the other&quot;, said Geneva Smitherman, author of &quot;Black World&quot;. Milner would tell David Richards in a &quot;Washington Star&quot; interview: &quot;The more I read in high school, the more I realized that some tremendous, phenomenal things were happening around me. What happened in a Faulkner novel happened four times a day on Hastings Street. I thought why should these crazy people Faulkner writes about seem more important than my mother or my father or the dude down the street. Only because they had someone to write about them. So I became a writer.&quot; He attended Northeastern High School. He also briefly attended Highland Park Junior College and Detroit Institute of Technology.

In 1962, he won the John Hay Whitney Foundation fellowship to help aid him to complete a novel, &quot;Life With Father Brown&quot;, which remains unpublished. He went to New York City to join Harvey Swados&#x27;s writing workshop at Columbia University. Under the mentorship of Langston Hughes, Milner was able to get a Rockefeller Foundation grant.

His first break came in 1966 with &quot;Who&#x27;s Got His Own&quot;. The play begins with the funeral of a harsh father, Tim Bronson, and ends with a tentative rebirth for his long-suffering widow and his embittered son and daughter, Tim, Jr., and Clara. The unsuspected truths that Mrs. Bronson is driven to reveal about their father ultimately enable Tim and Clara to see the real lives of their parents, as painful as it is. The expression that has historically been thwarted, which is primarily at the core in the play, is the question of black manhood. The protagonist is a highly combative and alienated son, torn by despair over ever being able to respect or love a father he has long since written off as a fierce tyrant at home and a coward at work. The show toured colleges in New York before going to the Lafayette Theatre in 1967.

&quot;The Warning—A Theme for Linda&quot; was part of the &quot;A Black Quartet&quot; with four plays by Amiri Baraka, Ed Bullins, Ben Caldwell, and Milner, produced by Woodie King, Jr. It was put up at Brooklyn Academy of Music&#x27;s Chelsea Theater Center on April 25, 1969.

He met Woodie King, Jr. when he was 19. He would inspire Milner to write, and from that came &quot;Life Agony&quot;. His second work, &quot;Who&#x27;s Got His Own&quot;, became a smash hit off-Broadway. These two worked together for more than forty years.

Milner was the artist-in-residence at Lincoln University in 1966–1967. He taught at Michigan State University from 1971 to 1972. Founder and director of Spirit of Shango theatre company. He also led play writing classes at Wayne State University.

Milner&#x27;s works included &quot;Who&#x27;s Got His Own&quot; (inspired by Billie Holiday&#x27;s &quot;God Bless the Child&quot;), &quot;What the Wine-Sellers Buy&quot; (the first play by an African American produced by Joseph Papp at the New York Shakespeare Festival at Lincoln Center), and &quot;Roads to the Mountaintop&quot; (a tribute to Martin Luther King Jr.).

Milner served as a mentor to writer and journalist J. Samuel Cook, whom he met at a conference in Toledo, Ohio. Cook attributes the success of his award-winning play &quot;Barren Fields&quot; to Milner&#x27;s direction. In 2003, Milner directed a play at the Hope Repertory Theatre.

Milner died in Detroit of complications from liver cancer. He is survived by five children and eight grandchildren.

<text>Johann Friedrich Julius Schmidt (25 October 1825 in Eutin, Germany – 7 February 1884 in Athens, Greece) was a German astronomer and geophysicist. He was the director of the National Observatory of Athens in Greece from 1858 to 1884. Julius Schmidt was tireless in his work, it was suggested by William Henry Pickering that he perhaps devoted more of his life than any other man to the study of the Moon. During his lifetime, he made some of the most complete lunar maps of the 19th century.

According to his own analysis, he mapped no less than 32,856 craters, with Mädler mapping 7,735 and Lohrmann 7,177. Schmidt also mapped 348 lunar rilles. In six years, he made almost 57,000 micrometer settings to make 3050 height measurements of the terrain.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Schmidt was born in the town of Eutin to his father Carl Friedrich Schmidt, a glazier and his mother Maria Elisabeth Quirling. He went to school at a gymnasium in Hamburg, where he impressed with his sense of form and drawing abilities and demonstrated a strong interest in science. In the autumn of 1839, during an auction in his hometown, he stumbled upon a copy of Schröter&#x27;s book, &quot;Selenotopographische Fragmente&quot;. As Schmidt himself put it,

“&quot;The sight of numerous illustrations of shadow-casting mountains and craters made such a strong and lasting impression that it determined the main direction of my later life.”&quot;

Prior to this, 14-year-old Schmidt had been interested in botany and zoology for a while. He could not make the decision to switch careers until he could see for himself what a sight the Moon would grant when viewed through a telescope. That wish was fulfilled when his father made him a &quot;small, very good&quot; telescope which Schmidt used to look at the Moon. Leaning against a lamppost, he recognized the rays of Tycho and immediately made his first attempt at drawing the crater and ray system. This telescope could only magnify 10x, however, the objective was ground according to &quot;Dollond&#x27;s principle&quot;, meaning it was achromatic.

Reading Schröter&#x27;s work and drawing the Moon became his main occupation, and it was not long until Schmidt devised a tripod for the telescope, which could go in both up-down and left-right motions. Although the execution was rough, the wooden mount made it much easier for him to continue lunar observations. Now he started drawing entire phases, not considering the libration but paying attention to the shadows. Thus passed by 1840, with Schmidt&#x27;s habits making him neglect school.

In the spring of 1841, Hellwag, a government councilor who was well experienced in astronomy, noticed his efforts. Hellwag asked Hofrath Voss, the son of the well known Eutin school rector, to entrust Schmidt with a 1200mm focal length Dollond telescope which Schmidt found to be very sharp, approximating the magnification to be 15-20x. He saw the bands of Jupiter, Saturn&#x27;s rings and a crescent Venus for the first time with it.

In July 1841, the Hamburg Gymnasium made a visit to the Altona Observatory, where Schmidt looked through a larger telescope for the first time and became acquainted with the well-known map of the Moon made by Wilhelm Beer and Johann Heinrich Mädler. Dr. Petersen showed him the craters Gassendi and Bullialdus.

Rümker taught him the fundamentals of astronomical observation and let him use various telescopes from 1842 to 1845. In 1843, he made his first contribution to Astronomische Nachrichten, about the Sun and variable stars, with many more to follow.
=== Benzenberg&#x27;s assistant ===
In 1845, he obtained a position as an assistant at Johann Friedrich Benzenberg&#x27;s private observatory in Bilk near Düsseldorf, being tasked to with naked eye objects such as meteors, and searching for possible objects closer to the Sun than Mercury. However, the telescope made available to him was practically a low power terrestrial telescope, and the larger instrument was kept under a lock and key, as to prevent 20 year old Schmidt from damaging its &quot;outer looks and splendor&quot;.

Here, he confined himself to drawing parts of the lunar landscape instead of the entire face, using the method of drawing the same area under different lighting conditions or sun angles, the same one Schröter used. The drawing of entire phases was stopped from this point forward.
=== Years 1846 – 1858 ===
A year later, after Benzenberg died, he joined the Bonn Observatory under Friedrich Wilhelm Argelander. Here, Schmidt measured the visual magnitudes and positions for Hora V of the Berlin Academy of Sciences star chart and catalogue project. He was not able to continue observing the Moon due to his job, but he still obtained numerous valuable drawings, and when he did not, what was seen was preserved in writing. He left Bonn in May of 1853 due to ill health. He received an honorary doctorate from Bonn in 1868.

From 1853 to 1858 he was director of Baron von Unkrechtsberg&#x27;s private observatory at Olmütz (today Olomouc, Czech Republic), where he made only a few drawings, but undertook micrometric measurements of its mountains to further increase the knowledge of the Moon.

=== Work at Athens Observatory ===
In 1858, Simon Sinas made a proposal for Schmidt to come to Athens and become the director of the Athens Observatory (now known as National Observatory of Athens). Accepting the offer would bring him a good salary, freedom to do the research he wants to do and a site with a large amount of clear nights per year. The decision was his, as Schmidt never married, so on December 2, he chose to accept the offer. The degraded state of the observatory forbid observation. It was not until November 1859 that it was in a usable state, after a year of repairs requested by Schmidt, though the restoration was entirely completed in 1861.

The observatory&#x27;s instruments at the time included:

* &quot;a 158mm aperture f/15 achromatic refracting telescope restored by Plössl&quot;
* &quot;a 94mm aperture meridian circle&quot;
* &quot;five small telescopes for comets&quot;
* &quot;two chronometers; one for mean time and another for sidereal time&quot;
* &quot;two barometers&quot;
* &quot;other meteorological instruments&quot;

When the air was stable enough, he drew while using an eyepiece that provides 300x magnification in combination with the large observatory telescope. Only in very rare cases could he use an eyepiece of 500x magnification. He ran systematic studies on not only the Moon but also sunspots, color of stars, variable stars, meteors, comets, Saturn&#x27;s rings, eclipses, twilight, zodiacal light, nebulas, weather, seismic activity, rotational period and diameters of the major planets and satellites of the gas giants.

In 1862 he discovered the comet C/1862 N1 (Schmidt), which was named after him.

On 19 January 1865, while he was inspecting the Cape catalogue nebulae with a 6 ft refractor he discovered five galaxies: NGC 1381, NGC 1382, NGC 1386, NGC 1389 and NGC 1428, all of which are members of the Fornax Cluster. Their discovery was published ten years later in 1876 with the work &quot;Über einige im Cape-Catalog fehlende Nebel&quot;.

In 1866 he made the astonishing claim that Linné crater had considerably changed its appearance, which began a controversy that continued for many decades. Coming from such a careful lifelong observer, the claim carried some weight; however, the claim is generally considered unproven. Schmidt may have been biased by his volcano observations taken place during the same year.

He spent over two years on the first draft of his great Moon map encompassing the entirety of the lunar surface, gradually entering the results of his more recent observations from Athens, when he realized continuing this undertaking would not end well. The dimensions of the initial four quadrants were too large to capture the detail he hoped for with the necessary precision. Even disregarding this, having such large plates engraved in copper would have been very difficult to execute. He had to accept these facts and discarded the work in April 1867. He chose Lohrmann&#x27;s divisions for the second attempt, using 25 sections to cover the entirety of the Moon.

&quot;Charte der Gebirge des Mondes&quot;, as it is known, was finished in 1874. Julius Schmidt presented the chart at the Berlin Observatory in December of that year. This was the first map of the Moon to surpass the celebrated Mappa Selenographica of Beer and Mädler.

On 24 November 1876, he discovered Nova Cygni, also known as Q Cygni.

In 1878, Schmidt also edited and published all 25 sections of a moon map by Wilhelm Gotthelf Lohrmann. Lohrmann had completed his map in 1836 but had died in 1840; only the first four sections of the map had been published in 1824. Schmidt was awarded the Valz Prize from the French Academy of Sciences in recognition of this selenographic work.

=== Death ===
Due to age and distance between his home and the observatory, he stopped regularly working there from 1871 onwards. He asked the Berlin Academy of Sciences to provide him with a small telescope on an equatorial mount, so he could continue astronomical observations from his house. Schmidt&#x27;s wish was granted.

He died unexpectedly on February 7, 1884, due to heart problems. Just the day before, he had been attending a social event at the German Embassy. When he passed, the King and Queen of Greece, professors, students and thousands of Greek citizens attended the funeral oration at his observatory. Julius Schmidt was buried in the First Cemetery of Athens. He was only 58 years old.

==Legacy==
The crater Schmidt on the Moon is jointly named for him and two other people of the same last name. Schmidt crater on Mars is named for him and Otto Schmidt.

=== Major written works ===
=== Charte der Gebirge des Mondes ===
The complete title is &quot;Charte der Gebirge des Mondes nach eigenen Beobachtungen in den Jahren 1840-1874&quot;, which translates to &quot;Chart of the Mountains of the Moon based on my own Observations in the Years 1840-1874&quot;. The chart is split into 25 sections based on Lohrmann&#x27;s divisions. The relief is portrayed using hachure shading, with lines indicating slope. Schmidt makes no attempt to portray color, but uses darker shades for the mare regions. The wrinkle ridges have exaggerated slopes.

Its sister book of the same name includes Schmidt&#x27;s biography, an in-depth explanation of the charts, his observations and decisions, and list of micrometer measurements, height measurements and descriptions of thousands of features.

<doc id="855428" wikidata="Q744344" url="?curid=855428" title="Reaction formation">
<text>In psychoanalytic theory, reaction formation () is a defense mechanism in which emotions, desires and impulses that are anxiety-producing or unacceptable to the ego are mastered by exaggeration of the directly opposing tendency.

== Theory ==
Reaction formation depends on the hypothesis that:

Where reaction-formation takes place, it is usually assumed that the original, rejected impulse does not vanish, but persists, unconscious, in its original infantile form. Thus, where love is experienced as a reaction formation against hate, we cannot say that love is substituted for hate, because the original aggressive feelings still exist underneath the affectionate exterior that merely &quot;masks&quot; the hate to hide it from awareness.

In a diagnostic setting, the existence of a reaction-formation rather than a &#x27;simple&#x27; emotion would be suspected where &quot;exaggeration&quot;, &quot;compulsiveness&quot; and &quot;inflexibility&quot; were observed. For example,

Reaction formation is an effective form of disguise, and can be utilized in many forms. For example, &quot;solicitude may be a reaction-formation against cruelty, cleanliness against coprophilia&quot;. An analyst might explain a client&#x27;s unconditional pacifism as a reaction formation against their sadism. In addition, 

Even more counter-intuitively, according to this model

The concept of reaction formation has been used to explain responses to external threats as well as internal anxieties. In the phenomenon described as Stockholm syndrome, a hostage or kidnap victim &#x27;falls in love&#x27; with the feared and hated person who has complete power over them. Similarly, paradoxical reports exist of powerless and vulnerable inmates of Nazi camps creating &#x27;favourites&#x27; among the guards and even collecting objects discarded by them. The mechanism of reaction formation is often characteristic of obsessional neuroses. When this mechanism is overused, especially during the formation of the ego, it can become a permanent character trait. This is often seen in those with obsessional character and obsessive personality disorders. This does not imply that its periodic usage is always obsessional, but that it can lead to obsessional behavior.

== Research ==
A few studies have found evidence for the existence of reaction formation. 

Women who scored high on sex-related guilt feelings claimed lower arousal when exposed to erotic stimulus, but physiological measures showed higher than average sexual responses. When Caucasians who actually showed non-racist, egalitarian tendencies were told they scored high for racist tendencies, they gave more money to an African-American panhandler when leaving the testing lab than those who were not accused of harboring racist sentiments.

<doc id="855441" wikidata="Q1625046" url="?curid=855441" title="Holocaust (band)">
<text>Holocaust are a Scottish heavy metal band founded in 1977 and based in Edinburgh.

The band&#x27;s lineup is John Mortimer guitar and vocals, Scott Wallace drums and Mark McGrath bass. The original lineup featured guitarists John Mortimer and Ed Dudley, vocalist Gary Lettice, bassist Robin Begg and drummer Nick Brockie. In 1983, guitar player Ed Dudley left the band, forming and releasing an album under the moniker Hologram. Holocaust was one of the Scottish bands in the new wave of British heavy metal scene in the late 1970s and early 1980s, deviating from the more commercial new wave music of the day, and combining earlier metal with the tempo and attitude of punk rock.

The John Mortimer-led Holocaust incorporated many progressive metal, thrash metal and post-punk influences into its sound, releasing complex pieces such as the &quot;Sound of Souls&quot; EP and concept album &quot;Covenant&quot;. The band&#x27;s three-piece lineup has remained the same since 2003, releasing the EP &quot;Expander&quot; and the album &quot;Predator&quot; in 2015, and most recently the album &quot;Elder Gods&quot; in 2019.

Holocaust&#x27;s song, &quot;The Small Hours&quot;, was covered by Metallica in 1987 and released on their &quot;The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited&quot; EP, and reappeared on their 1998 compilation album &quot;Garage Inc.&quot;

In 1996, Holocaust recorded a cover of Metallica&#x27;s &quot;Master of Puppets&quot; for the compilation &quot;Metal Militia: A Tribute To Metallica II&quot;.
