<text>Martin Richard Attlee, 2nd Earl Attlee (10 August 1927 – 27 July 1991) was a British politician and a founding member of the Social Democratic Party. He was the only son of former British Prime Minister Clement Attlee.

==Early life==
Attlee suffered badly from dyslexia, and was a poor student as a child. His father chose to tackle this issue by having his son educated at Millfield School, which under its founding headmaster, the educationalist Jack Meyer, was noted for its progressive approach to reading problems. Attlee did well enough to study at the School of Navigation at University College, Southampton (now the University of Southampton), and served from 1945 to 1950 in the Merchant Navy. After a spell working for Iberian Airways, among other companies, he eventually joined British Rail&#x27;s Southern Region, working for a long time in its public relations department; it was this experience that prompted him to write his book &quot;Bluff Your Way in PR&quot; (1971).

==Parliamentary career==
Attlee inherited the earldom, which carried with it a seat in the House of Lords, on his father&#x27;s death in 1967. For some fourteen years he sat on the Labour Party benches, as his father had done, but in 1981 he joined the Social Democratic Party (SDP). After the SDP opted for merger with the Liberal Party, Attlee was one of the minority who chose to remain in the &#x27;continuing&#x27; SDP led by David Owen, standing for that party in the Hampshire Central European Parliament by-election in December 1988, where he received 5,952 votes (7.7%). At the time, he commented that &quot;Some people say that my father must be turning in his grave. But if so, it would only be because of the sight of the present so-called Labour Party.&quot;

==Personal life==
Attlee married Anne Henderson on 16 February 1955. They had a son and a daughter before divorcing in 1988. Attlee married Margaret Gouriet the same year.

==Death==
Attlee died at Southampton General Hospital on 27 July 1991 at the age of 63 following a stroke. His peerage was inherited by his son John, who takes the Conservative whip.

<text>Flaming Gorge Reservoir is the largest reservoir in Wyoming, on the Green River, impounded behind the Flaming Gorge Dam. Construction on the dam began in 1958 and was completed in 1964. The reservoir stores of water when measured at an elevation of above sea-level (maximum).

==Location==
The reservoir is mainly in southwest Wyoming and partially in northeastern Utah.
The northern tip of the reservoir is southeast of Green River, Wyoming, southwest of Rock Springs, Wyoming, and the Southern tip is approximately north of Vernal, Utah. The lake straddles the Utah-Wyoming border. The nearby town of Dutch John, Utah, was built to serve as a base camp during construction of the dam, and as an administrative site afterwards.

==Geology==
The foundation of the reservoir is a steep-sided narrow canyon composed of siliceous sandstone and hard quartzites inter-bedded with softer shales, siltstones, and argillites. About east of the dam, a road cut has revealed a fault scarp on the southbound side with about of slippage.

==Recreation==
Visitors enjoy hiking, boating, fishing, windsurfing, camping, backpacking, cross-country skiing, and snowmobiling within Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area, which is operated by Ashley National Forest. Camp sites can be found close to the dam and along Highway 191 for a fee, as well as free throughout the area. Campgrounds operated by the U.S. Forest Service close in the winter months, with the exception of Dripping Springs near Dutch John. There are also public camp sites at Buck Board and Lucerne Marinas, along Highway 530 on the west side of the reservoir. The many available fish species in the reservoir and surrounding lakes are Colorado River Cutthroat trout, Brown trout, Rainbow trout, Lake trout, Kokanee salmon, Smallmouth bass, Burbot and Common carp. The Green River is a popular spot for fishing, mainly below the dam. The river&#x27;s ice cold water and beautiful structure make it a world class, world-renowned fly fishing stream.

<text>Sa&#x27;id Pasha al-Mufti (; ; 26 June 1898 – 25 March 1989) was a Jordanian politician and diplomat who served as the 9th Prime Minister of Jordan, a position he served three terms in between 14 April 1950 and 1 July 1956. 

Al-Mufti lived in Jabal Amman, an affluent area in Jordan&#x27;s capital of Amman; his house became known for its unique architecture and was later dubbed Al-Mufti House.

He was of Circassian origin and was an independent politician, serving in several terms as interior minister (1944–1945, 1948–1950, 1951–1953 and 1957). He was Minister of Finance in 1945, and served as the President of the Senate of Jordan from December 1956 to July 1963 and from November 1965 to November 1974.

A street in the Sweifieh area of Amman was named after him in his honor, where the Embassy of Bosnia and Herzegovina is located.

<doc id="852048" wikidata="Q1937271" url="?curid=852048" title="Minié ball">
<text>The Minié ball, or Minie ball, is a type of hollow-based bullet designed by Claude-Étienne Minié for muzzle-loaded, rifled muskets. Invented in 1846 shortly followed by the Minié rifle, the Minié ball came to prominence during the Crimean War and the American Civil War where it was found to inflict significantly more serious wounds than earlier round musket balls. Both the American Springfield Model 1861 and the British Pattern 1853 Enfield rifled muskets, the most common weapons found during the American Civil War, used the Minié ball. 

Rifling, the addition of spiral grooves inside a gun barrel, imparts a stabilizing spin to a projectile for better external ballistics, greatly increasing the effective range and accuracy of the gun. Before the introduction of the Minié ball, which themselves needed greasing, balls had to be rammed down the barrel, sometimes with a mallet, because gunpowder residue would foul a rifled bore after a relatively small number of shots, requiring frequent cleaning of the gun. The development of the Minié ball was significant because it was the first projectile type that could be made with a loose enough fit to easily slide down the barrel of a rifled long gun, yet maintain good accuracy during firing due to obturation by expansion of the bullet&#x27;s base when fired.

== Designs ==
The Minié ball is a cylindro-conoidal bullet with grease-filled cannelures on its exterior and a cone-shaped hollow in its base. Minié designed the bullet with a small iron plug, and lead skirting that would expand under the pressure of gunpowder deflagration causing the bullet to obturate, and grip the rifling grooves. This maximized muzzle velocity by creating a good bullet-to-bore seal with minimal pressure loss.

A precursor to the Minié ball was created in the 1830s by French Army captains Montgomery and Henri-Gustave Delvigne. Their design was made to allow rapid muzzle loading of rifles, an innovation that brought about the widespread use of the rifle rather than the smoothbore musket as a mass battlefield weapon. Delvigne had invented a ball that could expand upon ramming to fit the grooves of a rifle in 1826. The cylindro-conoidal ball design had been proposed in 1832 by Captain John Norton, but had not been adopted.

Captain James H. Burton, an armorer at the Harpers Ferry Armory, developed a major improvement on Minié&#x27;s design when he added a deep conical cavity at the base of the ball, which more efficiently filled up with gas and expanded the bullet&#x27;s skirt upon firing. A higher percentage of the explosive force went toward forward projectile motion and lesser percentage toward fitting into the rifling. Burton&#x27;s modified Minie ball had decreased mass and increased speed, resulting in increased energy and better range, as well as a cheaper bullet, which was used in the Crimean War and then the American Civil War. Burton&#x27;s version of the ball weighed 1.14 ounces.

== Use ==
The Minié ball could be quickly removed from the paper cartridge, with the gunpowder poured down the barrel and the unexpanded bullet pushed down after it passed the muzzle rifling and any carbon build up from prior shots. It was then rammed with the ramrod, which packed the charge and filled the hollow base with powder. When the rifle was fired, the exploding gas in the base of the bullet expanded the skirt to engage the rifling, providing spin for accuracy and a better seal for consistent velocity and longer range.

== Effects ==

Wounds inflicted by the conical Minié ball were different from those caused by the round balls from smoothbore muskets, since the conical ball had a higher muzzle velocity and greater mass, and easily penetrated the human body. Round balls tended to remain lodged in the flesh, and they were often observed to take a winding path through the body. Flexed muscles and tendons, as well as bone, could cause the round ball to deviate from a straight path. The Minié ball tended to cut a straight path and usually went all the way through the injured part; the ball seldom remained lodged in the body. If a Minié ball struck a bone, it usually shattered it. The damage to bones and resulting compound fractures were usually severe enough to necessitate amputation. A hit on a major blood vessel could also have serious and often lethal consequences.

One of the more infamous documented cases involving Minié ball injuries concerned a Confederate soldier wounded during Jubal Early&#x27;s raid on Washington, D.C. on July 12, 1864. The soldier, a private in the 53rd North Carolina Infantry, was hit in the side of the head by a .58 caliber Minié ball, which shattered his skull and lodged in the right hemisphere of the brain. He went into convulsions and became paralyzed on one side of his body, but started recovering within eight days of being hospitalized. However, within three more days, his condition deteriorated and he eventually lost consciousness and died, having survived with his wound for 16 days. An autopsy of the soldier found that the right hemisphere of the brain was extensively damaged and large areas of it had necrosed. The brain was removed, preserved in formaldehyde and donated to the Army Museum in Washington. The primary cause of death had been infection caused by both the initial injury and subsequent necrosis of brain tissue.

<text>The urban area of [[Copenhagen]] (also known as Greater Copenhagen) ( or ), lying mostly in the Capital Region of Denmark but also in Region Zealand, consist of Copenhagen and Frederiksberg municipalities and the former Copenhagen County. In all, it consists of 18 municipalities, and except parts of Ballerup, Greve (of former Roskilde County), Ishøj, former Søllerød and former Værløse, mentioned with (the part of) their population included from 2007. Ishøj and Greve Strand are included for the first time since 1999. As of 1 January 2024, this area had a population of 1,378,649. Statistics Denmark states that the definition of the urban area is based on UN&#x27;s 200m definition.

==List of municipalities==
According to Danmarks Statistik, since January 1, 2007 Hovedstadsområdet (English: &quot;the Capital area&quot;) comprises the following municipalities () (population, as of 1 January 2018, mentioned if only &quot;part&quot; of the municipality belongs to the urban area) :

* Copenhagen (a large area of western Amager is unpopulated) - 644,431
* Frederiksberg - 104,410
* Albertslund - 27,743
* Ballerup - 48,295
* Brøndby - 35,538
* Furesø (former Farum and Værløse) - 40,911
* Gentofte - 75,803
* Gladsaxe - 69,484
* Glostrup - 22,663
* Greve Strand - 49,974
* Herlev - 28,572
* Hvidovre - 53,282
* Ishøj - 22,988
* Lyngby-Taarbæk - 55,472
* Rødovre - 39,343
* Rudersdal (former Birkerød and Søllerød) - 55,989
* Taastrup - 50.686
* Tårnby (a very large area of western Amager and the Saltholm (2 inhabitants (2020)) and Peberholm (nature habitat) islands are unpopulated) - 43,063
* Vallensbæk - 16,280

==Hovedstadsområdet vs. urban area of Copenhagen==
However Hovedstadsområdet () is not a definition for the urban area of Copenhagen. The area does not follow the recommendations of the United Nations regarding urban definitions (i.e. 200 meters between buildings as the required minimum) and is used for statistic issues only. The main difference between &quot;Hovedstadsområdet&quot; and
common urban area definition (or &quot;city limits&quot;) involves the islands of Amager, Saltholm and Peberholm, and primarily the municipality of Tårnby.
Copenhagen Municipality, Tårnby Municipality and Dragør Municipality is the three Municipality&#x27;s on The Island of Amager.

&quot;Hovedstadsområdet&quot; contains the entire Copenhagen and Tårnby municipalities, although the latter contains large areas without buildings and inhabitants. This also applies to a smaller part of Copenhagen on Amager island.

The western part of Amager is an enlargement from a shallow part of the Øresund sea, gained from the sea during the 1930s to 1950s. This extended part of Amager is split between Copenhagen and Tårnby municipalities, and is only built-up on two minor areas. It also includes along the harbour and around Bella Center (which hosted the climate meeting COP 15 in December 2009). Apart from these smaller areas and an allotment-garden cottage area, the vast majority of western Amager is unplanned, with few buildings (like a shooting range). The cause for this creation was mainly to give shelter to the southern part of Copenhagen harbour. Since the area is now filled out with big stones, sand from the sea, plaster, wastes and unknown items, building in the area is expensive. Not even agriculture is possible due to bad soil. (However the southern part of Amager has agricultural areas and even a small forest, &quot;Kongelunden&quot; (&quot;King&#x27;s Grove&quot;). These areas belong to a third municipality of Amager island, Dragør.)

Some of the unused area belongs to Copenhagen Municipality, but the Dragør Municipality and Tårnby Municipality part is far larger. Also the almost unpopulated islands of &quot;Saltholm&quot; (3 inhabitants in 2010) and &quot;Peberholm&quot; (unpopulated) belongs to Tårnby, and so does the taxi and runway system of Copenhagen Airport (with three long runways). In all, most of Tårnby and a minor part of Copenhagen municipalities on Amager island cannot be regarded as an urban area. Consequently, &quot;Hovedstadsområdet&quot; does not equal an &quot;urban area of Copenhagen&quot;.

Neither the Danish statistic authority &quot;Danmarks Statistik&quot; (which presents information regarding &quot;Hovedstadsområdet&quot;) or the Danish geographical institute &quot;Kort og Matrikelstyrelsen&quot; (which determines the borders of &quot;Hovedstadsområdet&quot;) states that &quot;Hovedstadsområdet&quot; is an urban area of Copenhagen. For internal Danish matters this is of no importance. But when comparing Copenhagen with other cities, the unpopulated non-urban areas of Amager, Saltholm and Peberholm do make a difference in f.i. terms of population density.

, Copenhagen lacks official urban borders for comparison with other cities. &quot;Hovedstadsområdet&quot; is an area invented primarily for statistical matters. It is rarely used in conversation (as a &quot;defined&quot; area). Sometimes in media the word &quot;Hovedstadsområdet&quot; represents a metropolitan area from Køge in the south to Elsinore in the north and Roskilde in the west. For instance, a regional television channel called &quot;Hovedstads-TV&quot;, &quot;Kanal Hovedstaden&quot;, &quot;Kanal København&quot; and &quot;TV2 Lorry&quot; and other &quot;Local-TV Channels&quot; covers this larger area and so on. But even in nationwide public service television news, the word &quot;Hovedstadsområdet&quot; may refer to either what the Danish statistic institute defines as &quot;Hovedstadsområdet&quot; or the metropolitan area.

Another similar area is &quot;Storkøbenhavn&quot; (eng. &quot;Greater Copenhagen&quot;). This is used by &quot;Vejdirektoratet&quot; (&quot;the road authority&quot;) only. Just &quot;Copenhagen&quot; may refer either to the municipality, which has quite stingy borders (and totally surrounds Frederiksberg municipality), or the entire city, which does not have defined borders.

Until the 1970s, the city region of Copenhagen () was stated as the three municipalities Copenhagen, Frederiksberg and Gentofte. A better description of the city core (excluding all suburbs) would be south of the Dyrehaven forest in the north, the area east of the motorway called &quot;motorring 3&quot; and north of the motorway across Amager island which continues towards Sweden. This area includes Copenhagen (with Frederiksberg), Gentofte, most of Gladsaxe, Rødovre, Hvidovre and a part of Tårnby municipalities This area has around 900.000 to 950.000 inhabitants.

Urban Copenhagen and this city region are statistical abstracts only and have no political and/or administrative implications.

<doc id="852063" wikidata="Q155802" url="?curid=852063" title="Campanulaceae">
<text>The family Campanulaceae (also bellflower family), of the order Asterales, contains nearly 2400 species in 84 genera of herbaceous plants, shrubs, and rarely small trees, often with milky sap. Among them are several familiar garden plants belonging to the genera &quot;Campanula&quot; (bellflower), &quot;Lobelia&quot;, and &quot;Platycodon&quot; (balloonflower). &quot;Campanula rapunculus&quot; (rampion or r. bellflower) and &quot;Codonopsis lanceolata&quot; are eaten as vegetables. &quot;Lobelia inflata&quot; (indian tobacco), &quot;L. siphilitica&quot; and &quot;L. tupa&quot; (devil&#x27;s tobacco) and others have been used as medicinal plants. &quot;Campanula rapunculoides&quot; (creeping bellflower) may be a troublesome weed, particularly in gardens, while &quot;Legousia&quot; spp. may occur in arable fields.

Most current classifications include the segregate family Lobeliaceae in Campanulaceae as subfamily Lobelioideae. A third subfamily, Cyphioideae, includes the genus &quot;Cyphia&quot;, and sometimes also the genera &quot;Cyphocarpus&quot;, &quot;Nemacladus&quot;, &quot;Parishella&quot; and &quot;Pseudonemacladus&quot;. Alternatively, the last three genera are placed in Nemacladoideae, while &quot;Cyphocarpus&quot; is placed in its own subfamily, Cyphocarpoideae.

This family is almost cosmopolitan, occurring on all continents except Antarctica. In addition, species of the family are native to many remote oceanic islands and archipelagos. Hawaii is particularly rich, with well over 100 endemic species of Hawaiian lobelioids. Continental areas with high diversity are South Africa, California and the northern Andes.

Habitats range from extreme deserts to rainforests and lakes, from the tropics to the high Arctic (&quot;Campanula uniflora&quot;), and from sea cliffs to high alpine habitats.

==Description==

Although most Campanulaceae are perennial herbs (sometimes climbing, as in &quot;Codonopsis&quot;), there is also a large number of annuals e.g. species of &quot;Legousia&quot;. &quot;Isotoma hypocrateriformis&quot; is a succulent annual from Australia&#x27;s dry interior. There are also biennials, e.g. the commonly cultivated ornamental &quot;Campanula medium&quot; (Canterbury bells). Many perennial campanuloids grow in rock-crevices, such as &quot;Musschia aurea&quot; (Madeira) and &quot;Petromarula pinnata&quot; (Crete). Some lobelioids also grow on rocks, e.g. the peculiar perennial stem succulent &quot;Brighamia rockii&quot; in Hawaii. Insular and tropical montane species in particular are often more or less woody and may bear the leaves in a dense rosette. When, in addition, the plant is unbranched, the result may be a palm- or treefern-like habit, as in species of the Hawaiian genus &quot;Cyanea&quot;, which comprises the tallest of Campanulaceae, &quot;C. leptostegia&quot; (up to 14 m). &quot;Lysipomia&quot; are minute cushion plants of the high Andes, while giant rosette-forming lobelias (e.g., &quot;Lobelia deckenii&quot;) are a characteristic component of the vegetation in the alpine zone on the tropical African volcanoes. In the Himalaya &quot;Campanula modesta&quot; and &quot;Cyananthus microphyllus&quot; reach even higher, probably setting the altitudinal record for the family at 4800 m. Several species are associated with freshwater, such as &quot;Lobelia dortmanna&quot;, an isoetid common in oligotrophic lakes in the boreal zone of North America and Europe, and &quot;Howellia aquatilis&quot;, an elodeid growing in ponds in SW North America.

There is usually abundant, white latex, but occasionally the exudate is clear and/or very sparse, as in &quot;Jasione&quot;.

Tubers occur in several genera, e.g. &quot;Cyphia&quot;.

Leaves are often alternate, more rarely opposite (e. g. &quot;Codonopsis&quot;) or whorled (&quot;Ostrowskia&quot;). They are simple (&quot;Petromarula&quot; one of very few exceptions) entire (repeatedly divided in spp. of &quot;Cyanea&quot;), but often with dentate margin. Stipules are absent.

Inflorescences are quite diverse, including both cymose and racemose types. In &quot;Jasione&quot; they are strongly condensed and resemble asteraceous capitula. In a few species, e. g. &quot;Cyananthus lobatus&quot;, flowers are solitary.

Flowers are bisexual (dioecious in &quot;Dialypetalum&quot;) and protandrous. Petals are fused into a corolla with 3 to 8 lobes. It may be bell- or star-shaped in subfamily Campanuloideae, while tubular and bilaterally symmetric in most Lobelioideae. Blue of various shades is the most common petal colour, but purple, red, pink, orange, yellow, white, and green also occur. The corolla may be down to 1 mm wide and long in some species of &quot;Wahlenbergia&quot;. At the other extreme, it reaches a width of 15 cm in &quot;Ostrowskia&quot;.

Stamens are equal in number to, and alternating with the petals. Anthers may be fused into a tube, as in all species of Lobelioideae and some Campanuloideae (e.g. &quot;Symphyandra&quot;)

Within the family pollen grains are often tricolporate, less commonly triporate, tricolpate, or pantoporate.

Carpel number is usually 2, 3 or 5 (8 in &quot;Ostrowskia&quot;), and corresponds to the number of stigmatic lobes.

The style is in various ways involved in the &quot;presentation&quot; of the pollen, as in several other families of the order Asterales. In Lobelioideae, pollen is, already in the bud stage, released into the tube formed by the anthers. During flowering, it is pushed up by the elongating style and &quot;presented&quot; to visiting pollinators at the apex of the tube, a mechanism described as a pollen pump. The style eventually protrudes through the anther tube, and becomes receptive to pollen. In Campanuloideae, the pollen is instead packed between hairs on the style, gradually being released as the hairs invaginate. Subsequently, the stigmatic lobes unfold, and become receptive.

Bees and birds (particularly hummingbirds and hawaiian honeycreepers) are probably the most common pollinators of Campanulaceae. A few confirmed and many probable cases of bat-pollination are known, particularly in the genus &quot;Burmeistera&quot;. &quot;Brighamia&quot; and &quot;Hippobroma&quot; have pale or white flowers with a long-tubed corolla, and are pollinated by hawkmoths. Pollination by lizards has been reported for &quot;Musschia aurea&quot; and &quot;Nesocodon mauritianus&quot;.

The ovary is usually inferior or, in some species, semi-inferior. Very rarely is it completely superior (e.g. &quot;Cyananthus&quot;). In &quot;Campanumoea javanica&quot;, calyx and corolla diverge from the ovary at different levels.

Berries are a common fruit-type in Lobelioideae (&quot;Burmeistera&quot;, &quot;Clermontia&quot;, &quot;Centropogon&quot;, &quot;Cyanea&quot; etc.), whilst rare in Campanuloideae (&quot;Canarina&quot; being one of few examples). Capsules, with very varying modes of dehiscence, are otherwise the predominating fruit type in the family.

Seeds are mostly small (&lt;2 mm) and numerous.

==Fossil record==
The earliest known occurrence of Campanulaceae pollen is from Oligocene strata. Earliest Campanulaceae macrofossils dated, are seeds of †&quot;Campanula paleopyramidalis&quot; from 17-16 million years old Miocene deposits in the Nowy Sacz, Carpathians, Poland. It is a close relative of the extant Campanula pyramidalis.

==Chemical compounds==
Members of subfamily Lobelioideae contain the alkaloid lobeline. The principal storage carbohydrate of Campanulaceae is inulin, a fructan also occurring in the related Asteraceae.

<text>The psychology of learning refers to theories and research on how individuals learn. There are many theories of learning. Some take on a more behaviorist approach which focuses on inputs and reinforcements. Other approaches, such as neuroscience and social cognition, focus more on how the brain&#x27;s organization and structure influence learning. Some psychological approaches, such as social constructivism, focus more on one&#x27;s interaction with the environment and with others. Other theories, such as those related to motivation, like the growth mindset, focus more on individuals&#x27; perceptions of ability.

Extensive research has looked at how individuals learn, both inside and outside the classroom.

==History==
=== Early approaches ===
Prior to the 1950s, psychological learning theory varied across countries. In Germany, gestalt psychology viewed psychological concepts holistically, such as the human mind and behavior. An emphasis was placed on trying to understand the overarching phenomenon of a psychological concept and how it connects with other ideas. This also led to a focus on problem-solving as a construct to be explored in the 1920s and 1930s.

In America, there was a strong emphasis on behaviorism, which focused on exploring observable behavior. Learning mechanisms were often tested on animals. Russia, or the Soviet Union at the time, provided a cultural-historical approach towards psychology that described learning in the context of one&#x27;s environment. Learning was viewed as a phenomenon that can be directed and supported in institutions like schools. Another significant theory was Jean Piaget&#x27;s constructivism, which described how learners construct knowledge by expanding and changing their ideas based on the information they receive. Sigmund Freud&#x27;s work on psychoanalysis and John Dewey&#x27;s theories on schooling and learning were also major influences during this time.

=== 1950s–1960s ===
After World War II, two major learning theories became prominent. One was behaviorism, which stemmed from the work of B. F. Skinner and others. Skinner viewed human behavior as determined by an individual&#x27;s interactions with one&#x27;s environment. He argued that humans are controlled by external factors such that human learning is predicated on the environmental information one receives from one&#x27;s surroundings. Starting in the 1960s, behaviorism expanded to consider more complicated forms of learning, such as Albert Bandura&#x27;s concept of social learning and Dane Thomas Nissen&#x27;s learning theory of culmination. These could not be explained adequately through behaviorism.

In addition, a humanistic view of psychology, led by psychologists Carl Rogers and Abraham Maslow, grew. In 1951, Rogers introduced the concepts of client-based therapy and introduced related terms such as &quot;student-centered teacher&quot; and &quot;significant learning&quot;. Maslow&#x27;s hierarchy of needs model influenced the psychology of learning because it described how people needed to meet their basic physical, social, and mental needs before they could address other less basic needs. 

=== 1970s and beyond ===
During the 1970s, learning began to be viewed as an integral part of life and the world as it started to be seen as a part of personal and social enrichment. Concepts such as lifelong learning and adult education started to appear as people began to view learning as a daily process throughout life.

The Russian cultural-historical approach started to be adopted. This approach viewed learning as interacting with incentives in the environment. For instance, Ute Holzkamp-Osterkamp viewed motivation as interconnected with learning. Lev Vygotsky&#x27;s zone of proximal development influenced educators to view learning activities in relation to the students&#x27; comfort zones.

Kenneth Gergen introduced the social constructionism approach, which posits that individuals construct mental structures from their social connections and environment. Hence, although learning can happen individually, it can only be evaluated in a social context. Jean Lave and Étienne Wenger, in their book &quot;Situated Learning&quot;, also stated that the environmental context influenced the learning outcomes.

Experiential learning, described by David Kolb, defines learning as an iterative process of experience, reflection, conceptualization, and experimentation. Robert Kegan established a constructive-developmental approach that expands upon Piaget&#x27;s stages of child development into a lifelong process that includes adulthood. In 1991, the American psychologist Howard Gardner wrote &quot;The Unschooled Mind&quot;, which focused on three types of learning: intuitive learning, school learning, and expert learning. Intuitive learning, the most natural, occurs mostly in the preschool years; school learning is the learning children engage in during the school years, and intuitive-expert learning is the type of learning Gardner argues everyone should strive towards.

== Psychologists and learning theorists ==
===Socrates===
Socrates (469-399 B.C.) introduced a method of learning known as piloting, through which one arrives at one&#x27;s own answers through power of reasoning. Socrates, in dialogue with Meno, taught this method by teaching a slave boy who knew nothing about Euclidean geometry the Pythagorean theorem. He did so by asking questions or rephrasing them until the correct answer was found. Socrates strongly supported the idea that knowledge is innate and can be found from within, a concept known as anamnesis.

===Hermann Ebbinghaus===
Hermann Ebbinghaus (1850—1909) examined learning by studying rote memory and forgetting. With himself as his own experimental subject, he used meaningless syllables to form lists that he read several times until he could restate them with high accuracy. He also attempted to recall the same lists with delays of a few days or months and then recorded his discoveries as learning curves and forgetting curves.

===Edward Thorndike===
Edward Thorndike (1874–1949) presented his theory of the &quot;Law of Effect&quot; in 1898. According to this theory, humans and other animals learn behaviors through trial-and-error methods. Once a functioning solution is found, these behaviors are likely to be repeated during the same or similar task. It was his work on learning theory that resulted in operant conditioning within behaviorism. His theory of operant conditioning is learning from the consequences of our actions and behavior.

===Ivan Pavlov===
Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849–1936), a Russian physiologist, contributed to research on learning. Knowing that a hungry dog salivates when food is present, he trained dogs to salivate to an arbitrary external stimuli. This was done by pairing a natural stimulus (such as food) with a novel stimulus (e.g., a metronome) to provoke the desired response in dogs. That proved his thesis that he could make a dog salivate by just the presentation of the sound of a bell. Pavlov&#x27;s behavioristic approach to learning became known as classical conditioning.

=== John Broadus Watson ===
John Broadus Watson (1878–1958) also used this method of learning (e.g., he caused a young child, not previously afraid of furry animals, to become frightened of them) and argued that it was sufficient for the science of psychology, specifically behaviorism. Watson is often referred to as being the founder of the school of behaviorism. From 1920 to 1960, this school influenced a great deal of North American psychology. John Watson may also be known as one of the biggest contributors to marketing and advertising, using his knowledge about behaviorism to predict and control responses from the consumers.

===Burrhus F. Skinner===
Burrhus F. Skinner (1904-1990) developed operant conditioning, in which specific behaviors resulted from stimuli, which caused them to appear more or less frequently. By the 1920s, John B. Watson&#x27;s ideas had become popular and influential in the world of psychology and classical conditioning was being explored by other behaviorists. Skinner was one of these behaviorists. He thought that in order to understand behavior we needed to look at the causes of an action and its consequences. He called this operant conditioning. Skinner is referred to as the father of operant conditioning but his theory stems from the works presented by Edward Thorndike.

===Jean Piaget===
Jean Piaget is known for his theory of cognitive development that describes how children create a mental model of the world around them. His theory is important because it is one of the first theories that disagreed with the idea that intelligence was a steadfast trait. His theory sees cognitive development as something that happens because of biological maturation and one&#x27;s interaction with their surrounding environment. Piaget did not want to measure a child&#x27;s knowledge, like an I.Q. score, instead he focused on how children did with fundamental concepts. Piaget&#x27;s theory has four stages. The sensorimotor stage which is birth to 18–24 months. The preoperational stage is toddler ages (18–24 months) to early childhood, age 7. The concrete operational stage, ages 7 to 12. Then the formal operation stage which is adolescence to adulthood. Before Piaget&#x27;s theory it was believed that children were just less competent thinkers but this theory and his stages helped to show that children think in significantly differently ways than adults do&quot;.&quot;

===Lev Vygotsky===
Lev Vygotsky is best known for his theory in cognitive development known as social development theory. Vygotsky was developing his theories of cognitive development around the same time that Jean Piaget was developing his theories. Vygotsky believed that social interaction plays a critical role in cognitive development. He places a large emphasis on culture and how it affects cognitive development. He also sees the importance of adults in cognitive development in children. Vygotsky says that development cannot be understood without referring back to the social and also the cultural context in which it is embedded. Vygotsky claimed that learning occurs via skillful interaction in which the child is with someone who models behaviors or gives instructions for the child to follow, most likely a parent or a teacher. The child tries to understand the instructions or actions provided and then stores the information so they can use it to guide their future performances. Piaget&#x27;s theory says that a child&#x27;s development must follow their learning, Vygotsky disagreed with this. He believed that social learning tends to come before development.

== Psychology of learning theories ==
Learning theories are attempts to better understand and explain learning processes. There are several different theories that account for learning.

=== Neuroscience ===
The neuroscience of learning focuses on the relationships among the central nervous system, learning, and behavior. This central nervous system (CNS) is composed of the brain and spinal cord which are responsible for controlling behavior. This differs from the autonomic nervous system which relates with more autonomous functions such as respiration and digestion. Within the CNS, there are neurons, which send messages within and from the brain to the rest of body through electrical and chemical signals. The CNS also has glial cells which assist neurons in the communication process. These neurons communicate and form connections, also called consolidation, to form a person&#x27;s cognition. Hence, learning, from a neuroscience perspective, focuses on how the organization of this neural network changes through the use and reception of information.

Neuroscience has an explanation for the acquisition of memory. In the brain, there are two types of memory called working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM). WM is memory of immediate thoughts; it is a memory that collects, organizes, and retains sensory information for a short time. Information in WM needs to be repeated in order to be retained. LTM, also called permanent memory, is memory that is retained for the long-term. Hence, a concept is considered &quot;learned&quot; when information from WM enters and gets stored into LTM.

Neuroscience also plays a role in related areas such as motivation and self-regulation. Motivation, a psychological component related to learning, also has an explanation through neuroscience. Overall, the brain has a disposition towards rewards and outcomes related to pleasure. In fact, it brings out certain chemicals and opiates that give a natural high increasing a person&#x27;s motivation. Self-regulation, which plays a significant factor into learning, are also represented by the brain&#x27;s synaptic connections. These particular connections between self-regulatory activities and tasks help people to regulate their learning.

=== Behaviorism ===
Behaviorism views knowledge as a collection of behavioral responses towards different stimuli in the environment. In behaviorism, learning is promoted by positive reinforcement and reiteration. Throughout the history of psychology, there have been many different behaviorist learning theories. All these theories relate stimulus with response such that a person or animal learns and changes its behavior based upon the stimulus it receives. One significant theory proposed by B.F, Skinner is operant conditioning. This theory claims that the consequences from behaviors will determine future behavior. Consequences to behavior that are positive, and therefore reinforcing, will increase the corresponding behavior. However, consequences that are punishing will decrease behavior.

In a behaviorist perspective, motivation is due to the consequences of behavior and hence completely external. If a consequence is positive, that will further increase one&#x27;s motivation and eventually one&#x27;s behavior. On the other hand, if a consequence is negative, one&#x27;s motivation and behavior will decrease. Behaviorism exists in many current models for learning such as rewards and consequences in classrooms and other incentives like having content mastery goals. However, it does not account for all aspects of learning. Memory, for instance, is not addressed as behaviorism does not consider internal processes. Nevertheless, learning surrounding behaviorism is still very prevalent today.

=== Social cognitive theory ===
Social cognitive theory proposes that much of human learning occurs through the social environment. Many ideas surrounding social cognitive theory were proposed by Albert Bandura, a clinical psychologist. Unlike behaviorism, which argues that learning is caused through the reinforcement of actions and routines, social cognitive theory provides a cognitive component for learning. For instance, learning can occur purely through observation, where a person can gain knowledge of a concept or acquire an understanding of a rule, attitude, beliefs, without actually acting out any of these respective ideas.

Models also play a significant great role in learning according to social cognitive theory. For instance, a person can gain useful knowledge and understanding through information gained from the model. However, solely observing models does not guarantee one will master the concepts represented in the model. Instead, these models provide information about possible outcomes and inform how the observer should act. Hence, while learning can occur without actually partaking in any enactive learning (learning by doing), the social cognitive theory learning is most effective when it is done enactively and vicariously (learning through observation).

Social cognitive theory describes human behavior as agentic meaning that humans have intentions and agendas that drive their behavior. This perspective explains lot of human learning behavior such as setting goals and regulating one&#x27;s thoughts, emotions, and behavior for the purpose of learning.

=== Information processing theories ===
Information processing theories focus on the ways information is collected, analyzed, and stored in the human brain. While there is no single information processing theory, there are several theories that can be categorized about information processing theory. One model, proposed by many information processing theorists, is the two-store memory model. Also called the dual memory model, the two-store memory model describes learning as storing information and knowledge from one&#x27;s environment into one&#x27;s short-term memory (STM) and eventually into one&#x27;s long-term memory (LTM). To elaborate, information about your environment is collected through your senses. This information is then entered into your STM, also called working memory (WM). From the STM, some of this information is rehearsed and eventually encoded into the LTM where it is then stored permanently.

Alternate models have been proposed in regards to how information is processed. For instance, some argue that there is one type of memory in the brain which has different levels of processing within it. Nevertheless, the classical model poses memory as dual memory (short-term and long-term) model.

Another related theory is the dual-code theory which splits the brain processes into two systems: an imaginal system and a verbal system. The imaginal system primarily stores concrete events and objects while the verbal system stores more abstract information from language. This theory also allows for knowledge transfer within both systems as images, expressed through verbal language, can be encoded and placed into the imaginal system.

While these theories can be traced back to gestalt psychology, many of these theories were influenced by the rise of technology, neuroscience, and communications.

=== Constructivism ===
Constructivism is a philosophical perspective which argues that much of what one learns and understands about the world is constructed. Constructivists believe that knowledge is created within and reject the idea of pre-existing scientific knowledge waiting to be discovered. With that in mind, constructivists argue that learning needs to be structured so that they challenge students to make sense of new knowledge.

Theories from two major psychologists, Piaget and Vygotsky, form the foundational ideas of constructivism: cognitive constructivism and social constructivism.

==== Cognitive constructivism ====
Cognitive constructivism, stemming from Jean Piaget&#x27;s theories, sees learning as adding new information to cognitive structures that are already there. Piaget&#x27;s theory claim that people cognitively develop by passing through several stages: sensorimotor, preoperational, concrete operational, and formal operational.

The sensorimotor stage, which occurs from birth to around age 2, is when children act spontaneously to make sense of their world. Much of these actions are sensory in nature (e.g. touching) and rooted in present action. The preoperational stage occurs between ages 2 to 7 and is categorized by children being able to reflect briefly on the past and imagine the future. However, in the preoperational stage, most of one&#x27;s thinking in this stage is still grounded in one&#x27;s experiences in the present. The concrete operational stage, which occurs between ages 7 to 11, is when children rapidly grow cognitively and drastically improve their basic skills and language. Here, children can demonstrate some abstract thinking although much of this thinking is still grounded by actions. The formal operational stage, which starts around age 11 and goes on to adulthood, is the last developmental stage in Piaget&#x27;s theory. This stage expands upon the concrete operational stage by using higher levels of thinking such as hypothetical thinking, more developed abstract thinking, and idealistic thinking.

Throughout these motivational stages, the mechanism in which the children and people learn, is through a concept called equilibrium. This mechanism is the process where an individual is able to resolve cognitive conflicts by either applying one&#x27;s beliefs to one&#x27;s experiences (a process called assimilation) or by changing one&#x27;s beliefs to accommodate new experiences and information when encountering new situations or concepts.

==== Social constructivism ====
Social constructivism, like its name suggests, believes that knowledge and learning is gained within social situations. Led by psychologist Lev Vygotsky, social constructivism has a more sociocultural approach. This approach argues that the social environment facilitates learning through certain tools such objects, language, and organizations. Through these tools, cognitive learning occurs when the people interact with these tools socially and internalize them.

A major concept within social constructivism is the zone of proximal development (ZPD). ZPD represents the potential amount of learning a student can have given the right environmental conditions. This model suggests that the teacher and student work together to further the student&#x27;s learning. Educational examples of this include instructional scaffolding and apprenticeships where the educator takes an invested and active role in furthering the knowledge of the student.

=== Motivation ===
Various motivational theories play a role in the psychology of learning. John William Atkinson&#x27;s motivation theory argues that people are motivated to achieve their best. This motivation is in part moderated by two different sources: the desire to succeed as well as the fear of failure. Another motivational theory is Allan Wigfield&#x27;s and Jacquelynne Eccles&#x27;s expectancy-value theory which states that motivation is moderated by one&#x27;s desire for success as well as the importance of the tasks one needs to do. Self-worth theory also plays a role in learning as students and individuals are motivated to learn and achieve because of their desire to maintain their perception of being high achieving.

Goal theory is another related theory. Learners usually have two types of goals: learning mastery goals (e.g. learning a new concept) and performance goals (e.g. being first place). This theory suggests that mastery goals are more effective than performance goals as a motivator. This is because performance goals may cause people to do more social comparison, such as comparing oneself to others, which may ineffectively raise motivation. Mindsets related to learning also play into motivation. Psychologist Carol Dweck distinguished differences between the growth mindset, the idea that ability is malleable, and the fixed mindset, the idea that ability is fixed. People who incorporate a growth mindset on a certain task tend to have higher motivation.

Attribution theory, which discusses how people perceive and attribute a certain behavior or outcome to a certain characteristic, also relates to motivation and learning. According to Bernie Weiner&#x27;s attribution model, students attribute their academic achievement based on effort, ability, and luck. The way an individual attributes his or her academic performance will determine that person&#x27;s level of motivation.

Theories related to control also have a major impact to learning. When people begin to perceive that their performance outcomes are not related to their own effort, this can severely limit motivation. At the most extreme, this can lead to learned helplessness which is when a person is experiencing a negative cycle where one&#x27;s negative beliefs interactions with one&#x27;s academic failures and motivation.

Various types of motivation also play a role particularly intrinsic and extrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is an inherent type of motivation that one engages as an end to itself. Extrinsic motivation, on the other hand, is a motivation that is provided externally such as external awards or punishments. Research has shown that incentives which reward task engagement lowers intrinsic motivation as it is much like controlling behavior. However, rewards related to one&#x27;s performance are more effective which can help further one&#x27;s skill, motivation, and self-efficacy.

<doc id="852070" wikidata="Q5915080" url="?curid=852070" title="House of Kawānanakoa">
<text>The House of Kawānanakoa, or the Kawānanakoa Dynasty, are descendants to the throne of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi.

== Origins ==
A collateral branch of the reigning House of Kalākaua (from Kauaʻi island) and descendants of chiefs of areas such as Waimea on Hawaiʻi island, the dynastic line was established by Prince David Kawānanakoa who was declared an heir to King David Kalākaua. He was the son of High Chief David Kahalepouli Piʻikoi and High Chiefess Victoria Kinoiki Kekaulike. Kawānanakoa was engaged to Princess Victoria Kaʻiulani on February 3, 1898, who would have become a monarch in her own right upon the death of Queen Liliʻuokalani had she not predeceased her.

David Kawānanakoa&#x27;s paternal ancestry comes from a cadet branch of the Kauaʻi royal family. His paternal grandmother High Chiefess Kekahili was a half-sister of High Chief Caesar Kapaʻakea, the father of Kalākaua, both being children of the Chiefess Kamokuiki. This made her an aunt of King Kalākaua and Queen Liliʻuokalani, which makes the Kawānanakoas the closest surviving collateral relatives of the formerly reigning Kalākaua house. The said grandmother descended, besides from the ancient line of chiefs of Kauaʻi, also from the chief of Kaʻū, a great-uncle of King Kamehameha I.

However, the higher ranking ancestry of David Kawānanakoa actually is that through his mother. His maternal grandmother High Chiefess Kekaulike Kinoiki was the daughter of the last king of Kauaʻi and Niʻihau Kaumualiʻi. She was the granddaughter of Kaneoneo, who attempted to take Oʻahu back from Kahekili II in rebellion. She descended from the lines of high chiefs of Niʻihau, Koloa, Oʻahu, Kauaʻi and Maui. His maternal grandfather High Chief Kūhiō Kalanianaʻole was a descendant of several chiefly lines of the districts of the island of Hawaiʻi (such as Waimea, Kona and Hilo) and descended directly from the chief of Waimea.

The House of Kawānanakoa survives today and in 1998 were believed to be heirs to the throne by a number of genealogists. Members of the family are sometimes called prince and princess, as a matter of tradition and respect of their status as &quot;aliʻi&quot; or chiefs of native Hawaiians, being lines of ancient ancestry.

In 1900, David Kawānanakoa was one of the founders of the Democratic Party of Hawaii. The House of Kawānanakoa in contemporary Hawaiian politics is closely aligned with the Hawaii Republican Party, a political party it helped organize since the creation of the Territory of Hawaiʻi. House matriarch, Abigail Kawānanakoa, became a national party leader in the early years of the twentieth century.

<text>Russell Charles Means () (November 10, 1939 – October 22, 2012) was an Oglala Lakota activist for the rights of Native Americans, libertarian political activist, actor, musician and writer. He became a prominent member of the American Indian Movement (AIM) after joining the organization in 1968 and helped organize notable events that attracted national and international media coverage.

Means was active in international issues of indigenous peoples, including working with groups in Central and South America and with the United Nations for recognition of their rights. He was active in politics at his native Pine Ridge Indian Reservation and at the state and national level.

Beginning an acting career in 1992, he appeared on numerous television series and in several films, including &quot;The Last of the Mohicans,&quot; &quot;Pocahontas,&quot; and &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm.&quot; He released his own music CD. Means published his autobiography &quot;Where White Men Fear to Tread&quot; in 1995.

==Early life==
Means was born on November 10, 1939, in Porcupine, South Dakota, on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, to Theodora Louise Feather and Walter &quot;Hank&quot; Means. His mother was a Yankton Dakota from Greenwood, South Dakota and his father, an Oglala Lakota. Russell had three biological brothers, Dace, and twins William and Theodore.

He was given the name Waŋblí Ohítika by his mother, which means &#x27;Brave Eagle&#x27; in the Lakota language.

In 1942, the Means family resettled in the San Francisco Bay Area, seeking to escape the poverty and problems of the reservation. His father worked at the shipyard in Vallejo. Means grew up in the Bay Area, graduating in 1958 from San Leandro High School in San Leandro, California. He attended four colleges but did not graduate from any of them. In his 1995 autobiography, Means recounted a harsh childhood; his father was alcoholic and he himself fell into years of &quot;truancy, crime and drugs&quot; before finding purpose in the American Indian Movement in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

His father died in 1967 and, in his twenties, Means lived in several Indian reservations throughout the United States while searching for work. While at the Rosebud Indian Reservation in south-central South Dakota, he developed severe vertigo. Physicians at the reservation clinic believed that he had been brought in inebriated. After they refused to examine him for several days, Means was finally diagnosed with a concussion due to a presumed fight in a saloon. A visiting specialist later discovered that the reservation doctors had overlooked a common ear infection, which cost Means the hearing in one ear.

After recovering from the infection, Means worked for a year in the Office of Economic Opportunity, where he came to know several legal activists who were managing legal action on behalf of the Lakota people. After a dispute with his supervisor, Means left Rosebud for Cleveland, Ohio. In Cleveland, he worked with Native American community leaders against the backdrop of the American Civil Rights Movement.

==Involvement with the American Indian Movement==
In 1968, Means joined the American Indian Movement (AIM), where he rose to become a prominent leader. In 1970, Means was appointed AIM&#x27;s first national director, and the organization began a period of increasing protests and activism.

===Activism===

Means participated in the 1969 Alcatraz occupation. He had been there once before, to occupy it for 24 hours under the lead of his father, Walter &quot;Hank&quot; Means, and a few other Lakota men in March 1964. (Means&#x27; father died in January 1967).

On Thanksgiving Day 1970, Means and other AIM activists staged their first protest in Boston: they seized the &quot;Mayflower II&quot;, a replica ship of the Mayflower, to protest the Puritans&#x27; and United States&#x27; mistreatment of Native Americans. In 1971 Means was one of the leaders of AIM&#x27;s takeover of Mount Rushmore, a federal monument. Rushmore is within the Black Hills, an area sacred to the Lakota tribe.

In November 1972, he participated in AIM&#x27;s occupation of the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) headquarters in Washington, D.C., to protest abuses. Many records were taken or destroyed, and more than $2 million in damage was done to the building.

In 1973, Dennis Banks and Carter Camp led AIM&#x27;s occupation of Wounded Knee, which became the group&#x27;s best-known action. Means appeared as a spokesman and prominent leader. The armed standoff of more than 300 Lakota and AIM activists with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and state law enforcement lasted for 71 days. Frank Clearwater, a visiting Cherokee activist from North Carolina, and Lawrence &quot;Buddy&quot; Lamont, an Oglala Lakota activist from Pine Ridge Reservation, were killed in April. African-American activist Ray Robinson disappeared and is assumed to be buried in the hills.

===Native American politics===
In 1974, Means resigned from AIM to run for the presidency of his native Oglala Sioux Tribe (OST) against the incumbent Richard Wilson. The official vote count showed Wilson winning by more than 200 votes. Residents complained of intimidation by Wilson&#x27;s private militia. The report of a government investigation confirmed problems in the election, but in a related court challenge to the results of the election, a federal court upheld the results.

In the late 1970s, Means turned to an international forum on issues of rights for indigenous peoples. He worked with Jimmie Durham, who established the offices of the International Indian Treaty Council to work with the United Nations in 1977. At the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation, he assisted in the organization of community institutions, such as the KILI radio station and the Porcupine Health Clinic in Porcupine, South Dakota.

Means also traveled to Germany, traveled behind the Iron Curtain to meet with East German AIM supporters, and he traveled to Switzerland to take part in the Geneva human rights conference.

Means and Ojibwe Dennis Banks were by the mid-1970s the best known Native Americans since Lakota war leaders Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse, who led the attack that defeated the forces of General Custer at The Battle of Little Big Horn, also known as The Battle of the Greasy Grass.

===Splits in AIM===
In the 1980s, AIM divided into several competing factions, in part over differences among members regarding support for the indigenous peoples in Nicaragua. Means supported the Miskito group MISURASATA (later known as YATAMA), which was allied with the Contras. He traveled to Nicaragua in 1985 and 1986 on fact-finding tours. He came to believe that the Miskito as a people were being targeted for elimination. Some AIM members supported the Sandinistas of the national government, although they had forced removal of thousands of Miskito from their traditional territory.

On January 8, 1988, Means held a press conference to announce his retirement from AIM, saying it had achieved its goals. That January, the &quot;AIM Grand Governing Council&quot;, headed by the Bellecourt brothers, released a press release noting this was the sixth resignation by Means since 1974, and asking the press to &quot;never again report either that he is a founder of the American Indian Movement, or [that] he is a leader of the American Indian Movement&quot;. The &quot;AIM Grand Governing Council&quot; noted there were many open issues and legislation regarding Native Americans for which they were continuing to work.

In 1993, the organization divided officially into two main factions: &quot;AIM Grand Governing Council&quot;, based in Minnesota, which copyrighted the name &quot;American Indian movement&quot;; and American Indian Movement Confederation of Autonomous Chapters, based in Colorado and allied with Means and Ward Churchill.

===Annie Mae Aquash===

On November 3, 1999, Means and Robert Pictou-Branscombe, a maternal cousin of Aquash from Canada, held a press conference in Denver at the Federal Building to discuss the slow progress of the government&#x27;s investigation into Aquash&#x27;s murder. It had been under investigation both by the Denver police, as Aquash had been kidnapped from there, and by the FBI, as she had been taken across state lines and killed on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Both Branscombe and Means accused Vernon Bellecourt, a high-ranking leader of AIM, of having ordered her execution. Means said that Clyde Bellecourt, a founder of AIM, had ensured that it was carried out at the Pine Ridge Reservation. Means said that an AIM tribunal had banned the Bellecourt brothers but tried to keep the reason for the dissension internal to protect AIM.

The Associated Press (AP) reporter Robert Weller noted that this was the first time that an AIM leader active at the time of Aquash&#x27;s death had publicly implicated AIM in her murder. There had long been rumors. Means and Branscombe accused three indigenous people: Arlo Looking Cloud, Theda Nelson Clarke and John Graham, of having been directly involved in the kidnapping and murder of Aquash. The two men were indicted in 2003 and convicted in separate trials in 2004 and 2010, respectively. By then in a nursing home, Clarke was not indicted.

As of 2004, Means&#x27; website stated that he was a board member of the Colorado AIM chapter, which is affiliated with the AIM Confederation of Autonomous Chapters.

==Other political involvement==

Since the late 1970s, Means often supported libertarian political causes, in contrast with several other AIM leaders. In 1983 he agreed to become running mate to Larry Flynt in his unsuccessful run for U.S. President. In 1987, Means ran for nomination of President of the United States under the Libertarian Party, and attracted considerable support within the party, finishing 2nd (31.4%) at the 1987 Libertarian National Convention. He lost the nomination to Congressman Ron Paul.

In 2001, Means began an independent candidacy for Governor of New Mexico. His campaign failed to satisfy procedural requirements and he was not selected for the ballot. In the 2004 and 2008 presidential elections, Means supported independent Ralph Nader.

Nearly thirty years after his first candidacy, Means ran for president of the Oglala Sioux in 2004 with the help of Twila Lebeaux, losing to Cecilia Fire Thunder, the first woman elected president of the tribe. She also defeated the incumbent John Yellow Bird Steele.

Since the late 20th century, there has been a debate in the United States over the appropriate term for the indigenous peoples of North America. Some want to be called Native American; others prefer American Indian. Means said that he preferred &quot;American Indian&quot;, arguing that it derives not from explorers&#x27; confusion of the people with those of India, but from the Italian expression &quot;in Dio&quot;, meaning &quot;in God&quot;. In addition, Means noted that since treaties and other legal documents in relation to the United States government use &quot;Indian&quot;, continuing use of the term could help today&#x27;s American Indian people forestall any attempts by others to use legal loopholes in the struggle over land and treaty rights.

In 2007, Means and 80 other protesters were arrested in Denver during a parade for Columbus Day which they stated was a &quot;celebration of genocide&quot;.

Following the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples in September 2007, a group of American Indian activists presented a letter to the U.S. State Department, indicating they were withdrawing from all treaties with the U.S. Government on December 20. Means announced the withdrawal by a small group of Lakota people. That same month, they began contacting foreign governments to solicit support for energy projects on the territory. Means and a delegation of activists declared the Republic of Lakotah a sovereign nation, with property rights over thousands of square miles in South Dakota, North Dakota, Nebraska, Wyoming and Montana. Means said that his group does not &quot;represent collaborators, the Vichy Indians and those tribal governments set up by the United States of America&quot;.

On January 8, 2008, tribal leaders in the northern Great Plains, Rodney Bordeaux of the 25,000-member Rosebud Sioux Tribe, and Joseph Brings Plenty of the 8,500-member Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, said that Means and the group of his fellow activists would not speak for their members or for any elected Lakota tribal government. While acknowledging that Means has accurately portrayed the federal government&#x27;s broken promises to and treaties with America&#x27;s indigenous peoples, they opposed his plan to renounce treaties with the United States and proclaim independence. They said the issue instead was to enforce existing treaties.

Means was critical of Obama receiving the 2009 Nobel Peace Prize, and also when Al Gore and Henry Kissinger received their Nobel Peace Prizes. He also criticized the U.S. interventionist foreign policy, the War in Afghanistan, and referred to Obama&#x27;s presidency as &quot;Bush&#x27;s third term.&quot;

In January 2012, Means announced his endorsement of Republican Ron Paul in his bid for president.

==Other activities==

===Acting===
From 1992 to 2004, Means appeared as an actor in numerous films and television movies, first as the chief Chingachgook in &quot;The Last of the Mohicans&quot;. He appeared as Arrowhead in the made-for-TV movie &quot;The Pathfinder&quot; (1996), his second appearance in a movie adapted from a novel by James Fenimore Cooper. He appeared in &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot; (1994), as Jim Thorpe in &quot;Windrunner&quot; (1994), as Sitting Bull in &quot;Buffalo Girls&quot; (1995), and had a cameo in the miniseries &quot;Into the West&quot; (2005).

He was a voice actor in Disney&#x27;s third highest-selling feature film &quot;Pocahontas&quot; (1995) and its sequel &quot;Pocahontas II: Journey to a New World&quot; (1998), playing the title character&#x27;s father, Chief Powhatan. Means was a guest actor in the 1997 &quot;Duckman&quot; episode &quot;Role With It&quot;, in which Duckman takes his family on an educational trip to a &quot;genuine Indian reservation&quot; – which turns out to be a casino. Means appeared as Billy Twofeathers in &quot;Thomas &amp; the Magic Railroad&quot; (2000).

Means starred in &quot;Pathfinder&quot;, a 2003 movie about Vikings battling Native Americans in the New World. Means co-starred in &quot;Rez Bomb&quot; from director Steven Lewis Simpson, the first feature he acted in on his native Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. He appeared alongside Tamara Feldman, Trent Ford, and Chris Robinson. Means was also a prominent contributor to Steven Lewis Simpson&#x27;s feature documentary about Pine Ridge Indian Reservations, &quot;A Thunder-Being Nation&quot;.

In 2004, Means made a guest appearance on the HBO program &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot;. Means played Wandering Bear, an American Indian with skills in landscaping and herbal medicine.

===Writing===
In 1995, Means published an autobiography, &quot;Where White Men Fear to Tread&quot;, written with Marvin J. Wolf. He recounted his own family&#x27;s problems: his alcoholic father, and his own &quot;fall into truancy, crime and drugs&quot; before he discovered the American Indian Movement. The book drew criticism from a number of reviewers. While Patricia Holt, book editor for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; wrote of the book, &quot;It&#x27;s American history – warts, wounds and all.&quot; In another review, writer Mari Wadsworth of the &quot;Tucson Weekly&quot; wrote: &quot;Critical readers do well to remain skeptical of any individual, however charismatic, who claims to be the voice of authority and authenticity for any population, let alone one as diverse as the native tribes of the Americas. But whatever conclusions one makes of Means&#x27; actions and intentions, his unremitting presence and undaunted outspokenness opened a dialogue that changed the course of American history.&quot;

===Music, art, and media===
Russell Means recorded a CD entitled &quot;Electric Warrior&quot; with Sound of America Records, in 1993. Songs include &quot;Une Gente Indio&quot;, &quot;Hey You, Hey Indian&quot;, &quot;Wounded Knee Set Us Free&quot;, and &quot;Indian Cars Go Far&quot;. This was followed in 2007 with his &quot;The Radical&quot; album, which included the controversial song &quot;Waco: The White Man&#x27;s Wounded Knee&quot;. In 2013, he was recognized by the Native American Music Awards with a Hall of Fame award.

Means was an avid painter, with showings at various galleries around the country and the world.

The American pop artist Andy Warhol painted 18 individual portraits of Russell Means in his 1976 &quot;American Indian Series&quot;. The Dayton Art Institute holds one of the Warhol portraits in its collection.

Means appeared as a character in the adventure video game &quot;Under a Killing Moon&quot;, by Access Software, in 1994.

Means is the focus of the 2014 documentary &quot;Conspiracy To Be Free&quot; by director Colter Johnson.

In 2016 the artist Magneto Dayo and The Lakota Medicine Men did a tribute song dedicated to Russell Means and Richard Oakes called &quot;The Journey&quot; on the album &quot;Royalty of the UnderWorld&quot;.

In 1999, Russell taped six community television half-hour programs in Santa Monica, under the title of &quot;The Russell Means Show&quot; produced by Helene E. Hagan (Adelphia Coimmnications). As Host for the series, he interviewed guests Sacheen Littlefeather, Greg Sarris, Kateri Walker and Redbone. The last two programs were Commentaries on Colonialism and Consumerism. The series has been archived at the Oglala Lakota College Library.

In addition, Helene E. Hagan has authored two books about Russell Means : &quot;Russell Means: The European Ancestry of a Militant Indian&quot; (Xliibris, 2018) and &quot;Wakinyan Zi Tiosppaye: The Case of Yellow Thunder Camp&quot; (XLibris, 2022).

==Personal life==
Means was married five times; the first four marriages ended in divorce. He was married to his fifth wife, Pearl Means, until his death. His wife Pearl died ten years later in May 2022, at the age of 62. He had a total of ten children: seven biological children and three adopted children, who were &quot;adopted in the Lakota way&quot;, including Tatanka Means who is also an actor.

As &quot;a grandfather with twenty-two grandchildren&quot;, Russell Means divided his time &quot;between Chinle, Navajo Nation, Arizona, and Porcupine, South Dakota.&quot;

==Illness and death==
In August 2011, Means was diagnosed with esophageal cancer. His doctors told him his condition was inoperable. He told the Associated Press that he was rejecting &quot;mainstream medical treatments in favor of traditional American Indian remedies and alternative treatments away from his home on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation&quot;. In late September, Means reported that through tomotherapy, the tumor had diminished greatly. Later, he said that his tumor was &quot;95% gone.&quot; On December 5 of that year, Means stated that he &quot;beat cancer&quot;, and that he had beat &quot;the death penalty.&quot;

The following year, however, his health continued to decline and he died on October 22, 2012, at age 72. A family statement said, &quot;Our dad and husband now walks among our ancestors.&quot;

ABC News said Means &quot;spent a lifetime as a modern American Indian warrior ... , railed against broken treaties, fought for the return of stolen land and even took up arms against the federal government ... , called national attention to the plight of impoverished tribes and often lamented the waning of Indian culture.&quot; Among the tributes was one writer&#x27;s belief that &quot;his face should have been on Mt. Rushmore.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; said Means &quot;became as well-known a Native American as Sitting Bull and Crazy Horse.&quot;

Means was cremated and his ashes were sprinkled throughout the Black Hills.

==Legal issues==
On December 29, 1997, Means, then 58, was arrested for assault and battery of his 56-year-old father-in-law Leon Grant, a member of the Omaha Nation married to a Diné (Navajo) Nation. AIM Grand Governing Council issued a press release to reiterate its separation from Means.

<doc id="852078" wikidata="Q3319075" url="?curid=852078" title="Mohammed al-Qahtani">
<text>Mohammed Mani Ahmad al-Qahtani (; sometimes transliterated as al-Kahtani; born November 19, 1975) is a Saudi citizen who was detained as an al-Qaeda operative for 20 years in the United States&#x27;s Guantanamo Bay detention camps in Cuba. Qahtani allegedly tried to enter the United States to take part in the September 11 attacks as the 20th hijacker and was due to be onboard United Airlines Flight 93 along with the four other hijackers. He was refused entry due to suspicions that he was trying to illegally immigrate. He was later captured in Afghanistan in the Battle of Tora Bora in December 2001.

After military commissions were authorized by Congress, in February 2008, Qahtani was charged on numerous counts. In May, the charges were dropped without prejudice. New charges were filed against him in November 2008 and dropped in January 2009, as evidence had been obtained through torture and was inadmissible in court. This was the first time an official of the Bush administration had admitted any torture of detainees at Guantanamo.

In a &quot;Washington Post&quot; interview in January 2009, Susan Crawford of the Department of Defense said &quot;we tortured Qahtani&quot;, saying that the U.S. government had so abused Qahtani through isolation, sleep deprivation, forced nudity and exposure to cold that he was in a &quot;life-threatening condition&quot;.

On March 6, 2022, Qahtani was airlifted from Guantanamo Bay by the U.S. military and flown back to Saudi Arabia to a mental health treatment facility after 20 years in American custody. His release was announced by the U.S. Department of Defense the next day.

==Early life==
Mohammed al-Qahtani was born on 19 November 1975 in Kharj, Saudi Arabia. He is a Saudi national from a large Sunni family. His father served as a police officer for 28 years. His mother remained at home to raise their twelve children. He has seven brothers and four sisters.

==Denied entry by US immigration==
On August 3, 2001, Qahtani at the age of 25 flew into Orlando, Florida, from Dubai. He was questioned by immigration agent José Meléndez-Pérez, who was dubious that he could support himself with only $2,800 cash to his name, and suspicious that he intended to become an illegal immigrant, as he was using a one-way ticket. Qahtani was sent back to Dubai, and subsequently returned to Saudi Arabia.

==Transfer to Guantanamo==
Captured in the Battle of Tora Bora in December 2001, Qahtani was shipped by the Americans with other detainees in June 2002 to the Guantanamo Bay detention camp set up five months prior at the United States Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. He continued giving a false name, and insisted he had been in the area solely to pursue an interest in falconry.

After ten months, U.S. Border and Immigration Authorities took a fingerprint sample and discovered that he was the same person who had tried to enter the United States just before the September 11 attacks. Seizing the airport&#x27;s CCTV surveillance recordings, the FBI claimed they were able to identify the car of Mohamed Atta at the airport, believed to be there to pick up Qahtani. Another military account stated that Qahtani was identified as someone who had previously been turned away due to visa problems – by fingerprints &quot;taken in Southwest Asia&quot;.

At that time, the military invited FBI interrogators to interview Qahtani. By the fall of 2002, they were frustrated by his resistance. DOD interrogators talked of using different techniques, based on a class they attended. 

Shortly after September 26, 2002, top administration political appointees: David Addington, the VP&#x27;s chief of staff; Alberto Gonzales, then White House Counsel; John A. Rizzo of the CIA; William Haynes II, General Counsel of DOD; his legal assistant, Jack Goldsmith; and two Justice Department lawyers, Alice S. Fisher and Patrick F. Philbin, flew to Camp Delta to view Qahtani and talk with his interrogators. They were trying to develop ways to break down detainee resistance and had come up with a list of potential techniques to be used.

Lieutenant Colonel Diane Beaver, the top legal adviser at Guantanamo, suggested to her command in Defense that acting with &quot;pure intent&quot; was important, and they might seek immunity from &quot;command authorities&quot; prior to using such harsh interrogation techniques. (In August 2002, the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, had provided legal opinions (later called the Torture Memos) to the CIA that narrowly defined torture and authorized the use of enhanced interrogation techniques, since commonly defined as torture).

The political appointees went on to Charleston, South Carolina to view Jose Padilla, and finally to Norfolk, Virginia to view Yaser Esam Hamdi. These men were United States citizens. Like the foreign detainees in Guantanamo, they were held in solitary confinement, where most human contact was with their interrogators, according to a theory about how to develop dependence among prisoners, for long-term gathering of intelligence by interrogators. At this time, none of the detainees, including the American citizens, had access to counsel or federal courts.

Qahtani had initially been interrogated by FBI agents, who used standard techniques based in police work. On December 2, 2002, Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld authorized in writing the use of 17 enhanced interrogation techniques to be used against Qahtani (see next section). After details of Qahtani&#x27;s status were leaked in 2004, the U.S. Department of Defense issued a press release stating that Qahtani had admitted:
* He had been sent to the US by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the lead architect of the 9/11 attack;
* He had met Osama bin Laden on several occasions;
* He had terrorist training at two al-Qaeda camps;
* He had been in contact with many senior al-Qaeda leaders.

Al-Qahtani is also said to have informed interrogators that he had received operational training in covert communications from Abu Ahmed al-Kuwaiti, whom he identified as a courier for Osama bin Laden. This was an early lead at a time when the hunt for bin Laden by other means had ground to a halt, but, as the national security expert Peter Bergen has noted, it had to be combined with another eight years of work, relying on a wide variety of techniques of intelligence-gathering, to culminate in the US government&#x27;s 2011 raid on the bin Laden compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan and killing of the al-Qaeda leader.

==Documented abuses while in Guantanamo==
At Guantánamo, Mohammed al-Qahtani was subjected to a regime of 17 aggressive interrogation techniques, known as the &quot;First Special Interrogation Plan&quot;, authorized in writing by US Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld on December 2, 2002, and implemented under the supervision and guidance of Secretary Rumsfeld and the commander of Guantánamo, Major General Geoffrey Miller. After complaints from military investigators, the list of approved techniques was reduced.

The special interrogation plan and techniques were not revealed until 2008 in testimony to the Senate Judiciary Committee during its investigation of detainee treatment, and were reported by the FBI Inspector General, Glenn Fine. The authorized techniques were related to those described in the three August 2002 legal opinions, later known as the Torture Memos, drafted by John Yoo and signed by Jay S. Bybee of the Office of Legal Counsel, Department of Justice, issued to the CIA.

Under these coercive techniques, Qahtani gave additional information, including naming 30 other prisoners as working directly for bin Laden. The military used this information as justification to hold the men as enemy combatants. But, because the material was extracted under torture, it was later considered inadmissible in court. Qahtani later recanted this testimony, saying he had given the names of other detainees only to stop the abuse.

It was not until February 2008 that Qahtani was first charged before a military commission, and the prosecution dropped the charges in May of that year. He was charged again in November 2008, but on January 14, 2009, Susan J. Crawford, a senior Pentagon official of the Bush administration, stated that she would not proceed with his prosecution. She said that Qahtani&#x27;s &quot;treatment met the legal definition of torture... The techniques they used were all authorized, but the manner in which they applied them was overly aggressive&quot;. As convening authority of the military commissions, Crawford was responsible for overseeing the Guantanamo military commissions. Her statement was the first time any top official of the Bush administration had said there was torture of detainees at Guantanamo.

Gitanjali Gutierrez, a defense lawyer for al-Qahtani who works for the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights, has said she thought Qahtani&#x27;s torture constituted a war crime.

===Interrogation log===
On March 3, 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine published the secret log of 49 days of the 20-hour-per-day interrogation of Qahtani at Guantanamo Bay detention camp from late November 2002 to early January 2003. This had been leaked to the press. The log described Qahtani being forcibly administered intravenous fluids, drugs, and enemas, in order to keep his body functioning well enough for the interrogations to continue. The log, titled &quot;SECRET ORCON INTERROGATION LOG DETAINEE 063&quot;, offers a daily, detailed account of the enhanced interrogation techniques used from November 23, 2002, to January 11, 2003.

These included the following:
* Forced to submit to an enema
* Beatings
* Placed in stress positions for long periods of time in order to induce severe pain
* Threats made against his family, including female members
* Forced nudity, including in the presence of female personnel
* Placed in tight restraints for many months on end, day and night
* Lowering the temperature in the room, then throwing water on the detainee&#x27;s face
* Restraint on a swivel chair for long periods
* Various humiliations, such as training the detainee to act as a dog, dance lessons, and forcing him to watch puppet shows depicting sexual acts between him and Osama bin Laden at his mock birthday party
* Deprivation of sleep for long periods
* Loud music and white noise played to prevent the detainee from sleeping
* Forcing the detainee to pray to bin Laden
* Various interrogation techniques described as &quot;pride-and-ego down&quot;, &quot;circumstantial evidence&quot;, &quot;fear-up&quot;, or &quot;Al Qaeda falling apart&quot;
* Threats of extraordinary rendition to countries that torture
* Strip searches
* Body searches
* Prohibiting detainee from praying for prolonged times and during Ramadan
* Threatening to desecrate the Koran in front of him
* Forced to pick up trash with his hands cuffed, while being called &quot;a pig&quot;
* Exposure to low temperatures for prolonged times
* Forcible administration of IVs by medical staff during interrogation, which were described by Qahtani as &quot;repetitive stabs&quot; each day
* Repeatedly screened a video of September 11 attacks
* Pictures of 9/11 victims taped to his body
* Forced to stand for U.S. national anthem and listen to interrogators and guards sing &quot;God Bless America&quot;

The interrogation log does not record Qahtani admitting to being a member of al-Qaeda. The entry for January 1, 2003, relates that Qahtani blames Osama bin Laden for deceiving the 19 9/11 hijackers (&quot;his friends&quot;):

2A0780 asked how one man, Bin Laden, convince 19 young men to kill themselves, (detainee was starting to fade he was going in and out of sleep.) The question was repeated, detainee stated that they were tricked, that he distorted the picture if front of them, 2A0780 asked detainee if this made him mad, detainee stated yes, (detainee did not realize that 2A780 had not started putting detainee into the picture) 2A0780 asked detainee if he was mad that his friends had been tricked, detainee said yes. 2A0780 asked detainee if his friends knew about the plan, detainee said no, 2A0780 asked if detainee knew about the plan, detainee stated that he didn&#x27;t know. 2A0780 asked detainee if it made him mad that he killed his friends, detainee stated yes. 2A0780 asked detainee if he was glad that he didn&#x27;t die on the plane, detainee stated yes. 2A0780 asked detainee if his parents were happy that he didn&#x27;t die detainee stated yes. 2A0780 stated &quot;he killed your friends&quot; detainee stated yes.

When asked about his greatest sins in his life, Qahtani responded that he had not taken care of his parents properly, had not finished college, and had not been able to repay $20,000 he had borrowed from his aunt.

==Recanting==
On March 3, 2006, Qahtani&#x27;s lawyer Gitanjali Gutierrez said that her client had recanted the accusations he had made against fellow detainees during earlier periods of interrogation under torture. He had told his lawyer that he was forced to falsely confess and name names, in order to get his &quot;enhanced interrogation&quot; to end. He had accused 30 other detainees of being former bodyguards of Osama bin Laden.

Given the circumstances of how Qahtani&#x27;s confessions were obtained, lawyers for the other detainees argued that his testimony should not be used by the military as justification to detain their clients. They used this argument in their petitions for &quot;habeas corpus&quot; challenges for their clients. The government argued that, under the Detainee Treatment Act (2005), detainees could not use the federal courts for &quot;habeas corpus&quot; except on appeal.

In its decision in &quot;Hamdan v. Rumsfeld&quot; (2006), the Supreme Court ruled that the Detainee Treatment Act and the military commissions as established by the Department of Defense were unconstitutional for depriving detainees of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and rights of due process, and that the military commissions had not been authorized by Congress.

==Military Commissions Act of 2006==
In the fall of 2006, Congress quickly passed and the President signed the Military Commissions Act of 2006. It responded to the Court&#x27;s concerns but mandated the restriction of detainees to the military commission system.

On February 9, 2008, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that the Office of Military Commissions was close to laying charges against six of the high-value detainees at Guantanamo, including Qahtani. He was believed to have been the planned 20th hijacker for the 9/11 attacks.

Qahtani and the other five were charged on February 11, 2008, with war crimes and murder, and faced the death penalty if convicted. Gitanjali Gutierrez, an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights (CCR), was representing Qahtani. Attorneys at CCR denounced the systematic use of torture against detainees and challenged the validity of the military commission. They said that evidence in Qahtani&#x27;s death penalty case was obtained by torture.

In their February 2008 press release, CCR said that &quot;the military commissions at Guantanamo allow secret evidence, hearsay evidence, and evidence obtained through torture. They are unlawful, unconstitutional, and a perversion of justice.&quot;

===Suicide attempt===
According to his lawyer, in early April 2008, al-Qahtani tried to kill himself after learning that he faced charges that could carry the death penalty. He cut himself at least three times, causing &quot;profuse bleeding&quot; that needed hospital treatment.

===Charges dropped===
On May 11, 2008, the government charges against al-Qahtani were dropped. Commander Jeffrey Gordon, a Pentagon spokesman, told reporters that it was possible for the charges to be re-instated, at a later date, because they had been dropped &quot;without prejudice&quot;.

===New charges announced===
On November 18, 2008, Chief Prosecutor Lawrence Morris announced that he was filing new charges against Qahtani. When announcing the new charges, Morris stated that the new charges were based on &quot;independent and reliable evidence&quot;. He stated: &quot;His conduct is significant enough that he falls into the category of people who ought to be held accountable by being brought to trial.&quot;

===Crawford orders charges dropped===
Susan Crawford, the senior official in charge of the Office of Military Commissions, had the final authority over whether charges were laid. On January 14, 2009, after a change in administrations, Crawford ruled that the prosecution would not proceed against Qahtani because he had been subjected to interrogation techniques in Guantanamo that rose to the level of torture. Bryan Whitman, a DOD spokesman, said that the techniques were legal at the time they were applied, according to Department of Justice legal opinions.

==Qahtani&#x27;s &quot;habeas&quot; case reinstated==
Mohammed al-Qahtani&#x27;s &quot;habeas corpus&quot; case was reinstated in July 2008 after the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Boumediene v. Bush,&quot; stating that Guantanamo detainees have a constitutional right to &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and the right to petition federal courts.

==Joint Review Task Force==

When President Barack Obama took office in January 2009, he made a number of promises about the future of Guantanamo.
He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp. He promised to institute a new review system, convening a task force to review material on detainees that was made up of officials from six agencies, whereas the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. Reporting back a year later, the Joint Review Task Force recommended release and repatriation of 53 detainees. It classified other individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, although there was insufficient evidence to charge them with crimes. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request. Some 71 detainees were determined to be eligible for a Periodic Review Board assessment, similar to a parole board, to determine if they could be released.
Mohammed al Qahtani was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release.
Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board. Qahtani was recommended for transfer to Saudi Arabia on June 9, 2021.

==Qahtani&#x27;s 2014 federal appeals court order==
On 2 September 2014, a judicial panel for the Second US Circuit Court of Appeals in New York stated that pictures and videos of Qahtani, taken while in detention, should remain classified. The Center for Constitutional Rights, which represented Mohammed al-Qahtani for this federal lawsuit, had sought to disclose these audiovisual materials under the Freedom of Information Act. The judges decided that the release of these pictures and videos &quot;could logically and plausibly harm national security because these images are uniquely susceptible to use by anti-American extremists as propaganda to incite violence against United States interests domestically and abroad&quot;. On March 9, 2015, the Supreme Court denied certiorari in his case.

==Representation in popular culture==
In a review of the drama film &quot;Zero Dark Thirty&quot; (2012) about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, Peter Bergen, a national security analyst, compared the character of Ammar and the issue of torture to the treatment of Qahtani in detention. In a controversial passage, Ammar is interrogated under torture in the film and gives up the name of a bin Laden courier. Bergen notes that although Qahtani gave a name under alleged torture, it took another eight years, with US analysts using every form of intelligence-gathering from high technology to &#x27;people on the ground,&#x27; for the government to locate and kill Osama bin Laden. Other sources later suggested the character of Ammar was based on Ammar al-Baluchi.

In the television documentary series &quot;The Path to 9/11&quot;, al-Qahtani is portrayed by Elie Gemael, who portrayed 9/11 hijacker Mohammed Atta in &quot;Zero Hour&quot;.

<doc id="852082" wikidata="Q17113431" url="?curid=852082" title="The Mahdi">
<text>The Mahdi is a 1981 thriller novel by Philip Nicholson, writing as A. J. Quinnell. The book was published in 1981 by Macmillan in the UK then in January 1982 by William Morrow &amp; Co in the US and deals with political power struggles over a presumed Muslim prophet.

==Synopsis==
&quot;The Mahdi&quot; follows several characters as they attempt to find a way to negate the threat of Muslim fundamentalism to the Western World&#x27;s oil supply. Pritchard, a slick triple agent, has been tapped to help solve the problem. He proposes that they find the Mahdi, a prophet that has been prophesied to follow Muhammad, and attempt to control him, as control over the Mahdi would give them control over the Muslim world.

==Reception==
Reception to &quot;The Mahdi&quot; was mixed, with many reviewers criticizing the book&#x27;s implausibility. &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave &quot;The Mahdi&quot; an overall positive review, calling the plot &quot;elegant&quot; while stating that the lack of a defined villain makes it seem as if there were &quot;less at stake here than there ought to be&quot;.

<text>Florida College is a private Christian college in Temple Terrace, Florida. It was founded in 1946. Although it draws its staff, faculty, and most of its students from non-institutional churches of Christ, it is not legally or financially connected to any specific church, group of churches, or religious institution. 

== History ==

The campus is located in the center of Temple Terrace, Florida, along the banks of the Hillsborough River. It is surrounded by the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club, a private country club that opened in 1922. The school occupies land that originally belonged to the club; the college&#x27;s Sutton Hall was the club&#x27;s original clubhouse, built in 1922 and one of the oldest buildings in the city. Another historic structure, the circa-1926 Club Morocco Nightclub and Casino (which was connected to Sutton Hall by a now-defunct prohibition-era tunnel), was used as the college&#x27;s student center until it was razed in 2018 to be replaced by the college&#x27;s Quad. The primary function of the student center, being the campus mail room, was relocated to the Riverview Center beneath Henderson Dining Hall. Tampa architect M. Leo Elliott was the architect for both buildings which were part of the original Temple Terrace Estates, one of the first Mediterranean Revival golf course planned communities in the United States (1921).

After the 1920s Florida land boom and during recovery from the economic Great Depression, the property and its buildings were acquired in the late 1930s by the Florida Bible Institute from the City of Temple Terrace. 

The school&#x27;s charter was drafted in 1944, and it opened as Florida Christian College in the fall of 1946 with 100 students. The college charter stipulates that each board of trustees member be active in a local, generally non-institutional Church of Christ. 

The first president of the school was L.R. Wilson, who served from 1946 to 1949. He was followed by James R. Cope, who remained in office from 1949 until 1982. During the 1950s, the Churches of Christ debated internally whether congregations should support missions or educational institutions. This resulted in a schism and the development of non-institutional Churches of Christ, which do not offer financing to educational institutions. Florida College was unique during these debates as the only college associated with the Churches of Christ which advocated non-institutionalism. Florida College continues to refuse donations from churches. The college supports itself entirely through the donations from individuals and the tuition paid by students.

Throughout the 1950s, the majority of the students were older men who wished to become preachers; according to David Edwin Harrell, the school &quot;became something of a training ground for a cadre of non-institutional leaders&quot;. In 1954 the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools granted Florida College full accreditation, which has been reaffirmed about every ten years, most recently in June 2017.

In the 1960s the school&#x27;s recruitment policies changed, and students outside Churches of Christ were pursued. A vote by the students and staff resulted in dropping the word &quot;Christian&quot; from the school name in 1963. The name change was fueled in part by the controversy that the word Christian was only used as a noun and never as an adjective in the New Testament. By the 1970s the bulk of the student body were again members of Churches of Christ, although the students were younger and more traditional than those of the 1950s. In 1982, Bob F. Owen became president of Florida College, the position he held until 1991, when Charles G. &quot;Colly&quot; Caldwell III, assumed office.

At the beginning of the 2008 academic year, Caldwell announced his resignation as president of Florida College. After a nationwide search, the college&#x27;s academic dean and vice president, Harry E. &quot;Buddy&quot; Payne, was named the fifth president of the college, effective May 22, 2009. In 2023, John B. Weaver was named the sixth president of the college.

In 2017, Florida College received an exemption to Title IX that allows it to discriminate against LGBTQ students.

== Campus ==

Florida College is located in Temple Terrace, Florida, about 20 minutes northeast of Tampa. The Hillsborough River marks the eastern edge of the main campus, which is bordered on the other three sides by the private golf course land of the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club. Across the Hillsborough River, the college has Conn Gymnasium and its athletic fields. Next to the gym is Florida College Academy, an affiliated private school for students pre-kindergarten through ninth grade.

The main campus includes one of the oldest buildings in the city: Sutton Hall, built around 1922 as the clubhouse for the Temple Terrace Golf and Country Club. The former Student Center, razed in 2018, was built around 1926, and served as the Club Morocco Nightclub and Casino. Tampa architect M. Leo Elliott designed both buildings. Economic collapse in 1926 forced their closure as recreational leisure facilities and the property passed to the Florida Bible Institute during the Great Depression. The land was then later purchased by the founders of Florida College.

The Hutchinson Auditorium, a mid-century modern building in Temple Terrace, cost $100,000 to build and opened on March 5, 1961. The architect was Garry Boyle of Tampa and the structure was built by the Paul Smith Construction Co. of Tampa with financing largely provided by the Hutchinson family.

Two new residence halls were begun during the 2007–2008 school year and completed in the first half of the 2008–2009 academic year. Boswell Hall, which holds 320 beds, is five stories tall, and is said to be the tallest building in old Temple Terrace with a top floor view that looks out over the old city as well as the Hillsborough River. All on-campus men live in Boswell. Five-story Jennifer Hall provides a new 90-bed residence hall for women. This supplements the other residence hall for women, Hinely Hall, and replaces the now condemned Sutton Hall.

In 2013, a project was undertaken to renovate the condemned building known as &quot;C Dorm&quot;, the primary male dorm before Boswell. The project was completed over the summer months of 2013 and dedicated on September 22. The newly renovated building, now known as &quot;College Hall&quot;, houses women of junior and senior standing.

== Academics ==
Florida College offers 17 bachelor&#x27;s degrees in the fields of biblical studies, business, communication, education, music, English, history, and liberal studies, as well as an Associate of Arts degree. The college is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. All undergraduates take biblical courses as part of their liberal arts curriculum. The student-to-faculty ratio is 11 to 1.

=== Rankings ===
Florida College was ranked #68 (tie) in the Regional Colleges South category of the 2022–23 Best Colleges rankings by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;.

== Recruitment ==
Although most of its students are members of churches of Christ, Florida College does not recruit through churches since the school is founded on the principles of the non-institutional churches of Christ, which per its doctrine does not engage in congregational support of colleges. Instead, the school gains name recognition by offering 21 one-week summer camps annually in locations across the United States. About 4,000 children attend the summer camps, with about 400 volunteers to teach and entertain them.

== Student life ==
Florida College draws students from all 50 U.S. states, though primarily states to the south, and several foreign countries. For the 2023–24 academic year, 591 students were enrolled, representing 33 states, Puerto Rico, and 12 countries. Ninety percent are members of non-institutional Churches of Christ. In many instances, both of a student&#x27;s parents attended and met at Florida College.

Brief devotional chapel services are held on weekdays during the academic calendar year, which all students are required to attend.

Students are expected to adhere to a Code of Moral Conduct. As set forth in the 2022–23 Student Handbook, the code forbids &quot;sexual relationships of any type outside of marriage,&quot; &quot;inappropriate physical contact that is sexually sensual, whether on or off campus,&quot; and being &quot;alone with a member of the opposite sex in a private place&quot;. Students are expected to avoid immoral environments such as &quot;restaurants known for the immodest dress of staff&quot; and &quot;any establishment that serves alcohol and checks identifications at [the] door.&quot;

Students are required to live on campus until they reach the age of 21 or have been in college for two years out of high school, unless they live with their parents or with relatives who have been approved by the college. Residence halls are segregated by gender with each off limits to members of the opposite sex except in lobbies during posted hours. There are four residence halls:
* Boswell Hall (houses all male students on campus)
* Jennifer Hall (formerly Terrace Hall, was renamed in 2015)
* Hinely Hall (built as an additional wing of Sutton Hall)
* College Hall (formerly C-Dorm, was renovated in 2013)

== Athletics ==
The Florida College athletic teams are called the Falcons. The college is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing as an NAIA Independent within the Continental Athletic Conference since the 2021–22 academic year. They were also a member of the United States Collegiate Athletic Association (USCAA) until the 2017–18 school year. The Falcons previously competed in the Southern States Athletic Conference (SSAC; formerly known as Georgia–Alabama–Carolina Conference (GACC) until after the 2003–04 school year) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 2018–19 to 2020–21.

Florida College competes in 11 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, soccer and track &amp; field (outdoor); while women&#x27;s sports include cheerleading, cross country, golf, soccer, track &amp; field (outdoor) and volleyball.

=== Men&#x27;s basketball ===
The 2021–22 men&#x27;s basketball team won the Continental Athletic Conference (CAC) Championship en route to the NAIA National Tournament. In the national tournament, the 9-seeded Falcons defeated the 8-seed Evangel University 75–72, for the first NAIA National Tournament win in school history. 

== Academy ==
The college president and board of directors administer Florida College Academy (FCA), a K–12 private school on the Temple Terrace campus which serves about 360 students. FCA shares the athletic facilities, and participates in the Tampa Bay Christian Athletic League.

<doc id="852089" wikidata="Q1188682" url="?curid=852089" title="Gravitational time dilation">
<text>Gravitational time dilation is a form of time dilation, an actual difference of elapsed time between two events, as measured by observers situated at varying distances from a gravitating mass. The lower the gravitational potential (the closer the clock is to the source of gravitation), the slower time passes, speeding up as the gravitational potential increases (the clock moving away from the source of gravitation). Albert Einstein originally predicted this in his theory of relativity, and it has since been confirmed by tests of general relativity.

This effect has been demonstrated by noting that atomic clocks at differing altitudes (and thus different gravitational potential) will eventually show different times. The effects detected in such Earth-bound experiments are extremely small, with differences being measured in nanoseconds. Relative to Earth&#x27;s age in billions of years, Earth&#x27;s core is in effect 2.5 years younger than its surface. Demonstrating larger effects would require measurements at greater distances from the Earth, or a larger gravitational source.

Gravitational time dilation was first described by Albert Einstein in 1907 as a consequence of special relativity in accelerated frames of reference. In general relativity, it is considered to be a difference in the passage of proper time at different positions as described by a metric tensor of spacetime. The existence of gravitational time dilation was first confirmed directly by the Pound–Rebka experiment in 1959, and later refined by Gravity Probe A and other experiments.

Gravitational time dilation is closely related to gravitational redshift, in which the closer a body emitting light of constant frequency is to a gravitating body, the more its time is slowed by gravitational time dilation, and the lower (more &quot;redshifted&quot;) would seem to be the frequency of the emitted light, as measured by a fixed observer.

==Definition==
Clocks that are far from massive bodies (or at higher gravitational potentials) run more quickly, and clocks close to massive bodies (or at lower gravitational potentials) run more slowly. For example, considered over the total time-span of Earth (4.6 billion years), a clock set in a geostationary position at an altitude of 9,000 meters above sea level, such as perhaps at the top of Mount Everest (prominence 8,848m), would be about 39 hours ahead of a clock set at sea level. This is because gravitational time dilation is manifested in accelerated frames of reference or, by virtue of the equivalence principle, in the gravitational field of massive objects.

According to general relativity, inertial mass and gravitational mass are the same, and all accelerated reference frames (such as a uniformly rotating reference frame with its proper time dilation) are physically equivalent to a gravitational field of the same strength.

Consider a family of observers along a straight &quot;vertical&quot; line, each of whom experiences a distinct constant g-force directed along this line (e.g., a long accelerating spacecraft, a skyscraper, a shaft on a planet). Let formula_1 be the dependence of g-force on &quot;height&quot;, a coordinate along the aforementioned line. The equation with respect to a base observer at formula_2 is

: formula_3

where formula_4 is the &quot;total&quot; time dilation at a distant position formula_5, formula_1 is the dependence of g-force on &quot;height&quot; formula_5, formula_8 is the speed of light, and formula_9 denotes exponentiation by e.

For simplicity, in a Rindler&#x27;s family of observers in a flat spacetime, the dependence would be

: formula_10

with constant formula_11, which yields

: formula_12.

On the other hand, when formula_13 is nearly constant and formula_14 is much smaller than formula_15, the linear &quot;weak field&quot; approximation formula_16 can also be used.

See Ehrenfest paradox for application of the same formula to a rotating reference frame in flat spacetime.

==Outside a non-rotating sphere==
A common equation used to determine gravitational time dilation is derived from the Schwarzschild metric, which describes spacetime in the vicinity of a non-rotating massive spherically symmetric object. The equation is

:formula_17

where
* formula_18 is the proper time between two events for an observer close to the massive sphere, i.e. deep within the gravitational field
* formula_19 is the coordinate time between the events for an observer at an arbitrarily large distance from the massive object (this assumes the far-away observer is using Schwarzschild coordinates, a coordinate system where a clock at infinite distance from the massive sphere would tick at one second per second of coordinate time, while closer clocks would tick at less than that rate),
* formula_20 is the gravitational constant,
* formula_21 is the mass of the object creating the gravitational field,
* formula_22 is the radial coordinate of the observer within the gravitational field (this coordinate is analogous to the classical distance from the center of the object, but is actually a Schwarzschild coordinate; the equation in this form has real solutions for formula_23),
* formula_8 is the speed of light,
* formula_25 is the Schwarzschild radius of formula_21,
* formula_27 is the escape velocity, and
* formula_28 is the escape velocity, expressed as a fraction of the speed of light c.
To illustrate then, without accounting for the effects of rotation, proximity to Earth&#x27;s gravitational well will cause a clock on the planet&#x27;s surface to accumulate around 0.0219 fewer seconds over a period of one year than would a distant observer&#x27;s clock. In comparison, a clock on the surface of the Sun will accumulate around 66.4 fewer seconds in one year.

==Circular orbits==

In the Schwarzschild metric, free-falling objects can be in circular orbits if the orbital radius is larger than formula_29 (the radius of the photon sphere). The formula for a clock at rest is given above; the formula below gives the general relativistic time dilation for a clock in a circular orbit:

:formula_30

Both dilations are shown in the figure below.

==Important features of gravitational time dilation==
* According to the general theory of relativity, gravitational time dilation is copresent with the existence of an accelerated reference frame. Additionally, all physical phenomena in similar circumstances undergo time dilation equally according to the equivalence principle used in the general theory of relativity.
* The speed of light in a locale is always equal to &quot;c&quot; according to the observer who is there. That is, every infinitesimal region of spacetime may be assigned its own proper time, and the speed of light according to the proper time at that region is always &quot;c&quot;. This is the case whether or not a given region is occupied by an observer. A time delay can be measured for photons which are emitted from Earth, bend near the Sun, travel to Venus, and then return to Earth along a similar path. There is no violation of the constancy of the speed of light here, as any observer observing the speed of photons in their region will find the speed of those photons to be &quot;c&quot;, while the speed at which we observe light travel finite distances in the vicinity of the Sun will differ from &quot;c&quot;.
* If an observer is able to track the light in a remote, distant locale which intercepts a remote, time dilated observer nearer to a more massive body, that first observer tracks that both the remote light and that remote time dilated observer have a slower time clock than other light which is coming to the first observer at &quot;c&quot;, like all other light the first observer &quot;really&quot; can observe (at their own location). If the other, remote light eventually intercepts the first observer, it too will be measured at &quot;c&quot; by the first observer.
* Gravitational time dilation formula_31 in a gravitational well is equal to the velocity time dilation for a speed that is needed to escape that gravitational well (given that the metric is of the form formula_32, i. e. it is time invariant and there are no &quot;movement&quot; terms formula_33). To show that, one can apply Noether&#x27;s theorem to a body that freely falls into the well from infinity. Then the time invariance of the metric implies conservation of the quantity formula_34, where formula_35 is the time component of the 4-velocity formula_36 of the body. At the infinity formula_37, so formula_38, or, in coordinates adjusted to the local time dilation, formula_39; that is, time dilation due to acquired velocity (as measured at the falling body&#x27;s position) equals to the gravitational time dilation in the well the body fell into. Applying this argument more generally one gets that (under the same assumptions on the metric) the relative gravitational time dilation between two points equals to the time dilation due to velocity needed to climb from the lower point to the higher.

==Experimental confirmation==


Gravitational time dilation has been experimentally measured using atomic clocks on airplanes, such as the Hafele–Keating experiment. The clocks aboard the airplanes were slightly faster than clocks on the ground. The effect is significant enough that the Global Positioning System&#x27;s artificial satellites need to have their clocks corrected.

Additionally, time dilations due to height differences of less than one metre have been experimentally verified in the laboratory.

Gravitational time dilation in the form of gravitational redshift has also been confirmed by the Pound–Rebka experiment and observations of the spectra of the white dwarf Sirius B.

Gravitational time dilation has been measured in experiments with time signals sent to and from the Viking 1 Mars lander.

<text>Christian Wilhelm Walter Wulff (; born 1959) is a retired German politician and lawyer who served as President of Germany from 2010 to 2012. A member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), he previously served as minister president of the state of Lower Saxony from 2003 to 2010. He was elected to the presidency in the 30 June 2010 presidential election, defeating opposition candidate Joachim Gauck and taking office immediately, although he was not sworn in until With the age of 51, he became Germany&#x27;s youngest president.

On 17 February 2012, Wulff resigned as President of Germany, facing the prospect of prosecution for allegations of corruption relating to his prior service as Minister President of Lower Saxony. In 2014, he was acquitted of all corruption charges by the Hanover regional court.

== Early life and education ==
Wulff was born in Osnabrück and is Roman Catholic. He was the first Roman Catholic to hold the post of President of Germany since Heinrich Lübke (1959–1969) and the first President to have been born in the post-World War II period. His father left the family, and he grew up with his mother. As a teenager, he took responsibility for the care of his younger sister, after his mother developed multiple sclerosis. After completing his Abitur at the Ernst Moritz Arndt Gymnasium in Osnabrück, Wulff studied law with a specialisation in economics at the University of Osnabrück. He joined the Christian Democratic Union of Germany in 1975. In 1987 and 1990, he passed the first and second state examinations in law, and has since worked as an attorney.

==Political career==
Since 1975, Wulff has been a member of the CDU. From 1978 to 1980, he served as federal chairman of the &quot;Schülerunion&quot;, a political high school student organization affiliated with the Christian Democrats. From 1979 to 1983, he was on the executive board of the Junge Union and became its state chairman in Lower Saxony in 1983. However, he decided to resign from the board in order to pursue his law degree, which he completed in 1986. The same year, he was elected a city councillor in his hometown. Since 1984, he sat on the CDU&#x27;s state party council of Lower Saxony, serving as its chairman from 1994 to 2008.
The Christian Democrats made Wulff candidate for Minister President of the state in the run-up of the 1994 parliamentary election. However, the popular incumbent Gerhard Schröder won an absolute majority in the Lower Saxony legislature, while the state CDU under Wulff received one of its worst results, leading some observers to doubt the wisdom of the provincial party nominating a young and neophyte candidate for Premier. After four years in opposition, the 1998 legislative assembly election brought another opportunity for Wulff to become Minister President. Indeed, the federal Christian Democrat party, led by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, pinned their hopes on Wulff – a Wulff victory would have stopped the inevitable rise of Schröder to the Social Democrat nomination for Chancellor. However, supported by a wave of sympathy for his potential candidacy for chancellor in the 1998 federal election, Schröder was returned to power by an enhanced majority – leaving Wulff to serve five more years as state leader of the opposition.

Schröder won the 1998 federal election, leaving the post of Minister President to his anointed successor, Interior minister Gerhard Glogowski. The latter soon stumbled over a scandal involving free travel paid by TUI and was succeeded by young parliamentary leader Sigmar Gabriel. In the wake of the 1999 scandal, as well as rising discontent with Schröder&#x27;s federal cabinet, the Christian Democrats rose in the opinion polls and became a serious contender for power in the 2003 parliamentary election.

Wulff had been one of the four deputy chairmen of the CDU party at the federal level after 1998, and had been a board member of the Konrad Adenauer Foundation after 2003.

===2003 state election===
With Lower Saxony announcing deeper cuts of education and municipal services, the stage was set for the 2003 election campaign. Wulff entered the race as the favourite to win the election and essentially campaigned on a platform of fiscal restraint and clear-cut reforms in the areas of law enforcement and education. Both issues were decisive in the elections that led to a change in fortunes for the two major parties. The Christian Democrats, in the political wilderness since the 1990 Schröder victory, were returned to power with an absolute majority in the state parliament, gaining 48.3% of the vote. Wulff was sworn in as Minister President on 2003, as the head of a coalition between centre-right Christian Democrats and liberal Free Democrats (FDP).

===Policies===
As Minister President of Lower Saxony, Wulff pursued a multitude of reforms, including a restructuration of the primary education system in the state, as well as an increase of police officers on the beat. When Wulff took office, Lower Saxony faced a severe budget crisis, resulting from years of public deficits. Painful cuts to public expenditure were enacted and implemented against considerable political resistance. The measures included cuts in university funding and in benefits for the blind. Other policies concern the reform of the administration (especially the abolition of certain district authorities). Budgetary problems continued to overshadow Wulff&#x27;s policies, albeit with somewhat less pressure. Many measures have remained controversial.

Prior to the 2005 federal election, Wulff was mentioned as a potential candidate for the federal chancellorship. In a spring 2005 poll, 28% of all respondents named Wulff as their preferred candidate for the Christian Democratic nomination for Chancellor. As Wulff had only began his first term as Minister President of Lower Saxony in early 2003, he largely dismissed such speculations. Speculation had particularly increased since the December 2004 Christian Democratic federal convention in Düsseldorf, when Wulff was reelected deputy leader of the federal party with roughly 86% of all delegates supporting him. However, the premature dissolution of the Bundestag in 2005 and the subsequent election of Chancellor Angela Merkel largely put an end to further speculation about Wulff&#x27;s future at the time.

A Wulff candidacy for the CDU nomination for Chancellor was seen to appeal to northerners and liberals within the Christian Democrats. Outside the mold of a typical conservative, he was able to attract swing voters disillusioned with the slowness of reforms, as well as the then rather high rates of unemployment in Germany. Indeed, he worked on increasing his visibility beyond Lower Saxony&#x27;s confines, particularly by appearing frequently on television shows and giving interviews to the national newspapers. Moreover, Wulff was also acquiring a profile on a broad range of issues, including the reform of the German language, Medicare and social security reform, as well as a modernisation of Germany&#x27;s federal constitution, the &quot;Grundgesetz&quot;. In fact, he criticised the consensus reached between the Christian Democratic and Social Democratic parties on the modernisation of Germany&#x27;s constitution, stating that he felt that the states (&quot;Länder&quot;) had not been given sufficient powers to deal with their own affairs. Wulff also took a conservative stand on nuclear energy, advocating an extension of the deadlines for the decommissioning of Germany&#x27;s nuclear reactors.

In a speech, Wulff also expressed his opposition to euthanasia and warned of a retreat of moral values. This was seen as the first attempt to formulate a value-based agenda for the 2008 state, as well as more importantly, the 2009 federal election. In this context, it is important to note that Chancellor Merkel had been severely criticised for a lack of emotional warmth during the 2005 federal election campaign, leading to a worse-than-expected result for the Christian Democrats.

Wulff announced on 8 January 2006 that Lower Saxony would become the first state to approve a new model according to which the government will temporarily pay part of the salaries for low-salary jobs, if the employers concerned are willing to employ an employee concerned on a long-term basis. This pilot was supposed to make new jobs more affordable in Germany&#x27;s notoriously high-wages environment.

===Wulff and the 2005 federal elections===
Due to his popularity in Lower Saxony, and in federal opinion polls, Wulff was considered to be a contender for the office of Chancellor.

After the 23 May announcement that federal elections were to be advanced to September 2005, Wulff announced that he was not a candidate for the Christian Democrat nomination for Chancellor, particularly as he had not completed his first term as Minister President of Lower Saxony. Instead, Wulff declared his support for CDU party and parliamentary leader Angela Merkel. Although there was speculation that Wulff would be given a position in the new government, entering federal politics, he remained Minister President of Lower Saxony.

===President of Germany===


Wulff was elected President of Germany on 2010 to follow Horst Köhler, who had resigned on 31 May 2010. He won 625 of 1,242 votes on the third ballot of the Federal Convention. He became Germany&#x27;s youngest president at the age of 51 and was sworn in on 2 July 2010 in front of the Bundestag and the Bundesrat.

His main contender in the election was Joachim Gauck, a civil rights activist from East Germany and former Federal Commissioner for the Stasi Records. Not a member of any party himself, Gauck was nominated by the opposition SPD and Greens as their presidential candidate on .

Wulff was succeeded as Minister President of Lower Saxony by David McAllister. Wulff&#x27;s candidacy for President of Germany in the 2010 presidential election was formally confirmed by Angela Merkel, Guido Westerwelle and Horst Seehofer, the heads of the governing CDU, FDP and CSU parties, during the evening of 2010.

In August 2011, President Wulff opened an economists&#x27; conference with a speech on the euro. He criticised the European Central Bank (ECB), which had entered a second round of bond buy-ups from heavily indebted euro-zone nations, calling the plan to stabilise the euro &quot;legally and politically questionable&quot;.

===Scandals, resignation and final acquittal===

In December 2011, German media reported allegations that Wulff had deceived the Parliament of Lower Saxony in February 2010, during an inquiry into his connections as Minister President of Lower Saxony with a number of affluent businessmen. In particular, there were a number of questions concerning the purchase of a house, for which Wulff accepted a loan from an entrepreneur family with whom he was friends. In this context, Wulff tried to influence the media coverage in the run-up to the breaking of the scandal. Additional investigations were launched into Wulff&#x27;s political dealing with various entrepreneurs with whom he and his family spent their private vacations. Since it was not clear who had paid for these holidays, Wulff was subsequently accused of favoritism and unethical behavior. After the district attorney&#x27;s office in Hanover had requested the lifting of his immunity on 16 February 2012, Wulff then resigned as German President the following day. On 27 February 2014, two years after his resignation, Wulff was acquitted of all corruption charges by the Hanover regional court.

== Life after politics ==
After leaving public office, Wulff represented Germany at several public events, including the state funerals of Abdullah ibn Abd al-Aziz of Saudi Arabia (2015) and of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan (2022) as well as the inauguration of President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine (2019) and inauguration of President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan of Turkey (2023).

In 2016 Wulff was awarded the Mercator Visiting Professorship for Political Management at the Universität Essen-Duisburg&#x27;s NRW School of Governance. He gave both seminars and lectures at the university. In August 2017, it was revealed that Wulff also works as an advisor for the German branch of Yargici, a Turkish high-street fashion company.

==Personal life==
Christian Wulff met his first wife, lawyer Christiane Vogt (born 1961), when they were both law students in Osnabrück in 1983. They married in March 1988, and have a daughter, Annalena (born 1993). In June 2006, Wulff announced their divorce. Wulff subsequently married Bettina Körner (born 1973 in Hannover), on 2008 at a ceremony in Castle Herrenhausen, near Hannover. She has a son Leander Balthasar (2003) from a previous relationship. On 2008, gave birth to their first child together, a boy named Linus. Wulff and second wife Bettina announced their separation in January 2013, and he moved out of their Hannover home. They started divorce proceedings in March 2015, but reconciled a mere two months thereafter. They separated a second time in 2018.

== History ==
The Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India (ICICI) was a government institution established on 5 January 1955 and Sir Arcot Ramasamy Mudaliar was elected as the first Chairman of ICICI Ltd. It was structured as a joint-venture of the World Bank, India&#x27;s public-sector banks and public-sector insurance companies to provide project financing to Indian industry. ICICI Bank was established by ICICI, as a wholly owned subsidiary in 1994 in Vadodara. The bank was founded as the Industrial Credit and Investment Corporation of India Bank, before it changed its name to ICICI Bank. In October 2001, the Boards of Directors of ICICI and ICICI Bank approved the merger of ICICI and two of its wholly-owned retail finance subsidiaries, ICICI Personal Financial Services Limited and ICICI Capital Services Limited, with ICICI Bank. The merger of parent ICICI Ltd. into its subsidiary ICICI Bank led to privatization.

In the 1990s, ICICI transformed its business from a development financial institution offering only project finance to a diversified financial services group, offering a wide variety of products and services, both directly and through a number of subsidiaries and affiliates like ICICI Bank. ICICI Bank launched Internet Banking operations in 1998.

ICICI&#x27;s shareholding in ICICI Bank was reduced to 46% through a public offering of shares in India in 1998, followed by an equity offering in the form of American depositary receipts on the NYSE in 2000. ICICI Bank acquired the Bank of Madura Limited in an all-stock deal in 2001 and sold additional stakes to institutional investors during 2001–02. In 1999, ICICI become the first Indian company and the first bank or a financial institution from non-Japan Asia to be listed on the NYSE.

ICICI, ICICI Bank, and ICICI subsidiaries ICICI Personal Financial Services Limited and ICICI Capital Services Limited merged in a reverse merger in 2002. During the financial crisis of 2007–2008, customers rushed to ICICI ATMs and branches in some locations due to rumors of bank failure. The Reserve Bank of India issued a clarification on the financial strength of ICICI Bank to dispel the rumours.

In 2015, ICICI unveiled an outward remittance platform called ‘Money2World’. The first of its kind, it enabled fully online outward remittance transactions for non-ICICI and ICICI customers alike.
In March 2020, the board of ICICI Bank Ltd. approved an investment of in Yes Bank, resulting in a 5% ownership interest in Yes.

==Controversies==

===Inhumane debt recovery methods===

A few years after its rise to prominence in the banking sector, ICICI Bank faced allegations on the recovery methods it used against loan payment defaulters. A number of cases were filed against the bank and its employees for using &quot;brutal measures&quot; to recover the money. Most of the allegations were that the bank was using goons to recover the credit card payments and that these &quot;recovery agents&quot; exhibited inappropriately and in some cases, inhuman behaviour. Incidents were reported wherein the defaulters were put to &quot;public shame&quot; by the recovery agents

The bank also faced allegations of inappropriate behaviour in recovering its loans. These allegations started initially when the &quot;recovery agents&quot; and bank employees started threatening the defaulters. In some cases, notes were written by the bank&#x27;s employees asking the defaulters to &quot;sell everything in the house, including family members&quot;, were found. Such charges faced by the bank rose to a peak when suicide cases were reported, wherein the suicide notes spoke of the bank&#x27;s recovery methods as the cause of the suicide. This led to legal battles and the bank paying huge compensation.

===Money laundering allegations===
ICICI Bank was one of the leading Indian banks accused of blatant money laundering through violation of RBI guidelines in the famous CobraPost sting operation which shook up Indian banking industry during April–May 2013.

On 14 March 2013 the online magazine Cobrapost released video footage from Operation Red Spider showing high-ranking officials and some employees of ICICI Bank agreeing to convert black money into white, an act in violation of Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002. The Government of India and Reserve Bank of India ordered an inquiry following the exposé. On 15 March 2013, ICICI Bank suspended 18 employees, pending inquiry. On 11 April 2013 the Deputy Governor of RBI, Harun Rashid Khan reportedly said that the central bank was initiating action against ICICI Bank in connection with allegations of money laundering.

=== Chanda Kochhar fraud case ===
On 4 October 2018, the then MD &amp; CEO Chanda Kochhar stepped down from her position following allegations of corruption. In January 2019, based on the report of an enquiry panel headed by Justice Srikrishna, the bank board officially terminated her from service. It also become one of the first in the country to ask for a claw back of bonuses and benefits. In 2020 the Enforcement Directorate provisionally seized assets and shares belonging to Chanda Kochhar with an estimated value of more than , in relation to the ICICI bank loan case.

<text>The Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge is a National Wildlife Refuge in Saginaw County managed by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. It is located in the central portion of the lower peninsula of the U.S. state of Michigan, approximately 25 miles (40 km) south of the Saginaw Bay in Lake Huron and five miles (8 km) south of the city of Saginaw in the county&#x27;s Spaulding and James townships. It was established in 1953 to provide habitat for migratory waterfowl.

Known locally as the Shiawassee Flats, the refuge lies in the Saginaw Bay watershed, historically one of the largest and most productive wetland ecosystems in Michigan. The Bad, Flint, and Cass Rivers flow into the Shiawassee River in the refuge. Here also the Shiawassee converges with the Tittabawassee River to form the Saginaw River.

==Wildlife and Habitat==
Refuge habitats include riparian, floodplain/bottomland hardwood forests, and emergent marshes, as well as shallow managed wetlands and croplands.

Over 265 species of birds have been documented on the refuge, including raptors, shore and wading birds, and more than 100 songbird species. Shiawassee Refuge is designated as an Important Bird Area for its global significance to migratory waterfowl. It is also one of six focus areas designated by the Great Lakes/St. Lawrence Basin Joint Venture of the North American Waterfowl Management Plan.

During peak populations in late October, up to 25,000 Canada geese and 40,000 ducks are present. A great diversity of other wildlife associated with freshwater marshes and floodplain forests are also found here.

==History==
In postglacial times, Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay extended much farther inland than they do now. When the water receded, it left behind a flat, sandy wetland surrounded by low hills. It served as the drainage zone for an area of lower Michigan that covers approximately ten counties. The region was a treasure-house of the wetland timber industry in the late 19th century. After the old-growth trees had almost all been removed, starting in 1903 farmers tried to ditch and tile-drain the land for arable crops. The &quot;Ferguson Bayou&quot; region of this drained land did not prove to be well-suited for this purpose, although the wildlife refuge continues to use, maintain, and rebuild many of the ditches, drains, and dikes dug during this period. The Shiawassee National Wildlife Refuge was established in 1953.

The area was an attractive hunting and gathering area for many early cultures and later Native American tribes, like the Odawa and Ojibwa. Ducks and geese flocked to this vast area of wetlands and rivers. Mammalian species including river otter, fisher, marten, elk, moose, and black bear were also found here.

The Flats received little human impact until the late 19th century, when the lumber industry expanded to this area. Coal was mined in the area from the early 20th century to the late 1930s. In 1903, farmers began converting the land for crops and, by 1950, a system of pumps, drainage tile, ditches and dikes were in place, making this an extensive agricultural area.

==Canada geese==
Shiawassee NWR has been designated as a &quot;U.S. Important Bird Area&quot; by the American Birding Association because of the genuinely migratory James Bay flocks of Canada geese that utilize the wetland annually. These James Bay geese should be sharply distinguished from the stay-at-home geese that have learned how not to migrate.

==Refuge management==

Shiawassee Refuge is also responsible for managing a portion of the Michigan Islands National Wildlife Refuge within Lake Huron and Saginaw Bay, including Thunder Bay, Scarecrow, and the Charity Islands. The Detroit River International Wildlife Refuge is also under its management, until a permanent staff is hired. The refuge also administers the Shiawassee Management District which coordinates wetland restorations in 22 counties and oversees conservation easements in 44 counties of lower Michigan.

The refuge is authorized to expand its present boundaries by 7,500 acres (30 km2) along the Tittabawassee, Shiawassee, and Cass rivers from willing sellers.

<text>Muhammad III as-Sadiq (; 7 February 1813 – 27 October 1882) commonly known as Sadok Bey (), was the Husainid Bey of Tunis from 1859 until his death. Invested as Bey al-Mahalla (Heir Apparent) on 10 June 1855, he succeeded his brother Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn on 23 September 1859. Named as divisional General in the Imperial Ottoman Army on 10 June 1855, he was promoted to the rank of Marshal on 10 December 1859.

== Reign ==
In July 1860, the Bey was persuaded by the British consul, Richard Wood, to allow a British subject named Holt to set up the first official printing press, as well as the first Arabic-language newspaper in the country, the &quot;ar-Ra&#x27;id at-Tūnisi&quot;. A telegraph concession was established, with a French interest taking it up in 1859.

On 23 April 1861 he promulgated the first written constitution in the Arab world, separating executive, legislative and judiciary powers, through a new Supreme Council, legislature and court system, thus limiting the powers of the Bey. This constitution guaranteed equality of rights to Muslims, Christians (effectively, therefore, to Europeans) and to Jews; in particular, concerning the right to own property. This created a new legal environment which encouraged Europeans to set up businesses in Tunisia; thus new French traders appeared, along with non-Muslim religious schools.
On 26 April 1861, the Bey changed the order of succession to the throne; henceforth it would be the oldest prince in the beylical family who would inherit, rather than the oldest son of the late sovereign.

Since the time of Hammouda Pasha two hundred years before, French interests in Tunisia had been housed in the Fondouk of French, a caravanserai in the medina. Now the Tunisian government had a new French consulate built, on what was to become the Avenue de la Marine (now Avenue Habib Bourguiba), and it was formally opened by the Bey on 12 January 1862.

The Bey commissioned the Marseille engineer Colin to repair the Zaghouan aqueduct providing a fresh water supply to the capital. In 1865 he began demolishing the walls around the medina, some of which were so unsound they threatened to collapse. It is during this period that Tunis lost a number of its historic gates - Bab Cartagena, Bab Souika, Bab Bnet and Bab El Jazira. The bronze cannon on the city walls and the fortifications of La Goulette were sold off in 1872. Europeans began to settle near the former Bab el Bhar, in streets close to the old walls and along the Avenue de la Marine, now planted with fig trees. Room for building was limited in nearby areas by European cemeteries, particularly opposite the new consulate building, and by market gardens along the Lake of Tunis which extended as far towards the city as the present Avenue de Carthage.

However, intrigues among his ministers, notably Mustapha Khaznadar and Mustapha Ben Ismaïl, constant pressure from European consuls and the looming bankruptcy of the state, provoked the Mejba Revolt of 1864, compelled him to secure debts which he could not repay, and opened the door to foreign occupation despite the efforts of his Grand Vizier Kheireddine Pacha.

France gained an important foothold in Tunisia in 1869 by means of a tripartite Debt Commission, constituted with the United Kingdom and Italy to manage the country&#x27;s financial commitments to its creditors. In April 1881, a border incident with French Algeria involving raids by Khroumire tribesmen who were subjects of the Bey provided the final pretext for the dispatch of a French expeditionary force which took El Kef, and for the landing of French troops at Bizerte on 1 May. The French army occupied Tunis on 11 May. The Bey was therefore compelled to sign the Treaty of Bardo on 12 May, establishing the French protectorate of Tunisia.

== Private life==
Muhammad as-Sadiq had several wives. The first was his cousin, the daughter of the Qaid Ahmed al-Munastiri, from a Turkish family which had been influential in the harem of the Beys of Tunis throughout the century; her mother and grandmother were respectively the second wives of Hussein II Bey et Mahmud ibn Muhammad. His second wife was Henani, daughter of Ali Laroussi, a rich merchant dealing in traditional Tunisian Chechia headgear. He also married a Circassian odalisque Lella Kmar, who was a gift from the Ottoman sultan.

His main residence was the Ksar Said palace, built in an Italianate style in front of the Bardo palace. It had been confiscated from the former minister and Keeper of the Seals, Ismail as-Sunni, who was accused of treason and executed in 1867. (This minister was the maternal grandfather of the future Moncef Bey). It was to one of the first floor staterooms of this palace that, on 12 May 1881, the French consul Théodore Roustan brought the French General Jules Aimé
Bréart to the Bey&#x27;s privy council to secure his signature on the Treaty of Bardo.
In his later years, the Bey fell under the influence Mustapha Ben Ismaïl, and died without issue. He was buried in the Tourbet el Bey mausoleum in the medina of Tunis. He was succeeded by his brother Ali III ibn al-Husayn.
=== Homosexuality of the bey ===
According to the writer Nizar Ben Saad, The Bey had many sexual affairs with several male ministers from his court, the most famous with his Grand Vizir Mustapha Ben Ismaïl. The intimate meetings of the bey were always held in Dar El Bey at night to avoid being seen. Not only that, his marriage to Lella Kmar was never consummated, which made it easier for her to marry his brother Ali Bey after his death.

=== Descendants ===
The bey died without leaving any children to inherit the throne. Yet, he was the adoptive father of his nephew Mohamed Naceur, and Jnaina the spouse of his Vizie Ismail Ben Mustapha.

<text>In the United Kingdom, a deserted medieval village (DMV) is a former settlement which was abandoned during the Middle Ages, typically leaving no trace apart from earthworks or cropmarks. If there are fewer than three inhabited houses the convention is to regard the site as deserted; if there are more than three houses, it is regarded as a shrunken medieval village. There are estimated to be more than 3,000 DMVs in England alone.

== Other deserted settlements ==
Not all sites are medieval: villages reduced in size or disappeared over a long period, from as early as Anglo-Saxon times to as late as the 1960s, due to numerous different causes.

== Reasons for desertion ==
Over the centuries, settlements have been deserted as a result of natural events, such as rivers changing course or silting up, flooding (especially during the wet 13th and 14th centuries) as well as coastal and estuarine erosion or being overwhelmed by windblown sand.

Many were thought to have been abandoned due to the deaths of their inhabitants from the Black Death in the mid-14th century. While the plague must often have greatly hastened the population decline, which had already set in by the early 14th century in England because of soil exhaustion and disease, most DMVs actually seem to have become deserted during the 15th century. At this time, and other policies allowed land traditionally cultivated for cereals and vegetables to be transformed into pastures for sheep. The medieval ridge and furrow cultivation pattern remains evident in fields, even until today. This change of land use by landowners, which was to take advantage of the profitable wool trade, led to hundreds of villages being deserted.

Later, the aristocratic fashion for grand country mansions, parks and landscaped gardens led to whole villages being moved or destroyed to enable lords of the manor to participate in this trend: a process often called emparkment or enclosure.

== Examples ==
Perhaps the best-known deserted medieval village in England is at Wharram Percy in North Yorkshire, because of the extensive archaeological excavations conducted there between its discovery in 1948 and 1990. Its ruined church and its former fishpond are still visible.

In Northamptonshire, around 100 villages can be classified as deserted: there are articles relating to many of them, such as Onley, Althorp, Canons Ashby, Church Charwelton and Coton along with Faxton, Glendon, Snorscombe, Wolfhampcote and Wythmail.

Other examples are at Gainsthorpe and Burreth in Lincolnshire.

<text>Jean-Pierre Basilic Dantor Franck Étienne d&#x27;Argent (; 12 April 1936 – 20 February 2025), known by his pen name Frankétienne, was a Haitian writer, poet, playwright, and painter. He is recognized as one of Haiti&#x27;s leading writers and playwrights in both French and Haitian Creole, and is &quot;known as the father of Haitian letters&quot;. He was a candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2009, made a Commander of the &quot;Ordre des Arts et Lettres&quot; (Order of the Arts and Letters), and was named UNESCO Artist for Peace in 2010.

==Life and career==
Jean-Pierre Basilic Dantor Franck Étienne d&#x27;Argent was born in Ravine-Sèche, a small village in Haiti. His mother, Annette Étienne, a black Haitian, was 16 when she gave birth to him, and his father, Benjamin Lyles, a wealthy white American, was 63. His father then abandoned the family. Frankétienne later said that he was given his first names by his mother and grandmother to protect him from sorcery. He was raised by his mother in the Bel Air neighborhood of Port-au-Prince, where she was a respected entrepreneur, owning her own business to support her eight children, managing to send him, her eldest, to school. He grew up to work as a teacher in Bel Air. At the age of 5, he was enrolled in Petit Séminaire Collège Saint-Martial, where he learned French. Although he excelled in mathematics and physics, he failed the entrance exam for medicine, so he enrolled in an American mechanical school.

=== Writing ===
He attended the Institute of Higher International Studies in France, where he was taught by Pradel Pompilus and Ghislain Gouraige. There, he first began writing poetry around 1960. He published his first texts – &quot;Au fils du temps&quot;, &quot;La marche&quot;, &quot;Mon côté gauche&quot;, and &quot;Vigie et verre&quot; in 1964 and 1965. His first novel, &quot;Mûr à crever&quot;, was published in 1968. He was known as one of the main figures of the Haitian literary movement , alongside Jean-Claude Fignolé and René Philoctète.

In 1975, he published &quot;Dézafi&quot; (widely considered to be the first modern novel written entirely in Haitian Creole), and from 1977 onwards he worked in theater, producing the works &quot;Trofouban&quot; (1977), &quot;Pèlin-tèt&quot; (1978), &quot;Bobomasouri&quot; (1984), &quot;Kaselezo&quot; (1985), and &quot;Totolomannwe&quot; (1986).

=== Painting ===
He began to paint in 1973 and the first exhibition of his paintings took place in Port-au-Prince in 1974. As of 2004, he had made about a thousand paintings. His style was &quot;expressive&quot; and &quot;abstract,&quot; often favoring red and blue, the colors of the Haitian flag.

== Awards and recognition ==
* In 1988, he served for four months as Minister of Culture of Haiti.
* Candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature (2009)
* Commander of the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres (2010)
* UNESCO Artist for Peace (2010), in recognition for his efforts to preserve Haitian culture and language.
* Grand prix de la francophonie (2021)

== Death and legacy ==
Frankétienne died in Delmas on 20 February 2025, at the age of 88. The circumstances of his death were not announced. Haitian Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aimé said of him &quot;Through his writings, he illuminated the world, carried the soul of Haiti and defied silence. May his word remain, may his spirit still blow. Farewell, master.&quot; He was survived by his wife, Marie-Andrée Étienne, his son Rudolphe, and his daughter Stéphane.

<text>Muhammad IV al-Hadi (), commonly referred to as Hédi Bey ( ; 24 June 1855 in Le Bardo – 11 May 1906 in Carthage) was the son of Ali III ibn al-Husayn and the fourteenth Husainid Bey of Tunis, ruling from 1902 until his death.

He was named Bey al-Mahalla (Heir Apparent) on 3 December 1898 and succeeded as Bey of Tunis on the day of his predecessor&#x27;s death, 11 June 1902, at a ceremony in the throne room of the palace in Tunis, in the presence of the French resident. Before the French protectorate of Tunisia the Ottoman sultan had bestowed honorific military ranks on the Bey of Tunis and his Heir Apparent. Hédi Bey did not receive such an honour, but was instead made Divisional General of the Beylical Guard when he became Heir Apparent, and became Marshal on his accession. 
Following a dispute in 1904 with the French Resident General Stephen Pichon over the dismissal of his Grand Vizier Mohammed Aziz Bouattour, he suffered a stroke which caused paralysis of his lower limbs. Shortly before his death, the first violent resistance to authority since the start of the protectorate took place in the Thala-Kasserine Disturbances.
He died in his palace at Carthage Dermech and was buried in the Tourbet el Bey mausoleum in the medina of Tunis. He was succeeded by his cousin Muhammad V an-Nasir.

<doc id="852138" wikidata="Q5254068" url="?curid=852138" title="Delivering Security in a Changing World">
<text>The 2003 Defence White Paper, titled Delivering Security in a Changing World, set out the future structure of the British military, and was preceded by the 1998 Strategic Defence Review (SDR) and the 2002 SDR New Chapter, which responded to the immediate challenges to security in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks in 2001. Published under the then Secretary of State for Defence, Geoff Hoon, the report effectively introduced a series of cutbacks to core equipment and manpower and the scaling back of a series of future capital procurement projects. This was justified due to the implementation of a policy termed Network Enabled Capability. The review also outlined a major restructuring and consolidation of British Army Infantry regiments.

==Key points==
The White Paper, scaling back to an extent from the previous Strategic Defence Review, outlined the following posture for the UK armed forces:
* The ability to support three simultaneous small (e.g. Operation Palliser in Sierra Leone) to medium scale (e.g. Operation Veritas in Afghanistan) operations, where at least one is an enduring peace-keeping mission (e.g. Kosovo). These forces must be capable of acting as lead nation in any coalition operations.
* The ability, at longer notice, to deploy forces in a large scale operation (e.g. Operation Telic in Iraq or Operation Herrick in Afghanistan) while running a concurrent small scale operation.

Most of the reforms listed below were announced as part of the &quot;Delivering Security in a Changing World: Future Capabilities&quot; review, published on 21 July 2004.

British Army
*Manpower reduced by 1,000.
*Restructuring will cut 4 infantry battalions otherwise tasked to Northern Ireland, and the manpower redistributed elsewhere.
*Army High Velocity Missile fire units to be halved, which would lead to the re-role of 2 TA Royal Artillery regiments; 100th (Yeomanry) Regiment Royal Artillery, re-equipped with L118 light guns and 104th Regiment Royal Artillery, re-equipped with L118 light guns. In addition, 22nd Regiment Royal Artillery was disbanded.
*The re-role of a Challenger 2 regiment into an armoured reconnaissance regiment, Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers, and several AS-90 batteries to a light gun regiment, 40th Regiment Royal Artillery, into what would become 19 Light Brigade (see Future Army Structure).
*Withdrawal of 7 Challenger 2 squadrons and 6 AS-90 self-propelled gun batteries (approx. 84 tanks and 48 AS90s). -&gt; 4 of these from the Queen&#x27;s Royal Lancers, three others from Royal Wessex Yeomanry (4 tank replacement squadrons dissolved to just 1 replacement squadron; A (Dorset Yeomanry) Armour Replacement Squadron)
*Infantry battalions to be incorporated into new, large, multi-battalion regiments.
*Creation of 3 light armoured squadrons that will support development of the next generation of armoured vehicles, the Future Rapid Effect System (FRES).

<text>Muhammad V an-Nasir (), commonly known as Naceur Bey ( ; 14 July 1855 in La Marsa – 8 July 1922 in La Marsa) was the son of Muhammad II ibn al-Husayn and the fifteenth Husainid Bey of Tunis, ruling from 1906 until his death. He was named Divisional General of the Beylical army when he became Bey al-Mahalla (Heir Apparent) on 11 June 1902, and assumed the rank of Marshal when he succeeded Muhammad IV al-Hadi on 11 May 1906.

The reign of Naceur Bey saw increasing tension between the authorities of the French Protectorate and the Tunisian population. Shortly before he succeeded as Bey, the Thala-Kasserine Disturbances broke out and a few years later the discontent escalated to include major incidents such as the Jellaz Affair and the Tunis Tram Boycott. The French managed to secure from him a decree expelling the leaders of the Tunisian national movement, Ali Bach Hamba, Hassan Guelati, Mohamed Nomane and Abdelaziz Thâalbi from the country in March 1912.

Increasingly dissatisfied with the way the authorities were treating the Destour, in April 1922 he threatened to abdicate if France did not meet their demands, including the repeal of French laws on naturalisation. In response, the French Resident General Lucien Saint surrounded the Bey&#x27;s palace with troops in order to put pressure on him not to do so. With his hand forced, he complied with the wishes of the French. Humiliated by this experience, he died on 8 July.

He was buried in the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey in the medina of Tunis. He was succeeded by his cousin Muhammad VI al-Habib and his oldest son, Moncef Bey became Bey in 1942.

<doc id="852150" wikidata="Q69045" url="?curid=852150" title="Ernst Albrecht (politician, born 1930)">
<text>Ernst Carl Julius Albrecht (29 June 1930 – 13 December 2014) was a German politician of the Christian Democratic Union and a former high-ranking European civil servant. He was one of the first European civil servants appointed in 1958 and served as Director-General of the Directorate-General for Competition from 1967 to 1970. He served as Minister President of the state of Lower Saxony from 1976 to 1990. He was the father of the politician Ursula von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission.

==Background==
Ernst Albrecht was born in Heidelberg, the son of the psychologist, psychotherapist and medical doctor Carl Albrecht, who was known for developing a new method of meditation; the Albrecht family had been among the &quot;hübsche&quot; (&quot;genteel&quot;) families of the Electorate of Hanover as doctors, jurists and civil servants since the 17th century, but his immediate ancestors had been wealthy cotton merchants in Bremen and members of the city-state&#x27;s Hanseatic elite in the 19th and 20th centuries. His grandmother Mary Ladson Robertson was an American of prominent planter class origin from Charleston, South Carolina, and a descendant of James H. Ladson and several colonial governors.

==European Commission, 1958–1970==
Ernst Albrecht studied law and economics. In 1958 he moved to Brussels where he became one of the first European civil servants. He initially served as the Chef de Cabinet to the European Commissioner for Competition Hans von der Groeben in the Hallstein Commission, and in 1967, at the age of 37, he became the Director-General of the Directorate-General for Competition.

==Business and political career==
Albrecht entered politics in his native Germany when he was elected to the Lower Saxon Landtag (parliament) in 1970, and moved to Hanover with his family the following year. From 1971 to 1976, he was member of the management board of Bahlsen.

When Alfred Kubel resigned from the office of State Premier in 1976, Albrecht was unexpectedly elected as his successor. Since he received three more votes than his party had representatives in the Legislative Assembly, some members of the governing coalition SPD and FDP must have secretly voted for him. He was re-elected in state parliament elections in 1978, 1982 and 1986.In 1976, Albrecht made Hans Puvogel his minister of justice. During his tenure, Puvogel was particularly active in combatting notions of more liberal penal and rehabilitation systems. He had already set out justification for his stance in a 1935-1936 doctoral thesis. There, he wrote of the “inheritance of criminal tendencies”, of “constitutionally predisposed criminals” and “inferior people”, who would have to be “eliminated from the community”. “Only a person of value to the race” would have “a right to exist within the national community”.

The state government under Ernst Albrecht used every opportunity to court former Nazis. In a 1978 speech, Deputy Premier Wilfried Hasselmann (CDU) greeted the Association of Knight&#x27;s Cross Recipients, a league of former Wehrmacht (Hitler&#x27;s army) officers and SS men, certifying that they had “shown courage and given an example to others”. Hasselmann declared he was “deeply impressed by the solidarity of your order. You have fulfilled your duty as soldiers in an exemplary manner. This will continue to be evident to a younger generation”.

Albrecht is known for the decision to make the County of Lüchow-Dannenberg the state&#x27;s &quot;nuclear district&quot;; only a radioactive waste dump at Gorleben was realized, however. During his tenure Albrecht was embroiled in an unusually large number of political scandals; most famously, the Celle Hole. In 1980, Albrecht launched a campaign for election as Chancellor, but he lost out to fellow conservative Franz-Josef Strauß. Albrecht did not contest the 1990 state elections. Instead, then-President of the Bundestag and Göttingen Member of the German Bundestag Rita Süssmuth was lead candidate. They had an agreement whereby, if re-elected, Albrecht would continue as Minister-President until 1992, then Süssmuth would take over. Süssmuth lost the 1990 state elections to Gerhard Schröder, who later became Chancellor.

==Personal life==

Albrecht married Heidi Adele Stromeyer (1928–2002) in 1953. They had seven children, among them politician Ursula von der Leyen and Hans-Holger Albrecht, President &amp; CEO of the international telecom and media group Deezer. A daughter died at age 11 and one son at age 49 of cancer.

His brother was George Alexander Albrecht, a conductor. Ernst Albrecht had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease since 2003, which was announced to the public in 2008. He died at the age of 84 in Burgdorf in December 2014.

<doc id="852155" wikidata="Q2722555" url="?curid=852155" title="Muhammad VI al-Habib">
<text>Muhammad VI al-Habib (), commonly known as Habib Bey ( ; 13 August 1858 in Le Bardo – 13 February 1929 in Carthage) was the sixteenth Husainid Bey of Tunis, reigning from 10 July 1922 until 11 February 1929.

His father was Mohamed el-Mamoune Bey, the younger child of Hassine II Bey who had died young in 1861 without ruling when Habib was only three years old, and his mother was a Circassian odalisque named Fatma. His uncle Muhammad III as-Sadiq took charge of his education and married him to the niece of his Grand Vizier Mustapha Ben Ismaïl, his favourite courtier and mainstay of authority in the Regency of Tunis. Made Bey al-Mahalla (Heir Apparent) on 12 May 1906, he succeeded his cousin Muhammad V an-Nasir on 8 July 1922. He was made a Divisional General in the beylical army on the same day he became Bey al Mahalla and was promoted to Marshal when he succeeded to the throne.

Throughout his reign he did not seek to hinder the authorities of the French protectorate, in contrast to the approach of his predecessor. He came to the throne deeply in debt and without any support owing to his coming from a branch of the family that was not close to power. He therefore remained reliant on the good graces of the French Resident General, Lucien Saint.

Nevertheless, the aftermath of the First World War saw a change in relations between France and its colonies. About 80,000 Tunisians, mostly conscripted, had served in the French army, and about 20,000 had been killed or wounded. The Ottoman Empire, which until its dissolution had been the nominal suzerain of the Beys of Tunis, no longer existed. Ideas of self-determination were growing, and the Tunisian national movement regrouped in 1922 with the foundation of the Destour party. The French authorities took a number of political initiatives, establishing consultative councils including the Grand Council and regional (caïdat) councils and introducing new laws allowing some Tunisians to acquire French nationality. These initiatives galvanised the Destourians, prompting Habib Bey to advise Abdelaziz Thâalbi to leave the country if he continued to oppose them.

Habib Bey took part in the inauguration of the Grand Mosque of Paris in July 1926 along with Mouley Youssef of Morocco. He was also the first Tunisian ruler to have his name included in Friday prayers, replacing the Ottoman caliph.

Lucien Saint invited him and his sons Azzedine Bey and Lamine Bey to make a private visit to Marignac in July 1923 and again the following year.

He bought the Zarrouk palace in Carthage where he lived, by the sea, until his death. He was buried in the Tourbet el Bey in the medina of Tunis. He was succeeded by Ahmed Bey.

<text>Apart from France, established Jewish populations exist in the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy and Switzerland. With the original medieval populations wiped out by the Black Death and the pogroms that followed it, the current Dutch and Belgian communities originate in the Jewish expulsion from Spain and Portugal, while a Swiss community was only established after emancipation in 1874. However, the vast majority of the population in the Netherlands and a large proportion of the one in Belgium were murdered in the Holocaust, and much of the modern Jewish population of these countries (as well as of Switzerland) derives from post-Holocaust arrivals from other parts of Europe. Here is a list of some prominent Jews in western Europe, arranged by country of origin.

<text>Coeluridae is a historically unnatural group of generally small, carnivorous dinosaurs from the late Jurassic Period. For many years, any small Jurassic or Cretaceous theropod that did not belong to one of the more specialized families recognized at the time was classified with the coelurids, creating a confusing array of &#x27;coelurid&#x27; theropods that were not closely related. Although they have been traditionally included in this family, there is no evidence that any of these primitive coelurosaurs form a natural group with &quot;Coelurus&quot;, the namesake of Coeluridae, to the exclusion of other traditional coelurosaur groups.

Before the use of phylogenetic analyses, Coeluridae and Coelurosauria were taxonomic wastebaskets used for small theropods that did not belong to other groups; thus, they accumulated many dubious genera. As late as the 1980s, popular books recognized over a dozen &quot;coelurids&quot;, including such disparate forms as the noasaurid &quot;Laevisuchus&quot; and the oviraptorosaurian &quot;Microvenator&quot;, and considered them descendants of the coelophysids. A wastebasket Coeluridae lingered into the early 1990s in some sources (and appears in at least one 2006 source) but since then it has only been recognized in a much reduced form.

In 2003, O.W.M. Rauhut, using a cladistic analysis, found Coeluridae to include &quot;Coelurus&quot; (Late Jurassic, North America), &quot;Compsognathus&quot; (Late Jurassic, Europe), &quot;Sinosauropteryx&quot; (Early Cretaceous, Asia) and an unnamed &quot;Compsognathus&quot;-like form (Early Cretaceous, South America; this dinosaur has since been placed in the new genus &quot;Mirischia&quot;). Rauhut considered coelurids to be a monophyletic group of basal coelurosaurs, characterized by evolutionary reversals in some aspects of the vertebrae to the more primitive theropod condition. However, he and other authors have not since found this result. Phil Senter proposed in 2007 that &quot;Coelurus&quot; and &quot;Tanycolagreus&quot; were the only coelurids, and were actually tyrannosauroids.

Coeluridae received a formal phylogenetic definition in 2015, when it was defined as all species more closely related to &quot;Coelurus fragilis&quot; than to &quot;Proceratosaurus bradleyi&quot;, &quot;Tyrannosaurus rex&quot;, &quot;Allosaurus fragilis&quot;, &quot;Compsognathus longipes&quot;, &quot;Ornithomimus edmontonicus&quot;, or &quot;Deinonychus antirrhopus&quot; by Hendrickx, Hartman and Mateus. It remains unclear whether or not this group contains any species other than &quot;Coelurus&quot; itself, and while &quot;Tanycolagreus&quot; is often included, support for this relationship has been weak in most of the studies that recovered it.

In 2024, Cau recovered Coeluridae as the basalmost family of maniraptoromorphs, including few of its traditional members; in addition to &quot;Coelurus&quot;, it contains &quot;Shishugounykus&quot; (traditionally a basal alvarezsaur), &quot;Phuwiangvenator&quot; and &quot;Vayuraptor&quot; (sometimes considered to be early megaraptorans), &quot;Fukuivenator&quot; (sometimes considered to be a basal therizinosaur), and &quot;Migmanychion&quot;. The results of his phylogenetic analysis are displayed in the cladogram below:

<text>Gerhard Glogowski (born 11 February 1943) is a German politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD).

==Education==
Born in Hanover, Glogowski finished public school in Bonn and later completed an apprenticeship as toolmaker. In parallel, he attended night school where he finished his Abitur. Then he studied at the University of Economics and Politics in Hamburg until the end as a graduate economist.

==Political career==
Glogowski grew up in Bonn, his father was a chauffeur of the SPD politician Herbert Wehner and Erich Ollenhauer.

Since 1960, Glogowski is member of the IG Metall.

Glogowski started his political career in 1972 as Mayor of the city district of Waggum in Brunswick. He changed in 1976 upon the chair as Lord Mayor of Brunswick until 1981 and again from 1986 until 1990.

In the meantime, Glogowski was elected as an MP of Lower Saxony in 1978. He maintained the position until 2004.

After the state election in 1990, he was interior minister of Lower Saxony from 21 June 1990 until 27 October 1998 in Gerhard Schröder&#x27;s cabinet.
He succeeded Schröder as Prime Minister of Lower Saxony from 28 October 1998 until 26 November 1999. Glogowski stepped back from this office after various financial irregularities had become public; among other issues, he was accused of accepting coffee and beer for a private party from local companies.

==Life after politics==
After seven and a half years as president of Eintracht Braunschweig, Glogowski was elected honorary president of the club in 2007.

On 18 December 2007, the Council of the City of Brunswick voted for Glogowski to be awarded the honorary citizenship of Brunswick. The appointment took place on 11 February 2008.

In 1998, Glogowski declared about the far-right political parties in Germany:

<doc id="852166" wikidata="Q496706" url="?curid=852166" title="Moncef Bey">
<text>Muhammad VII al-Munsif, (; 4 March 1881 in La Manouba – 1 September 1948 in Pau) commonly known as Moncef Bey () was the Bey of Tunis between 19 June 1942 and 14 May 1943. He was the penultimate ruler of the Husainid dynasty.

==Youth==
Muhammad VII al-Munsif was the son of Muhammad V an-Nasir. 

As a young man Moncef Bey distinguished himself during the events of April 1922 when he supported the nationalist Destour movement and prevailed on his father Naceur Bey to receive its representatives. He was invested as Bey al-Mahalla on 30 April 1942 and succeeded his first cousin once removed, Ahmed Bey, on the latter&#x27;s death on 19 June of the same year.

==Reign==

===Relations with the Vichy regime===

On 2 July 1942, Moncef Bey was awarded the Grand Cross of the Légion d&#x27;honneur by the Vichy regime. Nevertheless, his attitude on the throne was not one which France found easy to deal with. Thus, in a memorandum of 2 August 1942 to Marshall Pétain presented by his Grand Vizier Hédi Lakhoua he reaffirmed his belief in Tunisian sovereignty, undiminished by the French protectorate. He insisted on the establishment of a consultative legislative Council in which Tunisians would predominate; access to civil service roles for Tunisians, and measures against poverty and unemployment. He also wanted compulsory schooling in Arabic, the nationalisation of key enterprises, and a range of other measures of a broadly nationalist character.

On 12 October 1942 at the Eid al-Fitr ceremonies in the palace of La Marsa, Moncef Bey expressed his surprise that there was not a single Tunisian among the senior government personnel who were attending with the French Resident General, Admiral Jean-Pierre Esteva. Esteva replied &#x27;seuls les Français sont aptes aux postes de commande&#x27; (&#x27;only the French are suited to positions of authority&#x27;). The Bey then sent a telegram to Marshal Pétain asking for Esteva to be recalled. and tension continued to mount between the Bey and Esteva In December 1942, a confrontation blew up during a session of the Council of Ministers between Esteva and the Minister of Justice Abdeljelil Zaouche, after the Minister expressed reservations about funding for the National Gendarmerie and Esteva angrily rejected any criticism of the gendarmerie. Moncef Bey considered that the Resident General&#x27;s tone was an insult to his representative and thus to his own person.

Axis troops arrived in Tunisia on 16 November 1942 and the Tunisian Campaign turned much of the country into a battlefield. Moncef Bey was confronted by demands from Pétain to remain loyal to France and from Roosevelt to allow free passage for Allied troops. Moncef Bey proclaimed Tunisian neutrality while secretly informing Roosevelt that Tunisia would support the Allies. He also refused an offer from the Italian ambassador Bombieri to repudiate the Treaty of Bardo and enter into a new treaty with Italy.

On 1 January 1943 the Bey named as his new Prime Minister Mohamed Chenik, who was described as &#x27;half-American&#x27; by the German representative Rudolf Rahn. Chenik headed a government which included the Destourian Salah Farhat, the neo-destourian Mahmoud El Materi and an independent, Aziz Djellouli.

===Protector of the Jews===

His predecessor Ahmed Bey was often referred to as &#x27;the Bey of the French&#x27; and signed several decrees prepared by the Vichy regime which were detrimental to the Jewish community in Tunisia. Moncef Bey on the other hand was referred to as &#x27;the Protector of the Jews&#x27; and made efforts to ensure that these decrees were not put into effect. He also refused to sign any other anti-Jewish decrees, including those requiring Jews to wear the yellow star, or to undertake forced labour, or to exclude Jews from certain activities. Between November 1942 and May 1943, while Axis troops occupied the country, he intervened repeatedly to protect his people, particularly the Jewish community, from their exactions.

==Deposition and exile==

When Allied troops occupied Tunis, the French colonial lobby around Henri Giraud, including the former Resident General and Vichy minister Marcel Peyrouton, found a pretext to accuse the Bey of collaborating with Axis forces. After Esteva fled, General Alphonse Juin became acting Resident General. On 13 May 1943, on the orders of Giraud, Juin demanded the Bey&#x27;s abdication, but he refused. The following day he was removed by a decree from Giraud and flown out of the country by the French airforce. He was succeeded by his second cousin, Lamine Bey, on 15 May 1943.

Moncef Bey was sent to Laghouat in southern Algeria, where he formally abdicated on 8 July. He was then moved to the small town of Ténès, in the north of the country and on 17 October 1945 he was moved again to Pau where he remained until his death on 1 September 1948. His remains were brought back to Tunis and he was buried with full honours in the Jellaz Cemetery unlike other ruling members of his family, who were mostly buried in Tourbet el Bey.

He is commemorated today in the Place Moncef-Bey in La Marsa, formally named on 1 September 2012 by President Moncef Marzouki.

==Family and private life==

He married Lalla Traki Beya, daughter of Muhammad IV al-Hadi (and thus his second cousin) in October 1900 in Sidi Bou Saïd. She was the mother of his four children:

* Prince Salaheddine Bey (1902-1938) 
* Prince Mohammed Raouf Bey (1903-1977) 
* Prince Omar Bey (1904-1938) 
* Princess Lalla Farida (1911-?)

After Lalla Traki&#x27;s death in 1919 he married Lalla Zoubaida (née Azzouz) and then another cousin, Lalla Habiba (1888-1969), whom he divorced. His last wife was Lalla Arbiya in August 1942, and she followed him into exile, dying in 1974.

<text>Sigmar Hartmut Gabriel (born 12 September 1959) is a German politician who was the Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs from 2017 to 2018 and the vice-chancellor of Germany from 2013 to 2018. He was Leader of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) from 2009 to 2017, which made him the party&#x27;s longest-serving leader since Willy Brandt. He was the Federal Minister of the Environment from 2005 to 2009 and the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs and Energy from 2013 to 2017. From 1999 to 2003 Gabriel was Minister-President of Lower Saxony.

He represented Salzgitter – Wolfenbüttel in the Bundestag.

Gabriel is a member of the Seeheimer Kreis, an official internal grouping of the party with liberal economic positions.

==Early life and education==
Gabriel was born in Goslar, West Germany, son of Walter Gabriel (1921–2012), a municipal civil servant, and Antonie Gabriel (1922–2014), a nurse. Gabriel&#x27;s parents divorced in 1962, and for the next six years he lived with his father and grandmother Lina Gabriel, while his sister lived with their mother. After a lengthy custody battle his mother was awarded custody for both children in 1969.

Gabriel&#x27;s father was a Lutheran originally from Hirschberg im Riesengebirge in Silesia (now Poland), while his mother was a Catholic originally from Heilsberg in the Ermland (Warmia) region of East Prussia who had most recently lived in Königsberg; both parents came as refugees to West Germany during the flight and expulsion of Germans at the end of the Second World War. 
Sigmar Gabriel has described his family history as a &quot;wild story of flight and expulsion&quot; and noted that his parents dealt with the trauma of expulsion in different ways. According to Gabriel, his father was physically and emotionally abusive to him and was an enthusiastic supporter of the national socialist ideology &quot;until his dying breath;&quot; However, Walter Gabriel never saw active service during the war due to suffering from polio. His mother was involved in relief and solidarity work for Poland during the period of martial law in Poland.

Sigmar Gabriel attended school in Goslar, and served as a soldier in the German Air Force from 1979 to 1981. He studied politics, sociology and German at the University of Göttingen from 1982 and passed the first state examination as a grammar school teacher in 1987 and the second state examination in 1989.

==Political career==

Gabriel joined the SPD in 1977 and soon held a number of positions in local politics. In 1990, he was first elected to the State Parliament of Lower Saxony, where he led the SPD parliamentary group from 1998 until 1999.

===Minister-President of Lower Saxony, 1999–2003===
On 15 December 1999, after the resignation of Gerhard Glogowski, who had succeeded Gerhard Schröder in office, Gabriel became Minister-President of Lower Saxony. He had previously won an internal party vote against Wolfgang Jüttner and Thomas Oppermann. He served until 4 March 2003. During these years, he was widely presented as a protégé of Schröder, and even as a possible successor as chancellor.

After being voted out of office in 2003, Gabriel became the SPD&#x27;s &quot;Representative for Pop Culture and Pop Discourse&quot; from 2003 to 2005, for which he was bestowed the nickname &quot;Siggi Pop&quot;.

===Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety, 2005–2009===
He was elected in Salzgitter – Wolfenbüttel in the 2005 federal election.

From 2005 to 2009 Gabriel was the Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety in the first cabinet of Angela Merkel (CDU).

During his time in office, Gabriel promoted the International Renewable Energy Agency. He also led the German delegation to the 2006 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Nairobi. In 2007, when Germany held the presidency of the Council of the European Union, he led the negotiations between European Union environment ministers on an ambitious effort to cut greenhouse gas emissions to 20 percent below 1990 levels. That same year, he accompanied Merkel on a two-day visit to Greenland to see the Ilulissat Icefjord, a UNESCO world heritage site, and the Sermeq Kujalleq glacier in order to get a firsthand look at the effects of global warming.

===Opposition leader, 2009–2013===
Following the SPD&#x27;s defeat in the federal election of 2009, Franz Müntefering resigned from the position of party chairman of the Social Democratic Party. Gabriel was nominated as his successor and was elected on 13 November 2009. He was re-elected as party chairman for a further two years at the SPD party conference in Berlin on 5 December 2011, receiving 91.6 percent of the vote.

During his early years as chairman, Gabriel pushed through internal party reforms. He abolished the party steering committee in favor of an expanded executive committee and led the regular party conventions, the most important meetings for the party. He also played a critical role in founding the Progressive Alliance in 2013 by canceling the SPD payment of its £100,000 yearly membership fee to the Socialist International in January 2012. Gabriel had been critical of the Socialist International&#x27;s admittance and continuing inclusion of undemocratic &quot;despotic&quot; political movements into the organization.

For the 2013 federal election, Gabriel was considered a possible candidate to challenge incumbent Chancellor Angela Merkel but deemed too “unpopular and undisciplined” at the time. As a consequence, he and the other members of the party&#x27;s leadership agreed to nominate Peer Steinbrück after Frank-Walter Steinmeier, the party&#x27;s parliamentary leader, withdrew from the contest.

During the election campaign, Gabriel became the first SPD leader to address a party convention of Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens; in his speech, he called for a red–green alliance to defeat Merkel in the elections.

===Vice-Chancellor and Federal Minister, 2013–2018===

In 2013, Gabriel turned the Social Democrats’ third successive defeat to Angela Merkel in the federal election into a share of government, after successfully navigating the three-month process of coalition negotiations and a ballot of about 475,000 party members, who endorsed the accord. At the time, he was widely considered to have negotiated skillfully, particularly considering the relative weakness of his party, which had received just over 25 percent of the vote in the elections, against more than 41 percent for Merkel&#x27;s conservative bloc.

At an SPD convention shortly after the elections, however, Gabriel and the other members of the party&#x27;s leadership were punished by delegates who re-elected them to their posts with reduced majorities; he received 83.6 percent of members’ ballots after 91.6 percent at the previous vote in 2011.

Gabriel, who serves as vice-chancellor in the third Merkel cabinet, took on responsibility for Germany&#x27;s energy overhaul as part of a newly configured Economy Ministry. Since late 2016, he has been a member of the German government&#x27;s cabinet committee on Brexit at which ministers discuss organizational and structural issues related to the United Kingdom&#x27;s departure from the European Union.

As Minister of the Economy in 2014, Gabriel tried to choke the exports of the German defence industry.

Speculation about Gabriel&#x27;s future as leader of the SPD has been brewing since he registered just 74 percent in a party delegates&#x27; vote of confidence in December 2015 – the lowest for an SPD leader in 20 years. On 24 January 2017 Gabriel announced that we will not run as candidate for chancellor in 2017; instead, he proposed that Martin Schulz become candidate and replace him as party chairman.

Gabriel also announced that he would succeed Frank-Walter Steinmeier as Minister for Foreign Affairs. He took office on 27 January 2017, the previous Parliamentary State Secretary Brigitte Zypries followed Gabriel as Federal Minister of Economic Affairs and Energy.

At the Munich Security Conference in February 2017 Gabriel called on NATO members, rather than focus mainly on traditional defense, to focus more on the &quot;root causes of conflict&quot; such as &quot;poverty and climate&quot;.

Gabriel proposed in March 2017 that expenses such as development aid should be considered as part of the NATO 2% GDP defense expenditure guideline. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg later responded that development aid cannot be part of defence spending.

As Foreign Minister Gabriel has said Germany&#x27;s &quot;arms will remain outstretched&quot; to the US to continue the trans-Atlantic alliance between the two countries. However he has said that Germany will step into global markets the US abandons and take on a bigger role on the international stage if Donald Trump continues his protectionist and isolationist policies.

==Life after politics==
Since leaving public office, Gabriel has taken on various paid and unpaid positions.

In 2018, Gabriel was among six of 11 candidates nominated by Siemens to join the board of directors of Siemens Alstom, a planned merger of two railway companies; he ended up not taking the office when the merger was prohibited by the European Commission amid competition concerns. Also in 2018, the German government&#x27;s ethics committee rejected his request to join the supervisory board of Kulczyk Investments, citing potential conflict of interest. In 2019, he rejected an offer to become the head of the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) after media reports that he was in line for the post caused a public outcry and prompted accusations of nepotism.

In June 2019 he said Donald Trump is right to criticize China and to negotiate with North Korea.

Gabriel has been chairman of the Atlantic Bridge and member of the Trilateral Commission as well as the European Council on Foreign Relations. He has also been a member of the Board of Trustees of the International Crisis Group since May 2018 and since March 2019 the advisory board of Deloitte. In the summer semester of 2018, he was a lecturer at the Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn and for three weeks in the fall of 2018 a visiting lecturer at Harvard University. Since November 2019, he has been working at Eurasia Group as a political consultant.

On 24 January 2020, Deutsche Bank nominated him for a seat on the supervisory board of its financial institution. This announcement caused partly critical reactions. For example, Abgeordnetenwatch demanded a grace period of three years for such a change, arguing that it would harm the understanding of democracy if Gabriel less than two years after his departure as vice chancellor &quot;now silvering his address book to Deutsche Bank, which he could fill so bulging only as a representative of the people&quot;. On 20 May 2020, Gabriel was elected as a member of the Integrity Committee of Deutsche Bank to the supervisory board of the same company.

By his own account, Gabriel worked as a consultant for Tönnies Holding from March to the end of May 2020. According to Gabriel, he was to find out what trade restrictions were planned for meat products when exporting to Asia in the wake of African swine fever and how export permits could still be obtained.

Since 2020, the German-Israeli Future Forum Foundation has run the Sylke Tempel Fellowship program under Gabriel&#x27;s auspices. From 2021 to 2022, he was a member of the Trilateral Commission’s Task Force on Global Capitalism in Transition, chaired by Carl Bildt, Kelly Grier and Takeshi Niinami.

==Political positions==

===Foreign policy===

Gabriel has been staunchly against German soldiers remaining in Afghanistan. In 2010, he called for an independent assessment that would determine whether the U.S. counter-insurgency strategy would succeed. However, he voted in favor of extending German participation in the NATO-led security mission ISAF in 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012.

On the occasion of the sixtieth anniversary of the founding of the State of Israel, Gabriel participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the governments of Germany and Israel in Jerusalem in March 2008. In 2012, after having visited Hebron and the Palestinian territories, he said the Palestinians in those areas were systematically discriminated against and called Israel an &quot;Apartheid Regime&quot;.

While German members of parliament call out Iran&#x27;s human rights violations and Nazanin Boniadi, advocate for the Center for Human Rights in Iran, described &quot;systemic gender apartheid&quot; where women advocating equal rights are regularly imprisoned, homosexuality is illegal and can carry the death penalty, Gabriel became the first top level German government visitor to Iran in 13 years as well as the first senior figure from any large western country&#x27;s government to visit the country since it struck an agreement on its nuclear program, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, only days earlier. Travelling with a delegation of German industry representatives keen to move back into the Iranian market, he met with President Hassan Rouhani, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif and Oil Minister Bijan Namdar Zangeneh.

In one of the strongest comments by Germany to push for a federal solution for Ukraine, Gabriel told German weekly &quot;Welt am Sonntag&quot; in August 2014 that a federal structure was the only option to resolve pro-Russian unrest in the country. He added that Germany&#x27;s priority was to prevent direct conflict between Russia and its southern neighbour. Commenting on the international sanctions regime against Russia, Gabriel stated in early 2015 that “we want to help resolve the conflict in Ukraine but don’t want to force Russia to its knees.” He later suggested that Europe consider easing sanctions in exchange for cooperation in Syria. Ukrainian-American historian Alexander J. Motyl has accused Gabriel of &quot;appeasement&quot; and &quot;a complete betrayal of everything democratic socialists claim to stand for.&quot;

In September 2015, amid the European migrant crisis, Gabriel visited the Zaatari refugee camp in Jordan to learn more about the plight of Syrians fleeing the violence in the ongoing Syrian civil war that erupted in 2011. Gabriel publicly urged Saudi Arabia to stop supporting religious radicals, amid growing concern among about the country&#x27;s funding of Wahhabi mosques in Germany which are accused of breeding dangerous Islamists.
In January 2016, Gabriel participated in the first joint cabinet meeting of the governments of Germany and Turkey in Berlin. Later that year, he called any accession of Turkey to the European Union in the near term an &quot;illusion.&quot;

After the G7 summit in 2017, Gabriel stated that the United States, with Donald Trump as president, has &quot;weakened&quot; the West and that the balance of power has now shifted. The remark comes days after Merkel stated, in an apparent policy shift, that &quot;Europeans must really take our fate into our own hands&quot;.

In June 2017, Gabriel criticized the draft of new U.S. sanctions against Russia that target EU–Russia energy projects, including Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline. In a joint statement Gabriel and Austria&#x27;s Chancellor Christian Kern said that &quot;Europe&#x27;s energy supply is a matter for Europe, and not for the United States of America.&quot; They also said: &quot;To threaten companies from Germany, Austria and other European states with penalties on the U.S. market if they participate in natural gas projects such as Nord Stream 2 with Russia or finance them introduces a completely new and very negative quality into European-American relations.&quot;

Gabriel is a supporter of the Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly, an organisation which campaigns for democratic reformation of the United Nations, and the creation of a more accountable international political system. He argued the U.N. needed to be made &quot;more effective, transparent, and democratic through a reform of its structures and decision-making procedures&quot;.

In February 2018, Gabriel accused Russia and China of trying to &quot;undermine&quot; the liberal Western world order. He said that &quot;Nobody should attempt to divide the European Union: not Russia, not China and also not the United States.&quot; In September 2018, Gabriel said that &quot;Ukrainians, Belarusians and Russians experienced unfathomable suffering in World War II. We have a responsibility there.&quot;

In March 2018, after his departure as German foreign minister, Gabriel published an opinion piece about the future of the relations between Turkey (under AKP rule) and the West, where he advocated for an inclusive stance towards Turkey and criticized the policy of the United States in that regard. In February 2020, he joined around fifty former European prime ministers and foreign ministers in signing an open letter published by British newspaper &quot;The Guardian&quot; to condemn U.S. President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan, saying it would create an apartheid-like situation in occupied Palestinian territory.

===Economic policy===
On the occasion of the G20 summit in 2011, Gabriel joined Ed Miliband, the leader of the UK&#x27;s Labour Party, and Håkan Juholt, the chairman of the Swedish Social Democratic Party, in suggesting a “new deal” for economic growth. They also said G20 leaders should commit to the introduction of a financial transaction tax for all major financial centers and an agreement to separate consumer and investment banking.

In a letter to the European Commissioner for Trade, Karel De Gucht, Gabriel stated in March 2014 that “special investment-protection provisions are not required in an agreement between the E.U. and the U.S” on a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). Instead, he later called for a public trade and investment court to replace the current system of private arbitration, and to enable appeals against arbitration rulings. Meanwhile, he has continuously warned against overblowing expectations for an economic boost from TTIP but maintained that the pact was needed to set high common standards for consumers. By August 2016, Gabriel said talks on TTIP had &quot;de facto&quot; failed.

In September 2014, Gabriel rejected the inclusion of an investor-state dispute settlement clause in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) between Canada and the European Union, prompting a renegotiation that delayed the entry into force of the agreement. Following the renegotiations, he championed CETA to demonstrate the center-left party&#x27;s business credentials.

In a 2014 meeting with French economist Thomas Piketty, whose best-selling work &quot;Capital in the Twenty-First Century&quot; calls for a wealth tax, Gabriel rejected such a progressive levy on capital as “crazy” for business. He also argued that a wealth tax would generate no more than 8 billion euros ($9.9 billion) a year.

Together with his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron, Gabriel presented a joint proposal in 2015 to set up a common eurozone budget.

===Energy policy===
Following the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster in 2011, Gabriel harshly criticized the International Atomic Energy Agency, saying it had promoted “the construction of nuclear plants in all parts of the world, even in war and crisis regions. That needs to stop.”

In 2015, Gabriel opposed a European Commission proposal for regional power-capacity markets, according to which utilities are paid for providing backup electricity at times when power generated by renewable sources, such as the sun and wind, cannot supply the grid. A free market backstopped by an emergency reserve will be cheaper and work just as well as capacity markets, Gabriel told &quot;Handelsblatt&quot;. He later warned against a hasty exit from coal-fired power generation, concerned that such a move could pile more pressure on producers still wrestling with the planned shutdown of nuclear plants by 2022.

===Arms exports===
Early in his tenure as Federal Minister of Economic Affairs and Energy, Gabriel vowed a much more cautious approach to licensing arms exports, unnerving the sizeable defense industry and signaling a change in policy from the previous coalition government under which sales rose. In August 2014, he withdrew permission for Rheinmetall to build a military training center east of Moscow.

Gabriel was bound by pledges to his SPD to reduce arms sales to states that abuse human rights and the rule of law or where such sales may contribute to political instability. He stated that controls over the final destination of small arms sold to such nations are still insufficient. However, he also indicated that the government would not universally block deals with countries outside of Germany&#x27;s traditional alliances. Deals with such countries could be approved because of &quot;special foreign-policy or security interests.&quot; In late 2015, his ministry approved a merger of German tank maker Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) with the French armoured vehicle maker Nexter. Gabriel has been criticized by opposition leaders and the press for failing to prevent several deals that resulted in a significant rise in German arms exports during his tenure, although a paradigm shift (lifting of the prohibition against arms exports in zones of war and crisis) already occurred before that.

===Digital policy===
In May 2014, Gabriel and France&#x27;s economy and digital minister Arnaud Montebourg sent the European Commissioner for Competition, Joaquín Almunia, a letter criticizing the settlement of a three-year antitrust probe into Google; Gabriel later “warmly welcomed” the launch of EU antitrust charges against Google in April 2015.

In September 2014, Gabriel called Google, Amazon.com and Apple Inc. “anti-social” for skirting appropriate taxation. In early 2015, Gabriel and his French counterpart Emmanuel Macron wrote in a joint letter to Vice-President of the European Commission Andrus Ansip that the growing power of some online giants “warrants a policy consultation with the aim of establishing an appropriate general regulatory framework for ‘essential digital platforms.’”

In 2016, during a series of Chinese bids for German engineering firms, Gabriel publicly called for a European-wide safeguard clause which could stop foreign takeovers of firms whose technology is deemed strategic for the future economic success of the region.

===Human rights===
In April 2014, human rights lawyer Mo Shaoping was blocked from meeting Gabriel during his visit to China, despite the minister saying ahead of the meeting that he wanted to meet critical voices.

During a 2015 visit to King Salman of Saudi Arabia, Gabriel launched an unusual public effort to persuade Saudi authorities to free imprisoned writer Raif Badawi and grant him clemency, amplifying Germany’s political voice in a region in which its influence had largely been limited to economic issues in years past. He had been urged by MPs and human rights organizations to take up Badawi&#x27;s case before his trip. His outspoken criticism of Saudi justice was unusual for Western leaders visiting the country, a close ally for the West in fighting terrorism and Islamic State militants, particularly given Germany’s status as Saudi Arabia’s third-largest source of imports. While the U.S. State Department had previously also criticized the Badawi sentence, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry did not talk about the case publicly when he visited Riyadh only days before.

During a subsequent trip to Qatar, Gabriel called on the emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim Bin Hamad Al Thani and other senior officials to do better in protecting foreign household workers who face abuse from their employers.

==Controversy==
===Thilo Sarrazin===
In 2010, Gabriel called the speeches of Thilo Sarrazin, his party colleague who wrote critically about immigration by accusing Muslims of refusing to integrate and of “dumbing down” German society, &quot;verbal violence&quot;. He stated that although Sarrazin described many things that were accurate, his conclusions did not fit into the egalitarian “ideals” of Social Democracy anymore.

===Kaiser’s takeover===
In 2016, a German court nullified Gabriel&#x27;s controversial decision to grant a special permission for the country&#x27;s biggest supermarket chain Edeka to buy grocery store chain Kaiser&#x27;s, owned by Tengelmann Group. The judges raised questions about the minister&#x27;s &quot;bias and a lack of neutrality&quot; in the case, saying he had held secret discussion during the decision making process.

==Personal life==
Gabriel has a daughter, Saskia, born in 1989, with his former girlfriend, who is of Jewish origin and whose grandparents were murdered in Auschwitz. Gabriel was subsequently married to his former high school student Munise Demirel, who is of Turkish origin, from 1989 to 1998, and they had no children. In 2012 he married dentist Anke Stadler, with whom he has been in a relationship since 2008; their daughter Marie was born in 2012. His daughter Thea was born on 4 March 2017.

In December 2016, Gabriel underwent bariatric surgery in Offenbach to shrink his stomach and help manage his diabetes.

<text>Stefan Quandt (born 9 May 1966) is a German billionaire heir, engineer and industrialist. As of December 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth at US$21.6 billion, ranked at number 89 on Bloomberg Billionaires Index.

==Early life==
Quandt was born in Bad Homburg to Herbert Quandt, a German industrialist and prominent Nazi, and Johanna Quandt. He earned a degree from the University of Karlsruhe where he studied economics and engineering, from 1987 to 1993.

==Career==
From 1993–1994, Quandt worked for the Boston Consulting Group in Munich. From 1994 to 1996 he worked for Datacard Group of Minneapolis as a marketing manager in Hong Kong.

===BMW===
On his father&#x27;s death in 1982 Quandt inherited 17.4% of BMW, the company his father had saved from bankruptcy in 1959. From further purchases he later owned 23.7% of the company. In 1997, he joined the company&#x27;s supervisory board.

Following his mother’s death in 2015, Quandt’s voting stake in BMW temporarily increased to 34.19 percent, above a 30 percent threshold which triggered a compulsory takeover offer under German rules. He subsequently asked the Federal Financial Supervisory Authority (BaFin) to be excused from these rules. In 2018, Quandt became BMW’s largest single shareholder when his direct ownership increased with shares inherited from his mother, giving him a so-called “blocking stake” of 25.83 percent, worth 13.4 billion euros ($16.6 billion). He currently is deputy chairman of the BMW supervisory board. 

===Delton===
Quandt also inherited from his father substantial holdings in other companies, many of which he has been running through his holding company, Delton AG, since 1989. These include:
* 76.8% of CEAG, (small power supplies and recharging devices for mobile phones)
* 87.6% of Logwin AG (formerly Thiel Logistik, a logistics and freight forwarding company)
* 100% of Biologische Heilmittel Heel GmbH, which makes homeopathic preparations
* 100% of CeDo Household Products, which makes freezer bags, plastic and aluminium wraps and foils, bin liners, and coffee filters

With his mother, Quandt owned 18.3% of Gemplus International, a large digital security company, before its merger to form Gemalto in 2006.

===Aqton===
With a second holding company, Aqton SE, Quandt manages other investments, including in renewable energies:
* Heliatek, organic solar panels
* Solarwatt, manufacturer of PV panels, solar batteries and energy management solutions
* Kiwigrid, grid based renewable energy solution for utilities
* BHF, financial services

==Philanthropy==
Through the non-profit Aqtivator, Quandt supports projects for children, youth, and families with a focus on education, integration, and equal opportunity.

==Other activities==
===Corporate boards===
* &quot;Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;, Member of the Supervisory Board (since 2019)
* Dresdner Bank, former Member of the Supervisory Board
* Gerling Konzern Allgemeine Versicherungs, former Member of the Supervisory Board
===Non-profit organizations===
* Friends of the Museum für Moderne Kunst, Chair of the Board (since 2015)
* Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), Member of the Supervisory Board (since 2013)
* BMW Foundation, Member of the Board of Trustees
* Eberhard von Kuenheim Foundation, Member of the Board of Trustees
* Johanna Quandt Foundation, Member of the Board of Trustees
* Stiftung Charité, Member of the Board of Trustees

==Political activities==
Following the 2013 elections, Quandt – together with his mother and his sister – made donations to the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) totaling 690,000 euros. Ahead of the 2017 elections, he gave 50,000 euros each to both the CDU and liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP).

==Personal life==
In autumn 2005, Quandt married Katharina, a software engineer. They have a daughter, born on New Year&#x27;s Eve that same year. He generally keeps a low profile. They live in Frankfurt, Germany.

==&quot;The Silence of the Quandts&quot;==
The Hanns-Joachim-Friedrichs-Award winning documentary film &quot;The Silence of the Quandts&quot; by the German public broadcaster ARD described in October 2007 the role of the Quandt family businesses during the Second World War. The family&#x27;s Nazi past was not well known, but the documentary film revealed this to a wide audience and confronted the Quandts about the use of slave labourers in the family&#x27;s factories during World War II. As a result, five days after the showing, four family members announced, on behalf of the entire Quandt family, their intention to fund a research project in which a historian will examine the family&#x27;s activities during Adolf Hitler&#x27;s dictatorship. The independent 1,200-page study researched and compiled by Bonn historian, Joachim Scholtyseck, that was released in 2011 concluded: &quot;The Quandts were linked inseparably with the crimes of the Nazis&quot;. no compensation, apology or memorial at the site of one of their factories, have been permitted. BMW was not implicated in the report.

<doc id="852173" wikidata="Q6265283" url="?curid=852173" title="John Zaffis">
<text>John Zaffis (born December 18, 1955) is a paranormal researcher born and based in Connecticut, United States. He starred in the SyFy paranormal reality TV show, &quot;Haunted Collector&quot;, and runs the Paranormal and Demonology Research Society of New England, which he founded in 1998.

==Career==
Zaffis has over forty years of experience as a paranormal investigator. Research has taken Zaffis all over the United States as well as Canada, England, and Scotland. He lectures at colleges, universities, and libraries throughout the United States, although usually not under academic auspices. Zaffis currently runs the Museum of the Paranormal located in Stratford, Connecticut. He also starred in and wrote the documentary film &quot;Museum of the Paranormal&quot;, which was released in spring 2010 and produced by New Gravity Media. His first book, &quot;Shadows of the Dark&quot;, was co-written with Brian McIntyre and published in 2004 through iUniverse.

A documentary film on his work and personal life, called &quot;John Zaffis: The World Within&quot; and produced by CORE Films (which also produced the paranormal documentary series &quot;Scared!&quot;), was released on September 3, 2010.

==&quot;Haunted Collector&quot;==
Zaffis starred in a documentary TV series on Syfy called &quot;Haunted Collector&quot;, which premiered on June 1, 2011. It features him, his son, his daughter, and three other crew members searching for ghosts in certain buildings people call upon him to investigate. The premise of the show is that the crew finds an item in the building that may have some sort of connection with a haunting. The show was initially cancelled in November 2013. It has subsequently been renewed and as of October 2016 is releasing new episodes on Destination America.

==Other media appearances==
Zaffis has made appearances on &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;, &quot;Fox News Live&quot;, and the Discovery Channel documentaries &quot;Little Lost Souls&quot; and &quot;A Haunting in Connecticut&quot;. He currently co-hosts the &quot;Paranormal Nights&quot; radio show with Brendan Keenan. Zaffis was also in two episodes of &quot;A Haunting&quot; (&quot;The Possessed&quot; and &quot;Ghost Hunter&quot;) where the main characters of both episodes are possessed by harmful demons. In the 2008 docudrama &quot;The Possessed&quot;, he plays himself as the demonologist. Zaffis also appeared and was interviewed in the 2009 &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot; episode at the Remington Arms factory. He also appeared in the 2009 &quot;Scared!&quot; episode filmed at the Grand Midway Hotel.

Zaffis has appeared six times on the long-running radio program &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot; from 2005 to 2007. Often, he is a guest and co-host on the &quot;Beyond Reality Radio&quot; program hosted by The Atlantic Paranormal Society&#x27;s Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson.

He has also appeared in several episodes of the Travel Channel&#x27;s paranormal reality TV program, &quot;Ghost Adventures&quot;, as well as on ABC&#x27;s investigative program, &quot;20/20&quot;, and on Piers Morgan&#x27;s cable talk show broadcast on CNN.

==Personal life==
Zaffis admits that he was initially very skeptical of the existence of ghosts, until one Wednesday evening when he was sixteen and saw a transparent apparition at the foot of his bed shaking its head back and forth. When he told his mother of the incident, Zaffis learned that his grandfather, when he was alive, always shook his head when he was upset about something. In the next few days, Zaffis&#x27; grandmother, who lived with him, died. This incident piqued his interest in the paranormal and set him about talking to authorities on the subject and reading about the paranormal. Zaffis spent his first years studying under his uncle and aunt Ed and Lorraine Warren, both demonologists.

What he learned from his aunt and uncle exceeded his original interests in ghosts and haunted houses. Zaffis became interested in demonology at a young age, which led into his involvement with cases of spirit possession and exorcism and working with prominent exorcists in that field. He has studied the work of Roman Catholic priests, monks, Buddhists, rabbis, and Protestant ministers. Zaffis has also taken part in and assisted with the work of well-known exorcists like Bishop Robert McKenna, Malachi Martin, and Reverend Jun.

According to fellow paranormal investigator Jason Hawes, co-star of the reality television series &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot;, Zaffis counseled him after he began seeing apparitions at the age of twenty. Hawes credits Zaffis with his subsequent career as a ghost hunter.

<doc id="852174" wikidata="Q943661" url="?curid=852174" title="Muhammad VIII al-Amin">
<text>Muhammad VIII al-Amin (; 4 September 1881 – 30 September 1962) commonly known as Lamine Bey (), was the last Bey of Tunis (15 May 1943 – 20 March 1956), and also the only King of Tunisia (20 March 1956 – 25 July 1957).

He was enthroned in unusual circumstances following the removal of his predecessor Muhammad VII al Munsif by the French Resident General Henri Giraud in 1943. It was not until the latter&#x27;s death in 1948 that his legitimacy was recognized by the people of Tunisia. He took steps to align himself with the Tunisian national movement against the French protectorate but was sidelined by the Neo Destour after he accepted French-initiated reforms in 1954. Shortly after independence Lamine Bey was turned out of his palace along with his family. Their property was seized and several family members were imprisoned. He ended his days living in a small apartment in Tunis.

==Bey al-Mahalla (Crown Prince)==

On 19 June 1942 Ahmed II died and was succeeded by Muhammad VII (also known as Moncef Bey). In accordance with tradition on 25 June Moncef Bey named Lamine Bey Bey al-Mahalla, or heir apparent, decorated him with the Ahd El-Amane and made him a Divisional General. A month later he had an opportunity to display his loyalty to his sovereign when he was contacted by one of the court counsellors, General M&#x27;hammed Belkhodja. Belkhodja, fearing for his own political future, was trying to persuade the French Resident General Jean-Pierre Esteva to depose Moncef Bey. Lamine Bey however warned the ruler of this conspiracy and Belkhodja was expelled from the palace on 30 July.

== Replacement of Moncef Bey==

Towards the end of the Tunisian Campaign in May 1943 General Alphonse Juin, Commander in Chief of French forces in North Africa, arrived in Tunis with orders to depose Muhammad VII for alleged attempts to collaborate with Axis forces during the occupation and for an indulgent attitude to the actions of the militant nationalist Destour party. After investigating the Bey&#x27;s conduct, Juin could find no grounds for condemning him, but his orders were explicit. He tried to persuade Moncef to abdicate, but he refused. Juin therefore visited Lamine in his villa in La Marsa to make sure that he would not refuse the throne if it was offered, but Lamine at first refused to give this undertaking. Eventually Juin prevailed on him to agree, largely because of the benefits to his family. As Moncef Bey refused to abdicate, General Giraud removed him on 14 May 1943.

Muhammad VIII was installed on 15 May 1943 at the Bardo palace by General Juin, who invested him at the same time with the Légion d&#x27;honneur. He then received the homage of other princes of the royal family, ministers, court officials and members of the consular corps. For this occasion he reinstated the kissing of the hand, which his predecessor had abolished. That same day, Mohamed Chenik presented the resignation of his government and was replaced by Slaheddine Baccouche. As was the norm under the French protectorate, the Bey was not consulted on the choice of ministers (the Chenik government appointed by Moncef Bey had been an exception to this rule). It was only on 6 July that Moncef Bey eventually abdicated, thereby rendering Lamine Bey&#x27;s accession legitimate. For most Tunisians however, Lamine Bey was still considered to be a usurper.

==Early reign (1943–1948) ==

Lamine Bey kept a low profile in the face of demands from loyalists for the return of Moncef Bey. His rare appearances showed that his subjects were indifferent to him, or indeed hostile. To rebuild his standing, he supported the teachers of the University of Ez-Zitouna who were striking in December 1943 and chose Neo Destourians as ministers. Nevertheless, the general opinion was that he wanted to abdicate and restore the throne to Moncef Bey. When these rumours were denied, his popularity fell again.

On 7 May 1944 Charles de Gaulle visited Tunis on the first anniversary of its liberation from the Axis. Tunisians hoped that he would reverse the injustice of his old rival Giraud and restore Moncef Bey, but the Moncefists were disappointed in this hope. Instead De Gaulle presented Lamine Bey a Cross of Lorraine in gold, having learned that during the Axis occupation he used to listen secretly to De Gaulle&#x27;s broadcasts from London. The Bey wore this on his uniform next to his decorations for a long time afterwards.

Hostility towards the Bey showed no signs of decreasing. He was boycotted by the other Husainid princes when he went to the mosque for Eid al-Fitr. To raise his prestige, he was invited to Paris where he attended the military parades on 14 July 1945, standing next to De Gaulle. He then went on to visit Germany. For Tunisians however, he remained &#x27;The Bey of the French&#x27;. In August 1946 when the capital was at a standstill during a general strike to protest the arrest of several nationalists, he feigned ill-health to cancel the ceremony of kissing hands which he was due to hold for Eid al-Fitr, but when he passed through the streets of Tunis in February 1947 on the Mawlid festival, he could readily see his subjects&#x27; indifference. The anniversary of his accession was regarded by shopkeepers as a good occasion to close their premises and put up portraits of his predecessor. People even spat on his car. His health deteriorated in the face of this hatred and in 1947 an x-ray revealed a lesion in his left lung. Dr. Mohamed Ben Salem (1915–2001), husband of his daughter Princess Zakia, became his doctor and later his political advisor as well.

On 3 March 1947, the new French Resident General Jean Mons arrived in Tunis. The political situation had remained unchanged since the end of the war – the Destour and Neo Destour could agree on nothing except the demand to remove Lamine Bey and reinstate his predecessor. The court was consumed by a morbid obsession with his restoration. Indeed, the mood was so pervasive that Mons suggested to the French government that they proceed to restore Moncef Bey. Prime Minister Paul Ramadier refused, fearing the adverse reaction of French settlers in North Africa. On 19 July 1947 a new Grand Vizier, Mustapha Kaak, was appointed by the Resident General. For the first time, there was parity between Tunisians and French in the government.

Moncef Bey died in exile on 1 September 1948. His remains were brought to Tunis on 5 September for burial, and thousands of Tunisians turned out to pay their respects to him. His family threatened to boycott the ceremony if Lamine Bey attended, and he made no effort to present his condolences to them. However this was a turning point for his reign, as the possibility of Moncef Bey&#x27;s restoration was now removed, and for the first time, his people began to regard him as their legitimate ruler.

==Closer relations with the nationalist movement (1948–53)==

After the death of Moncef Bey, relations between Lamine Bey and the nationalists improved. The Bey worked clandestinely with Habib Bourguiba and Salah Ben Youssef to raise demands for Tunisian self-government and during the period 1948–1951 was able to put the French authorities under considerable pressure. In 1952 a new Resident General took office, Jean de Hauteclocque, who took a much harder line than his predecessor and imprisoned Bourguiba and other nationalist leaders. The Bey sent an angry telegram to President Vincent Auriol complaining of De Hauteclocque&#x27;s discourteous and threatening tone. The only result was that within a few hours, every one of his ministers had been arrested and interned. Deprived of the support of his ministers, on 28 March the Bey eventually gave way and signed the decree naming De Hauteclocque&#x27;s nominee Slaheddine Baccouche as his Grand Vizier. However he refused to sign any decrees issued by the Baccouche cabinet or by the Resident General, bringing government to a standstill and producing deadlock.

With all his ministers and advisers in prison, Lamine Bey relied on the counsel and support of the trade union leader Farhat Hached, but in December 1952 he was assassinated by extremist French settlers of La Main Rouge. Unable to resist de Hauteclocque any longer, Lamine Bey eventually signed the decrees on limited internal autonomy which had been formulated months previously in Paris, thereby allowing new municipal elections. However the reforms imposed by the French remained a dead letter – the nationalists launched a campaign of terror against both candidates and voters. This extended as far as the ruling family itself – on 1 July 1953 the Bey&#x27;s heir apparent Azzedine Bey was assassinated inside his own palace, accused of conducting discussions of his own with the Resident General.

On 2 September 1953, Jean de Hauteclocque was finally recalled to Paris and the new Resident General, Pierre Voizard took a more conciliatory line. Thousands of prisoners were freed and censorship was scaled back. However Voizard&#x27;s instructions from the French government made the relative calm only temporary – he was to pursue a reform policy with the Bey only, but not with the Neo Destour. France hoped by this means to drive a wedge between the ruler and the militant nationalists. Lamine Bey was too wily to be deceived by the apparently pleasant demeanour of the new Resident General. On 16 October 1953 he refused to preside at the opening of the Tunis-Carthage Fair because some repressive measures were still in place. More efforts were made to appease him – on 1 January 1954 a number of nationalist leaders were freed and promptly received by the Bey. Bourguiba however, regarded by France as highly dangerous, remained confined on La Galite.

==Estrangement from the nationalist movement (1953–56)==

With Bourguiba still in exile, Lamine Bey asked Mohamed Salah Mzali to negotiate a new reform package with the Resident General. On 18 January 1954, sufficient progress had been made that the Bey asked him to form a new government. A number of nationalists, including Hédi Nouira, were willing to give these reforms a chance, but the French refusal to free Bourguiba remained a stumbling block for many Tunisians, and indeed, for Bourguiba himself. &#x27;The failure of an old man terrorized by the fear of deposition and exile, combined with the vile ambition of an unscrupulous adventurer risk depriving Tunisia of the only asset that remains to it: it standing as a nation state; its legal character, recognized internationally by treaty and confirmed by the General Assembly of the United Nations. Suddenly my release has been postponed indefinitely&#x27; he commented. On 27 May Bourguiba, who had recently been transferred from La Gailte to custody in France, returned to the Bey the Grand Cross of the Nichan Iftikhar which he had received in 1950.

Mzali&#x27;s cabinet resigned on 17 June 1954 and no successor was appointed. Bitter at the defeat of his efforts, the Bey confided to Voizard &#x27;For a year, since I have been asking for Bourguiba to be released or transferred to a spa, I have received nothing but threats. Then you transfer him to a remote island without seeking my opinion. Now you are transferring him close to Paris, depriving me of the goodwill I might have earned by securing this move for him. I am ready to take up my rifle and become a fellagha to rebuild my contact with my people, for you have done everything possible to separate me from them.&#x27;

On 31 July 1954 the new French Prime Minister Pierre Mendès France arrived in Tunis. He was received by Lamine Bey in the Royal Palace of Carthage, where he announced internal autonomy for Tunisia. This was a welcome surprise for the Bey, who had been kept at arm&#x27;s length from the negotiations between Mendès France and the Neo Destourians before his visit. Shortly afterwards, the Bey addressed his subjects: &#x27;A new phase has just begun in the life of our beloved country. It is hard for us to recall the painful days that all of Tunisia has lived through... before this decisive step in our national life, we must stand equal to our destiny in offering to the world the spectacle of a united people marching serenely towards progress. This great constructive effort to which we are summoned can only bear fruit for us through order, peace and security, which all the inhabitants of this country have the right to enjoy.&#x27; There was no doubt however that the balance of forces had shifted decisively away from the Bey. For France, the experience of the failed Mzali government highlighted the futility of hoping to evolve political institutions by means of negotiating only with the Bey. The new Resident General, Pierre Boyer de Latour was quick to understand this and it was now the Neo Destour who were the sole interlocutors for the Tunisian people.

Despite the repeated efforts of the Bey, a new government was formed without consulting the palace. To recover some semblance of his former influence, on 10 August he proposed to the French government that the institution of the beylicate should be replaced with a full monarchy, which would give him the authority he felt was appropriate. He was willing, in return, to sign supplementary agreements to the Treaty of Bardo necessary to maintain Franco-Tunisian cooperation and preserve the French presence in Tunisia. At the same time, he opened communications with Salah ben Youssef, in exile in Geneva. None of these approaches led to anything. After six months of negotiation, the autonomy accords were signed on 3 June 1955. Bourguiba had returned to Tunis on 1 June, welcomed as he came down the gangplank by the Bey&#x27;s three sons, and by a giant demonstration of Tunisians. Having crossed the capital in triumph, Bourguiba visited the Bey in Carthage, apparently unmindful of having returned his decoration only a few months before, and made a stirring declaration of the deep attachment felt by the Tunisian people towards beylical rule. On 7 August the Bey applied his seal to the conventions agreed with France and on 1 September, for the first time since the protectorate was established in 1881, he applied his seal to decrees that had not been authorized by the Resident General. On 29 December 1955 his seal confirmed a decree establishing a Constituent Assembly for the country, with elections to be held on 8 April 1956. Tunisia appeared to be evolving into a constitutional monarchy.

In fact, power continued to ebb rapidly away from Lamine Bey as independence approached. Salah Ben Youssef returned from exile on 13 September 1955, giving the Bey hopes that his political power would start to be restored. He was close to Ben Youssef, who had been one of the few politicians to pay his respects to him at the time of his installation in 1943. However violence quickly erupted between followers of Ben Youssef and those of Bourguiba, leaving the Bey to vainly attempt to act as arbiter between them. The French had already transferred authority over the police force from the Resident General to the Tunisian government, whose ministers had been chosen by Bourguiba, so Ben Youssef&#x27;s representations to the Bey had no effect. On 2 December the Bey summoned the Resident General (now known as the High Commissioner) Roger Seydoux to remind him of France&#x27;s responsibility for public order—which in fact it no longer had. In effect, the Bey was appealing for a restoration of colonial powers from the nationalist government. As his appeals had no effect he made use of the only power remaining to him and refused to apply his seal to the decrees authorizing the forthcoming elections and the appointment of local governors and mayors. This move was welcomed by Ben Youssef, who demanded a ministerial reshuffle, but naturally alienated the Bey further from Bourguiba and his followers. He backed down and signed them the following day. Ben Youssef fled the country on 28 January and a crackdown followed on his followers in Tunisia, in which Bourguiba relied on the army, with its French officers, the airforce and heavy artillery. Horrified at this brutality, Lamine Bey renewed his ineffective protestations to Seydoux in April 1956. The only effect was to enrage Bourguiba, who hastened to the palace to accuse the Bey and his family of seeking to hinder the transfer of power from France to the Tunisian government. On 20 March 1956 the Franco-Tunisian protocol was signed by the Grand Vizier Tahar Ben Ammar and the French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau.

== King and Deposition (1956–1957) ==

The French protectorate in Tunisia officially ended on 20 March 1956. On the same day, the Kingdom of Tunisia was proclaimed and the Bey was proclaimed King of Tunisia. His reign, however, was to be short-lived.

The 1956 Tunisian Constituent Assembly election saw a landslide victory for the National Union (an alliance between Neo Destour, the Tunisian General Labour Union, the National Union of Tunisian Farmers and the Tunisian Union of Craftsmen and Merchants) which won all 98 seats. 

The Constituent Assembly held its formal opening ceremony on 8 April 1956. It was a sign of the changing times that the King presided over the session dressed in the uniform of a marshal of the Ottoman Empire, whose subject he had been when he was born, but which had ceased to exist in 1922. He expected to be present during the debates leading to the election of a speaker of the Assembly, and Prime Minister Tahar Ben Ammar had to intervene to persuade him to leave. The King withdrew with ill grace.

Two days later, Ben Ammar resigned and the King appointed Bourguiba as new Prime Minister.

On 31 May a decree from the Constituent Assembly abolished all privileges, exemptions and immunities which had previously been accorded to the ruling family. They were now simply ordinary citizens. Although this abruptly ended the civil list payments to members of his family and placed the crown estate under government control, the King signed the decree without protest. Another decree on 21 June modified the national emblems and removed any reference to the Husainid dynasty; another still, on 31 August, removed the King&#x27;s prerogative to pass regulations, transferring this to the Prime Minister.

Further decrees followed, compelling the King to turn over various properties to the state, against the backdrop of a hostile press campaign highlighting the questionable, and perhaps even criminal, circumstances under which they had been acquired. These measures served to greatly reduce the remaining prestige of the King. Nonetheless King Muhammad VIII was the first person to be honoured, on 19 December 1956, with the decoration of the new Order of Independence. He reciprocated on the same day by awarding Bourguiba the Nichan Iftikhar (for the second time). Bourguiba clearly had little remaining respect for the ruling family however. On 19 July, at Eid al-Fitr he made a protocol visit with his ministers to the King&#x27;s wife, but refused to approach the throne. &#x27;I have not come here as I did before, but as head of the government. You should step forward to meet me and not remain seated in your throne,&#x27; he declared.

On 15 July 1957 the Tunisian army replaced the Royal Guard around the palace, and thereafter the King effectively lost his freedom of movement. On 18 July his younger son Salah Eddine was arrested on charges falsified by the police.

On 25 July 1957 the Constituent Assembly voted on a show of hands to abolish the monarchy, declare a Republic and make Bourguiba President.

Straight away, a delegation headed by deputy speaker Ali Belhouane Interior Minister Taïeb Mehiri and Justice Minister Ahmed Mestiri went to the palace of Carthage to make the King aware of the decree and ask him to leave the palace along with his wife, their three sons, seven daughters and grandchildren.

&#x27;We went into the throne room right away, and without being announced, as we were already expected. Lamine Bey, wearing a jebba and with his hair undressed, stood there, dignified, without saying a word. Belhouane called out in his theatrical voice &quot;As-Salamou Alaikum&quot; and then read out the resolution of the Constituent Assembly. A photographer had come with us, and wanted to start working, but straight away the King broke his silence. &quot;Ah no, not that!&quot; he said, making a gesture of refusal, the last reflex of his authority. We did not want to deny the wishes of the old man, or humiliate him further. Then Ali Belhaouane made a gesture of salute with his hand, repeated &quot;As-Salamou Alaikum&quot; in his stentorian voice, and turned on his heels. As we withdrew, police commissioner Driss Guiga presented himself and advised the fallen ruler of an order from the Minister of the Interior placing him in isolation. In the course of this, hearing the name of his father spoken, the King reacted again, saying &quot;Allah Yarhamou&quot; (May God save his soul) clearly out loud as he left the room. It was over. The whole thing had not even lasted three minutes.&#x27;

== Confinement and death ==

The 75-year old Muhammad left his palace wearing a simple jebba of white linen and a pair of yellow Moroccan slippers, which he lost along the way. He was taken to the Hidaya palace in Manouba, an old abandoned beylical palace without water or electricity, which was assigned to him and several members of his family: his wife Lalla Djeneïna, their sons princes Chedly, M&#x27;hamed and Salah Eddine, princess Soufia, his son in law Mohamed Ben Salem and the Bey al-Mahalla Hassine Bey. The furniture of their new dwelling was no more than a mattress on the floor, with no sheets or covers. Food was provided for the first three days, after which the family was left to fend for itself.

Chedly and Ben Salem were transferred to the prison of Kairouan on 11 August. Hassine, M&#x27;hamed and princess Soufia were freed several days later. The last son, Salah Eddine, was transferred to the civil prison in Tunis three months after his house arrest. Alone in the ruined palace, the old couple were not allowed to leave until October 1958, as Lamine&#x27;s health had deteriorated very badly. They were then transferred to a small villa in La Soukra with a kitchen, a bathroom and two other rooms and given a monthly allowance of 80 dinars, roughly the same as the salary of a secondary school teacher. They remained under house arrest and were forbidden even to go into the garden outside – indeed a policeman remained on duty actually inside the villa. Their daughter princess Soufia was allowed to visit them whenever she wished however. On 8 September the trial of Tahar Ben Ammar came to an end, having worked up the public mood with accusations made, and later withdrawn, about the who possessed the jewels which had belonged to the Bey&#x27;s wife, which had still not been found.

Two years later, the search for the jewels was renewed and both the former King and his wife were summoned for interrogation. It may have been at this point that Salah Eddine, still confined in the civil prison of Tunis, was taken to his father, imprisoned in the same building, to say farewell to him. Summoned to the national security headquarters Lamine&#x27;s wife was interrogated relentlessly for three days to the point where she could no longer speak and suffered an apoplexy as her son Salah Eddine recalled years later. &#x27;As for mother, she never recovered from her arrest and most of all from the three days of interrogation on the fourth floor of the Ministry of the Interior, where the security forces questioned her endlessly about what happened to the family jewels. Whether she was maltreated or not, she came back with blood coming from her mouth and internal hemorrhages in her lower abdomen. She died later in my father&#x27;s arms, still in shock, and without ever telling us what she had undergone during her interrogation.&#x27; Taken back to La Soukra in agony, she died two days later. She was buried in the cemetery of Sidi Abdelaziz in La Marsa, with her sons Salah Eddine and M&#x27;hamed present. Lamine was not allowed to leave his villa for the occasion. The public was also kept away from the burial by the police. Sidi Ali Ben Khodja, the Sheikh El Islam, was however allowed to enter the cemetery to pronounce the prayer for the dead.

Several days later, the former King&#x27;s house arrest was lifted. Lamine was allowed to go out into his own garden, and to visit the tomb of his wife. He left the villa in La Soukra and moved into the apartment of a Jewish friend in the Rue de Yougoslavie, who had already taken in Ahmed El Kassar, husband of Princess Soufia as well as the family of Prince Salah Eddine when they were expelled from the palace. When Prince Chedly was freed in 1961, he joined them in Tunis in the Rue Fénelon in Lafayette, in a two-room apartment which was placed under constant surveillance.

Muhammad died on 30 September 1962 at the age of 81. He was buried in the cemetery of Sidi Abdelaziz next to his wife, unlike most rulers of his family who were interred in the mausoleum of Tourbet el Bey in the medina of Tunis. Sheikh Muhammad al-Tahir ibn Ashur said the prayers over his body and a single photographer, Victor Sebag, recorded the event, and was held overnight in a police cell for doing so. He was succeeded as head of the Husainid Dynasty and titular king by Husain Bey.

==Family and private life==

<text>Civil Air Transport (CAT) was a Nationalist Chinese airline, later owned by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), that supported United States covert operations throughout East and Southeast Asia. During the Cold War, missions consisted in assistance to &quot;Free World&quot; allies according to the Mutual Defense Assistance Act of 1949.

==Origins==

CAT was created by Claire Chennault and Whiting Willauer in 1946 as Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (CNRRA) Air Transport. Using surplus World War II aircraft such as the C-47 Dakota and the C-46 Commando, CAT airlifted supplies and food into war-ravaged China. It was soon pressed into service to support Chiang Kai-shek and his Kuomintang forces in the civil war between them and the communists under Mao Zedong. Many of its first pilots were veterans of Chennault&#x27;s World War II combat groups, popularly known as Flying Tigers. (Other of Chennault&#x27;s veterans went on to form another air transport company, the Flying Tiger Line. This was a completely separate operation from Civil Air Transport and the follow-on Air America.)

By 1950, following the defeat of Chiang&#x27;s forces and their retreat to Taiwan, the airline faced financial difficulties. The CIA formed a private Delaware corporation called Airdale Corporation, which formed a subsidiary called CAT, Inc. The subsidiary corporation purchased nominal shares of Civil Air Transport. CAT maintained a civilian appearance by flying scheduled passenger flights while simultaneously using other aircraft in its fleet to fly covert missions.

With the spread of communism throughout Southeast Asia, CAT&#x27;s mission changed.

==Military operations==

===Chinese Civil War===
During the Chinese Civil War, under contract with the Chinese Nationalist government and later the CIA, CAT flew supplies and ammunition into China to assist Kuomintang forces on the Chinese mainland, primarily using C-47 and C-46 aircraft. With the defeat of the Kuomintang in 1949, CAT helped to evacuate thousands of Chinese to Taiwan.

===Korean War===
During the Korean War, CAT airlifted thousands of tons of war materials to supply United States military operations, including support of Kuomintang holdouts based in Burma (Operation PAPER). On 29 November 1952, a CAT C-47 left Seoul on a mission to collect an anti-Communist Chinese agent in the foothills of northeastern China, using a &quot;pole and line&quot; technique. The mission was apparently compromised and Chinese forces were waiting for them. Approaching low over the ground, it was attacked by small-arms fire, and crash-landed near the town of Antu in China&#x27;s Jilin province. The pilots, Robert Snoddy and Norman Schwartz were killed during the crash and subsequent fire, and were buried nearby. The two CIA officers, John T. Downey and Richard G. Fecteau survived and were immediately taken prisoner by Chinese forces, who were waiting for the flight. Downey and Fecteau were held by China and regularly interrogated for nearly twenty years. Fecteau was released unexpectedly following Nixon&#x27;s visit to China in 1972, but Downey was released only after Washington publicly acknowledged their spy mission in 1973.

At the time the families of the pilots were told, in order to keep the CIA&#x27;s covert actions in China secret, that they had crashed into the Sea of Japan on a routine flight to Tokyo. In 2001, China allowed the US Defense Department&#x27;s Prisoner of War and Missing in Action (POW/MIA) office to conduct a recovery effort for the bodies of the pilots. In 2005 the POW/MIA office announced that it had identified the remains of Robert Snoddy using DNA analysis. Schwartz&#x27;s remains have not been recovered.

The 1952-1953 edition of &quot;Jane&#x27;s All The World&#x27;s Aircraft&quot; lists the head office address as Suite 309, Kass Building, 711 14th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C., with the footnote that the company had reregistered in the U.S. The president is given as Whiting Willauer, and the fleet listed as 23 Curtiss C-46 Commando and 4 Douglas DC-3 aircraft.

===First Indochina War===

On May 1, 1953, &quot;Operation Squaw&quot; began, calling for CAT to airdrop supplies to French troops besieged at Na Sam, Laos. This operation was the first U.S. involvement in what became the First Indochina War. CAT transported supplies and troops for French operations during &quot;Operation Castor&quot; in November 1953.

CAT assisted the French government at various times during its Indochina wars, flying supplies and equipment into Hanoi&#x27;s Gia Lam airport and other fields using C-46 and C-47 transport planes.

&quot;Operation Squaw-II&quot; was approved on January 29, 1954, and, after negotiations with the French, a contract was signed on March 3 for CAT to supply 24 pilots to operate 12 C-119s. At the Battle of Dien Bien Phu, CAT supplied the French garrison by parachuting troops and supplies with covert USAF C-119 inscribed with French Air Force insignia. Two CAT pilots James B. McGovern Jr. and Wallace Buford were killed in action during the siege of Dien Bien Phu in May 1954. They were the first American casualties of what was later termed the Vietnam War. McGovern&#x27;s remains were recovered in 2002 and identified in 2006. Seven surviving CAT pilots out of the thirty-seven involved in the battle received the French Legion of Honor in February 2005 during a special ceremony at the French embassy in Washington.

The 1956-1957 edition of &quot;Jane&#x27;s All The World&#x27;s Aircraft&quot; lists the head office address as 46 Chung Shan Road, North, 2nd Section, Taipei, Taiwan (Formosa). The president and general manager is given as Hugh L. Grundy, with C.J. Rosbert listed as vice-president and assistant general manager. The fleet is listed as 2 Douglas DC-4, 22 Curtiss Commando, 2 Douglas DC-3, 3 Douglas C-47, and 2 Convair Catalina.

In the 1958-1959 edition of Jane&#x27;s, the last year in which the &quot;Airlines of the World&quot; section was carried, the home office address in Taiwan remained the same, but no company officers are listed. The fleet is given as 3 Douglas DC-4, 25 Curtiss C-46, 5 Douglas DC-3, 2 Convair Catalina, with 2 Douglas DC-6B on order.

===PRRI/Permesta movement in Indonesia===

In 1958 &quot;Time&quot; reported that 20 CAT aircraft were supplying the PRRI/Permesta movement against President Sukarno&#x27;s government of Indonesia, which the Eisenhower administration feared had communist sympathies. In April 1958 two CAT pilots flew combat missions for Permesta&#x27;s &quot;Angkatan Udara Revolusioner&quot; (&quot;Revolutionary Air Force&quot;) or AUREV. William H. Beale and Allen Pope flew CIA Douglas B-26 Invaders for AUREV. In May, Beale withdrew from the operation, by which time a third CAT pilot, Connie W Seigrist, had joined flying a CIA Consolidated PBY Catalina. The CIA directed Beale and Pope to target not only Indonesian armed forces but also unarmed foreign merchant ships, in order to frighten overseas trade away from Indonesian waters, thereby weakening the Indonesian economy and undermining Sukarno&#x27;s government. On April 28, 1958, Beale attacked the Royal Dutch Shell terminal at Balikpapan in East Kalimantan, sinking the British tanker , while Pope off the port of Donggala near Palu in Central Sulawesi sank merchant ships from Greece, Italy and Panama.

On May 18 west of Ambon Island, Pope attacked one of a pair of Indonesian merchant ships that were carrying government troops for a counter-offensive against Permesta. An Indonesian Air Force P-51 and anti-aircraft fire from the ships shot down the B-26, and Pope and his Indonesian radio operator were captured. The CIA had ordered the CAT pilots to fly &quot;sterile&quot;, i.e. with no documents that could either identify them or link them with the US government. However, Pope was carrying about 30 documents including his detailed flight log, secret orders for temporary deployment in Indonesia, military separation file and CAT identity card. Pope&#x27;s capture with these documents immediately exposed the level of CIA support for the Permesta rebellion. Embarrassed, the Eisenhower administration quickly ended CIA support for Permesta and withdrew its agents and remaining aircraft from AUREV.

Early in 1960 an Indonesian military court tried Pope; in April it convicted him and sentenced him to death. However, in 1962 Robert F. Kennedy negotiated with President Sukarno, and in August that year the Indonesian authorities released Pope and returned him to the US.

===Vietnam War===
In 1959, CAT was reorganized as Air America, which supported covert operations throughout Indochina during the Vietnam War (also known as the &quot;Second Indochina War&quot;), particularly in Laos. For further information see .

===Post Vietnam War===
After pulling out of South Vietnam in 1975, there was an attempt to keep a company presence in Thailand. After this fell through, Air America officially disbanded on June 30, 1976.

==Civil operations==

CAT started to operate scheduled passenger services, beginning with international flights to Hong Kong, then to Japan, South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand, as well as domestic routes within Taiwan. The granddaughter of Sun Yatsen, Nora Sun, became the youngest flight attendant to work for CAT.

The first flights were carried out with C-46, then C-54 Skymaster aircraft. In 1958, CAT inaugurated DC-6B services. In 1961, CAT started to operate a Convair 880M, becoming the first airline to operate pure jet scheduled passenger services on regional routes in the Far East. The Convair 880M was replaced by a Boeing 727 in January 1968. On 16 February 1968 the 727, flying from Hong Kong to Taipei, crashed near Linkou in northern Taiwan, ending 23 years of operations. The remnants of the cargo operation became Flying Tiger. Flying Tiger International merged to FedEx.

Buford, the first American combat casualties in Vietnam. The aircraft was delivering an artillery piece to French troops at Dien Bien Phu when it was struck by Vietminh ground fire; one engine was lost to flak. The pilot managed to fly the aircraft 75 miles south into Laos and radioed another C-119 pilot for help in finding level ground. The crippled C-119 could hold out no longer, and it cartwheeled and crashed into a hillside near the Sang Ma River in Houaphanh Province. McGovern&#x27;s remains were located in 2002 and identified in 2006.

<doc id="852184" wikidata="Q5518866" url="?curid=852184" title="Gallant Unit Citation">
<text>The Gallant Unit Citation (GUC), a United States Air Force and United States Space Force unit award, was approved in March 2004 and is awarded to any Air Force or Space Force unit which distinguishes itself by extraordinary heroism while engaged in armed combat with an enemy force on or after 11 September 2001.

==Award Description==
The GUC requires a lesser degree of gallantry, determination and esprit de corps than that required for the Presidential Unit Citation (PUC). The unit must have performed with marked distinction under difficult and hazardous conditions in accomplishing its mission so as to set it apart from and above other units participating in the same conflict. The degree of heroism required is the same as that which would warrant award of the Silver Star to an individual. The GUC will normally be earned by units that have participated in single or successive actions covering relatively brief time spans. Only on rare occasions will a unit larger than a group qualify for the GUC. Extended periods of combat duty or participation in a large number of operational missions, either air or ground, is not sufficient. Additional awards of the Gallant Unit Citation are denoted by oak leaf clusters.

==Cited units==
The only units to date that have received this award are the 621st Contingency Response Wing, 385th Air Expeditionary Group,352d Special Operations Group, the 332d Air Expeditionary Group, the 16th Operations Group (redesignated as the 1st Special Operations Group in 2006), the 720th Special Tactics Group, 74th Fighter Squadron and the 79th Fighter Generation Squadron, as well as units subordinate to each during the cited time frame.

<doc id="852187" wikidata="Q2074084" url="?curid=852187" title="Expat (software)">
<text>Expat is a stream-oriented XML 1.0 parser library, written in C, more precisely C99. As one of the first available open-source XML parsers, Expat has found a place in many open-source projects. Such projects include the Apache HTTP Server, Mozilla, Perl, Python and PHP. It is also bound in many other languages.

== Naming ==
According to the original creator, the name Expat came from the fact that he was an expat at the time. The &quot;ex&quot; and the &quot;pa&quot; are for XML and parsing.

== Timeline ==
Software developer James Clark released version 1.0 in 1998 while serving as technical lead on the XML Working Group at the World Wide Web Consortium. Clark released two more versions, 1.1 and 1.2, before turning the project over to a group led by Clark Cooper and Fred Drake in 2000. The new group released version 1.95.0 in September 2000 and continues to release new versions to incorporate bug fixes and enhancements.

== Availability ==
GitHub hosts the Expat project. Versions exist for most major operating-systems.

== Deployment ==
To use the Expat library, programs first register handler functions with Expat. When Expat parses an XML document, it calls the registered handlers as it finds relevant tokens in the input stream. These tokens and their associated handler calls are called &quot;events&quot;. Typically, programs register handler functions for XML element start or stop events and character events. Expat provides facilities for more sophisticated event handling such as XML Namespace declarations, processing instructions and DTD events.

Expat&#x27;s parsing events resemble the events defined in the Simple API for XML (SAX), but Expat is not a SAX-compliant parser. Projects incorporating the Expat library often build SAX and possibly DOM parsers on top of Expat. While Expat is mainly a stream-based (push) parser, it supports stopping and restarting parsing at arbitrary times, thus making the implementation of a &quot;pull&quot; parser relatively easy as well.

<text>The Local Government Act 1972 (c. 70) is an act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that reformed local government in England and Wales on 1 April 1974. It was one of the most significant acts of Parliament to be passed by the Heath Government of 1970–74.

The act took the total number of councils in England from 1,245 to 412 (excluding parish councils), and in Wales to 45. Its pattern of two-tier metropolitan and non-metropolitan county and district councils remains in use today in large parts of England, although the metropolitan county councils were abolished in 1986, and both county and district councils have been replaced with unitary authorities in many areas since the 1990s. In Wales, too, the Act established a similar pattern of counties and districts, but these have since been entirely replaced with a system of unitary authorities. 

Elections were held to the new authorities in 1973, and they acted as &quot;shadow authorities&quot; until the handover date. Elections to county councils were held on 12 April, for metropolitan and Welsh districts on 10 May, and for non-metropolitan district councils on 7 June.

==England==
===Background===
Elected county councils had been established in England and Wales for the first time in 1888, covering areas known as administrative counties. Some large towns, known as county boroughs, were politically independent from the counties in which they were physically situated. The county areas were two-tier, with many municipal boroughs, urban districts and rural districts within them, each with its own council.

Apart from the creation of new county boroughs, the most significant change since 1899 (and the establishment of metropolitan boroughs in the County of London) had been the establishment in 1965 of Greater London and its 32 London boroughs, covering a much larger area than the previous county of London. A Local Government Commission for England was set up in 1958 to review local government arrangements throughout the country, and made some changes, such as merging two pairs of small administrative counties to form Huntingdon and Peterborough and Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely, and creating several contiguous county boroughs in the Black Country. Most of the commission&#x27;s recommendations, such as its proposals to abolish Rutland or to reorganise Tyneside, were ignored in favour of the status quo.

It was generally agreed that there were significant problems with the structure of local government. Despite mergers, there was still a proliferation of small district councils in rural areas, and in the major conurbations the borders had been set before the pattern of urban development had become clear. For example, in the area that was to become the seven boroughs of the metropolitan county of West Midlands, local government was split between three administrative counties (Staffordshire, Warwickshire, and Worcestershire), and eight county boroughs (Birmingham, Coventry, Dudley, Solihull, Walsall, Warley, West Bromwich, and Wolverhampton). Many county boundaries reflected traditions of the Middle Ages or even earlier; industrialisation had created new and very large urban areas like the West Midlands, Liverpool and Manchester which spanned traditional county boundaries and were now often bigger than and far from their traditional county towns.

The Local Government Commission was wound up in 1966, and replaced with a Royal Commission (known as the Redcliffe-Maud commission). In 1969 it recommended a system of single-tier unitary authorities for the whole of England, apart from three metropolitan areas of Merseyside, SELNEC (South East Lancashire and North East Cheshire, now known as Greater Manchester) and West Midlands (Birmingham and the Black Country), which were to have both a metropolitan council and district councils.

This report was accepted by the Labour Party government of the time despite considerable opposition, but the Conservative Party won the June 1970 general election on a manifesto that committed it to a two-tier structure. The new government made Peter Walker and Graham Page the ministers, and quickly dropped the Redcliffe-Maud report. They invited comments from interested parties regarding the previous government&#x27;s proposals.

The Association of Municipal Corporations, an advocacy group representing the boroughs, responded to Redcliffe-Maud by putting forward a scheme where England outside London would be divided into 13 provinces, with 132 main authorities below that. The AMC argued that the Redcliffe-Maud units would be too far removed from the people they served, and suggested units that in some places were much smaller in size. &quot;The Times&quot; gave the example of Kent, which under Redcliffe-Maud would have consisted of two unitary authorities, the smaller having a population of 499,000 (as of 1968), while the AMC proposal would divide the same area into seven local authorities, ranging in population from 161,000 to 306,000.

===White paper and bill===

The incoming government&#x27;s proposals for England were presented in a white paper published in February 1971. The white paper substantially trimmed the metropolitan areas, and proposed a two-tier structure for the rest of the country. Many of the new boundaries proposed by the Redcliffe-Maud report were retained in the white paper. The proposals were in large part based on ideas of the County Councils Association, the Urban District Councils Association and the Rural District Councils Association.

The white paper outlined principles, including an acceptance of the minimum population of 250,000 for education authorities in the Redcliffe-Maud report, and its findings that the division of functions between town and country had been harmful, but that some functions were better performed by smaller units. The white paper set out the proposed division of functions between districts and counties, and also suggested a minimum population of 40,000 for districts. The government aimed to introduce a bill in the 1971/72 session of Parliament for elections in 1973, so that the new authorities could start exercising full powers on 1 April 1974. The white paper made no commitments on regional or provincial government, since the Conservative government preferred to wait for the Crowther Commission to report.

The proposals were substantially changed with the introduction of the bill into Parliament in November 1971:

*Area 4 (Cleveland) would have had a border with area 2 (Tyne and Wear), cutting area 3 (Durham) off from the coast. Seaham and Easington were to be part of the Sunderland district.
*Humberside did not exist in the White Paper. The East Riding was split between area 5 (North Yorkshire) and an area 8 (East Yorkshire). Grimsby and Northern Lindsey were to be part of area 22 (Lincolnshire).
*Harrogate and Knaresborough had been included in district 6b (Leeds)
*Dronfield in Derbyshire had been included in district 7c (Sheffield)
*Area 9 (Cumbria) did not at this stage include the Sedbergh Rural District from Yorkshire
*Area 10 (Lancashire) included more parishes from the West Riding of Yorkshire than were eventually included
*Area 11 (Merseyside) did not include Southport, but did include Ellesmere Port and Neston
*Area 12 (Greater Manchester) lost New Mills and Whaley Bridge (to be with Stockport), and Glossop (to be in Tameside)
*The Seisdon Rural District, which formed a narrow peninsula of Staffordshire running between Shropshire and the Black Country county boroughs, would originally have been split three ways, between the Wolverhampton district (15a), area 16 (Shropshire) and area 17 (Worcestershire)
*Halesowen would have become part of district 15d (Sandwell) rather than 15c (Dudley)
*District 15f (Solihull) would have included part of the Birmingham county borough as well as parishes from Stratford on Avon Rural District
*Area 18 (Warwickshire) would have included several parishes from Daventry Rural District in Northamptonshire
*Area 20 (Nottinghamshire) would include Long Eaton from Derbyshire
*Area 26 (Avon) to have covered a larger area, including Frome
*Area 31 (Norfolk) to have covered a large area of East Suffolk, including Beccles, Bungay, Halesworth, Lowestoft, Southwold, Lothingland Rural District, and Wainford Rural District
*Area 33 (Oxfordshire) to include Brackley and Brackley Rural District from Northamptonshire
*Area 39 (Berkshire) to include Henley-on-Thames and Henley Rural District from Oxfordshire
*Area 40 (Surrey) to include Aldershot, Farnborough, Fleet and area from Hampshire

The bill as introduced also included two new major changes based on the concept of unifying estuaries, through the creation of the county of Humberside on the Humber Estuary, and the inclusion of Harwich and Colchester in Suffolk to unify the Stour Estuary. The latter was removed from the bill before it became law. Proposals from Plymouth for a Tamarside county were rejected. The Bill also provided names for the new counties for the first time.

The main amendments made to the areas during the bill&#x27;s passage through Parliament were:

*renaming of Malvernshire to Hereford and Worcester (the name &quot;Wyvern&quot; was also suggested)
*renaming of Teesside to Cleveland, exclusion of Whitby
*renaming of Tyneside to Tyne and Wear
*removal of Seaham from Tyne and Wear, keeping it in County Durham
*removal of Skelmersdale and Holland from Merseyside – they were to be part of the independent district of Southport, before Southport was included within Merseyside
*exclusion of Colchester and area from Suffolk, kept in Essex
*exclusion of Newmarket and Haverhill from Cambridgeshire, kept in Suffolk (despite protests of Newmarket UDC, which was happy to see the town transferred to Cambridgeshire)
*keeping the Isle of Wight independent of Hampshire
*adding part of Lothingland Rural District from Suffolk to Norfolk.

In the bill as published, the Dorset/Hampshire border was between Christchurch and Lymington. On 6 July 1972, a government amendment added Lymington to Dorset, which would have had the effect of having the entire Bournemouth conurbation in one county (although the town in Lymington itself does not form part of the built-up area, the borough was large and contained villages which do). The House of Lords reversed this amendment in September, with the government losing the division 81 to 65. In October, the government brought up this issue again, proposing an amendment to put the western part of Lymington borough in Dorset. The amendment was withdrawn.

The government lost divisions in the House of Lords at Report Stage on the exclusion of Wilmslow and Poynton from Greater Manchester and their retention in Cheshire, and also on whether Rothwell should form part of the Leeds or Wakefield districts. (Rothwell had been planned for Wakefield, but an amendment at report stage was proposed by local MP Albert Roberts and accepted by the government, then overturned by the Lords.) Instead, the Wakefield district gained the town of Ossett, which was originally placed in the Kirklees district, following an appeal by Ossett Labour Party.

The government barely won a division in the Lords on the inclusion of Weston-super-Mare in Avon, by 42 to 41.

Two more metropolitan districts were created than were originally in the bill:
*Rochdale and Bury were originally planned to form a single district (dubbed &quot;Botchdale&quot; by local MP Michael Fidler); Rochdale took Middleton from Oldham in compensation.
*Knowsley was not originally planned, and was formed from the western part of the planned St Helens district.

As passed, the act would have included Charlwood and Horley in West Sussex, along with Gatwick Airport. This was reversed by the Charlwood and Horley Act 1974, passed just before the act came into force. Charlwood was made part of the Mole Valley district and Horley part of Reigate and Banstead. Gatwick Airport was still transferred.

Although willing to compromise on exact boundaries, the government stood firm on the existence or abolition of county councils. The Isle of Wight (originally scheduled to be merged back into Hampshire as a district) was the only local campaign to succeed, and also the only county council in England to violate the 250,000 minimum for education authorities. The government bowed to local demand for the island to retain its status in October 1972, moving an amendment in the Lords to remove it from Hampshire, Lord Sanford noting that &quot;nowhere else is faced with problems of communication with its neighbours which are in any way comparable&quot;.

Protests from Rutland and Herefordshire failed, although Rutland was able to secure its treatment as a single district despite not meeting the stated minimum population of 40,000 for districts. Several metropolitan boroughs fell under the 250,000 limit, including three of Tyne and Wear&#x27;s five boroughs (North Tyneside, South Tyneside and Gateshead), and the four metropolitan boroughs that had resulted from the splitting of the proposed Bury/Rochdale and Knowsley/St Helens boroughs.

==Wales==
The background of the act was substantially different in Wales. The Redcliffe-Maud Commission had not considered Wales, which had been the subject of the Welsh Office proposals in the 1960s. A white paper was published in 1967 on the subject of Wales, based on the findings of the 1962 report of the Local Government Commission for Wales. The white paper proposed five counties, and thirty-six districts. The county boroughs of Swansea, Cardiff and Newport would be retained, but the small county borough of Merthyr Tydfil would become a district. The proposed counties were as follows

*Dyfed – West Wales – Cardiganshire, Carmarthenshire, Pembrokeshire
*Glamorgan – South Wales
*Gwent – South-East Wales – Monmouthshire (also including Rhymney valley from Glamorgan)
*Gwynedd – North Wales – Anglesey, Caernarvonshire, Denbighshire, Flintshire, Merionethshire
*Powys – Mid Wales – Montgomeryshire, Radnorshire, Breconshire

Implementation of reform in Wales was not immediate, pending decisions on the situation in England, and a new Secretary of State, George Thomas, announced changes to the proposals in November 1968. The large northern county of Gwynedd was to be split to form two counties (creating Gwynedd in the west and Clwyd in the east) with various alterations to the districts. The Redcliffe-Maud report led to a reconsideration of the plans, especially with respect to Glamorgan and Monmouthshire, and a March 1970 White Paper proposed three unitary authorities for South Wales, based on Cardiff, Swansea and Newport.

After the 1970 general election, the new Conservative government published a Consultative Document in February 1971, at the same time as the English White Paper. The proposals were similar to the Labour proposals of 1968, except that the county boroughs were instead two-tier districts, and that Glamorgan was to be subdivided into West Glamorgan and East Glamorgan, making 7 counties and 36 districts.

In the bill as introduced Glamorgan had been split into three authorities: with East Glamorgan further subdivided into a Mid Glamorgan covering the valleys and South Glamorgan. The decision to split East Glamorgan further left South Glamorgan with only two districts (one of which was the Conservative-controlled Cardiff, who had requested the split) and Mid Glamorgan one of the poorest areas in the country. The Labour-controlled Glamorgan County Council strongly opposed this move, placing adverts in newspapers calling for Glamorgan to be saved from a &quot;carve up&quot;, and demanding that the east/west split be retained. The resulting South Glamorgan was the only Welsh county council the Conservatives ever controlled (from 1977 to 1981).

One of the effects of the act was to confirm the area of Monmouthshire as part of Wales. Ambiguity as to the status of Monmouthshire had been introduced by legislation in the 16th and 17th centuries, and by the gradual cultural anglicisation of some eastern parts of the county. By the late 19th century the area was often treated in legislation as one with Wales, using the terminology &quot;Wales and Monmouthshire&quot;, although it remained legally part of England.

Apart from the new Glamorgan authorities, all the names of the new Welsh counties were in the Welsh language, with no English equivalent. With the exception of Clwyd (which was named after the River Clwyd) the names of the counties were taken from ancient British kingdoms. Welsh names were also used for many of the Welsh districts. There were no metropolitan counties and, unlike in England, the Secretary of State could not create future metropolitan counties there under the act.

==Act==

After much comment, the proposals were introduced as the Local Government Bill into Parliament soon after the start of the 1971–1972 session.

In the Commons it passed through Standing Committee D, who debated it in 51 sittings from 25 November 1971 to 20 March 1972.

The act abolished previous existing local government structures, and created a two-tier system of counties and districts everywhere. Some of the new counties were designated metropolitan counties, containing metropolitan boroughs instead. The allocation of functions differed between the metropolitan and the non-metropolitan areas (the so-called &quot;shire counties&quot;) – for example, education and social services were the responsibility of the shire counties, but in metropolitan areas was given to the districts. The distribution of powers was slightly different in Wales than in England, with libraries being a county responsibility in England—but in Wales districts could opt to become library authorities themselves. One key principle was that education authorities (non-metropolitan counties and metropolitan districts) were deemed to need a population base of 250,000 in order to be viable.

Although called two-tier, the system was really three-tier, as it retained civil parish councils, although in Wales they were renamed community councils. Within districts some inconsistency prevailed. For example, in Welwyn Hatfield District in Hertfordshire, which comprised Welwyn Garden City, Hatfield and Old Welwyn, Hatfield retained a civil parish council, its &#x27;town council&#x27; which could act alone in some matters such as town twinning, whereas Welwyn Garden City did not and therefore had no separate representation.

The act introduced &#x27;agency&#x27;, where one local authority (usually a district) could act as an agent for another authority. For example, since road maintenance was split depending upon the type of road, both types of council had to retain engineering departments. A county council could delegate its road maintenance to the district council if it was confident that the district was competent. Some powers were specifically excluded from agency, such as education.

The act abolished various historic relics such as aldermen. The office previously known as sheriff was retitled high sheriff. Many existing boroughs that were too small to constitute a district, but too large to constitute a civil parish, were given charter trustees.

Most provisions of the act came into force at midnight on 1 April 1974. Elections to the new councils had already been held, in 1973, and the new authorities were already up and running as &quot;shadow authorities&quot;, following the example set by the London Government Act 1963.

==New local government areas==

The act specified the composition and names of the English and Welsh counties, and the composition of the metropolitan and Welsh districts. It did not specify any names of districts, nor indeed the borders of the non-metropolitan districts in England – these were specified by Statutory Instrument after the passing of the Act. A Boundary Commission, provided for in the Act, had already begun work on dividing England into districts whilst the bill was still going through Parliament.

In England there were 45 counties and 332 districts (excluding Greater London and the Isles of Scilly), in Wales there were 8 and 37. Six of the English counties were designated as metropolitan counties. The new English counties were based clearly on the traditional ones, albeit with several substantial changes. The thirteen historic counties of Wales were abandoned entirely for administrative purposes and eight new ones instituted.

The act substituted the new counties &quot;for counties of any other description&quot; for purposes of law. This realigned the boundaries of ceremonial and judicial counties used for lieutenancy, custodes rotulorum, shrievalty, commissions of the peace and magistrates&#x27; courts to the metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties. The Act also extended the rights of the Duchy of Lancaster to appoint Lord-Lieutenants for the shrunken Lancashire along with all of Greater Manchester and Merseyside.

Before the passing of the act, there were a total of 1,210 councils in England (excluding Greater London councils and the Isles of Scilly). This was made up of 1,086 rural and urban districts (including non-county boroughs), 79 county boroughs and 45 counties. The act reduced the total number of councils outside Greater London and the Isles of Scilly to 377 (45 counties and 332 districts). Most of the new districts were groups of the whole areas of former districts, although 64 rural districts were split between new districts, and there were eleven urban districts or boroughs which saw their territory split between new districts: Teesside County Borough, Whitley Bay Municipal Borough, Ashton-in-Makerfield Urban District, Billinge and Winstanley Urban District, Golborne Urban District, Lakes Urban District, Queensbury and Shelf Urban District, Ramsbottom Urban District, Seaton Valley Urban District, Thurrock Urban District, and Turton Urban District.

====Metropolitan districts====

==== Non-metropolitan counties ====

====Non-metropolitan districts====

A list of non-metropolitan districts can be found at List of English districts. The Local Government Boundary Commission originally proposed 278 non-metropolitan districts in April 1972 (still working with the county boundaries found in the Bill). A further eighteen districts were added in the final proposals of November 1972, which were then ordered.

The splits were as follows (in most cases the splits were not exact, and many other changes to the borders of the districts took place at this time)

*Devon: Torridge/North Devon
*Dorset : Weymouth and Portland/Purbeck, North Dorset/East Dorset
*Durham : Wear Valley/Teesdale
*Hereford and Worcester : Hereford/South Herefordshire/Leominster
*Humberside: Holderness/North Wolds
*Isle of Wight: South Wight/Medina
*Lancashire: Hyndburn/Rossendale
*Leicestershire : Rutland/Melton, Harborough/Oadby and Wigston
*Lincolnshire: Boston/South Holland
*Northamptonshire: Daventry/South Northamptonshire
*Northumberland : Berwick-upon-Tweed/Alnwick
*Shropshire : Oswestry/North Shropshire, Bridgnorth/South Shropshire
*Somerset: Taunton Deane/West Somerset
*Suffolk: Forest Heath

The new district in Suffolk was necessitated by the decision to keep Newmarket in Suffolk; which would otherwise have become part of the East Cambridgeshire district.

====Isles of Scilly====
Section 265 of the Act allowed for the continuation of the local government arrangements for the Isles of Scilly. The Isles of Scilly Rural District Council became the Council of the Isles of Scilly, and certain services were to continue to be provided by Cornwall County Council as provided by order made by the Secretary of State, although the Isles were not technically in Cornwall before or after 1974.

==Elections==
Elections to the new authorities were held on three different Thursdays in 1973. Each new county and district was divided into electoral divisions, known as wards in the districts. For county councils, each electoral division elected one member; for metropolitan district councils, each ward elected three members; and wards in non-metropolitan districts could elect a varying number of members. There was not sufficient time to conduct a full warding arrangement so a temporary system was used: in some county councils electoral divisions elected multiple councillors.

County councils were set on a four-year cycle of elections of all members, and the next elections were in 1977. Metropolitan district councils elected one councillor for each seat in the three other years, starting in 1975. Non-metropolitan districts had a general election again in 1976, and could subsequently either conduct elections of the whole council or by-thirds. Schedule 3 provided that for each metropolitan ward, the councillor for who obtained the fewest votes in the 1973 election would retire in 1975, the next fewest in 1976, and the others in 1978, setting up the cycle. If equal numbers of votes were obtained, or ward elections in 1973 had been uncontested, the decision would be made by lot.

==Division of functions==
Health care and water supply / sanitation were assigned to new, separate, non-elected authorities.

The remaining functions previously exercised by local authorities were distributed broadly as follows:

In many areas both authorities had some powers, and certain Welsh districts were allowed greater powers by the Secretary of State.

==Reaction==
The system established by the Act was the object of some criticism. One major controversy was the failure to reform local government finance. Having lost office at the general election of February 1974, Graham Page, the minister who had piloted the Act through Parliament, condemned the existing system of rates and grants. His successor as Minister for the Environment, Tony Crosland said that he would be re-examining the rates system, while the Association of Metropolitan Authorities sought the establishment of a royal commission to consider the matter.

The two-tier structure established was also seen as problematic. In particular, the division of planning between districts and counties was a source of friction between the new councils. Thamesdown Borough Council called for a further reform and complete abolition of counties as they felt Wiltshire County Council was unable to respond to the needs of an expanding urban area. Further complaints surrounded the loss of water supply and sewerage powers to regional water authorities created by the Water Act 1973. This was felt to reduce the ability of district councils to plan new housing developments. It was also felt that the boundaries of the metropolitan counties were too tightly drawn, leaving out much of the suburban areas of the conurbations. The leading article in &quot;The Times&quot; on the day the Act came into effect noted that the &quot;new arrangement is a compromise which seeks to reconcile familiar geography which commands a certain amount of affection and loyalty, with the scale of operations on which modern planning methods can work effectively&quot;.

There was some criticism of county boundary changes. A campaign was mounted to return the Uffington White Horse to Berkshire, and a bonfire was lit at the site by protestors as the Act came into effect. The campaigners claimed 10,000 signatures in favour of diverting the county boundary to include the &quot;Berkshire White Horse&quot;. The calls were rejected by the local MP, Airey Neave, who pointed out that the horse predated county boundaries, and by the chairman of the Vale of White Horse District Council. Professor Anthony Fletcher, of the Department of Medieval History of the University of Sheffield, suggested that the new councils place signs at the boundaries of ancient counties. The removal of Gatwick Airport and the surrounding area from Surrey into West Sussex met some fierce local opposition with the result that the parishes of Horley and Charlwood were subsequently returned to Surrey in the eponymous Charlwood and Horley Act 1974, leaving the airport to stay in West Sussex.

Some of the reaction against the Act was motivated by opposition to loss of local control. The county borough councils regretted the loss of their independent status. Criticism of the Act also centred on the size of the new districts. The new Minister, whose party had opposed the reforms in opposition, hoped that &quot;it will be more efficient – but it could easily become more remote&quot;. In order to combat this, Crosland was considering the creation of &quot;neighbourhood councils&quot; in unparished areas of the new districts. The names of some of the new authorities also caused controversy. At no point were local populations consulted about the changes.

The two arguably most loathed new counties created were Humberside and Avon. Humberside united the north and south banks of the River Humber – in theory at least promoting cooperation of the ports of Kingston-upon-Hull, Grimsby and Immingham – carving territory out of the East Riding of Yorkshire and of northern Lindsey respectively. Avon lumped Bristol, formerly a county borough within Gloucestershire, together with Bath, a former county borough in Somerset. Both these creations were to disappear in further local government reforms in the 1990s.

==Amendment and adaptation==
The system established by the Act was not to last. In England a series of incremental measures amended it. First, the county councils of the metropolitan counties, as well as the Greater London Council, were abolished in 1986 by Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government with the Local Government Act 1985, effectively re-establishing county borough status for the metropolitan boroughs. Second, a review of local government outside the metropolitan counties was announced in 1989. The local government reform in the 1990s led to the creation of many new unitary authorities, and the complete abolition of Avon, Cleveland, Hereford and Worcester and Humberside. Names such as Herefordshire and the East Riding of Yorkshire reappeared as local government entities, although often with new boundaries. Several former county boroughs such as Derby, Leicester and Stoke-on-Trent regained unitary status. Additionally, another wave of unitary authorities was formed in 2009.

In Wales there was a more radical change in policy with the two-tier system entirely abolished in 1996, and replaced with the current principal areas of Wales. The 1974 counties in Wales have been retained as preserved counties for various purposes, notably as ceremonial counties, albeit with substantive border revisions.

<text>Natasha is a macaque at the Safari Park zoo near Tel Aviv, Israel. She has become well known because, unlike other macaques who move by alternating between walking upright and on all four limbs, Natasha has walked upright all the time since suffering from a stomach flu that almost killed her.

She recovered after receiving intensive-care treatment, and while her other behaviour remained normal, she began walking erect solely on her hind legs, which gained her immediate media attention; the &quot;Maariv&quot; daily newspaper showed a picture of her striding through the grass, with the tongue-in-cheek caption &quot;The Missing Link?&quot;. 

The zoo&#x27;s veterinarian, Yigal Horowitz, remarked: &quot;I&#x27;ve never seen or heard of this before... One possible explanation is brain damage from the illness.&quot;

<text>Batesville Casket Company manufactures caskets and cremation urns. The company was a subsidiary of Hillenbrand, Inc. until its divestiture in 2023 and is headquartered in Batesville, Indiana.

The company operates three manufacturing plants in Batesville, Indiana, Chihuahua, Mexico, and Manchester, Tennessee, and a woodworking factory in Vicksburg, Mississippi, that supplies wood to the factory in Chihuahua.

The company was established in 1884, when John A. Hillenbrand began producing handmade wooden caskets. These caskets had ornate carvings made by casket and furniture companies. In 1906, Hillenbrand purchased the failing Batesville Coffin Company, and renamed it to Batesville Casket Company.

The company&#x27;s successful business strategy was noted by George Stalk, a Boston Consulting Group writer, in 2004:

<text>L.A. Live is an entertainment complex in the South Park District of downtown Los Angeles, California. It is adjacent to the Crypto.com Arena and the Los Angeles Convention Center.

L.A. Live was developed by Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG) (which Anschutz is based in and L.A. Live is the flagship of), Wachovia Corp, Azteca Corp, investment firm MacFarlane Partners, and with tax deferments paid by Los Angeles taxpayers. It cost approximately to build.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nokia/AEG&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural firm responsible for the master plan and phase two buildings was Baltimore-based RTKL Associates.

With the adjoining Los Angeles Convention Center and Crypto.com Arena, LA Live will be part of the &quot;Downtown Sports Park&quot; cluster for the upcoming 2028 Summer Olympics being held in Los Angeles.

==Timeline==
Initial construction at L.A. Live began in September 2005. The first phase opened in October 2007 and contained Microsoft Theatre, the Xbox Plaza, a retail plaza, as well as an underground parking garage, holding a fraction of the project&#x27;s expected total of 4,000 parking spaces.

L.A. Live was initially decried by architects as not being openly pleasing to the neighborhood streets and a metal looking fortress when it opened. The designer of the project, the architect Nate Cherry of CallisonRTKL, wanted to create narrow walkways to lure visitors into the plaza from the street, thus creating alleyways lined with restaurants, similar to a European style public plaza.

L.A. Live brought in a renaissance to the neighborhood surrounding Crypto.com Arena and billions in economic activity to downtown Los Angeles. Through the years, the success of LA LIVE! has created mirrored versions or renovations of districts adjacent to sports venues, including TEXAS LIVE in Arlington, Texas, KEMBA Live! at the Arena District in Columbus, Ohio, Kansas City Live! in Kansas City, Missouri, Titletown District in Green Bay, Wisconsin, Patriot Place outside of Gillette Stadium in Massachusetts, and the American Dream Meadowlands near Meadowlands Stadium in New Jersey.

===Explored expansion===
In 2020, AEG proposed a $1.2-billion public-private partnership that would add as much as 700,000 square feet to the convention center, which AEG operates, and a $700-million, 861-room addition to the JW Marriott hotel. Plans were approved in 2022. Three years of construction is scheduled.

For a time prior to the return of the Los Angeles Rams in 2016, plans were being developed for the NFL to return to Los Angeles with a new stadium on the campus, to be called Farmers Field. The Los Angeles City Council approved a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) with AEG in a 12–0 vote on August 9, 2011. AEG abandoned the project in March 2015, after the three most likely NFL teams all proposed their own stadium plans in the event they were to relocate to Los Angeles.

==Features==
L.A. Live has of ballrooms, bars, concert theatres, restaurants, movie theaters, and a 54-story hotel and condominium tower on a site. The complex became home to AEG and the Herbalife headquarters in 2008.

===Event Deck===
The west outdoor parking garage, the top-level roof is used as event space, called &quot;Event Deck&quot;. The 90,000 square foot roof has no obstruction pilers and can easily accommodate large-scale tents and platforms. It was used for the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards and the 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards during the COVID-19 pandemic as they could accommodate an indoor and outdoor setting for safety protocol. Also used for the world premiers of the Hunger Games franchise and other Hollywood afterparties. The event space can hold up to 5,000 guests.

===Peacock Place===
Peacock Place (formerly Nokia Plaza, Microsoft Square &amp; Xbox Plaza) is a open-air plaza that serves as the central meeting place for L.A. Live. The Square provides a broadcast venue featuring giant LED screens as well as a red carpet site for special events. Xbox Plaza hosted the first WWE SummerSlam Axxess event on the weekend beginning August 22, 2009, leading up to the 2009 SummerSlam event on August 23 at Staples Center. On June 24, 2010, the Square was the location for the official red carpet premiere of &quot;The Twilight Saga: Eclipse&quot; among other world premieres. The 2022 Major League Baseball All-Star Game red carpet was held at the plaza.

===Peacock Theater and The Novo===

Peacock Theater (previously the Nokia Theatre before June 2015 and Microsoft Theater before July 2023) is a music and theatre venue seating 7,100, and The Novo (previously Club Nokia) is a smaller venue with a seating capacity of 2,300 for live music and cultural events.

The theatre has hosted the ESPY Awards since 2008, as well as the American Music Awards, the Primetime Emmys, the Radio Disney Music Awards, the Billboard Music Awards, and other leading ceremonies serving the entertainment industry. The theater is so commonly used, on March 11, 2008, the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences announced with AEG that the venue would be the home to the Primetime Emmy Awards ceremony from 2008 onward.

The venue has also hosted the finale of the seventh, eighth and ninth seasons of &quot;American Idol&quot;. The 2010 MTV Video Music Awards were held at Microsoft Theater on September 12, 2010.

The first scheduled event held at the Peacock Theatre was a concert featuring the Eagles and the Dixie Chicks on October 18, 2007. Recording artist John Mayer&#x27;s live album &quot;Where the Light Is: John Mayer Live in Los Angeles&quot; was recorded at the Peacock Theatre.

The Peacock Theatre will host weightlifting during the 2028 Summer Olympics and powerlifting during the 2028 Summer Paralympics.

===Grammy Museum===

On May 8, 2007, it was announced that the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences would establish a museum dedicated to the history of the Grammy Awards. The museum opened in December 2008 for the Grammy Awards 50th anniversary. It consists of four floors with historical music artifacts. It has featured a number of exhibits, including the John Lennon Songwriter Exhibit, which was open from October 4, 2010, to March 31, 2011. 
Embedded on the sidewalks at the LA Live streets are bronze disks, similar to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, honoring each year&#x27;s top winners, Record of the Year, Best New Artist, Album of the Year, and Song of the Year.


===Hotels and residences===
The centerpiece of the district is a 54-story, 1,001-room two-hotel hybrid tower, constructed above the parking lot directly north of the Crypto.com Arena. Designed by Gensler and built by Webcor Builders, the skyscraper contains both an 879-room JW Marriott hotel on floors 3–21 and a 123-room Ritz-Carlton hotel on floors 22–26. Floors 27–52 hold 224 &quot;Residences at the Ritz Carlton&quot; condominiums. The tower&#x27;s architectural design evolves from a &quot;geometric pattern of glittering, blue-tinted glass.&quot; Thirty-four different types of glass were installed to create the uniquely patterned facade. Groundbreaking for the tower took place in June 2007. The project was completed in the first quarter of 2010.

In July 2014, Marriott Hotels opened a second two-hotel hybrid tower with 393 rooms just north across Olympic Boulevard with a Marriott Courtyard and a Residence Inn.

===ESPN broadcasting studios===
The second phase of development included a ESPN broadcasting studio, as well as an ESPN Zone restaurant built on the corner of Figueroa Street and Chick Hearn Court. In an effort to expand coverage of West Coast sports, ESPN began broadcasting the 1 AM ET (10 PM PT) edition of SportsCenter from the studio on April 6, 2009. The ESPN Zone restaurant closed in July 2013 and was replaced by Tom&#x27;s Urban 24, Smashburger and Live Basil Pizza restaurants.

===Regal Cinemas===
The $100 million, , Regal Entertainment Group movie complex opened in 2009 and includes 14 screens and 3,772 seats. It includes a three-story art-deco-style atrium and an 806-seat theater called the &quot;Regal Premiere House&quot; intended for &quot;lucrative&quot; premieres. The theater complex became the West Coast flagship location for Regal, at the time of its opening, the largest theater chain in the United States. The Michael Jackson film &quot;This Is It&quot; was the opening film at the theater.

===Restaurants===
L.A. Live is also host to a set of mid- to upper-scale dining including Cleo, Fixins Soul Kitchen, Fleming&#x27;s Prime Steakhouse &amp; Wine Bar, Katsuya, Lawry&#x27;s, Lazy Dog, Rock&#x27;N Fish, Sol-Agave Mexican Restaurant, Savoca Italian, Smash Burger, Tom&#x27;s Watch Bar, Wolfgang Puck Bar &amp; Grill, and Yard House.

<text>The Bouvier des Flandres is a herding dog breed originating in Flanders, Belgium. They were originally used for general farm work including cattle droving, sheep herding, and cart pulling, and nowadays as guard dogs and police dogs, as well as being kept as pets.

The French name of the breed means, literally, &quot;Cow Herder of Flanders&quot;, referring to the Flemish origin of the breed. Other names for the breed are &quot;Toucheur de Boeuf&quot; (cattle driver), &quot;Vlaamse Koehond&quot; (Flemish cow dog), and &quot;Vuilbaard&quot; (dirty beard).

==History==
The monks at the Ter Duinen monastery were among the earliest known dog breeders in Flanders. The bouviers bred by them are recorded as having been bred from imports such as Irish wolfhounds and Scottish deerhounds with local farm dogs, until a breed considered to be the predecessor of the modern Bouvier des Flandres was obtained. This became a working dog with the strength and temperament to perform herding, guard cattle, and even pull cargo carts, and to withstand the local weather conditions due to its thick coat. The breed&#x27;s practical use became antiquated after the invention of the automobile, when cattle were more practically transported by trucks.

Historically, the ear cropping and tail docking could have been done for practical reasons, avoiding accidental amputations in the course of work, or to indicate the dog was working stock and not a pet subject to taxation.
Up until the early 20th century, the breed was not completely defined, with three variants: Paret, Moerman or Roeselare, and Briard. Conflict between the proponents of these three variants held the breed&#x27;s development back. In 1912 and 1913, several local kennel clubs recognized standards for Bouviers; however they usually had different standards for the Roeselare and other variants.

World War I nearly caused the breed to disappear, due to the devastation that came over its region of origin and the fact that the dogs were used for military purposes. Indeed, Nic, a male trained as a trench dog who served during the war and was a perennial winner at dog shows after the war, is considered to be the founder of the early Bouvier des Flandres breed.

A unified Bouvier des Flandres standard was created in 1936 by a joint French-Belgian committee. However, World War II again endangered the breed&#x27;s existence. Due to these setbacks, progress was slowed, and it was not until 1965 that the &quot;Fédération Cynologique Internationale&quot; (FCI) breed standard, as agreed to by several minor kennel clubs, was adopted.

==Description==
===Appearance===

The Bouvier is a rough-coated dog of rugged appearance. It gives the impression of size and strength without clumsiness. The head is accentuated by a &quot;heavy beard&quot; and &quot;mustache&quot;. Although the practice of cropping both ears and tail are now mostly cosmetic, tails were originally docked to prevent injuries caused by herding and cart-pulling. The practice of cosmetic docking is currently opposed by the American Veterinary Medical Association.

In the area of origin (Flanders, Belgium) cropping was made illegal in 2006. The weight of males ranges from 80 to 120 pounds or 36 to 54 kilograms, slightly lighter on average for females. They are built with a thick double coat, which can be fawn, black, grey brindle, or &quot;pepper and salt&quot; in color. Bouviers are sometimes considered non-shedding, but still do lose hair, like all dogs. Most of the hair that they lose is caught within the double coat which results in matting. They require weekly brushing and combing to maintain their coat. In addition to weekly brushing, the coat should be trimmed approximately every 3–5 weeks if it is to be a show dog.

===Temperament===

Bouviers des Flandres are gentle, rational, even-tempered, loyal, and protective by nature. The breed&#x27;s particular blend of characteristics makes them good family pets, as well as effective guard dogs. Bouviers are easily trainable watch dogs who learn commands relatively fast. However, Bouviers learn best when repetition is limited. Boredom from repetition can hinder their training and learning ability.

Bouviers possess some sophisticated traits, such as complex intelligence and accountability.

Bouviers should be socialized well, preferably starting at an early age, to avoid shyness, suspiciousness, and being overly reserved with strangers (although the breed is naturally aloof with strangers). Protecting the family when in danger is not something that needs to be taught, nor is it something one can train out of them. They can coexist well with children. Obedience training should start when they are young. They are usually good with other dogs if they are raised with them from puppyhood. Bouviers can be aggressive if the owners are not clear and consistent enough to communicate what is problematic. Bouviers do not fully mature both mentally and physically until around the age of 2–3 years old.

===Activities===
Bouviers des Flandres can compete in dog agility trials, carting, obedience, dog showmanship, Schutzhund, tracking, and herding events. Herding instincts and trainability can be measured at noncompetitive herding tests. Bouviers exhibiting basic herding instincts can then be trained to compete in herding trials.

==Health==
A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 11.3 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

==Notable Bouviers des Flandres==

* Belco, the dog that accompanied Edmee Bowles to America when she fled occupied Belgium and who was the foundation stud of her kennel Clos du Cereberes at Belco Farm in Pennsylvania.
* Soprano de la Thudinie, the post-war foundation stud of Justin Chastel&#x27;s de la Thudinie kennel in Belgium and the most prominent ancestor of the modern type of Bouvier des Flandres.
* Lucky, owned by United States President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan. 
* Patrasche, the dog found by a boy named Nello in &quot;A Dog of Flanders&quot;, is often asserted to be a Bouvier des Flandres.
* Max and his mate Madchen and their puppies, fictional characters featured in W.E.B. Griffin&#x27;s &quot;Presidential Agent&quot; series.
*Isabelle du Monceau de Bergendal, a character within the &quot;Strike Witches&quot; series, has a Bouvier des Flandres as her familiar animal.
*Gretel, a Bouvier des Flandres, is the dog of Dr. Robert Romano on &quot;ER&quot;.
*Kirie, a young female Bouvier, is owned by criminal police officer Gereon Rath, the protagonist of Volker Kutscher&#x27;s series of detective novels set in the 1930s Berlin. Originally belonging to a murdered Belgian actress, Kirie is adopted by Rath in &quot;The Silent Death&quot;, the second novel in the series, and remains his companion until her death in &quot;Olympia&quot;, the eight installment.

<text>Personal and social education (PSE) is a component of the state school curriculum in Scotland and Wales. PSE became a statutory requirement in schools in September 2003, and is compulsory for all students at key stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 (5 to 16 years old), and shares some similar elements with Personal, social, health and economic education and citizenship education in England. These include:
* local and global communities
* sex education
* spirituality
* morals
* environmental issues

==PSE framework==
For each key stage, learning outcomes for knowledge and understanding are set in each of the Aspects (listed below); additionally, learning outcomes for the development of attitudes and values and skills are prescribed across all aspects. ACCAC, the curriculum authority for Wales (part of the Welsh Assembly Government from 1 April 2006), published these in the PSE framework (2000). While it is not compulsory for schools to use the framework, they are expected to use schemes of work in order to standardize practice across teachers and classes.

Aspects:

* Community
* Emotional
* Environmental
* Learning
* Moral
* Physical
* Sexual
* Social
* Spiritual
* Vocational

<doc id="852243" wikidata="Q1503314" url="?curid=852243" title="Michel Vaillant">
<text>Michel Vaillant is a French car racing comics series created in 1957 by French cartoonist Jean Graton and published originally by Le Lombard. Later, Graton published the albums by himself when he founded Graton éditeur in 1982. Michel Vaillant is the main character of the eponymous series, a French racing car driver who competes mainly in Formula One.

The feature first appeared in &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine, where Jean Graton had already published a number of short stories about real-life sporting heroes. The series appeared in &quot;Tintin&quot; between 1957 and 1976, in France as well as in Belgium. An estimated 17 million copies of the series&#x27; albums have been sold worldwide.

==Publication history==
On February 7, 1957, Jean Graton created the character Michel Vaillant, with five short stories published in the Franco-Belgian comics magazine &quot;Tintin&quot;, with publication beginning June 12, 1957. With their positive reception, a full-length adventure was written and drawn by Graton, published in &quot;Tintin&quot; in 1959.

The titles were first published in album format by Le Lombard until 1976, then by Dargaud until 1979, by Fleurus in 1979 and 1980, by Novedi in 1981 and 1982, and finally by Graton editeur, created and owned by Philippe and Jean Graton from 1983 on. In 1995, a new series was launched, the &quot;Dossiers Michel Vaillant&quot; series, with stories and information on important figures in motorsports and the automobile industry. In 2000, the &quot;Palmarès Inedit&quot; series was created, with early works and stories previously unpublished in books. In 2007, Studio Graton translated three titles into English: &quot;The Great Challenge&quot; (Tome 1), &quot;China Moon&quot; (Tome 68), &quot;24 Hours Under the Influence&quot; (Tome 70). In 2008, a new collection was launched by Le Lombard, named &quot;Integrale Michel Vaillant&quot;. This series plans to reprint all past adventures in 20 volumes of 200 pages, each volume grouping several stories. All the titles of the original series are to be reprinted, and many comments, dossiers and unpublished strips added.

Jean Graton later left the writing to his son Philippe, gradually leaving the artwork to the Studio Graton, which he established. Since Graton stopped drawing the series himself, the graphic style has evolved, with Philippe Graton continuing with the writing and three artists providing the artwork. Philippe Graton admitted that the draftsmanship isn&#x27;t as rigorous as it once was.

==Series overview==
&quot;Vaillante&quot; is a family-run French business which, in the beginning, was a transporting company. They also create their own trucks and cars and so decide to enter Formula One racing competition. In 1939, Henri Vaillant, a young driver, creates this new team. In the next seventy plus adventures, Michel Vaillant and the Vaillante race team compete in numerous races in Formula One and other driving competitions such as IndyCar, rallying or enduro challenges.

Michel, Henri&#x27;s son, is the main driver, his usual team-mate being the American, Steve Warson. The team is first managed by Henri Vaillant, then by Michel&#x27;s older brother Jean-Pierre. Henri has remained the chairman of the Vaillante firm, but was replaced by Jean-Pierre when he retired.

As the Vaillante firm grows, Vaillante&#x27;s drivers, among them Michel, accumulate victories, but their success is either disrupted by rivals, by internal problems in the Vaillante team or by the &quot;Leader&quot;, the greatest of Vaillante&#x27;s enemies. Most of the adventures deal with motor racing life, but they also deal with the Vaillante team drivers&#x27; private lives, with concerns in the Vaillante firm and with various outside problems.

==Realism==
The comic is notable for depicting real-life motor racing background, featuring many real-life drivers, teams and personalities. Michel Vaillant competes in existing motor races and Grand Prix on real-life circuits. In the course of the series, the background in which the characters are featured evolves: the series&#x27; environment has always been updated, so that cars, teams and personalities have constantly changed.

Graton&#x27;s graphic style also aims at being realistic, as the illustrations are very technically accurate. Notably, Graton is recognized for the meticulous details he provides on cars illustrations. The numerous depictions of cars and circuits featured in the series are very specific and detailed; Graton used to personally attend races and circuits to take notes. Philippe Graton later continued this practice.

Michel Vaillant&#x27;s name is very similar to that of the birth name of automotive pioneer Karl Benz, which was &quot;Karl Friedrich Michael Vaillant&quot;.

Realism is also expressed in the fictional background. Vaillant&#x27;s factories and property are prominently featured in the series. The Vaillante firm is run as a real company, it has financial problems, must launch advertising campaigns and search for sponsors. It owns factories, which employs several engineers and mechanics that are realistically described and is shown employing several real-life drivers.

The Vaillants own the familial domain &quot;La Jonquière&quot;, located a short drive / cycle ride from the factory, and is home throughout the series to Henri and Elisabeth Vaillant. Michel and Jean Pierre lived there in the early books, before striking out on their own.

As the context in which the characters evolved, Michel also is shown getting older. While he looked like a young man of about twenty years at the beginning of his adventures, he is seen progressively reaching middle-age. Recently his appearance is younger than previously. Other fictional characters are also shown getting older. In recent years, their general appearance has become steady. In spite of this he is still depicted as quite young for a man who has competed against drivers of multiple generations, including Juan Manuel Fangio, Graham Hill and Ayrton Senna.

==Characters==
Michel Vaillant is the main character of the series. Michel Vaillant is a complete driver and sportsman. His main occupation is to drive in the Formula 1 Championship. Michel is named world champion in four different albums. He also twice won the Indianapolis 500 and the 24 Hours of Le Mans four times. He also competed in rally races, winning the East African Safari and the Paris-Dakar. He participated in several stock-car, F2, F3 and GT races.

He is also able to drive trucks and motorcycles, and practice football, gymnastics, tennis, judo and skiing very well. As a kind, serious, helpful, attentive, honest and generous man, Michel is very popular. His many abilities, his courage and his values, his kindness and his physical appearance make him a practically perfect hero, without any flaws.

Françoise Vaillant is Michel&#x27;s wife. She first appeared in 1963, as a teenager. At that time, she was a journalist for a newspaper owned by her father Louis Latour, a good friend of Henri Vaillant. In 1966, she appeared again, but as an older, attractive young woman. From that time on, she appeared in every album of the series and saw Vaillant more and more, until his family urged him to marry her. They married in 1974. Françoise has an important role in the series, and in some adventures she is the main character.

Jean-Pierre Vaillant is Michel&#x27;s older brother by six years. Like Michel, he started as a driver for the Vaillante team. He married Agnès de Chanzy, the daughter of Henri Vaillant&#x27;s friend living in Argentina, in the very first album. But rapidly, he became more and more interested in managing the family team and to elaborate strategies for Formula One racing. He soon became the leader of the Vaillante society, replacing his father. Able to make difficult decisions, he also does not hesitate to launch ambitious projects. He has a son, Jean-Michel Vaillant, who is Michel&#x27;s godson.

Steve Warson is an American driver and Michel&#x27;s best friend. He first appeared in the series in 1957. Steve has a different personality than Michel: he smokes, drinks, flirts, fights, and defies other drivers. Despite his several flaws, he is a good driver for the Vaillante team and a faithful teammate to Michel, even if his romantic adventures sometimes caused him to be Vaillante&#x27;s occasional rival. His numerous girlfriends have included Ruth and Julie Wood. As good driver as Michel, he outdoes him in most rallying and American races.

 The &quot;Leader&quot; is a mysterious character who is the worst enemy of Vaillante and owner of the Leader team. The Leader team uses modern and advanced technology to compete against the Vaillante team in motor races. The team resorts to aggressive strategies to win races and uses dangerous drivers, such as Vince Hummer, Bob Cramer, Dan Hawkins, Donald Payntor, Michael Borman, and Jack Moore. The leader was brought up by Buddhist monks. An ambitious and cruel man, he studied a form of Buddhism that gives him amazing powers, which he uses to try to dominate the motor industry. His first appearance was in the album &quot;Mach 1 pour Steve Warson&quot;.

Ruth alias Jo Barett is the Leader&#x27;s daughter and was briefly Steve Warson&#x27;s girlfriend. Before knowing her real origin, Ruth was a kind girl and friendly towards the Vaillante team. She became cruel and mean, taking over as the new Leader at her father&#x27;s death, and tried to avenge him by fighting against his enemies.

Henri Vaillant is Michel and Jean-Pierre&#x27;s father. He began as a mechanic, then became a driver, created his own team and then became chairman of Vaillante. Rather authoritarian, he gave his two children a strict education. Later, he let his son Jean-Pierre take over as the leader and retired. His way of life remains modest, as chairman he went to work on a bicycle. A respectable man, close to his employees, he is very appreciated by them.

Elisabeth Vaillant is Henri Vaillant&#x27;s wife. She married him when he was a simple mechanic, but does not know anything about cars, motor racing, or mechanics.

Julie Wood is an American motorcycle racer and at one time Steve Warson&#x27;s girlfriend. An orphan, she was brought up by her uncle Chris, in California, with her two brothers, Indy and Phil. She is at ease in any kind of motorcycle race. Before her appearance in the Michel Vaillant series (in the album &quot;Paris-Dakar&quot;), she starred in her own series, &quot;Julie Wood&quot;, which ran for eight volumes, from 1976 to 1980.

Yves Douleac is a driver for the Vaillante team. He lost his father, a truck driver for Vaillante at Marseilles, at 7. He was brought up by his mother and he was very admirative of Michel Vaillant, getting to know him personally and being employed as a driver. Courageous and proud, he later fell in love with Gabriele Spangenberg, and succeeded in marrying her despite his modest origin.

Gabriele Spangenberg is a German female driver for the Vaillante team and Yves Douléac&#x27;s girlfriend. Her father, of noble heritage, first opposed such a union, due to Yves&#x27;s poor origin, but later gave his permission, in the face of Gabriele&#x27;s determination.

Bob Cramer is an American driver, Vaillante&#x27;s enemy and a driver for the Leader team along with his friend and partner Dan Hawkins. A drunkard and a brawler, he is also aggressive in motor races where he caused a lot of crashes.

Non-fictional characters
As a driver evolving in the motor racing background, Michel Vaillant competes with many existing drivers, some of whom play an important part in the stories. Pierre Dieudonné appeared in some adventures as a driver for the Vaillante team. Drivers, most notably French and Belgians like Vanina and Jacky Ickx, François Cevert, Patrick Tambay, Thierry Boutsen, René Arnoux, Jean-Pierre Beltoise and Éric Bernard, have made appearances in the storylines.

Gilles Villeneuve and Jacky Ickx are portrayed as good friends of Michel&#x27;s as is Didier Pironi, and are the most recurring drivers of the series. Didier Pironi played an important part in the album: Un pilote a disparu (1980). Non-fictional team managers and journalists also appear regularly, as do some statesmen and celebrities. Michel himself is often seen being interviewed by real-life journalist Gérard &quot;Jabby&quot; Crombac.

==In other media==
In 1967, French TV broadcast a live-action adaptation of the series, Les Aventures de Michel Vaillant. It ran for 13 episodes and featured stories written and filmed around a real-life world sportscar championship, documenting Henri Grandsire driving an Alpine A110, interspersed with dramatic interludes acted by Grandsire himself. Episodes offer rare close-up contemporary footage of races and cars that year at the Rallye Du Nord, Magny Cours, Nürburgring, Monza, Targa Florio, Le Mans, Monaco, Rouen-Les-Essarts, Sebring and Reims.

The series was also adapted into a Michel Vaillant animated series. 65 episodes of 26 minutes were produced in 1990 in France by la Cinq. It was released in the U.S. in 1991-1992 as &quot;Heroes on Hot Wheels&quot;, produced by Jetlag Productions and the former Family Channel, sponsored by Mattel&#x27;s &quot;Hot Wheels&quot; franchise (hence the title) and distributed by France 3 Video and Pacific Media Ventures. Michel&#x27;s name was anglicized to &quot;Michael Valiant&quot;. It was broadcast again in France in 1993 and 1998 by France 2, and sold in more than 30 countries.

A Michel Vaillant film was made in 2003, and the soundtrack to the movie composed by the band Archive was released at the same time.

== In popular culture ==
The series has been influential in the world of auto racing. Some famous Formula One drivers have admitted that their passion for automobile racing originated from reading the &quot;Michel Vaillant&quot; comics series, among them four- time Formula One champion Alain Prost. In 1969, Henry Ford II and Enzo Ferrari personally wished Michel Vaillant a happy 20th birthday. The circuit Zolder, in Belgium, in which several well-known motorsport races take place, have paid tribute to the series, naming the biggest building of the circuit &quot;Michel Vaillant club&quot;.

Many real cars were adapted from automobile designs from the series. Cars bearing the logo Vaillante ran in Le Mans in 1997 and 2003: A Courage in 1997, while in 2003, Vaillante cars have been designed to be used in the Luc Besson&#x27;s movie. Some fans have built a real Vaillante Grand Defi, a model which appeared several times in the comics series. The car has participated in real races, under the brand Vaillante. A model was marketed in Belgium, the Honda Civic Vaillante, of which 50 models have been produced. Automobile designer Luc Donckerwolke (current designer of Lamborghini, previously of SEAT) has drawn his inspiration from cars drawn by Jean Graton to design some real car models. He also designed the SEAT Ibiza Vaillante, exhibited at the Geneva Motor Show in 2006. It was also Luc Donckerwolke who transformed a Lola B98/10–Judd into a Vaillante and a Panoz LMP-1 Roadster-S into a Leader car in 2003 for the Besson movie. Donckerwolke also collaborated with Studio Graton on the latest titles of the series, drawing some cars featured in the albums.

Many commercial products have been derived from the series, among them figurines, collected by automobile fans as well as comics fans. There&#x27;s also a video game featuring Michel Vaillant which has ranked first in the auto racing video games in Benelux, and has been the top download on commercial websites.
In June 2012, Swiss racing driver Alain Menu competed in the World Touring Car Championship Race of Portugal with a Vaillante-themed livery. Menu won the second feature race of the event (round 14) under the name M. Vaillant, even dying his hair and shaving his beard to resemble the look of the character.

In 2017 Rebellion Racing entered the 2017 FIA World Endurance Championship, including the 24 Hours of Le Mans as &quot;Vaillant Rebellion&quot; using Vaillant colours on cars #13 and #31.

== Reception ==

The series is very popular among fans of automobiles, because it features real-life cars, including renowned and prestigious models. The series have fans throughout several countries, though it has not translated into other languages except for English, Dutch, German, Danish, Norwegian (with Michel Vaillant renamed Mark Breton in the two latter), Portuguese, Serbian, Croatian, Finnish and Italian. It has above all fans in France and Belgium, including Dutch-speaking Belgium, given that &quot;Michel Vaillant&quot; albums have been translated into Dutch.

The series has received various tributes as a masterpiece of the bande dessinée genre. A stamp representing Michel Vaillant was published in Belgium, a rare privilege granted only to the greatest comics series&#x27;. It was made available from January 1, 2007 with a face value of 0.50 euros, in all Belgian post offices. Celebrations for the 50th anniversary of the series took place in 2007, among them Strip Turnhout, at the bi-annual official Flanders comics festival, organizing a retrospective exhibition.

The series also ranks high on the collector&#x27;s market, with original editions ranking among the most valuable. Graton&#x27;s original art pages have fetched high prices at auctions. In January 2006, a page from &quot;Le 13 est au départ&quot; was sold for 4,800 euros at an auction in Paris. In April 2006, in Paris again, an original page from &quot;L&#x27;Honneur du Samourai&quot; was auctioned for 12,384 euros (whereas its original value was 3,500 euros), breaking the record of the time. In 2008, an original page from &quot;De l&#x27;huile sur la piste&quot; was sold for 11,520 euros at auction in 2008 at Brussels among other works previously published by &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine, establishing the record sale of that day.

<doc id="852252" wikidata="Q3216180" url="?curid=852252" title="Untouchability">
<text>Untouchability is a form of social institution that legitimises and enforces practices that are discriminatory, humiliating, exclusionary and exploitative against people belonging to certain social groups. Although comparable forms of discrimination are found all over the world, untouchability involving the caste system is largely unique to South Asia.

The term is most commonly associated with treatment of the Dalit communities in the Indian subcontinent who were considered &quot;polluting&quot;. The term has also been used to refer to other groups, including the &quot;Burakumin&quot; of Japan, the Baekjeong of Korea, and the Ragyabpa of Tibet, as well as the Romani people and Cagot in Europe, and the Al-Akhdam in Yemen. Traditionally, the groups characterized as untouchable were those whose occupations and habits of life involved ritually &quot;polluting&quot; activities, such as pursuing a career based on killing (e.g. fishermen) or engaging in common contact with others&#x27; feces or sweat (e.g. manual scavengers, sweepers and washermen).

According to the religious Hindu text, untouchables were not considered a part of the varna system. Therefore, they were not treated like the savarnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras).

Due to many caste-based discriminations in Nepal, the government of Nepal legally abolished the caste-system and criminalized any caste-based discrimination, including &quot;untouchability&quot;, in 1963. 

Untouchability has been outlawed in India, Nepal and Pakistan. However, &quot;untouchability&quot; has not been legally defined. The origin of untouchability and its historicity are still debated. A 2020 study of a sample of households in India concludes that &quot;Notwithstanding the likelihood of under-reporting of the practice of untouchability, 70 percent of the population reported not indulging in this practice. This is an encouraging sign.&quot;

== Origin ==
B. R. Ambedkar, an Indian social reformer and politician who came from a social group that was considered untouchable, theorized that untouchability originated because of the deliberate policy of the Brahmins. According to him, the Brahmanas despised the people who gave up the Brahmanism in favour of Buddhism. Later scholars such as Vivekanand Jha have refuted this theory.

Nripendra Kumar Dutt, a professor of history, theorized that the concept of untouchability originated from the &quot;pariah&quot;-like treatment accorded to the indigenous people of India by the early Dravidians, and that the concept was borrowed by the Indo-Aryans from the Dravidians. Scholars such as R. S. Sharma have rejected this theory, arguing that there is no evidence that Dravidians practised untouchability before coming into contact with the Indo-Aryans.

Austrian ethnologist Christoph von Fürer-Haimendorf theorized that untouchability originated as class stratification in urban areas of the Indus Valley civilisation. According to this theory, the poorer workers involved in &#x27;unclean&#x27; occupations such as sweeping or leather work were historically segregated and banished outside the city limits. Over time, personal cleanliness came to be identified with &quot;purity&quot;, and the concept of untouchability eventually spread to rural areas as well. After the decline of the Indus Valley towns, these untouchables probably spread to other parts of India. Scholars such as Suvira Jaiswal reject this theory, arguing that it lacks evidence, and does not explain why the concept of untouchability is more pronounced in rural areas.

American scholar George L. Hart, based on his interpretation of Old Tamil texts such as &quot;Purananuru&quot;, traced the origin of untouchability to ancient Tamil society. According to him, in this society, certain occupational groups were thought to be involved in controlling the malevolent supernatural forces; as an example, Hart mentions the Paraiyars, who played the drums during battles and solemn events such as births and deaths. People from these occupational groups came to be avoided by others, who believed that they were &quot;dangerous and had the power to pollute the others&quot;. Jaiswal dismisses the evidence produced by Hart as &quot;extremely weak&quot; and contradictory. Jaiswal points out that the authors of the ancient Tamil texts included several Brahmanas (a fact accepted by Hart); thus, the society described in these texts was already under Brahmanical influence, and could have borrowed the concept of untouchability from them.

British anthropologist John Henry Hutton traced the origin of untouchability to the taboo on accepting food cooked by a person from a different caste. This taboo presumably originated because of cleanliness concerns, and ultimately, led to other prejudices such as the taboo on marrying outside one&#x27;s caste. Jaiswal argues that this theory cannot explain how various social groups were isolated as untouchable or accorded a social rank. Jaiswal also notes that several passages from the ancient Vedic texts indicate that there was no taboo against accepting food from people belonging to a different varna or tribe. For example, some Shrauta Sutras mandate that a performer of the Vishvajit sacrifice must live with the Nishadas (a tribe regarded as untouchable in later period) for three days, in their village, and eat their food.

Scholars such as Suvira Jaiswal, R. S. Sharma, and Vivekanand Jha characterize untouchability as a relatively later development after the establishment of the varna and caste system. Jha notes that the earliest Vedic text &quot;Rigveda&quot; makes no mention of untouchability, and even the later Vedic texts, which revile certain groups such as the Chandalas, do not suggest that untouchability existed in the contemporary society. According to Jha, in the later period, several groups began to be characterized as untouchable, a development which reached its peak during 600–1200 AD. Sharma theorizes that institution of untouchability arose when the aboriginal tribes with &quot;low material culture&quot; and &quot;uncertain means of livelihood&quot; came to be regarded as impure by the privileged classes who despised manual labour, and regarded associated impurity with &quot;certain material objects&quot;. According to Jaiswal, when the members of aboriginal groups were assimilated into the Brahmanical society, the privileged among them may have tried to assert their higher status by disassociating themselves from their lower-status counterparts, who were gradually branded as untouchables.

According to the Dharmashastras which are ancient legal codes from various kingdoms in ancient India, certain peoples grouped either by ethnicity or profession were not considered a part of the varna based society. Therefore, they were not treated like the savarnas (Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras).

==Characteristics==

According to Sarah Pinto, an anthropologist, modern untouchability in India applies to people whose work relates to &quot;meat, and bodily fluids&quot;. Based on the punishments prescribed in The Untouchability (Offences) Act, 1955 the following practices could be understood to have been associated with Untouchability in India:
*Prohibition from eating with other members
*Provision of separate cups in village tea stalls
*Separate seating arrangements and utensils in restaurants
*Segregation in seating and food arrangements at village functions and festivals
*Prohibition from entering places of public worship
*Prohibition from wearing sandals or holding umbrellas in front of higher caste members
*Prohibition from entering other caste homes
*Prohibition from using common village paths
*Separate burial/cremation grounds
*Prohibition from accessing common/public properties and resources (wells, ponds, temples, etc.)
*Segregation (separate seating area) of children in schools
*Bonded labour
*Social boycotts by other castes for refusing to perform their &quot;duties&quot;

==Government action in India==
India is home to over 200 million Dalits. At the time of Indian independence, Dalit activists began calling for separate electorates for untouchables in India to allow fair representation. Officially labeled the Minorities Act, it would guarantee representation for Sikhs, Muslims, Christians, and Untouchables in the newly formed Indian government. The Act was supported by British representatives such as Ramsay MacDonald. According to the textbook &quot;Religions in the Modern World&quot;, B. R. Ambedkar, who was also a supporter of the Act, was considered to be the &quot;untouchable leader&quot; who made great efforts to eliminate caste system privileges that included participation in public festivals, access to temples, and wedding rituals. In 1932, Ambedkar proposed that the untouchables create a separate electorate that ultimately led Gandhi to fast until it was rejected.

A separation within Hindu society was opposed by national leaders at the time such as Gandhi, although he took no exception to the demands of the other minorities. He began a hunger strike, citing that such a separation would create an unhealthy divide within the religion. At the Round Table Conferences, he provided this explanation for his reasoning:I don&#x27;t mind untouchables if they so desire, being converted to Islam or Christianity. I should tolerate that, but I cannot possibly tolerate what is in store for Hinduism if there are two divisions set forth in the villages. Those who speak of the political rights of the untouchables don&#x27;t know their India, don&#x27;t know how Indian society is today constituted and therefore I want to say with all the emphasis that I can command that if I was the only person to resist this thing that I would resist it with my life.Gandhi achieved some success through his hunger strike however Dalit activists faced pressure from the Hindu population at large to end his protest at the risk of his ailing health. The two sides eventually came to a compromise where the number of guaranteed seats for Untouchables would be increased at both central and provincial levels, but there would be a common electorate.

The 1950 national constitution of India legally abolished the practice of untouchability and provided measures for affirmative action in both educational institutions and public services for Dalits and other social groups who lie within the caste system. These are supplemented by official bodies such as the National Commission for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

Despite this, instances of prejudice against Dalits still occur in some rural areas, as evidenced by events such as the Kherlanji massacre.

<doc id="852257" wikidata="Q3586385" url="?curid=852257" title="1995 Ontario general election">
<text>The 1995 Ontario general election was held on June 8, 1995, to elect members of the 36th Legislative Assembly of the province of Ontario, Canada. The writs for the election were drawn up on April 28, 1995.

The governing New Democratic Party, led by Premier Bob Rae, was defeated by voters, who were angry with the actions of the Rae government, such as its unpopular hiring quotas and the Social Contract legislation in 1993. These policies caused the NDP to lose much of its base in organized labour, further reducing support for the party. At the 1993 federal election, the NDP tumbled to less than seven percent support, and lost all 11 of its federal seats in Ontario. By the time the writs were drawn up for the 1995 provincial election, it was obvious that the NDP would not be reelected.

==Riding name change==
Acts were passed in 1991 and 1993, providing for the following name changes to ridings:

:* Stormont, Dundas and Glengarry to S-D-G &amp; East Grenville.
:* Grey to Grey—Owen Sound.
:* York North to York—Mackenzie.

== Campaign ==
The Liberal Party under Lyn McLeod had been leading in the polls for most of the period from 1992 to 1995, and were generally favoured to benefit from the swing in support away from the NDP. However, the party hurt its credibility through a series of high-profile policy reversals in the period leading up to the election. The most notable of these occurred when McLeod withdrew Liberal support from the Equality Rights Statute Amendment Act (Bill 167) introduced by the NDP government in 1994, which would have provided same-sex couples with rights and obligations mostly equal to those of opposite-sex common law couples and introduced a form of civil unions. Her decision was seen as cynical and opportunistic in light of the Liberals&#x27; earlier rural by-election loss in the socially conservative riding of Victoria—Haliburton. This gave the McLeod Liberals a reputation for &quot;flip-flopping&quot; and inconsistency while offending its socially progressive supporters.

The Progressive Conservative Party, led by Mike Harris, found success with its Common Sense Revolution campaign to cut personal income taxes, social assistance (welfare) rates, and government spending dramatically. Roughly half of his party&#x27;s seats came from the more affluent regions of the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), especially the suburban belt surrounding Metro Toronto, often called the &#x27;905&#x27; for its telephone area code.

In addition, by presenting himself as a populist, representing &quot;ordinary Ontarians&quot; over &quot;special interests&quot;, Harris was able to build Tory support among working-class voters. Although there were regional variations, many working-class voters shifted directly from the NDP to the Tories during the election, enabling the latter to win formerly NDP ridings such as Cambridge and Oshawa.

The televised party leaders&#x27; debate is often regarded as the turning point of the campaign. During the event, McLeod further alienated many voters with an overly aggressive performance. Harris used his time to speak directly to the camera to convey his party&#x27;s Common Sense Revolution platform, virtually ignoring all questions asked of him by Rae and McLeod and avoiding getting caught up in their debate. Since Liberal support was regarded by many political insiders as soft and unsteady, many voters who were previously leaning to the Liberals shifted to the Progressive Conservatives after the debate.

==Opinion polls==
=== During the 35th Parliament of Ontario ===
== Results ==
===Summary===

The Progressive Conservatives won a majority while the Liberals finished with less support than they had in the 1990 election. The NDP, despite improving their standing in some Northern Ontario ridings, were heavily defeated, falling to 17 seats and third party status. The New Democrats would remain the third party until 2018 when they returned to Official Opposition status. McLeod and Rae resigned their party leadership posts not long after the campaign. It was also the worst result for an incumbent Ontario governing party up to that time and would remain so until 2018 when the NDP finally surpassed the then-governing Liberals.

One independent candidate was elected: Peter North in the riding of Elgin. North had been elected in 1990 as a New Democrat, but left the NDP and declared his intention to run as a Progressive Conservative. The PC Party did not accept him as a candidate, however.

At least five unregistered parties fielded candidates in this election, appearing on the ballot as independents:

:*The Reform Association of Ontario ran fifteen candidates. Their leader was Kimble Ainslie. An article of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; for August 19, 1995 indicates that the party won 6,400 votes.
:*John Steele campaigned as a candidate of the Communist League.
:*The Ontario Renewal Party ran a number of candidates under the leadership of Diane Johnston. This was the Marxist–Leninist party under a different name.
:*Amani Oakley and Joe Flexer ran as &quot;Independent Labour&quot; candidates in Toronto with the support of dissident or former members of the Ontario New Democratic Party and with the support of OPSEU in the case of Oakley and the Canadian Auto Workers in the case of Flexer .
:* John Turmel&#x27;s Abolitionist Party ran at least two candidates.

<doc id="852267" wikidata="Q3586384" url="?curid=852267" title="1990 Ontario general election">
<text>The 1990 Ontario general election was held on September 6, 1990, to elect members of the 35th Legislative Assembly of the province of Ontario, Canada. The governing Ontario Liberal Party led by Premier David Peterson was unexpectedly defeated. Although the Peterson government, and Peterson himself, were very popular, he was accused of opportunism in calling an election just three years into his mandate. In a shocking upset, the New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Bob Rae, won a majority government. This marked the first time the NDP had won government east of Manitoba, and to date the only time the NDP formed the government in Ontario.

Not even the NDP expected to come close to winning power. Rae had already made plans to retire from politics after the election; however, the NDP managed to take many seats in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) from the Liberals, and Rae himself represented York South, in Metro Toronto. They also did better than ever before, or in some cases since, in many other cities and rural areas. The NDP finished only five points ahead of the Liberals in the popular vote, but due to the nature of the first-past-the-post electoral system, which ignores the popular vote and awards power based on the number of ridings won, the NDP&#x27;s gains in the GTA decimated the Liberal caucus. The Liberals lost 59 seats, the second-worst defeat for a governing party in Ontario. At the time, it was the Liberals&#x27; worst showing in an Ontario election. Peterson himself was heavily defeated in London Centre by NDP challenger Marion Boyd, losing by 8,200 votes, one of the few times a provincial premier has lost their own seat.

Although Mike Harris&#x27; Progressive Conservative Party was unable to overcome voter distrust of the federal Progressive Conservative government of Brian Mulroney, his party managed to make a net gain of four seats. Although Harris was from northern Ontario, the Tories were particularly weak in that region, placing fourth, behind the Liberals, NDP, and the right-wing Confederation of Regions Party (CoR) in six northern Ontario ridings (Algoma, Cochrane South, Nickel Belt, Sudbury, Sudbury East, and Sault Ste. Marie). The CoR also placed ahead of the Progressive Conservatives in the Renfrew North and Cornwall ridings in eastern Ontario. Although they received only 1.9% of the vote provincewide, they managed 7.8% in the 33 ridings in which they actually fielded a candidate.

The Green Party of Ontario placed third, ahead of the NDP, in Parry Sound riding, where former Liberal leadership candidate Richard Thomas was the party&#x27;s candidate.
==Riding name change==
Before the election, an Act was passed, changing the name of Prince Edward—Lennox to Prince Edward—Lennox—South Hastings.

<doc id="852272" wikidata="Q4780436" url="?curid=852272" title="Apology Resolution">
<text>, informally known as the Apology Resolution, is a Joint Resolution of the U.S. Congress adopted in 1993 that &quot;acknowledges that the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii occurred with the active participation of agents and citizens of the United States and further acknowledges that the Native Hawaiian people never directly relinquished to the United States their claims to their inherent sovereignty as a people over their national lands, either through the Kingdom of Hawaii or through a plebiscite or referendum&quot; (U.S. Public Law 103-150 (107 Stat. 1510)). The resolution has been cited as impetus for the Hawaiian sovereignty movement, and has been the subject of debate. 

The resolution was adopted by both houses of the United States Congress on November 23, 1993. A joint resolution, it was signed by President of the United States Bill Clinton on the same day.

The resolution was passed in the Senate by a vote of 65–34. In the House, it was passed by a two-thirds voice vote. It was sponsored on January 21, 1993, as S.J.Res.19 by Daniel Akaka and co-sponsored by Daniel Inouye, both Democratic senators from Hawaii.

==Arguments for==
===Historical evidence===
The Apology Resolution derives mainly from the Blount Report, which was compiled shortly after the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy (spring 1893). Blount found strongly in the favor of Queen Liliʻuokalani and her supporters, and his report was an official criticism of the U.S. role in the overthrow. President Grover Cleveland was also strongly supportive of the Queen, and made official statements supporting the view held in the Blount Report. These official statements by the U.S. Government are seen as historical evidence for the claims made by the Apology Resolution.

===Parallels between Native Hawaiians and Native Americans===
Although the histories of Native Hawaiians and Native Americans are significantly different, there is still a widely held perception that Native Hawaiians have received similar kinds of unfair treatment from the U.S. Government as Native Americans. The Apology Bill is thus seen as a means of acknowledging historical grievances that they believe are valid. Some also see it as a step towards identifying Native Hawaiians as an indigenous people to preserve for them specific legal rights based on ancestry; some also see it as the beginning of a process to provide compensation or reparation to native Hawaiians for alleged past injustices.

How this decision on the &quot;nonsubstantive&quot; nature of the Apology Resolution will affect the pursuit of the Akaka Bill, which has based itself on the Apology Resolution, is not yet clear.

In 2009, the U.S. Congress passed a similar resolution, S.J.Res. 14, &quot;To acknowledge a long history of official depredations and ill-conceived policies by the Federal Government regarding Indian tribes and offer an apology to all Native Peoples on behalf of the United States.&quot;
==Arguments against==

===Disputed historical basis===
Although the Blount Report of July 17, 1893, upon which the Apology Resolution was based, was an official report of the U.S. government, it was followed by the Morgan Report on February 26, 1894, which after public hearings and testimony under oath found the Blount Report to be mistaken on many of the facts reported. Some of the criticisms of the Blount Report included the fact that it was done in secrecy, with no opportunity for cross-examination of witnesses and no witnesses placed under oath. Opponents of the Apology Resolution point to this official repudiation of the Blount Report as sufficient reason to dismiss any conclusions based on it. Despite being staunchly in favor of reinstating the monarchy, President Grover Cleveland also reversed himself upon receipt of the Morgan Report, refusing requests from the queen for further aid in her restoration, and acknowledging both the Provisional Government and Republic of Hawaii as the legitimate successors to the Kingdom.

Washington-based constitutional lawyer and Grassroot Institute of Hawaii consultant Bruce Fein has outlined a number of counterarguments challenging the historical accuracy and completeness of the assertions made in the Apology Resolution.

===Allegations that the bill was rushed through===
There has been criticism of the 1993 Apology Bill for its use in buttressing the Akaka Bill. The Apology Bill of 1993 was passed with only one hour of debate on the Senate floor with only five senators participating, three opposed (Slade Gorton, Hank Brown, John C. Danforth) and two in favor (Akaka and Inouye). It passed the house on November 15 in less time with no debate and no objections. Senator Inouye, wrapping up the debate, said:

The reliance upon the text of the Apology Resolution as justification for the Akaka Bill has been seen by some as contradicting Inouye&#x27;s statements on the matter in 1993.

In 1993, Senators Slade Gorton and Hank Brown did not take issue with the historical accuracy of the bill, although they voted against it. More recently they have described it as being a piece of historical revisionism. They wrote an article in the Wall Street Journal titled &quot;The Opposite Of Progress&quot; in which they were critical of the historical veracity of the Apology Bill.

==Practical legal effect==

In a response to the State of Hawai&#x27;i Appeal of the Arakaki Decision, the plaintiffs argued that the &quot;whereas&quot; clauses should not be given legal effect.

In testimony before the United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary, April 17, 2002, Michael Glennon opined that whereas clauses have &quot;no binding legal effect&quot;:

In March 2009, the US Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs&quot; that the Apology Resolution&#x27;s 37 whereas clauses have no legally binding effects and therefore did not create any new rights for native Hawaiians to raise legal claims. In its unanimous decision, the Supreme Court noted that federal legislation cannot retroactively alter the Hawaiian state government&#x27;s ownership over its land when granted as part of its admission to the United States.

<text>Some professionals and universities consider social policy a subset of public policy, while other practitioners characterize social policy and public policy to be two separate, competing approaches for the same public interest (similar to MD and DO in healthcare), with social policy deemed more holistic than public policy. Whichever of these persuasions a university adheres to, social policy begins with the study of the welfare state and social services. It consists of guidelines, principles, legislation and associated activities that affect the living conditions conducive to human welfare, such as a person&#x27;s quality of life. The Department of Social Policy at the London School of Economics defines social policy as &quot;an interdisciplinary and applied subject concerned with the analysis of societies&#x27; responses to social need&quot;, which seeks to foster in its students a capacity to understand theory and evidence drawn from a wide range of social science disciplines, including economics, sociology, psychology, geography, history, law, philosophy and political science. The Malcolm Wiener Center for Social Policy at Harvard University describes social policy as &quot;public policy and practice in the areas of health care, human services, criminal justice, inequality, education, and labor&quot;. Social policy might also be described as actions that affect the well-being of members of a society through shaping the distribution of and access to goods and resources in that society. Social policy often deals with wicked problems.

The discussion of &#x27;social policy&#x27; in the United States and Canada can also apply to governmental policy on social issues such as tackling racism, LGBT issues (such as same-sex marriage) and the legal status of abortion, guns, euthanasia, recreational drugs and prostitution. In other countries, these issues would be classified under health policy and domestic policy.

The study of social policy can either be a stand-alone degree at providers such as the University of Birmingham, University of York, Oxford University, and the University of Pennsylvania, a specialization as part of a public policy degree program such as at McGill University, Balsillie School of International Affairs, Harris School of Public Policy, and the Hertie School of Governance, or a joint degree along with a similar related degree in social work or public health such as at George Warren Brown School of Social Work at Washington University in St. Louis. In the Global South, social policy is offered along with public policy degree programmes, as at the Institute of Public Policy, National Law School of India University, Bangalore, combined with development policy.

==History==


Social policy is a plan or action of government or institutional agencies which aim to improve or reform society.
Social policy was first conceived in the 1940s by Richard Titmuss within the field of social administration in Britain. Titmuss&#x27;s essay on the &quot;Social Division of Welfare&quot; (1955) laid the development for social policy to gradually absorb social administration. Titmuss was an essayist whose work concerned the failure of the market; the inadequacy of selective social services; and the superiority of collectivism and universal approaches. While some scholars describe social policy as an interdisciplinary field of practice, scholars like Fiona Williams and Pete Alcock believe social policy is a discipline unto itself.

Some of the earliest examples of direct intervention by government in human welfare date back to Ancient Rome&#x27;s &quot;Cura Annonae&quot; (grain dole) founded in 123 BC, and Umar ibn al-Khattāb&#x27;s rule as the second caliph of Islam in the 6th century: he used &quot;zakat&quot; collections and also other governmental resources to establish pensions, income support, child benefits, and various stipends for people of the non-Muslim community. The enactment of English Poor Laws helped curb poverty and recidivism: these laws influenced the justices of Berkshire to implement the Speenhamland system, which was the first social program in the modern sense of that word. In the modern West, proponents of scientific social planning such as the sociologist Auguste Comte, and social researchers, such as Charles Booth, contributed to the emergence of social policymaking in the first industrialised countries following the Industrial Revolution. Surveys of poverty exposing the brutal conditions in the urban slum conurbations of Victorian Britain supplied the pressure leading to changes such as the decline and abolition of the poor law system and Liberal welfare reforms. Other significant examples in the development of social policy are the Bismarckian welfare state in 19th century Germany, social security policies in the United States introduced under the rubric of the New Deal between 1933 and 1935, and both the Beveridge Report and the National Health Service Act 1946 in Britain. Thus, two major models of social insurance arose in practice: Bismarkian welfare from Germany and Beveridgean welfare from Britain.

Social policy in the 21st century is complex and in each state it is subject to local and national governments, as well as supranational political influence. For example, membership of the European Union is conditional on member states&#x27; adherence to the Social Chapter of European Union law 

==Types==
Social policy aims to improve human welfare and to meet human needs for education, health, housing and economic security. Important areas of social policy are wellbeing and welfare, poverty reduction, social security, justice, unemployment insurance, living conditions, animal rights, pensions, health care, social housing, family policy, social care, child protection, social exclusion, education policy, crime and criminal justice, urban development, and labor issues.

==United States social policy==
The United States was a pioneer in generous social spending (relative to comparable countries), as it provided substantial social spending for Civil War veterans and their families. However, the United States would go on to lag behind other advanced industrial democracies in social spending.

Religious, racial, ideological, scientific and philosophical movements and ideas have historically influenced American social policy, for example, John Calvin and his idea of pre-destination and the Protestant Values of hard work and individualism. Moreover, Social Darwinism helped mold America&#x27;s ideas of capitalism and the &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; mentality. The Catholic Church&#x27;s social teaching has also been considerably influential to the development of social policy.

President Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s ground breaking New Deal is a paragon example of Social Policy that focused predominantly on a program of providing work and stimulating the economy through public spending on projects, rather than on cash payment. The programs were in response to the Great Depression affecting the United States in the 1930s.

United States politicians who have favored increasing government observance of social policy often do not frame their proposals around typical notions of welfare or benefits; instead, in cases like &quot;Medicare&quot; and &quot;Medicaid&quot;, President Lyndon B. Johnson presented a package called the Great Society that framed a larger vision around poverty and quality of life.

President Lyndon B. Johnson would also attempt to implement education policy under his Great Society package, introducing several programs and laws, such as the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (ESEA), Higher Education Act of 1965 (HEA), and the Bilingual Education Act of 1967 (BEA), and many others. These laws would form the backbone of the education policy changes of the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), introduced during the administration of Republican President George W. Bush with bipartisan support. The law took effect on January 8, 2002, attempting to raise standards in education, address educational inequities (framed as an achievement gap), and issues in schools framed as issues of accountability. The No Child Left Behind Act required every state to assess students on basic skills to receive federal funding. While the law did attempt to address issues underlying U.S. education, its provisions were widely viewed as unsuccessful. States continued to create their own standards while assessing themselves. NCLB also led to the closure of numerous schools labeled &quot;low-performing&quot; or &quot;failing&quot;, disproportionately impacting schools that served predominately Black students and rural communities. Provisions of NCLB were changed and replaced under the Race to the Top (R2T, RTTT or RTT) and Every Child Succeeds Act (ESSA) passed during the Administration of President Barack Obama.

Insurance has been a growing policy topic, and a recent example of health care law as social policy is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act formed by the 111th U.S. Congress and signed into law by President Barack Obama, a Democrat, on March 23, 2010.

<text>Jean Graton (10 August 1923 – 21 January 2021) was a French comic book author and cartoonist. Graton created the character Michel Vaillant and the eponymous series in 1957.

==Biography==
Graton was born in Nantes, France, in 1923. He moved to Brussels in 1947 and worked there in animation and advertising companies. He was hired by &quot;Spirou&quot; magazine in 1952, for which he illustrated &quot;Belles Histoires de l&#x27;Oncle Paul&quot;. Determined to create and draw his own characters, he got a job for &quot;Tintin&quot; magazine. From 1953, he published his own stories in &quot;Tintin&quot;. Some consisting of a few strips, and most related to sports and automobiles, were published in 1957 by Le Lombard in an album entitled &quot;Ca c&#x27;est du sport!&quot;.

In 1957, Graton created the character Michel Vaillant. Some short comics were published in &quot;Tintin&quot; and acquired huge popularity. As soon as 1959, a full album was published by Le Lombard. In 1966, Graton created the &quot;Les Labourdet&quot; series with his wife, Francine, and published it between 1967 and 1970 in the &quot;Chez Nous&quot; magazine. In 1972, he created Julie Wood, a character who starred first in her own series, then in the &quot;Michel Vaillant&quot; series. In 1982, Graton started, with his son Philippe Graton, his own publishing house, Graton Editeur. He launched, with Philippe Graton, the &quot;Dossiers Michel Vaillant&quot; series in 1995, each album of which being dedicated to a famous driver. In 2000, they created the &quot;Palmarès Inedit&quot; series, made up of comics that were drawn by Graton in the 1950s and 1960s, including the &quot;Labourdet&quot; series, as well as comics that had not been published before.

In 2004, Graton, at the age of 80, decided to retire and to stop drawing. His works are continued by Philippe Graton and the Studio Graton, which he created himself.

On 21 January 2021, Graton died in Brussels, Belgium, at the age of 97.

==Graphic style==
The huge popularity of Graton&#x27;s series is partly due to their extreme realism. Graton&#x27;s works, particularly the &quot;Michel Vaillant&quot; series, are notable for featuring real-life people, drivers, teams, races, and places. Graton is widely recognized as a great automobile and motorsport drawer. The several descriptions of places, circuits, and cars he gave in his series are highly well-documented, specific, and realistic. Graton used to take a lot of notes, illustrations, and photographs of the various automobile-related places he attended as an automobile-passionate. He was later assisted with this work by his son Philippe, who has a passion for photography.

==Relation with motorsports==

Graton&#x27;s passion for motorsport went back to his childhood. Later in his life, he attended numerous Formula One and other motorsport races, and was acknowledged by famous drivers. His series inspired some drivers to choose such a career.

<text>Luigino Celestino di Agostino (; born 17 December 1967), known professionally as Gigi D&#x27;Agostino (), is an Italian DJ and music producer. In 1986, he started his career as a DJ spinning Italo disco. His biggest chart successes include &quot;Bla Bla Bla&quot;, &quot;Another Way&quot;, a cover of Nik Kershaw&#x27;s &quot;The Riddle&quot;, &quot;La Passion&quot;, &quot;Super&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Amour Toujours&quot;, all in the years 1999 and 2000. The hookline of &quot;L&#x27;Amour Toujours&quot; was also used for the 2018 hit game remix/mashup &quot;In My Mind&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born in Turin, Italy on 17 December 1967, to parents from Salerno, Campania, D&#x27;Agostino spent his childhood between Turin and Brescia, where the Media Records studios are located. As a child, D&#x27;Agostino wanted to be someone in the world of disco music. Starting out working as a stonemason and a fitter, he began his musical career as a DJ by organizing parties in clubs. His debut was in a club near Turin called &quot;Woodstock&quot;. He worked also in a small club called Palladio in Cascinette d&#x27;Ivrea (30 km north from Turin) from 1987 until around 1992 and in a club called Le Palace in the Valentino Castle Garden in Turin. He was resident DJ of an Italian disco named Ultimo Impero from 1993 to 1998.

==Career==
===1990s===
D&#x27;Agostino&#x27;s first release was &quot;Noise Maker Theme&quot;, a double-A-sided record with a track by Daniele Gas on the other side, which launched the Noise Maker label, under the direction of Italo house producer Gianfranco Bortolotti. D&#x27;Agostino would continue working with Gas, as well as Mauro Picotto&#x27;s production team in the following years. As a DJ, D&#x27;Agostino is known as one of the &quot;pioneers of Mediterranean Progressive Dance&quot;, consisting of minimalistic sounds and Latin and Mediterranean melodies. As a record producer, D&#x27;Agostino&#x27;s uses the pseudonym &quot;Gigi Dag&quot;; he transforms a piece, originally destined for the discos, into a success for the mainstream public.

After successes like the track &quot;Sweetly&quot;, he joined the team of Bortolotti, the general manager of Media Records and suddenly reached the top of the hit parades. His single &quot;FLY&quot;, published in 1996 with BXR Noise Maker, the label created by Media Records for Mediterranea progressive house, reached the top of the sales in Italy. This was followed by his single &quot;Gigi&#x27;s Violin&quot;.

Subsequently, D&#x27;Agostino released the song &quot;Angel&#x27;s Symphony&quot; with R.A.F. by Mauro Picotto, a friend from Media Records. His biggest project was the self-titled debut album &quot;Gigi D&#x27;Agostino&quot;, consisting of 19 tracks, which sold over 60,000 copies.

After his rise to success, D&#x27;Agostino&#x27;s musical style changed, with his sound becoming more melodic, at midway between house and progressive, with more energetic and melodious sonorities and less obsessive rhythms, also known as Italo dance.

In 1997, he released the single &quot;Gin Lemon&quot;, followed by &quot;Your Love (Elisir)&quot; (1998), &quot;Cuba Libre&quot; (1998), and &quot;Bla Bla Bla&quot; (1999). He later released the album &quot;Eurodance Compilation&quot;, which contained five unpublished tracks. With this compilation, he earned a platinum disc and was awarded &quot;Best Producer in 1999&quot; at the Italian Dance Awards. In October, D&#x27;Agostino released another hit single, entitled &quot;Another Way&quot;.

In 1999, his album &quot;L&#x27;Amour Toujours&quot; (released in 2001 in the United States) included 23 tracks on two CDs, with the hit song &quot;L&#x27;Amour Toujours&quot; bringing him to the 10th position in the sales parade in Italy; as a result, he earned another Platinum Disc. His 1999 single &quot;Bla Bla Bla&quot; became a major hit in Europe. He described the single as &quot;a piece I wrote thinking of all the people who talk and talk without saying anything!&quot;

===2000s===

In 2000, his remake of the Nik Kershaw song &quot;The Riddle&quot; sold 1,000,000 copies in Germany and 200,000 copies in France. He also released the albums &quot;Tecno Fes&quot; (August 2000) and &quot;Tecno Fes - EP, Vol. 2&quot; (December 2000).

In 2001, he released &quot;L&#x27;Amour Toujours EP&quot;, consisting of three songs: two new versions of &quot;L&#x27;amour Toujours&quot; and &quot;Un Giorno Credi&quot;, a single made in collaboration with Edoardo Bennato. &quot;Un Giorno Credi&quot; reached the top of the parades in Italy and became one of the most played songs in the national and international music networks. He was also awarded with &quot;Best DJ-Producer of the Year&quot; at the &quot;Red Bull Awards&quot; in Italy.

In 2001, he also released the hit &quot;Super&quot;, as a result of a collaboration with Albertino (an Italian music artist), which won him the awards &quot;Best Dance Producer&quot; at the PIM (Italian Music Award) and &quot;Public Award&quot; at the Danish DJs Award in Copenhagen, Denmark. In December of that year, he released &quot;Il Grande Viaggio&quot;, a compilation of his favourite songs, including old electronic pieces and new rhythms and melodies. As a result, he was awarded with &quot;Best Dance Producer&quot; at the Italian Dance Awards.

In 2003, he released the song &quot;Ripassa&quot; in the EP &quot;Underconstruction 1: Silence&quot;, a hit which is very important for his next productions. This song helped influence Lento Violento, a subgenre that had yet to be distinguished.

On 15 July 2004, his compilation &quot;Euro Dance&quot; won Platinum certification with 120,000 copies sold in just a few weeks.

In December 2004, D&#x27;Agostino released his fourth studio album, &quot;L&#x27;Amour Toujours II&quot;.D&#x27;Agostino has played in some well-known clubs throughout Europe, including in Italy, Spain, France, the Netherlands, the Czech Republic, Germany, Switzerland, and England (in 1996, he played at the Ministry of Sound in London with Mauro Picotto).

In 2006, he created his own new record label called &quot;Noisemaker Hard&quot; to differentiate the style of music released under his older record label, &quot;Noisemaker&quot;.

In 2007, D&#x27;Agostino released &quot;Lento Violento ...e altre storie&quot;, a compilation which contains two CDs and his new 35 Lento Violento songs. Most important &quot;hits&quot; of the album are &quot;Cammino&quot; (a collaboration with Dimitri Mazza) and &quot;Vorrei Fare una Canzone&quot; (a collaboration with Gerolamo Sacco) according to YouTube views.

After some months, he released the compilation &quot;La musica che pesta&quot; under the name &quot;Lento Violento Man&quot;, which contains two CDs for a total of 38 unmixed tracks.

From 2005 until January 2010, he had radio programs, on the Italian &quot;Radio m2o Musica allo Stato Puro&quot; (in English: &quot;Music at the Pure State&quot;), called &quot;Il Cammino di Gigi D&#x27;Agostino&quot; and &quot;Quello che mi piace
&quot;. They consist of DJ sets played by Gigi, and featured new remixes of his songs and songs by Italian and international artists.

===2010s===
In August 2011, he released a digital single &quot;Stay With Me&quot;. This was released a few months after he postponed the release of his upcoming album &quot;Mondo Reale&quot;.

In May 2017, CBC News reported that his music is popular in the remote Canadian Inuit community of Arviat, where D&#x27;Agostino&#x27;s &quot;slicing, bass-heavy beats have a lot in common with the music of traditional Inuit drum-dancing.&quot;

In 2018, along with Dynoro, Gigi released &quot;In My Mind&quot; which became an international hit.

===2020s===
In May 2024, L&#x27;Amour Toujours was banned by the organizers of several festivals in Germany, after it was used at the Club &quot;Pony&quot; on the German Island Sylt as a rendition for the slogans &quot;Foreigners out&quot; and &quot;Germany for Germans&quot;.

== Logo ==

Starting with his 1999 album Bla Bla Bla, many of D&#x27;Agostino&#x27;s album covers have featured a logo consisting of the Japanese character [舞], pronounced mai or bu, and meaning &quot;dance&quot;. He has also used Japanese characters [ジージーダグ] [ジージーダゴスティーノ] for his name on several album covers.

<doc id="852290" wikidata="Q952548" url="?curid=852290" title="1987 Ontario general election">
<text>The 1987 Ontario general election was held on September 10, 1987, to elect members of the 34th Legislative Assembly of Ontario.

The governing Ontario Liberal Party, led by Premier David Peterson, was returned to power with their first majority government in half a century, and the second-largest majority government in the province&#x27;s history. Peterson had successfully managed to govern with a minority in the Legislature by obtaining the co-operation of the Ontario New Democratic Party, led by Bob Rae, in a confidence and supply agreement. It was through the NDP&#x27;s support that Peterson was able to form a government, even though the Progressive Conservative Party had won a slightly larger number of seats in the previous election.

The PC Party, led by Larry Grossman, campaigned on a platform of tax cuts to stimulate the economy. Its support continued to slide, as voters opted for the change that the Liberal-NDP arrangement provided, with Grossman losing his own seat. The PCs fell to 16 seats and third place in the legislature, their worst showing in an election in half a century.

The NDP was unable to convince the bulk of voters that it should be given credit for the success of the Liberal government that it had supported. It nevertheless did receive more votes and a larger proportion of the vote than in the previous election, although the party lost six seats due to the first-past-the-post electoral system. The party became the Official Opposition for the fourth time in its history.


==Expansion of the Legislature==
An Act was passed in 1986, providing for the Legislative Assembly to increase from 125 members to 130. The following changes were made:
