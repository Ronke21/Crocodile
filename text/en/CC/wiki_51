<text>Hawaii&#x27;s 2nd congressional district is a congressional district in the U.S. state of Hawaii. It is represented by Jill Tokuda, who succeeded Kai Kahele after the 2022 election. The district encompasses all rural and most suburban areas of Oahu/Honolulu County, as well as the entire state outside of Oahu. It includes the counties of Kauai, Maui, Kalawao, and Hawaii (&quot;the Big Island&quot;). The district spans 331 miles. The most populous community entirely within the district is Hilo. Major segments of the economy include tourism, ranching, and agriculture.

Under the U.S. Constitution, a candidate for this district has to be a resident of Hawaii, but does not have to live in the district itself. The first non-resident elected to this seat was Ed Case, a Honolulu attorney, though he was born and raised on the Big Island of Hawaii. The home state office of the second congressional district is at the Prince Kuhio Federal Building near Honolulu Harbor.

==History==
When Hawaii and Alaska were admitted to the Union in 1959, both new states were granted one at-large representative to Congress pending the next United States census. In the reapportionment following the 1960 U.S. census, Hawaii gained a second U.S. representative. Instead of creating two congressional districts, the state continued to elect its U.S. representatives at large. Two representatives were first elected in 1962, and Hawaii was first represented by two U.S. representatives on January 2, 1963, upon the convening of the 88th Congress. The 2nd congressional district was created in 1971 when Hawaii began electing its representatives from districts instead of electing at-large representatives statewide.

The 2nd congressional district has a Cook Partisan Voting Index of D+14. It has supported the Democratic nominee in every presidential election since 1988, and has never elected a Republican U.S. representative. In October 2019, Representative Tulsi Gabbard announced that she would not seek reelection, instead choosing to focus on her campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.

In January 2019, Hawaii state senator Kai Kahele announced he would run for the seat in 2020. Other Democrats who announced were David Cornejo, Brian Evans (a self-described &quot;Berniecrat&quot; who ran for the seat as a Republican in 2018), Noelle Famera, and Ryan Meza. Republicans Joseph Akana and Jonathan Hoomanawanui also announced. Kahele won the Democratic nomination on August 8 and the general election on November 3.

<doc id="859076" wikidata="Q490228" url="?curid=859076" title="Lehigh Valley Railroad">
<text>The Lehigh Valley Railroad was a railroad in the Northeastern United States built predominantly to haul anthracite coal from the Coal Region in Northeastern Pennsylvania to major consumer markets in Philadelphia, New York City, and elsewhere. 

On April 21, 1846, the railroad was authorized to provide freight transportation of passengers, goods, wares, merchandise, and minerals in Pennsylvania. On September 20, 1847, the railroad was incorporated and established, initially called the Delaware, Lehigh, Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad Company. 

On January 7, 1853, the railroad&#x27;s name was changed to Lehigh Valley Railroad. It was sometimes known as the Route of the Black Diamond; black diamond is a slang word for anthracite, the high-end type of Pennsylvania coal that it initially transported by boat down the Lehigh River. 

The Lehigh Valley Railroad&#x27;s original and primary route between Easton and Allentown was built in 1855. The line later expanded past Allentown to Lehigh Valley Terminal in Buffalo and past Easton to New York City, bringing the Lehigh Valley Railroad to these metropolitan areas. By December 31, 1925, the railroad controlled 1,363.7 miles of road and 3,533.3 miles of track. By 1970, this had dwindled to 927 miles of road and 1963 miles of track.

The first small repair shops for locomotives and cars were located in Delano, Wilkes-Barre, Weatherly, Hazleton, and South Easton. In 1902 these were mostly consolidated into the shops at Sayre, Pennsylvania on the New York State border, which featured a 750 by 336-foot machine shop with 48 erecting pits. The shops in Packerton, Pennsylvania, located in the Coal Region north of Allentown, served as the primary freight car shops.

Conrail maintained the line as a main line into the New York metropolitan area, and the line became known as the Lehigh Line during Conrail&#x27;s ownership of it. In 1976, Conrail abandoned most of the route in New York state to Buffalo, considerably shortening the line.

The majority of the Lehigh Line is now owned by the Norfolk Southern Railway (NS) and retains much of its original route in eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey, although it no longer goes into New York City. The former Lehigh Valley tracks between Manville, New Jersey, and Newark are operated separately by Conrail Shared Assets Operations as their own Lehigh Line.

In 1976, the railroad ended operations and merged into Conrail along with several northeastern railroads that same year.

== History ==



===19th century===

The Delaware, Lehigh, Schuylkill and Susquehanna Railroad (DLS&amp;S) was authorized by the Pennsylvania General Assembly on April 21, 1846, to construct a railroad from Mauch Chunk, Pennsylvania, now Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, to Easton, Pennsylvania. The railroad would run parallel to the Lehigh River and break the Lehigh Coal and Navigation Company&#x27;s monopoly on coal traffic from Wyoming Valley. The railroad was chartered on August 2, 1847, and elected James Madison Porter its president on October 21.

Little occurred between 1847 and 1851, save some limited grading near Allentown, Pennsylvania. All this changed in October 1851, when Asa Packer took majority control of the DLS&amp;S. Packer brought additional financing to the railroad, installed Robert H. Sayre as chief engineer, and renamed the company the &quot;Lehigh Valley Railroad.&quot; Construction began in earnest in 1853, and the line opened between Easton and Allentown on June 11, 1855. The section between Allentown and Mauch Chunk opened on September 12.

At Easton, the LVRR interchanged coal at the Delaware River where coal could be shipped to Philadelphia on the Delaware Division Canal or transported across the river to Phillipsburg, New Jersey, where the Morris Canal and the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ) could carry it to the New York City market. At Easton, the LVRR constructed a double-decked bridge across the Delaware River for connections to the CNJ and the Belvidere Delaware Railroad in Phillipsburg.

Through a connection with the Central Railroad of New Jersey, LVRR passengers had a route to Newark, New Jersey, Jersey City, New Jersey, and other points in New Jersey.

The LVRR&#x27;s rolling stock was hired from the Central Railroad of New Jersey and a contract was made with the CNJ to run two passenger trains from Easton to Mauch Chunk connecting with the Philadelphia trains on the Belvidere Delaware Railroad. A daily freight train was put into operation leaving Easton in the morning and returning in the evening. In the early part of October 1855, a contract was made with Howard &amp; Co. of Philadelphia to do the freighting business of the railroad (except coal, iron, and iron ore).

The length of the line from Mauch Chunk to Easton was 46 miles of single track. The line was laid with a rail weighing 56 pounds per yard supported upon cross ties 6 x 7 inches and 7-1/2 feet long placed 2 feet apart and about a quarter of it was ballasted with stone or gravel. The line had a descending or level grade from Mauch Chunk to Easton and with the exception of the curve at Mauch Chunk had no curve of less than 700 feet radius.
The LVRR connected at Mauch Chunk with the Beaver Meadow Railroad. The Beaver Meadow Railroad had been built in 1836, and it transported anthracite coal from Jeansville in Pennsylvania&#x27;s Middle Coal Field to the Lehigh Canal at Mauch Chunk. For 25 years the Lehigh Canal had enjoyed a monopoly on downstream transportation and was charging independent producers high fees. When the LVRR opened, those producers eagerly sent their product by the railroad instead of canal, and within two years of its construction the LVRR was carrying over 400,000 tons of coal annually. By 1859 it had 600 coal cars and 19 engines.

The LVRR immediately became the trunk line down the Lehigh Valley, with numerous feeder railroads connecting and contributing to its traffic. The production of the entire Middle Coal Field came to the LVRR over feeders to the Beaver Meadow: the Quakake Railroad, the Catawissa, Williamsport and Erie Railroad, the Hazleton Railroad, the Lehigh Luzerne Railroad and other smaller lines. At Catasauqua, the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Railroad transported coal, ore, limestone and iron for furnaces of the Thomas Iron Company, the Lehigh Crane Iron Company, the Lehigh Valley Iron Works, the Carbon Iron Company, and others. At Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, the North Pennsylvania Railroad which was completed during the Summer of 1856, provided a rail connection to Philadelphia and thus brought the LVRR a direct line to Philadelphia. At Phillipsburg, New Jersey, the Belvidere Delaware Railroad connected to Trenton, New Jersey. To accommodate the gauge of the Belvidere, the cars were furnished with wheels having wide treads that operated on both roads.

The 1860s saw an expansion of the LVRR northward to the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, area and up the Susquehanna River to the New York state line.

Asa Packer was elected President of the Lehigh Valley Railroad on January 13, 1862.

In 1864, the LVRR began acquiring feeder railroads and merging them with its system. The first acquisitions were the Beaver Meadow Railroad and Coal Company, which included a few hundred acres of coal land, and the Penn Haven and White Haven Railroad. The purchase of the Penn Haven and White Haven was the first step in expanding to Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania. To reach Wilkes-Barre, the LVRR began constructing an extension from White Haven, Pennsylvania, to Wilkes-Barre. The Penn Haven and White Haven Railroad allowed the LV to reach White Haven.

In 1866, the LVRR purchased acquired the Lehigh and Mahanoy Railroad (originally the Quakake Railroad) and the North Branch Canal along the Susquehanna River, renaming it the Pennsylvania and New York Canal &amp; Railroad Company (P&amp;NY). The purchasing of the North Branch Canal saw an opportunity for a near monopoly in the region north of the Wyoming Valley. In 1866, two years after the purchase of the Penn Haven and White Haven, the extension from White Haven to Wilkes-Barre opened.

Construction of a rail line to the New York state line started immediately and, in 1867, the line was complete from Wilkes-Barre to Waverly, New York, where coal was transferred to the broad gauge Erie Railroad and shipped to western markets through Buffalo, New York. To reach Wilkes-Barre, the LVRR purchased the Penn Haven &amp; White Haven Railroad in 1864, and began constructing an extension from White Haven to Wilkes-Barre that was opened in 1867. By 1869, the LVRR owned a continuous track through Pennsylvania from Easton to Waverly.

In the following year, the LVRR—a standard gauge railroad—completed arrangements with the Erie Railroad, at that time having a six-foot gauge, for a third rail within the Erie mainline tracks to enable the LV equipment to run through to Elmira and later to Buffalo.

Further rounds of acquisitions took place in 1868. The acquisitions in 1868 were notable because they marked the beginning of the LVRR&#x27;s strategy of acquiring coal lands to ensure production and traffic for its own lines. Although the 1864 acquisition of the Beaver Meadow had included a few hundred acres of coal land, by 1868 the LVRR was feeling pressure from the Delaware and Hudson and the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad in the northern Wyoming Valley coal field, where the railroads mined and transported their own coal at a much reduced cost. The LVRR recognized that its own continued prosperity depended on obtaining what coal lands remained. In pursuit of that strategy, the 1868 purchases of the Hazleton Railroad and the Lehigh Luzerne Railroad brought of coal land to the LVRR, and additional lands were acquired along branches of the LVRR. Over the next dozen years the railroad acquired other large tracts of land: in 1870, in 1872, and acquisition of the Philadelphia Coal Company in 1873 with its large leases in the Mahanoy basin. In 1875, the holdings were consolidated into the Lehigh Valley Coal Company, which was wholly owned by the LVRR. By 1893, the LVRR owned or controlled of coal lands. With these acquisitions, the LVRR obtained the right to mine coal as well as transport it.

The 1870s witnessed commencement of extension of the LVRR in a new direction. In the 1870s the LVRR acquired other large tracts of land starting at in 1870, with an additional of in 1872, and turned its eye toward expansion across New Jersey all the way to the New York City area. In 1870, the Lehigh Valley Railroad acquired trackage rights to Auburn, New York, on the Southern Central Railroad.

The most important market in the east was New York City, but the LVRR was dependent on the CNJ and the Morris Canal for transport to the New York tidewater. In 1871, the LVRR leased the Morris Canal, which had a valuable outlet in Jersey City on the Hudson River opposite Manhattan. Asa Packer purchased additional land at the canal basin in support of the New Jersey West Line Railroad, which he hoped to use as the LVRR&#x27;s terminal. That project failed, but the lands were later used for the LVRR&#x27;s own terminal in 1889.

The CNJ, anticipating that the LVRR intended to create its own line across New Jersey, protected itself by leasing the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad (L&amp;S) to ensure a continuing supply of coal traffic. The L&amp;S had been chartered in 1837 by the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company (the Lehigh Canal company) to connect the upper end of the canal at Mauch Chunk to Wilkes-Barre. After the LVRR opened its line, the Lehigh &amp; Susquehanna extended to Phillipsburg, New Jersey, and connected with the CNJ and the Morris and Essex Railroad in 1868. In 1871, the entire line from Phillipsburg to Wilkes-Barre was leased to the CNJ. For most of its length, it ran parallel to the LVRR.

The LVRR found that the route of the Morris Canal was impractical for use as a railroad line, so in 1872 the LVRR purchased the dormant charter of the Perth Amboy and Bound Brook Railroad which had access to the Perth Amboy, New Jersey, harbor, and added to it a new charter, the Bound Brook and Easton Railroad. The State of New Jersey passed legislation that allowed the LVRR to consolidate its New Jersey railroads into one company; the Perth Amboy and Bound Brook and the Bound Brook and Easton were merged to form a new railroad company called the Easton and Amboy Railroad (or Easton &amp; Amboy Railroad Company).

The Easton and Amboy Railroad was a railroad built across central New Jersey by the Lehigh Valley Railroad to run from Phillipsburg, New Jersey, to Bound Brook, New Jersey, and it was built to connect the Lehigh Valley Railroad coal-hauling operations in Pennsylvania and the Port of New York and New Jersey to serve consumer markets in the New York metropolitan area, eliminating the Phillipsburg connection with the CNJ that had previously been the only outlet to the New York tidewater; until it was built, the terminus of the LVRR had been at Phillipsburg on the Delaware River opposite Easton, Pennsylvania. The Easton and Amboy was used as a connection to the New York metropolitan area, with a terminus in Jersey City, New Jersey.

Construction commenced in 1872 as soon the Easton and Amboy was formed; coal docks at Perth Amboy were soon constructed, and most of the line from Easton to Perth Amboy was graded and rails laid. However, the route required a tunnel through/under Musconetcong Mountain near Pattenburg, New Jersey (about twelve miles east of Phillipsburg), and that proved troublesome, delaying the opening of the line until May 1875, when a coal train first passed over the line. To support the expected increase in traffic, the wooden bridge over the Delaware River at Easton was also replaced by a double-tracked, iron bridge.

At Perth Amboy, a tidewater terminal was built on the Arthur Kill comprising a large coal dock used to transport coal into New York City. These tracks were laid and the Easton and Amboy Railroad was opened for business on June 28, 1875, with hauling coal. The Easton and Amboy&#x27;s operations were labeled the &quot;New Jersey Division&quot; of the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The Easton and Amboy had already completed large docks and facilities for shipping coal at Perth Amboy upon an extensive tract of land fronting the Arthur Kill. Approximately 350,000 tons of anthracite moved to Perth Amboy during that year for transshipment by water. Operations continued until the LVRR&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1976. The marshalling yard is now the residential area known as Harbortown.

Passenger traffic on the LVRR&#x27;s Easton and Amboy connected with the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) at Metuchen, New Jersey, and continued to the PRR&#x27;S Exchange Place terminus in Jersey City; that connection was discontinued in 1891 after the LVRR established its own route to Jersey City from South Plainfield. The Easton and Amboy Railroad was absorbed into the parent Lehigh Valley Railroad.

In 1875, the LVRR financed the addition of a third rail to the Erie Railroad main line so that cars could roll directly from colliery to the port at Buffalo. While the third rail on the Erie Railroad main line between Waverly and Buffalo gave the LVRR an unbroken connection to Buffalo, the road&#x27;s management desired its own line into Buffalo. The Geneva, Ithaca &amp; Athens Railroad passed into the hands of the LVRR in September 1876, which extended from the New York state line near Sayre, Pennsylvania, to Geneva, New York, a distance of 75 miles.

On May 17, 1879, Asa Packer, the company&#x27;s founder and leader, died at the age of 73. At the time of his death, the railroad was shipping 4.4 million tons of coal annually over of track, using 235 engines, 24,461 coal cars, and over 2,000 freight cars of various kinds. The company controlled of coal-producing lands and was expanding rapidly into New York and New Jersey. The railroad had survived the economic depression of 1873 and was seeing its business recover. Leadership of the company transferred smoothly to Charles Hartshorne, who had been vice president under Packer. In 1883, Hartshorne retired to allow Harry E. Packer, Asa&#x27;s 32-year-old youngest son, to assume the Presidency. A year later, Harry Packer died of illness, and Asa&#x27;s 51-year-old nephew Elisha Packer Wilbur was elected president, a position he held for 13 years.

The 1880s continued to be a period of growth, and the LVRR made important acquisitions in New York, expanded its reach into the southern coal field of Pennsylvania which had hitherto been the monopoly of the Reading, and successfully battled the CNJ over terminal facilities in Jersey City.

In 1880, the LVRR established the Lehigh Valley Transportation Line to operate a fleet of ships on the Great Lakes with terminals in Chicago, Milwaukee, and Duluth. This company became an important factor in the movement of anthracite, grain and package freight between Buffalo, Chicago, Milwaukee, Duluth, Superior and other midwestern cities. Following Federal legislation which stopped the operation of such service, the lake line was sold to private interests in 1920.

The port on Lake Erie at Buffalo was critical to the LVRR&#x27;s shipments of coal to western markets and for receipt of grain sent by the West to eastern markets. Although in 1870 the LVRR had invested in the Buffalo Creek Railroad, which connected the Erie to the lakefront, and had constructed the Lehigh Docks on Buffalo Creek, it depended on the Erie Railroad for the connection from Waverly to Buffalo, New York.

In 1882, the LVRR began an extensive expansion into New York from Sayre, Pennsylvania (just southeast of Waverly) to Buffalo. Construction from Sayre to Buffalo was split into two projects, Sayre to Geneva, New York, and Geneva, which is located at the northern end of Seneca Lake), to Buffalo. First, it purchased a large parcel of land in Buffalo, the Tifft farm, for use as terminal facilities, and obtained a New York charter for the Lehigh Valley Railway, a similar name to the LVRR, but with &quot;railway&quot; instead. LVRR subsidiary, Lehigh Valley Railway began constructing the main line&#x27;s northern part from Buffalo to Lancaster, New York, in 1883, a total distance of ten miles. This was the second step toward establishment of a direct route from Sayre to Buffalo (thus avoiding the connecting spur to Waverly and on to Buffalo on the Erie), the first being the acquisition of the Geneva, Ithaca &amp; Athens Railroad.

In 1887, the Lehigh Valley Railroad obtained a lease on the Southern Central Railroad (the LVRR previously had trackage rights on the railroad starting in 1870), which had a route from Sayre northward into the Finger Lakes region. At the same time, the LVRR organized the Buffalo and Geneva Railroad to build the rest of the 97-mile Geneva to Buffalo trackage, from Geneva to Lancaster. Finally, in 1889, the LVRR gained control of the Geneva, Ithaca, and Sayre Railroad and completed its line of rail through New York. As a result of its leases and acquisitions, the Lehigh Valley gained a near-monopoly on traffic in the Finger Lakes region.

It also continued to grow and develop its routes in Pennsylvania. In 1883 the railroad acquired land in northeast Pennsylvania and formed a subsidiary called The Glen Summit Hotel and Land Company. It opened a hotel in Glen Summit, Pennsylvania, called the Glen Summit Hotel to serve lunch to passengers traveling on the line. The hotel remained with the company until 1909, when it was bought by residents of the surrounding cottages. 

In New York State, s branch line, the Hayts Corners, Ovid &amp; Willard Railroad opened May 14, 1883 from the Geneva, Ithaca &amp; Sayre to the Willard asylum, and continued in service until 1936.

In Pennsylvania, the Lehigh scored a coup by obtaining the charter formerly held by the Schuykill Haven and Lehigh River Railroad in 1886. That charter had been held by the Reading Railroad since 1860, when it had blocked construction in order to maintain its monopoly in the Southern Coal Field. That southern field held the largest reserves of anthracite in Pennsylvania and accounted for a large percentage of the total production. Through neglect, the Reading allowed the charter to lapse, and it was acquired by the Lehigh Valley, which immediately constructed the Schuylkill and Lehigh Valley Railroad. The line gave the LVRR a route into Pottsville, Pennsylvania, and the Schuylkill Valley coal fields.

The Vosburg Tunnel was completed and opened for service on July 25, 1886. The 16-mile mountain cut-off, a rail segment of the line that extended from Fairview, Pennsylvania, to the outskirts of Pittston, Pennsylvania, was completed in November 1888. This allowed the line&#x27;s eastbound grade to be reduced and a shorter route for handling through traffic established.

The LVRR had built coal docks in Perth Amboy, New Jersey, when it built the Easton and Amboy in the 1870s, but desired a terminal on the Hudson River close to New York City. In New Jersey, the LVRR embarked on a decade-long legal battle with the CNJ over terminal facilities in Jersey City. The land that Asa Packer had obtained in 1872 was situated on the southern side of the Morris Canal&#x27;s South Basin, but the CNJ already had its own facilities adjacent to that property and disputed the LVRR&#x27;s title, which partly overlapped land the CNJ had filled for its own terminal.

Finally in 1887 the two railroads reached a settlement, and construction of the LVRR&#x27;s Jersey City freight yard began. The LVRR obtained a 5-year agreement to use the CNJ line to access the terminal, which opened in 1889. It fronted the Morris Canal Basin with a series of piers angling out from the shoreline but was too narrow for a yard, so the LVRR built a separate yard at Oak Island in Newark to sort and prepare trains. The South Basin terminal was used solely for freight, having docks and car float facilities. Passengers were routed to the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s terminal and ferry.

The LVRR strove throughout the 1880s to acquire its own route to Jersey City and to the Jersey City waterfront. The LVRR decided to expand more to the Northeastern New Jersey in order to reach its freight yards without using the CNJ main line.

The LVRR began construction of a series of railroads to connect the Easton and Amboy line (Easton and Amboy Railroad) to Jersey City. The first leg of the construction to Jersey City was the Roselle and South Plainfield Railway in 1888 which connected with the CNJ at Roselle for access over the CNJ to the Hudson River waterfront in Jersey City. The LVRR, which had built coal docks in Perth Amboy when it built the Easton and Amboy in the 1870s, desired a terminal on the Hudson River close to New York City. In 1891, the LVRR consolidated the Roselle and South Plainfield Railway into the Lehigh Valley Terminal Railway, along with the other companies which formed the route from South Plainfield to the Jersey City terminal.

Initially, the LVRR contracted with the CNJ for rights from Roselle to Jersey City, but the LVRR eventually finished construction to its terminal in Jersey City over the Newark and Roselle Railway, the Newark and Passaic Railway, the Jersey City, Newark, and Western Railway, and the Jersey City Terminal Railway. The LVRR&#x27;s Newark and Roselle Railway in 1891 brought the line from Roselle into Newark, where passengers connected to the Pennsylvania Railroad. Bridging Newark Bay proved difficult. The LVRR first attempted to obtain a right of way at Greenville, but the Pennsylvania Railroad checkmated them by purchasing most of the properties needed. Then the CNJ opposed the LVRR&#x27;s attempt to cross its line at Caven Point. Finally after settling the legal issues, the Newark Bay was bridged in 1892 by the Jersey City, Newark and Western Railway and connected to the National Docks Railway, which was partly owned by the LVRR and which reached the LVRR&#x27;s terminal.

In 1895, the LVRR constructed the Greenville and Hudson Railway parallel with the national docks in order to relieve congestion and have a wholly-owned route into Jersey City. Finally in 1900, the LVRR purchased the National Docks Railway outright.

The 1890s began with the completion of its terminals in Buffalo and Jersey City, and the establishment of a trunk line across New York state, the company soon became entangled in costly business dealings which ultimately led to the Packer family&#x27;s loss of control.

The coal trade was always the backbone of the business but was subject to boom and bust as competition and production increased and the economy cycled. The coal railroads had begun in 1873 to form pools to regulate production and set quotas for each railroad. By controlling supply, the coal combination attempted to keep prices and profits high. Several combinations occurred, but each fell apart as one road or another abrogated its agreement. The first such combination occurred in 1873, followed by others in 1878, 1884, and 1886. Customers naturally resented the actions of the cartel, and since coal was critical to commerce, Congress intervened in 1887 with the Interstate Commerce Act that forbade the roads from joining into such pools. Although the roads effectively ignored the Act and their sales agents continued to meet and set prices, the agreements were never effective for long.

In 1892, the Reading Railroad thought it had a solution. Instead of attempting to maintain agreements among the coal railroads, it would purchase or lease the major lines and bring them into a monopoly. It leased the CNJ and the LVRR, purchased the railroads&#x27; coal companies and arranged for the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad to cooperate with the combination, thereby controlling 70% of the trade. Unfortunately, it overreached and in 1893 was unable to meet its obligations. Its bankruptcy resulted in economic chaos, bringing on the financial panic of 1893 and forcing the LVRR to break the lease and resume its own operations, leaving it unable to pay dividends on its stock until 1904. The economic depression following 1893 was harsh, and by 1897 the LVRR was in dire need of support. The banking giant J. P. Morgan stepped in to refinance the LVRR debt and obtained control of the railroad in the process. Ousting President Elisha P. Wilbur and several directors in 1897, the Morgan company installed W. Alfred Walter as president and seated its own directors. In 1901, Morgan arranged to have the Packer Estate&#x27;s holdings purchased jointly by the Erie, the Pennsylvania, the Lake Shore and Michigan Southern Railway, the DL&amp;W and the CNJ, all companies in which Morgan had interests. Newly elected president Eben B. Thomas, formerly of the Erie, and his board of directors represented the combined interests of those railroads.

A final attempt to establish a coal cartel took place in 1904 with the formation of the Temple Iron Company. Prior to that time, the Temple Iron Company was a small concern that happened to have a broad charter allowing it to act as a holding company. The Reading, now out of receivership, purchased the company and brought the other coal railroads into the partnership, with the Reading owning 30%, the LVRR 23%, the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western 20%, CNJ 17%, Erie 6%, and New York, Susquehanna and Western 4%. The purpose of the Temple Iron Company was to lock-up independent coal production and control the supply. Congress reacted with the 1906 Hepburn Act, which among other things forbade railroads from owning the commodities that they transported. A long series of antitrust investigations and lawsuits resulted, culminating in a 1911 Supreme Court decision that forced the LVRR to divest itself of the coal companies it had held since 1868. The LVRR shareholders received shares of the now independent Lehigh Valley Coal Company, but the railroad no longer had management control of the production, contracts, and sales of its largest customer.

In 1896, the very early film &quot;Black Diamond Express&quot; was produced by Thomas A. Edison&#x27;s company Kinetoscope. The train arrives from far away and passes the camera, while workers are waving their handkerchiefs.

===20th century===

Grain tonnage was increasing and the company transported large quantities from Buffalo to Philadelphia and other Eastern markets. Also, in 1914 the Panama Canal was completed, and the LVRR gained an important new market with ores shipped from South America to the Bethlehem Steel company. In order to handle the additional new ocean traffic, the LVRR created a large new pier at Constable Hook, which opened in 1915, and a new terminal at Claremont which opened in 1923.

It also built a passenger terminal in Buffalo in 1915. Since 1896 the LVRR had run an important and prestigious express train named the &quot;Black Diamond&quot; which carried passengers to the Finger Lakes and Buffalo. Additional passenger trains ran from Philadelphia to Scranton and westward. From the beginning, the LVRR&#x27;s New York City passengers had used the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s terminal and ferry at Jersey City, but in 1913 the PRR terminated that agreement, so the LVRR contracted with the CNJ for use of its terminal and ferry, which was expanded to handle the increased number of passengers. The railroad also published a monthly magazine promoting travel on the train called the &quot;Black Diamond Express Monthly&quot;.

In the war years 1914 to 1918, the Lehigh handled war materials and explosives at its Black Tom island facility, which had been obtained along with the National Docks Railroad in 1900. In 1916, a horrendous explosion occurred at the facility, destroying ships and buildings, and breaking windows in Manhattan. At first the incident was considered an accident; a long investigation eventually concluded that the explosion was an act of German sabotage, for which reparations were finally paid in 1979.

After the U.S. entered World War I, the railroads were nationalized in order to prevent strikes and interruptions. The United States Railroad Administration controlled the railroad from 1918 to 1920, at which time control was transferred back to the private companies. Although the heavy wartime traffic had left the railroad&#x27;s plant and equipment in need of repair, the damage was partly offset by new equipment that had been purchased by the government.

In 1920, the LVRR sold its lake line company, the Lehigh Valley Transportation Line, to private interests due to new federal legislation which stopped the practice of railroads owning lake lines.

Throughout the 1920s the railroad remained in the hands of the Morgan / Drexel banking firm, but in 1928 an attempt was made to wrest control from it. In 1927, Leonor Fresnel Loree, president of the Delaware and Hudson Railroad, had a vision for a new fifth trunk line between the East and West, consisting of the Wabash Railroad, the Buffalo, Rochester and Pittsburgh Railway, and the LVRR. Through bonds issued by the D&amp;H, he obtained 30% of the LVRR stock, and won the support of nearly half the stockholders. In 1928, he attempted to seat a new president and board. A massive proxy fight ensued, with existing President Edward Eugene Loomis narrowly retaining his position with the support of Edward T. Stotesbury of J. P. Morgan.

Following the defeat of its plan, the D&amp;H sold its stock to the Pennsylvania Railroad. In the following years, the Pennsylvania quietly obtained more stock, both directly and through railroads it controlled, primarily the Wabash. By 1931, the PRR controlled 51% of the LVRR stock. Following Loomis&#x27; death in 1937, the presidency went to Loomis&#x27; assistant Duncan J. Kerr, but in 1940 he was replaced by Albert N. Williams, and the road came under the influence of the PRR. In 1941, the Pennsylvania placed its shares in a voting trust after reaching an agreement with the New York Central (NYC) regarding the PRR&#x27;s purchase of the Wabash.

Following the Great Depression, the railroad had a few periods of prosperity, but was clearly in a slow decline. Passengers preferred the convenience of automobiles to trains, and airlines much later provided faster long-distance travel than trains. Oil and gas were supplanting coal as the fuel of choice. The Depression had been difficult for all the railroads, and Congress recognized that bankruptcy laws needed revision. The Chandler Acts of 1938-9 provided a new form of relief for railroads, allowing them to restructure their debt while continuing to operate. The LVRR was approved for such a restructuring in 1940 when several large mortgage loans were due. The restructuring allowed the LVRR to extend the maturity of its mortgages, but it needed to repeat the process in 1950. The terms of the restructurings precluded dividend payments until 1953, when LVRR common stock paid the first dividend since 1931. In 1957, the LVRR again stopped dividends.

In 1944, the LVRR&#x27;s gross revenues came close to $100,000,000 which was a milestone for the railroad.

In the 1950s, the passage of the Federal-Aid Highway Act in 1956, better known as the Interstate Highway Act, and the opening of the Saint Lawrence Seaway in 1959, proved harmful to Lehigh Valley Railroad and the rest of the nation&#x27;s rail industry. Interstate highways helped the trucking industry offer door-to-door service, and the St. Lawrence Seaway allowed grain shipments to bypass the railways and go directly to overseas markets. By the 1960s, railroads in the eastern U.S. were struggling to survive. The Pennsylvania Railroad in 1962 requested ICC authorization to acquire complete control of the LVRR through a swap of PRR stock for LVRR and elimination of the voting trust that had been in place since 1941. They managed to acquire more than 85% of all outstanding shares, and from that time the LVRR was little more than a division of the PRR.

Throughout the 1960s, the PRR was in negotiations to merge with the New York Central, and the ICC approved the merger on the condition that they absorb the bankrupt New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad and the New York, Susquehanna and Western Railroad; only the former was incorporated into the merger. Concurrently, the ICC asked the Norfolk and Western (N&amp;W) and Chesapeake and Ohio (C&amp;O) if they were interested in acquiring the LVRR, and if both companies declined, then the PRR and NYC were obliged to absorb the LVRR, as another condition.

In 1968, the PRR and NYC merged together to create the Penn Central Transportation Company (PC), but following a series of operation problems, the company filed for bankruptcy protection on June 21, 1970, and their obligation to absorb the LVRR fell through. As a result of the bankruptcy, the PC was also relieved of their obligation to pay fees to various Northeastern railroads—including the Lehigh Valley—for the use of their railcars and other operations. Conversely, the other railroads&#x27; obligations to pay those fees to PC were not waived. This imbalance in payments would prove fatal to the financially-frail Lehigh Valley, and the railroad filed for bankruptcy little over one month after PC, on July 24, 1970.

The Lehigh Valley Railroad remained in operation during their 1970 bankruptcy proceedings, as was the common practice of the time. In 1972, the Lehigh Valley Railroad assumed the remaining Pennsylvania trackage of the Central Railroad of New Jersey, a competing anthracite railroad which had also entered bankruptcy. The two railroads had entered a shared trackage agreement in this area in 1965 to reduce costs, as both had parallel routes from Wilkes-Barre to metropolitan New York, often on adjoining grades through Pennsylvania.

Hurricane Agnes in 1972 damaged the rundown Northeast railway network, which put the solvency of other railroads including the LVRR in danger; the somewhat more solvent Erie Lackawanna Railway (EL) was also damaged by the hurricane. In the years leading to 1973, the freight railroad system in the northeastern U.S. was collapsing. While government-funded Amtrak took over intercity passenger service on May 1, 1971, railroads continued to lose money due to extensive government regulations, expensive and excessive labor cost, competition from other transportation modes, declining industrial business and other factors; the Lehigh Valley Railroad was one of them.

That same year, the United States Congress acted to create a bill to nationalize all bankrupt railroads which included the LV. The Association of American Railroads, which opposed nationalization, submitted an alternate proposal for a government-funded private company. President Richard Nixon signed the Regional Rail Reorganization Act of 1973 into law. The &quot;3R Act,&quot; as it was called, provided interim funding to the bankrupt railroads and defined a new &quot;Consolidated Rail Corporation&quot; under the AAR&#x27;s plan.

On April 1, 1976, the LVRR, including its main line, was merged into the U.S. government&#x27;s Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail) ending 130 years of existence and 121 years of operation of the LVRR.

==Surviving segments==
===Background===
====Conrail Ownership====
On April 1, 1976, major portions of the assets of the bankrupt Lehigh Valley Railroad were acquired by Conrail.

This primarily consisted of the main line and related branches from Van Etten Junction (north of Sayre, Pennsylvania) to Oak Island Yard, the Ithaca branch from Van Etten Junction to Ithaca, New York, connecting to the Cayuga Lake line and on to the Milliken power station in Lake Ridge, New York (closed on August 29, 2019) and the Cargill salt mine just south of Auburn, and small segments in Geneva, New York(from Geneva to the Seneca Army Depot in Kendaia), Batavia, New York, Auburn, New York, and Cortland, New York. A long segment west from Van Etten Junction to Buffalo was included in the Conrail takeover, but was mostly torn-up not long afterward. A segment from Geneva to Victor, New York, later cut back to Shortsville, New York, to Victor, remained with the Lehigh Valley Estate under subsidized Conrail operation. The Shortsville to Victor segment became the Ontario Central Railroad in 1979 (the Ontario Central became part of the Finger Lakes Railway in October 2007).

Most of the rail equipment went to Conrail as well, but 24 locomotives (units GP38-2 314-325 and C420 404–415) went to the Delaware &amp; Hudson instead. The remainder of the assets were disposed of by the estate until it was folded into the non-railroad Penn Central Corporation in the early 1980s.

The route across Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Oak Island Yard remains important to the Norfolk Southern Railway and CSX Transportation today, the only two Class 1 railroads that are based in the Eastern United States. This route became important to Conrail as an alternate route to avoid Amtrak&#x27;s former PRR/PC Northeast Corridor electrified route. Today, this route continues as two lines, one that is considered the original line that served as the main line for the Lehigh Valley Railroad and the other that is considered a new line that was once part of the original line that served as the main line for the Lehigh Valley Railroad. The original line retains its original route when it was first constructed and is served by Norfolk Southern Railway. The new line is also served by Norfolk Southern Railway, but it is served together with CSX Transportation in a joint ownership company called Conrail Shared Assets Operations.
Most of the other remaining Lehigh Valley track serves as branch lines, or has been sold to short line and regional operators. 

These operators include: 
*Finger Lakes Railway/Ontario Central Railroad
*Genesee Valley Transportation Company (Depew, Lancaster &amp; Western)
*Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad
*New York, Susquehanna and Western Railway
*Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad

===The Lehigh Line===

The Lehigh Line was the Lehigh Valley Railroad&#x27;s first rail line and served as the main line. It was opened on June 11, 1855, between Easton, Pennsylvania, and Allentown, Pennsylvania, passing through Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Three months later the line branched out to the northwest past Allentown to Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania (then known as Mauch Chunk), on September 12, 1855. The line was later extended out to the northwest past Jim Thorpe to the Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, area and later it reached the Buffalo, New York, area and past Easton all the way to Perth Amboy, New Jersey, and then switched direction to the northeast to Jersey City, New Jersey, later cut back to Newark, New Jersey.

During the early years, the line served as the body of the Lehigh Valley Railroad until the railroad either built, acquired, or merged other railroads into its system. During the majority of its ownership under the Lehigh Valley Railroad, the line was known as the Lehigh Valley Mainline, starting in the 1930s. The line and the rest of the Lehigh Valley Railroad was absorbed into Conrail in 1976 and was maintained as a main line into the New York City area.

The line became known as the Lehigh Line during Conrail ownership. Conrail integrated former CNJ main line leased trackage into the line and kept the line in continuous operation (since 1855); however, it downsized the line in the northwest from the Buffalo area of New York State: first to Sayre Yard in Sayre, Pennsylvania; then to Mehoopany, Pennsylvania; and finally to Penn Haven Junction in Lehigh Township, Carbon County, Pennsylvania. The line&#x27;s being downsized three times created two new rail lines: the Lehigh Secondary and the Lehigh Division, which was later sold to the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad (RBMN) in 1996; the RBMN would later cut back the Lehigh Division from Mehoopany to Dupont, Pennsylvania. The tracks from Dupont to Mehoopany became a new rail line called the Susquehanna Branch.

In 1999, the Norfolk Southern Railway which is owned by the Norfolk Southern Corporation acquired the Lehigh Line in the Conrail split with CSX Transportation but the tracks from Manville, New Jersey, to Newark, New Jersey, were kept with Conrail in order for both Norfolk Southern and CSX to have equal competition in the Northeast. The existing tracks from Manville to Newark became a new rail line and Norfolk Southern along with CSX own it under a joint venture. However, for historical purposes, the part from Manville to Newark is considered a new rail line and the Norfolk Southern part is considered the original line. Now under ownership of the Norfolk Southern Railway, the Lehigh Line&#x27;s route is now from Port Reading Junction in Manville, New Jersey, to Penn Haven Junction in Lehigh Township, Pennsylvania. This is currently the last time the line has been downsized.

===Current operations===

The Lehigh Line still exists and still serves as a major freight railroad line that operates in New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The line is still owned and operated by the Norfolk Southern Railway and the line still runs from Port Reading Junction in Manville, New Jersey, to Penn Haven Junction in Lehigh Township, Pennsylvania. 
The line connects with Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27;s Lehigh Line, the new rail line, and CSX Transportation&#x27;s Trenton Subdivision at Port Reading Junction in Manville, New Jersey, and connects with the Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad&#x27;s Reading Division at Packerton, Pennsylvania, and Reading Blue Mountain and Northern Railroad&#x27;s Lehigh Division, originally M&amp;H Junction, in Lehighton.

The line makes notable connections with other Norfolk Southern lines such as the Reading Line and independent shortline railroads.

At Three Bridges, New Jersey, in Readington Township, the line interchanges with Black River and Western Railroad. At Phillipsburg, New Jersey, the line interchanges with its New Jersey side branch line, the Washington Secondary and the Belvidere and Delaware River Railway which also passes over the Belvidere and Delaware River after that. Across the river in Easton, Pennsylvania, the line interchanges with its Pennsylvania side branch line, the Portland Secondary, which extends from Easton to Portland, Pennsylvania, connecting to the Stroudsburg Secondary, which was originally part of the Lackawanna Old Road (or simply Old Road); the Stroudsburg Secondary goes under the Lackawanna Cut-Off and connects with the Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad.

The line hosts approximately twenty-five trains per day, with traffic peaking at the end of the week. East of the junction with the Reading Line in Allentown and in Bethlehem, the line serves as Norfolk Southern&#x27;s main corridor in and out of the Port of New York and New Jersey, and the New York Metro Area at large, as Norfolk Southern doesn&#x27;t currently use the eastern half of its Southern Tier Line, which follows the Delaware River from Port Jervis north to Binghamton, New York, and which is now (2022) operated by the Central New York Railroad. The line is part of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Harrisburg Division and it is part of Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Crescent Corridor, a railroad corridor. It passes through the approximately 5,000-foot Pattenburg Tunnel in West Portal, New Jersey, along its route. Most of the traffic along the line consists of intermodal and general merchandise trains going to yards such as Oak Island Yard in Newark, New Jersey, and Croxton Yard in Jersey City.

The first locomotive purchased by the LVRR was the &quot;Delaware&quot;, a wood-burning 4-4-0 built by Richard Norris &amp; Sons of Philadelphia in 1855. It was followed by the &quot;Catasauqua&quot; 4-4-0 and &quot;Lehigh&quot; 4-6-0, which were also Norris &amp; Sons engines. In 1856, the &quot;E. A. Packer&quot; 4-4-0 was purchased from William Mason of Taunton, Massachusetts. Subsequently, the LVRR favored engines from Baldwin Locomotive Works and William Mason, but tried many other designs as it experimented with motive power that could handle the line&#x27;s heavy grades.

*In 1866, Master Mechanic Alexander Mitchell designed the &quot;Consolidation&quot; 2-8-0 locomotive, built by Baldwin, which was to become a standard freight locomotive throughout the world. 2-8-0 pattern provided the traction needed for hauling heavy freight, but had a short enough wheelbase to manage curves.
*1945: The first Lehigh Valley Railroad mainline diesels arrive in the form of EMD FT locomotives.
*1948: ALCO PA passenger diesels replace steam on all passenger runs.
*1951: September 14: Last day of steam on the Lehigh Valley Railroad as Mikado 432 drops her fire in Delano, Pennsylvania.

==Passenger operations==
The LVRR operated several named trains in the post-World War II era. Among them:
* No. 11 &quot;The Star&quot;
* No. 4 &quot;The Major&quot;
* No. 7/8 &quot;The Maple Leaf&quot;
* No. 9/10 &quot;The Black Diamond&quot;
* No. 23/24 &quot;The Lehighton Express&quot;
* No. 25/26 &quot;The Asa Packer&quot;, named for the LVRR&#x27;s best-known president
* No. 28/29 &quot;The John Wilkes&quot;

The primary passenger motive power for the LVRR in the diesel era was the ALCO PA-1 car body diesel-electric locomotive, of which the LVRR had fourteen. These locomotives were also used in freight service during and after the era of LVRR passenger service. A pair of ALCO FA-2 FB-2 car body diesel-electric locomotives were also purchased to augment the PAs when necessary. These were FAs with steam generators, but they were not designated as FPA-2 units.

Due to declining passenger patronage, the Lehigh Valley successfully petitioned the Interstate Commerce Commission to terminate all passenger service. This took effect on February 4, 1961. The &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; and the &quot;John Wilkes&quot; were the last operating long-distance trains, terminated that day. The only daylight New York-Buffalo train, the &quot;Black Diamond&quot;, was discontinued in 1959. Budd Rail Diesel Car service would continue on a branch line (Lehighton-Hazleton) for an additional four days. The majority of passenger equipment is believed to have been scrapped some time after February 1961. Most serviceable equipment not retained for company service was sold to other roads.

<text>Beige is variously described as a pale sandy fawn color, a grayish tan, a light-grayish yellowish brown, or a pale to grayish yellow. It takes its name from French, where the word originally meant natural wool that has been neither bleached nor dyed, hence also the color of natural wool.

The word &quot;beige&quot; has come to be used to describe a variety of light tints chosen for their neutral or pale warm appearance.

&quot;Beige&quot; began to commonly be used as a term for a color in France beginning approximately 1855–60; the writer Edmond de Goncourt used it in the novel &quot;&quot; in 1877. The first recorded use of &quot;beige&quot; as a color name in English was in 1887.

Beige is notoriously difficult to produce in traditional offset CMYK printing because of the low levels of inks used on each plate; often it will print in purple or green and vary within a print run.

Beige is also a popular color in clothing, such as for men&#x27;s trousers, as well as for interior design.

==Various beige colors==

===Cosmic latte===
Cosmic latte is a name assigned in 2002 to the average color of the universe (derived from a sampling of the electromagnetic radiation from 200,000 galaxies), given by a team of astronomers from Johns Hopkins University.

===Cream===
Cream is the color of the cream produced by cattle grazing on natural pasture with plants rich in yellow carotenoid pigments, some of which are incorporated into the cream, to give a yellow tone to white.
The first recorded use of &quot;cream&quot; as a color name in English was in 1590. 
===Unbleached silk===
Unbleached silk is one of the Japanese traditional colors in use since beginning in 660 CE in the form of various dyes that are used in designing kimonos.
The name of this color in Japanese is &quot;&quot;. 
===Tuscan===

The first recorded use of Tuscan as a color name in English was in 1887.

===Buff===

Buff is a pale yellow-brown color that got its name from the color of buffed leather.

According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, buff as a descriptor of a color was first used in the &quot;London Gazette&quot; of 1686, describing a uniform to be &quot;A Red Coat with a Buff-colour&#x27;d lining&quot;.

===Desert sand===

The color desert sand may be regarded as a deep shade of beige. It is a pale tint of a color called &quot;desert&quot;. The color name &quot;desert&quot; was first used in 1920.

In the 1960s, the American Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) marketed desert sand–colored telephones for offices and homes. However, they described the color as &quot;beige&quot;. It is therefore common for many people to refer to the color desert sand as &quot;beige&quot;.
===Ecru===

Originally in the 19th century and up to at least 1930, the color ecru meant exactly the same color as beige (i.e. the pale cream color shown above as beige), and the word is often used to refer to such fabrics as silk and linen in their unbleached state. Ecru comes from the French word &quot;&quot;, which means literally &quot;raw&quot; or &quot;unbleached&quot;.

Since at least the 1950s, however, the color ecru has been regarded as a different color from beige, presumably in order to allow interior designers a wider palette of colors to choose from.
===Khaki===
Khaki was designated in the 1930 book &quot;A Dictionary of Color&quot;, the standard for color nomenclature before the introduction of computers.

The first recorded use of &quot;khaki&quot; as a color name in English was in 1848.
===French beige===
The first recorded use of French beige as a color name in English was in 1927.

The for French beige are identical to café au lait and Tuscan tan, which were first recorded as color names in English in 1839 and 1926, respectively.
===Mode beige===
&quot;Mode beige&quot; is a very dark shade of beige.

The first recorded use of &quot;mode beige&quot; as a color name in English was in 1928.

The normalized color coordinates for mode beige are identical to the color names drab, sand dune, and bistre brown, which were first recorded as color names in English, respectively, in 1686, 1925, and 1930.

==In nature==
Fish
* Beige catshark
Mammal
* Beige rabbit

==Metaphor==
Beige is sometimes used as a metaphor for something which is bland, boring, conventional, or even sad. In this sense, it is used in contradistinction to more vibrant and exciting (or more individual) colors.

<doc id="859089" wikidata="Q5468012" url="?curid=859089" title="Ford Y-block engine">
<text>The Y-block engine is a family of small block overhead valve V8 automobile engines produced by Ford Motor Company. The engine is well known and named for its deep skirting, which causes the engine block to resemble a Y. It was introduced in 1954 as a more modern replacement for the outdated side-valved Ford Flathead V8 and was used in a variety of Ford vehicles through 1964.

==Development==
By 1948, the famous Ford Flathead V8 had been developed about as far as it could go,and it was antiquated by the early 1950s. Ford was the most conservative of the major automakers, holding onto older designs longer than GM or Chrysler, but market forces pushed Ford to develop new designs in the 1950s. Management at Ford instructed its engineers to develop a new engine for the future. By 1952 Ford had new, OHV 6-cylinder engine and Lincoln had a OHV V8. The company had designed the Y-block for a 1953 introduction, but a shortage of nickel due to the Korean War&#x27;s needs prevented the company from manufacturing the engine in sufficient quantities, delaying it until 1954.

In 1954 the Y-block displaced , the same as the old Ford Flathead V8 but with a bigger bore and a shorter stroke. It produced as opposed to the Flathead&#x27;s final , an increase of 18%. The Mercury Y-Block was and produced , again a similar displacement to the Mercury Flathead V8 it replaced, but with 29% more power than the older engine&#x27;s .

The original Lincoln V8 was also known as a Y-Block. Lincoln introduced their engine in 1952, but it was a different design from the Ford Y-Block, and was used on large cars and Ford heavy-duty trucks.

One of the design qualities of the Y-Block V8 is its deep skirting which makes for a very rigid block for added strength in the bottom end. The drawback to this is it also makes for a heavy cylinder block. This being Ford&#x27;s first OHV engine, they had to feed oil to the rocker arm shafts through a passage from the center cam bearing. Because of the low detergents in oils of that era these passages would often become clogged giving the Y-Block a reputation for bad oiling to the top end. Ford came up with a stop gap measure for this problem by feeding oil via an external tube directly to the rocker shafts from the main oil gallery.

Cylinder heads on the Y-Block have always been a point for discussion. Because of the configuration of the intake ports, vertically in pairs instead of horizontally side by side, and the way in which they make sharp turns around the head bolts, they have been called “bad breathers”. Although their flow can indeed be inferior, they are nonetheless able to rev to 7,000+ rpm.

Ford Y-blocks are easily identified. The distributor is located at the back of the engine and off to one side and the valve covers are held on with two studs/washers/nuts through the domed tops.

==239==
The first Y-block on Ford automobiles and F100 trucks was the version as released in 1954 with EBU casting numbers. The Y-block was the same displacement as the old Ford Flathead V8 that it replaced but with a bigger bore and a shorter stroke (3.5 x 3.1 in). It produced at 4,200 rpm as opposed to the flathead&#x27;s final at 3,800 rpm, an increase of 18%. Torque was also up compared to the Flathead, with at 1,800 rpm compared with at 2,000 rpm. The Y-block was considered a major advancement over the flathead. The 239 was available in 1954 models (EBU casting numbers), and in late 1954 and 1955 (EBV casting numbers), while also in 1955 the bigger 272 and 292 cubic inch siblings were introduced. The 1955 EBV 239 engine exchanges many parts with later model Y-blocks such as the 272 and 292, while the 1954 EBU engine has many parts that do not exchange with the 1955 EBV 239 and later Y-blocks.

==256==
The original Mercury Y-block, introduced for the 1954 model year, displaced . Advertised as the &quot;V-161&quot; engine, it ran a bore and stroke of 3.625 x 3.1 in. The compression ratio was 7.5:1, and the rated power was at 4,400 rpm. Torque was at 2,200 rpm. The engine breathed through a Holley model 2140 (4V) carburetor. The 256 version of the Mercury Y-block was only available in 1954 models and was replaced by the 292 in 1955. The 256 was also used in some F100s in 1955 depending on the production plant location and was also installed in law enforcement sedans.

==272==
By 1955 Chevrolet introduced its small block V8 with , not to be outdone Ford increased its displacement to and introduced the Thunderbird with a engine. The version of the Y-Block was the same bore as the outgoing Mercury 256 cubic inch Y-Block but with a longer stroke (3.625 x 3.3 in). The standard 1955 U-code featured a two barrel Holley carburetor and was rated at at 4,400 rpm and at 2,400 rpm. The optional &quot;Power Pack&quot; M-code used a four barrel Holley carburetor and was rated at at 4,400 rpm.

In 1956 the U-code was updated to produce at 4,400 rpm and at 2,400 rpm with a manual transmission behind it or at 4,400 rpm and at 2,400 rpm with an automatic transmission. The M-code 272 was dropped altogether in 1956 in favour of a four barrel M-code version of the 292.

A final version of the 272 in the US was released in 1957 as the B-code. It featured a two barrel Holley carburetor and was rated at at 4,500 rpm and at 2,700 rpm.

Ford Australia released this V8 motor as its only option in the four-door Customline sedan from 1955-1959 (based on the Canadian Meteor), and its coupé utility, based on the same styling as the Customline, called a Mainline. It was introduced in passenger cars in July 1955, and in the redesigned truck lineup one month later. In late 1956 the Australian 272 switched to a four bolt 2 barrel Autolite carburetor.

This engine, as well as the 292 version starting in 1956, was also produced by Ford of Brazil at its São Paulo plant facility (Ipiranga plant). A new building was opened on November 21, 1958, by the Brazilian President, Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira, to produce the first Ford engine in South America. The 272 version was used on Brazilian F-series trucks until 1977 and on the Brazilian Galaxie 500, launched in April 1967.

==292==

The Y-Block was also introduced in 1955. The 292 shared the 3.3 in (83.82 mm) stroke of the 272 but with a larger 3.75 in (95.25 mm) bore. It was used in the Ford Thunderbird, 1959-60 Edsel, Mercury, and some high-end Ford cars. The Ford version was the P-code &quot;Thunderbird V8&quot;, which for cars equipped with a manual transmission had a compression ratio of 8.1:1 and was rated at at 4,400 rpm and with at 2,600 rpm. Cars equipped with an automatic transmission had a slightly higher compression ratio of 8.5:1 with a quoted at 4,400 rpm and at 2,500 rpm.

The Mercury division had two versions of the 292 available in 1955. The standard engine had a 7.6:1 compression ratio and was rated at at 4,400 rpm, with of torque at 2,500 rpm. The top of the range Montclair V8 came with a higher specification version that was rated at 4,400 rpm and at 2,500 rpm. 1955 would be the only model year that Mercury would use the 292 in version of the Y-Block, with it being replaced by the larger 312 in engine for the 1956 model year.

In 1956 Ford replaced the P-code 292 with a new &quot;Thunderbird Special V8&quot; version of the Y-Block, while the M-code 272 was replaced with a new M-Code specification of the 292. This M-code &quot;Thunderbird V8&quot; 292 was now optional on all Fords. The engine when fitted behind manual transmission vehicles had an 8.0:1 compression ratio and was rated at at 4,600 rpm and at 2,600 rpm, whilst the automatic featured an 8.4:1 compression ratio with a rating of at 4,600 rpm and at 2,600 rpm.

All Ford Y-Blocks were up on power for the 1957 model year. The 292 was available as the C-code engine option, once again with a slight difference between the manual transmission and &quot;Fordomatic&quot; automatic transmission. Compression was up to 9.1:1 in manual cars, which were rated at 4,500 rpm and at 2,700 rpm. Automatic vehicles were rated at 4,500 rpm, torque and compression ratio are not listed in the Ford 1957 workshop manual as being any different from the manual car, which seems unlikely given the power difference at the same engine speed.

The 292 would be the longest-lived of the Y-Blocks, carrying on until 1962 in U.S. cars and until 1964 in U.S. trucks. It was also used in Argentina in the F-100 pick-up well into the 1960s, and was known as Fase I (Phase I). In 1971, the engine was modified to accept a new-style cylinder head with a different valve arrangement (E-I-E-I-E-I-E-I versus E-I-I-E-E-I-I-E), new intake and exhaust manifolds and was renamed Fase II (Phase II). In this form, the 292 Fase II continued into the 1980s in the F-100, and was also used in the Argentine Ford Fairlane (built from 1969–1982, and based heavily on the U.S. 1968 model). All Argentine versions of this engine feature a cast crankshaft rather than the forged example that equipped US heavy-duty engines. The 292 version was also produced by Ford of Brazil and equipped the Brazilian LTD starting in 1969. Both the 272 and 292 engines were replaced on Brazilian cars by the 302 windsor family engine starting on 1976 model year.

==312==
The V8 engine came out for the 1956 model year and was again used in high-end Ford and Mercury cars, including the Thunderbird.

Bore x stroke dimensions were .

Depending on model year and application, the 312 was available with a single two- or four-barrel Holley carburetor, two four-barrel carburetors and with or without a McCulloch (Paxton) supercharger (1957 only).

All 1956 U.S. Mercury models were powered by the V8 breathing through a four-barrel carburetor. At the beginning of the model year, a version with 8.0:1 compression ratio powered Mercury cars with manual transmissions (including three-speed plus overdrive), while a version powered cars with automatic transmissions. The 225-horsepower version had an 8.4:1 compression ratio. Later in the model year, a version with 9.0:1 compression ratio became available. All 1956 Mercury engines had gold-painted blocks and heads. The 210-horsepower version had red valve covers and air cleaner, while the 225-horsepower version had blue valve covers and air cleaner. The 235-horsepower version had argent silver valve covers and air cleaner. A dealer-installed &quot;M 260&quot; engine kit was released in January 1956. The kit consisted of a hotter camshaft, revised cylinder heads, and an intake manifold mounting two four-barrel carburetors. The kit was advertised as boosting the Mercury 312 V8 to .

Not generally known, about 40% of these 312s were equipped with vacuum secondary CARTER WCFBs. They are a highly desired version, as the Holleys were cantankerous.

The 312s had no centrifugal timing advance in their distributors until 1957. 

The last regular application of the 312 V8 in the U.S. was for certain 1960 Mercury models. Though considered to be a high-performance engine in 1956 and 1957, it was downgraded to an &quot;economy&quot; engine with low compression and two-barrel carburetor by 1960. Ford pickups used the version as late as 1965.

==Replacement==

When Ford Y-block debuted its power making ability was already hindered by its inherent displacement limit. A quick reference to the engine specifications for 1955-57 shows the Ford V8s ahead of the Chevrolet counterparts in displacement, horsepower, and torque. However, larger CID V8 engines made by Cadillac, Chrysler, Buick, Pontiac and Oldsmobile clearly showed the small CID architecture of the Y-block would need revision in order to keep pace with the other automakers. 

Even with the benefit of today&#x27;s technology (aftermarket rods and stroker cranks), the upper limit of a Y-block is about , while the Chevrolet could be modified well past the factory limit of . The result was the introduction in 1958 of the 332 CID &quot;big block&quot; Ford FE engine which ultimately grew to 428 cu in. Later, in 1962, the Ford Windsor engine – which began at would fully replace the Y-Block and grow to .

<text>William Price (1619–1691) was a Welsh politician who sat in the House of Commons in two periods between 1640 and 1679. He fought as a Royalist colonel in the English Civil War.

==Biography==
Price was the elder son of John Price of Rhiwlas and his wife Eleanor Jones, daughter of Sir William Jones of Castle March Carnarvonshire. He entered Christ Church, Oxford, on 27 May 1636 aged 16.
In November 1640, Price was elected Member of Parliament for Merioneth in the Long Parliament. He was a Colonel in Royal Army in Civil War and was disabled from sitting in parliament in 1644. However he retained the family estate under Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s protectorate. 

On the Restoration, Price was nominated as Knight of the Royal Oak having an estate of £1500 per annum. He was elected MP for Merioneth again in 1677 for the Cavalier Parliament and sat until 1679. He became JP for Flintshire in 1680.

Price died in 1691 and was buried in St Asaph Cathedral.

<text>Joseph Kaspar Mertz (17 August 1806 – 14 October 1856) was a guitarist and composer from the Austrian Empire.

==Biography==
Caspar Joseph Mertz (baptised Casparus Josephus Mertz) was born in Pressburg, now Bratislava (Slovakia), then the capital of the Kingdom of Hungary and part of the Austrian Empire. He never used his full name when performing or on his publications, preferring only the initials &quot;J. K.&quot;. The name &quot;Johann Kaspar&quot; first appeared in the German guitar journal &quot;Der Guitarrefreund&quot; in 1901 and since that time has been incorrectly repeated. In 1900 J. M. Miller used the name &quot;Joseph K. Mertz&quot; for his publication of three previously unpublished manuscripts of Mertz in &quot;Three Compositions For Guitar&quot;.

He was active in Vienna (c.1840–1856), which had been home to various prominent figures of the guitar, including Anton Diabelli, Mauro Giuliani, Wenceslaus Matiegka and Simon Molitor. As virtuoso, he established a solid reputation as a performer. He toured Moravia, Poland, and Russia, and gave performances in Berlin and Dresden. In 1846 Mertz nearly died of an overdose of strychnine that had been prescribed to him as a treatment for neuralgia. Over the following year he was nursed back to health in the presence of his wife, the concert pianist Josephine Plantin whom he married in 1842. Some speculation may lead one to the conclusion that listening to his wife performing the romantic piano pieces of the day during his period of recovery may have had an influence on the sound and unusual right hand technique he adopted for the &quot;Bardenklänge&quot; (Bardic Sounds) op. 13 (1847).

Mertz&#x27;s guitar music, unlike that of most of his contemporaries, followed the pianistic models of Liszt, Chopin, Mendelssohn, Schubert and Schumann, rather than the classical models of Mozart and Haydn (as did Sor and Aguado), or the bel canto style of Rossini (as did Giuliani). Though the date of his birth indicates that that was the logical influence, since Sor was born in 1778, Aguado in 1784 and Giuliani in 1781 while Mertz in 1806, a difference of about 25 years.

The &quot;Bardenklänge&quot; are probably Mertz&#x27;s most important contribution to the guitar repertoire (a series of character pieces in the mould of Schumann), together with the great fantasias &quot;La rimembranza&quot;, &quot;Pensée fugitive&quot; and &quot;Harmonie du soir&quot;, considered a trilogy, the most technically demanding pieces written by Mertz, clearly inspired by Liszt&#x27;s piano music.

The portrait of J. K. Mertz first appeared on the cover of Erwin Schwarz-Reiflingen&#x27;s 1920 book &quot;Altmeister der Gitarre: Johann Kaspar Mertz.&quot; There was no attribution for the source, but in Schwarz-Reiflingen&#x27;s commentary he mentions the duo &#x27;Fantasie aus der oper &quot;Elisier d&#x27;amour&#x27; came as a previously unpublished manuscript from Edward Bayer, Jr., son of the well-known guitarist Edward Bayer. It is possible, yet unconfirmed, that the portrait could also have come from the estate of Edward Bayer. The grayscale reproductions of the portrait have all come from a photo the Japanese guitar collector Jiro Nakano took in the 1970s from a copy of &quot;Altmeister der Gitarre: Johann Kaspar Mertz&quot; in the collection of Morishige Takei. It was provided to Astrid Stempnik for her dissertation by Masami Kimura. Originals of this book are only known to exist in the Takei Collection (at the Kunitachi College of Music, Tokyo, Japan), Bickford Collection (at California State University, Northridge) and The Danish Music Museum.

<text>Forbidden knowledge, which is different from secret knowledge, is used to describe forbidden books or other information to which access is restricted or deprecated for political or religious reasons. Forbidden knowledge is commonly not secret, rather a society or various institutions will use repressive mechanisms to either completely prevent the publication of information they find objectionable or dangerous (censorship), or failing that, to try to reduce the public&#x27;s trust in such information (propaganda). Public repression can create paradoxical situations where the proscribed information is generally common knowledge but publicly citing it is disallowed.

A rich set of examples exist through history. 
* The Roman Catholic church forbids publication of books to which it has not granted Imprimatur.
*Throughout the years of isolation in Japan and China all Western literature was forbidden. 
*Certain 20th century governments (e.g. communist nations in Eastern Europe and China) placed strong restrictions on foreign publications.
* In the United States, conservative groups including Jerry Falwell&#x27;s Moral Majority made several attempts to censor pro civil-rights and feminist works such as Our Bodies, Ourselves.
In many cases this resulted in people defending themselves by creating political jokes. Jokes throughout history have been a powerful instrument to undermine state authority and the public truth associated with it.

==Sociological and political relevance==

Some form of public repression of facts or speculation not desirable to some people or even a majority of the population seems inevitable as societies need to create some common basis of facts to create a unified identity. Critical to political and personal freedom is the level to which this repression is organized through the state or powerful private organizations. Western secular societies have reached the consensus through the late 19th and early 20th centuries that private organizations should not be allowed to engage in compulsory censorship, forcing people to obey their dictates. For example, the separation of church and state in most Western societies mostly prevents religious organizations from repressing individuals based on their personal opinions and beliefs. As well, people are generally allowed to leave employment with a company which may regulate such personal expressions for whatever reason and find employment in less restrictive circumstances.

<doc id="859103" wikidata="Q8017083" url="?curid=859103" title="William Price (physician)">
<text>William Price (4 March 1800 – 23 January 1893) was a Welsh physician and political activist best known for his support of Welsh nationalism, Chartism and involvement with the Neo-Druidic religious movement. Historians have characterised Price as one of the most significant figures in Wales during the Victorian era.

Born into a working class family in Rudry, Caerphilly, Price underwent medical training in London before returning to Wales, becoming interested in the Chartists&#x27; ideas regarding democracy and civil and political rights for all men. Following the failed Chartist Newport Rising in 1839, he escaped prosecution by fleeing to France, where he became convinced that an ancient prophecy predicted that he would achieve Welsh independence from the United Kingdom.

Returning to Wales, Price tried reviving what he believed to be the religion of the ancient druids, Celtic ritualists active during the Iron Age. In doing so, he became one of the most prominent proponents of the Neo-Druidic movement, something that had been developing since Iolo Morganwg&#x27;s activities in the late 18th century. After cremating his dead son in 1884, Price was arrested and put on trial by those who believed cremation was illegal under English law. He successfully argued that there was no legislation that specifically outlawed it, which paved the way for the Cremation Act 1902. Upon his death, he was cremated in a ceremony watched by 20,000 onlookers.

Known for adhering to beliefs such as supporting equal rights for all men, vegetarianism, vaccine hesitancy and cremation, and opposition to vivisection and marriage, some of which were highly controversial at the time, he has been widely known as an &quot;eccentric&quot; and a &quot;radical&quot;. Since his death he has been remembered by some people as &quot;one of the great Welshmen of all time&quot;. A permanent exhibition and statue dedicated to him has been inaugurated in the town of Llantrisant, where he had lived for much of his later life.

== Biography ==

=== Early life: 1800–1821 ===
William Price was born in a cottage at the farm (&#x27;the smallholding of the hedged field&#x27;, ) near Rudry near Caerphilly in Glamorganshire on 4 March 1800. His father, also named William Price (b. 1761), was an ordained priest of the Church of England who had studied at Jesus College, Oxford. It is believed that he was a descendent of Ellis Price, the grandchild of , a Welsh nobleman chiefly known for his valour at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485, where he fought on the side of Henry VII. His mother, Mary Edmunds (1767–1844), was an uneducated Welshwoman who had worked as a maidservant for his paternal grandmother prior to his parents&#x27; marriage. Their marital union was controversial because Mary was of a lower social standing than William, something which was socially taboo in late 18th-century British society. They married at Machen church. In a &quot;South Wales Star&quot; article in 27 January 1793, children of the congregation recalled that after the procession, William&#x27;s father (who was full of glee) ran onto the road dancing and pointing her out, shouted: &quot;&quot; (&quot;I have taken her, look!, look!.&quot;) . The couple had three other surviving children, Elisabeth (1793–1872), Mary (1797–1869) and Ann (1804–1878).

The elder Price suffered from an undiagnosed mental illness, acting erratically and experiencing fits of violent rage. He bathed either fully clothed or naked in local ponds, and collected snakes in his pockets for days at a time. Carrying a saw around, he removed bark from trees, then burned it while muttering certain words, also spitting onto stones, believing that it improved their value. His actions led to him becoming a threat to the local community; in one instance he fired a gun at a woman whom he claimed was taking sticks from his hedgerow, and in another hurled a sharp implement at another man.

At home, Welsh was William&#x27;s primary language, but he learned to speak English at school, which was located two miles from his home, in Machen. Although only staying at school for three years, between the ages of 10 and 13, he passed most exams and proved himself a successful student. After spending six months living at home, he decided to become a doctor despite his father&#x27;s insistence that he become a solicitor. Moving to Caerphilly, in 1814 he became apprenticed to successful surgeon Evan Edwards, and paid for his tuition with money supplied by various family members. One of these benefactors, his uncle the Reverend Thomas Price of Merriott, Somerset, advised him to give up this education, arguing that it was putting too great a financial strain upon Price&#x27;s family, but William was insistent that he should continue.

In 1820, Price&#x27;s apprenticeship with Edwards came to an end, and despite his lack of funds, he moved to London in order to continue his studies. Taking up lodgings near to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, he entered The London Hospital in Whitechapel for a year of instruction under Sir William Blizard. He also registered at St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital, where he was under the instruction of surgeon John Abernethy. Gaining employment caring for wealthy clients to help financially support his studies, Price eventually became a member of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, being awarded with a certificate signed by Blizard, Abernathy and others. Contemplating travelling to India following the culmination of his studies in London, he instead decided to return to Wales, where he worked as a general practitioner.

=== Welsh nationalism and Chartism: 1821–1839 ===
Early in his career, Price returned to Wales, where he was employed at Pentyrch Ironworks as a medical attendant. At this time he lived at a property nearby which he named (&#x27;island of the black lions&#x27;) which was sometimes referred to as the &#x27;Ynys house&#x27;.

Becoming a trained doctor, he then set up his medical practice at in Glyntaff, remaining there for seven years.

He later rented a farm in Upper Boat called (&#x27;coal port&#x27;) which was owned by the son of a solicitor, Mr Grover. Price filled his farm with goats and cattle which ate and inflicted considerable damage to green trees around the property and throughout the neighbourhood, which prompted his landlord to serve him an eviction notice, which William dismissed. Mr Grover initiated an action of ejection after Price refused to leave. As a consequence and with &quot;intense popular excitement&quot;, all of his animals were set loose onto the highway. Price, who was protesting his right to stay, secured himself onto his chair in the furthest room in the house refusing to leave, was carried out in his chair and was then placed outside on the road.

He subsequently moved to the newly industrialised Taff Valley near to Pontypridd. It was here in 1823 that the workforce elected him to the position of chief surgeon at the Brown Lenox Chainworks in Pontypridd; he stayed in this job until 1871. In June 1823 he was also appointed medical advisor to the wealthy Crawshay family who owned the ironworks at Merthyr and Treforest. Spending time in Treforest, &quot;a revolutionary town&quot;, he came under the increasing influence of left-wing political ideas. Being a proud Welsh nationalist, Price found likeminded friends in another wealthy family, the Guests, and gave a speech on Welsh history and literature at their Royal in 1834, which Lady Charlotte Guest felt to be &quot;one of the most beautiful and eloquent speeches that was ever heard&quot;. On the basis of it, he was invited to take up the job of judging the eisteddfod&#x27;s bardic competition, with the prize being awarded to Taliesin Williams, son of famous druid and Welsh nationalist .

Price became increasingly interested in Welsh cultural activities, which included those that had been influenced by the Neo-Druidic movement. During his life, due to his extensive research into druidism, he would often be confused with a Welsh bard; Evan Davies (Myfyr Morganwg). He joined the Society of the Rocking Stone, a Neo-Druidic group that met at the stone circle in Pontypridd, and by 1837 had become one of its leading members. To encourage the revival of Welsh culture, he gave lessons every Sunday in Welsh, which he feared was dying out with the spread of the English language. In 1838 he also called for the Society to raise funds to build a Druidical Museum in the town, the receipts from which would be used to run a free school for the poor. He was supported in this venture by Francis Crawshay, a member of the Crawshay family, but did not gain enough sponsors to allow the project to go ahead. In anger, he issued a statement in a local newspaper, telling the people that they were ignoring &quot;your immortal progenitors, to whom you owe your very existence as a civilised people.&quot;

Meanwhile, Price&#x27;s social conscience had led him to become a significant figure in the local Chartist movement, which was then spreading about the country, supporting the idea that all men should have the right to vote, irrespective of their wealth or social standing. Many of the Chartists in the industrial areas of southern Wales took up arms in order to ready themselves for revolution against the government, and Price aided them in gaining such weaponry. According to government reports, by 1839 he had acquired seven pieces of field artillery. That same year, the Newport Rising took place, when many of the Chartists and their working class supporters rose up against the authorities, only to be quashed by soldiers, who killed a number of the revolutionaries. Price had recognised that this would happen, and he and his supporters had not joined in with the rebellion on that day. Nonetheless, he also realised that the government would begin a crackdown of those involved in the Chartist movement in retaliation for the uprising, and so he fled to France, disguised as a woman, there he became fluent in French.

=== Life as an archdruid: 1840–1882 ===
It was while in temporary exile as a political dissident in Paris that Price visited the Louvre museum, where he experienced what has been described as &quot;a turning-point in his religious life.&quot; He became highly interested in a stone with a Greek inscription that he erroneously felt depicted an ancient Celtic bard addressing the moon. He subsequently interpreted the inscription as a prophecy given by an ancient Welsh prince named Alun, declaring that a man would come in the future to reveal the true secrets of the Welsh language and to liberate the Welsh people; however, historian Ronald Hutton later remarked, &quot;nobody else had heard of this person, or made (anything like) the same interpretation of the inscription&quot;. Nonetheless, Price felt that this prophecy applied to him and that he must return to Wales to achieve Welsh independence from the United Kingdom.

Soon returning to Wales, Price set himself up as a druid, founding a religious druidic group that attracted a number of followers. Little is known of the specific doctrines which he preached, but his followers walked around carrying staffs engraved with figures and letters. Declaring that marriage was wrong as it enslaved women, he began having a relationship with a woman named Ann Morgan, whom he moved in with, and in 1842 they had a daughter. He baptised this child himself at the Rocking Stone in Pontypridd, naming her Gwenhiolan Iarlles Morganwg (meaning &#x27;Gwenhiolan, Countess of Glamorgan&#x27;). He began developing an appearance that was unconventional at the time, for instance wearing a fox fur hat (signifying his healing powers as a doctor) and emerald green clothing, as well as growing his beard long and not cutting his hair. He also began attempting to hold Druidic events, organising an eisteddfod at Pontypridd in 1844, but nobody turned up, and so, solitarily, he initiated his daughter as a bard at the event. In 1855 he then led a parade of the Ivorites, a friendly society that held to a philosophy of Welsh nationalism, through the streets of Merthyr Tydfil, accompanied by a half-naked man calling himself Myrddin (the Welsh name for Merlin) and a goat.

Returning to his long-held idea of building a museum and school at Pontypridd, a local landowner, Sir Benjamin Hall, who wanted to encourage the revival of Welsh culture, allowed him to use his own land, although Price and the Halls subsequently fell out and the project was scrapped. Left with debts from the aborted project, Price once more escaped to France in 1861. Around this time, he began writing to the national press, making exaggerated statements about himself and Welsh history, for instance claiming that he was Lord of the Southern Welsh and that &quot;All the Greek Books are the Works of the Primitive Bards, in our own Language!!!!!!!… Homer was born in the hamlet of Y Van near Caerphili. He built Caerphili Castle… the oldest Books of the Chinese confess the fact!!&quot;

In 1866, Price returned to Wales, finding that his daughter had grown up to live her own life following her mother, Ann Morgan&#x27;s, death. He settled in the town of Llantrisant, where he opened a new medical practice, which proved to be a success. He eventually took a young farmer&#x27;s daughter, Gwenllian Llewelyn, (1859–1948) who at the time was only twenty-one years old, to be his new partner, despite the fact that he was an old man by this time. Despite his earlier pronouncements against marriage, he organised a druidic wedding ceremony through which he married Gwenllian on 4 March 1881, on Price&#x27;s 81st birthday. Taking place at the Rocking Stone in Pontypridd, it involved Price addressing the sun at noon, and women dressed as the Three Graces were involved. The ceremony attracted a large audience, who, according to reports, found the whole proceeding amusing. Meanwhile, in 1871, he had published a book, written in his own invented form of Welsh that he believed was the true language of the ancient Welsh. In the work, which had a title that translated as &quot;The Will of My Father&quot;, Price conceptualised the universe being created out of a snake&#x27;s egg by a supreme Father God. However, this work was largely ignored at the time and soon fell into obscurity.

=== Later life and advocacy of cremation: 1883–1893 ===
Price proclaimed himself a &#x27;High priest of the sun grown old&#x27; and via a &#x27;druidic prophecy&#x27; and feeling dissatisfied that he had not produced a son that would succeed him, he sought out a virgin to copulate with; Gwenllian (or shortened to &#x27;Gwen&#x27;), who was 18 at the time, was chosen as his new partner. Gwen and Price&#x27;s first child was born on 8 August 1883, a son whom Price named Iesu Grist (the Welsh for Jesus Christ) because he deemed him to be a young Esus or Hu Gadarn of Britain. He expected great things from his child and some believed that the chosen name was an act of provocation against the traditional religion of the time. The infant only lived for five months when on 10 January 1884 he died from an unknown cause. Believing that it was wrong to bury a corpse, thereby polluting the earth, Price decided to cremate his son&#x27;s body, an act which at the time was taboo, although across the country there were already several proponents of it as a form of corpse disposal. On the afternoon of Saturday, 12 January 1884, men who had been employed by Price carted wood, coal and a cask of pitch to the top of the (Caerlan) hill east of Llantrisant which Price owned. In the evening of the following day, wearing white robes, he carried his son in his arms up towards the summit, placed his body down on the heap with his head facing the West, Price chanted &#x27;a strange requiem&#x27; and then proceeded the funeral by setting the pile on fire. A number of local people who were on their way back home from church noticed the fire who then congregated around it, it was said that it was a moving sight, however upon discovering that Price was attempting to burn his infant son, Sergeant Tamblyn and his officers rushed through the crowd, snatched the baby from the fire, kicked the pile in the effort of extinguishing it and promptly arrested him for what they believed was the illegal disposal of a corpse. The body of his son, which had not yet been fully engulfed by the flames was removed from the pyre. The baby was placed in a hamper with straw in with his head facing downwards with his legs projecting upwards through the straw.

A post-mortem was performed on Iesu&#x27;s body by a local doctor, who concluded that the child had died of natural causes and had not been murdered. Price was therefore not charged with infanticide, but was instead tried in a Cardiff courtroom for performing cremation rather than burial, which the police believed to be illegal. Price argued that while the law did not state that cremation was legal, it also did not state that it was illegal either. The judge, Mr. Justice Stephen, agreed. Price was freed, and returned to Llantrisant to find a crowd of supporters cheering for his victory. On 14 March, he was finally able to give his son a cremation involving his own personal Druidic prayers. The case set a precedent which, together with the activities of the recently founded Cremation Society of Great Britain, led to the Cremation Act 1902. In 1885 the first official cremation of the remains of Jeanette Pickersgill (1814–1885) took place at Woking Crematorium, and ten cremations are recorded as being performed in the following year. A crematorium opened in Manchester in 1892, followed by one in Glasgow in 1895, Liverpool in 1896 and Birmingham Crematorium in 1903.

The media interest in the court case had made Price famous, and he soon began to capitalise on this fame, selling three hundred medals, each depicting the cosmic egg and the snake that laid it, commemorating his victory, which sold at threepence each. He began to be invited to give lectures and attend public functions, but these did not prove to be particular successes, with much of his audiences not understanding either his philosophies, or his attire, which was made out of red cloth and embroidered with green letters.

In late 1884, Price&#x27;s wife gave birth to their second child, whom Price also named Iesu Grist, and on 27 May 1886 she then bore him a daughter, whom they named Penelopen. He believed that his son had an important future ahead of him, being the prophesied second coming of Jesus Christ, his namesake, and predicted that he would come to reign over the earth. Gwen separated from William a few years before his death but continued looking after their children. Meanwhile, in 1892 he erected a pole which was over 60 feet high, with a crescent moon symbol at its peak, on top of Caerlan hill where his first son had been cremated, and noted that he wanted his funeral to take place there as well.

Price died at his home in Llantrisant on the night of 23 January 1893. His final words, when he knew that he was near death, were &quot;Bring me a glass of champagne&quot;. He drank the champagne and died shortly afterward. On 31 January 1893, Price was cremated on a pyre of a timber core and two tons of coal, in accordance with his will, on the same hillside overlooking Llantrisant. It was watched by 20,000 people, and overseen by his family, who were dressed in a mix of traditional Welsh and his own Druidic clothing, it was noted, as accordance to his will and testament, that; &#x27;no attempt shall be made to preserve the ashes of the body, but that they shall be &quot;spread all over the earth to help the grass and flower to grow&quot;&#x27;. His wife remarried, this time to a road inspector employed by the local council, and she gave up her Druidic beliefs to join a conventional Christian denomination, having her two children baptised into it, and Iesu Grist was renamed Nicholas, never fulfilling the ambitious predictions that his father had made about him.

== Personal beliefs ==
Price held several strongly held beliefs that ran counter to the Victorian social norms of the time, and chose to promote them in a &quot;most exhibitory fashion&quot;. Biographer Dean Powell considered him &quot;a maverick and a rebel&quot;, but was unsure whether Price&#x27;s eccentricity were a result of mental illness or not.

A nudist, Price refused to wear socks, considering them to be unhygienic, and washed coins, fearing that they were a source of cross-contamination. He opposed vaccination, in part due to his brother&#x27;s childhood death following an inoculation, and refused to treat patients who were tobacco smokers. He advocated vegetarianism, believing that eating meat &quot;brought out the beast in man&quot;, and denounced vivisection. Price opposed marriage, which he saw as the enslavement of women, instead advocating free love. Price also argued many fellow practitioners were nothing but &#x27;poison peddlers&#x27;, making their money selling drugs and profiting off the sick rather than tackling the cause of the illness.

Price was also responsible for the building of the famous &quot;Round houses&quot; in Pontypridd. He convinced a local builder that he owned the land and these round houses were to be the gateway to his mansion, although he owned neither the land nor a mansion.

Price believed that religion was often used to enslave people, and despised &quot;sanctimonious preachers&quot;. His religious beliefs have influenced the modern druidic movement. Michell referred to him as &quot;a natural shaman&quot;.
== Legacy ==
Soon after Price&#x27;s death, ballads commemorating him were composed and circulated throughout the local area for a number of years afterward. In 1896, an exhibition that commemorated his life was held in Cardiff, while a pamphlet biography of him was published to accompany it. A more significant biography of Price, written by Islwyn Nicholas, was published in 1940, entitled &quot;A Welsh Heretic&quot;. In 1947, the Cremation Society put up a plaque commemorating him in the town of Llantrisant, while a statue of him was unveiled in the town in 1982, depicting the doctor in his characteristic fox-skin headdress, arms outstretched. This was followed in 1992 when a memorial garden was named after him, and an exhibition about him opened in the town&#x27;s visitor centre.

In a 1966 book examining the history of Llantrisant, author Dillwyn Lewis described Price as being &quot;one of the most controversial figures of modern times.&quot; The historian Ronald Hutton later described him as &quot;both one of the most colourful characters in Welsh history, and one of the most remarkable in Victorian Britain&quot; while his biographer Dean Powell considered him &quot;the most notable individual in 19th century Wales&quot;.

A commemorative green plaque was installed at Rudry Parish Hall in 2017 near Price&#x27;s birthplace.

In 2020, American actor Robert Downey Jr. cited Price as his inspiration for his portrayal of Dr Dolittle in the new Hollywood adaption &quot;Dolittle&quot;. Downey received harsh criticism for his Welsh accent in the film. As journalist Will Humphries reported for The Sunday Times: &quot;... when a Hollywood actor tries to do so in a Welsh accent inspired by a nudist Victorian druid, perhaps it&#x27;s best that he doesn&#x27;t speak at all.&quot;

<text>Mauro Giuseppe Sergio Pantaleo Giuliani (27 July 1781 – 8 May 1829) was an Italian guitarist, cellist, singer, and composer. He was a leading guitar virtuoso of the early 19th century.

== Biography ==

Although born in Bisceglie, Giuliani&#x27;s center of study was in Barletta where he moved with his brother Nicola in the first years of his life. His first instrumental training was on the cello—an instrument which he never completely abandoned—and he may have also studied the violin. Subsequently, he devoted himself to the guitar, becoming a skilled performer on it in a short time. The names of his teachers are unknown.

He married Maria Giuseppe del Monaco, and they had a child, Michael, born in Barletta in 1801. After that he was possibly in Bologna and Trieste for a brief stay. By the summer of 1806, fresh from his studies of counterpoint, cello and guitar in Italy, he had moved to Vienna without his family. There he began a relationship with the Viennese Anna Wiesenberger (1784–1817), with whom he had four daughters, Maria Willmuth (born 1808), Aloisia Willmuth (born 1810), Emilia Giuliani-Guglielmi (born 1813) and Karolina Giuliani (born 1817).

In Vienna he became acquainted with the classical instrumental style. In 1807, Giuliani began to publish his own compositions. His concert tours took him all over Europe, and he was acclaimed for his virtuosity and musical taste. He achieved significant success and became a musical celebrity, equal to the best of the many instrumentalists and composers who were active in the Austrian capital city at the beginning of the 19th century.

Giuliani defined a new role for the guitar in the context of European music. He was acquainted with the highest figures of Austrian society and with notable composers such as Rossini and Beethoven, and cooperated with the best active concert musicians in Vienna. In 1815 he appeared with Johann Nepomuk Hummel (followed later by Ignaz Moscheles), the violinist Joseph Mayseder and the cellist Joseph Merk, in a series of chamber concerts in the botanical gardens of Schönbrunn Palace, concerts that were called the &quot;Dukaten Concerte&quot;, after the price of the ticket, which was a ducat. This exposure gave Giuliani prominence in the musical environment of the city. Also in 1815, he was the official concert artist for the celebrations of the Congress of Vienna. Two years earlier, on 8 December 1813, he had played (probably cello) in an orchestra for the first performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Seventh Symphony.

In Vienna, Giuliani had minor success as a composer. He worked mostly with the publisher Artaria, who published many of his works for guitar, but had dealings with other local publishers who spread his compositions across Europe. He developed a teaching career here as well; among his numerous students were Jan Nepomucen Bobrowicz and Felix Horetzky.

In 1819 Giuliani left Vienna, mainly for financial reasons: he expected to make financial profit on a concert tour through Bohemia and Bavaria. He returned to Italy, spending time in Trieste and Venice, and finally settled in Rome. In 1822 he brought his illegitimate daughter Emilia to Italy, who had been born in Vienna in 1813. She was educated at the nunnery &quot;L&#x27;adorazione del Gesù&quot; from 1821 to 1826, together with Giuliani&#x27;s first illegitimate daughter Maria Willmuth. In Rome he had little success, publishing only a few compositions and giving only one concert.

In July 1823 he began a series of trips to Naples to be with his father, who was seriously ill. In the Bourbon city of Naples, Giuliani would find a better reception to his guitar artistry, and was able to publish other works for guitar with local publishers.

In 1826 he performed in Portici before Francesco I and the Bourbon court. During this Neapolitan period, he appeared frequently in duo concert with his daughter Emilia, who had become a skilled performer on the guitar. Toward the end of 1827 his health began to fail; and he died in Naples on 8 May 1829.

===Quotes===

== Works ==
===Theme and variations===
As a guitar composer he was very fond of the theme and variations— an extremely popular form in Vienna. He had a remarkable ability to weave a melody into a passage with musical effect while remaining true to the idiom of the instrument.
*One example of this ability is to be found in his Variations on a theme of Handel, Op. 107. This popular theme, known as &quot;The Harmonious Blacksmith&quot;, appears in the &quot;Aria&quot; from Handel&#x27;s Suite no. 5 in E for harpsichord.
*Another example is Giuliani&#x27;s &quot;Sei variazioni sull&#x27;aria &quot;A Schisserl und a Reindl&quot;&quot;, op. 38, which is a set of variations on the Austrian folk song &quot;A Schisserl und a Reindl, is åll mein Kuchlg&#x27;schirr&quot;, used in the play &quot;Der Kaufmannsbude&quot; (1796), with music by Johann Baptist Henneberg (1768–1822) and text by Schikaneder; and in the play &quot;Der Marktschreyer&quot; (1799), with music by Franz Xaver Süssmayr (1766–1803) and text by Friedrich Karl Lippert. (Beethoven used the same theme in his work op.105, number 3 for flute and piano.)
*His three-movement sonata Op. 15 is a clever, witty work and one of the most developed examples of the genre for guitar.
*The several sets of extended &quot;Rossiniana&quot; reside at the pinnacle of nineteenth-century operatic pot pourri for guitar.

Giuliani&#x27;s achievements as a composer were numerous. Giuliani&#x27;s 150 compositions for guitar with opus number constitute the nucleus of the nineteenth-century guitar repertory. He composed extremely challenging pieces for solo guitar as well as works for orchestra and Guitar-Violin and Guitar-Flute duos.

Significant pieces by Giuliani include his three guitar concertos (op. 30, 36 and 70); a series of six fantasias for guitar solo, op. 119–124, based on airs from Rossini operas and entitled the &quot;Rossiniane&quot;; several sonatas for violin and guitar and flute and guitar; a quintet, op. 65, for strings and guitar; some collections for voice and guitar, and a Grand Overture written in the Italian style. He also transcribed many symphonic works, both for solo guitar and guitar duo. One such transcription arranges the overture to &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; by Rossini, for two guitars. There are further numerous didactic works, among which is a method for guitar that is used by modern teachers.

Today, Giuliani&#x27;s concertos and solo pieces are widely performed by professionals.

=== Original sources of themes ===
Giuliani arranged many 19th century opera themes for the guitar, e.g. from the opera &quot;Semiramide&quot; by Gioachino Rossini. His work &quot;Le Rossiniane&quot; also includes numerous themes from the operas of Rossini.

==Pedagogy==

Giuliani is the only guitarist of the first generation of classical guitar who did not publish a method. However, he left behind a vast collection of studies and exercises that are still used in a guitarist&#x27;s early training today:

* Op.1- &quot;Studio per la chitarra&quot; (&quot;Studio&quot; for the guitar)
** Part One, for the right hand (120 Right Hand Studies)
** Part Two, for the left hand
** Part Three, ornaments etc.
** Part Four, twelve progressive lessons
* Op.48 - &quot;Esercizio per la chitarra, contenente 24 pezzi della maggiore difficoltà, diversi preludi, passagi, ed assolo&quot; (Exercise for the guitar, containing 24 pieces of the greatest difficulty, including various preludes, passaggi, and solo pieces)
* Op.51 - &quot;XVIII Leçons Progressives&quot; (Eighteen Progressive Lessons)
* Op.98 - &quot;Studi Dilettevoli ossia Raccolta di vari Pezzi Originali&quot; (Delightful Studies, or, Collection of various Original Pieces)
* Op.100 - &quot;Etudes instructives, faciles, et agréables… contenant un Recueil de Cadences, Caprices, Rondeaux, et Préludes&quot; (Instructive, easy, and agreeable studies… containing a collection of cadences, caprices, rondos, and preludes)
* Op.139 - &quot;24 Prime Lezioni, Parte prima&quot; (24 First Lessons, Part 1)
** Only six studies were ever published in this collection–not 24, and no part 2.

==Instruments used by Giuliani==
Of the instruments used by Giuliani, there are guitars made by:
*&quot;possibly:&quot; Gennaro Fabricatore, (Naples 1809)     (now in the collection of Gianni Accornero)At the bottom of the guitar, one can see the initials M G. The guitarcase also has the initials M G.
*&quot;briefly:&quot; Pons l&#x27;Aîné (Joseph Pons), (Paris 1812)This Pons guitar was made for Archduchess Marie Louise of Austria in Paris 1812, and later given to Giuliani: is known to have been in Giuliani&#x27;s possession only briefly. Giuliani later gave it to the amateur guitarist Christopher Bilderbeck de Monte as a present. However, Giuliani did not often play this 1812 guitar: it hardly shows signs of use.
*&quot;unlikely:&quot; Pons l&#x27;Aîné (Joseph Pons), (Paris 1825)     (now in the collection of Gianni Accornero)The back cover of a CD claims &quot;Giuliani&#x27;s original Guitar Pons l&#x27;Aîné 1825&quot;. Though this is probably a deceptive and possibly intentionally ambiguous claim. Gianni Accornero wrote the CD&#x27;s liner notes about the guitar, and claims: &quot;This instrument is in actual fact identical to the one which Joseph had made for Empress Marie-Louise of Habsburg, the wife of Napoleon, who later gave it to Giuliani. This instrument became one of his favourites. Not only the model is the same, but also are the different types of wood used for its construction.&quot; However Paul Pleijsier is critical of these claims; and has found flaws and inconsistencies in Accornero&#x27;s claims. Pleijsier states that there is no evidence that Giuliani ever played the 1825 Pons.Eduardo Catemario (the performer on the CD) notes &quot;E` interessante notare che questa Pons è molto simile (per non-dire identica) a quella di Giuliani&quot; (&quot;It is interesting to note that this Pons is very similar (if not identical) to that of Giuliani&quot;).

<text>Wightwick Manor ( ) is a Victorian house in Wightwick Bank, a suburb of Wolverhampton, West Midlands, England. It was commissioned in 1887 from the architect Edward Ould by Theodore Mander of Mander Brothers, a Wolverhampton paint and varnish manufacturer. It stands adjacent to the Old Manor, a late sixteenth or early seventeenth-century building that was the original residence on the site.

The house is significant as an example of a domestic building constructed, decorated, and furnished under the influence of the Aesthetic movement and Arts and Crafts movement. It contains many examples of the works of William Morris and his firm Morris &amp; Co., including wall hangings, wallpapers, and upholstery; tiles designed by William De Morgan; and stained glass designed by Charles Kempe. It also contains Pre-Raphaelite works of art, including works by Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Evelyn De Morgan, Edward Burne-Jones, Ford Madox Brown, John Everett Millais, Elizabeth Siddal, and Leonard Shuffrey. 

Much of the collection in the house was assembled by Sir Geoffrey and Lady Rosalind Mander, who inherited it in 1900. They gave the house and grounds to the National Trust in 1937, but continued adding to the contents until their deaths in 1962 and 1988 respectively. The property is open to the public, although the Mander family retain the use of an apartment. The Old Manor houses the De Morgan Gallery, an exhibition of the works of Evelyn and William De Morgan.

==History==

The oldest building on the site is the Old Manor, which incorporates elements of a medieval house and which was built in two stages around the turn of the seventeenth century by Francis Wightwick and his son, Alexander. The Wightwick family took their name from the estate and owned it from at least the thirteenth century until 1815, when it was sold to the Hinkes family. In 1887 it was sold again to (Samuel) Theodore Mander.

The Mander family became established in Wolverhampton in the mid-eighteenth century, when Thomas Mander moved to the town from Warwickshire. His son, Benjamin Mander, established a japanning and tinplate works in 1773, which became Mander Brothers and expanded into the manufacture of paints under his grandsons, Charles and Samuel Mander. Their sons, Charles and Theodore respectively, became company directors in 1879. In the same year, Theodore married Flora, the daughter of Henry Nicholas Paint, a merchant and member of the Parliament of Canada.

After purchasing Wightwick, Theodore commissioned Edward Ould of Liverpool to design a new house. This was completed in 1887, and consisted of the western half of the present house and a single-storey west wing containing a billiard room. Notes taken by Theodore Mander at a lecture given in Wolverhampton in 1884 by Oscar Wilde on the &#x27;House Beautiful&#x27; inspired Wightwick&#x27;s interiors. Taking inspiration from this lecture, Theodore and his wife Flora decorated its interiors with the designs of William Morris and his Arts and Crafts contemporaries. However, the Pre-Raphaelite collection was mostly assembled after the house was donated to the National Trust, particularly by Geoffrey Mander and his second wife, Rosalie, who was an art historian.

The house had no guest bedrooms and proved too small by 1893, when the billard room was demolished and a new east wing built. This approximately doubled the size of the building, and, as well as five guest bedrooms, contained a living-room called the &#x27;great parlour&#x27;, a dining room, and a replacement billiard room. The elaborate pendant imitation Jacobean plaster ceiling in the dining room was designed by Leonard Shuffrey.

In 1937, Geoffrey Mander, a radical Liberal MP and local paint manufacturer who had been left the timber-framed house by his father Theodore, persuaded the National Trust to accept a house that was just 50 years old, under the Country Houses Scheme Act. 

This house of the Aesthetic Movement was, by 1937, a relic of an out of fashion era. Yet, so complete was the design that it was worthy of preservation. Having given the house to the Trust, Geoffrey Mander and his second wife, Rosalie, became its live-in curators, opening the house to the public and adding to its contents. In particular, they added a notable collection of Pre-Raphaelite paintings by Rossetti, Burne-Jones and their followers. Descendants of the family retain a private apartment in the manor.

==House, art collection and gardens==
The Manor has the work of 13 professional female artists on permanent public display, more than any other in the National Trust, including notable examples of works by Lizzie Siddal, Lucy Madox Brown, Marie Spartali Stillman, and May Morris. Most of these artworks were collected by the Manders. The malthouse gallery now houses a group of works by Evelyn De Morgan and her husband William, on loan from the De Morgan Foundation.

The house has 17 acres of woodland and gardens, and the outbuildings include parts of an earlier Jacobean manor house, stables (now a tea room), a gallery in the old malt house, gift shop, and a second-hand bookshop. 

It is situated just off the main A454 Wolverhampton to Bridgnorth road, approximately three miles to the west of the city centre.

The manor has been Grade I listed on the National Heritage List for England since July 1950, and its gardens are Grade II listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

<text>Pleasant Hill, Kentucky, USA, is the site of a Shaker religious community that was active from 1805 to 1910. Following a preservationist effort that began in 1961, the site, now a National Historic Landmark, has become a popular tourist destination.

Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill, or Shakertown, as it is known by residents of the area, is located 25 miles (40 km) southwest of Lexington, in Kentucky&#x27;s Bluegrass region. It is a National Historic Landmark District.

==History==

===Founding===
The Second Great Awakening began in the late 1700s and continued into the early 19th century. A revival was characterized by large camp meetings, where ministers from various Protestant groups would preach for long periods, with music and dancing often adding to the emotional pitch of the congregation. These religious gatherings sometimes drew thousands of observers and participants in the Ohio Valley of Kentucky. They were a form of community for people living scattered in relative isolation on the frontier the rest of the time.
st
The powerful interest in religion sweeping the region inspired the Shakers to broaden their ministry into Kentucky. Lucy Wright, the head of the Shakers&#x27; parent Ministry at New Lebanon, New York, decided to send missionaries west.

On January 1, 1805, with eleven Shaker communities already established in New York and New England, three Shaker missionaries, John Meacham, Benjamin Seth Youngs (older brother of Isaac N. Youngs), and Issachar Bates, set out to find new converts. Traveling more than a thousand miles, most of the way on foot, they joined the pioneers then pouring into the western lands by way of Cumberland Gap and the Ohio River.

By August, they had gathered a small group of new adherents to the doctrine of Mother Ann Lee who believed in celibacy. Ann Lee was born February 29, 1736, in Manchester, England. She was a member of the Quaker sect called the Shaking Quakers. She ran afoul of the law and was imprisoned for trying to teach her sect&#x27;s beliefs. During her time in prison, she claimed to have a vision that she herself was the second coming of Christ.

Upon her release in 1772, she founded a new religious sect, which came to be commonly known as the Shakers because of the adherents&#x27; dancing and motions in worship. She taught that God was a dual personage, male and female, instead of the masculine-orientated traditional belief in an all-male trinity. She interpreted the passage in Genesis that stated &quot;So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female, created he them,&quot; to mean that both sexes were in God&#x27;s image therefore God was both male and female.

She acknowledged that Jesus was the first coming of the messiah but believed the second coming had already occurred with herself, Ann Lee, based on her vision. Thus Shakers believed they were living in the last millennium and since all people shared a brother/sister relationship, they should not marry as there was no longer a need to procreate. Instead they believed people should live communally as a family of brothers and sisters.

Couples joining the community lived separately, with their young children and foundlings raised in a nursery. Children could decide whether to remain in the community when they reached the age of maturity. Many of those proselytes had earlier been influenced by the fervent Cane Ridge Revival.

In December 1806, forty-four converts of legal age signed a covenant agreeing to mutual support and the common ownership of property. They began living together on the farm of Elisha Thomas, whose lands formed the nucleus of the Pleasant Hill Shaker village. Additional converts and property were quickly added, with the community occupying .

By 1812 three communal families—East, Center, and West—had been formed, and a fourth, North, was established as a &quot;gathering family&quot; for prospective converts. On June 2, 1814, 128 Believers bound themselves together in a more formal covenant, which established the community in the pattern of the Shaker Ministry&#x27;s village at New Lebanon, New York.

===Early years===
Though the Kentucky Shakers were poor when they started out, they were skilled farmers who made the most of their property. Even the most skeptical observers saw that they prospered, in part because of the high quality of their products. In 1852, a visitor wrote that every article of Shaker produce sold for a third more than what other farmers received.

Another reason for their prosperity was their location, which was ideal for marketing their produce and home manufactures. By 1816, they regularly traveled the rivers to larger cities (some at great distances, such as New Orleans) to sell their wares.

The Pleasant Hill Shakers raised broom corn and made flat brooms so good that they sold for more than &quot;ordinary&quot; brooms. They also raised fruit and sold it dried or as preserves (more than ten tons of preserves in one year). Like many other Shaker communities, they raised and sold garden seeds.

By 1825, the Pleasant Hill Shaker village was a handsome community with large stone and brick dwellings and shops, grassy lawns, and stone sidewalks. One visitor, though dubious about their mode of worship, was impressed by their prosperity and delighted by their hospitality. He concluded that they were a &quot;trafficking, humane, honest and thrifty people.&quot;

Over the years they expanded their land holdings by acquiring adjacent farms for orchards and fields, and fenced it with stone walls. According to a visitor in 1857, they had paid a hired man for twelve years to work full-time at building stone walls, and he had completed forty miles of walls, at a cost to the Shakers of about $1000 per mile. Their buildings were large, substantial, and well-built, and furnished with modern conveniences.

The Pleasant Hill community was known for its excellent livestock. In 1838, Shaker John Bryant sold one pair of Berkshire hogs for $500. In the 1850s they kept about 500 head of well-fed cattle, and bred imported cows to improve their herd&#x27;s milk production. They practiced selective breeding and scientific agriculture well before the average farmer did. They also raised Saxony sheep for the wool, which Shaker sisters spun and wove into cloth for home use.

The Pleasant Hill Shakers were also known for their labor-saving engineering accomplishments. They had a municipal water system well before some towns in their area. By 1825 they had pumps in their kitchens for the sisters&#x27; convenience (at a time when many farmwives had to carry water from a creek). Their mill had an elevator for moving grain to the upper floor, and they had a mechanical corn sheller.

Shaker sisters also had the benefits of machinery for doing laundry by horse power.

One of their barns included an upper floor for storage of grain and hay, a cutting machine for chopping fodder, and an ingenious railway for delivering feed to the cattle.

===Through the Civil War and Reconstruction era===
The Kentucky Shakers&#x27; locations, however, were problematic during the American Civil War.

Even before the war began, the Pleasant Hill Shakers ran into controversy. The New York-based religious organization had a policy of pacifism and was also opposed to slavery. Members who made up the Pleasant Hill society mostly came from the region and, as a result, &quot;may&quot; have had a variety of views on the war and slavery, although this cannot be proven by the sources. Formally they adhered to the principles of the Shakers. The Shakers at Pleasant Hill adopted the practice of buying and freeing slaves. In 1825, because of mounting tensions over slavery in Pleasant Hill&#x27;s surrounding community, a mob attacked Pleasant Hill and destroyed some of its facilities.

While members of Pleasant Hill were sympathetic to the Union, their Southern location made them the target of some neighbors and bands of extremists. (This experience was relatively similar to the Koinonia situation during the Civil Rights Movement.) Pleasant Hill was at risk during the war, although it did not suffer as much damage as its sister colony at South Union, Kentucky.

The Civil War depleted Pleasant Hill&#x27;s resources. The members of Pleasant Hill fed thousands of soldiers who came begging, particularly in the weeks surrounding the Battle of Perryville. Both armies &quot;nearly ate [them] out of house and home.&quot; They also lost manpower when some young Shaker brethren left to join the army.

More importantly, the social environment and cultural changes in the decades before and after the war made Shaker life less appealing for converts. During Reconstruction and later, very few new converts joined the Shakers.

===Last days===
Kentucky Shakers had a number of problems after the Civil War, which had sapped their communities&#x27; strength. They continued to take in orphans, but few stayed past the end of their indentures. So-called &quot;Winter Shakers&quot;, impoverished locals feigning interest in joining the colony during the cold season, were a drain on the village, and rarely earned their keep. Apostasy increased.

As membership declined, the Shakers began closing communities and consolidating Believers into the remaining villages. Pleasant Hill, which had once had almost five hundred members, dwindled away. By 1875, despite an influx of new proselytes from Sweden , it had fewer than half that number. In 1900, only 34 remained. The Pleasant Hill Shaker community was dissolved in 1910.

Its last surviving Believer was Mary Settles (1836–1923). She was pleased to live long enough to see women&#x27;s suffrage and planned to vote a straight Democratic ticket on her first ballot. She said that Shaker sisters had always had equal rights within their communal society.

==Life at Pleasant Hill==

Many visitors to Pleasant Hill, observing the nineteenth-century architecture, crafts, and clothing, mistakenly assume that the Shakers, like the Amish, rejected technological advancements. In fact, the Shakers were inventors or early adopters of many new tools and techniques. For example, in the early 1830s the Shakers of Pleasant Hill constructed a water tower on a high plot of ground. A horse-drawn pump lifted water into the tower, and from there a system of pipes conveyed it to the kitchens, cellars, and wash houses. It is believed to have been the first in the state. In the wash houses, the members built washing machines (also powered by horses) to reduce the heavy work of laundering the community&#x27;s clothes and linens.

Music was an important part of Shaker life, with the community performing songs, hymns and anthems written by both men and women. One of the best known songs is &quot;Gentle Words&quot;, written by Polly M. Rupe in the 1860s. It includes a quote from the Bible ().

==Preservation effort==
Following the dissolution of the Shaker society in 1910, the property changed hands several times and was used for a variety of purposes. Elderly Shakers continued to live on the property until the death in 1923 of Mary Settles, the last Pleasant Hill Believer.

The Meeting House was converted for use as an automotive garage; the wood floor, built to withstand the dancing of several hundred brethren and sisters, proved strong enough to support the vehicles driven onto its surface. Some years later the structure was again converted, this time for use as a Baptist church.

Following World War II, residents in the region took a renewed interest in the crumbling village of Pleasant Hill. An admirer was the writer Thomas Merton, a Trappist monk at the nearby Abbey of Gethsemani. Having mentioned Pleasant Hill in his writings as early as 1949, Merton took considerable interest in the community from his first visit there in 1959 until his death in 1968. Describing his first look inside the Trustee&#x27;s Office in 1959, Merton wrote in his journal to describe:
[T]he marvelous double winding stair going up to the mysterious clarity of a dome on the roof ... quiet sunlight filtering in—a big Lebanon cedar outside one of the windows ... All the other houses are locked up. There is Shaker furniture only in the center family house. I tried to get in it and a gloomy old man living in the back told me curtly &#x27;it was locked up.&#x27; The empty fields, the big trees—how I would love to explore those houses and listen to that silence. In spite of the general decay and despair there is joy there still and simplicity ... Shakers fascinate me.

Others shared his interest. In 1961, a group of Lexington-area citizens led by Joseph Graves and Earl D. Wallace launched an effort to restore the property. By 1964 the Friends of Pleasant Hill had organized a non-profit corporation, raised funds for operating expenses, and secured a $2 million federal loan to purchase and restore the site. James Lowry Cogar, a former Woodford County resident and first curator of Colonial Williamsburg, was recruited to oversee the complex preservation project.

Today, with 34 original 19th-century buildings and 2,800 acres (1100 hectares) of farmland, Shaker Village of Pleasant Hill claims to be &quot;the largest historic community of its kind in America.&quot;

<text>Kailasam Balachandar (9 July 1930 – 23 December 2014) was an Indian playwright, film director, film producer, screenwriter and actor who worked mainly in the Tamil cinema. He was well known for his distinct film-making style, and the Indian film industry knew him as a master of unconventional themes and hard-hitting contemporary subject matter. Balachander&#x27;s films are well known for their portrayal of women as bold personalities and central characters. Popularly referred to as &quot;Iyakkunar Sigaram&quot; (lit. &quot;Director Paramount&quot;), his films are usually centred on unusual or complicated interpersonal relationships and social themes. He started his film career in 1964 as a screenwriter and graduated to a director with &quot;Neerkumizhi&quot; (1965).

In a career that spanned 50 years, he had contributed to nearly 100 feature films either as a screenwriter or director, thus becoming one of the most prolific filmmakers in the country. Known among his colleagues as a tough task master, he was credited with having nurtured numerous actors, notably Nagesh, Sujatha, Kamal Haasan, Rajinikanth, Chiranjeevi, Jaya Prada, Sridevi, Jayasudha, Saritha, Renuka, Nassar, Prakash Raj, Ramesh Aravind and Vivek.

In his film career, Balachander had won 9 National Film Awards, 11 Tamil Nadu State Film Awards, 
five Nandi Awards and 13 Filmfare Awards. He was honored with the Padma Shri (1987), India&#x27;s fourth highest civilian award, and the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, India&#x27;s highest award in cinema.

He also made films under his production house, Kavithalaya Productions. Apart from Tamil, he made films in other languages such as Telugu, Kannada and Hindi. Towards the tail end of his career, he directed a few TV serials and made a few film appearances as well.

==Early life and background==
K. Balachander was born in Tanjore district (now Tiruvarur district), India. Balachander stated that, &quot;From my eighth year I&#x27;ve been seeing cinema&quot; and recalls that his earliest interest towards cinema grew after watching films of M. K. Thyagaraja Bhagavathar, then the Superstar of Tamil cinema. At the age of twelve he was drawn to theatre and drama, which eventually helped him develop an interest in acting, writing and directing amateur plays. His obsession towards theatre continued even while doing his graduation (in Zoology) at the Annamalai University, as he regularly took part in stage plays. After completing his graduation in 1949, he started his career as a school teacher in Muthupet, Tiruvarur district. In 1950, he moved to Madras (now Chennai) and joined the Accountant General&#x27;s office as an apprentice clerk, and during this time he joined &quot;United Amateur Artistes&quot;, an amateur drama company. Soon he formed his own troupe and it was during this time he came to prominence as an amateur playwright with &quot;Major Chandrakanth&quot;, written in English. As the scope of English was highly limited in Madras, he re-wrote the play in Tamil, which ultimately became a &quot;sensation&quot; among the people. Balachander&#x27;s acting troupe consisted of people from the Tamil film industry such as Major Sundarrajan, Nagesh, Srikanth and Sowcar Janaki. Sunderrajan appeared in over 900 films, Nagesh in over 1,000, Sreekanth in more than 200 films, and Sowkar Janaki appeared in more than 350 films. Other plays written by Balachander include &quot;Server Sundaram&quot; (&quot;Waiter Sundaram&quot;), &quot;Neerkumizhi&quot; (&quot;Water Bubble&quot;), &quot;Mezhuguvarthi&quot; (&quot;Candle&quot;), &quot;Naanal&quot; (&quot;Tall Grass&quot;) and &quot;Navagraham&quot; (&quot;Nine Planets&quot;). All these produced and directed by him, were received well by the critics.

==Career==

===Entry into films: 1960s===
Balachander while working in the Accountant General&#x27;s office, was offered to write the dialogues for the film &quot;Dheiva Thaai&quot; (1964) by its lead actor M. G. Ramachandran. Balachander was initially reluctant, as he was more theatre-oriented, but on the insistence of his friends he decided to work on the film. By this time he was promoted as a superintendent in his office. Avichi Meiyappa Chettiar acquired the rights of his play &quot;Server Sundaram&quot;, and decided to make a film based on it. The film dealt with the story of a waiting staff at a restaurant had Nagesh playing the lead. The film was directed by the renowned duo directors, Krishnan–Panju. It won a lot of accolades including the Certificate of Merit for the third Best Feature Film in Tamil and Filmfare Award for Best Tamil Film. During this time another play written and directed by him - &quot;Major Chandrakanth&quot; was adapted into a film in Hindi as &quot;Oonche Log&quot;. The film won a National Film Award. Balachander then made his directional debut through &quot;Neerkumizhi&quot; (1965) which in turn was based on his own play. The film&#x27;s cast consisted of actors who were a part of Balachander&#x27;s regular troupe. His following efforts included &quot;Naanal&quot;, &quot;Major Chandrakanth&quot; and &quot;Ethir Neechal&quot;, all based on his own plays. &quot;Major Chandrakanth&quot; was already filmed in Hindi as &quot;Oonche Log&quot; the previous year. &quot;Major Chandrakanth&quot; had Jayalalithaa playing the lead heroine role. In 1967 he made &quot;Bama Vijayam&quot;, a full-length comedy family drama film. Featuring an ensemble cast, the film was highly successful and remade in Telugu by Balachander himself. The success of both the versions prompted a Hindi remake titled &quot;Teen Bahuraniyan&quot;, produced by Gemini pictures. In 1969, Balachander made &quot;Iru Kodugal&quot;, a family drama starring Gemini Ganesan, won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil.

===1970s===
During the 1970s, Balachander turned indie, making realist movies revolving around family and social issues. In 1971 he made four films.

In 1973, he made &quot;Arangetram&quot;, which dealt with poverty and prostitution. The film centred on the eldest daughter of a conservative Brahmin household who becomes a prostitute to settle her siblings and support her family. It was ahead of its time in Tamil cinema mainly because of the controversial theme. The film also had Kamal Haasan playing his first major role as an adult actor. The actor would go on to act in 35 films under Balachander. He made his directorial debut in Hindi films with the film &quot;Aaina&quot; starring Mumtaz and Rajesh Khanna in 1977, which was remake of &quot;Arangetram&quot;.

The same year, he made &quot;Sollathaan Ninaikkiren&quot;, based on a novel by Manian. The following year he made &quot;Naan Avanillai&quot;. He made the film on the insistence of Gemini Ganesan, who also produced and enacted the lead role. It is based on the Marathi play &quot;To Mee Navhech&quot;, revolved around a man who deceives and marries five women performing nine roles. The film met with commercial failure. However, Gemini Ganesan was adjudged the Best Tamil Actor at the following year&#x27;s Filmfare Awards ceremony. Following that, Balachander&#x27;s made &quot;Aval Oru Thodar Kathai&quot; (1974), his second female-centric film after &quot;Arangetram&quot; that dealt with the story of a working woman who hails from a middle-class family. Inspired by the 1960 Bengali film &quot;Meghe Dhaka Tara&quot;, it explored the emotions of a young woman who happens to be the sole earner for her family. He decided to cast an actress who worked as a child actress till then, as his film heroine with the film Mondru Moodichu and gave break to Sridevi. The film &quot;Aboorva Raagangal&quot; was an original story about an inter-generational romance involving two families. It marked the acting debut of Rajinikanth, who would go on to establish himself as a leading actor. It won critical acclaim in spite of its controversial theme; it won three National Film Awards including the award for the &quot;Best Feature Film in Tamil&quot;.

During this period he made films mostly with Kamal Haasan as the lead actor. In 1976, he made three films: &quot;Manmadha Leelai&quot;, &quot;Anthuleni Katha&quot; and &quot;Moondru Mudichu&quot;. &quot;Manmadha Leelai&quot; explores the life of a womaniser, played by Kamal Haasan, who gets himself involved in affairs with women. Often considered ahead of its time, it achieved cult status and is considered a &quot;trendsetter&quot; in Tamil cinema. &quot;Anthuleni Katha&quot;, a Telugu remake of &quot;Aval Oru Thodar Kathai&quot; had Jaya Prada in her first starring role. received equal acclaim in Andhra Pradesh as in the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. &quot;Avargal&quot; (1977) follows the life of a divorcée as she traverses relationships in reverse, from divorce, to marriage, to falling in love. &quot;Varumayin Niram Sigappu&quot; (1980) was a drama that charts the travails and conflict of being unemployed in a bombastic and harsh city. &quot;47 Natkal&quot; (1981) traces the adversities of a newlywed Indian woman living with an scurrilous, expatriate husband in a Parisian suburb. The film was a launchpad for its lead actor Chiranjeevi.

===Bollywood success and Tamil film career 1981-99===

Balachander re-entered the Hindi film industry after &quot;Aaina&quot; through &quot;Ek Duuje Ke Liye&quot; in 1981. He gave Rati Agnihotri her debut Hindi film with Ek Duje Ke Liye. The project was a remake of his own Telugu film &quot;Maro Charitra&quot; had Kamal Haasan repeating his role as a lead actor. The film marked the Bollywood debut of various artists including Kamal Haasan, Madhavi and S. P. Balasubrahmanyam. Like the original, &quot;Ek Duuje Ke Liye&quot; emerged as a major box-office success and earned critical acclaim. Balachander received the Filmfare Award for Best Screenplay, apart from two other nominations – for Best Director and Best Story. The song &quot;Tere Meere Beach Mein&quot; became so popular, eventually winning a Filmfare Award for Anand Bakshi and a National Film Award for Balasubrahmanyam.

==Style, critique and public perception==
Balachander is revered as one of the best directors India has ever produced. His ideas were original and his subjects were complex ideas expressed via art. He is also known for introducing new faces to the film industry. He has introduced over 100 actors in Tamil, Telugu and Kannada languages. Balachander had long associations with some senior artists in the South Indian film industry like Gemini Ganesan, Sowcar Janaki, Nagesh and Muthuraman. Even though he was not the one to discover them, he played a prominent role in shaping their careers.

Kamal Haasan and Rajinikanth, two leading film actors in Tamil cinema, are often referred to as products of Balachander who has paired with each of them or worked with them as a trio in several films during the 1970s. Rajinikanth was chosen by Balachander to play a key supporting character in &quot;Apoorva Raagangal&quot; (1975) after noting that &quot;there was something special about him&quot;. Sridevi, Srividhya, Jayapradha, Jayasudha, Jayachithra, Sujatha, Saritha were notable heroines that were introduced by Balachander. Nassar, Delhi Ganesh, Charlie, Madan Bob were some of the notable supporting actors introduced by him. After working in a few Kannada films, Prakash Raj was relaunched as an actor in Tamil cinema through his debut &quot;Duet&quot; (1994) and had also performed in some of Balachander&#x27;s soap opera productions in the 1990s. Through &quot;Manathil Uruthi Vendum&quot;, Balachander launched Vivek as an actor, who initially worked with him as his assistant writer, and later went on to become a leading comedy actor. He also launched A.R. Rahman in the film Roja which was his production.

When the old era was dominated by commercial action films, Balachander directed socially themed films with women as protagonists usually centred on unusual or complicated interpersonal relationships and social themes. He portrayed women as headstrong, intelligent and independent people. Balachander revealed that many of his messages from his films, he has drawn inspiration from poet Subramaniya Bharathi whom he had admired since his childhood. Screenwriter Gopu (of Gopu-Babu) said that he used to begin his script from the ending and then construct the plot.

<doc id="859119" wikidata="Q772162" url="?curid=859119" title="RAF Mildenhall">
<text>Royal Air Force Mildenhall, or more simply RAF Mildenhall , is a Royal Air Force station located near Mildenhall in Suffolk, England. Despite its status as a Royal Air Force station, it primarily supports United States Air Force (USAF) operations, and is currently the home of the 100th Air Refueling Wing (100 ARW).

During the Second World War, RAF Bomber Command used the station for operational combat missions until 1945. Placed on standby status after the war, it was reopened by the Royal Air Force and became a USAF-RAF joint operation base on 11 July 1950. It was assigned to Strategic Air Command (SAC), and began hosting B-50 Superfortresses in 1951, and KC-97 Stratofreighters from 1953 until 1958. The Military Air Transport Service transferred its main United Kingdom terminal to Mildenhall in 1958. In the late 1970s and throughout the 1980s U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird operations took place from the base. On 8 January 2015, the United States Department of Defense announced that operations at RAF Mildenhall would end and be relocated to Germany (Spangdahlem Air Base) and elsewhere within the UK. After a period of uncertainty it was confirmed in July 2020 that the relocation of operations would no longer take place. RAF Mildenhall, alongside its sister base RAF Lakenheath, have the largest United States Air Force presence in the United Kingdom.

==History==
===Early years (1930s)===
In order to meet a perceived &#x27;continental threat&#x27;, the British military developed the idea to site a Royal Air Force bomber base at Mildenhall in the late 1920s. Shortly thereafter, the government purchased the land in 1929, followed by the completion of the first buildings in 1931. Three years later, RAF Mildenhall opened on 16 October 1934, as one of the RAF&#x27;s largest bomber stations. On the same day, Wing Commander Francis Linnell, assumed his position as the first station commander.

RAF Mildenhall&#x27;s premature inauguration was due in large part with its selection to host the Royal Aero Club&#x27;s prestigious MacRobertson Air Race on 20 October 1934. At the time, the air race stood as the longest race ever devised, and attracted over 70,000 spectators to the airfield. Even more telling of the race&#x27;s significance in the world&#x27;s sporting spotlight, on short notice King George V and Queen Mary visited RAF Mildenhall the day before the race. In the end, pilots Tom Campbell Black and C. W. A. Scott flying the de Havilland Comet &quot;Grosvenor House&quot;, crossed the finish line first at Melbourne, Australia, less than 72 hours after starting the race.

Following this favourable beginning, RAF Mildenhall received its first squadron and aircraft with the arrival of No. 99B Squadron, equipped with Handley Page Heyford bombers. King George V reviewed 350 aircraft at Mildenhall in 1935 on the occasion of his Silver Jubilee. This historical event is commemorated by a memorial tablet located in front of the Building 562, the current 100th Air Refueling Wing headquarters.

The threat the RAF had envisioned in the late 1920s materialised during the Munich Crisis. Between 26 September 1938 and 4 October 1939, the airfield completed its installation of its defence systems. After a brief reprieve from war, the airfield prepared for war, bringing station defences and squadrons to full combat readiness. On 3 September 1939, three days after Germany invaded Poland, Britain and France declared war on Germany. Later that same day, three Vickers Wellington aircraft from No. 149 Squadron at Mildenhall were dispatched to bomb the German naval fleet at Wilhelmshaven.

===Second World War (1939–1945)===
Throughout Second World War, RAF Mildenhall remained active as in addition to its own airfield, the base had responsibility for RAF Newmarket, RAF Tuddenham, and RAF Lakenheath. During the course of the war, the base witnessed the transition from the two-engine Wellington, to the four-engine Short Stirling, and finally to the Avro Lancaster.

By the end of the war, aircraft from Mildenhall and its satellite airfields had dropped over 23,000 tons of explosives, laid 2,000 mines and flew over 8,000 sorties. The airfield also saw the loss of over 200; Wellington, Stirling, and Lancaster bombers with the loss of over 2,000 aircrew. One of those killed, was Pilot Officer Rawdon Hume Middleton, an Australian who was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross and is buried at St. Johns Church cemetery in Beck Row after his body was washed ashore.

==== Target for Tonight ====
During the last two weeks of March and the first two weeks of April 1941, Mildenhall was used for the making of the film &quot;Target for Tonight&quot;. So as not to give away important information to the enemy, Mildenhall took the fictitious name of Millerton Aerodrome and several other aspects involving the day-to-day operations were altered. The film, produced by the Crown Film Unit, focused on the planning and execution of an air raid on Germany, as seen by the crew of Vickers Wellington OJ-F &#x27;F for Freddie&#x27;. Wellingtons and their crews from the resident No. 149 Squadron, coded OJ, were used for the filming. The exception to this was Percy Pickard who was at that time Squadron Leader with No. 311 (Czechoslovak) Squadron. Pickard played the part of Squadron Leader Dickson, the captain of &#x27;F for Freddie&#x27;. Pickard would go on to lead daring raids such Operation Biting and the later Operation Jericho on Amiens Prison, in which he was killed.

===Postwar (1945–1950)===
After the war, aircraft from Mildenhall flew home repatriated prisoners of war in Operation Exodus, and participated in Operation Manna, dropping relief supplies to the Dutch people stranded by the flooding caused by the retreating German . By the end of 1945, Mildenhall&#x27;s operational activity experienced a drastic decrease and despite a brief flurry of flying activity in the late 1940s, the RAF reduced the base to &#x27;care and maintenance&#x27; status. The only remaining RAF unit of significance was Headquarters No. 3 Group, part of Bomber Command, which remained on station until 1967.

The following RAF units operated from Mildenhall:
=== Cold War (1950–1991) ===
==== Strategic Air Command ====

The initial Strategic Air Command unit to use Mildenhall was the 7511th Air Base Group (later redesignated 3910th Air Base Group), being activated on 11 July 1950, to prepare the facility for operational use by SAC aircraft. On 1 May 1951, SAC took control of the station rotated bomb wings in and out of Mildenhall on temporary duty assignments. The first operational strategic unit to use the airfield was the Boeing B-50D Superfortress equipped 2nd Bomb Wing, arriving on Temporary Duty (TDY) from Hunter AFB in Georgia on 4 May 1951.

Other rotational strategic bomb wings at Mildenhall were:

* 22nd Bombardment Wing (7 September 1951 – 12 December 1951) (B-50D, KB-29P) (TDY from March AFB California)
* 93rd Bombardment Wing (16 December 1951 – 8 March 1952) (B-50D, KB-29P) (TDY from Castle AFB California) 
* 509th Bombardment Wing (4 June 1952 – 2 September 1952) (B-50D, KB-29P) (TDY from Walker AFB New Mexico)
In 1953, Mildenhall&#x27;s mission was changed from a B-50 bomber airfield to a KC-97 Stratofreighter aerial tanker dispersal base. The role was to support Boeing B-47 Stratojet aircraft based at RAF Fairford. The base became the home for the United Kingdom Passenger Terminal managed by Military Air Transport Service (MATS) in 1958.

=====7513th Tactical Group=====

SAC departed Mildenhall in 1959, as its runway capabilities no longer met the requirements for its newer aircraft. On 17 July 1959, SAC and USAFE reached an agreement facilitating and substantially increasing Third Air Force&#x27;s role in making operational decisions regarding the USAF units in the UK. On 1 September, the 7513th Tactical Group took over host unit responsibilities.

On 15 November 1965 Mildenhall welcomed the arrival of the Silk Purse Control Group and the 7120th Airborne Command and Control Squadron (7120 ACCS) previously stationed at Chateauroux Air Station, France. Upon its arrival at Mildenhall, the 7120th ACCS converted from the Douglas C-118 to the Boeing EC-135 which were used as airborne command posts for the Commander, US European Command under the code name Operation Silk Purse.

=====513th Tactical Airlift Wing=====

On 1 July 1966, the 513th Troop Carrier Wing arrived at Mildenhall from Evreux-Fauville Air Base in France. With its activation on Mildenhall, the 513th TCW assumed operational control of two rotational (7441st, 7742nd) Troop Carrier Squadrons of twenty C-130 Hercules as well as the 7120th ACCS / Silk Purse Control Group and the five Boeing EC-135H.

For the next few years, Mildenhall witnessed little change: however, in June 1972, the base added to the list of its tenants with the arrival of Headquarters Third Air Force, which relocated from South Ruislip.

In May 1969, mechanic Sergeant Paul Meyer, homesick for his wife in Virginia, stole a Hercules C-130E transporter and flew south, eventually ditching in the English Channel. In April 2018 an underwater search for the aircraft, using sonar, was announced by the Deeper Dorset group.

=====306th Strategic Wing=====

The next significant event in Mildenhall&#x27;s history came with the arrival of Detachment 4, 9th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing (9th SRW) in 1976, which controlled rotational U-2 and SR-71 Blackbird operations from the base. From their arrival, until the departure of the last SR-71 on 18 January 1990, the 306th Strategic Wing&#x27;s SR-71 and U-2 aircraft came to symbolise RAF Mildenhall in the local public&#x27;s eye.

On 1 July 1978, the 306th Strategic Wing of SAC was transferred to Mildenhall from Ramstein Air Base, West Germany with a Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker air refuelling and a Boeing RC-135 reconnaissance mission. The 306th SW also functioned as the focal point for all SAC operations in Europe, and became the host unit at Mildenhall.

===Post Cold War (1990s)===

The 306th Strategic Wing operated at RAF Mildenhall until 1 February 1992, when the 100th Air Refueling Wing of USAFE, assumed the 306th SW responsibilities, and became host unit at Mildenhall, along with becoming Headquarters European Tanker Task Force with its KC-135 Stratotankers.

In May 1993, as part of the drawdown of forces in Europe, it was announced that the majority of the USAF-operated base at RAF Alconbury was to be returned to the British Ministry of Defence. As a part of this return, the 352nd Special Operations Group and its associated aircraft, the MC-130E Combat Talon, HC-130P/N Combat King and MH-53 Pave Low, transferred to RAF Mildenhall in March 1995.

===2000–present===

During the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the 491st Air Expeditionary Group (491st AEG) operated from the base, with the 491st Air Expeditionary Aeromedical Evacuation Squadron and the 744th Expeditionary Airlift Squadron, flying the Lockheed C-141C Starlifter. Also attached to the 491st AEG was the 791st Expeditionary Aeromedical Airlift Squadron, now located at Ramstein Air Base, Germany.

The 501st Combat Support Wing was activated at RAF Mildenhall on 21 May 2005. It was a non-flying unit that provides administration and operation of units at RAF Croughton (422nd Air Base Group), RAF Alconbury (423rd Air Base Group) and RAF Fairford (420th Air Base Group). The wing moved to RAF Alconbury on 1 May 2007.

In June 2021 President of the United States Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden flew to RAF Mildenhall on Air Force One for the 47th G7 summit and their first meeting with Queen Elizabeth II. President Biden addressed troops on base shortly after landing.

In April 2023, during President Joe Biden&#x27;s visit to Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, an E-4B Nightwatch callsign &quot;GRIM99&quot; was seen flying over Wales and landed at RAF Mildenhall.

In 2024, between 20 November and 22 November, small unmanned aerial systems (UASs) were spotted in the vicinity of and over RAF Mildenhall, part of wider drone incursions at US air bases in the United Kingdom. The number of UASs fluctuated and they ranged in size and configuration. F-15E Strike Eagles, based at Lakenheath, were allegedly scrambled in response to the drones as they impacted local flight operations. RAF Regiment personnel were later deployed to the bases with the ORCUS C-UAS system in response to a second sighting of unidentified drones in the night hours of 25 November.

On 8 January 2015, the United States Department of Defense announced that as part of their European Infrastructure Consolidation (EIC) programme, they would be withdrawing from RAF Mildenhall to help save $500 million a year across Europe. In January 2016, as a result of the proposed US withdrawal, the UK government announced the site was one of twelve that would be sold as part of their strategy for the Ministry of Defence estate, although no date for the sale was given. It was planned to relocate units based at Mildenhall to Spangdahlem Air Base in Germany.

A change in political administration in the United States, heightened security concerns on the part of the United States, the UK and NATO pertaining to Europe and the Middle East, and a variety of other issues prompted a reassessment on Mildenhall&#x27;s closure. By 2017, the closure process had been put on indefinite hold and in February 2020, it was reported it had been extended to at least 2027. In July 2020, the Department of Defense announced that the US military would in fact be withdrawing from Spangdahlem and that the 100th Air Refueling Wing and 352nd Special Operations Wing would remain at Mildenhall, thereby keeping the base open for the foreseeable future.

Since the beginning of its use by the USAF, Mildenhall has been the site of many anti-war protests by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and other peace groups. In January 2003, students cut a hole in the perimeter fence and accessed the base. Later, in April 2003, protestors with Stop the War Coalition broke into the base to unfurl a banner with the words: “Stop Killing Each Other”.

Notable protesters include MP and former Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn and former CND chair Kate Hudson.

<text>Alpheratz , or Alpha Andromedae (α Andromedae, abbreviated Alpha And or α And), is a binary star 97 light-years from Earth and is the brightest star in the constellation of Andromeda when Mirach (βAndromedae) undergoes its periodical dimming. Immediately northeast of the constellation of Pegasus, it is the upper left star of the Great Square of Pegasus.

Although it appears to the naked eye as a single star, with overall apparent visual magnitude +2.06, it is actually a binary system composed of two stars in close orbit. The chemical composition of the brighter of the two stars is unusual as it is a mercury-manganese star whose atmosphere contains abnormally high levels of mercury, manganese, and other elements, including gallium and xenon. It is the brightest mercury-manganese star known.

== Nomenclature ==

&quot;α Andromedae&quot; (Latinised to &quot;Alpha Andromedae&quot;) is the star&#x27;s Bayer designation. Ptolemy considered the star (system) to be shared by Pegasus and Johann Bayer assigned it a designation in both constellations: Alpha Andromedae (α And) and Delta Pegasi (δ Peg). Since the IAU standardized constellation boundaries and widely published them two years after in 1930, the Pegasi alternate name has dropped from use, putting it slightly outside of that constellation.

To most European centres of learning the star bore names &quot;Alpheratz&quot; () or the cognate simplification &quot;Alpherat&quot; or the other part of the fabled description: &quot;Sirrah&quot; .

The origin of these three, the Arabic phrasal name, is سرة الفرس &quot;navel of the mare/horse&quot;, attracting a hard consonant not present above due to a following vowel. The horse corresponds equivalently to the winged horse of the Greeks, Pegasus. The star is in almost all depictions part of the main asterism of Pegasus &quot;and&quot; Andromeda. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN&#x27;s first bulletin of July 2016 confirmed &quot;Alpheratz&quot; as the name for the main star.

Other terms for this star used by some medieval astronomers writing were راس المراة المسلسلة &quot;rās al-mar&#x27;a al-musalsala&quot; (head of the woman in chains), &quot;al-kaff al-khaḍīb&quot; and &quot;kaff al-naṣīr&quot; (palm of the faithful). The chained woman referenced Andromeda.

In the Hindu lunar zodiac, this star, together with the other stars in the Great Square of Pegasus (α, β, and γ Pegasi), makes up the nakshatras of Pūrva Bhādrapadā and Uttara Bhādrapadā.

In Chinese, (), meaning &quot;wall&quot;, refers to an asterism consisting of α Andromedae and γ Pegasi. Consequently, the Chinese name for α Andromedae itself is (, .)

It is also known as one of the &quot;Three Guides&quot; that mark the prime meridian of the heavens, the other two being Beta Cassiopeiae and Gamma Pegasi. It was believed to bless those born under its influence with honour and riches.

==System==

The radial velocity of a star away from or towards the observer can be determined by measuring the red shift or blue shift of its spectrum. The American astronomer Vesto Slipher made a series of such measurements from 1902 to 1904 and discovered that the radial velocity of α Andromedae varied periodically. He concluded that it was in orbit in a spectroscopic binary star system with a period of about 100 days. A preliminary orbit was published by Hans Ludendorff in 1907, and a more precise orbit was later published by Robert Horace Baker.

The fainter star in the system was first resolved interferometrically by Xiaopei Pan and his coworkers during 1988 and 1989, using the Mark III Stellar Interferometer at the Mount Wilson Observatory, California, United States. This work was published in 1992. Because of the difference in luminosity between the two stars, its spectral lines were not observed until the early 1990s, in observations made by Jocelyn Tomkin, Xiaopei Pan, and James K. McCarthy between 1991 and 1994 and published in 1995.

The two stars are now known to orbit each other with a period of 96.9 days. The larger, brighter star, called the &quot;primary&quot;, has a spectral type of B8IV-VHgMn, a mass of approximately 3.6 solar masses, a surface temperature of about 11,900 K (or 13,850 K), and, measured over all wavelengths, a luminosity of about 160 times the Sun&#x27;s. Its smaller, fainter companion, the &quot;secondary&quot;, has a mass of approximately 1.9 solar masses and a surface temperature of about 7,900 K, and, again measured over all wavelengths, a luminosity of about 15 times the Sun&#x27;s. It is an late-type A star whose spectral type is estimated as A7V.

===Chemical peculiarities===
In 1906, Norman Lockyer and F. E. Baxandall reported that α Andromedae had a number of unusual lines in its spectrum. In 1914, Baxandall pointed out that most of the unusual lines came from manganese, and that similar lines were present in the spectrum of μ Leporis. In 1931, W. W. Morgan identified 12 additional stars with lines from manganese appearing in their spectra. Many of these stars were subsequently identified as part of the group of mercury-manganese stars, a class of chemically peculiar stars which have an excess of elements such as mercury, manganese, phosphorus, and gallium in their atmospheres., §3.4. In the case of α Andromedae, the brighter primary star is a mercury-manganese star which, as well as the elements already mentioned, has excess xenon.

In 1970, Georges Michaud suggested that such chemically peculiar stars arose from radiative diffusion. According to this theory, in stars with unusually calm atmospheres, some elements sink under the force of gravity, while others are pushed to the surface by radiation pressure., §4. This theory has successfully explained many observed chemical peculiarities, including those of mercury-manganese stars., §4.

===Variability of primary===
α Andromedae has been reported to be slightly variable, but observations from 1990 to 1994 found its brightness to be constant to within less than 0.01 magnitude. However, Adelman and his co-workers have discovered, in observations made between 1993 and 1999 and published in 2002, that the mercury line in its spectrum at 398.4 nm varies as the primary rotates. This is because the distribution of mercury in its atmosphere is not uniform. Applying Doppler imaging to the observations allowed Adelman et al. to find that it was concentrated in clouds near the equator. Subsequent Doppler imaging studies, published in 2007, showed that these clouds drift slowly over the star&#x27;s surface.

==Observation==
The location of α Andromedae in the sky is shown on the left. It can be seen by the naked eye and is theoretically visible at all latitudes north of 60° S. During evening from August to October, it will be high in the sky as seen from the northern midlatitudes.
==Optical companion==



The binary system described above has an optical visual companion, discovered by William Herschel on July 21, 1781. Designated as &quot;ADS 94 B&quot; in the Aitken Double Star Catalogue, it is a G-type star with an apparent visual magnitude of approximately 10.8. Although by coincidence it appears near to the other two stars in the sky, it&#x27;s much more distant from Earth; the parallax observed by Gaia place this star more than 1,300 light years away.

<text>Bistre (or bister) is a pigment made from soot. Historically, beechwood was burned to produce the soot, which was boiled and diluted with water. Many Old Masters used bistre as the ink for their wash paintings. Bistre&#x27;s appearance is generally of a dark grayish brown, with a yellowish cast.

&quot;Bistre&quot; has also been used to name colors resembling the pigment, typically shades of brown. The first recorded use of &quot;bistre&quot; as a color name in English was in 1727; another name for the color &quot;bistre&quot; is soot brown.

==Variations of bistre==

===Bistre===
Among other colors, &quot;bistre&quot; is the name of a very dark shade of grayish brown (the version shown on the immediate right).

===Bistre brown===
At right is displayed the color bistre brown, a medium brownish tone of the color &quot;bistre&quot;, also known as &quot;soot brown&quot;.

This is the tone of &quot;bistre&quot; that most closely matches the color sample in the 1930 book &quot;A Dictionary of Color&quot; by Maerz and Paul.

This tone of bistre is the color of the ink that was used by the Old Masters for their drawings.

The for bistre brown are identical to the color names drab, sand dune, and mode beige, which were first recorded as color names in English, respectively, in 1686, 1925, and 1928.

===French bistre===
At right is displayed the color French bistre, which is the tone of bistre called &quot;bistre&quot; in the Pourpre.com color list, a color list widely popular in France.

For pictures of bistre colored postage stamps, see the French Wikipedia article on the color bistre.
===Spanish bistre===
Spanish bistre is the color that is called &quot;bistre&quot; (the Spanish word for &quot;bistre&quot; is the same as the English word) in the (&quot;Guide to colorations&quot;) by Rosa Gallego and Juan Carlos Sanz, a color dictionary published in 2005 that is widely popular in the Hispanophone realm.

<text>Kalathur Kannamma is a 1960 Indian Tamil-language romantic drama film directed by A. Bhimsingh and written by Javar Seetharaman. The film stars Gemini Ganesh, Savitri Ganesh and Kamal Haasan. It revolves around a couple — a wealthy zamindar&#x27;s son and a farmer&#x27;s daughter — who are separated due to circumstances, while their innocent son is forced to grow up in an orphanage.

&quot;Kalathur Kannamma&quot;, inspired by the 1960 Chinese film &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child&quot;, was originally directed by T. Prakash Rao who left due to creative differences, resulting in Bhimsingh taking over. It was the debut film of Kamal Haasan. The film&#x27;s soundtrack was composed by R. Sudarsanam.

&quot;Kalathur Kannamma&quot; was released on 12 August 1960. The film was critically acclaimed, with Haasan&#x27;s performance being singled out. It was also commercially successful, running for over 100 days in theatres. It won the Certificate of Merit by the Government of India, and the President&#x27;s Gold Medal award for Haasan at the age of 6. The film was remade in Telugu as &quot;Mooga Nomu&quot;, in Hindi as &quot;Main Chup Rahungi&quot; (with Bhimsingh returning as director), and in Sinhala as &quot;Mangalika&quot;.

== Plot ==
Rajalingam is the only son of Ramalingam, the zamindar of Kalathur. Kannamma is the daughter of Murugan, a farmer of the same place. On the zamindar advice, Murugan sends his daughter to Madras for higher education. While returning from Madras, Kannamma meets Raja in the train. Noticing her respect and awe for the zamindar, Raja calls himself an electrician visiting the palace. They fall in love. A few days later, Kannamma learns the truth and to reassure her, Raja marries her secretly in a temple.

Two days later, Raja has to go abroad for higher studies. During his absence, Ramalingam learns of the marriage and orders Kannamma to forget his son. Moved by the zamindar feelings, Kannamma promises never to mention their marriage to anyone. Ramalingam arranges Murugan and the now pregnant Kannamma to stay in a nearby town, Sevalpatti. Murugan, who is ashamed of Kannamma&#x27;s secret marriage, leaves Kannamma&#x27;s newborn son in an orphanage and lies that the child was stillborn. They both decide to leave the place and settle in Bangalore.

When Raja returns, he learns that Kannamma had left Kalathur. His inquiries in Sevalpatti lead him to believe that Kannamma had led an immoral life. Grief-stricken, he travels from place to place to forget Kannamma and takes to drinking as a last resort. In Bangalore, he encounters Kannamma in a dancer&#x27;s house where she had come to teach the dancer&#x27;s daughter. Her presence in the house and reticence to Raja&#x27;s questions strengthens his belief that Kannamma is a woman of ill repute and in disgust, he returns home.

Kannamma&#x27;s son Selvam grows up into an intelligent boy and is living in the orphanage in Sevalpatti. Murugan visits the orphanage and on meeting Selvam, decides to shift to Sevalpatti to be near him. Kannamma becomes a teacher in Selvam&#x27;s school and feels attracted to him. She invites him to stay with her but he refuses as he has to look after Mani, a lame orphan living with him. Raja is invited to Sevalpatti by Singaram, a rich merchant who wants to marry his daughter Maduram to him, to preside over a school function. Raja takes a fascination for Selvam who acts in the school play. After the play ends, he encounters Kannamma again and orders the headmistress to dismiss her.

Mani is critically ill and Selvam turns to Raja for help. Raja brings a doctor who is unable to save Mani. Raja takes Selvam with him to the palace. At Selvam&#x27;s insistence, he stops drinking and to give him a mother, decides to marry Maduram. A seriously ill Murugan confesses to Kannamma that her child is not dead and reveals the identity of Selvam. Kannamma tries to contact Selvam but does not find him in the orphanage. The news shocks Murugan and to soothe his nerves, they move back to Kalathur. In the local temple, Kannamma meets Selvam and tells him that she is his mother. On learning from him that Raja is bringing him up and is marrying shortly to find him a mother, she asks him not to mention anything about her to Raja.

Maduram learns from Selvam that he is the son of Raja, after which Singaram insists on a written undertaking that the properties of Raja would go to the children of Maduram only. The news of this conflict spreads in the village. On learning this, Murugan rushes to the palace to tell everyone the true identity of Selvam but collapses near the palace gate. Kannamma, who has followed, takes Selvam and tries to move away when she is intercepted by Raja who demands the boy back. Raja refuses to believe that Selvam is Kannamma&#x27;s son and abuses Kannamma for her shameless life. Ramalingam observes that even in such a humiliating situation, Kannamma is silent and does not breathe a word about her promise to him. He is moved and acknowledges her as his daughter-in-law. Selvam is united with his parents, and Raja&#x27;s marriage with Maduram is cancelled.

=== Development ===
After assisting A. V. Meiyappan in producing films for AVM Productions, his sons Saravanan, Murugan, Kumaran discussed producing one on their own with his son-in-law Arun Veerappan. Their mother Rajeswari told Meiyappan about this, and he gave his consent. The first story the brothers discussed was &quot;Maanam Periyadhu&quot;, but it did not shape up well. Unwilling to make a half-baked story as their inaugural production, Saravanan continued searching. Vellaichaami, an ex-employee of AVM, told Saravanan that Javar Seetharaman had been discussing a story with Meiyappan. Saravanan inquired further and learned that the story was &quot;Pattuvum Kittuvum&quot;. However, Meiyappan told Seetharaman that while the story was good, AVM could not film it. When Saravanan and his brothers learned that Seetharaman was in discussions with another production company, they ran to Meiyappan and told him that they were interested in Seetharaman&#x27;s story; to their relief, Meiyappan revealed that Seetharaman would be visiting him that afternoon. After Seetharaman realised that Saravanan and his brothers were interested, he willingly gave them his story, which evolved into &quot;Kalathur Kannamma&quot;.

Impressed with T. Prakash Rao&#x27;s work in &quot;Amara Deepam&quot; (1956) and &quot;Uthama Puthiran&quot; (1958), Saravanan and his brothers considered he would be best to direct &quot;Kalathur Kannamma&quot;. This decision was questioned, given that AVM had its own &quot;director unit&quot; of which Prakash Rao was not a part. Though AVM paid its directors salaries ranging from to , Prakash Rao charged —twice as much. Meiyappan, not wanting to be an obstacle to his sons&#x27; enthusiasm, approved Prakash Rao&#x27;s salary. Despite Saravanan&#x27;s desire, the credit of producing the film was given to Meiyappan, Kumaran, and Arun Veerappan. The story by Seetharaman was loosely adapted from two sources: the play &quot;The Forgotten Factor&quot; by the Moral Rearmament Army, and the 1960 Chinese film &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Child&quot;. Cinematography was handled by T. Muthuswamy, editing by S. Surya, and art direction by H. Shantaram. S. P. Muthuraman worked as an assistant director, this being his first stint with film.

=== Casting ===
Gemini Ganesan, his last name credited as Ganesh, was cast as Rajalingam and Savitri Ganesh as the title character Kannamma. The former was paid a salary of after initially negotiating for . Daisy Irani was originally chosen to play Rajalingam and Kannamma&#x27;s son Selvam, after AVM were impressed with her performance in &quot;Yaar Paiyyan&quot; (1957). Sara Ramachandran, the family doctor of AVM, came to the AVM household with four-year old Kamal Haasan. Sara told Rajeswari that Haasan had come to meet Meiyappan as he aspired to become an actor; Haasan was eventually taken by Saravanan to Meiyappan, who asked him to act like Irani. Impressed with Haasan&#x27;s performance in the audition, Meiyappan decided to replace Irani with him. Though Saravanan protested as Irani had already been already booked for the role and paid an advance of , Meiyappan remained adamant as he felt Haasan was fresher and brighter than Irani. Devika, who portrayed Maduram, received a salary of .

=== Filming ===
The song &quot;Kangalil Vaarthaigal Puriyatho&quot; was shot with many mango trees in the background. When it was decided to reshoot parts of the song, the mangoes were no longer in the trees since the season had ended. Hence, it was decided to reshoot the necessary scenes with fake mangoes hanging from the trees. The first shot filmed on Haasan was a scene featuring Kannamma feeding him upma. The song &quot;Ammavum Neeye Appavum Neeye&quot;, picturised on Selvam, was recorded with three minutes duration, but Prakash Rao filmed its video to be only one-and-a-half minutes long. Meiyappan insisted to shoot the entire song so that Selvam could be established, and reshoot other scenes he was not satisfied with. Prakash Rao felt Meiyappan was interfering creatively and expressed his desire to quit the film, although up to nearly had been canned. Though Meiyappan was hesitant, Prakash Rao convinced him and left. AVM later hired A. Bhimsingh, under whose direction the film was completed. Although Bhimsingh offered to retain Prakash Rao&#x27;s name in the credits, he declined. When Saravanan found another company made a film &quot;Kadavulin Kuzhandhai&quot; on the same plot as &quot;Kalathur Kannamma&quot;, he decided to release &quot;Kalathur Kannamma&quot; as soon as possible. However Meiyappan wanted to reshoot certain scenes which Saravanan was not interested in. Meiyappan felt the presentation was more important than the plot so as per his suggestion, the scenes were reshot. The final length of the film was .

== Soundtrack ==
The music was composed by R. Sudarsanam, while the lyrics were penned by Kannadasan, Kothamangalam Subbu, Ku. Ma. Balasubramaniam, M. K. Athmanathan and T. K. Sundara Vathiyar. For the song &quot;Arugil Vanthaal&quot;, Kannadasan came up with 56 or 58 pallavis, of which eight were finalised. The song &quot;Aadatha Manamum&quot; is set in the Carnatic raga known as Gourimanohari. For the song &quot;Ammavum Neeye&quot;, the makers were not satisfied with any of the tunes composed by Sudarsanam. When violinist Chengalvarayan composed the tune of &quot;Ammavum Neeye&quot; on his violin, Sudarsanam created a complete tune out of it. The soundtrack received positive response, with &quot;Ammavum Neeye&quot; being singled out for praise.

== Release and reception ==
&quot;Kalathur Kannamma&quot; was released on 12 August 1960, and received mostly positive reviews. On 11 September 1960, &quot;Ananda Vikatan&quot; praised Kamal Haasan&#x27;s performance and described &quot;Kalathur Kannamma&quot; as one of the best films in Tamil to that point. The Madras-based film magazine &quot;Movieland&quot; said, &quot;A new star rises on the movie horizon&quot;. The article by film journalist, K. Vasudevan, praised the performance of Haasan. Kanthan of &quot;Kalki&quot; lauded the performances of the various cast members, including Subbaiah and Balaiah, and said the film could be watched once. The film was a major commercial success,&quot;&quot; running for over 100 days in theatres. It won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Tamil – Certificate of Merit for the Third Best Feature Film in 1961, and Haasan&#x27;s performance earned him the President&#x27;s Gold Medal.

== Other versions ==
&quot;Kalathur Kannamma&quot; was dubbed in Telugu as &quot;Mavoori Ammayi&quot;, which was released on 20 October 1960. The film was also remade in the same language as &quot;Mooga Nomu&quot; (1969). Bhimsingh later remade the film in Hindi as &quot;Main Chup Rahungi&quot; (1962), where &quot;Ammavum Neeye&quot; was re-used as &quot;Tumhi Ho Mata&quot;. The film was also remade in Sinhala as &quot;Mangalika&quot; (1963), while the Hindi version was remade as &quot;Udarata Menike&quot; the same year.

== In other media ==
In &quot;Udan Pirappu&quot; (1993), Vellasamy (Goundamani) as a beggar sings &quot;Mummy-um Neeye&quot; to the tune of &quot;Ammavum Neeye&quot;. In &quot;Kaathala Kaathala&quot; (1998), footage of &quot;Ammavum Neeye&quot; is used in the title credits and Selvam morphs into Ramalingam (Haasan); he and Sundaralingam (Prabhu Deva) along with children are seen singing this song to a garbage bin.

<text>The United Nations Buffer Zone in Cyprus is a demilitarized zone, patrolled by the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP), that was established on 4 March 1964. It was extended on 9 August after the Battle of Tillyria and extended again in 1974 after the ceasefire of 16 August 1974, following the Turkish invasion of Cyprus and the &quot;de facto&quot; partition of the island into the area controlled by the Republic of Cyprus (excluding the British Sovereign Base Areas) and the largely unrecognized Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus in the north. The zone, also known as the Green Line (, &quot;Prasini Grammi&quot;; ), stretches for from Paralimni in the east to Kato Pyrgos in the west, where a separate section surrounds Kokkina.

The dividing line is also referred to as the Attila Line, named after Turkey&#x27;s 1974 military invasion, codenamed &quot;Operation Attila&quot;. The Turkish army has built a barrier on the zone&#x27;s northern side, consisting mainly of barbed-wire fencing, concrete wall segments, watchtowers, anti-tank ditches, and minefields. The zone cuts through the centre of Nicosia, separating the city into southern and northern sections. In total, it spans an area of , varying in width from less than to more than . After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, Nicosia remains the last divided capital in Europe. Some 10,000 people live in several villages and work on farms located within the zone; the village of Pyla is famous for being one of the few remaining villages in Cyprus where Greek and Turkish Cypriots still live side by side. Other villages are Deneia, Athienou, and Troulloi. Some areas are untouched by human interference and have remained a safe haven for flora and fauna.

==History==



A buffer zone in Cyprus was first established in the last days of 1963, when Major-General Peter Young was the commander of the British Joint Force (later known as the Truce Force and a predecessor of the present UN force). This Force was set up in the wake of the intercommunal violence of Christmas 1963. On 30 December 1963, following a &#x27;high powered&#x27; twelve hour meeting chaired by Duncan Sandys (British Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations), General Young drew the agreed cease-fire line on a map with a green chinagraph pencil, which was to become known as the &quot;Green Line&quot;. Brigadier Patrick Thursby also assisted in devising and establishing the Green Line.

This map was then passed to General Young&#x27;s intelligence officer, who was waiting in a nearby building and told to &quot;Get on with it.&quot; Intelligence Corps NCOs then copied the map for distribution to the Truce Force units. Further copies of the map would then have been produced &#x27;in house&#x27; for use by Truce Force patrols.

The Green Line became impassable following the July 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus during which Turkey occupied approximately 37% of Cypriot territory, in response to a short-lived Greek Cypriot coup. A &quot;security zone&quot; was established after the Tripartite Conference of Geneva in July 1974. Pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 353 of 1974,&lt;ref name=&quot;S/RES/353&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the foreign ministers of Greece, Turkey, and the United Kingdom convened in Geneva on 25 July 1974. According to UNFICYP, the text of the joint declaration transmitted to the Secretary-General of the United Nations was as follows:

The UN Security Council then adopted the above declaration with Resolution 355. When the coup dissolved, the Turkish Armed Forces advanced to capture approximately 37% of the island and met the &quot;Green Line&quot;. The meandering Buffer Zone marks the southernmost points that the Turkish troops occupied during the Turkish Invasion of Cyprus in August 1974, running between the ceasefire lines of the Cypriot National Guard and Turkish army that &quot;de facto&quot; divides Cyprus into two, cutting through the capital of Nicosia. With the self-proclamation of the internationally unrecognized &quot;Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus&quot;, the Buffer Zone became its de facto southern border.

Traffic across the buffer zone was very limited until 2003, when the number of crossings and the rules governing them were relaxed.

In March 2021 Cyprus erected a barbed wire fence on the Buffer Zone to curb illegal immigration.

==Sectors==
===Sector One===
Starts at Kokkina exclave and covers approximately to Mammari, west of Nicosia. Since 16 October 1993, it has been the responsibility of the Argentinian Contingent with approximately 212 soldiers. Sector One Headquarters and Command Company are located in San Martin Camp, which is near Skouriotissa village. Support Company finds its home at Roca Camp, near Xeros in the north. The two line companies are deployed along four permanently staffed patrol bases while also conducting mobile patrols from the San Martin and Roca camps.

===Sector Two===

Starts at Mammari, west of Nicosia and covers to Kaimakli, east of Nicosia. Since 1993, it has been the responsibility of the British contingent, which deploys using the name Operation TOSCA.

===Sector Three===
Sector 3 was patrolled by Canadian troops until their departure in 1993. It was then absorbed into Sectors 2 and 4.

===Sector Four===
Starting at Kaimakli, east of Nicosia and covers to the village of Dherinia, on the east coast of Cyprus and has been the responsibility of the Slovak contingent, with 202 soldiers.

==Crossings==

After a nearly 30-year ban on crossings, the Turkish Cypriot administration significantly eased travel restrictions across the dividing line in April 2003, allowing Greek Cypriots to cross at the Ledra Palace Crossing just outside the walls of old Nicosia. This was only made possible after the decision of the ECHR (&quot;Djavit An vs Turkey&quot;, Application No.20652/92).

These are the crossings now available:

Before Cypriot accession to the European Union, there were restrictions on Green Line crossings by foreigners imposed by the Republic of Cyprus, but these were abolished for EU citizens by EU regulation 866/2004. Generally, citizens of any country are permitted to cross the line, including Greek and Turkish Cypriots. A 2005 EU report stated that &quot;a systematic illegal route through the northern part to the government-controlled areas exists&quot; allowing an influx of asylum seekers.

==Incidents==

On 11 August 1996, Greek Cypriots demonstrated with a march against the Turkish occupation of Cyprus. The demonstrators&#x27; demand was the complete withdrawal of Turkish troops and the return of Cypriot refugees to their homes and properties. Among the demonstrators was Cypriot refugee Tassos Isaac, who was beaten to death by the Turkish far-right group Grey Wolves.

Another man, Solomos Solomou (Tassos Isaac&#x27;s cousin), was shot to death by a Northern Cyprus minister during the same protests on 14 August 1996.
Aged 26, Solomou was one of many mourners who entered the Buffer Zone three days after Isaac&#x27;s funeral, on 14 August, to lay a wreath on the spot where he had been beaten to death. As Solomou was climbing to a flagpole to remove the flag of Turkey, he was fired upon by Minister of Agriculture and Natural Resources of Northern Cyprus Kenan Akin. An investigation by authorities of the Republic of Cyprus followed, and the suspects were named as Kenan Akin and Erdal Haciali Emanet (Turkish-born Chief of Special Forces of Northern Cyprus). International legal proceedings were instigated, and arrest warrants for both were issued via Interpol. During the demonstrations on 14 August 1996, two British soldiers were also shot at and wounded by the Turkish forces: Neil Emery and Jeffrey Hudson, both from 39th Regiment Royal Artillery. Bombardier Emery was shot in his arm, whilst Gunner Hudson was shot in the leg by a high velocity rifle round and was airlifted to hospital in Nicosia, then on to RAF Akrotiri.

In August 2023, de facto Turkish security forces (police and military) attacked members of the UN peacekeeping force inside the UN buffer zone at the Pyla. The clashes started over unauthorised construction work in an area under UN control. Turkish bulldozers removed UN trucks, cement bollards and barbed wire from the zone. The incident occurred at the Sector 4 and three peacekeepers were seriously injured and required hospitalisation. Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan accused the UN force of bias against Turkish Cypriots and added that Turkey will not allow any &quot;unlawful&quot; behavior toward Turks on Cyprus. The UN Security Council said that the incident was a violation of the status quo that is contrary to council resolutions and condemned the assault on the peacekeepers. The UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that &quot;threats to the safety of U.N. peacekeepers and damage to U.N. property are unacceptable and may constitute serious crimes under international law.&quot;

==Activism==
The buffer zone between the checkpoints that divide Ledra Street was used as a space for activism from 15 October 2011 up until June 2012 by the Occupy Buffer Zone movement.

<doc id="859146" wikidata="Q1375262" url="?curid=859146" title="Switch (debit card)">
<text>Switch was a debit card brand in the United Kingdom from 1988 until 2002. It was then merged with Maestro, which is owned by MasterCard.

==History==
Switch was launched in 1988 by Midland Bank, National Westminster Bank and The Royal Bank of Scotland as a multifunction cheque guarantee and cash card.

This merger was referred to as the &quot;penguin wedding,&quot; due to its advertisements of penguins in different international settings created by Joel Veitch. Since then, Switch has been out of circulation and banks migrated customers from Switch to Maestro. The deal was announced in August 2002.

The merger was also intended to increase the acceptance of foreign Maestro cards in the United Kingdom.

This change also led to the discontinuation of Solo debit cards.

Switch/Maestro cards issued by certain banks carried an issue number on the bottom of the card corresponding to the number of times a card had been issued on a particular account. This was usually because the current account number the card was linked to actually formed a large part of the card number, and therefore the card number could not be readily changed in case of loss or the card expiring.

In January 2009, First Direct and HSBC discontinued the use of Maestro card, issuing Visa Debit cards to new customers, and a gradual roll out throughout 2009 to existing customers. That September, Clydesdale Bank and Yorkshire Bank, both owned by National Australia Bank, started the process of replacing the Maestro card with a Debit Mastercard for their current accounts, except for the Readycash and Student accounts, for which the Maestro card continued to be issued.

In the same month the Royal Bank of Scotland Group (Europe&#x27;s largest debit card issuer which included the Royal Bank of Scotland, NatWest, Coutts and Ulster Bank) switched from Maestro to Visa Debit, a process that took two years to complete.

<doc id="859152" wikidata="Q859219" url="?curid=859152" title="Big Sandy River (Tennessee)">
<text>The Big Sandy River is a tributary of the Tennessee River in the U.S. state of Tennessee. Via the Tennessee and Ohio rivers, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. The Big Sandy rises about northwest of Lexington, in the same vicinity as two other important rivers of West Tennessee, the Beech River and the Middle Fork of the Forked Deer River.

From near its source downstream, much of the Big Sandy River has been channelized. It crosses into Carroll County near the community of Yuma. In Carroll County, it passes slightly east of the town of Bruceton. Turning somewhat northeast, it crosses into Benton County. The former channel (prior to channelization) of the Big Sandy forms several miles of the boundary between Benton County and Henry County. The lower Big Sandy is impounded by the Kentucky Dam project of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA); it forms the biggest single embayment on Kentucky Lake.

The head of the embayment is the site of the town of Big Sandy and nearby is a major &quot;dewatering area&quot;. This is an almost flat area (superficially resembling a tidal flat) which is flooded or not, depending on TVA&#x27;s assessment of a proper level for Kentucky Lake, taking into consideration flood control, navigation, electrical power needs, and recreation (in that order, according to the 1933 act establishing the Authority). Another, even larger, dewatering area is maintained by the help of an auxiliary dam on a tributary, West Sandy Creek.

Despite the extensive channelization activity, much of what the river must have been prior to this can be seen in the wetlands surrounding it near the Interstate 40 bridge and also along State Route 69 between Camden and Paris.

== Mercury contamination ==

The Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) has been collecting data on possible contaminates in the numerous fish species in the Big Sandy River and embayment. These studies started in 2009 and continued through 2014. After which an advisory was issued including all of the Big Sandy and its embayment on the Tennessee River. The advisory states that Largemouth bass and spotted bass can have mercury contamination, and that children, expecting mothers, and mothers who are breastfeeding should not consume them at all. The advisory goes on to state that all others should limit their consumption to these bass species to once per month. Mercury can have serious effects on the development of children.

Mercury contamination is contained in the muscular tissue of the fish, instead of the fat tissue like other contaminants. These larger predatory fish like the Largemouth and spotted bass become more contaminated, by biomagnification, as the mercury moves up the food chain. Producer organisms become contaminated, then the fish that eat them can become 10 times as contaminated as the level of the food chain below them, this contamination increases in strength as it moves up the food chain to these top predators in the environment. The contamination levels in other fish like the crappie, blue gill, shellcrackers, and catfish were all listed as safe to consume.

After the advisory was posted about the bass contamination, several members of the public expressed concerns to the TDEC at a public meeting, about possible contamination in the backwater area of the West Sandy Creek at Springville, TN. After the tested was completed an advisory was issued that Bass and Crappie in the backwater area, locally known as the Springville Bottom, had high levels of mercury contamination. The advisory follows:

<doc id="859159" wikidata="Q378264" url="?curid=859159" title="Johan Museeuw">
<text>Johan Museeuw (born 13 October 1965) is a retired Belgian professional road racing cyclist who was a professional from 1988 until 2004. Nicknamed &quot;The Lion of Flanders&quot;, he was particularly successful in the cobbled classics of Flanders and Northern France and was considered one of the best classic races specialists of the 1990s.

He won both the Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix three times and was road world champion in 1996. Other notable career achievements include two individual stage wins in the Tour de France, two final classifications of the UCI Road World Cup, two national road race championships and several classic cycle races. In 1996 he received the Vélo d&#x27;Or, awarded annually to the rider considered to have performed the best over the year.

==Early life and amateur career==
Born in Varsenare, Museeuw grew up in Gistel, West Flanders. His father Eddy had been a professional cyclist for two seasons, albeit without much success. As a junior and amateur, Museeuw practiced cyclo-cross in winter and had a few minor successes on the road.

==Professional career==

===1988–1989: The early years===
Johan Museeuw started his professional career in 1988 with ADR. In 1989 he was part of the ADR team with which Greg LeMond won his second Tour de France. During the Tour, Museeuw headed the peloton for days on end for his team leader who wore the yellow jersey as leader of the general classification.

===1990–1992: Sprinter===
In 1990 he signed for the Lotto team and won two prestigious stages in the 1990 Tour de France. He won the uphill-sprint stage to Mont Saint-Michel and the final stage of the Tour in Paris, both in a mass sprint. In an era of successful breakaways, he was an unfortunate sprinter, being unable to win further individual stages.

In 1991 he won several stage wins in smaller stage races and in August he won the Championship of Zürich, his first win in a World Cup race. In 1992 he placed third in Milan–San Remo, winning the peloton sprint behind Sean Kelly and Moreno Argentin. He won E3 Harelbeke, his first cobbled semi-classic race win, and the Belgian national road race title in Peer. He was second in the final points classification of the 1992 Tour de France behind Frenchman Laurent Jalabert for the second time. He did not win a stage, despite having won every peloton sprint behind a group of escapees that year.

===1993–1994: First classics victories===

In 1993 he moved to MG-GB, the team of manager Patrick Lefevere, with whom he developed a special friendship. With Lefevere, he converted from sprinter to classics specialist. He traded his powerful sprint for more endurance and stamina that allowed him to compete in the spring classics, specializing in the cobbled classics Paris–Roubaix and the Tour of Flanders. He had a strong spring campaign in 1993: after winning a stage in Paris–Nice and Dwars door Vlaanderen, he started as one of the favourites in the Tour of Flanders. Museeuw won the Tour of Flanders in a two-man sprint with Frans Maassen, taking his first win in a monument classic. In the 1993 Tour de France he wore the yellow jersey for two days after a strong prologue and team time trial, and he placed second in the final points classification a third time. At the end of 1993, he won Paris–Tours, taking his third World Cup win.
In 1994 he won Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne and was a front-runner in all cobbled classics, but could win none. He narrowly missed his second victory in the Tour of Flanders, when he was beaten by Gianni Bugno in the sprint by 7 mm. One week later, in Paris–Roubaix, he was in a furious pursuit of Andrei Tchmil, but suffered a mechanical failure on the cobbles and finished 13th. He ended his spring campaign with a victory in the Amstel Gold Race after a two-man sprint with Italian Bruno Cenghialta, his fourth World Cup win. In the Tour de France, he wore the yellow jersey again for three days, before losing it to Miguel Induráin in the long time trial to Bergerac. He ended the year in sixth position of the UCI Road World Rankings.

===1995–1997: World Cup and World Champion===
In 1995 his MG–GB team merged with Mapei–Clas, forming the strong Italian-Belgian Mapei team that dominated cycling&#x27;s classic races in the 1990s. He won the 1995 Tour of Flanders, earning him the nickname &quot;The Lion of Flanders&quot; in the Flemish media. Later he won the Championship of Zürich and won the final standings of the 1995 World Cup, confirming his status as the best one-day classic rider of the year.
In 1996 he won the Brabantse Pijl, but was third in the Tour of Flanders after suffering mechanical failure. The next week, he finally claimed his first victory in Paris–Roubaix. His Mapei–GB team dominated the race and Museeuw arrived together with his Italian teammates Gianluca Bortolami and Andrea Tafi on the Roubaix Velodrome. Team manager Patrick Lefevere received a phone call from the office of Mapei&#x27;s managing director, Giorgio Squinzi, ordering Museeuw to win the race. In the summer he won his second Belgian national road race title, but again failed to win a stage in the Tour de France. After a disappointing performance in Paris–Tours, where he wanted to secure his overall lead in the World Cup, he stated he intended to quit cycling altogether. He changed his mind and started the next week in the world championship road race, where he was not considered a favourite because of the mountainous course in Lugano. To the surprise of many, and on his 31st birthday, Museeuw became world champion after a long breakaway with Mauro Gianetti, beating the Swiss in a two-man sprint. Subsequently, he went on to win his second World Cup final standing.

In 1997 Museeuw started the year with three stage wins in the Ruta del Sol and Kuurne–Brussels–Kuurne, but failed to take another World Cup win. A crash in Milan–San Remo and the Tour of Flanders and a puncture in Paris–Roubaix prevented him from achieving success. He finished sixth in Liège–Bastogne–Liège, his best result in the Ardennes classic. He abandoned in the 18th stage of the Tour de France, in the rainbow jersey, after several unsuccessful attempts to win a stage in a breakaway. He went on to defend his world title in San Sebastián, but missed the winning breakaway and finished eighth.

===1998–2000: Injury-ridden years===
In 1998, one week after winning E3 Harelbeke and the Brabantse Pijl in the same weekend, he won the Tour of Flanders, thereby equaling the race&#x27;s record of three wins. One week later, Museeuw made a horrific fall in Paris–Roubaix on the Trouée d&#x27;Arenberg cobbled sector, leaving his kneecap shattered. On top came a dangerous gangrene infection which nearly forced doctors to amputate his left leg. He fought back and resumed cycling after a long healing process, finishing third in the Tour of Flanders of 1999 and ninth in Paris–Roubaix, exactly one year after his horror crash. In 2000 he won Paris–Roubaix a second time after a 44 km solo. Upon crossing the finish line in victory, he lifted his left leg, pointing to his knee as a reminder of the injury that had almost ended his career two years before. Later that year, he was seriously injured while riding a motor cycle with his wife and son. He suffered severe head trauma and spent several days in a coma. All three would recover, but it was his dogged determination that saw him again reach the pinnacle of the sport. His powerful riding style won him legions of fans all over the world and made him all the more popular in his native Flanders.

===2001–2002: Domo–Farm Frites===
In 2001 he moved with team manager Patrick Lefevere to Domo–Farm Frites, where he worked on his comeback after his second accident. He placed second in Paris–Roubaix and fifth in the Amstel Gold Race. He started a last time in the Tour de France, but abandoned in the Pyrenees stages.

In 2002 he was back on top of his game, with a second place in the Tour of Flanders and a third victory in Paris–Roubaix. His win in the &quot;Hell classic&quot; was his tenth victory in a World Cup race. Later the same year he won the HEW Cyclassics in Hamburg, totaling 11 World Cup wins.

===2003–2004: Final years===
In 2003 he followed Lefevere to the newly set up team. He won the Omloop Het Volk early in the season, but an illness obstructed his preparation for the classics. Towards the end of his career, he acted as a mentor to Tom Boonen, who was widely considered to be Museeuw&#x27;s successor as leading figure in the cobbled classics. In his last years as a professional he attempted to set a new record in the cobbled classics, aiming to win the Tour of Flanders or Paris–Roubaix a fourth time, but failed. With six combined victories in the Tour of Flanders and Paris–Roubaix, he held the record of combined victories in these races until Boonen improved it in 2012.

Museeuw ended his career in the spring of 2004 after 17 years as a professional and 59 professional victories. In his last classic race, the 2004 Paris–Roubaix, he punctured 5 km before the finish while riding in the leading breakaway, thereby losing his last chance of equalling Roger De Vlaeminck&#x27;s record. He finished in tears, in fifth place, together with his long-time rival Peter Van Petegem. Museeuw&#x27;s last race was three days later, the Scheldeprijs in Belgium, on 14 April 2004, won by his young teammate Tom Boonen. A farewell race was organized on 2 May in his home town Gistel. After his retirement, Museeuw took up a non-riding position with . He has donated many of his trophies to museums, including the Centrum Ronde van Vlaanderen, but retains three trophies from his Tour of Flander&#x27;s, Paris–Roubaix and World Championship wins.

==Doping==
In 2003 a doping allegation surfaced in which Museeuw was implicated. Press reports insinuated the use of human growth hormone which he obtained from veterinarian José Landuyt. Police authorities claimed that Museeuw had purchased banned substances in 2003. They recorded phone conversations between Museeuw and Landuyt speaking of &quot;wasps&quot; as a codeword for Aranesp, a synthetic hormone known to increase red blood cell levels. Despite the absence of direct evidence, it was ruled in 2004 that there was sufficient argument for his athletic suspension for two years and referral to the criminal court.

On 24 January 2007, Museeuw confessed to the charges in a press conference, revealing that he had &quot;not been completely honest in his last year as a professional, as he wanted to end his career in style&quot;, and announcing his resignation from his Quick Step team.

In December 2008 Museeuw was convicted for doping offences by a Belgian Court, together with former cyclists Jo Planckaert and Chris Peers who were involved in the same affair. Museeuw was given a 10-month suspended sentence, a fine of €2.500 and further litigations.

In September 2012 Museeuw gave an interview for Flemish newspaper Gazet van Antwerpen, stating that &quot;nearly every rider of his generation doped&quot;, thereby implicitly confessing to the true extent of his doping use. He also stated that he is convinced the current generation of riders is &quot;the cleanest cycling has ever seen&quot;. In 2018, he expressed concerns that, although comfortable about discussing former doping offences, he worries &quot;if we keep talking about [doping], the new generation cannot show that they are different&quot;.

<text>A flea circus is a circus sideshow attraction in which fleas are attached (or appear to be attached) to miniature carts and other items, and encouraged to perform circus acts within a small housing.

== History ==
The first records of flea performances were from watchmakers who were demonstrating their metalworking skills. In 1578, the London blacksmith Mark Scaliot produced a lock and chain that were attached to a flea. 

The first recorded flea circus dates back to the early 1820s, when an Italian impresario called Louis Bertolotto advertised an &quot;extraordinary exhibition of industrious fleas&quot; on Regent Street, London. Bertolotto&#x27;s flea shows included &quot;four card-playing fleas, a flea orchestra (allegedly playing audibly), and a reenactment of Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at Waterloo&quot;. Bertolotto&#x27;s book &quot;The History of the Flea&quot; (c. 1833) also promoted flea circuses. Flea performances with military themes such as staged &quot;sword fights&quot; among fleas, were popular in the 19th century.

Some flea circuses persisted in very small venues in the United States as late as the 1960s. The flea circus at Belle Vue Zoological Gardens, Manchester, England, was still operating in 1970. In 2013, there was still at least one genuine flea circus still performing (at the annual Oktoberfest in Munich, Germany) and Svensons in the UK occasionally use real fleas, but most flea circuses are a sideline of magicians and clowns, and use electrical or mechanical effects instead of real fleas.

== Techniques with real fleas ==

Fleas typically live only for a few months. They are observed to see if they have a predisposition for jumping or walking. Once sorted, they are harnessed by carefully wrapping a thin gold or copper wire around their neck. Once in the harness, the fleas usually stay in it for life. The harnesses are attached to the props and the strong legs of the flea allow them to move objects significantly larger than themselves. Jumping fleas are used for kicking small lightweight balls. They are carefully given a ball; when they try to jump away (which is not possible because of the harness), they shoot the ball instead. Running fleas can pull small carts and vehicles or rotate a Ferris wheel.

There are historical reports of fleas glued to the base of the flea circus enclosure. Miniature musical instruments were then glued to the flea performers and the enclosure was heated. The fleas fought to escape, giving the impression of playing instruments.

== Techniques without real fleas ==

Some flea circuses may appear to use real fleas, but in fact do not. A variety of electrical, magnetic, and mechanical devices have been used to augment exhibits. In some cases, these mechanisms are responsible for all of the &quot;acts&quot;, with loose fleas in the exhibit maintaining the illusion. These circuses are known as &quot;Humbug&quot; flea circuses. Michael Bentine gave a mechanical flea circus a regular slot on his television show &quot;It&#x27;s a Square World&quot; in the 1960s.

== Performers ==
Current flea circuses:
* Professor A.G. Gertsacov&#x27;s Acme Miniature Flea Circus has been touring the United States and Canada since 1996.
* Svensons have been performing in the UK since 1999, and have appeared in media and on television with sir David Attenborough.
* Swami Bill&#x27;s Flea Circus is featured at the Denver County Fair.
* Professor B&#x27;s Flea Circus has been performing in Northern California, USA for the last few years.
* The Flohcircus Birk at the Munich Oktoberfest in Germany.
* Professor Humbug&#x27;s Flea Circus performing at Seattle&#x27;s famous Pike Place Market.
* Captain Franko performs the flea circus across Europe from his base in France 

In the 1990s, María Fernanda Cardoso toured the world with her installation art flea circus.

Professor Heckler&#x27;s flea circus (in residence at Hubert&#x27;s Dime Museum in Times Square, New York, until 1957) can be seen in the background of the films &quot;The Thief&quot; and &quot;Easy Rider&quot;. L. Bertolotto ran a famous flea circus in Regent Street, London.

==In popular culture ==
Flea circuses have featured in cartoons, films, television shows, music, and novels.

Flea circuses are also prominently mentioned in the 1993 film &quot;Jurassic Park.&quot;

<text>Giambattista Basile ( – 23 February 1632) was an Italian poet, courtier, and fairy tale collector. His collections include the oldest recorded forms of many well-known (and more obscure) European fairy tales. He is chiefly remembered for writing the collection of Neapolitan fairy tales known as &quot;Il Pentamerone.&quot;

== Biography ==
Born in Naples into a middle-class family, Basile was a soldier and courtier to various Italian princes, including the doge of Venice. In Venice he began to write poetry. Later he returned to Naples to serve as a courtier under the patronage of Don Marino II Caracciolo, prince of Avellino, to whom he dedicated his idyll &quot;L&#x27;Aretusa&quot; (1618). By the time of his death he had reached the rank of &quot;Count&quot; &quot;Conte di Torone&quot;.

Basile&#x27;s earliest known literary production is from 1604 in the form of a preface to the Vaiasseide of his friend the Neapolitan writer Giulio Cesare Cortese. The following year his villanella &quot;Smorza crudel amore&quot; was set to music and in 1608 he published his poem &quot;Il Pianto della Vergine&quot;.

He is chiefly remembered for writing the collection of Neapolitan fairy tales titled &quot;Lo cunto de li cunti overo lo trattenemiento de peccerille&quot; (Neapolitan for &quot;The Tale of Tales, or Entertainment for Little Ones&quot;), also known as &quot;Il Pentamerone&quot; published posthumously in two volumes by his sister Adriana in Naples, Italy in 1634 and 1636 under the pseudonym Gian Alesio Abbatutis. It later became known as the &quot;Pentamerone&quot;. Although neglected for some time, the work received a great deal of attention after the Brothers Grimm praised it highly as the first &quot;national&quot; collection of fairy tales. Many of these fairy tales are the oldest known variants in existence. They include the earliest known European versions of &quot;Rapunzel&quot; and &quot;Cinderella&quot; (with the Chinese version of Cinderella dating from 850–60 AD). Tales of Pentamerone are set in the woods and castles of the Basilicata, in particular the city of Acerenza.

== In popular culture ==
The 2015 film &quot;Tale of Tales&quot; is a screen adaptation loosely based on his fairy tale collection.

<text>The peace lines or peace walls are a series of separation barriers in Northern Ireland that separate predominantly Irish republican or nationalist Catholic neighbourhoods from predominantly British loyalist or unionist Protestant neighbourhoods. They have been built at urban interface areas in Belfast and elsewhere.

The majority of peace walls are located in Belfast, but they also exist in other regions with more than of walls in Northern Ireland.

==History==
Although temporary peace walls were built in Belfast in the 1920s (in Ballymacarett) and 1930s (in Sailortown), the first peace lines of &quot;the Troubles&quot; era were built in 1969, following the outbreak of civil unrest and the 1969 Northern Ireland riots. They were initially built as temporary structures, but due to their effectiveness they have become wider, longer, more numerous and more permanent. Originally few in number, they have multiplied over the years, from 18 in the early 1990s to at least 59 as of late 2017; in total they stretch over , with most located in Belfast. They have been increased in both height and number since the Good Friday Agreement of 1998. Three-quarters of Belfast&#x27;s estimated 97 peace lines and related structures (such as gates and closed roads) are in the north and west of the city. These are also the poorer and more disadvantaged areas of Belfast. 67% of deaths during the sectarian violence occurred within of one of these &quot;interface structures&quot;.

The stated purpose of the peace lines is to minimise inter-communal violence between Catholics (most of whom are nationalists who self-identify as Irish) and Protestants (most of whom are unionists who self-identify as British).

The peace lines range in length from a few hundred metres (yards) to over . They may be made of iron, brick, steel or a combination of the three and are up to high. Some have gates in them (sometimes staffed by police) that allow passage during daylight but are closed at night.

In recent years, they have become locations for tourism. Black taxis now take groups of tourists around Belfast&#x27;s peace lines, trouble spots and famous murals.

The most prominent peace lines in the past few years separate the nationalist Falls Road and unionist Shankill Road areas of West Belfast; the nationalist Short Strand from the unionist Cluan Place areas of East Belfast, the unionist Corcrain Road and the nationalist Obins Drive in Portadown and the unionist Fountain Estate and nationalist Bishop Street area of Derry.

In 2008, a public discussion began about how and when the peace lines could be removed. Belfast City Council agreed to develop a strategy regarding the removal of peace walls on 1 September 2011. At the end of 2011, several local community initiatives resulted in the opening of a number of interface structures for a trial period. A study was released in 2012 indicating that 69% of residents believe that the peace walls are still necessary because of potential violence.

In January 2012, the International Fund for Ireland launched a Peace Walls funding programme to support local communities who want to work towards beginning to remove the peace walls. In May 2013, the Northern Ireland Executive committed to the removal of all peace lines by mutual consent by 2023.

In 2017, the Belfast Interface Project published a study entitled &quot;Interface Barriers, Peacelines &amp; Defensive Architecture&quot; that identified 97 separate walls, barriers and interfaces in Belfast. A history of the development of these structures can be found at the Peacewall Archive.

In September 2017, the Northern Ireland Department of Justice published its Interface Programme, established to deliver the commitment made by the Northern Ireland Executive to remove all Interface structures by 2023 under the Together: Building a United Community Strategy.

In September 2019, a series of events were held in Belfast to mark the anniversary of 50 years of peace lines in the city. This included an international conference alongside other events to discuss the past and possible future of the peace lines.

<text>Mary Margaret Wood (February 9, 1892 – March 18, 1978) was an American actress of stage, film, and television. She is best remembered for her performance as the title character in the CBS television series &quot;Mama&quot; (1949–1957), for which she was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series; her starring role as Naomi, Ruth&#x27;s mother-in-law, in &quot;The Story of Ruth&quot; (1960); and her final screen appearance as Mother Abbess in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), for which she received nominations for both an Academy Award and a Golden Globe Award.

==Career==
Mary Margaret Wood was born in Brooklyn, New York, the daughter of Eugene Wood, a journalist, and Mary Gardner, a telegraph operator. She studied voice in France with soprano Emma Calvé. Wood was an early member of the Actors&#x27; Equity Association, spending nearly 50 years onstage, beginning in the chorus and becoming known as a Broadway singer and star. Wood made her stage debut in 1910, as part of the chorus for &quot;Naughty Marietta&quot;. In 1917, she starred in &quot;Maytime&quot;, in which she introduced the song &quot;Will You Remember&quot;. She starred in several other musicals before playing the role of Portia in a 1928 production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;. From the late 1920s until the late 1930s, Wood had lead roles in musicals staged in London and New York. She was selected by Noël Coward to star in the original London production of his wildly successful operetta &quot;Bitter Sweet&quot;.

According to a 1920 profile, Wood also wrote plays &quot;in collaboration with her father and with Samuel Merwin.&quot; She was a member of the Algonquin Round Table.
In 1941, she starred in the New York premiere of &quot;Blithe Spirit&quot; as Ruth Condomine, whose husband is tormented by the ghost of his deceased first wife. Wood did not star in many films. Her few film appearances include roles in &quot;Jalna&quot;, &quot;A Star Is Born&quot;, &quot;Call It a Day&quot;, &quot;The Housekeeper&#x27;s Daughter&quot;, &quot;The Bride Wore Boots&quot;, &quot;Magnificent Doll&quot;, and &quot;Dream Girl&quot;. From 1949 to 1957, she played matriarch Marta Hansen on the popular series &quot;Mama&quot;, based on the 1943 Broadway play and 1948 film &quot;I Remember Mama&quot;. When General Foods cancelled the program, there was so much protest that CBS brought it back on Sunday afternoon, this time as a filmed series. As the network did not have all the affiliate station clearances that were needed, the show was put into syndication, where it was a huge success. Producers filmed 26 episodes. 

Following &quot;Mama&quot;, Wood was seen in episodes of &quot;Zane Grey Theatre&quot; and &quot;The Nurses&quot;. She co-starred with comedian Imogene Coca on Broadway in &quot;The Girls in 509&quot;. In October 1963, she and Ruth Gates appeared in the one-act play &quot;Opening Night&quot;, which played in off-Broadway. Wood portrayed Fanny Ellis, a once famous star who prepares for a performance; the play lasted 47 performances. Gates played &quot;Aunt Jenny&quot; on &quot;Mama&quot;, which starred Wood.

Wood returned to movies in the 1960 CinemaScope production &quot;The Story of Ruth&quot; in a co-starring role as the mother-in-law, Naomi, of the title character, although she pointed out the lack of verisimilitude in her own casting as a biblical matriarch, i.e. a &quot;blonde, blue-eyed Jewess&quot;. Her final screen appearance was as the Mother Abbess in &quot;The Sound of Music&quot; (1965), for which she was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress and the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress - Motion Picture. She was thrilled to be in the movie, but she knew she could no longer sing &quot;Climb Ev&#x27;ry Mountain&quot;. She was dubbed (for singing) by Margery MacKay. In her autobiography, Marni Nixon, who appeared in the film as Sister Sophia, said Peggy especially liked McKay&#x27;s singing voice because she sounded as Peggy did in her younger days. In 1969, Wood joined the cast of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as Dr. Kate Nolan, and had a recurring role until the end of the year.

==Other==
Her first autobiography &quot;How Young You Look&quot; was published by Farrar and Rinehart in 1941. The updated version &quot;Arts and Flowers&quot; appeared in 1963. She wrote a biography of actor John Drew, Jr. and a novel titled &quot;The Star Wagon&quot; as well as co-wrote the play &quot;Miss Quis&quot;. Wood received numerous awards for her theatrical work and for a while was president of the American National Theater and Academy (ANTA).

==Personal life==
Wood was married and widowed twice. Her first husband (poet/writer John Van Alstyne Weaver) died at the age of 44. She gave birth to their son (David Weaver) in 1927 at the age of 35. Her second husband (William H. Walling, whom she wed in 1946) was an executive in the printing business who died in 1973. They were married for 27 years. She was a devout Episcopalian and a member of the Episcopal Actors Guild.

==Death==
Wood died on March 18, 1978, at age 86, in Stamford, Connecticut, following a stroke.

<text>The city flag of Toronto, also known as the Toronto flag, was adopted by Toronto City Council and was designed by Renato De Santis and includes a white outline of Toronto City Hall on a blue field, and a red maple leaf at the base of the towers.

The first flag of Toronto was adopted by the former City of Toronto in 1967 and included the city&#x27;s coat of arms on a blue and white field. However, that flag was replaced by De Santis&#x27; design in 1974, a design that remained in use until 1998, when the former city was amalgamated into the new City of Toronto. A 1:2 proportioned version of De Santis&#x27; flag was adopted by the new City of Toronto in 1999.

== Description ==

The flag of Toronto includes a white outline of the twin towers of the Toronto City Hall slightly left-of-centre on a blue field. The red maple leaf from the Canadian flag sits at the base of the towers, representing the city council chambers. The shape of the space above and between the towers suggests the letter &#x27;T&#x27;, the city&#x27;s initial. The design adopted by the City of Toronto in 1999 is proportioned at 1:2, although its original design created by De Santis was proportioned at 2:3.

As a municipal flag, the flag of Toronto follows the flag of Canada, the flags of other sovereign countries, and flags of provinces and territories in Canadian flag etiquette.

A variation of this flag is used by Toronto Fire Services fireboats. The marine ensign consists of the city&#x27;s flag in the upper canton, with a lifebuoy on a two-tone blue background.

== History ==
===Former City of Toronto===
An early flag of Toronto was designed by Eric Arthur and his son, and adopted in 1967 by the former City of Toronto. It featured the city&#x27;s coat of arms imposed on a blue and white field. The design was criticized by the then mayor of Toronto, William Dennison.

On 28 August 1974, a committee was appointed by Toronto City Council to design a new flag. A competition to design a new flag was launched later that year that was open to all residents of Metropolitan Toronto. More than 700 submissions were received, more than half of which incorporated a maple leaf. A flag design committee, headed by Robert Woadden of the City of Toronto Archives, was created to select submissions from the competition.

The committee eventually submitted its selection to the city council on 6 November 1974, where its members unanimously voted for a design submitted by Renato De Santis, a 21-year-old graphic design student at George Brown College. On 7 November 1974, a flag-raising ceremony was conducted outside Toronto City Hall, where De Santis also received a prize of $500 for winning the competition. The flag used during the flag-raising was later stolen from the flagpole.

===Amalgamated Toronto===

In 1997, a new design competition was launched to find a new flag for the new amalgamated City of Toronto to be formed on 1 January 1998. The design competition in 1997 laid out more specific criteria than the competition in 1974, with designs being limited to three colours and a proportion of 1:2. The competition had a prize of $3000. However, no prize was ever awarded, with city council approving none of the 161 designs submitted they received.

After the design competition, Toronto City Council asked city design staff to submit their own proposals. The council eventually selected a design recommended by councillor Brad Duguid. During the council&#x27;s review of staff designs, De Santis had suggested his original design be modified to fit the 1:2 proportions desired by the city council. The two designs were put to the public during an open council meeting in November 1999, with De Santis&#x27; design being received the most favourably by the public in attendance. The council voted to adopt De Santis&#x27; modified old design by a vote of 31 to 14.

== Flags of Metropolitan Toronto ==

From 1954 to 1998, the former city of Toronto and its surrounding municipalities formed a part of an upper-tier municipal government known as Metropolitan Toronto.

By the end of the 1970s, Metropolitan Toronto, along with its six lower-tier municipalities, had adopted regional or municipal flags to represent their respective jurisdictions. East York was the last municipality in Metropolitan Toronto to adopt a municipal flag, having adopted a design in 1978 after holding a flag design contest.

The Metropolitan Toronto government eventually adopted its own flag, which consisted of the region&#x27;s six-ringed emblem on the left side, representing Metropolitan Toronto&#x27;s six regions centred vertically on a blue and green background. Use of the Metropolitan Toronto flag was discontinued in 1998 with the dissolution of Metropolitan Toronto and the amalgamation of its lower-tier municipalities into the new City of Toronto.

Proposals have been made to reintroduce a modified version of the Metropolitan Toronto flag as a new flag of Toronto, with its supporters claiming the design better represents the various areas amalgamated into the city.

<doc id="859183" wikidata="Q5019584" url="?curid=859183" title="Calfkiller River">
<text>The Calfkiller River is a stream in the east-central portion of Middle Tennessee in the United States. It is a tributary of the Caney Fork, and is part of the Cumberland, Ohio, and Mississippi watersheds. The river is believed to be named for a Cherokee chief who once lived in the area.

==Course==

The river rises at the base of the Cumberland Plateau, just southwest of Monterey in eastern Putnam County, with the convergence of several smaller streams that drop off the Plateau. Several of these headwater streams are impounded at the Plateau&#x27;s edge, including one which forms Monterey Lake. The river then winds its way southward, slicing a broad valley in an otherwise hilly section of the Eastern Highland Rim. State Highway 84 (known as Calfkiller Highway in Putnam County and Monterey Highway in White County) runs roughly along the western bank of the river&#x27;s upper section.

After crossing into White County, the river&#x27;s valley broadens as it veers southwestward and continues through a series of rural communities. Just south of Sparta, the river passes under Highway 84, which continues along the river&#x27;s east bank. In Sparta, the river continues southward, flanked by steep embankments, especially along the east bank. The City of Sparta maintains a park along the west bank of the river on both sides of the US 70 (Bockman Way) bridge. The Old Sparta Cemetery, which rests atop a hill in downtown Sparta, offers a sweeping view of this section of the river.

Just south of Sparta, the river bends sharply around the Camp Heights area before turning southward again. The river spills over an old dam once used by the Sparta Hydroelectric Plant and passes under State Highway 111, which follows the river&#x27;s eastern bank for several miles. The river then continues through rural White County, passing about a mile east of Doyle before emptying into the Caney Fork at river mile 104. This section of the Caney Fork, part of Great Falls Lake, provides the county line between White and Van Buren County. Hodges Bridge Road crosses the Caney Fork immediately downstream from the Calfkiller&#x27;s mouth.

==Watershed==

The watershed of the Calfkiller River covers 175 square miles. Several of the river&#x27;s tributaries originate atop the Cumberland Plateau, including Whetstone Creek, which is part of the river&#x27;s headwaters, Bridge Creek, which empties into the river just south of the Putnam-White county line, Doe Creek, which joins the river near the Big Spring community, and Wildcat Creek, which empties into the river near Sparta, and is noted for its waterfall visible from Highway 70 east of the town. Tributaries that enter river&#x27;s western bank include Plum Creek and Cherry Creek, near the Yankeetown community, and Mill Creek, near the river&#x27;s headwaters.

==History==
According to &quot;Goodspeed&#x27;s History of White County&quot;, the Calfkiller River is likely named after a Cherokee chief who lived in the valley when the first European-American settlers arrived in the area around 1800, following the American Revolutionary War. Throughout the early 19th century, they harnessed the river to power numerous small gristmills. In the years before the Civil War, an iron works and a cotton mill operated along the banks of the river in the vicinity of the current TN-111 bridge.

A number of Civil War skirmishes were fought along the Calfkiller River. On August 9, 1863, Union forces under Charles Minty attacked a Confederate scouting detachment under George Dibrell near Wildcat Creek, eventually scattering the Rebels after intense fighting. Another skirmish occurred on November 30 of that year, when a band of Confederate guerrillas unsuccessfully ambushed a detachment of the U.S. First Tennessee Cavalry at Yankeetown. On February 22, 1864, a band of Confederates under John Hughes attacked a detachment of the Fifth Tennessee Cavalry along the river, in what became known as the &quot;Battle of Dug Hill.&quot; Hughes reportedly captured and executed over a dozen federals. Confederate guerrilla leader Champ Ferguson, who lived in the Calfkiller Valley, is buried in France Cemetery, along the banks of the river near the Putnam-White county line.

In 1902, the Sparta Light and Power Company built a small waterwheel-powered electric plant just downstream from Sparta. After this plant burned in 1907, it was replaced by a more modern plant that used a concrete dam to divert water through a flume to a powerhouse located downstream. The plant operated until the 1930s, when the Tennessee Valley Authority began providing electricity to the area from major hydroelectric projects. The dam is still visible from the TN-111 bridge, and has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<doc id="859195" wikidata="Q1960919" url="?curid=859195" title="1999 NHL entry draft">
<text>The 1999 NHL entry draft was the 37th NHL entry draft. It was held on June 26 at the FleetCenter in Boston. According to &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; and other sports news agencies, at the time the 1999 draft was considered one of the deepest in talent in years, headed by Patrik Stefan and the Sedin twins, Daniel and Henrik.

As a result of the draft lottery, the first three picks going into draft day were held by the Tampa Bay Lightning, the Atlanta Thrashers expansion team, and the Vancouver Canucks, respectively. The Canucks were determined to select both Sedins and therefore initiated a trading carousel involving multiple teams. After the trading was done, the Lightning had traded out of the first round altogether while the Thrashers held the first overall pick. However, Atlanta had also agreed not to draft either of the Sedin twins. The Thrashers therefore selected Stefan while the Canucks used the second and third picks to select the Sedins.

The overall impact in the NHL of players selected has not matched that of the neighboring drafts. An example is how many first round picks have played the equivalent of an entire regular season ten seasons after the 1999 draft; only 16 out of 28 first round picks in 1999 have played 82 NHL games, while the same statistic applies to 23 out of 27 players in 1998 and 21 out of 30 players in 2000. In addition, while the Sedin twins have excelled in the NHL, only Barret Jackman and Martin Havlat were still active players of the other 26 first-round picks in the NHL 15 years after the draft.

The last active player in the NHL from the 1999 draft class was Craig Anderson, who retired after the 2022–23 season, although he was re-drafted in 2001.

==Draftees based on nationality==
==Sedin Trades==

Vancouver GM Brian Burke was determined to draft Daniel and Henrik Sedin, after their performance at the 1999 IIHF World Championship in Oslo, Norway. He began by complementing his existing third overall pick by trading defenseman Bryan McCabe and Vancouver&#x27;s 1st-round pick in the 2000 Draft (used to select Pavel Vorobiev) to the Chicago Blackhawks for the fourth overall pick. Then he obtained the first overall pick from Tampa Bay, flipping Chicago&#x27;s fourth overall pick — which the Lightning subsequently traded to the Rangers, who used it to draft Pavel Brendl — and two third-round selections. Vancouver and Atlanta then worked out a deal whereby Atlanta, who held the second overall selection, promised to select Patrik Stefan with the first overall pick, leaving both Sedins available to Vancouver at 2nd and 3rd.

<text>Patrick Yu Shuk Siu (; August 22, 1922 – January 12, 2019) was a celebrated trial and appellate lawyer in Hong Kong.

==Biography==
Born into an intellectual Chinese family (father Yu Wa was an educator) in Hong Kong, with ancestry from Taishan, Guangdong, Yu was educated at home for many years before attending Wah Yan College Hong Kong, a prominent Jesuit high school in Hong Kong. In 1938, at the age of sixteen, he was admitted to the University of Hong Kong, where he studied in the arts program as a Government Scholar.

In 1941, shortly after the Pacific War had broken out, Yu served with British Naval Intelligence and was commissioned as an officer in the Intelligence Corps of the Army of the Republic of China. In 1945, Yu was awarded a Victory Scholarship by the Government of Hong Kong to continue his studies in England. He studied at Merton College, Oxford, from 1946 to 1948, and later passed his Bar Examination.

Jobless and almost penniless, Yu was forced to find himself a profession. Within a 10-month period, he familiarised himself with all the &quot;niceties&quot; of the English common law, studying in the Bar Library at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn. In 1949, he passed the bar exam of England and Wales and practised briefly as a chancery barrister in London.

In 1950, Yu moved to Malaya for a short period to work in his uncle&#x27;s (Yong Shook Lin) firm Shook Lin &amp; Bok. He soon went back to Hong Kong, and in 1951 became the first Chinese person to be appointed Crown Counsel of that British colony. Yu resigned in 1953 and commenced a private practice.

He soon built up a sterling reputation as an advocate, and by the mid-1960s he had already become the top criminal lawyer in town. It was also during this time he helped to establish the first law school in Hong Kong, &quot;The Faculty of Law of the University of Hong Kong&quot;. For that, he received an Honorary LLD degree from the University of Hong Kong.

In the 1970s, Yu was offered a judgeship on the Supreme Court of Hong Kong, an invitation he declined. Two similar offers were made during the decade. Yu declined both on the grounds of the discriminatory employment terms. Yu was also known for his refusal to apply to become Queen&#x27;s Counsel, a mark of distinction envied by many practitioners in Hong Kong, the United Kingdom and in many other Commonwealth countries.

In 1983, after thirty years of private practice, Yu decided to retire. He became an autobiography author and story-teller, and has published two volumes of memoirs and stories since.

He became a life member of the Hong Kong bar association in 1994.

He is a cousin of Yong Pung How, former Chief Justice of Singapore, and his younger daughter is married to the younger son of Sir Ti Liang Yang, former Chief Justice of Hong Kong.

Yu died on 12 January 2019.

<text>Lily Braun (2 July 1865 – 8 August 1916), born Amalie von Kretschmann, was a German feminist writer and politician of the Social Democratic Party (SPD). She developed the idea of the single-kitchen home.

== Life ==

She was born in Halberstadt, in the Prussian province of Saxony, the daughter of , General of the Infantry in the Prussian Army, and his wife Jenny, née von Gustedt (1843–1903). Her maternal grandmother, the writer Jenny von Gustedt (1811–1890), was an illegitimate daughter of Jérôme Bonaparte, Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s brother and King of Westphalia, and his mistress Diana Rabe von Pappenheim. Lily Braun&#x27;s great-niece, Marianne von Kretschmann, married Richard von Weizsäcker, president of Germany from 1984 to 1994.

Raised according to the Prussian virtues of order and discipline from her father&#x27;s military career, Braun nevertheless developed a direct and open personality, encouraged in particular by her grandmother . She was considered to be highly ambitious, and her family provided her with a broad education by numerous private teachers. From an early age, she began to question her parents&#x27; bourgeois values as influenced by Lutheranism and Calvinism as well the position of women in Prussian society. When her father retired in 1890, Braun had to establish a sustainable livelihood herself.

In 1893, Braun married to , a professor of philosophy at the Frederick William University in Berlin, who was associated with the Social Democratic Party without however being a member. Together with him she was involved in the ethical movement, which sought to establish a system of morality in place of the traditional religions. Also, she became concerned with the ideas of socialism and the feminist movement, working as a journalist for the feminist newspaper &quot;&quot; (The Women&#x27;s Movement) issued by Minna Cauer.

After her first husband&#x27;s death, she married in 1896 Heinrich Braun, who was a Social Democratic politician and a publicist. The couple had one son, Otto Braun, a talented poet who was killed at the Western Front in the last months of World War I.

Braun joined the SPD at an early age and became one of the leaders of the German feminist movement. Within the party, she belonged to the revisionist opposition within the SPD, which did not believe in the theories of historical materialism, but aimed for a gradual change in society, rather than a socialist revolution. Her attempts to mediate between proletarian and bourgeois feminist circles and proposals on reconciliation of family and working life were highly criticized. Her answers to the woman question were rejected by socialist authors like Clara Zetkin, while middle-class circles considered her ideas too radical.

Like her fellow political activist Helene Stöcker, Braun was strongly influenced by Friedrich Nietzsche; she and her husband wanted the SPD to focus on the development of personality and individuality. They believed women should have their own personality and should not have to be regarded only as (future) mothers and wives. Braun wanted economic freedom for women and advocated new types of personal relations up to the abolition of legal marriage.

Deeply concerned about the fate of her son, Braun died in Zehlendorf (today part of Berlin) from the consequences of a stroke at the age of 51, in the midst of World War I. After her death, her second husband Heinrich Braun married Julie Braun-Vogelstein, who was also the editor of Lily Braun&#x27;s &quot;Collected Works&quot;.

<doc id="859205" wikidata="Q3011060" url="?curid=859205" title="D. J. Carey">
<text>Denis Joseph Carey (born 11 November 1970) is an Irish former hurler who played as a left wing-forward at senior level for the Kilkenny county team.

Carey began his hurling career at club level with Young Irelands. He broke onto the club&#x27;s top adult team as a 17-year-old in 1988 and enjoyed his first success in 1992 when the club won the Kilkenny Intermediate Championship title and promotion to the top flight of Kilkenny hurling. Carey later won Kilkenny Senior Championship medals as captain in 1996 and 2002. He made numerous championship appearances in three different grades of hurling for the club before retiring after a 25-year club career in 2013.

At inter-county level, Carey was part of the successful Kilkenny minor team that won the All-Ireland Championship in 1988 before later the All-Ireland Championships with the under-21 team in 1990. He joined the Kilkenny senior team in 1988. From his debut, Carey was ever-present as a forward and made a combined total of 138 National League and Championship appearances in a career that ended with his last game in 2005. During that time he was part of five All-Ireland Championship-winning teams – in 1992, 1993, 2000, 2002 and 2003. Carey also secured ten Leinster Championship medals and four National Hurling League medals. He announced his retirement from inter-county hurling on 1 June 2006.

Carey&#x27;s granduncle, Paddy Phelan, won four All-Ireland medals with Kilkenny. His aunt, Peggy Carey, won four All-Ireland medal with the Kilkenny camogie team. Carey&#x27;s brother, Martin, was sub goalkeeper on the Kilkenny team for a number of years.

Carey has been described as &quot;GAA&#x27;s first superstar&quot; and a &quot;hurling legend&quot;. During his playing days he won nine All-Star awards, as well as being named Texaco Hurler of the Year on two occasions. He has been repeatedly voted onto teams made up of the sport&#x27;s greats, including on the Kilkenny Hurling Team of the Century in 2000 and on a special Leinster Hurling Team (1984-2009). Carey&#x27;s omission from the Hurling Team of the Millennium was seen as controversial at the time.

In retirement from playing, he became involved in team management and coaching. At club level he has trained the Young Irelands junior hurling team, while he has also served as hurling coach at Carlow Institute of Technology. Carey&#x27;s business and personal life has also been the subject of significant coverage.

==Biography==
Denis Joseph Carey was born in Kilkenny, in 1970. He was born into a large family, with three brothers and three sisters. One of his sisters, Catriona Carey, was a member of the Ireland women&#x27;s national field hockey team, as well as being part of the Kilkenny senior camogie team. His brother, Martin Carey, was also a member of the Kilkenny hurling panel as a substitute goalkeeper for a number of years. Several members of Carey&#x27;s extended family have also played hurling and camogie. His aunt, Peggy Carey, won four All-Ireland camogie titles with Kilkenny and his granduncle, Paddy Phelan, was an inter-county hurler of the 1930s and was selected on the GAA Hurling Team of the Century and the GAA Team of The Millennium.

Carey&#x27;s private life, involving his wife and two children, had long been the subject of intense media scrutiny and rumour. News of the breakdown of his seven-year marriage hit the headlines shortly before the All-Ireland final in 2003 although Carey and his wife had been separated for more than a year. A year later Carey spoke for the first time about the marriage break-down and of finding new love with British-born millionaire Sarah Newman. Carey and Newman, who is also a celebrity and television personality, have since separated.

===Controversy and criminal proceedings===
Carey began a number of business ventures after retiring, including D.J. Carey Enterprises. Based in his home village of Gowran, it was a wholesale company selling hygiene products to other businesses. His former partner Sarah Newman, who was a director of DJ Carey Enterprises, called in the auditors in 2012, and a series of discrepancies were found. Around this time, two of his other businesses collapsed with major losses to creditors. D.J. Carey Enterprises was dissolved in 2016. In 2017, Carey&#x27;s debts of over €9.5m were written down to €60,000.

In 2017, Allied Irish Banks (AIB) reportedly agreed to write-down a €9.5 million debt associated with Carey. AIB, which was majority state-owned at the time, was asked to speak to an Oireachtas committee about the arrangement in early 2023. Bank transfers, made to Carey in 2020 by his sister Caitriona (who had previously worked at the same business), were also reputedly the subject of &quot;Garda scrutiny&quot; in early 2023.

On 29 September 2023 Carey was charged with a number of counts of deception and forgery. It is alleged that Carey falsely stated he had cancer to induce people to give him money. He is accused of 21 fraud and forgery offences against 25 people over an eight-year period. His trial is due to start on 2 July 2025.

==Playing career==
===St Kieran&#x27;s College===
Carey first came to prominence as a hurler with St Kieran&#x27;s College in Kilkenny. He played in every grade of hurling before joining the college&#x27;s senior hurling team as a 16-year-old. On 22 March 1987, Carey was listed amongst the substitutes when St. Kieran&#x27;s College faced Birr Community School in the Leinster final. He was introduced as a substitute and collected a winners&#x27; medal following the 4–08 to 3–09 victory. On 10 May 1987, Carey lined out at right corner-forward when St Kieran&#x27;s College played St Flannan&#x27;s College from Ennis in the All-Ireland final. He scored a point from play but ended on the losing side following a 4–11 to 1–07 defeat.

On 27 March 1988, Carey lined out at right corner-forward when St Kieran&#x27;s College faced Enniscorthy CBS in the Leinster final. He claimed a second successive winners&#x27; medal after scoring 2–05 in the 8–17 to 1–06 victory. Carey retained his position at right corner-forward for the All-Ireland final on 8 May 1988. He scored two points from play and claimed his first All-Ireland medal after a 3–10 to 2–07 defeat of Midleton CBS.

Carey lined out in a third successive Leinster final on 15 April 1989. He scored 1-05 from full-forward in the 1-07 apiece draw with Birr Community School. Carey retained the full-forward position for the replay on 23 April 1989 but was limited to just a point from play in the 2–11 to 1–09 victory. On 8 May 1989, he lined out in a third successive All-Ireland final. Carey received a pain-killing injection just before the match but scored 3-03 and collected a second successive winners&#x27; medal following the 3–05 to 1–09 defeat of St Flannan&#x27;s College.

===Young Irelands===
Carey joined the Young Irelands club at a young age and played in all grades at juvenile and underage levels. He became a regular member of the club&#x27;s top adult team during the 1988 Kilkenny Intermediate Hurling Championship.

On 24 September 1989, Carey was just 18-years-old when he played in his first Kilkenny Intermediate Championship final. Lining out in goal he ended the game on the losing side following a 2–13 to 0–14 defeat by Mullinavat.

Carey lined out in a second Kilkenny Intermediate Championship final on 27 October 1991, however, by now he was lining out at centre-forward. He scored 1-02, including a goal from a penalty, in the 4–09 to 2–08 defeat by Dicksboro.

On 18 October 1992, Carey lined out in a second successive Kilkenny Intermediate Championship final - his third overall.

<doc id="859208" wikidata="Q5138446" url="?curid=859208" title="Coat of arms of the Washington family">
<text>The first coat of arms of a member of the Washington family is first documented in the 14th century, borne by one of the male Washington family members of Washington Old Hall in County Durham, England.

The design (three red stars over two horizontal red bars on a white field) has been used since 1938 as the basis for the coat of arms and flag of the District of Columbia. It is also found on the Purple Heart.

These elements have also been said to have inspired the &quot;stars and stripes&quot; design of the Flag of the United States. However, despite some visual similarity, there is &quot;little evidence&quot; or &quot;no evidence whatsoever&quot; to support the claimed connection. The &quot;Digital Encyclopedia of George Washington&quot;, published by the Fred W. Smith National Library for the Study of George Washington at Mount Vernon, calls it an &quot;enduring myth&quot; backed by &quot;no discernible evidence.&quot; Instead, the story seems to have originated in the 1876 play &quot;Washington: A Drama in Five Acts&quot;, by the English poet Martin Farquhar Tupper, and was further popularized through repetition in the children&#x27;s magazine &quot;St. Nicholas&quot;.

==History==
The Washington family traces its roots to Sir William de Hertburn who was granted the lordship of Wessyngton in northeast England and adopted the name of the estate. The early arms showed a lion rampant in 1203. In 1346, a new design with two horizontal bars below three mullets, though with the tinctures reversed from the later arms, is recorded for Sir William de Hertburn/de Wessyngton&#x27;s great-grandson. At the end of the 14th century, the current design is recorded. The family scattered in various parts of the country over the next century. One branch of the family, which later moved to the Colony of Virginia, settled in Northamptonshire, England. In 1592, Robert Cook, Clarenceux King of Arms confirms upon Lawrence Washington of Sulgrave Manor the current coat of arms.
In a letter dated 7 December 1791, George Washington received the confirmation from Sir Isaac Heard, Garter Principal King of Arms of the College of Arms in London. He responds that &quot;the arms are the same that are held here by certain ancestral family member.&quot; The President used the coat of arms in many places around his home at Mount Vernon including on several personal items as well as on the livery uniforms of his servants, as this was a common practice prior to the American Revolution among wealthy plantation owners. 

It was the first coat of arms recorded in the Committee on Heraldry of the New England Historic Genealogical Society&#x27;s &quot;Roll of Arms.&quot;

==Variations and similar arms==
Some authorities in the twelfth century displayed the arms with the colours reversed (&quot;gules two bars argent, in chief three mullets of the second&quot;). An almost identical coat of arms was used by the Le Moyne family, who were described as landowners at Grafham in Huntingdonshire in the reign of Henry II. Their arms were: &quot;Argent, two bars Sable, in chief three mullets of the second&quot;, with only the colour of the mullets and bars being different. The Washington University in St. Louis seal, developed in 1896, uses elements from George Washington&#x27;s coat of arms.

==Other uses==
Washington coat of arms served as inspiration for the Flag of Washington, D.C. The coat of arms is also on the Purple Heart decoration awarded by the United States Armed Forces.

==Architectural occurrences==
*The oldest surviving occurrence may be a stained glass window in the Old Library of Trinity College, Oxford. The window is believed to have been moved from what was the chapel of Durham College, Oxford. Durham College was created for the training of Benedictine monks from Durham Abbey. Durham College was disestablished by Henry VIII. Sir Thomas Pope purchased the site in 1555 and used it for the creation of Trinity College. Henry the VIII tainted the Washington family by guilt of association from two associates that committed violation against the King. 
*The Washington Window in Selby Abbey, in the British market town of Selby, contains a variant of the Washington coat of arms in the original 14th-century stained glass. It is thought to be a benefaction to the abbey to commemorate John Wessington, Prior of Durham (1416–1446). The arms are distinguished from the usual Washington arms by having pierced mullets.
*The Washington coat of arms can also be seen at the parish church in Garsdon, near Malmesbury, Wiltshire, where a branch of the family moved in Tudor times. A Washington memorial accompanies it.
*Washington coat of arms is engraved in stone in the porch of an ancient church in the tiny Dorset hamlet of Steeple, a church that incidentally lacks a steeple. The Washington coat of arms is also painted in scarlet on the roof interior, quartered with those of the squires of Steeple village, the Lawrence family, who are allied with the Washingtons by the marriage of one of its sons, Edmund Lawrence to Agnes de Wessington in 1390.
*The Washington coat of arms is engraved in stone inside a side room in the church in the small Lancashire village of Warton (near Carnforth), near a pub named the George Washington. The flag of the US capital hangs prominently in the church, presented on 25 July 1977 by Walter E. Washington (no relation), mayor of Washington, D.C., from 2 January 1975 – 2 January 1979
*The Washington coat of arms can be seen (with the colours reversed) on a memorial to John Wessington in the cloisters of Durham Cathedral, where he was Prior.
*The Washington coat of arms is engraved in stone in the parish church of Thrapston in Northamptonshire. George Washington&#x27;s ancestor, Sir John Washington, was mayor of the town in the seventeenth century.
*The Washington coat of arms can be seen with many coat of arms in a stained glass window in St Laurence Church in Chorley, the same place where it is said to be the birthplace of Myles Standish.
*The Washington coat of arms can be seen in stone in the parish church of St John in Wickhamford, Worcestershire, on the grave of Penelope Washington, whose father, Colonel Henry Washington, was the first cousin of George Washington&#x27;s grandfather Lawrence. The coat of arms is lozenge-shaped, as is the custom for women in England.
*The Washington coat of arms can be seen in stone on the outside of Hylton Castle, Sunderland, an 11th-century fortified manor house.
*The Washington coat of arms appears in a memorial to Lawrence Washington (died 1619), great-uncle of Lawrence Washington, great-great-grandfather of George Washington, in All Saints Church, Maidstone.
*The Washington coat of arms can be seen in a memorial window in All Saints&#x27; Church in Maldon, Essex, where Lawrence Washington was buried in the graveyard.
*The Washington coat of arms is engraved in stone on the tomb of the first Lawrence Washington (died 1619) in the chancel of Great Brington&#x27;s parish church of St Mary.
*The Washington coat of arms is placed prominently above the entrance door at Sulgrave Manor in Northamptonshire, the home built in 1560 by Lawrence Washington (d. 1584) George Washington&#x27;s direct ancestor. The family coat of arms can also be seen in stained glass panels in the Great Hall which show marriage arms of several families that married into the Washington family. These are copies of the original stained glass windows, which were moved into the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Fawsley.
*The Washington coat of arms, quartered with that of Kitson, whose family married into that of Washington, can be seen in a stained glass window in Hengrave Hall in Suffolk.
*The Washington coat of arms appears with many other coats of arms in the main east stained glass window of St Martin&#x27;s Church, Bowness-on-Windermere (Cumbria), in the fifth light from the left, on the top row.
* The Washington coat of arms appears in stone on the grave of a James Washington (d. 1580) in the north chapel of the parish church of Saint Laurence in Adwick-le-Street, South Yorkshire, where he was lord of the manor. However, there is no proven ancestral link between him and George Washington.
* Reverend Godfrey Washington, the great uncle of George Washington, who died on 28 September 1729 is buried in Little St Mary&#x27;s Church, Cambridge. His memorial is on the north wall close to the main door.

<doc id="859211" wikidata="Q6747302" url="?curid=859211" title="Manchester Central Convention Complex">
<text>Manchester Central Convention Complex (commonly known as Manchester Central or GMEX (Greater Manchester Exhibition Centre)) is an exhibition and conference centre converted from the former Manchester Central railway station in Manchester, England. The building has a distinctive arched roof with a span of – the second-largest railway station roof span in the United Kingdom, and was granted Grade II* listed building status in 1963.

After 89 years as a railway terminus, it closed to passengers in May 1969. It was renovated as an exhibition centre formerly known as the G-Mex Centre in 1982 and was Manchester&#x27;s primary music concert venue until the construction of the Manchester Arena. After renovation the venue reverted to its former name Manchester Central in 2007.

From April 2020 until March 2021, the complex became a temporary field hospital for non-critical COVID-19 patients, part of a network of temporary NHS Nightingale Hospitals.

== History ==

=== Manchester Central railway station ===
The complex was originally Manchester Central railway station, one of the city&#x27;s main railway terminals.

Designed by Sir John Fowler, the station was opened in July 1880 by the Cheshire Lines Committee. The station served as the terminus for Midland Railway express trains to London St Pancras. The station&#x27;s large wrought-iron single-span arched roof, spanning , long and high – was a noted piece of railway engineering and is the widest unsupported iron arch in Britain after the Barlow train shed at London St Pancras.

At its height, in the 1930s, more than 400 trains passed through the station every day.
The station operated for 89 years, before closing in May 1969.

=== GMEX Centre ===

In 1978, the structure was acquired by Greater Manchester County Council to redevelop as a concert venue. In 1982, construction work was undertaken by Alfred McAlpine. It was the centrepiece of the regeneration plan for the area and wider Castlefield district. The hall covered and could be partitioned into various sized units for different exhibitions. Initial construction work concentrated on repairing the derelict structure and re-pointing brickwork which took 18 months. The Greater Manchester Exhibition Centre or G-Mex Centre was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1986 after four years of renovation.

In 2001, the Manchester International Convention Centre (MICC) was added, comprising an 804-seat auditorium and breakout rooms and the Great Northern Hall. In 2005, the company running the complex was bought by Manchester City Council. G-Mex was Manchester&#x27;s primary concert venue from 1986 to 1995. Its position as a concert venue diminished after the opening of the Manchester (then NYNEX) Arena in 1995.

=== Manchester Central ===
In January 2007, the venue was renamed Manchester Central, evoking the memory of the former station and converted into an exhibition and conference centre. The building was renovated at a cost of £30 million in 2008 by Manchester-based architects, Stephenson Bell. The first phase to create a foyer took from February to November 2008.

The second phase, completed towards the end of 2009, included an extended foyer to the Grade II listed Central Hall. The old smoked-glass structure was demolished and replaced by a flat-roofed, clear-glazed structure exposing more of the original architecture. The final phase, completed in September 2010, focused on the rear of the building. New event spaces were built and rooms refurbished to increase the venue&#x27;s range and size of meeting and banqueting spaces.

== Events ==
During its days as the GMEX Centre, the venue was used for hosting rock concerts. Not long after its official opening, Factory Records used the venue for their Festival of the Tenth Summer in July 1986 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of punk in the city, and included appearances by the Smiths and Factory Records stalwarts New Order. James appeared in 1990, U2 in June 1992, Metallica in November 1992 on their &quot;The Black Album&quot; tour and the Cure in November 1992. G-Mex had a seating capacity of 9,500 for end stage concerts and 12,500 for standing events and stopped hosting concerts in 1997, with the last gig by Oasis in December. G-Mex was also the 2002 Commonwealth Games venue for gymnastics, weightlifting, judo and wrestling.

After a nine-year break, it was again used for concerts by Snow Patrol in December 2006 with Morrissey, the Verve, Marilyn Manson, Franz Ferdinand, Manic Street Preachers, Arctic Monkeys, Bloc Party and Hard-Fi holding concerts in 2007. Status Quo have performed there multiple times. The venue hosted concerts by Placebo in December 2009, Arcade Fire, Biffy Clyro, Thirty Seconds to Mars, the Taste of Chaos Tour 2010, deadmau5, Pendulum in December 2010 and the Eighth Plague Tour. In 2011, it hosted the Girls&#x27; Day Out Show.

In 2009 and 2010, it played host to the Manchester audition stages of the ITV programme &quot;The X Factor&quot;. In December 2012, it hosted the finals of series 9 of &quot;The X Factor&quot;.

In September 2006, the Labour Party moved from traditional seaside venues to hold its annual party conference at the complex. It has also hosted conferences for the Confederation of British Industry, ECOFIN, the Liberal Democrats, the Conservative Party and the Green Party of England and Wales.

The venue was also the filming location of &quot;Ninja Warrior UK&quot; between 2015 and 2019.

The venue was selected to host the final of the 2021 Wheelchair Rugby League World Cup, which saw England beat France 28–24 to lift their second world cup title equalling the record set by the runners-up.

==Transport==
Located in the heart of the city, Manchester Central is served by two Metrolink tram stops – Deansgate-Castlefield tram stop and St Peter&#x27;s Square tram stop, both of which are under a five-minute walk from the venue. National Rail local train services serve Deansgate railway station whilst Manchester Piccadilly is a 20-minute walk away.

==Emergency hospital==

On 27 March 2020, the UK government announced that the building would be converted into an emergency hospital, part of a network of NHS Nightingale Hospitals similar to the NHS Nightingale Hospital London that was already under construction, intended to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and with 1,000 beds. It opened on 17 April 2020, and was closed in March 2021.

<doc id="859217" wikidata="Q3696997" url="?curid=859217" title="Citron-crested cockatoo">
<text>The citron-crested cockatoo (&quot;Cacatua citrinocristata&quot;) is a medium-sized cockatoo with an orange crest, dark grey beak, pale orange ear patches, and strong feet and claws. The underside of the larger wing and tail feathers have a pale yellow color. The eyelid color is a very light blue. Both sexes are similar. Females have a copper colored eye where as the male has a very dark black eye.

They are endemic to Sumba in the Lesser Sunda Islands in Indonesia. The diet consists mainly of seeds, buds, fruits, nuts and herbaceous plants.

In 2022, Birdlife International recognized the citron-crested cockatoo as a separate species, &quot;Cacatua citrinocristata&quot;, assessed as Critically Endangered, while the International Ornithological Congress designated it to be a species in 2023.

==Conservation status==

The citron-crested cockatoo is a critically endangered bird whose population has declined due to habitat loss and illegal trapping for the cage-bird trade. A 1993 survey of Sumba estimated the species&#x27; numbers at less than 2,000 individuals. By 2012, the estimate had dropped to 563, and as of 2019 the population numbers are estimated to be 1,200-2,000 individuals with 800-1,320 mature individuals. It is listed in appendix I of the CITES list. Consequently, international trade is strongly regulated and trade in wild caught citron-crested cockatoos is illegal.

<doc id="859219" wikidata="Q1645344" url="?curid=859219" title="Silver Spoons">
<text>Silver Spoons is an American sitcom television series that aired on NBC from September 25, 1982, to May 11, 1986, and in first-run syndication from September 27, 1986, to May 30, 1987. The series was produced by Embassy Television for the first four seasons, until Embassy Communications moved the series to syndication after being canceled by NBC. &quot;Silver Spoons&quot; was created by Martin Cohan, Howard Leeds and Ben Starr.

The show focuses on the wealthy playboy Edward Stratton III, and his relationship with his young son Ricky Stratton. Ricky was the product of a brief marriage between Edward and Ricky&#x27;s mother. Edward was unaware that he had a son until Ricky comes to live with Edward at the outset of the series. The main cast stars Joel Higgins as Edward, Ricky Schroder as Ricky, Leonard Lightfoot as Edward&#x27;s attorney, Franklyn Seales as Edward&#x27;s business manager, and Erin Gray as Edward&#x27;s personal assistant and later love interest. Jason Bateman plays Ricky&#x27;s best friend over the first two seasons of the show, replaced by Alfonso Ribeiro over the remaining seasons. John Houseman plays Edward&#x27;s dour and disapproving father.

==Synopsis==
In the pilot episode, Ricky Stratton (Ricky Schroder) arrives at the mansion of the father he has never met to introduce himself, move in, and get to know him better. Edward Stratton III (Joel Higgins) epitomizes the phrase &quot;overgrown child&quot;; he has never taken responsibility for anything in his life, including his toy business, Eddie&#x27;s Toys. Ricky recognizes that his father needs to grow up; Edward thinks his son is too uptight and needs to have more fun while he is still young.

Edward&#x27;s father (Edward Stratton II) is played by John Houseman as the intelligent, well-to-do patriarch and industrialist whose demeanor starkly contrasts with Edward&#x27;s and seems more similar to Ricky&#x27;s (at first). Throughout the series, the comic tension arises between Grandfather Stratton&#x27;s belief that people with money are obligated to make more money and Edward&#x27;s belief that money should be used to make people happy. Ricky is often caught between the two, wishing only for peace and harmony within the family.

Ricky&#x27;s mother is Edward&#x27;s ex-wife, Evelyn Stratton Whiting (Christine Belford). Edward and Evelyn&#x27;s romantic relationship led to a week-long marriage. Now Evelyn has remarried and placed Ricky in a military boarding school. When Ricky arrives at the Stratton residence, Edward is stunned to discover that his long-ago brief marriage produced a son (when he expresses incredulity because he &quot;wasn&#x27;t married that long,&quot; Ricky points out, &quot;It doesn&#x27;t &quot;take&quot; that long&quot;). At first, he sends Ricky right back to the boarding school; later he dresses up as a swamp monster to take Ricky out of the school and back to the mansion to live with him. The mansion is stocked with arcade games and a ridable scale-model freight train runs through it.

Edward exhibits his childishness and playfulness in many ways, such as performing a little dance while the &quot;Pac-Man&quot; game plays its theme song. Stratton&#x27;s personal assistant, Kate Summers (Erin Gray), is often the voice of reason. Kate&#x27;s role adds tension to the show and provides incentive for Edward to act more maturely (at least sometimes). Edward and Kate&#x27;s will-they-or-won&#x27;t-they relationship gives way to a third-season wedding.

During the series&#x27; early years, Ricky befriends &quot;bad boy&quot; Derek Taylor (Jason Bateman, seasons 1–2), smooth-talking &quot;cowboy&quot; J.T. Martin (Bobby Fite, seasons 1–2), and &quot;nerdy&quot; Freddy Lippincottleman (Corky Pigeon, seasons 1–4). They get into a lot of trouble and learn many childhood lessons along the way. Leslie Crambottom, played by Georgi Irene, has a major crush on Ricky.

Edward&#x27;s original attorney was Leonard Rollins (Leonard Lightfoot), who departed after the first season, and was replaced by the aptly named business manager, Dexter Stuffins (Franklyn Seales), who was somewhat stuffier and more erudite than Leonard had been. Dexter remained through the rest of the series and was joined in autumn 1984 by his hip, breakdancing nephew Alfonso Spears (Alfonso Ribeiro, seasons 3–5), who became Ricky&#x27;s new best friend. Once Ricky, Freddy, and Alfonso were in high school in season four, their circle was completed by Brad (Billy Jacoby, seasons 4–5), a reintroduction of the type of &quot;bad-boy&quot; character similar to that of Derek during the show&#x27;s early years. That year, as Kate and Edward adjusted to married life, Kate&#x27;s doddering uncle, Harry Summers (Ray Walston), moved into the Stratton mansion.

==Production==

===Music===
The show&#x27;s theme song titled &quot;Together&quot;, was written by Rik Howard and Bob Wirth. The original version was accompanied mostly by guitar with vocals by Ron Dante. Two other versions of the theme were used during the show&#x27;s run. A synthesized version was used in 1985 with a different vocalist. The third version of the theme, a rock version, was introduced in January 1986 and began in use during the second half of season 4 with vocals again by Ron Dante and composed by Ray Colcord.

===Locations===
Although the location of the show took place was fictional Mockingbird Lane, Shallow Springs, Long Island New York, the brick Tudor period mansion shown in the opening credits (representing the Stratton mansion) is actually a private residence located in Warwickshire, England. The elaborate home, named Compton Wynyates, was built in 1481. Before &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, it was used in the 1977 Disney film &quot;Candleshoe&quot;, starring Helen Hayes, Jodie Foster and David Niven.

<doc id="859225" wikidata="Q6542202" url="?curid=859225" title="Liberty of the Mint">
<text>The Mint was a district in Southwark, south London, England, on the west side of Borough High Street, around where Marshalsea Road is now located. It was so named because a mint authorised by King Henry VIII was set up in Suffolk Place, a mansion house, in about 1543. The mint ceased to operate in the reign of Mary I and Suffolk Place was demolished in 1557. In the late-17th and early-18th centuries, the area was known for offering protection against prosecution for debtors due to its legal status as a &quot;liberty&quot;, or a jurisdictional interzone.

==History==
In 1550, the City of London acquired two manors from Edward VI&#x27;s government. They comprised the former holding of Bermondsey Abbey on the west side of Borough High Street (see also King&#x27;s Manor, Southwark) and that of the Archbishop of Canterbury on the east side . The charter retained the mansion and grounds of the Duke of Suffolk, known as Suffolk Place and Southwark Place that had been assigned to Edward&#x27;s mother by Henry VIII. On the accession of Mary I she assigned it to the Archbishop of York for his London palace, and that diocese began to lease the estate for development, mainly of the highest density and poorest quality; the area became a rookery of slums. The 1550 charter&#x27;s exemption from the city&#x27;s control of the neighbouring manor created a separate jurisdiction, the &quot;Liberty of the Mint&quot;. &quot;The Mint&quot; therefore, became an Alsatia (so called after the area of Whitefriars), a haunt of criminals and fugitives.

Such anomalous districts attracted particular denizens, and the Mint&#x27;s primary population was debtors. Those in danger of being thrown into debtors&#x27; prison could hide in the Mint. Once there, debtors risked arrest if they were found outside of its boundary. Debt collectors (known as &quot;duns&quot;) stood along the main roads out of the Mint to wait for suspected debtors. Sometimes they were bill collectors in the modern sense, and sometimes thugs who beat and seized the debtor. Inside the Mint, life was hard. Since debtors could not leave (except on Sunday, when no debts could be collected), they could not find employment to raise money to pay off their debts. Those who attempted to leave on Sundays to get money from friends or lenders were called &quot;Sunday gentlemen&quot;, as they attempted to appear prosperous to hoodwink lenders.

Debtors who went to the Mint frequently died of malnutrition or were murdered before raising enough money to escape. The Mint&#x27;s geography was a factor in its poor living standard, as it was below the river&#x27;s level and was a breeding ground for sewage- and water-borne maladies. Daniel Defoe describes life there for his heroine Moll Flanders in the novel of the same name.

In 1723, the Mint lost its protected status as a result of The Mint in Southwark Act 1722 and at the same time, imprisonment for debts of less than £50 was abolished, and many residents left without fear of arrest. The area was a slum into the 19th century. By that time, its reputation as a haunt for the poorest of the poor ensured that it had a lower standard of living than the rest of London. Elsewhere in 19th century London new roads were laid through slum areas to eliminate them, but Southwark Bridge Road, constructed in 1819 to Southwark Bridge, swerved around the western side of the Mint.

In the later 19th century its reputation as one of London&#x27;s worst rookeries was sustained when conditions there were exposed by the Rev Andrew Mearns in &quot;The Bitter Cry of Outcast London&quot; (1883) and by George R. Sims in &quot;How the Poor Live&quot; (1883). The scandal created by Mearns&#x27; and Sims&#x27; revelations prompted a Royal Commission in 1884–1885 but the destruction of the Mint was underway. From 1881 to 1886, associated with the construction of Marshalsea Road, the area was cleared of most of its slums, although even in 1899 some remnants of the rookery were still in place between Red Cross Street and Borough High Street.

The Mint is referred to by most 18th-century British satirists, including Alexander Pope in his &quot;Epistle to Dr Arbuthnot&quot; and, indirectly, by John Gay in &quot;Trivia&quot;. It is the refuge of the outlaw Jack Sheppard in William Harrison Ainsworth&#x27;s novel &quot;Jack Sheppard&quot; (1839) and in the novel &quot;The System of the World&quot; by Neal Stephenson.

The only remnant of the Mint is a street in the location named &quot;Mint Street&quot;.

<doc id="859226" wikidata="Q311730" url="?curid=859226" title="Bombay duck">
<text>Harpadon nehereus, commonly known as the Bombay duck or bummalo, is a species of lizardfish. Adults may reach a maximum length of , but the usual size is around .

== Etymology ==

The small bomelon fish caught in Bombay (now Mumbai) was traditionally coated in asafoetida and dried in the sun, becoming pungent with a strong salty taste. Fried and crumbled, the fish preparation called Bombay duck became a popular condiment in Anglo-Indian cookery.

An 1829 book of poems and &quot;Indian reminiscences&quot; published under the pseudonym &quot;Sir Toby Rendrag&quot; notes the &quot;use of a fish nick-named &#x27;Bombay Duck&#x27;&quot; and the phrase is used in texts as early as 1815.

== Distribution and fisheries ==

The Bombay duck lives in the tropical areas of the Indo-Pacific, with a discontinuous distribution along the Indian coast. It has traditionally been caught in the waters off Maharashtra, Gujarat in the Lakshadweep Sea, where it is an important item of the yearly catch. It is fished in the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea in smaller numbers.

== International availability ==

Following the discovery of a batch of imported seafood contaminated by &quot;Salmonella&quot; in 1996, the European Commission prohibited fish imports from India other than from approved freezing and canning factories. As Bombay duck is not produced in a factory, this meant it too was banned. After a campaign to &quot;Save Bombay Duck&quot;, the Indian High Commission approached the European Commission, which adjusted its regulations so that the fish can still be dried in the open air, but has to be packed in an &quot;EC approved&quot; packing station. A Birmingham wholesale merchant located a packing source in Mumbai, and the product became available again.

<text>Beef aging or ageing is a process of preparing beef for consumption by aging it, in order to break down the connective tissue within the meat.

==Dry-aged beef==

Dry-aged beef is beef that has been hung or placed on a rack to dry for several weeks. After the animal is slaughtered and cleaned, it is hung as a full or half carcass. Primal (large distinct sections) or sub primal cuts, such as strip loins, rib eyes, and sirloin, are placed in a refrigerator unit, also known as a &quot;hot box&quot;. This process involves considerable expense, as the beef must be stored near freezing temperatures. Subprimal cuts can be dry aged on racks either in specially climate-controlled coolers or within a moisture-permeable drybag. Moreover, only the higher grades of meat can be dry aged, as the process requires meat with a large, evenly distributed fat content. Because of this, dry-aged beef is seldom available outside of steak restaurants and upscale butcher shops or groceries. The key effect of dry aging is the concentration and saturation of the natural flavour, as well as the tenderization of the meat texture.

The process changes beef by two means. Firstly, moisture is evaporated from the muscle. The resulting process of desiccation creates a greater concentration of beef flavour and taste. Secondly, the beef&#x27;s natural enzymes break down the connective tissue in the muscle, which leads to more tender beef.

The process of dry-aging usually also promotes growth of certain fungal (mold) species on the external surface of the meat. This does not cause spoilage, but rather forms an external &quot;crust&quot; on the meat&#x27;s surface, which is trimmed off when the meat is prepared for cooking. These fungal species complement the natural enzymes in the beef by helping to tenderize and increase the flavor of the meat. The genus &quot;Thamnidium&quot;, in particular, is known to produce collagenolytic enzymes which greatly contribute to the tenderness and flavor of dry-aged meat.

Dry-aged beef is typically not sold by most supermarkets in the U.S. today, because it takes time, the meat loses weight, and there is a risk of spoilage. Dry-aging can take from 15 to 28 days, and typically up to a third or more of the weight is lost as moisture. This type of beef is served in higher-priced steakhouses and by select restaurants.

Dry-aging can be done at home under refrigeration by three means: open air, with the presence of salt blocks, and with the use of a moisture permeable drybag to protect the meat while it is aging. Since the mid-2010s, some chefs have experimented with a &quot;quick&quot; or &quot;cheat&quot; dry-age by coating a cut of beef with ground koji (rice inoculated with &quot;Aspergillus oryzae&quot;) to simulate the effect of traditional dry-aging; the results are not quite the same, but can be achieved within 48 to 72 hours. The koji technique can also be applied to chicken and shrimp.

When dry aging using a moisture permeable material, surface mold growth is not present, flavor and scent exchange within the refrigerated environment is not a concern, and trim loss of the outer hardened surface is measurably reduced. The flavor and texture profile of the beef is similar on all dimensions to the traditional open air dry-aged results.

Historically, it was common to store mutton or beef joints at room temperature for extended periods; even after the invention of refrigeration hanging sides of beef in large coolers for a few weeks as part of the processing was standard.

==Wet-aged beef==
Wet-aged beef is beef that has typically been aged in a vacuum-sealed bag to retain its moisture. Since the 1970s, with the development of vacuum packing machines and related technology, this has become the dominant mode of aging beef in the US and UK. It is popular with producers, wholesalers and retailers because it takes less time: typically only a few days and there is no moisture loss, so any given piece of meat sold by weight will have a higher value than a dry aged piece where moisture loss is desired for taste at the expense of final weight. The beef is usually kept for a period of 4 to 10 days in wet aging. Modified-atmosphere packaging (MAP) is usually employed for the vacuum packaging of meat; typically between 60 and 80 percent oxygen to retain its appetizing color, with red meat such as beef needing a higher oxygen level than less vividly colored meat such as pork. The vacuum packed beef is stored at a temperature of .

<text>The Iron Butt Association (IBA) is a US-based organization dedicated to safe long-distance motorcycle riding, which claims membership of over 75,000 people.

The IBA is a loose-knit organization with only one way to earn membership: ride one of the several rides the IBA certifies. The minimum is the Saddle Sore 1000 – in 24 hours or less.

==History==

The Iron Butt Rally first ran in 1984 with 10 riders. From 1984 to 1987 the rally started from Montgomeryville Cycle Center near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The Iron Butt was not held again until 1991 when it came under the management of the Iron Butt Association. While the basic format of the original rally remained, two important things changed: to ensure the quality of the event, the rally is run every other year, and the starting and ending points are rotated to different locations within the United States. 107 riders started and 89 finished the latest Iron Butt Rally, which ran in 2017.

Beginning in 1993, shorter rides were arranged that lasted in duration from one to many days, and while the Iron Butt Rally is a large, organized event with a plotted course, the other rides are left up to the competitor to accomplish at their own accord. Some riders prefer to complete a ride solo, while some clubs have arranged rides in groups of up to 30 riders. But while the rally is a monitored event, the riders of other events must monitor themselves. An example is the Saddle Sore 1000, where thorough documentation of the ride must be made, by collecting time-stamped gas and business receipts along the way, and by keeping a trip log recording mileage and location. These documents are then submitted by mail with a fee to the IBA, where it is then processed and an award given if the requirements are met.

The Iron Butt Association has members around the world. Those in the UK run their own rally each year called the Brit Butt Rally, a 12-hour rally and Jorvik Rally a short 8 rally Riders from all over Europe, Norway, Middle East and Australia have entered. There is also a 12-hour teaser rally called the Brit Butt Light. Iron Butt UK has grown from seven registered riders in 2005 to over 350 riders completing Iron Butt rides within the UK during 2009. Iron Butt UK also teamed up with the Royal British Legion Riders branch in organizing a 24-hour 1000 mile run with over 175 riders taking part. The previous world record was 152, however the UK riders were pipped to the post by another US ride of over 400 riders.

Currently the association is headed by Michael J Kneebone.

==IBA sanctioned events==

The IBA suggests several types of long-distance rides to challenge riders. It is perhaps best known for the Iron Butt Rally, an organized event that is invitation only, through a raffle system. Additionally, the Iron Butt Association hosts the Saddle Sore 1000, the Bun Burner 1500, the Bun Burner Gold, the 50 cc Quest, the National Parks Tour Master Traveler Award, the coveted 10/10ths Challenge, the very exclusive 100K Club, and other longer themed rides taking place on different routes around the world. Besides the Iron Butt Rally, none of these rides are organized events, but rather individual endeavors planned and executed by individual riders on routes and at times they choose.

===Iron Butt Rally===

The Iron Butt Rally is a competitive motorcycle road rally held in the United States. It was first held in 1984, and beginning in 1991, now takes place in odd numbered years, usually in August. The rally lasts 11 days, and riders often travel over in that time. During the rally, entrants earn points by riding their motorcycles to various &quot;bonus&quot; locations in the U.S. and Canada. A bonus is a task or destination with a point value. To earn the points for a bonus, a rider must provide evidence by photographing an object or scene, purchasing a particular item, or by various other means specified by the organizers.

The rally consists of one or more checkpoints, which may be located anywhere the United States, and one or more lists of bonuses with locations, times of availability (if limited), and varying point values. Each leg of the rally has its own bonus list, and only the bonuses for the leg currently being ridden are known to riders and can be earned. A bonus list typically contains far more bonuses than can be earned in the time allotted during a leg. This introduces a significant strategic element to the rally, since each rider must determine for him/herself which bonuses to attempt, and what route to use to reach them, while still reaching the next checkpoint before it closes.

Entry into the Iron Butt Rally is by lottery only and every lottery entry must be an Iron Butt Member first.

To be considered a finisher of the event, a rider must be present at each of the checkpoints within a specific time window, and must earn a minimum number of bonus points during the rally. Additional achievement levels (gold, silver, bronze) can be reached by earning more than the minimum required points.

Themes are often employed, with 2011 being about visiting U.S. states and their capitals; 2009 were crime scenes; 2007 was about gateway and arches (i.e. Perce Rock on the Atlantic, St. Louis Arch, and Golden Gate Bridge on the Pacific); and 2005 was about lighthouses.

First-time finishers are assigned a 3-digit number membership to replace their previously assigned number...that often are five digits in length and over 1,000. As of 2019, slightly more than 600 people have officially finished the Iron Butt Rally. In 2019, Wendy Crockett became the first woman to win the rally.

=== Books ===
Many books have either focused on or featured the Iron Butt Rally, some of the most notable of which are listed here. In 1997, Ron Ayres published &quot;Against the Wind: A Rider&#x27;s Account of the Incredible Iron Butt Rally&quot;, chronicling his experience in the 1995 rally. Joel Rappoport published &quot;Hopeless Class&quot; in 2012 about his Iron Butt Rally experience in 2009. Finally, Melissa Holbrook Pierson&#x27;s &quot;The Man Who Would Stop at Nothing: Long Distance Motorcycling&#x27;s Endless Road&quot; features the IBA in a broader discussion of the long-distance riding subculture.

===Documentaries===

In 2007, a feature-length documentary, &quot;Hard Miles&quot;, was produced about that year&#x27;s Iron Butt rally. The DVD chronicled the riders, organizers, routes, strategy, controversy and myriad other details. The high-definition video was received as a welcome update to the small list of professional media on the subject.

The 2009 rally was also filmed for a documentary DVD called &quot;Hard Miles 2&quot; and included additional material and interviews away from checkpoints. No documentary was made for 2011.

===Common Rides (SS1000, BB1500, BBG1500)===

The Saddlesore and Bun-Burner were started in California by the California Motorcycle Touring Association (CMTA). These were originally fixed-course group-rides. Pressure soon came from many riders who could not make the annual trek to California, so Les Martin, the driving force behind the CMTA, offered a ride that could be completed anywhere.
When Les retired in 1993, the CMTA stopped holding and certifying 1000-in-24 and 1500-in-36 rides, and donated the Saddlesore 1000 and Bun-Burner events to the Iron Butt Association, which had not previously administered a 1000-in-24 ride. 
Since then the IBA has been sponsoring the Saddlesore 1000 (1,000 miles in 24 hours) and the Bun-Burner (1,500 miles in 36 hours), and added the more extreme Bun-Burner Gold (1,500 miles in 24 hours).

===50 cc Quest===

Not to be confused with a ride for bikes limited to 50 cc of displacement, the 50 cc Quest is named for riding across the United States from Coast to Coast in less than 50 hours. It was originally conceived by Dave McQueeney as a New York to San Francisco trip of . In the first ten years of its existence only ten riders were officially recognized to successfully complete it. In the meantime a ride from Jacksonville, Florida to San Diego, California has become the most popular route, as it is only long.

===100CCC===
Two 50cc Quests done back to back (coast to coast to coast) in 100 hours or less. This is considered an Extreme Ride.

===National Parks Tour Master Traveler===

The object of the IBA&#x27;s National Parks Tour is to take some time to visit the hundreds of National Parks, National Historic Sites, National Recreation Areas, and National Monuments located in the United States and Canada.

The riders must purchase a &quot;Passport to Your National Parks&quot; book, then proceed to visit at least 50 of these sites or parks listed in the Passport book in at least 25 states and provinces within the period of one year. Start and finish times are up to the rider, as long as the time frame does not exceed the one year allotment.

===10/10ths Challenge===

 in 10 days.

===The 100K Club===

The Iron Butt Association&#x27;s 100K Club consists of riders who have ridden more than in one year.

=== RBLR 1000 ===
The Iron Butt Association in the United Kingdom and The Royal British Legion Riders Branch (RBLR) jointly organize the annual RBLR 1000 event.
The RBLR is a motorcyclist&#x27;s branch of The Royal British Legion, a veterans&#x27; organization. In 2018 the RBLR 1000 raised over UK£33,000 for the Poppy Appeal. 2019 it will be around the same. 2019 was the tenth running of the event

<doc id="859234" wikidata="Q184550" url="?curid=859234" title="Mechanical energy">
<text>In physical sciences, mechanical energy is the sum of macroscopic potential and kinetic energies. The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if an isolated system is subject only to conservative forces, then the mechanical energy is constant. If an object moves in the opposite direction of a conservative net force, the potential energy will increase; and if the speed (not the velocity) of the object changes, the kinetic energy of the object also changes. In all real systems, however, nonconservative forces, such as frictional forces, will be present, but if they are of negligible magnitude, the mechanical energy changes little and its conservation is a useful approximation. In elastic collisions, the kinetic energy is conserved, but in inelastic collisions some mechanical energy may be converted into thermal energy. The equivalence between lost mechanical energy and an increase in temperature was discovered by James Prescott Joule.

Many devices are used to convert mechanical energy to or from other forms of energy, e.g. an electric motor converts electrical energy to mechanical energy, an electric generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy and a heat engine converts heat to mechanical energy.

==General==
Energy is a scalar quantity, and the mechanical energy of a system is the sum of the potential energy (which is measured by the position of the parts of the system) and the kinetic energy (which is also called the energy of motion):

formula_1

The potential energy, &quot;U&quot;, depends on the position of an object subjected to gravity or some other conservative force. The gravitational potential energy of an object is equal to the weight &quot;W&quot; of the object multiplied by the height &quot;h&quot; of the object&#x27;s center of gravity relative to an arbitrary datum:

formula_2

The potential energy of an object can be defined as the object&#x27;s ability to do work and is increased as the object is moved in the opposite direction of the direction of the force. If &quot;F&quot; represents the conservative force and &quot;x&quot; the position, the potential energy of the force between the two positions &quot;x1&quot; and &quot;x2&quot; is defined as the negative integral of &quot;F&quot; from &quot;x1&quot; to &quot;x2&quot;:

formula_3

The kinetic energy, &quot;K&quot;, depends on the speed of an object and is the ability of a moving object to do work on other objects when it collides with them. It is defined as one half the product of the object&#x27;s mass with the square of its speed, and the total kinetic energy of a system of objects is the sum of the kinetic energies of the respective objects:

formula_4

The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that if a body or system is subjected only to conservative forces, the mechanical energy of that body or system remains constant. The difference between a conservative and a non-conservative force is that when a conservative force moves an object from one point to another, the work done by the conservative force is independent of the path. On the contrary, when a non-conservative force acts upon an object, the work done by the non-conservative force is dependent of the path.

==Conservation of mechanical energy==
According to the principle of conservation of mechanical energy, the mechanical energy of an isolated system remains constant in time, as long as the system is free of friction and other non-conservative forces. In any real situation, frictional forces and other non-conservative forces are present, but in many cases their effects on the system are so small that the principle of conservation of mechanical energy can be used as a fair approximation. Though energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can be converted to another form of energy.

===Swinging pendulum===
In a mechanical system like a swinging pendulum subjected to the conservative gravitational force where frictional forces like air drag and friction at the pivot are negligible, energy passes back and forth between kinetic and potential energy but never leaves the system. The pendulum reaches greatest kinetic energy and least potential energy when in the vertical position, because it will have the greatest speed and be nearest the Earth at this point. On the other hand, it will have its least kinetic energy and greatest potential energy at the extreme positions of its swing, because it has zero speed and is farthest from Earth at these points. However, when taking the frictional forces into account, the system loses mechanical energy with each swing because of the negative work done on the pendulum by these non-conservative forces.

===Irreversibilities===
That the loss of mechanical energy in a system always resulted in an increase of the system&#x27;s temperature has been known for a long time, but it was the amateur physicist James Prescott Joule who first experimentally demonstrated how a certain amount of work done against friction resulted in a definite quantity of heat which should be conceived as the random motions of the particles that comprise matter. This equivalence between mechanical energy and heat is especially important when considering colliding objects. In an elastic collision, mechanical energy is conserved – the sum of the mechanical energies of the colliding objects is the same before and after the collision. After an inelastic collision, however, the mechanical energy of the system will have changed. Usually, the mechanical energy before the collision is greater than the mechanical energy after the collision. In inelastic collisions, some of the mechanical energy of the colliding objects is transformed into kinetic energy of the constituent particles. This increase in kinetic energy of the constituent particles is perceived as an increase in temperature. The collision can be described by saying some of the mechanical energy of the colliding objects has been converted into an equal amount of heat. Thus, the total energy of the system remains unchanged though the mechanical energy of the system has reduced.

===Satellite===
A satellite of mass formula_5 at a distance formula_6 from the centre of Earth possesses both kinetic energy, formula_7, (by virtue of its motion) and gravitational potential energy, formula_8, (by virtue of its position within the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field; Earth&#x27;s mass is formula_9).
Hence, mechanical energy formula_10 of the satellite-Earth system is given by
formula_11
formula_12

If the satellite is in circular orbit, the energy conservation equation can be further simplified into
formula_13
since in circular motion, Newton&#x27;s 2nd Law of motion can be taken to be
formula_14

==Conversion==

Today, many technological devices convert mechanical energy into other forms of energy or vice versa. These devices can be placed in these categories:
* An electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy.
* A generator converts mechanical energy into electrical energy.
* A hydroelectric powerplant converts the mechanical energy of water in a storage dam into electrical energy.
* An internal combustion engine is a heat engine that obtains mechanical energy from chemical energy by burning fuel. From this mechanical energy, the internal combustion engine often generates electricity.
* A steam engine converts the internal energy of steam into mechanical energy.
* A turbine converts the kinetic energy of a stream of gas or liquid into mechanical energy.

==Distinction from other types==

The classification of energy into different types often follows the boundaries of the fields of study in the natural sciences.

* Chemical energy is the kind of potential energy &quot;stored&quot; in chemical bonds and is studied in chemistry.
* Nuclear energy is energy stored in interactions between the particles in the atomic nucleus and is studied in nuclear physics.
* Electromagnetic energy is in the form of electric charges, magnetic fields, and photons. It is studied in electromagnetism.
* Various forms of energy in quantum mechanics; e.g., the energy levels of electrons in an atom.

<text>Landru (US title: Bluebeard) is a 1963 French-Italian crime drama film directed by Claude Chabrol. The screenplay was written by Françoise Sagan. The film stars Charles Denner, Michèle Morgan, Danielle Darrieux and Hildegard Knef.

It was based on the story of French serial killer Henri Désiré Landru, who murdered and dismembered more than 10 women during World War I.

==Plot==
During World War I, the seemingly respectable middle-aged man Henri Landru has devised an ingenious means of obtaining money to supplement his dwindling income. Adopting various assumed names, he lures middle-class women to his villa at Gambais, just outside Paris. There he kills them and burns their bodies. He then helps himself to his victims’ bank accounts, so that he can keep his wife, his mistress and his four children in the manner to which they have grown accustomed.

Having murdered ten women and one boy, Landru is finally captured and placed before a court of law. Eloquent in his protestations of innocence, he is confident that no jury will condemn a man of such intellect and breeding.

<text>WUNC (91.5 MHz) is a listener-supported public radio station, serving the Research Triangle area of North Carolina. It is licensed to Chapel Hill and is operated by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. On weekdays, WUNC carries National Public Radio, American Public Media, Public Radio Exchange, and BBC programming in an &quot;all-news-and-information&quot; format, including shows such as &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and &quot;Fresh Air&quot;. On weekends, in addition to NPR weekend shows, WUNC broadcasts locally produced folk music programming. The longest-running continuously produced program offered by the station is &quot;Back Porch Music&quot;, a weekly folk and traditional music program. WUNC holds periodic on-air fundraisers seeking listener contributions.

The station operates five full-service FM repeater stations, [[WFSS]] from Fayetteville on 91.9; [[WRQM]] from Rocky Mount on 90.9; WBUX from Buxton on 90.5; WUND-FM from Columbia on 88.9; WUNW-FM from Welcome on 91.1; and WZCO from Chadbourn on 89.9. WUNC should not be confused with WXYC, which is UNC&#x27;s student radio station.

As of January 2024, WUNC has the second highest ratings of any station in the Raleigh–Durham radio market.

==History==
WUNC was originally on the air for a brief time as an AM station in the 1940s, then returned to the air in 1952 as a student-run FM station with equipment from Jefferson Standard Broadcasting, which had operated WBT-FM for several years. The original station stayed on the air until a lightning strike in 1970.

WUNC signed on in its current incarnation on April 3, 1976. It immediately became the state&#x27;s second NPR member. One of its earliest shows was &quot;Gary Shivers on Jazz&quot;, a jazz program produced by the station and syndicated regionally. (Shivers was the station&#x27;s first program director and second General Manager.) WUNC had studios in Swain Hall on the UNC campus; it moved to a state-of-the-art studio near the Friday Center in 1999. Prior to its switch to a news and information format, the station was a multi-format station of NPR news, classical music, and jazz music.

WRQM began in 1992 as a separate NPR station under the call sign WESQ, licensed to North Carolina Wesleyan College in Rocky Mount. NCWC set up the station to fill the void left by the closure of WVSP, an African-American public radio station licensed to Warrenton but which moved to Rocky Mount in 1985, shortly before it closed. WESQ offered a variety of music that included country and R&amp;B. When Wesleyan opted to cut ties with the station in 1995, a group of Rocky Mount business leaders known as Friends of Down East Public Radio bought the station and relaunched it as WRQM on March 31, 1996. The station floundered for most of its existence, as there were just barely enough listeners in that area of the market for the station to be viable on its own. This caused a chronic shortage of financial support. In March 1999, it began airing most of WUNC&#x27;s schedule; it became a full repeater of WUNC that October.

WUND-FM in Columbia signed on March 24, 1999, bringing NPR programming to one of the few areas of North Carolina without a clear signal from a full-fledged NPR station.

WUNW-FM in Welcome signed on as a full-service FM station on 91.1 FM in December 2013, providing increased coverage of WUNC to suburban communities in Davidson County, located south of Greensboro and Winston-Salem.

On May 13, 2015, officials announced the acquisition of WFSS, a public radio station licensed to Fayetteville State University in Fayetteville. Simulcasting of WUNC began at 10:00 AM on May 13, 2015. The sale closed in November.

On August 4, 2016, WUNC launched &quot;WUNC Music&quot;, an adult album alternative format, on their HD2 channel and on their website.

On May 31, 2023, WUNC announced the purchase of WZCO in Chadbourn, the former Columbus County Schools student-run radio station, for $50,000. WUNC programming began on October 6.

==Programming==
Aside from &quot;Back Porch Music&quot;, WUNC also produces &quot;The People&#x27;s Pharmacy&quot; with Joe and Terry Graedon, a nationally syndicated program first broadcast on WUNC in the early 1980s. From 1999 to 2020, it also aired &quot;The State of Things&quot;, a regionally syndicated local affairs show. The network began offering podcasts for &quot;The State of Things&quot; and other locally produced news stories in September 2005.

WUNC&#x27;s main radio studios are located in Chapel Hill near the Friday Center. In 2005, a second broadcast facility was opened in Durham&#x27;s American Tobacco Historic District. On October 17, 2005, &quot;The State of Things&quot; began production at the new Durham location and broadcasts live about once a month remotely from Triad Stage in Greensboro. Other programs continue production in the Chapel Hill studios.

Dick Gordon, former host of WBUR&#x27;s &quot;The Connection&quot;, began hosting a new interview show called &quot;The Story with Dick Gordon&quot; on February 16, 2006, that was co-produced with and nationally syndicated by American Public Media. The show&#x27;s final program aired on WUNC on October 11, 2013. &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; had been dropped by WUNC-FM earlier in the year. Today, in addition to the aforementioned current programs plus NPR staples such as &quot;Morning Edition,&quot; &quot;All Things Considered,&quot; &quot;Fresh Air with Terry Gross&quot; and &quot;Wait Wait... Don&#x27;t Tell Me!,&quot; WUNC-FM also airs &quot;1A&quot;, &quot;The Takeaway,&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s Been A Minute&quot; and &quot;Here and Now&quot;. Many of these shows are distributed nationally by American Public Media, Public Radio Exchange, or WNYC.

WUNC is the home station of the American Homefront Project, which reports on military life and veterans issues.

===HD programming===
WUNC broadcasts in the HD radio format. Since the summer of 2016, WUNC has aired WUNC Music on its HD2 digital subchannel. WUNC Music specializes in adult album alternative (AAA), indie rock, Americana, and music by North Carolina artists.

Effective July 1, 2024, WUNC-HD2 began carrying programming from BBC World Service.

==Transmitters==
In 2005, to reflect its growth into a network, WUNC rebranded as &quot;North Carolina Public Radio - WUNC&quot;. The call signs of the other stations are identified only during required station identifications at the start of each hour. However, in recent years, it has largely reverted to using &quot;WUNC&quot; as its main on-air name, with &quot;North Carolina Public Radio&quot; as a secondary brand.

WUNC&#x27;s 100,000-watt signal broadcasts from the PBS North Carolina tower on Terrells Mountain in Chatham County, five miles west of Chapel Hill. In addition to its home market of the Research Triangle (Raleigh, Durham and Chapel Hill), it also provides a strong city-grade signal to the eastern Piedmont Triad, including Greensboro and High Point. Terrells Mountain is roughly halfway between the Triangle and the Triad, and WUNC has long claimed Greensboro as part of its primary coverage area. WUNC provides much of the eastern Triad region a second choice for NPR programming alongside that market&#x27;s primary NPR station, WFDD in Winston-Salem.

WRQM serves the far eastern portion of the Triangle market, as well as Greenville. WUND serves northeastern North Carolina and the Outer Banks, with WBUX covering southern Dare County. WUNW covers portions of Davidson County that aren&#x27;t served by WUNC&#x27;s main signal. WFSS is heard in the Fayetteville area. WZCO serves the largely rural area between Fayetteville and Wilmington. Combined, the seven stations reach just over half of North Carolina&#x27;s population, providing at least secondary coverage from the fringes of the Charlotte suburbs to the Outer Banks.

<text>Oscar Shumsky (March 23, 1917 in Philadelphia – July 24, 2000 in Rye, New York) was an American violinist and conductor.

==Biography==
Oscar Shumsky was born to Russian-Jewish parents. He started learning the violin at the age of three, and made his concert debut at the age of seven with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Leopold Stokowski, who declared him to be &quot;the most astounding genius I have ever heard&quot;. Fritz Kreisler took a special interest in him, and he played Kreisler&#x27;s own cadenzas to the Beethoven violin concerto to him after learning them by ear. He was a pupil of Leopold Auer from 1925 and studied at the Curtis Institute of Music from 1928 to 1936, continuing his studies with Efrem Zimbalist after Auer&#x27;s death in 1930. His New York debut was in 1934 and his Vienna debut was in 1936. He played first violin in the Primrose Quartet from 1939, and the same year joined the NBC Symphony Orchestra under Arturo Toscanini. During the Second World War, he served in the U.S. Navy.

His violin was a Stradivari of 1715 known as &#x27;Ex-Pierre Rode&#x27; or the &#x27;Duke of Cambridge&#x27; (previously owned by Pierre Rode). It was used by Shumsky to record the complete 24 &quot;Caprices&quot; by Rode. He tells how he came to acquire the instrument:
He taught at the Curtis Institute, Philadelphia, Peabody Conservatory, Baltimore, Yale University, and, from 1953, the Juilliard School in New York. From 1959 to 1967, he co-directed the Stratford Festival (in Ontario) with Glenn Gould, with whom he played regularly at the festival and made some recordings for T.V. broadcast. Around this time, he appeared regularly as a soloist with American orchestras. His conducting debut was in 1959 with the Canadian National Festival Orchestra; he later conducted the Orchestral Workshop of Westchester, the Westchester Symphony Orchestra, and the Empire Sinfonietta in New York, and the New Jersey Colonial Symphony Orchestra. He joined the Bach Aria Group in the early 1960s. He was granted a Ford Foundation Award in 1965.

He returned to concerts and recordings in 1981, performing in the USA and in Britain for the first time in 30 years; a programme he gave for solo violin led to great acclaim:
He recorded Eugène Ysaÿe&#x27;s solo violin sonatas op.27 and Bach&#x27;s sonatas and partitas for solo violin, the Beethoven violin concerto, Bach&#x27;s single and double violin concertos, Mozart&#x27;s 4th and 5th violin concertos, and other works, including the two Brahms Viola Sonatas on the viola. Many of these recordings have not been released on CD.

Many fellow violinists consider him to be one of the great violinists of the century; David Oistrakh called him &quot;one of the world&#x27;s greatest violinists&quot; and the &quot;New Grove&quot; dictionary says of him: &#x27;He was a player of virtuoso technique, pure style and refined taste; yet never sought recognition as a soloist, preferring to concentrate on teaching, chamber music playing and conducting.&#x27;

Shumsky married Louise Sophia Carboni on October 4, 1939. Together they had two sons; Noel (a business executive &amp; teacher) and Eric (a violist &amp; teacher).

A great deal has been written about Shumsky’s musical artistry; however, little is known about his “other interests”. Since his childhood in Philadelphia Shumsky was fascinated with photography. He was an avid amateur photographer who could often be found with a camera. His photographic skills and knowledge were recognized by the great American photographer- Ansel Adams. The two men became friends drawn together by their mutual interests and respect; Shumsky a professional musician and amateur photographer and Adams a professional photographer and amateur musician (pianist).

Shumsky had a curiosity with the world around him. He was drawn to biology and microbiology which led him to the field of photo microscopy. He would often find himself in a situation where he needed a special mounting to marry one optical device to another. He taught himself how to use a metal lathe and other machining tools to build whatever was needed to accomplish the task.

<doc id="859248" wikidata="Q3492867" url="?curid=859248" title="Hair of the dog">
<text>&quot;Hair of the dog&quot;, short for &quot;hair of the dog that bit you&quot;, is a colloquial expression in the English language predominantly used to refer to alcohol that is consumed as a hangover remedy (with the aim of lessening the effects of a hangover). Many other languages have their own phrase to describe the same concept. The idea may have some basis in science in the difference between ethanol and methanol metabolism.

==Etymology==
The expression originally referred to a method of treatment for a rabid dog bite by placing hair from the dog in the bite wound. Ebenezer Cobham Brewer writes in the &quot;Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot; (1898): &quot;In Scotland it is a popular belief that a few hairs of the dog that bit you applied to the wound will prevent evil consequences. Applied to drinks, it means, if overnight you have indulged too freely, take a glass of the same wine within 24 hours to soothe the nerves. &#x27;If this dog do you bite, soon as out of your bed, take a hair of the tail the next day.&#x27;&quot; He also cites two apocryphal poems containing the phrase, one of which is attributed to Aristophanes. It is possible that the phrase was used to justify an existing practice, as the idea of &quot;like cures like&quot; () dates back at least to the time of Hippocrates. The idea was also postulated by Pliny the Elder, who wrote &quot;When a person has been bitten by a mad dog, he may be preserved from hydrophobia by applying the ashes of a dog&#x27;s head to the wound.&quot; Likewise he claimed one could &quot;insert in the wound ashes of hairs from the tail of the dog that inflicted the bite.&quot; This idea exists today as the basic postulate of classical homeopathy.

An early example of modern usage (&quot;poil de ce chien&quot;) can be found in Rabelais&#x27; 16th-century pentalogy &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;, literally translated by Motteux in the late 17th century.

In the 1930s cocktails known as Corpse Revivers were served in hotels.

==In other languages==
=== Europe ===
The phrase also exists in Hungarian, where the literal translation to English is &quot;(You may cure) the dog&#x27;s bite with its fur&quot;, but has evolved into a short phrase (&quot;kutyaharapást szőrével&quot;) that is used frequently in other contexts when one is trying to express that the solution to a problem is more of the problem.

Among the Irish and Mexicans, the phrase &quot;The Cure&quot; (&quot;curarse la cruda&quot; in Spanish) is often used instead of &quot;hair of the dog&quot;. It is used, often sarcastically, in the question &quot;Going for a Cure?&quot;. In Portuguese, people speak of &quot;a rebound&quot; (&quot;uma rebatida&quot;), meaning the recoil of the hangover). 

In some Slavic languages (Polish, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Serbian, Slovenian, and Russian), hair of the dog is called &quot;a wedge&quot; (&quot;klin&quot;), mirroring the concept of dislodging a stuck wedge with another one; hence the popular Polish phrase &quot;[to dislodge] a wedge [with] a wedge&quot; – &quot;[wybijać] klin klinem&quot; – which is used figuratively both with regard to alcohol and in other contexts. In Bulgarian, the phrase is Клин клин избива (using the &quot;wedge&quot; metaphor common in other Slavic languages). The proper Russian term is опохмелка (&quot;opohmelka&quot;, &quot;after being drunk&quot;), which indicates a process of drinking to decrease effects of drinking the day before. In Estonia, the phrase used is &quot;peaparandus&quot;, which literally translated is &quot;head-repair&quot;.

A similar usage is encountered in Romanian, in the phrase &quot;Cui pe cui se scoate&quot; (&quot;A nail (fastener) pulls out a nail&quot;); in Italian, in the phrase &quot;Chiodo scaccia chiodo&quot;; in Spanish, in the phrase &quot;Un clavo saca otro clavo&quot; (&quot;A nail pulls out another nail&quot;). In all three cases, the English translation is &quot;a nail dislodges a nail&quot;, though these phrases are not exclusively used to refer to the hangover cure.

In German, drinking alcohol the next morning to relieve the symptoms is sometimes described as &quot;having a counter-beer&quot; (&quot;ein Konterbier trinken&quot;), and in Japan, drinking alcohol in the morning after drinking too much is called 迎え酒 (&quot;mukae-zake&quot;), which roughly translates as &quot;counter drinking&quot;. In Austria people talk about having a &quot;repair-beer&quot; (&quot;Reparatur-Seidl&quot;).

The Dutch have also coined the portmanteaux &quot;reparadler&quot; and &quot;reparipa&quot;, referring to Radler and IPA as repair beverages. The term &quot;Morning-afterpils&quot; is also used (&quot;pils&quot; being one of the most popular types of beer in the Netherlands).

In Norwegian it is usually called &quot;repareringspils&quot;, meaning a &quot;beer to repair&quot;. In Czech, it is called &quot;vyprošťovák&quot; (&quot;extricator&quot;). In Swedish, drinking alcohol to relieve a hangover is called having an &quot;återställare&quot;, which translates roughly to &quot;restorer&quot;. In Danish, a beer the day after drinking is called a &quot;reparationsbajer&quot;, which translates to &quot;repair beer&quot;. There is also a saying: &quot;One must rise at the tree where one fell&quot;. Similarly, in Dutch, the term &quot;reparatiebier&quot; is frequently used, which also translates to &quot;repair beer&quot;.

In Finnish, consuming alcohol the next day is called &quot;tasoittava&quot; (&quot;smoothener&quot;, &quot;equalizer&quot;), &quot;loiventava&quot; (&quot;leveller&quot;) or &quot;korjaussarja&quot; (&quot;a repair kit&quot;). Also the phrase &quot;Sillä se lähtee millä tulikin&quot; that translates to &quot;What caused it, will also cure it&quot;, describes the same concept.

In French, &quot;soigner le mal par le mal&quot; (&quot;cure evil with evil&quot;) refers to the ancient belief of fitting a disease with the same origins and is said in case of a hangover as you drink again.

In Icelandic, a hangover cure is called &quot;Afréttari&quot;, translating to &quot;a straightener&quot;, which plays upon the idea that if you are feeling hungover, the first drink will &quot;straighten you out&quot; or lift you back up to your normal state.

=== The Americas ===
In Colombia, the same expresion is used: &quot;pelo del mismo perro&quot; (&quot;hair of the same dog&quot;). In Costa Rica (Central America), the dog is replaced with a pig, as in &quot;hair of the same pig&quot; (&quot;pelos de la misma chancha&quot; in Central America). In Puerto Rico, the relevant expression is &quot;matar al ratón&quot;, or &quot;to kill the mouse&quot;.

=== Asia ===
The earliest known reference to the phrase &quot;hair of the dog&quot; in connection with drunkenness is found in a text from ancient Ugarit dating from the mid to late second millennium BC, in which the god ʾIlu becomes hungover after a drinking binge. The text includes a recipe for a salve to be applied to the forehead, which consists of &quot;hairs of a dog&quot; and parts of an unknown plant mixed with olive oil.

In Korea, alcohol (typically soju) drunk in the morning to relieve hangovers is called &quot;haejangsul&quot; (해장술), which literally translates as &quot;a drink that relieves the bowels&quot;. In China, alcohol drunk to relieve a hangover is called &quot;huíhúnjiǔ&quot; (回魂酒), which literally translates as &quot;the drink that brings back your soul&quot;. In Japan, the equivalent phrase is &quot;mukaezake&quot; (迎え酒), which can be literally translated as &quot;alcohol for facing (greeting) the next day.&quot;

=== Africa ===
In Cape Afrikaans, drinking alcohol to cure a hangover (&quot;babbelas&quot;) is called &quot;kopskiet&quot;, or &quot;shot to the head&quot;. In Tanzania, the equivalent Swahili phrase used is &quot;kuzimua&quot;, which means &quot;assist to wake up after a coma&quot;. The phrase also exists in (Sheng) Swahili Slang: in Kenya, taking alcohol to relieve a hangover is called &quot;kutoa lock&quot;, translating to &quot;removing the lock&quot;.

==Scientific background==
There are at least two hypotheses as to how &quot;hair of the dog&quot; works. In the first, hangovers are viewed as the first stage of alcohol withdrawal, which is then alleviated by further alcohol intake. Although &quot;...Low [ethanol] doses may effectively prevent alcohol withdrawal syndrome in surgical patients&quot;, this idea is questionable as the signs and symptoms of hangover and alcohol withdrawal are very different.

In the second, hangovers are partly attributed to methanol metabolism. Levels of methanol, present as a congener in alcohol, have been correlated with severity of hangover and methanol metabolism to the highly toxic formate via formaldehyde coincides with the rate of appearance of hangover symptoms. As both ethanol and methanol are metabolized by alcohol dehydrogenase – and this enzyme has a greater binding affinity for ethanol than for methanol – drinking more of the former effectively prevents (or delays) the metabolism of the latter.

<text>Thymallus, commonly known as graylings, is a genus of freshwater ray-finned fish and the only genus within the subfamily Thymallinae of the family Salmonidae. Although all &quot;Thymallus&quot; species can be generically called graylings, without specific qualification the term &quot;grayling&quot; typically refers to the type species &quot;Thymallus thymallus&quot;, the European grayling.

==Name==
The name of the genus &quot;Thymallus&quot; first given to grayling (&quot;T. thymallus&quot;) described in the 1758 edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; by Swedish zoologist Carl Linnaeus originates from the 
faint smell of the herb thyme, which emanates from the flesh. &quot;Thymallus&quot; derives from the Greek θύμαλλος, &quot;thyme smell&quot;.
== Species ==
According to FishBase, 14 species are placed in this genus. However, views differ on their taxonomic rank.
* &quot;Thymallus arcticus&quot; - Arctic grayling
* &quot;Thymallus baicalensis&quot; - Baikal black grayling
* &quot;Thymallus brevipinnis&quot; - Baikal white grayling
* &quot;Thymallus brevirostris&quot; - Mongolian grayling
* &quot;Thymallus burejensis&quot; - Bureya grayling
* &quot;Thymallus flavomaculatus&quot; - yellow-spotted grayling
* &quot;Thymallus grubii&quot; - Amur grayling
*&quot;Thymallus mertensii&quot; - Kamchatka grayling
* &quot;Thymallus nigrescens&quot; - Kosogol grayling
* &quot;Thymallus pallasii&quot; - East Siberian grayling
* &quot;Thymallus svetovidovi&quot; - Upper Yenisei grayling
* &quot;Thymallus thymallus&quot; - European grayling (type species)
* &quot;Thymallus tugarinae&quot; - Lower Amur grayling 
* &quot;Thymallus yaluensis&quot; - Yalu grayling 

Modern reviews and the &quot;Catalog of Fishes&quot; also list additional species including &quot;[[Thymallus nikolskyi]&quot; , &quot;[[Thymallus baicalolenensis]]&quot; and &quot;[[Thymallus ligericus]]&quot; . An old controversy exists over the status of Baikal black vs white graylings, &quot;T. baicalensis&quot; and &quot;T. brevipinnis&quot;. Modern research supports the view that they are not separate taxa, but alternative ecological forms of &quot;T. baicalensis&quot;.

==Distribution==
The fishes of this genus are native to the northern parts of the [[Palearctic realm|Palearctic]] and [[Nearctic realm]]s, ranging from the [[United Kingdom]] and northern [[Europe]] across [[Eurasia]] to [[Siberia]], as well as northern [[North America]]. &quot;T. thymallus&quot;, the grayling, is widespread in Europe, and &quot;T. arcticus,&quot; the Arctic grayling, is widespread throughout Eurasia east of the [[Ural Mountains]] and in the Nearctic. The other species have more localized ranges in northern Asia.

==Appearance==
&quot;Thymallus&quot; species are distinguished from other members of the [[salmonidae|salmonid family]] by their larger scales, their small mouths with [[teeth]] on the [[maxilla]]ry bone, and most striking of all, their showy, sail-like [[dorsal fin]]s. This fin is longer in males and highly colourful, with spots of red, orange, purple or green. The body is also colourful; the dorsal surface is a dark purplish to bluish black or gray, grading to dark blue or silver gray on the flanks and gray or white on the belly. The body is further decorated with a smattering of small dark spots; these are much more numerous in juveniles.
The longest of the graylings is the Arctic grayling, &quot;T. arcticus&quot;, at a maximum length of and a maximum weight of . &quot;T. thymallus,&quot; while somewhat shorter - - may weigh significantly more, . The fishes of this genus may live for 18 years or more.

==Ecology and reproduction==
These fishes require cool, well-oxygenated water, preferably with a swift current; they are found in large, sandy- or gravel-bottomed rivers and lakes, but &quot;T. thymallus&quot; may occasionally be found in [[brackish]] conditions. Generally [[omnivorous]], they feed primarily on [[crustaceans]], [[insects]], and [[zooplankton]].

The grayling species, typically for [[Salmonidae|salmonids]], spawn in rivers and do not guard their brood, although they do conceal their eggs in silt. The spawning behavior of the Arctic grayling may be typical for the genus &quot;Thymallus&quot;.

As they are highly sensitive to changes in water quality, &quot;Thymallus&quot; fishes may be considered [[indicator species]]; &quot;T. arcticus&quot; has largely disappeared from the [[Great Lakes Basin]].

==Human use==

Due to their agreeable taste and attractive form, the grayling species are valued as food and game fishes, and they are occasionally seen in [[public aquaria]]. The most economically important of these fishes, for which [[fishery|fisheries]] and [[aquaculture]] operations exist, are the grayling (&quot;T. thymallus&quot;) and the Arctic grayling (&quot;T. arcticus&quot;).

<text>Modern English Bible translations consists of English Bible translations developed and published throughout the late modern period () to the present ().

A multitude of recent attempts have been made to translate the Bible into English. Most modern translations published since are based on recently published critical editions of the original Hebrew and Greek texts. These translations typically rely on the &quot;Biblia Hebraica Stuttgartensia&quot; / &quot;Biblia Hebraica Quinta&quot;, counterparted by the &quot;Novum Testamentum Graece&quot; (and the &quot;Greek New Testament&quot;, published by the United Bible Societies, which contains the same text).

With regard to the use of Bible translations among biblical scholarship, the New Revised Standard Version is used broadly, but the English Standard Version is emerging as a primary text of choice among biblical scholars and theologians inclined toward theological conservatism.

== Development of Modern English Bible versions ==
The Wessex Gospels were the first translation of the four Gospels in English without accompanying Latin text. The Authorized King James Version of 1611 was sporadically altered until 1769, but was not thoroughly updated until the creation of the Revised Version in 1885; it was not until the Revised Standard Version of 1952 (New Testament in 1946) that a rival to the KJV was composed, nearly 350 years after the KJV was first published. The RSV gained widespread adoption among the mainstream Protestant Churches in America and a Catholic Edition was released in 1962. It was updated as the New Revised Standard Version in 1989.

In the late twentieth century, Bibles increasingly appeared that were much less literal in their approach to translation. In 1946, the New English Bible was initiated in the United Kingdom, intended to enable readers to better understand the King James Bible. In 1958, J. B. Phillips (1906–1982) produced an edition of the New Testament letters in paraphrase, the &quot;Letters to Young Churches&quot;, so that members of his youth group could understand what the New Testament authors had written. In 1966, &quot;Good News for Modern Man&quot;, a non-literal translation of the New Testament, was released to wide acceptance. Others followed suit. The Living Bible, released in 1971, was published by its author Kenneth N. Taylor, based on the literal American Standard Version of 1901. Taylor had begun because of the trouble his children had in understanding the literal (and sometimes archaic) text of the King James Bible. His work was at first intended for children, but was later positioned for marketing to high school and college students, as well as adults wishing to better understand the Bible. Like Phillips&#x27; version, the Living Bible was a dramatic departure from the King James Version.
Despite widespread criticism due to being a paraphrase rather than a translation, the popularity of The Living Bible created a demand for a new approach to translating the Bible into contemporary English called dynamic equivalence, which attempts to preserve the meaning of the original text in a readable way. Realizing the immense benefits of a Bible that was more easily accessible to the average reader, and responding to the criticisms of the Living Bible, the American Bible Society extended the &quot;Good News for Modern Man&quot; to the Good News Bible (1976) by adding the Old Testament, in this more readable style. This translation has gone on to become one of the best selling in history. In 1996, a new revision of Taylor&#x27;s Living Bible was published. This New Living Translation is a full translation from the original languages rather than a paraphrase of the Bible.

Another project aimed to create something in between the very literal translation of the King James Bible and the more informal Good News Bible. The goal of this was to create a Bible that would be scholarly yet not overly formal. The result of this project was the New International Version (1978). This version became highly popular in Evangelical Protestant circles.

The debate between the formal equivalence and dynamic (or &#x27;functional&#x27;) equivalence translation styles has increased with the introduction of inclusive language versions. Various terms are employed to defend or attack this development, such as &quot;feminist&quot;, &quot;gender neutral&quot;, or &quot;gender accurate&quot;. New editions of some previous translations have been updated to take this change in language into account, including the New Jerusalem Bible (1985), the New Revised Standard Version (1989), the Revised English Bible (1989), and Today&#x27;s New International Version (2005). Some translations have approached the issue more cautiously, such as the English Standard Version (2001).

A further process that has assisted in greatly increasing the number of English Bible versions is the use of the Internet in producing virtual bibles, of which a growing number are beginning to appear in print – especially given the development of &quot;print on demand&quot;.

Today, there is a range of translations ranging from the most literal, such as the &quot;Young&#x27;s Literal Translation&quot; to the most free such as &quot;The Message&quot; and &quot;The Word on the Street&quot;.

== 18th and 19th century translations ==
== 20th and 21st century translations ==
=== King James Version and derivatives ===

The King James Version of 1611 (in editions following the editing of Blayney at Oxford in 1769) still has an immense following, and as such there have been a number of different attempts to update or improve upon it. The English Revised Version and its derivatives also stem from the King James Version.

=== English Revised Version and derivatives ===
The English Revised Version was the first official attempt to update the King James Version of 1769. This was adapted in the United States as the American Standard Version. The translations and versions that stem from them are shown in date order:

=== New International Version and derivatives ===
The popular New International Version has appeared in a number of editions.

=== Dynamic translations and paraphrases ===
A significant aspect in translations from the latter half of the 20th century was much greater use of the principles of dynamic equivalence.

=== Internet-based translations ===
The New English Translation (or NET Bible) is a project to publish a translation of the Bible using the Internet. It is freely available and accompanied by extensive translator&#x27;s notes. The Open English Bible aims to create the first modern public domain English translation of the Bible, using an open-source process for corrections and modernizing verses.
 

=== Messianic translations ===

Some Bible translations find popular use in, or were prepared especially for, the Messianic Judaism movement.

=== New English Bible and derivatives ===

The initiative to create the New English Bible began in 1946, in an attempt to make an entirely new translation of the Bible in contemporary English.

=== Public domain translations ===
=== Catholic translations ===
In addition to the above Catholic English Bibles, all of which have an imprimatur granted by a Catholic bishop, the authors of the Catholic Public Domain Version of 2009 and the 2013 translation from the Septuagint by Jesuit priest Nicholas King refer to them as Catholic Bibles. These versions have not been granted an imprimatur, but do include the Catholic biblical canon of 73 books.

=== Sacred Name translations ===
These Sacred Name Bibles were all done with the specific aim of carrying into English the actual Name of God as they were in the originals. Most have been done by people from the Sacred Name Movement. They are distinguished by their policy of transliterating Hebrew-based forms for sacred names, such as &quot;Yahweh&quot;, &quot;YHWH&quot;, etc.

=== Masoretic Text / Jewish translations ===

Jewish translations follow the Masoretic Text, and are usually published in bilingual editions with the Hebrew text facing the English translation. The translations often reflect traditional Jewish exegesis of the Bible. As translations of the Masoretic Text, Jewish translations contain neither the apocrypha nor the Christian New Testament.

=== Septuagint translations ===
=== Simplified English Bibles ===
There have been a number of attempts to produce a Bible that greatly simplifies the English. (Some of these versions are also listed in other categories: for example, the NIrV is also found under the NIV section). These are translations that are not necessarily a very dynamic translation, but go beyond simply everyday English into a restricted vocabulary set, often aimed at non-native speakers of English.

=== Translations exclusively published by Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses ===
=== Translations exclusively published by the Latter Day Saints movement ===

=== Adaptive retellings ===
Some versions have been labelled &quot;adaptive retelling&quot; as they take many liberties with the form of the text.

=== Other translations ===
== Partial translations ==
=== New Testament ===

=== Hebrew Bible ===

<text>Anne-Sophie Mutter (born 29 June 1963) is a German violinist. Born and raised in Rheinfelden, Baden-Württemberg, Mutter started playing the violin at age five and continued studies in Germany and Switzerland. She was supported early in her career by Herbert von Karajan and made her orchestral debut with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1977. Since Mutter gained prominence in the 1970s and 1980s, she has recorded over 50 albums, mostly with the Deutsche Grammophon label, and performed as a soloist with leading orchestras worldwide and as a recitalist. Her primary instrument is the Lord Dunn–Raven Stradivarius violin. 

Mutter&#x27;s repertoire includes traditional classical violin works from the Baroque period to the 20th century, but she also is known for performing, recording, and commissioning new works by present-day composers. As an advocate of contemporary music, she has had several works composed especially for her, by Thomas Adès, Unsuk Chin, Sebastian Currier, Henri Dutilleux, Sofia Gubaidulina, Witold Lutosławski, Norbert Moret, Krzysztof Penderecki, André Previn, Wolfgang Rihm, Jörg Widmann, and John Williams. 

Mutter has received numerous awards and prizes, including four Grammy Awards (1994, 1999, 2000, and 2005), Echo Klassik awards (2009, 2014), the Grand Decoration of Honour of Austria (2007), the Grand Cross Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany (2009), France&#x27;s Legion of Honour (2009), Spain&#x27;s Gold Medal of Merit in the Fine Arts (2016), Romania&#x27;s Grand Cross National Order of Merit (2017), Poland&#x27;s Gold Medal for Merit to Culture – Gloria Artis (2018), Japan&#x27;s Praemium Imperiale (2019), the Polar Music Prize (2019), and holds honorary memberships at the Royal Academy of Music (1986) and American Academy of Arts and Sciences (2013). 

Mutter founded the Association of Friends of the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation e.V. in 1997 and the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation in 2008, which support young string musicians. She frequently gives benefits concerts and, since 2021, has been the president of the German Cancer Aid. 

== Early life ==
Mutter was born in the German town of Rheinfelden, Baden-Württemberg. Her parents were Karl Wilhelm Mutter and Gerlinde Mutter and she was raised with two older brothers. While Mutter&#x27;s father was a journalist who edited a newspaper in Baden-Württemberg, her mother was the first woman in her family to graduate from college. Although no one in the home played a musical instrument, all were passionate about classical music.

Mutter began piano lessons at age five but after a few months switched to the violin after listening to an album of the Mendelssohn and Beethoven violin concertos that her parents had given to each other as an engagement present. At age six, after only one year of study, Mutter won the National Music Prize, and in 1972 she gave her first concert, with the then 343-year-old Musikkollegium Winterthur. 

Inspired by another recording, of violinist Yehudi Menuhin with Wilhelm Furtwängler, she then began studying with Erna Honigberger, a pupil of Carl Flesch; and when Honigberger died, in 1974, she continued with Aida Stucki, also a former student of Flesch, at the Winterthur Conservatory.

== Career ==
===1970s–1980s===

Mutter&#x27;s playing began to receive attention and she stopped attending school to devote herself full-time to music. Conductor Herbert von Karajan arranged for her to play with the Berlin Philharmonic. Only 13 years old at the time, she made her public debut on stage in 1976 at the Lucerne Festival, where she played Mozart&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 4 in D major. In 1977, she performed at the Salzburg Whitsun Festival and with the English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Daniel Barenboim. Critics praised the level of maturity in Mutter&#x27;s performance, with one reviewer of &quot;Die Welt&quot; writing, &quot;&quot;She played it ravishingly, and above all, she did not play it at all like a child prodigy. Her technique is fully mature.&quot;
At 15, Mutter made her first recording of the Mozart Third and Fifth violin concerti with Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic.

Mutter started to perform outside Europe in the early 1980s. In 1980, Mutter made her American debut with the New York Philharmonic playing Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto under Zubin Mehta. That same year she also made her debut with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra performing Beethoven&#x27;s Romance in G major and Mozart&#x27;s Third Violin Concerto under Georg Solti, and her debut with the National Symphony Orchestra playing Mozart&#x27;s Third Violin Concerto under Mstislav Rostropovich. The following year Mutter made her debut at Carnegie Hall playing Mozart&#x27;s Fifth Violin Concerto with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Riccardo Muti, and made her debut with the Boston Symphony Orchestra performing Bruch&#x27;s Violin Concerto under Seiji Ozawa in 1983. Mutter&#x27;s Japanese debut was in Tokyo (1981) with the Berlin Philharmonic under Karajan, followed by her Russian debut in Moscow (1985).

After three years of her debut with the London Symphony Orchestra in 1980, in which she played Mendelssohn&#x27;s Violin Concerto under Claudio Abbado, Mutter was named the honorary President of Oxford University&#x27;s Mozart Society. 
In 1985, at the age of 22, she was made an honorary fellow of the Royal Academy of Music (London) and head of its faculty of international violin studies and in 1986 an honorary member. 

Beginning in the late 1980s, Mutter expanded her repertoire and devoted herself more to contemporary works, a focus that would become a significant component of her career. In 1986, Mutter premiered Witold Lutosławski&#x27;s Chain 2, Dialogue for Violin and Orchestra, with the Zurich Collegium Musicum. Norbert Moret composed his Violin Concert En rêve for Mutter in 1988. 

In 1988, she also made a grand tour of Canada and the United States, performing as a soloist with orchestras and giving solo recitals with pianist Lambert Orkis. Mutter made her recital debuts in New York (at Carnegie Hall), Washington, D.C., Los Angeles, San Francisco, Montreal, Toronto, and other cities and debuted with the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra. Mutter premiered music by Krzysztof Penderecki and André Previn and performed classic works such as Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto and violin sonatas by Beethoven, Brahms, Franck, and Tartini.

===1990s===
By the 1990s, Mutter had established herself as an international star, transitioning from &quot;Wunderkind&quot; to mature artist The press described her as a &quot;master of the violin&quot; and &quot;musician of near peerless virtuosity and unimpeachable integrity,&quot; with critics noting her glamorous image. One author of &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; wrote in regards to Mutter&#x27;s rise to fame: &quot;In the meantime, the entire classical music world knows these tones and this musical master: Anne-Sophie Mutter, now 25, is probably the only world star made in Germany in today&#x27;s instrumentalist trade and the first violinist from [Germany] who can keep up with the world&#x27;s violin standard. After Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau&#x27;s flight of fancy, no other serious musician from Germany – gender notwithstanding – has succeeded in rising more quickly from the first floor to the penthouse of the international guild of interpreters. In her line of work she is at the top: Frau Fiddler on the roof.&quot;

In the 1990s, Mutter premiered Wolfgang Rihm&#x27;s Gesungene Zeit (1992), Sebastian Currier&#x27;s Aftersong (1994) and Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s Violin Concert No. 2 &quot;Metamorphosen&quot; (1995). That same decade, Mutter released some of her best-selling albums, including Carmen Fantasie with James Levine and the Vienna Philharmonic (1993) and Vivaldi&#x27;s Four Seasons with Karajan and the Vienna Philharmonic (recorded in 1984, published in 1994) and another Vivaldi&#x27;s Four Seasons album with the Trondheim Soloists (1999). 

In 1998 she played and recorded for CD and DVD the complete set of Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Sonatas (released 1999), accompanied by Lambert Orkis; these were broadcast on television in many countries. Mutter devoted an entire year to performing all ten of Beethoven&#x27;s violin sonatas in the &quot;Beethoven: Face to Face&quot; tour in cities throughout North America and Europe, including additional modern pieces. Music critic Anthony Tommasini of the &quot;New York Times&quot; wrote on a concert of the Beethoven tour, &quot;Ms. Mutter&#x27;s playing had its trademark qualities: rich yet focused tone, striking varieties of sound, articulate yet supple rhythmic play. But her increasing work in recent years with living composers has brought a new kind of intellectual energy to her playing, for she was particularly attentive to the bold turns in this youthful music.&quot;

===2000s===
With the turn of the century, Mutter continued supporting new music and began collaborating with composer and conductor André Previn, who dedicated several works to Mutter. Mutter premiered a Tango Song and Dance in 2002, which Previn composed for her. Mutter also gave the first permanence and recording of Previn&#x27;s Violin Concerto with the Boston Symphony Orchestra the same year, of which the recording became a critical success. Mutter toured with orchestras under the direction of Previn, performing his concerto and later premiering Previn&#x27;s double concerto for violin and contrabass in 2007 with Roman Patkoló. Two years later, she premiered his Second Piano Trio with Lynn Harrell and Previn and Concerto for Violin and Viola with Yuri Bashmet. 

Other contemporary works dedicated to Mutter that she premiered included Henri Dutilleux&#x27;s Nocturne for violin and orchestra &quot;Sur le même accord&quot; (2002) under Kurt Masur conducting the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Sofia Gubaidulina&#x27;s violin concerto (2007) under Sir Simon Rattle with the Berlin Philharmonic. 

For Mozart&#x27;s 250th Anniversary from 2005 to 2006, Mutter toured throughout Europe, North America, and Asia, including China, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, performing Mozart&#x27;s complete Violin Concertos, the Sinfonia Concertante for Violin, Viola and Orchestra and complete Piano Trios. Mutter performed with Lambert Orkis and André Previn as pianists. Five DVD and CD recordings containing the works performed on tour and the complete Violin sonatas of Mozart were released.

In October 2006, on French television, Mutter appeared to indicate that she would be retiring when she turned 45, in 2008. However the following month she said that her words were &quot;misinterpreted&quot; and that she would continue to play as long as she felt she could &quot;bring anything new, anything important, anything different to music&quot;.

===2010s-present===

Mutter performed classical and contemporary works during the 2010s, touring Europe, North America, Asia, South America, and Australia. For her yearly tours and performances, she continued her collaborations with Lambert Orkis and performed the major concertos of the classical repertoire. She premiered Wolfgang Rihm&#x27;s &quot;Lichtes Spiel&quot; with the New York Philharmonic and &quot;Dyade&quot; with double bass player Roman Patkoló in 2010 and Sebastian Currier&#x27;s &quot;Time Machines&quot; with the New York Philharmonic conducted by Alan Gilbert in 2011 to critical acclaim. 

In 2011, Mutter established the Mutter Virtuosi, composed of select students and graduates of the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation (established 2008) that perform with Mutter. The chamber ensemble has toured multiple times throughout different continents in the 2010s, performing modern works and classics such as Vivaldi&#x27;s Four Seasons. As part of Deutsche Grammophon&#x27;s series to introduce classical music to broader audiences, Mutter and the Mutter Virtuosi performed works by Bach, Vivaldi, Gershwin and John Williams in a night club at Berlin&#x27;s venue Neue Heimat in 2015. The performance was recorded for The Club Album – Live from the Yellow Lounge.

Mutter gave the world premiere of Previn&#x27;s &quot;Violin Concerto no. 2 for Violin and String Orchestra with the Trondheim Soloists in 2012, the premier of Sebastian Currier&#x27;s &quot;Ringtone Variations&quot; for violin and double bass in 2013, and the premiere of John Williams&#x27; Markings for solo violin, strings and harp with the Boston Symphony Orchestra under Andris Nelsons in 2017. In 2018, Mutter premiered Previn&#x27;s The Fifth Season, Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s Sonata for Violin and Piano No. 2, and his &quot;Duo concertante per violino e contrabbasso&quot;. 

In 2018, Mutter gave a concert with pianist Lang Lang titled the Berlin Concert with the Staatskapelle Berlin under Manfred Honeck for the 120 Anniversary of Deutsche Grammophon. For the anniversary, Mutter also gave concerts in Seoul, South Korea, and Tokyo, Japan. The following year, Mutter performed for the 20th anniversary of the Oxford Philharmonic Orchestra with Maxim Vengerov and Martha Argerich.

In 2019, Mutter joined John Williams to perform William&#x27;s works for solo violin and orchestra, titled &quot;Across The Stars&quot;. The tour and album contained works from William&#x27;s film scores, with such notable pieces as the Star Wars themes, Rey and Yoda, and Hedwig&#x27;s Theme from Harry Potter. The same year, Mutter toured Europe with the West–Eastern Divan Orchestra, playing Beethoven&#x27;s Triple Concerto with Daniel Barenboim and Yo-Yo Ma. The tour included stops in Buenos Aires and Berlin, and resulted in the release of a CD by Deutsche Grammophon. In March 2019, Mutter premiered Sebastian Currier&#x27;s Ghost Trio with Daniel Müller-Schott and Lambert Orkis at Carnegie Hall.

In September 2019, Mutter stopped during a performance of Beethoven&#x27;s Violin Concerto with the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra to ask a cellphone user to stop recording. The incident received significant press coverage and refueled debates about concert cellphone etiquette. 

Mutter has recently premiered several pieces that have been dedicated to her, including Jörg Widmann&#x27;s string quartet &quot;Studie über Beethoven&quot; in Tokyo (2020), John Williams&#x27; Concerto for Violin and Orchestra No. 2 in Tanglewood with the Boston Symphony Orchestra (2021), Unsuk Chin&#x27;s violin duet &quot;Gran Cadenza&quot; (2021) in Regensburg with violinist Ye-Eun Choi and Thomas Adès&#x27; work for violin and orchestra &quot;Air – Homage to Sibelius&quot; (2022) at the Lucerne Festival with the Lucerne Festival Contemporary Orchestra. Mutter&#x27;s 2023 Virtuosi tour has also included works by Joseph Bologne in an effort to revive the composer&#x27;s legacy.

== Repertoire ==
Mutter&#x27;s works include traditional classic pieces that are part of the violin repertoire. Mutter has performed and made recordings of the major violin concertos by Bach, Bartók, Berg, Brahms, Bruch, Beethoven, Dvořák, Mendelssohn, Mozart, Sibelius, Tchaikovsky, and Vivaldi. Her repertoire includes performances and recordings of the double and triple concertos by Brahms and Beethoven, violin romances by Beethoven, Bruch, and Dvořák, and popular orchestral works by Massenet, Sarasate, and Saint Saëns, and standard solo works by Bach and Paganini. Part of her repertoire encompasses chamber works such as the complete violin sonatas by Beethoven, Brahms, and Mozart, other sonatas by Bartók, Franck, Mendelssohn, Prokofiev and Tartini, trios by Beethoven and Mozart, and string quartets by Mozart, Beethoven and Haydn, and Schubert&#x27;s Trout Quintet and Fantasy in C Major.

Though her repertoire includes many classical works, Mutter is particularly known for her performances of contemporary music. Several pieces have been specially written for or dedicated to her, including Henri Dutilleux&#x27;s &quot;Sur le même accord&quot;, Krzysztof Penderecki&#x27;s Second Violin Concerto, Witold Lutosławski&#x27;s &quot;Chain 2&quot; and the orchestral version of &quot;Partita&quot;, and Wolfgang Rihm&#x27;s &quot;Gesungene Zeit&quot; (&quot;Time Chant&quot;), &quot;Lichtes Spiel&quot;, and &quot;Dyade&quot; and Sofia Gubaidulina&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 2 &quot;In tempus praesens,&quot; among others. Mutter premiered André Previn&#x27;s Violin Concerto &quot;Anne-Sophie&quot;, whose recording received a Grammy Award. Mutter&#x27;s recordings of Penderecki&#x27;s Violin Concerto No. 2, &quot;Metamorphosen&quot;, and Rihm&#x27;s &quot;Time Chant&quot; also received Grammy Awards. 

World renowned film score composer and five times Academy Awards winner John Williams composed original music for her, including a pièce for violin, strings and harp called &quot;Markings&quot; (2017), a collection of arrangements of movie themes composed by him for violin and orchestra (recorded by Mutter and Williams with the Recording Arts Orchestra of Los Angeles in &quot;Across the Stars&quot;, 2019) and Williams&#x27; second violin concerto (composed 2021, to be recorded by Mutter with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the author as conductor, in 2022). Mutter also appeared as soloist in John Williams&#x27; debut concert with the Wiener Philharmoniker on 28 and 29 January 2020, recorded by Deutsche Grammophon and released in the live album &quot;John Williams in Vienna&quot;, which became the best-selling album of orchestral music in 2020.

== Playing style and appearance ==
Anne-Sophie Mutter is known for her versatile technique, dynamic range of style, richness of tone and articulate, colorful sound. Critics have noted Mutter&#x27;s personal and thorough interpretation of the music and dedication to the musical works she plays, as she often studies the letters, original scores, and other historical documents by the composer to guide her interpretation. Mutter often divides critics: some praise the sublimity, gracefulness, dexterity, intellectual energy, and sophistication of her music, while others view her playing overly refined, idiosyncratic and caught up in minute details and maintain that Mutter over-interprets works and imposes herself on the music. 

Mutter is known for performing in strapless gowns. Mutter explained that she felt having fabric on her shoulder made it too slippery to hold her violin firmly while she was playing.

== Instruments ==
She owns two Stradivarius violins: the Emiliani of 1703, and the Lord Dunn-Raven Stradivarius of 1710, of which Mutter primarily performs on the latter. Mutter acquired the Emilinia from John &amp; Arthur Beare in London in 1979 and the Lord Dunn-Raven from Bein &amp; Fushi in Chicago in 1984. She also owns a Finnigan-Klaembt dated 1999 and a Regazzi dated 2005.

Mutter has described her Stradivarius violin as her soul mate, saying &quot;It sounded the way I (had) always been hoping. It&#x27;s the oldest part of my body and my soul. The moment I am on stage, we are one, musically.&quot; Mutter ascribes the personal fit of her Stradivarius violin to the &quot;depths of the colors and the incredible amount of dynamic range.&quot; She prefers the Lord Dunn-Raven, stating that the Emilia lacks &quot;a dimension: It has no edginess. I miss the unbridled power. I need this roughness for the eruptive moments of the Beethoven sonatas. You need it for Brahms, Sibelius and contemporary works.&quot;

==Public engagement==

Throughout her career, Mutter has held many benefit concerts for various organizations such as Save the Children Japan, Save the Children Yemen, Artists against Aids, the Swiss Multiple Sclerosis Society, the Hanna and Paul Gräb Foundation&#x27;s Haus der Diakonie in Wehr-Öflingen, the Bruno Bloch Foundation, Beethoven Fund for Deaf Children, SOS Children&#x27;s Villages in Syria and others. In 2018, Mutter gave a benefit concert commemorating a liberation concert in May 1945 for Holocaust survivors by Jewish musicians at the St. Ottilien Archabbey. In 2022, the New York Philharmonic and Mutter performed Jewish music, including Previn&#x27;s violin concerto at Peenemünde, a former Nazi army research center site. Since March 2022, Mutter has been giving benefit concerts for Ukrainians in light of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Mutter founded the Association of Friends of the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation e.V. in 1997 and further established the Anne-Sophie Mutter Foundation in 2008, which supports young stringed instrument players and provides scholarships for talented individuals. Mutter initiated the foundation based on her belief that &quot;Music should grip people, move people; it should tell stories; it should have an impact.&quot; Since 2011, the ensemble group Mutter&#x27;s Virtuosi performs with Mutter and includes students supported by the foundation that also commissions new works for its students. Notable former scholarship holders and Mutter&#x27;s Virtuosi members include violinists Timothy Chooi, Fanny Clamagirand, Vilde Frang, Sergey Khachatryan, Arabella Steinbacher, Noa Wildschut, and Nancy Zhou and cellists Pablo Ferrández, Maximilian Hornung, Linus Roth, Daniel Müller-Schott, and Kian Soltani, among others.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Mutter voiced her concerns about the impact of lockdowns on musicians, particularly classical musicians, and called for the German government to provide financial support. 

In 2021, Anne-Sophie Mutter was elected president of the German Cancer Aid.

== Personal life ==
In 1989, Mutter married her first husband, Detlef Wunderlich, with whom she had two children, Arabella and Richard. Wunderlich died of cancer in 1995. She dedicated her 1999 recording, &quot;Vivaldi: The Four Seasons&quot;, to his memory. She married the pianist, composer, and conductor André Previn in 2002. The couple divorced in 2006, but continued to collaborate musically and maintained their friendship. She lives in Munich.

<text>Quick Restaurants is an originally Belgian chain of hamburger fast food restaurants currently based in Bobigny, Seine-Saint-Denis, France. Quick was founded in 1971 by Belgian entrepreneur Baron François Vaxelaire and operates around 400 restaurants.

Quick is similar in theme to McDonald&#x27;s or Burger King. In 2007, it was taken over by the French government&#x27;s investment holding company, CDC, and was purchased by Burger King in February 2016.
In September 2016, QSR Belgium bought back restaurants of Belgium and Luxembourg to Bertrand Group.

==History==
The chain was first established in 1971 by retail entrepreneur Baron Vaxelaire (Chairman of the GB/GIB Group) with two restaurants, one in Schoten, just outside Antwerp and another one in Waterloo, south of Brussels. The first Quick in France was opened in Aix-en-Provence on July 19, 1980. By December 31, 2010, it operated over 400 restaurants in Belgium, France, Luxembourg and the French overseas departments or territories of Réunion, New Caledonia, Guadeloupe and Martinique. 72% of these restaurants are operated as franchises.

Quick used to have a UK and Dutch presence in the 1980s and 90s, including a branch in London&#x27;s Leicester Square and in Rotterdam, but these are long since closed. From around 2007-08 Quick also had restaurants in Morocco and Algiers, Algeria, as well as Moscow and Tula in Russia, but these have also closed. Currently there are outlets in Morocco, two outlets in Tunis, Tunisia.

In September 2016, QSR Belgium bought back restaurants of Belgium and Luxembourg to Bertrand Group.

In February 2010, Quick announced that eight of its French franchises would offer halal menus to cater to the Muslim population, a number that increased to 22 in August 2010, and only halal menus are being served since then. The move caused controversy from politicians across various parties, including Roubaix&#x27;s mayor, Marine Le Pen of the National Front, and the UMP, France&#x27;s ruling political party.

In 2011, Quick unveiled &quot;Le Double Mix&quot;, a two-in-one sandwich featuring a bread-bun done two different ways on each half, with each side having its own dressings. Available in hamburger or chicken varieties, &quot;Le Double Mix&quot; was sold as a limited-run sandwich, through April 18, 2011.

==Death of Benjamin Orset==
On January 22, 2011, 14-year-old Benjamin Orset died after eating two hamburgers at a Quick restaurant in Avignon, France. An autopsy report concluded that he died from food poisoning. Traces of staphylococci were detected in the boy&#x27;s body, as well as in five of the eight employees. Quick&#x27;s managing director, Jacques-Edouard Charret, refused to accept responsibility for the death of the boy. However, the investigation found that the death of Orset was a direct result of the meal he had eaten at Quick the day before. Admitting the possibility of a &quot;local failure&quot; rather than any problems with the products supplied centrally, Quick took control of the Avignon restaurant back from the franchisee. Quick also promised to &quot;strengthen its controls and hygiene measures, which are already stricter than the legal standards&quot;.

== Morocco ==
In 2003, Quick opened their first restaurant in Casablanca by the biggest movie theater in the country, Megarama.
In 2016, the Ténor group became franchiseholder for Quick in Morocco. They opened in Agdal, Rabat another restaurant. Later in 2016, two new restaurants opened, one in Maârif, Casablanca, and the other in Gueliz, Marrakech. From 2017 restaurants with drive through access were opened, the first in Targa, Marrakech, followed by a second one in El Jadida in 2018 and a third one in August 2019 in Dar Bouaaza. Also in 2019 a Quick restaurant opened on the top floor of the Ryad Square shopping mall in Rabat, Hay Riad. In 2022 the first restaurant in Rabat moved to the food court of the Arribat Shopping Mall.

<text>Vortec is a trademarked name for a line of gasoline engines for General Motors trucks. The name first appeared in an advertisement for the 1985 model year 4.3 L V6 that used &quot;vortex technology&quot; to create a vortex inside the combustion chamber, creating a better air / fuel atomization. It has since been used on a wide range of engines. Modern Vortec engines are named for their approximate displacement in cubic centimeters.

<doc id="859266" wikidata="Q11221971" url="?curid=859266" title="GuitarFreaks and DrumMania">
<text>is a music video game series produced by Konami. The series consists of two games, &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; and &quot;DrumMania&quot;, where players use game controllers modeled after musical instruments to perform the lead guitar, bass guitar and drums of numerous songs across a wide range of genres by matching scrolling musical notes patterns shown on screen. Players are scored for successfully-hit notes, but may fail a song if they miss too many notes. The series has featured numerous game modes, and supports both single-player and multiplayer modes where up to three players can perform together. Some earlier versions of the game could also be linked with &quot;Keyboardmania&quot;.

 is a music video game series produced by Konami. It is a rhythm game where the player uses a controller to simulate the playing of an electric guitar. The game consists of music predominantly from the rock music, rock and roll and J-pop genres. It is considered one of the most influential video games of all time, for having laid the foundations for popular guitar-based rhythm games, such as the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series. Working Designs attempted to bring &quot;Guitar Freaks&quot; PlayStation 2 games in the U.S., but patent problems with the guitar controller prevented the project from moving forward.

 is a drumming music video game series produced by Bemani, the musical division of Konami Digital Entertainment, Inc. It first released in 1999 as an arcade game, then subsequently ported to the Sony PlayStation 2 in Japan in 2000 as a launch title. Subsequent mixes have been released approximately once a year. In 2010, a series XG was introduced, adding a floor tom, left cymbal and a left pedal to the cabinet setup.

==History==
===System 573 era (1999–2004)===
&quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; was released on February 16, 1999. It included a dozen of songs and uses the Bemani System 573 analog hardware, so called because it uses the analog audio output from a CD drive. &quot;DrumMania&quot; was released on July 10, 1999, along with &quot;GuitarFreaks 2ndMix&quot;. These versions included 26 and 33 songs, respectively, and could be linked together to play 14 common songs. Subsequent versions used digital hardware and featured larger song lists, eventually surpassing 120 songs. The &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; version number continued having an increment of one compared to the equivalent &quot;DrumMania&quot; version until &quot;GuitarFreaks 11thMix&quot; and &quot;DrumMania 10thMix&quot; on April 22, 2004. &quot;GuitarFreaks 2ndMix&quot; was the last System 573 analog game, and &quot;DrumMania&quot; was the first System 573 digital game. 

Although the series saw 11 main arcade releases for the System 573, only the first four received home ports. Two of these are &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; games for the original PlayStation console:
* &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; was released on July 29, 1999. It features a total of 18 songs: 12 from its arcade counterpart, 3 previews from &quot;2ndMix&quot; and 3 unique songs. It features Key Disc technology to allow play of &quot;GuitarFreaks Append 2ndMix&quot;.
* &quot;GuitarFreaks Append 2ndMix&quot; was released on February 24, 2000. It features a total of 45 songs: 17 from its predecessor (J-STAFF is omitted), 17 from its arcade counterpart and 11 original songs. As an Append Disc, &quot;2ndMix&quot; functions like an expansion pack, requiring the first &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; to be loaded as a Key Disc before play.

&quot;DrumMania&quot; home ports are exclusive to the PlayStation 2. The first is simply &quot;DrumMania&quot;, the drum counterpart to &quot;GuitarFreaks 2ndMix&quot;. The game&#x27;s two immediate sequels were also released as &quot;GuitarFreaks &amp; DrumMania&quot;:
* &quot;DrumMania&quot; was released on March 4, 2000, as a launch title for the PlayStation 2.
* &quot;GuitarFreaks 3rdMix &amp; DrumMania 2ndMix&quot; was released on September 13, 2000.
* &quot;GuitarFreaks 4thMix &amp; DrumMania 3rdMix&quot; was released on September 20, 2001.

No home ports were released for the seven other System 573 sequels. Instead, songs from these arcade games are included in future titles for the PlayStation 2: the &quot;Masterpiece&quot; series, with a total of 150 songs split between two releases, and home ports of the &quot;V&quot; series, with 46 revivals split between three releases and unavailable in &quot;Masterpiece&quot;.

===&quot;V1&quot; to &quot;V3&quot; (2005–2007)===

In 2005, the &quot;GuitarFreaks &amp; DrumMania&quot; series was upgraded to Bemani Python 2 hardware, which is powered by the PlayStation 2, the same hardware that later became used in the &quot;Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova&quot; series. This eased the development of home ports, which saw a reduced song list, but functioned nearly identically to their arcade counterparts. Three versions of the guitar and drum games utilized this platform:
* &quot;GuitarFreaks &amp; DrumMania V&quot; was released on February 23, 2005, for arcades and March 16, 2006, for the PlayStation 2. The arcade version features 271 songs: 118 new additions, 125 from the previous version (« super &quot;shomin&quot; car » was removed) and 28 from older versions. The home version of &quot;V&quot; is limited to 68 songs, of which 49 are from the arcade version (&quot;Misirlou&quot; is missing), 16 are revivals from GF5/DM4 to GF11/DM10 (excluding GF6/DM5) and three are &quot;V2&quot; previews.
* &quot;GuitarFreaks &amp; DrumMania V2&quot; was released on November 24, 2005, for arcades and November 22, 2006 for the PlayStation 2. The arcade version features 363 songs: 93 new additions, 270 from &quot;V&quot; (&quot;Mountain à Go-Go&quot; was removed) and 25 from older versions. The home version of &quot;V2&quot; is limited to 67 songs, of which 44 are from the arcade version, 18 are revivals (seven of these revivals are also in &quot;V&quot;), three are &quot;V3&quot; previews and another two are unique songs later featured in &quot;V4&quot;.
* &quot;GuitarFreaks &amp; DrumMania V3&quot; was released on September 13, 2006, for arcades and October 4, 2007 for the PlayStation 2. The arcade version features 417 songs: 46 new additions, 357 from &quot;V2&quot; (six songs were removed) and 14 from older versions. The home version of &quot;V3&quot; is limited to 80 songs, of which 46 are from the arcade version, 21 are revivals, 12 are console originals (including &quot;You ~Meaning All Orbit~&quot;, later featured in &quot;V6&quot;, plus three &quot;V5&quot; previews and six &quot;V4&quot; previews) and one (&quot;Misirlou&quot;) is from &quot;V&quot;.

Two other home versions of &quot;GuitarFreaks &amp; DrumMania&quot; were released: &quot;Masterpiece Silver&quot; on August 31, 2006 and &quot;Masterpiece Gold&quot; on March 8, 2007. Each features 74 and 76 songs, respectively, from older releases that lacked a home port.

===&quot;V4&quot; to &quot;V6&quot; (2007–2009)===

&quot;GuitarFreaks &amp; DrumMania V4&quot; was released on August 8, 2007, in Japan and received a location test on September 30, 2007, in the United States. This instalment is the first in the series to forego PlayStation-based hardware, replacing it with a Bemani PC running Windows XP Embedded. This is in contrast to &quot;Dance Dance Revolution SuperNova 2&quot;, which was released on August 22, 2007, in Japan and continued to use the PlayStation 2-based Python 2.

&quot;V4&quot; is also the first international release in the series, the second location test of &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; in the US, and the first location test of &quot;DrumMania&quot; in the US. The test was short-lived in the United States, concluding in just over a month.

===&quot;XG&quot; to &quot;XG3&quot; and &quot;V7&quot; to &quot;V8&quot; (2010–2012)===

The &quot;XG&quot; series features guitar and drum controllers with extra frets and pads, respectively. &quot;V7&quot; and &quot;V8&quot; were released concurrently with &quot;XG&quot; and &quot;XG2&quot;, respectively.

===&quot;GITADORA to GITADORA GALAXY WAVE&quot; (2013–present)===
GITADORA became a continuation to the XG Series of GuitarFreaks and DrumMania. The first release of GITADORA series was February 14, 2013, with lots of modification in the game-play. The &quot;Matixx&quot; Sereies of GITADORA had a lot of improvements (like for example, Phrase Combo has been added to the Song Progress), similar to the following GITADORA series. By December 16, 2020, Konami announced that they have already a PC version of the Game called &quot;コナステ GITADORA&quot; (Konasute GITADORA) with a Monthly Fee of 1480 yen to play the game. From February 1, 2021, to February 28, 2022, Konami made a promo for players that they will have a free month of playing the PC version of GITADORA by purchasing a Yamaha DTX 402KS or 452KS drumset and then introducing the serial code included with them. GITADORA GALAXY WAVE is the latest arcade release.

==Controller==
&quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; is played using a controller designed to imitate the shape of an electric guitar, most like the Fender Jazzmaster or Fender Mustang. The neck houses three buttons, colored red, green, and blue. During XG series up to recent GITADORA, two buttons were added such as yellow and pink. On the main face of the guitar, a pick lever is used to simulate the picking and strumming of an actual guitar. A small metal knob near the pick is used to alter the sound produced by the game, such as adding Chorus/Delay effects.

==Gameplay==

The interface is similar to other games in the Bemani series. Two &quot;note scrolls&quot;—one for each player—are displayed at the left and right sides of the screen. Colorful animations for each song are displayed in the center of the screen. Each note scroll consists of four columns: one each for the red, green, and blue buttons, and a fourth column, known as the Wailing Bonus column. Individual notes and chords are represented by small colored bars that scroll upward in the columns. To play the correct note, the player must hold down the buttons corresponding to the colored bars, and move the fret lever when the bars reach the yellow fretting line. When a guitar icon is displayed in the Wailing Bonus column along with an associated note, the player can tilt the guitar upright while playing the note to receive bonus points.

The player&#x27;s accuracy is judged for each note played. The current system uses the names &quot;Perfect&quot;, &quot;Great&quot;, &quot;Good&quot;, &quot;OK&quot;, and &quot;Miss&quot; to indicate a player&#x27;s accuracy. Ratings of Miss will deplete the player&#x27;s Groove Gauge, while Perfect, Great and Good ratings will replenish it. If the Groove Gauge is emptied completely, the player fails, and the game ends. Players are allowed to play anywhere from one to five songs depending on the game cabinet&#x27;s configuration, with the ability to earn additional songs in certain versions of the game. Furthermore, if &quot;fast/slow&quot; (advanced judge) is enabled, then there will be additional indicator of judge (Just/Fast/Slow/Miss). Just Perfects are called &quot;X-Perfect&quot;s (rainbow color) while Fast/Slow Perfects are regular Perfects (yellow color).

Upon successful completion of a song, players are graded on their performance. When the game ends, the player&#x27;s total score across all songs played is tabulated.

&quot;DrumMania&quot; simulates real life drumming. It is played using a controller designed to imitate a drum set. Five pads are arrayed from left to right for the hi-hat, snare drum, high tom, low tom, cymbal and bass drum. On XG series, a left cymbal, left pedal and a floor tom are added. During play, the player presses the pads and steps on the pedal in sync with the notes falling vertically from the top of the screen in time with the music.

DrumMania uses a modified Yamaha DTXPRESS electronic drumkit. This drumkit is used for players for gameplay and navigating through select screens. Navigating can also be done by pressing Select and Start button on the right side of the machine. On home releases, a drum controller made by KONAMI can be used, although rather than separating each buttons on their own pads, home controllers place the pads on a single place, more resembling a palette. PlayStation 2 DUALSHOCK Controllers may also be used.

==Session linking==
One of the major selling points of &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; is its ability to be linked to another of Konami&#x27;s Bemani games, &quot;DrumMania&quot;. This allows up to three players to join together to play simultaneously in &quot;Session Mode&quot;. During a session, the music will play simultaneously from both games, and the players&#x27; guitar and drum sounds are relayed between the two games.

Because the second version of &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; was released prior to the first version of DrumMania, GuitarFreaks is one &quot;mix&quot; number higher than the &quot;DrumMania&quot; version it links up to. For example, &quot;GUITARFREAKS 6thMIX&quot; is designed to be linked with &quot;DrumMania 5thMIX&quot;. The mix versions were synchronized with the release of &quot;GuitarFreaks V &amp; DrumMania V&quot; eschewing the long-standing number system, and replacing what would have been the 12th and 11th mix, respectively.

===Super Session===
Seen only in two releases each of &quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; and &quot;DrumMania&quot;, Super Session allowed the games to be linked up with Keyboardmania 3rd Mix as well. In addition to having three players control the guitars and drums, two more could be added playing along on keyboards. However, when linked with &quot;Keyboardmania&quot;, only about a dozen songs are available to play. &quot;Keyboardmania 3rd Mix&quot; can be linked with &quot;GuitarFreaks 5th Mix&quot; and &quot;DrumMania 4th Mix&quot;, or &quot;GuitarFreaks 6th Mix&quot; and &quot;DrumMania 5th Mix&quot;.

==Soundtrack==
The series&#x27; songlist has steadily grown with each release. As of Gitadora FUZZ UP, the latest version of Gitadora features over 1,200 songs in total. Most songs are either crossovers from other Bemani games, and Japanese pop and rock. Some mixes also contain covers of popular North American songs. Songs are primarily in-house original compositions, covers of popular Japanese or English songs or edited master tracks licensed from the artists. Most songs are pop and rock in style, although there are often a wide variety of musical genres available.

==Reception==
The arcade game was popular and played in arcades throughout Asia.

The PlayStation port of &quot;DrumMania&quot; received a positive review from Dave Zdyrko of &quot;IGN&quot; in 2000. He said that, while the game lacks realism and that it was &quot;nothing at all like playing real drums,&quot; it &quot;provides for one of the most addictive and enjoyable videogame experiences since &quot;Tetris&quot; was first unearthed.&quot;

==Legacy and impact==
It is considered one of the most influential video games of all time, for having laid the foundations for popular guitar-based rhythm games, such as the &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; series.

&quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; is believed to have inspired Namco&#x27;s similar rhythm game &quot;Guitar Jam&quot;, released later in April 1999.

&quot;GuitarFreaks&quot; and &quot;DrumMania&quot; inspired the development of popular North American console game franchises &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; and &quot;Rock Band&quot;. The Huangs raised $1.75 million for the effort, despite being turned down by some investors who &quot;thought [the idea] was too weird&quot;.

In 2008, Konami sued &quot;Rock Band&quot; developer Harmonix for allegedly violating three patents for its drum and guitar based music games. The lawsuit was eventually settled in 2010 and its claims dismissed.

Konami also partnered up with Activision for post-2007 &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; games to comply with Konami&#x27;s drum and guitar games patents, and eventually in 2009, the two, along with Raw Thrills, released &quot;Guitar Hero Arcade&quot; in North America.

==Releases==
In Asia, outside of Japan, DrumMania releases from 1st to 10thMix are known as PercussionFreaks.

The PlayStation 2 port of &quot;GuitarFreaks 4thMix &amp; DrumMania 3rdMix&quot; is known as &quot;ギタドラ! GuitarFreaks 4thMix &amp; DrumMania 3rdMix&quot;. It is the first game with Gitadora in the title.

<doc id="859275" wikidata="Q190291" url="?curid=859275" title="Displacement (geometry)">
<text>In geometry and mechanics, a displacement is a vector whose length is the shortest distance from the initial to the final position of a point P undergoing motion. It quantifies both the distance and direction of the net or total motion along a straight line from the initial position to the final position of the point trajectory. A displacement may be identified with the translation that maps the initial position to the final position. Displacement is the shift in location when an object in motion changes from one position to another.
For motion over a given interval of time, the displacement divided by the length of the time interval defines the average velocity (a vector), whose magnitude is the average speed (a scalar quantity).

==Formulation==
A displacement may be formulated as a &quot;relative position&quot; (resulting from the motion), that is, as the final position of a point relative to its initial position . The corresponding displacement vector can be defined as the difference between the final and initial positions:
formula_1

== Rigid body ==
In dealing with the motion of a rigid body, the term &quot;displacement&quot; may also include the rotations of the body. In this case, the displacement of a particle of the body is called linear displacement (displacement along a line), while the rotation of the body is called &quot;angular displacement&quot;.

== Derivatives ==
For a position vector formula_2 that is a function of time formula_3, the derivatives can be computed with respect to formula_3. The first two derivatives are frequently encountered in physics.

;Velocity
:formula_5 
;Acceleration
:formula_6
;Jerk
:formula_7

These common names correspond to terminology used in basic kinematics. By extension, the higher order derivatives can be computed in a similar fashion. Study of these higher order derivatives can improve approximations of the original displacement function. Such higher-order terms are required in order to accurately represent the displacement function as a sum of an infinite series, enabling several analytical techniques in engineering and physics. The fourth order derivative is called jounce.

==Discussion==
In considering motions of objects over time, the instantaneous velocity of the object is the rate of change of the displacement as a function of time. The instantaneous speed, then, is distinct from velocity, or the time rate of change of the distance travelled along a specific path. The velocity may be equivalently defined as the time rate of change of the position vector. If one considers a moving initial position, or equivalently a moving origin (e.g. an initial position or origin which is fixed to a train wagon, which in turn moves on its rail track), the velocity of P (e.g. a point representing the position of a passenger walking on the train) may be referred to as a &quot;relative velocity&quot;; this is opposed to an &quot;absolute velocity&quot;, which is computed with respect to a point and coordinate axes which are considered to be at rest (a inertial frame of reference such as, for instance, a point fixed on the floor of the train station and the usual vertical and horizontal directions).

<text>The GM Ecotec engine, also known by its codename L850, is a family of all-aluminium inline-four engines, displacing between 1.2 and 2.5 litres. Confusingly, the &quot;Ecotec&quot; name was also applied to both the Buick V6 Engine when used in Holden Vehicles, as well as the final DOHC derivatives of the previous GM Family II engine; the architecture was substantially re-engineered for this new Ecotec application produced since 2000. This engine family replaced the GM Family II engine, the GM 122 engine, the Saab H engine, and the Quad 4 engine. It is manufactured in multiple locations, to include Spring Hill Manufacturing, in Spring Hill, Tennessee, with engine blocks and cylinder heads cast at Saginaw Metal Casting Operations in Saginaw, Michigan.

==Generation I==

The &quot;Ecotec&quot; name was adopted in 1994 for the new generation of Family II engines (2000 in North America) . The name was already used for the Opel GM Family II engine, Family 1 and Family 0 ranges. GM intended this new Ecotec to become its global 4-cylinder, and it has already fully replaced their OHV I4 line.

The Ecotec engine is a DOHC 4-valve design with a lost foam cast aluminium block and head (L850 for 86 mm bore applications, and L880 for 88 mm bore), designed for displacements from 1.8 to 2.4 L. Development began in 1994, by an international team of engineers and technicians from Opel&#x27;s &quot;International Technical Development Center&quot; in Rüsselsheim, Germany, GM Powertrain in Pontiac, Michigan, and Saab in Södertälje, Sweden. Much of the development work on this project was carried out by Lotus Engineering, Hethel, United Kingdom. The engine uses aluminium pistons and cast iron cylinder liners. Vibration is reduced with twin balance shafts.

The first engine in the Ecotec Gen I line-up was Ecotec 2.2 &quot;L61&quot;, introduced in May 1999.

The current Ecotec line is manufactured in Tonawanda, New York.

===2.0===
==== LK9====
This engine is also known as B207 when used by Saab and Z20NET by Opel for use in the Vectra C and Signum.

LK9 is a turbocharged version of the L850 (86 mm bore) series Ecotec utilizing an all-new reinforced sand cast aluminium cylinder head and upgraded internal components. The engine features a five-bearing forged steel crankshaft, strengthened connecting rods, redesigned pistons, piston oil cooling jets, reprofiled camshafts and an integrated oil cooler. The exhaust valves are liquid sodium-cooled. All vehicles using this engine feature Saab&#x27;s Trionic 8 (T8) engine management system as well as a revised valve train. The timing chain and timing gears are also new, along with Saab&#x27;s Direct Ignition system. The reinforcements, turbocharging, intercooling, internals, dual overhead camshaft, and such were developed by GM Powertrain Sweden (Saab Automobile Powertrain). It features an bore and stroke and a 9.5:1 compression ratio. Maximum power is at 5300 rpm and of torque at 2500 rpm. Maximum boost is .

Applications:
* 2003–2014 Saab 9-3 – B207E, B207L, B207R
* 2003–2008 Opel Vectra – Z20NET (rebadged B207L)
* 2003–2008 Opel Signum – Z20NET (rebadged B207L)
* 2006–2010 Cadillac BLS – B207L, B207R

====LSJ====
The LSJ is a supercharged version of the LK9 Ecotec with an Eaton M62 Roots-type supercharger and air-to-liquid intercooler. The LSJ shares many of its components with the LK9 such as: piston cooling jets, oil cooler, pistons, connecting rods, crankshaft, oil pan, sodium-filled exhaust valves and cylinder head. It is rated at at 5600 rpm and at 4400 rpm with a compression ratio of 9.5:1 and a 6450 rpm redline. With the end of the Chevy Cobalt S/C SS and Saturn Ion Red Line, the LSJ was discontinued after 2007. In late 2005 Brammo Motorsports struck a deal with GM for the Supercharged 2.0 L Ecotec for their Ariel Atom. The engine came in various ratings from to .

The LSJ was on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines list for 2006.

This engine is used in:

===2.2===
====L61====

The basic Family II architecture was substantially re-engineered in 2000 to become the &quot;Ecotec&quot; Gen I. Unlike its notably harsh predecessor, the engine was designed for smoothness. Dual in-block balance shafts were integral to the design, the power-steering pump was mounted directly to the cylinder head and driven by the intake camshaft, the water-pump housing was cast into the block, and the A/C compressor and alternator were mounted directly on the block without brackets. The oil filter housing was cast into the block with a removable cover and replaceable paper element. It did not use an EGR valve. The Ecotec line is manufactured in Tonawanda, New York, and Kaiserslautern, Germany, and was also manufactured for Saturn in Spring Hill, Tennessee, until Saturn&#x27;s discontinuation. In North America, this engine replaced both the Quad-4 and the GM 122 engines and first appeared in the 2000 Saturn L-Series.

The L61 is a version with a lost-foam cast aluminium cylinder head and block; it features an bore and stroke and either a 9.5:1 compression ratio or a 10.0:1. The engine is in length, in width, in height and approximately .

The Ecotec 2.2, model L61 first appeared in the 2000 Saturn LS1; the L61-powered Saturn Ion also replaced the Saturn-powered Saturn S-Series.

There are a few variations to the standard L61. The 2003 Saturn L-Series has a high output version with higher (10:1) compression and more aggressive camshaft. The 2004–2008 Chevrolet Malibu uses a version with electronic throttle control and a special unitized exhaust manifold and catalytic converter. The Malibu and Saturn versions also use return-less fuel injection. The 2002 Saturn VUE was the first North American variant of the L61 to be equipped with electronic throttle control, whereas other applications did not arise until 2005 in the Saturn ION and Chevrolet Cobalt. For 2007, introduced an updated version of the &quot;L61&quot; based on the Gen II design.

The supercharger and inlet manifold from the 2.0 Ecotec LSJ engine can be purchased as an official kit from GM and along with modified software in the ECM, can create a 2.2 supercharged version of this engine.

The L61 was used in the following cars:

This engine also powered the Japanese-market Subaru Traviq, a badge-engineered Opel Zafira A.

Following the GM–Fiat agreement, the 2.2 L engine is also used in:
* Fiat Croma unmodified
* Alfa Romeo 159 heavy modified with Gasoline direct injection

====Z22YH====
A direct injection version of the Ecotec features of power at 5600 rpm and of torque at 3800 rpm with a compression ratio of 12.0:1, and has been available in:
* 2003 Opel/Vauxhall Vectra
* 2003 Opel/Vauxhall Signum
* 2005 Opel/Vauxhall Zafira
* 2006–2009 Holden Astra (Australia and New Zealand only)

====L42====
The Ecotec 2.2, model L42 is a version of the Ecotec 2.2 designed to run on compressed natural gas (CNG). It delivers and . It is used in the 2003–2004 Chevrolet Cavalier.
==Generation II==
===2.0 LNF (Z20NHH Opel) ===

A turbocharged direct-injected (redubbed &quot;Spark Ignition Direct Injection&quot;) Ecotec was introduced in the 2007 Pontiac Solstice GXP and Saturn Sky Red Line. In these applications, the engine is mounted longitudinally. Displacement is with a square bore and stroke. Compression is 9.2:1 and maximum boost is , delivering at 5300 rpm and of torque from 2500 to 5250 rpm. Engine redline is at 6300 rpm and premium fuel is recommended. The sodium filled exhaust valves were based on technology developed for the Corvette V8 powertrains. The sodium fuses and becomes a liquid at idle, which improves thermal conductivity and draws heat away from the valve face and valve guide towards the stem to be cooled by the engine oil circulating in this area. The camshaft-driven direct injection systems pressurizes the fuel to at idle, and up to at wide-open throttle. The &quot;Gen II&quot; block is similar to the 2.4 L and also features VVT technology. The Gen II block was developed using data from racing programs and computer simulations. The bore walls and bulkheads were strengthened with a weight increase of . The coolant jackets were expanded to improve heat transfer, resulting in a coolant capacity increase of 0.5 liters.

In December 2008, GM released a Turbo Upgrade Kit for the LNF engine which increases horsepower to and torque to up to , depending on the model. The kit retailed for $650 and includes remapped engine calibration and upgraded 3 MAP sensors. The kit is covered by the cars&#x27; existing GM warranties. Boost pressure was increased from 18psi (1.24 bar) to 21psi (1.44 bar).

Unique LNF features include:
* a twin-scroll turbocharger
* cam-driven high-pressure gasoline direct injection fuel system

===2.2===
====L61====
In 2007, the L61 received a multitude of changes, that originated from the &quot;LE5&quot;. It switched to the higher-strength Gen II block and received a revised cylinder head (enlarged exhaust ports) and camshaft design (increased exhaust valve duration). The engine also switched from wasted spark ignition to individual coil-on-plug ignition; this forced the cam cover to be redesigned. It was also switched to an E37 engine controller with new crank and cam sensors (replacing timing sensor previously found in ignition cassette). These changes increase horsepower slightly and allow the engine to meet PZEV standards. Compression ratio is 10.0:1.

The L61 was used in the following cars:
====LAP====
The LAP is a version of the Ecotec, based on the Gen II block with cylinder head improvements, new camshaft design, E37 engine control module, 58X crankshaft reluctor ring, dual variable valve timing, digital crank and cam sensors, individual coil-on-plug ignition, vented starter solenoid, new MAP sensor, new intake manifold seals, new oil filter element, a 32-bit computer, and improved emissions performance.

Bore and stroke are and , the same as the 2.2 L L61. Compression ratio is 10.0:1. Major features that set it apart from the 2.2 L &quot;L61&quot; are variable-valve-timing and other cylinder head improvements from the 2.4 L &quot;LE5&quot;.

====LE8====
The LE8 is an E85-compatible version of the LAP Ecotec. Bore and stroke remain the same and . Compression ratio is 10.0:1 and the engine can run on both regular unleaded gasoline or E85.

===2.4===
====LE5====

The LE5 is a larger version of the Ecotec. Both the bore and stroke are larger, and Variable Valve Timing on the intake and exhaust improve low-end torque. Compression is 10.4:1. Power is 164–177 hp (123–132 kW) and torque is 159–170 lb·ft (215–230 N·m). The engine uses a reinforced &quot;Gen II&quot; block. Connecting rods are GKN-forged; C70 powdered metal was used from July 2007 on.

The LE5 is also used in the following overseas models:
* 2006 GM Taiwan Buick LaCrosse
* 2006 Shanghai GM Buick LaCrosse
* Buick GL8

The LE5 or a close variant is also used in the Polaris Slingshot (announced July 27, 2014), coupled with a 5-speed manual transmission and a final belt drive. The Slingshot is a three-wheeled side-by-side street vehicle, classed as a motorcycle.

====LAT====
The LAT is the designation used for the 2.4 L LE5 when used in GM&#x27;s BAS mild-hybrid vehicles.

====LE9====
The LE9 is an E85-compatible version of the LE5 Ecotec. Bore and stroke are and and has a compression ratio of 10.4:1, the same as the LE5.

====LAF====

The LAF is a direct injected 2.4 L. It uses technology based on GM&#x27;s other four-cylinder direct-injection applications, but with unique features designed for its specific application. This includes an 11.2:1 compression ratio that helps build power, slightly dished pistons that increase combustion efficiency and injectors with an application-specific flow rate.

====LEA====
The LEA is an E85 compatible variant of the LAF. Bore, stroke, and compression ratio all remain the same. Maximum engine speed is listed at 7000 rpm.

====LUK====
The LUK is similar to the LAF, but adds the eAssist mild-hybrid system. Maximum engine speed is listed at 7000 rpm.

==Generation III==
===2.0===
====LTG====
A turbocharged direct-injection version of the Gen III Ecotec was available in the 2013 Cadillac ATS and Chevrolet Malibu. This engine is also available in the Cadillac XTS and Cadillac XT5 for the Chinese market. Bore and stroke are both , and compression is 9.5:1. The engine uses a twin-scroll turbocharger with electronically-controlled wastegate/bypass valve, air-to-air intercooler, stainless-steel dual-scroll (1–4, 2–3) exhaust manifold designed to withstand turbine temperature, and a rotacast aluminium-alloy (A356T6) cylinder head with sodium-filled exhaust valves. Maximum engine speed is listed at 7000 rpm.

====LSY====
A successor to the LTG debuted in the 2019 Cadillac XT4 and the 2019 Cadillac CT6. The LSY adds Active Fuel Management and a start-stop system, putting more priority to fuel economy than performance. Peak output is lower than the LTG, but is achieved at lower rpm for both power and torque. Bore is and stroke is . This engine is used in some GM vehicles in the U.S and as the standard engine option in China.

===2.5===
====LCV====
First appearing in the 2013 Chevrolet Malibu and 2013 Cadillac ATS, the 2.5 L &quot;Gen III&quot; block has been reworked to reduce engine noise and vibrations, while improving fuel economy and low-end torque. LCV is scheduled to replace the direct-injected 2.4 L throughout North American GM products within a year. Engine production started in April 2012 at GM&#x27;s Tonawanda Engine plant.

The new combustion system developed with GM&#x27;s proprietary computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis software features a higher compression ratio which helps improve fuel efficiency and has improved knock resistance. The engine features dual overhead camshafts with continuously variable valve timing and increased-authority cam phasing (increased phase rotation angle), a high-pressure returnless direct-injection fuel system with camshaft-driven fuel pump delivering at idle and at full load, higher-flowing intake and exhaust ports in the cylinder head, electronic throttle control and pistons with jet-spray oil cooling. The engine redline is 7000 rpm.

The balance shafts are relocated from the cylinder block to oil pan module. The two-piece steel-aluminium oil pan features in-pan integrated oil-pump assembly driven by the balance shaft with a shorter inverted-tooth chain. Other improvements include inverted-tooth chain driving the camshaft, forged steel crankshaft, cast aluminium bedplate with main bearing cap inserts made of iron, high-pressure fuel rail with rubber-isolated assembly, acoustically shielded plastic cover for the intake manifold, and structurally enhanced aluminium camshaft cover and front cover. These improvements helped reduce noise intensity by 40% compared to the 2.4 L engine and change the noise signature into a higher frequency above 2,000 Hz. The engine also uses a variable-displacement oil pump and an actively controlled thermostat. Direct injection reduces emissions by 25%, while continuous cam phasing eliminates the need for an EGR system. Maximum engine speed is listed at 7000 rpm.

Displacement for the 2.5 L engine is 2,457 cc with an bore and stroke. Compression ratio is 11.3:1.

====LKW====
Same as the LCV but features Intake Valve Lift Control (IVLC) system provides two-stage variable valve lift in addition to continuous variable timing. Continuously commanded by the engine control unit, the valve rocker arm switches between high-lift and low-lift profiles on the camshaft, actuated by an oil control valve through a two-feed stationary hydraulic lash adjuster, allowing for either 4.0 or 10.5 mm lift. It also features a start-stop system. Maximum engine speed is listed at 7000 rpm.

==HCCI==
At Tech Show Torino 2008, GM Powertrain Europe announced the ignition-less HCCI (Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition) mode of the direct injection version of 2.2 L engine. The HCCI version is equipped with two-step adjustable valve lift with variable cam phasing and advanced ECU with cylinder pressure sensors, uses a lean-burn cycle similar to that of a diesel engine, and is claimed to further reduce fuel consumption by 15%.

<text>The Midland Hotel is a grand hotel in Manchester, England. Opened in 1903, it was built by the Midland Railway to serve Manchester Central railway station, its northern terminus for its rail services to London St Pancras. It faces onto St Peter&#x27;s Square. The hotel was designed by Charles Trubshaw in Edwardian Baroque style and is a Grade II* listed building.

== History ==
Built at the junction of Peter Street and Lower Mosley Street opposite Manchester Central railway station, terminus for Midland Railway express trains to London St Pancras, the hotel was designed by Charles Trubshaw and constructed between 1898 and 1903 for the Midland Railway Company at a cost of more than £1 million. In 1908, &quot;The Railway News&quot; reported that the hotel had over 70,000 guests in its first year and described it as a &quot;twentieth century palace&quot;. The hotel had a 1,000-seat purpose-built theatre where opera, drama and early Annie Horniman performances were staged, and a roof terrace where a string quartet performed.

The Midland Hotel was allegedly coveted by Adolf Hitler, who maintained a keen interest in architecture, as a possible Nazi headquarters in Britain. American intelligence speculated that the area of Manchester around the town hall was spared from bombing during the Second World War so as not to damage or destroy the Midland Hotel.

Charles Rolls met Henry Royce in the Midland Hotel, leading to the formation of Rolls-Royce Limited in 1904. The Queen Mother dined in the hotel&#x27;s Trafford Restaurant in November 1959 after attending a Royal Variety Performance at the Palace Theatre. The Beatles were famously refused access to the French Restaurant for being &quot;inappropriately dressed&quot;.

Once known as the Crowne Plaza Manchester – The Midland, it was bought by the Paramount Hotel Group (now the Hotel Collection) in 2004. It was upgraded in a £12 million renovation and was transferred to QHotels, formerly Quintessential Hotels, Paramount&#x27;s sister company.

The hotel was sold in 2018 to a partnership of the Swedish firm Pandox and the Israeli firm Fattal Hotels. The new owners undertook a £14 million renovation. , the Midland Hotel was operated by the Fattal Jurys Operation as a Leonardo Royal Hotel.

==Architecture==
The Midland has a steel structure clad in red brick, brown terracotta and several varieties of polished granite and Burmantofts terracotta to withstand the polluted environment of Manchester. This includes some fine modelled panels by the sculptor Edward Caldwell Spruce. The building shares some similarity with other highly decorative Edwardian Baroque buildings in Manchester such as London Road Fire Station and Lancaster House. The building has been designated a Grade II* listed building by English Heritage. The building was voted Greater Manchester&#x27;s second-favourite building by readers of the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; in 2012.

== Hotel ==

The hotel is close to Manchester Central exhibition and conference centre on the site of the former railway station, the Bridgewater Hall and Manchester Central Library. The hotel has 312 en-suite bedrooms and 14 suites, a health club and two restaurants – Adam Reid at The French and Mount Street Dining Room &amp; Bar.

===Restaurants===
The French, once described by &quot;The Good Food Guide&quot; as &quot;Manchester&#x27;s finest dining room&quot;, was one of Britain&#x27;s first Michelin-starred restaurants – awarded in 1974 in the first guide. It re-opened in March 2013 and chef Simon Rogan who stated his desire was to re-establish it to its former opulence and was rated the 12th best restaurant nationally in its first year of opening and awarded the best New Entry award by &quot;The Good Food Guide&quot;. The French was awarded three Rosettes – the maximum permitted in the first year of opening.

The Colony was named after the cotton traders who sold raw cotton to mill owners and referred to themselves as the Old Colony Club. It closed for refurbishment in 2013 and re-opened in the September as Mr. Cooper&#x27;s House &amp; Garden in tribute to Thomas Cooper, whose house and gardens occupied the hotel site in 1819. The family were coach-makers and their garden was famous for its strawberries, gooseberries, apples and flowers.

Following a complete makeover, the restaurant is now called Mount Street Dining Room &amp; Bar.

<doc id="859281" wikidata="Q2339765" url="?curid=859281" title="Ceuta border fence">
<text>The Ceuta border fence forms part of the Morocco–Spain border at Ceuta, a city on the North African coast. Constructed by Spain, its purpose is to prevent smuggling and to stop migrants from entering Europe. Morocco objected to the construction of the barrier since it does not recognize Spanish sovereignty in Ceuta. 

Ceuta is an integral part of Spain, and therefore of the European Union; its border and its equivalent in Melilla are the only two land borders between the European Union and an African country.

The fence consists of parallel 6 metre (20-foot) high fences topped with barbed wire, with regular watchposts and a road running between them to accommodate police patrols or ambulance service in case of need. Underground cables connect spotlights, noise and movement sensors, and video cameras to a central control booth; dozens of guard ships and patrol boats check the coast, while 621 Guardia Civil officers and 548 police officers control the shore.

==History==
In 1993 a high and long fence was built around the exclave. As the first fence was too easy to cross the construction of a new system started in 1995 bringing it up to . In 2005 the height was further increased, from .

==Breaches==
===2005 attempted border breach===
On 7 October 2005, the border fence was assaulted by hundreds of migrants, attracting international attention. Caught between Spanish rubber bullets and Moroccan gunfire, a number of migrants died (sources put the number of deaths between 13 and 18 people) and more than 50 were wounded. Some of the dead were wounded by live ammunition; of those, two died on the Spanish side of the fence, apparently shot from the Moroccan positions. The 2005 events at the Ceuta and Melilla border fences are the subject of a documentary film, &quot;Victimes de nos richesses&quot;.

Since then, migrants have occasionally died while trying to break through the fence.

===2016 breach===
The fence was breached by an organised group of 400 illegal entrants in December 2016.

===2017 breach===
On 17 February 2017, an estimated 600 migrants, some armed with clubs and shears, broke through the security gates, and 300 of them are reported to have entered Ceuta, where police attempted to locate them.

=== 2018 breaches ===

* In June 2018, 400 migrants, the majority of whom were Moroccans, stormed the fence in Ceuta.
* In July 2018, 602 migrants forced their way across the border using shears, sticks and edged weapons. The migrants sprayed corrosive substances, excrement and urine on police officers, resulting in 22 Spanish police officers being wounded, four of whom suffered major burns. After this breach, the border was reinforced with more personnel, extra police vehicles and a helicopter equipped with night-vision equipment.
* In August 2018, of the hundreds who attempted to force their way into Ceuta, more than 100 people succeeded, bringing the overall total to 1,400. The migrants again threw excrement and corrosive substances at the Spanish police, wounding seven, some of whom suffered burns. The following day, 116 Africans were deported back across the border per a 1992 bilateral agreement between Spain and Morocco.

=== 2019 breaches ===
In August 2019, migrants stormed the fence using sticks and acid. Dozens were injured, 4 people died on the barbed wire and 11 border agents were wounded.

=== 2021 breaches ===
There were further breaches in May 2021, when migrants were filmed swimming or walking around the ends of the fence on the adjoining beaches at low tide.

=== 2023 ===
On 17 November about 1000 migrants tried to enter Ceuta by charging from the East, the South and the West simultaneously. Moroccan police stopped some 900 people before those reached the fence, the rest failed to get over the barrier.

<doc id="859283" wikidata="Q34132" url="?curid=859283" title="Cylinder">
<text>A cylinder () has traditionally been a three-dimensional solid, one of the most basic of curvilinear geometric shapes. In elementary geometry, it is considered a prism with a circle as its base.

A cylinder may also be defined as an infinite curvilinear surface in various modern branches of geometry and topology. The shift in the basic meaning—solid versus surface (as in a solid ball versus sphere surface)—has created some ambiguity with terminology. The two concepts may be distinguished by referring to solid cylinders and cylindrical surfaces. In the literature the unadorned term &quot;cylinder&quot; could refer to either of these or to an even more specialized object, the &quot;right circular cylinder&quot;.

==Types==
The definitions and results in this section are taken from the 1913 text &quot;Plane and Solid Geometry&quot; by George A. Wentworth and David Eugene Smith .

A &quot;&quot; is a surface consisting of all the points on all the lines which are parallel to a given line and which pass through a fixed plane curve in a plane not parallel to the given line. Any line in this family of parallel lines is called an &quot;element&quot; of the cylindrical surface. From a kinematics point of view, given a plane curve, called the &quot;directrix&quot;, a cylindrical surface is that surface traced out by a line, called the &quot;generatrix&quot;, not in the plane of the directrix, moving parallel to itself and always passing through the directrix. Any particular position of the generatrix is an element of the cylindrical surface.

A solid bounded by a cylindrical surface and two parallel planes is called a (solid) &#x27;. The line segments determined by an element of the cylindrical surface between the two parallel planes is called an &quot;element of the cylinder&quot;. All the elements of a cylinder have equal lengths. The region bounded by the cylindrical surface in either of the parallel planes is called a &#x27; of the cylinder. The two bases of a cylinder are congruent figures. If the elements of the cylinder are perpendicular to the planes containing the bases, the cylinder is a &#x27;, otherwise it is called an &#x27;. If the bases are disks (regions whose boundary is a circle) the cylinder is called a &quot;. In some elementary treatments, a cylinder always means a circular cylinder.
An &quot; is a cylindrical surface without the bases.

The &quot;&quot; (or altitude) of a cylinder is the perpendicular distance between its bases.

The cylinder obtained by rotating a line segment about a fixed line that it is parallel to is a &#x27;. A cylinder of revolution is a right circular cylinder. The height of a cylinder of revolution is the length of the generating line segment. The line that the segment is revolved about is called the &#x27; of the cylinder and it passes through the centers of the two bases.
===Right circular cylinders===

The bare term &quot;cylinder&quot; often refers to a solid cylinder with circular ends perpendicular to the axis, that is, a right circular cylinder, as shown in the figure. The cylindrical surface without the ends is called an &quot;&quot;. The formulae for the surface area and the volume of a right circular cylinder have been known from early antiquity.

A right circular cylinder can also be thought of as the solid of revolution generated by rotating a rectangle about one of its sides. These cylinders are used in an integration technique (the &quot;disk method&quot;) for obtaining volumes of solids of revolution.

A tall and thin &quot;needle cylinder&quot; has a height much greater than its diameter, whereas a short and wide &quot;disk cylinder&quot; has a diameter much greater than its height.

==Properties==

===Cylindric sections===
A cylindric section is the intersection of a cylinder&#x27;s surface with a plane. They are, in general, curves and are special types of &quot;plane sections&quot;. The cylindric section by a plane that contains two elements of a cylinder is a parallelogram. Such a cylindric section of a right cylinder is a rectangle.

A cylindric section in which the intersecting plane intersects and is perpendicular to all the elements of the cylinder is called a &quot;&quot;. If a right section of a cylinder is a circle then the cylinder is a circular cylinder. In more generality, if a right section of a cylinder is a conic section (parabola, ellipse, hyperbola) then the solid cylinder is said to be parabolic, elliptic and hyperbolic, respectively.

For a right circular cylinder, there are several ways in which planes can meet a cylinder. First, planes that intersect a base in at most one point. A plane is tangent to the cylinder if it meets the cylinder in a single element. The right sections are circles and all other planes intersect the cylindrical surface in an ellipse. If a plane intersects a base of the cylinder in exactly two points then the line segment joining these points is part of the cylindric section. If such a plane contains two elements, it has a rectangle as a cylindric section, otherwise the sides of the cylindric section are portions of an ellipse. Finally, if a plane contains more than two points of a base, it contains the entire base and the cylindric section is a circle.

In the case of a right circular cylinder with a cylindric section that is an ellipse, the eccentricity of the cylindric section and semi-major axis of the cylindric section depend on the radius of the cylinder and the angle between the secant plane and cylinder axis, in the following way:
formula_1

===Volume===
If the base of a circular cylinder has a radius and the cylinder has height , then its volume is given by
formula_2

This formula holds whether or not the cylinder is a right cylinder.

This formula may be established by using Cavalieri&#x27;s principle.

In more generality, by the same principle, the volume of any cylinder is the product of the area of a base and the height. For example, an elliptic cylinder with a base having semi-major axis , semi-minor axis and height has a volume , where is the area of the base ellipse (= ). This result for right elliptic cylinders can also be obtained by integration, where the axis of the cylinder is taken as the positive -axis and the area of each elliptic cross-section, thus:
formula_3

Using cylindrical coordinates, the volume of a right circular cylinder can be calculated by integration
formula_4

===Surface area===
Having radius and altitude (height) , the surface area of a right circular cylinder, oriented so that its axis is vertical, consists of three parts:

* the area of the top base: 
* the area of the bottom base: 
* the area of the side: 

The area of the top and bottom bases is the same, and is called the &quot;base area&quot;, . The area of the side is known as the &quot;&quot;, .

An &quot;open cylinder&quot; does not include either top or bottom elements, and therefore has surface area (lateral area)
formula_5

The surface area of the solid right circular cylinder is made up the sum of all three components: top, bottom and side. Its surface area is therefore
formula_6
where is the diameter of the circular top or bottom.

For a given volume, the right circular cylinder with the smallest surface area has . Equivalently, for a given surface area, the right circular cylinder with the largest volume has , that is, the cylinder fits snugly in a cube of side length = altitude ( = diameter of base circle).

The lateral area, , of a circular cylinder, which need not be a right cylinder, is more generally given by
formula_7
where is the length of an element and is the perimeter of a right section of the cylinder. This produces the previous formula for lateral area when the cylinder is a right circular cylinder.
=== Right circular hollow cylinder (cylindrical shell)===

A &quot;right circular hollow cylinder&quot; (or &quot;&quot;) is a three-dimensional region bounded by two right circular cylinders having the same axis and two parallel annular bases perpendicular to the cylinders&#x27; common axis, as in the diagram.

Let the height be , internal radius , and external radius . The volume is given by
formula_8
Thus, the volume of a cylindrical shell equals    thickness.

The surface area, including the top and bottom, is given by
formula_9
Cylindrical shells are used in a common integration technique for finding volumes of solids of revolution.

===&quot;On the Sphere and Cylinder&quot;===

In the treatise by this name, written , Archimedes obtained the result of which he was most proud, namely obtaining the formulas for the volume and surface area of a sphere by exploiting the relationship between a sphere and its circumscribed right circular cylinder of the same height and diameter. The sphere has a volume that of the circumscribed cylinder and a surface area that of the cylinder (including the bases). Since the values for the cylinder were already known, he obtained, for the first time, the corresponding values for the sphere. The volume of a sphere of radius is . The surface area of this sphere is . A sculpted sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.

==Cylindrical surfaces==

In some areas of geometry and topology the term &quot;cylinder&quot; refers to what has been called a cylindrical surface. A cylinder is defined as a surface consisting of all the points on all the lines which are parallel to a given line and which pass through a fixed plane curve in a plane not parallel to the given line. Such cylinders have, at times, been referred to as &quot;&quot;. Through each point of a generalized cylinder there passes a unique line that is contained in the cylinder. Thus, this definition may be rephrased to say that a cylinder is any ruled surface spanned by a one-parameter family of parallel lines.

A cylinder having a right section that is an ellipse, parabola, or hyperbola is called an elliptic cylinder, parabolic cylinder and hyperbolic cylinder, respectively. These are degenerate quadric surfaces.

When the principal axes of a quadric are aligned with the reference frame (always possible for a quadric), a general equation of the quadric in three dimensions is given by
formula_10
with the coefficients being real numbers and not all of , and being 0. If at least one variable does not appear in the equation, then the quadric is degenerate. If one variable is missing, we may assume by an appropriate rotation of axes that the variable does not appear and the general equation of this type of degenerate quadric can be written as
formula_11
where
formula_12

=== Elliptic cylinder ===
If this is the equation of an &quot;elliptic cylinder&quot;. Further simplification can be obtained by translation of axes and scalar multiplication. If formula_13 has the same sign as the coefficients and , then the equation of an elliptic cylinder may be rewritten in Cartesian coordinates as:
formula_14
This equation of an elliptic cylinder is a generalization of the equation of the ordinary, &quot;circular cylinder&quot; (). Elliptic cylinders are also known as &quot;cylindroids&quot;, but that name is ambiguous, as it can also refer to the Plücker conoid.

If formula_13 has a different sign than the coefficients, we obtain the &quot;imaginary elliptic cylinders&quot;:
formula_16
which have no real points on them. (formula_17 gives a single real point.)

=== Hyperbolic cylinder ===
If and have different signs and formula_18, we obtain the &quot;hyperbolic cylinders&quot;, whose equations may be rewritten as:
formula_19

=== Parabolic cylinder ===
Finally, if assume, without loss of generality, that and to obtain the &quot;parabolic cylinders&quot; with equations that can be written as:
formula_20

==Projective geometry==
In projective geometry, a cylinder is simply a cone whose apex (vertex) lies on the plane at infinity. If the cone is a quadratic cone, the plane at infinity (which passes through the vertex) can intersect the cone at two real lines, a single real line (actually a coincident pair of lines), or only at the vertex. These cases give rise to the hyperbolic, parabolic or elliptic cylinders respectively.

This concept is useful when considering degenerate conics, which may include the cylindrical conics.

==Prisms==

A &quot;solid circular cylinder&quot; can be seen as the limiting case of a -gonal prism where approaches infinity. The connection is very strong and many older texts treat prisms and cylinders simultaneously. Formulas for surface area and volume are derived from the corresponding formulas for prisms by using inscribed and circumscribed prisms and then letting the number of sides of the prism increase without bound. One reason for the early emphasis (and sometimes exclusive treatment) on circular cylinders is that a circular base is the only type of geometric figure for which this technique works with the use of only elementary considerations (no appeal to calculus or more advanced mathematics). Terminology about prisms and cylinders is identical. Thus, for example, since a &quot;truncated prism&quot; is a prism whose bases do not lie in parallel planes, a solid cylinder whose bases do not lie in parallel planes would be called a &quot;truncated cylinder&quot;.

From a polyhedral viewpoint, a cylinder can also be seen as a dual of a bicone as an infinite-sided bipyramid.

<doc id="859284" wikidata="Q245656" url="?curid=859284" title="Cylinder (engine)">
<text>In an engine, the cylinder is the space in which a piston travels.

The inner surface of the cylinder is formed from either a thin metallic liner (also called &quot;sleeve&quot;) or a surface coating applied to the engine block. A piston is seated inside each cylinder by several metal piston rings, which also provide seals for compression and the lubricating oil. The piston rings do not actually touch the cylinder walls, instead they ride on a thin layer of lubricating oil.

== Steam engines ==

The cylinder in a steam engine is made pressure-tight with end covers and a piston; a valve distributes the steam to the ends of the cylinder. Cylinders were cast in cast iron and later in steel. The cylinder casting can include other features such as valve ports and mounting feet.
== Internal combustion engines ==

The cylinder is the space through which the piston travels, propelled by the energy generated from the combustion of the air/fuel mixture in the combustion chamber.

In an air-cooled engine, the walls of the cylinders are exposed to the airflow, to provide the primary method of cooling to the engine. Most air-cooled engines have cooling fins on the cylinders and each cylinder has a separate case in order to maximise the surface area available for cooling. In engines where the cylinders are removable from the engine block, a removable single cylinder is called a jug.

For motorcycle engines, a &quot;reverse cylinder engine&quot; is where the intake ports are on the front side of each cylinder, and the exhaust ports are on the rear side of each cylinder.

=== Cylinder liners/sleeves ===
Cylinder liners (also known as sleeves) are thin metal cylinder-shaped parts which are inserted into the engine block to form the inner wall of the cylinder. Alternatively, an engine can be &#x27;sleeveless&#x27;, where the cylinder walls are formed by the engine block with a wear-resistant coating, such as Nikasil or plasma-sprayed bores.

During use, the cylinder liner is subject to wear from the rubbing action of the piston rings and piston skirt. This wear is minimized by the thin oil film which coats the cylinder walls and also by a layer of glaze which naturally forms as the engine is run-in.

On some engines, the cylinder liner is replaceable, in case it becomes worn or damaged. On engines without replaceable sleeves, the cylinder can sometimes be repaired by boring out the existing liner to produce a new smooth and round surface (although the diameter of the cylinder is slightly increased). Another repair technique is &#x27;sleeving&#x27; the cylinder— boring it and then installing a sleeve in the extra space created by the boring.

Most engines use &#x27;dry liners&#x27;, where the liner is surrounded by the engine block and does not make contact with the coolant. However, cylinders with &#x27;wet liners&#x27; are used in some water-cooled engines, especially French designs. The wet liners are formed separately from the main casting so that liquid coolant is free to flow around their outsides. The advantage of wet liners is better cooling and a more even temperature distribution; however, this design reduces the rigidity of the engine.

<text>In fluid mechanics, displacement occurs when an object is largely immersed in a fluid, pushing it out of the way and taking its place. The volume of the fluid displaced can then be measured, and from this, the volume of the immersed object can be deduced: the volume of the immersed object will be exactly equal to the volume of the displaced fluid.

An object immersed in a liquid displaces an amount of fluid equal to the object&#x27;s volume. Thus, buoyancy is expressed through Archimedes&#x27; principle, which states that the weight of the object is reduced by its volume multiplied by the density of the fluid. If the weight of the object is less than this displaced quantity, the object floats; if more, it sinks. The amount of fluid displaced is directly related (via Archimedes&#x27; principle) to its volume. In the case of an object that sinks (is totally submerged), the volume of the object is displaced. In the case of an object that floats, the &quot;weight&quot; of fluid displaced will be equal to the weight of the displacing object.

==Applications of displacement==
This method can be used to measure the volume of a solid object, even if its form is not regular. Several methods of such measuring exist. In one case the increase of liquid level is registered as the object is immersed in the liquid (usually water). In the second case, the object is immersed into a vessel full of liquid (called an overflow can), causing it to overflow. Then the spilled liquid is collected and its volume measured. In the third case, the object is suspended under the surface of the liquid and the increase of weight of the vessel is measured. The increase in weight is equal to the amount of liquid displaced by the object, which is the same as the volume of the suspended object times the density of the liquid.

The concept of Archimedes&#x27; principle is that an object immersed in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the object. The weight of the displaced fluid can be found mathematically. The mass of the displaced fluid can be expressed in terms of the density and its volume, . The fluid displaced has a weight , where is acceleration due to gravity. Therefore, the weight of the displaced fluid can be expressed as .

The weight of an object or substance can be measured by floating a sufficiently buoyant receptacle in the cylinder and noting the water level. After placing the object or substance in the receptacle, the difference in weight of the water level volumes will equal the weight of the object.

<text>In psychology, displacement () is an unconscious defence mechanism whereby the mind substitutes either a new aim or a new object for things felt in their original form to be dangerous or unacceptable.

Example:

If your boss criticizes you at work, you might feel angry but can&#x27;t express it directly to your boss. Instead, when you get home, you take out your frustration by yelling at a family member or slamming a door. Here, the family member or the door is a safer target for your anger than your boss.

==Freud==

The concept of displacement originated with Sigmund Freud. Initially he saw it as a means of dream-distortion, involving a shift of emphasis from important to unimportant elements, or the replacement of something by a mere illusion. Freud called this “displacement of accent.” 

Displacement of object: Feelings that are connected with one person are displaced onto another person. A man who has had a bad day at the office, comes home and yells at his wife and children, is displacing his anger from the workplace onto his family. Freud thought that when children have animal phobias, they may be displacing fears of their parents onto an animal. 

Displacement of attribution: A characteristic that one perceives in oneself but seems unacceptable is instead attributed to another person. This is essentially the mechanism of psychological projection; an aspect of the self is projected (displaced) onto someone else. Freud wrote that people commonly displace their own desires onto God’s will. 

Bodily displacements: A genital sensation may be experienced in the mouth (displacement upward) or an oral sensation may be experienced in the genitals (displacement downward). Novelist John Cleland in ‘’Fanny Hill’’ referred to the vagina as “the nethermouth.” Sexual attraction toward a human body can be displaced in sexual fetishism, sometimes onto a particular body part like the foot, or at other times onto an inanimate fetish object. 

Freud also saw displacement as occurring in jokes, as well as in neuroses – the obsessional neurotic being especially prone to the technique of displacement onto the minute. When two or more displacements occur towards the same idea, the phenomenon is called condensation (from the German &quot;Verdichtung&quot;).

Phobia displacement or repression: Humans were able to express specific unconscious needs through phobias. These needs that were suppressed deep within themselves created anxiety and tension. The stress, fear, and anxiety that characterize a phobic disorder were the discharge.

Reaction Formation: Cognizant practices are embraced to overcompensate for the nervousness an individual feels in regards to their socially inadmissible oblivious considerations or feelings. Typically, a response arrangement is set apart by misrepresented conduct, like garishness and urgency. An illustration of reaction formation incorporates the loyal little girl who adores her mom is responding to her Oedipus scorn of her mom. 

==The psychoanalytic mainstream==

Among Freud&#x27;s mainstream followers, Otto Fenichel highlighted the displacement of affect, either through postponement or by redirection, or both. More broadly, he considered that &quot;in part the paths of displacement depend on the nature of the drives that are warded off&quot;.
Freud&#x27;s daughter, Anna Freud, also played an important role in the upbringing of these defense mechanisms by the twentieth century. She introduced and analyzed ten of her own defense mechanisms and her work has been used and increased through the years by newer psychoanalysts.

Eric Berne in his first, psychoanalytic work, maintained that &quot;some of the most interesting and socially useful displacements of libido occur when both the aim and the object are partial substitutions for the biological aim and object...sublimation&quot;.

==Lacan==

In 1957, psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan, inspired by an article by linguist Roman Jakobson on metaphor and metonymy, argued that the unconscious has the structure of a language, linking displacement to the poetic function of metonymy, and condensation to that of metaphor.

As Lacan put it, &quot;in the case of , &#x27;displacement&#x27;, the German term is closer to the idea of that veering off of signification that we see in metonymy, and which from its first appearance in Freud is represented as the most appropriate means used by the unconscious to foil censorship&quot;.

==Aggression==

Within the Freudian psychoanalytic framework, the aggressive drives may be displaced in a similar manner to the libidinal drives. Business or athletic competition, or hunting, for instance, may offer opportunities for the expression of displaced aggression. In such scapegoating behavior, aggression may be displaced onto items or people with little to no connection to the cause of the aggressors&#x27; frustration. 

Displacement can also act in what looks like a &#x27;chain reaction,&#x27; with people unwittingly becoming both victims and perpetrators of displacement. For example, a man is angry with his boss, but he cannot express this properly, so he hits his wife. The wife, in turn, hits one of the children, possibly disguising this as a &quot;punishment.&quot; (rationalization)

Ego psychology sought to use displacement in child rearing, a dummy being used as a displaced target for toddler sibling rivalry. With a purpose to apprehend how the ego uses defense mechanisms, it is important to apprehend the defense mechanisms themselves and the way they function. A few defense mechanisms are visible as protecting us from the internal impulses (e.g., repression); other defense mechanisms guard us from external threats (e.g., denial). 

==Transferential displacement==
The displacement of feelings and attitudes from past significant others onto the present-day ones constitutes a central aspect of the transference, particularly in the case of the neurotic.

A subsidiary form of displacement &quot;within&quot; the transference occurs when the patient disguises transference references by applying them to an apparent third party or to themself.

As of now encoded in subcortical neural pathways, material from our oblivious brain is pushed into our cognizant psyche as we attempt to manage mental wonders – typically agonizing – that we are encountering. With the &quot;help&quot; of mind movement, we unknowingly re-surface and re-order struggle-ridden encounters as though the past were the present and one setting were another. We move contemplations, sentiments, and perspectives, particularly about individuals who take after others. We allocate them jobs once played by others. We take on old jobs ourselves. All unwittingly. 

==Criticism==

Later writers have objected that whereas Freud only described the displacement of sex into culture, for example, the converse – social conflict being displaced into sexuality – is also true.

Freud&#x27;s hypothesis is acceptable at clarifying however not at anticipating conduct. Therefore, Freud&#x27;s hypothesis is unfalsifiable - it cannot be demonstrated valid or invalidated. Freud may likewise have shown research predisposition in his understandings - he may just focused on data which upheld his hypotheses, and overlooked data and different clarifications that didn&#x27;t fit them.

<text>In fencing, displacement is a movement that avoids or dodges an attack.

Fencers commonly use displacement when attacking while not having priority. Attacking into the opponent&#x27;s right-of-way is known as a &quot;counter-attack&quot;. If both fencers land, the fencer with priority, the attacker, is awarded the touch; therefore, the goal of the displacement is to hit the opponent while avoiding being hit in return. Displacement can take the form of retreating, advancing past the enemy&#x27;s blade, utilising a flèche, ducking, or even stepping off the piste.
